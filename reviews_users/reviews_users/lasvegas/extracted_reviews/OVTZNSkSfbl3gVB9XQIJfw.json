Big disappoint and did not live up to my expectations.   The food selection was just average, not as many choices as I expected and experienced on other buffets. The food taste was blah nothing stood out. The prime rib was all well done, no medium rare. The sushi was terrible, looked like a amateur prepared the selections. The one bright spot was the shrimp are all pealed. You don't have to mess with pealing your own shrimp.   I don't mean to sound like a snob but all the drinks are self serve. When you go to a buffet I realize you don't have a lot of interaction with the wait staff. However it would be nice to have someone greet you and inquire if they can get you a drink or let the customer know they are there to assist you in any way. Not a single person approached my table during my visit. I felt as though I was at a fast food restaurant. Is saving money on payroll worth the level of service provided to you guest?  When I'm looking at a buffet, I will most likely look else where next time.",

Helpful hint: if you want crab legs and prime rib but don't want to pay dinner prices then you need to show up at 2:30 ish. They stop serving lunch at 3pm. The prime rib and crab legs come out to the bar after 3pm. Lunch for my husband and I was $11.99 with the $2 discount ticket we purchased for the lunch buffet. Unlimited free beer and wine! White zinfandel, a red and moscato from Liberty creek. Bartenders were very nice. The desserts... Where do I start?! They have an amazing bread pudding and salted caramel mini cupcakes. There's a wide variety of Fruits to choose from. This is an international buffet so there's a huge food selection.",

The girls and I while coming here to eat dinner before heading out had to wait in a tremendous line, only to find out that there was nobody even seated in the inside of the restaurant! Then we decided to get out food after being seated, only to be let to another downfall. The food quality was horrible compared to other buffets I've been to. The food was not stirred from the workers, as you can see the old residue from the food just sitting there on the food warmers. Also, the taste of the food was to DRY for my expectations, can't say the same for everyone else. However, the buffet did some with an all inclusive bar which includes wines, champagnes, and mimosas too. The highlight of this buffet for myself would probably be the dessert bar for the food wasn't so great.",

While it was decent, we probably could have gotten a better breakfast somewhere else for the $18.99 per person we spent at Cravings.  Nice thing was it wasn't crowded.  Only two people ahead of us in line, so we got seated really quickly and off to the buffet we went.  Lots of the traditional offerings, but none of them great.  Bacon was okay, sausage was bad, hash browns pretty tasteless, eggs benedict got points for eggs with yolks that were actually runny, but points off for being otherwise bland.  Breakfast burritos tasted decent, but had been sitting out in the warmer tray way too long.  Ham carving was outstanding the first time - moist and flavorful.  So good I went back for a second piece, which this time was dry, tough, and lacking in taste.  Smoked salmon was pretty good, but with about 20 minutes to go before lunch, they had taken all the bagels away.  Scrambled eggs were disgusting - definitely powdered, and swimming in water.  The lady got an omelet and said it was good, but the line was just too long for me to make an attempt.  Beverage selection was decent, and the coffee was good.  I wasn't sure if beer and wine were included for breakfast, and wondered who would drink at breakfast anyway.  Then I saw someone from the table across from us come back with two beers and announce that they were free.  Immediately, the rest of the party gets up and comes back, each with two beers of their own.  I forgot - this is Vegas!",

One friend was a card member and we got a discount as a group. The average price per is $32.00 this includes all the beer and wine you can drink. There is a great variety of food to choose from. The food includes salads, fruit hot and cold meals, a carving station and crab legs. There is plenty of space in the dining area and you do not feed crowed while eating. They have tacos, mac and cheese, shrimp, crab legs, fish and beef brisket and turkey. The food is cooked to perfection and makes you want to come back for more. Drinks are served at the bar (bring ID) and soda, water and juice are served from drink machines. The wait staff is very friendly and professional they do watch all the tables to clean up the tables and help service the customers. The price is worth the eating at this buffet, plus the professionalism of the staff is a great selling point. I will be back to eat here because of the way we were treated and the great food and selection.",

Out of the Vegas buffets I've had the pleasure of gorging out at, this was the least quality out of them all.  They had a good selection of foods, sorted by the type. Asian, American, Italian, fish, etc. The food seemed to be fresh, but they had obviously cut some corners on the food. The eggs Benedict was served on a roll, not the typical kind I'm used to. The shrimp was, well shrimpy. There was a long line to wait for the carving station. When I got the roast beef back to the table, it was rather fatty- a low quality of beef.  The desserts seemed to be leaning heavily towards the sugar free side, which blows my mind. If you're going to a Vegas buffet, I'm sure you're not terribly concerned about your waist line.  There was a lady that came by and picked up the used plates, but there was no other service available. You had to get your own drinks like some sort of shlub.  I was pleased to see that there were about four different types of sushi, which seemed fresh.  But they were lacking many things that I have come to expect on a Vegas buffet. They had no crab legs. The pizza was a shade better than Little Caesar's Pizza.  Yes, the food was plentiful, but not the high grade that I have come to expect from the Mirage on everything else. The drinks were impressive. Free beer. But they only have Anheiser Busch products. Boo. They had one of those magical Coca-Cola machines where you can get over a hundred varieties of soda.   I was disappointed in the quality of food, but I didn't get food poisoning or anything. It was OK, but I don't think I'll be back.",

Love the carving station and crab legs so much, I never have room for much of the many other options, but I still try them, of course.  Sushi here is really good, especially the octopus (went back for seconds and thirds of that). Even the vegetarian rolls I'd never order back home but wouldn't turn down from a buffet was delicious and fresh.   I'm usually a barbecue snob who skips that section of buffets but I was so happy with everything else that I gave theirs a shot. Helps that their ribs look meaty, unlike the boney offerings I've seen at other buffets. And they were tender and tasty.  Desserts did not disappoint here. We had so many bars, cups, cakes and pies, and they were all awesome. Got lucky with our timing and caught  a great spot for the free volcano show on our way out. Perfect ending to a great dinner.  Will definitely be going back to Cravings.",

It can be anywhere between 40 minutes to 1.5 hours.  You'll never had such a wait at cravings. Since we didn't want to wait that long and we needed some sort of sustenance to soak up all the excess alcohol we drank the night before, we decided to be efficient and go to the buffet downstairs from the Mirage, where we stayed this weekend.  We arrived there around 10:30a and zipped pass the cashier since there was no line! For $28, which is $10 less than Wynn and Wicked,  we got not only entry into the buffet, but unlimited mimosas.  While I wouldn't say the choice selection here is that big of a range, they did have all I wanted from a buffet. Smoked salmon, check. King crab legs, check. Prime rib, check! But one of the greatest things I discovered at this buffet was that they had Bouillabaisse!! The soup was prepared pretty well, while it doesn't compare to what I had in Marseilles in 2010, it sure hit the spot in my stomach and evoked many great memories from my time in Europe!  Overall, Cravings is an underrated buffet you should consider if you don't want to wait at Wynn or Wicked. 4 stars and definitely returning again!",

The food was mediocre.  I ate the usual crab legs.  The only thing I liked was the Nigiri.  The rest of sushi selection sucked.  i wouldn't eat here again unless I wanted to drink beer.",

The guy behind the pan is so sweet and spends time talking to and getting to know each guest!  The prime rib was insanely out of the world good! I was surprised at how much I loved it because I am not a prime rib kind of person.   I loved how things were in individual servings such as the soy pods.   They will make you a personalized salad, but if salad is your thing, you have no right entering a buffet. Leave now!  I loved the crab legs, fresh shrimp and so much more. The Latin section was amazing with fresh guac that is heavenly.   The pizza is ok, nothing to write home about but it is at the Papa John/Dominios level.   I highly recommend it bc they have a full bar, it is super clean, staff is attentive and friendly and they have tons of food.  Deserts are plentiful and amazing. They have a great sugar-free selection of ice creams and sorbets!",

The won ton noodle soup was very tasty, as were the sel mei, pot stickers and egg rolls. often times at other restaurants,  they are not. The vegetable chow mein was spot on too.

They get a lot of points with because they serve Pho (ok its not the best but it has fresh broth and noodles) and the overall quality of the food is very good plus the shear variety pleases me to no end :)  Positives The kitchens of each of the food types are open to view. Decor is lovely, modern and has a variety of decorations. Tons of variety: Sandwich bar, Asian Noodle & Dim Sum, Japanese, Italian, Chinese, American, Mexican, BBQ, desert, Omelet Station, peel and eat shrimp, and so on.  Negatives Its a buffet - as much as I love them they can be very impersonal.  I have been here a couple times and I do enjoy it but like any Buffet they do have some inconsistencies with food quality - some items amazing and some, well, sucky.  They are a safe bet though and I will go again!",

There was no line to pay so we headed straight up to the registered and payed the entrance fee.   We were seated by a nice lady and we started to grub. I think it was crab legs night so that's what we all went for first. We all grabbed a plate load of crab legs with butter and munched on those for a good while. They had other stuff like some sushi stuff that i ate, but it was all about the crab legs.   For dessert that had a little gelato bar so i got some of each flavor. They had the little dessert treats that were so-so...so i didn't really eat any of those.   Overall the service was good. Whenever i left an empty plate on the table, it was picked up by the time i got back with a new plate. I ordered an ice tea and i can say it was never empty. Also it was very clean and it was a good experience.",

I wasn't too hungry, but I managed to eat well and not feel disgusted.  They had a good raw bar with fresh shrimp and crab legs.  The ceviche was damn spicy!!

Now, let me tell you, 9 girls getting ready is not a fun time when you ony have two rooms. I was hungover, in dire need of : A)My morning coffee B) A bottomless supply of mamosas C) Mass amounts of food D) All of the above.  So, after two hours of me pacing and complaining of the lack of speed from some hungover people we make our way to the Mirage. Buffet cost: $25. Shit. I told Kelly  would pay for her. This better be good for fifty bucks.  It was. There was everything! The waitress promptly brought us 9 mimosas and waters. Bottomless mimosas were included. I love it. I ate: A panini, deep dish pizza, gelato, sushi, chinese noodles, mashed potatoes, crab legs, shrimp, chilaquilas, breakfast burrito, and washed it down with 20 mimosas. Yes 20. The lady was awesome. I would take a sip after she finished pouring and she would come back and fill the little that I had drank. Then Liz didn't want hers and I aqcuired two glasses. This turned into a competition between Kelly and I, who could drink the most before she left the table. because this lady would always refill.  I love you lady. I asked you to come home with me but you wouldn't. But you ensured me to definitely come back.",

Asian, American, Carving and Italian stations were not appealing to the eye and food did not look appetizing.

When the manager came to speak to the both of us her was going to comp are meal and asked to walk to the front of the Buffet for him to take care of this. We didn't ask for this but just wanted him to know so they would be aware of this situation. While the manager was helping us we got upset because he started to get an attitude towards the both us. The manager came around the counter got in my wife's face and asked what are room number was and that her was going to call security on us!  All I can say is WOW...",

I don't know if it was because the last couple of times I went there I was starving or if the food really was good, but compared to my previous visits this time was a bummer.  The buffet is set up with several different stations resembling regions in cuisines.  There's Italian, Rotisserie, Carving, Chinese, Fishmonger (fish), Japanese, soups, salads, sandwich, and desserts.  The Rotisserie, Carving, Chinese, and Japanese are usually good.    This trip I had Carving, Fish, Chinese and Japanese.  At the Carving station I had Prime Rib w/ Au Jus sauce, mashed potatoes, and herb-roasted potatoes.  At the Fish station I tried the grilled cod.  At the Chinese I tried their various forms of shu mai (w/ shrimp and pork), fried rice, chow mein, and sweet & sour pork.  And at the Japanese station I tried their sushi.  There were some high points and some low points...  + = prime rib was rare and juicy (the way I like it), the shu mai (especially the shrimp) was excellent, the sweet & sour pork was tender with just the right kick of sweet and sour, the deep fried salmon hand roll was a surprise because of the crunchiness of the deep fried salmon, DESSERT STATION!  - = the fried rice was overcooked, it was hard and bland, the sushi station was kind of pathetic  Bottom Line = Like I said before, I am a fan and will most definitely try this buffet again, however, this most recent trip was not as memorable.  I think the best part of the meal/buffet was the dessert station.  I loved that they serve gelato ice cream.  Very creamy and tasty.  They also had this simple chocolate mousse between pastry layers that was also delish.",

They make it seem like a huge buffet.. but it's set up where different themes are sectioned off.. the spaces between each section is rather large.. very spacey..  But it's ok.. it's like getting a workout while eating at the same time..  Their desserts were good..   I love coming to this buffet..",

    "text": "I have been here several times and it has never disappointed.  The buffet has a wide variety of food choices, and all food is at the appropriate temperature.  If you love peel and eat shrimp you will enjoy the fact that the shrimp is already peeled and they are plump and tasty.  The salad bar has a vast selection of toppings and all vegetables are fresh.  Make sure to stop by the BBQ area;  great sauce and tender ribs.  We went to the buffet mid week for dinner and the price was $32.00 per person (with tax).  This is an excellent bargain for really good food at a casino on the strip. Oh, did I mention that the price includes beer and/or wine!  Sounding even better now, right?I took off a star because of the service; or the new lack of service.  They no longer take your drink order;  there is a fountain area where you pour your own.  When I asked the \"wait staff\" where I could get lemons for my ice tea he pointed me in the direction of the seafood (nowhere near the drink area).  Really, you couldn't go get them for me?  Your lack of service was reflected in your tip;  you can get it over by the seafood!",

The Crab Legs were so addicting! I first had a whole plate and then went for seconds. The shrimp was good because it was already peeled and ready-to-eat. The Prime Rib was MELT IN YOUR MOUTH GOODNESS! :) The Seafood Cioppino was done right but may be a little spicy for some people. But I thought it was alright!   For dessert, try the NY Cheesecake with Dark Chocolate Shavins (they have a bunch of in dividual cheesecakes). It was so good! Also the hand-scooped ice cream (try the Hazelnut!) was so delicious. They have a  time that they have for Crepes and once it closes, it closes.  Service we got here was great and I don't think no one else could have done a greater job like our waiter Alberto did! Changed plates, gave us drinks when we wanted a refill. Awesome job.",

Immediately after checking into our rooms, we sought out the hotels buffet to stuff our faces.  I have only read good things about the Bellagio and Wynn buffets and so we walked in not knowing what to expect.   Overall, it was 'ok' for the price. Fortunately, there was no wait when we strolled in but it was a bit early (5pm). There's  station with Italian, Chinese, BBQ, and seafood. Their seafood option wasn't that great though. All they had was shrimp cocktail and crab legs but the crab legs are skinny and sorta sad looking.  The desserts were 'blah' and nothing mouth watering which was also no surprise to me.   Overall, we were starving and coming here served its purpose for us but it's definitely not worth a revist.",

    "text": "I'm picky and usually only like breakfast at buffets. But the weekday dinner buffet here was good, surprisingly so. Highlights for me were:  Carving station had a very delicious prime rib, and a juicy turkey. Good mashed potatoes.  If you time it right, you can go to a later breakfast and catch the carving station with both breakfast & lunch dinner  meats (eg.  apple wood smoked bacon and ham, then switch to brunch/lunch meats like prime rib).   The \"Americana\" station had crispy onion rings; pizza was also surprisingly good.   Husband liked the hot steamed crab legs with all the trimmings.   For those who want to know, there is an \"Asian\" themed section with soups, stir fries, sushi etc., there's a salad bar, and antipasto type area with cheeses, lunch meat, hummus etc.  The chefs station sauteed in front of you things like shrimp with Alfredo sauce; for breakfast, this becomes an omelette/eggs cooked to order station which is also delicious.   Pancakes, French toast were great.   Endless soda, lemonade and sparkling non alcoholic beverage options.   Beer and wine included for breakfast and lunch.   Desserts were ok; chocolate chip cookies were great.  Kid liked the frozen yogurt options; there's even a raspberry sorbet choice.   Would definitely return",

Sad when you have to tell your kids to eat more dessert. Not even the kids ate much, after a few bites.  Bread pudding was above average. Presentation looked soggy and sad, but it was moist and warm. Don't forget the vanilla sauce on the side. Fried plantains were good!   The carving station, fishmonger, Asian food... All kind of dated and sad. Nothing stood out. Service was pleasant and the Asian lady cleared the dishes away relatively quick.   Asian, small salad area, Latin, American, Italian, dessert, drinks, carving station, breakfast area...   Think I'd rather go to Soup Plantation or Fresh Choice (Sweet Tomatoes), where the salads are really good. Here, while there was variety, nothing was great.",

The fish station had your garden variety of crab legs and one type of fish, which tasted like it'd been left out for a good while.

I wanted to try something different and one of my friends suggested this place so we went. It's in the Mirage which happened to be a short walk from our hotel we were staying at The Palazzo. As far as the pricing went I didn't see any signs anywhere so I can't remember what we paid. It was roughly around $100 for two adults and two kids. Not bad in my book. There was a nice selection of all types of food labelled by different regions like- American, Asian, Seafood, Mexican etc. I especially enjoyed the crag legs! They made it very easy to eat as they pre-cut them a bit. When I do buffets I do eat a lot but when you just stick to mainly protein and veggies you can get away with it! I sampled a good amount of their desserts and nothing was exceptional and that is to be expected. I did enjoy their lemon cake though! For beverages they had everything you could think of at your disposal even a cappuccino machine! I had one with my desserts and it was creamy and frothy. They even have unlimited wine and beer included in the price which I thought was a great deal if you like alcohol. This is a great mid-priced buffet!",

The Asian/sushi section was meh and the sushi mostly had disgusting mayonnaise in it and looked to be something from the grocery store. The pork chops at the American table were worth a try but sadly the desserts were uninspired and a little stale.  They do give you free beer and wine so that's a plus, especially if you can take your time and enjoy a few beverages.

    "text": "Cravings is a great buffet for large parties.  You'll need to reserve in advance if you have a party of 16+ guest, otherwise, you'll have random tables all over the restaurant.  Also the prices.  It's $32 a person for dinner, however, that price can get discounted by veterans card (40% off up to 4 people and AAA card (20% up to 4 people).  I save a lot of money doing that.  My experience working with the staff was great especially our waitress.  She was great!!  Service was phenomenal and variety of food was great.  The best thing about eating here is the all you can drink beer and wine which is also part of the price.  I did have one negative, the person who cut me the dried up ribeye should be reviewed.  I didn't say anything at the time because I thought it was normal and it's the way they cook it.  But when bro got his ribeye, it was juicy also a large cut.  However, this place is still 5 stars because of the service, pricing discount, variety of foods, and all you can drink beer/wine . I will back definitely.  Also, Mirage is one of my favorite place to gamble",

Did not try breakfast stuff or italian. Korean was too salty. Latin has some nice peppers  Place is quite big. My fav approach, go and take my time, reading a book and making it a multi course meal.",

If you want crab, go to dinner. Yes! Hot crab with hot butter! Oh and ribs! They have delicious ribs at night.  Super solid prime rib! I ate a whole cow.  And   Unlike other buffets your ticket for entry includes unlimited beer/wine! They have a bar area where you can go get your own drinks, so no need to delay. If you've ever been to other Vegas buffets that have \"unlimited\" drinks, you know how horribly hard it is to get service! Yes, I'm talking to you paradise buffet with your sippy cups of mimosas!  And when you leave? Cravings even let's you take a to go glass of booze!!!  And yes there's free wifi inside so you can hang out all day (2 hour max)!  This is my favorite cheap buffet in Vegas!",

    "text": "Somehow my family always ends up on Vegas for Christmas Eve/holidays...so I've had my fair share of buffets from The Buffet to Wicked Spoon.  Cravings is definitely not a top-tier buffet on the level of quality and \"gourmet\" like WS or TB as I mentioned above. BUT what they lack in Vegas-status-quality, they have in quantity and affordable pricing! I HIGHLY recommend visiting tix4dinner at any of their booths on The Strip, or calling them and asking about their discounted buffet prices because our family of four saved $40 by getting our discounted buffet dinner on Christmas Eve! IT'S NOT SHADY, trust me!  Anyways, for about $27/per person for our Christmas Eve dinner, we waited for only 30 minutes (we were in the early end of the line) and THUS BEGAN THE FEAST. Cravings is well known for their UNLIMITED wine and beer...but they only have Goose Island IPA, Bud Light, and a red/white/pink from Libery Creek. OPEN BAR, ANYONE?! HAHA, but seeing as it was dinner, our family kept the vino flowing all night. It wasn't bad, but it was definitely average wine. No complaints over here, as it paired really well with my favorites: pasta bar (Astes was the BEST pasta chef--and she was so easy to talk to and really kept a positive attitude during her shift), steamed crab legs, the veggie spring rolls, and OF COURSE dessert. Faves were the cheesecake (I HAD THREE!!), fruit tart, and various cupcakes. Cookies were HELLA stale (UM EW) and the gelato was so watery it melted when I walked all the way to the opposite end of the room where our table was...sad.  I would TOTALLY come back here again. I mean, I've waited for over an HOUR at Wicked Spoon for dinner a few years back...and grant it, the food was definitely over the top and I felt spoiled rotten, BUT I wouldn't pay $80/per person when I can just get FULL AND BUFFET'D at Cravings for $27/per person with the same types of foods!! GO CRAVINGS, it's totally underrated.",

The breakfast entrees and desserts were the most delicious. Much better than breakfast at Tableau.  You cannot beat the price and quality. AAA members actually get 20% off the check. That's unbelievable. I've been an AAA member for years and never saw an actual discount until now.  Also...  beer and wine is included in the price of the breakfast buffet. No additional charge.

    "text": "Vegas buffets are always sort of hit-and-miss for me. Either they offer cheap grub that's usually mass produced and swimming in mystery juice, or it's something akin to a fine dining experience that tantalizes the taste buds and leaves you wanting more even though you're already busting at the seams. Cravings is more of the latter.  First and foremost, yes, it is a bit pricey, but two things that help offset that. First, the quality of the food that you're getting is pretty gosh darn good. Second, you need to use myVegas rewards, if you have them. Getting a two-for-one deal or even a free meal altogether makes it so much more worth it.   On to the food. Let's just say that nothing here disappointed me. They had plenty of hit soups available that were absolutely wonderful. Their selection of Asian cuisine was unusually good, and what I'd refer to as \"Americana\" was pretty spot on, too. What I like about buffets like Cravings is that the food comes out in smaller batches compared to other places. This means that the food is fresh and the quality tends to sit a little higher across the board.  Oh, and who can say \"no\" to unlimited booze? Yes, that's right. Included with dinner is free beer and wine. You can always pay for something a little more fancy, if you want, but why would you? Enjoy what you are being offered!",

Yet, from this, I learned a couple of take-aways:  1. don't come during the weekends - yes, they serve bottomless mimosas, but if you're a weak drinker like me, you'll most probably better off with other buffets.  2. don't listen to MLife desk - they have no clue on discounts available at the buffets - you can use AAA card for 20% discount on total bill 3. weekday buffet is better, yet if you insist on coming weekends, go to Rodizio  instead (heard great things about them and plan on going there next time) 4. I would rank Cravings after: Caesar's Palace Buffet, Planet Hollywood, Le Village, the Spice Market, and a slew of others - Cravings just was upsetting.   The service was pretty good, but overall - one just has a higher expectation for the food availability and Cravings was not able to fulfill 1/10th of the expectations - but still, I give them credit for the dessert bar and prime roast.",

Unlimited cheap champagne to get the party started along with a ton of food, nothing can go wrong! Our waiter/area table cleaner/champagne refiller was very funny too.

I felt a little guilty cutting in front of the massive line with my Mlife card.  I can't figure out why there were so many people there, unless you are going to use the unlimited Beer and Wine I don't see what the attraction is for people any more.  It was really average to bad this time around.  The last time we went there for Lunch they had a Salad Station, with someone making Salads and they were really, really great!  Now the Salad Station is just a lame Salad Bar.  The Crab Legs this time were also tiny and pathetic and so picked over when I was there for dinner.  They were also really overcooked so they were very difficult to get out of the shell.   The Sushi tasted old and I couldn't even eat it.  I did like the Prime Rib and they were serving some BBQ Ribs which saved the day for me.  The desserts looked better than they tasted.  I have to say the service was fantastic, our server kept clearing plates and asking us if he could get us anything.  They really need to renovate this buffet like Excalibur recently did.  Shut it down for a while and redo everything.  I do like the drink machines, it is nice not having to wait around for a refill.  I would go there if you have a comp, but that is about it.  I think people would probably rate the buffet far worse if they weren't so happy about being able to drink for free for a couple of hours.  But for a foodie like me it is pretty bad just based on the food!!!",

It's nice that beer & champagne are included and all you can drink. The mimosas was very STRONG!  Apparently Friday is considered a weekend in Vegas and therefore the price almost doubled. It was made a little easier by the fact that they accepted our AAA card which provided us a 20% discount.  One benefit was that the extra price came with lunch options as well. We enjoyed Asian, seafood, sushi, Mexican & Italian along with the standard breakfast items.  The crab legs were just ok and the chicken fried steak was too salty but the bacon, Belgium waffle, chow mein, desserts and carving stations were crazy good. I also loved that they had non fat milk.   I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here again if we weren't staying at the Mirage but if you're really wanting to eat and get a large selection of choices - this place is a great choice.",

We got there a quarter to 10, which was perfect timing because they transition from breakfast to brunch at 10. We still had time to pick up some of the breakfast offerings they took away for the more lunch-y options.  The majority of the food was mediocre. However, there were some nice things. For example, the pepper steak, bouillabaisse, prime rib, shrimp cocktail, and chimichurri were good. The raspberry tarts at the dessert section were good, too. However more often than not, we found ourselves not finishing our food to save room for other things at the buffet that might be better.  For the price, we basically got two all-you-can-eat tickets for $25, which is great for Vegas. However if given the chance, we would not go back again.",

    "text": "What happened to the Mirage Buffet that I remember from years ago?  We had dinner at Cravings because we were watching a show at the Mirage during our stay in Vegas.  There was no wait for the dinner buffet priced at $29 per person and we were shown to our table.    The buffet has been remodeled since my last visit and it isn't good.  I felt like I was dining in a square shaped school cafeteria and the servers also looked liked they worked in a school cafeteria.....all they were missing was a hair net, lol.    The buffet stations are located all along the four walls of the restaurant and the seating area was in the middle.  No ambiance at all...disappointing.  Our server, Mildred explained all of the buffet stations....seafood, Italian, American, Asian, Salad, and Dessert stations.     My dinner buffet consisted of the following: *  Cold Cracked Crab Legs - They were frozen and were defrosting in the buffet container.   *  Shrimp Cocktail -  Nothing Special *  Steamed Mussels - Again, nothing special *  Sauteed Fish Fillet - Salty *  Sauteed Broccolini - Fresh and delish! *  Salad - Made to order and tasty.  There were also a couple of types of pre-made salads which were fresh. *  Roast Beef - Dry and overcooked. *  Desserts - Cafeteria looking desserts....enuff said.  My dinner buffet at Cravings was disappointing.  I only enjoyed my salad and some of the vege entrees for $29....plus, the setting was like a mess hall.  I wouldn't return for dinner again.  2 Stars.",

Was I shocked at the quality and the variety of what they had to offer. Of course I was most impressed with the dessert bar as they had so much to offer. Smaller portions so you could sample more. The coconut macaroons were a huge hit for me as I am a huge fan to begin with. Their layout is a little different than some so make sure you take a trip around their world before you start eating I think you will be surprised.",

My family came for weekend brunch which runs from 8 am - 3 pm and is a decent deal at $19 for a wide variety of breakfast and lunchtime fare.  I loved that the space was super-clean and the service was friendly.  We were comfortable dining there for 2 hours.  Hey, gotta get our money's worth!  Of the stuff I tried, the better items were the prime rib, shrimp cocktail, wonton noodles and the CHOCOLATE GELATO.  The stuff I'd skip would be the crab legs (over-cooked), sushi (mostly rice and it's dry), dim sum (average) and the wonton dumplings (taste like they were frozen).",

In fact, it was probably my favorite decor of any restaurant I visited. It was something of a contemporary-60s-Frank-Lloyd-Wright sort of place. I really like it.   When it came to the food, that is what disappointed me. What appeared to be a very large buffet, was not as large as I suspected. There are very large tables spread around the perimeter. The food actually takes up a much smaller portion of the table. The tables looked nice... all about the presentation. Also, the food, representing different countries, was very authentic. This should score high-marks with many folks. I guess I like my exotic foods to me a little more Americanized. Don't get me wrong... it wasn't bad... it just wasn't my cup of tea. I would have liked it better if the food was a tad less exotic and there were more choices.   The dessert selection was a little stale and limited. Perhaps it was a result of bad timing. It's a gamble sometimes with a buffet.   I kept comparing it to a casino buffet in my hometown has has four times the selection of fresh, hot food with a less expensive price tag.   I'll return only if someone else wants to.",

    "text": "I was scared of this place based on some of the reviews I read. We went on a Sunday with one comped lunch, paid for the other. Expectations were low, which I've now convinced myself is the way to go into a buffet. Then you either get what you were expecting or in the case of Cravings, you get more than expected. The day we went in, we didn't know brunch was a special thing. We received not only the option of mimosas, but a wide selection  of beer and wine with our meal at no extra charge. We stuck with mimosas as that just seemed the perfect thing after a evening out on the town the previous night. The pastries were good, better than you get at any free breakfast with hotel stay (comparing it to other hotels we stay at when traveling, not in Vegas). The croissants were cold but were flaky and not overly buttery. Almost the best I've had in the U.S. Bacon was warm and crispy, not overly greasy like typical buffet bacon. We sampled the Asian, Mexican, and Salad areas of the buffet. We liked everything we tried. I did wish the Mexican station had tamales, but that's only because I was craving them. I'm a salad whore and felt their more upscale way of making/serving their salad (they make it for you but you get to pick what goes in it) was a bit snobbish. It's served in these little bowls. Probably good for the average person. When I want a salad, I want a huge plate of salad! Delicious house dressing, btw. While we've visited almost all of the buffets on the strip, I put this one at about #4 behind the Wynn, Bellagio, and Rio (ok, a little off strip but I feel it still counts). We do look forward to visiting again in the future.",

This was a first visit to Cravings, and it was a pleasant adventure.  I like the way the food was arranged, in niches, so that a few steps brought another semi-hidden surprise.  I ordered a glass of wine and was happy to see that the prices were very reasonable.  I bypassed all the carvings and the meats; we were seated near the desserts, so by the time I made my way to those sections, I was stuffed to the gills.  (Buffets never lose money on me, even when I'm paying).  But my husband and the other couple we were with made up for my shortcomings.  One of them raved about the prime rib, and the other thought the turkey was delicious.  But I loved everything I did try, especially the buffalo chicken salad, the beet, apple and orange salad, sushi cones, and the butternut squash and jalapeno soup.  I probably would have loved more, but my stretch denims were stretched out as far as they could go.  The only thing that didn't warm my heartstrings was the gelato for dessert.  I got chocolate, and it tasted ordinary and not very chocolate-y.  In their defense, though, I did put a dab of the warm chocolate lava cake on top of it.  The cake was so over-the-top chocolate-y that it may have masked the flavor of the gelato.  I'm not a big fan of buffets and generally try to avoid them.  This visit to Cravings was worth waddling for.",

    "text": "We have been to this buffet three times now, each time it gets progressively worse. We loved it the very first time a couple years ago and this was on par with the buffet at The Wynn... not so much anymore. First of all the cashier and the seating attendant were not pleasant at all. The food gets worse every time we go there.. even the desserts are worse. They used to have a larger variety of amazing treats (like creme brulee, a variety of cakes, fresh donuts,and even jars of candy for those who are into that)... now it's all very mediocre.  One of the nice things is that you do have unlimited beer and wine with the buffet... but they need to get a better bartender who actually won't look like it's such a bore to be there. They don't have enough options of the different types of food they offer at each station. And it is now a brunch and dinner option only... which limits the good lunch options because of an extra station of breakfast foods (at 2 in the afternoon most people were not even touching the food at that station, which is a waste of food and space that they could be using for foods that people would actually eat). I would love to come back here but only if I see the reviews improving.",

In the past the mirage buffet was pretty good now it's going towards Excalibur circus style buffet. Especially with the plastic Pizza Hut cups. The only reason I decided to come here because I didn't want to wait four hours for the Caesars one. What a mistake I should've waited. Also the food has no taste at all. And what's with the free wine? Is it to make people gamble all there money away when they step into the casino. It makes the buffet look trashy. I would only come back here if it's free or super deal like 2 for 1 price.",

From the get-go, the woman who took our payment was not the friendliest. She asked me if we wanted to pay a gratuity upfront or \"at the table.\" That told me a lot. Still, we went in being it was our last night in Vegas and wanted to try the buffet experience.  Why am I carping because the food was terrible, except for a few items that were not made by the restaurant such as the cheese, miso soup, and soda. The fried fish lacked salt and was very bland. Baked fish was smelly, a sign of lacking freshness. Speak of the meat at the carvings section. I opted for a piece of medium-well ribeye and a brisket. Both items were like shoe leather--tough and unchewable. The endpiece of the ribeye was over-salted and the brisket slice had no taste.   For those who enjoy alcohol, it must be a boon since they had access to it for the buffet price. For us, teetotalers, it did not matter.  If we knew the quality of the food was so poor, we would have gone to a high-end restaurant and paid for items that we could savor.",

Things they used to have: Italian gelato (6 or 8 flavors), pho, udon noodles, fish, Mexican, decent sushi selection... now they completely lack in terms of variety and quality!! . For the Mexican, they just had a chips, crappy/weird tasting guacamole, sour cream, some salsa not worth getting either. . For the carving station, the ribeye was dry, the turkey looked old,  . For the hot cooked to order Italian station the chicken in the Alfredo was disgusting frozen process meat they thawed out of the freezer  . The breakfast station that eggs Benedict, waffles, pancakes, oatmeal... which all seemed okay, but I didn't have any. . The sushi station had three items, crab sushi, yellow tail, and some weird purple rice sushi  . The seafood station has crab, which we didn't try.  . The Chinese food was comparable to cheap take out. It was okay.  . Salad bar was probably the best thing there.  . $36.99 per person for our Memorial Day brunch, not really worth it. The only thing that made it a bit more bearable was the endless mimosas, wine and beer... which you really don't want to drink too much of.",

    "text": "Convenient, get what you pay for buffet!  Let me start out by pointing out what factors were NOT added into the rating.  These will be talked about at the end of the review:  Beverage service Other diners / atmosphere Dining room seating  ~~~~~~~~~~~  Buffet is not as pricey as Bellagio, Aria, but more than Circus Circus, Excalibur.  I came for breakfast, which saw a constant flow of patrons; most likely due to this time of year being Spring Break for folks in the country, and the perfect weather to visit for those outside the country.  Food had good taste to it, and is what you expect from a self-service buffet line.  Food sits out for awhile and until mostly empty.  Some buffets will remove the dish, place a new one out, and dump the remains of the first dish onto the new one to give it more of a chance to go through.  This one places new food on top of the existing food so that the bottom of the serving plate likely has food from the start of the morning.  There is a wide selection from what you would normally expect from a breakfast, but key things I noticed was an omelette station, breakfast pizzas, and Nutella pancakes.  The serving space is relatively small and too many times while waiting my turn to a dish, some people would push past me to get further down or to another station.  Some patrons combatted this push past by waking across the dining room floor to get to another station.  Serving area was not as clean as I expected but it was not filthy either.  The only obvious point is that someone does not walk the front side of the stations and wipe spills very often.  When it comes to the ground, spills are cleaned up pretty quickly.  Drinks are self-serve, as is starting to become common with a lot of Las Vegas buffets, most recently noticed at Bellagio.  I was a bit surprised of the waitresses that roam the floors.  Normally, they would come around and refill drinks.  Since Mirage's buffet has self-serve stations, this duty was eliminated.  There was no one that came by during my experience to ask how things were going.  I did notice waitresses walk around constantly, but some are preoccupied talking to other co-workers to talk to the diners.  Also, they peer over your shoulder and keep walking.  I saw this with about 5 of the waitresses walking the dining room grounds.  None of them said a word to a diner unless they needed something, like silverware or napkins.  All in all, you get what you pay for.  The quality is better than half of the Strip's buffets, but it does have their downsides.  I do intend to visit for a dinner to see how the experience may differ.  ~~~~~~~~~~~  Factors to Discuss (Not part of rating)  This buffet does have what seems to be a full service bar!  Beer, wine, cocktails, hard liquor all seen.  I was put off by one person's act of reaching in and grabbing food with her hand because she didn't see the serving spoon on the holder dish 2\" away.  I did tell a staff member, who was very quick to replace it with a fresh set of food and even a new serving spoon and holder dish.  This was a nice gesture and it makes me wonder if this always is the case both here and at other locations.  A warning:  dining room floor is fairly cramped.  Tables are put closer together with other tables that make navigating the floors a bit daunting due to the close proximity to other tables and diners.  A few times I was brushed accidentally by other diners or staff.  However, I chose not to include this in the rating because as expected, the buffets want to get as many people in and out as possible, and I can understand the logic behind this.  The tables are strategically placed in a cross-diagonal pattern instead of checkerboard so you have less of a chance to bump directly into some other diner's back when scooting your chair out.",

    "text": "A friend who lived in Vegas for a few years recommended Cravings as your best bang for your buck. Knowing we wanted at least one buffet experience, we decided to give it a go! Brunch buffet with alcohol was around $70 with tax for two people.  We certainly ended up stuffing ourselves. The meats - freshly carved and sausages - were the best part of the buffet. The seafood was fresh but nothing stunning. (There were unlimited crab legs, though!) The breakfast items were ok; I did like the breakfast burrito once I added some guacamole to it. The desserts we tried were good; my favorite was a pistachio mousse bite. (I'm surprised we had room in our stomachs.) Overall, it was a rich meal, though most of that was our own doing, of course.  It was kind of odd, but our bottomless mimosa was constantly filled by our waitress, but the bloody mary had to be filled at the station. Nothing wild about these brunch cocktails, but bottomless is good when you'll be sitting and eating for a long time.  There were lots of bachelor and bachelorette parties here after a night out. Overall, the crowd is great for Vegas people watching.  I'm glad we got to experience a good ol' Vegas buffet, but I wasn't really blown away by this experience. It was truly \"a-ok.\"",

    "text": "This is our first time here. No high expectations after the Bacchanal buffet at the Caeser Palace was very disappointing and expensive. We read a few reviews and because we are catching a show at Treasure Island we decided to give it a shot (it's close by). To start off the price for dinner for two which included 18% tip was $80 - $85. We were seated pretty quickly which was nice. The price we paid included beer and wine (all you can drink) which was pretty cool. They had Budweiser and the other was an IPA. They had the basic wine selection but we went for the beer. They do have hot snow crab legs here and they are ok but not all that. They have a variety of types of food from American, Italian and Asian. The food was not that great and most of it was warm not hot. The desserts were poor at best. If you have ever been to a $10.99 China buffet and toured the desserts then you can expect the same here. I have came to a conclusion. If you want to try a Vegas buffet like us. Just come here and pay the $40 per person and drink what you can hold and graze on the food. Stay a while and then the next night go somewhere else (not a Vegas Buffett). Trust me when I tell you the food shall not be worth the price you pay. Happy eating! Do Not come here for the Crab Legs. You will be very disappointed!!",

But we made the mistake of going back for dinner because we were tired and didn't want to walk over to the great Caesars buffet. The dinner was horrible - almost inedible - don't know how anyone could give it a good review.  The food was old, cold, meat was tough, no variety, etc.  The dessert bar was the same stuff that was there for breakfast - yogurt, cookies, donuts, etc. that they just recycled.  The prime rib and turkey was tough.  The asian bar had 2 dishes and some rice.  It was all pretty tasteless and bad.  Felt horrible that we paid $35 each for that mess.  Explains why there was a line at the Pantry restaurant.",

First beer and wine is included so thats a plus, you can also buy unlimited mimosas for $16 they will give you a while bottle of champagne to take back to your table. Note that is per person however the bartender was a doll and said that we could just get the one champagne glass and bottle, then make our own at the table with the free juices.   Come around the change over of breakfast and lunch and you will get double the choices of food as when they put the breakfast away.",

    "text": "Today we enter another exciting episode of Anthony vs. the Buffet. As always, I win if I emerge with a full belly and happy about the things I put in it. The buffet wins if it makes me hate myself.  Round One: I fill my first plate with a variety of sushi and pour myself a bowl of miso soup if for no other reason than the sushi station is adjacent to the bar (bottomless beer and wine for the win!). I'm pleasantly surprised by the quality of the rolls and the miso goes down smoothly. I mean, is it even possible to screw up miso soup? In any case, I'm very happy with my first plate and ready for further punishment. Round one goes to me.  Round Two: A thought strikes me as I chug my third glass of wine. It's only 11am. I should get some breakfast food. I mosey on down to the omelette station and have the chef whip me up one with everything. I supplement it with way too much bacon and sit down to enjoy. Unfortunately I can't get more than halfway through it. The eggs are heavy and the toppings taste like they've been sitting out for awhile. Well, they have, so I don't know what I was expecting. I shove aside the plate. Round two goes to the buffet.  Round Three: I have to bounce back from my slip up last round. I make my way to the Asian station for Gyoza and War Won Ton Soup hoping to repeat the success of the sushi. Little do I know the soup has been lying in wait like a sleeper cell, ready to pounce on my tastebuds in a flavor explosion. It is far and away the best thing the buffet has to offer. I sneak another bowl as a victory lap. I win round three.  Round Four: I'm starting to feel the pressure of fullness creeping in, so I decide to take it easy this round. I slide to the salad bar for something light, grabbing a bowl and stuffing it with a generous scoop of every topping. After drizzling it with a glob of dressing, I shove this Frankenstein's monster of a salad into my face. Surprisingly it makes me super full. But it's lettuce, right? Oh well. I call this round a draw.  Round Five: In a surprising lack of judgment I decide to finish with something very stupid. I stroll over to the carving station. \"Prime rib please.\" They slap a huge slab of dead cow on my plate and I scoop a mountain of mashed potatoes on the side with green beans. I don't know why I thought this would go well. I graze my way through the salty side of beef and do my best to put the potatoes away, but it's a losing battle at this point. Stomach at the edge of bursting, I shove aside the plate and raise my white flag. You win this one, buffet.  The verdict: Who even cares? It's $30 for all-you-can-eat (and drink of you only want beer or wine). The options aren't that great, but if you're like me and get blasted on wine first, you won't notice. 3 stars.",

I was really surprised when the chef walked me around the entire buffet and told me exactly what I could and could not eat. The results really shocked me.   It is expensive per person (which didn't surprise me much since literally everything in Vegas is overpriced). When we were seated, I asked to speak to the chef about my allergies and they couldn't find him. It took about 20 minutes, but while we waited the manager and host came in to check every so often to let us know they were still looking, etc and hadn't forgotten about us. When he did come, he was super nice and took us around the entire buffet to show me what I could eat with my gluten and dairy allergy. As in, he literally pointed to every single item of food in the whole place and said yes or no. There was a lot more than I thought. They actually had quite a few gluten free options. The pasta station has GF pasta and a separate pot of water so they don't cross contaminate. The Mexican station has corn tortillas upon request (just make sure you get a person that is used to working that station so they wipe down the grill before grilling them!!), at the Asian station, they can make you noodle dishes without soy sauce (they use rice noodles). They have some varieties of sushi, and he said he could make some things that weren't usually put out. They even have GF bread behind the salad station upon request. There are GF desserts, too, however, they all have dairy in them. The chef even said that if there wasn't anything that looked appetizing or to my liking, to come find him and he'd make whatever I want. He was really kind and accommodating. I ate too much, which isn't usually a thing at a buffet.   I didn't actually eat much from the seafood section, although they did have a large variety. All of the seafood just looked kind of sad at that time. I don't think I'm daring enough to eat oysters in the desert that look like they've been sitting out all day...",

We've been to this buffet a few times and it is slightly on the pricey side from $30.99+ but if you can eat at least a pound in crab legs (about a plate) you've covered your bill! Or if you go with a 'drinker' and can have a few glasses of red wine, you've also covered your bill.   Sushi: there are usually five or so different options with at least 1 \"non fish\" (like 'veggie/mushroom roll or inari )   Overall worth it! :)  (*added tip: if you go to \"tix4tonight\" you can save like twenty bucks)",

It's basically a very healthy version of vege and very junky meat that at least looks healthy... My bad for going with buffet on a Christmas Eve which literally ruins my night... luckily I got something afterward that I booked way ahead of time just in case anything went wrong with my food. On the good side, fruits are freshly cut which are satisfying, if you are a cantaloupe lover and can't find fresh fruits elsewhere around here, feel free to stop by and buy your $30 fruit basket. Another bright side, food safety is not an issue, which is in fact great.",

For about $34/person on a Saturday afternoon, the food was nothing spectacular. The price includes unlimited beer and wine, though the selection was also limited. I'm not sure how else I can describe the food except that it was weak af. I was so stoked for the prime rib but even that was drier than the damn Mojave desert I had to drive through to get to this place. Crab legs (steamed and cold) were small but the best part of my meal. The tuna in from their LIMITED sushi selection looked rock hard. Their salad bar didn't have fresh veggies. The fish in their fish n chips were clearly pulled out of a freezer box. It was all-in-all a very disappointing meal.  Two stars for the shorter lines, unlimited beer and wine and cheaper prices in comparison to other buffets on the strip.",

I'd have to say the chinese food wasn't that great and if you come you should try the italian, american, or seafood.  I enjoyed the salmon a lot because it wasn't overcooked and had just enough seasoning to make it interesting. The dessert wasn't that great either because the pies were still frozen. The fried rice was all soggy which wasn't too enjoyable and the ham was too salty. Overall, there was a lot of little things off with the food and it wasn't the best quality and I've seen places with more variety. I guess the only benefit is that this restaurant is cheap.  The line is also really long to get into the restaurant so we had to wait an hour and a half and the food was alright.",

Yea wine and beer were included and bottomless because the wine was likely made yesterday out of some synthetic package - terrible.   The stations themselves were mediocre at best; ITALIAN looked the best but didn't try any as it was all carbs and way to heaven to eat and the LATIN station was ok with chips/salsa and guacamole, bad canned beans, orange dye color rice, the CARVING station roast beef I have to say was very good, but the frozen crab legs and warm shrimp at the FISHMONGER looked terrible, American was empty when I went to it other than some corn bread muffins and the DESSERTS as wonderful as they looked I saw allot of them in tables with one or two small bites and the rest left. In fact most staff clearing tables were clearing plates still full of food   I guess maybe two years ago the Christmas brunch was far better that the regular buffet.    Shame - will not be recommending or returning here.",

There was nothing here that was like man I'm glad I chose this. Mashes really disgusting is they charge 22 dollars for a 5yr old, really? Just crazy a kid that young should be no more than half an adult and even 16 is pricey for someone that young. Definitely would not return and not recommend to anyone.",

I tried Prime Rib which was good, but broccoli was very chewy. Seafood bouillabaisse tasted OK, but toast bread tasted old and stale. Although it has other types of Mexican, Italian, Japanese and Chinese food, but, they were all looked unappealing to me. Crab legs and shrimps cocktail were small, rock crab claws were quite tasty, however. You can find this kind of seafood at cheap Chinese buffet restaurants. Croissant was dried and hard... Dessert bar had poor choices compare to other places. The positive things that I can think of is beer and wine are included and service was good. Won't come back and won't recommended to anyone.",

There were some things that stood out a lot such as the lobster ravioli, the dim sum stuff, and the tilapia fish.  Other things such as the sushi, which was cold, some noodles were hard, but overall, everything was pretty good. Love the dessert station!  There is a section for sugar free desserts too so you don't feel so bad for eating it.  There were lots of desserts and my favorite was the tiramisu and some kind of dark chocolate ganache thing. super yummy!  I would probably not come back here but we had some free vouchers so why not!  NOTE: -bathrooms located outside of the buffet",

We weren't expecting much from it, being the fact that it was in the mirage hotel & we hadn't really heard of it but it was definitely a nice surprise. The food was pretty good & there were pretty good selections. They also had stone crab claws when we were there & I ate like 5 plates of those. They also had a pasta station where they make the pasta on the spot for you. I believe they have two different sauces & types of pastas each day that you can choose from, and then you can choose any of the toppings available to be added into the pan. It was really good.. I ended up getting both sauces & had two plates of pasta. I also ate some of the snow crab legs & a various selection of other food. Granted, I was under the influence when I came here, but I really thought that this buffet was good & that it was underrated. I don't remember much of the dessert selection but I ate mostly the ice cream for dessert. I would definitely recommend this buffet if you're not looking to splurge on the more pricier buffets on the strip.",

They excelled in many selections... the ceviches and shrimp were fresh and yummy, the smoky gouda and wine soaked cheddar and italian meats were flavorful and upscale, the asian pork buns, pot stickers, and eggrolls were fresh and spiced well. Their pizza is really good too!   The entree selection is where it falls short. If you want prime rib, your in luck (but even then its a crap shoot, because sometimes they have a medium and a rare cut and sometimes they just have medium), but it is seasoned well and when rare is available, quite good. The other choices are mediocre and just not worth it... chicken, ribs and nothing with panache. The service can be sketchy as well. I overheard the hostess and they had only 8 servers that night so getting a drink was daunting. Desserts are dependent on the evening... sometimes spectacular (blood orange shooters and panacotta with strawberries) or sometime dull ( bread pudding and cupcakes). Welcoming dining room, large and spacious with the food stations all around the perimeter.",

The Mirage buffet is another example. For those that can actually taste quality and arent automatic shit-inhalers, big time crap here. After 3-4 years decided to plunk down a ridiculous $75 bucks for a sunday brunch. BIG mistake. But where else can you really eat under $50 for two except mcdonalds?  Good: Pastami pizza (but limited selection wheres the cool veggies/pepperoni homey? the mexican rice Diet cokes strong like bull salad bar (so-so limp-ass romaine lettuce but good toppings) Deli cuts next to salad bar=its ok, I guess, but I dont pay $35 to eat mortadella cold cuts bro. Service- fast at picking up plates and refilling. Another 15% so that makes buffet 85 bucks for two. Frightening, and it sucks.  The bad: Crab legs-dry and tasteless, 1000% frozen. (acutally some still frozen pick fast or angry mob behind you will press) Oysters turned into oyster shooters to mask the huge size and farm-raised taste. Chinese station=worse than panda express. MUCH worse. Sushi station---OMG 1/4 of a inch of fish in their prepared handrolls. Not joking. I  posted a pic;insanely claseless ripoff, 98% unchewable seaweed and rice. Wow what a fucking joke. nachos=no melted cheese, no taco meat, but they have tortillas! Ridiculous. Yeah, I guess I'll make a salsa burrito with lettuce, LMAO Fish on dishes, sitting and waiting for the bus...missed many buses. Coated buffalo wings=wow gross orange coating, filthy. Leftover breakfast items=no thanks nastee. seafood ceviche, etc=anything at raw bar is a total joke and crap. Dumpling/noodle section=crappy pork or chicken, or something that somewhat resembles shrimp (maybe its distant cousin from the farm-rasied sewers of bangladesh) No offense, bangladeshians.  Save your money. The deli, cpk, HELL taco bell anything beats this. Actually, Taco bell kicks ass. Ate 4-5 plates just out of frustration and to equal the value of what we paid, but you can finish the whole buffet and still feel cheated...",

    "text": "First of all, if you're in a Tix 4 Tonight line wondering whether or not you should buy a discount ticket to the Cravings buffet, I'd advise you to choose another place.  But more about that at the end of my review.  The food itself was nothing to get very excited about.  The high point was the Andouille sausage which had a kick to it and real flavor.  Ironically, the low point was the Cajun chicken, which looked the part but had little flavor and was so dry it was barely edible (and I prefer dry poultry to juicy).  The rest of the food, as many pointed out, was pretty bland, kind of like Golden Corral with less choices.  They do have free alcohol, so if you're more interested in drinking than eating, this may be the place for you.  I don't drink, so this was little consolation for me.  Another Yelper recommended getting a discount coupon.  I had one and came at about 1:00 PM for lunch.  The coupon (from Tix 4 Tonight) listed a lunch price of $11.99.  There were three of us, so I was expecting to pay about $40.  Imagine my shock when the Cashier announced my bill was about $80.  I told her I wanted lunch and she told me they weren't serving lunch \"today.\"  I went ahead and paid and immediately checked their website on my phone only to discover today meant ever.  There is no reference to lunch, only Breakfast, Brunch and Dinner.  Is the Mirage or Tix 4 Tonight to blame for the bait and switch/misrepresentation?  I guess that's a question for the Nevada Attorney General to figure out, I'll update to post any response I get from them.  But given the cashier's slick reply I'm guessing it's the Mirage.",

Getting your own drinks is so inconvenient and such a hassle for anyone with kids and older folks and basically anyone who does not want to have to cross half a football field to get a drink.  INstead of placing drink stations around the buffet they have them all on one wall the furthest away from the entrance and food.   Since adding the beverage machines, they lost a lot of their more interesting offerings. Very little in terms of vegetables or fresh and interesting salads. Food is all lukewarm and pizza is ALWAYS cold and congealed.   The crab legs and free wine and beer during the week is nice.  The sushi station is pretty much worthless. They should get rid of it as they offer inedible sushi that people take and throw away. Pasta station has ONE pasta dish and no other selections.  The tall blond woman manager is always scowling at guests and makes it uncomfortable to go there.   MANAGEMENT: Please ask your staff to focus on making sure the food is not cold and make sure the pizza is fresh and hot? Can you try to add a few more dishes to what is offered?",

We didn't even realize til we sat down that there was an entire other side with even more food. They have EVERYTHING here.

I must say though I was impressed with how it took about 20 minutes to seat us when there were clearly open tables. Maybe to ensure we'd start off towards the food at a comfortable get-the-hell-out-of-my-way pace? If so, mission accomplished Cravings Buffet.  They had an Italian station, 2 Asian stations, a carving station, a Mexican food station, a salad station, and a desert section where there's a hidden gelato station at the far right corner past the desert bar; it's not self serve though so be prepared to bug someone to get you delicious strawberry gelato.  I got 3 plates of food and finished about half of each because I was so overwhelmed. I got the prime rib which was delicious for being carved from a buffet station. It was medium rare and lovely and pink, very flavorful. The pastas were alright (al dente but the sauces were average) and the ceviche was just ok. Not enough citrus, in my opinion. The asian stations were more flavorful and the barbecue pork buns were nice and perfectly steamed. I strongly recommend getthing the chipotle mashed potatoes though.  (Note: If you want the perfect plate, get a slice of prime rib, a side of chipotle mashed potatoes with turkey gravy, a made-to-order salad from the salad bar, and some corn bread. So. Good.)  The sushi station was measly and didn't even look good enough to try though. I've seen better looking sushi at Chinese buffets.   Oh, but the desert station! Little pies!! I'm a weirdo for mini versions of things, like some girls. They had mini Dutch Apple Pie, mini raspberry pie (filling had souffle consistency) mini pecan pie, and a mini peanut butter pie. They were all scrumptious and adorable! The passion fruit infused cake with orange and strawberry slices on top was both aesthetically pleasing and subtly sweet. The strawberry gelato was very, very bold flavored and the cookies and cream flavor was a miss. The chocolate one was probably the best.  The service was not that great. It shouldn't be a big deal for a buffet if the waiters are good or not but the tables were kind of small and the plates were huge so it was noticeable when we'd been unattended for half an hour and even the ice in my water is gone. Because I ate my ice cubes as a form of hydration. Bad bad baaaaaaad.  The setting was pretty nice, contemporary American theme going and the stations had their respective titles above them to keep from having lines and long wait times to get food.   I would go again, if there were coupons or I'd try that tip to go for lunch prices but dinner items.",

I got 3 small plates with different selection and I can say I didn't like any of them. Chicken was dry and no flavor. Rib was mediocre at best. I tried pizza to play it safe and still nothing. Pizza didn't even taste like pizza.  Only thing that has flavor was our coke soda. We met a couple next to us and they said the same thing....they were disappointed. It took for ever to check in even without a line. I told the cashier we have a room that should be credited. Cashier verified my ID which is fine. But then she had to call front desk to see if I do have credit and took a couple more moments. I understand the verification but they need to change it because guests might think you're calling them a liar. It just seems unorganized.  They should lower the price it's not worth paying $30+ per person.",

No bagels (\"well you can put some cream cheese on some toast or a roll\" said the manager).  Crab legs served frozen solid (we can put them in the steamer for you - another great idea from the manager).  No thanks.  I was hoping for it to served the way it was intended: refreshingly chilled.  To his credit he offered to pay our brunch tab.  That's okay, we're comped anyway.  What would have gone a long way is an admittance to being short on supplies, and not lame excuses.  This is the Mirage, after all - and not some off-the-strip hotel's breakfast bar.  2 stars for excellent beverage service served up by a delightful lady.  The rest was as empty and void as the scrambled eggs - of which there were none as well.",

It's a buffet folks. . you're going to like some of the food and not like some.  I found it to be a typical selection for a casino buffet dinner.  I especially like the crab,  sushi,  shaved parmesan and italian sliced meats.  My hubby and daughter both found selections they really liked.  The wine was surprisingly good for \"free\" (I had chardonnay, daughter had Moscato). AND really liked that there was a full bar for hubby to have his Grey Goose martini. Service was impeccable.

But seriously, really great.  BF & I are definitely ranking this as our top 3, with the other 2 being Flamingo & Cosmopolitan (BF likes Aria's chinese selection, but we don't favor it as a whole).  Plenty of seafood selection, and the ceviche was a delightful treat, seeing that I haven't seen that in the other buffets, with a great amount of kick.  Large prawns too for the cocktail, so also a plus.  Service was very good.  No need to ask for refills, he would always come by & check on us.  Didn't wait in line either, luckily enough, since the lunch rush came right after we sat down.  They were constantly putting out new/hot trays, so definitely glad that they're not making giant portions and leaving them out there to sit.  Will definitely be back here!",

Not worth $40.  The Alaskan king crab legs were very tiny and didn't taste very good. The shrimp cocktail shots smelled & tasted too fishy.  Not very fresh at all.  The fried calamari & fried butterflied shrimp were pretty good, but everything fried always seems to taste good.  The seasoned potato wedges were also pretty tasty.  The $40 did include beer & wine but the food quality was just not worth the money. I'd rather spend a little more money and get fresh, better tasting quality food.

Thursday maybe their most pettty staff.  First impressions are everything aren't they.  After paying our tax of $1.58, we got to see the nicely decorated buffet with everything clearly marked. We still had choices of some breakfast stuff like bacon, sausage, eggs benedict, and they were still running omelet grill to order your own way.   Their lunch selection was decent normal suspects Prime rib, turkey, pizza.  Their shimp cocktail were really nice sized.  Avoid shimp cheviche unless you want to taste dill and no shimp. Okay, good stuff- fried pork won ton, asparagus soup, shimp st louis, tamales, chicken orange, chicken pot stickers, and several nice varieties of salads.. But as usual the dessert table is where this is at..  KEY LIME PIE just get two (three?) pieces right from the start.  Little banana cream pies are quite tasty too.  Coconut macroons were excellent as well.  These are great stand outs here.   We stayed to drink our money on unlimited champange, and had one really excellent waitress (Rene) and a handful of people who really could care less if we were there. Good place to eat with a deal!!",

    "text": "This is my fav buffet in Vegas! Every time I go to Vegas, I have to stop by here. Even if we don't go out or do anything else, if I just have me some Cravings then I'm completely happy for the rest of the day!  Prices are affordable and the food is great. I luv the craved ham and Chinese station here. Lots of variety to choose from! Try the Chinese bbq pork buns! To me, most buffets taste the same since they're making everything in big batches. So, why would I want to pay more at other buffets for the same type of selections?   Also, I hate peeling my own shrimp, so I like how cravings does it for you. They always have plenty of cut crab legs and cocktail shrimps! So enjoy!",

(If only our server was a little faster at refilling like some of the other tables had)  Being a vegetarian I realized that it might be difficult to find non-meat options at a buffet but really didn't run into too much of a problem. I really enjoyed the salad bar. At first I was disappointed because you couldn't make your own but the person who made my salad made it perfectly. Of course they could've had more options like other buffets but for the price I paid I'm not complaining.   Roughly you pay about $28 to eat here and that was fine with me.",

    "text": "I was a bit hesitant at trying out Cravings after reading some of these reviews. However, our stay in Las Vegas was this time with the Mirage, so we ended up going to Cravings after all.  We went there for lunch and paid 18.50 per person, which is an ok price.  Unless you're looking to go to McDonalds or another fast food chain restaurant, that's about the price you'll end up paying per person for a decent meal anywhere around here, so it wasn't too daunting. I ended up giving Cravings 3 stars, based on my findings below.  First of all, service was excellent.  I'd rate it 5 stars if I could separate service & food stars.  Our drinks were always filled, in fact, most of the time we'd barely emptied half our glasses before the waitress/attendant came and topped off the drink.  Also, our plates were promptly cleaned up once we were done with a course, and the waitresses/waiters & greeters were VERY friendly.   So kudos to the staff @ Cravings, keep up the good work.  Let's move on to what we're here for.... food!  I think the easiest way to rate and comment on this would be station by station.  Mexican/Latin Foods - very disappointing.  In fact, my husband even asked if there truly was a Mexican chef there or if they'd hired a British chef to handle the Latin food.  (No offense to British chefs out there that are good at all types of cuisines.... he was just playing off stereotypes, obviously.... Gordon Ramsay probably cooks better Mexican food than any Latin chef out there ;-)) ANYWAY, the plantains - huge disappointment. I love plantains, I was very excited to see them but the taste was off.  The enchiladas were not very good either, and I didn't attempt the taco fixings but I'm assuming those were ok since theres not much to prepare in way of cooking those...  BBQ - fairly tasty! :-)  They redeem themselves some!! I had a wonderful veal brisket with a tangy BBQ sauce on the side.  The sweet potato salad w/spicy mustard was also good.   They had a cornbread \"pie\" which was awesome, very smooth, and their BBQ beans were great.  I'm definitely a fan of the BBQ section of \"Cravings\".  Carving Station - Two thumbs up!! I had the thickest, juciest slices of turkey on my plate and they were not cheap on the servings, I was a very happy camper while endulging in the delights of the carving station.  Chinese - Meh.  Middle of the road, not a big selection of good stuff, but enough to satisfy any craving for Asian foods.  Nice eggrolls.  Sushi - I'll have to rely on my husband for this review as I'm not a big fan of sushi.  He said it was great, he complemented the Sushi chefs... the sushi were just the right size and they had a good variety.  Salad bar - Awesome! Great selection of fresh cold cuts!   Fishmonger/Raw bar - no comment, didn't visit those so I can't judge, however the selection was not very good and whatever they had there, didn't look too tempting....  Italian - Middle of the road, ok selection of pizzas.  Dessert -  Pretty tasty.  Best Napoleon Cake I've tasted in a long time! Also their chocolate mousse was fantastic, with chunks of chocolate bites in there, and the bread pudding was also very good.  Nice selection of sugar free desserts as well, and they tasted good... not \"sugar free\"  All in all though, I must say you can find better buffets in Vegas for less... I probably won't be choosing Cravings in the future.",

I picked up some sweet potato fries, a piece of catfish, mahi mahi, a bowl of wonton noodle soup, a vegetable spring roll, and a bowl of chicken congee. I broke my personal rule of not eating Asian food at an American buffet once again, but after two nights of partying in Vegas, I was desperately craving for something Chinese. The chicken congee really hit the spot. Way too salty, but it was comfort food. The wonton noodle soup was okay. The MSG soup was a nice cure for my semi-hangover, but the wonton filling had a mushy, pasty texture which I didn't like. Everything else was pretty bad. Tasted exactly as it looked... uninviting.",

Cold food, broken saucing on the eggs benedict, waffles and pancakes that looked and tasted like cardboard. Slow service, and I ordered tea, when coffee was brought I reminded my server I ordered tea, he came back two minutes later with another cup of coffee.  I'd say I've had decent food here over my past few visits, but I think they deserve the yelp one star! The food was gross looking at almost every station! The consensus from people I spoke to about Cravings was you don't Crave breakfast here, but might tolerate lunch and dinner.   I don't Crave you anymore Cravings! :(  No.",

They have the treasured smoked ham that I always seek out when I am in Vegas.  They even had portuguese sausage the first day we were there!  I really did a disservice to myself by not walking around to all the sections of the breakfast buffet before picking something to eat; finally on the third breakfast there, my boyfriend took me by the hand and we walked the entire buffet.  They have a meats and cheeses section that reminds me of a traditional european breakfast (one of my favorites!), fruit, an omelette/egg bar, cereal, breads, waffles bar, pancakes, breakfast sausage, bacon, and even featured biscuits and gravy!  The gravy for the biscuits and gravy was a bit on the sweet side for me, but you could tell it was quality and had the right consistency.  Each morning they featured something different.   The omelettes were one of my favorites... The chef perfectly prepared the omelettes so they not only look beautiful but the cheese is perfectly melted within the omelette.  I love the variety and the freshness of this buffet and will keep coming back!",

But, much to my joy I happened to hit Pearl on my Mlife card on my last trip so I decided I'd take advantage of the line pass and hit up Cravings at Mirage.  Honestly, it wasn't great. If you just want to stuff your face on prime rib and crab legs then, it's fine. The prime rib was the best thing here. But everything else was super mediocre. They have a tiny salad bar, where a guy makes you a salad... I didn't even bother waiting for that. Of all the hot dishes, most were dried out, or picked out. (like there would be ribs, but the mashed potatoes were empty) None of the bread baskets had butter. It also seemed like an odd mix of food...  I went on a Saturday night, it was pretty busy, I was surprised there wasn't more of a good selection. There wasn't really anyone even tending to the food which I found strange.  Overall, I'd skip it, the food was ok, it's jut not great for the value..",

On this trip, we arrived at around lunch time and included in the brunch was all you can drink beer, wine and mimosas. I must say that the all you can drink deal, made for a couple of amusing and disturbing outbursts from fans of the adult beverage, so this is not just your run of the mill humdrum establishment. You get entertainment as well! Food quality is better than average. I like the fact that you can make your own salad. So many buffets have someone mixing all your junk in stainless bowl and spilling it on your plate. I like to have the control please. Did you notice that those salad bars got scarce after the 9/11 attacks and all the fear that we would all be poisoned at a salad bar? Well, that happened right?..uh, no? Back to this buffet, the only thing missing is a really great desert section. Maybe real ice cream instead of the yogurt dispenser please?  So my advice is to hit this place for your first meal at 12: 30, and sit and eat and drink for about 2 hours, and you are good to go for the rest of the day. The $37.50 will look like a bargain. BTW, if you are not staying at the Mirage, you can use your AAA card for a discount.",

Kind of weird for me since I can't remember the last time i even been to a self serve beverage buffet.   Here's what i ate....  Hashbrown. Eggs. Sausage. Bacon. Ham. French toast. All the breakfast items was just typical.  Lunch. Various sushi rolls. Had about 6 total variety. The hunan chicken was weak. The pot sticket was decent. The kim chi was just nasty. Overall not bad for asian food selection.  Anyways i think this place is great considering its all u can eat drinks included. I'm not big on buffet but this one is the better buffets. Nothing compares to Bachannal in Ceasars Palace though. The prime rib n sushi itself was worth the 18.99.",

After raising their breakfast price by two or three bucks, they now have SELF SERVICE FOR COFFEE, JUICE AND OTHER BEVERAGES.  When those stations are crowded, waiting and spilling is not a fun event at a buffet.  We were told that it was a cost cutting measure so they could fire the bus boys (and girls).  Apparently, this is correct because there were none around, the wait staff bussed the tables.  It also seemed that the breakfast choices were reduced.  This buffet was an up and down love affair for us over twenty-five years.  Now it's down for good.  I WON'T GO BACK!",

Although the buffet is huge, meaning the buffet food is all the way around the dining tables, I was less than impressed at the quality of the food.  The top sirloin was dry (I like medium rare and juicy), they did not have any hot shrimp dishes only cold, plan shrimp and some shrimp cocktails, the king crab was split in half which was nice, but it was very much 'frozen food' tasting and super salty not at all fresh tasting, and they only had 1 dim sum item (pork 'meatballs' called shumai, which were just okay). Staff was friendly. Don't go at normal eating times, as the line was really long to get in.  Keep in mind, I'm not that picky of a person. I like value more than anything, so for $20 per person, I'm not complaining much, except that I think that there are better buffets in the area for a lower price. I certainly wouldn't pay the normal $40+ that it would have cost w/out the coupon. We went to FLAVORS Buffet the next day, and I was much more impressed with the quality of the food. They had an excellent breakfast buffet for $14 or so.",

    "text": "Cravings Buffet at the Mirage! We got in at 2:30, just in time to grab the last of the Brunch food and then stay until 3pm to get the dinner menu, and all for the brunch price! YAY!   The presentation at this place is pretty cool. They have fish tanks with fishes swimming around over the raw fish section. LOTS of carving stations and make your own stuff. There is an entire selection just for salad where they will make you any salad you want! There is, of course, all the sections one would expect from a buffet: Chinese, Sushi, Fish, Italian, Mongolian, Rotisserie, Mexican...   The most interesting thing about this place: the variety of foods. Normally when one sees an Italian section, what does one expect? Pizza, lasagna, generic pasta, right? Well, at Cravings, you get one or two generic buffet items, but then you get two or three very unique items that I have never seen at a buffet before. the Italian section had rack of lamb and garlic parmesan chicken. The Mexican section had fajitas, posole, and even some weird looking sauce / soup thing that I had never heard of before. The Chinese section did not have gross Panda Express food, it had szechuan beef, shrimp fried rice, egg rolls, and a chicken dish authentic to China. How cool is that?   The dessert selection is enormous and they have two entire shelves of sugar free items for diabetics. Thumbs up! Now I can stuff my face with food and control my blood sugar with sugar free dessert. They also had fruit, mini chocolate and banana cream pies, fresh chocolate chip cookies, and slices of every kind of pie and cake you can imagine.   I knock off two stars for a couple of reasons. One, it is pricey ($18.95 plus tax for brunch) and two, the unique food selections force you to be adventurous. Sometimes trying new foods is not a good experience. There were a few items on my plate that did not taste good at all, and that sucks when you go to a premium buffet like this one.",

We all decided to come here for dinner. Make sure you have your \"M life\" card, as it does help points wise.  For dinner its $26.99 per person, yes I know it is a little steep but its Vegas plus you are getting a lot of food. When we arrived, the line was pretty long at 8:00pm on a Tuesday night but the lone cashier kept the line moving. While standing in line we were laughing at the LCD TV's they have up. At random times they will have different foods flashing up but in slow motion (kind of like food sex) not going to explain anymore, you will just have to go yourself to see it!  The host who sat us was not too friendly but we were seated pretty fast, our table was close to the action so we didn't have to walk to far to get to everything. Only thing I totally hated was the bathrooms which were not located inside the buffet, you had to walk out hang a left, and there they were!   Our waiter was nice but it seemed like her mind was somewhere else. She took our drink orders and said we could start eating whenever we would like. All four of us made a mad dash in different directions!  FOOOODDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This buffet has:  -Pho (it is freshly made at some point, but sits out) -Wontons -Crab legs (I was impressed that these legs had a lot of meat) -Jumbo Shrimp -Prime Rib -Turkey -Lemon herb chicken -Various pre-made sushi and sashimi's (eeps do not touch) -Various deli meats and slices of cheese -Pasta -Veggies -Potatoes (Both mashed and wedges) -Woodfire Pizza -Mexican slow-roasted pork -Greek Salad -Chips and salsa -Cornbread  Dessert:  -Mango or Pistachio pudding -Chocolate Mousse -Various cheesecakes (sugar free option too) -Chocolate logs -Large selection of sugar free stuff -Macaroons (no I did not miss-spell it, it is not the French kind) -Fruit -Whipped topping -Ice Cream -Mini Pies -Cookies  And oh so much more!  After about four plates, I was tapping out... I had to sit for about 20mins before I could start on the dessert end.   The food was not bad unlike some of the reviews I have read. I put it this way some days are better than others, it happens everywhere you go! You just have to look and know before you decide on what you are going to grab and eat.   Our waiter took our plates away pretty fast and our drinks were filled with a smile.   We left in food comas and wanting our beds!! Good job cravings for stuffing us silly!!",

It is a little pricey but with the dinner service you get all you can eat crab legs (snow crab) and all of the legs are cut in half for easy and quick access to the meat.   They do have claws but they are not cut (probably due to the thickness of the shell) but every waitstaff has crackers if you ask for it.    Drinks are self serve and are one of those machines that has every flavor and lots of different choices.   The Chinese food is not so great but maybe that is a function of me eating in the large Asian community next to las vegas and food there is so good.  The dessert bar is so good and full of choices.   They also have a pasta bar where they will make you fresh pasta exactly to your specifications.  It is one of my favorite buffets in las vegas and I have eaten at many that were just huge disappointments.",

The only seafood they had for lunch was sushi and shrimp dipped in marinara.  But good news is that it does come with unlimited selections of beer and wine. Although I was too full and hungover to have any unfortunately.  Service: Service was on point. The servers always made sure our old plates were taken away.  Drinks: All drinks are self serve. They have multiple soda machines, and other options for you to choose from.  Food: I can honestly say that most of the food here was pretty good. Not BAD for the price, but not amazing either. Pretty basic selections. Sushi, salad bar, rotisserie meat, build your own, soups, pizza, etc. Dessert bar had a lot of selections, nothing too spectacular either, but edible.  Overall, its not a bad buffet if you don't want to spend that much at other casinos.",

The salads used to be fantastic, there was a lady who would ask what you wanted and prepare it for you. Now the salad area is meh.  If you desire carbonated beverages, beer or wine then this buffet is ok.   The buffets at Green Valley Ranch or Red Rock are so much better and half the price.

I'm not sure how we decided on mirage, but I've never been here so why not. The prime rib was definitely something to rave about, super tender and juice not like most buffets, but the second round it was dry..Whyyyy. Consistency people! Consistency is key.   Overall, it was extremely mediocre. Like the brink of EHHHHH and mediocre. Like it barely reached the standard of OK. Well, that's a $35 dollar buffet for you when there are $40-50 ones and even $80-90 ones during holiday season like bacchanal. There wasn't a lot of options or variety. Desserts are usually something I'm attracted to at buffets, but definitely not here. don't call your froyo soft serve ice cream gelato...because it's not. Such False advertisement. It's unlimited beer and wine which is nice, but it sucks that allllll drinks are self serve and we were seated on the opposite side...it was so far :( yeah we're lazy but when in Vegas, you just expect quality places with quality service!

We were seated, then went hunting for food.   Loved that there was an unlimited beer and wine bar - that included Moscato, which is my favorite wine! Me, being the big seafood lover, made a beeline straight to the crab and shrimp section. I also went by the carving station where they have both medium rare and well done prime rib, which is a nice touch. I perused around the other sections before sitting down, everything looked pretty good but my plate can only hold so much!   The prime rib (medium rare) was great and loved the shrimp with cocktail sauce, as well as the shrimp ceviche. The crab was ok, some pieces had some dry spots but edible. Loved the cioppino, reminded me of my own mother's version of her seafood soup. I also tried the clam chowder but it was rather bland and a bit watery to my liking. But other than that, the food was overall surprisingly good, and the service was excellent. I have a feeling the hubby and I will be back if we visit Las Vegas again.",

Dinner was disappointing and seems to be sliding backward toward mediocrity long term. Getting your own  beverages from dispensers, an MGM specialty, is aggravating, awkward, and chintzy for an upscale dinner buffet. Floor staff cleaning tables looked harried, stressed, and intimidated by strolling managers. Food selection was okay but only average compared to other $30+ dinner buffets. Prime rib was good but servings seemed rationed. The selection of desserts, not particularly important to me, looked surprisingly unappealing anyway. It's unlikely I'd return here for dinner. Besides that, I always need a car in Las Vegas and with strip casinos now charging for parking you probably won't see me on the strip again anyway: airport-like parking charges now added to increased buffet prices, reduced buffet quality - good way to lose drive-in customers who like buffets and also gamble.",

I did have a bite of my sister's pasta that was made to order, and that was quite good. A few of the mini desserts were tasty, but still nothing special.

It was pricey (over $60.00 for 2) and the food is typical low quality buffet food.. overcooked and tasteless. The crab legs on the day we ate were NOT king crab and to add; they were rubbery! The only reason I gave 2 stars is because of the unlimited beer and wine & there is a huge variety of options. It was also clean and upkept. Had the food been better quality, I would have rated higher.",

I'm giving 5 starts because is very clean, they have good service, they have high chairs for kids. And I think that is a great price. I'm gonna miss it.

Unless you have a discount on this place, find somewhere else to eat. It's not worth the full price tag. Head to the White Castle or Mcdonald's across the street for about the same quality of food for a much cheaper price.",

We visited for breakfast and lunch ($20 and $25 respectively). Most of the food is in pots with lids you have to remove. This was a bit awkward since you would have to set your plate down, remove the lid, get your food and replace the lid. Not knowing how many other people have handled the lid and where it's been set down. The chairs and furniture are in pretty poor shape and showing their age. All the beverages are self serve leaving the wait staff to pretty much pick up used plates.  Overall a good value for the money but there are many other higher quality buffets out there.",

At the door, you will need to pay $21.99 (unless you found another deal) then you'll be seated.  The hostess gave me option where I wanted to seat.  I was greeted by Nakeisha, server,  She was okay - not super welcoming.  She had offered me beverage service.  Just a soda for me today.  She proceeded to tell me about the buffet.    There are plenty of stations to choose from.  I first started with Seafood. then to salads, then to the Italian section - the rolls were really good.  Highly recommend.    As I was just finishing up my salad, there was a small incident (light bulb had exploded) at the carving station so that selection was immediately shut down for a thorough clean up.  Within 10 minutes or so, it was back up and running.  I found the food to be very good for a buffet.  The time I was there, the noise level was not bad.  For a buffet in Las Vegas, I was recommend it.",

I can honestly say, Cravings Buffet is the most consistent of all of them, and that says something.  We've gone enough times we recognize some of the same hostesses and servers.  Not sure if they recognize us, but we're always treated as if they do.    The food hasn't changed much over the years, and that's OK.  You know what to expect, and there are times that's nice.  Breakfast is our favorite time to visit, especially right before lunch as you get the best of both.   Yes, the buffet is buffet food, that means it can be sitting there a while, however the omelet station is made to order.   While a little thing, I like the cheese and cracker station.  That's almost like desert to me, although the deserts are pretty good as well.    We've been going now for over 10 years, and it's always nice to return to Cravings as we know what to expect and they haven't failed to deliver yet.  (Still wish they'd return to gelato though instead of soft serve - just saying in case someone is taking notes.)",

We looked at the website and it states that Military members and 3 of their guests will receive 40% discount. We decided to give it a shot since that was a very nice discount. Big mistake! We get to the cashier and she informs us that the 40% discount is no longer active as of two weeks ago! My husband told her that it is still on their website (False advertising), but the cashier did nothing to help us, not even call a manager to talk to us. I have eaten at several LV buffets, and Cravings is actually the worst I have had on the strip. I wish we would have listened to the reviews and spent a little more $ to get a better experience. My family will probably never be able to visit me at the same time, so this was a very big disappointment.",

They do include all you can drink beer and wine (bud light, coors light, house wine) and have the DIY options soda machine.   Spend a little extra cash and get a good meal from one of the restaurants. I'd highly recommend Osteria Costa nearby for Italian.",

    "text": "food CRAVINGS.  As with our visit to the Pantry, my mom and I visited the Cravings Buffet for dinner purely out of convenience (there was a line at the Pantry).  The Cravings Buffet is located at the Mirage Resort on the casino level near Portofino and Stack.  1.  Yes, they serve dinner!  Till 900pm.  Adult dinner pricing is $28.99.  2.  Yes, unlimited wine and beer (limited selection) are included in the dinner price.  Cheers everyone!  3.  Yes, you must now get your own drinks (we discovered that this must be a new process when we visited the Bellagio buffet the following day for lunch and found the exact same drink dispensers).  Customers may help themselves to soda, juice, and water from the multiple dispensing machines available (cups are on the side).  Visit your friendly bartender for the adult beverages at the bar in the rear.    4.  Yes, the server was friendly and nice.  She brought over extra napkins, and hand wipes for our use during dinner.  She also offered to bring any other sauces or condiments as needed.  5.  Yes, like any good Vegas buffet, there are various food stations and cuisine.  At Cravings Bufffet, these include Italian, Fish/Seafood, Latin, American, Asian/Sushi, Salad, and Dessert, of course.  I think my favorite was the Italian station....I liked the pizza and pasta.  The most disappointing station (for me and my mom) was the desserts.  We just didn't find anything to our liking really (i.e. no cheesecake).  6.  Yes, seating is plentiful.  Like any Vegas buffet, there is a sea of tables and chairs available.  Thankfully, on the night we dined it wasn't overly crowded.  7.  Yes, its a buffet...eat till you're content, or until you don't have any room left in your stomach.  BOTTOM LINE: It was a satisfactory visit at the Cravings Buffet.  I liked that the wine and beer was included with the dinner pricing.",

    "text": "This was my first time visiting The Cravings Buffet at the Mirage.  I normally stay at 1 of the many MGM resorts when I come to town and have eaten at most of them, but as I said, first time here.  I must say I was very happy with the buffet and the atmosphere.  Walking into the Casino prior to going into the buffet, the Hotel itself inside is very nice and beautifully decorated.  I know the Mirage is older, but it still holds up well.  The buffet is $29.99 for one person, Sunday-Thursday.  They offer a lot for that price and the quality is very good.  The bonus with this particular buffet, is it comes with unlimited Beer and Wine.  You could sit there for hours drinking during and after your meal if you decided to do so, what an amazing deal.  The Buffet has a carving station with Prime rib, Brisket and Turkey.  I got the prime rib and brisket, my vote is go for the brisket, so tender and flavorful, it was very, very good.  The also have a chef's kitchen for made to order items, seafood (my favorite) I loaded up on tons of crab legs as usual.  Latin, American, Asian, Sushi, Italian, salads and a desert bar.  It also comes with all you can drink self self non-alcoholic beverages.  After my 3rd trip I had to tap out and start writing this review with beer In hand.  There was not only a large selection of various types of food, everything tasted fresh and was delicious.  I would recommend checking this buffet out when you are in town, for the price, it is hard to find a better deal.  Pro tips - Park in the Treasure Island parking lot and walk over to the Mirage, the parking is free at Treasure Island, you have to pay at the Mirage unless you are an Mlife member and have at least gold status to get free parking.    Speaking of Mlife, sign up if you have not already done so, it is the MGM resorts loyalty program.  You can get discounts on all kinds of things, shows, slot play, table play as well as comps for food, etc. worth it.  I would also suggest getting my vegas slots on your iPhone, it is Connected to your Mlife card and can get you many more rewards.  As I sit here, this Buffets was free, thanks to me using my rewards, many of which you don't even have to spend money to get from the app, which is awesome.  My rating is 5 stars here, price, quality, free alcohol and overall atmosphere is excellent.  Enjoy!",

I didn't find myself enjoying much of anything. The food was either bland or not very fresh.  They do have a good variety here but I tried everything and the only things I really enjoyed eating was the watermelon, cheese, and the yellowtail nigiri. All three of these dishes just require being cut, not cooked -.-  The Chinese food here was not as good as a typical random Chinese buffet, which was really disappointing. Some of the chefs need to be trained to cook Chinese food, it can be fast and cooked properly.  A few fixes to the chef's cooking technique could make their food bearable, even if the quality is lacking.",

Great selection of food and has a great breakfast buffet to feed away any hang overs.  If you're reading for reviews looking for a buffet to really make it worth your money and has an amazing selection head down to Caesars Palace.

Grab a big plate at another station and save the grief on trying to get your 1 oz of salad and extras in the bowl.  Average to poor quality at best.

Everything else (Latin, European, Chinese, Japanese, korean) was a miss, but for the price I really didn't expect much. The prime beef was really good though and chewable.

The buffet is located to the right of the Mirage front entrance, right off the casino.  The buffet dinner costs about $30 per adult, and included unlimited beer and wine. Most buffets charge between $15-20 extra per person to add unlimited beer/wine, so that was a huge bonus for us! Beer and wine is served at the back bar, be sure to give your bartender a buck or two every time you go back to the bar. If you have any beer or wine left, drink it down a little and they will put the remaining amount in a plastic cup so you can take it with you.  The buffet has a huge variety of items, from a nice salad cheese/charcuterie station, soups, Asian station or two, American, Italian, and also a meat carving station. The buffet had something for everyone!  The dessert station had a lack of variety, that's the only thing I would say needed some help.  All servers were really good, professional, and checked on us consistently throughout our meal. You can't compare Cravings to a Wicked Spoon or Bacchanal Buffet experience but it is top notch for the price point it is at, and all other items mentioned above.",

Not only that, all of it was unseasoned. No salt, no flavor. Not enough utensils for the limited options there. Even the unlimited beer couldn't keep me here. Felt like a huge waste of money. The food should really have some flavor if they're only going to give a small selection.",

Hubby and I made our way from the Aria which btw has a fantastic buffet to the Mirage on a steamy Sunday afternoon in August. No one was in line around 7pm and we were stoked!  As we entered the seating area I noticed the strange set up of the actual food area.  The food was located around the perimeter of this enormous seating area. The only reason I gave 1 star was for the roast beef, and that was chewy and flavorless. The Chinese selections were either empty or had been sitting out all day. The seafood section was the worst I have ever experienced!  The crab claw meat was grainy, the so called Ciopino seafood soup was nothing more than tomato water with old broken seafood. The pasta was bland and the salad bar looked like it sat out all week. On top of this they had self serve drinks which had a weird McDonalds vibe to it.  This wouldn't have been so bad if the ice machines were either working or had ice in them.  This has been the absolute worst buffet that I have encountered in some time. Save your money and eat somewhere else.",

I struggled to find something decent. Italian selection was pizza and a couple pasta dishes. Meat carving station was meh. I felt hungry after leaving. Place looks a little run down which is sad cuz mirage is a beautiful casino. In other words, skip this place. Oh you get your own beverages which is ok I guess",

We saw a sign for 40% discount, YES 40%, for military and 3 additional people for the buffet.   We decided to go to \"Cravings\" for lunch and it was amazing!  Delicious food, great drink selection, friendly service, big bar, even workers proactively asking if we wanted to-go cups for our drinks!  We loved it so much we returned for breakfast, which was just as fantastic.  My Marine corps friend had the chance to meet and greet with other veterans and it was such a pleasant, clean, and friendly atmosphere.  Thank you Mirage and Cravings for honoring or veterans, I can't wait to return with my military friends on our next trip to Vegas!",

For that reason, we didn't know if we would actually like it or not, but we definitely did!   The price wasn't too bad ($36 including a fee for unlimited champagne) because the food was good and I felt like there were a decent amount of options. They had plenty of breakfast foods from waffles, french toast, eggs benedict, bacon etc. and a whole meat carving station as well as dishes associated with American, Asian, and Mexican cuisine.   Our favorite part about it was the flowing mimosas. A waitress would come by and refill our glasses on a regular basis and we were living for it. We ate, we drank, and we definitely indulged. We honestly really enjoyed this place and would love to come here again if we're ever back in Vegas!",

I always make this a Must-Visit, the buffet is shaped like a horseshoe PRO-Tip - Ask to sit in the back near the bar this will put you in the center and you have quick access food and easy access to refills. They have some alcoholic drinks for free, wine , chardonnay  I was all about the free orange juice, it was delicious!  The cuts of meats are enormous so if you don't want your whole plat covered in meat, make sure to ask for a petite slice.   This is one of the few buffets where I can easily spend an hour just nibbling on cheese and having some breads, you are going to love this buffet if you like choice but don't get too excited about the desserts selection area, it looks nice but selection is low, but they always have the ice creams and bread puddings and warm sweet breads, I'm all about the cheese area , they have a good selection.     Shout out to the Staff, They Are Excellent & Always Smiling ! Excellent food & service. + You Are In the Mirage which is Absolutely Fabulous, it's a Win-Win-Win",

As far as food goes - they had pretty much everything.  Everything but crepes that is.  The food was okay, but nothing that I have to have again.  In addition to standard breakfast staples, they also had a Mexican section, eggs Benedict, a omelet station and plenty of pastries.    We were semi-attended by a server who provided us with beverages and to clear away extra plates.   Nothing special.",

This is a review for their Dinner which was about $30/person.  1] Everything looked better than it tasted. 2] 70% of the food was cold/stale/salty. 3] if you come here for the seafood- do yourself a favor and dont: - the crab legs were icy and super salty - the sushi was pathetic, most of the sashimis were turning brown, nasty! 4] they attempted to label each of the stations according to ethnic each station was a horrid disappointment, a sad attempt at gourmet fast food.  5] Desserts: their pineapple cobbler was sure sugar. Their cookies where stale and hard, I think you can use it as a frisbe- chuck it at someone and you can give them a mild concussion. Oh, and their gelato was the worst! it was like warm soup ice cream. Yuck! 6] to top if off, the server is super rude. I think because they are too old to be working.

Everything were fresh and the raspberry dressing is ohhh yummy.  * Cold shrimps for appetizers are delicious.  * Great selections of Asian food.  * Excellent service.  Bad:  * Cold Crab legs were still frozen. Not good at all.  * Dessert is not their expertise. They are stale and not good. Sweet tomatoes has better cookies than them. Seriously.

They had your standard buffet fare...Chinese, Latin, Italian, Fish, Salad, and a Dessert bar.  Everything was really good but I really liked their Chinese food and their Salad bar.  At this Salad bar you tell the person what you want in your salad and they toss it for you and place it in a bowl.  It was one of the best salads ever!  We enjoyed this buffet so much that we decided to come here for breakfast the next morning after checking out.  We hit up the omelet station right away and made our rounds of gathering up other breakfast goodies.  They are of course much busier for breakfast than they are for lunch and the service reflected that.    The salad bar was so good from the day before that we waited until 11:00am for the bar to open up so we could get salads again!  I would highly recommend this buffet if you're in the area!",

To add insult to injury, they don't tell you that you have to get your own drinks so I added a $10.00 tip to the tab. Again this was breakfast at 9:00 in the morning, the scrambled eggs were tastless, the bacon undercooked and I had to go to each designated country before stumbling on hash browns. Since I do not posess the skills to carry multiple things at once, I gathered my breakfast items then set out on the long journey to the very back of the restaurant to search out coffee. First urn bone dry, success on second urn. Grab some oj and head back to a plate of tepid food. So coffee is hot, but food is not. I feel if I did the reverse then I would have tepus coffee. Tried a plate of crunchy melon, it is Feb granted, but someone has to know as they cut it up that it just sucks. Not sure if I will stay at the Mirage again. Use to be one of my favorites, but the nickle and diming is just an insult!",

They had a carving station with ham, turkey and beef tenderloin - so juicy, Italian with pizza and pasta, breakfast items, Mexican with guacamole and fish and latin with mussels, shrimp and clams in tomato sauce. American with okra and quinoa and chicken, sushi - not so good, chine with fried rice and eggplant and chowmein, fried wontons, salad station with fresh salami, salmon and cheese, broad desserts with cakes and donuts and frozen yogurt. Unlimited house wine and beer. Great value!!!!",

The line to pay wasn't long, but we waited about 5-10 minutes to get seated.  I was pretty impressed with the selection at this place.  I hated the lunch buffet at Green Valley, Mandalay Bay, and Planet Hollywood, so I expected this buffet to be completely disappointing.  I'm glad they proved me wrong!!  Their sushi spread wasn't that great.  They had two platters full of tiny little sushi rolls.  But they had a bunch of stations that I seriously couldn't even get to because I was so full!! They served crab legs and oysters in one end, and BBQ tri tip and filet slices on the other.  Their pasta station wasn't that great though, all they had that day was spaghetti with meatballs. Their dessert station was okay.  Their sugar free stuff did not taste very good but their gelatos, chocolate pastries, and cookies were yummy!    It was still a good experience. Another buffet to check off my list.  I only have two more months left here in Vegas, and I have 2-3 more casino buffets to hit up before leaving!",

    "text": "This place came recommended by many as the buffet with the best value food-cost wise. 25 bucks for dinner on the weekday. For my first round, I got the beef roast from the carving station, shrimps, crab legs, fish (cod and bass), sweet potato fries, and a salmon skin roll. The beef was delicious but a bit over processed or too tenderized. And you can't really choose how much it's cooked. They just slice you off a piece. And I love sweet potato fried but these were just ok. The crab was too salty for me. Next I got a bowl of pho and wonton noodle soup from the noodles station as well as some porridge/congee from the Asian station. Yeah I know I'm very Asian. They were piping hot and so tasty. The bowls are weird though so you can't put too much in there without it spilling. I couldn't eat too much after that so I went to the desserts, getting some fruit and gelato. I love that they have their own display case of gelato - about 8 different flavors worth. There's so many other stations too - pizza/Italian, Mexican, seafood, Asian, carving, salad, cold foods, noodle, and desserts. Something for everyone.   I also came here for champagne brunch a couple years ago and it was amazing. We stayed for hours, enjoying the food and out mimosas. Also a good price for good food.",

The floor plan of the buffet is great, because the line goes around the eating area and with different stations in different places.    The stations were carving: prime rib and turkey, rotisserie: chicken and potatoes, Latin: ceviche, quesidillas, enchiladas, rice, beans, BBQ: wich I didn't even get to, Sushi, salads, desserts, and a sorbet bar.  But the topper was the all you can eat shrimp and crab legs, we were so surprised and excited.  The variety was appreciated, after going to the Bellagio and seeing many of the same dish styles.  I dunno what the dinner was like, but the lunch menu was exactly what we needed after a night of drinking and a hungry stomach.  We can't wait to return to this buffet!!",

I was really craving breakfest food but found that most of their eggs/hashbrown etc... were either overcooked or just simply not tasty.  They had some nice shrimp cocktail here but it was sitting in this enclosed little area in the middle or nowhere...The crab legs were also very small and unpelled and required WAY to much work to be even worth it.  Their sushi, like most other vegas buffets, really didn't taste all that fresh or good either.  The only thing I enjoyed at this buffet was their prime rib, which was somewhat decent.  I also liked the fresh made omeletts too.  For $20.50, I would definetly skip this buffet and venture off to planet hollywood, belliago, wynn, or paris, as for a few bucks more you'll really see a big difference in food and quality.  I will someday try their dinner buffet and report back.  I will try the dinner buffet and see how it o",

What the hell did I consume for breakfast??? Ice cold milk.  It was AWESOME!! Tasted fresh, and Cold, and GOOD!!  Im not kidding you I probably had 5 or 6 glasses.   But i'm sorry, for 20 sumpin bucks.....I could've bought enough milk for a month at the store.  At a buffet (in my opinion) everyone should find SOMETHING they like to eat.

A few days in Las Vegas and I think $20 for brunch is a steal. Phew~ I gotta get out of here fast.  Well, this buffet actually was a pretty good deal, even though the quality of food varied widely.  The crab legs and shrimps at the raw bar were fresh and tasty. In fact, this is mostly what my husband ate. Go for the seafood and get your money's worth. :)  The sushi looked terrible, so I didn't bother grabbing any. The rice looked mushed up, dry, and stale. Gross.  Hot seafood section was alright. I had a bite of the halibut, which was ok. A bit overcooked but not too bad.   The omelet station was fun. You pick your ingredients, and a friendly cook will prepare it before your eyes.   The breakfast section is blah. Pancakes and french toasts were tasteless.   The salad bar was also fun. You pick whatever you want and they mix them up for you.  They also offered 2 kinds of meats (ham and prime rib) at the carving station. I believe there were also the Chinese section where they had below average dim sum and Latin section to which I didn't pay much attention.  The highlight of my meal was the crepe. The peach crepe was heavenly. I would go back just for the crepe. So soft, creamy, sweet but not overly sweet. mmmmmmmmmmmm ~~~~~~~  I am not a doughnut fan, but i was very impressed by it. It tasted very light and fresh, nothing like a gas station doughnut.   I am pleased with the brunch. If you want to drink, you pay 5 or 6 dollars more for unlimited champagne or bloody mary.",

My friends had already paid to get in and were standing there waiting for me so I told them forget it it's not even worth it for me to go in or to eat here it's not a big deal My friends felt bad and said that they would pay for the adult buffet for me which was almost $30 but I really wasn't interested in it at that point.  I had eaten here once prior when I took another friend of mine from Florida and my son to see the animals and the dolphins.  I didn't have a problem the first time I had gone in there But the way that I was treated by the manager and the girl that worked there I was really disgusted. In fact it was because of that issue that I had that afternoon I never ever tell anyone to go there I always say stay away from the buffet at Mirage.  When I had eaten there prior there was a basic variety of food there was nothing special about it at all.  I told them that the Wynn buffet was a lot better and we should've went there so what happened was I went and walked around and found clothing stores and bought shoes and clothes while they ate.  By the time they were done and came out my one friend Tad had said to me \"it kinda sucked, anyway\"  Trust me if you're going to go do a buffet there are so many others that are so much better but the treatment that day was pretty horrendous.   I wouldn't be surprised if they implode the Mirage at this point they can't even keep their night clubs together one oak is so gross it was much better as jet.  The Beatles revolution bar is kind of a joke And their nightclub is even worse.  I'm not a fan of this place at all",

    "text": "Lackluster. That describes the food. It makes up for it in quantity but there isn't any quality. They have beer and wine, and its just okay. The seafood section does have oysters but I'm worried about them getting me sick now. It has so many options but everything was flat.   The good: there are so many options and a soup at every station.  Bought my 30% discount from tickets4less. They have a pasta chef station that prepares your food. The tortellini is superb. They have a nice cheese and smorgsboard of ingredients for a picnic.   The bad: Tri-bean salad: no flavour tasted like mush. Seafood buns: the dough sticks to the tongs, mushy and the meat was tough.  Sushi: some of the worst delivery and serving spoons-tongs are a nuisance to use it was obvious by all the dropped sushi. Cranberry juice: was watered down by some filter malfunction or the syrup was just low.  Clam chowder was not marked with bacon or ham. Misleading for vegetarians.  The okra was boiled to death and had no flavour.  They do not have forks at the dessert bar.  There are not enough tongs for the desserts so cross contamination of chocolate and nuts could occur. Wipes after eating crab are not provided.  The chairs and tables are hideous and uncomfortable.   The ugly: I'm confused how they justify charging a gratuity tax when they do not serve you. You get your own drinks and spoons. Other than their cellphone flag down system to seat you, there just isn't a reason. If you bring a big group just split up.",

Prime rib is great here and the crab legs are typically pretty good and cut in half already for you.  Crab legs arent old or anything (or still frozen) and they have taste to them unlike bad ones you get that are dry or flavorless.  Prime rib was served and cut perfectly medium rare.   The variety of japanese sushi stuff is pretty weak, and the chinese is just okay.  I do enjoy the cheese/meat area though and some of the other seafood and bbq choices are okay as well.  I'll be back on a brunch morning :).",

Very disappointed in which they are carved/split in half.  This makes for less meat in the shell as well as harder to pick out with your fork.  As for the rest of the buffet?  It's a buffet.  Not very impressed.  The usual.  Egg rolls.  Buffet sushi.  Buffet chicken.  Buffet  noodles. The Creme Brulee was embarrassing for this place.  It was runny like watered down pudding. Etc, etc, etc....  Won't waist our money here again.  Unless we want the free drinks which are complementary in this buffet.",

    "text": "My fella and I came here during a weekday for dinner. We had purchased the Travelzoo deal for two buffets with unlimited beer and wine.   The place was really dead. We came at a very off hour hoping to avoid crowds and we successfully did this. The staff was attentive and friendly and we never had to remind them for refills or to clear our plates. The line is kept very clean, which is a must when I visit buffets. They don't have a lot of selection and it's kind of difficult to find some things since everything is spread our so far apart. They take minimalist design to the max. They only have 4 or five dishes to choose from for each type of food, which is a little bit of a letdown. Buffets should be all about selection and they don't have a lot of choices.   The food was standard. Nothing amazing, but there were a few standouts. I did enjoy the salad bar. They allow you to pick all the ingredients you want and they mix them for you. That was probably my favorite part of the meal. The desserts were limited as well. I ended up with macaroons. They were very good. Warm and chewy, definitely another highlight of the evening.  I have to note that our beers were overly carbonated and both my fella and I couldn't even finish half of our glasses. It was Bud Light, which was expected, but it was so bubbly it tasted awful.   For the price, we didn't feel ripped off, but we definitely won't be going out of our way to return. Overall, we had a pleasant experience, but it's not one of the better buffets on the strip by any stretch of the imagination. The food is really two star, but the service bumped it up to three star for me.",

I had fried shrimp, crab legs, muscles, and 2 hearty helpings of prime rib because it was so yummy!! There is a good amount of food here and the place is clean. Everything I tried was yummy, except for the wonton soup - that was nothing special. Service was prompt and good. There was also a good selection of dessert and I was too full to try it all. What I didn't like was at the dessert, some of the signs just say \"assorted\"... as if I know what that includes!!! Anyways, I guess that's why it's a buffet and you can try it all anyways! LOL. They also have gelato here. Seems like most buffets have gelato now... much better than ice cream or worst, soft serve!!!  This buffet is worth trying!! I wasn't disapointed at all!",

    "text": "Came here with my buddies for dinner on a Saturday night.  Went to get the \"coupon\" from Tix4Tonight before coming here.  Paid $2 each person for the coupon and went straight to Cravings around 7:45p-8pm (Saturday night).  Surprisingly, there was NO LINE! We were quickly seated by the friendly staff.  We paid $25 ea at the restaurant ($27 ea after the coupon).    This buffet had the normal range of choices including salad, soups, sushi, pizza, carving station, snow crab legs (hot and cold), etc.  They also had the Coke Freestyle machines so you can choose what soda combination you want.  Also included in the price was unlimited beer and wine (beer selection was limited to Bud Light or Blue Moon and their own wine selection).    To start off, I got some sushi, but was a little disappointed with the lack of selection.  There was not the usual assortment of nigiri and only had what I believe was yellowtail.  No salmon or tuna.  Taste was alright, not the greatest, but not the worse.    My first cut of prime rib was well done and did not taste that great at all, but I ended up eating it anyway.  Gave it another shot when one of my buddies got a cut that had some red to it.  That piece was a lot better!  He gave me the smallest sliver, which I took because I was getting full, but the person behind me asked for a thick piece and was given one.    I went back for 2-3 plates of snow crab legs, as I always do, which was good, but not at the level of Bacchanal.  The legs were smaller and didn't have as much meat in them as some strip buffets, but tasted fine.    They had a pretty good selection of dessert ranging from cakes to ice cream/frozen yogurt which was pretty good!  Only got the froyo and got some toppings as well.  Overall, it was a decent experience.  Not the best, but definitely not the worse.  We will likely be back to give it another shot.  The price with the coupon helped make it a little more worth it!  Next time, I want to try the chef's station that had fresh pasta.",

Just can't this time.  5 1/2 hr drive from LA with TN ( 1st time) guest,  I was selling cravings big time.   Arriving to the  pay  line at 3:05 we were charged for dinner VS lunch; but what was being served was lunch left overs!   I called over the floor manager who called out the chef , who I told of my disappointment with the quality of food VS my prior times here-  telling him it was like being at 2 different restaurants.   He quickly had the crew change out some of the entrees but it was to late - 2 hrs later and I conclude Cravings is no more the quality buffet it once was.  Food lacked flavor.  Trust me, I really wanted it to be good.   I'm embarrassed I sold it so high to my guest.",

Warm drawn butter and a slice of prime rib made it worth the dollar. There was plenty of shrimp and salmon and other meats at the carving station. Fresh rolls. Gray beverage selection.We also enjoyed a few sushi rolls and dessert. The salad bar looked great and they had a variety of Asian and Hispanic dishes which to me looked uninviting. The American food looked gross (man n cheese and corn and such ) and I avoided it. The desserts were pretty but a bit flavorless and not s tremendous selection.",

We got there around 9:30 and there was no line for a Monday morning.  The inside of Cravings felt a little stuffy as it seemed like it was in the middle of the casino floor.  The decor was definitely a no fuss but that did not matter so much to me since all I wanted to do was eat food.  There was an omelet station, which was provided ready made omelets.  The guy who was making them was fast and quick and it tasted really good.  However, I did not really enjoy anything else.  The potatoes and eggs did not taste fresh and felt that it was sitting out.  Instead of trying another food item, I just got another omelet and paired it with some fresh fruit.    I also saw the dessert area, which was surprisingly pretty big.  I tried a cookie from there and it was pretty tasty.  Overall, I think that the buffet's food is 2 stars, but I upped one star for omelet and the dessert area.",

I will bring your silverware. Really???  Servers don't even serve you drinks.  So I went and got our drinks.  They had about 6 soda fountain machines that only thing was available was lemonade and no ice on any of the machines.  two were completely out of order.  Stood in line where you can get beer and wine for about 10 minutes just to get a soda.  I sat down and my husband's plate looked horrible.  Well done prime rib and crab legs that you couldn't even crack open.  After that I went and got my food..  Mashed potatoes a piece of well done prime rib and dry Rigatoni.  The best thing they had was the bread pudding.  Needless to say after seeing Terry Fator's show which was awesome we went to Del Taco.  All this was 65.00 for the buffet plus tip.  We were so disgusted, wish we would of just asked for our money back before we ate and left.",

That being said, we opted to try the buffet here because we didn't want to wait in a 1-2 hour line at the Wynn.   I had been here only once before, about 6 years ago, and since then, they changed a lot.. from what I remember, anyway. We came around 7 and had to wait maybe 20 minutes to get seated. I liked how everything was spread out, so it was really easy to get what you wanted, and move on. The rice pilaf was really good, along with their meat. My friend and I thought it was awesome that they had a panini and gyro guy who would make you one to order. I immediately decided on a turkey and cheese panini. After waiting about 5 minutes for someone to come help us, a man who barely spoke english grumbled that we get what he makes us, and put together a sloppy-looking panini with ham, cheese, onion, and some pesto. After all of the hassle it took to get one, the sandwich didn't taste all that great. Their spinach-artichoke dip was also not a winner with us. Too much spinach, not enough flavor. You really do get what you pay for, so I wasn't expecting too much out of it. Can't say I was really surprised.",

One of my biggest problems with buffets is the fresh-ness/quality of the food, and that didn't seem to be a big issue here.  I also liked their selection of gelato and desserts.  Gelato for brunch, mmm!  **** update 3/27/08 This time Cravings was even cheaper!  I think the key is to come around 10:30, because there's no line then and you get in for breakfast prices ($15) but you can stay into \"lunch\" (prices change at 11 I think).  Again, very satisfied with my meal.  They had fried plantains, and they do Asian food better than any buffet I've been to (which isn't saying that much, but is saying something).",

Having been here before on previous stays, I decided to try out lunch this time around, but I was less than impressed.   Highlights: shrimp cocktail, stir fry items, noodles & hot food, cold salads  Lowlights: Dessert selection - no ice cream of any kind, lame! All they had were funky looking pastry type items. Also, snow crab tasted weird...  For $20, I can't really complain given all the options, but I think there are better quality buffets around. The breakfast buffet here was definitely better, so I'd probably stick with that next time.",

The variety of choices is huge (they have Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Mexican, and American), but they only have about 4-5 items of each food ethnicity. The shrimp cocktails and king crab legs are of decent size and taste fresh. The prime rib is a notch better than your average buffet. The dessert section is limited, but the taste quality is high. I suggest saving room for the gelato ice cream and many of the pastries. Service was good.   However, with many other Las Vegas buffets still left to try, I would only eat here again with free dining credit.",

I guess different place have different prices - Craving was only $15 for the brunch.   Since they stop serving breakfast at 11AM go there a quarter till because by 11AM they whip out the lunch special. I think they have different pricing for lunch... not too sure though.  The lay out of the place was cumbersome. Although they have good intensions I think the location of each section of the food made it difficult to grab the food.   The service was ok. Nothing to spectacular. They just refilled our drinks and took our dirty plates away.",

My first course is always jook porridge with LOTS OF KIMCHI!  They have a variety, but not such an expansive variety.  Hands down, Bellagio has a better dessert selection, but after a whole plate of shrimp, jook, there is no space for dessert anywaz.  They also make a lot of food in front of you like crepes, paninis, and other foods.  Whenever I go to Vegas, I must go to CRAVINGS.......Me LIKEEE!",

    "text": "Las Vegas a city filled with so many options when it comes to entertainment and food. It's not surprising that sometimes the mediocre outnumber the quality; however, if you're lucky enough you can find those diamonds in the rough. Cravings Buffet is luckily one of them.   WHAT? WHY?!  You might be wondering why I would choose such a poorly rated buffet as a possible diamond in Las Vegas. Well, there are several reasons for this.   1. If you go to one of those Tix 4 Tonight kiosks you can actually get discounted pricing to eat at this buffet. Now, it might not be a huge discount but for 20% to 30% off on your dining, especially at a buffet, it's a good deal.   2. Additionally, if you decide to take advantage of the Buffet of Buffets which is the 24 hour buffet pass for any Caesars' owned buffet this is one of those restaurants you'll want to visit.  3. If for nothing else the carving station here has some wonderful meats. I'm talking about tri tip, prime rib, and brisket. These aren't novel in any way compared to what you can find at other buffets but from my experience I noticed that the quality was much higher than many other buffets that you find of this rating and tier. For this reason alone you can sustain yourself and rationalize spending $20-$25 at this buffet.  Conclusion  People will always rave and talk about how wonderful the buffets like Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon are but when you can find True quality in the lower rated buffets, that's when you feel like you found real value. Cravings is one of those buffets found in The Mirage, a beautiful hotel and casino even to this day. Check out the brisket and after a happy meal, thank me later.",

There's not much at the Latin or dessert stations either in my opinion. I've been to a buffet at a smaller casino in Oklahoma that I considered better than this and it's about $10 cheaper.   If you're only wanting to spend about $30 for a buffet and you're okay with average quality food with a fair variety then this is the place for you.

We pay for our Buffett and then the hostess wanted us to sit in the middle of the eating area where there is the most traffic.   We asked if we could sit at another table with less traffic or maybe a booth.   The hostess caught an attitude with us real quick and said oh you're going to have to wait.   Then when we were seated the waitress ignored us so bad that i had to ask for napkins.   Clearly our waitress is doing this out of spite because the tables on the left and right of us are being serviced with a smile.  It's disappointing that when i ask for napkins and I see  you cleaning tables with dirty plates and you hand me napkins yeah that's a no for me.",

During our recent trip, we were pleasantly surprised and impressed with both the quality and selection here.   I like the stations that are split into cuisines and the price is a bit more than average, but the food quality is also. Little things like artisan cheeses and seasonal frozen yogurt flavors like peach sorbet and eggnog were a nice touch.  The chef was really nice and accommodating to my wife making her special requests. The line was a bit long to get in, but that's because it's one of the few buffets that honors MyVegas rewards during the holidays.   We didn't stay here and traveling anywhere along the strip is tough, but this was a worthwhile visit for us! We'll be back!",

There is not an extensive selection, but it is comrehensive.  The sushi was very good, and I was pleasantly surprised to say so - since that often isn't the case at a buffet.  The staff were very helpful, my mother-in-law was riding a power scooter during our visit and our hostess parked it out of the way for us, and told us that she would bring it right back to the table when we were done.  I ended up doing that myself, but it was nice to have the option.  There is free beer and wine - but not being a big drinker myself I stuck to the unlimited soda, which is served from those great \"select your own mix\" machines that I've seen in many places now.    I heard some people say there wasn't a large variety and selection for dessert, but I managed to fill up a whole plate with different items so I'm not sure what they are talking about.  Maybe they are pickier than I am.  Overall - good food, good service, good price, will probably eat here again.",

Beef rib was tasteless and not well cooked - what a waste for such a big chunk of meat. Wonton soup was full of msg so good luck with your stomach 2 hours after you drink it.",

The serving layout has changed since my last visit. The area at the far wall where the seafood selections were located next to the bar has been replaced with more dining tables. This means to get from one side of the serving area to the other, you must now carry your plate through the dining area and thread your way through the tables to reach the other side. That's OK unless you've had a few drinks in the casino before your meal.  Speaking of drinks, our server refused to take our drink orders for wine. So what's the purpose of placing a drink menu on the table? We didn't find out until after the meal wine and beer are included with the price of the buffet. Oops. There goes your tip.  As usual, people keep saying how good the \"King Crab\" legs are. I want to tell those here on Yelp who keep posting \"Yeah, King Crab!\" pics, those are snow crabs. You know who you are. They were sliced in half, dry and had no flavor. I've had better in California casino buffets.  If you are staying in the hotel and are tired of walking, and just want an average meal, try Cravings. But if you want a quality buffet meal, go over to Bellagio or Wynn.",

It literally took more than 10 minutes for her to take care of the 6 people  before us. After that, we were excited about the flavorful food that awaited for us. Well we are still waiting 48 hours later. For almost $70 for 2, one would have thought that they had some real interesting food. Another disappointment! The seafood was just ok, the American food was bad, the Italian food was sub-par, the Asian food was ok, the carving station was a joke. No ham, the prime rib was ok but was not a 'steak' cut it was close to wafer thin, i think the guy carving thought he was paying for the prime rib as he practically shaved that piece of meat.  Not a good selection of food for a Thursday night. Found nothing that was spectacular and tasty. Their 'big' idea of adding unlimited beer and wine was a joke. 3 low end wines and the choice of beer was Bud Light on tap and an IPA.  No wonder it was unlimited. The best thing about this buffet was that the person picking up the dishes was nice and pleasant. The hostess was mad and had no personalty (in fact) she should be fired for having a poor attitude, she said nothing when she showed us our table. No orientation to getting our own self service drinks, no pointing out where to get the plates, no nothing, just someone who didn't want to be working and she was definitely in the wrong position.  The bottom line is. If you want to overpay for food that is cold and tasteless, you found the right buffet.",

So many guests with rewards kept coming in that none of the regular guests (my family and I) were getting transferred to the line to get seated. Yes there is 2 lines, 1 to actually pay, and then 1 to get seated. It was so frustrating because no one was controlling the intake of the rewards guests so they kept coming in by the herds! So unfair to everyone else. The overall decor and layout of this buffet needs to be severely updated. Nothing had that \"Wow\" effect like Vegas buffets should have. You had your usual Italian, Asian, American, Salad, etc. stations. There was a lot to choose from but the food was so bland or just down right gross. This is one of the cheaper buffets at around 30 bucks after my AAA discount and the quality of the food definitely showcased the mediocrity of the buffet. Steer clear and go splurge on The Wynn buffet or Caesar's Palace to get that True Vegas buffet experience!",

    "text": "I'm surprised that majority of the ratings are 4 stars. My guesses are depending on your palate of what you like to eat rather than quality etc. Next is depending on the day you go they may serve better things, lets say the weekend. I came here on a weekday for dinner and i didn't each much because nothing seems good to me. I go to Vegas quite often and pretty much tried 90% of all the buffets in Vegas. Not embarrassed to say, people don't call me a buffet queen for nothing you know. So I am comparing them to each other. Here is a few things in a nutshell:  The Chimichurri sauce was extremely spicy without warning. Although I guess its my fault for not catching all the chilli flakes that were in there but it would have been a nice courtesy to put that on a menu card. (minus-1/2 star) The biscuits were hard and cold as if it may injure someone if I threw it across the room. I even questioned if it was suppose to be for display only and I grabbed it by accident since they were cold. (minus-1/2 star) The presentations of the food were ok not great. For a place that big, I would have thought there were a lot of varieties but there wasn't. The seafood are not as fresh as many other buffets I have had in Vegas. The desserts were good but again not great. They had macarons which I love but they were thrown all over the place on a dish. Some fell off to the table and some were pretty broken up pieces that shouldn't be placed there anymore. (minus 1-star)  In a way, I kind of like how we can grab our own drinks at the beverage bar yet I also see it as part of a service. So you can be the judge of what floats your boat. The service was great though as the server looked at my receipt while I was getting my food first and when I returned he greeted us my our last names. Very professional. They were friendly and grabs my old plates away pretty quickly. There were ice cream but the person that scoops it was not there. I stood there for almost 5 minutes before she came out from the kitchen. First time this ever happened in Vegas. Don't they have coverage should she need to walk away for a minute?  Cost: for about $30/dinner, I have had much better and more variety of selections.  I understand maybe its because the beer and wine are unlimited but think the customer should have a choice to opt out and not pay for that portion if they don't want to drink any alcohol there. (minus-1 star)  So overall, this place is descent but seriously for the price you pay, I wouldn't eat there again as I had much better elsewhere for a fraction of the cost.

The buffet wasn't even that big and if you dont like seafood there's really not much for you. My advice: spend your money on a more upscale vegas buffet. The bowls where you get the frozen yogurt were also dirty. My boyfriend had to literally wipe the dirt away and after grabbing about 4 bowls we finally found a clean one.",

The food runs the selection from salads and cold sandwiches to Chinese Bao (Steamed buns) to French duck and even American BBQ. Quality is high for any buffet...and the layout doesn't make you feel like a part of the buffet, but lets you enjoy it. Get your buffet on!",

The crab was split and hot, sweet and fresh.  ate till I couldn't eat any more.  just some of the highlights were:   The pork loin with chimichurri sauce was excellent, my husband said the salmon was moist and very flavorful. Many of the other items were good as well.    the deserts were heavenly and I'm a desert expert as far as buffets go.  Bacchanel is our top buffet but this is very good without the long waits.

My husband, a veteran of Vegas buffets, said the  buffet was lacking in the quantity of offerings (among other things). He said he assumed this would be the Vegas buffet he's come to expect so he didn't walk it beforehand. He said it was the worst buffet he's had in 40 years of going to Vegas buffets. The rest of the family, Vegas buffet newbies, thought there were plenty of offerings but the quality was sorely lacking. None of us thought the food tasted good and we tried every station. Since we'd been saving our appetite for the buffet, you can imagine our disappointment. You know it's bad when you are cheering the fact frozen yogurt was available for dessert and at least it tasted good. Would definitely not recommend the dinner buffet at Cravings in The Mirage.",

My boyfriend and I got our $30 worth of food in. The shrimp made me a bit nervous to eat, so I didn't really touch the seafood area. My boyfriend ate the shrimp, and he was just fine. But, seafood makes me kinda nervous at buffets. Lol. Lots of varieties to drink! Good desserts. The coconut macaroons were pretty much rock solid. If you have fillings, I would not recommend eating them! There is a lot of food to choose from! If you want to eat here, come hungry! ;)",

Everything is separated into categories.  The food is labeled very clearly.  And they have many gluten free options which are also clearly labeled (a big relief to my wife).  Crab legs with the shells split and ready to eat.  Breakfast burritos with tomatillo salsa, eggs benny, carved meats, omelettes made to order, biscuits and gravy, a HUGE dessert selection of bite-sized beauties, and FREE BEER, WINE & MIMOSAS! If your idea of a good time is eating many courses of different foods over an extended period of time, you'll love it here.    The weak points are:   The mimosas are made with the cheapest sparkling wine possible (to be expected, I guess).   The wine I'm sure is of equal quality, but we didn't bother anyway. The salad bar is small and lacking in choices.  I'm probably the only who goes for salad at a $40 buffet, but there it is.",

For $2 you get a voucher that ends up saving you something like 1/3 - 1/2 of your bill ~$10 off.   Overall this was definitely a decent buffet for the strip. Everything was decent quality, but don't expect that to be synonymous with authentic.   For example, the sushi. First, woo hoo, there's sushi!! But I'm not even sure how you physically pack rice so tightly. Biting into the rice of nigiri was like biting into a sausage.   Some of the pasta from the italian station also tasted like the marina sauce came from a can.   But beyond a couple dishes, mostly everything was in the 3.5 stars and above range. There was also a fairly large variety of dishes to choose from.   It seems that cravings is willing to spend the money on decent food, and they include beer and wine. I think their focus should be on now improving the authenticity of cuisine and maybe even going beyond to offer drinks like thai ice tea and a wider variety of desserts like crepes or sticky rice with mango.   That would definitely get cravings noticed and differentiate them the rest on the strip.",

They have a self-serve beverage station and I think I'd much rather prefer to help myself to drinks rather than having to wait around for someone to refill mine.  Unfortunately Cravings' shortcoming is their lack of selection. After my second plate, I found myself going back to what I liked the first time. Not all of the stations were attended to and some of the staff behind the different stations weren't exactly rude, but they weren't all that nice either.  If you absolutely need to finish off your meal with sweets, then you should definitely check out their desserts. I'm not a big fan of dessert especially at buffets because they're usually stale. However, I found myself eating macaroons one after another.  You can't really go wrong with Cravings. It's low key and cheap. $23 gets you all the food you can eat plus unlimited beer and wine!",

From reading the other reviews, I was thinking this was gonna be avg/or a little better.  At $32 per person (3), i feel robbed.  The 2 stars are for one the friendly staff the other because it was pretty clean. (Then again, the food is unimpressive which leads to less customers which in turn means less mess) My suggestion, not Cravings, I saw an In N Out across the freeway.  For such a beautiful hotel (the Mirage), this is a bad start to the evening.  I hope this doesn't affect my feelings about the show we're going see here later. I cannot get over how let down I feel.  The Indian Casinos in San Diego are 5 stars in comparison. From decor to size to selections and food (taste in particular) this place doesn't measure up.  I know what happens in Vegas is suppose to stay in Vegas, I got robbed here so I'm telling the web.  I'm a big guy at a buffet and I only had a plate of food, like the serving size my doctor suggests i have 3 times a day, the food was so cold, stale and salty that that one plate is all I had. AT A BUFFET?!? FOR $32! ONE PLATE?? What does it tell you when the only 2nd serving I had was a soft drink?  To recap my experience at Cravings at the Mirage: selection-Bad, food-bad, staff-friendly&helpful and the place appeared clean.  Hope your experiences in Vegas are better than this one.",

    "text": "It was better than the buffett at Caesars. You have two choices of crab legs, cold or warm. Big difference in flavor. They have a chefs station to get pasta cooked while you watch. An Italian section with delicious selections. A carving station with rib eye, sausage and turkey. Turkey was a little dry. A seafood session with shrimp, crabs, and ciopinno. A Latin section with southern  American flavors. And American station with bbq and Mac and cheese. An Asian section with sushi and soups and seaweed salad. Have a salad made or create your own charcuterie plate. Plus they have a great desert section on the side with so much sweets that I got a cavity just by looking around. My tooth throbbed. I ate some anyway. And had some sorbet. Stuffed when I waddled out. Almost asked for a wheelchair.",

They did have a grilled cauliflower that was yummy. And the pizza was great but not worth $30. Nathan said the prime rib and ribs were yummy and went back for seconds. Of course his last meal was chicken nuggets at noon at the airport.   Honestly there was no food here that I liked. The soups are weird colors and look canned and sitting way too long. The sushi was horrible. Dried out. Don't make so much if folks aren't eating it. The pot stickers were greasy. The vegetable spring roll was mostly roll with a few slivers of cabbage and on of carrot.  The potato augratin which is usually hard to pass up couldn't be cut up with a fork.  Overall YUCK!!!  Save your money.",

First note, for $2 at one of the discount Tix for Tonight stands that are everywhere on the Strip, you can get a voucher to get the buffet for $11.99 if you go before 3 PM; results in about $10 of savings.  You probably won't get a better price on food and all-you-can-drink in Vegas.  The food was delicious and hot.  There were not a ton of breakfast options (just as a heads up) though the omelette station were you can get it made-to-order was great.  The bar includes Bud Light, Goose Island IPA, and table wine options of Chardonnay, White Zin, Moscato, and a Cabernet.  My particular favorites included the omelette, the chicken tortilla soup, and the sushi; strange mix but it's a buffet!  My boyfriend enjoyed his prime rib from the carving station and got seconds of that.",

We came here for dinner on a Saturday night and we were seated right away.  My first impression with this place was that it is very expensive. I believe it was almost $40 a person. I thought the food selection was going to have some good specials and options for that price. Boy was I wrong...I was very disappointed as soon as I walked around and realized that there isn't anything special. In fact, everything they served there you could get at any buffet for more than half the price. The seafood selection was lacking many things that you would normally expect for a $40.00 buffet. There were no crab legs and they had very little shrimp entrees to choose from. On top of that, everything here tasted just okay. Definitely not worth the price!  The only thing that was good about this buffet was the fact that they had so many different types of food to chose from. Also, they did have a lot of selection, but nothing special at all. I will definitely not come back here in my future visit to Vegas and I do not recommend this place to anyone, unless they have different rates for lunch.",

Drinks ran low, also they were stingy on the napkins. Seriously for $29.99 I expected a lot better.   0/5 Food: Wish I had good comments to say about the food but no. The food lacked flavor and the meat cuts has a lot of fat or they were over salted. The seafood section lacked everything. You could tell the grab legs were very thin, dry, and just tasted rubbery. They had small little shot glasses of different shrimps like, shrimp cocktail, shrimp cevice, nothing tasted $29.99.  0/5 Price: $29.99 + tax + gratuity. They must know their buffet sucks because they charge you gratuity at the door. This place is definitely NOT WORTH IT.    2/5 Desert: The desert area was very modern and cute probably the only thing good about this place is that it had Gelato and a good amount of variety of choices.   0/5 Ambiance: I felt this buffet was rather small, and definitely not worth it. For 29.99 Dinner I expected a lot more varieties of foods from different cultures but this buffet lacked everything. It was DIRTY, flies were flying around my table as we dined. Very annoying and disgusting. How does a fly get in a casino anyways?",

Overall our verdict was that none of them were that good, with the exception of Paris' brunch being \"OK.\"   Due to our experience with those places, I assumed that Cravings would be more of the same mediocrity, but because I had two comped passes I had to at least give it a shot. I was impressed to say the least!  The Prime Rib was excellent, they had good beer on tap (Goose Island IPA), options were plentiful and everything was pretty good. I'd take this over Bellagio Buffet any day.",

ALOT!!! reluctantly, i agreed and we headed over to the mirage for no particular reason at all. it was around  3pm on a wednesday and they were not super busy, but steady... the host and server were pleasant and the food was great! i have a cpl specific allergies i was asking our server about and since she wasnt sure she said shed go ask...what stood out to me though, on our visit, was that two of the chefs came out, introduced themselves, answered all my questions and if they could get us anything!?!? WHAAT!?! how awesome is this???!! they made it a personal experience, made small talk and we walked out of there satisfied... in this world where everyone is so busy and into what theyre into, it really says something about someones integrity when they genuinely care!! just want to make a shout out to: chef Jose Cruz and chef Douglas Oyama!!! they are two cool mofos and w/o a doubt, will be back to their buffet!!!",

Everything else was disgusting, tasteless, bland, flavorless and just down right gross. I only tried this place because it was part of the runner perks for the Rock and Roll marathons, so it wasn't a first choice for buffet. Now I know where to NOT go. The \"waiters\" are not even waiters, they are just busboys. You have to grab your own drink, they don't even bring it for you, including sodas, teas, beer and drinks at the bar, you get yourself. All they do is pick up your plates. So basically its not too much service on their end. It's sad because there alot of food here, but they are all horrible. Pick another place!!!",

It was clean and they refilled all of the food regularly. The selection of desserts was good, and the chocolate bread pudding was one of the best things I ate that night.   We arrived a bit early for dinner, being a little jet-lagged from coming in from the east coast, but there was a line when we left around 7, but it seemed to be moving through pretty well. I expect it would be worse later.   Overall, a pretty good value for your dollar.",

I went to brunch with my ladies for my best friend's birthday and we chose to come here as our location, since we received a credit from the hotel. What sold us what the bottomless mimosas. Everyone knows you can't have brunch without mimosas and, wow, did those mimosas keep coming. Whenever our glass was almost empty, Brandon, one of the waiters, made sure to refill our glasses. He was so attentive to our table and we really appreciate it.  I happened to get some fried rice from the Asian cuisine station, after I had enough breakfast food, and noticed that the rice wasn't fresh. All the other food was so delicious and I didn't want that one thing to be ruined. So I told Brandon that the rice didn't taste right and without me knowing that he was even going to do anything about it, I'm greeted 15 minutes later by Fausto Vela, the Asst. Main Kitchen-Chef, with a huge fresh plate of fried rice for my ladies and I. He said \"I hope this is to your liking and if it isn't then we'll make it again.\" Trust me, it was SOOO SCRUMPTIOUS! So tasty. I was extremely thankful and when I'm in Vegas again I'll be sure to visit and thank them for such a wonderful experience.",

I am surprised I didn't break my teeth on the garlic bread here or macarons. Pretty much, some stuff were super cold and old and they just leave it there... they need to do a better job of switching stuff out.  However, they have goose island ipa, a solid cab, chard and a solid dessert zinfadel. I hate to admit but the drinks here outrank the food. Compared to the above listed buffets, the desserts here were just miserable. Nothing tasted amazing. If not for my buy one get one free, I would never try this buffet.

The food, first of all, was HORRIBLE.  For the price of almost $30, I've never been to a buffet more terrible than this one.  Basically, it's an International Buffet with foods: Chinese, Japanese, Latin, Italian, BBQ/roasted meats, seafoods... and of course all-you-can-drink beer, wine and non-alcoholic stuff.  The crab legs were tasteless, sushi rolls were unimpressive (rice was too hard), their Chinese food consisted mostly of North Americanized creations.  At the Italian stations, their food was lukewarm.   I've walked around the buffet many many circles to find things I'd like to eat but unfortunately didn't have too many things on my plate.  Besides the dessert station which was okay, their food selection, variety and quality was inadequate.  When tasting the food, it just doesn't taste fresh and we were both really really disappointed.",

The omelet bar offers made to order omelets and eggs with a variety of filling choices, which we both opted for bacon and cheese and were cooked perfectly. There are a lot of different choices, which is great if your with a group or a picky eater, everything from pizza, Mexican to Asian cuisine and sushi. I only wish we more hungry when we came here.",

I think this place is amazing its clean the staff is friendly . People this is a buffet PLEASE stop writing ridiculous demands. My humble opinion is you get your hard earned moneys worth. The food is beautifully made again its buffet is fresh warm the pizzas are tasty the Asian food is great too burger sliders just so delicious. Meats aren't dry. Gelato red velvet cake cookies  cupcakes that are just so cute and great tasting. Great salad bar. For about 20 dollars plus tax you can enjoy all this . People please don't complain about prices you are better off eating here for about 22 dollars (they DO have military discount) than going off some food court. I paid 16 dollars for a slice of pizza and a drink thinking I was saving money . No way ! To wrap this review up ... It's a clean fresh economic and beautiful place to sit down and eat please try .",

    "text": "I have read most of the reviews here and these people all have their taste in the cigarette butt they left in their beer can last night( or this morning).  The service was attentive and my champagne must have been refilled 7  or 8 times, plus Sharon brought us two huge cups to go, which would have been worth the $35 tab alone. But besides that, the breakfast buffet included chilled crab legs and shrimp, sushi, ceviche, noodles, chilled seafood salads, prime rib, veal bacon, smoked chicken wings, ribs, short ribs, crab cake Benedict, Bananas Foster french toast, tons of fresh fruit, Caribbean seafood stew, gelato in numerous flavors, smoked salmon and gravlax, shiu mai and pho, plus scrambled eggs and pancakes if you want to waste your time on them.  My advice is to walk the entire line to determine what you would like to eat before you begin filling your plate.  There is also a cooked-to-order egg station, but why eat eggs when you can have prime rib an crab legs?",

The selection contained both breakfast and main meal items...The spring rolls, pizza, mex wraps, waffles, thai salads and dessets were all excellent. In drinks, they served champagne, lemonade, orange juice etc. Overall, we enjoyed the lunch.",

Shrimp appetizer was very good as well.  didnt want to take a risk on ceviche because of large amount of liquor going into body later that night.  Tuna sushi was pretty tasty.  Crab legs were just ok.  Prime Rib was very very good.  other sides were pretty tasty as well.  Deserts were ok, but im not a desert guy.  Unlimited beers was a good pre-game to the night as well.  Next time im in Vegas I will be going back",

Its weakness is that while some of the food is quite good, some is not.  Nice thing about a buffet, is you can just stop eating anything that turns out to be not so great and go get something else.  Standouts according to family poll on this trip were cold and hot jumbo shrimp, coleslaw, cornbread, Italian chicken stew, bok choy, carne asada, flan, and chocolate mousse cake.",

Let's start with the positives: the buffet was clean, circling around the tables in the eating area, and separated into a large variety of different cuisines. The prime rib and pastas were mediocre, and the gelato was yummy. That was about as far as the positives went. The bread (or is it?) was hard and crumbled into flakes when I took a bite. The sushi (or their attempt at one) was hard, so it was futile to even use a fork to pick it up. Our server was inattentive and seemed annoyed when we had to ask for drink refills. Now I know the lines outside better buffets are there for a reason; there was no line at Cravings and the tables were mostly empty on the Friday evening we went.",

    "text": "The weekday dinner price is $29.99. The line is very short at 7:00pm.  I used to come here before this place got remodeled so I expect it must be better after remodeling.  The first thing I know is I have to get my own drink which is the other end where I sit.  No server for drink like before.  Only bus boys to take your dishes.  Be prepared if you have small children and you have to serve them drinks.  The Asian food section is more than half empty.   For over one hour I kept checking on BBQ Pork Bun and Seafood bun but they did not get refill.  The chef was very busy with his wok.  Every section has only one chef so the refill is very slow.  The wonton and noodle is ready to serve in the pot.  It used to be prepared by the chef for your order so it's very fresh.  The American food section offers like five items but no fries.  BBQ ribs is hard and dry.  The corn is very good.  I got to say the only good item I like is corn that night.  Buffalo wing is ok but very spicy.  The Carving section offers very well done prime rib so I came back later for a medium slice.  The well done part is falling apart so I hear the other guests asked if it was pull pork.  Prime rib has no taste.  I cannot taste the spices from the rub at all.  Seafood section offers crab legs and cocktail shrimp.  Salad bar and cold item have a good selection.  They also have the Latino food section.  Beside pizzas there is Chef's Kitchen for Italian food but I found no menu for you to order which dishes you want.  I saw the pasta dish that the chef was cooking.  It came in big portion that I'm sure I cannot finish that.  There are vanilla yogurt, chocolate yogurt, raspberry sorbet and peach sorbet at Gelato section.   The dessert section needs to get updated on the menu and the decor.  The watermelon is cut with dice shape so they get smashed up with the serving spoon.  The watermelon should be sliced and use tongs to serve.  It should not be an issue to get drinks if you do not have children or sitting too far from the soda station.  For the same price, you can go to other buffet like Aria that offers more variety of foods, dessert and gelato and has server.  I noticed that not a lot people left tips for the bus boy who cleared the heavy dishes but I tipped him anyway for his hard work.  For the variety and quality of food and speed of refilling food, I would not recommend to others.",

We were then seated next to the glass wall where hungry people who had been waiting for over an hour pressed their noses to the glass, watching us eat our meal.  They didn't have enough staff and the place was a mess with dishes stacked on unoccupied tables. The snow crab legs were puny and hard to eat, and the steamed clams were all closed, meaning that they were low quality or dead when they were steamed.  The turkey was dry.   A few of the servers behind the counters had attitudes, and our server complained about how tired she was throughout our meal.  My wine glass (alcohol was an extra charge) was dirty and that wasn't remedied until after I was done eating.  The dim sum bar was good and the sushi rolls were passable.  The gelato was good. This was not a 40 dollar per person experience.  This was a 9.95  per person experienced at best.   Take your money to Fremont Street and have a fabulous gourmet meal in a nice setting at Second Street Grill.",

It was completely dead. Was so happy that our Travelzoo included free beer and wine. Bottom of the barrel taste but that was expected. Could not understand a word our server said (heavy accent). After being disappointed with the fatty dishes I decided to try for the salad. You get to choose the ingredients and they toss it for you. That sounded promising but it was a fail. The lady put way too much of the overpowering ingredients (ie onions) and the salad was ruined. The desserts looked good but they were not. The cheesecake was sugarless and tasteless. The cannoli was not good at all. Even the frosting on the cupcake tasted special. With all of the buffett choices on the strip, this is not a good one. Even with the half off travelzoo deal I would not return to this place. I hear the buffett at the Cosmopolitan is worth checking out so I will do that next time. Oh also the food stations did not have standard dishes as you would expect. Cheese enchiladas at the mexican stand? Nope. Orange chicken or chow mein at the Chinese stand? Nope. So disappointing.",

One star for the overall eating experience - great tasting food, at a good price, with fast and friendly service, in a pleasant roomy atmosphere. All that being said, this is a regular buffet so don't expect caviar and king crab legs, or desserts dipped in gold leaf - go to the Wynn for that.

So when we got there the server greeted us and I let them know I was looking for vegan options and they said they'd send the Chef out. In less than 5 minutes the Chef came out and she took me around the whole buffet to show me what was safe for me to eat at each station! She also told me that if it was not sufficient they'd make me something in the back! But there was quite a few options, I built two nice plates for myself!  Then for dessert there was only sorbet that was vegan so she said she could bring me something out towards the end of my meal. And she brought me the perfect little mini desserts and fruit. It was so good! I'll attach a picture.  Plus they offer unlimited beer and wine.  Which was amazing. I definitely helped myself to a few glasses of delicious red wine! Overall I was extremely happy with my experience, the help and that they took my dietary needs seriously. Thank you!",

    "text": "Compared with everything else in this hotel, Cravings was alright. In True Vegas fashion there is good selection of food but you shouldn't be expecting much out of it.   We were told that wine/beer was unlimited but you have to go to the bar to pick up your drinks. On a Sunday morning there was only one bartender and they seem to be moving purposefully slow. We were also told that you could take a beer to-go after your meal but the bartender said this was not True.  As far as food quality, nothing too memorable off the breakfast or international food menu.",

    "text": "We tried the Cravings Buffet at the Mirage, as it has been over four years since we were last here.  We went at about 6:30PM on Saturday, August 18th.    We were again redeeming a Buy 1, Get 1 Vegas promotion, as we did last visit.    The price for weekend dinner is $32.99, which includes beer and wine.  I believe this price is slightly lower than it was four years ago.  (Buffet wars on the strip?).    We enjoyed our visit here.  Most of the food we found to be average to very good.  The hostess was very nice; however, there is no service in this buffet.  I like when they do have servers who provide beverage service in a buffet, and that does not occur at this location.    Anyway, I would continue to occasionally come back with a promotion; however, I would not come back again at full price for all people in my party.  Also of concern, the ceiling decor was falling apart.  If you look up, you will see lots and lots of duck tape holding pieces of the ceiling decor together.  A little bit concerning perhaps?",

    "text": "Came here on January 2 (a weekday) and was surprised that they were still charging holiday prices for dinner (~$36 + tax/tip), but decided to try it anyway. No line at all @ 8:15 PM.  They have a decent variety of foods and a small selection of unlimited beer & wine (at the bar) included w/ the bill. The atmosphere is bright, and I do appreciate their presentation of the food instead of industrial size metal trays. Drinks are self serve.  PROS: Their made to order pasta station was a standout of the night (possibly because it was actually hot), but I would ask for a smaller portion so you don't fill up on pasta. A sign with a list of ingredients would be nice so I don't have to shout over the stove to the chef. Also loved the caprese salad.  CONS: I do not recommend their sushi (rice was hard and dry), but try it for yourself. Food can definitely be served hotter; it was cold by the time I got to my seat. I was in the mood for soup, but had a hard time finding them as they are scattered all over the restaurant.   Come early for dinner so you don't miss out on any of the foods. Buffet stops seating at 9 PM, but start taking away the food at 9:30 PM. By the time I got to the dessert, all the selections were gone as they were no longer replenishing. Any recommendations for a buffet that opens late??  Our server was attentive and brought us seafood cracking utensils without being asked.   Overall, was a decent buffet experience. Convenient since we were staying at the Mirage, but otherwise probably would've eaten at a different buffet.",

The french toast and cinnamon bread thing was DELICIOUS.  The pizza was ok, the desserts were decent, and the fresh fruit was great!   Unlimited beer and mimosas was definitely a plus!",

Food was disgusting and we were rushed out as they were closing soon. (It was like 8:30) Thought about calling hotel to see if they would comp another buffet for us but I doubt they will. Also asked if I could add it to my M rewards and the lady who wrang us up, wouldn't even give the time to answer my questions. So bad customer service, high price and nasty food. Super disappointed and won't do that again.",

There's a lot of choices but their segmented into different ethnic areas with odd pairings.  The layout is confusing at best.  For example... the eggs, sausage, and hash browns are in one area but the bacon and toast are in a totally different area.  The pizza is horrible, just horrible.  The only good thing I found was the Eggs Benedict.  You can pay and extra $5 for open bar, but watch out for the mimosas... they're awful.   You can experience all this awfulness for the low low price of $35 per person.    I've been to several buffets at different large hotels in Vegas but this one was the worst of the bunch so far.  One of my favorites is the Mandalay Bay Buffet.  It's a little less expensive and the food is MUCH better.",

The only thing I don't understand is that you have to get your own drink. It sounds petty but at the stations they get your drinks while you get your food. It's on the table when be you get back. I feel the Mirage is a nice enough place to provide this service. Its over three times the price. They do have a local discount, that was a nice surprise.",

Not a lot of options for dessert, even if you've found something that looks good, it might be \"sugar-free\". Damn you low carb eaters.

They should charge an additional charge if you want to drink and lower the price of the buffet, not to mention once again the food was quite terrible.

Theres crab, asian, mexican, bbq, pho, and almost anything else your heart desires. This time I brought a friend that is vegan and she was still able to eat like a queen.  The dessert station gets better and better every time we go there. The thing that is a little troublesome is that the plates are always too hot at the dessert station, so all my chocolate melts before I get it to the table. I also think having an Ice Cream station would be super cool too!   Overall though you have to come here, it's not a super fancy buffet.

The Asian area of the buffet lacked quality and flavor. The only desert that was good was the bread pudding and the fresh fruit. The other deserts had no flavor.

I did that and ate everything! Each dish was seasoned and cooked to perfection! We also purchased the all you can drink option and the champagne was flowing freely. Healthy pours refilled continuously without us having to ask/search for a server. Definitely will go back every time I am in Vegas.",

    "text": "I am very impressed about this buffet.  I first like it how it's in Mirage. I have always wanted to eat at this hotel but I was not so sure about their restaurants. However, coming to Cravings made me have no regrets about buffets.   First off, the interior is extremely nice. You are greeted to a wide space where there are two cashiers, one in front of the other, and there you will pay for your meal. The hosts are nice as well. I like how there are more than one hostess in this buffet because they are able to organize where to sit the customers, so it won't be such a big mess when there are many parties waiting for their seat.   The inside of the buffet is wonderful. It has a clean, functional, modern look to it and there are signs of what stations they provide. They provide typical sections such as Chinese, Italian, BBQ, and more. What was really interesting was their salad bar. Someone actually prepares the salad for you the way that you want! I thought that was nice.   The food is pretty okay. The crab legs are a bit salty but it's enough to satisfy those seafood lovers. Their jumbo shrimp really gets the brownie points here. They're big and they're not pilled up, like how they do it at other buffets. They put out enough shrimp for you to get enough on your plate. Plus, they offer other ways of eating shrimp. Their food was not dry and I appreciate that a lot. They make sure their foods are fresh and ready to serve. Even their pizza wasn't as hard as cardboard. It tasted fresh! Their prime rib was excellent and even their Chinese food was easy to manage for someone, like me, who can't stand Chinese food as much as they want to. They have a variety of options in each section so you'll  be able to get enough food for the price you pay. One thing that bothered me as a Korean was that they put Kimchi in the Chinese section. Kimchi is an authentic Korean side dish, not Chinese. I hope they make this correction fast.   Their plating is absolutely AMAZING! I love how they care about every aspect of the buffet from the interior of the restaurant to the plates and silverware they use. The pictures the other Yelpers provide definitely give you a great idea of how the restaurant is and what to expect. It shows that they value their customers and want everyone to feel that they are eating the best of the best in Las Vegas.   Overall, I am a huge fan of this place. I have been to many buffets in Las Vegas and I cannot be any happier about choosing this buffet. You can come here before seeing a show or with your friends before a long night of partying with your friends at the hottest club in Vegas. If there are children part of the party,  come by for their desserts. There are a wide variety of choices from ice cream to cookies and cakes everyone can enjoy. For the parents, a nice sip of coffee will do just right after a delicious meal from many cultures. This is one good stop to go to and there won't be any regrets choosing a buffet instead of a restaurant. There is a reason why this buffet is called \"Cravings\": everything that you are craving for, you can get it here! :)   Bon appetite!",

We were charged dinner prices and not offered the champagne brunch. The breakfast food was cold and like eating at a military base. Cafeteria pancakes and french toast. They had started to turn over to lunch and we sampled other foods to find something decent. Pizza undercooked and similar to what my kids would get at school. Chinese..only 2 dishes both ehh. Many different types of food italian,chinese, sushi,etc but none...none of them done well. We were dumb enough to just walk up and pay. If you don't believe this is crap try it for yourself..just by discounted tickets so you don't get taken as bad as we did..$60 plus for 2",

The atmosphere is pretty much what you expect for a buffet, informal and open and the staff are not as friendly, more robotic when you ask for assistance but they do their part. Don't expect Michelin star restaurant because buffets are never going meet up to that standard! But the food was surprisingly better then buffets I've had in the pass. There was a very good variety and quality for the price you pay.. $27 something per person for lunch/ brunch. Huge prawns and crab legs all peeled and ready to eat, juicy tender roast beef just the way you like it, a wide dessert range to give you a big toothache, just to name a few.. The food really do hit the spot, get your cravings sorted! ;) oh, drinks are included in the price including all the beer and wine you want!! nb: toilets are outside the restaurants, literally next door.",

I ate mostly the crab legs. Prime rib.   They provide a self serve drink area, which I think is good.  You don't have to flag down a staff to get a drink when you want one. We've all been in that situation.   Unlimited alcohol, wines and beer. They have a bar area with one bartender working and a bunch of tv's to watch or get updates on games.   I wouldn't go out of my way, but if I was in Mirage and hungry, I'd eat there if we had another 2-1 coupon. I wouldn't spend full retail price eating there. Other buffets on the strip are better for same price points.",

To our disappointment, the buffet did not live up to our memories of it. Especially since we began our night with the SNOOTIEST front desk cashier. So snooty that I actually looked at her name tag, so beware of SHIRLEY!  Anyway - on to the food: the salmon skin rolls were not very fresh. The prime rib was not as tender(but still relatively good). And my beloved mocha mousse was nowhere to be found (the desserts that were there didn't actually make up for it).  The rest of the displayed dishes were either uninteresting or average. The best thing I remember having here was the Italian Meatball Soup which was excellent. And our waiter was also very good.  Out of the 6 buffets I've been to on the strip I would rate Cravings as #3 MAYBE #4. Behind The Wynn & Rio and possibly tied with the MGM(only had the lunch buffet so tough to compare)",

The price isn't fantastic for brunch (I think it was $26/pp), but the food quality was much better than several of the other buffets (and some of the other dining establishments) I tried during my stay.  Our waiter was fantastic with refilling beverages and taking empty plates, so no complaints there.  The atmosphere is modern and relaxed and tables aren't as cramped together the TI buffet, where I felt like I was almost sharing a table with the people sitting next to me.  Biscuits and gravy and the dessert station are highly recommended if you eat here.  I will probably return for future LV stays.",

The crab legs were so grumbly that once you cracked them open you couldn't get the pieces off of the meat itself and you're picking it out of your mouth. They have all the food divided into types of cuisine ( Mexican, Italian, Asian). All of the food was a half assed effort at what it should have been. The \"Mexican\" was just warmed up nacho cheese out of a can , tortilla chips and some other nonsense. The \"sushi\" just wasn't. The pizza had no flavor. The salad bar lacked the most basic toppings. The dessert section looked like they robbed a Kroger bakery for its day old goods. The buffet was very expensive ($32 a person) so we thought it would be really good but it turns out that you are paying for the \"free\" alcohol included in the buffet. The seating is old and dark and not comfortable. This buffet was more about quantity than quality. It was a sad ending to our trip.",

Also the squash soup, shrimp ceviche, and guacamole were delicious. Minuses were pasta dishes and Chinese noodle dishes; they had sat out so long they looked dried out.

Their idea of Italian food is basically pizza and 2 kinds of pasta, but fine, I understand risotto or ravioli is too much to ask for at a buffet setting. The sushi looked old and stale so I didn't even bother, but the Chinese dim sum stuff was good (in comparison). I liked the prime rib and crab bisque until I realized they used imitation crab. C'mon!

I felt the best they had to offer when we went for the Sunday night dinner was the Lamb Osso Buco,  and flank steak (ONLY if medium, otherwise it'd be too dry).  The other things were a little... off.  The Lamb osso Buco was soft enough that it would just fall off the bone, and it had a good flavor to it- not really gamey.  This went along well with the sauteed buttered wild mushrooms in the italian section of the buffet.  The Flank steak goes well with the port demi (which is alongside the porkloin wrapped in bacon, which didn't taste all that great...)    There was also the Ceviche, which was waaaayy too sour, and not enough spice.  The Cioppino was really salty and super mini-shrimped.  They also had dim sum (which was bland) and sushi (which had meat which didn't look so tasty so I didn't try it).  I don't remember much of the other things because they didn't taste good.  Hands down the best thing from this buffet was the dessert!  Their mini pecan pies and mini lemon meringue were really good.  If after you eat the entrees you feel a little sick, eat the lemon meringue as the tart flavor might help with the nauseating feeling coming from your stomach..  The puddings were scary:  The chocolate one was actually GRAINY!!  And the Pistachio one tasted interesting....",

I felt bad for having a salad at a buffet, but I don't regret it. Their salad was so fresh, you choose all your ingredients, I had to have it. The dessert selection was kind of a bummer, but the ice cream was good. This, for me, was way, way better than the Rio Carnival \"World\" buffet.",

I'm so happy this place is part of myVegas slots. Definitely happy about that, because I can use my points to get buy one, get one free buffet, or if I have enough points, I can get 2 Buffets for FREE here.

I was there a few weeks ago and, just like it was 6-7 months ago when I was there last, the food just wasn't good.

There are plenty of options but all of them are just OK at best with the lone exceptions being the egg/omlette station where they make your stuff to order and the ham from the carving station.  Everything else was just mass produced, blah food.  Picture over cooked eggs (scrambled, Benedict), bland sausage patties, frozen pizza slices...    We did experience some excitement during the meal when an old lady in her electric cart plowed over another woman who was walking near our table.  When the other woman went flying, she took out a couple empty chairs and just missed wiping out my son!  Thankfully, she seemed to be ok although an incident report was being filled out as we left.",

We got free passes by playing My Vegas so we got to avoid the kinda pricey fee of thirty some dollars per person. The hostesses and waiters are all very attentive, friendly, and speedy. Never had any wait at any of the buffet stations, either. Unfortunately, the food can be extremely hit or miss. The pizza and carving sections are both highlights for me. However, the Asian foods were mostly disappointing, and the desserts were pretty standard. Unlimited beer and wine, though. If you can get a discounted or free pass, go check this place out. Otherwise, I wouldn't say it's worth the price of admission.",

There was a pretty good salad bar with some charcuterie and tons of breads.  The unlimited beer/wine was nice, but there was only one craft beer on tap, which was disappointing. However they DID have one, so I can't complain TOO much!  My favorite plate was the roast turkey, mashed potatoes and gravy. I even went back for seconds which is rare at buffets.   The dessert section was very good as well! Of course, we had a wedding cake too so I left COMPLETELY stuffed.   I only awarded 4 stars to Cravings because it wasn't totally awesome, but everyone in the party liked it, no one had any complaints and we would come back again. Keep it up!",

    "text": "Over the past week my wife and I ate three breakfasts and one dinner at Cravings. Perhaps the single most influential reason for us coming back so many times was Marivell the cashier who we purchased our buffet from. She was so friendly and kind. We had a number of different servers and they all had their unique characteristics but Marivell treated us with respect and kindness. One of the nicest people we interacted with during our stay in Vegas.   The four stars is because the cost was high. I know it is not the most expensive buffet but it was pricey to say the least. The first breakfast we paid full price which was $41 (ish) before the gratuity. Dinner was almost double that. After that we were able to use myVegas points to purchase 2-for-1 coupons which made the price more reasonable.   The quality and variety of food was great. So many options and many great tastes. Dinner has even more than breakfast but both have plenty for just about any appetite or desire. Free beer and wine are limitless and included in the price of the buffet. Though I do agree that it is 5 oclock somewhere, I was not up for beer at breakfast though a few others guests were. I did at dinner and also purchased a mixed drink which was made very well. The bartender was nice and much nicer to me since I tipped him rather than demand free beer and grab and dash with it only to return a minute later demanding more still with no tip. That is a gripe on customers not the buffet so I'll leave it at that.   Good food and pretty spot-on service from the servers and excellent customer service from Marivell.",

The \"Asian\" area only had one or two entrees plus the rice and noodles. Only a few types of sushi. The \"Latin\" area was my favorite with tamales, fajitas, some chicken, rice and beans. BUT the rice was awful, like it was from a box. The crab and shrimp was good. I don't eat pasta but it looked decent. The carving station had prime rib and turkey with gravy, potatoes and stuffing, not impressed with the stuffing. I didn't look at the desserts but asked my dad to grab me cheesecake if they had it, he came back with a small piece saying they didn't have many choices for dessert.",

I was suprised that u have to go get soft drink for myself.  It is not worth it for $29.99 even with MyVEGAS redeem gold coins.  I will stop writing now because I have to go get drink for my wife. I am the server myself. Ahhahaha Oh I forgot 1 thing, ask to come inside to take a look before you pay. I recommend please tip good the server because the plates are heavy. You have to go get drink it is not their fault. They set the rules that we have to server drink for ourself.",

Be careful with the breakfast pastries because not all of them are fresh. I picked up a stale Danish and cut into a rock solid eggs benedict, and wasn't too pleased. When I came across the breakfast goodies most suited to my palate, however, my tongue and tummy were SO happy!  The fresh fruit (grapefruit, honeydew melon, cantaloupe, & pineapple) were sinfully juicy and sweet! I breathed a sigh of relief when I saw the fruit selections were not canned or candied. You could tell they were recently cut straight from the fruits.   The French toast was soft, fresh, and full of the delicate flavor of sweet spices--either cinnamon or nutmeg. This tasted elegant when topped with cottage cheese and the delicious strawberry compote at the serving station, which was made with strawberries that had a just-picked flavor and wasn't cloyingly sweet. I didn't grab more of anything else because the combination of quality French toast, cottage cheese, and strawberry compote didn't taste cheap and it felt like I was dining at some elegant breakfast spot!   With a bottomless cup of coffee besides my buffet plate, I'd dine here again any morning.",

I wish they had a separate option for opting out of the unlimited champagne / mimosa pricing. I don't really care to drink during brunch.

Hubby and I decided to heck out the Cravings Buffet in the Mirage Hotel and Casino.  We were quickly seated and off to fend for ourselves.  There is a great selection of food mixed with breakfast which too me is the best of both worlds.  They have your standard breakfast items but my favorite is the omelet station which was made perfect.  The pizza is amazing here too, you can tell that the dough is made from scratch and the sauce is perfect not too sweet not too tart.  The best thing I ate here was the soups, I had a seafood bisque that was hands down one of the best I have ever had.  Very rich and creamy but you could still taste the essence of the seafood.  The Cioppino blew me away and they are not skimpy on the seafood either so definitely give this one a try.",

The food quality is good. 95% of everything I tried, from the pizza to dimsum, were all delicious.   One thing I did not like was their Spicy Tomato Soup.

Besides that one particular item, I liked their food.  Don't forget the extensive dessert selection, tucked in the corner. I think I ate too much of the Creme Brulee because it was SO yummy! Really cute arrangement for the sweets but ice cream flavors could definitely improve. They need more, I think.  Overall, it's a good place for a buffet.

    "text": "Two important contexts to this review. First, this is only for the Cravings breakfast, and the Cravings brunch (had both).  I make no claims to the dinner service. Second, my evaluation is done from a perspective that I am evaluating a buffet.  I don't compare and rate a buffet with fine dining restaurants.  The Mirage breakfast buffet was acceptable, but it would not have been at full price (we were comp'd both times).  The food is typical buffet quality.  Not outstanding and not original.  The options during the breakfast are surprisingly limited.  This is even True at the omelet station where there are a limited number of ingredients.  I walked away full, but felt those who paid full price would have been disappointed.  The brunch has many more options and comes with alcohol, however the price is significantly higher (again, I didn't pay it).  I'd have a hard time justifying the $20 price for the regular breakfast.  If one has transportation, Sunset Station would offer a better buffet at less than half the price.  If you're on the strip and going to pay full price, I think you'd do much better at Cosmo (Wicked Spoon) or Aria.  The one place I felt the buffet might have had a slight edge was in the desserts.  Some very good options there.  If you're comp'd, it's a fine.  If you've got a two-for-one and you're already there, it's okay.  If you're paying full price, go elsewhere.",

    "text": "At one time this was one of.the best buffets in Las Vegas but good things do come to an end.  We recently visited the Cravings buffet on 7/24/17. It was a joke.... $29.99 for dinner which includes alcohol.   The salad bar had greens that looked days old and wilted.  I waited 15 minutes at the  pasta station and the chef never showed up. He was in the back. The Asian food section dishes were nearly empty and lets not even mention latin dishes. Grossssss.  No staff to clean the stations, refill dishes, you have to walk across the restaurant to serve your own drinks and are still tacked with 18% gratuity! For what??? I NEVER once had a waiter come take out plates away?? Save yourself the stomach ache on this place. Visit the Aria if you want a real buffet. I know I will.",

Although my lunch meal was free, I felt that this buffet was alright.  Nothing too special.  The asian dumplings, french toast, and lobster ravioli was pretty good.  Other than that, just a typical buffet.  The Buffet at the Wynn was better and worth my money!",

    "text": "I want to give this five stars but I can't. We stepped into this place at 3pm on a Monday, so that may have something to do with the quality of the food. Regardless, if you're supplying Vegas tourists with a buffet, it should always be good, no matter what the time.   Honestly, I only went here because we were already at the Mirage and I wanted a salad bar salad. I was NOT dissapointed with the salad bar, but I was with the fact that some lady tosses it together for you. She put a paltry amount of lettuce in the bowl but topped it with waaaay too many toppings and too much dressing. I had to ask her to add more lettuce. Good thing I did because even with the extra lettuce there was still too much everything else. Sheesh.   The eggplant parmesan and the pesto pasta were surprisingly good. As good as I have made at home. The cab legs were scary and gross. I put it on my mans plate when he wasn't looking.   The rest of the buffet left something to be desired. Too bad. For nearly $40 for the both of us I was hoping for more. Would I eat here again? Maybe, but I'd only go around the busy times to guarantee a fresher selection of food.   And except for the gelato, the desserts did suck. But they have a nice antipasta bar.",

You go through the normal buffet queue to arrive at your table and I found that everything had changed since my last visit.  They had waiters/waitresses serving tables, but they have basically been reduced to bus persons.  You have to fetch your own coffee, orange juice or alcoholic beverages.  The food was generally acceptable, but no where near where you'd go out of your way to eat there.  Mirage used to have an outstanding buffet, but I would only eat there now if I was staying at the Mirage and frankly you'd be better off going to Bellagio.",

They basically have put normal ice cream in gelato tins, placed them in a gelato bar and call it gelato. It was basically Breyer's ice cream. It was good, but it wasn't gelato at all.

Chaste and clean but not really spotless, It would be a four star but I reserve that for other International buffets like one I had in SoCA, forgotten. I think this ones @ Mirage Hotel and Casino. Its like $25 per head, I usually go to just the Asian/ American food but if I was to choose, I wouldnt come here. Buffet is good once in a while but i like doing ala cartes better. A narrower choice of food menu satisfies me more at the end of the meal.   This place is not for me that night. I was tired-- i couldve settled for a subway and go to bed or start the chillaxing. I eat only to the point im full and not to the point of almost puking just to get your money's worth. My sis loves food and oh how she loves buffet. I guess she splurged with all those desserts.

There were a lot of choices to pick from like a Asian food section, BBQ, Italian, Latino, and a raw section too.  My favorites were the cioppino, sweet potato fries, and their  shrimp.

Oh, did I mention the all-you-can-drink champagne / mimosas to go with it?  Yeah...there's that too.    If you're busy on the floor of the Mirage Casino, and you get the munchies, this really is the place to get your fix.

We have eaten at tons of buffets and the food in general tends to be just so so (with some exceptions). Some dishes are fairly decent but most just alright. What this buffet truly does more poorly than any other here in Vegas is service. We were a large party (16) and of course had to pay 18% gratuity upfront. Ok, fine. Many of the people in our group work in the service industry in restaurants so we expected the upfront tipping. We have been paying this upfront 18% all weekend and have had really great service at the restaurants we have been to. However, our \"server\", who got tipped over 100 dollars, informed us that if we want the beer, coffee, sodas, or bloody Marys that came with the meal, we had to go and get them ourselves. The bartender where you got the bloody Marys was extremely snippy making it unpleasant to go up and get a drink. Our server couldn't be anywhere to be found. We had to wait and wait (many of us waiting over 20 minutes) to get champagne (which was one of the few  things our server could actually serve us) and she rarely cleared the dirty plates. Our plates sat and sat in front of us. So she got 100 dollars but didn't have to bring food or most beverages to the table and didn't clear the dishes until we had a couple piled in front of each of us. A member in our group finally went to find her and spoke to her and she made slightly more effort but it was, all in all, a pretty bad experience. I highly suggest to spend a little more and go to the Belaggio or the Wynn where both the food and the service is so much better than here. Paying a server that much money for basically clearing a few plates is ridiculous.",

    "text": "We went here on Saturday night in Las Vegas and were sadly seated a good distance from all of the food stations, and on the complete opposite end of the room from the self serve drink station. Was hard to believe with how many empty tables there were closer, all of my food was so so, turkey was great, and the little bit of crab legs left when I got there were very good, but later on when I checked for more, a good 30 minutes, they still hadn't refilled it, unlimited crab legs didn't happen. Neither me nor my fiance enjoyed the desserts so we were very thankful that we did not pay full price with a coupon we had purchased. Wish they did a cheaper price for those that do not want the unlimited beer and wine as neither of us would have paid for it, my one glass of wine, was very hard to drink and I was not even able to finish it. Our server was very nice but definitely would have preferred to be seated closer to the food and drinks.",

    "text": "This is really a 2.5.  What lies between MEH and A-OK?   OK.  Like the first Matrix sequel.  Not bad.  Not good.  Just OK.  Typically I stay at the Mirage when I Vegas and so I try to slip into the Cravings for breakfast.  I would not say anything is gourmet or jaw dropping, but you can put together almost any breakfast you can imagine reasonably enough.    Unfortunately, the most disappointing aspect of the breakfast is the lame 80's era hotel coffee.  Mirage -- you don't have to serve Starbucks.  Go to a local Panera or Einsteins Bagels to get an idea of what you should be serving.  Something smooth with some flavor.  Not bland weak nothingness.   You should be embarrassed at this point.  I've read other reviews that indicate this buffet used to rule Las Vegas.  I'm not really convinced any buffet can rule much of anything.  I tried to over-rated Wynn buffet and the far superior Paris buffet and I'm simply not sold on the idea that any buffet can challenge a reasonably good restaurant.  But that's not why buffets are in Vegas.  They are there to offer cheap fast eats.  They are cafeterias with delusions of grandeur.  The Cravings is a decent 'cafeteria' if you will.  The sushi lacks fish, the shrimp is plump and bottomless, the coffee (again) sucks, and they'll toss you a tasty salad of your dreams.  Like I said, it's OK... for a buffet.  The Mirage has been good about updating itself and I think it's time my favorite affordable resort re-invent the buffet.  Scrap the silly name.  Pull the Studio 54 gold and mirrors out of the interior.    I'm hearing good things about what the Cosmopolitan is doing it.  Take what works and fix what doesn't over there, bring it to the Mirage.  Charge higher prices to people walkin' in off the street but give resort guests a bold discount -- and name said discount as a benefit of the resort fee.",

    "text": "Decided to try buffet at mirage and it was ok. Nothing special except dessert in small neat portions. Went there at dinner time Saturday night with my wife to have diner. They have crab legs, prime rib and corned beef. Tried almost every food there. Crab legs were super watery, salty and small, prime rib and corned beef wasn't great(not best cuts of meat), sushi was bland. It's good place if you want relatively cheap meal and if you can't decide what you feel like. Server was good always keep our table clean, unlimited house wine and beer (goose island ipa and bud light) which was nice cause usually one beer is $6-8 per glass anywhere. It's worth it if you like wine and Bert and don't care of brand. Desserts were good and I had quiet bit of them(they also have massive selection of sugar free stuff). Almost all food was under salted but I understand that not everyone likes salty food but salt and pepper available at the tables. Lines were long bit if you have pearl or above mlife card then you skip lines (we did yay). We also used 2 for 1 voucher from myvegas app. No problems with redeeming rewards. Just make sure you head to mlife desk so they can load it to your card. Overall if you have comps or vouchers or coupons it's definitely worth it. For under $30 for 2 people? Can't have it anywhere else.",

    "text": "This review is just for their breakfast buffet. I came here with fellow yelpers Cristal C and Andrew L to finish off our insane week in Vegas for EDC. Sadly I was not really satisfied with this buffet.   I love Mexican food in the morning, but almost all of their mexican selections here were so overly spiced that I couldn't taste anything else! So, I kindly moved to try their basic American breakfast items... The small waffles were decent, French toast was dry and overdone, and the only thing I felt like going back for seconds was the bacon...   Oh yeah, they also has an italian section, with pizza.. Pizza? Now that was a little odd to me... I passed on that and peered over at their omelet area. Now that seemed like the winner. That's we're a majority of the people were at, I was already losing my appetite so I didn't actually taste it, but that's where I would suggest someone to try if going here.  They also have a fair selection of bagels, cereals, and muffins, but if you're going to pay 17 dollars for a breakfast buffet, wouldn't you want something at least, hot?? There you go, my 2 cents about the mirage breakfast buffet. Sadly, it wasn't great. I'm definitely moving on to the next one when I go back to Vegas.",

    "text": "Back in the day (especially when it was under the helm of Steve Wynn), the buffet at the Mirage was the nicest one in town. And even when it took a back seat to fancier, pricier, and more popular offerings from newer resorts such as Bellagio, Paris, and the Wynn, it still held its own as an excellent above average Vegas buffet. As recently as one or two years ago, Cravings offered a great dining experience. While you didn't get more upscale items like seared ahi or beef wellington, you did get a wide selection of food that was delicious and fresh. I recall prime rib that was juicy and tender, mounds of moist crab legs, and steaming entree selections. Well, not anymore.  Now things have gone noticeable downhill. The prime rib which I remembered so fondly was overcooked. My piece of medium prime rib had hardly any pink left in it and no juices running out of it when I cut into it. I can't imagine what a piece of the well done would have tasted like. The crab legs looked a bit dried out and only enough was put out throughout the evening to cover the ice underneath. A lot of the the other meats offered at various stations were also a bit overcooked. Knowing that buffets typically undercook their food slightly (since the heat from the steam trays and lamps finish the job) it suggests that the cooks were not careful with their technique or that the food was just sitting out for too long.   Many food items were not being replenished or refreshed as often as they should have. The two bowls of ceviche I wanted to try were half empty, with much of the seafood already picked out of it. It remained this way for the entire duration of my meal. The hand rolls at the sushi station were replenished sporadically. And meager allowances of crab legs on the ice tray left me feeling like I was constantly picking through leftovers.  Service at the tables was adequate, but service at the food stations was detached and unfriendly, with hardly a smile to be found. I also had to make three trips to the gelato station before finding someone to offer me a scoop.  To be fair, none of the food at Cravings was bad enough be inedible or unpalatable. At a lesser buffet in a lesser hotel, it might have been passable. However, at $26.99 for a buffet at the Mirage (Bellagio was only a few dollars extra this weeknight) I expected more in terms of quality, freshness, and service.",

We waited for a new tray but it never happened, we waited 30 minutes but nothing. Gelato bar is food! We tried to give breakfast a try but it was $35 also, didn't want to make the same mistake.

Secondly, the buffet offers unlimited drinks, which is a plus. They also have an amazing drink station with so many selections that can comfort even the pickiest person. The food selection and quality are decent for this price. If you are a cheese lover, this place is for you. They have many expensive kinds of cheese. They often change the foods so you won't have the same dishes every times you go there. Overall is good and this place is always my food destination every time I go to Vegas",

Stations has a better buffet for a cheaper price. If you're going for the higher priced items, Bellagio is a way better choice.",

The layout is confusing as hell, but the most disappointing thing about my visit here was the fact that nothing leaped out at me that was so delicious that I kept eating my hangover away.  I came by here and did the 30 dollar mimosa champagne brunch and I'm sad to say that I literally ate 1 plate of food.  How miserable is that? I also got a mini plate of desserts that I took a half bite out of each of my 4 things and it was really disappointing.  The only thing that saved me was the fact that their asian section had congee (rice porridge) so I was able to keep something down.  Yeah, I was pretty god damned hung over that day.  Me and my friends talked so much shit to each other telling each other and ourselves that we were going to eat a mountain of food and to have at least 3 plates each, if not 5.  What a sad day.  None of us ate much.  30 bucks for a half eaten plate and a half bowl of rice porridge.  But we did clean them out on the mimosas, cause we're boss like that.  (or stupid)   The food itself wasn't really good and it was actually the worst buffet I've been to in Las Vegas.  I think if you're willing to pay 30 buckaroos for a buffet, I strongly urge you to check out a different joint if you can.  There are far better options out there on the strip that might even be cheaper.",

I would have given this place 3 stars if it hadn't been for the hostesses / cashiers at the front. We were a group of 12, but were just going to meet inside. Paid for our meals, went to be seated, and asked for a large table since we were a group. Mind you the place was empty given it was around 11am .... told no flat out. Then told we would have to pay extra for a group ... aren't you a buffet in a casino? And shouldn't you cater to groups? We noticed they were giving an elderly group of people the same treatment. Luckily our waitress just moved us and we were all able to sit together. Personally, I don't care about the extra $3 or $5 bucks, it was just the attitude of the hostess was completely out of line.",

Cravings is a good choice when it comes to \"budget\" buffeting! It's probably a good 10-15 bucks cheaper than your Bellagio Buffets (I'm sorry I don't keep track of dough when I'm ballin' it up in Vegas ;)  Anyways, even though the buffet isn't as large as some of the other ones on the strip, it's got your basic fundamentals.  The shrimp, crab and prime rib are all there so that's really all you need!  What really makes this place stand out is the Gelato!!! I literally eat my meal in anticipation of dining on the dessert!!! I go nuts w/ the gelato... I mix it w/ the cookies and other random desserts... nirvana!  And sometimes (often), I'll have a slab of prime rib after cleansing my pallet w/ the sweetness... weird? Kinda.  The decor is decent.. it's got a bunch of LCDs while you're waiting in line.  The ingredients look so fresh and it makes me, oh, so hungry!  What I don't particularly like about the dining area is that it feels too meshed together... you got the buffet lining around the outside of the seating area... which kinda makes seating area efficient but boring... doesn't really scream VEGAS.  Either way, it's a good choice and would get a much higher score anywhere here in SOCAL, but this is the SIN CITY, where amazing buffet/food are a dime a dozen.",

They do have prime ribs. And they have other varieties - not great...but it's alright.   Their dessert buffet, however, is a disappointment. there's nothing that i want to really eat. THe best thing about their dessert is their gelato ice cream section.   Cravings is nothing like the big buffets, but it is way better than other buffets such as monte carlo, circus, flamingo, etc. In my book of vegas buffet.. I'd say Mirage's buffet is the mid-class buffet. Cravings is a good choice if u dont want to spend the extra 20 on a higher class buffet.. or dont feel like eating too much at the same time dont want to pay the same amount of price at a dine-in restaurant.",

We went here for a champagne brunch and they had everything I could imagine. Shrimp cocktail, crablegs, mongolian bbq. Prime rib you name it.   All the food was good and I had to be carted out of that place in a wheelbarrow.   But yeah 35 for all the food with all you can drink champagne? For sure the best one I have been to in vegas and I cant wait to go back.",

Heck, I was happy thinking of the buffet this way:  \"Whoa, $25 is a great deal for all you can eat shrimp cocktail!\" (And if you just do that, they will probably lose money on you!)  Random thoughts. - The sushi is pretty lame. It clearly comes out of a machine, gross. The temaki is OK but like all temaki it is 99% rice and 1% fish. - Delicious prime rib. It is arguably better than the stuff at the Bellagio, which I found to be dry and flavorless. They also have actual (non-creamy) horseradish, which I appreciate deeply. - GREAT gelato - but the guy was giving everyone the evil eye, I don't know why. I won't hold it against the place. - And of course, great shrimp cocktail / raw bar :)  I'd love to come back here next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "For three weeks i have been waiting for this amazing buffet experience but have been let down with just pure disappointment. Before i went on my vegas vacation all my co workers have urged me to go to Le village buffet at Paris but i figured why not just go to the buffet that is closer, considering the fact that i was staying at the Mirage and didnt want to go through the hassle of leaving the hotel and driving through the traffic just for a buffet. Little did i know that this Cravings buffet was just awful.   It was about 30 dollars per person, im not going to bitch about the price because everything in vegas is going to be expensive. I understand that majority of the buffets are about this price, so whatever right? I am a big seafood fan so i immediately went to the sushi bar and grabbed a tuna sushi with an avocado roll and a tuna roll. When i went back to my seat i noticed that the rice on the roll was stale and hard. I didnt even eat it. The tuna sushi was AWFUL it was a tiny little piece that was turning brown!!! i left it on the side of my plate because i didnt even want to touch it.   I did enjoy the shrimp..so i grubbed on shrimp until i was sick of shrimp.. I figured that they couldnt mess up on salad and their salad bar was pretty good.   but overall this was not a memorable experience. well..memorable yes..but in a bad way.",

But i thought Cravings, at the Mirage was a pretty good deal.  It was about $20 for brunch and there were bottomless mimosas or bloody marys.  The things I remember eating were french toast, hashbrowns, prime rib, ham, shrimp cocktail, crab legs, wonton noodles, potstickers, fruit, gelato, mango pudding, cake, and some other desserts.  They had mango pudding!!! I was so excited about that... usually don't see mango pudding at places other than chinese places.  And this wasn't the mango pudding that was like gelatin at chiense places, but it was actually pudding, soft and creamy mango pudding!! So good.   I think i got my money's worth, i was pretty satisfied.  I also got a huge chocolate chip cookie on my way out to eat while i was gambling.  The biggest disappointment though, was the sushi.  There was barely any fish in the rolls, and thats all they had - rolls.",

As a person with multiple food allergies, I usually dread these things because I never know what I can eat, but my family wanted to go. It turned out that the assistant manager, Kent, and the executive chef, Jeffrey, personally walked me from station to station, describing the ingredients in each item, and offering to make me something if necessary. They were very busy but did not make me feel like they were putting them out in any way. Their kindness was so appreciated.  Not only that, the food was very good, and it turned out that I got plenty to eat. ALL of us were happy!  I recommend this buffet to anyone, but if you have dietary restrictions, this place is great because of the staff.",

Anyway, the lack of a long line typical of Sunday  mornings should have been a major red flag.  We had a time constraint so we waited 15 minutes and settled for brunch here at the price of $24.95.   I'm not sure about the other buffets, but you could also get free mimosas with your brunch here.    There was a lot of selection with a variety of Chinese, sushi, breakfast, salad, dessert, gelato, and meats.  I avoid all sushi for the most part at buffets, and for good reason, too; my friend decided to try a couple of pieces found the rice to be stale with meager portions of fish.    Most of the food was mediocre, but the oatmeal was good.  I was also surprised with the har gow and how it tasted like something I could get from Rowland Heights.  I was excited about the gelato case but in the middle of my chocolate gelato, I found a chunk of ice, aka the deal breaker.  I must say that the lady who served our table was very courteous and attentive.  One of the best ones I've ever had at a buffet.  She kicks this review up a star.",

You get a variety of food from diff cultures. I would say the spotlight to this place would be the prime rib and the seafood. They have some nice wonton soup but stay away from the chicken noodle. Desserts looked very bland. The gelato ice cream is pretty delicious looking too, they have someone serving it to you. I'd stay away from the sushi.  I didn't really eat that much because I was anticipating barfing later that night but overall I felt this place was just okay... It's good for the price, I guess for the quality I was expecting, I'd need to pay more money.",

The salad bar was ok and the deserts were ok but none of the rest of the food was very good and the over-all taste was extreme saltiness.  Our server was a very nice lady, by the way.    I am not a food snob.  I love cheap diners and cafeterias. If this place charged, say, seven dollars for the meal I would have been content.  What annoyed me about this place was the hype and the price.  But that's what Las Vegas is all about-  an illusion of quality hiding a core of mediocrity or worse.",

    "text": "Based on the positive reviews of the Cravings buffet that I'd read in my Fodor's guidebook and elsewhere, my expectations for the selection and quality of food were high. They were met on the first point but not on the second. Maybe this place rates well in terms of buffets overall, and maybe I shouldn't be evaluating it on the same terms I use for rating standard made-to-order places. I thought the price was reasonable -- $17 for lunch.  I didn't mind the bright, modern decor that's apparently bothered some people. I was annoyed, though, that the hosts at the front of the restaurant wouldn't seat us right away when there were cleary open tables in the dining room, and they weren't particularly friendly about it. Our beverage waiter was great, though, ncie and attentive.  My favorite items were the andouille sausage, the steak (I can't remember the cut), the broccolini, the shrimp cocktail, and the chocolate catalan and bread pudding for dessert. I liked the fact that dim sum (primarily buns and potstickers) was offered, but it was merely adequate. And the duck in the Chinese food station was overcooked. The sushi selection wasn't particularly impressive, either. It was hard to choose what to eat, as there was such a huge selection -- that was nice.  A decent Vegas buffet option, but I'd be interested in something higher quality for my next visit.",

The king crab is good, the prime rib is delicious, and the desserts were excellent.  A very solid buffet and one of my favorites in Vegas.",

That said, you get what you pay for. The shrimp seemed like it had been sitting out since brunch started at 8 am. The fruit selection was very small (melon, pineapple - no berries). My favorite items were the omelet station, crab legs and soups. Our server was wonderful and efficient refilling our champagne and mimosas. Overall, I'd go back if staying at the Mirage and looking for a good value. If you are looking for an impressive Vegas buffet experience, go elsewhere and spend a bit more.",

My family and my sisters family come to Vegas once a year. We always end up going to a buffet at least once while we are here. Today we picked the Mirage. One reason is that my 9 year old nephew has food allergies. Severely. My sister called ahead of time to make sure they had food that was safe for him. The chef she spoke to was Endhir. He was super friendly! We get there and the staff was sooooooooo beyond amazing that we decided to only come to this buffet from now on!  Our waitress was Diane, oh my gosh! So very sweet! She makes you feel right at home! She didn't let us get up to get our drinks she was so kind. And the chef Remy came out to meet my sister and talk to her about my nephews allergies. Took the time to walk around the whole buffet to look at foods he can eat and to tell my sister what the food was cooked in. He personally made him his own pizza and French fries and took out a new dish of bacon with clean tongs for him. He gave us his card so we can call ahead of time for him to make my nephews food which was so amazingly kind of him to do. When we were leaving my nephew wanted to thank him and I just wanted to cry because he was so kind and it just warms my heart when people are so kind and understanding of his allergies. We usually have a hard time because it can be frustrating. But Remy & Diane were really amazing and appreciate them so much!",

    "text": "3  stars   Been to several of the buffets on the vegas strip over the years, got to say the way to get a 5 stars is in my book has to be with the easy items, if you visit any of the buffets here in vegas here is a quick tip for the breakfast or lunch buffets if they can't make scrabbled eggs or mashed potatoes right everything else is going to be less then stellar.  just a tip I picked up from others who frequent the buffets in vegas, for early dinners or late lunches you look for prime rib, if it is dry with no taste your probably at one of the buffets that just throws everything out there with no real prep  here at cravings they did pretty good with there eggs and there mashed potatoes their prime rib was lacking but they made up for it with the choice of shu mai, fresh made not sticky, still dripping due to the steam   they got alot of choices Italian, Chinese, American, Fishmonger (haha), sushi, several other choices, they also got a bar on this line of options, alcohol you have to pay extra for but im sure you all know that.  there breakfast choices: eggs benedict decent, bacon standard, links standard looked dried up, waffles were perfect crisp outer shell soft chewy inside, french toast not so great, eggs better the most other buffets  for this buffet spot I would go back for brunch price is decent for brunch!  food *** ribs no happy! Eggs, fried rice, shu mai, waffles are crisp outside soft inside price $$ it is about $28 per person folks ambiance **** clean, easy to manuver through sections service ***** very helpful staff",

    "text": "After a truly dreadful experience at the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's Palace last night (Voted best buffet? By whom? A bunch of drunks?), I was delighted to have just the opposite experience tonight at Cravings! Seriously...from start to finish, it was like night and day!  To begin with, the first thing we noticed as we walked in (other than the fact that we WERE able to walk right in) was that everything smelled and looked incredibly appetizing (a real contrast to Bacchanal's rancid-smelling steam tables!). A quick turn around the stations (which are organized in a neat oval, so you can easily see what's available) showed that there was plenty available for us to eat (we're vegetarians, and my husband has a seafood allergy, so we're a little pickier than a lot of buffet diners).  Most importantly, everything was beautifully fresh, clearly labeled, and nicely presented. Again, after our experience of wilted greens, dried-out rice and bread, and tasteless pizza the night before, the contrast was striking. This looked and smelled, from the get-go, like stuff we really WANTED to eat rather than something we were settling for.  Another important point: When I asked the people at the stations what was in this dish or that, they KNEW, without having to scratch their heads, mutter \"I dunno\" and go find someone else (yes, we had that experience at Bacchanal as well).  Everything I had was delicious (and it was quite a mixture...ranging from vegetable spring rolls from the Chinese station to beautiful Arab-style hummus, tabouli, and FRESH, SOFT pita from the Mediterranean station). I was especially impressed by the range of cheeses in the deli section. Sage Derby! Guinness-laced Irish Cheddar! Yum!  Just because, I sampled the pizza as well, and again, the contrast was marked. This pizza was fresh and tasty, and I would have had more if I hadn't had so many other things I wanted to sample.  I think my favorite part was the salad station. A nice selection of lovely, fresh greens, and all kinds of toppings and mix-ins...and the entertaining salad chef puts it together for you and tosses it to order for you!  I don't eat it myself, but you seafood fans will be happy to know that yes...they have unlimited king crab legs and drawn butter. Every buffet in Vegas has unlimited crab legs. It's a thing.  Oh, and did I mention the free beer and wine? That's right...you get all the beer or wine you want as part of the price of your meal (soft drinks as well, of course).  And the price? Well, this is Vegas, so it's not not cheap, but it's not bad at $26.99/person (especially when you factor in the drinks). We had a better food selection, MUCH better quality food, a knowledgeable and friendly staff, a better  selection of drinks, and just an all-around better experience, at a fraction of the cost. From here on out, Cravings will be our FIRST pick when it comes to buffet dining in Las Vegas!",

    "text": "We have eaten here many, many times over the years. It was once my favorite buffet. Today we arrived at 4:00 PM, just as dinner was starting, so it was crowded. I was using my Las Vegas Advisor 2-for-1 coupon (not a free coupon book-- I paid $37 for the book), and was hoping to also use MLife points to pay for the remainder of the meal-- but they wouldn't let me use both (even though I have over $100 in points for using my new MLife Mastercard). I was ticked, but went ahead and paid my $31.99 for dinner. I wish I wouldn't have bothered.   We usually go for lunch, but thought that there would be more to choose from for dinner-- we were wrong. They did have crab legs, but they were so small that it took too much work to make them worthwhile. They didn't have smoked salmon, which was disappointing as that's one of my favorites and they always have it at lunchtime-- I asked and was told that they don't serve it at dinner. So basically, it was the same food for $8 more. My husband had to hunt to find enough to make a meal out of. The Asian section is really weak. The prime rib was OK. There was absolutely nothing special to justify the price of this buffet. The desserts were nothing spectacular at all-- in fact, a fairly skimpy selection once you eliminate the no-sugar-added stuff. The raspberry sorbet was pretty good, but that was about it for the dessert section. I do love the cappuccino at the end of the meal.  I never thought I would feel so negatively about the Mirage's buffet, but I doubt we'll be going back again for a long time. You have to serve yourself your own beverages, and the beverage section is in a rather inconvenient location. There is no real wait staff to bring you extra napkins or utensils,and they take forever to clear the tables off. Honestly, I haven't felt this disappointed in a buffet in a long, long time. You can go to the Fiesta Henderson and for $7.49 be treated like a king. We went to the Palms last week and had a great buffet for around $10. I know that most people are being held captive on the Strip, but it would be worth the car rental fee to have a car and drive to the outlying casinos to eat. They seem to appreciate the business, and the food is every bit as good, if not better. I have no desire to go back to the Mirage. And I was so disgusted with this whole thing that I did not stop and gamble a cent. We just walked straight out the door. Totally disappointing!!",

We were pleasantly surprised though by the quality of the food.  We mainly stuck to the things that looked appetizing and didn't bother trying anything else.    Things I would recommend: -the all you can drink wine (included for free) -prime rib (honestly, the best we had out of all the vegas buffets) -bbq ribs (we preferred them even over the ones at bacchanal) -salmon handrolls (sushi) -gelato (chocolate, pistachio, mint chocolate chip, and vanilla)  Overall, the buffet is nothing fancy, but it has a few stellar options!",

One chair we had at our table was wobbly and broken. The  desserts tasted \"odd\"  and not fresh. So we see a chef walking around who says he is the chef of that room, think his name was something like Endeer, and tells us that the buffet staff does not make the pastries, that they order from an outside company. So, does this mean all the big name casinos can't afford a pastry staff, they have to order? Wow, I can only assume then that nothing is made in house, yet they charge an extreme amount of money. Never again. I'm sure there are better buffets for a better price, like at Red Rock casino who by the way never has food on the floor.",

Included the buffet and all you can drink beer, wine, mimosas which made up for the cost but overall food was good and you have a good selection of type of food from Mexican, Asian, American, etc.  Was able to walk right in and seated promptly. If you are staying far I recommend taking the monorail instead of a cab and get off at Harrahs.  It's right across the street.",

    "text": "Thank goodness for the myVEGAS rewards.  I was able to get a two for one breakfast/lunch buffet.  Came out to about $21 for both the gf and I.  I'm pushing 40 and been to Vegas many times.  This was one if the worst buffets I've been to.  I've even done the Circus Circus buffet and that experience was easily more memorable than what we had at the mirage.  I grew up with the Mirage being one if the marquee resorts on the strip.  National lampoons made a great movie centered around the strip with Nick Papagiorgio breaking bad with Jilly from Philly.  Sadly, I would of preferred what Clark and Cousin Eddie ate at the downtown buffet with the blue chicken. On the positive side, the made to order omelette station was great.  It seems as though everything is just spaced out so that it feels as though there are great food options.  It's a bit of a stretch when in the Latin section you have stale chips to make your own nachos.  Taco Bell is more traditional than what these folks are trying to pass off.",

The food was hot and tasted amazing (the buffet divides the food into categories such as Chinese, Latin, barbeque, seafood, Italian, etc.)  The price is reasonable, but a little on the high end in my opinion (29.99 each for dinner)  The decor inside the buffet was upscale and classy, loved it!   Overall had a great time, and would recommend checking it out (maybe for lunch though since the price would probably be cheaper)!",

We picked this buffet because we were staying at the The Mirage, and they also had a better quality beer included in the price.  There were a lot of options for people without any dietary restrictions. Vegetarians watch out! I talked to the chef and he told me that even the dishes marked as vegetarian contain chicken powder!!! The CHEF told me this! He didn't seem to care at all that this of course makes any vegetarian items not safe for them to eat. I spent the whole night and next day sick from eating chicken, which I am allergic to. This practice of adding meat to items clearly marked as vegetarian is dangerous. Who knows what else is hiding in their food.",

My boyfriend and I decided to go take a look at their dinner buffet the night before and it looked pretty good so we decided to go check it out the next night. We had gone for their holiday dinner buffet and paid 28 per person with a discount we had gotten. No lines, no fuss, just went to pay and got seated within minutes! The workers were friendly and helpful! You don't need to wait for your drinks as they have everything you want in their \"refreshers\" section. Everything tasted amazingly good! We were all so shocked! We have tried Paris, Bellagios and none of them tasted how Mirages buffet did! Everything was organized perfectly and everything tasted very fresh! Their carving station was amazing! Only down fall is they close at 9 pm so you cant stick around for too long! And their dessert section needs to be bigger! But with all those foods that had such good quality it was not that big of a deal!",

    "text": "There were four of us dining at Cravings Buffet at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas. After reading the Yelp reviews with a \"Yelp sort\", we knew we could not go wrong at Cravings.  Yelp sort is interesting.  You always seem to find higher rated reviews on top, which is the first thing a viewer sees, so when a reviewer writes that Cravings Buffet is one of the best on the strip, you can't help but put faith in the review.  Wrong thing to do.  Sort by the most recent reviews and read everything for the past few weeks.   We arrived at Cravings Buffet and were greeted with smiles from the cashier to the hostess to employees on the floor.  Eleven food stations were filled with fresh, perfectly seasoned and delicious foods to tantalize even the most sophisticated palate. From Asian to Italian, each station duplicated authentic ethnic cooking.  The second paragraph written above is more of a fantasy and not reality.  Our experience was the exact opposite.  I have given Cravings a one-star because that is the lowest Yelp allows.  Had there been an opportunity to give a negative 1,2,3, etc, it would have been rated the absolute lowest and for good reason.    The old saying, \"you get what you pay for\" does not apply when dining at Cravings Buffet in the beautiful Mirage Hotel, Las Vegas.  The buffet is one of the more expensive on the Las Vegas Strip, so anyone reading the Yelp reviews and other expect at least good food, if not exceptional.  We arrived at Cravings just a few minutes after 3 PM when the dinner menu began.  Prices increase considerably if you arrive at 3 PM instead of 2:58 PM or 2:59 PM.  That is the difference between their Friday brunch and Friday dinner.  First impressions are lasting ones and the cashier was not too friendly, though not nearly as rude as the seating hostess. Okay, so you only deal with those two for a few minutes before moving onto more disappointment. My husband went straight to the seafood station, while I headed for the Asian cuisine.  His crab legs and mussels were terribly overcooked and had no seasoning.  He drank one of their cheap beers from the bar before trying the crappy red and white wines.  Veronica was working the floor when she came to the table to ask if everything was okay.  My husband told her the crab legs were rubbery and she said that is the way crab is prepared at Cravings.  I grabbed some rice, chow mein, Asian dumplings, sushi, and a few other things to sample.  Of course nothing tasted good.  Everything was mushy and bland.  Sad, sad, sad.  A few tips to Cravings Buffet management at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas:  1) Train or retrain your staff in customer service.  When employees are rude to customers, they will likely not return.  2) You have a serious issue with food quality.  If your chefs are preparing the food according to the recipes, then change the recipes and purchase better quality ingredients.  If not, hire chefs with formal training.  That applies to your pastry chefs as well.  Your desserts are not worth eating.  3) Train your serving staff, especially at the carving section.  First they should be knowledgeable about the products they are attempting to carve.  The carver should know the type of cut and the difference in temperatures.  When a customer requests medium rare, and the options are medium rare or well-done, it should be served as ordered.  If your  procedures are to have both temperatures available and they are not prepared properly, then your chefs should have caught the error and corrected.  Second, when someone asks to have meat cut thin, that does not mean 3/4\" or more.  Their carving knives appeared to be capable of carving properly.  4) Even when customers have a horrible experience, a good floor manager can make things better if they tried.  Again, that wasn't the case with us.  One of the other diners in our group requested the manager come to the table.  An older frumpy woman came, along with an assistant chef to hear some of the issues.  She explained to both that the food was grossly over-cooked and was terribly bland.  Salt and pepper is cheap, so why not use to help make your food taste better.  It was one of her birthday meals and she ended up spitting out  everything she put into her mouth.  She told the manager it was some of the most disgusting food ever attempted to eat and was truly disappointed with the experience.    While three of the four at the table expressed to your personnel that the food was crappy, the only thing done was the manager refunded money for one person.  A good manager at a reputable restaurant would have refunded the entire amount, apologized for our unfortunate experience at Cravings Buffet, then ask us to return one day after they improve on their shortcomings and nothing less.    You totally failed with food, customer service and value for price paid.  Shameful.",

Recently I used the MyVegas '2 for 1' discount to try this place out again (we were starving...so had to look for a nearby buffet).    Pretty wide selection of cultural food, however I think overall they had way too much carbohydrate dishes.  The flavors of each dish per culture were all fairly similar too...not much flavor distinction.  The physical look of the buffet seems a bit outdated as well.  The dessert station wasn't up to par, compared to other nearby buffets.  Overall, this buffet has everything you want if you are starving! However, if it weren't for the MyVegas deal that I claimed, the quality of food here would not be worth $37/person.  There are other Vegas buffets on the strip that offer much better quality for about the same price.",

They don't bring your drinks to the table therefore you have to keep going to the beverage section to get more.

My scent of the food was overridden by cigarette smell. I think if I was closer into the restaurant I would've enjoyed it much more. The asian area was very limited, with only 4-5 items in the Japanese section and 4-5 items in the Chinese section. The prime rib was great and went well with the steamed crab legs. Desserts were average at best. A pie I tried tasted very stale. Nice selection of soft drinks at the soda machine; close-by were cappuccino machines and a bar that served 2 selections of draft beer and wine. Overall great quality for the price compared to other buffets on the Strip and I would go back.",

    "text": "$58 for two people for the dinner buffet.  A little expensive for what you get.  You do have variety to chose from but I'd rather have less choices and better food. The salad was \"bagged lettuce.\"  Believe me, you could tell.  The pizza was on par with the frozen kind you get at the store. I will say the Prime Rib and Turkey was good.  eh mashed potatoes and gravy. You can get better Chinese food at the Safeway deli counter.   I saw they had carrot cake.  I love carrot cake!  Unfortunately, it was dry and tasteless.  There are these little squares of carrot cake with cream cheese frosting that are very moist and flavorful that you can buy at most gas station mini marts. I got one on our drive home.....waaay better then what Cravings had to offer.   They got the 2nd star for the Service.  Our waitress was quick and attentive.",

We were all staying at The Mirage and have never tried their buffet, so in we went. The wife and I were excited when we saw the variety from a distance, but when we got closer, were really surprised at how little food there was. On top of that, the food was terrible! I almost broke my tooth on the stale pot stickers. The prime rib was cold and flavorless. The guy who makes your salad reminded us a lot of 'The Soup Nazi' from Seinfeld. It literally took our server 15 minutes to get a diet Roy Rogers (Diet Coke with Grenadine). I am a HUGE dessert fan and this place really was a joke. They must be spending our $25 on the dolphin exhibit, cause it isn't being spent on good food. They should fire their food prep people and get a new decorator. The booth seat I was in felt like I was leaning against a wall. We came in around 4 pm, which is between lunch and dinner, but they had just started their dinner service so shouldn't the food have been fresh and hot?",

They have fresh omelletes made there, and breakfast pizzas, tons of meat, sausages, bacon, fruit, yogurt, bagels, cheese, etc.  The only thing that stopped me from giving it was 5 star was the staff.  We went there on a Monday morning.  Our first server forgot the milk that my wife ordered and I had to hunt her down after seeing here walk pass us a few times without the milk in sight.  Then after half an hour, another server took over and I finished my first glass of orange juice so I asked him for another glass.  He went into the kitchen for about 5 minutes and then came out a bunch of juice containers and walked off into the other side of the restaurant.  I gave up on the OJ and we left.  Also another thing was the women at the cheese/deli meat station.  The salmon plate was almost finished so an older European gentlemen politely asked her to change it saying \" the salmon looks sad, can you change it please?\" and she walked away to another side that I was close to and while she was unpacking a new salmon plate, I could hear her mumble, \"the only thing sad here is you\".  I would expect better service at such a nice hotel but obviously they've gotta better train their buffet staff.  I would come back for the hotel (our 3 night stay in our room was fantastic), and I would eat the food, but I don't think I'd come back if I saw the same servers and kitchen staff working there.",

    "text": "This year is 20 years since my first visit to the Mirage, and though the viewpoint of a 20 year old and a 40 year old are different, given I have since traveled the world, the one lens which remains the same is the understanding of kindness and feeling appreciated. The food is still good and though it has long since been eclipsed in variety and quality by others across the Strip, what struck me today was how few of the staff bother to smile at the guests, and none more so than the staff tending the actual buffets. Indeed one whose name I noted was Bernard (an elderly chinese or other asian) was irritated that I had asked for a slice of prime rib as he was busy filling a bowl of horse radish. He made me wait until he was finished and then quickly sliced a dry piece which he flung on to my plate. Another staffer (an african american man, late forties/fifties, didn't catch his name) looking after the breakfasty items (this was their midweek brunch service) ignored a question I had and disappeared off inside. Sure the rest of the reviewers are right here - there was no line and the food was solid. But the key to hospitality is not just about product, but more importantly about making people feel at home. The Mirage has lost that quality from 20 years ago when it was fully staffed by professionals who remembered the golden era of Vegas and had been chosen by leadership because of their interpersonal skills. I question if Mirage leadership, certainly at the buffet restaurant, is being as critical now. Remember, this isn't a cheap meal at $23-24 and the Mirage is still deemed a four star brand. Not sure if Mirage leadership look at reviews like this but the staffer details are included for them - for the rest of the readership, I do suggest that there could be several reasons why some buffets have long lines and the Mirage has no line.",

Italian station was some kind of spaghetti, meatballs, and then the rest was pizza, all of it was bad.  Most of the stations had two hot soup options and/or dips and spreads that appeared to be there just to take up space and make it look like more variety than it was.  The prime rib was overcooked and seriously under seasoned and the crab legs were ice cold and ruined by being sliced in half long ways so you had to dig out the meat with a fork, not to mention they were small snow crab legs to begin with.  Even the cocktail shrimp were very \"shrimpy\" tasting, not good.  I would have been disappointed with this buffet even if it was completely comped.  There was not anything that was worth eating, I'd have rather eaten at the food court in the Fashion Show Mall.",

First off the prime rib was definitely good and I do love my prime rib  ( but I didn't see anything else like turkey or ham at the carving station for all the non prime rib fans, didn't bother me as much but just saying).  Next if you truly enjoy sushi, never eat it at a regular Vegas buffet because it just isnt that good (excluding Rio and Bellagio buffets) so I won't fault Mirage really for that.  The shrimp cocktail and crab legs were as good as most other buffets.  They're Chinese food was not very good along with alot of their sides like potato salad, mashed potatoes, and other veggies etc.  And while they do have gelato, their selection is quite small, (4 flavors of which the hazelnut was the best), the other desserts did pretty much suck. The cheesecake was incredibly gross along with a not so good apple pie.  And since we all know dessert is pretty much the best part of a meal, that definitely didn't leave the best taste in my mouth.   Overall for 25 dollars a person, it was decent, but I'd rather spend the extra money to eat better.",

The place is huge, and the individual stations wrap around the seating area.  I didn't know where to start first, so I retreated to my comfort zone - DESSERT STATION!!!  They have a nice arrangement of desserts.  The standouts for me were the flourless chocolate cake, fruit tart and the various gelatos.  Heaven.  The chocolate cake is so dense and sweet, I swear you will form a cavity after eating one.  Fruit tart had a lovely flaky crust and was filled with very fresh fruits.  So after packing five pounds to my fat ass, I proceeded to the other stations.  Prime rib was good (Hey Miss meatcarver lady - don't be so chintzy with the pieces please).  Sushi station was disappointing; everything looked dry.  Seaweed salad was delicious; that alone kept me coming back to the sushi station.  Crab legs and shrimp looked very fresh, however they are served out of a cubby hole carved in the wall..that was kinda weird.  Lots of various stations - cuban, mexican, vietnamese.  Lots of variety..better than most of the buffets I've been to.",

Started off with prime rib, veggies, and mashed potatoes.  The prime was pretty good, not dry at all.. even though it was pretty late.  The service was good, server made sure we had our drinks. For round two, we hit up the asian section.  The wonton soup and beef noodle soup was great.  The beef soup was pretty much like pho and was close to being authentic.  I think it helped us and our cold. ^^ We also got a plate full of shrimp.  The shrimp were pretty large in size and you can't really go wrong with lemon and cocktail sauce. Also, a part of the asian section was the chinese and japanese corner.  They were pretty ordinary, nothing too special.  The chinese noodles were dry, fried rice was bland and sushi was mediocre.  The highlight of the dining experience was probably the gelato.  We got a scoop of sugar-free pistachio, mango and watermelon.  The pistachio was the best, followed by the mango.  We also had some fruit that wasn't too bad.  The cantaloupe was sweet.  Overall, it did its job of feeding us late at night.  I do not think that we will be returning to the Mirage just for the Buffet, I think we will stick to the Wynn. :)",

The swordfish they had was disgusting and very dry.  They did have tossed salads and made to order paninis, but I consider that something that is more suiteable for lunch. The prime rib was OK at best,   The environment is nice though, all the tables are spread apart so you can actually have a conversation. Its well lit as well. Only if the food wasn't so crappy..",

    "text": "This was the first buffet I have tried in Vegas, and we chose it because the Tix4Tonight crew had suggested it several times.  It just wasn't that good.  I thought that the carving station was pretty good, and the sushi was ok.  There's not a lot of attention given to the pasta and pizza.  They are just not going to change it out until it's gone, and it sits for a long time.  Crab legs were ok, but were very small.  Desserts were not good; best dessert was the frozen yogurt. How do you mess up carrot cake, people?",

Buffets serve one purpose in Vegas, and that is awesome hangover food and sitting there for hours just basking in seconds and thirds and the general gluttony that is Sin City.   The brunch price is pretty much the same as other places but the food quality is horrendous. Granted, there is a lot of variety, but I would rather have less of better food than a lot of crappy food. The dessert was like half tofu-based or something. The pho was borderline insulting. The best thing is probably the seafood bar where I loaded up on cocktail shrimp and crab legs, except the crab legs are stringy, tough and way too salty. Did they pick this up straight up from the ocean and dunked it back in sea water? Gross.   Bottom line, this is not worth the line and someone really needs to teach the cooks to, well, cook. Ugh.",

There is a large selection of items but the best ones were the Asian food and some of the seafood.  None of the food however is outstanding.  The deserts and other items are missing something, maybe they are made from a box instead of from scratch.  If you are really hungry and have some time on your hands, it might be a good option but you might be better on spending your money at a restaurant where the food will be higher quality.",

I wish someone would have told us :-( The food was sectioned into region and it was all mediocre. The carving station didn't have many options for meat and the italian station didn't have much in the way of pasta... it had some really not good osso buco. The best part was the potstickers. I love potstickers. I'm always disappointed when I go to buffets, and yet I still go to multiple buffets on each vegas trip. I would recommend to everyone (and myself) to go eat at some of the nicer restaurants with the money saved not eating at buffets. Now I just have to remember that on my next Vegas trip.",

    "text": "Oh I really enjoy this buffet....  In the past I never really enjoyed the buffet at Mirage, but ever since Cravings buffet was established I've became a fan of this place...  The decor is sophisticated at it's best.. all the nice LCD TVs along the entry way showing a slow motion of an egg being dropped into a pile of flour.... awesome way to start a buffet!  (lots of other food related video clips for your enjoyment!)  Here are the typical review section for a buffet...  Pizza:  Pretty good.. probably about as on par as CPKs... so pizza lovers will enjoy.  Carving station:  Prime Rib and Ham.... decent prime rib as it was more red than how I've liked it, but the server was nice enough to carve the other side for me and was very attentive!  Definitely a plus!  Mexican food section:  Had some breakfast burrito but didn't taste that great.. pretty dry in preparation so decided to past on this section for the rest of the time there.  Cold seafood:  Had snow crab legs and shrimp cocktail for brunch!  Cool!  I didn't really eat too much of this because it seemed too early for me for crab legs but others were diggin this!  Hot seafood:  Had some paella, pesto cream mussels, and some salmon... they were all fair tasting.  Special metal room for fresh Chinese noodles!  This was my favorite!  A chef is inside this steel room cooking fresh noodles with the options of wonton soup or beef stew soup.... had some gyoza and also few dim sum servings (little shrimp wrapped in rice paper), all very tasty!  The best part was hot roast duck and BBQ pork to go along with the noodle soup!  YUM!!!  Definitely my favorite!  Chinese food section:  Not a big fan... bored of all the orange chicken that everyone is serving and beef with broccoli, I think I will past for sure..... (But the egg drop duck soup was very delicious!  Not salty yet sweet tasting!  Add some scallions and cilantros and you are definitely good to go here!)  Crepe station:  Fresh peach / peach cream crepe.... wow!  One of the best  crepes I've had in a while as the cream reminded me of Beard Papa's except is a little bit tarty..... but not overly sweet and just right...  Crepes were made to perfection so it turned out awesome!  Had to share it with everyone though.. couldn't finish this large chunk of heaven!  Salad station:  Skipped this because I was getting really full, but noticed that they had fresh made Paninis if requested.... so for those of you who like to take a little snack out of the buffet for later.. this option would be great as those sandwiches looked healthy and wonderful!  I'll give it a try next time!  Dessert station:  By this time I'm ready to faint..... but had to pull myself to take a look.... took a sugar free cheesecake and that's about it... not bad.....  Had to end the meal with ice cream though... so grapefruit gelato was on my menu to clean up my palate.....  Cravings...... I can't crave you anymore for today.... maybe another time.....",

With that being said - $18 for a western omelet and a glass of water is a little crazy - not the buffets fault - but it still rubs me wrong.  As far as the food is concerned - or should I say the omelet - average nothing to write home about.

We won't ever go back.  They have ditched some food stations to install vending style machines for your now self service beverages,  the table service is gone. I would estimate 1/3 of the food choices are gone,  what remains is marginal,  the Prime Rib still isn't Prime Rib,  but the shrimp are still good ,and still peeled,  . . . for now.

I've had the mimosa brunch with my girls and on a holiday weekend it runs 30 something which is typical.   Lots of seafood with the crab legs dipped in butter, shrimp cocktail, and the sushi.  The sushi is okay but they have soy wrapping so that's neat.   I LOVE that they have PHO here!  They have someone behind the counter where you can order that from.  They have dim sum too.   I love the omelette station because of the many toppings you can put in it.   The salad section and sandwich section is great too because you can order it and they will prepare it for you.   The desert is somewhat slim and I settle for the gelato- which they had more cakes and what not.   You will love this place!",

U want a drink you have to get it yourself. The service sucked. Everyone had an attitude problem. I didn't pay 150$ to get a rude ass reply on why I have to walk a mile to get an ice cube. The food was gross and very cold. Even the cookies were burned and rock hard. As a vegetarian I picked to eat here so everyone can find something to eat. Boy was I wrong. The trays were empty the ones that weren't had no labels on it so you had no idea what you were even eating.  I went to get a slice of pizza cause that's all I could find to eat and to my surprise everything had meat on it. Five pizza all ham...I asked him for plain cheese and his rude ass told me to get what's there. This place is a joke. I will never come here again. Worst service worst buffet worst restaurant. ..just worst everything in the state of Nevada. I'm disgusted.",

I basically ate cheese, crackers and salami, along with the stir-fry  veggies. Everything else was gross and a waste.   I cannot stress enough what a waste of money this place is.

    "text": "Cravings, like The Mirage as a whole,  is FAR BELOW the standard of quality one tends to expect from the better known hotels on the Las Vegas Strip. I cannot fathom how anyone could give this place above one star. My only guess would be that those reviewers just spent a decade or more in prison, and Cravings was the first place they decided to eat upon being released.   My boyfriend and I took samples from the majority of the stations and did not find one morsel of quality food. My slice of prime rib was full of fatty pockets, my steamed rice was stale and hard. I mean, seriously, how does one go about messing up steamed rice?? The pizza was flavorless with crust like cardboard and sauce that tasted like ketchup with basil in it. You could find better quality food at Jack in the Box at 3 in the morning on a tuesday night.  The one good thing I can say about this place is that our waiter, Dan was very nice and our drinks were always filled. Good looking out Dan, you're a diamond in some deep, DEEP rough.  To sum up my experience at Cravings Buffet at The Mirage in two words: NEVER AGAIN!!!",

    "text": "I'm inclined to go lower on my rating, but I have to review the buffet for what it is, a buffet.  First thing, they GOUGED us on price because it was Memorial Day weekend.  My girlfriend paid, so I didn't see the cost til it was too late.  That put a bit of a damper on things, because I was ticked from the get-go.  I don't even want to say what we paid, because it's embarrassing.  We really should have walked out and gone to STK or something, it wouldn't have been much more.  So, let's start with the \"good\": Our server was VERY nice!  She was a doll and should really be serving somewhere better.  The pot-stickers and shrimp/pork dumplings were edible.  In fact, with a little Sriracha, they were pretty good.  The chilled shrimp and crab legs, on this day, were perfect.  The legs weren't huge but they were nicely split and easy to access the meat, so it made them easy to eat.  I really should have just stopped there.  OH, actually, the prime rib was decent.  Actually, when we got some fresh out of the over, it was really tasty.  Cooked just right, amazingly enough.  There, I should have stopped there.  The \"bad\": The chinese food was crap.  Worst garlic beef, ever.  Chewy, nasty pieces of meat and the sauce was like gelatin.  The breakfast options must have been sitting out for hours.  The eggs had a crust on them 1/2\" thick.  I couldn't even force myself to get any.  The bacon had been sitting for a while too and had gotten soggy.  HOW does bacon get soggy???  And the desserts?  If it wasn't for some OK gelato, I would have gone all Hulk on this place for the crap desserts.  The chocolate cheesecake actually made me physically sad.  And then the \"key lime pie\" made me really mad.  Bah, I don't want to talk about this anymore, it's just depressing me.  My recommendation, avoid the buffets.  Unless it's at a very high end establishment and they have freshly prepared food items, it's just not worth it.  Oh, and it wrecked me, my girlfriend and her kids for two days.  Thanks for the GI tract cramping, Cravings buffet!",

I think the all you can drink beer and wine is there to help you forget how much you paid for something so mediocre.  There are much better places for the money.",

We also wanted to try the Italian section but we could only handle a slice of pizza as we were already stuffed but the pizza was great. They also have a spot where a chef will cook the pasta of your choice in front of you which is really neat. The drinks included unlimited wine, beer, and soda which was great. We ended this yummy buffet with a great selection of deserts. Oh and the man who was clearing our tables was very impressive!",

Nonetheless, there are some good selections here if you look hard enough.  I knew I wouldn't have eggs for a week and got them to make an omelette with everything with guacamole(from the Mexican table). The prime rib and the spiced rapini were great. Wine and beer are included. I usually drink white wine and they had moscato and chardonnay. I opted for the latter option. My drinks were coffee and grapefruit juice. They have a soft drink machine as well for whatever soft drink you want.   The clam chowder, miso soup and smoked salmon weren't bad. The sushi selection was awful.   Unfortunately, there aren't many good dessert options and no ice cream either. Only frozen yogurt.   You can tell that I didn't try everything because like I said, there aren't many amazing options but $25 for AYCE isn't bad. However, I probably wouldn't come back because I chose this buffet due to it being close by. Atmosphere was plain.",

We were told there would be an additional fee if we were to be sat at the same table.  We said \"Two tables beside one another would be fine. They wouldn't do it.  We said \"Same section?\"  Nope.  Wanted more money.  It seemed odd as there were so many empty tables around. They sat us in separate sections.  Talked to the Manager on shift and the thing that I came away with is that he had no authority to say 'Yes'.  He could care less and just wanted to get away from me.  Even the waiters and bussers seemed beat down.  There was no pleasure or smiling faces on the staff.  In the future, my money goes to the restaurants that are run by folks that care or at least pretend to.   When you pay in advance for a brunch, the incentive to perform well is diminished.  So many different options in Las Vegas, this should not be one.   If you do choose to go, once you have 'left the building' ask yourself if I wasn;t right?",

We got BOGO deal through MyVegas for dinner totaling $33 plus tips for the server and bartender.   This is one of the only few buffets that have free alcohol (tap goose IPA, bud light,  and three colors for wine).  There's a separate station for all the different food themes. There was prime rib, roast whole chicken, kielbasa sausage, shrimp,  and crab legs when we went.   I love soup,  so I truly appreciated how each cuisines had one out two soups at their station.   The sushi was not the best,  the rice was to mooshy and compacted. But I really enjoyed the inari, kimichi, edamame, and cucumber salad.  For Chinese the standout was the wonton soup!  Wow!  I also really liked the corn chowder from the Italian station.   Remember to save room for dessert!  I wish I started from the dessert section. There was variations of cookies,  gelato station,  fresh fruits,  tarts,  creme brulees, mini pies, and beautifully designed pudding shooters!  Absolutely marvelous!   Our server was very fast in clearing our never ending dirty plates,  even was helpful in planning our transportation for the night!

    "text": "A group of us ate here for their champagne brunch on a Sunday. The wait wasn't too bad - maybe 15 minutes to pay and get seated - but that's because this definitely isn't one of the better buffets on the Strip. That said, having not eaten at Cravings in a while, my two biggest observations are that I love what they're doing with the drinks now, but the food has definitely gone downhill since my previous experiences here.  With tax and the alcohol option, the price was about $37 per person, and I definitely got my money's worth with the mimosas :) The prime rib was pretty good (the first round I had was great, though the second round was slightly overcooked for 'medium rare'). Unfortunately the eggs benedict were low quality (mostly due to the bland Hollandaise sauce) and the pork bun I had had been sitting out so long that I couldn't take more than one bite of it. That said, the rest of the people in my group thought that their food choices were good - nothing special, but better than low-level buffet food.  Now, they used to bring drinks to the table, but at some point since my last visit to Cravings (which was, admittedly, several years ago) they added drink machines AND a full bar, which I love. No more waiting for someone to come around to fill your drinks, and since I especially drink a LOT of water, this is, to me, a far better option than drink waiter service.  And again, the fact that there wasn't a long wait like there is for the more popular/better buffets and that the alcohol option was worth it made it a great experience.",

Learn from mistakes much? No, eh.   This place is even worse than before. Now they have coffee machines and soda machines like a cafeteria. We went during breakfast so it was just the breakfast spread. Like the cardboard thick dense waffle, typical bacon, blah.  The good thing was the omelette station - but EVERY buffet pretty much has an omelette station. Also they had a pan of egg whites. I had a very egg-heavy breakfast. My friend said there was free alcohol. I didn't think so, but even if there were, I didn't want it in the morning.  The server gave us napkins and took away our dishes like she was doing us a favor.   Like catching a 2nd movie in a theatre, we could have theoretically stayed into the lunch service since they started to bring out the other foods while we still sat there. But no-thank-you. I would rather not eat than eat more at this buffet.",

They are adding another section that's currently under construction.   Plus!!! For the price of the dinner buffet, $35, its unlimited beer, cider and wine!!!   If you play myVEGAS rewards game you can earn the bogo for dinner at 13,000 points.",

I don't know if I'll come Back but it was just all right. Good coffee. Big drink station. Everything self serve. Fresh made pasta station was confusing I didn't see a menu of choices. One kind of crab and it was dry so has been sitting out for a while. Skip the Asian it's terrible. Soups were decent. Sushi was just ok. Meats were ok. I only found one dessert I actually liked and finished. Over unremarkable. We thought to try due to bogo coupon but still even at 35 bucks for 2 people I've had better buffets back home.",

I decided to go to the sushi bar and grab a few. The sushi had no flavor, dull, bland, and seemed old.    The food was cold  not a good selection to choose from and their deserts were to laugh at.  I think my local Home Town Buffet has a better selection and much fresher. I can say the only item that was good was their prime rib.  It melts in your mouth.  But that is it.     I will not return.  You do not get what you pay for at this place.  Give it a try and you'll see that their food is not that fresh.  The quality and their selection is to laugh at.",

Brunch was about $22 per person but that included an unlimited supply of mimosas (the diva in me can't start the day without one while on the road) and an all you can eat buffet that had you sampling wares from all over the world.

The waffles were hardened and the seafood was obviously frozen for too long or something.  Bad bad bad.  I was hoping to drown my sorrows in the champagne but the waitress took so long I was only able to get two of them at all.  The only good thing in the place was the freshly made omelettes.  But seriously, the buffet at Terrible's Hotel & Casino was way better for half the price.  And that's not even a good one either.",

Lots of selection and the bottomless champagne make it a great way to spend a Saturday or Sunday morning.  They open at 8 AM and it's a good idea to get there as early as you can.  Great sushi, custom salads, Asian food, ham, omelette's, etc.  There will be something for everyone here and for $26.95 (includes champagne), it's hard to beat the value in Vegas.  Without the champagne, the buffet is $6 cheaper.  This is not the best brunch in town (Bally's Sterling brunch $85 per person), but it's top notch and deserves the 5 stars I'm giving it.",

You don't give me my bottled water, off with your head (or .75 of a star in this case)!  I'm being generous because I can't complain about the food or the service.

Cravings Buffet seemed simple enough, price was decent, and would allow us to load up as necessary to sustain us throughout the day considering bar food was all that was in our future.  First thing you're going to want to know about this place is that it's closer to your neighborhood buffet than a True Vegas buffet. Is there an omelet bar? Yes. Is there cold seafood, including crab legs? Undoubtedly. Does it have a meat carving station? Absolutely. But that's about where it ends as far as \"Vegas\" is concerned.  Everything else is fair to middling, with plenty of different cuisine options depending on what you're in the mood for. You can get multiple breakfast options at the same time you can get Chinese food at the same time you can get a sliver of a breakfast burrito. God, what a country.  There's a \"server\" but they're really just there to point you in the direction of the drink dispensers. Old plates are cleared fairly quickly.  I think it's fair to say that Cravings Buffet will get the job done for the price but that you should look for a much better option elsewhere.",

Customer service was good. Someone was constantly coming around, so there were never used plates left on our table.  Buffet's in Vegas can be a hit or miss, and you will most probably overeat!  I don't think I would pay full price to come here, but definitely worth it if you got them MyVegas coupons!",

However it's almost like they have too many options so none are amazing.  We tried all the different \"themes\" and there was probably something pretty good at each one but nothing amazing and quite a few misses.  But the location is good and the drinks are unlimited. That's basically worth the buffet itself.",

Dinner buffet also includes all you can drink beer and wine which was nice, and you can carry a beverage out in a plastic cup to go as well.   All the food was pretty basic, but the prime rib was delicious and the only thing I usually eat at buffets anyways so it was fine. The last time I was here a few years back they had a chef personally making the wonton noodle soup bowls, but now it's just sitting out in a big bowl which wasn't as good because the noodles got soft. I had a mini cobbler with vanilla soft serve for dinner which was good.   Overall it's a decent place to grab dinner if you're staying at the Mirage or there to see the Beatles LOVE show like I was.",

There was an omelette station.. looks very understaffed in that station because there was a long line and the line was moving very very slow.  It was just regular breakfast buffet!! It serves different types of meat and housemade eggs and/or potatoes or pizza if you want.. and there are station where it serves different types of cheese, pair it with crackers, preservative meat like smoked salmon . They have a variety of food to choose for breakfast and it's filling and worth it!  It's worth it because regular breakfast is like $16 per person in regular brunch places but with tips it's around $19-20 per person. So u might as well just come here and eat an variety of food.",

The area is open and the stations are arranged in a big circle with seating in the middle. The food was pretty good. They have a variety of stations such as Asian, American, Latin, Fish, carving station, Italian, and a chef's station where they will make you custom pieces. Beer and wine is included, which is definitely a pro. Everything I tasted was good except I didn't personally prefer the flavor of the sausage at the carving station. Their desserts were delicious too...I especially enjoyed the warm blackberry cobbler and coconut macaroons.",

It was an additional $12. The food selection was so small compared to other buffets and my past experiences there. It cost me $25 for my 6 year old to eat a plate of pasta and a roll. She is a picky eater but they didn't have things that you would expect. Fried chicken, orange chicken, mac and cheese. The food was old tasting and the sushi was warm. The crab leg tray sat empty and the endless drinks were impossible to get because there was only one bartender and he spent so much time talking to his bud at the bar. Definitely will never be back!

How can you say no to a cheap/free buffet? You don't.   It's not the newest Buffet on the Strip and it's starting to show. Most menu items don't state if they're gluten free or vegan, they don't offer individual plated items like the trendy Wicked Spoon or Bacchanal Buffet, and they'll laugh if you ask for fresh pressed juice. Most of the food here is just average, with me continuing in search to find a menu item to write home about.  With that said, they do have some amazing perks to lure Yelpers who see their 3 star review to stop by. First of all they offer unlimited wine and select beer. Yes, unlimited. It's not an additional $14 per person which is the average around the Strip, it's included in your Buffet price! Compared to the $14-$27 drinks by the pool, it's worth it to stop by Cravings beforehand for a few drinks while enjoying your DIY fruit and cheese plate.   Is it the best buffet in Vegas? No. But compared to prices for alcohol and light snacks in the area, dropping $11 (discounted from Tix4Tonight across the street) for an AYCE buffet, its still a steal. Go in with low expectations and you'll find a few reasons to leave happy. Best of all they do offer a variety of gluten free items and are willing to make anything gluten free if you ask - even pancakes, pizza and fried chicken sliders! Just ask!",

She was evil and lied and said there was no more mimosas yet she gave the party after me more RIGHT after and gave me a Bloody Mary instead. She told me I couldn't have more than one mimosa at a time, but gave this Hispanic man right after two that he was allowed to carry back at his table. She had brown short hair to her shoulders  (light brown highlights ) maybe in her 30s? She was rude and disrespectful and made the experience terrible.

NO ICE CREAM, but yogurt only. Dessert selection is a D- or F grade in my book. It's Sad, not a fun way to end a meal.  For the price, try to get the BOGO, that's the best value to go here for. Otherwise, for dinner on a weekday at $29.99 isn't too bad for a buffet on the Strip, but not a good value when you can spend a little more and get better variety at other buffets on the Strip with better Desserts.",

The had some pulled pork sliders on one of the days that were tasty. They have prime rib for lunch and dinner.  Oh, they brought out the crab legs promptly at 3pm (for those like me who came in at 2:59PM for lunch prices).  I did have trouble finding condiments like ketchup or tarter sauce.   It has unlimited soda, draft beer or very very very cheap wine.  The sushi section was just okay.  When they had real fish on it (like Tuna Nigri) the portions were extra small.  They had a few different rolls made up with the fake krab stuff that I personally don't like.  Also, there wasn't any cups to hold your soy sauce and wasabi.  The bread pudding, which I understand is a custom recipe to the Mirage was really good with vanilla sauce.  I  thought the rest of the pre-made desserts were just okay.  I would say 3.5 stars.  Oh, right now (nov 2018) the Mirage has a veterans program that upgrades your card to Pearl level which gets you in the VIP line for the buffet and free parking.  Just a thought.",

I didn't think the food was really that great. The food didn't really taste good to me, nor really appeal to me. A lot of the food was pretty dry and quite disappointing. But my husband did thoroughly enjoy his crab and shrimp though.  Anyways, like any other buffet in Vegas, there are plenty of food choices to choose from. There is a dessert section, an Asian section (pho is actually served but I didn't try it so don't know if it was any good or not), a Latin section, a carving section, a salad section, a seafood section, an Indian section and so on. The decor is nice and simple. Generally everything is pretty clean and our server was very friendly and chit chatty. She was really nice at suggesting places for us to go and asked how our stay was at the hotel we were staying at (Alexis Park Hotel, which is 1 mile away from the strip). She was great at clearing our dirty dishes quickly and refilling our drinks. She also was really nice in giving my husband a cup of beer to take with us when we finished our meal and were ready to walk off some of the weight we just gained on the strip.   Oh and by the way, there are no restrooms inside the actual buffet but located right next door (so you will have to walk outside of the buffet and come on back... and you'll have to remind the people at the front).  For the discounted price we paid, the buffet was just fine at feeding the 2 of us. But if we were to pay the full price per person, I would rate the buffet even lower.   Oh and in case you are wondering, I probably would not come back.",

It wasn't as bad as the buffet at Paris, which is a completely different review. The buffet offered lots of cheap food nicely presented and most items lacked a palatable meat component. The bowtie pasta had no meat, the hunan chicken was mostly vegetables. This is a review of the champagne brunch only so maybe they held back until dinner time.  I arrived back to my table only to notice the plate was full of low quality sausage and carbs. Where the heck was the meat? Did I miss a whole section? I don't like prime rib at a buffet, considering you can't throw a stick without hitting a steakhouse in Vegas so I came here for variety.  I can't eat shellfish so I lost 2 out of 9 whole sections there.  Cravings offers a mid-range price for middle of the road tastes and satiates a seafood fix, but otherwise I'd pass.  Lastly, I did use a TravelZoo deal and was unaware they charge you tax on top of the deal. It wasn't the fact that it was $2 extra it was partly the fact they waited til I got to the door to tell me and the cashier was useless. She immediately states \"want to speak to a manager?\" as if it's not her problem and she has no explanation. Why bother? Does anyone else feel like whenever a place uses deal sites the service and selection changes?",

The servers used to take your drink orders and keep your soft drinks refilled.  Gone is a way to help them get more tips.    Also the cooking stations are noticeably smaller than my last visit.  There is a lot more empty wall space in between the stations.  The salad station used to have an attendant that would assemble and toss salads to order.   Gone.  Mirage, if you are listening, please stop cutting staff positions!",

Well you can call it BBQ if all you like is baby back ribs and potatoes. I gave it star instead of 2 because the staff was friendly and the dessert were good",

The only problem, which is a deal breaker for who ever you are, is that we were sat next to these loud cholas and cholo who were cussing and yelling, that could be heard from across the buffet... Which is reasonably large. Their topic of discussion was wanting to have MORE children with their significant others while they were dealing with cheating spouses and other terribly inappropriate topics.   Our waiter, Alex, had asked them to keep it down once, but then they started speaking Spanish with Alex and they started joking around. Soon enough, the waiter ignored their rowdiness and my lady and I ended up listening to grotesque details of the unfortunate souls we were sitting next to.   All in all, the food and price for a place can be the best in town. If the staff has the lack of respect for the consideration of the customer as a whole, then the business shouldn't be rated anything better than a brothel where STD's run a muck. Because quite honestly, that's how I felt after enduring these people's loud, annoying conversation.",

I wish we would have waited and came another day when the food was fresher and more plentiful.  The one thing that I can not resist is dessert and this place did a great job in providing options.  You can never go wrong with hitting someones sweet tooth I loved the presentation and taste.  Our server (forgot her name) was also amazing!

We booked through Expedia and they offered 2 free buffets with the stay so we went for brunch on Sunday morning.  Brunch on Sat-Sun come with unlimited mimosas so that was the way to start the morning off!  First thing is first...no waiting lines at all!  Everyone packs out the Bacchanal, Wicked Spoon, and other buffets.  So, this was a big plus!  Onto the food...  Wow!  I would have paid the $30 bucks for this!  I'm not a huge fan of buffets and I've tried most here in Vegas, and this was right there at the top.  It didn't have quite the selection as a Bacchanal, but what was there was just as tasty.  They had omelets made to order, a large breakfast selection including really good eggs benedict, a really tasty Mexican section, cold crab legs, loads of boiled shrimp, an Asian section, sushi section, cold cuts/charcuterie section, and a really nice dessert selection.  Servers were great and kept the plates off the table and the mimosa and coffee cups full at all times.  I was pleasantly surprised with Cravings and everyone with me said it was just as good as Bacchanal, which is quite the complement.",

I read reviews that the \"live\" stations were good, but what I experienced was pretty sad for a supposed \"upper tier\" buffet.  The wait to start the buffet wasn't too bad, about 8 minutes or so. It was a Wednesday around 1:00 pm.  It's like a giant horse shoe layout with a very odd and VERY limited amount of choices. Very spread out. It started with so so pizza, a few pasta dishes I just wasn't interested in and a carving station that had prime rib and turkey, (which wasn't bad, to be fair).   Next was the lame taco bar which really seemed out of place and again slim pickin's.  Then there were a few odd fish choices, but nothing that really looked to good. The Chinese dumplings were one of the few highlights.   The sushi was pathetic. No actual fish to be found. Argh  There was a somewhat okay cold cut and cheese selection though with a few nice salads and the gelato was excellent. The dessert plates were pretty good.  The wait staff was attentive and did take care of the beverage needs well.  But, over all, I wouldn't spend 19.99 plus tax per person on this lunch again.  I guess I should have gone to the Bellagio.  Oh well, live and learn.",

Booked a vacation package through Southwest which included a free buffet for each day we were staying at the Mirage. We did the breakfast buffet on the first day, then the breakfast/lunch buffet on the second day (the third day we got wise and went down to the Aria buffet). The service both times at Cravings was absolutely terrible. We were a party ot 7 and had to practically beg to have our drinks refilled. My empty plates were never cleared...so we just piled them up wherever we could. The server never made a point to apologize for the service and was not friendly whatsoever.  The food was average. It seems to me that they've cheapened the quality of the food (especially the baked goods) and I truly expected more from this Vegas buffet. I honestly can't remember much about the food except for the gelato, which was delicious.   I'm sad to say I don't plan on going back to the Cravings buffet again.",

Our server...well, he might be a great server to some other tables. But to us, he's certainly one of the worst! His name is Luis. You're lucky if you're a Caucasian. If you're not, you're out of luck. (We're Asians by the way) We saw him asking other tables if they were doing okay, and kept giving refills without them asking, and with a smile on his face. What about us? We were NEVER asked how we were doing. We NEVER got refills without asking. We waited for a while on purpose, wanting to see if he'd give us refills. NOOOO... He'd be holding a bottle of champagne, walking by, without looking at us at all. Finally I couldn't hold it anymore. I said \"excuse me\" out loud, and he gave us refills. But he had this really bad I-don't-wanna-serve-you look on his face. My girlfriend asked for some coffee. He didn't respond to that at all!!!! He did bring it out, but he never said thank you or you're welcome to us! NEVER!  Servers earn most of their money from tips. How can you give such poor service?! Well, we got some changes when we were coming in...there goes your tips, Luis!",

All the food is high quality and there is so much to choose from. We had a few vegetarians and one vegan and all were very satisfied, so that says something.   I picked this out for a group of 21(!!!) girl friends and we were SO happy; they couldn't stop praising me! Also a huge plus, they sat us all together!

Food was very good overall and salad actually mixed for you, if you want. Shrimp, fish, and veggies were excellent. Only thing that I was slightly disappointed in was their cheeses. I didn't expect a varied selection of cheeses but since it was there, I was excited. But, most of the cheese selections were pretty bland and it appeared had been sitting out for awhile.

LOL. Great quality & wide variety & fair pricing. I liked everything I had for brunch. A few items to highlight: freshly made - in plain view - brick over pizza, freshly-made on-site gellato ice cream with a nice variety of toppings. Fresh, custom salads & omelettes & sundaes are made for you while you wait.   The one thing that could have satisfied me more was a better variety of sushi. They offered 5 basic options of sushi rolls on par with what you could get from the supermarket, BUT I won't hold that against them.   I would definitely recommend Cravings & I will definitely return.",

Everything I had was tasty and well made, down to the onion ring which was flavorful and still crunchy.  The sushi was even tasty, normally buffet sushi is crap. The crab legs were sweet, prime rib juicy and even the broccoli had some spice that made me super pleased.  The only thing that didn't beat my expectations was the egg roll which was weak on the filler. The desert section was no joke and all my selections were yummy.  The creme brulee was actually perfect,  like they just made it. I've had a ton of mediocre and crap buffets but this one surprised me with every bite. Free wine and beer doesn't hurt either.",

It was about 20 bucks each for lunch. We were seated right away and had a very nice server who was very quick with the refills. She even put our kiddos juice into a cup with lid/straw. Its a really big buffet..alot of walking around to see all they have..which is alot. I was impressed with the spread. They had some really large shrimp and a nice BBQ section. The only thing that was not that great was the dessert selection. But I did try the bread pudding and it was pretty good.

Once we were seated, we were very surprised to find the restaurant almost empty. I don't understand the wait if the restaurant is barely half full. Empty tables everywhere.   Food was mostly average, however the clam chowder, make your own tacos (especially loved the fresh guacamole), and tamales were really good. They also have a pasta cooking station which was good. They didn't have a menu or list indicating which pasta types, sauces, or other ingredients you can add to your pasta which was very unpractical. You'd have to peek into the cooking station to try and get a glimpse of what's available. I had bowtie pasta with alfredo sauce, pesto, and bacon.   Crab legs were small and dry, prosciutto and cheeses were dry (you can tell they've been left out a while - maybe since breakfast or lunch), ribs were dry (sauce was good though, so it's a shame the meat was so dry), pizza tasted old.   Dessert was super meh. Small selection and all of it tasted stale (pastries, cookies, and cakes were all very dry). Only decent thing were the mini cupcakes (the kind you buy in a 12-pack at the grocery store...)  Servers were good with clearing dirty plates.   Overall, I would not return to this buffet unless it was super cheap (which it isn't).",

EVERY PERSON that worked at that buffet THANKED us for our BUSINESS and not one other buffet went out of their way to smile and make sure we knew were appreciated.  This blew my mind!  Even the garbage taker outers all the way to the CHEF made sure they thanked us when we THANK THEM!!!  The food was great and I rank the Mirage Buffet top 3 Buffets in Vegas.  Aria being #2 and Wynn being #1  But I will stay at Mirage next time I go to Vegas...because also the lobby was breathtaking and it all was entering a beautiful \"story like\" atmosphere.  Very calming and aquariums and plants everywhere and very tastefully designed.  Thank you Mirage!  Las Vegas: The Beatles - Love - Cirque du Soleil  This was so beautiful I wish it went on forever!  Do make sure you go to the bathroom first because you totally are not going to want to leave to take a break at all!!  I HAD to go BUT realized it would be too high profile for me to walk out during the show.  The show makes use of EVERY part of the theater they can, including drawing the audience in and making them feel a \"part of it\" which is genius in and of itself.    Without being a spoiler let me just say the Beatles wrote MORE than you probably even knew or recall!  A total treasure a must do while in Vegas!",

Got discounted tickets thanks to tix4tonight (30% discount!) and paid about $17/person.   Highlights include: wonton soup (extremely popular and therefore frequently empty, seafood soup, and...that's it? Of course you have the prime steak, omelet station, variety of sushi, lox, 20+ desserts, but nothing particularly stood out.  Originally, I wanted to give it 2 stars, but really thinking about it, it wasn't like anything tasted bad... (although the macadamia and choco chip cookies were extremely meh). Friendly service and I'm actually a fan of the self-serving drink station. For the wonton soup that my dad loved and the seafood soup that my mom loved, I'll give this dining hall three stars.",

Other than that, I felt like it should've been better, like 3x better than a $9 buffet.  When I was there Thursday night (June 28, 2018), there was a loud buzzy / alarm-ish sound coming from the ceiling above the cash register area. Not even the large-round-bellied manager did anything about it after he came out of his office.",

Carving station amazing, loved the Latin and salad station. Very good fresh fruit, they will also make you toast if you ask. All breakfast items were nice and fresh, they make eggs and omelettes to order too. Dessert area looked great, but was comfortably full and didn't try the amazing looking donuts. We will definitely visit again next year and maybe try dinner also.",

Selections were so limited in those sections and the desserts' qualities were no more than just any neighborhood buffet level, which is a let down considering this is Vegas. Their best section is the Italian section! Really delicious soup selections and pasta! Don't have much to say but if you're wanting to fulfill your vegas buffet fantasies, this isnt the place, go for bellagio or caesar's palace buffets. But this is a good, affordable, decent place to eat if you want to eat alot but dont really care too much about enjoying a luxurious meal.",

New years so you expect a higher price but also a nice selection. $145 for 3 adults, more than the best of buffets in Reno but we are here vegas, and its the Mirage should be good. Was really poor. Average to poor food quality and really sad selection. Looked like the local salad bar down the street, only carving over cooked beef and a dry little  nub of turkey. Asian station had 3 dishes, italian station had waffles scrambled eggs and only terrible pizza. My little one was like \" thats it, wheres the rest?\" Just not worth your time or money, with all the other choices.",

We arrived at 10.30am and paid $60 for two people (not inclusive of gratuity) to eat 'brunch' which included cold breakfast food, which has probably been sitting there all morning and about 6 other 'cuisines'. It includes unlimited beer and wine but not mimosas? I watched the (quite rude) lady behind the bar pour the 'included' Chardonnay into a flute glass with some orange juice *which is also included*, yet they charged you $6 extra per mimosa - they're kidding. They must have mixed up the tubes in the coffee machine because instead of a cappuccino, we got hot chocolates. Don't waste your money, explore one of the actually decent cafes around Vegas.",

    "text": "This buffet is so underrated in my opinion. Someone in our group recommended this place and I was super surprised at how good it was! I've been to almost every buffet in vegas like wicked spoon at cosmo, bacchanal at ceasars, the buffet at the wynn, etc...and this one was as good if not better than the others! (yes I'm a fatty and proud of it).  Service: Doesn't really matter at a buffet because you serve yourself. In my opinion, my service was excellent, so no complaints. Got up and got food real quick. BUT if you want to be nitpicky, it did take a little while to get seated when the line was short, then it again our group was 18 deep so understandable.  Food: SO MUCH FOOD. The food wrapped around the whole room and it seemed to be endless. So many different food stations. As with all buffets, there was a crab leg section but no lame shortages here, it always seemed to be full of crab legs and no super long lines for it. When I do buffets I like to take a small bite out of every dish, and even doing this I couldn't eat everything I wanted because there was just too much food. Everything tastes fresh and delicious too. And finally there was FREE beer and wine. Not just cheap beer either, it was a house IPA, Heineken, and some other beer that I can't remember; probably because i had too many IPAs and Heinekens.   Place: Upscale, clean, and tons of space. Plenty of room around you to eat and not feel like anyone near you is judging you.  One of the best buffets in vegas in my opinion. PROTIP: Do buffet for lunch instead of dinner so you don't feel terrible about yourself on those vegas nights.",

    "text": "Even though I've been to Las Vegas close to 10 times (annual trips), I've never been to Cravings Buffet so decided to give them a try during my April 2016 vacation since I heard that it was a buffet with all you can drink beer and house wine.  Out of the 4 buffets on the Strip that I experienced during my April 2016 vacation, this buffet was one of the larger buffets. Just for comparison purposes, on this trip, I went to Bacchanal which was the largest and second most expensive, Cravings which is slightly smaller (third expensive), followed by Monte Carlo Buffet (least expensive), and Sterling Brunch (smallest but most expensive).  I can only have 3 beers during a meal so in terms of all you can drink beer, I didn't really drink much. The beer was draft beer and I think I ordered Coors or a Bud Light (I can't remember which I ordered but it was a beer brand that you can get almost anywhere). For the beer and wine, you go to the corner at the right of the buffet and ask for a draft beer or house wine.  This place (just like Monte Carlo's buffet) is self serve for soft drinks. The soft drink machine was one of the higher end ones which allowed things like cherry Coke and allowed you to mix soft drinks with certain flavours.  In terms of food, I concentrated mainly on the seafood selection and the carving station. The seafood was good as was the carving station although I found the beef to be too red for my liking. The desserts were good as well.  The servers did a good job for me of taking my plates. Most of the time when I went to get a new plate and returned to my chair, my old plate was removed.  I don't remember the price that I paid to have a late lunch at Cravings Buffet but there was a voucher at the Tix4Tonight booth that you can purchase for Cravings.  I found the buffet to be good and slightly better and more selection than Monte Carlo's buffet (and also slightly more expensive). Since I'm not a heavy beer drinker, for me, it was merely a chance to have a few beers without having to think about any extra costs.  I wouldn't have any issues returning to Cravings in my next Las Vegas trip. However with all the other buffets on the Strip that I haven't tried, nothing really stood out enough for me to say \"I HAVE to return here\".  I would probably rank them 3.5 stars which rounds up on Yelp to 4 stars since half stars aren't allowed and I don't want to shortchange them.",

If you are ok with having lunch type options (pizza, meat carving station, sushi, etc.) then you may like this place. The dessert station looks amazing as there are tons of options but they are very bland tasting. As of September 2019, alcohol is not included in the price and is an additional charge. Luckily we had a buy one, get on half off coupon and we still paid about $75 for 2 people without alcohol option. Also, you are forced to select a tip option when paying but you get your own drinks and not one person interacted with us at our seat. Expected better for a Vegas buffet.",

I also like that unlimited wine and beer which is part of the buffet price.   For a reasonable price, you actually get decent buffet spread. I kept going back to the cioppino station. I honestly think they can do better on their dessert station. I thought it was very limited and mostly a variety of cookies.   Buffet staff are friendly and attentive.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because 3 small things.  1- Their pasta dishes had no flavor. The shrimp scampi was plain spaghetti pasta with a few pieces of shrimp and almost like a bland no flavored butter sauce. The tomato with capers, spinach, and some other random veggies with a fettuccini type pasta was bland as well. The \"baked\" Mac n cheese was very bland too. 2- The Asian food was gross. 3- I got an attitude from the bartender because I walked over there to ask for a straw because I didn't see them anywhere near the drinks.  ---- Everything else was fabulous!!!! The salad bar was great, they even had lunch meat and breads to make sandwiches. The pizza was delicious. The miniature meatball subs were really great. The meatloaf at the carving station was excellent. Many of the sides were very good like the garlic chili broccolini, Spanish rice, green beans with pimientos. The nachos were really good. Fresh tortilla chips, delicious guacamole, thick nacho cheese that wasn't too spicy, pick de gallo, sour cream. Yum. I wish they had some taco meat though as that would have sent the nachos over the top. However, they did have taquitos and you could dip them in all that I said above. I should have plated some taquitos and topped them with lettuce, shredded cheese, and onions all from the salad bar, then added guacamole, sour cream, and pico. Yummmm.  I highly recommend the lunch buffet. It was $25.97 with all tax include or $23.99 for an adult without taxes.",

    "text": "I've been coming to Cravings for quite some time now and while this is definitely one of the smaller buffets than it's MGM counterparts, it is certainly still a good option.   For starters, they're the only MGM buffet that has complimentary house wine and beer unlimited! If that's enough to steer you in their direction, then I don't know what will!  Depending on the day you go, the selection may include their full menu or just a smidgen of it. I have come on both weekdays and weekends and understandably the weekends are much better.   Some key items that are offered are: - prime rib - beef brisket with au jus - paella (needs more spice) - crab legs - crab claws - nacho bar - bread pudding  - espresso bean cake  Overall, I do enjoy my time here at Cravings and would recommend it to those guests staying at Mirage. Pro tip: download the myvegas app so that you can get a free buffet here!  (36/100--2019)",

There was a huge variety of food & obviously you could eat a ton. They had many different stations including, Asian, Italian, Mexican, meat carving & more. It was fun to try different things, but everything was just standard cafeteria food.   Prices are high - you can get your money's worth of you eat & drink a ton, but make sure you come hungry.",

On a whim, Hubby and I decided to stop here before our flight.  We saw the pricing in the tickets for less stand for 10% off outside of the mirage, so we thought why not?  We ended up saving around 12.00 and paid 40 for the two buffets.  We walked right in and were seated right away.  Everything is self serve, including the drinks.  The waitress (rather, woman who cleaned our plates) was beyond friendly and told us that wine and beer was included in our price!!  YES!!!!  She even told us to ask for a to go cup when we were done to get the most for our money.  There were plenty of choices and everything was very tasty.  I loved that they also had their food marked gluten free.  I also asked if they had GF pancakes.  About 10 minutes later a head chef came out with a plate of GF pancakes!!  I was so excited and happy they did that.  Does this have as 'fancy' as items as the high end buffets?  No.  But, I am not a fancy girl and I was super happy with our meal.    We will be back next time we are in Vegas!",

The customer service was excellent and they was also doing a memorial day special for military personnel (active duty or retired).  The food selection was very plentiful, and well seasoned. All the staff was very friendly and helpful. Included in the price was unlimited drinks...which also includes wine and beer. My family was satisfied with this buffet but I don't think that I would return for another visit. I only state this because there are so many more dining options in Vegas.",

Virtually no actual breakfast food, and what's there is mixed in with the lunch food. Powdered scrambled eggs. Eggs Benedicts where the English muffin underneath is so tough, you can't even cut through it. Breakfast meats aren't particularly hot. Nothing has much in the way of flavor, and what does have flavor tastes bad. Even the desserts, which look like they should be good, just aren't. Two different bread puddings are more gelatinous than anything that tastes like bread pudding. Think more of a loose flan. Just bad all around. Of course, when you check in, they'll try to get you to tip for service that's nonexistent. We never actually saw our waitress during the meal. Old plates weren't picked up. Also, you get your own beverages, so why would you tip at a buffet. As soon as the meal was over, I spent an extended stay in the nearby restroom, so read into that what you'd like. Just don't go here. The age of the decent Vegas buffet may have passed. It certainly has at the Mirage.",

We were able to get a good discount by buying buffet tickets at the \"on demand\" ticket booth just outside the Mirage hotel. We paid around $20 per person for lunch. For that, I'd say this place is definitely worth going.  It's always busy in Vegas, so expect to wait in line to go in. There's a lot of variety here, as well as unlimited beer/wine included at the bar (don't forget to tip though). Definitely a fan of the \"carving\" line with prime rib and turkey. The other choices are solid as well including, Italian, Latin, Asian, and desserts. They serve crab legs if you decide to come for dinner.",

You pay before heading in and then are seating in the dining area. Our waitress was super friendly and told us about how beer and wine is unlimited with our buffet. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of options they had (Japanese, Chinese, American, Latin American, Italian) and some of the food was very good quality (sushi rolls and miso soup were okay, egg rolls were good, pleasantly surprised that they had Korean kimchi!). They do not have crab legs for lunch! The soups were good as was the pizza. However, other foods such as the pasta and paella had obviously been left out too long. They also ran out of the fish at some point. I would chose this buffet again only if I was in the area and wanted a variety of  options.",

I read that Cravings was one of the top 10 (or was is top 5) so decided to check it out during lunch.   First off, the price is only $20 AND it includes all you can drink wine and beer (or non alcoholic drinks). The drinks were unexpected and made this a great start for our trip.  They had a person making fresh omelettes but the difference was that it had no meat. No worries, it was great and the guy making them was friendly and carried on fun conversations.  Even though it was around 10:30 or so in them morning, they had both lunch and breakfast.  Goodness, what were my favorites? * Definitely the omelette.  * I was craving a mimosa and since champagne was part of the deal I heard a gentleman order a wine mimosa. Hmmmm??? Had to try this. GOLDEN! The bartender put white wine, orange juice, and then a splash of sparkling water for effect. It hit the spot...well, 2 more hit the spot. ;)  After my 'breakfast' I moved on to Mexican food, and potatoes, and soup. Come on, it's buffet, you can't just have one plate, right?  Our server was constantly picking up plates and was friendly.  I seriously had not complaints.  Recommend this.",

I'm comparing this buffet to the only other Vegas buffer I've been to - the one in the Bellagio - where I paid double the price for a similar or dare I say inferior experience. Cravings was better in my opinion.  I loved the prime rib, brisket, shrimp, and crab legs. A plate or two with these gems more than covers the cost of entrance. If you don't like any of those items, I'd recommend a nice restaurant instead of a buffet.   The best thing about this place is the military discount. It was 40% off for you and up to three guests for a total of 4 people. It was amazing. Definitely worth it. We paid $88 including tip for 4 people at 2:55 pm so we got lunch prices but dinner offerings.   We had a great waiter as well. He was very attentive . For example when our hands were dirty from eating ribs, he grabbed us moist towelettes before we even had to ask. It was great.  The most disappointing part of the buffet for me was the dessert. There were a ton of options, but only a few of them looked appealing.   I would return again and would recommend this buffet to a friend.",

I really don't know what lunch or dinner taste like or if I were to come at 11am instead but breakfast SUCKS! Complete waste of money.  I feel bad for having to drag my bf along to eat a horrible breakfast.  Barf.",

    "text": "So where do you go in Vegas when you have a total of 9 girls in your party and they are all on a budget? A $25 dollar per person buffet seems a little over the top. I mean, how many girls can eat $25 worth of food right?   Well, let me tell you about Cravings! It was honestly the best $25 dollars spent in Vegas this weekend! This place was so amazing I couldn't wait to get home so I could write a Yelp review about it. The selling point was the bottomless complementary Mimosas.   Not only were we drinking endless amounts of Mimosas, we had the best server ever. She never let our champagne glasses reach less than half full. She was on point. While we were being loud and laughing a lot, she continued to have the biggest smile on her face as she contributed to the intoxication of our entire party.   I'm not sure if it was my excitement of being at a buffet or if it was the mimosas, but I had the best breakfast ever. I had prime rib, mashed potatoes, sushi, shrimp cocktail, scallops, a burrito, a slice of pizza, gelato, wild rice, awesome guacamole (and I'm picky about my guac) and the list goes on. Everything at the buffet was amazing. They had an omelet station, a build your own crepe station, a sandwich and panini station, a create your own pasta dish station, Pho soup, sushi, prime rib, great deep dish pizzas and even more. The list is never ending.   The atmosphere was nice. The decor was open and modern. The service was excellent and it was definitely worth $25 per person.   This is going to be my new hot spot to hit up every time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "My friend was visiting in town a few months ago and we decided to go over to Cravings to get some buffet action going on.    I remember the food being alright, if meh, at times.  I DO remember this, it was a bit pricey and they have gelato, and it's not too bad.  They also have AMAZING macaroons!  I ate 4 or 5 of them, and even snuck a couple out with me in my purse.  I had to, they were the best macaroons I've ever had, and I don't really like coconut.  Yeah, I'll eat a macaroon once in a blue moon, but it has to look good, and these, just looked like they'd be good (kind of like a Madeline), I'm soooo glad I went and tried one.  I'll admit I spent most of my enjoyment in the dessert section of the buffet.  I had cakes, and macaroons and gelato....  I remember feeling a bit ill afterwards, like I'd need a long trip to the bathroom, (but that didn't hit me right away), or that I was instantly 8 1/2 months pregnant.....instead, we drove home (luckily not far at all) and my friend was sending me text messages from the bathroom telling me how awesome Cravings treated her....and left her in an awkward sometimes painful experience on the loo.    All in all, it's not the worst, and not the best, yet I've still not been able to find the \"best\" one yet.  Still looking.",

I was pretty much expecting waffles and eggs, but lo and behold: sushi, kimchee, chinese, dim sum, pho & wonton soup/noodle station, seafood, salad bar, mexican, italian, desserts galore, a gelato STATION...  I filled up on shrimp cocktail, daikon salad, sushi, dim sum, freshly prepared pho, fruit, more fruit, and hazelnut gelato.  I want to pout because I can't come back whenever I want...only the next time I want to brave Vegas again.  Thank you Grace for finding this buffet!!",

However, if you find yourself with some complementary buffet vouchers, let the Wycliff flow! Most of the food here is standard buffet, which is to say, bad, but there are some palatable items to be had if you look carefully enough. I went with the gyros, available near the salad bar. Also acceptable-looking were the salads themselves. For dessert, I hunkered down for some frozen instant pudding (or gelato, as they call it around these parts), which tasted good enough. As an aside, I noticed a lot of people putting their faith in the raw bar here, and I haven't heard news of a salmonella outbreak, so that's something. Sparkling wine is complementary, so drink up!",

It just seemed like everything we ate was of lesser quality than we have grown accustomed to at Cravings.  The sushi selection was minimal.  Roast turkey from the carving station was dry.  Brisket from the BBQ station was fatty and tough.  The only things we liked were the crab legs and some pork dumplings from the Asian station.  We actually wondered whether or not there were new chefs or new management.  Having said that, I'm not willing to write this place off after one poor experience when I've had numerous excellent meals here in the past.  I'm sure I'll eat here again, and would still recommend this place to others, albeit with some reservations.",

All eating rules of propriety are thrown out the window--eat as much as you want, fast. Mix whatever you want. Have seven different entrees. Take six desserts and have a bite of each. Really--this was one of the better dining experiences of my life. Make sure you bring along fun/food-happy people, though--it makes all the difference.  The highlight was probably the \"dipping\" portion of our \"appetizer\" section. Tons of chips and crisps and the like, with guacamole, spinach-artichoke, cheese dip, and salsa. Like heaven.  For Las Vegas, reasonably priced, too.",

We decided to do the breakfast buffet because I wanted to do Vegas up right and go to a buffet and I can sometimes be a picky breakfast eater.  The service was appalling. That sounds redundant, it being a buffet and all, but our waitress NEVER came to refill anything. It took forever to get our drinks in the first place. She was horrible. I had to steal a drink from another table.  But the buffet itself blew my mindhole. So many choices. So many delicious things. We were full for the rest of the day after gorging ourselves at this place. Maybe there are better buffets, but this one was the most convenient for us. Not bad prices either, considering the quality of the food and how much of it you can get. Crazy selection. I would go again.",

The food was good - we went on Sunday at 3pm and they were still serving brunch so there were a lot of pancake and egg dishes out which isn't really my thing.  The Chinese food was delicious, not a huge selection, but crazy good.  Awesome green salads - they make them the way they're made at Pluto's in California.  You choose the ingredients, they toss it.  Excellent.  And crab legs and shrimp cocktail - cold and fresh, all you can eat?  Well that was worth the price alone.  It's a buffet but a server brings your drinks.   Awesome, easy free parking behind the Mirage - just take the side street by Treasure Island, drive back to the Mirage, park and walk in.  Once in the Mirage, go through the atrium / jungle area and follow the signs to the buffet.",

I sampled a little bit of everything, and it was meh...nothing special, nothing note worthy. Starting with the pasta station, the sausage was like warm and the cheese ravioli were soggy. Moving on to the carving station, roast turkey was juicy, but tasted like processed turkey breast. The mashed potatoes are clearly powdered, and the gravy had several clumps of gelatinized goop. The corn was tasty. I skipped the seafood due to an allergy. The Mexican bar provided Taco Bell quality cheese sauce and ground beef. Moving forward to the sushi station, as good as you can get for sushi on a buffet, bulk made rolls. As for the Asian station, the pork dumpling and noodle soup was bland and the noodles were undercooked which  is shocking for a buffet soup. The gyoza was dry and hard, and the wonton was stale. They did have descent desserts and included alcohol, so that was a plus. If it wasn't a business trip that was paying for the meal, I would never pay $40 for a buffet that is no better then the finest Quincy's or Golden Corral.",

On the plus side, getting wine from the bar was pretty fast and efficient.  Theres the typical line of buffet foods from each region: Mexican, Italian, Southern, American etc. With the very stereotypical dishes that people think actually come from those regions..  The seats were very uncomfortable... most likely to prevent hordes of the obese from settinling in and eating for the entire dinner or lunch periods. I sort of get that, but most people don't spend hour after hour grazing the buffet, so why should they have to sit uncomfortably?  Bonus points for not having long lines at the different buffet stands.. though I wonder whether that isn't for good reason.",

The meal also came with unlimited wine and beer.   - We came around 8pm, which was a great time for us because we didn't have to wait in line for a while. There was just 1 couple ahead of us. I thought that was pretty good for a Saturday night. It took less than 10min for us to be seated at our table.  - I suggest starting off with the shrimp cocktails and crab legs. The line can get pretty long, but if you time it right, your meal will start off great. The shrimp cocktails are pretty big too compared to Feast Buffet. Crab legs not as meaty as Bellagio.  - Their wanton soup was pretty good but not as good as the Rio Carnival World.  - Prime rib was average like any other buffet like Feast, but there is no grill if you wanted it Med-well or well done like Sam's Town.  - I did enjoy their seafood stew. It had a lot of scallop and clams in it, less small shell bits, few corn.  - Avoid the steamed cod. It was a bit tough and flavorless.  - Do mack on the BBQ spare ribs! It was tender and so saucy! I loved it. It was especially tasty with the creamed corn. I love corn! :D nom nom - The sushi was filler for me so after a few, I didn't bother getting more - Their dim sum was pretty good. I suggest that you should at least grab one of each. Don't get the Ramen though. The noodle tasted like Maruchan. meehhhhh! But I did really like the egg!  - I don't care much for the desserts, but my girlfriend thought it was worth trying. Don't expect to find macarons here though! - Although I did not drink the wine, I did get the beer. The choice was between a Bud Light or a pale ale. Each time I got a drink, there were at least 2 or 3 people ahead of me. I suggest double fisting to reduce the wait time. Haha.  - Friendly service. Clean and fine dining.",

I just came here at buffet and i spoke to one of their lady to ask how busy and what's their holiday pricing (usually pricing is different during the holiday). She seemed nice and she said 28.99 + tax. So I didn't buy the discount coupon from tix4tonight. And then I came here and they said pricing is 36.99. And they blamed me that I should remember the lady's name. Do you usually remember the person's name even if you want to ask the general question? Such Hours and pricing? If the manager knows how to treat customers, or manage his employees, they should give us the rate that she mentioned. I wasnt happy that he treated me and my family like this.",

They don't even bring the drinks to you. In fact the man running the place was extremely rude when we questioned the policy. My first plate was mac and cheese and prime rib. The mac and cheese was mush and the prime rib was extremely tough. Sushi was downright gross and italian foods did not look appealing. Desserts were fine although a few tasted stale.",

It just was too watered down and didn't taste like much of anything even though it looked very cheesy and yum.  Everything else was pretty fantastic that we tried-- prime rib was AMAZING. First cut we had was medium, and it was good but not what we were craving. Then they brought out a more rare cut and it was SO good. You know it's good prime rib though when even the more cooked pieces are still flavorful and easy to chew.   The sushi was yummy as were the soups- the wonton soup was probably our favorite but the scallop chowder was great. The pizza was pretty good as well and the crab legs and shrimp were on point.  The dessert was fantastic!!! Almost didn't have room for it. The chocolate gelato was yummy as well as the creme brulee-- I mean really all of the dessert we had as absolutely delicious.    For $37 a person on Memorial Day weekend AND FREE HOUSE WINE AND BEER!!!!  It was a GREAT deal!",

I must say we were pleasantly surprised by this experience as considering the buffet is cheaper than many others in Vegas the quality was still pretty good especially if you consider that it includes also unlimited drink (sodas, wine and beer).  There are different stations with different types of cuisine and there's also a cook making omelettes to your taste.  The oriental section was good with a nice selection of sushi (that add more variety than other renowned buffets like the Bellagio).  The only disappointment was the dessert station that had a very limited choice compared to other buffets.  Definitely interesting the chance to pay a lower price for a take out option.  If you're looking for a mid-range priced buffet, Cravings is definitely reccomended.",

I do suggest that they put omlete toppings somewhere visible so people know what the options are or at least put up a sign/ menubof choices.     1/2 of my bloody Marys.    The first and last ones ordered was just from a mix and just tasted like tomato,  the others the bar tender put mix and vodka   The seafood soup-tomoato based.   I had clams,  muscles,  squid and a nice broth.     Oysters were good  Salad bar- cute bowls... I just suggest they work on the order of getting items.   Most people make their salads by putting lettuce,  toppings then dressing.   Having the dressings in the middle causes lots of akward bumping around.     Chicken fried steak is good,  but the gravy needs work.   It taste like the flour hasn't been cooked through  so not so pleasant.   The meat and cheese station had a good selection... But no bagles to go with the lox   Nice big beverage section,  not sure if it is too big  Granted I did not eat everything  What needs work,  besides what was mentioned above  Breakfast items,  scattered all over the place.   It would be nice if they were put together more.     Scrambled eggs looked unappealing ..i didn't get them,  but while standing in line for an omelet another lady showed her friend and it did look like tofu and were wiggly.    Sushi rice is hard,  taste like store bought.    Extra paper napkins would be nice to put my fork and knife on.   I will not leave on a table so my cloth napkin looked like a little kid used it.   Like I said I did not eat everything thing.  It is decent but needs some improvements",

We decided to have lunch at Cravings and will probably will never return if ever at the Mirage hotel again.  We received a discount as part of the conference we were attended (which we have to fight over with the cashier who did not want to honor it). Anyhow, we eventually sat down and proceed to sample the different cuisines they offer (American, Asian, Italian, and so on). The food was average at best, most of the pasta was dry and overcooked and most of the food just did not look fresh and appetizing. The crab was dry and seemed old and hardly any meat!  The best part of Cravings was the generous servings of the carved meats and the \"Chef's Corner\" where, unlike the other serving stations, you could received fresh pasta cooked your way. The dessert selection was ample however, most of the desserts were note very good but with the exemption of a very few. We felt a like a \"Piccadilly Cafeteria\" restaurant experience and not one worthy of the Mirage hotel and Las Vegas but I guess, based on the price, it was reasonable. This is a place for a quick lunch with the kids but do not expect a famous Las Vegas buffet experience here. You get what you pay for!",

The food looked good BUT when we started eating it, it was obvious the food had been out way too long. The rice on the sushi was so dry and hard that it fell off the seaweed when we picked it up and at the end of the night we watched the server repacking the sushi for the fridge. So, obviously it was not fresh and the fridge was drying out the rice. When it came to dessert, we tried 2 pieces of cake. I spit mine out. It had been sitting there so long that it was hard from being dried out. Obviously they are more concerned with waste than quality. However, the fresh made pasta station was great! The Mongolian beef was delicious. The shrimp was good too. I was afraid to try the crab legs, they looked old. All the staff were super friendly and the unlimited beer/wine for the price make the buffet worth it. It was $32/person and as long as you have 3 drinks, totally worth it since most drinks at the bars run a minimum of $12.00. I highly recommend that you go on a busy day if you want better food so you know it hasn't been left out all day or repackaged from the night before.",

I do wish that they had more people manning that station though because it sucks that I had to wait for quite a while.  We didnt even get through half of it until we were totally full. I didnt go back because of the price,  its cheaper for me to go to Bouchon and get something because my husband and I eat so little.  I guess its great, if the price was lower (maybe like $10) I would be here all the time. At least the hotel should give a discount for people renting rooms there.

They also have  salad and sandwich bar which is great. They have breakfast foods, italian, mexican...there are foods from all parts of the world.  The dessert bar has a prettt good selection. I like their bit size selection so I can take a bite out of a variety and not feel guilty. They also have a gelato bar in the far corner which is nice.

    "text": "Here's another buffet that I've been to on a few different occasions, but I've forgotten to write a review.  The Cravings Buffet at Mirage is certainly not a fancy buffet, but it works in a pinch.  It works even better if you can get it for free, or at a discounted price.  My wife and I used a MyVegas reward and got 2 free buffets to use at Cravings.  Now, I'm thankful that the meal was free, because had I paid full price I don't really feel like it would have been worth it, at least this time.  This buffet certainly has a lot of options, it's just that a lot of the food is mediocre.  We came here for lunch, and they still had their homemade omelette station going, so I nabbed one of those.  I enjoyed the omelette, but was having a tough time finding other options that interested me.  They do have a self-service drink station now, which consists of one of those fancy new coke machines.  You can also get coffee, milk, juice, etc.  Or, you can get free beer or wine, but the selection is limited.  I feel bad for the servers at this buffet, because they are essentially glorified buss boys.  All they did was clear a few of the plates off the table once, and then we never really saw them again.  It's kind of a pain to walk all the way to the other side of the room every time you need a refill.  No service=No tip.  I guess the thing that bugged me the most was their dessert station.  It was noon and they still had several of their breakfast items out there.  Sorry, but I'm not interested in donuts that have been sitting there for a few hours for dessert.  Many of the cupcakes offered were dry, and the creme brulee was subpar at best.  Also, they took away the homemade gelato and replaced it with ice cream machines.  Seriously??  What an awful substitute!  Anyway, I don't want to be too hard on this buffet, because it was free.  That said, I'm not sure that I'll be \"craving\" this place anytime soon.",

We enjoyed the champagne brunch and were given an extra Mimosa before it ended.    The only things preventing 5 stars was the slow seating process when there are plenty of open tables and the dessert selection left a lot to be desired.   For $35 per person, it's money well spent.",

Only came here because it was free thanks to myVegas FB app :)   Here are items that are decent but not spectacular:  1) Prime Rib - this could very well be a hit or miss but when I got it was decent 2) Shrimp - be careful, they served some shrimp that were stilll frozen.. wth.. take them prongs and give them a nice tap to see if it's still frozen 3) Macaroon cookies - surprisingly decent 4) Smoked Salmon - thank goodness they can't screw this one up 5) Crab legs - mediorce, wasn't that good, wasn't that bad  Here are items that were just utter gross and not worth an attempt to eat for next time (if any..) 1) Mussels (mushy mushy mushy) 2) Beef Pho soup (beef chewy chewy, soup bland - no taste) 3) Sushi (gross...)  Since it was free, I okay with not getting my full money's worth to fill myself up on crappy food.  If you want decent buffets, you need to pay up for them or rather line up in order to get seated. This place was pretty deserted. Not worth a 2nd visit, even if it was free. I rather pay for better quality food.",

The all u can drink beer is the only thing I can say was the highlight of my experience here as I couldn't give them 5 stars. Cause I kinda felt ripped off. But if u have lots of time to sit and eat and mess with half ass crab legs. Go ahead. !",

So on top of having to get our own food (which is normal, it's a buffet) we have to get our drinks from the bar?! I've been to multiple buffets on the strip and not once have I had to keep getting up to enjoy the bottomless mimosas. All the server did was pick up our dirty plates. And not only did we have to keep getting up, the bartender put less than half in the cup. Ah! Also, before I placed my order with the bartender, a girl in front of me ordered two drinks and he gave it to her with no problem..I ordered a mimosa for myself and my boyfriend and was told \"I can't really do this. This is the last time\"...the woman before me didn't get that speech",

Also, the different styles of food were clearly labeled. They had a wide range of food options, from latin to chinese to barbeque. I wish they would have had more traditional foods though. For example, their noodle bar was more dimsum and Asian oriented but I would have loved an Italian noodle bar similar to that at Treasure Island. Everything I tried was great. The desserts were yummy and included gelato selections. The wait staff was nice and was good at removing your plate. I would come back for sure.",

She had been there about five years earlier when our brother-in-law was working at the Mirage, and she loved it. Maybe we caught them on an off-day or it was between lunch and dinner, but I was not at all impressed by this buffet. Not that it was bad, but there just wasn't much to write home about. They had some very basic \"sushi\" rolls, none of which used raw fish. The italian food was laughable, but that's generally how it is out west. The chinese food was pretty good, but that was not enough to save them. And for the price, they needed to have a lot more going on here. It cost almost as much as the buffet at the Bellagio, which was absolutely the most elegant buffet I have ever seen. In my opinion, skip this one and go to the Bellagio.",

    "text": "This is a dinner review.  Two days earlier we ate at the Wynn, which is $12 more per person. So this review compares the two buffets.  The Wynn has better desserts, in that it has creme brulee and a crepe bar. But aside from that, the food quality is not discernibly different overall. You may prefer one thing in one location, but that is personal preference, not fundamental quality.  Someone next to you will feel the opposite.  People is some reviews are claiming that they can recognize quality differences between these high-end buffets - we have eaten countless meals on fancy cruise ships and there is only so much you can do with food prepared in quantity and put out in warming trays for hundreds of people. But the variety of food at the Mirage, at Cravings, is superior. So if you go to a buffet to be able to sample a wide variety of things that you could never eat at home or at a regular restaurant, then Cravings is ideal. You cannot even begin to sample everything that they offer. I tried everything I could eat, and found nothing that was poor in quality or unappetizing. On the other hand, if you go a buffet to eat really great food, then you are either highly confused or are not really familiar with what good food is.  Sadly, for $25 per person, it is impossible to get \"great\" food.  You need to go to one of the individual restaurants in the large hotels and pay $50 to $100 per person if you want that.  But I thought that Cravings did an excellent job for the $25 they charged me, much better than I expected. But for the two of us, the most marked difference between Wynn and the Mirage was the ambiance - the whole experience. All of the staff, even the people serving the food and waiting on you, were friendly and extraordinarily helpful. I asked one gentleman serving salad where the butter was, and he left his station to lead me to it. At the Wynn, I found everyone harried, overly busy, and as a result indifferent and unfriendly and unhelpful. The service at Cravings was great; at Wynn it was nonexistent.  The other thing I noticed after eating at the Wynn was that at Cravings, the food line is cordoned off from the tables by a wall of some sort, so those eating do not have to feel or see the crush of people running back and forth looking for what they want to eat. Wynn does not do that. It makes for a much calmer environment.  This is all the more surprising since we went to Cravings expecting the worst - after all, it was much less costly that the Wynn, and the Wynn was not very good overall. Even if it were the same price as the Wynn, we would take Cravings over the Wynn. But for the price, it is an absolute no brainer. Skip the Wynn, go to Cravings, and take the $12 apiece that you save and blow it on some useless souvenir.",

Service is very attentive. Once in a while they have a panini sandwich station which is awesome. The gelato station hiding in the desert corner is damn good. prime rib is good. So why give it only 3 stars and not more? Well I was here a few weeks ago. And for some strange reason it just didn't satisfy. the prime rib was fatty. Some of the dishes out, weren't very fresh. The selection was very minimal. I was there during lunch time. I'm not sure what was going on that day. But it doesn't ruin my spirits to give it one more try when I go back.

Maybe because there is an abundance of casino buffets, but it beats standing in a Disneyland-like line at our local casino.  Beverage service was immediate and we tied on the feedbag for round one.  Nicely laid out buffet with several stations of options. Salad bar allowed you to choose your greens, toppings and dressing and then have it hand-tossed by a staffer.  Served up in a nice deep bowl.  Somehow it just made it taste better and I didn't want to give it up.  A dribble of melted in a bowl and then a handful of crab legs.  A little on the smallish side - snow crab? Good, sweet, but alot of work for little yield.  Next stop was the noodle area - BBQ pork won ton noodles for me.  Not the greatest, but definitely a nice option.  Next plate = perfectly medium rare prime rib with a little scoop of corn, a dab of mashed potatoes to stick it together and a piece of pizza.  Last go-around included a pecan square, lemon tart, and  cranberry orange cookie, which miraculously found its way under a napkin and into my purse for later. Nice bedtime snack. Did I eat $27 worth? Probably not, but there were tons of options and most were not bad.",

Forget about the spit guard buffets at other places this buffet is top notch all the way. For starters the salad station has a person there that makes your salad to order. No more people picking at everything. Also this Buffet is huge. I mean wall to wall stations with everything for Italian food to sushi. The food is similar to what you would get in a nicer sit down restaurant also. The Desserts are just as enjoyable with things such as cookies and Gelato. Also this place gets crowded during peak times so I don't recommend coming here during peak times as you will have to wait.  So far still my favorite Buffet in Vegas.",

The place is pretty much square shaped and there's food choices surrounding each side the cube.  The place is really bright and there's plenty of seating.  I never feel like it's actually worth 25-30 bucks to eat at a buffet as the quality of the food isn't as high as some restaurants, but at the the same time the quantities are insane and unlimited.  Most of the time I find myself eating a plate or sometimes two and maybe a bit of dessert.   I don't eat as much as some people because it's kind of disgusting.  People eating the way they do sometimes at buffets is enough to lose your appetite, so it might be a good idea to not look around so much.   If you're a big eater definitely come here, if not, a restaurant which serves a decent portion might do the trick for ya.",

I only ate the prime rib which was still very good, but I suppose its comparable to the Paris buffet I had the next day, so at least I was full.  The crab legs were FROZEN!!!  Solid, inedible.  many thumbs down.    Desserts were lackluster, having once served good quality desserts, they were reduced to cheap cakes and disfigured flans.  I mean not a single flan had looked decent.    Service was lacking as well, nice waitress, though she bitched a lot and looked very overworked.  Lacking because they were obviously understaffed.  I had a good mind to pull the executive chef as he walked past my table and question him regarding what happened to this wonderful buffet.    Decided it wasn't worth the effort.  Go on to Paris for the same price but much better food.",

They have the typical fare of different themed foods such as Italian, Mexican,  Chinese, American and Japanese. Like I said, the shrimp and crab legs is a must have.

You must try their cookies.  I got so lucky and grabbed some white chocolate macadamia cookies when they were still warm.  Crispy on the sides and chewy and mouth-wateringly good.  I mean, I was stuffed beyond belief, but I couldn't stop eating it! - If you get in during breakfast time, do try the Portuguese sausage.  It's the only breakfast food really worth it.  Avoid: - Gelato bar looks good, but the texture was more like the soft serve at Dairy Queen. (which I HATE) So disappointed. - Shrimp pad thai was served ice cold.  So gross.",

I did not care for the wine at all, and the only complimentary beer offered was bud light. Personally,  I don't consider the free beer and wine a perk.  You pick up your drink from the bartender, so that is a separate tip from you server...not so free since the glass of wine isn't even worth a buck.  There was nothing here at the buffet that wowed me.  My partner liked the prime rib, but as usual he says it tastes like roast beef and not prime rib.  They are too heavy with the peppercorn as a seasoning on the outside.   The chinese broccoli and asparagus looked really fresh and delicious, but looks were deceiving.  They looked fresh, but both lacked flavor, were too oily and tough.   They have someone tossing your salad for you, which is a nice idea to have one person handling all the salad items, but the reality is a long line at the salad bar.....ugh.   Why not hire someone to make fresh sushi rolls instead?   The fresh fruit was nice, but in typical Vegas buffet fashion, the desserts are more for show than for taste.  Even the sorbet was way too sweet and tasted artificially flavored.   Too bad, I like the mirage poker room and would like to visit again and have a nice, reasonably priced buffet on site  next time I visit.",

I love that buffet so much I'm pretty much biased when comparing it to any other buffet. My first indication that it wouldn't be like Bachannal should've been the fact that there was no wait to get seated.   All the way in the back of the buffet is the beverage machines and a bar where they give out complimentary beer and wine.   There is a variety of food to choose some. On the left side you have American, Italian, Pizza, Seafood, Soup, and the Meat Carving Station. On the right side of the buffet there is Chinese, Sushi, Salad, and Dessert; the usual that you will get at a buffet.   The best part of my meal was probably the dessert - yum",

Even on the VIP line I waited around 10minutes as people fumbled for the right cards and ID to get their appropriate discounts. Upon entering they advised that house beer and wine were free. A very nice touch if you're consuming.   The first station was omelettes, the second station was pizza. Breakfast, pineapple, pepperoni and grilled chicken. Worried that I may not see anything better I grabbed two small rectangles of the grilled chicken.   The next station had eggs Benedict, French toast and condiments for it. I passed.   Next station was prime rib and ham! Yes now we're talking. I was 3rd on line and though the first person had a slice of ham covered in gravy there was a debate as to which gravy the server in Chefs clothing had slathered atop it. He did not speak English and her questions were received with pointing and grunts. She returned the plate started again and pointed to the gravy she preferred. The second gentleman picked ham no topping and finally it was my turn. Prime rib rare please! The good news is it registered in the little English he knew, the bad is he carved me off a paper thin slice. I'm not going to keep the 3 people behind me waiting any longer so I moved to the mashed potatoes and corn, which were the height of my meal at Cravings. So good I grabbed seconds. I was able to enjoy my prime rib in one single bite. Like a slice of roast beef at the deli counter.   Even though I would've liked more meat the carving board was 5 deep so I slithered in and grabbed a spoonful of potatoes and corn and made it to the next station of mexican dishes. Rice, chips, salsa guacamole and fried potato wedges? Pass  They had soup at the next station and I grabbed some New England Clam Chowder. It was very good. As many clams as potatoes. The next and last before the deserts was oriental that had rice, sushi, wontons and pot stickers. I had everything but the rice and enjoyed all of it.   For $26 in Vegas it's worth it and I'm certain that as Mirage offers great comps that I'll be back. Just don't expect service at the carving station.",

But there is no way I can tell anyone go to this counter for this or that because it's all over the place, i.e. What would cereal be doing at the salad station? Gravy was rushed so it's gritty from the flour. Now the big problem is we paid extra for the alcoholic drinks(it was only six bucks but that's beside the point). One bartender tries to tell me my Bloody Mary already has vodka in the premix sorry but that is bull you just gave me tomato juice. The other bartender was great one of the first things he does is pour the vodka in. So let's just say I wouldn't recommend this buffet nor would I ever come back.

Maybe the variety here just wasn't for my taste buds.  Gripes about buffets in general: Buffets are hard to get right in my opinion. The high cost of food just for the variety isn't usually worth it.

    "text": "Located in the back of the Mirage, close to Samba, this is a fairly spacious buffet. They also have a to-go option: $16 for a box.  BF wanted something fairly quick and everything else in the casino would've had a long wait. Came on a Sunday (3/1/2015) around 11AM and there was no line (that should've been our first indicator about this place).  Note: Drinks are SELF-SERVE!! So if you're going to pre-tip at the cashier, I wouldn't tip very much since they hardly stop by to clear the tables or re-fill any alcoholic beverages you may have ordered.  Beer, Wine & Mimosas included during brunch.  Waffles were soggy but the french toast was pretty good (lots of cinnamon). There's a chef station that does custom omelettes but the line was too long. There's also different pizzas next to the chef station if you want pizza for brunch.  Tried the potsticker and seafood bun. The bun was really gross and mushy, but the filling was ok. Potsticker tasted like the frozen kind. Fried wonton was mostly oil and almost no filling.  The chilled shrimp and king crab legs were decent. The cioppino was probably the tastiest thing there but the bread that supposed to go with it was very stale (avoid it). Stayed away from all the sushi and sashimi since they all looked old and rubbery.  There's a carving station where the carver kind of creeped me out. He kept staring at me while he was cutting the prime rib that I ordered -_-|| The meat was fairly tender and juicy, but not much flavor.  The desserts didn't look too appealing: very dry-looking. The creme brulee tasted boxed and the panna cotta tasted like a pudding cup. I found it very weird that the \"sorbet\" is dispensed out of a soft serve machine. The toppings are around the corner of the machine.  Service is pretty much non-existent which sucks since my BF gave a good pre-tip. Lucky we were seated at a 4 person table even though we were only a pair because we just left our dirty dishes on the empty table (which got piled high). If you want a refill on your mimosas or beer, just get up and go to the counter yourself (otherwise you'll never get another drink).  If you have a voucher or a discount to come here, try it out.. But do NOT come here if you have to pay full price. Definitely not worth it at all. Our friends had a free voucher and they thought the buffet was really bad. Imagine how we felt since we paid for ours =/",

Excellent variety makes this an affordable choice for families, with lots of food that appeals to both adults and children. Things that are supposed to be fresh are fresh, with abundant toppings/options.   Con: All food tends to be filling, and the sheer quantity does no substitute for quality. For instance, I have never, ever had such mashed potatoes that they tasted like cardboard soaked in chicken broth....with similar consistency. Or gelato that's was really just syrupy sorbets.   However, you get what you pay for. At around ~$30/person, you still get crab legs, shrimp and sushi. The  environment is less fancy than Wynn, and the quality is a bit lower, but I feel the unlimited beer and wine make up for that. Not to mention the lower price.   Things I recommend: crab legs, shrimp, guacamole, salad, and desserts.   Overall: it was okay. Nothing spectacular.   PS: to the previous reviewer: they changed the Mlife sign.",

    "text": "\"Wow. Bulk City\" were the exact words of my African-Filipino-American roommate as he stepped onto the premise. I proceeded to see him stack plate after plate of remnant seafood and other ethnic delicacies. His happiness was short-lived two hours later when the overly buff creature held his gut  and writhed in pain at the amount of food he had consumed. Your time at Cravings Buffet at Mirage will be the most magnificent during, but just learn to pace yourself as with everything in life.   There was quite the selection to choose from and is pretty standard for a Las Vegas buffet. What stood out the most were the crab legs that were prepared so the customers wouldn't have to doggedly dig for the meat inside. As well, the prime rib and the salmon were top notch. I am extremely picky about salmon and there's no other way to describe it as best as my roommate had: \"The salmon melts in my mouth. How is this possible?\" Other than that, the other selections of food did not really stand out. Some of my friends claimed that the desert were some of the best they have tasted. I'm not a huge fan of deserts, so I refrained from weighing on the matter. All in all, I would say for $30 it is not a bad choice to fill up on an empty stomach.",

We did not expect much, but $25 was hard to beat if you wanted to get something on the Strip.   Here is a quick summary of some of the food which we have tried:  - Raw oysters - bitter taste, completely not edible  - Chicken wings - dry and tough  - Egg Benedict - how could you screw up an egg? yes, they did it - completely bland and tasteless  - Snow crab legs - little meat but with some salty taste  - Honey glazed ham - no taste of ham at all; bland - Prime rib - the crust was good, but that was pretty much it; the meat itself was dry and tough with no flavor  - Various desserts - all of them were bad and tasted horrible; I love desserts in general as long as they are loaded with sweetness; the desserts there were not sweet  - Orange juice - diluted with at least 50% water  - Wine - a little bit sweet, couldn't finish a glass  - Water - good!   Please do yourself a favor to skip this place. You do not deserve this culinary atrocity!",

The stuff costs $4 a bottle so be ready for a headache if you're going all out on this stuff.  We did not as my wife and I both know better than to drink cheap champagne.  The buffet was weak in our opinion.  There is absolutely no ambiance to the place and it is grossly overpriced.  Thankfully we had a $65 credit as part of our room package so we only spent $10 with tip for the meal.  I would strongly suggest visiting the \"Pantry\" around the corner for breakfast or a different resort for their brunch.  If you do want a highlight to try out while you're there check out the cinnamon buns and the tiramisu, both were very good.",

Other than that, I honestly am not a huge buffet person. Something with quality drops off when food is sold in limit-less quantities. My friend had an insatiable craving for crab, so that's what brought us to a buffet at all. She thoroughly enjoyed it, but that was pretty much all she ate. I had a few of the other offerings like the Mexican food and the Asian food, and they were both just ok. The baked deserts including cookies were just average, and all 3 of us in my party agreed to that. What I did like was the gelato and sorbet machine. At least that made my walk to the dessert area worthy.  Oh yes, forgot to mention, the seating staff was excellent and very professional!   Yelp Yourself!",

The service here is excellent and the floor is very clean and well maintained compared to other strip buffets. My favorite part of the buffet is the seafood section because I'm such a huge fan of the big shrimp cocktail and the king crab legs!!   Mmm mm TASTY!!...  The sushi section offers 4 different kinds of handrolls (Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail and Scallops), and 3 different kinds of Japanese salad, Soybeans, cut rolls and miso soup.  Meat section offers Turkey, Roast Beef, Prime Rib, Barbeque and other stuff. Then they have the Mexican, Italian and deli areas but the section that needs some work is the dessert section because you have to squeeze in between the dessert island and the cake shelf if there are other guests grabbing dessert and it just feels so cramped.   Another thing that bothers me is the section between the seafood and Mexican food because you'd have to walk across a small part of the dining hall to get to the other section and I think it would be better if they extended the tile connecting both stations rather then walking on the carpet.   Like the other Yelpers said it feels like eating in a cafeteria and I do agree with them. The breakfast buffet was actually excellent but pricey (Vegas strip price) and the omelet was a hit with my eggs cooked to perfection.   Just delicious!  I would definitely eat here again bit if you want to save some money, go to the buffet and 1 - 2 Hours before lunch or dinner starts to avoid paying the full price.  Minus 2 stars for the Dessert section and the layout of the buffet.",

    "text": "My husband and I have been here several times and they have all been good experiences. So on our recent trip to Vegas with my brother and sister in law, we practically dragged them here. It ended up being one of the more disappointing meals of the trip.  My guess is that we went too late. Which is another point to be made?  Why do some buffets close so early? 9 pm seems to early to close, even if it is a weekday. We barely made it time, around 8. The food was cold and our whole group was left feeling less than satisfied.   It makes me never want to suggest a place to eat again. We will probably give it another go. When it is just me and my husband we usually have dinner a bit earlier and I suspect that was one of the problems.",

I'm don't think it's worth $37.00/person (weekend dinner), but I used the MyVegas \"2 for 1\" discount  so it was slightly under $20.00/person.   It includes \"all you drink\" beer  and wine (something new) so if you like to drink, it could be a deal for you, but when drinks are comped everywhere [in Vegas] it doesn't seem to be a big deal to me.  As already mentioned in other reviews, you have to go to the \"bar\" or \"drink station\" for all drinks and refills. So why would anyone leave a tip for the wait staff when you need to get your own drinks?  This is my 2nd or 3rd time here, but if you're having to pay the full price to eat here I strongly suggest you to consider going to the buffets at the Wynn, Bellagio, or Wicked Spoon (Cosmopolitan) before choosing Cravings.",

    "text": "$35 per person.   Maybe I expected too much from a Vegas buffet but there were just too many no's about this place. Food was overall just okay (although dessert is a different story).   Long story short, not much selection of food, everything was way too salty, the stations of food were usually empty, and the line for the seafood section was ridiculously long all the time.   The only thing worth getting here in my opinion was the italian section (and italian is not my go-to food). The pizza was cheesy and good, and the cheese-filled tortellini and ravioli were amazing. The various types of potatoes available were impressive and all delicious. However, everything else in the buffet was at best mediocre.   Save some of those calories for dessert - the pumpkin cheesecake, chocolate brownie, and various shooters are all worth getting!",

For two people we paid approximately $25 or so, included house wine and beers.

The prime rib was perfect, the country fried steak was meh (dry). Staff was attentive and great, the line wasn't too shabby.

    "text": "I would have rated this buffet as a 3.5 star if I could but since they got some self-serve drink machines I thought that was awesome.  The price isn't expensive compared to some other buffets.  Dinner menu was $30 a person which I was not complaining.  We only gave this one a shot because Ceasar's Palace buffet was packed and we were headed to LOVE Cirque at the Mirage so it was perfect.    I've read that some people didn't like having a machine to serve your own drinks.  I found it had tons more selections than any other buffet and if you have a bad server, you won't be getting drink refills without waving them down.  Stop being lazy, it is a buffet and I think self serve drinks just make perfect sense too.  I've experienced at the Wicked Spoon that my server took forever to clear plates and refill drinks.  A little thing I noticed was that certain sections they don't refill or replenish the food very well.  For example the Asian food section had a lot of empty items and did not get filled up even by the time we finished eating.  Maybe they just thought no one would get any which does make sense.  Apparently a guest was disgusted that we grabbed the seaweed salad from the sushi area and asked what that was.  When she was told it was seaweed, she had a disgusted look in her face.  Right after she grabbed some sushi which has seaweed wrapped around the rice... Some people are just stupid. Sorry to be so blunt.  i will definitely give them another try just for their drink machine.",

I was a little disappointed that there wasn't more fruit options other than pineapple, a variety of melon, and peaches, but realized it might be because breakfast was going away soon en lieu for lunch. The french toast was really spicy and sweet (our table loved that). The lunch items getting set out looked really good too, but alas I was too full to partake. I should have saved room for some of the gelato or chocolate chip cookies I saw as we were walking out.",

The unlimited wine included more than your basic merlot or chardonay from a box; i chose cabernet sauvignon ( from a bottle) and was satisfied. I started with the imported charcuterie and cheese with my first glass. All quite nice, good variety and quality. From the asian section i sampled the fried spring roll and a dumpling, very nice, delicately prepared. The family seated next to me took platefuls of the singapore noodles; I'm not one to carboload before the theater so i refrained.  From the carving section i sampled some prime rib and some excellent corned beef brisket. I cannot attest to the italian section. Cold crab legs, cold shrimp, warm crab legs, drawn butter, yum! The chicken wings were great and the ribs were good too. Only disappointment is that i saw a sign for gelato and saved room - unfortunately the sign was incorrect, just some self serve sorbet. 2 plates, 3 glasses wine, happy and full before the performance. Will absolutely come back next time i'm in town.",

This is one of the moderately priced buffets on the Strip - it costs 27$ a person for dinner. The food is more exquisite then simply pizza and burgers, but I was still not very impressed. I had the following items:  Pizza - Pretty good, but nothing exceptional Prime Rib - Likely the tastiest part of the meal: Great and unlimited Fajitas - God awful Chips & Guacamole - Surprisingly good guacamole for a buffet. Pork Buns - I've had better in a college dining commons. Sushi - Very small selection of rolls (tuna, avocado, and that's about it), and none of them are any good.  So, overall, the food was standard, except the prime rib. I had been expecting a luxury buffet with restaurant- quality food. If you are expecting that, I don't think this will be for you.",

I appreciate the fact that the food planners at Cravings don't see their customers as oversized trucks waiting to plow into everything and anything for as cheap as possible.    The dinner selection was quite extensive but since it is divided into sections, it's more than manageable.  The crab legs are fresh and quite delicious and the Asian section was just as good.  I got a bit of everything including the turkey, pizza and pasta.  The dessert selection is also original and the gelato was spot on.  There are several cooking stations serving up ready-to-make food, so freshness is not so much an issue.   The service was excellent and I've usually been seated away from the main area, so it did not feel overwhelming like a high school cafeteria.    If you have to eat at a buffet and are not a huge fan of it like I am, Cravings is your best bet.",

But there was NO LINE!!!! I though the selection wasn't AS huge as Bellagio but the food was all good! And it's very spacious and not crowded.  I would recommend skipping on the sushi rolls.  The salad bar looked amazing and I wish I'd discovered just how amazing it looked before I was already stuffed. The crepe station was fantastic with plain or peach crepes and plenty of sauces for them. Prime rib was excellent. Belgian waffles with maple butter and whipped cream were simple but oh so tasty. Loved the chilaquiles and chimichurri sauce, the croissant bread pudding was wonderful, the poached apples were delicious.. oh my, I'm getting hungry :)  I had to get back to my class, but my friends told me that they sat there for 3+hours drinking champagne and received excellent service.

Usually we have servers that do that. It was not a big deal though. Lots of drinks to choose from. They even had complimentary beer and wine.  Food was all great. Probably my only complaint was the sushi. Wasn't really that fresh. I liked how we could get a customizable pasta plate. You choose what type of noodles, vegetables and then your sauce and the chef cooks it right in front of you in minutes.  My favorite dessert was the creme bru le. Grabbed a few of those.   It was an okay buffet. Probably only good for a one time experience",

Not sure if I'm crazy, or maybe the options are better for dinner.  The entire area is huge and there is plenty of seating throughout. If I remember correctly, wine and beer were all you can drink?

At least the food could  be hot! I did not care for one thing on my plate and I am an adventurous eater and not picky. My husband did like the carved roast beef.

Been there with a French friend visiting the US because we had a 50% (or 30%?) off coupon which would make the whole day buffet on a Saturday at 25$ (you can get 11$ weekday brunch with that coupon from Tix4tonight). Not a bad deal. Especially it includes free flow of wines and beers.  First: don't go there unless you have a discount coupon. I don't think the buffet is worth over 20$ (unless you drink a lot of alcohol). The food is OK, very standard, slightly on the cheap side. Suchi bar? lot of rice, nothing fine nor gourmet, small selection. Cheese? industrial, small selection. Meat? quite oily. American buffet? on the heavy side. crab legs? yes unlimited snow crab legs. Frozen though and not cooked very well (very salty, watery). Dessert buffet seemed great. Too bad I don't eat sweet.  I think it's a 3 stars food-wise, for 20ish $.  OK now why 2 stars? Service. your dirty plates can sit on your tables for 20 minutes. piling up. Our waitress was making a pretty long face and worst of all: she dropped sauce and meat from our plates twice (and a lot, not just few drops), while removing them form the table. Sauce landed twice on your bags that were on the chairs next to us. Not a sorry, not offering to clean, she probably even didn't notice.  You can go there if you wanna eat whole day and don't mind the service.",

Service- it's 100% self serve, you get your own drinks and your plates sit on your table till you leave or until you start giving super dirty looks to all the servers around you. Also the carpet is absolutely disgusting in here!  The price is ridiculous for what mediocre food you get and especially it being completely flavorless. The prime rib wasn't even salted.

It's  the only buffet with an enhanced self service beverage station with 150 plus coca cola flavors, all for $31 per person for dinner.  The set up of each International food station is very identifiable and they are laid out in an orderly fashion.  I particularly enjoyed the crab legs at the seafood station, since the legs were already cut in half and very easy to eat. I enjoyed it together with the mixed fried rice.  The selection of Sushi and Sashimi are good but I was not particularly blown away (I had tried a better Japanese buffet off the strip.)  All in all, with its rich selection of dishes, best value and great customer service, Cravings at The Mirage is highly recommended. I will definitely come back!",

But let me assure you that once you get inside you will be delighted with the flavors that follow.  The Spread - the price includes a full selection of beer and wine. If you come on Sunday you can also get all you can drink champagne up to 3 p.m. this is a really fantastic offer considering the prices of everything else in town. My personal favorite is brunch.  The Food - the food here overall is really good. And the variety is amazing. There's everything from prime rib to guacamole. My personal favorite is the dessert bar. My highest recommendations to the bread pudding and the Opera Bar.  The Service - our server was a sweet and cheerful lady. She was attentive without being overbearing. I was very happy to be sitting in her section.  Overall - this is one of my favorite places to eat when I'm in Las Vegas. It's a great place to have brunch or a late breakfast and that'll keep you going until a late dinner. And there is enough variety of food that there is something for everybody.

It doesn't help when the first thing in the buffet line is the pizza.    They do offer shrimp cocktails and king crab legs which are split into two for easier eating.  Unfortunately, I couldn't enjoy the king crab legs.  My lips had an itching sensation after eating them.  The sushi, not memorable at all.  The prime rib and turkey were alright.  What I did like was the gelato they offered, fresh fruit, and the wall of baked goods.  I wish that my stomach could hold more b/c after the fruit and gelato, I was done.

Food was bland, Chinese food was outright tasteless. Some selections of food were left near empty. Layout Is poor, you have to walk a significant distance to get to buffet and navigate through the maze of other people eating.  Not worth the money unless you want to sit around and drink mimosas, those are brought to you by the waitress.",

Move aside Spice Market (PH/Aladdin) and Bellagio Buffet (the two other top buffets on the Las Vegas strip IMO)....Cravings is where it's at. Very short or even no line (didn't really matter for us either way because we had line passes as guests of the hotel) that immediately puts Cravings a step ahead of Spice Market and Bellagio Buffet where the line waits would easily be 30-60 minutes.   Pricing for dinner was under $30 which I think puts it right on par with Spice Market and cheaper than Bellagio.    Food quality and variety. I think Cravings actually had way more variety than any other buffet I've seen. Gyros, Wonton noodle soup, salads, soups, ice cream...whoops I mean GELATO!!!, desserts, pasta, pizza, and of course prime rib and all you can eat Alaskan king crab legs. Now how's the quality...okay I'm going to put the quality of their food somewhere between Bellagio and Spice Market Buffet. Which for the same price as Spice Market is a damn good deal.    Service also was excellent, even considering our party of eight. Atmosphere, ambience and cleanliness also felt right on par with Bellagio. I'll admit Spice Market feels a bit dingy, but Cravings had a nice atmosphere to it.    Anyway with all said above. Cravings is now my #1 buffet in Las Vegas. Good price, no line, excellent variety and quality of food, good service, and nice atmosphere. I mean what else could you ask for.   ~G",

Breakfast was even more disappointing, with a too-long-to-stand-on omelette line, few other egg choices (they need two omelette stations and another station for regular eggs), and not enough interesting fare to warrant the cost. Worse, they charge a usurious 18% service fee for parties of 8 or more, yet they do nothing for that money--didn't offer to get drinks or water or coffee, and barely bussed the tables. Not at all worth the cost.",

    "text": "\"Are we really going to do this?\"  LOL...this was my fiance and I at about 1:30PM on Sunday morning (well afternoon I guess, but it felt like morning).  After an incredible \"Vegas style\" Saturday night - all we knew was we were still tired, and still starving from the night before.  We also knew we had to get up eventually.  How were we going to combat this beer hangover?  How about mass quantities of food.  Let me preface by saying - we aren't the buffet types AT ALL.  If we're going to spend money on food, we go for quality over quantity. We'd find it much easier to spend $100 on a sushi dinner, or an amazing Chinese banquet, than a buffet.  But again, my yelp research had led me to Cravings.  Not because it's the best.  Not because it's the cheapest. But because of it's Asian selection.  We knew we were in Vegas.  We knew we needed a ton of food.  But we also knew we needed Asian.  And it needed to be fast.  We were in no condition to wait in a massive line.  And it needed to be on the strip.  What the heck - Cravings it is!  We got to the Mirage at about 2PM, (let me also tell you that the strip anytime on the weekends is a PARKING lot.  We did not take Las Vegas Blvd once while we were there).  We found a spot by the elevators to the Mirage and entered the tropical paradise.  I already began feeling better (it HAS to be the casino air) - and the beautiful gardens really helped brighten the mood.  But this is not a review of the Mirage.  We walked through the gardens and casino, passed the Cirque Du Soleil Revolution Theater and Lounge (looked SOO cool, if only there was more time)...passed Kokomo's Steak House...Passed Japonais...and finally, we made it to  Cravings!  It was seriously like a light shone from above on the restaurant sign.  It was at the end of the casino (really..NOT that far of a walk, just REALLY far when you're still hungover and starved).  The BEST thing EVER was seeing that, there was NO line.  Seriously - none.  I had read horror stories about two hour lines at Bellagio, and wasn't about to have it.  This was perfect for us.  Cost for Sunday brunch with Champagne with tax was only $56.10 for two!  That included bottomless mimosas/champagne and soft drinks/coffee. Okay, that may seem like a lot - but REALLY, when you consider your dining options on the strip - you can either go fast food cheap, and settle for McDonald's or Panda Express, you could go fine dining and pay $100 for lunch, or you could do a buffet - which includes champagne.  We were happy with our decision.  Service was great for us - although, I CAN see where other yelpers may have had issues with this.  We were very lucky - we started off with a subpar server, but during the brunch/dinner shift change, we were replaced with a wonderful server who always kept our glasses full (trust me - my fiance probably consumed 10 iced teas in 20 minutes) and my champagne always full.  Champagne was a nice touch (even though I had complained of a hangover only ten minutes before).  Onto the food.  REALLY - the ONLY reason you should come here is if you like Asian food.  Seriously - I don't think this buffet would appeal to customers who do not like Asian food.  There is a section called \"Noodles\" that serves shumai, steamed pork buns, and potstickers, reminiscent of dim sum.  At that same station you can order beef and meatball pho, wonton noodle soup, and many other varieties of soup and dishes.  And then next to that is a \"chinese\" section that has noodles, rice, congee, and a variety of other Chinese dishes.  And next to that is a Japanese section (with a very small variety of sushi and to be honest, not really good sushi).  But they do have miso soup which is soo soothing.  The pho is good (not the best broth ever) but it does the trick!  The wonton noodle soup was really good, and the congee as well.  We must've loaded up on all of the soups.  The shumai is okay - it just depends on when you go.  It was a bit chewy but when they put out a super fresh batch and it was fine.    All in all a very pleasant experience.  So much so we went back for dinner the following night.  No champagne - but the same price - $56.10 for two - not bad for dinner!  And the variety was better - singapore noodles, shrimp and veggies.  And their prime rib was amazing.  Seriously soo tender.    I would highly recommend this buffet if you like Asian food.  And their \"carving\" station is good too.  My fiance sampled the crab legs and said they seemed frozen and salty.  We only stuck to Asian, soups, and meat.  We didn't even hit dessert!  You get what you pay for - and you ARE at a buffet.  I wasn't expecting New York Chinatown or SF Chinatown quality food, but it was a wonderful variety (and yes - there were Asians cooking behind the stations!)  Haha.  If you're looking for a reasonable buffet with NO lines I'd definitely stop here.  Maybe not the quality of desserts or french cuisine as the Bellagio or the Wynn, but not nearly as pricey either!",

We came in at about 1:30 in the afternoon and my mom and step dad ordered a bottle of Champagne. After about 15 minutes, our waiter came by to apologize for the wait, because apparently, the buffet bar was closed; so they would have to go to rEVOLution or Japonais just to get a bottle. Ten more minutes passed by with is wondering why the Cravings bar was closed, when he came back to apologize again for the delay. My mom just said to forget it because she had specifically told the waiter she wanted it with her food.  He stood near our table virtually the whole time we were eating. Normally this would be good, but he was standing there chatting with his coworkers. We barely got refills, I'm glad my coffee came with a carafe.   In terms of food, it wasn't anything phenomenal. I came here with my fiance last year and remembered the food being better. It seems there were some cut backs at Cravings which is sad, because it used to be one of the best buffets in Vegas. I don't think I will go back to Cravings unless I've exhausted the buffets at Paris, Bellagio, and especially the amazing Spice Market at Planet Hollywood! Sorry Cravings.",

I would recommend steering clear of this buffet and the Mirage in general.",

Brunch lasts til 3 pm, while dinner begins at 3pm, so we decided to go at 2:30pm, this way we could get dinner items too. I had heard and read great things about this buffet, and a few people had told me it was among the top 5 buffets on the strip, however I disagree. It was very good, but I think there are numerous better buffets. I absolutely adored the dessert selection! They had a wide variety of classic cakes, multiple gourmet desserts, as well as several sugar free and gluten free options. I found the creme brulee and lemon bars especially delicious. I also thoroughly enjoyed the king crab legs, guacamole, and clam chowder. Their soda machines were cool too. On the other hand, they had a pretty limited selection of sushi and italian, and a lot of the buns, muffins, and rolls were a bit too hard and didn't taste fresh at all. All in all, I'm satisfied and it was really good especially for the price paid, but I think there are plenty of better buffets in Vegas that should be gone to before Cravings.",

We felt welcome. The guy in the Chinese soup area was not friendly at all.   As for the food... Great miso soup, the tabbouleh was the best I've ever had and had awesome raspberry mouse. My hubby said his chili was good but I have to say that he didn't get seconds of anything and seemed pretty bored with most of the food.  It's probably about average for buffets and it wasn't outrageously expensive.  We left thinking we may not buffet again while we're in town.

We waited a long time and finally got to the cashier and she said we have about 45 mins before they close down. So, thinking we waited all this time for them to say this and was already aggregated @$160.00 for 4 people. We paid and still had to wait another 10 mins for a table. That leaves us with 30 mins ....   Family and I scattered to quickly get our food but there was almost nothing left. There was really nothing good left out to eat. I went to the crab table a few times and they never refilled it with more. It was left with scrap of nothing. They ran out of prime rib too. My Dad spoke with the Manager to let him know that there was not enough time and food left out on the floor. He said if we're not full at the end to let him know. He will give us a discount on the next visit. My daddy was not happy with the poor response from him. Food was all cleared out in 20 mins and manager came to our table treating us like we ate for free. He told us we're closed and told us to take exit and pointed to the way for us to leave. We never once had such an experience of being kicked out like that and the manner of the way he said it . Our Christmas Dinner was ruin and left us all unhappy.",

First of all $20 for lunch with such an extensive menu was a big bonus. Especially since most restaurants in Sin City would charge you $17 for a Subway-esque sandwich.  I loved that they had a little something for everyone. The coffee was YUMMY. The pizza was delish, bubbly cheese and spicy sauce right out of a brick oven. The prime rib was over cooked, but the baked ham was yummy. In the southern foods section they had the most amazing creamed corn ever. Fresh fresh FRESH jumbo shrimp w/ cocktail sauce. fantastic salad bar where they would make a personal salad for you. And absolutely kick ass kim chee.  But dessert....piece de resistance. I was so full I didn't originally even want any. But my friend said they had bread pudding, so I had to check it out. OMG. So so so good. Melt in your mouth magic. They also had a wide range of cakes, brownies, warm and gooey cookies, and homemade gelato.  What really made the whole experience though was the woman working in our section. Very attentive. Never let a plate sit on our table longer than a minute or two once we were done with it. She was fun and chatty and had great restaurant tips and show ideas. When I told her I loved the bread pudding she told us a great story about the origins of the recipe. AND THEN brought me a copy of it. And we aren't talking a new printed copy, it looked and felt like it had been pulled right out of the recipe binder from the kitchen! Totally amazing!!  I will definitely be back!",

I started there and I was extremely impressed by how fresh the ingredients were and how great the dressing tasted. PLUS, the little cheese display right next to the salads provided some delicious eats as well.  Everything else about the buffet was super disappointing though, aside from the service, which was actually pretty good. The food was not tasty and totally not worth as much as they were charging.",

Pasta was al dente and the flavors were done right, if not perfectly.  Everything else was just meh. Roasted duck was dry, not crispy, and didn't have much flavor to it. Congee was bland, lacked seasoning.  The desserts were average. Nothing really stood out other than the bread pudding, which was great.  The gf's orange juice was served in a glass with a lipstick marking on it, which was definitely not hers (she didn't even have lipstick on). That was a real bummer. The server just apologized and brought her another glass (a new one, i hope). Also, it took forever for someone to take our drink orders, we had to flag someone down to get our order. Maybe we were just impatient because we were so hungry.",

The food is just ok, highlights include the salad bar (you tell the server what you want and they mix it up for you), the crab legs were a good size, and the shrimp was already peeled. Other than that, it was a big pile of meh. The sushi, if you can call it that, was absolutely sad...little rolls of something that only half-resembled what you would buy at a cheapo convenience store. The asian section was blech, the pizza was ok if you prefer two inches of crust, and the rolls were hard. I used to like this buffet but it's just not the greatest. I'm giving it three stars as it is better than the one at Harrah's and I would still eat there if I was hankering for crab legs, but there are better options out there.",

However, my most recent trip I must say I was either really hungry or the food was really great. Or both...The meal ticket was a bit steep for two, but what buffet isn't nowadays in Vegas. I was just happy that I didn't have to pay extra for shrimp and cocktail sauce. And I was very surprised to see dim sum at 8 pm or so at night, but hey, it was delicious! And most of everything else I had, except for a view pieces of steak that were hecka dry and a hand roll that said there was some kind of fish in it but had nothing but some rice and veggies, it was quite alright. And I was very sad that the bar cost extra...[wipes tear away] Wish there had been more desserts to choose from, I didn't even see cheesecake, cupcakes, or cookies.

Heard roast beef is delish, juicy and tender.  Not much selections for dessert lovers tho.  I would rank this place as my 2nd choice for buffets after Wicked Spoon.",

The seafood was obviously frozen; I had to rip the crab legs apart with a fork and knife because there the cracker thing would only bend the shell, it was so saturated with water.  The bacon was undercooked and greasy, the sushi tasteless, the prime rib overdone, etc.  There was nothing there I would eat again.  I was really unimpressed, and my two dining companions were also less than thrilled.  It was 75 bucks for the three of us, and it wasn't worth it.",

    "text": "To review Las Vegas buffets I've broken it down into 4 sections.  Appetizers: Nice selection.  Cravings claim to fame is their new sections of global cuisine.  You can have some nice appetizers to entrees from each section.   Salads: Very nice salad section.  They will make custom salads to your order.  Main Entree: They have many worldly selections representing from China, Mexico, Japan, Italy and more..   Some are better than others but the variety is good and quality is above average.   Desserts: Since Cravings breaks everything out into their own sections, they have a decent dessert section as well.  Most are mass manufactured goods and some are custom, like the gelato.  I was torn to give them 3.5 or 4 stars, but decided to round it off to 4 stars since they deserve something better than a 3.  So if you have any \"Cravings\" for worldly cuisine, this is a good place to go.  Decor: 4 Stars (its been refreshed since the original opening) Service: 3 Stars (decent staff) Atmosphere: 3 Stars (its okay) Food Quality: 4 Stars (good quality) Quantity of Food: 5 Stars (its all you can eat) Price: 4 Stars (almost worth the high price)  For a Grand Total of 4 Stars.",

    "text": "Now the only reason my bf and I made it a point to eat here during one of our visits was because Cravings was voted one of the best buffets in LV!  My experience here was not what I expected.  After being a loyal customer at the Buffet @ Bellagio, I expected greatness after being named one of the top buffets on the strip.  What I CAN say about this place is that they have the best asian food I've tasted from international buffets such as cravings.  They had wonton soup, a beef noodle soup, and spring rolls!  I've never seen these options on a strip buffet so I was impressed.  The quality was good tho not as good as authentic asian food of course.  But their asian options by far exceeded other buffets of its kind.  The dessert selection was great.  Loved the gelato and the macaroons!!  I couldn't stop myself from getting seconds and thirds.    The prime rib was inconsistent.  Some slices were good and others were dry and unappetizing.  I think that the food here is solid and gives you a diversity of dishes that you don't find at other buffets on the strip.  I will applaud them for attempting to satisfy any \"cravings\" you may have be it pizza or sashimi. This place is decently priced for lunch and so if you are in the area and are starving this would be a viable option for you and your group.",

Saturday morning for around $25 they offer a fantastic UNLIMITED Champagne brunch with every food type imaginable.   They had all sorts of yummy Asian choices, a full breakfast area, three huge stations of crab legs, a meat carving station and a full dessert station with a huge assortment of gelato.  I was in hangover heaven.  The breakfast items were great and the pastries were yummy, but I would avoid the sushi (super dry)  The servers were super friendly and very quick with the mimosa refills! By the end of the brunch my friends and I each had three full mimosa glasses that they let us take TO-GO even topping off our cups on the way out.   Now that's the way to do it!!   Thanks to Cravings I was stuffed and on my way with a few afternoon cocktails :)",

    "text": "This used to be my favorite buffet in Vegas many years ago, so I decided to give it a try this past Sunday, and I was very disappointed!   Following are the reasons why:   1. $30 per person for brunch?!(Easter Weekend)   2. Our hostess was arguing loudly with the front personnel all the way to our table, over the head phone.   3. Although there were many stations(Carvings, Noodle, Raw Bar, Salad, Omelet Bar, Latin, Pasta, Dessert etc.) but nothing looked appetizing, some items even looked like they were defrosted from pre-made frozen packages.   4. Low Quality Foods: The Crab legs were still frozen, the hand rolls weren't made to order, and looked stale. I had them made a crepe for me, and it was the worst soggy, oily, oddly shaped crepe I've ever had! The wonton noodle soup was very bland, and the wonton was way over cooked with unknown filling. They've donuts and muffins at their dessert bar....am I at Home Town Buffet? why would anyone want to spent this much money for donuts & muffins??   The only pleasant experience I had was our waitress, who was friendly and attentive, and the prime rib was tasty. Other than that, Cravings really need to step up in order for people wanting to crave it!!",

    "text": "We used our BOGO breakfast buffet coupon from MyVegas game on Facebook. $20 and change for the two of us.  While this seems to be a very large buffet, it was lacking in selection.   There is an omelet station, and my omelet  was delicious.  That's where it ended. There were hash browns (shaved and barely browned) and no other style of potatoes.  Actually, very little food selections and you get your own drinks.  I think there are servers, but they don't serve you anything.  While I did see workers on the floor, they were not perky or happy.  Occasionally, I did see them clearing a table.  But there were many tables just waiting to be cleared--just full of dishes.  I wouldn't go back to have breakfast here again.  I'm glad we didn't pay full price, because it wouldn't have been worth it.  I wouldn't recommend this buffet to anyone.  But here is a perk--with that price, you get beer and wine --you have to go get it, but it is part of the price.  We didn't have beer or wine in mind with breakfast, but some people may like that :)",

    "text": "Cravings - perhaps the name best represents your hunger pangs AFTER your meal. I was very unimpressed.  So let's begin -  The pros:  Serve-yourself drink station. They have that new-fangled Coke machine (actually, it's been out for a few years) that allows you to customize your own drinks (as long as the syrup is part of the Coke family). Milk, coffee, cappuccino (don't get too excited - we're talking about the ones you find at the gas station mart).  Complimentary wine and beer. I cannot comment on this, since I did not partake.  A wide range of stations (Asian, Latin, Italian, et al).  The cons:  Remember that cappuccino machine? I tried a Vanilla Cappuccino, and it tasted watery. Evidently someone forget to check the powder level for the mix.  The food is seriously sub-par. Prime rib was cooked medium rare, but was inexplicably tough. The Asian foods were scary ick - sushi was sub-sub par (according to my wife), the shu mai (a type of dim sum) was mushy and tasteless. My wife said that the mashed potatoes had the consistency of paste - too bad we didn't have reams of newspaper, I could have started a paper-mache project.  The dessert section deserves its own paragraph of ill repute. There is a machine that says \"gelato\" - unfortunately, it spews something more like ice milk (\"something that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike gelato\"). There was Boston Creme Pie, which somehow lacked the Creme portion (I guess you cannot call it \"Boston Pie\"?), a concoction called \"Equator\" that left a weird brown smear that resembled the slime left by an apoplectic snail after binging on bad cabbage. And worse - no cheesecake. I mean seriously - have you ever been to a casino buffet that did not offer cheesecake? That's like going to a diner south of the Mason-Dixon Line that didn't offer grits....  The one saving grace is that our dinner had been comped. But even then we somehow felt short-changed.  Pro Tips:  Go for dishes that cannot be ruined. Pasta, white rice - this trip probably wouldn't be the best time to start that gluten-free diet.  Join M-Life (the loyalty program at the casino). I know I sound like a shill, but if you're going to play the tables and machines, you might as well earn points.  Play MyVegas. We earned the comps via the game. It's free - and you can get free stuff. You too can be Mike and Trent (let's see who caught that reference).",

I noticed that they switch out entrees that have been sitting out for awhile, so that's good to know. The best part was the unlimited alcohol that's included. That alone is worth the price of the buffet. The only reason. I'm not giving it 5 stars is because they didn't offer a hot shrimp entree, they only had shrimp cocktail.

    "text": "03/10/13 BRUNCH  I purchased a TravelZoo coupon, entitling spouse and I to a Sat or Sun brunch for 2 w/ unlimited \"champagne\" (sparkling wine) for $26 (+$1.58 tax, paid at venue, and tip).  Why not, I thought. We've never been.  Well, there are worse buffets in Las Vegas Valley (I'm talking off-Strip), but this has to be the worst buffet on the Strip. But it's at least passable (I've been to some off-Strip that would curl your hair!), and there were some midway-to-high points in the adventure.  Cashier was efficient and accommodating. Table service was great, lovely lady, not very friendly but attentive. She poured us our \"champagne\", Wycliff (just short of being bad, but drinkable by itself, so I was happy. I ordered an orange juice, swear to god, it tasted like TANG! Childhood memory! EW!  So what did we try? A LOT, but nothing from Mexico or Italy.   We got lots of stuff from the Asian section.  - Edimames: already shelled, nice. - Japanese potato salad: nice. - A little sushi: only the octopus was good, the others were grocery store style. - Chinese buns: spouse liked them, pork & seafood, I only had the seafood, too doughy. - Potstickers: good. Spouse liked these quite a bit, actually.  Then on to the seafood section. - Large shrimps: good. But the cocktail sauce was obviously from a jar. Took a little drawn butter instead back to the table, that was nice. - Bay shrimps, various preparations: avoid. - Ceviches: avoid. - Crab legs: the thinnest, chewiest, worst crab legs I've ever encountered. I took only one, ate half, yuck. Never again.  Spouse had lots more. What was it? Oh, biscuits/gravy (I tasted, so-so), some kind of potatoes gratin, what else? He was OK with all of it. Me, I had read the ups and downs of the prime rib. \"Only get it rare\", some have posted here. Well, spouse came back with a small non-rare, and it was so-so, he only ate half. I went, got bloody rare, huge piece, ate nearly the entire thing, I was very happy! Not the greatest prime rib, of course, but still, it was really good, at the end of the savory foods.  If there were ever a next time, I think I'd stick to the Asian section, try some of those egg-drop soups, etc.  Desserts? Sad. \"Mirage bread pudding\" was a mishmash of runny bottom of pan with hard-ass top of portion. Not good. The creme brulee was so-so. The only recommended ones we'd say would be the raspberry bar (very fruity, probably jam, but who cares!) and the marshmallows covered in dark chocolate (which were light after a huge meal like ours).   To sum up. I would never go there and pay full price. I'd rather spend that money at the new Bacchanal @ Caesars, Wicked Spoon @ Cosmo, Bellagio, ARIA, etc. BUT if you get comp'd or get a great coupon deal, like that TravelZoo, I'd go and make the best of it.",

    "text": "TOO MUCH FOOD. I always end up eating way too much at Vegas buffets. Mainly because they are so much better than ordinary buffets AND you have to eat enough to make up for the price you pay to get in. As far as Cravings go, it was alright. I ate some stuff that I wish I hadn't tried, and I ate some stuff that I loved. It's always like that at a buffet.   I loved the layout of this buffet. It was must less hectic and cramped which I appreciated. It's clean, and typically modern and each section is divided up by the type of food it offers. My sister and I had a fun time trying each section at a time and by the time we got around to every single one, we were barely eating anything we got on our plates (bad bad bad!). I think some of my favorites were the mussels, ravioli, and the shrimp cocktails. My siblings and I also gorged on the nachos we loaded up with toppings. I would pass on the sushi because the rice was just so hard. If you're like us, you will just eat the fish and hide the rice under some other dish. If you're super Korean like my parents, you will like the fact that they serve kimchi. They had a pretty huge selection on desserts. The cupcakes are GROSS so please pass on those. Actually pretty much all the desserts were kind of unappetizing. Some of the cookies were okay but that's about it. My brothers liked the gelato they served but I was too full to try it.   BUFFETS BUFFETS BUFFETS. I have a love hate relationship with them. My sister and I burned off most of the calories clubbing later so it's all good. 3/5",

    "text": "First off, I only went here because my mom did a museum tour and the locals that gave the tour said this place was the best buffet for the price.  When I went with my wife and parents, we were amazingly surprised. First, I am active duty military and my dad is retired military.  When we went to pay before entering, we found out its about 50% off for military.  That took the ~$75 bill per person and made it much more favorable. Second, it was unlimited wine and beer, they had Draft Beer (some type of micro-brew I don't really drink beer) and Moscato (sweet white wine that my wife and mom love) - so it was pretty awesome.   Third, the food was amazing diverse.  Usually the seafood is old stale crab legs or some small amount of good stuff... This place had tons of fresh shrimp, crab legs, oysters, and a seafood soup that was pretty bomb.  They had both well done and medium rare prime rib, turkey, and the normal sides for a carving station.  Chinese section with your normal selections with all fresh vegetabls which was pretty amazing.  An Italian section, with a create your own pasta bar thing - which was pretty entertaining.  They also had a Japanese/Sushi area which although not the best, worked out. The deserts were plentiful and they had creme Brule (however you spell it) which both my wife and mother love. The fact they are military friendly, have a diverse selection, and everything is fresh makes this place a great choice to go to if you ever have the chance.  I will definitely go again next time I go here.",

It's probably one of the better \"cheap buffet\" options. \"Cheap\" in price compared to the big names anyways (Bellagio, Caesars, Wynn, etc). Plenty of food options, food seemed to always be fresh, and the desserts were great. If you want ambience / premier service, go to Bellagio or the Wynn, but if you just want endless food for a decent price (or free if you're like us), the Mirage buffet is just fine.  We had no wait for lunch entry at 2:30pm on a Sunday. When we left, during dinner entry (around 3:45) there still wasn't much of a line.",

    "text": "Meh. I tried this buffet after being blown away by the buffet at Bellagio, and was mildly disappointed after visiting this one.   The staff was friendly and attentive but we had to get our own drinks. I liked that Bellagio brought them to the table. Also, the free wine that comes with the meal is awful. The Chardonnay was bitter and super dry instead of smooth and buttery, which is what I like, personally, in a Chardonnay. I opted for Sprite Zero after a sip or two.   The assortment of food was kind of... Off. Nothing really matches. The barbecue section had not one item with BBQ sauce and no grilled items; it consisted of hot wings, cabbage and nothing else I would see at a BBQ joint down south.  The Latin section had quail, tortilla chips and potatoes.  As I walked around it was hard to decide what to build my meal out of because it was all so random.   The good: prime rib was juicy, shumai was scrumptious.  The bad: The broccoli stir fry in the Chinese section was bitter and greasy. Wine selection was awful.  The ugly: The creme brulee was liquidy and the sugar on top was not at all crispy-- it had the consistency of flan. The pizza dough wasn't cut all the way through and it was pretty gross watching people pull it apart with their hands, leaving pieces they touched behind.   My advice- go to Bellagio instead. So much better!!",

    "text": "Not a mere meal, an event.  At least if you eat (and drink) like I do, it is.   \"Buffet, meet Jessica.\"  *buffet runs away screaming*  I can safely say that this is my favorite buffet for champagne brunch in Vegas.  I have now been here three out of the last three times I have been in Vegas and plan to make it four out of four whenever my next Vegas adventure may be.  The mimosas are truly bottomless, and the service is friendly and attentive.   I love that they're open on Saturdays as well as Sundays and especially that brunch runs until 3pm (because let's face it an \"early start\" is anytime before noon in Vegas time).  The crab legs never run out.  They have a beautifully fresh and bountiful seafood section that overflows with an abundance of various shellfish, as well as a tasty selection of hot seafood dishes.   This is what stole my heart and kept me coming back.     I love that they have a wide variety of international cuisines to choose from, with plenty of emphasis on the Asian styles (my favorites!) including sushi, dim sum, assorted pho and ramen soups, Thai, Chinese, and the like.   I tried my first (good) Ramen here, and that is the bowl that first sold me on it as a legitimate cuisine.   There is also a selection of Mexican, Italian, Indian, Mediterranean, and so many other types of food I can't even think of them all.   They also have a nice array more common american-ish foods here including a rotisserie (serving prime rib and other meats), fried everything, any side dish I can ever remember having on my parents' dinner table, a salad bar, and all breakfast-y  foods imaginable including an omelette bar and waffle station.   And then there's dessert.  (If you have any hidden nook in your tummy that is not stuffed full at this point.)   A decadent assortment of chocolate and baked everything.  Cue sugar coma.   Keep in mind that it *is* a buffet so you are not going to get sushi that is equal to the best sushi restaurant you've ever eaten at or prime rib as good as the Michelin joint up the street ...  but considering how (comparatively) little you are paying the selection, sheer volume, and the fun experience make up for that in my opinion.  I don't consider this my 'fine dining' experience of the weekend... it's more of the 'lets see how many mimosas and crab legs we can shove in our faces in 2 hours then walk around Vegas all drunk-and-full-like for the next few hours' way to start your day/weekend.   For that, I will keep coming back until the mimosas stop flowing.",

    "text": "Weve been to this buffet for sunday brunch almost every single vegas trip we do. But... after our last experience a week ago. Im not sure we will ever return. It only takes one bad employee/ experience to ruin it forever for a place.  So basically my bad experience was with one of the employees. Those insignificant people that clear your table and take your empty plates. Well apparently this lady thought she was on the fast track to upper management the more people she \"caught\" eating that didn't pay. So with my personal experience, my 3 year old daughter already had previously ate before we got there plus even if she was fully hungry she wouldn't have ate more than a few bites. I didn't feel the need to pay for her \"admission\", and she was caught eating two pieces of bacon. OMG.... OH NOOOOO THE WORLD IS GOING TO END because a 3 year old didnt pay for 2 pieces of bacon. So any way, this lady made the biggest scene it was fu**king embarrassing. But after giving us lip, she just left. So i sat there and i watched this lady like a hawk. Cause now shes on my radar. So i watched her find 3 other tables with ADULTS who didnt pay for one person.  And there she was... to make a huge scene where other diners are staring. So embarrassing.  But she also left them alone without charging them. So why act like some sort of narc? For the adults, thats pretty bad... i agree. But come on. Get off your high horse when  it comes to children who just nibble.  You and i know 1000's upon 1000's of perfectly good food gets thrown out just by this one establishment alone (watch the andrew Zimmerman episode las vegas buffets). And she was having a cow over a child.  Anyways... end of rant and i probably wont return.",

We used to come here EVERY visit, as it was reasonable and food was awesome, but we'll likely skip and just pay a bit more for the Wynn Buffet - big difference in food quality, flavor and selection!  Prices at $33/Adult weeknight dinner is ok.  But, definitely NOT ok for $24/Child!  (7 year olds don't eat that much!)  We've heard about 2-for-1 coupons, so if you have that, it's TOTALLY be worth it, but not at full price for kids.  Open and airy atmosphere.  Food selection is good, but some are just not the quality or flavor we remembered :(.  Some were just overcooked :(   Service was quick and friendly, but dinner now includes wine or beer, and there is self-serve drinks, so wait staff just clears plates.",

I totally enjoyed this buffet for about an hour. We definitely took advantage of the unlimted beer and wine too. It tasted like Sutter Home or Crane Lake wine but I cant complain. The line during Memorial Day weekend was like a 20 minute wait but that's cool bc at least with a buffet once you get seated you start eating vs waiting and then waiting to order, get food made and etc.  From what I can remember everything on my plate was good. They had the already cracked crab legs and plenty different options. It was nicely setup and our waitress stayed on top of her game! Overall great buffet experience, but nothing spectaular stood out besides the unlimited beer and wine.",

The Review: I remember going here awhile back and loving my experience. This time I was left very disappointed. The first thing we did after we landed on Sunday morning was eat at this buffet. I loooooove breakfast buffets so I was happy to see we made it in time for the brunch hour. The place wasn't very packed so lines weren't an issue (as they typically are for dinner). My first order of business was to get a nice omelette...it did not disappoint.  The placement of the usual side dishes you'd find with breakfast and the quality did disappoint, however. The hashbrowns were in the Latin section, the bacon was in the carving area. The hasbrowns had no taste, and felt like they've been sitting out for awhile.  Second order of business was to get a nice prime rib, this did not disappoint.  Then I finished my time at the deli section with an assortment of sliced meats, smoked salmon, and cheese and crackers. This was pretty good as well...hmm I started this review at 2 stars, but I think I just talked myself into giving it 3.  Overall I wasn't very impressed and expected a lot more for a $30 buffet, but it wasn't that bad.",

The meat (prime rib, salmon, sausage) was all over cooked. The pasta was cold. The dessert bar was lack luster. The menu posted outside specifically stated \"hot lava cake\" (the reason my in-laws wanted to eat there) but it was not actually being served.  The server cleared that table only twice despite the 18% gratuity.",

    "text": "If you are a simpleton and like basic foods, this is the place for you.  I normally like to explore foods of a higher culinary expertise, though I do still appreciate the basics.  If you fit this category, read on..  I was visiting Las Vegas with my parents and trying to show them why the buffets here are impressive, and after searching Yelp for the right one, I chose Cravings.  We were there at about 8pm on a Saturday night.  There was no line, which probably should have been an indication that it wasn't great, but at that point we had been looking for the \"perfect\" buffet and were just tired of searching.  They had a wide variety of categories to choose from: Italian, carved meat, Latin, Mediterranean, Seafood, Sushi, Chinese and Salad.  However, within each category was the most basic of each food.    Italian: Pizza, pastas with either marinara or alfredo sauces. (I was hoping for fire baked crust and made-to-order pizzas, rather than old, hard cheese and meat) Carved meat: Prime rib or Turkey (where was the sirloin steak and  Latin: Texas chili (not Latin!), tamales, and enchiladas Mediterranean: pita bread, babaganoush, hummous.  (that's it??) Seafood: chilled cocktail shrimp and crab legs (they were too salty) and baked tilapia and salmon (typical) Chinese: stir friend veggies, beef chow mein, fried rice, orange chicken (comparable to Panda Express) Salad: romaine lettuce with your choice of dressing, and vegetable toppings (I was hoping for fruit toppings and candied nuts)  And for dessert:  only a couple of selections of pie: dutch apple, raspberry chocolate silk, lemon merengue, and sugar free cheesecakes.  Throw in a few choices of rock-hard cookies and fresh fruit.  I was expecting much more, to say the least.  I probably won't be coming back again, with or without my parents.  They weren't really impressed and we all felt that money spent on food did not match the quality.  This being said, I have been to the buffet at Aria, and was much more impressed... See Aria for further review.",

I still couldn't imagine giving more than 3 stars to any buffet (unless they were just out-of-this-world-effing-fantastic) so I think this place was pretty decent as far as buffets go.    $25 was a reasonable price for offerings of crab legs, sushi, prime rib, chicken, etc galore.  I didn't try any dishes with beef or chicken, so my review is slightly biased.   Pros: Attentive service Delicious grilled orange roughy, mussels and cioppino Wide array of different dishes, including Asian, Mediterranean, American, and Italian Salad bar with great offerings and freshly tossed just for you GELATO!!!  OMG delicious!  Cons: Crab legs were a bit salty so I was disappointed that I couldn't gorge on them like I wanted to Dessert variety was wide, but not very good  I know I've complained about buffets before, but this place was pretty a-ok.  I'm sure it's not the best and certainly not the worst offered on the Vegas strip.",

Word of Warning: It is tempting to heap your plate full of food, but keep in mind (I made this mistake) food gets COLD on your plate and stays HOT in the serving area!  I piled my plate up with too much food my first time around, and it cooled off as I was making my way through it.   So disappointing.  The food itself was pretty good, I sampled a bit of everything and nothing was bad.  I kept going back to the congee though, it was just so damn comforting.  I also may or may not have had an entire plate of bacon.  It's just how I roll...  Service was fine, our waitress kept my mimosa glass full so I can't complain!  (They walk around with bottles of champagne alongside water pitchers and top you off...so after a little bit you it's just champagne with very little OJ).  Unlimited bloody marys is another option (same price as mimosas).",

This is spoken from a person with buffet experience. We had the breakfast and I was impressed.  The plantains were insaine (in a good way), the apple crepes rocked my world and the french toast and migas were also amazing.  They had a make your own omlett station in which you did not cook at all but your ordered someone else to make this portion of your meal.  Nice dessert selection, especially for a breakfast, although it is hiding on the other side of the buffet.  Yum Yum Yum. Do it.",

The waffles were not crisp and tasted like cardboard,  the french toast was okay, and the pre-cooked eggs tasted like powdered egg crap (which is typical at buffets).   I thought about giving them a second chance for dinner, based on Yelp reviews, but my brain and taste buds dictate that if I'm at the Mirage for dinner, I'm going to Kokomo's.",

    "text": "We enjoyed our lunch this time around at Cravings.  We've tried The Village at Paris, Spice Market buffet at Planet Hollywood, The Buffet at Treasure Island, and Flavor at Harrah's.  We weren't too impressed at our last visit to Cravings.  It was much better this time.  The restaurant walls are all glass so you can see out and people can see in.  We got a nice table for four in the middle of everything and a nice waitress who brought drinks and cleared the table when she came by.  The first section has someone who is usually making egg dishes.  In our case, omelets.  They will sautee the onions, bacon, and mushrooms and then add it to the omelete.  They have one main guy and he has helpers.  They have a tip jar too.   Next section along the wall was some cooked items, eggs benedict, either waffles or pancakes.  Whatever was there, a customer in front of me wanted what wasn't there.  Then there is the meat person.  He had turkey  and prime rib.  The prime rib was well done.  There was au jus and turkey gravy in that section too.  Next was the roast chicken section, fondue and bread/crackers. The fondue didn't harden by the time I got to the table and it tasted okay.  The next wall had mexican food, but it wasn't well organized or I was going the wrong way.  I walked by cheese, then the meat, chips, taco, and tortillas, salsa, and enchiladas.  Before I forget, the enchiladas were good.   There was some ceviche and tiny shrimps in little glasses, shrimp on ice in the cubby holes in the walls.  I don't have a good way to describe it.  I tried the clam chowder and it needed pepper.  The texture was clam chowder and it looked good, but it wasn't really tasty.  There was a Japanese counter.  I thought the crunchy spicy tuna roll and unagi roll was too cold.   The Chinese counter had shrimp flavored chips, yummy, but greasy. It was either a gyoza or potsticker and it was on it's own little plate with a little sauce.  It's the presentation.  Everything was clean.  Hot and sour soup was the right texture but not enough flavor.  Chinese noodles and rice, sauteed veg and sweet and sour chicken or pork.  I didn't try it.  The last section was dessert.  They had mini cupcakes.  I liked the chocolate and regular creme brulee cups.  There were also tiramisu in a little cup and I think it was a berry flavor panna cotta.  And the very end had a gelato section.  The tiramisu gelato was good. There is a lot of food dishes that I'm not mentioning.  The Village was our favorite at one time, same with the others, but we go back and then we are disappointed.  The eggs benedict wasn't very good, the hollandaise sauce didn't stand out.  The presentation is usually much better at Cravings.  There's so much food that we kind of try everything and then we are full.    Summary - Cravings was better than our last trip.  Kids were happy, waitress was nice, no dishes were really bad, everything was clean and presentation was nice.  We'll be back and we'll also go back to the other buffets too.",

The first time we were waiting for our room to be ready early in the morning. We walked around the different options but found that regular breakfasts would cost the same amount, or more, as the buffet (14.99 I believe). The choice was pretty obvious.  BREAKFAST:  yummy pastries- the muffins, cookies, and donuts were delicious. The croissants not so much.  bagels with lots of different toppings omelette station ( I didn't try but looked good) fresh fruits cereal deli meats and cheeses good hash browns  One complaint is that the waitress kept forgetting my water. I asked for it maybe 4 times. She kept bringing me coffee and juice, so it's not that she was not attentive. Not a big deal!  THe next time we went for lunch because as we were having breakfast we saw some of the stuff they were going to have for lunch and it sounded great (gelato!!).   LUNCH  highlights: Prime rib!! (SO GOOD!) ceviche (scallops and shrimp) pot stickers seafood salad (you choose the toppings and they make it/toss it for you) Gelato! lots of options and toppings!!!! The presentation and the way that it is made is also fun. the bar!! - mimosas/champagne were not included since it was a friday. But I really wanted one! the bartender checked and it was 11.99. I thought it was a bit much for a mimosa, specially considering how the sparkling wine was $9! The bartender, however, was able to ring it up as $9 for me. He also changed the channels for us and was great about cleaning up our dirty plates and refilling our soft drinks. A+ for him!",

We came in on a Sunday around 4, and the place was pretty empty.  Drinks were brought quickly and consistently to our table.  The overall look of the buffet is very modern, very clean.  Stations were spaced out and organized neatly.  There were large options, from seafood, to chinese, to italian, etc., etc.    The food was good!  The seaweed salad was insanely delicious.  I had some veggie sushi, some shrimp, baked salmon...  Finished my meal off with bread pudding and a coconut macaroon.  My husband had and enjoyed the prime rib.  The only thing we noticed - you might be better off coming here when it is actually busier, because it looked like a lot of the food had been sitting for a bit.  Busier buffet = higher turnover on the food!!!  Anyhow, worth coming to for sure, and we look forward to coming back next trip.",

They reduced the cost of dinner to 28 dollars but the food selection is now half of what it used to be  Also, at the start of dinner at around 530pm one would expect fresh food, but most of it had the 4 hour under a dry heat lamp look to it.  Asked our server why the food looked stale and he said it shouldn't.. Ill pass it along to the manager *rollseyes*  Lastly food quality dramatically dropped. Save your money and goto McDonald's instead for better food quality",

The place was practically empty.  So you would think the staff would be attentive.  But that wasn't the case.  Our waiter was slow.  And there was no one at the ice cream stand to dip so I had to wait for about 3 minutes while I yelled back \"Hello\".  The crab legs were okay (they were better at Bellagio and Aria).  The prime rib was about the only good thing there.  For a buffet called \"Cravings\" there was very little that I was craving.  It was like they were trying too hard to be different.  The only pasta in the Italian section was a filled tortellini.  Do I really need someone to toss my salad?  The only good thing is that I was able to get this comped.",

The carving station was very inconsistent. My prime rib was dreadful, but my bf had a good piece. I also made the mistake of trying some ham, which was salty and dry. As for the seafood section, the crab was actually okay... not awesome but okay.  The shrimp cocktail was not fresh at all though. They had smoked salmon which can't go wrong at all.   Desserts: the only thing that appealed to me were the coconut macaroon cookies. The ONLY good dessert. That's really sad because I love sweets.",

Cravings lived up to its reputation.  We walked right in and were seated immediately. I think we came right between breakfast and lunch so it was pretty quiet but everything was available and the food was excellent. I filled my plate up with Asian selections before I even made it to the other side of the buffet so I had to go back for a second plate. :P   The dessert offerings were impressive as well. There were plenty of sugar-free options which was nice.   Definitely enjoyed this buffet and I would absolutely come here again in the future.",

Only good for people who like to drink and don't care for food quality as the price includes unlimited wine and beer. Other than that, the layout of the buffet was weird and the food choices were extremely limited. The snow crab didn't even have crab in them! It was a pile of empty shells. Desserts were absolutely awful and again, limited selection. You have to go get your own drink (water, sodas, juice, etc) all the way in the back of the room (we were seated towards the entrance so that was a LONG trek).   They charge $39.99 midweek which I think is a total rip if you're just looking to eat and not drink. Go to aria or bellagio for good food. Go here if you just want unlimited booze.",

And you don't have to wait in a super long 1-hour line which is a plus!  I was actually pleasantly surprised by this buffet! I really didn't expect much because it's in the Mirage hotel and I'd never really heard of it but they actually have a huge variety. Quality isn't all there for some of the food items, but there is a HUGE variety of eclectic food. And I love how every section is neatly labeled (ex. \"chinese\", \"sushi\", \"mexican\", \"desserts\", \"salad\", etc) so you can go for exactly what you want.   Some food highlights:  1. The prime rib was surprisingly really good! Red, soft, and juicy. My friend asked if they had cranberry sauce, and they went to the back and brought a huge bowl out for us. So nice of them!  2. They have fried plantains!! Yessss!  3. Crab legs were cracked open in half already like at Bellagio buffet so it's easier to eat but I didn't like the way they tasted. It was pretty much frozen cold and was too salty/fishy for my taste.   4. The eggs benedict looks really nice, but it was a little too bland in my opinion.   5. They have sriracha sauce if you need that with your chinese food like I do!  6. They have a gelato bar hidden in the corner next to the desserts! Note: it's NOT self serve. So don't try to go back there by yourself and scoop your own.  Just wait patiently and someone will come to help you. ;)",

    "text": "TLDR - Average buffet at best. Decent selection of options, but most things aren't worth eating. Spend your $40 at an actual restaurant instead.   My friends and I came for Sunday brunch for $36/person. Not sure if there are different prices for brunch and dinner, but brunch ends at 3pm. There's also free beer/wine until 3pm. We came exactly at 3pm though so technically we missed that, but our hostess still told us that beer/wine was free, although we didn't end up having any.  There's a decent selection of food, but nothing's really great. Honestly, my friends and I thought the best thing we had were the veggies... Your $40 would be better spent at a nice restaurant instead.   HITS: broccoli (Italian), BBQ ribs and sauteed cabbage (American), crab legs and shrimp (fishmonger), bread pudding (dessert)  Overall, meats and fish were generally dry. Sushi and Asian food was terrible.  * AMERICAN BBQ ribs were actually pretty good as long as you found a tender piece. Otherwise, the sauce was still good but dry meat was not worth eating. Same thing with the grilled flank steak - go for the tender, medium rare if you can find a slice. Sauteed cabbage was pretty good.  * LATIN AMERICAN I only tried the Cajun chicken here, parts of which were okay, but mostly it was pretty dry. There's also chips and guac/salsa and some other things.  * ASIAN Noodles, stir fry, seafood bun, spring rolls, potstickers, etc. I'd skip everything in this section  * SUSHI I'd skip the sushi too. The fish in the rolls and nigiri wasn't very fresh and the rice was hard.   * FISHMONGER Probably your best bet here and where you'd get your money's worth. Crab legs and shrimp were pretty fresh.  * ITALIAN The broccoli here was unanimously the best thing my group had (sadly). The pizza wasn't bad, but I'd skip the meats and fish.   * CARVING There was prime rib, portuguese sausage and turkey at the carving station. The prime rib was kind of inconsistent. I got an okay slice but some people got really dry parts. The portuguese sausage wasn't bad. There was also salmon (dry) and mac and cheese (solid) and some other things like mashed potatoes that I didn't try.   * SALAD Very simple salad options, bread (avoid please) and Italian meats like salami and ham.  * DESSERTS Lots of options, including some sugar-free ones: cakes, cupcakes, bars, cookies, bread pudding, fruit, soft service ice cream/sorbet, etc. The cakes/cupcakes were pretty dry, the cookies were hard as rocks (how long ago were they made??), and fruit was rather acidic. Soft serve/sorbet was decent. The only thing I really liked here was their bread pudding, but make sure you get a freshly made batch of it.  There's also the CHEF'S KITCHEN, where they make you fresh pasta, but I didn't try any because I'm not really a pasta person.",

No other place we went to in the 4 days we were gave any type of discount.   The crab legs are split in half and were easier to eat. Our Grandsons love crab and shrimp and were in heaven. The Chef makes pasta and you can offer him a tip. Again, I say that Buffets that already charge $30 per person should not expect us to tip their cooks for  cooking something that should be included in the buffet already.   Their prime rib was delicious. I skipped the salad bar and filled up on potatoes and prime rib. It was as good as any place I've been.   My husband went for the Asian food and wasn't thrilled at all.   Dessert was fun. A little of everything. I would complain only of the dirty carpet and cramped tables. There was  not enough room to move around. All in all, for the amount of $$ we spent here, it was acceptable. Thank you for honoring your Military.",

So we decided to go for breakfast the next day. Seriously great spread. The breakfast burritos and chilaquiles were outstanding. I couldn't get enough of the French toast and warmed syrup with the strawberries. The pastry table had a huge selection. And my absolute favorite tho g was at the carving station.

The design is so much more friendly than the old set up.  The only thing I thought was that the seating looked almost like diner seats but that didn't matter.  There is a wide variety of stations from which to choose.There are: Italian, carving, Rotisserie, Latin, Raw Bar, Fishmonger, Noodles, Chinese, Salad, and Desserts.  Those are the names on the lights at each of the areas.  Standouts tonight were the asparagus, lobster bisque soup--better than what I had recently at a high end Strip restaurant, the ravioli, and the desserts.  I mark them down because their prime rib that was supposed to be rare was more medium than rare even though she cut into a new piece.  I could have told her to cut in the middle, but she took from the end.  The dessert selection was nice.  I had some red velvet cake, a cookie, and the newest serving idea--a chocolate shaped mini tea/coffee cup filled with chocolate mousse and topped with whipped cream.  Service was very good.  In fact I had to stop her from refilling my iced tea so many times because I was going to a show and I didn't want to have to leave in the middle for a bathroom break.  The buffet is priced a little less than the highest rated ones and I can see why.  I can see myself coming back sometime.",

    "text": "Great experience to have a nice Buffett in Las Vegas!  This is one of my sons favorite eateries! As for me it's a multi- national food emporium that includes Asian, Latino, Italian, American, and a seafoods and carving stations! Of course it's a help yourself place s very cafeteria style! They also have a bar where house wines and tap beer are included but you can get a mixer if you want the extra charge. I was impressed with the quality of the food and the amount of choices and each section had its own seasoned specialties!  My family always gets a kick out of how I eat at a Buffett but I am not a waster but I am a taster and I try to take a small taste of as many main menu items as I can! I can honestly say there was a few I did miss here!  My son does recommend the Crab legs if he left any!  The people who waited our tables were very attentive to keep us uncluttered and often asked if our waters need refilling!  It's a great place if your thinking your ready to pig out in Vegas!",

We went for early dinner on  Monday and it was quite vacant; however, from what I could see the Mirage did not hold back on their offerings. I pricked up discount tickets from tix2night that worked very smoothly. Had sushi, prime rib, BBQ ribs, pork tamale, prepared to order pasta that was excellent,  wine was so-so, but that was not my reason for going. Their deserts were excellent as well. The Creme Brulee and the Mirage Bread Pudding with vanilla sauce were delicious.   We did return again in a few days latter as the Mirage offered us dome 2 for 1 tickets during our first dinner. This time it was for Lunch and was equally fabulous. The food is very fresh and the staff is very prompt and professional.",

Chinese station-  eggplant- super salty seafood bun (my friend tried it and warned us not to get it) dumpling in the noodle soup (my friend tried it said ok, noodle and dumpling not as mushy as we thought since it's not made to order)                                Latin Station- pork chop- overcooked, dry and salty  Japanese station- sushi- horrible (old and cold rice, not so fresh fish) seaweed salad- average                                   Carving station: Salmon- overcooked                           Prime rib- overcooked and really bad quality of meat  Salad station- make your own salad  Everything is fresh and the woman worked behind the counter was really nice. However they don't have any special ingredient not even arugula.  Dressing is pretty standard too.   sauteed vegetables or salad from different stations were all not bad.    Mac n cheese- super marshy  (couldn't finish it)  crackers with few different choices of cheese- standard  hummus with super cold display like pita bread- standard  Dessert station- nothing looks very appetizing.  cream brulee- the caramelized top was such a failure. It tasted like soft syrup layer float on top of it. We normally like cream brulee but it's just bad no one want to get another one..  cookie- alright, your typical cookie. As I remembered the buffet at M resort or Pala were way better for the dessert option.   Drink station: iced tea and coffee, standard. The machine made it difficult to make iced coffee your own.  also they have unlimited beer and wine if you drink.   Didn't try anything else. I actually forgot to try the crab legs and cocktail shrimps!  I am quite disappointed the quality of food here that probably not even compare to those casino buffet near LA. Service was fast and nice though.   My friend got resort credit for $75 and had 2 buy one get one free deal from MyVegas so the meal was basically free.   But if you have to pay for it...avoid at all cost.",

The boyfriend and I came here for brunch on a weekend because we purchased the Travelzoo deal online. What a mistake.   Attitude from the cashier up front and then charging us $1.58 for taxes after the voucher. Are you kidding me? Ugh. Got seated to some uncleaned tables. They probably just wiped it once and set the utensils. The waiter finally walks by after about 10 minutes of sitting and says \"What do you want to drink?\" \"Umm.. good morning to you too. What do you have?\" \"What do you want?\" .....Well, orange juice it is...  The food was very mediocre. Eggs Benedict was bland. Sausage patties were hard. Salad was warm. Soup was watered-down.

It did come with bottomless poor quality momosas, bitter IPS beer, or bottom shelf wine. If it's crap, is it worth anything being bottomless?  The quality of the foods were more miss than hits. I couldn't eat any more because of the food and not because I was too full.  The layout was difficult since it was all on an outside ring with a tight seated middle area. I ran into many people while just trying to get some food. They only let people get food on one side of the carts instead of two sides which also added to the difficulties of the food getting logistics.  The service seemed to be having a bad day and gave off a rude anger so we really didn't want to bother her at all and said polite thank you's to her anytime she did anything. It wasn't a great experience.",

When we questioned a manager,Steven, who took15 minutes to show up, he said that the other beers we'd had the day before (goose island IPA, coors and bud light bottles)were just loose ones leftover. They didn't have any to offer. So they hand out leftover beer? Really?  He even said that what the bartender said didn't make sense that the beer was available in the cooler, but they were charging for it. My guess is that the do better by the guests when it isn't as crowded and cut back during peak times. Too bad the can't offer some slightly nicer options for $33 dinner buffets.

The big attraction for me was that unlimited beer (and wine) was included in the price.  The majority of the food -- and I sampled a LOT -- was above average.  I didn't care for the crab legs, and the mac and cheese was terrible.  So avoid those.  High marks go to the carving stations.  Prime rib, sausage, corned beef -- all fantastic.

All the Asian food was very Americanized, like stuff you'd find at panda express. The wonton soup was pretty good, but the wontons were not.   My family and I liked the assortment of beverages which lined an entire wall.   As for seafood, there was pretty much just cocktail shrimp and king crab legs.   Dessert: many of them look dry. The cheesecake was weirdly sour, like it was supposed to be lemon cream cake. The cookies were really hard and not chewy or delicious. The three mixed berries was actually pretty good, but a bit too sweet.   Besides the quality of food, the wait staff were very friendly and courteous. The whole place was clean.",

    "text": "This is getting a bad review due to customer service, not food quality. I can't actually speak to the food, as we didn't get to eat here this trip  and I don't remember the last time well enough.  We were given a coupon during our stay in Vegas last summer, when we dined here, for a 2 for 1 brunch buffet, any day of the week, anytime before 3pm, with No Expiration Date. It was to encourage us to return to eat here again sometime in the future. We were counting on this deal this time around, to allow us to have a good meal before our current on-a-budget stay in Vegas was over.  When we got to the buffet cashier, we were told that they wouldn't accept our coupon, because they are no longer honoring that deal. They said the coupons where being given out too much, so they stopped taking them. Well...fine, stop handing them out, but honor the ones that were already given out. It isn't our fault that you over estimated your popularity.  We talked to the Food and Beverage Manager, and he condescendingly told us he'd give us 20% off on \"good faith\" on 2 full price buffets, so $20 per person instead of $12. No.  What he SHOULD have done, what the SMART, \"good faith\" choice would've been, was to honor the deal the restaurant made with us when they issued us the coupon with No Expiration Date!  Then, he'd have 2 satisfied customers who would give them good reviews, instead of 2 pissed off ones, who will Yelp, Facebook, and just plain Tell everyone we know to choose a different dining option and never this one.  It isn't fair, or honest, and it's just bad business practice.  Not really the point, but it isn't like either of us are large enough people to cost them a lot of money anyway.  Just saying, MAYBE 1 and a half plates of food each, not even enough to add up to the $12 discount price in actual product. Well worth the cost for them to exhibit good customer care and keep us coming back when we had more to spend in the future.  Go elsewhere. Mandalay Bay has a VERY nice buffet, affordable too, with extremely nice people working for them. Choose them instead. Stay away from the uppity Mirage.",

Wicked Spoon, Bacchanal and other upper tier buffets are much better, while other hotel buffets are about on par with the Mirage.  Price wise it's similar to any other Vegas buffet on the strip not mentioned above. Selection is decent and pretty standard. Different cuisines all organized around the eating area. The AYCE beer and wine stand out, but food is just a-okay.  We redeemed our myVEGAS reward here and the total came out to about $15 a person for dinner which was great.   I also saw that they offer a to-go box for around $16 and just get as much as you can from the buffet, which doesn't sound like a bad deal.",

Some of the dishes you could tell had been sitting out for awhile (the corn bread was so hard it crumbled when I tried breaking it, one of the cookies was also completely hard you couldn't even bite into it.) The freestyle coke machine was cool and everything was self served so it was nice to just be able to get my own things. They also have free drinks at the bar. Overall the food was okay.",

If you hit the info booth outside, they will offer you a 30% discount coupon that will bring your meal price down to 22 bucks! Worth it then!  Liza was way too cool! Don't tip when first paying at booth. Leave tip at table if waitress cleans up after you!  Hey, you're in Vegas, gotta try a buffet! This one wasn't it though, lol.",

I don't know if they do that all days, but we got our money worth. It was $37. The variety of food was good. For the brunch, there were breakfast and lunch items. Some items may have sat there for awhile by the time we got to them. So they were slightly old. But, again the variety was good, with sushi, Italian, Mexican, American and probably some other dishes too. Decent dessert variety too. We were happy to tip our waitress Alicia, she kept our glasses full and table clean. We will be happy to return. The all you can drink was great, but to get a five star from me, I would have to be wowed all around.",

Considering the seafood and meat section, that wasn't a bad price. We spent more for less at other buffets. I like the made to order pasta and the Asian food section! Desserts were delicious and I wished I could've eaten more. Everything was pretty fresh, including the gnocchi with mushrooms. There's more than 1 kind of cheese which I truly appreciate! Sometimes you just gotta have Gouda man!  No bathrooms inside - you have to exit to the left for that.  The drink section is great - lots of teas and the freestyle machine. All you can drink beer and wine is awesome too! As far as staff and employees go, most were friendly except the cashier at the front. She kept giving us \"the look\" and I'm not even sure why. She took her sweet time and I felt like saying something but didn't. I was just a tad bit too hungry.   Must try at least once - I think you'll like it.",

The best part is if you are a military veteran or active duty, make sure you sign up for the rewards card, first you get free parking at the mirage garage, and best of all you also receive 40% off your buffet price for up to a total of 4 guests.

Visited for lunch, massive dining room with seating for 750+! The restaurant was packed and they have about 6 stations and a dessert area. All the food was typical American buffet but they also had various food stations: Italian: (pizza) and pasta, Latin: taco area, burrito and nachos and Asian: eggs rolls, noodles, lemon chicken, asian veggies and fried rice! My favourite station was the bbq: they had fresh prime rib, turkey and sausage. The prime rib was great and served with some of the hottest horseradish as well - which I loved!!! You can also put various gravies on your meat option and of course they have grilled carrots and mashed potatoes! I'd say the dessert was great, I opted for frozen yogurt and two freshly baked cookies that melted in your mouth. There are so many options I'm not sure what my favourite area was but I definitely recommend the prime rib and the asian selections. With your meal you get soft drinks and beer or white wine during your stay. Glad to say there are options which are less salted which I prefer over salty AF! Enjoy!!",

It wasn't packed and not busy. Fast & friendly service. I had some seafood fish items, crab claws & legs, prime rib, beef brisket, fish & chips, pork ribs, chow mein, potstickers, salmon nigiri, seaweed salad, broccolini, and desserts. The highlights were the prime rib, fish with spinach, crab claws, pork ribs and desserts. Do not get the cream brulee. The rest were ok and standard. The sushi selections are not so great. Need more Japanese food selections. Love how wine and beer is included in the buffet price. I had a glass of Chardonnay. The buffet price is not too expensive.

Food selection: 5/5. Lots of choices from American food, Latin, Asian, Salad, and desserts.  Quality of Food: 3/5. That's where it gets a little hit or miss. Food is very hot and has nice presentation! However, the sushi was disappointing. Rice was on the hard side and tasted store bought.  Pizza was okay but I could get similar pizza from Pizza Hut. Soups were great, meat from the carving was great (try the ham), and the salad bar selections were awesome. I also love how MGM properties all have self serve touch screen beverage machines! No more waiting for a server to refill your drinks. Lots of juice and coffee options too!  Pricing: 1/5. I feel really ripped off. My fiance and I went to the buffet around 11am today February 16th 2018. Normally the brunch price is around $24 per person but we were charged 75.75 for two brunch buffets (including tax). I think that's about 37 or 38 per person due to it being a holiday. I asked the person I was paying with what holiday it was today? She said she had no idea. Seems like the company just wants an excuse to charge people more money. Presidents' Day isn't until Monday. What the heck? At least educate your employees as to WHY we're paying so much more.   Also apparently unlimited alcoholic drinks were included as I was told by the host but the selection was poor. I opted for a mimosa and it tasted like straight up white wine with a splash of orange juice. Not really what I wanted/imagined as a mimosa. Stick to the Bellagio's unlimited drink option if you're interested in that.   Overall I would come back on a non holiday time as it was a really nice buffet. I just wish the food quality was a little bit better, but oh well!",

It's pretty typical institutional style buffet food. We had 2 for 1 coupons for both breakfast and dinner. Here are some things of note:  - if you don't like crab or steak forget dinner for the price - wine and beer are included even at breakfast  - they have those cool soda machines that let you make pretty much any kind of soda - they have sushi  - there are lots of gluten free options and they are all marked - salad bar is really teeny so if you are looking for salad, look somewhere else  - omelette bar at breakfast is the best option  So my thought is the only way this is good for the price is if you plan on drinking a lot of beer and wine or eating a lot of crab legs. Otherwise play the free MyVEGAS games on your smartphone and get enough points for 2 for 1 like we did.",

Then our plates stayed piled up for quite some time, almost our entire dinner.",

They are famous for their 11 international cooking stations, and 150+ self serving soft drinks. The stations includes carvings (prime rib); seafood (crab legs, seafood stew); chef station(fresh cooked pasta); Chinese; Japanese; Mexican; salad bar; cheese bar; dessert. The other 2, American and Latin, were closed today!!!! Each station includes roughly 5-10 dishes, not a lot of selection. Food was sub par, poor quality and slow turnover rate. The prime rib was pretty great, snow crab legs were not bad. Apart from that everything else was quite low quality. Dessert section wasn't fancy, but the bread pudding, creme brulee, oatmeal raisin cookies were all pretty good.   If you go to Tix4Tonight, you can buy a $2 discount ticket and get 30% off per person($$20.99). That was around $25 for dinner including tax.  Pricing (includes wine) Breakfast : $15.99  Brunch : $20.99  Dinner : $30.99  Weekend Champagne brunch : $25.99",

There is a wide variety of the foods. You will be full before trying it all.  It does have the standards of sushi, crab legs, and shrimp. I did enjoy the cut prime rib.

But, this is a BUFFET! You are expected to serve yourself, including beverages. Our server took away the dirty dishes & brought me a crab leg cracker. That was it. I'm sure she works hard but I resent being mandated on how much to tip. So our group of 10 split into two separate tables, in two different servers' areas, to avoid the required tip. Of course, we left a tip anyway.  That irritation aside, the buffet was quite good. Offering everything from sushi to stir fry to tacos, the buffet meal also includes draft beer & house wines (again, self-serve). For about $30, this is a great value in Vegas! The Dungeness Crab Legs were my favorite, but I also loved the tender medium-rare Prime Rib. The Macaroni & Cheese was so cheesy & creamy, and the Mashed Potatoes were outstanding. My friends raved about the Turkey and BBQ Ribs as well. Everything I tried was delicious and definitely exceeded my *buffet expectations*.",

From a breakfast chef to a carving chef, there's so many items to choice from. They have a self serve beverage area from hot teas, coffee, hot chocolate to cappuccino machines, you can't go wrong. There's a juice machine as well as a full service bar. If you can think it for a drink they have it. You will leave this buffet very satisfied! I would suggest the best time to eat would be before 10am, because after that it gets crowded. Overall this is an excellent place for groups or just two people. The wait staff and servers are friendly. If you have an Triple A card or serve in the military you get a big discount, you have to let them know because some of the cashiers won't say anything. We saved $12 for being a Triple A member.",

You could eat breakfast here for a month straight and you would literally never have to eat the same thing.  Think of a of hot and cold breakfast items and this breakfast buffet probably has it... the waitress was a huge help because the place is huge and she took the 5 mins to explain where everything is and the items that she liked.  Along with custom omelets made to order they also had a variety of premade breakfast items as well as a few brunch and lunch items... Even if I don't stay at the Mirage the next time I come to Vegas I will still come here for breakfast and will probably try out their dinner buffet to see if it can match its breakfast...",

Prime rib was juicy and cooked right. Not fall apart texture, which for a roast it should be, but close. Wine and beer included in fee.  Cons: bathrooms. None! They are outside in the casino. Kid almost peed her pants before we got there. Mind you, the walk is short for an adult. Potatoes had ZERO flavor. That's hard to do. Even just a little salt is ok. Mac n cheese was old and cold. Potatoes wedges were burnt. Steamed rice was old and crunchy. I waited for 10 minutes for someone at the Asian station to replace it, but it was like a ghost town.   All in all, it's not awful food. But $40 per person is loony toons for what you get. If you aren't eating steak, lobster, or crab, save your pennies.",

    "text": "I visited Cravings Buffet for lunch yesterday. Save your money, don't go!! There are so many other buffets out there. I came here because I thought it would have a good variety but it didn't deliver. I haven't been to a Las Vegas buffet in a couple of years so I was looking forward to pigging out. I was extremely disappointed with the food selection and quality. I would have given it no stars but that is not an option for Yelp. The sushi was probably premade and refrigerated since the rice was hard and didn't seem freshly made --just like the store-bought kind. I only sampled food that looked appealing but most of it wasn't. Looks can be deceiving, the decent looking food wasn't very good at all either. The only item that I enjoyed was the prime rib. I had two servings since there wasn't really anything else that was any good. I could have saved money if I just went to a restaurant where I just ordered prime rib. There were fish and chips and the batter was thick without much crunch. The fries were ok but like the other food just didn't seem freshly made.   I have a sweet tooth so I saved my stomach for dessert since there wasn't really much else to eat but the dessert left me unsatisfied as well. Cookies were overbaked; they were hard and dried out. Oatmeal and chocolate cookies are supposed to be soft and chewy but not theirs. Just wasted calories eating their desserts. The cake was dry and stale. The fruit tart didn't have much flavor and wasn't crisp. I guess it was day old dessert or something. The dessert items were so bad that I never even finished any of them. The desserts look good but they are not even worth trying.  I think the only thing going for the buffet is the free beer, wine, champagne, and mimosas when I was there. Maybe that might be the reason some people rate the buffet higher than it deserves. I didn't partake in the alcoholic beverages because I was driving home that afternoon but I would prefer good food over free alcohol.  Stay away from Cravings Buffet at the MIrage or you will regret it. It was Mother's day weekend so I ended paying a premium for that crap they called food. I really don't know how such a major hotel casino can serve food like that.",

(I wouldn't know about the seafood personally, but a lot of the people in my group kept going back to that station) - some of the things in the Italian section were selectively better than others (i.e. pasta)  CUSTOMER SERVICE: - the register people aren't pleasant - the seating attendants are VERY welcoming - the bartender worked fairly slow and had a hard time remembering our 2 drinks we ordered",

Liked it so much I went back and got two more.   The drinks are self serve. You're a grown adult, don't complain if they don't bring you your dink. Also, the dessert section was....I don't even know where I was gonna start.   Vegas literally means buffets in my books!",

    "text": "It's a nice buffet, the food is decent, especially for the price, and you get unlimited beer wine and or mimosas included. But there needs to be more vegan options! I came here for dinner and for breakfast and was able to find vegetables, sushi, fruit, rice and salad for dinner. But not everything is labeled, they really need to work on their labeling! For example they had an okra and tomato soup and I asked if there was meat- sure enough the base was chicken stock. But it should have been labeled as not vegetarian. Then they have some labels like the grapefruit -\"gluten free\" really??? The grapefruit you'll label? For breakfast, I had fruit, toast, hash browns. They don't have soy milk. And it's really hard to ask what is in each item because there aren't always workers behind the line. It's decent food for the price especially with included alcohol but they should label more, and have at least one featured vegan dish for each meal.",

The seafood station had crab legs that should have been thrown back for being too small. Salad bar was small as was the dessert bar. Main Street Station downtown has a much better buffet at 1/2 the price.  Here's a tip if you are with your family with kids dont waste your money. This place will give your kids a reason to question your decision making process.",

The sushi tasted like it came from Vons (Costco sushi is better). Panda Express does better at their beef broccoli. The pizza looks like it is cooked in a fancy way, but they must have skimped on the ingredients because it does not taste anything special. They did not have seafood crackers for the crab claws. I had to go to the bar to get mimosa refills because the waiting staff was very slow at refills.  I was also a little disappointed that there was no Creme brulee at the dessert station; however, I must say I did love their chocolate bread pudding.   Overall the food and service was just OK. Next time I am in Vegas, I will try a different buffet.",

We were in line for maybe 30 minutes?    The food was good, they have everything just like the buffet at the Wynn (maybe just not as much choices) but enough for a buffet.  The best part was all you can drink MIMOSAS! =) oh, and i'm glad i was able to save room for some gellato ice cream... my bf and I tried the watermelon and white chocolate macadamia gellato ice cream.  They were both good but the watermelon one was really good! my friends were full but i told them to try our watermelon ice cream, once they tried it, they got up and got their own =)  I recommend to go here if you're on a budget, we only paid $28 compare to $40 plus for dinner at the Wynn..",

I am not even bothered with the generally mediocrity of food on buffets.  That said, I found Cravings to be a disappointment. It has about 10 different ethnic stations with each station having a handful of food options.    In general, the food offered was even blander than I find at my local Golden Coral.  I also felt like the number of dish options was less than you usually see at a Vegas buffet.  The price is similar to the Wynn  Buffet, but not nearly as good.    Some of the highlights- Had a good Latin station with a bunch of different salsas.  Also enjoyed the Chinese pork buns with many different sauces.  The highlight of the meal was the Gelato bar.  I enjoyed 5 different flavors dipped in 6 different sauces.  YUM!  Overall- definitely don't come here if you don't generally like buffets. It will live-up to all of your negative opinions of buffets.  If you love buffets, there are so many in Vegas, why come to this mediocre one.",

It was a Sunday morning so they were serving mimosas with your meal.  Not a bad start..  As we navigated our way through the buffet if found a decent cooked prime rib..  Next was the pho noodle soup..  Legit! Then I found the cold seafood..  Disappointed..  The crab legs had that fishy smell to it as it was not fresh.  I didn't want to ruin our anniversary trip by spending my time on the porcelain throne  so I took one bite and passed.  The desserts were decent but I have had better else where. Considering that our meal was complementary I would say that it was not bad.  We were full until dinner time.   I think it was appropriately 56 bucks if our meals were not on Expedia.  Other than that I would not pay for it.  If your going with the free Expedia meal just a note..  This place had better yelp reviews then the other 5 or 6 places that you have to choose from on the complementary buffet list.  Hope this helped you..  Enjoy yourself in Vegas and don't forget to tip your dealers.  =)",

The buffet is divided into stations. Crab legs seem to be the big seller here but other than that, the fish section was weak. The sushi looked dry.  Overall the buffet was boring and lame. Not a great selection and while nothing I had tasted bad, it wasn't great either.  Beer and wine was unlimited, but they were serving only one type of beer. It was a decent meal on the cheap, but not somewhere I would go again.  If you can afford it, go to Caesar's or Wynn.",

    "text": "So I made it for dinner before the dinner crowd arrived, which meant there weren't much of a wait at all. Drinks at this buffet are all self-serve, except beer and wine, which you have to request from the bartender who pours it for you. They have the cool soft drink dispensers with the electronic screen which is neat because it offers a wide selection! I only made my way to the alcohol though. It may be cheap wine, but I didn't care since it was included with the price. As far as the food goes, it was definitely a flop. Selection was also very limited. I had a hard time finding things I actually wanted to try. All of their poultry offerings including the roast turkey, cajun chicken, fried chicken etc were beyond dry. I had to save it with cranberry sauce, gravy, or simply eat it with the mac and cheese. Their mac and cheese was one of the few selections which were very good. Crabs legs were extremely salty. I got three pieces and could barely finish them.  The pasta dishes were overcooked but it's to be expected at a buffet. Pasta is usually good fresgly prepared and eaten right away. The cheese ravioli I had here was ok.  The asian station had bao filled with shrimp which was weird. They had a weird stir-fry, chow mein noodles and the rest were empty. The sushi were the typical grocery store selections of cali rolls and other rolls with imitation crab or cream cheese. The tamales from the mexican section had no flavor. It was simply salty. Costco sells a pack of tamales that are so much better. How sad is that? I was at the buffet with a friend who was enjoying his shrimp and crablegs and that was basically all he really wanted.  I quickly got bored with dry meat and limited selection. The deserts werent even good. I simply sat and waited while filling up on endless wine. It may be cheap wine but hey, it's included with this buffet and that deserves two stars. I ended up having dinner elsewhere at a sit-down restaurant a couple hours later, as the buffet was really gross.",

    "text": "I went here a couple days ago as a place to eat after a whole night of drinking and wooziness.  Only 18 dollars for brunch without drinks.  22 with unlimited alcohol--cheaper than bellagio without unlimited alcohol!  Yay.  I took off two stars because I felt that they tried hard in some areas and just didn't think about the others.  The Asian noodle spot was pretty awesome.  They had Vietnamese beef pho they made right in front of you and it wasn't bad (I'm viet and had my share of good/bad pho).  It made me feel all warm and fuzzy.  They also made wonton soup!  At the same spot, they had different kinds of dimsum.  Shrimp balls (awesome) and shumai (not so awesome).  Next to the noodle bar was chicken congee (asian rice soup).  I thought they executed the Asian food quite well!    On to the other areas.  The seafood spot was okay.  The crab legs were extremely salty for some reason :(   so I didn't eat many of them.  The dessert spot was WEAK.  There wasn't much compared to the Bellagio buffet which has a bajillion pastries.  It was like I was staring at a meager dessert spread at a chinese buffet.  The italian spot only had pizza and the sushi area was okay.    I believe the key to having a good buffet is people standing there making delicious foods as you walk by like a sushi guru handing you a freshly made spicy tuny roll or a baker stuffing cannolis.  The Mirage buffet lacked such presence (minus the noodle bar).    But hey!  For the price, the noodle bar, and other various selections, I think it was worth it but I will probably try a different buffet when I'm in Vegas again~~",

The international buffet satisfied both my partner and myself, we have v different tastes. I loved the Asian and seafood section, the seafood salad and chowder were amazing, and I loved the Japanese sesame seaweed salad. Pete was kept happy with the free IPA and wine. I'm not usually a dessert person, but the small very tasty portions made sampling a delight! Will definitely go back.",

It was probably because they had just transitioned from lunch into dinner... Anyway, I was excited. Everything is spaced out very nicely and the food was neatly presented.   The staff were really nice.. especially for having to deal with 4 drunk girls. The lady who was seating us even asked if one of our girls was going to be okay considering she could barely comprehend what was going on.. haha  However, the food is not all that great. I would've rather gone to the Bellagio. I think that the only thing I really liked was the pizza.. but then again, I was pretty drunk. The crab legs were mediocre. Not bad.. just not something I'd want to spend my money on. The prime rib was disgusting - poorly seasoned and dry. I tried a little bit of everything and it all tasted bland... As for the dessert, I didn't even get to that.. Kind of turned off by it so I had fruit instead.",

Brunch where there's an older Asian lady who can be my momma making pho and wonton noodle soup? HOLLER!  Although I did not eat $23.95 worth of food, it was a great experience.

They brought out the amazing snow crabs and roast beef.   The soups are limited but are pretty good. Can't ask for a better deal with this quality of food.  The only down side is the limited selection of food for each ethnic section.   Of course, this deal included unlimited self serve drinks with unlimited selected 2 choices of beer and 5 wine selections.",

I also like the selection that there still is there but I feel like everything quality wise is slowly going down as well.  I like the chinese food station cause they have one of my favorites, won ton noodle soup.  You just have to ask the sully looking dude standing behind the station to make it.  The gelato is also good too, however you need to flag down someone to serve it to you.",

At $14.95 it's pretty much the same price as a couple of coffees and pastries at one of the coffee shops. Getting there was just a question of taking the tram over.  Attractive entrance and lettering going into the restaurant with not much of a queue.   Before anything else, I must mention that the service was excellent. Really go out of your way stuff. When they asked which juice, I asked for pineapple which they got from the room service section. Twice.  Enough to make me double my usual tip to the servers to a massive $2.  ( enough people come to the buffet leaving nothing making me look like one of the last BSD's.)  The food itself is fair with special mention being made of the positive: excellent croissants, omelette station and proper pork sausages.   Negative is having to ask for yoghurt to be served, the croissants being in a refrigerated section ( which they will heat up on asking) and a slightly weird eggs Benedict. Bacon was so so and coffee was okay, but plentiful. Also no real obvious toast.  No real wow factor compared to the outstanding Wynn or bellagio but they are more expensive with longer queues and further to get to. So if you want a fair feed, it'll do.",

The salad bar lacked topping selections, but was fresh.  They did have a nice cheese and meat section with some cubed cheese and sliced salami.  They desserts were somewhat creative, but some were tasteless.  I guess if you drank the unlimited beer and wine makes up for the cold and poor quality of food.",

We started with the sushi station and quickly found out it was absolutely inedible. So gross, dry and hard. We moved on to the prime rib but they had no rare pieces, so that was a no go as well. The crab legs were ok, and we ended up just filling up on the Mexican station which was decent. Things got a little better towards the end at the dessert station. The Mirage bread pudding is to die for and coffee was good too.  I would not recommend this to a friend because if I wanted to fill up on Mexican, I could spend WAY less than $60.",

It's in a brighter, more modern-trendy atmosphere. I do not typically seek out buffets but I would eat here again if staying at the Mirage.",

I don't think we picked up anything we didn't like. The prime rib was my must have! Though the ends are a bit dry for my palette, I prefer the middle section where the meat is rare/medium rare. Once they've gotten to that spot, its on like Donkey Kong. I freaking love this buffet.   The mimosas are out of this world by the way. They have unlimited beer and wine during the weekday but its a mimosa you want, just go pick up some wine and stop by the drink section, you can make mimosas all day or pretty much anything else you can imagine. I personally liked moscato mixed with cranberry.",

Normally it is $40/person, and after eating here I have to say it's probably not worth $40/person.  The food is mediocre. It reminds me of a slightly sophisticated Golden Corral except I think Golden Corral is better value. The Asian food was a bit dry and tasted really Americanized.  My sisters really liked the crab legs. I like how there was a vat of butter just waiting for you.  The desserts were okay. The fruit was sweet. They had mini fruit tarts which I appreciated because I absolutely adore fruit tarts.",

The unlimited alcohol was a big plus, they had a pretty good Chardonnay and Cabernet, this was definitely surprising as it was free alcohol, the wine alone makes the price reasonable if you like to drink wine as I do. I would definitely recommend this place for a good buffet, but not a great one",

Our server, I forgot his name, was awesome! He was friendly and helpful, but the station cooks were kinda cranky. Totally not the vibe I want on my vacation!   I'm giving it three stars only because Cravings offers all you can drink beer and house wine. So if you drink for a couple hours, it's definitely worth it.",

The variety was great, but the only thing I truly liked was the prime rib and the turkey. I've had better prime rib in a few places in Vegas. So much of the foods were soggy, or just tasted bad. Ribs and chicken were dry. I loved being able to re-fill my own drinks (all buffet servers are bad at refills in my experience), and the desserts were REALLY awful. Their froyo was good, though.

    "text": "Used a 2 for 1 buffet reward from the My Vegas app/game. Two people for breakfast on a week day ended up being $14.03, which is a great deal! After I redeemed the reward on the app I had to visit the Mlife players club to activate it on my card. They suggest that you redeem whatever reward you're going to use the day of, since you only have 24 hours to use it (or you lose it). Redeeming my reward at the buffet was easy, just let the cashier know you're using one and they take care of the rest.   The buffet is located at the back of the casino floor, close to Stack. The dining room is huge, and it was packed at 9am. Scored a booth on the side at the end, so we had lots of room. The food choices are expansive! Almost every station was open for breakfast, even the pizza area! They were making omelets and breakfast pizzas, yum! They offered every type of breakfast pastry you could ever want, along with every type of breakfast meat you could ever want. Tons of choices, but if you're vegetarian you might have a harder time filling up. I don't eat pork, so my meat options were pretty slim, but I had more than enough on my plate to make up for it.   They have a bar set up in the back - it was open for breakfast but I don't know if the drinks are extra. The buffet areas are a little spread out, but you need to do a little extra walking after eating here lol. I have recommended this buffet to everyone I know visiting Vegas in the near future, it was great! And getting a big discount doesn't hurt, so sign up for the MyVegas game if you want 2 for 1!",

The hostess refused to give us a military discount even though I am a veteran and had a military id to show that I did serve in the air force. Then it was $72 for the two of us. So I'm thinking with that outrageous price, the food would be amazing... NO! Pretty much everything was cold and disgusting, with the exception of the turkey we got from the carving station. (Kudos to those guys because they made amazing turkey). Overall it was an overpriced and horrible experience. I wouldn't recommend anyone ever going there.",

The ambience is good although not as \"luxurious\" or upscale as the bellagio. However that seems to be the only thing the bellagio has on the Mirage buffet. 1. Food selection is better. 2. The food quality is better. 3. Dessert has a wider selection and tastes better overall. 4. The price is better, especially if you buy the discount coupon for $2   at Tix4Tonight which drops the price from $24 to $18 per person, a much better deal than the Bellagio buffet. Finally, servers are also very gregarious, more so than most places. I think you'll like it.",

How can you go wrong with french toast and berries, eggs, chilaquiles, yogurts, etc!    Mini tiramisu was very tasty! Among the best choices from dessert bar.  Service was very good and attentive.

Honestly, I don't know why everyone pees all over themselves when talking about the Bellagio buffet. If you don't consider the champagne included with brunch, it's not that fabulous.  I ate too much food, I don't remember everything that I ate. The sushi wasn't inviting (but sushi at a Las Vegas buffet is usually something to be avoided anyway). The prime rib was tasty (and also the first thing I went for). The most notable thing though, was the vanilla gelato. I nearly died at first bite. They must have put a gallon of egg yolks in it, because it was DELICIOUS. I have never had vanilla gelato quite like that, and I will likely never have it anywhere else. I would seriously pay the $16 or so just to have unlimited vanilla gelato. I am quite sad I didn't know the gelato was there to begin with, otherwise I would have just eaten that for all of lunch.",

Arrangement of food was organized to aesthetically pleasing visual as well, making the majority of the food items appear quite appetizing, except for a few beat up egg benedicts.  Unfortunalty looks can be deceiving, which apparently it was for the most case with most of the breakfast Items I tried.  I made my first and last round starting at the omelet station. The guy behind the counter took some time to make the omelet, did it a little carelessly however; it ended up being the only decent tasting item I tried.  Most of the sausage links and patties I tried tasted as if it was picked from the bottom of the barrel. I tried some cheesy potatoes like casserole thing that looked better than it tasted.  The dessert items did not look appealing enough to try though,I had a bowl of some oatmeal, fruity dish with milk that was semi sweet and extremely tasty.

Looked more impressive than it was.  it's kind of a trip around the culinary world.  they have whatever you might want - mexican, asian, italian, etc.   problem is, the food was meh.  Much of it was cold/soggy.    Service was good, but not a place I would visit again.",

I've seen better at an Indian casino buffet.  The food was not hot.  By the time I sat down to eat, my food was pretty much cold.  Not many choices of sushi rolls and they appeared to be mislabeled.  I was really disappointed with dessert choices.  One nice thing is that beer and wine are included.  People seemed to really enjoy that since we saw several tables piled high with empty wine glasses.  Be aware that if you are a large party (i think 8 or more) they automatically tack on an 18% gratuity.  That would annoy me since you serve yourself both food and drinks.  The employees only cleared tables.",

While the Mirage's buffet cannot compare to the Wynn in terms of the setting or size, I was extremely impressed with it for the price point and in relation to the wait.  We went for Sunday brunch, which included all-you-can-drink mimosas for $25. There was no line to get in, although there were enough people there that the food stayed fresh. I loved the Asian flair. They had four types of Asian soup at brunch (pho, congee, won ton mein, and some sort of miso noodle soup), each with the appropriate toppings available. They also had cracked crab legs (some of the Vegas buffets only serve crab at dinner), shrimp cocktail, and prime rib.    We were staying at the Mirage, and I would absolutely go back if we were to stay there again. Enjoy!",

The all you can drink beer and wine was good though, it felt like an open bsr except our choices were limited down to 2 type of beers and 3 different wines. I would say though their dessert section was sweet. I wide selection of desserts such as cakes, pies, pastries and gelato. The dessert section itself got me excited. The price was around 37 a person, which was cheaper than the other buffet prices I have seen ($50+).",

The buffet prices is a little over $30 but for all five of us we were able to get them for under $100.   There was a large selection but I am sure it is not the best Vegas has to offer. They have Asian cuisine, a not very impressive sushi bar, Italian, carvery, barbecue, ETC. I had the prime rib which was really good and tender. Beyond that my other favorites were the huge split crab legs and giant shrimp cocktail! I enjoyed everything I ate here and would recommend it! This was a good first meal in Las Vegas but I will definately be checking out different buffets because there are so many others!",

I was there for a Sunday dinner for around $30 includes tips with the discount voucher from tix4tonight! As always, the staffs r very attentive and nice like most of the buffets on the strips. The plus side of the Cravings buffet is the unlimited beers and champagnes included. The quality of the booze r quite excellent  and refreshing! I seen people going to the bar more than the food. Not that the food is bad! It is just not very appetizing! The only food section which stands out are the deli meat section, the crab legs, the BBQ and the Mongolian stir fry area which you choose your own meat and veggies. The self-serve soda machine was a plus. It is quite the technical marvel! Each soda machine has at least 200 soda pop flavors to choose from! The kiddies will have a blast with it!  Overall the experience was mediocre! But the cheap deal and the excellent quality of the booze do make up for it if you are a drinker and on a budget. I hope Cravings buffet management better improve its quality. I just hate to see such a great establishment go belly up like so many of the other buffets on the strip!",

So I visited Cravings and they were so nice and accommodating. ..and they honored a AAA 20% discount which they brought up. The managers and hostess were so nice. The food was delicious And it included unlimited beer and wine. They saved me over $400 over the buffet at Ceasars.

Only went downhill from there with the Asian station. The pad Thai didn't taste like pad Thai. The sushi was bland.  Wish mirage would put more effort in creating tasty dishes.

Soft drink stations has, what, a hundred choices perhaps (vanilla Mr. Pibb!), but as with any buffet go light on the drinks (even the beer wine) and you'll enjoy more food.",

Though as far as the food is concerned, the prime rib was pretty good. We ordered a lobster (in addition to the meal) which was a nice touch but not the best I've ever had. There were stations including Italian food, Meat carving (Turkey, Prime Rib and Pork Loin), Mexican (my boyfriend highly suggests the fried plantains with chimichurri sauce), Southern Cooking (with pretty good ribs), a seafood section with shrimp and crab legs, a disappointing sushi section and an Americanized Chinese section, a cold cut, bread roll and cheese section and lastly a dessert section. Alcoholic drinks are not complimentary (some buffets do have wine and beer inluded)....   My opinion is that when you go to a buffet you pay for a variety of mediocre food.. so it's quantity and variety over quality.  Personally, I think in the future I'd rather save my money to go to a restaurant and have one meal of higher quality.",

Wide variety of foods here, but fast forward to 2008 and beyond, where the Cravings Buffet has expanded and vastly improved. There is quite an international feel to the buffet, ranging from Americano to Mexicano to Asian (Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese). Lots of cut meats to choose from and plenty of soups to try! Desserts included cakes, tarts, bread pudding, and a gelato bar! Drinks are free, so drink up if you're into fruit juices: orange, cranberry, apple, etc. Service was great too, as they servers regularly cleaned our tables and refilled our drinks. The food is arrayed around the the dining area in a wide circular arc, making you walk a bit to find your favorite foods (a little exercise within the buffet compound). Not a bad buffet in Las Vegas. Not the best, but hey, it's not Bellagio!",

(More for bottomless mimosas or bloody marys).   Even better, although there are tons of ridiculously good foods for you to load up on (ex. king crab, shrimp cocktails, prime rib), they still have noodle soup, congee, fruit and tea, my standard and required hangover foods. Also, a very nicely stocked section of your standard breakfast items (I saw Jennifer S. wandering around on the first round with an empty plate filled only with bacon!!) Niiiice!  If you are planning a Vegas trip for a big group of people I would strongly advise that you stop by here for brunch. Happy campers = separate checks + unlimited variety. Priceless!!",

We came at 5pm and the food selection was temperature cold and we are not talking about the raw bar but the cooked heated food sections.  The only thing at the raw bar are crab legs.  The prime rib was not flavorful---lacked a distinct beef taste even with the Au Jus--remember to include the au jus...you'll need it since it is soooo dry and bland. The roast turkey was also bland and uneventful...thankfully they have turkey gravy a few feet away.   The Chinese and Japanese sections were terrible....the singapore rice noodles were overly seasoned with soy sauce which destroyed the curry flavor. the fried rice and steamed rice were colder than ice cream. the fried rice was overly seasoned with soy sauce.  the roast pork and duck were lifeless and bland...i've had better in Hong Kong....so don't expect much in this section.  the italian and latin foods were also bland, salty and cold.   TIP: if you want hot food, eat whatever you pick right then and there since by the time you get to your table, the food will be cooooooooooooold.   the only lifesaver was the service from our waiter...he was great and made the experience better....  the food is TERRRRRRRRRIBLE --- COLD, BLAND, SALTY and VARIETY CHALLENGED....SAVE your $ and avoid even the early bird special and go to the Wynn.",

It's very tasty.  The only thing I was a little annoyed was the services.  Some time, it's hard to get a server to get a refill.",

    "text": "Came here for CHRISTMAS DINNER! Mainly because the wait at Wynn was approximately 3.5 hours. THREE AND A HALF HOURS, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  The wait to get in here at Cravings was only about 15 minutes and totally worth it! Just try and get there before the dinner rush starts. We were in line by 6pm.  This place had a TON of food. Great variety. Prime Rib was delicious, nicely cooked, seasoned & the au jus was perfect. Questioned whether the mashed potatoes were authentic or of the instant variety, but it was so tasty, I stopped wondering & just enjoyed myself. The personal salad bar was great. Got just the right amount with everything I wanted and nothing I didn't. The guy tossed it for you and everything. Very nice. The sushi was sub-par but I guess that's to be expected. I tried every roll but just by the look of it, you could tell it was whatevers. The Chinese food they had was really good too, just the basics. & Tasty sweet & sour soup! They even had Pho! My parents had it and said it was lacking one thing - MSG. Of course. The seafood was really good! King crab legs, sweet succulent shrimp & the best breaded shrimp ever! Sweet & well-seasoned perfection.  They had Mexican food as well as Mediterranean food. I saw hummus, pasta, bbq, etc etc. Really something for EVERYONE. Great variety!   The dessert bar wasn't anything too special. Meringues, cake, fruit tarts, macaroons that we all swooned over. But the best part? GELATO! A nice man behind the ice cream bar who would scoop you whatever you please. Coconut, coffee, strawberry, vanilla... only thing missing was green tea. That would have cleansed the palette nicely. Oh well!  Overall, a great value. Our Christmas dinner buffet was $34.95/adult. I think it was totally worth it considering the variety, the freshness & flavor and the fact that we didn't have to wait over 3 hours, like at Wynn. I'd recommend it!",
