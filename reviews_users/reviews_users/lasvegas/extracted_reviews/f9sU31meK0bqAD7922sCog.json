    "text": "Sorry to say that the flavor balance was way off on most of my dishes. I had the fresh oyster and it came drenched in heavy vinegar sauce that masked any taste of the oysters. What's the point of eating oysters if can't taste the freshness and the brininess of it??!! I had the scallops for main and again the floor balance was off where the sauce was way too sweet. The overpowering sauces are not the reasons why I pay ~$100 per person. You should let the ingredients speak for itself. Lastly, had the panacotta dessert and I thought it was too dry.",

I was able to sample from all the plates that our party of 4 ordered.  Highlights:  Appetizers: Sweetbreads. Trust me on this one even if you're not a sweetbread fan. They serve them roasted with mushrooms, pork belly, greens, and a creamy polenta sauce that is absolutely delicious. I've had sweetbreads in lots of places. These were amazing.  Dinner: New York Strip. The steak was cooked perfectly and the sweet onion puree that it was served on was perfect.  Dessert: I was too full to order, but I did try the apple fritters a girl at our table ordered. Once again...spectacular.  Drinks: If you are a fan of Belgian beers, Sage has a great selection. I wish I could remember the Belgian they had on tap that came at the recommendation of our bad-ass waiter, but it escapes me.  Eat here.",

(The oysters with tequila were amazing -- I wasn't an oyster fan until I tasted these . . . and I'm still not _except for_ these!)  The staff is warm and friendly.  The decor is very pretty, with high ceilings and lots of black, grey, and tan.  It's Las Vegas so \"business casual\" works, but you could easily be dressier here.",

They have way too many busboys that are of no help if you can't find waiters to actually take your order. Ordered meat that was way over cooked, even the egg on the tartar was overly done. The food in genera tasted like it has been cooked days ago and reheated on a microwave to serve. Even desert is bad. Fine dining prices with very poor food quality. Save yourself some money and get better food even at the buffet!",

    "text": "I had my first dining expereince at Sage recently. I will say this much, it's a tasty restaurant. The service was spectacular, especially from Richard, who for some reason is not a main server. The beer choices were fantastic. They had an array of trappist beers, ales, a few IPA's, etc.  The ambiance of the restaurant is great. They have an a great combination of dark and light vibrant colors. The color combination is purple and gold with different accents. I especially liked the old school, speakeasy feel to the restaurant. It was very dark inside the restaurant, but the lamps are a nice touch.   The waiters started us out with a couple of different bread choices, a french bread and a cheddar bacon bread. The CBB was amazzzzzinnnngggg! I had to ask for another piece. They provided a a nice herbed butter with Australian pink salt to add to our bread.   We decided to try out the Sweetbread as an appitizer. We had no idea what it was when we first ordered it. When it came, it looked appetizing in a small dish. I will tell you this, it was one of the best appetizers I have ever had. The only thing I that took me back for a moment was what a sweetbread is. Google it if you don't know. Honestly, I loved it.   The next thing I ordered was the 36 hour Wagyu short rib. This was a great decision. It was so moist and tender. It was served over a bed of white asparagus, turnips, and a crispy type potato. It was my favorite out of what we had (three people together, we tried each others dishes).   My friend ordered the rabbit, which came out on a bed of spinach and fresh peas. It was tasty and was the first time I tried rabbit. I still preferred a red meat.   My other friend got the Kobe skirt steak, which was great. It was tender, but there was a bite where it was a little tough. My friends were still pretty envious of the choice I had made for dinner.  We decided to skip desert, because we're more beer drinkers than desert people. If they had some sort of beer desert, we may have tried it. The restaurant, however, gave us a desert type drink. It was a blueberry flavored almond milk that was delectable.   I was fortunate enough to have a complimentary amount of money applied to this meal, because of my job. The pricing was way too rich for my blood. Each of our main courses were between $45 and $59 dollars, which is what I usually wouldn't spend on a meal. Add in appetizers and beers and you have yourself a pretty sizable check, but, I guess for some, really wasn't that bad for three people ($256 plus tip) This is the only reason I gave the experience four stars.",

    "text": "Nooooo.... Last week this place had a 4.5* rating and that's why I chose it. But now it's 4*, just like every other restaurant.   I tried to push for the $49 early menu but I was told to stop planning like a grandma and to \"live on the edge.\"  So I translated that to mean, schedule a 9:30 dinner?  We got to Aria by 9 and had a few drinks at the various bars. Unfortunately, those drinks distorted my expensive dining experience a bit. We re-checked in at 9:30 for our reservation and they still weren't ready for us. We almost fainted from hunger in the restaurant's bar area.  Luckily, when we were seated, we expressed our frustrations to our server and he made sure our food came our at lightning speeds.  We went with the $79 signature menu. I chose: 1) Wagyu Tartare 2) Maine Dayboat Scallops 3) 48 Hour Beef Belly 4) Crunchy Chocolate and Peanut Butter Tart  He chose: 1) Foie Gras Brulee (OMG, only now as I'm writing this review have I realized that the foie was $10 extra. Not worth it, btw). 2) Glazed Pork Belly 3) Iberico Pork Loin 4) Peach Praline Profiteroles  The standouts were the Wagyu Tartare, Maine Dayboat Scallops and the Glazed Pork Belly.  Everything else was good but not mind blowing. Service was awesome and the free bread was super tasty.",

    "text": "Went on a Friday night - last minute reservation.  We were seated immediately and met by our waiter who was enthusiastic, friendly, witty and made us feel comfortable.  That is as good as the night got.  We ordered the Kushi oysters.  I have had them before and they are sweet and delicate.  For some reason there was way too much Siriacha sauce on them and completely overpowered the oyster.  We had to scrape off the hot sauce to salvage them.  Next up was the scallop ditch for my wife and I had the Snake River Farms NY Strip.  Both dishes were so salty that we couldn't finish the meals.  The medium rare steak was exceptionally poor quality with ribbons of silver ribbon that made the steak inedible as I couldn't cut through let alone chew the meat. The steak also was finished with salt and there was so much on the top that it was crunchy.  The waiter tried his best to rectify by bringing another portion of La Ratted Potatoes which were actually very good, but the bowl only has about 2 millimeters of potatoes and didn't save the day.  Unbelievable small portion size.  The waiter sold us that he was disappointed in the quality of the food as well and that he would call his manager.  We didn't ask for anything or want any food replaced, just wanted out.  The manager was not very empathetic and tried to comp a desert or something else which we politely declined.  He didn't have much else to say and went back to the bar to continue his conversation with two lady customers sitting there. What a manager.  They did take our cocktails off the final bill.  The waiter deserves 5 stars, but the chef actually 1 star for the potatoes.  Ambiance is nice, but would never recommend.",

That shall now be how I ask for my steak cooked  The Maine Dayboat Lobsters are magnificent. A unique blend of flavors that screams for you to slow down and enjoy the interplay of flavors on your palette. Almost like a bespoke surf and turf.  Australian Wagyu Sirloin with La Ratte Potato Puree & Confit Baby Raddish Was horrible! Well, it horribly ruined my ability to accept blase steak with traditional sauces. The sauce reminded me more of a braised/stew dish and was pleasantly tasteful and different from the norm.  Rhubarb Tart with Oatmeal Crisp, rhubarb ribbon and creme fraiche sorbet. The perfect dessert to top off a perfect meal. A delightful blend of sweet and tart flavors with an incredible texture mixture. There are almost too many flavors but right when you feel pushed to the edge, you take a moment to slow down and then everything comes together and you realize each element is in its perfect place.",

    "text": "There's three reasons why I chose Sage when I was humbly tasked with selecting a mid-level restaurant:  1.) Too lazy to walk far since we were booked up in ARIA 2.) Apparently it's decent, according to Yarp 3.) I used to have the word 'sage' contained in all my login passwords in high school  FIRST IMPRESSIONS: It was the weekend of the Mayweather v. Canelo fight, so pulling up to the podium and getting seated was simple and with haste. Obviously, it was fairly empty inside which was fine by me. Pleasing interior design, intimate lighting...really the only complaint I had was that the armchairs have uncomfortably placed armrests that made my pointy elbows appear even pointier; it's dark in there though, so I doubt anyone noticed. Oh, to the guys: please don't show up in sandals and shorts -- no need to dress all the way to the nines but bro, we ain't eating at Boston Market tonight, okay?  SERVICE: Among the best, albeit our server was a bit soft-spoken and just a touch aloof. I'd much rather have that than some pretentious wank that scoffs when you admit to having never tasted Southwestern porpoise blubber. He constantly checked up on our table without assuming control of the meal's pace and promptly provided refills and brought out the dishes in proper time. If I start to slow clap right now for the service provided that night, will someone out there please join me so I don't look like a loser? Yes? PLZZZ?  DRINKS: I was determined to get an old-fashioned and figured Sage was as good of a place to get a finely crafted cocktail as the next. The alkys will appreciate what I'm about to complain about but z'oh my gooseness...I might as well have just drank a quad shot straight, neat. No real bitters flavor and definitely lacking in the sugar cube/simple syrup. I'm pretty sure if you lit a match near my breath after downing the old-fashioned, my face would probably look like that Asian dude in the first Indiana Jones after opening the Ark of the Covenant. One of the others ordered a strawberry infused cocktail and it was the same deal...basically vodka with one sliced strawberry. Maybe I'm just a huge pussy.  DINNER PRE-GAME: Bread was just a couple notches below carb perfection. The sourdough was freshly fluffy and mildly...sour. Bacon bread is the clear dominant roll in the bread basket -- a must try. Amuse bouche was much needed after our drinks and prior to entrees arriving. Lightly-seared salmon with garlic flakes and lemon zest. Simple but effective and it went down nice and smooth.  ENTREES: American Kobe skirt steak cooked medium rare. Generous portions, excellent cuts and bang-on consistency...very delicious. Was it the best beef I've ever ingested? Nah, but it's probably worth a bit more than you pay for the dish. The crispy avocado = fried balled avocado. You cannot go wrong with frying anything, especially one of the best fruits ever. I enjoyed the salsa verde drizzling -- added a nice bit of flavor, spice and 'sauciness' without coming close to overtaking the flavor of the steak. One of the others got the scallops which were tasty, the other got the 36 hour wagyu which I unfortunately didn't get to try.  DESSERT/ROUND-UP: See, this is why you don't wait over a month to do a review. I completely forgot what we split for dessert, but it couldn't have been that great if I don't even remember if it was chocolate or fruit based. The waiter did bring us a couple of rounds of chocolate soup -- rich hot chocolate with freshly ground tarragon. Surprisingly tasty. Coffee was the perfect ending to the meal to counter the cocktails...fuuuuggg those were some hardxcore drinks. The java was good, but not exceptional in any way. Maybe I should have tried their espresso since brewed doesn't excite my inner caffeine freak like it used to.  Excellent experience and wouldn't mind trying again, but I have quite a few others to mark off my list before I can do seconds. A very capable restaurant, and to finish this review off:  5.) Finally de-BM Sage 6.) ??? 7.) Profit",

My folks were in Vegas and they like to go to fancy restaurants from time-to-time and Sage was on their radar. All I had to do was get ready and show up, which is how I like it :)  We arrived about 15 minutes before the reservation and decided to have a drink at the bar. Sparkling rose, please. I ended up guzzling down about 4 glasses of this stuff over the span of our meal. Can't get enough of the bubbly.   Our server was quite jovial. He even tolerated my Dad's cheesy jokes, which automatically promotes him to Sainthood. More good news? It was Restaurant Week, which means there were even more delicious dishes to choose from beyond the regular menu. I ended up splitting the ribeye + bone marrow + foie gras special. Not my *favorite*, by my favorite +1's eyes lit up when they rattled off some of his favorite foods together on one plate. How could I say no?  Food was excellent. Rich, decadent - everything one could expect from a meal of duck liver, red meat and the marrow. It even came with a side of creamy pureed potatoes.   Dessert? It was OK. Actually, I don't even remember what we ate. I was more into my glass of sparkling wine than anything else. And after two hours at the table, I was itching to go somewhere else.  Why 4 stars instead of 5? As much as I enjoyed the experience, it's not going on the \"Best Meals Evar\" list. There's absolutely nothing wrong with Sage, it's just not a restaurant that I would pick again. Perhaps I'm not classy enough or my palate is not as refined? My parents loved it, though, and that's all that really matters, since they were the ones picking up the check ;)",

    "text": "Unlike most people, I thought this was just ok and didn't blow my mind.  I got the tasting menu.    - Market oyster.  I think they said it was a kumamoto, but I'm not entirely sure.  It had piquilo pepper, Tabasco sorbet, and aged tequila Mignonette.  It tasted pretty good.  Excellent start for the night.  - Chilled main lobster with a pumpkin flan, smoked apple, and a pecan-brown butter vinaigrette.  The lobster was pretty good.  It was soft and sweet.  Coupled with the flan and smoked apple, it was pretty delicious for the cold appetizer.  - Fois gras brulee.  Way too salty and was borderline difficult to eat  - Pan roasted sea scallop with jamon iberico, chopped romesco, and a creamy cauliflower sauce.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and were very tender.  Coupled with the different ingredients, you basically tasted scallop with some sweet kick to it.  So far, this was my favorite even though it wasn't that memorable.  - Herb crusted lamb saddle with roasted sweetbreads, Thomcord grape, and Chanterelle mushroom.  The lamb was pretty good with the herb crust on top.  It was cooked rare, so the meat was soft and very tender.  - 48 hour beef belly with caraway spiced heirloom squash and roasted quince.  If you've ever had braised beef in some type of reduction sauce, this is basically it with one exception.  The beef belly was VERY heavy in fat and flavor.  What I mean by this is that it's literally like eating a spoonful of roasted bone marrow with some strands of meat in it.  The beef belly was very tender, but it was just extremely fatty and rich.  - Green apple mousse with peanut butter cream, celery leaf, and autumn spice.  The green apple mousse reminded me of almond tofu in some ways.  I didn't really taste the green apple flavor that much for some reason.  There were some marshmallows that have been singed to the plate.  The peanut butter cream was a decent complement to the mousse though, but I found the celery leaves added absolutely nothing to the taste other than making the plate look nice.  The peanut butter cream was very powerful and was similar to eating caramel just with peanut flavors.  The long stick is some type of candy that cracks like a hollowed thin candy cane.  This dessert was just ok.  Out of everything I've had, I'd have to say my favorites were probably the pan roasted sea scallop and the herb crusted lamb saddle.  The fois gras brulee and 48 hour beef belly was slightly too rich for me for a 6 course meal.  The chilled main lobster was just ok, and the green apple mousse dessert was also just ok.",

    "text": "WOW!! Do not miss eating at Sage - for any reason.  We have traveled extensively and eaten more extensively, and this was one of the top five meals ever. Because we had a show we opted for an early dinner and took advantage of the \"early\", 5pm-7pm menu for $49. You must ask for this - they will not offer it initially. This covered three courses, each with a few choices. Each and every dish was sublime, combining distinct flavors that complemented one another, but did not lose their individuality. I was amazed that the \"red velvet \" dessert was, in reality, a scoop of smoked chocolate ice cream, over a compote of cherries and covered with crumbled red velvet cake. My wife's allergy to dairy was handled with extreme care by the kitchen. Service was very professional, but with casual affect.  HIghly recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "4.9 stars!  Decided to come here for dinner before seeing Sade and John Legend at the MGM Grand.  My cousin was also in town, so we met here a couple hours before the show.  Ambiance was tones of gold and lavender lighting with dark accents.  The entrance was through glass wine displays that opened up into their bar lounge then main dinning area.  Ambiance:  5 stars!  I arrived first and sat at the bar and ordered a fancy cocktail, whose name escapes me, but contained a smoked peach whiskey.  It was fabulous!  The bartender shares that they smoke their peaches, infusing that flavor into the whiskey.  Pretty amazing.  Knowing we had an 8 pm concert, the staff asked twice throughout dinner how they were doing on time.  Nice to know they know, you know?  Service:  5 stars!  My cousin arrives and we delve into the menu and opt for the $79 Signature Tasting Menu with wine pairings (that went perfectly, btw).  Although it wasn't the prix fixe Restaurant Week menu we were intending, we couldn't resist the urge to splurge.  We started with an amuse-bouche of some fish inspired concoction that was a nice start.  The prix fixe allowed us some room to decide among 2-3 choices in each of the four courses.    First course:   1)  Wagyu Beef Tartare of crushed caper aioli, slow-poached egg and crispy chocolate.  I don't like raw meat, but this was fresh and extremely flavorful.  An intriguing pleaser despite our aversion for raw meat:  4 stars. 2)  Foie Gras 'Brulee' that was more like a tartlet rich with creamy goose liver:  5 stars!  Second course: 1)  Glazed Pork Belly with sweet corn tortellini, Porcini mushrooms & crispy pancetta:  5 star brilliance!  Probably the best dish of the night. 2)  Maine Dayboat Scallops with braised Oxtail, Wild Mushrooms in a salted caramel reduction:  5 stars!  Succulent medallions of scallops adorned in a beautiful sauce that turned out to be my cousin's favorite dish.  Third course: 1)  Iberico Pork Loin with milk-braised cannelloni with baby eggplant and Creminelli Mortadella.  The fact that my cousin offered me none is testament of its superiority:  5 stars! 2)  48 Hour Beef Belly with golden chanterelles, Padron peppers and California plums:  5 stars!  I'm a big sucker for belly meat, so this outrageous dish won big time in my book.  Dessert course: 1)  Peach Praline Profiteroles or roasted peaches with praline gelato and peach jus:  4.5 stars. 2)  Crunchy Chocolate & Peanut Butter Tart with cassis sphere & in a toasted marshmallow sauce:  5 stars!  Give me chocolate or give me death!  A high brow example of a low brow standby.  A great experience, exactly what I wanted to mark my ten year return to Vegas (no joke!)  Tally: Ambiance:  5 stars! Service:  5 stars! First Course:  4+5= 9/2= 4.5 Second Course:  5 stars! Third Course:  5 stars! Dessert Course:  4.5+5= 9.5/2= 4.8 Wine Pairings:  5 stars! 5+5+4.5+5+5+4.8=5= 34.3/7= 4.9 stars  #Yelp 365:  050/365",

    "text": "What a wonderful restaurant.  The decor was dark, pleasant and comfortable for a space so large and open.  The noise level was on the low side with quiet background music piped in. We could have a conversation without raising our voices.  The staff were all the best, kind, helpful and friendly. There were so many plates that sounded so good I was having hard time deciding what to order. I asked more questions to our server then I ever have before; he probably thought that I was an undercover food critic. He gracefully answered all that he could and then went to get the answers that he didn't have. He actually seemed happy to do it too. The sommelier was professional and helpful. The bread with butter and sea salt was really good. I had to have two pieces.  The slow poached egg with truffle shavings was a delicious, aromatic, warm starter.  I finally selected, with some incouragement,  the scallops with braised oxtail. These two items don't sound like they will go together but it turned out to be a nice surprise. It came with four large scallops, perfectly cooked, and just enough oxtail and brown broth to bring both items together into one amazing dish. Pair this with a Pommard Pinot Noir and you have yourself a dinner to remember.  My girlfriend had the bacon wrapped pork loin. I talked her into taking a small slice each of the poached pear, pork belly and bacon wrapped loin and making it into one bitefull. She did and then closed her eyes and moaned a little. I gave her a few minutes to herself before talking again.  They have an extensive wine list with bottles costing less than $100 to upwards into the thousands. This was an all around excellent dinner out. I can't think of one thing that I would criticize.",

    "text": "Beside Chinese food and fast food (no, they're not the same in this part of LA), we prolly eat New American cuisine the most and because of that I can say with sufficient certainty that Sage was not the best we've had but not the worst either. It's a beautiful resto inside of Aria, where we were staying, and so easy to get to from the elevators. Super high ceilings (love!), comfy booth seating, muted lighting with soft purple here and there--low-key high-brow swanky.   The complimentary bread was artisanal, warm and appetite-whetting versus filling and regrettable. Jim was hooked on the murray sea salt that came with the herb-infused butter, so much so he asked the waiter and now we know to buy it at Whole Foods. We both enjoyed our entrees, he his Herb-Crusted Lamb Saddle and I my Fennel Ravioli (nice chunks of yummy crab). We ordered signature cocktails, TGV and The Catwalk, unique with ingredients you don't see every day, if ever again.   Not rounding out this otherwise great experience (the server did his job well, btw) were the Foie Gras Custard Brulee and Grilled Spanish Octopus. The latter was underwhelming but maybe that was the point? and we were supposed to enjoy the clean taste of prepared octopus without the bells and whistles, but the former was a miss for us Californians where illegal foie gras is concerned. The custard format changed the dynamic taste that I normally associate with that delicacy. Thanks anyway, Mr. McClain, you got the concept down and I can see myself returning for a different small plate (oysters anyone?) and a splendid drink to wash it down.",

    "text": "I can't believe all the great reviews, because I was so disappointed with this place.    My boyfriend and I went there for our anniversary, thinking the tasting menu would be worth saving up for.  We're fine dining lovers but also students, and while I certainly realize there are much more expensive places in Vegas, Sage isn't cheap at $79 for a tasting menu plus $39 for the wine pairing.  It's certainly expensive enough that we expected exceptional food and wine.    Unfortunately, that's not the case here.  Each dish was underwhelming at best and completely unfortunate at most.  On top of that and sadly, even if they had been delicious, they were so TINY it barely mattered.  We understand that tasting portions are supposed to be smaller, and we've been to enough really high end restaurants to know, but these plates seemed like a satire of the tiny plates in fancy restaurants.  After spending almost $350, we left talking about ordering grilled cheese from room service later that night.  So, details.  To be fair, let's start with the good stuff.  The restaurant was pretty.  The waiter was attentive.  (The busboy was actually even better--a nice guy who was totally on top of everything.)  The bread, butter and pink sea salt were all tasty.  The menu was creative, which is the reason we chose Sage in the first place.    And....well, that's about it.  Because...that inventive menu?  A mess.  Almost every single dish we had took what might have been a beautiful main ingredient and ruined it by throwing it entirely out of balance.  We started, for example, with lovely oysters.  But those oysters were drowned in a hot sauce foam that completely killed the briny goodness.  Too much!  We also had that famous fois gras brulee, which was served cold (on purpose, but it was kind of unsettling) and which they decided to throw a sweet, sticky spoonful of marmalade on top of, turning it cotton-candy sweet.  The wine pairings were no help.  For example, yes, it's common to pair rich fois with a sweet wine like a Tokaji, which they did.  But how does that make sense when one is already dealing with a mouth full of marmalade?  Sweet on top of sweet on top of rich.  Straight up gross.  The second course was the best, only because it was okay as opposed to outright bad.  We had the scallops, which were decent.  Small, and not particularly exciting, but okay.  The oxtail in the dish was superfluous, but that's fine since there was barely any of it on the plate, and the salted caramel reduction was, again, a little too sweet.  But it was passable.  The pork belly was tiny and not as succulent as pork belly usually is, and the corn tortelloni was meh; maybe some more pancetta and mushrooms would have made it better (because they make everything better.)  Anyway, it was okay.  The wine pairing was also the best of the three, though not exciting...a domestic pinot noir, for example, that I could have found for $10 a bottle at Trader Joe's.  The main course was a complete disaster.  The pork loin was sliced too thin and was completely dry.  The beef belly, which I was totally excited about, was a lovely, juicy cut (though, again, was absolutely minuscule).  Imagine the fatty end of a texas-style bbq brisket.  Yum.  Or...yum until you drown out any semblance of flavor with a bunch of hot jalepeno-like peppers.  Then, not yum.  Not at all.  Where a little heat would have been nice, this was a mouth full of pepper in every bite, killing all other flavor.  And wines that were too sweet for both, all around.  The very best dish we had was the chocolate and peanut butter tart at the end.  But who could mess up chocolate and peanut butter?  It was served with a Madeira wine that made me cringe.  My boyfriend's desert was so unmemorable that I actually don't remember what it was...though it was served with a delicious port, so at least they got one wine right.  All in all, we were completely sad that we made the choice we did.  I'm actually a lover of food from places high and low, and I'm as happy getting delicious $8 ramen from a hole in the wall as I am with a gourmet menu.  However, when you're paying over $350 for a meal, it's fair to expect that the dishes have, at the very least, a nice balance of flavor.  These didn't.    Maybe we came on a bad night.  But we won't find out, because there's no way we're ever going there again.",

I agree with the other reviewers that the steak tartare and scallops were truly special.  The choice between bacon bread and sourdough--no contest--bacon bread.  The service was perfectly paced.  We slowed down between courses 2 and 3, but things continued on perfectly as the staff kept an eye on when we were finished.  The only service change I would make would be hovering water filler who didn't let a sip go un-refilled.  It was truly special without being pretentious or stuffy.  I would love to head back.",

The meal started with an oyster infused with tequila amuse-bouche. Next course was the Maine lobster with pumpkin flan. Succulent. Perfect.  Next was the foie grais brulee. Is this for real? Oh my.

Green apple mousse and the addition of the white chocolate praline soup.   Woo. The table next to us commented on how amazing our meal looked and I had to agree. Perfect with the wine pairing too!  I was quite impressed by the absinthe selection too. They prepare the absinthe traditionally table side which is quite fun to watch. Service is great.

The tartare was excellent, maybe a little too heavy on the capers and mustard seeds. The beet salad was very good. The beets were cooked to just the right texture.  The day boat scallops were cooked perfectly as well but any flavor they may have had was overwhelmed by the oxtail reduction. My waygu beef main was beautifully cooked and presented, but the meat had absolutely no flavor.  The iberico pork was an odd plate - 2 different cuts, one with the texture of a cooked ham, the other more like a roast. Neither was very memorable as far as flavor.  The panna cotta dessert presentation was random at best, with what I think were 2 piles of chocolate graham crumbs as garnish.

The pictures were amazing from what I saw on Yelp but when you walk in you see it's pretty badass. We got there pretty early so it wasn't really busy at all at 6, but by about 8 when we were done most of the tables were full.   The food was fantastic, course after course. We started with the waygu beef tartare and farm egg to share and both were amazing. My main course was the kobe skirt steak which was perfectly cooked and very well seasoned.

MARKET OYSTERS  Piquillo Pepper and Tabasco Sorbet/Aged Tequila Mignonette  (Nigl Riesling Kremsleiten 2005) The oysters went down smooth and then the kick came in from the tabasco and tequila mignonette.  Wow!  what a bite on the buds. good burn WAGYU BEEF TARTARE  (2010 Prieure de Montezargues Tavel Rose) Crushed Caper Aioli/Slow-Poached Egg/Crispy Chocolate  Loved this dish.  chocolate and beef huh?? Yes please. it was great.  the poached egg on top was a perfect texture and complemented the dish quite well. I love capers and the aioli was the coup de grace and was the death of me, but a good death it was.   BACON WRAPPED RABBIT (Olivier Leflaive Bourgogne Blanc Les Setilles 2008) This was a new addition to their menu and was fantastic!!  It was tender, it melted in my mouth, every bite was bliss.   MAINE DAYBOAT SCALLOPS  Braised Oxtail/Wild Mushrooms/Salted Caramel Reduction (Elk Cove Willamette Valley Pinot Noir 2008) I love me some scallops and when scallops are cooked well, I am having a hard time, right now, finding something more pleasant on the palate.  the reduction was a perfect blend of sweat and salty.  the oxtail was amazing as well. very tender and blended with the scallops and reduction, making it the perfect bite of smooth, crust, sweet, salty and savory.  The only thing that made this dish a little less than amazing was the broccolini that was too bitter to eat.  I like broccolini, but this was a bad bunch to me. IBERICO PORK LOIN       Milk-Braised Cannelloni/Baby Eggplant/Creminelli Mortadella (Chateau Des Tourelles Cote-Du-Rhone) This was my least favorite dish.  It was still good, but all in all the texture was off pleasing.  It was mushy and flat.  It also had a cabbage in the dish that was so bitter.  Too bitter for my taste.  Way to bitter.  It ruined a whole bite of food and left my palate hurting.  Yuck!  Two dishes with a bitter component that almost ruined the dish.  They need to address this issue.  8 HOUR BEEF BELLY   Golden Chanterelles/Padron Peppers/California Plums (2005 Finca Allende Rioja Allende) This was my second favorite dish, right behind the scallops.  The beef belly was great, fatty and tender. This was the best pairing of wine I had all night. I needed a high tannin red to help open my palate back up.   CRUNCHY CHOCOLATE AND PEANUT BUTTER TART  Cassis Sphere/Toasted Marshmallow Sauce (Taylor Fladgate 10 Year Tawny Port) WOW!  this tasted like a peanut brittle mixed with a peanut butter cup of epic proportion.  If you didn't want to come for a meal here, come for a drink and ask for a piece of this scrumtrulescent delight.  APPLE FENNEL STRUDEL (Broadbent Madeira Malmsey 10 Years Old) Not a bad finish, but when you compare it to the other dessert, it doesn't hold par and therefore not note worthy.  I was good, tasted like a fancy apple pie a la mode, but nothing more.   They finished us off with a hot chocolate with kailua shot.  It was quite nice and left my wife smiling on the way out.  Chef Shawn McClain came out and the end of our meal and asked us how they did, any improvements he should look upon, and thanked us for coming in.  Very nice touch.   I like going out to eat at the fancy schmancy places but I hate the air of pretensions.  This place left me with a warm feeling.  We were kindly greeted, and seated in a very private and romantic setting.  All of the staff was extremely nice.  No hoity toity feelings.  Friendly and casual.  Thank You for the great night.   If you like good food but do not want a stuffy atmosphere, this is a great place to come.  Although we went with a prix fixe menu, they have plenty of a la carte items and will greatly reduce the overall cost.  YUM.........",

    "text": "Simply wonderful.  In anticipation for our trip to Vegas, my boyfriend and I made a reservation at this spot for our first night in town based on all the great buzz. In the time leading up to the trip, I would occasionally look at the menu, drool, and hope that everything lived it to my inflated expectations.  It did.  We strolled in to the sleek, sexy, restaurant just before our reservation time and were seated immediately. While tempted by the specials of the evening, we decided to go with those items on the menu we'd been dreaming about: the sweetbreads appetizer, the veal cheeks, and the lamb saddle.  We sipped a bit of albarino while waiting for our entrees. Our waiter came by with a taste from the chef. I probably should have asked him to repeat what it was, something containing duck, but it was a very nice way to start the meal. Someone else came by with a choice of bread: mini-baguette or a roll containing bacon. They had me at bacon, but he let us try both, and they were fresh and wonderful.  Then came the glorious, glorious sweetbreads. Can I just say that I love organ meats so, so much? You don't see sweetbreads on enough menus, and these were simply amazing. Perfectly meaty, with a delightfully creamy sauce and even a bit of pork belly. I was appetized.  After that, the entrees. The veal cheeks were tender and delicious, and well accented by the sauce and pieces of sweet potato. The lamb was perfectly cooked and the cauliflower and sugar snap peas were a nice compliment. Magnificent.  I didn't want the meal to end, so we ordered dessert: a pistachio tres leches cake. Need I say more? It was as good as it sounded.  Yeah, it's spendy, but worth every penny. I would love to come back sometime.",

    "text": "This was one of the few places to me that tasted as good as the menu sounded! We tried their signature tasting menu ($89) and wow, it was spectacular. I had the beef tartare, the scallops (cooked perfectly with the sear and crust on the outside), the beef belly, and the panna cotta. It was SO good. I also tried the foie gras creme brulee, which I was a little hesitant about (sweet and savory?) but out of this world kind of good.   I really would recommend this to everyone looking for a fine-dining option on the Strip. It's pricey but it's a full four-course menu-- super filling. The bread is also good too if you think it might not be enough. You won't be disappointed. We are already planning our next trip!",

All of us in our group were really hungry and the server indicated that the courses were not huge, but we went with 3 courses and that was actually a good bit of food.   Everything was beautiful presentation and amazing taste. I highly recommend the alaskan king crab, wagyu beef tartare, & maine day boat scallop if they are available.   Feeling fun?  I had the Pink Cashmere martini which has a unique presentation of a martini glass of pink cotton candy, and the drink poured over it.  It had the perfect blend of taste and sweet without being over powering.   Service was 5-star to the top!",

Spur of the moment we chose to eat here after looking on Eater because our previous plans were ruined. I'm very happy with our choice!   Stacey was experiencing Sage for her second time 5 years later and me for the first time! I loved the Art Deco decor, the purple and dim lighting and the open dining room. The staff was all very nice and pleasant. Our server was the best! He was subtly hilarious and very helpful!   We each got the 3 course meal and shared everything. It was refreshing to have a coursed meal and not everything at once where I'm stuffing myself. I was able to take my time, enjoy the flavors and presentations.   I loved the menu and the charts of the absinthe and the cocktail menu. Yes, I said Absinthe! They have an Absinthe cart here with all different types and origins, which comes last.   In no particular order, we enjoyed the salmon, the Alaskan king crab, the beet salad, foi gras creme brulee, Spanish octopus, scallops. Chocolate dessert.   Cocktails- Sazerac, The Peet, absinthe, espresso.   Thank you for your complimentary items and the experience!",

    "text": "First, I've been to this restaurant on many occasions. Each time the food is excellent and the service is lacking. Sadly, the last visit was no exception.  The service was abysmal.  We made the reservation and arrive 3+ hours ahead of a showtime for a Cirque show. By the end of the evening we did not receive our last course and we missed our show.  They have an excellent vegan tasting menu, but you must ask for the menu.  The first thing that our waiter asked was \"How are you going to pay?\" That's absolutely ridiculous.  No introduction to the restaurant.  No food suggestions.  Only one round of drinks was offered throughout the meal. No water refills. Plates weren't removed to make room for new courses. He was the worst fine dining waiter I've ever experienced. I've eaten many Michelin star restaurants. He rolled his eyes everytime we asked for something. We were in a time crunch because they seated us 40 minutes late. Then they delivered 2 courses together, which was odd because there was a 20 minute wait between course 1 and 2/3. Then another 20 minute wait until course 4. And we never received the 5th course. Completely ridiculous for this level of restaurant. We were celebrating a birthday and engagement and it ruined our weekend.  It frequently came up it conversation with other guest and staff. And we weren't the only ones with a horrible experience.  Save your money. There are plenty of other restaurants.",

We both had a cocktail:  my wife had the pink cashmere and a classic aviator for me.  The pink cashmere was excellent.  A perfect pair of presentation and sweet and sour with spike tartness. It was delicious. As for dinner was both had the 3 course pre fix tasting.     Wife had the Alaskan King crab, wagyu beef tartar and lion of lamb. I had the foie gras burlee, grilled Spanish octopus and scallops. I was most impressed with the wagyu tartar, foie burlee and the scallops.  My wife and I both agreed the foie burlee was the most impressive dish by far. Sommelier did an excellent in pairing my food with wine even I only wanted wine by the class. She offered a 2oz pour for each course for about $29!   It was well worth the money.    In summary, it is a good value for the world of FINE DINNING in Las Vegas. Excellent staff and wonderful food.  Well worth the money. $$$",

    "text": "3.5 stars.  Quality, tasty food and impeccable service. But, it didn't necessarily WOW me and I'm not dying to go back, nor am I inclined to tell everyone and their mother to go try it.  Made reservations for July 4th weekend less than a week in advance, and we were able to get a table easily through OpenTable (which is probably a sign that it isn't THE restaurant to eat at). We were promptly seated upon arrival, and our server was extremely courteous and polite the entire time. Our water glasses were always kept full, and our plates always immediately cleared -- so service is top notch here (as expected).  I had the scallops, which were nicely cooked, and surprisingly filling even though it didn't look like much (3 scallops on top of some veggies). What drew me to this dish was the braised oxtail/salted caramel reduction, which made the scallops that much more hearty and flavorful. I also had a bite of the bf's steak, which was perfectly cooked at his requested medium rare (but again, can't expect nothing less from a restaurant on the Strip).  I think most everyone in our party enjoyed their food, albeit portions on the smaller side (mostly for the boys), but flavors were good and everything was well cooked and presented.  For dessert, I had to get the foie gras candy bar. While it was good, and I ate every bite, I don't know that it was worth $20 -- I couldn't tell there was foie gras in it, so they could've left it out and charged me less, and I would've been just as happy. it came with caramel popcorn and gold flakes on top that made it extra fancy and decadent.   Bf had the blueberry and cheese crepes, and this is where we acted like a bunch of kids -- the cheese was a stinky cheese, which is fine, but we just weren't used to it. He said it tasted fine after the initial shock, but every smell of that crepe was like smelling our dog's breath! Feel free to roll your eyes because I would do the same at myself, but it seriously smelled so bad! I guess we're just not stinky cheese people, haha. But, as with everything else, it looked good!  Again, overall, a great dining experience with 5-star service. Food was good, but just missing that WOW factor.",

    "text": "Made last minute reservations for a party of 4 thru Opentable.  Located in the Aria, our table wasn't ready upon arrival, but we were seated within 5 minutes.  Stepping into a Vegas restaurant inside the hotels is always such a surprise; is it going to be bright or dim, loud or quiet, packed or sparse of people.  Sage?  A pleasant surprise! Dim, quieter than expected, tables well spaced and just the right amount of people.    Concept? Food concept is Farm to Table; different than other Vegas restaurants.   The menu offers 4 options:  a chef's tasting menu, or from the regular menu, you can pick 2, 3 or 4 courses.  BUT, there are only 2 groupings of food, starters & entrees.  And if looking for a Salad?  Only 1 Kale option.  Hmmm.  Our group took a longer amount of time to make our choices.  Each dish was so varied with flavors that it was difficult to look for a pairing that the tastes would blend (they should make suggestions).  We decided as a group to share, so that we could try a little of everything.  Everyone opted for 2 courses ($69).    Food? Roasted Pear-blue cheese mousse, glazed bacon, walnut butter.  I wasn't a fan.  Alaskan King Crab-sunchokes, grapefruit, belgian endive.  Unmemorable. Foie Gras Brulee-huckleberry compote, toasted cocoa nib, toasted brioche.  Interesting taste combination and Very Good. Wagyu Beef Tartare-crushed caper aioli, slow poached egg, crispy chocolate.  Of the starters, this was the STAR.  Delicious.  Everyone at the table was a fan.  Highly recommend. Columbia River Sturgeon-cauliflower emulsion, baby spinach, capers.  Good.   Grilled Skirt Steak-charred brassicas, seasame, miso soubise.  Very Good.  Prepared just right and flavorful. Truffle Risotto (Special)-THIS IS A MUST.  EVERYONE LOVED.  We wish there was more.  They have quite a selection of Absinthes, but our group opted for coffee.    A very pleasant dining experience and great place to talk.",

Several of us ordered the wagyu new york strip medium rare and they got it right for 3 out of the 4 orders.  They are very accommodating, so let them know if your order is not right.  My colleague had the duck breast and loved it.  It was just as good and big as the one at Bardot.",

    "text": "We first visited Sage a few years ago on Valentine's Day. The Chef's tasting menu with wine pairings was fantastic! We were so impressed by the excellent food, five star service, and interesting (and hard to find) wines! We had to come back!  We visited Sage again this past Friday. The hostess seated us right away, and we were greeted within moments by Marcus, our waiter. Marcus not only had an amazing, professional, calm, and cool personality - he paid attention to things that compare to a three Michelin star restaurant. He made some great food recommendations and when we told him we were interested in some of their wines, he sought Christina, the sommelier to our table. Christina and Marcus worked in sync together to perfectly pair our foods and wines. We had the oysters, slow poached farm egg, Parmesan bacon ravioli, gem salad, spring pea soup, Maine day boat scallops, veal cheeks, ginger cake, and chocolate torte (in order). We had about 6 wines total (we spilt them so we could sample more) and every one was perfectly paired with our feast.   Our water glasses were never empty and Christina and Marcus made us feel special and well taken care of. At one point, one of the bussers removed one of the appetizer plates before we were finished and Marcus appeared like a ninja with a new plate and said 'I am so sorry about that.'  Seriously - what other waiter would notice something like that?! It's the fine details that impressed us.   Overall, we feel Sage is one of the best restaurants for both food and service in Las Vegas. I am so happy we revisited this lovely establishment, and I look forward to our next visit!",

I don't quite understand why would you ever do this to foie gras: just like they put it though blender and mixed with caramel brulee. If you like to dine tasty and you know how good foie gras tastes this is definitely not the best dish for you. I'm quite open to experiments but not to this extend.  Can't say anything for the rest of the menu, since our expectations were ruined and we didn't order anything else but the drinks. I don't feel like going back again here. If not the music, I would give this place 1 star only.",

    "text": "We had to move our reservation since our event ran longer than expected. We got pushed back almost 2 hours later since that's all they had available - when we got here, they weren't even busy. We were so tired and hungry that we finished our French rolls and bacon bread with chive butter and pink sea salt.  You walk through a wine chiller and pass by the bar to get to the main dining area. It's a nice and cozy place.  Foie Gras Custard Brulee: Fig, toasted cocoa nibs served with salted brioche. I enjoy foie gras so this was a must. Creamy custard, sweet torched sugar on top. The brioche was nice and buttery. I finished this all by myself. 5/5  Amuse Bouche: This changes constantly. What we had for the evening was tuna with mousse and it was fresh and delicious. 4/5  36-Hour Braised Wagyu Short Rib: Short rib with horseradish-smoked potato pave, roasted parsnip and, red onion jam. The short rib was so tender and full of flavor.  The potato was crispy but tender inside. 4/5  Bacon-Wrapped Iberico Pork Loin: Crispy braised pork shoulder wrapped in bacon on top of veggies and moked apple puree. Pork has the tendency to get dry but this wasn't. The acidity from the apple puree balances the fatty pork/bacon. 4/5  Milk Chocolate and Earl Grey Panna Cotta: Panna cotta, chocolate brushed on the plate, cream, blackberries, chocolate crumbs and madeleines. Beautifully presented. The variety on a plate made for interesting flavor and texture combinations.4/5  Hot White Chocolate Infused with Sage: For somebody who dislikes white chocolate, this was pretty good. Hot, sweet and the sage helped in changing the otherwise boring flavor of white chocolate. 3/5  The service and ambiance were both excellent. But don't expect to get full just by ordering one dish. You're here for an experience.",

    "text": "While I am spoiled with a husband who enjoys taking me out to nice places, I must say, I was utterly underwhelmed last night. I am not a high maintenance  girl AT ALL, I'm cool with just a regular restaurant with a regular menu.  We arrived early and had a cocktail at the bar. While stocked with many different spirits, dark liquors such as bourbon and whiskey are their schtick. I went with my old faithful Tito's Vodka and club with loads of lime, much to the dismay of the bartender. Known for their mixology I'm sure he was disappointed in my boring choice. My husband ordered the same, although sin lime, even more quotidian.  About 45 minutes later our table was ready and friends who'd decided to join us arrived, we were seated at a large round table. Immediately a waiter came over and introduced himself and almost right away his friendly, wagging demeanor shone through. Offering to get us more cocktails, did we have questions, etc.  Another server filled water glasses, offered champagne, which I declined as I keep it just good ol' Vodka thanks. Then.... we sat. And sat. I kept looking around for our server, I checked the menu again, drank my water, waited. Even a wife of my husband's colleague asked when they'd take our order. Finally, about fifteen minutes later our server reappears. Questions are answered about the pairing menu, substitutions that can be afforded, dietary restrictions for one dinner companion.  Then, we wait.... like 15 minutes later a server with a wooded basket of bread offers a small fresh bread or a bacon bread. Then.... we wait. I swear, it's been over 30 minutes since the offering of bread and I know this to be True because the other wife was watching her wristwatch closely. Every ten minutes she'd comment on her ever-growing hunger.  Finally, bowls of soup appears on the arms of our server. A squash soup with a lovely ginger foam and bits of root vegetables and I believe mushroom. Toothsome to be sure.... And then we wait.  30 minutes again passes before another plate is presented. This time and each time a plate was brought out, everything was good, but honestly, my palette must be quite imperceptible. I tasted a lot of unique and flavorsome plates, although some were overly salted and too creamy in my lowly opinion. The chicken I had was quite overly salted.  Albeit the long waits in between proved fruitful for my husband's business dealings, but ugh, the wait. Almost 3.5 hours for dinner is tooooooo loooooong for me.  Bill, minus tip, was just under $900 (for 5 people).  Would I return? I'll probably try other properties' restaurants.",

    "text": "Finally we tried out Sage tonight for my bf's birthday.  The signature tasting menu has upped from $79 to $89 and wine/beer pairing has upped from $39 to $44.  Here are the items we got:  Amuse Buche: Smoked salmon profiterole.  One bite that excited our palate.  Then we got to choose the bacon bread or the sourdough bread to spread some chive butter and sprinkle some Himalayan sea salt on it if we like.  I prefer the sourdough.   1st Course: -Wagyu Beef Tartare -Delicious.  The beef was tender and yummy with the nice crushed caper aioli to give it that oomph and the slow poached egg to bring everything together.  We were given crostini to top the tartare on.  This was paired with a Chimay white. -Foie Gras Brulee (extra $10)-like a savory dessert.  Too rich for my taste.  I only ate a quarter and was done with this.  Winner: Wagyu Beef Tartar  2nd Course: -Grilled Spanish Octopus: The octopus pieces were so tender...never had it this tender ever!  These octopus slices were served with smoked Potato Puree, fried potatoes, and other veggies.  This was paired with a Unibroe. -Maine Dayboat Scallops:  2 jumbo scallops and they were cooked to perfection.  American Fish can learn from Sage how to cook seafood.  They were served with braised oxtail and wild mushrooms.  The scallops were the star and I could care less about the oxtail and mushrooms.  Winner:  Both were delicious, but scallops win by a few points.  3rd Course: -Iberco Pork Loin: the pork loin was a bit salty, the ham was not memorable, the crispy pork shoulder was delicious.  This was paired with a dark beer that my bf cannot remember the name of but he loved this beer.   -48 hour beef belly:  Very tender.  It was served with grilled peach.  This was paired with a Chimay Red.  Winner: 48 hour beef belly, although the crispy pork shoulder in the Iberco Pork Loin was pretty darn good!  4th Course: -Gianduja Pave: This is an olive oil ice cream with pieces of hazelnut crunch and basil jam.  It was quite beautiful  but a  bit hard to eat since we have to spoon a bit of the ice cream, the blue berries, the hazelnut crunch, the chocolate, to get them all in one bite.  My bf didn't like this dessert as much as I did. -Pistachio Tart:  The tart was in little pieces, strategically laid out on top of some stringy cake, served with sauteed strawberries and a strawberry-black pepper gelato.  Interesting flavor combination.  It also came with a lit candle for my bf.  My bf loved this dessert.  This was paired with a fruity lindemann beer.  Winner:  Tied.  We ended the night with this white chocolate drink, compliments of the chef.  Was yummy in my tummy.  The total bill, including tip, was $300.  Worth it?  Yes.  Service was impeccable.",

The specials were never discussed with us.  Also, a very unique concept of ordering amongst groups of options and you choose how many courses.  But this was not properly explained to me and made me feel foolish. My beef tartar arrived first, surprise because the salad was in the first grouping.  I asked to have salad first, waiter was surprised.  Huh, beef before salad??!!  Therefore, my wife started without me. I made VERY clear that I do not eat pork.   My salad arrived with shaved ham all over.  Sent it back.  Wife was finishing her appetizer. Beef tartar was amazing. Entree arrived and greens were covered with bacon pieces.  I made VERY clear I do not eat pork. At this price I had higher expectations.",

There was a prix fixe menu at $85 which came as no surprise. I ordered the half dozen oysters with caviar (which came with a supplement) as a starter and my was it phenomenal! The oysters had such clean almost sweet flavors no brininess! As my main I had the Australian Wagyu which was so unbelievably tender paired marvelously with what I believe was a bernaise sauce.

    "text": "On our quest to find the perfect Strip eats we were once again sadly disappointed. Sage has all the makings of the perfect Vegas dining establishment. Large and swanky- just walking in makes you feel way cooler than you are. Service is spot on and the wine list is appropriately way over priced (we are definitely dining on the Strip). The problem lay with the food itself.  We started with the beef tartare (definitely missing the worcestershire), the oysters (the mignonette accompanying these tasty little morsels was perfection), a frisee salad (which was overdressed and had way too much bacon- is too much bacon ever a bad thing?- In this case it was), and sweetbreads (the best thing we ate)..  For the main course I had the duck and was dismayed to note that it was unevenly cooked. Some slices were undercooked making the meat tough and chewy. Undercooked duck verges on inedible duck. If you're in this swanky of a place the meat should be cooked to perfection. My mother in law had a pasta topped with crab and stuffed with fennel. Sounds amazing- right? Nope serious salt OD. Our other dining mates had scallops and a New York strip steak (and were both licking their plates clean). Hmm maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.   As for dessert- I have a huge glutinous sweet tooth and often eagerly look forward to the end of the meal. The caramelized layer cake is probably one of the worse desserts I've had in recent memory. Super dried out with random bits of panna cotta and ice cream decorated around the plate. Looked pretty, tasted awful.   Sadly Sage is being added to an ever growing list of overpriced mediocre eats on the Strip.",

    "text": "I had a spectacular experience. it's one of the few restaurants I visited during restaurant week that I would actually go back to. I'm definitely going back there to try their tasting menu. 8 courses of amazing food? Yes please.   We started off with cocktails while we waited for our table to finish being ready. They serve moscow mules there, which is one of my favorite cocktails. It was pretty decent pricing for being on the strip ($17).   Like I said earlier, when I went I was there for restaurant week. Everything I had was great. They even gave us a free amuse-bouche and a free little dessert drink. We also ordered the beef tartar in addition to the pre fixe. I'm pretty sure we ate it all within a couple minutes.   I'll update this as soon as i go back and try the tasting menu. I'm not sure if the food offered during restaurant week is on their regular menu - so I don't want to dive too far into that. But, the food was all good enough to make me want to go back and try their regular items.",

    "text": "Did some research before coming to Vegas and found out this place served a variety of absinthe so a few friends and I wanted to see the green fairies and give it a try.  This place is very gorgeous just like the aria. I am probably going to have to update my review the next time my girlfriend and I come back because we did not have order any food so all I am basing my review on is the service at the bar.  Ok so the bar service/bartender was not very pleasant.Maybe it's because preparing each individual absinthe drink is kind of a long process. I don't know. But he was very rude. And never asked if we needed anything else once we got our one drink.  Drinks: absinthe range in prices and it is so entertaining to watch, you can have it prepared 3 different ways. I only remember two. The traditional and the Russian style. The Russian style is very entertaining. He lights up the absinthe in the glass and then you just see liquid fire going from one glass to another and then he traps the vapors in the glass with a cloth napkin and then you get to sniff the alcohol vapors and you get such a rush. It's not for lightweights I can tell you that right now.    If the service was better I would of given a better rating,but I will be returning to try the food for sure it looked and smelled great.",

    "text": "Ah...where to begin?  Sage is a treasure. Hubs and I were treated to a trip to Vegas following our beautiful Sonoma County wedding (aka, our Honeymoon) in November 2011. I did a lot of research beforehand and used trusty Yelp to make my decision on where to dine for our \"fancy\" night out. (The word fancy always reminds me of Squidward for some reason).  I settled on Sage after much research into price, location, menu, and general Yelp happiness. I will say that their tasting menu and wine pairing were mostly what made me decide on this restaurant. Our close friends gave us a generous wedding gift certificate to Aria to assist with the cost as well, so needless to say, we were well on our way to maximum enjoyment.  We went early to expand our meal options since they offer another tasting menu for early diners. We started with a few martinis (Grey Goose dirty martini for me) while we soaked up the atmosphere. Posh is how I would describe it, and pleasantly lit.   We had forgotten to go grab our gift certificate from the front desk, and the host went to grab it for us when my husband was getting up to grab it. When Hubs tried to tip him for the service, he refused the tip and said, \"just doing my job.\" Big score for Sage's staff there.  Our waiter was very nice and attentive, which didn't change even when the restaurant got busier. We ended up ordering the $79 tasting menu with wine pairing. Hubs and I each got something different off the tasting menu so we could get the full scope of the menu. So happy that we did.  It's been about 8 months so I can't remember everything, but here were the highlights of the meal:  Bread: They had some bread that had bacon in it! To die for! Even better though (I know, how does it get better than bacon?) was the butter. It was lavender butter. Whipped and creamy and orgasmic. I was a little buzzed so I though nothing of sticking my finger in the bowl and cleaning up the tidbits that remained. I have never been so impressed with bread and butter.  Wagyu Beef Tartare: I've already used orgasmic so let's go with phenomenal on this. Seriously, I still have dreams of finding something this good ever again. A poached egg sits a top this yummy pile of raw meat and once pierced oozes its gooey goodness down into the rest of the goodness. What a treat!  Scallops: I don't remember exactly how they were prepared (the wine pairing is quite a doozy, fair warning), but I remember that they were really tasty. And not overcooked - which is a huge gripe I have over the preparation of scallops.  48 hour pork belly: Again, I'm going to blame this on the alcohol, but I don't remember too much here but that it was excellent (and we were getting very full). Hubs and I both ordered this one and yummed it all up.  And I honestly don't remember too much more than that. But hey, it's Vegas, right?  Everything was paced well and the staff had great patience for our slow going. Our waiter even sent the sommelier over to chat with us once when we mentioned that we were from Sonoma County and Hubs worked at a boutique winery in Russian River Valley.  Overall, great experience, staff, and food. The $400 price tag (including tip) was worth it.",

Reservation is highly recommended because of their rising popularity since their celebrity chef Shawn McClain's winning on American Iron Chef.   The dark purple decoration inside the restaurant makes it look trendy and fun. Dark wood, dim lighting, high chair at the bar, sofa seating with leather cover, all in all make this place upscale and fun.   We came here for appetizer and drinks and their pink lemonade is amazing! I should certainly come back and try their absinthe. It seems so interesting. We had their Greek salad and Foie Gras Creme Brulee. I have to say that salad is probably the best I had in a long time. It is simple and fresh with their special sauce. I almost want to rush back to the kitchen and get the recipe. For the Foie Gras, which is their signature dish. I can't have enough!  Highly recommend it!   The service is impeccable. Our server knows what she is doing and gave us a great \"class\" on their food and prep, very knowledgeable and polite.   I highly recommend this place for any occasions.",

    "text": "Ah, Sage.  I was looking forward to this restaurant perhaps the most on the trip, but it turned out being not what I expected.  First, this place definitely is worthy of a 5* star review, hence the rating.  The service was impeccable.  Since we were celebrating our anniversary, they treated us like royalty with complementary champagne and the egg course.  The amuse bouche of gazpacho and the white hot chocolate were excellent additions.  My husband and I chose to do the signature four-course tasting menu and each had something different.  The wine pairings were tasty and spot on, although I personally am not a fan of dessert wines or ports, but that's no fault of theirs.  The steak tartare and oysters were immaculate and extremely fresh and tasty.  The spanish octopus was the best I'd ever eaten (and the most tender and best cooked) and the beef belly was so flavorful and moist.  We also really enjoyed the pork and the scallops, though we felt not all the pieces went together for us personally.  This became really evident to us when we had dessert.  Their signature dessert, the gianduja pave... after hearing so many rave reviews on Yelp, we almost ordered two of these.  Thankfully, we got the pistachio tart as well!  It's not that it was bad, I think it was an extremely inventive dish, but we didn't really understand/agree with the pairing with olive oil and basil.  I just remember cutting the chocolate part in half (to split it), licking the spoon and being grossed out because it was all olive oil.  We thought the ice cream (olive oil too) was actually the star of the dish.  With this being said though, we can see how this dish may be amazing to some people, but it and some of the other dishes' components were perhaps a little too complex for our preferences.  Thus, in review, Sage is an excellent restaurant.  The service is outstanding and the detail and skill going into cooking make the food amazing.  While most of what we had was fantastic, we weren't a fan of all the complex combinations of ingredients, and prefer more simplistic gourmet meals - some people may feel this way too, but I applaud Sage for being different and trying things that some people might not appreciate as much :)",

    "text": "So I finally got to eat at Sage after several failed attempts the past few times I've been in town. I have to say it was worth all the hype and did not disappoint.  We both got Chef McClain's Signature Tasting Menu. Started off with the amuse bouche was a single oyster with Tabasco foam on top. I started off my 1st course with the Shaved Brussels Sprout salad with pears, macadamia nuts and crisp bacon mixed in.  I enjoyed this dish because I love brussels sprouts in any form. Oh as an extra we got the Foie Gras Custard Brulee with a hint of blood orange taste -I thought this was an excellent pairing of something you wouldn't normally put together.  It came with warm salted brioche as well. *2nd course-Maine Day Boat Scallops with braised oxtail and shitake mushrooms. This course was my favorite of the whole meal-scallop was cooked perfectly and the oxtail and mushroom complimented it so well. Then the 3rd course was the 48 Hour Beer Belly-the meat was very tender and delicious. For the 4th course dessert I chose the chocolate tart that had crunchy bits of nuts on top which gave it an overall taste like nutella to me :)  And to top the meal off we did the whole presentation at our table of a BLAZING (now legalized) Absinthe liquor where you first have to inhale the fumes through a straw before drinking it.  Very impressive and cool and to be warned very potent.   Service was wonderful, interior was beautiful, everything was pretty much perfection.",

By the time we got to the restaurant at 8, we were feeling the effects of an extremely long travel day....waking up 4 am NY time for our flight in to LV. So I couldn't enjoy this really excellent restaurant's cuisine as much as I wanted to (NOTE TO SELF-DON'T WASTE GOOD RESTAURANTS ON TRAVEL DAYS- STICK WITH BUFFETS).   The sweetbreads and pork belly appetizer I had was one of the best apps i have ever eaten...sweetbreads and pork belly are awesome by themselves, put them together in one dish and you will instantly be transported to Yummyville where everyone is singing and dancing and houses are made of bacon and happiness is abound. Unfortunately, my steak entree quickly negated any appetite I had left as it was chewier than the Michelin Man's ass (not that I ever tried to chew on the Michelin man's ass). The flavor was interesting....salsa verde and black truffle paste...it worked for a few bites then got unpleasant...but that may have more to do with me having to chew each piece 52 times.   We skipped dessert because we were not at 100% as stated before, so i was disappointed that I couldn't indulge in that. The wine I ordered- by the glass- an awesome Burgundy who's name escapes me but i have it written down I think- went well with both the app and entree. The service was top notch...really friendly, polite, and effecient. The setting and ambience is beautiful and we had a great spot..our own cozy booth away from everyone else. Oh yeah, and they have bacon bread.  I def. want to come back here..i give it four stars because I am minusing one for the steak, but I think there are many things on that menu that would push it to five stars.",

Wine selection was good but that is no trick in Vegas, or anywhere else where just the dinner will be min $50 per person.

    "text": "I am quite undecided about how to rate the whole experience at Sage. Food was really good but very one note... There was no progression in the Signature menu - every dish was rich and heavy and one was similar to the other in more ways than one.  The wine pairing was OK. I am not a big wine person so I wouldn't know the quality but i liked 3 out of 4 of them.  Foodwise, Tried every options except the brussel sprouts on the menu. It would be a little lengthy to go through all the 8 dishes plus Amuse but these are the hits:  Wagyu Beef Tartare - really good and seasoned very well. I liked the poached egg touch rather than raw. Not the least bit slimy.  Foie Gras Brulee - Rich and quite strange. I can't stop eating it but the iron-y aftertaste can be off putting to some. The brioche that came with was amazing!  Maine Dayboat Scallops - The scallops were quite good and it came w delicious braised oxtail.  48 Hour Beef Belly - Great dish. Very rich and tender...Flavours are reminiscent of BBQ Ribs.  The other dishes were OK, nothing great but well prepared. But I didn't like either desserts, they were a little blah...   Service was horrendous that night. Our 4 course meal took us over 2.5 hours. We waited for over 30 minutes before our orders were taken... Our waiter was never around and it was just overall frustrating to spend so much time trying to find him to order, to get the bill and even to order a coffee with my dessert!",

    "text": "Came back for a bachelor party and had a better meal than last time because I had a better sense of what to order.  Enjoyed the sweetbreads, octopus salad, the special of Sous Vide Beef Belly, and finished with a rhubarb parfait.  I thoroughly enjoyed everything.  Bumping this down to 3 stars because our waitress, Virginia, charged us 1 extra coffee (we ordered 2, charged for 3), and when I brought it to her attention, she looked up and down the table and counted our cups.  \"Well, I guess if there are only 2 pots, then there must only be 2 orders,\" and she walked away to fix it.  It just seemed like my correction was met with skepticism and was not followed with an apology.  The situation just wasn't handled well, especially considering that our party just blew $1200 there.  Now maybe you're thinking, why would you ask for a $5 coffee to be removed from such a huge bill anyway... and I thought about just ignoring it, but in the end, I couldn't let it slide.  It ended the dinner on an awkward note, but at least the meal was delicious.",

Dinner took twice as long as it should have.  I had to go eat a real dinner after this disaster because I was still so hungry. But what little they did serve me was excellent. So this is another case of the front of house failing the back of house. Management needs to apologize to the chefs. When I let the matre d know how disappointed I was he said he was sorry. Not as sorry as I was picking this dog for my last dinner In town (second to last because I had to go get food after this starvathon)",

    "text": "Oh Sage, how I love thee. Yes, this place makes me use words like \"thee.\" This is my favorite restaurant, not my favorite in LV, my favorite. The best meal I've had in my life - it was here and I have eaten at some pretty amazing places.   Walking in to the bar area, waiting for our reservation time - it's nice to arrive early to grab a drink, I feel immediately relaxed. The chairs at the bar are really comfortable and the twists on classic cocktails are interesting. Once seated, we're greeted by Bond. He is the best, a True professional and very good at what he does. We always request him when making our reservations and always have him as our server. He is very knowledgeable about the menu, drinks, everything, he makes great suggestions, and makes the experience exactly what you would want it to be in a high end restaurant. He is attentive but not over bearing, also not snobbish AT ALL.   The food here is the kind that makes you literally close your eyes and savor what you're tasting. I've only had the Maine Day Boat Scallops but plan on trying the rest of the menu during future visits. My husband has had the Braised Veel Cheeks and Snake River Farms New York Strip. Both, he assures me, are amazing. On our most resent visit we tried the Wagyu Beef Tartare, delicious. It's a shame I'm not a foodie so I could give detailed descriptions! All I can say is so far, what I've mentioned is delectable. For dessert go for the Gianduja Pave (Hazelnut Crunch/Pomegranate/Olive Oil Ice Cream/Basil) or Arancini Dolce (Caramelized Banana Gelato/Chocolate Streusel/Horchata Foam), you won't be disappointed with either of those selections. Those descriptions are straight from the dessert menu on their site, I'm not trying to plagiarize. Again, I am not a foodie, I just know what I like! Order a glass of Absinthe as well if you're feeling extra adventurous...have fun!",

Its everything I want in contemporary fine dining. I first tried Sage last year when Aria first opened and I immediately fell head over heels in love.  I had a memorable dinner here on a double date with my parents and my boyfriend.  We loved everything about the meal--from the tasty amuse bouche to the delectable mignardises. Our server was very knowledgeable and friendly.  By the end of the night, he was cracking jokes with my parents and having us all laughing.  He was also able to answer all my boyfriend's questions and inquiries regarding the preparation and cooking methods of the food.  And, yes, my boyfriend has lots of question because he is a chef as well.    The sommelier was very helpful as well.  He helped pick out a great bottle of wine for the table to share.  Our wine glasses were never half empty--a staff member was always there to pour more wine.  Even my parents, who are not the biggest wine fans, loved the wine recommended by the sommelier.    Everything on the menu is delicious.  Ingredients are fresh and high in quality.  The food is prepared well and the flavors are well thought out and executed precisely.  We were all beyond satisfied with our meal. I try to eat dinner here every time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "I went here for the Iberico pork and absinthe. I got to mark those two things off my culinary bucket. Here's how the rest of the meal went.  I really wanted the prix fix menu, but everyone at the table has to participate. At $89 each, it seemed like a deal, actually. But the Hubs had his eye on the short ribs from the dinner menu, so we just chose our own entrees.   The waiter brought us a basket of bread with two kinds of bread in it. I don't remember what the second kind was because all I heard him say was \"bacon bread.\" It was amazing. The bacon was so finely chopped up you could barely see it in the bread. It was like bacon dust throughout the bread. And it was crispy on the outside and soft inside. Amazing.  To start, we got the Wagyu steak tartare, which probably the best I've ever had (who knows if it was really wagyu or not, but it was very very good). Here's were things began to get weird. When it came time to place our order, I ordered the Iberico pork loin, but I said \"Iberico ham, I mean, loin.\" I think they thought I said \"lamb loin,\" which is also on the menu. Another person in our party also ordered the Iberico pork. But when the food came out, they only brought one, and gave me a lamb loin. When I said, that's not what I ordered, they looked at me really funny and took it away. It was kinda noisy and I guess it was technically my fault, but we didn't even get an apology or anything. It was bizarre that something like that would happen at a restaurant like this, and that they wouldn't apologize. The mix up really didn't spoil our meal or experience, though. We laughed about it later.  The Hub's short ribs were to die for. He actually makes a very good recipe for short ribs himself, and when he orders short ribs at a restaurant, he always says his are better. But not this time. I tasted them, and they were just the right ratio of fatty and meaty. The lamb loin did look good, and someone else at our table ordered it and said it was very good. It came with morels, and she ordered it mostly because of that. We have them every spring in WV, but none of us had ever ordered them from a restaurant.   Once the Iberico pork did come out, it was exceptional. But It wasn't like the holy grail of pork like I thought it would be. Think pasture raise pork prepared really well. Is it better than regular pork loin? Exponentially. It was darker meat (like the color of ham instead of the usual pale pink or white of pork loin). There was another kind of pork on the plate with it. It's not listed on the menu on their website, but it was like pulled pork. Except it reminded me of salt cod; very salty, dry and flaky. It was WAY over salted--and maybe it was supposed to be, but I think they could have left this off the plate. It really only took away from the lovely Iberico pork loin.  Sage has an absinthe menu, and it's quite a presentation. I'd never tried it before, but I've wanted to since it recently was legalized in the U.S. Since I didn't know anything about the different kinds of absinthe, I asked the waiter about the differences. He was very knowledgeable about them. There were offerings from Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, France, Switzerland and a few others. The Wisconsin one is actually owned partly by Marilyn Manson, and it's called Mansonithe or something like that. Very kitchy. I went with the Swiss absinthe because the waiter told me it was a recipe from 1902 (hello, upsale). The drinks run anywhere from $25 to $35. The absinthe is poured in a brandy glass. A sugar cube is placed on a slotted absinthe spoon and lit on fire. After most of the sugar melts, distilled water is poured on it from this big silver dispenser that looked a little like a hookah. The presentation was exquisite, but the taste... meh. If you don't like Jagermeister, you won't like absinthe. But if you really just want the wow factor of the presentation and to say you tried it once (and maybe won some money in Vegas that you want to blow), this is the place to do it.",

There are a million steakhouses in Las Vegas and so I was hesitant to try their special of the evening which was a prime  bone in ribeye for 2 priced at 120. It came with a foie gras emulsion ,whipped potatoes, and caramelized onions. Sounded awesome ! We started out with a bottle of wine and the ahi appetizer.  Anyways, the 120 ribeye came out sliced and COLD. no problem- i sipped on wine as they said they would heat it up-(now u run the risk of overcooking) comes out- not hot again!(I AM NOT EXAGGERATING- slightly  almost warm ) plus by this time the potatoes are reeally cold. For a restaurant of this caliber I just wasnt impressed by the fact that they couldnt remedy the situation or even offer new sides . The manager came by and told us that perhaps we should pick something else off the menu because \" WE CANNOT serve u a Hot steak, our kitchen cannot do that\"  what the? its almost laughable !-  He was unapologetic and short/smug -so in short- do not come here if you enjoy HOT STEAKS lol -The night before we had a steak at a place that serves sizzling steaks on 400 degree plates. This is my favorite way to eat steaks- hot ! I understand all about the \"resting\" and juices running etc but IT CAN BE DONE! (u undercook the steak slightly below preferred temp and put it on a sizzling butter plate ) if it was so impossible then why are there wonderful steakhouses that do it ? we left and had to get some tacos at javiers because I just wasnt going to spend anymore money here .what a shame -I will however, write a review of a place that was able to make this \"impossible\" hot steak I speak of later-",

    "text": "This spot lands in my top 5 favorite restaurants in Vegas. My wife made a reservation for a Friday night and it did not disappoint.  Service was exceptional. From our server (I believe his name is Jason as well), sommelier, the mixologists, to the people bringing out our dishes and serving us water. Didn't feel rushed one second through the whole dining experience. I could also appreciate that our server first asked if we had any time constraints prior to ordering.  We both opted for the chef's tasting menu and added an order of the Kusshi oysters, and I'm glad we did!  Appetizer: Kusshi oysters - delicate, nice hint of brine with a sweet finish  Tasting menu: Scallop Crudo - WOW, just WOW! I've had scallops at other restaurants before, but this is by far the best scallop dish I've experienced. Buttery, salty, smooth velvety texture.  Langostine Bisque - Tastes just like a traditional butter lobster bisque, but using langostine. A couple chunks of langostine tails included.   Warm Squash Custard - If there was a way to taste the seasons, this would be the perfect example of fall/winter in each bite. Little bits of foie gras, honey and granola paired up beautifully in this dish.  Grilled Beef Ribeye Cap - Didn't have much marbling to the meat, but still seasoned and cooked perfectly medium rare and was just the right size.  The kale and pear was a nice balance as well.  Coconut Lemongrass Cremeux - To be honest with you, I don't even remember this dish since I was full and ad the bottom of our bottle of wine, but I'm sure it was a nice palate cleanser to end our dining experience.  Again, not only was the food well balanced and very flavorful, the service was very attentive and timed each course perfectly. At $110 per person, it was well worth the money and comparable to other tasting menus that are $250+ that we've had at other restaurants. From one foodie to another, this place is definitely worth checking out.  ____________  We ended up coming the following night to sit at the bar. Again, the mixologists were spot on and consistent with my old fashions. If you're a gin drinker and need something refreshing, order the Corpse Reviver #2 (not on the menu), but they do this drink justice. If you want something sweet, the cotton candy cocktail is a well presented drink. The musician had a beautiful voice and really set the tone of the bar area. If you're looking for something low-key to have a conversation, come here!",

She didn't ask if we wanted dessert, and didn't acknowledge the special occasion.  What a disappointment.  Expensive for the level of service and food quality we received. Too bad.   The restaurant was also quite loud and had a very strange vibe.",

    "text": "\"This is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. I'm not ashamed to say I've had every item on the menu multiple times.\" With that introduction, our host for dinner yesterday evening kicked off an amazing dinner experience.  The ambience is really cool featuring relaxing lighting and a quiet atmosphere very conducive to dinner conversation. Our host selected a variety of appetizers with which to whet our palates. My favorite was the Wagyu Beef Tartare, succulently flavored and deliciously rich. A close second was the Roasted Veal Sweetbreads - in all my years of dining in many fine restaurants, this was my first sampling of sweetbread. Oh, my goodness, it was outstanding! Our third appetizer was the Fois Gras Brulee, served with a strawberry compote. Don't let the fact that this was my third favorite of three mislead you - this was delicious in its own right but for my palate the beef tartare carried the day.  For entrees, the Maine Bay Scallops with braised oxtail came highly recommended; our host and one of my coworkers selected this. I love scallops but I couldn't get past the roasted venison loin. Served a perfect medium rare, it was wonderfully flavored and I was very pleased with my selection. Another coworker chose the beef short rib and reported it delicous as well. As for the scallops, our host was kind enough to transfer one of his to my plate in exchange for a sampling of venison. The scallop was delicious, but I was pleased with my selection.  For dessert I went exotic again and ordered the Foie Gras Candy Bar - salt & pepper peanut butter cream covered in milk chocolate and served with an amazing bourbon caramel sauce. Holy Sweet Tooth, Batman, we have a winner! And it complimented my post-dinner B&B very nicely.  Like the fare, the service was first class. Wine and water glasses were kept full and the servers were appropriately attentive without hovering.  Sage earned a no-brainer five-star rating from me. \"This is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.\" Indeed, I can see why!",

    "text": "Three of us came here for Christmas dinner. One got the chefs tasting menu, another got the vegan tasting menu. I got the Christmas pre fixe menu. First we get cocktails and I love how nicely labeled their wine and cocktail list are! Very organized so if you're in for a little bit of sweet, refreshing, dry... whatever your taste there is a category of their specials in there. I got the cotton candy drink and although it seems really cool they bring it out in a glass with a big pink cotton candy inside, once they put the drink on top of it that cotton candy dissolves completely. I thought it was ok but once you get to the bottom it just became too sweet. The oyster was probably the best thing I ate here. It was so delicious! I just had a problem With how long my food took from appetizer to the main meal. My other two guests were eating frequently and I was left waiting to eat my main entree with them. Then my dessert and others at my table had their dessert come so late. 2.5 hours later... I felt the food came out way too slow. The service was great but man... I surely wished that night I stuck with the chefs tasting menu like the other two at my table. It was seriously the longest dinner I have ever had in Vegas.",

    "text": "By many standards an unlikely \"Celebrity Chef\" restaurant for Las Vegas, McClain making a name for himself at Spring and Green Zebra in Chicago before opening the first of what has since become a total of three Casino restaurants spanning two properties, Sage was originally opened alongside Bar Masa as one of Aria's crown jewels, the 'farm to table' concept outlasting Michael Mina's American Fish and Serio Italian with its neighbor rumored soon to close, as well.  Without a doubt one of the city's most striking rooms, a high-ceilinged lounge with enormous murals and an immense Bar found just beyond Wine racks en route to the first of two dining rooms featuring shades of purple and spot lighting with dramatic pockets of darkness in-between, diners sitting down to dinner at Sage will find themselves offered one of several banquets or tables with plenty of padding and dark wood, the music overhead creating a pulse though occasionally too loud throughout the evening.  Served in a team-style similar to many of Las Vegas' larger restaurants, the runners well-educated and more than capable of presenting a plate with ample description of ingredients and technique involved, it was with Carte Blanche given to the kitchen that the meal began with a small glass of Champagne, the amuse to follow not dissimilar to Jean George Steakhouse's Egg and Brioche with Caviar and traditional Condiments packed into a neat Sandwich from just a few weeks prior.  Halfway between a 'small plates' concept and one where each diner is encouraged to order her or his own three-course meal, the offering of a Bar Menu as well as Vegan, Vegetarian, Seasonal and Chef's Tasting menus providing a wide variety of dining styles to accommodate several tastes, timeframes and budgets, it was with two styles of Bread plus good Butter and Sea Salt that dinner progressed into individually plated Ora King Salmon slicked in Olive Oil with Citrus, Salmon Roe and Herbs, the flavors far too 'fishy' for one at the table while the textures were smooth and luxurious with plenty of balance in the eyes of the others.  Moving next to a round of shared Salads, two signature and the other seasonal, it was again with raw Fish dissuading one guest that this round exemplified what diners can expect from Sage as a whole, each plate presenting a bold compellation of ingredients whose flavors and textures complement one another without anything seeming out of place or unnecessary, the smoked Coconut and Ginger giving Hamachi a Thai-tinge while both the roasted Carrots and crispy Pig Skins as well as the Heirloom Tomato Salad with curls of Ham and briny Feta in Black Garlic confidently presented protein as a garnish with light sweetness helping to tie everything on the plate together.  Next offering an off-menu Salt Cod Croquette with bright spices and a bit of cooling aioli, though the placing proved to be a bit strange with several delicate courses to follow, it was here that Chef Heisinger sent forth two Sage-classics that predate his arrival, the aged-Wagyu Tartare using a Chocolate Tuille to perfume raw Beef in a subtle manner similar to the Cocoa Nibs found in caramelized Foie Gras Custard, without a doubt one of Sin City's True 'destination' dishes and nearly matched by the tasting menu's shellacked Torchon with rounds of Brioche and 3 tastes of Blueberries.  Individually pouring three-bowls of umami-rich Bisque next, the broth forgivingly light and thus allowing the flavors of Lemongrass and aromatic oils to highlight a snappy Langoustine and raw slices of Beech Mushroom, it was with a quartet of entrees served family style that savories came to a conclusion, the Black Bass moist and flaky beneath crispy Skin that played well off seasonal Vegetables in an almost Curry-like bath while the Lamb and Veal Cheeks each put a bit of heat in the mix to help balance the fat, the former doing so with Peppers amidst the Peas while the latter hinted toward cooler weather ahead with Paprika Jus and Dumplings in a hearty Stew.  Savoring the Iberico Pork until the end, a smoky Sauce beautifully matching tender flesh to sweet Apricots, Pepitas and toasted Kale, it was with an $8 Double Espresso that the palate was cleared in preparation for Dessert, the \"Raspberry Soda\" prepared tableside light but a bit too \"Marshmallow Salad\" in terms of its texture while the tasting menu's Baba did justice to the French classic with Rhubarb predictably complimenting Strawberries despite the fact that the \"Elderflower\" Bavaroise was fairly underflavored.  At this point fairly full, but unable to resist requesting one last dish that has been garnering acclaim ever since it was added to the menu, it was with last bites of the deconstructed Black Forrest Torte finished that Mr. Grates presented the Foie Gras Candy Bar, a good choice for those who do not want something 'too sweet' at meal's end and truly exemplary in its ability to both highlight and harness liver's unctuousness.",

The menu markets this restaurant as \"farm to table\" but to be honest with you it wasn't fresh or local ingredients from farms... blah! We started with the :   1/2 DOZEN KUSSHI OYSTERS Tabasco Sorbet / Tequila Mignonette which I thought would have a unique spicy flavor but no, had to ask for some horseradish and chili flakes.  Then had the cheese board, only 1 cheese was decent the others were too soft. I don't mind soft cheese but at least puts some variety on there.  Ordered the sea scallops which were full of oil and butter, had to send them back... the only thing this place has going for them is their customer service. The GM circled the floor multiple times and was attentive to the customers. But still, for the money there are others restaurants.",

The restaurant was such a casual vibe with an upscale taste. To start off, we were served with 2 kinds of freshly baked bread. We then ordered the foie gras brulee which was absolutely amazing!!! I would def go back for that! I then ordered the wagyu hanger steak. It melted in my mouth like butter. We also ordered the absinthe. It was such a cool presentation. You had to inhale the smoke and drink the absinthe. For dessert, we tried a variety from the foie gras candy bar which reminded me of a snicker. I wasn't a fan of the popcorn it came with tho. Black forest torte was good but a lil too much chocolate for me. But I really enjoyed the passion fruit sabayon mousse. It was refreshing. Overall, I had an amazing time. I would go back!! :) also don't forget to try their cab! It was so good.",

I was actually on my way to another restaurant when I came across the banner promo for restaurants in Aria.  Saw the scallops dish and was sold.  Got to Sage and decided to hang out at the bar.  The bartenders were friendly and attentive.  Looking over the menu, I noticed that the scallops were served with oxtail - which I have not seen before so solidified my decision to get it.  The dish was served pretty quickly after placing my order and the scallops were fresh and cooked to perfection.  The oxtail was indeed a nice touch, a tad on the salty side but balanced out when paired with the scallops and mushrooms.  Great ambience as well.  Would return if I'm ever back in town!",

    "text": "For months, I've heard amazing things about Sage and was planning the dinner I would have in my head.  But when I got there, I made a last minute change.  Instead of the tasting menu, I went with the Oysters with Tobasco sorbet to start and Kobe Skirt Steak for my entree.   Plus, I knew I could count on my dining companion to go with the Signature Tasting Menu.  This was an experience! Our waiter informed us that it required 2 1/2 hours and he wasn't kidding.  If you have the time, this is the way to do Sage right.  Also did the beer pairing for $39 and every course was complemented by a unique beer.  Naturally, I tried everything!  The standout courses were the rabbit (I'm sorry Bugs Bunny.  I had no idea you taste so good!!) and the 48 hour beef belly.  Have tried pork belly several times and this was such a cool dish.  Definitely less fatty than pork, but melted in your mouth.  Truly incredible.  As for my food - - those oysters were phenomenal.  I was worried the tobasco sorbet would overwhelm the oyster but my worries were for naught.  I may go back soon just to have a few martinis and these oysters that's how much I loved these!  The Kobe skirt steak was also fantastic.  Cooked perfectly and nicely paired with grilled brussel sprouts, a little spinach and these things that looked like tater tots until you cut into them and discovered what Sage calls potato puree (call a spade a spade - it's mashed potatoes people).  One of my favorite parts was the country bacon bread roll with Sage's homemade butter and sea salt.  I had two of these suckers and I almost always skip bread.  Unfortunately, I ate them so fast I didn't take a photo.  Service was flawless and the dining room is so sexy.  Can't say enough great things about this place.  Wonderful!  Also cool - the after-dinner drinks include several types of Absinthe.  I would never drink that crap but enjoyed watching a few couples around me order it!",

We ordered the 2 course tasting.... my husband didn't understand why we couldn't just get four things and share them all (his point is somewhat valid) but they didn't let us. I started with a kale salad and then got the scallops. He had the filet and the octupus. LOVED the octupus and the scallops so I would think they just do seafood really well... the scallops and boar were just phenomenally cooked. They melted in your mouth!  If we are ever in Vegas again, we would definitely visit again.",

    "text": "Sage was the scene for our \"rehearsal\" dinner with family and friends who'd journeyed out to Las Vegas for Carol W and my wedding.  A month prior to our arrival, I'd called Sage to make reservations for a large party of 15-16 people.  I was very surprised when the person I spoke with at Sage was so nonchalant (in a good way) about my request, not asking for a credit card number to hold the reservation, just saying, \"We'll see you on Jan 10th.\"  The only contact I received from the restaurant was a confirmation call made to me the day of a few hours before our reservation time.  Sage was picked for this momentous occasion because we'd both eaten and had drinks there on a couple of previous trips to LV and had been suitably impressed by its contemporary American cuisine and killer cocktails.  More importantly, our party consisted of diners of varying levels of sophistication and adventurousness, but we knew that Sage had accessible food that virtually anyone could find something they would eat and enjoy.  This time was no different and, in fact, was its best showing to date.  Our party of 15 arrived a few minutes prior to our 7:30pm reservations.  We were seated at a long table at the back of the restaurant partially sectioned off from the main dining room.  I don't know if Sage has private dining rooms, but our table worked perfectly for us as the noise level from the full house of diners never rose above average to intrude on our meal.  Given the diverse tastes of our party and our planned budget, we opted for the Signature Tasting Menu (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sage-las-vegas-2?select=iYda89NQBM3fTPcNBQzBeg#iYda89NQBM3fTPcNBQzBeg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sage...</a>) Without getting into specifics for each course as every item on the tasting menu was ordered by someone at our table, everyone pushed back from the table satisfied and pleased with what they had received.  However, the Foie Gras Brulee, the Grilled Spanish Octopus, 48 Hour Beef Belly, and both dessert selections seemed to receive the highest praise.  Our lead server, Lauren, did an amazing job synchronizing her team in keeping everyone's order straight; delivering our food simultaneously; keeping the water, wine, and cocktails flowing; and even coordinating with the kitchen to accommodate two of our party's special requests to substitute items on menu.  It was an exemplary performance by the kitchen, service staff, and sommelier.  Sage delivered everything we had hoped for and more in a special occasion meal!  I recommend Sage 100 percent for your special occasion, especially if you're celebrating it with a large group.",

    "text": "Our second stop during Restaurant Week, and so far, so good. Sage is a pretty pricey place, so it was nice to visit at a \"reduced\" rate. (We still dropped $400 for four people...) And if you're the type of person who \"eats with their eyes first,\" this is the place for you.  My husband and I dined with another couple, and we oddly ended up with different permutations of the same four selections: (1a) melon salad with pickled pork belly or (1b) chilled corn soup with crab for the appetizer, and (2a) smoked black cod or (2b) braised beef belly for the entree. I had the melon salad and the black cod. Both were delicious and visually stunning, although a little small on the portion size (as expected). I didn't try the soup, which both our friends ordered (and loved), but I had a bite of my husband's beef belly and that was my favorite bite of the night. (If the best beef rib you've ever had mated with a slab of pork belly, this would be their love child.)  Each meal came with a chocolate and Earl Grey panna cotta for dessert. Like the earlier dishes, it was a visual stunner. We all ordered the wine pairings as well, and the sherry that accompanied this dish was spot on. I usually am not a big fan of desserts (or sherry), but this was truly a standout -- especially with the perfect wine selection.  As mentioned, the beef belly and the panna cotta (with wine accompaniment) were the stars of this meal, but I have to give props to the DELICIOUS bacon-flecked rolls. Not sure if these are always on the menu, but they should be! I practiced self control and only had one, but I could eat a dozen of these things.  Our server was great: attentive but unobtrusive. And the ambiance is lovely, with music and conversation at just the right volume. But what I'll remember most about Sage is the attention to detail and creativity in the plating -- that and the bacon rolls!",

Found Sage on Yelp and thought we would give it a try.  Pretty impressive menu and wine list... We opted for the full tasting menu including the wine pairings.  I would give the overall food a 10 out of 10, the wine pairings a 9 out if 10, the wine quality for such a great experience a 7 out if 10.   Favorites of the night by all three of us were crab / yellowtail crudo, foie grois, quail, strip loin, and raspberry mousse.  We were split on pork terrine and crispy tail, mini terrarium and all three were less than impressed with salmon belly.  Posted pics of each course.  Great night out, took about 2.5 hours ... Would do it again but maybe order a good bottle!  Highly rate!",

    "text": "The food is good here; however, the service was not that great.  It is a little noisy in the restaurant and food runners/servers do not explain the dishes very well (if you can actually hear what they are saying).  They simple just drop and run, the same goes for the wine pairings.  especially when it comes to explaining the wines, the servers seem pretty lazy.  On the plus side, the food is great.  We had the four course signature menus.   For the first course we had the Kyushu oysters and the wagyu beef tartare.  The kumamotos were sweet yet salty.  The tequila mignonette added acid and the tabasco sorbet balanced the dish with some spice.  Can't really go wrong with these types of oysters as they are really easy to eat.  The tartare was also very good.  The wagyu beef is so rich and buttery, mixed with the poached egg there is just a nice creamy texture.  Second course we had the Grilled Spanish Octopus and the Maine Dayboat Scallops.  The octopus was not what I was picturing in my mind.  The octopus was very soft and not chewy at all.  The day boats were great but nothing really special.  We also ordered the roasted veal sweetbreads. Although this dish is a little greasy, the sweetbreads were very creamy.    For our main course we had the 48 hour Beef Belly and the Australian Wagyu Sirloin.  The Wagyu as usual was soft, buttery, and delicious.  Although for the portion size I don't think it is worth the $15 up charge.  The beef belly was also very soft and flavorful.    As for dessert, I did not really care much for the lemon pie or the panna cotta.  I did not understand the combination of burnt marshmallows with pistachio ice cream and a overly sour lemon pie.  The panna cotta dish did not have any texture, it was basically a bowl full of soft ice cream/custard.  I think you are better off substituting your dessert for an app or something else.",

The restaurant is classy and beautiful with plenty of quite and intimate space. Our server was attentive, but overbearing at certain points.

I started off with a chilled sweet corn soup while the other party opted for a fresh vegetable medley. I absolutely devoured my soup, it was perfect. Her veggies were completely unoriginal, they tasted fresh, but that is about it. There was no interesting spin or vinaigrette to accompany the meal. As my entree I opted for the Pacific Yellowtail Kampachi with chanterelle mushrooms, bacon, manila clams and black grapes. The fish was not cooked evenly, but the overall flavors worked superbly together. The other party opted for the flat iron steak which ended up being $10 extra on top of the tasting menu price. It was a generous serving of protein that was cooked perfectly.  The final course was the dessert, and that was heavenly. It was a caramelized pineapple mousse with all sorts of other goodies added to it. To acknowledge her birthday, it came with a single candle that I though was a nice touch. Overall it was an enjoyable, yet not a mind blowing meal. Especially for $250 with tip.",

    "text": "My wife and I came here with some friends on a random wednesday night for dinner. My wife and I had the following:  LITTLE GEM SALAD smoked trout / everything bagel spice / spanish ham  BLACK BASS baby artichoke / bacon vinaigrette / barigoule sauce  ROASTED VEAL SWEETBREADS glazed bacon / creamy white polenta / trumpet mushroom   CHESTNUT SOUP crispy pork belly / sweet onion foam  My wife had the first 2 dishes and I had the last 2 dishes. I tried them and they were good. The salad was actually a big portion and could've easily been split for 2 people. The bass was good. I especially liked that barigoule sauce with the bacon vinaigrette. I never had sweetbreads in my life so I had to order it. They had the texture of marshmallow with some meaty flavor, quite tasty. The chestnut soup was quite filling and I liked mixing the soup with the onion foam on top. Ironically, I didn't believe none of the dishes were as good as my friends' Foie Brulee. If you've never been to Sage, get the Foie Brulee foreals!! It was sweet, salty, meat butter heaven. Next time I should bring more bread or something cause that is heaven in a bowl. Don't ask how many calories though...lol Overall, we enjoyed our dinner. I liked the purple themed ambience and the service was top notch. And did I mention the free bacon bread? :P",

    "text": "Last year (2015) my wife discovered Sage and we went for our wedding anniversary and were totally impressed with both the food and the service. With our past experience in mind we decided to make a return visit this year on our annual Vegas trip.   So having spent time in the restaurant industry I hate when people are late for their reservation as it can thrown your seat plans for the service period off. With this I mind I am usually at a restaurant at least 10 minutes early, as was the case this year. Given that we were early I didn't think anything of it when the hostess suggested we take a seat at the bar and the would come get us, again no big deal. The bar tender was both polite and friendly, got us our drinks. My wife asked me if they had forgotten about us as she had noticed several table being seated. Eventually a different hostess come and offer to take us to our table, its 15 minutes after our reservation time and 25 minutes after we have arrived. Again no biggie we are on vacation and we had a drink at the bar.   We opted for the chef tasting menu, we had had this last year also and it was out standing. Our waiter was extremely friendly and everything was flowing along, each course came and went at a wonderful pace. We were between courses and I had just noticed that the pace was off, more of a mental observation than anything, I hadn't even mentioned it to my wife when a manager appears at the table. He proceed to explain that there had been some kind of issue in the kitchen, he was very sorry for the delay and that the were taking 50% off of my wife's dinner to make up for it.   Our waiter was extremely embarrassed by the whole event and to be honest we weren't upset but if your going to take $80 off my bill that's fine by me :-)   Over all everything was good but it just didn't have that WOW factor we had experienced last year. From the moment we arrived everything was so, so. Will we go back and try again, probably but it we miss it the next time we are in Vegas I won't be put out.    Maybe they were having a bad day, we all have them, but it a restaurant market that is so competitive you just can't have days like that.",

There's a struggle that people misunderstand: flavor. Sage, to me, by no means intended in being a restaurant that made food with flavors no one's tasted before. Rather, Sage showed me that flavor exists in food we are used to tasting as bland and mediocre.  Go to Sage. Eat at Sage. Experience it.",

Everything was brought to us before we had a chance to ask for it. It was like they read our minds. It was such a classy establishment that a staff member walked me to the restroom to open the door every time I went. and it was 3 times....had a lot to drink =)    Ambiance- Just like everything else in the Aria hotel, it's very modern an chic.   Food- It was innovative and had combination of flavors I had never even thought of.  For starters, we had refreshing market oysters that came with a tabasco sorbet. I HIGHLY recommend ordering the SLOW-POACHED ORGANIC FARM EGG. A one of a kind dish,  it came with truffles, smoked potato and toasted country bread. I was also very satisfied with my entree. I ordered the fluke, which was cooked to perfection. It was served with sweet pear and sauteed spinach. The pear and fluke worked wonders on my taste buds =)   Just as I thought my dinner couldn't get any better, my bf ordered dessert: Panna Cotta adorned with candied kumquats and fresh grapefruit. TO DIE FOR!!   I can't complain about anything here! Although it is on the pricey side, it's well worth your Benjamins baby!",

I took my wife there for her birthday and it was a memorabe experience.  I had the chef tasting menu, while my wife ordered an appetizer and an entree.  She said the truffled egg was one of the best things she has ever eaten.  The tasting menu was also exceptional!  The service was outstanding and never missed a beat.

While there was nothing wrong with my pear salad all the way through to the final course of Wagu-style beef, there was nothing remarkable about any of the dishes we ordered. The scallop was good. Although, my husband's octopus was tough. The best part of our meal was the bread & butter, attentive service including the sommelier and our wine selection. $500 for two persons, one would hope that at least one of the eight dishes served to the both of us (we chose different selections from the tasting menu) would be memorable.

Since id been talking about Sage for weeks, I took the liberty of ordering all dishes for us that night...and wow, did we do good.  The Bison carpaccio was phenomenal!  One plate wasn't enough, but we had five plates to try and neither disappointed.  My favorite app of all has to be the foie gras creme brule.  Its no what you expect, it's better.  From apps we went straight to dessert.  Another yummy adventure and fusion of different flavors I wouldn't think of putting together.  Pistachio tres leches with rhubarb was tasty.   The pieces of rhubard kept us guessing for a while.  I thought they were chopper tomatos.  Lol.  As much as the food is amazing, the drinks are just as amazing. I recommend the Moscow Mule for all vodka drinkers out there.  The best I can say: we had a wonderful night of fabulous food, drink, and wonderful company.  It was the perfect way to start a night at Aria.",

Wagyu Beef Tartare is what we started with for our early valentines day meal.  Very good starter, served with crispy sourdough toast.  Finished the plate clean.  Butter they serve with their bread course was to die for.  Whipped to perfection and served with sea salt on the side.  The taste was that of a light french onion dip on bread.   Entree's we had were American Kobe Skirt Steak and Bacon-Wrapped Pork Loin.  Steak cooked perfectly (as recommended by our server John F.) and Pork Loin was amazingly tender.  My favorite thing on the Pork Loin dish was the Smoked Apple Puree.  Definitely a must with every single bite.   Dessert was small in size but huge in flavor.  Purple Sweet Potato Pie, on top of a burnt marshmallow with what seamed like rice krispies and angostura bitters ice cream.  By far the best thing of the night.  Perfect for that person who \"doesn't do dessert\" but wants something sweet after a meal.    Service was what you expect from a fine dining place.  A million different people clearing your plates and serving your water.  Our server John F.  was very informative when we asked our questions.  It was a slow night so kind of expected a little faster service, but overall a great experience and a great meal.",

The salt roasted beets salad looked and tasted like it had been sitting on a counter for some time - the flavors were completely indistinguishable. We felt like we were eating airplane food.  Our server took so long to bring us the menu that we had to ask two different people for it before it arrived. The space itself is lovely, but in Vegas that's not really a draw as most restaurants on the strip are well designed.  Will not be returning or recommending.",

Our group of 9 checked in 5 minutes early for an 8PM reservation, we had to wait at the bar for well over 30 minutes.  During that time, no one asked for our drink order so I went to the bar and ordered cocktails for everyone.  Once the bartender was done, he pushed them forward on the bar - yelling to me \"they're ready\".  Are you kidding me?!  At $13/cocktail there is no way I'm bussing them myself.  Once our table was ready, no one made any effort to help us carry the drinks over, so 3 of us juggled laptop bags, purses and drinks to the table.  Food was overly salted and not very tasty. The gnocchi which I iloved last time was smothered in a blue cheese-ish sauce which was not good.  The tuna tartare did not taste particularly fresh.  All in all, an expensive disappointment.  We did however have a wonderful lunch at Julian Serrano's tapa place the following day.",

    "text": "I would rate this between 3 3/4 stars to 4 stars.  I have been here twice and if you are looking for a restaurant in Aria, you can't go wrong with this restaurant.  The restaurant is spacious and modern with a purple theme.  I liked the decor and is appropriate for a fine dining restaurant inside a higher end hotel on the strip.  The service is generally good (service was better during my first visit) and friendly with hosts and hostesses that seem to care.  I ordered the signature tasting menu once and just had the maine dayboat scallops the other time (the chef tasting menu requires everyone at the table to order).  The signature tasting menu doesn't change a whole lot, but there are substitutions from time to time.  The proportions are good but those with bigger appetites might clean every plate and still feel like they can eat more.  The food tends towards rich, flavorful, but salty.  Maybe it was due to my choices, but going with wagyu beef tartar (very rich and oily), maine dayboat scallops (served in a rich brown sauce), and 48 hour beef belly (need I say more?) meant I was having a very rich meal.  The beef tartar could pass as an entree.  it was rich, oily, but very good.  The scallops, accompanied by mushrooms, were cooked perfectly and aremy favourite.  The beef belly melts in your mouth.  I have tried both the wine pairing and the beer pairing.  The beer pairing was interesting to me and it was a lot of beer.  For $44 extra? It's a good deal in Vegas.  The wine pairings didn't always work but it didn't clash with the food and the proportions were fair.  I was surprised they didn't have a wine pairing for the 4th course which is the dessert.  Seems a bit stupid to offer wine pairings with their tasting menus and not finish it off with something to accompany the dessert.  Charge more if you have to.   My wine glass also happened to be dirty (if they were clean they weren't crystal clear) and exchanging it didn't really help.  I think they wipe their glasses with linen cloths that sheds.   Overall, I liked the restaurant and will probably return the next time I return to Aria.  I think it would be better if there was a lighter fare choice on the tasting menu such as fish. Right now, the second course is either bacon wrapped rabbit saddle or scallops, while the 3rd course is either pork loin, beef belly, or wagyu sirloin.  I don't think Sage is marketed as a steakhouse.",

    "text": "Service: 4 stars - Professional, but most staff were not particularly warm and friendly. Bonus for replacing the cocktail I ordered and could not stand with a different option with charge or hassle. But the service was generally slow. We sat with our empty dessert dish for 10 minutes and then after someone took that way, with our empty table for another 10 minutes before our waiter checked in with us and we could ask for the check.   Ambiance: 4 stars - Generally aesthetically pleasing but a few small issues. One - while the place was not very noisy, the acoustics were such that I had a hard time hearing the person across the table from me. Two - The couches might be a nice look, but I don't want my seat to move when someone else seated at another table has to adjust  their seat unaware that the couch is not stationary.   Food: 4.5 stars - Bread and drinks - My husband asked for a good beer pairing with his duck entree was pleased with the result. I tried the Smoking Bulleit and could not stand it, but quite liked the flavor combinations in the Jack Snap. A gentlemen came by occasionally offering us fresh country bacon rolls or sourdough rolls served with a butter with a mild lavender flavor and Australian sea salt. Pretentious. But at least the lavender was very mild and the sea salt was delicious - we also used it to enhance the tartare dish (see below).   1st course - We had the wylie beef tartare and the sweet onion and truffle soup. The soup was creamy with good flavors and wonderful presentation. The tartare was AMAZING and the best thing we ate.   Main course - My husband had the duck which was perfectly executed, but did not blow him away. I had the chicken with a truffle ravioli and artichoke. The artichokes were overly citrusy and the ravioli just wasn't very flavorful. However, the chicken was perfectly cooked and the sauce had a good flavor.   Dessert - We had something involving a blackberry mouse and dark chocolate. The portion was...miniscule - 4 bites. The presentation was nice, and the flavors were alright but nothing divine.   Price: 3 stars - Overly pricey. The food was well perfectly prepared and the service was professional, but slow. However, for that price, I expect unique dishes, amazing flavor combinations, and superb service. The place is pricier and inferior to Mesa Grill at Ceasar's Palace. However, if you get the early dinner prix fix or the signature prix fix then it would be more reasonable.",

    "text": "This was probably one of the best meals I've had, ever. That's saying alot because... I eat... alot.   We did the special prix fixe that was about ~$130 that included 9 courses (the chef even sent us over complimentary oysters to start). One of the dishes that stood out the most was the Foie Gras Brulee with a toasted Brioche bun. [photo: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog?select=ubSUjOIu_riQpizPG9SYDg%5D\">yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU...</a> I'm familiar with foie gras but I've never had it quite prepared like this. The other courses were just as good and included scallops in a chowder, rabbit loin wrapped in bacon along with a pate/meatloaf of the innards, 36hr braised beef. And normally I'm not huge on deserts because I'm not a fan overly sweet deserts and chocolates, but Sage had one of the best if not the best desert I've ever had. It was perfectly balanced between sweetness/acidity/tangy goodness. It was something like a White Chocolate Mousse with Passion fruit and Boysenberries and some other stuff. [photo: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog?select=niFRvZwF-TyZIipUKkOySQ%5D\">yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU...</a> We ended up ordering coffee, and it came out in a french press which is always a win, but soon regretted that decision when we realized the chef wasn't done quite yet, he also sent out some rosemary hot chocolate and chocolate truffles. Perfect way to end an already spectacular dinner.  Sage also has a pretty nice wine list and unique cocktails. We got two bottles from Amarone (which my friend suggested because she had it a couple times and loved it but couldn't find it much anywhere... but they were $250 a bottle! ha..... ouch.) I also ordered a jack snap from the cocktail menu, which was jack honey with ginger ale citrus and some other things, either way it was so good.  Our server was 'fabulous' if you catch my drift, but he was pretty entertaining and constantly came over to check on us. He was a pretty funny guy, so I'm not complaining. I swear to god the bussers came over almost instantly and they even came over and folded the napkins back up when people left the table. SUPER ATTENTION to detail. Overall, a great experience and I would definitely recommend it if you're out in Vegas and don't mind spending a few extra bucks.",

We had an outstanding dinner and a very attentive, knowledgable, entertaining waiter. We both opted for Chef McClains signature menu. At $79.00 a person you are able to experience the wonderful talents of the chef, through four delicious courses. No need to discuss each one, they were all equally delightful. If you have one night to do something special, I would recommend a visit to Sage.",

    "text": "All I can say it WOW I do not fit in this place. I came to this restaurants rocking vans and a jacket and I just felt so uncomfortable and out of place. This was my first \"fine dining\" experience. I never really cared for this kind of stuff because food is food to me. I am not picky. I came here with some friends, we are all teens but they still provided great service (some restaurants avoid providing good service to teens because they assume they won't tip anyways). The first question that comes up when you arrive is \"What type of water would you guys like?\" Then they name a list. My friend was a newbie and she told him \"Fiji\" is fine. I was like \"holy crap do you know what you just did?\" LOL! anyways they came with our \"Fiji\" water then when the bottle was empty they asked if we would like more and unfortunately, someone said \"yes\" and they opened another bottle of Fiji. I asked my friends how much do they think the Fiji water would cost. They said \"it can't be that much maybe $4, $5 at the most.\" When the check came we were charged $9 per Fiji bottle opened. So... $18 alone went to ordering water (which I enjoyed by the way). I am not cheap but $18 dollars for water was kind of pushing it.   *They served us this bread. It was decent. There is a man that comes around to offer you more ( I guess it is unlimited) but being at a restaurant like this we rejected more bread because we didn't wanna look like fatasses. But god knows we wanted more lol! *For dessert the chef gave us this free sample of chocolate milk. I cant use words to describe this. It was beyond good but you can tell it was super fattening even though it was just a shot. *They gave us this free thing that hey called \"Salad\" What was it? One TINY spoonful of mystery white fluid.  *For my main entree I ordered this fish clam chowder thing. It came with slices of potatoes (maybe 3 pieces). There were like 4-5 small pieces of fish and a really thin layer of clam chowder sauce. It was probably the best thing I've tasted in a long time but the proportion was horrible. I think it was about $38 and trust me, it does not satisfy.  It would have gotten 5 stars but it was way too expensive for the proportion provided. But I guess this is how fine dining is supposed to be. Our bill for 4 people came out to be about $220. Yeah, the Fiji water screwed us hard.",

    "text": "Hubby and I were staying at The Aria, a hotel so high-end that are no schlocky snack-bar nor fast-food joints to be found ANYWHERE.  Any random restaurant at the Aria is bound to be good, but Sage is a veritable gem. Hubby and I love food, and frequent many terrific establishments, but Sage presented us with the most exquisite dining experience we've enjoyed in many a year.   The many four and five-star reviews by my fellow Yelp-ers helped \"seal the deal\" for going to Sage our last night in Vegas. We thank you!  I wish I could explain what it is that makes Sage so superlatively great. The best I can is to say that there is a way the food makes you \"feel\". The sensual deliciousness of the flavors, the freshness of the ingredients, the skill and care of the preparations, the elegance of the setting, the artistry of the presentation and  the grace of the staff all come together to elevate the meal into something quite marvelous and magical. This is everything fine dining is supposed to be, but hardly ever is... Hubby and Ioved the Kusshi Oyster appetizer, six tiny gems that made us feel like a million bucks (oysters are supposed to be an aphrodiasiac, but I cant remember the last time an oyster, tasty as they are, made me \"feel\" anything!) Hubby had the pork loin, which was succulent, and the second preparation of a pork canneloni was both luscious and surprising.  I had the scallops, which were enormous and perfectly cooked,seared on the outside and creamy-almost custardy-in the center; simply exquisite. We were too stuffed for dessert, but the complimentary hot chocolate shot was smooth like pudding,and  the perfect end to this amazing meal.  We would return to Sage in a heartbeat, and recommend the place to anyone going to Las Vegas.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed my meal at Sage.  I didn't know much about the restaurant or Shawn McClain, but Sage surprised me.  The entrance to the restaurant doesn't do justice to what is inside. It wasn't as striking as a high-end restaurant in Vegas would demand.  It is located across from Serrano, and from the outside it doesn't look like anything special. However, the decor is actually quite hip and elegant with dark rich colors. I thought service here was exemplary.  Our waiter was great. So much so that we personally commended him to the manager.  One of the food runners even walked me all the way to the ladies room when I asked where it was located. As for the food, the emphasis is on local seasonal ingredients.  I enjoyed my gnocchi with winter vegetables, such as winter squash.  For my main, I really liked the barramundi.  The fish was really well cooked and well seasoned. The sauce was also excellent.  I wanted to lick my plate.  It is rare that I enjoy an entree as much as I do an appetizer.  Desserts were also good and they even brought out a free chocolate rich dessert with a candle for my boyfriend's birthday (without me even telling them to!), The wine list has something for everyone.  My boyfriend and I ordered a half bottle of a zinfandel cabernet bland from a winery in Napa that he visited.  But, the real end to the evening here is the absinthe.  I was hesitant as absinthe caused my drunkest night ever.  It is more than 12 years later from that night in Salamanca as a 16-year old, but my body still feels it.  My friends say this explains my craziness from the hallucogenic effects. Note to everyone: it is a very bad idea to have a shot drinking contest  with absinthe against someone twice your size. Anyway....the absinthe is still strong.  But it was cool to see them light it on fire and bring it the table.  My boyfriend ordered a Swiss rather than Spanish absinthe as to avoid my memories of Salamanca.  Even when it was served with orange juice, it still packed a whopper of a punch.  All in all, the absinthe couldn't save the kind of lame Cirque Elvis show that night, but it did set the tone for one of my wildest nights in Vegas. Drink up!",

From start to finish, myself, and my table of 8 was amazed at what was put down in front of us - I'm so sad that we don't live closer (although, my pocketbook probably isn't).  Started with the amuse bouche -- ours was a vegetarian bite of artichoke, eggplant caviar among other flavors.  perfectly balanced start to the meal.  We had an option between bacon or olive/asiago rolls -- I'm pescatarian and so went for the olive/asiago - delicious.  Next I split the green garlic soup and the lobster angliotti with a friend.  Both featured fresh seafood (crab in the soup) that was incredibly tender - cooked perfectly.    I had the spring gnocci for my entree (w/ fresh peas and mint).  I've never had such delicate gnocci - it literally melted in my mouth.    I sampled almost all of the desserts, but I think the most memorable for me was the toffee pudding with white pepper ice cream -- equally unique and tasty.  On top of all of the great food we had, the service was outstanding.  We laughed a lot, weren't rushed and felt well taken care of.  A must stop for foodies in Vegas!",

Service was prompt and well rehearsed . We never went without drink nor were we pushed to clear out. We all ordered a la carte but considered the two tasting menus available. I split mine with a colleague as neither of us could choose between the scallops or pork tenderloin. Both ended up being fantastic. The scallops perfectly seared  on the outside without the dry/rubbery center. The pork tenderloin served with spaetzle (my favorite) and crispy pork shoulder was just as successful a dish. in fact I think I actually liked the crispy pork shoulder better but I do not think it could be a main.",

It was not cheap but the tastes were unique and we felt like splurging for our special meal during our Vegas trip. We come to Vegas to take in the shows and eat, as we are not gamblers. When we got there on time for our early evening reservation I was disappointed we were seated by the bar area instead of in the back with most of the other diners. The ambiance from that location was not quite there. Nevertheless the food made up for it, as each course was excellent. My wife and I especially enjoyed the scallops in ox-tail sauce. I am taking off 1 star for the service. What kept this meal experience from being extraordinary was the aloofness of our server. He started off the evening on the wrong foot by being over assertive in his correction of my misinterpretation of the menu. Let's just say he was a bit jarring and awkward in his interaction when a light touch would have sufficed. During the rest of the meal I felt service was prompt and adequate, but never once did anyone inquire about how we were enjoying the food. It felt somewhat like an assembly line process. I understand it's Vegas and Sage is a high-volume restaurant, not an undiscovered gem. Still one should never be reminded of this. Would we eat here again? Maybe to try the Chef's tasting menu. But next time I would be asked to seat in the back room instead of by the bar. And I would cross my fingers for more personal service.",

    "text": "Wow!  My fiance and I were staying at Aria and wanted a nice restaurant to go to that was close to home.  Sage, is where we ultimately landed and we could not be happier.    Now, the important stuff, first the service was amazing, very attentive and extremely knowledgeable in everything involved throughout the night.  The food: I cannot begin to tell you how pleased we were with the quality, flavors, selections.  We ordered the grilled spanish octopus for an appetizer, it was unbelievable how tender and tasty the meat was, first time having octopus outside of sushi and I cannot imagine every having it again anywhere else.  My fiance's Maine day boat scallops?  wow!  I'm from New England and I have never tasted such perfectly cooked scallops!  And at end of the night I had my first ever taste of absinthe which I recommend to anyone, first as a digestive aid(per our waiter and very accurate after eating all that amazing food) and secondly as just a really memorable experience as the process of actually creating the absinthe is indicative of the whole night of challenging the senses at Sage!",

    "text": "Read the Chowhound reviews extensively and all signs pointed to trying Sage; but ultimately I don't think I ordered the right dishes to make this an above-three star experience. It is a beautiful space with plush decor and high ceilings located at the Aria hotel and casino.  The experience for me was more of a push-the-envelope foodie dining experience.  I read their cocktails were really good so got the Sidecar, which was good but a little pricey for what I got (I've had better). For dinner, had the early evening menu and went with the squash and pear soup, organic chicken, and passion fruit mousse with huckleberries.  Food was very good, nothing out of this world mind blowing; but maybe that is because I didn't order off the full menu.  My husband got the Foie Gras creme brulee and brioche which was out of this world fantastic.  He also got the skirt steak which was pretty amazing.  Next time I think I will order off the full menu; I think that is what this experience is telling me.",

I was seated in a lovely semi-private alcove, so I was able to take photos (non-flash) without disturbing anyone.  Had the 6 course tasting menu, and was able to substitute a yummy cavatelli with ricotta, duck confit, swiss chard and pickled turnips for the rabbit dish listed on the menu.  Loved their bacon roll!  Started with a lovely hamachi with blood orange, radish and caviar--very light and refreshing.  I finally had Sage's most amazing signature dish:  the foie gras brulee with brioche.  This was the single best dish of the entire trip!  This was followed by a lovely scallop dish in a cream based clam chowder.  The scallop was wrapped with a slice of ham.  The final savory was the beautiful beef belly that was the softest beef ever.  The beef was accompanied by Brussels sprouts leaves.  Dessert was perfect for me:  passion fruit mousse with huckleberries, white chocolate/almond sponge cake.",

I got my favorite- a rye manhattan with a baby Saz and the balance was ideal! Food is presented well and absolutely delicious!! The sweetbreads and foie were faithful to classic preparation but had delightfully innovative touches.  The evening was topped off with a visit from the absinthe cart. While I normally find gimmicky bar tricks to be a bit tired the selection and methods of serving the large selection of absinthe was quite fun.",

    "text": "In the hip and trendy hotel of Aria is Sage, a restaurant that delineates what the hotel is about.  Cool purple lighting on the wall with a dim lit, intimate atmosphere and cool art work, the restaurant is very symbolic of Vegas.  I took my customer here to eat and he and his wife enjoyed the meal very much.  We all started out with the grilled octopus which was fantastic; in fact I haven't had such good octopus in a long time.  For entree, I had the scallops which the chef won the James Beard award with but the dish he won it with probably was something else because I thought the sauce was too rich for me and the scallops.  The customer and his wife had the special rib eye for two which came with bone marrow, mushrooms, onion and foie gras emulsion!  That's right, foie gras emulsion.  I had a couple pieces of the meat and wow was it good.  The foie that touched the meat was a perfect blend, I probably hadn't had such good meat in a long time.  Service was good, explaining and keeping us with rolls.  The rolls were okay but they had a bacon roll.  Yes that is a roll with bits of bacon in it.  Anyway I was stuffed so I didn't get a chance to eat dessert.  I'm giving it four stars because the scallops didn't meet my expectations and the bread while innovative wasn't hot as I like it.  Would I come back?  Didn't you read that I wrote foie gras emulsion?",

We were greeted very professionally and elegantly. Came here for our formal bachelorette dinner.   We ordered a lot of food and our bill came out to $100/person including 3 bottles of wine.  FOOD:  1. VANCOUVER ISLAND KUSSHI OYSTERS $19 -- Fresh and Delicious 2. FOIE GRAS CUSTARD 'BRULEE' 25. Bing Cherries/Toasted Cocoa Nibs/Salted Brioche --- Very cremey and delicious. All the girls LOVEd it. I thought it was just okay but maybe because I'm not much of a cremey food lover. 3. CHARRED BABY OCTOPUS SALAD 17. Grilled Shishito Peppers/Oven-Dried Tomatoes/ Basil Aioli --- ONE OF THE BEST DISHES WE ORDERED. MUST ORDER. So good. To every last drop. Perfectly put together. 4. MAINE LOBSTER RAVIOLI 20. Lemon-Olive Oil Puree/Baby Spring Peas/Mascarpone/Fresh Mint --- We had this as an appetizer and it was so good.  5. Crab Bisque Soup --- THE OTHER MUST HAVE DISH. Cremey, yet delectable goodness... and the pieces of crab added to the savory goodness and taste of the soup. Brought it all together.  6. GRILLED AMERICAN WAGYU SKIRT STEAK 21. Toasted Marcona Almonds/Quail Egg/Crispy Red Onions/14-year Balsamic --- The girls drooled over this dish. The steak was very well cooked. Just perfect medium. Tender and tasty. 7. ROASTED ALASKAN HALIBUT 32. Grilled Summer Squash/Parmesan Foam/Iberico Ham --- There were two fish dishes offered that night and I think this was the 2nd best. 8. SEA BASS - This dish was so good. My gf and I shared this and it was the best entree ending to our meal!  DESSERT: The chef served us complimentary chocolate soups for dessert. Sweet. Maybe a little too sweet.  But overall. The ambiance, service, drinks, and food, I'd give a really hard 5 stars. Loved it.",

From the moment we walked in we didn't get the \"wait for our table experience\" many places try (yes we did have reservations and it was Xmas night), we were taken right in and sat down.  The atmosphere was great and even though we were next to other 2 seaters, we were far enough apart we weren't on top of others and weren't bothered by conversations from other tables.  Drink orders were taken right away, dinner orders were taken quickly.  This is what I expect from high end service.  The food was excellent.  We savored every bite of everything we tried.  The chef even sent out a few items complimentary (we are not VIPs by any means, just casual customers).  I can't remember everything we had, but it was all excellent and the best food I have ever had, and that says a lot considering places I have been.  I can say the Wagyu Beef Tartar was incredible.  We had many servers, all of whom attended to our needs.   We never had empty and finished plates in front of us for more than 1 minute.  Everything was kept clean, and they stayed on top of service every step of the way.  This was truly top notch and I will be back again.",

I just wish the brioche wasn't so greasy, since foie gras is already fatty.  For entree, the partner and I shared the pear & brussels sprouts salad and the kobe skirt steak.  The salad was meh, but the steak was one of the best steaks I've ever had and everything that came with the steak was delicious!  I forgot what we had for dessert (like a fried rice pudding ball w/ ice cream)...it was not bad, but I was just too full to really enjoy it.

I started with a beef tartare, then I had the escargot, then lobster ravioli, then a delicious chocolate mousse.  I thought everything was delicious but I don't have any experience with these French dishes.

    "text": "Hubby and I came here after watching jabawockees (awesome show btw) and had the signature tasting menu ($89pp) & a bottle of wine.  Definitely one of the most memorable meals we've had.  The ambiance is outstanding.  Dark, sexy, and sophisticated, which is how I felt that night.    A run-down of the dishes- -   Wagyu beef tartare: Our favorite dish of the night! It was a perfectly balanced dish that we couldn't get enough of.  Creamy and rich atop perfectly toasted bread. -  Market oysters:  This was also delicious, although it's hard to mess up fresh oysters on the shell.  The garnish added a nice kick. -  Grilled octopus: Relative to the other dishes, this was just mehh.  Although that's not really fair because the other dishes were just so good. -  Maine dayboat scallops:  WOW this was probably one of the best scallop dishes we've had!  Usually I find cooked scallops to be over/under-seasoned or over/under-seared.  This one was just right. -  48 beef belly:  This was everything a beef belly should be.  Decadent, fatty, melts in your mouth.   -  Australian wagyu sirloin:  This was an additional $15 upgrade of the tasting menu. Not disappointed.  The sirloin was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  -  Green Apple mousse:  This was actually on the chef's tasting menu, but they let me switch the dessert at no extra cost.  Very interesting dessert (w/ peanut butter and celery) that took my palette on a sweet/salty adventure.  I'm a fan.  -  Pistachio tart:  I think this was pretty good (I had a little too much wine at this point hehe)  2 tasting menus (with australian wagyu) plus a bottle of wine, tip, tax- all under $300.  Not to mention the food was delicious.  Sage is definitely return-trip-worthy!",

It is one of the most reasonable cost for a tasting menu. 89 bucks. wine extra.  Each item I had was spot on for appetizer to dessert. And just enough food without feeling like a blimp. Elegant surroundings  good service and a nice bar to hang out at while you wait for your table. You can even eat at bar if there are no tables. I would go back no problema.",

It's definitely pricey so you'll have to expect to shell out over $50 a person, unless you plan on starving on the way out.    The service was a bit slow and I'm not sure if it was because we had a big party but it seemed they forgot about us at times.  It also could've been because we were being a bit loud and obnoxious.  Hmmm, so maybe they don't deserve the ding of a star?  Hahaha!  Either way, I still think that if you're paying that much money, excellent service can become an expectation.    It's definitely worth checking out and I would say that I'd go back but with all the awesome restaurants in Vegas with such little eating time during a short vacay, I'm not sure if this is one of the \"must go\" places on my list.  It was good to try and I'd recommend it to others but I probably won't cycle back through it anytime soon.  I have more restaurants to conquer!",

They finally seated us at a table and apologized with next round drinks on the house which was great. The menu had a lot of interesting items on it, like foie gras creme brulee and white truffle gnocchi. Overall, the food was amazing and the decor was perfect (not too dark but dim enough to see everything). The only complaint was that the service was kind of slow. It took probably 10 mins between us finishing the appetizers to getting the entrees and another 10 mins of receiving the bill once we finished our plates.",

The bride to be and groom's flight delayed their arrival by 1.5 days and I wanted to make sure everything was perfect for the bride when she arrived.  Thank God for Yelp.  I found Sage through Yelp and based on other Yelpers, scored a 7pm reservation for the7 of us, thereby assuring our reservation would still qualify for the early evening 3 course meal for all of us.  Do this-great deal for excellent food in Vegas. This was a well traveled group with high expectations for food and Sage did not disappoint.  From a delicious salad with burrata to start to tasty wines throughout, this restaurant helped make their weekend special.   On a visual note, we enjoyed the purple up lighting and linens and the feeling you were in a quiet restaurant, far away from the strip even though you're actually inside the visually stunning Aria casino.  Don't hesitate-go here!",

The beef tartar appetizer was very tasty and a nice start to the meal.  The fois gras creme brulee was good, but a little too heavy and the cherries over powered the custard.  I will admit that my expectations were a little too high on this dish based on reviews from others, I had much better fois gras creme brulee in Quebec on my last vacation.      The second and third course were fine, nothing blew my mind.  I wasn't a huge fan of the beef belly.  It was offensive, it just didn't feel very seasonal and was very heavy.    The peach profiteroles were very good and exceeded my expectations based on the description, the chocolate PB dessert option was good but wasn't at all impressive.    Overally I had a nice meal at Sage - it was 3 stars A-OK for sure.  I'd probably give them a second chance in my home town, but there are way too many good great restaurants in Vegas for me to give this one a second chance.",

    "text": "First-rate dining experience from top-to-bottom.   My wife and I both tried the four course tasting menu with wine pairings -- every course was spectacular and the wine pairings matched perfectly.  Even the bread (bacon rolls and baguettes) was awesome.  Highlights of the meal: -- Heirloom baby beets -- the whipped Harbison cheese was to die for.  -- Grilled spanish octopus -- I'm not one to normally like octopus, but the combo with the charred pumpkin and whatever other spices they had rocking  made me forget I was eating one of the sea's strangest looking creatures.  -- Beef belly braised for 48 hours -- the meat was fatty and very, very tender (almost melted in your mouth).  A price of $89 pp for the four courses and $44 for the wine pairings was definitely a steal by Vegas standards for the quality of food and wine we enjoyed.  The wait staff was great. The timing of the whole meal was spot-on -- we never felt rushed (in contrast to other nice Vegas restaurants, it would seem) but didn't have to wait long between courses, either. Our waiter was great about answering any questions and took some extra time to talk about each of the wines as there were a few we had never had before or really heard of.  Overall, this was the best dinner we had during our Vegas trip.  We'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "Rolled into Sage on a quest to try a ginger beer drink. I accomplished my goal and encountered some added bonuses along the way. Jeffrey, the bartender/mixologist, was incredibly nice and passionate about his drinks. He ended up making me a completely different ginger beer drink than the one on the menu with raspberries (he gave me a choice of fruit) and Canton, a ginger liqueur. Yummy. The bar is well-stocked for sure. Tiffany C schooled me on all the fancy scotch while Jeff kept pulling out bottles and pouring little samples of this and that, including a sip of some hibiscus juice.  We also ordered some kibbles: a cheese plate and tuna crudo. The cheese plate came with delicious cheese of course, but the fruity jam was the standout. The crudo was fresh--easy to gobble up on the toasty bread.  I know there is a whole restaurant experience to be had at Sage, but I was pretty pleased with my jam and toast. If jam and toast leaves an impression, then I am confident the real menu will be meteoric, but really, who needs a menu when you've got a bar stocked with gin(ger) and juice?",

    "text": "Food: 4 Ambiance: 5 Drinks: 4 Service: 2  I SO wanted to love Sage and was looking forward to it for weeks, but I was just disappointed overall. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but for the price and all the prestige...we were expecting better. Also, our waitress was pretty uninterested so that knocked my rating down a star. I don't usually judge a restaurant much by it's service, but when it's my bday celebration dinner and we are paying nearly $250 for a dinner for 2, I expect a little more friendliness and warmth..   We started with the foie gras brulee, which I was already weary of, but Ive read great things so decided that I just HAD to try it. Since it is a take on creme brulee, it was supposed to walk the line of savory and sweet and I totally get that, but for my particular palette, it was a little on the sweet side. I think that might just be a matter of preference.   The sweetbreads however, were fantastic. The pork belly (glazed bacon) could not have been cooked better. The bacon's saltiness and meaty texture perfectly complemented the richness and creamy texture of the sweetbreads. The bed of polenta was also delicious.   The Main Day Boat Scallops themselves were nicely seared and were perfectly tender and moist on the inside. The scallops were plump and tasted clean and mildly sweet, just as they should. The problem with this dish however (in my opinion) was the salted caramel reduction. I should have known just by the fact that it was a CARAMEL reduction, that it would be too sweet for me, but I thought it might just come with a drizzle. Instead, when the plate was served, a small pitcher of the reduction was poured into and all over the dish, so that my scallops were swimming in it. Again, this was probably just an ordering mistake on my part sinceI'm just not a huge fan of things being heavy on the sweet side when it's supposed to be a savory dish.   And last but not least, my fiance had the veal cheeks which he enjoyed. I tasted them and they were definitely very tender (as most braised veal/beef cheeks are known for this), so it was definitely delicious...just not the best Ive had. Still two thumbs up though.  The drinks were also fantastic. We each ordered an old fashioned, which is the standard by which I judge any bar by and they were delicious. It came with one large ball of ice which is exactly how I prefer it. It's actually my pet peeve if it DOESN'T come with a single large ball or cube of ice, because then the ice melts too quickly and dilutes the cocktail.   The main reason for my disappointment with Sage was not just the food (because for the price, I expected to be wowed), but it was the waitress. She was not rude, but she was not in any way whatsoever friendly. She was polite and stoic. But like in a forced condescending way, like she didn't really want to be there. At one point, she walked away while we were in the middle of asking her what one of the ingredients in the braised veal cheeks dish was. REALLY?? She did her job, she took our orders, she got our food sent out and that's it. Bare minimum effort. She did not make us feel welcome at all.....AND it was my bday dinner celebration. So yeah....that left a bad taste in our mouths, no matter how good the food may have been. If it wasn't for her, I would've given this place 3.5-4 stars.",

    "text": "In a nutshell: A fine-dining establishment that is not really unique, with decent over-priced food.   We went here for friend's birthday. She loves foie gras so I would say that her experience was probably 5 stars. However, for me and bf, it was just okay. Let me start off by saying I LOVE fancy restaurants. I think an awesome fancy restaurant is completely worth spending a ton of money when the food is phenomenal, and IMHO, Sage was not that.  BF and I got the prix fix Signature menu, which is about $90 a person. With that, we received a starter of beef tartar and oysters. The egg on the beef tartar was nearly cooked through, so it was hard to mix it up with the beef. The oysters were nothing special and very small. Our next course was a scallop each. The scallop was the highlight of our meal. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned and was just delicious. It comes with a bite of short rib, which was the perfect compliment to the scallop.  For the 3rd course, I ordered the sirloin and BF got the pork loin. One of our friends at the table also ordered the pork loin, but not on the Signature menu. The dish is actually 1 part pork loin and the other part a sausage of some sort. Her portion was TWICE the size of his. His was basically 2 bites of pork and a piece of sausage. They both said it was just okay. My sirloin was good but completely over sauced. I love steak in its simplicity and feel that good piece of meat that is cooked well doesn't need to be drenched in sauce.  All of the desserts, with the exception of my friend's $20 foie gras candy bar dessert, were completely underwhelming. I would've preferred to stop at DQ on the way home. The foie gras candy bar was gold flaked and fancy. Because of how rich and decadent it was, it's a perfect dessert to share. It was yummy!  All in all, it was as I said, OK. But if I'm gonna spend that kind of money, I want to be WOW'd and blown away by the food,and unfortunately, I was far from it. :(",

    "text": "Sage was amazing! The food was perfect and it had a nice ambiance although it was still casual. The prices of the drinks are a bit high, but they're damn good. They also have absinthe fountains in case you're interested.   If you don't choose to go for the tasting, you can go for 2,3, or 4 course options. Everything is great. If you're a wagyu fan the supplementary cost is worth it. The scallops as a main were epic. Dessert was creative and yummy (it's on a separate menu), so save room.     Our server may have cracked one too many jokes but hey, at least he was nice.",

    "text": "The chef at this place knows what he is doing.  The food was good.   I disagree with pampering already delicious foie gras with citrus and bunch of other flavors but respect this as a choice the chef has made. It was interesting.  The presentation of each dish was great.   The reason for two stars is the bus boy who was extremely sloppy, almost rude. Things like spilling water when pouring and not wiping it up or slamming silverware on the table, moving around in a very abrupt and almost offensive way spoiled my impression of this place.   The management needs to invest in training personnel. No matter how good the food may be - if you are in a service industry - learn how to provide quality service.   I will not recommend this place to anyone just because the service was poor. There are plenty of places in Vegas that have great food and know how to provide proper customer service.",

    "text": "I had an outstanding meal last night at Sage. The space is beautiful yet warm and inviting. Romantic. My server, John, could not have been better. Very professional, yet friendly, with superb recommendations. He was terrific. I wish I knew the name of the gentleman helping him, with bread, water and the like... he also could not have been better. (The staff across the board, from the hostesses to the food runners were all wonderful.)  And the food! I was bowled over by the flavors with every dish. I did 3 courses: 2 appetizers and one entree. The first was an artichoke and fennel salad: both were shaved mandoline thin, beautifully arranged with crispy capers (wow), various citrus and goat cheese. The flavors were remarkable. Then I had roasted heirloom beets and carrots, with various purees, including an intense, amazing tarragon pesto and the surprise was bitter chocolate, burnt and crumbled. I almost did not order this because of the chocolate but the way it worked in the dish was incredible. Again, fresh, deep, amazing flavors.   For my entree, I had lamb: perfectly cooked (and I mean PERFECT) lamb loin, with a rich eggplant puree, the best snap peas I've ever eaten and a lamb neck tureen. Again, I was a little iffy on the tureen but it was incredible and very inventive. It looked the way bone marrow is served, yet what is usually the bone was the actual neck, crisped and delicious, with a decadent compote of lamb and other ingredients inside. It's not as weird as it sounds, it was just plain delicious. I don't know where these snap peas came from but fresh doesn't even begin to describe them.   All in all, one of the best meals I have had in a while. I started with a top notch Manhattan and John recommended two perfect wines, a sancerre with the appetizers and a cotes du rhone with the lamb.",

    "text": "First of all, please note the dollar signs associated with this restaurant. This place is REALLY pricey. We ate here on a holiday weekend and I really expected the place to be more crowded but there were like 3 other parties in the entire restaurant, which, in my opinion, makes the place look bad. One of the parties had 2 small children which were crying and running around and it really pissed me off that we were paying so much to eat at such a fancy establishment and not one worker addressed the out-of-control kids.  Anyway, on to the food. I found the dinner to be average in taste (in comparison to the price). The best thing was the dessert. We each ordered a separate dessert and they were AMAZING. The dessert was well worth the cost. Otherwise, I won't be back.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like sage, but the food and service made that a little hard. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, but for the price point I expected a lot more. As soon as we were seated our waiter stopped by to drop off our menus and told us they were \"self explanatory\". We didn't see much of him after that. My wife and I both wanted the three course dinner, but there were 4 sections to order from. We were confused about which sections we should make our selections from. Not as \"self explanatory\" as our waiter made it seem. Luckily a nice lady in a suit stopped by to take our drink orders and helped to explain the menu to us. We would rely on her and the friendly bus boy for most of the night.           As for the food, it was not terrible but we found the quality was not up to par with the other restaurants in Las Vegas at this price range.  *Amuse-bouche- tuna tartare was the best thing we ate that night. It was delicious *First course - The Slow Poached Farm Egg was average, nothing to write home about.  *The Alaskan King Crab was also average. Decent, but not exciting.  *Second course - The Foie Gras Brulee was my favorite course. Rich and flavorful, just a little         sweeter than i usually like my Foie gras.   *The Grilled Spanish Octopus was smokey and flavored well, however the octopus was dense and just not a pleasant texture. The spinach underneath was also extremely overdressed  *Third Course - The Maine Day Boat Scallops were also dissapointing. I found caramel                        reduction very sweet and overpowering. My wife had a fish dish which was also fairly dull. We also ordered a glass of absinthe from the nice lady in the suit. We think she was either a manager or the sommelier. The absinthe was delicious, one of the high points of the night.        As far as fine dining in Las Vegas goes, i feel that sage has a ways to go. If i were to spend over $100 per person, I could think of quite a few restaurants in las vegas i would rather dine at.",

Wonderful service as you would expect from a fine dining place 3. Good pace for the courses 4. Excellent bourbon selection (didn't really look at the wine list) 5. We ordered three full tasting meals and three of the small versions. So, we got to taste everything. All in all good, but a place like this needs to blow us away like Joel Robuchon always does. The best dish was the braised veal and the chefs signature dish was the scallop and it was good but not great.  6. The chestnut soup gets at thumbs up from everybody. Again I'm tough on restaurants because not everybody can get 4 or 5*. The decor is great, the atmosphere is so-so and the food was good but not great.   BTW: Large tasting menu, small testing menu, one glass of wine and two drinks $350.00 includes tip. Just for your info.",

I like the fact that they didn't abolished their regaled ala carte menu and just serve the xmas set menu for the occasion. So we ordered the beef tartare to share and each have a main. Couldn't even fit desserts in even thou I was soooooo tempted by the 6 layered choc cake because the serving size was good.   Wagyu beef tartare was freaking amazing that came with buttered, crispy warm bread. And when combined with the silky yolk in a mouthful. It was freaking amazing.   My friend had the crispy confit duck and I had the smoked black cod. Duck was done to perfection and the cod was fresh, silky and smooth. Both had wonderful flavors   The service was fantastic as well. We had an amazing server that the origin of our champagne and how and why it taste the way it is. And we were really well taken care of in the drinks department. Even though we had to wait for quite some time at the bar, the server was so apologetic and acknowledged that we have been waiting and will bring us to our table as soon as thu can.   What can I say.. I will definitely come back to sage when I visit Vegas again.",

    "text": "Quality New American Fine Dining Experience with Exceptional Service.  Prior to arriving in Vegas, my friends decided we wanted to do one fancy, fine dining dinner where we could get all dressed up and act all \"BOUGIE\".  We called in reservations earlier in the week and booked a 7:30 dinner time no problem on a Saturday.  After we all gathered, albeit a little after 7:30 cause part of our party caught a hot streak at the tables, the staff was gracious enough to honor and hold our reservation.  We were seated in the back of the restaurant which was nice since it seemed more quiet yet we were not neglected as each section had a maitre'd like supervisor making sure quality service was being delivered at all times.  After looking over the menu, my friend who made the reservation asked about the Chef's Tasting menu and our waiter grabbed the menus for us.  When we made a decision on which fine dining establishment to fancy, we saw this delicious 4 course tasting menu for $79 dollars with an optional $39 wine/beer pairing.   The majority of us ordered the tasting menu and heres a snap shot of the magic I ate that night:  Amuse Bouche: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog?select=w8yQYzsqPnjnJ1smGrBdFA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU...</a>  1st Course, wagyu beef tartare: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog?select=aQnsr5D6YiP5tpybvejQtg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU...</a>  2nd Course, Bacon wrapped rabbit served over mushroom ravioli: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog?select=5ftT8bYa-7Hh1lmxoN_1Aw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU...</a>  3rd Course, braised veal short rib: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog?select=lADKbr5KVAwOTsEBSrA6fg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU...</a>  4th Course, Apple Caramel Nomage: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog?select=FvMCbNDYt5Vm69UndKXkBA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU...</a>  Some of the finest tasting food I've come across so far.  Our waiter was phenomenal, very professional yet kept us laughing all night long.  The wait staff that served our food knew exactly who ordered what and gave very detailed explanations of the food and how it was prepared.  My friends who had the wine pairing absolutely loved it and my friend who didn't order the tasting menu said her meal was superb as well..  Overall a truly fantastic dining experience.  I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for a fine dining establishment with out paying the outrageous prices that some establishments have.",

    "text": "Food that looks like food!  New American at its very best.  In the star-studded Michelin world filled with innovative cuisine, molecular gastronomy, and modernist techniques, ie, \"is that a pebble on my plate or can I eat it\".  Sometimes, it is refreshing to enjoy great food while being able to identify every ingredient on the plate.  This is Sage.  Incredibly well sourced, seasonal, fresh ingredients, each showing their own flavors blend harmoniously in a dish to elevate the primary protein.  The philosophy is clear in the amazing kushi oyster.  A tiny, uber fresh oyster with its subtle cucumber taste is enhanced by the tiny scoop of piquillo pepper and tobasco sorbet.  A tequila mignonette blends with its natural liquor and makes the perfect briny shot.  Seafood dishes skillfully combine land based ingredients to tease out the best flavors.  The oceanic sweetness of perfectly seared and cooked day boat scallops is brought to life by earthy trumpet mushrooms and meaty oxtail.  The caramel reduction creates an unexpected harmony.  The perfectly roasted turbot's sweetness is brought forth by the earthy porcini mushrooms and contrasts nicely with the caramelized onions.  A vegetal cauliflower emulsion makes the flaky fish seem voluptuous on the tongue.  On the other hand, beef, is treated simply, allowing it to be the star and accompanied by well chosen side garnishes.  The aged USDA prime rib cap is exceptional.  A very tender, flavorful cut of beef, simply grilled, sliced and allowed to speak for itself with nothing more than a garnish of root veg.    Deserts are a must for their very well controlled sweetness, or even tartness.  The raspberry soda (Greek yogurt sherbet, basil pearls, and raspberry marshmallow, tart, fresh explosion of raspberry flavor with a clean, herbaceous finish.  Be sure to close with absinthe.  Outstanding selection with the classic service (sugar cube dissolved slowly by drops of chilled water).  Herbaceous digestives whose complexity goes on and on.  Selections from both the US and around Europe.  Outstanding and informative \"flavor map\" so you know what to expect.  Polished and professional service.  Outstanding wine list.  The only flaw, if there is a major convention at Aria or if the hotel is sold, they do not manage seating times well.  This is the only top tier restaurant in the MGM chain that I have had to wait an hour past my reservation and still not be seated.  A replacement reservation the following evening went smoothly and the restaurant redeemed itself, delivering an outstanding experience.  Excellent.",

    "text": "The ambiance is exceptional.  Unfortunately, everything else falls short. Our group of four arrived to the restaurant 20 minutes early. The restaurant made our group wait until our formal reservation time - but when we entered, the restaurant was half empty, and it never came close to filling up. It was perplexing and unnecessarily high handed. The absinthe cart looked very interesting - but the rest of the drink menu seemed unexceptional. A friend seemed to really enjoy the scallops, but my impression from the rest of the group was that the food was just adequate. I did not feel that my meal came close to expectations - certainly was not worth the price. The service, also, was mediocre.   My impression was, if you wanted to feel more important than you probably are, you should come to Sage.  There really are dozens of places I could think of I'd go back to or want to try in Vegas before I would consider giving Sage another try.",

    "text": "This time around Sage was good but not great.  Service was slow and waiter had no idea what the best dishes were and what went into each.  Might have been new but in this case didn't seem trained.  Sommelier was great and recommended a great wine as well as cocktail.    For the meal, the scallops were great as usual.  Mackerel was a fantastic cut of fish but basic on the top end.  Some nice dipping sauces to give it a different feel, but the cut itself was very fishy in flavor.  The sea bass, on the other hand, was a must try and a fantastic order.  Fishy but with a nice char.  Some good sauces as well; seems like accompanied sauces are what Sage is notorious for.  For appetizers, the egg dip was fine, but really was just a nicely poached egg with truffle, and that's it.  French bread for dipping, but the complimentary bread was better.  We also tried the foie gras creme brulee.  Very interesting dish, especially considering it was an appetizer, but unusual to say the least.  Custard and foie gras with seasonal strawberries.  The foie gras was noticeable and really leaves a mark for the meal.  This is a must order even if you don't like fie gras just for its unusual texture and taste.  The dessert - the foie gras chocolate bar - was a pass.  Foie gras unnoticeable on this dish, especially as compared to the creme brulee.  More of a caramel chocolate bar with popcorn on top.  Nice looking dish in all, but definitely not worth the $20 price tag.  Foie gras taste was almost non-existent; just your typical candy bar.  Sage is a top notch restaurant for sure.  Prices are high but so is quality of preparation and cuts.  I would easily come back here but stick to the specialties and hope you catch the wait staff on a good day.",

    "text": "I'm usually not impressed and leave hungry from all $$$$ restaurants, especially in Vegas where everything is unnecessarily expensive and subpar compared to whatever their celebrity chef is famous originally for.   Sage is by the celebrity chef who created Green Zebra in Chicago. The venue is beautiful, the cocktails artfully crafted, the food delicious. The service was subpar for a restaurant of this caliber, and did leave a bad taste in my mouth given how much we shelled out for dinner.   HOWEVER, I would recommend the following and will definitely be back: * Scallops - 5 stars: These scallops were incredibly fresh and delicious, meaty, and flavorful! They were complemented perfectly with super rich, tender short ribs stir fried with mushrooms. Highly recommend but not filling as an entree because it probably comes with 2.5 giant scallops. * Foie Gras Brulee - 5 stars: OMG soooo incredibly good. Warning: very rich. Crunchy on top, rich smooth foie mousse, served with toasted brioche yum. MUST ORDER. * Veal Cheeks - 5 stars: Tender with a thick sauce melt in your mouth decadent. Prepared with a mexican style flavor and really good.  * Iberico Pork - 5 stars: So delicious and a Yelp favorite. I couldn't decide between the veal and iberico so split both with a friend. The Iberico isn't as tender as the veal but you can't compare because it's a different cut of meat and I preferred the flavor and preparation. It was some of the most tender and marbled pork I've had and would definitely order this in the future. * Bread - Not the best bread I've had but good, and I loved the butter and flakes of salt.  SKIP: * Eggs - 3 stars: I LOVE eggs, but this was a frothy egg soup and was too watery. Did not enjoy.  Service in the restaurant (bar service was great) left something to be desired. The food was delicious though and this is probably the first upscale restaurant on the strip I have really been excited about in Vegas in years! If you're willing to spend on good food I would highly recommend Sage.",

We got to sage yesterday and the hostess informed us that they are only serving 1 prefix menu, the menu had nothing we even wanted, we wanted variety and the actual menu at sage. When we made reservations there was no note that said there would be a prefix only and we never received a phone call or email. Very disappointing, I havent even had the chance to eat here and the 2 stars is based on customer service. They helped us get a reservation at jean George steakhouse, 2hrs later. We had dinner at 10pm and received mediocre service because it was the end of the night.",

    "text": "Stellar, stellar experience. I hate seeing recent reviews that say service is lacking, because I had what was probably the most engaging wait staff experience of any restaurant I've visited, anywhere.  It was 4 of us, feeding on each other's stupid jokes - not to say we were obnoxious or anything, but just...obviously joking and and laughing, in a good mood. The waiter was able to read the table, jump in to our jokes without forcing it, and...for lack of a better term, connect with us easily. Never felt faked, it was just really personal and nice. Didn't hurt that he was very witty - some pretty clever jabs. Plus he was extremely helpful in recommending food and drink. So, massive, massive points for the wait staff.  The table went for the tasting menu, and we were not disappointed. Added bonus - guest chef for the weekend was Graham Elliott, whose restaurant in Chicago I really enjoyed a few years back (maybe 9 or 10 at this point).  Amuse bouche was an oyster with a lot of little accompaniments (I specifically remember creme fraiche, thank you South park) that was very mild, very tasty. I don't crave oysters, but this was quite good, and even a diner who wasn't a seafood person said it was very good.  Then a salad of baby arugula with burrata, marcona almonds, and a nice piece of honeycomb. This was great. By themselves, the arugula was a little bitter/salty, the honeycomb overly sweet, but combined together and with the mild, creamy cheese and the crunch of the almonds, we all cleaned our plates.  Duck confit ravioli was excellent, in a sort of spicy mild mushroom broth and tiny cubes of beet. The beet was quite mild, but the duck was extremely flavorful and rich, with the pasta perfectly cooked. Again, table agreed, we could have eaten a lot more of these. I particularly loved the spicy broth with the ravioli, and most of us all but drank anything left after the ravioli were gone.  Next scallops with chorizo and stewed peppers. The scallops (two nice sized ones) were cooked just right for me, a little rare in the middle, but not too much, with a nice sear and good flavor. A little grit, not excessive. None of the flavors here were over the top - again, a friend who would never normally order seafood was glad to have tried this, even if it wasn't up his alley, so they appealed pretty universally.  And oh man, the wagyu ribeye cap. So rich and flavorful, perfectly cooked between rare and medium rare. The truffle listed on the menu wasn't overpowering (I think it's frequently overused and covers up other flavors). Again a pretty nice sized helping, I wish this went on and on. I was excited to see ribeye cap on the menu and I was well rewarded.  And then dessert, undersold as a \"banana split\". Delicious bruleed banana, vanilla gelato, plus candied hazelnuts that I would have eaten 10 pounds of, and chocolate sauce. Plus I feel like a really rich, maybe liquor mascerated cherry and some strong cherry sauce, perhaps leaking from the cherry. Simple thing, but really excellently executed.  Now we're stuffed and it's time for the absinthe course. Our excellent waiter takes his time, explains the whole thing to us, passes around bottles from his dedicated absinthe cart for us to smell and compare, then even comps us one more item than we ordered so we could try more kinds and the different preparations (one of which involved huffing the vapors from flamed absinthe? Awesome!)  Just an exceptional experience across the board. Every course was great, service was fantastic. The meal was expensive, but no one felt like it wasn't worth it. If I have to recommend a great experience to someone based on this and my last visit, Sage is way up there for Las Vegas when you're looking for something a little creative but not overdone.  And I just realized that this was my 1000th review, and I didn't even plan it that way - glad it was something good!",

Also 45 minute wait to serve our order. Unbelievable! And the worst, the food was lukewarm. I hate to complain about it because they might fix the problem but spit on my food when they return it to me.  Will definitely not come back  and will discourage friends not to go there. I don't care paying expensive stuff but should be worth it. Cheesecake factory or Yardhouse was even better.",

I convinced our little Vegas posse that we should treat ourselves to dinner here - we went all-in with the tasting menu and the wine pairings and it was magnificent in every way.  The service was flawless, the food was from a chef at the top of his game and the wine was tremendous.   We made the reservations about two months beforehand for a Satruday night, and we had a round-top in the middle of the restaurant.

This was not the case here.  We ordered a la carte, a lot of food and were completely happy.  Sweetbreads - always my favorite, and these were cooked perfectly. Octopus - Big pieces of braised octopus that were charred, lovely. Charcuterie plate - pickled cauliflower?  Yes please!  beautiful meat selection. Beef Tartare - The texture of this egg was so perfect and I loved the saltiness of the capers mixed in, served with grilled bread, the chocolate shouldn't scare you off, you can't taste it really, it just adds a nice crunch to the plate. Beef Belly - not sure how they cook this one, but the texture was just phenomenal.  Still super moist but falling apart.  I rarely eat beef entrees but this one was great. We finished off with oysters which were served with a tobasco sorbet.  I don't love big briny oysters, but these were small and sweet and were just wonderful.  We had an Intermezzo of white chocolate filled with a meyer lemon soup and some celery.  Honestly.  I don't think words can describe what an amazing 2 bites that was.  Desserts were phenomenal as well, My favorite was probably the chocolate with hazelnut.  But The apple strussel with truffle (that's right the mushroom not the chocolate) ice cream was phenomenal as well.    The service was also great, very friendly and warm.  We sat at the bar and had a lovely time.  I highly recommend.",

DARE...it's amazing. It gives you an energetic buzz and you feel less full...a True digestif!...the whole point right? The menu is eclectic and yet varied and fanciful...  The chef also offers a 6-course tasting menu that isn't printed but can be available if everyone at the table is the mood to participate and have an extra special dining experience.  It can even be vegetarian or vegan and accommodate taste restrictions...and for the money...have a wine or artisnal beer paring with it.

    "text": "You ever walk into a bar for the first time and say to yourself, \" Oh, I'll be back here again...maybe tomorrow night...\" ?   That.  And that was before we even ate the food.  Our charming and expert bartender Aaron was fun to watch, solicitous about our likes and dislikes, cocksure in his mixing and his opinions, and who skilfully entertained us while also leaving us to our conversation.  The modified classic cocktail menu was fun to peruse and the Last Word cocktail I had was gorgeous, complex and sent me to dinner with a lovely little hum in my head....  I read about the foie gras Creme brulee and it seemed like a must-have, but I had hesitations.  I don't like whimsical food, nor do I like food that tries to emulate something opposite (for instance, a dessert out of meat.)   Aaron strongly recommended it though,  as did our server James (more on him later).  What the hell, I was game....  Rather than rhapsodize about it here, read the other poetic odes contained in these reviews, and they are accurate.  I would like to add though that it is NOT whimsical food.  It is not a play on dessert.  It is an appropriate and accurate expression of the aspects that make foie gras beautiful, the texture and delicate flavor and the mouth feel.  Yum.  Aaron told me to order one to share  but I ate more than my half, and wanted more.   My girlfriend and I weren't hungry enough to order the tasting menu, so we picked two appetizers and split an entree.  I will return another time for the tasting menu, properly hungry.    The poached egg was a great example of what a skilled chef can do with a few perfect ingredients.  Shellfish and sweetbreads were not going to pass the lips of my dinner mate, so James, our attentive, funny server steered us to the Iberico pork loin which was perfectly prepared.  The amuse bouche was tar tare (bright and delicate) and the chef sent out a beautiful tiny hot chocolate with coconut to end our meal.   We skipped dessert and went back to Aaron, guessing correctly that asking him to make us something alcoholic and dessert-y would be a task he was up to...he didn't tell us a name for it, but it was chocolate, cold, foamy and perfect.  I haven't mentioned the bread, the wine, the sommelier, the beautiful decor in the dining room that is simultaneously hip and comfortable, the  pace at which the food came to the table, etc., all very good.   I left Sage wanting more.  (And yes, I came back the next night for more.)",

Decided to try some new restaurants during our latest trip to Vegas in June. Saw that Sage had great reviews (for good reasons) and it's right in the hotel. Came here on a Monday without reservations (closed Sundays), greeted by a hostess and seated promptly. I got to seat on the couch, which reminded me of Spruce. We opted for menu items rather than a tasting as we were on a bit of a time crunch. Complimentary Amuse-Bouche: Cherry tomato with avocado mousse. 4 stars. Light and refreshing. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog?select=G-Wq3vR3wqAgCkgd3-gHnA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU...</a> We chose the bacon bread over the sourdough. It was loaded with bacon, I am not a fan of bacon but this was really good. The lavender infused butter and the sea salt went very well with the bread. 3.5 stars <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog?select=Z7pAFA5xcHJVm4cFBPggZA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU...</a> Ordered the signature foie gras custard 'brulee'. Sounded 'interesting' and I didn't have any idea how the flavors will play out, but the sweetness of the brioche mixed with the foie gras flan was absolutely delicious! Creamy and a little sweet. Loved it, 5 stars! They brought us some additional brioche for the custard as well. It can get a little heavy so you can't eat too much of it. Perfect for sharing. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog?select=d2MgNlOYk4pv40Id1iyppA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU...</a> I forgot the name of the drink I ordered, but it was made with tea vodka, St. Germaine, rose water, and had a couple of pinenuts. Slightly bitter but great on the pallet, with a hint of sweetness. 4 stars <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog?select=tatraVOiOS2XCMcev_eKyQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU...</a> The seared bigeye tuna sashimi was not what I had expected. Bf ordered the dish and I didn't read the description. I wasn't crazy about the anchovies, and I don't like olives. The sauce is a bit pungent and overpowering with the strong taste of vinaigrette. The tuna itself was tender and soft. I would pass on this. 2.5-3 stars <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog?select=021O_aWYdiNTZelMyQ7-0Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU...</a> Wagyu beef tartare - 4.5 stars. Beef was very tender, and well seasoned. The caper aioli and mustard seeds gave the meat a nice little touch of flavor. Shaved chocolate was interesting but blended well with the tartare. The bread I was not so crazy about, loved the brioche and bacon bread much more. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog?select=sOYCJyYGeZGbduc4bHYH5Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU...</a> Potato-crusted arctic char - 5 stars! I am in love! The fish layered with thin strips of potato and the skin wraps the outside, the potato skin is crunchy and gives the fish a great texture that you cannot get from fish skin. Saffron cauliflowers and green grapes add great flavor and texture. I am craving for some more!! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog?select=yjtqTbr7II_fuCQE9j3p3A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU...</a> Maine Day Boat Scallops - perfectly cooked. So tender and juicy! With the braised oxtail it gives it quite the punch. A great way for surf and turf. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog?select=jgD-brxvGnyUJcgTbPUeSA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU...</a> We were too full and out of time for dessert, complimentary chocolate caramel soup was served. 4.5 stars. Yum, like a perfect hot chocolate. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog?select=cWQt1w2LeUO-iCWzQQqk7g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU...</a> What stood out besides the food was the impeccable service. You can tell that the servers actually care. Our server Jason had to leave during our meal due to change of shift, and he gave the best possible explanation I have ever heard in my entire dining life. And Robert was enchanting and funny, what a personality! He had a great introduction, and was very personable. Both were very attentive and they made my experience at Sage that much better. I will definitely be back next time I am in town, granted there are so many restaurants to choose from. Great food and great service, what restaurants and fine dining should be all about.",

This isn't one of those, but it still was one of the better meals I've had in a very long time.  So, better than 4 stars... I'll give 'em the benefit of the doubt and inch it up to 5. (-:   Everything we had was both rich and fresh.  I had the fois grois brulee, which is one of their signatures. Very unique and super-tasty.  Had the scallops for an entree, which rocked my world. How they do seafood that fresh in the desert continues to confuse me.  The palette of flavors was hearty and earthy and a bit sweet - a very nice combo.  Service was flawless and attentive.  They need to change out some of their lightbulbs, as the dramatic lighting, despite being cool, was a bit sharp on the eye.  But, that's a very nitpicky complaint.  The fact that I bring that up as my only real complaint shows how good a place this is.  It was pricey (no surprise there) - but worth it for the experience and the tasty bites.

Tucked in the Aria hotel, is this amazing restaurant. I knew it from the bread. When they offer you a biscuit, you take it, regardless of if you're going carb free or not. Had the signature tasting menu and everything was amazing. We also ordered the oysters which were SO fresh and delicious, but so expensive (this was in addition to the tasting menu since we orderd the foie gras supplement), they disappeared fast. The waygu beef tartare was very good, especially since we both aren't fans of raw beef generally. Dessert is usually my favorite but I didn't enjoy the olive oil ice cream too much, was weird for me. Overall a great experience.  All in all, everything was great, the service was not stuffy at all and they made it very welcoming, because let's face it, not everyone is a gazillionaire in Vegas and some of us normal people just want to eat good food too. Sage, I was weary to give you a high rating, because I don't want you to get too popular for me!!",

Holy crap! *Bison takaki: First time I had bison and from what I was told by friends is that it is a bit gamey.  Nope, not this.  Tender and melted like butta in my mouth. *Heirloom tomato salad: It was a great follow up from the bison.  Light and tasty.  Sometimes people go overboard with the vinegar.  Not this.  Very smooth tasting. *Wagyu beef tartar: This is another Holy Crap moment.  I thought this dish was going to be too heavy.  Nope.  The slow poached egg on top with the toasted bread... DELISH! *Grilled Spanish octopus:  I rarely order octopus because 95% of most places over cook this.  Oh this place hit the mark!  Nice smokey flavor and has some \"toothie-ness\" but not chewy AT ALL. *Dayboat scallops, braised oxtail, caramel reduction:  I was totally surprised that you get two huge scallops!  The sauce was to die for.   *Iberico pork loin: Ok... that should say it all.  Anything that is Iberico pork is heavenly. *Beef belly: This was soooo tender and deep in flavor.  We jokingly said that all the dish was missing was white rice.  The waiter went next door to the other restaurant and got us a bowl.  Now that  is service! *Gianduja pave (olive oil ice cream):  I wanted to pick up the plate and lick the whole thing.    They had two different breads: sourdough roll and a bacon roll.  If you're from the Bay Area skip the sourdough.  Nothing compares or comes close to our local stuff.  The bacon roll was tasty.  The couple next to us ordered the funnel cake.  It was sooooo tiny and they said it didn't taste as good as the ones you get at the ballpark or county fairs... cause probably this was a healthy version LOL!  I will DEFINITELY come back here.  EVERY single dish was a major hit.  I can't say that about Joel R.  I  know there are 16 dishes for JR, but none of the dishes was a Holy Crap moment.  I can also say that I never had a Holy Crap moment at Gary Danko's either.  Wow.... I can't believe I said that!  Can't beat the price, quantity and quality of food for $89!",

We ordered the poached egg worth truffles for an appetizer and they were not stingy on the truffles.  The egg was perfectly poached and the toast just melted in your mouth! For entrees we ordered the veal cheek and the gnocchi.  Both were great choices.  Although the gnocchi portion was not large I could not finish it because it was so rich (Not complaining). I can't remember what the dessert was called but it was a little chocolate disk.  Very yummy but not too heavy, which was perfect after our filling meal. Overall a wonderful experience. Wait staff was great and I felt we got a good value for the price. Definitely left happy and full!",

    "text": "This is in my top 5 dining experiences in Las Vegas. My friend and I went here for just drinks and appetizers, and it felt like a full 5 course meal.   We started with 2 dirty martinis, and they were made to perfection. Then we ordered the WARM GOAT CHEESE CROSTINI with Candied Walnuts/Black Pepper Honey. Oh my. Heaven.  We then nibblled on SHISHITO PEPPERS with Spiced Lime Salt...very interesting. My friend liked them better than I did, but they were like edamame on steroids. A great \"filler\".  Next we tried the WAGYU BEEF TARTARE with Slow-Poached Egg Yolk and Crispy Chocolate. This was melt-in-your mouth good.   By this time we were seriously having food euphoria so we ordered another martini (again perfect) and wanted seconds of the Goat Cheese Crostini.   Our waiter - Jason Bond (for real) -  (who was awesome by the way) urged us to try to Oxtail crostini instead. Neither of us had ever had it, but we were feeling brave. Oh. My. It was like the tenderest pot roast you've ever had, with the flavor of onions and mom's Sunday dinner. Wow.   So...here's when I bit into a little piece of bone (literally). It was pretty gross since then I was thinking of tail. BUT, I didn't really care and I just politely pointed it out to the waiter. The manager came over, made a big fuss, apologized, etc. They handled it very well and took it off the bill.   Then the waiter brought us a complimentary dessert. It was a shot of mint infused chocolate...not too sweet, perfectly warm. It was seriously one of the best desserts I've ever had.   So, I still give this place 5 stars even though I ate a tailbone. That's how good it is. Going back at my first opportunity.",

    "text": "My family and I dined here for Christmas Eve dinner. We had the option of choosing the Christmas prix fixe menu (3 courses, $75) or Chef McClain's Signature prix fixe menu (4 courses, $85, $50 optional beer or wine pairing). We all chose to go with the Christmas menu, with each of us ordering different items from it.  After ordering, we were delivered bread. No bread basket. Each person was given a bacon bread roll (a round bread roll with bacon in it!) and a little sour dough baguette. Both were delicious, especially when topped with the butter and sea salt brought for the table.  Then we were brought an amuse bouche, which was delicious. It was pumpkin seeds, a piece of oven-dried tomato, some kind of tangy cheese I can't remember, and probably some other things - but so delicious. Just a very small bite served on a silver spoon.  For the first course, we had the Taylor Gold Pears & Shaved Brussels Sprouts, Foie Gras Custard Brulee, Wagyu Beef Tartare, and Vancouver Island Kusshi Oysters. All were delicious! The foie gras and tartare, though, were very rich - almost too rich to finish the entire serving.  For the main course, we had Dayboat Scallops, Braised Veal Cheeks, and Grilled American Skirt Steak. Again, all were delicious! Best scallops I've ever tasted. The braised veal cheeks had such a good flavor. And the skirt steak was nothing like what I usually think of when I think of skirt steak (which was a good thing).  For dessert, we had the Honeycrisp Apple Tart and Dark Chocolate & Espresso Mousse Cake. Both were great, but neither were \"wow\" desserts.  The cocktail, beer, and wine list was great. I especially appreciated the beer list. It was filled with the type of beers one would actually have with such a type of meal. Classy beers with tremendous flavor profiles that pair well with the food.  The service was pretty much outstanding. Only complaint is that despite the server asking what our plans were after / if we had any time constraints (we were promptly seated at 5:00pm and had tickets for a 7:00pm show), it was 6:25pm before we got our dessert course and 6:45pm before we got our check (after flagging him down). Ultimately, it all worked out, but we felt a little frazzled as we didn't want to be late for the show.  The decor and atmosphere is perfect. It's an amazing and enjoyable dining space. Understated purples and golds, just the right size tables, etc.",

    "text": "Second stop on our continuing Aria foodie crawl, part two.  This is the best restaurant of the whole bunch I dare say.   Sage has an excellent selection of beer on tap and our bartender, Brad, let us try a few before settling on a drink.  They have the Dogfish Midas Touch on tap ($12), which is super yummy.  And they serve it in an actual Dogfish beer glass.  Classy!  My husband got a beer cocktail, which is called the European Union ($14).  Youngs Chocolate Stout, Lindermans Framboise Lambic, and Cardenal Mendoza Solera Gran Reserva brandy.  I thought this would be awful, but I tried some and it tastes terrific!  They have Sierra Nevada 30th Anniversary Ale on tap, which is a rare find indeed!  We did not try it because we have a bottle at home but after we try the bottle, we may need to come back and compare it on tap.  Check out my pic of the menu to see what else they have on tap.  For food, we tried the salumi which comes with pickled green beans ($9).  Very yummy.  We also had the poached egg ($7) which comes with bacon (yum!) and bread to dip.  Very good.  Finally we had the beef tartare ($9) which is topped with an egg perfectly cooked over medium and crispy chocolate flakes.  Sooo good, I could not stay away.  Portion sizes are reasonable.  Not too tiny, but not overwhelmingly big either.  Apparently you can only get the bar menu at the bar - and they have some really special items there so I suggest you check it out.  The bar only has seating at the bar.  There are two round tables in front of the bar but those are only for people waiting for a table.  Also, they serve beer in 64 oz growlers but our bartender did not recommend it.  First, it results in a messy pour and, second, the beer gets warm too fast.  Apparently, when the restaurant first opened they thought it would be a good idea to sell beer to go in the growlers.  But Aria put a kabash on that.  According to our bartender, it's all good to have people running around with big ass margaritas in glasses or plastic yards but not beer in growlers.  They serve the full menu at the bar as well, and we debated trying the famed foie gras creme brulee but we were getting full and had a few more restaurants to try that night.  Next time!  I highly recommend checking out the bar next time you are in Aria.  It's not very expensive as compared to the nearby Todd English PUB but is much nicer with much more interesting beer and food selections.",

    "text": "I'm not sure what's more impressive - the cooking in the dining room or the drinks at the bar. Regardless, Sage is both my favorite restaurant and favorite bar in Las Vegas. This was the case when I first visited in 2011 and is still the case in 2015.  With the food, my basic suggestion (or sage advice) is to order the dishes with the most unique combinations. Using ingredients that might seem odd together, chef Shawn McClain somehow makes them harmoniously come together.  For appetizers, the fork-soft grilled octopus with chorizo, spinach, and pickled red onions was a marvelous combination of ingredients. I liked it better when the octopus was heavily charred and daringly served on smoky mashed potatoes, but it was still a wonderfully executed dish. The foie gras custard was so sweet, it was on the verge of being a dessert, but the creamy richness was undeniably good.  For entrees, the scallop and braised oxtail was a gutsy surf and turf combination due to the pairing of gentle scallops with strong oxtail. Additional strong ingredients were used like wild mushrooms, rapini, and butter-laden salted caramel reduction, yet the scallop didn't get lost. Quite amazing. The nicely crusted pork loin dish was fun due to the small singlets of spaetzle and well matched asparagus, but was held back due to the bland poached artichoke and mismatched herbal pork sausage.  If the foie appetizer was like dessert, then it only makes sense to actually make a foie dessert. The foie mousse was coated in chocolate like a candy bar and topped with melding ingredients like candied popcorn, Bourbon caramel, and peanut butter ice cream.  The drinks are impressive in many different ways. They have an international selection of absinthe, infuse their own cocktail ingredients, make their own bitters, stock hard-to-find whiskeys, and offer liquor flights. One Bourbon flight had six different ages of Pappy Van Winkle. Granted, it came at a high price at $500 for half-ounce pours.  The style of the constantly changing cocktail menu is bold. The cocktails here can be strong, herbal, gritty, bitter, rounded, or classic, but never soft, watery, sugary, or fruity. They are cocktails for real connoisseurs.  The only problems I had with this place were music selection and the uncomfortable chairs with cramping arm rests.",

It was a $70 meal for one, and while delicious, the service and temperature both brought the experience down. Til tonight, this was my favorite Vegas restaurant.

And sustainability doesn't seem top of mind to the typical Vegas visitor, whose tastes lean more towards door-sized slabs of steak.  But Aria goes for a refined take on farm-to-table, in a chic but surprisingly loud setting. The small menu favors protein, and features some personal favorites--sweetbreads, octopus, and rabbit among them. I went for the veal cheeks and they were amazing, succulent with a texture similar to short ribs but somehow weightier and richer, redolent in a black garlic glaze with trumpet mushrooms and a corn cake that seemed out of place. Also had the octopus, and found it to be good but unexceptional.  On the downside, the limited menu may not suit all diners. My companion was looking for smaller plates of vegetables or seafood and she had very few options, with some (like the scallops) taken out of consideration because meat featured prominently in the presentation. Our server was reasonably attentive but had an odd, standoffish demeanor. And the wine list, while it included some unusual and lesser known labels, was pretty skewed toward Napa cabs with a pretty hefty markup. Not unusual in LV, but you'd think they would have tried for something more out of the ordinary.  Overall, a mixed experience, but I'd come back just for the veal cheeks.",

Yes this place is on the pricey side but it well worth it, because not only the food was stellar,  but the service was just as great if not better.    I had the tasting menu which consisted of Chilled maine lobster, Foie Gras Brulee, Sea scallops, Herb-crusted Lamb Saddle, 48 hr braised beef belly, and to finish a Green apple Mousse.   Everything was done with love and care.  You can really taste the love they put into preparing all the dishes.  The Beef belly so so tender, almost like butter melting in your mouth.  Lamb saddle was very flavorful, with there herb crust enhancing the lamb flavor rather than covering up with gamey flavor.  My favorite dish though was the Foie Gras Brulee...... OMG!!!!!! It was so rich and such a smooth texture.    If i died after that meal.... i would died a happy man.",

    "text": "We went to Sage in October '14 for our \"fancy\" dinner. First bad sign, it took us nearly 30 minutes to get our drinks, I think we saw our server 4 times total during our 2+ hour dinner there. I ordered a brussel sprout starter which was excellent. Had to wait about 45 minutes between being finished with our appetizers and getting our entrees. I ordered the scallops for my entree. First bite, I noticed the chef/cook had not removed the side muscle, which should have caused me to ask for a new dish, but I never send food back. To my detriment, the dish made me violently ill, made 2 mad dashes to the bathroom to throw up, couldn't finish my meal or one $15 drink. I then just prayed that the check would come quickly so I could go back to the hotel room and hope not to die. After waiting way too long on the check, we had it split into 3 checks for the 5 of us, I signed and ended the night.   The next morning, we went to brunch and my visa was declined, because my fraud alert had been triggered (unrelated), but when I called my bank, they were reading off the charges and I had over $400 worth of charges from Sage. I pulled out my receipt from the night before and told my bank that I only authorized $140. Well, these charges stayed on my account for a week after my vacation. I called several different people and left messages with the Aria and Sage about the incorrect charges, but never received a phone call back. Turns out they charged my friends for their dishes and then charged me for mine and AGAIN for my friends' dishes. Just to add insult to injury, I suppose. I will never be going back to this restaurant, would rather stick to my consistent favorite, the Eiffel Tower Restaurant in the Paris.",

    "text": "We were staying at the Mandarin Oriental and had a positive experience when we came to Sage for dinner on a Friday night. We made the mistake of coming back on Sunday night to have a cocktail at the bar. Aaron B. was our bartender and I can say that, without a doubt, he was one of the most unpleasant people I've encountered in the service industry. If this was a low-rent bar with cheap drinks, I'd forgive him. But...we paid top dollar for an enjoyable high-end experience and, after attempting to make polite chit-chat with him about how he was making our cocktails, he became oddly aggressive and insulting -- as if we were idiots questioning the work of a master. Absolutely ridiculous.  A few moments later, we also overheard him complaining loudly about a female customer who was \"so f--ing stupid that he had to explain every item on the menu three times.\" Very classy indeed.   For our last night in Vegas, it left a bad taste in our mouths. We visit Vegas often, but we won't be going back to Sage. There are too many other places to spend our money -- and we've encountered many other bartenders who make comparable drinks and understand how to engage with their customers.",

The blueberry habanero had the perfect amount of kick and made for the perfect dessert if you like sweet and spicy. Also tried the Old Fashion, which was by far the best old fashion I've ever had. The drinks were great but the live music was my favorite part of the experience. The singer had an incredible voice and played a range of music. Overall great spot for a relaxing after dinner drink.",

The waitress warned us that it would be a 2 hour dining experience.    In actuality, between the wine and great company, we were there for 4 hours.  The food looks like something out a magazine, smells great, and tastes refreshing with every bite.   We started out with complimentary oyster to wash our palate, I swear it smells like the ocean, something a little mermaid would enjoy.   Then so many dishes after that, I don't recalled anymore.   My favorite was the pan seared scallops, it was the right texture, best tasting scallops I ever had.  Definitely will be back whenever we go back to Vegas.",

    "text": "Awesome meal -- one of the better ones I've had in Vegas. The dishes were stunning in presentation, inventive, and well executed. If you appreciate food, Sage is one of those splurges that is worth experiencing. My wife and I opted for the signature tasting menu, which seemed like the popular choice.   Decor/atmosphere - modern and sophisticated, dark and romantic yet without being too dark without being able to see anyone or any food. We sat in a table off to the side, and it was private and comfortable. I loved how the light shined on the table, as if to present our dishes like artwork.   Kind of random, but the background music they played reminded me of that fancy restaurant \"Claw\" the movie Date Night, where Steve Carrell and Tina Fey stole someone's reservation and all hell breaks loose for the rest of the night.  Anyway, on to the food. My wife and I ordered separate dishes for each course, just so we could sample as much food as possible.  - Amuse bouche: cauliflower gazpacho, in mini shot glass. It was cool and refreshing with subtle flavors -- a nice way to start things off and initiate the taste buds.  - 1st course: market oysters and the foie gras brulee. The oysters tasted so clean, so fresh, and I loved the little kick from the tabasco sorbet on top. The much talked about foie gras brulee did not disappoint -- it was rich, creamy, and super decadent. An original dish for sure, and while I enjoyed it, I don't see myself ordering this again.  - 2nd course: grilled spanish octopus and maine dayboat scallops. The octopus was unbelievably tender, and practically melted in my mouth. I wish there was a bit more of that grilled and smoky flavor for that added dimension, but just nitpicking at this point. The scallops were perfectly cooked, and I enjoyed the tiny bits of braised oxtail and mushrooms. I wanted more of that oxtail.  - 3rd course: 48 hour beef belly. My wife substituted for a pesto-like pasta dish, and while it was good, the only thing I can remember is my beef belly dish. This was my favorite of the night. Just imagine a beef version of a pork belly, but with even more flavor. There was a subtle hint of smoke, yet a bit of sweetness throughout the meat. I didn't really care for the peaches.  - 4th course: gianduja pave and pistachio tart. The pave was absolutely a stunning piece of edible artwork. Every component was so detailed and intricate that I felt bad wrecking it with my spoon. It was fun to eat, and the olive oil ice cream was a nice contrast with all the crunchy textures from the hazelnut crunch. The pistachio tart was also spectacular in presentation. It was good, but definitely not as memorable as the pave.  Overall, an excellent dinner. I was a bit disappointed that they didn't acknowledge our anniversary when I put it down as a reservation note, but hey minor details. Service was easy going, efficient, and on top of things. Our waiter had a flair for the dramatic, if you know what I mean, and sort of reminded me of Chef Art Smith in voice and demeanor (not looks). I'm glad to have dined at Sage, and hope to again in the near future.",

    "text": "Friday night, last minute birthday dinner reservation for a group of 9?  In San Francisco, that would be a near impossible task to accomplish, but Sage was happy to accommodate us! #winning  To start: We were briefly introduced to the bar before getting seated.  After ordering a round of waters (too hungry to consume alcohol!) and getting acquainted with the menu, our dining experience began with a selection of sourdough bread and bacon bread with herb butter and sea salt.  I love bread and I simply couldn't get enough of these.  Although the bacon bread was a little on the oily side for me and the sourdough was a less sour than the SF variety, I had few complaints once I paired everything with the herb butter and salt.  The server even came around for a second time to offer additional rolls right before our food arrived!  +1 star for sure.  Next, we received a complementary amuse-bouche and that was an absolute delight.  The server was soft spoken when introducing the appetizer, however, so I cannot recall exactly what we had. The flavors were subtle and worked well with the cream and sweet fruits.   Main courses: Chef Shawn McClain's masterful menu includes a number of rich, indulgent, high value items.  Think oysters, sweetbreads, steaks, truffles, scallops, bone marrow...if any of these items make your mouth water, head on over.  Unfortunately, if you're vegetarian, the selection is far less accessible, although items can be modified (and prices adjusted) to accommodate dietary needs.  It was difficult to settle on just one dish, but I could never resist a good duck dish. :)  I ordered the duck breast with persimmon puree, spiced rillette, and roasted cauliflower.  The duck is sourced from Grimaud farms, and the meat is noticeably leaner than other duck varieties that I've had.  i appreciated the slightly crispy skin and the sweet-salty contrast of the persimmon-duck.  Excellent flavor, hearty portion, and beautifully prepared!  A few other notables: the gnocchi was the dish of the night (4 of us ordered it) and it stands out as a well-executed dish.  The braised wagyu short rib was solid too -- excellent job on the braising.   Overall - Everyone was pleased and satiated with the quality of their meal. - The food is rich and you will leave feeling full. - Aside from the soft spoken servers, service was pretty solid and the dining experience was efficient and well paced, allowing us to move on to our evening activities quickly. - Dessert options were primarily cream or ice cream based (and no birthday specials).  Again, too rich!",

We then share, and get to sample a massive amount of the offerings. The highlights on this occasion, being the outstanding Waygu Beef Tartare, and the Rabbit backstrap. Additionally, the desert featured a block of olive oil chocolate, surrounded by pomegranate seeds, and various insane magical elements(See pic!).   The wine selection can easily be described as Expansive, however, with the prices ratcheting up to over $10,000/bottle, it could easily be confused with Expensive. To be fair; you can find a bottle of red for a little as $50, if you try hard enough ; )  If you find yourself in Vegas, make a reservation at Sage. You will be glad that you did. It does not disappoint.",

    "text": "You wouldn't expect Sage to be a farm-to-table dining concept, judging by its sleek modern decor and hip ambiance. High-quality and fresh ingredients are used to create unique dishes possessing a complexity of flavors.   Chef McClain's Signature Menu offers a well-rounded sampling of delicacies featured on their regular menu. My friend and I ordered from the same menu and tried each other's orders, because sharing is caring.  Wagyu Beef Tartare: I loved the richness of the beef. It tastes great when spread all over slices of toasted bread. The chocolate shavings were more decorative rather than adding to any of the beef's flavors.   Foie Gras Custard Brulee: Much more savory than I was expecting, but still good. Figs or another sweet fruit might've been better choices instead of the bitter kumquat.   Grilled Spanish Octopus: A mild and light dish compared to my Maine Day Boat Scallops. The octopus was perfect and tender -- what more could I ask for?  Maine Day Boat Scallops: Everything in my heavy boat of a plate melted in my mouth. The two plump scallops were perfectly cooked, as well as the braised oxtail and mushrooms.   Bacon-Wrapped Iberico Pork Loin: In this case, there's no such thing as too much pork. The braised pork belly was melt-in-your mouth delicious, but it wasn't the star of this dish. There's also sorts of rich flavors and textures in this dish that make it delectable. One thing I wasn't crazy for was poached pear flavored with anise and licorice -- just not a fan of the flavor combination.   Dark Chocolate Panna Cotta: The dessert overall was delicious, but I'll admit that I didn't like the red velvet sponge cake, mainly for its texture - I still devoured every . single . crumb.   Foie Gras Candy Bar:  The Foie Gras Candy Bar is what really attracted me to Sage. It's unlike any other dessert and foie gras dish that I've eaten. Essentially, it's like a luxurious Snicker's Bar with bourbon caramel, salt & pepper peanut butter cream, and chocolate crumbles and a dusting of gold...and it's pretty bomb.  Lychee Green Tea: Aromatic and flavorful.   To finally finish off  dinner, our server presented us with complementary hot chocolate with rosemary in \"shot glasses,\" which was smooth and delightful.  The service was great. Staff was professional, personable, and attentive.   Conclusion: Dine here if you want to spoil yourself or someone else.",

I got the prefix menu that consist of Beef tartar, scallop with oxtail and mushroom, the 48 hour  beef belly and ended with the lemon cheesecake for like $89 dollars.   The beef tar was okay. It's kinda hard to have anything better than Craft's wagyu beef tartar so it was only okay. HOWEVER, I did really love their version of the crostini. There were like 3-4 pieces.  I also tried my brother's foie gras appetizer and that was spectacular. Also tried one of the oyster and wow was that really good(I'm not even an oyster fan but that oyster was amazing. (provided w/ pics)   The thing that really made me love this place was their EXCELLENT oxtail mushroom scallop. IT was SOOOO good. The aroma that came was excellent and wanted to make me drool. Came with 3-4 pieces of mushrooms and a piece of oxtail that actually looked liked a mushroom cause of the sauce. the sauce was excellent.Then of course the excellent and fresh scallop when you pair them all together is spectacular. I don't know how else to describe it but it was prob the best scallop I ever had.   48 hour beef belly: It was also really good. It's not the scallop AMAZING but it was still very good. Obviously when you braised it for 48 hours, it's soft and tender and is seasoned well. Obviously can't go wrong with the potato puree and  sides.   The only reason why I decided to give it a 4 is the lackluster finish of the lemon cheesecake. The deconstructed desserts that they have is more of a gimmick than tasting good imo. It didn't taste good at all imo. The other chocolate dessert panna cota was better though. I really recommend straying off from the lemon cheesecake.   With that said, if you're down for a fancy dinner in Vegas, Sage is a wonderful place to go to. The prefix menu is excellent and I would recommend it to anybody.",

I agree with my yelp friend--it does not deliver the same food quality as a star restaurant.   I like that the restaurant is at least trendy and the dishes are more contemporary. Sadly they don't have much veggie dishes. Well, you can say that if we want veggie then we should find a vegetarian restaurant instead of coming here. But my point is they offer too little. Only 2 dishes of the whole menu don't contain meat or fish. This is not contemporary.  So we tried their egg with smashed potato. Very small dish with a poached egg on top of smashed potato. the taste was good, though very heavy. Thankful it is only a small dish. And surprisingly the bread coming with it looked like fully dipped in oil and fried. Not very healthy, nor pretty.   The mushroom dish was actually big to my standard. It was two eggs on top of a mixed mushroom bed. I like the mixed mushroom, but again it was way tooo salty, and oily. Didn't wanna eat it in the end.  My bf had their cod. I was very disappointed by the fish. I was not buttery as I expected, instead very smoky. I don't like it at all. But I end up liking the mussels on the side. Those are very fresh and tasty.  The wines here are bad, and expensive, I should say. That is the big down side. I mean the food tasted good in general, even though I'm pretty picky about it. But the wine was not tolerable. A class of pino noir costs $20 and is not good? No, thank you.",

Waiter rec NOT to get wine pairing bc it's just something required by the casino and u get total of one glass for $44.   Amuse bouche complements of chef was beet and pomegranate, but too bad I ordered the same salad.  Guess I thought the one bite would be something more unique?  I started with the foie gras creme brulee which is delicious and taste just like you would imagine. Comes with a buttery bread to up the decadence. Husband got the oysters which he thought could be perfected.   I then got the grilled octopus which was tender and seasoned well.  Scallops were amazing!  For entree they let us sub duck breast which was delicious with duck breast and duck confit on lentils and creamy polenta.  Ricotta cheesecake and chocolate panna cotta with milk gelato both great desserts to finish.   Lastly we got rosemary scented hot white chocolate which was surprisingly yummy!",

He explained carefully how to drink the absinthe out of this weird pipe contraption that disintegrates the sugar up.   Oh god, it looked so awesome but tasted horrible. Black licorice? Mint? No idea. I could only stand a few sips, and tipped the bartender.   Haha, oh well, it was cool to try.  If I found out about other similar crazy cool drinks at this place, I'm totally going to be coming back. (MyVegas doesn't need to influence me.) Especially because it will be convenient for us at our new regular airbnb spot at Veer towers.   That was an awesome experience.

    "text": "Really a 4.5 but on to the experience...after traveling through the property, past some eating establishments which were open to the traffic coming and going through the casino, we arrived at the hostess station. We were then escorted back through darkness where the noise from the casino faded away. Passing through the bar, we came upon a large grand room with extremely high ceilings.  The dining room was everything I wanted, dark, quiet, simple yet elegant. Large pillars were located throughout the room but looked like they belonged, simple chandeliers gave off a warm candle like light. GORGEOUS. The only let down was that they tried to seat us along the long highly lit wall. I actually sat down and immediately felt like there was a spotlight on me, NO BUENO! Had to move, we asked to sit in an alcove that had one table in it...PERFECTION! Intimate yet open to the large room, we had the best table...however it was funny to watch them try to sit other couples in the \"spotlight\" seat and see them refuse to sit there too.  The tasting menu looked divine but we would have both had to order it...a la carte it is! Recommendations:  Blueberry Habanero cocktail ($16) definite blueberry flavor with a little heat on the back end, I'd order this again.  SLOW POACHED ORGANIC FARM EGG ($18) smoked potato / shaved black truffle / toasted country bread...can't tell you how simple yet fabulous this was, super yummy  HAMACHI CRUDO SALAD  ($19) ginger soy / smoked coconut / radish...very clean, fresh, large pieces of hamachi.  WAGYU BEEF TARTARE  ($21) crushed caper aioli / slow poached egg / crispy chocolate...a good tartare, very fatty, rich, I would have enjoyed a more robust flavor.  GRILLED SKIRT STEAK ($56) charred brassicas / sesame / miso soubise...WINNER WINNER, this was a highlight, flavor, texture, great steak.  Passion Fruit Semifreddo ($11)...was super impressed by this dessert. Great passionfruit flavor, thought it was the perfect end to the perfect last night in Vegas.  Come here to get away from the crazy that is Vegas, the feel is sophisticated yet comfortable. Ask for Marcus, he was the best!",

    "text": "Sage is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas!    They have had two of my favorite appetizers...maybe 2 of the top 5 or 10 appetizers.  One being their Slow-poached Organic Farm Egg--Smoked Potato/Shaved Black Truffles/Toasted Country Bread.  The other being their famous Foie Gras Custard Brulee--Apricot Chutney/Toasted Cocoa Nibs/Salted Brioche.  If these two weren't enough, Sage continues to shine with other great starters.  The Aged Tequila Mignonette that accompanies the already creamy and succulent Vancouver Island Kushi Oysters is fantastic!  Moreover, the Wagyu Beef Tartare is a solid choice and the Chilled Sweet Corn Soup is outstanding!   Additionally though, this cocktail snob can't stop thinking about their \"Seville Constelation.\" This is my current favorite drink.  There is nothing I'd rather start an evening of whiskey/bourbon/scotch/rye drinking more than this drink.  It is refined and delicate for a whiskey-based cocktail, but still has enough of a backbone to entice whiskey purists.  It is the epitome of a balanced drink!  The menu is not perfect in my opinion, I have had a few dishes on occasion that have fallen flat, but in general Sage's dishes are inventive, and bring together a wonderful combination of technique and flavor.  I am certainly more of a fan of the Starters then I am of the Entrees, but that doesn't mean that the Entrees are bad, just not as euphoric as the Starters.  I generally prefer lighter meats and seafood dishes.  I think Sage does a good job with these items, but I would recommend the Steaks and Braises to those looking for more cohesive plates.  Always check to see if they are participating in Restaurant Week when it rolls around. This year's Restaurant Week menu at Sage was the best value on all of Restaurant Week....it was a delightful excuse to come in again.  Furthermore, Lauren is one of the best servers you will ever have the pleasure of experiencing.  Don't request her though as we are trying to keep that on the DL so she is available for us when we come in.",

Here's what we ordered:  Alaskan King Crab - Very light and the citrus touch worked well...  Roasted Veal Sweetbreads - Solid mix of fancy chicken nuggets, fancy mashed potatoes, i think it was either collard greens or spinach, and mushrooms. Of course it wasn't chicken nuggets or mashed potatoes but it is what is comparable if you eat simple food and is overwhelmed with what is on the menu.  Foie Gras Brulee - One word: Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucccccccccccccccccckkkkkkkkkkkk. This dish is something else, to take a salty savory item like Foie Gras and add sweetness from Strawberries, candied sugar, and cocoa...pure umami. This is a must get for sure.  Wagyu Beef Tartare - I've had tartare before but they give you a lot on this plate. Didn't understand what the chocolate did as it did not add or take away from the flavor but the egg and the bread and the meat was fire. Again this is a must get!  King Salmon - Salmon was cooked well...the curry sauce is interesting but it was not as complex so it left us a little dissapointed.  Organic Chicken - Fire. Meat was cooked well, don't know what type of chicken it was but felt like i was eating Jidori Chicken. Skin was dope as well as the sauce that blessed the chicken. Warning though, it is heavy...but between the Chicken and Salmon you should just fuck with the chicken.  Meal came out to be around $200 (a little bit pricey for what you get) but I was satisfied off the Foie Gras Brulee & Wagyu Beef Tartare alone. I wish they had an a la carte option cause those two dishes would most def be bought on the monthly.",

    "text": "My dinner at Sage was the most disappointing of my recent trip to Las Vegas. The experience just did not live up to the many other fine dining options available in Vegas.  My meal started out fine, with a glass of Schramsberg Sparkling Wine and an excellent Bacon studded Roll. That was quickly followed by a gift from the Chef. A small thimble full of potato soup with a tiny potato chip on top. I have often found that these Chef's Gift courses can be my favorite bite of the night, because the Chef packs as much flavor and technique into the item as they can to showcase their talent. This course did none of that.  My appetizer was the oft mentioned Foie Gras Brulee. This rendition had a Huckleberry Compote, Cocoa Nibs and Toasted, Salted Brioche. It was good, but the Brulee Crust combined with the Compote made it too sweet for me. I did not taste any Cocoa Nibs, which might've cut the sweetness.  When I scraped the sweetness away and scooped up the Foie Custard up with the Salted Brioche, it was rich and creamy and actually tasted very good!  My Entree was the Maine Day Boat Scallop with Braised Oxtail, Trumpet Mushrooms and Salted Caramel Reduction. This dish just confused me. The Scallops were only seared on one side and the Reduction was poured over them at the table, which defeated the purpose of searing them to begin with. I am sure the Reduction was meant to poured around the dish. The Braised Oxtail was good but didn't really have a place in this dish. My last Scallop even had some grit in it. That should never happen! The description said it came with Trumpet Mushrooms. Mine had 1/2 of one Trumpet Mushroom. This is close to False advertising!  Service throughout my meal was prompt, but aloof and cold. They are wheelchair accessible, but to be honest, I don't see myself coming back anytime soon!",

Interesting....but pretty delicious. This is an upscale restaurant....so I wouldn't recommend bringing babies or small children.  The menu comes in your choice of courses: 2, 3, or 4 course menu. My party of 5 ordered a mixture of 2 and 3 courses so we can all sample the appetizers. We got multiple orders of sweetbread (no...not what you're thinking. Tasted kind of weird to me....almost like a tofu-like texture. Others in my party enjoyed it), Alaskan king crab, kale salads, beets, octopus and beef tartare.   For my main entree, I ordered the: Black Bass with brocolini and some kind of grains....similar to couscous. It was delicious!! Pippin hot and flavorful. Wish I had taken pictures of all these dishes we ordered but I was eating with my boyfriend's clients and I didn't want to be that crazy lady who takes pictures of every single dish that comes out.

It was a random weeknight, so the bar was mostly empty, but that's how I like it if I'm dining solo.  They also do a tasting menu and have a more formal dinner menu, but the bar menu looked more interesting to me (all are available at the bar).  The drink menu shows you where on the spectrum the cocktails are, but after I told him my preferences, the bartender was super helpful in creating a cocktail for me that would better suit my tastes.  They also have an impressive whisky collection, including some pretty hard to find Orphan Barrel bourbons.   Food: this was dinner #2 for me, so I couldn't eat as much as I would have liked... - Day boat scallops: nicely seared, super sweet, with super flavorful braised oxtail on the bottom, mushrooms, and broccolini. The salted caramel reduction was a bit sweet, but overall, the dish had great textures and flavors  - Slow poached egg: with thinly sliced smoked potato, potato puree, parmesan cream, Bellota, and truffles. This was like a major flavor bomb. It came with crostini, which was perfect for soaking up all the liquid.  This dish is a must try.  I would definitely come back for those dishes I had.  Prices were very reasonable by Vegas standards.  Also, service at the bar was great - between the bartender and manager (?), people kept checking in to make sure I was having a good experience.",

I loved the ambiance created by the sexy violin-playing deejay. I've been here for my birthday before and was super happy with every aspect of our prix fixe meal. So we returned last night and decided to order off the dinner menu. Standouts were the bacon bread and all the classic appetizers. My guy loves foie gras so it was all his to enjoy. He even ordered more of the accompanying brioche to scrape up every last bit of the foie gras. I enjoyed the octopus which was cooked just right so it was tender, not chewy. The egg dish was deliciously creamy. The yellowtail in the hamachi salad was sashimi fresh. I normally don't order sweatbreads and tartare, but both were tasty. We were quite full after the classics but still found room for the lamb and skirt steak. The peach dessert was a work of art. We'll definitely be back next time we're in town.",

Though the first time I ate there I was by myself and they kept trying to get me to eat at the bar, which was a little annoying.  The food is perfect if you like new American cuisine. The tasting menu is expensive, there is no doubt about it, but worth it as a nice night out. There is usually a good mix of seasonal vegetables, meat, and seafood. The wine pairings can be interesting as the sommelier likes to try wines that are less well know. The food and ingredients are always of the highest quality and I look forward to going back.",

    "text": "I travel to Vegas frequently for work and that usually includes infrequent memorable dining experiences. Based on proximity of meetings and entertaining clients I have been to dinners at places like Nobu, Mesa Grill, Olives, Delmonico, Cut, Craftsteak... the list goes on.  With the exception of Nobu, I think you can usually have good meal, some times very good, just nothing that's going to blow you away. Nothing that's gonna grab you and say, \"hey! look at me! forget the hot women (or men), loud craps table, and ringing slot machines. This is a meal you ain't gonna forget so pay attention!\"  I've had these before in Vegas (Raku), just not on the strip and especially not for around $100pp.  Enter Sage.  You walk past the Aria lobby and through a mini hallway. It seems as if Sage is hidden in some back room like a high roller's restaurant only. Even at the hostess counter you don't get visibility in to the restaurant. I immediately say to the hostess \"hey this place looks dead. are you sure I should eat here?\" With no hesitation she sassily responds with a giggle \"uh yaaaah, he kicks ass.\" Right there I know I'm good. I didn't even know the chef's name but from her comment \"he\" is someone that's gonna hook me up.  To make things easy my business partner and I went with the Signature tasting menu and added the yellowtail crudo cause hey I love yellowtail. You get a few choices for each course which allowed us to sample most of the dishes between the two of us.  The amuse bouche (which I don't remember) and the yellowtail were both not bad but are not what's going to bring me back.  What's bringing me back? Oysters! I'm an oyster fein and my goodness these might have been the best oysters I've ever had. People are going to slap me. I'm from the Pacific NW and I believe these were Kushis. There are a good amount of people who refuse to believe that Vegas can get fresh seafood. I guess they think only humans get transported via airplane. These oysters were amazingly fresh. They were semi-sweet, a tad briny, and  creamy. There was zero hint of fishiness. It was topped with a tabasco sorbet which was was inventive. I don't know what it was. The freshness. the tabasco sorbet. Something about these oysters blew me away. Instant jackpot!  The rest of the meal was outstanding. With 2nd course I got the pork belly. It was a really good cut with just the right amount of fat and lots of meat. I remember it being tender and moist, not dry like many other pork dishes. I also tried the scallops with oxtail which I do believe would've been the better option of the two. For the main course I had the beef belly (lots of belly in my belly!). This dish melts in your mouth. You could cut it with your fork. I know that beef belly isn't exactly the most expensive dish. Really, it's an offshoot of the short rib. But man, the way they do it here was top class. Great job.  I was drunk and full by the time dessert showed up so I honestly don't remember how good it was. I just remember enjoying some crispy tarts and a peach thingy. What I do remember is that Sage was impressive especially at $80 for the tasting menu. The hostess set the tone and the food carried it on. Sage has become my favorite restaurant on the strip. For those of you that think otherwise cause of some other places that start with Joel, e, or Guy... sorry I'm not a high roller and I don't think a restaurant that costs over $200pp that you can only dine once or twice can constitute as a favorite. Sage on the other hand I'll be frequenting.",

The cocktails are really good, and the dinner paired beer or wines are excellent. Even though the menu changes, the dinner my wife and I had was excellent until the desert. The \"deconstructed red velvet cake\" was awe-full. The smoked chocolate ice cream tasted like ash and chocolate. Too much smoke is an understatement for this one. We then ordered another desert, and that one was excellent. A nice ending to an otherwise great meal.",

    "text": "First thing you notice when walking into Sage, is how beautiful the space is.  It's divided into two sections, with a nice bar/lounge up front.  And the main dining room in the back.  We were seated in the main dining room & it was very nice & relaxing.    As I looked over the beer & wine list it reminded me of Rosemary's.  Then I remembered reading on another food blog that the sommelier Mike Shelter left Rosemary's to work at Sage.  From my experiences at Rosemary's Mike does a great job with the beer/wine pairings.  Even though the beer list looked superb, we ended up with a nice bottle of German Riesling with our dinner.  We placed our orders & were brought an amuse bouche & warm bread.  The bread (olive?) with house whipped butter & sea salt was very good.  For apps we shared the yellowtail crudo, black & blue tuna and roasted sweetbreads.  The yellowtail was good, not great (Raku is spoiled me!).  We really enjoyed the bluefin tuna and I loved the sweetbreads.  For mains we had the scallops & gnocchi.  Both were very good.  The scallops had a nice salted caramel sauce.  The gnocchi were light & just melted in your mouth.    For dessert we shared Canelles De Bordeaux & nice french press coffee.  The canelles were good, but the crust was a bit too tough.  Overall a very good experience & we will be back.  Maybe we will try the six course tasting menu, that they offered (whole table has to get it).",

    "text": "Wow, where do I start...a complete gastrogasm.  After my first couple of days in Vegas, I felt as if I was lacking a \"True\" five-star worthy experience....Sage satisfied that void in spades.  We went here on a Monday night and were seated after a two minute wait with no reservation.  Each member of my party went with the Tasting menu ($89), with my better half and I opting for the Australian Wagyu main upgrade ($15).  I went with the Wagyu Tartare, the Dayboat Scallops, The Australian Wagyu main, and the pistacio tart for desert.  We opted against the wine pairing ($59) or beer pairing ($44) in favor for some of their amazing looking cocktails.  Service from start to finish was near impeccable.  Our server (whose name escapes me) was alert, attentive, and extremely helpful.  He read the \"vibe\" of our table perfectly, in that he fed into our playful good mood by joking with us throughout the service (e.g. warning us about the strength of a cocktail using slurred speach, telling me upon ordering a third cocktail that 'rehab is for quitters').  Even the support staff was attentive, as my father paused to look for the restroom a staff member ran over and asked him if there was anything he could help him with.  There was the perfect mix of attentiveness without coming across as overbearing.  On to the food and drink.  The cocktails, while pricey ($16 per) were inventive and excellently prepared.  The wagyu tartar was excellent, with the aioli and finely chopped  onion adding just the right amount of flavor.  The buttered crostini were the perfect conduit for what was a delicious tartare.  The scallops was more like one large scallop cut in half.  It was good, though personally I'd recommend the octopus which another had in my party.  They Australian Wagyu main wasn't the best steak I've ever had, but it was definitely up there.  The sear was tremendous, and at several moments I had to close my eyes to savor just how good the melt in your mouth dish was.    The only hiccup on the night came with the delivery of dessert, which for some reason was inexplicably delayed compared to the other dishes.  I believe we had to wait a good 20 or so minutes after clearing our main for it's arrival.  Given that all of our courses were delivered with great timing up on to that point is seemed a bit odd.  Desserts were on par with the other courses, with a part of me wishing I had ordered the Gianduja Pave.  It wasn't that the tart was bad, it was just that the flavor of pistachio tends to be very light and I felt was overshadowed by the sweetness of the strawberrys on the dish.  Overall an unforgettable experience, and thus far my best dining experience in Vegas.  My better half dubbed it the \"best meal in her life\".  I can't give it that distinction, but it definitely deserves a spot in my top 5.  Highly recommended.",

    "text": "I was considering rating Sage as two stars, but the scroll-over says \"Meh, I've experienced better.\" That doesn't cut it. The proper description is \"Eek! Methinks not.\"  Where to start.. I came here with my girlfriend during our visit to Vegas (we live in Los Angeles). Although we're not poor, it's a meal we saved money for and were planning for -- lots of research on Yelp, mainly. And for the first time in a long, long time, Yelp let us down.  How do I describe this place... It's very pretty, but very little substance. This applies, actually, to most all aspects of our dining experience.   The decor is nice. It looks like a nice hotel, a bit like the Mandarin in New York. However, like a nice hotel, it has not warmth. You don't really walk in and feel comfortable. Don't get me wrong, it looks really nice, but a bit TOO styled. Doesn't seem to have feng shui. Maybe it's not fair to judge too harshly on that, but it does add to the experience.  The service was perfectly on point. That's not a good thing, in my opinion. We tried making jokes and chatting to our server, but he didn't really seem to know what to do. Everyone was just... cold. Even the general manager who came by seemed like he really didn't care in the slightest bit about us. These are not people you want in \"hospitality\".  Okay, let's move to the food. I don't understand how or why they did this, but they managed to ruin basically everything that looked exciting on the menu. The oysters were flat. I like mine strong. You know, salty, briny. These tasted sickly sweet. The spicy sauce on them only accented the lack of oystery goodness.   The foie gras, once again, was sickly sweet. Some sort of plum marmalade or something underneath it was totally unnecessary, and simultaneously took away from the flavor of the foie without accenting it or enhancing its flavor. The wine pairings for both of these were awful. They were too similar to the food, and ended up neither complimenting nor contrasting with it.  We had the scallops as well. They were good. The only thing besides the dessert that was. Well cooked, juicy and firm, and went well with the  wine. There was a pork belly that was quite bland and forgettable. A pork loin, Spanish iberico style, that just tasted like ham. This is about where I start to get hazy about the food. Needless to say, one dish blended into the next.  The portions -- tiny. Comedic. The tastes on the palate and pairings with wine -- forgettable, uninspired, and utterly unbalanced. The presentation -- pretty, but very little substance.  In a nutshell. If you don't care about your 300 something dollars, and thinking of something to splurge on because it's Vegas, this is the place to be. If you're looking for a 300 something dollar meal, go somewhere else.",

    "text": "Sage is tucked into a corner nearby the Aria hotel lobby. While it is not Michelin-rated restaurant, the experiences I've heard of about this restaurant have only been positive. I was looking forward to trying a meal here after missing a chance in my previous trip.  After approaching the hostess for a table at 7:30pm on a Sunday evening, we were led on a lengthy journey to our table near the back of the room by the wall. The room was spread out, with alternating dark curtains and mirrors, as well as some murals on the wall.  One of the best things about Sage is that the servers and hostesses were hardly pretentious despite being quite formal. I felt well taken care of without any hint of attitude or arrogance despite the fact that I was under dressed for the restaurant.   As for the food, the menu is quite varied and will likely appeal to a wide variety of people. One of the main ideas behind the restaurant is fresh ingredients, and some of the menu items are very appealing with that in mind.  We decided to start with a pumpkin soup, but were allowed to taste a spoonful of some sort of raw tuna appetizer, and it was tasty despite the fact that I don't particularly like any types of raw meats. The pumpkin soup was split for us and was absolutely delicious. It was pretty rich with pumpkin flavor and little bacon bits and a dab of sour cream that melted in.  For our main courses, we had a Mushroom Risotto and Braised Short Ribs. Both were extremely delicious, but we made the mistake of choosing two very rich dishes. We passed them back and forth.  The short ribs were fork tender with fantastic flavor. They were served in an interesting silver pan along with greens, a small potato side, and some fennel. I could only argue that it could have come with some more potato. The Mushroom Risotto was bursting with a variety of flavors, from the normal buttery rice, to a unique citrus burst, to the pumpkin mushrooms that were perfectly tender.  We were quite full, but I really wanted to try some sort of dessert, so we ordered a lemon-thyme semifreddo with roasted grapes and some sort of cookie on the side. The first bite was unbelievable - the flavor of the semifreddo was so delicious and its texture was unexpected.  Our server brought us some complimentary shot-glass of hot chocolate that basically was so strongly flavored it tasted as if it was literally milk chocolate melted down. It was a nice touch, and always appreciated to receive those little surprise treats.  Our experience at Sage was top-notch, and I would recommend it to anyone searching for a reasonably priced meal at a one-star Michelin level restaurant (though it is not rated, it has not technically been reviewed with that possibility since there is no 2010 Michelin review). Our bill came out to 89 dollars pretaxtip, which was definitely within reason as I actually liked the food more than what I had at Bradley Ogden during my last trip (which was very similarly priced).",

Then the food took so long that we could not get to our desserts we ordered.  Did they charge us for it?   Yes they did.    Please looks great and everyone here is nice and knowledgeable but only go here is you only plan to eat here for the evening.  it takes that long for the food to come out.  Plan on having at least 3+ hours for your meal.    Why a 2?  bc we told them up front we had to be somewhere.  we told the waiter that we had to be somewhere and he assurred us that everything would come out on time.  That being said and for them not to be able to get us our desserts and still charge us for it  - don't sound right.",

    "text": "I was admittedly finicky on the last night of our stay in Las Vegas (Monday). My friends had a buffet in mind, but I was determined to have some oysters.   Having bid our San Francisco contingent of friends adieu at Aria, we inquired if the Aria dinner buffett had oysters on hand. They had king crab legs, but no oysters. We had passed by Sage restaurant and saw they had an oyster appetizer and I was further intrigued by their vegetarian option menu (I am Pescatarian). My friends being good sports, said they would join me for drinks if I wanted to eat at Sage. I knew I was complicating dinner plans but what the hell, it was my birthday weekend after all.   Turned out to be a great decision. We toasted over Desert Shrub, Tea Rose, and Full Sail beer - all top notch libations. The Kusshi oysters were exactly what I had in mind and I made one friend a complete convert who never thought much of oysters (she's heading to an oyster restaurant this weekend). The server was friendly, attentive, and didn't mind that only one of us was ordering an entree.   I had the Sunchoke Tortellini entree upon our server's recommendation and found the dish to be utterly delightful. The tortellini melted in my mouth like clouds and the flavor - what incredible flavor. My friends tied themselves over by having a goat cheese beet salad and we all agreed to put Sage on our list of dining places for future trips to Vegas.   It was mentioned to us that the owners of Sage also have restaurants in Chicago - Spring and Green Zebra. I have dined at both but look forward to trying Green Zebra for dinner since I have only been there for brunch.   Overall, a great dining experience, next time we'll have to give Sage our full UNDIVIDED attention!",

I found the atmosphere and ambiance to be dreamy; accented with purple-blue lights along the walls, it is modern, elegant, intimate and chic. The service was excellent. There were several attendants throughout our dining experience for what seemed like each course we were served; however, our main server was James (excellent). Everyone was courteous and attentive and eager to please. As one example, there was a particular cherry in a cocktail that I liked---a brandied cherry---so two servers brought me some more on a plate! Yay! The house cocktail (I don't recall the name) is tasty, but you won't find it on the menu, you simply need to request the house cocktail. I loved, and I mean, \"ordered-it-TWICE-loved,\" the pink cashmere cocktail. It looks and sounds like a girly cocktail and maybe it is, but it is YUMMY (yes, CAPS YUMMY). The cuisine chosen from the signature tasting menu was absolutely delicious, particularly the heirloom beet salad and the scallops, but everything ordered and served was wonderful...photos follow for you... :-)!",

My main entree was the duck, which was pretty good! a solid 7.5/10! a bit dry but the flavor on the skin was very good, a very good mix with the beans (or whatever it was) on the side  Finally the desert, I had the passion fruit mouse a solid 9.5/10! very good! a perfect combination of tart and sweetness! very very good! I highly recommend it.   Overall the place was good, and the $50 menu was priced pretty fairly in my opinion. The soup definitely could be improved, but the bread in the beginning was good enough to make me pretty happy about this place.",

Our bachelorette party of 12 came here two weeks ago and I'm pretty sure we all walked away satisfied with our meal. For a party our size, the server said if one of us got the pre fixe menu, then all of us had to get the pre fixe menu. That was a bummer since some of us weren't as hungry as others. However, dollar for dollar, the pre fixe menu was a better deal even though portions are a bit smaller for each course.   They have two pre fixe menus with optional wine pairings. Pre fixe menu 1 had 4-courses and pre fixe mnue 2 had 6-courses. I forget the price difference, but we all ordered pre fixe 1 for $70~. That's a very reasonable price for Vegas and this type of bougie establishment.   Although the food was great, there was nothing extra special about this place. I am a bit disappointed that they did not make the bride-to-be feel extra special. In the past bachelorette Vegas parties I've been to, I've seen restaurants send a complimentary drink/shot to the bride-to-be. It's a nice touch that I think all nicer restaurants should do to make an evening more memorable so that people leave with a lasting impression.",

Overall my palettes were confused, too many flavors competing with each other. I love savory food, but this was overkill.  - Dark Stormy Night: Rum with Ginger Beer: Not a huge fan of ginger, but this tasted just right. - Gazpacho soup: compliments of chef. Felt like I should have bit into a fresh onion - Bread: sourdough that was very hard and bacon roll - Beef Tartare: the egg yolk made this dish creamy and yummy - Pear salad with shaved brussel sprouts and macadamia nuts: This dish could have used more pears. The sprouts were bitter, and the salt was heavy handed. Again more bacon - Rabbit wrapped in BACON: Noticing a theme here? This dish was actually pretty tasty. Hate to say it but it did taste like chicken.  - Seared scallops with braised beef: not too bad, I finished this entire dish - Beef belly: very fatty, which is the idea of this dish, but after one bite I had had enough. Way too rich - Crispy Pork: very tender - Soaked pear (not sure in what) with truffle ice cream - Pear was good, didn't care for the truffle ice cream - Hazelnut ice cream with chocolate coffee mousse/cake-  highlight of the meal - Warm Chocolate Soup: compliments of chef, too salty, took one sip and passed",

The decor is chic. and parts of the walls were lined with blown-up images of what reminded me of French Impressionist paintings. For starters, I highly recommend the fois gras creme brulee, and sweetbread. I'm not a big fois gras connoisseur, but I loved it in its creme brulee reincarnation. It is served with toasted brioche, which our waiter brought a second round since we devoured our first batch so quickly. The sweetbread dish had probably the best melt-in-my-mouth pork belly I've ever had. Perfect if you love strong savory flavors. For my main course I had the braised beef, and it was flawless. Tender tender.  I did not want this meal to end.  Naturally, I tried to drag this meal out as long as I could, so I got dessert. I had the deconstructed carrot \"cake.\" Very tasty but having a sweet tooth like mine, I thought it was a bit small. My boyfriend ended his meal with absinthe prepared the traditional way, complete with flaming sugar cube and all. Our waitress was very attentive, knowledgeable, and spot on with her recommendations. Great service overall.  Sage is not to be missed when in Vegas.",

Entree: MINES - GRILLED AMERICAN KOBE SKIRT STEAK:  I thought the steak was a little bit too overcooked, but the marinate of the steak was sensational and the avocado puree that was underneath the steak gave it more flavor.   HIS:  MAINE DAY BOAT SCALLOPS:  I just took a bite of this and it was okay for my taste buds but he enjoyed it,  We did order desserts but I forgot what we ordered, but i dont remember loving it too much.  However, after your meal is done they give you a \"complimentary dessert\" from the chef and we got was a chocolate shot and that single shot of chocolate was just perfect.

Service - 5 Stars Cleanliness - Excellent Price - $79.00/person for Chef Mcclain's Signature Menu Seafood - Yes, oysters, Pacific Yellowtail, tuna, cod, scallops, black bass, trout Meats - Yes, beef, venision, veal, chicken, etc Vegetables - Yes, salads. Dessert - Yes Fruits - Yes Other - (1) Located in the Aria Hotel, (2) Cash and Credit Cards are accepted here.  (3)  Chef Shawn McClain creates \"The New American menu laced with Mediterranean contexts.\"  (4) McClain has received the 2001 James Beard Foundation Best New Restaurant and 2006 Best Chef Midwest awards.  Appetizer:  Chicken Sausage (Complimentary) - A-Ok (3 Stars) - Quarter sized slice of chicken sausage served with jam and green bean.  If I was blind tested, I would not of known that it was chicken.  It definitely had the texture of a sausage but it was not as tasty as I thought it would be.  The only odd thing is that it was served cold.  Bacon bread and Sourdough (Complimentary) - So they have a guy walk around offering bread and you get a choice of bacon bread and sourdough.  My sister's fiance is a bread fiend so he asked for both.  I did the same not because I love bread, but I was worried I would leave hungry since these fancy places tend to serve small portions.  Trust me, get the bacon bread and it's for obvious reasons.  The bread comes with silky smooth butter and sea salts.  First Course:  Wagyu Beef Tartare - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 Stars) - Wagyu beef tartare with crush capered aioli, slow poached egg, pickled mustard seeds, and crispy chocolate.  This dish does come with a side of toasted bread.  Tasted great!  The texture reminds me of pate.  The soft, raw beef along with the slow poached egg made it really creamy and went well with the toasted bread.  Very generous portion of tartare--approximately 3\" in diameter and 1\" thick.  Second Course:  Bacon Wrapped Rabbit - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 Stars) - Bacon wrapped rabbit with heirloom carrots and roasted garlic ravioli with salsify cream and black truffle.  You get 3 pieces of bacon wrapped rabbit (3\" x 1\") and 2 ravioli (2\" in diameter).  The prominent flavor was the deep smoky bacon.  The rabbit tasted like regular white meat because the bacon was so overwhelming.  The roasted garlic ravioli tasted good as well, however it was bland because the smoky bacon would not leave your mouth.  Third Course:  48 Hour Beef Belly - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 Stars) - Beef belly that have been cooked for 48 hours with roasted chestnut puree, Brussel sprouts, and pickled sweet onions.  This beef was totally like butter--soft like it, you slice through it like it, and melted like it in your mouth.  The flavor is to remember because to this day I think about how wonderful it tasted.  Other beef will not be the same after you had this beef belly.  This is the beef you marry--we are soul mates.  Fourth Course:  Warm Apple-Fennel Strudel - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 Stars) - This is a deconstruction of apple-fennel strudel with hazelnut crumble and brown butter ice cream.  The apple was nicely sweet and warm and worked well with the smooth and creamy brown butter ice cream.  The paper-thin sheet of dough was crispy and flakey and gave the dessert a little added crunch and texture.  Complimentary:  White chocolate dessert shot - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 Stars) - Our waiter for the evening came by and brought this out stating it was the compliments of the chef.  It was served in a white ceramic shot glass.  It was served warm and was very rich and sweet.  It reminds me of the warm soy bean that is served for Taiwanese breakfasts.  The only main difference there is a spicy kick at the end.    The service and food is wonderful here.  I definitely recommend Sage as a must try whenever you are in Vegas.  You'll like the ambiance as well--very dim and warm lighting.  Plus, the area is very spacious and you will not be in the space of other diners.  Sage is a Woohoo! As good as it gets!",

    "text": "If Las Vegas has one unfair advantage over Los Angeles, it's the inclusion of foie gras on their menus. Ever since it was banned in CA, we've had to cross over to NV to get our foie fix, and Sage was an excellent choice for doing so. My wife and I decided to divide and conquer Chef McClain's Signature tasting menu for $89. Without going through every dish, I'll say these were the standouts; the Foie Gras Brulee (easily worth the $10 supplement and bordering on heavenly), Wagyu Beef Tartare, Grilled Spanish Octopus, Australian Wagyu Sirloin (an additional $15, but again, comes with foie) and for dessert, the Sweet Potato Pie with Angostura Bitters ice cream (someone needs to mass produce this ASAP, as it is awesome). Our server was excellent and I'd definitely consider returning.",

    "text": "After a less-than-stellar week, we really were looking forward to our weekend in Vegas, and since we were alone in Vegas on Friday night, I looked for a place that had an interesting tasting menu to go try. I'm really glad I found Sage.  We had a 7:15 reservation, and it wasn't really very busy when we were there, but it could have been that Vegas itself isn't insanely busy the weekend after New Year, as lots of other restaurants didn't seem that busy over the weekend either. But that didn't matter, because we had stellar service the whole night.  So we went for the eight-course tasting menu with wine pairings. They gave us an oyster as an amuse bouche, and it was absolutely delicious so we knew we were in for a great menu. They offer two types of bread: sourdough and a bacon roll. We tried both, but just moved on to the bacon roll when they returned because they were insanely good.  Of the courses, I think the first course of crab and yellowtail was probably the best one, but the next course of citrus poached foie gras was brilliant. Just the right amount of citrus. The wine pairings were pretty stellar as well. Desserts were top notch as well, and even though they opera cake dessert didn't at all resemble an opera cake (which was a shame to be honest, I get the concept of deconstruction, but there's more showmanship in an assembled opera cake that I was looking forward to), it was incredibly rich and awesome.  We also opted for the absinthe cart which was a treat. I've never seen it made, and it was a nice show. For me though, even though absinthe is traditionally one part absinthe to four parts water, I would have preferred a bit less water to give the flavor profile more of a punch. But I enjoyed it completely.  The only dip in service for the whole night was when the rabbit dish arrived and we had no wine, but they made up for it by giving us quite a bit extra of that wine given there was sediment and the wine arrived late. So, they made up for that completely.  Sage is amazing. If you want top-notch fine dining in Vegas come here. And enjoy yourself. Get the tasting menu.",

    "text": "Great wait staff and also hostess up front.  We all went with the two course which includes a starter and an entree.    Starters: Wagyu Beef Tartare: I was not a fan of this starter.  It's raw, similar to tuna tartare, but the smell and texture didn't make me stomach it too well.  I took a bite to taste and that's it.  Caution - not only is the Wagyu raw but there is a poached egg on top as well.  It seems this was a popular selection for many Yelpers, however I can vouch it was the least picked on dish at the table.    Roasted Veal Sweetbreads: This was a richer appetizer.  It was a perfect combination between \"filling/meaty\" and creamy.  I wouldn't order this dish again however.     Foie Gras Custard Brulee:  Wow.  If you enjoy foie gras and also enjoy creme brulee then try this!   I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't come back just to try this again. ;-) It's the perfect mix between sweet and salty. I would staple this as a must try at Sage.  Alaskan King Crab:  Light dish, cooked perfectly, flavors compliment each other, and if you're ordering a heavy and rich entree I would recommend this as a starter.  Entrees: Black Bass: Delicious!  Very filling and light dish.  Main Day Boat Scallops: I've ordered this before - and I'm ordering it again.  Trumpet mushrooms, oxtail, and a perfectly cooked scallop.  I can't ask for anything more.    I would definitely recommend Sage for tourist staying at the Aria.  Out of every other restaurant I've tried, this one is the most memorable.",

The ceilings are super high but with the chandeliers, artwork and different eating spaces, it really feels like a much smaller space.  The menu is a bit confusing.  There's an ala carte menu, a 4 course fixed price menu with choices, and an 8 course tasting menu (no choices).  We opted to order from the ala carte menu.  For my appetizer, I had the grilled Spanish octopus.  This was well made but not spectacular.  The octopus was tender but I prefer more char on it - mine was so devoid of char that I couldn't tell if it was grilled or not.  My entree was the 36 hour wagyu short rib.  This is cooked for 36 hours in a sous vide machine.  Delicious!  There's a large dessert menu and, of all things, an Absinthe menu!  Didn't think of it at the time, but I should have tried one of those... how often do you really get the chance  to try that?",

Unfortunately it was. The food was good but not great. The service was less than great.  For $200 a person with an auto gratuity we sat waiting at our table for 10-15min before the waitstaff stopped to ask what kind of water we wanted.  The tasting menu was not provided and we had to request it.  At the end we wanted to split the bill which was no issue but the waiter motioned to his watch and referenced timing when we asked that he run two credit cards and take the balance in cash.   Not a great experience to say the least.    The highlight for me was the scallops and desert.  Maybe we had a bad waiter and I ordered the wrong items at each course...regardless I left feeling full yet unsatisfied with the experience.",

    "text": "I was so tired upon completion of my late afternoon business meeting in Vegas that I was thrilled to have Yelp tell me that a 4.5 star restaurant was located off the lobby of my Vegas Strip hotel.  Sage was one of those magnificent, beginning to end experiences that allows heaping praise without hesitation, as so much going right cannot be coincidence.  I had an incredible first course of warm wild mushroom sald with pine nuts and black currants, washed down with a glass of sparkling Rose'.   I went high dollar for the entree--a few notches above most of the others in price at $43 and got the black cod, smoked grapes, pumpkin flan, a crisp of prosciutto and a few layers of Brussels sprouts.  I'm not kidding.  It was magnificent.  I savored every bite.  I was so pleased I did not want to spoil my palate with any sweetness or cappuccino.  I just wanted to savor the perfection on a plate I had just experienced in two short courses.  I was alone in town for work so I sat at the bar myself and had metronomic attention and delivery.  The skillful bartender knew, among the patrons eating at the bar, who to engage with and who to mindfully check on but let alone.  He was wonderful.  This was a topflight experience and if it is any indication of an average night, I unequivocally recommend it.",

That being said, on our trip to Vegas in May for our first anniversary we decided to make a reservation at Sage for our anniversary dinner.  We were so glad we did as everything we ate was nothing short of stellar.  To start my meal i ordered the Confit Heirloom Beet salad.  The toasted dates and vinaigrette dressing complemented the beets so perfectly.  Every bite was full of flavors and different textures, delicious. I ate every bite.  I was expecting the portion to be much smaller than it actually was, so I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived.  The complimentary amuse bouche was the best bite I have ever had.  I couldn't even tell you what it was, but it was delicious and I wanted more.  I ordered the Lobster Ravioli for dinner.  What a refreshing dish.  Not your typical ravioli dish filled with heavy cream making you feel like you have a rock in your stomach.  This was light with hints of lemon and sweet chunks of Maine Lobster. I ate every last bite.  Service was top notch, our waiter was one of the best I have ever had.  Attentive and spot on with his suggestions.  We will be back for sure",

I've always gone for the Signature Menu (~$89) with four courses.   Food: Amazing. Portion sizes are just enough to make you happy full, not Olive Garden full. Every bite has a plethora of different textures and tastes that complement each other -- I felt like I was commentating the Food Channel when I ate here with the bf. And not only that, it was different -- the tastes, and textures were completely things you have yet to try. Party in my mouth, indeed. From the complimentary plates (comes with every meal) to the bread to the dessert, I cannot rave enough about this place.   Service: Excellent. Informative, on hand when you need them, and always concerned with how we liked our meal.   Ambiance: It's not the place where it's so quiet, you'll want to whisper, but it's definitely a more trendy type of crowd. If I can be nitpicky, the tables for two were too long for a normal conversation as we had to shout over the table distance as well as over the music. Although most of the dinner was eaten in silence, we both knew our palates were in heaven.   Drinks are Vegas prices ($$$) and well made, but nothing to rush for. If you could do it, find a nice bottle of wine instead. (The list is pretty expensive, though -- cheapest probably started at ~$50) Overall, a nice dinner for locals.",

This \"door\" is the only thing you see from the casino floor, so the restaurant feels a little hidden. The dining area is modern and quiet (but not awkwardly so).  Our service was excellent from the hostess to the waiter to the bussers, and everyone was very knowledgeable when it came to the menu. The waiter suggested a virgin Moscow Mule for my pregnancy cocktail and the Empire State for my husband, who was interested in a rye cocktail. Both were spot-on.   For dinner, I got the pre-theatre menu, which I recommend to everyone. It's $49 for 3 courses (bargain), but only available from 5-7pm. I selected the pear & brussel sprout salad, the tilefish, and the pineapple mousse dessert. My husband went with the a la carte menu (not bargain) and got a mushroom salad (~$20) and the skirt steak (~$50). We also shared the beef tongue appetizer. I have never tried beef tongue and have always been apprehensive about biting into something that seems so chewy and just weird, but I was so glad we got this. The meat was served in little cubes with rye toast, celery, and white beans, and was awesome. I could have eaten twice as much. If you're waffling on trying tongue, this is an excellent way to start! Both of our salads were delicious - the brussel sprout/bacon/pear combination tasted great, but seemed kind of standard. The mushroom salad, on the other hand, was really unique. The mushrooms were so hearty, they actually tasted like meat! And there were so many different mushrooms, all with different tastes. The skirt steak was awesome, served in a sweet-ish sauce with these fried sweet potato ball things, which were also awesome. The disappointment of the night was probably the tilefish - it was good and all, just not anything to wow me. I guess they probably did all you can do with tilefish. The dessert, however, was incredible. The plate had pineapple mousse, little bites of pineapple cake, pineapple ice cream, and actual pineapples! Oh yeah, drizzled with some kind of pineapple-y sauce. Don't be scared, though, it wasn't overpowering at all, just delicious! I wished I could have sat and slowly savored each little bite, but I had to hurry a little to make it to the show on time!  I had been saving Sage as a special-occasion, expensive kind of night out, but it doesn't have to be. If you come in early for the pre-theatre menu or just hit the bar for happy hour apps & drinks, you can get out for $150 for 2 people. Additional tip: all wine (ALL!) is half off for locals on week nights!",

    "text": "I was in Vegas last weekend for a bachelor party, and we decided that we'd dine at Sage for one of the nice dinners we were having. Sage came as a recommendation by a friend who currently works as a chef in Vegas. The overall ambiance was good, and I liked that it wasn't overcrowded by tables and rowdy diners, yet wasn't too stuffy and quiet that you can hear a pin drop. We were definitely on the louder side, but that's what you get when you have nine guys drinking wine and scotch.  The $89 tasting menu is definitely a good deal, with plenty of viable options to choose from. There were actually couple items on the tasting menu that was not available on the a la carte menu. Unfortunately we had some friends who are rather picky eaters, and the tasting menu requires full table participation. Sage also offers a 10 course chef's tasting menu.  Vancouver Island Kushi Oysters - we ordered a plate to share for the table and ended up getting another. One of the best oysters I've had in a really long time. The Kushi oysters were incredibly fresh with a hint of sweetness in each shell. The mignonette served on the oyster is what really made this dish work. I usually find mignonettes too overpowering with vinegar. The aged tequila mignonette was undertoned and let you taste the natural sweetness of the oyster.  Grilled Spanish Octopus - this was the main starter that I ordered after contemplating getting the foie gras creme brulee. Coming from LA, I really miss my foie. But after talking to the waiter about how the foie was prepared, I wasn't really sold on it. I'd much rather have a hearty piece of foie seared on a pan on a toast. The octopus was cooked well but nothing was very memorable with it.   Snake River Farms New York Strip - not your typical dry aged steak from a steakhouse, but cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. I saw beef marrow on the list of ingredients so I was expecting a nice grilled beef marrow with a toast on the side, but I guess they put it in the sauce that they cover the meat in. I wasn't a big fan of the sauce as I like to enjoy my meat the way it is, but it wasn't terrible. The quality of the meat definitely made the dish work. La ratte potatoes were also excellent. May have been one of the smoothest mashed potatoes I've ever had.  Coconut Key Lime Float - I usually opt out of dessert and finish the meal with an espresso, but since everyone was getting something I felt compelled to order something as well. The coconut key lime float was recommended by the waiter as I was looking for something that was not too sweet. This ended up being the most creative and interesting dish of the night. The entire dessert comes on a bed of ice and they pour shishito pepper foam over the coconut and the key lime sorbet. The shishito pepper was foam was really interesting. You wouldn't expect a very peppery taste profile would go well with dessert, but it cut the tartness of the key lime and added great flavor to the somewhat mild coconut.  Overall we had an excellent dinner and everyone left very satisfied. One hiccup was that the restaurant overcharged us by $600. They somehow messed up and included one of the other table's orders on our bill. Good thing that I had caught it, if not some lucky table would have had a free meal on us. It took the restaurant almost 20 minutes to sort everything out, which, in my mind, is entirely too long of a wait to fix a wrong. No apologies were given either, which was very surprising. Perhaps Aria could work on training their service staff a little more.",

The menu is small, and most what I had was crafted deliciously, and it looks like pride is taken in making the food.  Favorite appetizer was the grilled octopus.  It is served with potato puree, what a great and unique complement to the seafood.  Favorite main dish was the flank steak.  Good lord what a dish.  So tender you don't even need a knife.  It's one of those dishes that you want again as you write a review, I hate that feeling!!  Service as you will read is spot on.  My one dish that I wouldn't order is the pork loin.  So salty, not sure if it is meant to be like that.  Still gets an easy 5 though.  The restaurant doesn't act pretentious, and keeps it simple.  I love that.",

Upon first stepping foot in the restaurant I was blown away by the high ceilings, and dim lighting...very sexy chic...very Veags. Our watier was very attentive and offered drink and food suggestions. In the end, I ordered the taylor gold pear and shaved brussels sprouts and the braised veal cheeks. Both dishes were beyond excellent. The veal melted in my mouth and with a combination of polenta the dish was perfect. The portion sizes were just right I wasn't stuffed by the time we left and even had room for a few drinks.   Even though the meal was on the expensive side I would definitely say it was worth the money for anyone looking to have a fantastic meal in Vegas.",

    "text": "We made a last minute reservation at Sage before seeing Zarkana. As it was a Saturday, most of the restaurants were already booked, limiting our options. We were seated promptly (only had to wait a few minutes past arriving) at a quiet table in the corner. After briefly going over the menu, our waiter disappeared for a short period (checking in with the table next to us twice in this time frame). We chalked it up as him trying not to rush us.  After ordering our drinks, we decided on the two course meal. My girlfriend opted for the slow poached egg, while I had the roasted pear. The pear was a decent dish, but the egg was really lacking. Besides having little flavor, the truffle on top was of a foamy consistency, mirroring that of saliva. Coupled with it being a comically sized serving, our early impressions of the food weren't too favorable.  The main courses came a short while later, chicken and venison. Both of these dishes were enjoyable, albeit in very conservative portions. For others eating here, it definitely seems that they are geared towards multiple small courses. I would certainly recommend the option for at least three courses per person, as the portion sizes are very small.  The restaurant was kind enough to remove the poached egg from the bill. In summary, I feel that there are much better options in and around the Aria for dinner, especially in this price range.",

    "text": "Delicious!  We had a reservation for 13 girls for my sister's bachelorette and we all went with the Signature Tasting Menu.  Sage was very accommodating and held our reservation even though half of our girls were over half an hour late.  I had the Moscow Mule, which I LOVED that they served it in a little copper mug with crushed ice.    Our server was amazing.  I forget her name but she provided us with excellent service along with the rest of the staff.. especially the busser!  For my first course, I had the Market Oysters.  The flavors melded really well together and I thought the presentation was fantastic.  I loved that the oysters were set up on a bed of sea salt.  I also had a taste of the Wagyu Beef Tartare (delicious!) and the Spring Asparagus Salad that the other girls were having.  Second course, we all chose the Maine Dayboat Scallops except for one girl who decided to try the Bacon-Wrapped Rabbit Saddle.  The scallops were phenomenal! You get 2 enormous, entree-sized scallops.  The portion was so big that barely any of us could finish it.  I was dying to try the next 2 courses so I knew I had to save some more room.  The scallops were seared perfectly.  I am normally not a scallop fan, but this dish definitely changed the way I think.  I am also not a big fan of rabbit either, I haven't had it in years.. but it was pretty good.  Scallops were way better though :)  Third course, I had the Wagyu Australian Sirloin.  Wow.. practically melted in my mouth.  You can see the marbling of the fat throughout the meat, which was cooked perfectly.  I would say the only negative thing about this dish was that it was too salty.  The sirloin was so delicious though, I couldn't help myself but to eat the entire plate even thought it was on salt overload.  Dessert..  we all went with the Gianduja Pave. Yum! I'm more of a savory person than a dessert person, so I only had a taste of this.  Delicious!  I loved the olive oil pairing with it.  Just added the right amount of flavor to the chocolate.  I would definitely come back and try out the rest of this menu and some other drinks.  This place was absolutely fantastic.",

    "text": "I don't go out much or get to.. to say the least, but Sage.. saved me from every aspect of isolation of a homebody. Nestled in Aria Hotel, on the casino level by the front desk, adjacent from Julian Serrano. The array of deep, neon hues of purple awaits as you walk by the bar and into the main dining room. Three words to describe the ambiance: Sultry, sexy, and sooooothing. The bar and lounge area is quite inviting. I wouldn't mind at all having my meal there.   My classy date and I were greeted by a kind, smiling lovely hostess named Alexis. I appreciate that so much, since the warm welcoming gives a great start to a wonderful dining experience.  We were then escorted in by the assistant manager and even pulled out the table and chair for us. My Oh my it just gets better and better!!!   This was my first time trying a Signature Tasting Menu and honestly, I couldn't be more excited and thrilled to be able to share this experience with someone that loves great creations of food as much as I do. *Sigh I'm so happy... We tasted everything, shared everything, and that in itself meant Everything to me.   The 1st Course: WAGYU BEEF TARTARE  w/ Pickled Mustard Seeds. Crushed Caper Aioli , Slow Poached Egg, & Crispy Chocolate  -Extraordinary. By far the best beef tartare I ever had. The presentation itself was breathtaking and simply a work of art. Once you mix the egg with beef, the texture is ever so creamy. After my first bite, combining everything even the piece of thin, airy chocolate on top of a tasty olive oil infused, crispy brioche toast. I was singing.. Isn't she lovely... yeeeeees. All the ingredients, solid flavors were bursting with surprise in my mouth. It's nothing like I ever tasted before. If this is how it feels when you fall in love... I'm deeply in love.  We also went all out and substituted for yes..... the FOIE GRAS BRULEE!!! The soft, slightly salty brioche muffin contrast with the richness of the foie gras.. make whoopie by eating this. A very sensual dish. This hypnotizing flavor is all new to me..  dizzy in love again.. perhaps that was the champagne?! Reggie, our sommelier was informative and great.   The 2nd Course: BACON- WRAPPED RABBIT       English Pea Ravioli/Nueske Bacon, & Sweet Onion Sauce - Vibrant green colors.. gave away this freshness to the eyes. Beautiful dish. Every single element in this entree were magically paired to one another. It was as if you were eating your favorite song. Rabbit.. oh Rabbit.. I love you... Damn it.. I do. *hitting the dining table with my fists... gawd I want more and more of you. Addicted..  MAINE DAYBOAT SCALLOPS  Braised Oxtail/Wild Mushrooms, & Salted Caramel Reduction -My favorite seafood.. Scallops! Cooked to perfection, tender, juicy, and oh so damn succulent. Forget day dreaming.. I fantasize about this dish. Can't get enough of it. I want this dish and I want it Bad. Delicious!  The 3rd Course:  We both ordered... 48 HOUR BEEF BELLY   Shaved Purple Asparagus/Ramp-Sorrel Puree, & Pickled Ramps/Toasted Almond - Very rich and the depth of flavor is endless. Extremely tender and effortlessly melts in your mouth. This isn't for the faint of heart, but for a heart of gold due to the luxuriance of the meat. Happily satisfied :)  The 4th course: GIANDUJA PAVE  Olive Oil Ice Cream, Hazelnut Crunch, & Basil Jam -Odd combination, but it was the best ending to such an amazing, memorable dinner. Again, everything I tasted was like a stimulating, new fairy tale story. It made such a profound impact of how I felt at that present moment and I could say... I could have fallin' in love. I never knew food could alter the way I feel and gosh darn it... I felt So beyond special. I never smiled so bright. My tummy was beaming!   We were also offered complimentary breads in the beginning of sourdough or bacon bread. Bacon, by far was it for me and the whipped, creamy butter with sea salt .. yes another smile on this face. *sigh We also did the wine pairing with our Tasting :) I could cry out of joy from this experience. Pure bliss... Maybe since the flavors and simple ingredients were like traveling and exploring a new country.. a first for me. I was just stunned and even turned on by how delicious this restaurant was. The dim, cozy decor, and colors makes this ideal for a perfect Romantic date. I seriously couldn't be more pleased and happy. I love the fact my date has great taste in food and loves exploring as much as eating. Great company and great food can definitely lead to great things ;) The service was exceptional, top notch, 5 solid stars... The GM, Robert was ever so personable, funny, and kind by checking up on us throughout our evening. Our servers, runners, bussers, all worked smoothly together and made this one of the best dining experience I ever had in my entire life. Thank you. That being said.. This is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas and I can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "Can a single meal completely change your perception of fine dining?  Can a single meal radically alter your relationship with food in general?  I think it can -- and Sage proves it.  After my dinner here, I'll never look at food quite the same way again.  To say it was my favorite meal in Las Vegas would be an understatement.  It would be more accurate to say it was one of my top meals of *all time*.  It began with an 8pm reservation for two.  Sage, located in the Aria hotel, has a relatively unassuming entrance, but that belies that grandeur to be found inside.  The restaurant is immense, with high ceilings, sumptuous furnishings, and a gorgeous color scheme with lots of golds accents and stunning chandeliers.  Needless to say, Sage is just as much a feast for the eyes as it is for the taste buds.   After we were seated, our incredibly friendly and kind server, John, came by with the breadbasket.  We each had the sourdough roll and a bacon brioche -- and both were excellent.  They were served with sea salt (served on a tablespoon) and whipped butter.   Deciding what to order was easy as pie -- we both had the 4-course tasting menu ($79).  My dinner companion splurged on the wine pairing ($39).  Our server's wine pours were *very* generous -- a lot more than the advertised half glass per course .  In fact, I was able to enjoy some wine with every course without bothering to order the wine pairing myself.   Below is a run-down of everything that we ate.  Absolutely everything was cooked and presented with the utmost class and sophistication.  The refinement of this dinner was unlike anything I'd previously experienced.  **AMUSE BOUCHE ... PRE-DINNER** A shot glass of gazpacho.  Fresh and tangy.  A wonderful starter.  **COURSE #1** Wagyu beef tartare with buttered crostini.  Easily the finest tartare I've ever had.  The beef was unctuous and fresh; the egg only added to the indulgence.  Chocolate shavings provided an unexpected layer of complexity.  **COURSE #2** Seared Maine dayboat scallops with broccolini, braised oxtail, mushrooms, and caramel reduction.  The scallops were cooked beautifully and fall apart when touched with a fork.  The broccolini was tender.  The caramel sauce provided an intriguing sweetness that contrasted against the saltiness of the shellfish.  **COURSE #3** 48 hour beef belly with braised apples.  I've never had beef this tender and succulent in my life.  Each bite dissolves on your palate and overwhelms you with flavor.  Apples provide a gentle acidity that works well against the umami of the beef.  **COURSE #4** Pistachio tart with strawberry ice cream.  A culinary work of art -- oodles of individual components meticulously arranged.  Bold, fresh flavors all over the plate.  An enjoyable juxtaposition of hot and cold.   **AMUSE BOUCHE ... POST-DINNER** Hot white chocolate with mint and coconut, served in a white porcelain shot glass.  A sweet, uplifting treat at the end of a fantastic meal.  After this meal, I wasn't just full and satisfied -- I was exhilarated, knowing that I had a world-class gastronomic experience.  The staff at Sage earned every penny of their tip.  This isn't the sort of meal I can have everyday -- but it's worth doing once in a while, if for no other reason to remind yourself that fine dining can truly be life-changing.  If you subscribe to the \"you only live once\" philosophy, than a dinner at Sage is a must.",

Picked the Valentines chef selected menu and was very excited. The first appetizer  was great as well as the second course. When the main course came, it was a huge portion of lamb chops. Both mine and my husbands were undercooked. We sent both plates back. When they came back, they were more done but at that point, we opted to leave and skip the final dessert course. Because we agreed to do a wine pairing , this meal and experience was overpriced at nearly 600.00 and disappointing.  No mention was made to make up for the meal in anyway. We left feeling a bit taken advantage of . My advice, proceed with caution.",

We never had to wait more than 90 seconds after we thought of something we wanted -the servers must have been standing nearby waiting. I'd go back for sure.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed eating here. We had a group of 4 and arrived fairly late on a weeknight. It was pretty empty inside with maybe 3 or 4 other tables being occupied. The restaurant itself is GORGEOUS and incredibly spacious. I was a huge fan of the decor and atmosphere. It was quiet and dimly lit, with beautiful purple candle lights on every table. The entrance to the kitchen and staff areas are covered with a huge golden curtain that spans across the back of the restaurant. When you first enter the restaurant, you have to walk through a large wine display, where 100s of wine bottles are arranged in aisles.       The food itself was also delicious. I like to try pork belly everywhere I go, and Sage had the best pork belly I have ever had. I had the Black Bass as my entree and it was also very good. I will definitely be back in the future. The only complaint from the table, came from a regular who goes there often, he said they haven't changed their menu in several years so there wasn't anything new he could try. I did not pay the bill or even see it, so I can't comment on pricing.",

We made reservations ahead of time. It was my fiance and I and two of our friends. We were able to get a nice seat in the front of the restaurant. The ambience is awesome. It's dimly lit and sexy. We had a server who may have either been having an off night or was new to the service industry. We had a really hard time tracking him down the entire night. Every time we ordered something it wtook a really long time for it to get to us. We ended up being there for over two hours. We were just trying to get something somewhat quick to eat. We realized it was fine dining but we didn't want to be there all night. Also, they serve you bread and the bread was delicious. We opted out of appetizers but definitely ordered cocktails. I ordered a martini and when it came to me only half of it was full. But it was still about $16. Full price, half full. My fiance and I split a seafood dish, and you could barely taste the fish because the sauce was so heavy. It literally and figuratively put a bad taste in my mouth. I wouldn't come here again for the food or the cocktails because at this restaurant, unfortunately the glass is half full. The prices are high, the service isn't great, I will give it an A+ for environment and that's about it. Sorry Sage.",

Started with the carrot salad. There were too many different flavors on the plate, it was muddy because of that, editing would help this dish. I then had the poached egg, which itself was fine, however the crostini that came with it was too greasy and I couldn't eat it. Also, sometime during our meal our water glasses were refilled from a pitcher of old smelly water, it smelled fishy. My stomach is still upset, not sure if it was the greasy bread or bad water.",

We originally had a reservation for 15 but after 2 nights of bottle service and day drinking, only 8 of us made it out this evening. They accommodated us well.   Ambiance was nice. Dark. Wonderful acoustics playing with cellist and guitarist. Pop music. Classical music. So talented. It was a bit chilly in there and they accommodated us again.   Had a delicious cocktail with ice cubes made of mint or cucumber so it was deliciously potent. I like how the cocktail menu divides cocktails in terms of refreshing, sweet, crisp etc. The waiter was helpful with deciding what to get and at the end graciously split our check between the different couples.   We ordered the foie gras brulee. Served with sweet brioche, which they brought us more of. Creamy, salty, rich foie gras topped with sweet carmelized sugar. Delicious. Steak tartare, which was a pretty generous serving.   My husband ordered the scallops. Cooked to perfection. Delicious. It was their signature item and featured on billboards, which we happened to see and looked exactly like how it was presented. I ordered the black bass. Tender. Served with crispy skin. Over farro. Good textural differences.   Loved it. Will definitely be back.",

We shared two portions of the beef tartare and that was enough for 4 people especially if you ask for more bread. We then ordered a bottle of wine and a few drinks. The drinks were  and I would say one of the best features of this place. We then ordered our entrees and most of us had the Wagyu steak medium rare. On the inside the steak was cooked just right. The seer was too much and a little on the burnt side. I had the scallops which was supposed to be the best and I agree the scallops were good but the sides and the sauces composing the rest of the plate were severely lacking. If that were different, It would have made the dish worth the value. The service on the other hand was mixed. The runners and busboys were all really good and attentive. The actual waitress was the worst I've seen at a nice restaurant. She lacked the skills to be able to successfully provide good recommendations and service us to the level of this restaurant.   Service: 2 stars for the main waitress. 5 stars for the supporting staff   Food: beef tartare was great! Wagyu could have been better and the scallops were good and could be much better with upgraded sides   Ambience: 5 star ambience! Great decor and surroundings   Drinks 5 star top notch drinks and options",

The steaks and other pasta dishes the table enjoyed were amazing and everyone at the table felt like they had he best meal of their trip in Vegas.

Was not disappointed because it had a nice amount of seafood and it was very flavorful and overall I enjoyed it.  For my main course I went with the spinach lasagna.  I don't regret this at all.  Flavorful...   sauce and everything hit the spot.  This was a winner.  For dessert I had the tiramisu.   Not the best I've ever had but definitely was something I would order again.   My friends went with the creme brulee and they all seemed to be big fans of it.  The margarita pizza was not impressive looking but I didn't try it so I can't comment on the flavors.   Most of the people that I was with got the meat, cheese and olive thing for their app and they devoured it.   The portions for the prefix menu were the same as for the regular menu.   If I was ever on the strip again with a group of people and had to eat there, I would definitely recommend this place",

    "text": "A special occasion restaurant that's trendy AND spendy, Sage should be your first choice when dining at Aria.  Our server JBond (!) was sweet and professional. A sign of a good server shouldn't only tell you about the specials of the night, but actually to make those things sound so delectably good, you'd want to order everything!  All our choices were on point: nothing lacking in seasoning, everything cooked to perfect the temperature, portion is just right.   Sweetbreads is something that I'll never make at home, so I always order it whenever I see it on the menu. I wish this one was a bit more crispier, but the polenta soaked up all the juices from the sweetbreads and the thick cut of glazed bacon was something I really loved.   The bf's seared scallops were large circles of luxuriously soft goodness.  My lamb saddle was braised to perfection, capturing all the flavor of the meat being super tender.   Their amazing signature dish, the Foie gras brulee, deserves all the hype that everyone on yelp mentions. Generous serving of foie topped with caramelized bits of sugar, cherry coulis and thick sweet-salty brioche tops. I'm sad that foie gras is now banned in California, but Sage gives me a reason next time to come back!  We didn't order dessert since we were saving room in our bellies for more cocktails (go figure!) at a lounge later on.  But our server was so sweet, he sent us complimentary white chocolate mugs to end our meal on a sweet note.  Sage is worth every pretty penny. Highly recommended!",

    "text": "One of my favorite dinners in a very long time.  Very unique combinations of flavors I wouldn't normally order but was so happy with 90% of our selections! We practically ordered the entire menu and with just 4 of us we were shocked at how very little we wasted.   Starters - Kushi oysters had a great spice to them!  Beef tartare was delicious. Veal sweetbreads were tasty and reminded me of pork rinds lol but I love that flavor so I liked them. Poached egg was tasty with the truffles and the crunchy bread they serve it with is very yummy to dip into the egg.  Grilled octopus was so tender and the spinach and chorizo combo was amazing and I'm not even a fan of octopus!  That was one of my favs of the night but I'm a sucker for chorizo.   The king crab asparagus salad was amazing - loved the citrus dressing, I also didn't know the crab would be tempura style so that was Delicious Artichoke salad was very good the iberico ham & snap peas tasty.   Entrees- the gnocchi were good but I was distracted by the awesome pork belly that came with them My favorite entree was the rabbit, 1st time I ever had it and it was Amazing.  The braised leg was so amazing the flavors and cooked to perfection.  The confit shoulder tasted like fried chicken heaven.  Salmon was very good with the couscous and veggies.  I didn't care for the veal cheeks, Just not my thing. Hubby had Wagyu short rib so I only had a small piece but was very tender and flavorful as most are.   Favorite desserts, we had quite a few and I loved the foie gras candy bar tasted like a snickers!  Lemon Meyer cheesecake always love.  Didn't care for bread pudding, but once again not my thing.  Strawberry shortcake good but just ordinary. Cheese platter was great.",

I chose the wagyu beef tartare with slow poached egg and chocolate, Maine dayboat scallops, the 48 hour beef belly and the lemon pie with chartreuse gelee, pistachio ice cream and toasted marshmallow.  My favorite of the meal was the wagyu beef tartare. Very tasty and salty, but I love salt. The scallops and the beef belly were pretty good as well. I'm not saying this was a bad meal by any means, but it didn't blow me away. I feel that the meal was more about the presentation and look.",

If you looking for a nice romantic night out i'd definitely recommend this place.  We tried quite a few different dishes. The first were the chilled oysters, served with their own style hot sauce, very good. My favorite dish was the beef carpaccio, which usually you would expect the raw meat to be a thin layer, but this is more like ground beef compacted into a circle. Served on top of the beef was a lightly cooked but raw quail egg, served along side two bread crisps.   For our entrees, i had the RABBIT! It was the oddest thing on the menu but it did not taste odd. I asked the server what it tasted like and she said chicken. Which she was not wrong, it was was moistly cooked and the consistency was like chicken, but the much thinner than the usual stringy-ness that chicken has. My friend had a crab salad, i didn't get to try it though :(",

I made reservations a few weeks ago for an early Valentine's Day date. And honestly, I can't say I've been more disappointed in a restaurant on the strip.   We got there early and sat at the bar to wait. We could barely get the bartenders to wait on us. We had to ask for drinks twice, and they never brought the water.   We got our table, and the waiter was super bizarre. He seemed very unsure of himself and his job. He was very jittery...like he was in training. You would expect seasoned waiters. We were also seated with no menus. Once he brought them 5 minutes later, he never explained and walked off. We already had scotch, and we had to ask him for a liquor menu. He brought us the wine menu. These are things you should never have to ask for.  We did the 4-course meal. And each item was good. Honestly? The best thing we had was their bread. Haha. And their scotch selection was awesome.  The worst part: it took almost an hour to get our second course. We were starving. If you see on the pics, the servings are smaller. And I'm a small person, but I can eat. That to me, is a long time to wait for a course. The last two came out faster.  The best dish I had? Maybe the Wagyu filet? It was good. I think it's the first time I don't feel like going into detail about the food.   Also, the staff here was not great. Each time we got up to walk to the restroom (lots of times because we were there for almost 3 hours...) each waiter would walk in front of us, and cut us off. Literally. They would rush in front of us. No matter where I've been to dine, this almost never happens. Especially when they have a tray of food. Most of these people weren't even looking out for customers. Insane.   We've been to so many places on the strip and spent the same kind of money for special occasions. We spent around $400 total. And I'm sorry, but jesus. I would really love to expect a phenomenal experience for service and food. Especially because we were recommended on both.  I feel even worse because I referred another friend to this place last week. She said she pretty much had the same experience as me. Horrible.  I can't even tell you how melancholy I was leaving for home last night. Boo.",

So remember when Harry and Sally (Movie: When Harry met Sally) were at the diner? And Sally was faking an organic experience in front of Harry?  Well......you won't be faking NOTHIN' at this place. Da-yum! The foie gras was silky and light and not too sweet nor savory. I mean perfect balance. And the brioche....uhm....can I get more of that please? Ok, now visually it wasn't stunning, but shoot, if everything has to look good, then I wouldn't eat half of what I've eaten up to this point.   Now, here's the tip of the day: when you layer the brulee on top of the oxtail crostini, get ready for a mind blowing experience. Who needs steak? OK OK I do love steak, but like I said, I only tried 3 dishes. I'm on a food hop experience with my friends. So combining those two elements...super awesome!  Have fun and happy eats to you!",

    "text": "Almost two years after my first visit to Sage, I made a return visit to have the Iron Chef America menu that Chef Shawn McClain's made and served the judges on last week's (9/5/12) Iron Chef America.  Chef McClain challenged Iron Chef Forgione and McClain won handily.  They are serving the menu this week only at Sage--tomorrow being the last day.  I really like this restaurant--the food, the decor, and the general ambiance.  Onto the meal.  I'm glad Chef McClain does not shy away from salt.  There's soft butter served with a small container of sea salt.  Several of the dishes had a salt flavor that enhanced the food.  My server and I spoke about this for a bit and he agreed with me about using salt.   Course 1: Dinner started with whelk toast with a tropical sangrita.  The sangrita was flavored with padron pepper. ginger, and lime.  There was a nice kick from the padron pepper.  Very refreshing beginning.  The whelk toast was very good.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog#E6mV80XbGYsn1m4UlhTzjg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU...</a>  Course 2:  This was sashimi of Hawaiian nairagi.  The nairagi was in small roll like curves and had some sea salt crystals on the outside.  The sashimi was on coconut puree with shaved hearts of palm, and togarashi cured pineapple.  The pepper flavor with the coconut and pineapple was fantastic!    <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog#HaXdWtg8SkxXD1ewW5REjA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU...</a>  Course 3:  Whelk ceviche with green zebra tomatoes, avocado espuma, and green mango.  What a complex mix of flavors.  Everything went well together and the whelk and tomatoes were wonderful!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog#SizPEw_4IWsPxinOsrf02Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU...</a>  Course 4:  Lemongrass coconut soup.  There was a tempura fried prawn on the soup, the \"noodles\" were made of young coconut, and it was given an extra flavor kick with Thai basil.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog#kZjlT7E5fkJuDLo-nGK_-g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU...</a>  Course 5:  Braised pork belly.  This was served with sweet coconut rice, thin slices Iberico ham with glazed pineapple.  There was a peppery flavor to the pork belly and it was such a great counterpoint to the pineapple's sweetness.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog#EVSglQBj0DdpcRCVHaofMQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU...</a>  Dessert:  Creamy white chocolate with coconut.  This was a white chocolate soup.  The white chocolate was in a small pitcher and the server poured the liquid chocolate over the rum-compressed pineapple and sweet tapioca that were in the bowl.  There was also a serving of mango sorbet.  The tapioca was cooked to perfection, the white chocolate was addicting and the pineapple was great!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog#FXHKG6FMdEU6pvNAjeLJ_Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU...</a>  Lastly, at the end of meals at Sage, the server brings a small container of hot chocolate that has both banana and caramel mixed in.  What a delightful reverse amuse-blouche with which to end your meal.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU31meK0bqAD7922sCog#yPSJUmfus3MsIpUvR9TYpg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/f9sU...</a>  Service was exemplary as I knew it would be.  When my iced tea glass was low, a server brought me another glass.  No asking, no waiting--just excellent service.  My head server was James and we chatted about the contest and how everyone had kept the results secret for almost a year since the show was taped.  James was excellent!  I hope he's working when I'm there again.  What a treat to live in a city to have such fine chefs as Shawn McClain!  Another pleasant meal at Sage.  And, I will be back for another one--soon I hope.",

Sage is located inside the Aria Hotel and Casino. It's very pretty and more upscale compared to some of the other casinos I went to. This place is fabulous once inside - very elegant, high end, lighting was dimmed, and had a purple tint to it making it very alluring. I liked both sides to Sage. The architecture, the pictures on the wall, the decor, and lighting was amazingly picturesque! It has a very sleek/sexy, cozy, and romantic vibe. I wish I had drinks at the bar initially but we had a show to catch. For drinks I had one of the martinis, for the appetizer we ordered Kusshi oysers {(6) piquillo pepper and tobasco sorbet / aged tequila mignonette}, for my entree I had the black bass {faro caponata / baby artichoke / bacon vinaigrette / barigoule sauce}. My friend ordered the Wagyu Filet. A comment about the bass - you must be a regular seafood and fish eater to enjoy this. It does have skin on it but I liked it very much. If you aren't use to seafood then I would try something else. I sampled my friend's Wagyu and it was excellent. The waiter was very attentive and nice. The greeters at the stand were also friendly. This place is a must as far as trying out high end, classy restaurants. After not being impressed at Trevi my dining experience here was above and beyond exceeded. Loved it!",

How excited I was being a passionate wine lover and having had the rare chance to visit some of the finest and exclusive wineries in Boudreaux &Napa. My knowledge of wine is far limited as compared to that of a Master SOMM. When I can save up a few shillings I take the opportunity to indulge my senses (with the family) and get pampered in the culinary arms of world renowned (Michelin) chefs where the service is usually bar none and with it put the local SOMM to the test.    There are hidden treasures and with this is the opportunity for me to get a chance to experience through the help of a SOMM (local usually as there are only 205 Master SOMM in the world) and give them a reasonable price range to choose a wine after describing the flavors and style of wine I am in search of.  99.9% of the time the SOMM comes back with a bottle I have never heard of and causes a frenzy in my search for more!    Well, guess what this Master SOMM came back with- Chateauneuf Du Pape - (Similar to one I can pick up at one of the local Costco) -  To add to the insult, we ordered the tasting menu and when the runners brought the dishes their passion to explain each dish runs off like a bullet train at 1000 mph only to leave you guessing about the dish you are about to sink your fork into.  While the flavors of the food were actually decent this place treats you like a Vegas hop on hop off bus, just another number Baby!",

We had an early reservation, and sat back for our evening's feast.  We did the four course \"Signature Tasting Menu\" with beer pairings.  (nothing wrong with wine, but I'm a beer guy)  Bread was brought out to start.  Sourdough and country bacon rolls were the choices, served with homemade butter and a little sea salt.  My first course was the wagyu beef tartare paired with Chimay grande reserve belgian ale, the second course was maine dayboat scallops and Sierra Nevada Ovila dubbel ale, the third course was iberico pork loin matched with Sam Smith's nut brown ale, and the final course was apple and fennel strudel paired with Aventus german weisbock.  This was followed with a shot of chocolate hazelnut soup.  My brother basically did the other half of the tasting menu (with the optional foie gras brulee), but I'm not going to type that out, too!  The only decision I would change would have been dessert.  I would have chosen the crunchy chocolate peanut butter tart with the Young's double chocolate stout, if for no other reason than my preference for the stout over the bock.   Service was professional, knowledgable, and efficient, and the surroundings elegant.  It was a fine choice for a couple suave brothers out on the town.",

    "text": "definitely a huge meal splurge. Came here spontaneously for our first night's dinner in Las Vegas. It was a friend's 21st birthday so I didn't mind spending this much on a fanciful dinner. Seeing as though we didn't have any reservations, with some contacts, we started making last minute phone calls to any restaurant names we had. After having been told that it would be over an hour wait here, we asked a contact to help put our names on their list. Finally doing so, got our names on the list and were seated immediately (there were enough tables for possibly 5 parties, why they said it'd be over an hour wait? no clue).   The restaurant is beautiful. It's dimly lit, hostesses are tall and gorgeous, waiters and servers have great manners, and it just makes you feel rich and proper even when you're not.  We ordered one of the cheapest wines for the table. Delicious mixture of sweetness and bitterness. It was evenly distributed amongst the five of us and was worth every drop.   Complimentary bouche of tuna tartare was D-E-licious and the complimentary bacon/sourdough bread with whipped butter and salt?? ahhhh salivating thinking about it.  As for the actual meals...we each ordered separate meals but I don't recall any of us extremely satisfied with it. I ordered the gnocchi which was prob one of the most decently priced and tasty. There was one who ordered steak and another who ordered lamb, both of which had quality taste.   My problems, however, is the fact that the restaurant priced everything soooo high when the food isn't THAT exceptional. Also, the mood is great and everything but honestly, I can make the same lighting with candles at home. Another flaw...the items recommended by our server (two ordered based on recommendations) were not all tasteful..literally, no taste.  But overall, good experience with the complimentary foods. drool",

A little slow and we didnt leave raving about the waiter but he served his purpose I guess. Still for 60 tip you expect to want to come back. The food is where I was sad. I canceled reservations at le cirque to come here and it wasnt memorable. After learning that the tasting menu was going to take too long (had a show to get to) I chose the tartar and the kampachi. The amuse bouche was FANTASTIC and had us all excited. The tartar neither of us finished and didnt find it to have a memorable signature  to make that particular dish unique to this chef. Again the waiter didnt ask why we didnt finish, he was too busy. Next was dinner. The smokey sauce on the kampachi is SO STRONG. Im sorry but that only belongs on a tasting menu. I probably ate 1/3 of the dish and was sick of it. I would say it was \"just me\" but my girlfriend poked around at her pork and didnt like it and my husband said his steak was \"okay\" but not worth $50. Again the waiter didnt ask about sending full plates back to the kitchen. Didnt have time for dessert bc the service was slowish. Should have done j&gs or gone to another of the big restaurants.",

Couple apps & entrees along with two glasses of wine will set you back $160.00 before the tip.  The octopus salad was good, but rather mild tasting (with the several ingredients involved had expected more). The scallop entree (a signature dish) is outstanding.. was it worth the $44.00 price tag... maybe. The arctic char (salmon) is also a very good choice, with intricate well defined flavors. A New Zealand sauvignon blanc by the glass at $11.00 was the best buy of the meal.  Look forward to another visit.",

We were quickly seated without reservations in the lounge since we didn't want to wait for the main room.   The atmosphere is lovely with giant panel sections of Manet's \"Luncheon on the Grass\" (thank you Art History classes).   The evening started off with pressed coffee for everyone but me. It came with a cute cookie. The waitress then brought out an amuse-bouche of...I actually didn't hear what she said, but I know it was duck and mustard. I enjoyed it mucho.   Then the bacon and sourdough bread with salt and butter came out. You only get one piece so choose wisely! Either that or they were being stingy with us. *Shifty eyes*  Our party got skirt steaks, veal cheeks, and NY strip steak. I agree with the other reviewer who said that the vegetable department was lacking. Regardless, I loved the smashed fingerling potatoes and garbanzo beans my skirt steak came with. Plus, the almond vinaigrette was good and not overpowering as some vinaigrettes can be.  The steak itself was really good, but not the best steak I've ever had in my life. I think that has yet to happen. All the flavors worked really well together.  I also tried the veal (not my fav, but I've only ever had veal once before) and the strip steak (also very good). If I go back I would probably get the NY strip or Hanger.   I wish we had enough room for dessert but we were all stuffed. Next time Sage, next time!",

We ordered the beef tartare, foie gras creme brulee appetizers and the scallop main dish; all of this to share between two people.    Everything was amazing quality and taste.  Beef tartare is a staple in France and while it's hard to imagine eating raw ground beef, the seasoning, unsweetened chocolate flakes, herbs, and the egg yolk mixed together makes it so delicious.  It also helps that the beef is from a Wagyu cow.  The foie gras was unique; shavings of foie gras were placed atop a layer of creme brulee and topped with cherries.  The taste was both sweet and rich; a great combination.    The scallops were expertly cooked and tasted great with the vegetable and braised oxtail shreds.  The chef gave diners a complimentary taste of lamb tartare (first time eating raw lamb and it was good) and a shot of truffle milk (wow).  Our taste buds were singing after this meal; it was a great first dinner of our Vegas stay.",

    "text": "We were all excited about having our only all together bachelor party dinner here.  You are dealing with at least 3-4 big foodies among the group so anticipation and expectations were high given the 4.5 stars overall.  Service:  Pretty good.  It was a group of 11 and given large group sizes, in general are harder to deal with which I understand.  The hostesses were accommodating when our group sizes kept fluctuating from 10 to 14.  Our waiter even managed to skillfully pour one bottle of wine evenly for all 11 of us as we were limiting drinks since we were hurting from partying the night before :)  In addition, one person was a vegetarian and they made him his own meal which I really appreciated.   Food:  We mostly ordered the signature menu.  There was generally a disappointed feel to the food with the following thoughts: - Amuse:  kanpachi krudo - disappointing ... was a bit on dry side so should've used a fattier piece or add some oils etc.  Flavors of ingredients didnt really come out. - wagyu beef tartare - very very good - 2 diver scallops with braised oxtail - good and tender but didn't see or really taste much oxtail.  Hard to ruin fresh scallops unless overcooked or unseasoned. - Octopus:  decent mix of flavors but not really memorable.  Not rubbery but it shouldn't be at a nice restaurant. - Short ribs:  very good but portions were small. - Iberico Pork Loin:  Flavor was only okay.  Nothing amazing.  This  was ridiculously disappointing after the waiter recommended it and 4-5 of us got this.  We each had EITHER, 2 or 3 thin (why the inconsistency) medallion slices probably 2 inches in length and one other piece that was a bit bigger with more of a crispy texture.  For a \"main\" (3rd course out of 4), the diver scallops were bigger than this.  I am seriously NOT a portion person as I am often amazed at portion sizes in the US, but this was ridiculous and left all of us hungry. - Wagyu Sirloin - this was well proportioned (as the Pork ordering people felt jealous) but nothing overly interesting.   48 hour beef belly - curious to try since most have never heard of this but nothing mind blowing. - desserts:  there were 2 main ones we ordered a chocolate mousse (good) and another one I forgot the name of which basically was expensive popcorn. - Vegetarian meal:  I dont have details but this was well enjoyed and felt like a personal touch since there were no vegetarian dishes on the menu really.  Again, overall service was good.  But more than half of us leaving hungry (some people wanted to  get a hot dog after) and that's a tough result considering the food was okay at best.  When one of us asked about food portions and we are still hungry, the waiter shrugged his shoulders in a 'there's nothing I can do about it' way.  I cannot recommend a return  to this place. Pretty big disappointment overall.",

Neither me nor my boyfriend got the prixe fixe Valentine's menu.  I had the braised Wagyu beef short ribs, which I was expecting to be excellent having just had the best wagyu beef porterhouse at Cut the night before.  Not so much....  I have never encountered braised short ribs that I could NOT pull apart with my fork.  When I cut them apart, they were not \"marbled\" but inundated with thick layers of fat, and no, it did not melt in my mouth.  There was barely any meat to my short ribs.  My boyfriend had the pork loin and he said it was only \"so so\".  The service was a little standoff-ish.  The items definitely overpriced.  Not worth it at all.",

No need for butter on this one.  All the courses were good, even if a couple of the dishes (glazed pork belly, 48-hour beef belly) were a little fatty for my taste. Waygu beef tartare was excellent - best dish of the night. Wine pairings were also good, and the pours were very generous (maybe too generous!).  Service was great, attentive without being intrusive.  Staff was friendly and added to the fun we had that evening.  Our reservation was at 7:00 p.m. on a Monday, and the place was a ghost town. By the end of our dinner, though, the room had filled up nicely.",

The restaurant was more than half empty, but the server still rudely and condescendingly scoffed at us, refusing to accommodate our request because the tables were \"for four-tops\".

I went with a group of four in mid-March; we all had the four-course \"signature tasting menu.\"    Pros:  - Some of the food was truly outstanding.  The scallops were among the best we had ever tasted, and the pork loin was excellent as well.   - The service was prompt and friendly, if perhaps a little overbearing.  I would rate the staff above average, even for Sage's price class. - Our table was ready right on time.  The experience of booking the reservation and getting in & out for dinner was hassle-free.  This isn't always so with higher-end restaurants in Las Vegas.  Cons: - With tip and a few drinks per person, the bill for four people came out to over $600.  All four of us eat at nice restaurants on occasion, and I think we all felt like $600 would have gone a *lot* further as far as memorable, quality cuisine in other major cities.   - The desserts were underwhelming, as were the wine pairings.",

We started with a Kushi oyster amuse bouche that was too vinegary, followed by a good hamachi dish. Then came gnocchi that was as bland as can be. The turbot was way oversalted and overcooked. The pork loin that the server raved about was small, tough, and tasteless. The blood orange sorbet was too sweet but the bread pudding-like dessert was good.    The service was cold, yet efficient.  There are so many good restaurants in Vegas, Sage should just close up shop and return to Chicago.",

    "text": "Don't believe the hype! We went to Sage on a Saturday night to celebrate my wife's birthday. We chose Sage because the reviews were so high...my were they misleading. It was a comedy of errors from the minute we walked in. We ordered a pear and brussel sprouts salad, they brought us a beet salad. We let them know and they corrected it. Fair enough, everybody makes mistakes, we weren't that concerned about it. But that was only the beginning. They offered us a choice in bread - I opted to be adventurous and try their bacon bread. Disgusting, to say the least. It was extremely salty and near vomit-inducing. When it came time to order, I asked the bartender what he recommended (clearly I wasn't making good decisions on my own). He highly recommended the scallops, said there was no way I could be disappointed in them. I trusted his recommendation and went with that. They showed up on the table looking tremendous...very well presented. I started to think \"maybe we're turning a corner here\"...WRONG. I ate my first bite and tasted something crunchy...thought maybe a piece of shell or sand snuck in...no big deal. But nearly every bite had the same something crunchy going on. I asked our server about it, he said scallops don't have shells...possibly it was sand but that had never happened before. I offered him a bite but he politely declined...I still don't know how it \"never happening before\" was in the least bit relevant. Anyways, he did take them back and asked if I wanted something else in stead. By this point I was done with the place, no chance of that. Finally they brought the bill. They had removed the charge for the scallops but had managed to charge us not only for our pear/sprouts salad that we ordered, but also the beet salad that we didn't. Good thing I didn't trust them enough to just pay the bill without checking it first. When I brought it to their attention they removed the charge, but one has to wonder in a place like Vegas how many customers miss that. After all of this I requested to speak to the manager to give them feedback on the utter disappointment we had experienced. We gave our feedback to a girl up front, she went to tell the general manager, and not surprisingly the GM wasn't interested in talking to us. With leadership like that, is it any surprise that the organization is a failure?",

    "text": "Sage has become one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.  It's dark, it's sexy, it's romantic, it's trendy, it's...  I could go on and on.  My family was in town so I decided to treat us to a nice family group dinner.  We decided to do the early pre-show dinner menu before our show at Zarkana.  For those that are unfamiliar, it's three courses for $59 pp.    We arrived later than expected, but they had no problems accommodating us.  And even given the size of our group... the service didn't skip a beat.  We were tended to by a number of different staff members that evening and it was seamless and comfortable.  In fact, we were running late for our show, so they even offered for us to continue our dinner service and have our third course dessert after the show was over.  They promptly served our other two course so that we could make our show on time.  We couldn't ask for anything better.  On to the food...  we started with an Amuse Bouche.  I couldn't remember what it was because I actually dined there over a month ago.  Nonetheless, I do recall that it was good start to what I remember as an incredible meal.  For an appetizer, I had the heirloom tomato salad.  I really enjoyed the simplicity and the freshness of this plate.  It was beautiful as it was tasty.  I also tried their chilled sweet corn soup which was rather refreshing too.  Now onto the entrees.  I had the flat iron steak which is by far the best steak I've ever had.  It was the most tender steak I can recall and was cooked to perfection by my standards.  I would highly recommend this dish if you are a meat lover.  I also tried their organic chicken and that to my surprise was delicious.  It also claims \"the best ever\" title from my dining experiences.  For dessert, we all had the caramelized pineapple mouse.  While it wasn't my favorite ever, it was still good.  If you are looking for a sexy and fine dining experience, Sage is a must.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying this place is expensive, but it's worth it! My fiance and I came here twice in the same week because we loved it so much.  Both times our server was Jason S. (there are 3 or 4 Jasons there, he's the one with the dirty blonde hair and the great smile). He was an amazing server and so much fun, which made me happy because we aren't really comfortable with the pretentious servers we usually end up with in restaurants of this caliber.  They start you off with a choice between several types of bread which vary depending on the night you go. The country bacon roll is sooooo good.  They then give you an amuse bouche, which also varies by the night. The first night we were there it was raw tuna. I was surprised to find out that it was better than any fish I had ever had from any of my favorite sushi restaurants.  Even though it's not an actual menu item, they were able to accommodate our request to have the day boat scallops in a smaller size as an appetizer. They were AMAZING, so soft and buttery and just melted in my mouth. My fiance absolutely fell in love with the braised oxtail that they serve with this dish too. I was very impressed that they did that for us since I'm usually met with a lot of resistance when asking for something specialized at a high end restaurant.  Our entree was the 30 oz ribeye for two with beef marrow and mashed potatoes. The meat was delicous, soft and tender with the most amazing spice rub. That was the first time I had ever tried bone marrow, and when I took a bite, my stomach said \"yum!\" and my mind recoiled at the fact that I was eating marrow. Yummy, but it will take some retraining to get used to, lol. Their mashed potatoes were ridiculously good and so buttery. I wished I could have had seconds.  For dessert we had the chocolate mousse, which was heavenly. Chocolate covered mousse with a cookie - like crust.  The second time we went, we had the slow poached organic farm egg as an appetizer. I was a little hesitant on this dish until I took a bite. It was like a frothy egg soup with potatoes on the bottom and truffles floating around that you scooped up with a buttery toasted piece of bread. Amazing.  This time my fiance chose the braised short ribs and I chose the scallops. Again, the scallops were melt-in-your-mouth good. I didn't remember the mushrooms from the first time, not sure they were in the first appetizer, but in my entree they were delicious by themselves and even better when paired with the oxtail.  Halfway through dinner we switched plates so he could have my oxtail and I could try his short ribs. They were fall-off-the bone-tender and you could honestly cut them with a spoon. They had a nice rich flavor and I'm so glad I got to try them. It doesn't look like an enormous cut of meat, but it's so filling that halfway through, you feel full.  For dessert we had the bread pudding. This was the only thing I really didn't care for. It reminded me too much of some not so good fruitcake. We ended up ordering the chocolate mousse to go to make up for the disappointment of the bread pudding.  If you're ever in Vegas, head over to Sage and ask to be seated in Jason S.' section!!",

    "text": "My husband and I were blown away by this place!  We are fairly serious foodies and ate here twice during our week long vacation, canceling our reservation at Alex in favor of dining here a second time.    The very first introduction to the restaurant space is the modern glass and wood wine racks creating three hallways into the beautifully rich bar space.  The deep espresso stained woods and rich vibrant purples flow seamlessly from the front bar area to the nearly hidden  dining room.  It is spacious yet cozy with well placed tables close enough together to keep it warm and cozy but far enough away to allow each table privacy and intimacy.  There are large scenes painted on two walls and illuminated in deep purple.  Somehow they almost appear 3-dimensional.  Very interesting viewing!  The menu has a little something for everyone.  On our first visit my husband had the chilled corn soup with Dungeness crab, braised short ribs, and sweet corn panna cotta.  Everything he had was solidly good, but he chose too much corn based food.  Though tasty, Alan Wong's short ribs are better.  I chose the foie gras brulee with warm (melt-in-your-mouth) salted brioche for my appetizer because other reviews raved-O!M!G!!!!!  Warm and cool, sweet and salty, creamy and crunchy all in one!  THIS IS THE BEST DISH I HAVE EVER HAD!!! EVER!!! PERIOD!!!!  There really isn't any way one can describe this dish in words and make it sound appetizing.  You are going to have to trust me and everyone else who gushes about this dish and try it.  I would bathe in it if I could!  This was followed by the halibut, solidly good with subtle flavor and perfectly cooked.  For dessert I chose the s'more-also tasty with a deep rich fudgy brownie topped with a homemade torched marshmallow and a graham cookie tuille.  Though not my favorite ever dessert I would order it again.  the parting taste was a small drink of homemade hot chocolate-mighty tasty!  On our second visit (Thursday, August 5, 2010), my husband (a creature of habit) again opted for the chilled corn soup with Dungeness crab, followed by strip steak that was extremely well cooked and seasoned.  For dessert he uncharacteristically chose the plum financier with vanilla milkshake and really enjoyed it (reminiscent of the root beer float at Michael Mina).  I, obviously, HAD to have the foie gras brulee again.  As good as I remembered.  The only odd thing was they served it with only two pieces of brioche rather than four as they did the first time.  Four is perfect for the dish, two isn't enough.  They quickly brought four more when asked, which allowed my husband to enjoy the brioche which he loved (he isn't a a foie fan in any way, shape, or form).  While the main course and dessert were both solid, the start for me was once again the brulee!  At the conclusion of the meal this time the drink was homemade mint hot chocolate.  While not usually a fan of mint, it was quite pleasant in this preparation.    Overall:  YUM!!!",

    "text": "Fifteen bucks for a poached egg?  Go there, get that egg, and be amazed. I'm not sure all what was in it (truffles, some tiny crispy potatoes, some foam, corn -- and the egg), but it was a beautiful three minutes I spent enjoying it.  The artichoke soup was almost as beautiful... it came presented as just garlic flowers on a plate, with the soup then poured over it. Lovely flavors.  Service at the bar was fast and and entertaining. We didn't have reservations and the restaurant was full -- though I understand this was because they had some large groups that day and it's often fine to walk up without reservations.  One warning on the cocktail menu: I had the Burley Old-Fashioned, which is based around a tobacco-infused bourbon. The bartender warned me against it ('Some non-smokers like you get a little nauseated...') but... well, she knew what she was talking about. I'm definitely a lightweight when it comes to handling my tobacco-infused bourbon. It took me a few trips to the restroom to clean out my system after that.  Except for the drink (which I find hard to hold against them), this was the best restaurant I've been to in Vegas, and one of the best anywhere.",

    "text": "I don't usually like trying new restaurants while in Las Vegas. I stick to Lotus of SIam and L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon and THAT'S IT. Why change what isn't broken? BUT I had to try Chef Shawn McClain's restaurant, SAGE. There has been loads of talk on the blogs about how amazing his restaurant is and I had to try it for myself.  Luckily for us, we visited Las Vegas during restaurant week and what do you know? Sage was participating. Made reservations and was blown away.  Upon walking into Sage, the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous. Everything was in either black or lilac. Perfect restaurant to be located inside of Aria. All of the furniture and decor was modern but very classy and most of all, comfortable. Who wants to go to a fancy dinner and feel uncomfortable and uptight?  I ordered the restaurant week tasting menu ($50) Pretty decently priced for 3 courses if you asked me. You would think that the courses would be less than \"palm\" sized. haha No. They were very fulfilling, so fulfilling I couldn't even go out to the clubs later that night. I was stuffed! 1) My first course I selected the Seared Bison Tenderloin Carpaccio. Whoa. The blood oranges on the side was an excellent addition to the course. 2) Second course: American Wagyu Flatiron Steak. In kindergarten we were all taught that to share. I never wanted to share this delicious course. I had no choice! Portion was HUGE! Carmalized sunchokes! Out of control. 3) Lastly, Gianduja Pave. A what? I can't even spell it right let alone pronounce it. A dessert so memorable why even brush your teeth the next day? Let it own you.  My date ordered Chef McClain's Signature Tasting Menu ($79) 4 courses of heaven. 1) Wagyu Beef Tartare. Very rich and so beautiful to look at you want to just store it in a container and have it mounted on your wall. 2) Bacon Wrapped Rabbit. A rabbit is an acquired taste some may say, add bacon. No qualms about this one. 3) 48 Hour Beef Belly. Let me see, beef belly + 48 hours? GAME OVER. 4) Riesling Pear. Almond. Thyme. Streussel. Might be the best prepared pear I have ever experienced. I mean my date. LOL.  Service was excellent, waiter was not pushy nor a foodie elitist. Came from Yountville so he knew what's up. Everything came out perfectly and each item introduced. Table was never dirty and water always poured without us asking. Prices were comparable if not better than the other high end restaurants in Las Vegas. And lastly, the food is definitely worth revisiting again and again. Do enjoy!  I took photos of everything mentioned above up on the Sage Yelp page or check on my homepage under photos.",

The iberico pork was disappointing and not nearly as special as it sounds from the menu. The black bass was just average. The best and most unique part was the absinthe drink cart; we had absinthe eggnog and it was tasty!  Overall, the main selling point of this place is that the ambience is nice and romantic. On the flip side, the lighting is too dark for a non-romantic dinner. There are several other restaurants on the Strip with more inventive food at the same or lower price point.",

From your walk in where you find the bar and lounge, to your table in the dining room, to the amuse bouche, to actual meal, and the chef courtesy sweet drink at the end, you will never feel short changed or unattended to.  Ten times I've come, and ten times I've left, full, satisfied, and wishing I had room for more excellent food.  The service is top notch, and the decor is perfect for keeping your dining experience with how it was intended by the restaurant.  I've partaken both tasting menu experiences (seasonal so they changes regularly), and if you are able to part with the money, you will not be disappointed.  You also won't be disappointed with the a la carte menu either.  You really can do no wrong.  A must try is the beef tartare.  I know the idea for some is a bit off, but they do a great job with it and the use of chocolate is an excellent addition.  I will admit, I was a bit sad when their lamb crudo was cycled off the menu due to seasonality on my last visit, but there will always replace items with new selections that just cannot make you miss something for very long.  All in all, I intend to continue to come back every chance I get.  I just can't get enough.",

Between the two of us, we had every choice on the menu, and every single item was ridiculously, platonic ideally, good. Perfectly cooked scallops, roast beef so tender and flavorful it didn't require chewing, beautifully balanced cocktails, and deserts that made us grin from ear to ear.  What we weren't really expecting was the staff to be as awesome to us as they were. And they were great. We're definitely not the normal economic bracket there, and it was a dinner we'd saved up for. On the rare occasions we get to go somewhere as out of our usual box as Sage, we've definitely gotten the 'oh, you don't want a $200 bottle of wine, peasant?\" sneer down the nose before. That was not the case here. Every single person we ran into, from the hostesses, to our main server, to the water and bread guys were friendly, real human beings, who genuinely seemed happy we were enjoying our meal. They didn't pester, hover, judge, but they knew their stuff and were very friendly and helpful.   Everything I had hoped for in a \"rare treat\" of a dinner and more, I loved the experience here. This place is what 5 star dining is all about for me.   On top of that, we got a neat \"amuse bouche\" (I'm spelling that wrong but I don't care and extra mini-desert that were just a bite, and not included on the menu, but were still wonderful and fun.  Thanks Sage, you guys rock",

Now, it might have been a jaded experience because I'd eaten at L'Atelier the night prior, but had I not taken picture of each dish as they came out, I wouldn't have remembered them.  It wasn't until the next day when I saw the hamachi dish that I recalled how good it was. I wish the entire tasting menu has consisted of that.  The oyster - meh. And now that I see that Sarah C.'s husband and coworker got food poisoning, I'm pretty sure that's what made me sick too.  I think the most offensive dish was dessert.  I'll post a photo -- but believe me when I tell you this passionfruit mousse looked like a damn stick of room temperature butter.  In terms of flavor, it was pretty good -- but that's after you get the idea of eating butter out of your head.  Not an easy feat.   The best part of the meal?  Another server who looked just like Kevin Spacey and had personality to boot. I wish he'd been our guy.",

    "text": "One of my idiosyncrasies is checking out how a restaurant is decorated. I love how Sage is decorated.   It's dark but the colors of golds and purple jump out. The service is always pretty good. The food is good but I have to admit the ambiance is what I appreciate more.  I've had a full tasting menu here. Honestly, I can't remember how it was, other than the fact that it was pretty good. Nothing jumped out too much. I also had the NY steak, which was VERY good, and at one time ordered a rib eye years ago, although I didn't see it on the menu on a recent visit. I've also had a risotto dish years ago (perhaps this was part of the tasting dish?) and it was decent but wouldn't order it again.   There's a cool absinth bar here which they push out in a little cart and drizzle it over some ice in what looks like a bong from afar. I also tasted a cucumber /gin cocktail, which was very refreshing.   Overall, I think it serves a good steak. However, next time I would probably opt to sit at the bar and have a drink or two.",

I have been here a couple times and I am amazed at what they can with just an egg.   Saturday night we had the signature tasting menu with wine pairing and was excellent. We had plans to go out after so we asked to share our waiter was nice enough to allow to do so.  Amuse Bouche - Sunchoke soup with tarragon -- great start, chilled and light.  First course - WAGYU BEEF TARTARE -- Crushed Caper Aioli/Slow Poached Egg/Crispy Chocolate. My favorite dish of all the courses. So light and went down way to easy. (paired with a vouvray.) perfect match.   Second course - MAINE DAYBOAT SCALLOPS -- Braised Oxtail/Wild Mushrooms/Salted Caramel Reduction. I never knew that Dayboat scallops have a more sea flavor. I loved it. The dish was very asian influenced almost teriyaki flavor.    Third course - IBERICO PORK LOIN -- Brussels Sprouts/Crispy Confit Shoulder/Smoked Dates. Almost bbq flavored, you could taste the smoke.   Final course - WARM CARROT CAKE --Roasted Coconut Sauce/Candied Ginger/Cream Cheese Ice Cream. I normally am not a carrot cake lover but this one will change your mind. Light, moist and rich.   The best part of this restaurant; the Absinthe cart. Who wouldn't love an entire cart of Absinthe?!!  ha ha! Our server suggested the Germain-Robin, USA. This is the lightest out of all the ones listed. Great for beginners, such as myself.  It food is unforgettable and so the absinthe. ;)  I can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "Although my boyfriend and I didn't completely fit in with the crowd here, we came for dinner in a long progression of 21st birthday dinners for him! I'm beyond happy that the Aria gave us the $100 food and beverage credit, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to have this amazing food experience.  They start you off with a choice of either sourdough or bacon bread, and of course the best way to go is to try both. They serve it with sea salt that's imported from Australia and a lemon zest butter. I never ever put butter on my bread, but paired with the sourdough it was amazing. Also included was an amuse bouche, which I honestly cannot remember or recognize what it was. However, the one bite of goodness was the perfect opening to the meal and set the bar high for the food to come.  We chose the Wagyu beef tartare for appetizer after reading all the reviews that raved about it. It came with egg yolk that was perfectly cooked so it stayed on top of the tartare, but still had a runny quality to it. Each bite with the tartare and egg on top of the sourdough toast was amazing, and I could hardly tell that I was eating beef. The meat was extremely fresh and the flavors were really clean. I had the Maine day boat scallops for my entree, and it came with four huge scallops on top of a bed of mushrooms and braised oxtail. The oxtail was so tender and the mushrooms were marinated in this dark sauce that was so good. The scallops were the most tender that I have ever had, and the size of them alone was overwhelming! My boyfriend had the 36 hour braised short rib that fell off the bone so easily. The flavors were incredible and the tenderness of the meat was beyond description. It was also served with a layered potato that probably has a fancier name, but was essentially extremely thinly sliced potatoes that were restacked into a tower. The end result is a slightly crispy and chewy potato side unlike any regular fries or roasted potatoes.   This is probably one of the fanciest places I've had the opportunity to dine at, and the experience was incredible. Las Vegas is packed with amazing restaurants, but this is definitely one to come back to.",

    "text": "We went fairly late on a weekday so the restaurant was pretty empty. It is a very high-ceiling room that with the lighting creates a fairly intimate environment, even for a couple out for a romantic dinner. It could probably get pretty noisy in here with some larger parties, but when we went it was very comfortable. The overall feel of the restaurant is sophisticated without being overly pretentious, which is something I appreciate. We were dressed in casual evening wear (suit jacket, no tie for me) and felt right at place. Of course this is Vegas so just about anything is likely acceptable.  The service was excellent, and I wish I could post the name the our waiter, but I can't find the receipt from this trip. He was very personable and helpful, and we didn't get any attitude from him. He offered some good suggestions from the menu when asked, and was also helpful in the wine selection process. Working in the wine industry up in Walla Walla, I was pleasantly surprised of his knowledge of Washington wines as well as their representation on the menu.  The food was really quite good, and while portions weren't enormous they were substantial enough for us to be quite full after a couple of appetizers and entrees. I do suggest you leave room for dessert as those were very good as well.  Las Vegas dining is sort of a crapshoot (pun intended). I have lower expectations there for overall dining experience but also expect a high value for the dollars spent, due to the great amount of competition. Sage delivered a very tasty meal, excellent service, and a warm sophisticated environment, all at a reasonable price by fine-dining standards. I will definitely add this to my list of where to dine in Las Vegas.",

The dishes that really stuck out were the wagyu beef tartare, foie gras brulee, and the 48 hr beef belly.  The foie gras brulee was seriously something else...never had anything like it, and I would agree with some fellow yelpers that it was on the sweeter side, but when eaten with the toasted brioche that was provided on the side, I think the fruit glaze/spread in the brulee really complimented well. (I thought the combination of flavors was actually quite similar to the fois gras terrine paired with sweet tomato jam that we had tried before at Providence in Los Angeles). Overall, I think the dish was so unique and tasty that I would come back just for it! As for the other decent dishes, I think I could easily find something comparable at another restaurant.  Complimentary freshly baked bacon bread and sourdough bread were both delicious! Dishes came out in a very timely manner and we never waited long before the next course. At the end of our meal, we were presented complimentary hot white chocolate (with browned butter) served in a shotglass...it was so rich and delicious. Service was attentive and friendly. Decor at the restaurant is unique and interesting -- the restaurant used a modern mix of cushioned benches with pillows and chairs. Crowd seemed to be on the younger side (probably in the 25-40 age group).",

    "text": "Wow, what a truly disappointing experience.    Based on the number of really solid reviews and accounting for grade inflation, we were expecting at least a decent dining experience.  What we got was negligent service, inconsistent execution and, most damning, a host so surly and disingenuous it caused me to put fingers to keys to criticize.  Some key highlights:  1) Service was just miserable.  Our large party left the restaurant 3 hours after seating, and we almost an hour between appetizers/entrees/desert.  With such a long time between courses, you'd think our server would be around to check on our dishes and overall satisfaction.  I could count the number of times on one had that he came around.  The sommelier, bread fellow and other staff were good, but our server was in abstentia.  Maybe the mandatory tip numbed his motivation for customer service, but it was clear he didn't really care.  The lack of attention also resulted in missed opportunities to win back our opinion when the food faltered...  2) Overall, the food was decent, with a few solid offerings like sweetbreads, oysters, slow poached farmhouse egg with truffle and toast points (yum!), and dayboat scallops, but there were 3 significant issues.  Wine suggestions were excellent and somelier quite knowledgeable.    First, we ordered the crab appetizer and found 3 solid marble-like objects in the crab meat.  Luckily no one was injured, but if I bit down harder, it would have chipped my teeth.  When I notified the server, all we got was the host concerned about a lawsuit - he was noticeably fixated on an injury - with no attempt at customer service other than a lame apology that they didn't know what happened.    Second, the new york strip was lukewarm/cool, and the puree was just cold.  I would have gladly taken a replacement that was properly cooked, but the 30 minute wait before our server returned pretty much ensured my desire for the steak had waned.  It's really academic anyway, because the server didn't even ask if I wanted another or anything else for that matter.  Third, even though we asked for no extra salt/light salt for all the dishes, 1/2 the dishes were overly salty.  I don't think they added much if any extra salt, but the sauces, earlier prepped items, etc. were uniformly over-salted.  I can't imagine what regular salt would have done to my blood pressure...  A bit of Sage advice.  I totally understand there could be blips in any service, and the mark of any decent restaurant is a commitment to customer service.  If there's a problem, just fix it and let me know you care about your food and my business and all is forgiven.  We got the opposite, which leads me to point 3.  3) The host just didn't care.  When I discussed all the issues we had with the host, the only response was an artificial apology.  That's it.  No attempt at fixing the issues, a complimentary item, nothing.  Maybe it was an off night or maybe it was a bad day for the server/host, but when you can't even care enough to make the slightest effort to fix problems or keep customers happy, it tells me Sage cares very little about it's food and it's customers.    Hopefully your experience at Sage will be better than mine, but I will never go back.",

It was the oh so tacky (and historically inaccurate) way of lighting the sugar cube for our Absinthe. And most notably, it was the ab-so-loot-ly ah-may-zing foie gras brulee appetizer. I haven't taken the time to rank them, but that delicious, delicious blend of gamey creaminess is in the top three starters of all time. It was just that good.

    "text": "This was truly one of the most amazing dining experiences I've ever had!  It is quite expensive, and I have a bit of liberal/catholic guilt about the price tag, but I would highly recommend giving Sage a try.    We did the Chefs tasting menu with wine pairing and every course, both food and wine, were just fantastic.  Our favorite of all the courses was the pan roasted sea scallop (jamon iberico chowder, crispy potato, sweet fennel).  This may be the single best thing I have ever eaten.  The scallop is seared but has a sashimi consistency and the chowder they pour around has a creamy smokiness to it that is just indescribable.  I seriously am having dreams about eating this again.  (Unfortunately this is not on the ala carte menu or I would go back to Aria and order this as oftern as possible - it really was that good!)  Our second favortie was the hamachi sashimi (preserved lemon, paddlefish roe, blood orange, smoked almond) to start the meal.  All of the flavors just expolded in the mouth and made for a terrific start to the meal.  Third favorite was 48 hour beef belly (roasted chestnut puree, brussel sprouts, pickled sweet onion).  It is like I had never before tasted beef - and the brussel sprouts along the side were fantastic.    I did find the fois gras brulee to be a bit rich/sweet, but wow I have never in my life tasted anyhing like it.  The service was impeccable but not overly stuffy.  And the atmosphere is stunning.  If you are in Vegas and are looking for an out of this world food experience (and don't mind spending some serious money) go here!",

    "text": "A solid 4 star rating.  Not sure it deserves the extra half that helpers have given it though.  The ambiance is definitely 5 star....amazing decor everywhere.  We got the 4 course tasting menu, which had a lot of potential.  They started us off with a salmon tartare amuse bouche, which was definitely the best part of the whole meal.  Very complex and delicious.    Next came the Wagyu beef tartare, which was great.  I've never eaten poached egg yolk before, but this was a great introduction.  The meat was definitely fatty and rich, but wasn't overwhelming.  Then a replacement option to the scallops, which I had to beg for since they rarely do substitutions.  Had the red snapper, which basically had a piece of fried toast stuck to it, with some ground crunchy peas.  Wasn't impressed at all with this one.  Next came my Wagyu steak, which I paid an extra $10 to select.  The Wagyu tartare was much better.  This was a good steak, but the flavors weren't distinguishable and really didn't stand out against any other steak I've eaten in a restaurant.  Last came dessert, which was great until I bit into the fresh sage they put on my plate.  Why do restaurants put inedible things on your plate?!?!?  This ruined my taste buds....really took about 5 minutes to recover from the bitterness of this spice.  All in all, amazing decor, really good service, and good, overpriced food.  Was expecting a bit more from a chef that is claimed to have 3 Michelin Stars.  Do they mean 3 yelp stars?",

    "text": "Sage sets such high expectations that my wife and I were curious if stratospheric expectations could even be met.    Early signs of trouble often provide the subject matter for the inner voice to decide whether to seek another dining venue.   The extensive wine list had nevertheless very poor selections by the glass (and I mean poor).  Half bottle selections were equally weak.   Was it designed to specifically influence the diner towards full bottles of wine?   Future Sage diners will decide.   Upon arrival, Roasted Veal Sweetbreads appetizer gave us a glimpse of what may be going in the kitchen.   Does the flavor come from excessive amounts of oil?  Or - does the flavor come from the ingredient being the highlight of the dish?  Apparently, the oil argument won.  We had to send it back.   Grilled Octopus appetizer did not seem to be grilled at all, lacking the thin layer of charred tissue.   The dish - while executed well - turned out to be average at best.   Pacific Red Snapper entree gave us another glimpse of perhaps another debate in the kitchen.   How does one accentuate a delicate ingredient?  When culinary creativity fails to produce alternatives, adding more salt and then adding more salt again wins.  Sadly, Pacific Red Snapper had the potential of being a wonderful dish.   Alaskan Halibut entree was probably prepared in some other kitchen because this dish became the highlight of our dinner.   The service could not have been better but service alone does not create the kind of loyalty a restaurant like Sage may want to be successful and profitable.     At Sage' neighbor - Julian Serrano - the food and service are both exceptional, at half the price.   Sage has much to learn.",

    "text": "Cliffsnotes version: Food was nothing short of spectacular, but service and atmosphere were a little \"douchey\" for my taste.   I realize the restaurant had only been open a few weeks when we went in January, but honestly cocky slow service is never appreciated. The attitude on our server was such a turn off, especially in a new restaurant, but luckily the food made up for it!  Bacon baguette : This was the only bread offered to us, but mb vegetarians can make a special request. Best.bread.EVER. Somehow there was 0 bacon texture, but maximum bacon taste. You could see tiny flecks of bacon, but you didn't \"feel\" them in your mouth. Very interesting! The artisan salt and butter provided with the bread only enhanced it's awesomeness.   Appetizers: We tried the shrimp, sweetbreads,beef tartare, foie gras yellowtail, and escargot. Shrimp was good, yellowtail good, but honestly the yellowtail sashimi I had at En over in Henderson recently was better. Beef tartare good, but Michael Mina's is better (I sound like a total snob, I know!). The foie gras custard was disgusting. No one at my table of foie gras lovers could handle it. Think creme brulee meets foie gras and try to decide if that works in your head. Doesn't work in mine! The sweetbreads on the other hand were the best I've had in my life. If you don't like sweetbreads, by all means give these a chance! Perfectly charred, awesome flavor..a must try. Escargot with the homemade ravioli was our 2nd favorite.   Mains: Tried the pork, the wagyu tenderloin and the veal cheeks. All were nothing short of perfect. The pork was so tender and served with a delish pork filled canneloni. Wagyu tenderloin is on my top 10 steaks I've eaten in my life list! Perfectly seasoned and prepared. The veal cheeks were a nice surprise. If you've ever tried beef shortrib but thought \"I wish this was fattier and softer!\", try the veal cheeks by all means !  Dessert: Tried the chocolate something or other with warm banana bread. Great but not 'special'. The warm sipping chocolate served after dessert was a great surprise.   Overall, definitely worth a try! If you can get past the trendy douche atmosphere the food is really worth it.",

The server was not helpful, we we asked him for a recommendation, he suggested the \"chef's surprise\", so that is what we ordered not knowing it was $150.00 per plate. Each course (8) was about two bites, not paired with wine, and there was NOTHING any of us liked. The server knew as he took back each uneaten plate. The wine was very good, we had a Word Pinot Noir but that was all we enjoyed. When we received the bill it was $967.00!!!! We left there hungry and went somewhere else to eat. The next day I asked to talk to the manager about our experience. He basically told me too bad for you but you can try it again. NO THANKS! Poor service recovery skills. I don't mind paying high prices for an excellent meal, but to pay this much and have to go find another place to eat dinner.....",

They do make you wait in the bar area to get you to drink, which is ok, because you want to sit and chat but it was unnecessary. I had a Saison Dupont and some of the others had notable belgian biers and very good imports. The drinks were not pricey but on par with Vegas prices.  The wait staff was great, very attentive and hung onto our every word and if we needed something, they were there. I ordered the octopus salad appetizer, which was very good. I would recommend this dish. I had the Pork loin entree, which was almost $40 for a small portion of meat. The meal was great, everything you would expect from a new expensive restaurant.   Some of the other members of my group were not as impressed. I don't blame them. It's not the best restaurant in Vegas nor the hotel. But it was an experience.   One of the members of my party ordered the Yellowtail Crudo. Now, what is crudo, we still don't know, but we think it's foam. Yes, foam. The dish came out and it was a fish foam with pine nuts. Wow, $20 for foam. Not impressive.   The attitude, atmosphere and ambiance were great but I wish we had tried the absinthe but we were full and the absinthe was $25 and up and I think everyone had the fill of expensive stuff that day.  I give this place 2 stars because my meal was very tasty and i high recommend them both but the price is high and the crudo put a wierd spin on the whole night.",

Located inside the new City Center/Aria complex, Sage is a great choice when you're looking for something a little more upscale than your usual, without it totally breaking the bank.  Three diners ate and drank for $260, incl tax and tip.  We enjoyed the braised veal cheeks, the short ribs, and the roast organic chicken, which had skin so crispy and loaded with bacon flavor goodness, all we could do was smack our lips.  The veal cheeks were accompanied with buttery soft and creamy polenta.  MMMMMM  There were two bread offerings with freshly whipped butter and smoked salt: Asiago and Bacon (again with the bacon!).  I highly suggest that you just get 10 of the bacon and forego the Asiago - it doesn't compare.  For dessert, we shared Sage's version of a beignet, which I think failed.  It wasn't as light in texture as a True beignet is in the middle.  Also, the dough was braided so it really just ended up looking like a french twist donut.  Dare I say, also, that I'm pretty sure the very middle was undercooked, despite my dinner companion's insistence that it was supposed to look like glue.  Capped off the flavors with a 2006 Holdredge Zinfandel from Alexander Valley - excellent choice.",

The entire staff was welcoming and professional- I was exceedingly satisfied.  To begin with we were brought breads paired with supple butter and Australian sea salt- the sea salt was surprisingly a standout addition. ______ Kusshi Oyster - My favorite of the night, don't miss out on these. Trust ME. Kusshi oysters are some of the best ones around.. incredible.  Pacific Yellowtail Crudo- A little bit creamy, but melt in your mouth delicious  I also enjoyed a Glass of  Meursault, Joseph Drouhin, Burgundy (this white wine is phenomenal) & La Fin Dumonde - Perfect with the oysters, a light and refreshing pair  __ Charred Baby Octopus Caponata- Phenomenal highlight- if you even like octopus, you will Love this one.  Slow-Poached Organic Farm Egg- rich and thick, slow poached perfection  Beer: Orval Trappist Ale  Schneider Aventinus  __  For our main course we had the Salmon, which was done with classic elegance, a dish involving a type of Manta Ray- which I found to be lacking in flavor and moisture compared to the rest of the meal, and the Lamb Cheeks ( which I recommend ordering Rare -Med.Rare. My fiance liked it more well done but I really wasn't a fan) I drank their Cotes du Rhone Clos du Caillou and Chimay Grande Reserve. Both of these were expectedly excellent.  We enjoyed two desserts, but the Canelles de Bordeaux easily stole the show, with its waffle crispness and coconut ice cream. Tripel Karmeliet was a perfect dessert Pairing & the Glass of P.J. Vlackenberg Eiswein, \"Madonna\" for me as a little extra indulgence was slightly thicker and sweeter than I prefer, but wonderful all the same. Another guest of mine enjoyed the Sauternes from the menu which wasn't as smooth as I was expecting.   Each of the beers had its own special glass in which to pour to bring out each beer's individual notes; as it should be- My guests were especially impressed when a cover for an entree was brought to the table when one of our guests wasn't present as entrees were served.   Everything about this restaurant is phenomenal- from the ambiance down to the luxurious paper our bill was printed on. I could not have had a better experience.",

    "text": "Sage is a testament to how the vegas dining scene has changed over the last decade. What used to be a sea of steak houses and restaurnats by tv chefs like emeril and bobby flay has slowly been dotted by culinary gems.   While sage posesses a fine wine list, the beer list is the best I have seen in Vegas at a fine dining establishment.  Among my indulgences were Triple Karmeliet , Rochefort 8, Duchess De Bourgnone and Deschutes Black Butte Porter.  The menu was so exciting that we had a hard time deciding. We ordered three appetizers to start followed by two entrees. The roasted sweetbreads were served with porkbelly, chanterelles, creamy polenta and greens.The sweetbreads were perfectly roasted and compimented nicely by the earthly chanterelles and creamy polenta. A hint of bitter from the greens and sweet/salty pork belly was a bonus.  The ricotta gnocchi with squash and resling reduction boasted a great texture and had a subtle (not underwhelming by any means) flavor. Lastly, for appetizers, we had the slow poached farm egg with truffles. Nothing out of the ordinary here, but a perfectly poached egg with truffles. The essence of truffles with the creamy egg yolk yielded something sublime for the toast to soak up.   For entrees, I had the scallops with braised ox tail. Sweet perfectly seared scallops with very rich braised oxtail. The whole dish was nicely brought together by the caramel sauce (which I initially thought might be overwhelming, but was not.) My girlfriend had the short ribs that were braised to perfection and served with pomme fondant.   Eventhough we were stuffed, we had to try something for dessert. Our choice ended up being a valrohna chocolate dome filled with a mousse. If  I remember correctly, there was some sea salt on the chocolate that really extracted/heightened the sweetness.   I think it is quite evident that I enjoyed my meal at Sage. The service was attentive and efficient. Atmosphere was relatively romantic. From the quality of food coming out, it is quite evident that the executive chef behind the concept is in the kitchen.  Definitely a restaurant to watch for (i see a michelin star in it's future)  This restaurant is at the top of my list on my next trip to Vegas.",

My experience was probably a 1 or 2.  However, my friends enjoyed their food so much, I couldn't see giving Sage a low rating.  I had one of the tasting course options, and I picked wrong on every single choice while my friends actually did have pretty good food.  My pork tasted like honey baked ham, which I absolutely detest, and I wish I was over exaggerating   The rumor was the foie gras is amazing.  I was not impressed.  It was served like a creme brulee (yes, with sugar on top) with a piece of bread absolutely soaked in butter.  It was barely edible for me.  My friends thought it was heaven, but I couldn't not take but two bites, and I usually enjoy foie gras.  It was just too heavy.    The whole meal is extremely heavy.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but you should be forewarned.    The prices were very reasonable for the kind of experience you are getting.  I just wish my experience was a bit better.",

I also think for this sort of dining, Sage actually passes for a good value (on the Strip). We've been three times and have enjoyed each time, either getting the chef's tasting menu with wine-pairing or ordering a la carte. The menu is challenging without being off-putting and we've had very good service and meal-pacing.",

For the money, I just didn't think the value was there. The portions were silver-dollar sized. The accompanying wine pairing was all 2 oz pours - again just enough to give you a taste. I honestly felt afterwards like I wanted a sandwich. Service was amiable but a bit casual for a fine dining establishment.  The hostesses at the front are your usual post-teen malcontents you'd find working at a P.F. Changs. For the money, you're much better off at about a dozen other restaurants in Vegas.",

While waiting for our table, the bartender gave us excellent drink recommendations and gave us a few samples - wish I could remember the names of the cocktails we tried, but they were all tasty and well-prepared.    Once seated, our waiter was incredibly attentive and courteous without being overbearing or stuffy, and again offered us some excellent recommendations based on our tastes.  They also managed the timing and pace of our meal with aplomb - which I consider impressive for a group of 9.  As for the food, I'll run out of superlatives if I elaborate too much.  I had the sweetbreads as an appetizer and the lamb saddle as a main entree.  Both were absolutely delicious.  Also tried some of the octopus and steak tartare starters - also excellent choices.  And bacon bread?  Can't go wrong with that.  I've been to a number of overpriced restaurants in Vegas and left underwhelmed - but Sage earned five stars in every regard.  I definitely will be returning next time I'm in town.",

We were seated in the lounge area and there were ASIANS up front so there's no racial profiling going on ( duh? to the previous reviewer).  In terms of service, We were attended to by the bar attendants and a manager.  Bar server offered his services and wasn't sure why we were seated in the lounge  but told us he'll make every attempt to give us great service.  We had a blast with him!    He recommended 3 dishes to us and if we didn't like it, he'd buy them.  We didn't return anything.  The escargot appetizer was divine especially the ravioli.  4 hour soft poached egg was more of a dip than a True appetizer and for someone who doesn't like creamy egg yolks, I slurped it all up.  Loved the bacon rolls.  Amuse Bus was whatever.  The Hearts of palm salad was refreshing and the roasted pork shoulder was very savory.  The pasta portion was amazing.  2 of us shared everything and we left satisfied in terms of our palate.  Were we still hungry.  Yes and No.  I wasn't.  My friend was.  Would we go back.  Yes.  They also asked for our comments and how our dining experience could have been better.  We told them hopefully, they'll incorporate some more \"filling\" dishes into the menu and get rid of putting foam on almost everything.  Overall, we had a great experience!",

    "text": "So I just posted the same review on OpenTable (and I don't review often), but I felt compelled to let people know of my experience given the generally highly favorable reviews of Sage:  I went to Sage with 2 friends after reading good reviews on Yelp.  The service was overly attentive - pre-bussing tables before the table was finished with a course, pushing drink refills before I had finished a round, repeatedly asking if I was done before I had finished - while some may appreciate the attention, my friends and I were put off by the rushed feeling.  The food was also just okay - I had the octopus appetizer and barramundi, both of which were overcooked.  The smoked cod that one of my friends had was excellent, but the steak my other friend ordered came at least medium well when he ordered medium rare.  I suspect that is because we did not finish our first courses at the rapid pace they expected, so they mis-timed the cooking of the fish and steak and in the process of keeping them warm likely overcooked them.  Still, I lived in Manhattan for 12 years and I've been to many restaurants at the same price point as Sage, and I would have expected that the main course would not be prepared until the appetizers were cleared (especially given that all three dishes required minimal cooking time).",

My husband treated me to Sage after raving about it over and over again, so I definitely went in with high expectations.    We made reservations for 8pm, so I was slightly annoyed when we weren't seated for 20 mins post our reservation time.  However, our waiter Jason made up for things service-wide. He was extremely attentive, to the point where my husband could not leave the table without coming back to a folded napkin (it became a challenge after a while)  We decided to order the Chef's tasting menu, and WOW, absolutely NO disappointment there! The food is inventive, creative, extremely tasty, I raved about it to friends for three days afterwards. Chef McClain takes things you would never think go together, and turns them into an absolute masterpiece in your mouth.  The Foie Gras Brulee left us requesting more brioche so we could literally clean the plates.  The 48 hour beef belly just melts in your mouth, my mouth is watering just thinking about it!

Try a martini at the pink bar just located adjacent to reception before you enjoy dinner.   We enjoyed the Chef's menu, which included the Foie Gras Creme Brulee. ($110 pp). We added the wine tasting (another $60 pp), which made the night perfect. The chef treated us to a few other dishes. The scallop dish was sinful.   I'm giving this 4 starts because the food and service was very good. I had two points where I had to think about my rating. The main course, a strip of beef, was slightly undercooked, which left it slightly chewy. On one occasion I also had to call for my waiter. With a bill of $450 for the night, having to ever call for your waiter just shouldn't happen. The waiter was very kind, helpful and attentive. Late in the evening though he was missed. If this was any other restaurant I'd rate Sage as 5 stars. However, this isn't like any other restaurant, so I'm giving them 4 stars because I want to know if I ever missed the mark, even but for a step.",

My Service experience was horrible.  8 people, $800 check - 20 minutes from seating to seeing a server (restaurant wasn't busy, 6pm on Thursday).  25 minutes to get drinks.  When it came time to eat, server simply asked - \"any questions?\".  They clearly didn't want us there.  We saw him literally three times, one of those to get the check.  Not even a \"how is everything?\"  He gave lots of attention to the three top of ladies next to us, whom got everything before us and saw him multiple times - we were left in the dust - he just walked right by. I let management know, hopefully they will improve things, or I encountered a one-off situation.  Either way I truly felt unwanted at this restaurant - like they wanted to tell us to take our money and go to Applebees.  Go for the food, not for the service.  Sage, fix this or you will continue to upset other patrons.  Again, KUDOS to the chefs -  good food - don't let the service/mgmt bring you down!",

The bison was tender and tasty, and the snap peas and salumi a pefecr bar appetizer. Shady and Co had a few cocktails, Shady opting for the classic Hank Larson and making nice with the staff. Shady was rewarded when the kitchen had an extra egg truffle and potato to go-more food than Shady bargained for for a first stop on his 3 hour tour-but WOW, was that good!

    "text": "Sage was wonderful.  I've been coming to Vegas for four years at Christmas and have eaten at a number of fine dining restaurants.  The meal I had at Sage was the best.    My companion wanted the tasting menu with wine pairings.  Many places require all diners at a table to get the tasting menu.  I applaud Sage for not going that route.  She said all of her dishes were delicious, with a spectacular rabbit dish and excellent wine pairings with very generous pours, not just a splash in the bottom of the glass.  The cocktail menu is interesting and features  an excellent, tangy Moscow Mule.  For anyone who loves the flavor of ginger in a drink, I recommend it highly.  The bread service includes a wonderful bacon bread roll so good I could have eaten half a dozen.  But don't fill up on the bread because you are going to want to eat every bite of your meal.  The amuse bouche was a lobster salad.  I'm not a shellfish fan (not allergic, just don't like it) so I can't comment on it from personal experience.  My companion was happy to eat my portion as well as her own.  I started with a lovely, velvety squash and pear soup that was perfectly seasoned.  There was a balsamic gelee at the bottom of the bowl and as it melted into the soup each mouthful was varied delight of nuanced flavor.  My second course was the pear and brussels sprout salad with bacon and a mustard vinaigrette.  You need to mess up the lovely presentation so you get a bit of each component in every bite.  When you do, WOW!  I had the short rib for my entree.  Deeply crusted, succulent with fondant potatoes and a parsnip puree.  You are going to want to soak up every drop of the sauce.  I had the passion fruit mousse for dessert.  It was light enough to not weigh me down after the three previous courses, full of fruit flavor, silky and delicious.  The final dish of the evening was a small cup of piping hot white chocolate and strawberry cocoa.  I don't know how they infused so much strawberry flavor into the drink, but that touch of acidity from the berries was just enough to cut the richness of the white chocolate.  It was a perfect capper to the meal.  Service at the restaurant was excellent, attentive without being smothering.  The interval between courses was timed perfectly, there was never a need to ask for our water or my iced tea glass to be refreshed and, when we requested lots of ice for our water, we were brought ice every time our glasses were refilled.  I cannot recommend Sage highly enough.  If you have one fine dining experience in Vegas, make it Sage.",

    "text": "After reading some of the glowing reviews about Sage, some of my fellow Yelpers and I decided to give it a try.   We had reservations for 7:00pm and our table was ready on time.  Our server was attentive and after perusing the menu we decided to order selections from the four course Signature Menu. After we ordered, a server brought us an herb butter with some sea salt and we had a choice of either a french roll or a bacon bread.  The french roll was average, but the bacon bread was very good as was the butter, and the salt was a nice touch to give just that extra bit of flavor to the bread and butter.     For our first course we tried the beet salad and the oysters.  Both selections were very good.  The oysters were small, fresh, and served with a spicy sauce, but were not extraordinary.  The beet salad was very good and I wished I could have had more of it.  For our second course some of us had the  scallops and some of us had the octopus.  The two scallops were delicious and the octopus I was told was also very good.  For our main courses we ordered the Wagyu beef, the beef belly and the Iberico pork.  All  were good, but the portions were incredibly small, more like an appetizer portion than an entree portion.  The Iberico pork tasted very much like Canadian bacon and consisted of two quarter size slices which were about 1/8\" thick.  This is not an exaggeration.  The two tiny medallions of pork were served along with some pulled pork that was the size and shape of a one inch cube.  The beef belly portion was a little smaller than a deck of cards and the Wagyu Beef, which was a bit greasy, probably weighed 2 ounces.  For dessert, we ordered the olive oil ice cream with hazelnut crunch and the rhubarb tart.  Both desserts were delicious, but were again very small portions.  The olive oil ice cream was about the size of  one tablespoon.    The service was average with the waiters not knowing who ordered what and the pace of the courses was not well timed as we waited a very long time between the first and second course while  the third course arriving very quickly after the second.    I thought I would have a problem finishing a four course dinner, but the portions of the food were so small that I had no problem finishing them.  My fellow diners said if they had not pigged out on the bread, they probably would have left hungry.    Overall the food was very good and the service was average.  The value for the money was ok, as even though the portions were incredibly small, the four course Signature menu was only $89.00 per person. (Add $15 for the Wagyu beef entree).  The atmosphere of the restaurant was modern and elegant and very conducive to good conversation as there was no loud music and tables were spaced well apart from each other.  I would recommend to give this restaurant a try if you are looking for good upscale food at a relatively reasonable price.",

I won't even try to explain the combination of fantastic flavors that I enjoyed. This place has a very creative chef who puts together unbelievable combinations of flavor. They have a phenomenal wine AND beer selection to pair your meal with. The trifecta is the well informed, attentive service. In a word, fantastic. I will be back here when ever I am in Vegas. As a side thought, the bacon infused dinner rolls are outta this world.",

    "text": "Delicious food, so-so service. My lobster ravioli was luxurious and not overly creamy, which was a major plus. The Vancouver Island Kushi oysters would have been good on their own-the tequila mignonette added nothing. I found the server to be a tad snooty, which perhaps can be attributed to the fact that we were, after all, dining inside the Aria Hotel. Besides the less than desirable service, I think Sage is a good choice for dining on the Strip, if you don't mind a hefty price tag.",

    "text": "Jeff, the bartender at Sage that helped us, is a pretty awesome mixologist. He isn't afraid to just hear an ingredient and make up a delicious concoction for you to try. He knows his ins and outs of liquor flavors, mixers, fruits, and all that jazz. When Misti Y and I stopped by she was able to sample a most refreshing mixture that contained canton, fresh muddled raspberries, and ginger beer among other ingredients.   I myself had the Tea Rose cocktail. This is made with tea vodka, rose water, St. Germain, and is garnished with roasted pine nuts. It's as interesting as it sounds and while I don't think the flavor is for everyone I also don't think it was so offensive or strong that you couldn't drink it if you had to.  Misti and I also shared a tuna crudo and cheese plate for snacks, both of which I really enjoyed. The cheese plate had 4 varieties on it I believe and it wasn't an overwhelmingly large selection so if you're sharing between more than 2 people you may want more than one plate. Overall though I can see why Sage is such a hit for yelpers. I'd love to come back and try proper dinner and more cocktails the next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "We were celebrating our 16th wedding anniversary and our friends from Beer Magazine (who did a write up on them a few years back) recommended we try this place. So we did and did the 4 course chef menu. We didn't do the wine pairing but opted for a bottle of wine which worked out perfectly for us. I chose the fois, octopus, beef belly and chocolate panna cotta. Husband had the oysters, scallops, flat iron, and the Meyer lemon cheesecake.   Our favorites....the oysters, foie, scallops, flat iron steak and beef belly.  Everything tastes fantastic but those were definetly memorable. I could have a facial in that foie it was divine and our awesome waiter Bond got us a few more pieces of the brioche bread to scoop the rest of the foie gras from my plate. I have chills just thinking about it.  Overall experience was great. I was a little annoyed that when the dress code I was told over the phone wasn't what the dress code was at all...they made it seem like it was enforced. I asked about the dress code prior to our visit and I was told dressy...I dressed up in nice jeans and heels, appropriate for the atmosphere, but the guys that were seated next to us after 1/2 hour into our meal looked like they just came back from the pool in their shorts and caps.  And our little special anniversary didn't feel so fancy sitting next to them. But we still enjoyed ourselves and our waiter made us feel special.",

    "text": "I recently ate at Sage before seeing Zarkana (Cirque du Soleil) at the Aria.     At the recommendation of the Conceirge, we booked a 5:30 PM reservation to take part in the Pre-Theatre dinner menu.     At a cost of $59.00 per person, the menu guarantees three courses of absolutely delicious, well prepared, beautiful food.   There is an optional $29.00 per person beer and wine pairing that ensures a perfectly paired beverage with each course.  I highly recommend the option!    We each began with an heirloom beet salad with blue cheese and pomegranate seeds that melted in your mouth.  The flavors paired beautifully together and played off of one another.   This course was paired with a deliciously drinkable Sauvingon Blanc that was an excellent food wine.  Our second course was an organic chicken with a berry sauce, hazelnuts, and their potato waffle.   I eat a lot of chicken at home, so don't often order it at restaurants.   But the dish was such an explosion of flavors and literally melted when you placed it in your mouth.  The wine pairing with this course was a spectacular reserve Spanish Rioja that made the entire $29.00 in wine pairings worth it all by itself.   It was so good my friend opted to have a second glass with dessert in lieu of the desert wine pairing.    Our desert course was a milk chocolate and earl grey pane cotta with fresh baked madelines.  Really light, delicious, and a perfect end to delicious meal.  There was a delicious tawny port pairing with this course.  The atmosphere at Sage harkens old Las Vegas with a speak easy sort of vibe.   Classy, yet sultry all at once.   Reservations recommended, and leave yourself plenty of time to really enjoy the meal.   Sage ranks among the very best meals I've had in 3 trips to Vegas.",

We just had a dinner at L'Atelier De Joel Robuchon previous night and it was a huge disappointment. Compare to the Michelin starred restaurant. Sage was much more modern in terms of food and decor. The portion was also very sizable at Sage. I had the 4-course signature tasting and my sister ordered a la carte off the menu. We walked away with similar bills. I had the foie gras brulee custard (yes, super delicious), the scallops (plump and juicy, and the portion was generous. Some restaurants usually skimp on scallops and serve you elf food.), flat iron steak (omg) and chocolate and earl grey panna cotta (it looked nothing like panna cotta but was so beautiful to look at and delicious). My sister had the wagyu beef tartar (highly recommended), beets salad (she said it was the best she ever had), organic chicken (they stuffed the dark meat of the chicken into the chicken. It was surprisingly good.) and cranberry crisp.  I had no room left otherwise I would love to try the foie gras candy bar and their absinthe menu.",

This time around, we both opted for the Signature Tasting Menu ($120each) and were blown away by every course. The highlight for me was the lamb saddle and sweetbreads. The sweetbreads were as delicate as I've ever tasted and perfectly complimented the lamb. Every course was beautifully presented and timed perfectly from the last. Probably the best fine dining experience I've ever had. Every staff person we came in contact with, from the waiter to the bartender were at the top of their game as well as being personable (no stuffiness here!).   I can't wait to come back. The meal lasted a good 2.5 hours from start to finish. It was an experience not to be missed!",

Following a meh experience at #Ripsteak, Sage at the Aria needed another visit. Last time, while I enjoyed it, it seemed a little quiet and resembled an experience I had at Renoir (Mirage,) years & years ago. Remembering this, I was angling for a seat in the bar/lounge upon arrival. There was no need cuz the dining room was gorgeous & live with action, vibe & good tunes that did not overwhelm.  Sit in the middle if able. Starting with the farm egg & beet salad - both 10 outta 10.  Fresh, fresh beets, and an unusual egg/foam presentation with croutons & shaved black truffle - super-nice! Entrees selected were the Salmon which was amazingly prepared with the freshest peas and veggies, and the Scallops with an oxtail side. Both were amazing.  Shout out to the server for being top notch as well.  Sage - In the rotation, again & again.",

My salad was absolutely terrible, the artichoke was no poach but rather blanched and then pickled.  The dressing tasted like watery vinegar.  I barely touched my salad but none of the wait staff asked me if my food was to my liking, they simply cleared away my full plate.  On the other hand, my husband loved his steak and the potatoes that came with it which is why I am giving it 3 stars.  If you go there do not get the poached artichoke salad!",

Sage lacked \"5 star\" complete excellence due to some dishes lacking a bit of flavor.   Some were amazing, some were good but not great.  My two \"must try\" dishes were the scallops (oh, drool, I can only dream of replicating that at home), and the heirloom carrot and roasted garlic ravioli (with a generous serving of shaved truffles and chantrelles).  Oh my, that ravioli was decadent and so worth the price!  The oysters, beet salad, and tuna sashimi all could have used a little more oomph.  The flavors on the menu looked amazing, but they were all a bit muted.  Especially with small servings fancy-restaurant style, I want every bite to smack me upside the head.  Those at our table also thought the beef tartare and beef belly were just okay.  While they were cooked to perfection, the accompanying flavors should have been a little more intense.  Deserts were nice, rich, and complex, with our favorite parts being the salted caramel ice cream that came with the pine nut torte with fresh berries.  I am enamored with the candied pine nuts, need to try that at home, and had to restrain myself from licking the plate clean.    Overall, the experience was very nice, and worth doing once every couple of years.  But, for a meal that approaches $100/person, I want everything to be AMAZING with no dishes that are just \"pretty good\".",

Atmosphere is very nice...very upscale and modern feel like the rest of Aria, and it worked well for us.  We tried the tasting menus with wine parings!  It was a first for us, and it Truely felt like we were the special guests of the restaurant.  Service was great and attentive.  I won't go into each dish...break it down into a million ways, and explain why it was so good.  Every dish was great...and I felt the pairings were spot on.  It was a very fun and exciting journey down Sage's tastings, to try each of their \"bests\" and have fun eating each and every bite.  Highlights :    Waygu tartare was so good....I still think about it days later.    The grilled octopus was easily the best I have ever had...it was so tender, I don't even want to know how they did it....must have beat the hell outta it and marinated it for hours....so so good, you would not even know what you were eating because it was a completely different consistency.  The foie gras brulee was an experience.  I have never had it before, and the whole dish was an explosion of flavor...almost TOO much flavor.  TIP : Spread it on the bread that they give you with the brulee...you still have the amazing tastes, but it is not nearly as sweet and overbearing.  Once I figured this out, the dish was night and day better.  Lamb was great...I had no idea what sweet bread was, and I ate most of it lol.  I was told later, and it still didn't change the fact that everything was great :)  48hr beef belly was crazy packed with flavor...so tender, reminded me of pulled pork  meets pot roast...it really really works.  The waygu sirloin was the hit of the night.  So tender and packed with flavor...my mouth waters thinking about it.  Overall, this was a big splurge of pocket change to throw down on dinner...(well over $400 with tax and tip), but it did its job of giving us a very memorable anniversary dinner and a food experience we will never forget.  Go for it!",

Brulee style - creamy, smooth foie gras topped with a crispy flamed crust and solid foie gras shavings.  OMG!!  YUM!  The brioche was also very tasty - the perfect vehicle.  As everyone has mentioned, the SKIRT STEAK was also really really good.  Tender, flavorful, melt in your mouth.  The whole dinner was fabulous.

Sage is an amazing restaurant with fantastic food, that I believe is overshadowed by other, newer \"it\" spots to dine.",

The desserts were totally forgettable, most the wines went well with the courses. For the money spent, should have mind blowing experience, didn't happen.   Service was good, sommelier did a nice job explaining wines and answering questions.   The highlight - absinthe menu. Try one, enjoy the table side prep.   I'd consider myself a foodie and was between Sage and Twist for this night. Sage was more convenient.  Wouldn't return or recommend with so many good food options in Vegas.   Gave two stars because three would imply above average. When taking into account the whole experience, including price, this was just below average.",

The waiter gave me a hard time over requesting tap water, mentioning that, having lived in Vegas all his life, he would \"never drink tap water\". (Really? The water in Aria is polluted?) Trying to embarrass me into bottled water in front of my date was a poor way to start the evening. The Kusshi oysters put me in a better mood - nice spicy hit of boozy goodness on the tongue, very fresh tasting, went down easy. Left me wanting more. The Chilled Corn Soup with lobster and lemongrass sounded like a great idea, but went over like - well, cold soup. It didn't work somehow, the mouth feel was off. Imagine that you took some decent seafood soup home from a restaurant, put it in the fridge overnight and then ate it without re-heating. Then, when you realized it was low on flavour you hit it with salt - lots and lots of salt. The Wagyu Hanger Steak was out-shined by the chimichurri and crispy potatoes, which were quite nice, whereas the meat itself was blue rare (I ordered medium rare) not properly seared and obliterated with salt. Dinner for two ended up at around $300 plus tip and the poor service from snotty brats made for a Vegas memory I would rather forget.",

    "text": "One of the best meals of my life.  I should begin by saying I wasn't feeling well this day, not well at all. So while I was able to taste everything, I did not finish one single dish and it haunts me every day.  The environment is overwhelming and elegant, exactly what you'd expect from an upscale Vegas restaurant. Soft gold lighting, pillars, purple and black accent walls...this is a very cool looking restaurant.   The service is leaves nothing to be desired. Our waiter, Mr. Bond, was delightful and intelligent. He played with us, posed for pictures, was knowledgable about the food and made excellent suggestions. It felt like he'd been a part of our group for years.   We did the Chef's Signature menu, which was Wagyu beef tartar, scallops, and Wagyu sirloin, and dessert.   The Wagyu beef tartar was a very clever dish. Eggs, tarter, and chocolate are not 3 items I would typically think to pair together. However, they blended and clashed beautifully. The texture was playful, the flavors sang in harmony, and the portion was just enough to keep you wanting just one more bite.   The scallops were absolutely perfect. I can remember exactly how they taste to this day. Each bite was this unpredictable explosion of rich, slightly salty, flavors with this perfectly caramelized crust. Truly incredible.  The Wagyu sirloin still costs me about one good night of sleep a week. For whatever reason, I was just not hungry at all when we got to this dish. I hadn't had that much to eat before this, the portion sizes were spot on, but I was having some stomach issues (completely unrelated to Sage) that left me unable to finish my order of sirloin. I can still see that plate disappearing from before me as the water took it away...still feel judgmental eyes on me from my friends, who had all managed a happy plate. It was the best steak I've ever had in my life.  There were two desserts available, each deconstructed. One was a fruity/lemony dish, the other chocolate. Each was decadent and savory, rich and playful, and completely different from one another. I'm happy we ordered as a group and didn't have to choose between the two.",

We enjoyed a really delicious meal in a swanky upscale atmosphere (finally people without shorts at dinner!) - See my Craftsteak review.  So - the food was superb and creative and didn't lack much. my husband had the short rib, and it was just a tasty as advertised - a little on the sweet side, be prepared. I had the steak and it was excellent...hard to beat after having the white truffle appetizer, which was a special that night.  On to the weird service...maybe we had a waiter that was still in training? I don't know, but he was rushed to interrupt when we were ordering and he kept anticipating what we were going to say and he was WRONG every time! OOOPS. I expected a more knowledgeable and confident server at a restaurant that runs $500+ for 2 people. Oh well. It's Vegas, there must be a very high turnover for the wait staff. I would definitely return!",

The first time I came here, I immediately ordered the tasting menu (the more expensive Chef's tasting menu of $150 because, well, it's Vegas. Go big or go home as they say).  Yes, it may be expensive but you are getting a good range and feel for what Sage is. Also, you are paying for art and we all know how expensive that can be !   The portions are small as this is the tasting menu but you will be exposed to so many different, exotic items. The things that stood out to me the mo st (and will be returning for) were the day boat scallops, the chilled sweet melon soup (with the surprise of violet),braised beef shank and Peach tart (which was found on the $89 menu. I substituted it for the Opera cake).   After your meal, don't be afraid to try their Absinthe drink. It's strong, but they add lemon/lime flavor to moderate the taste of alcohol.   On top of everything, they have a very friendly, knowledgeable staff who tell you what's in the dish as well as the name of the dish and can impressively pronounce all the words I never knew existed.",

The decor and atmosphere was of course still wonderful.  Also, the food was very good, not top notch, but certainly very good.  I would have recommended it based on these factors.  The problem came with the service.  Our server, while very nice, was simply absent.  She was at least okay when we first sat, until we ordered.  After, she was virtually non existent.  We wanted fresh drinks, and the glasses sat empty forever, until we had a busboy finally track her down.  It also took her forever to ask us about dessert, and when she finally did, she never bothered to ask if anyone wanted coffee or anything to drink - she left too quickly.   We had to flag her down after, and by the time one cup of tea came, we were ready to cancel.  Not sure if she was having an off night, or if the service has taken a turn for the worse, but either way the service was very sub par, and made for a not so pleasant evening.",

We sat at the bar as we waited to be seated and the bartender made me the most perfect Old Fashioned that I have had in a very long time.   We got seated and our server was fantastic. She was super knowledgable about the menu (I'm gluten free) and let all staff know that I was so they didn't offer me bread and also let me know the amuse bouche was gluten free or \"safe\" for me to eat.   I ordered the Brussels sprouts salad and the husband ordered the beet salad with iberico ham. Both were amazing. Main entrees were the iberico ham with pork belly and the skirt steak. Dare I say perfection? I can't say one bad thing about anything we ordered.   We were worried about how the service would be over all because there was a party of 25 people sitting next to us and hoped that we wouldn't suffer for it. We did not. While the hostess was a bit chilly, our bartender and server and the entire supporting staff were some of the best. I firmly believe that a mark of impeccable service is whether or not your water glass goes empty. I was chugging water and always had water in my glass. And sometimes refilled without me noticing.   Too stuffed for dessert, but looking at other tables was very tempted.",

    "text": "I came here with a group of 9 for a friend's birthday weekend, and somehow, we were able to get last minute reservations. For a restaurant as popular at Sage,  it was amazing!   We started off with a selection of bread. I tried both the sourdough and the bacon bread. You'd think that bacon bread is great, but it was a bit salty and not as good as I would've expected. It was still very interesting. The bread also came with some herb butter and salt, which was especially nice with the sourdough. Following the bread, we received a starter (an amuse-bouche ,which was definitely a fancy touch). I can't quite recall what was in it, but it was also very interesting in its combination of tastes.  For the main course, I ordered the braised wagyu short rib, which was delicious. It was sweet and well-braised, and came with some veggies on top. I believe its was pieces of sliced potatoes and/or radish. While it didn't look very big, it was deceivingly filling. I'd definitely recommend this one.  I also tried some of my friends' dishes. The duck breast was very tasty. Also, I had a bit of the gnocchi, which was very rich. I can imagine that my friends who had ordered  that one were very full.   One thing that I was disappointed with was that they charge you for sparkling water! Not OK! With a restaurant as nice as this, the \"flat or sparkling water?\" question should yield complementary waters with either choice. Anyway, over that!  Overall, I was impressed with the restaurant and the food. The ambiance is pretty nice although most of the clientele seems to be of the older crowd. We were probably the youngest ones in the restaurant. Would like to come back!",

The foie gras creme brulee had that nice combination of sweet and savory. The dayboat scallop was cooked to perfection, and the oxtail paired perfectly with it. The beef belly reminded me of bbq beef ribs. That's a good thing, by the way... because no bbq joint has made ribs taste THIS good! Super delicate and tender meat, with a great smokey flavor. The only weak point in that meal was the pistachio tart dessert, which wasn't very memorable, but I don't even care since the rest of the meal was just that satisfying.  The $39 wine pairing was a steal. The wines weren't spectacular, but they paired well with the dishes, nevertheless.  Oh, if only Vegas were closer so I could eat here over and over again...",

After learning one of our business dinners was to be held at Sage, I decided to check out the menu; due diligence is my thing.   Being a vegetarian, I was a bit weary when I saw so many carnivorous options. Naturally, I assumed I would just have to suck it up and go for the ol' standby of soup and salad. Boy was I mistaken!  After informing the waiter of my \"dietary restrictions\" he informed me that the chef was happy to accommodate. He proceeded to let me know that many of the dishes could be altered to suit my needs. My needs! In my experience, most (gourmet) chefs are not happy to do such a thing. That's one star.   Second star was the amuse-bouche that was *a hem* vegetarian!   Third star was the delicious Sancerre and incredible wine selection. OMG.   Fourth star was the slow poached egg with shaved truffles. To die for.   Fifth star - and this is what did it for me - was the shaved  brussel sprout and persimmon salad with the most delightful nut butter and  BACON FREE dressing. This was literally one of the most delicious plates I've ever had!  Thank you, Sage. You totally lived up to your reviews. Bravo. Well deserved!",

First course: 2 of us had Waygu beef tartare ... dense, rich, and a rather huge portion for something this intense. One person changed to the lobster salad which (I hear) was divine.  Second course: 2 of us had scallops and the other had the octopus--I've already mentioned the scallops (think winter cozy perfection) and the octopus was a completely different flavor profile yet also amazing.  Third course: 2 of us had the imberico pork loin with pork belly and one of us had the beef belly. Both were ridiculous and we all said hooray.  Dessert: I had switched to a perfectly constructed cranberry crumble ... can't recall what my friends had because I didn't try either of theirs.  We were all so happy. Sage has incredible service staff--our waitress was amazing and consistently steered us toward perfection. I wish she could be the server at every restaurant I dined in because she was so upfront and honest--e.g., do the wine pairing with the chefs tasting menu; otherwise, go for bottles on the regular tasting menu as you'll likely appreciate it more (good for us as bunch of winehounds!). The sommelier helped us select 2 fantastic bottles of wine (approx. $130 each).   All in all our table of well-traveled foodies was thrilled by the experience.",

    "text": "The foods are tasty enough, but not what I expected. Things are very rich in butter and a little on sweet side. The fixed manu I thought was good for the money. Had the fros grois cream bulee, it was unique but again too sweet for my taste. I am glad I tried it but will not order it again. The steak was cooked perfect, impressed by that. Breads are nice and warm but nothing special. Desserts are midocore, nothing to write home about. Cocktails though are outstanding.  Services are good, they keep their distances. The oyster we had as appetizer was great. Overall a nice place for drinks and maybe just get the steak. I feel like they tried too hard to combine flavors and end up miss the mark on few things.  Could be better off just go to wicked spoon.... Can't say that I will be back, but people may really like it if they are into that kind of  dish that put dessert ingredients into savory dishes",

It was a tea-infused vodka drink that had a hint of berries and was not sweet at all! I could have drank them all night, but stuck to just one.  At the end of our meal, we decided to opt for the absinthe. It was a drink with a show. The absinthe cart was rolled to out table by our waitress who prepared our order by putting the alcohol on fire and then pouring the hot liquid into a glass of orange juice. With the remaining fumes of absinthe, she put the glass face down on a napkin and instructed us to inhale the vapors with a straw, which we did a little timidly. It tasted like licorice, but not as strong as the last time I had absinthe and couldn't stand it at all. The drink itself was pretty potent, but again, it was much better than the last time I had an absinthe cocktail at Beso. Definitely worth it to check out.",

    "text": "We went to Sage after positive reviews on Yelp.  After walking around the casino the first day and not seeing a lot of people we were a little put off that when we arrived on time for our reservation at 7:30 that they asked us to sit in the lounge.  We're going to order drinks so it's not that we're cheap but it always seems a bit like a hard sell when places do that.  But we followed orders and went into the lounge area.  Not packed by any means.  We found a couple of seats and waited.  And waited.  I know at least one bartender made eye contact with me but no one attempted to take a drink order (and they were moving about taking care of folks away from the bar) nor did we move--by now I was getting a nice pout going.  So we were probably there 10-15 mins with nothing happening as we accumulated chips on our shoulders.  The hostess then came up and asked us our names again and said OK our table was ready.  We were seated in a nice dining room with expansive ceilings and interesting art. When our server (James) appeared he asked how we were doing and I said with a genuine smile that we were trying to get over our \"attitudes\" and gave him a speed version of waiting, etc.  He apologized and said they were busy. A couple of minutes later he appeared with two glasses of champagne compliments of the house.  It was a nice gesture and immediately put us at ease.  The rest of the meal was very impressive as well and I was glad to eat it without being ticked off.  Very nice details on the food and the delivery (each course was explained as it was presented).  There was a tasting menu but we ordered from the regular menu--me lobster ravioli app and pork loin entree and my wife had a salad app and scallops entree.  Suffice to say the food was great--we eat out a lot at nice places and this one ranked up there with our Vegas experiences.  And yes the bacon rolls are amazing.  And the chocolate \"soup\" shot at the end of the dinner was wonderful as well. So a bumpy start turned into one of our better LV dining experiences.  2 apps, 2 entrees, 1 glass of pinot noir (plus our \"free\" champagne) and our chocolate shooters (on the house) and the bill came to $145 before tip. We would highly recommend.",

On the plus side, the cocktail menu is huge, and the bartender is quite talented. I had a terrific Sazerac. On the other hand, the vibe is very snooty (wine and cocktail list are presented on an ipad, which is a cute gimmick, but kind of a pain to flip through), and the servers were as well. The food menu is quite limited and the cuisine was all heavy meat. My brother and I are vegetarian and they didn't have a single vegetarian entree. I muttered to him that, if the chef is good, he could whip something up, and the waitress overhead and chimed in, \"he is very good\". No he's not. The recommended appetizer was a slow poached egg with potato and shaved black truffle--sounded fantastic, but the flavors were way off. Somewhere between an ashtray and used cat litter. The special entree was no better and not filling either. The chef seems to heavily favor bitter, smokey, and highly acidic flavors and food was not balanced and totally lacking in seasoning. Coming from Northern California, where there are lots of great, great restaurants, it was painful to spend this much money on a meal that was so mediocre. I suppose if the idea of a $120 steak with bone marrow is your thing, then maybe this is your restaurant (although those who ordered it weren't raving about it). I am not familiar with the Vegas scene, but think that you should be able to get more creative, local, and flavorful cuisine for far less money than what we paid.",

The sommelier suggested perfect pairings for our meals. The food itself is good, if not always up to the price point. I love salmon, but was disappointed that it was the only fish option on the menu at the time. It was certainly delicious, but I expected a little more creativity. Whatever's fresh, I suppose. My partner, on the other hand, absolutely loved the lamb. Definitely a good place for a special occasion, but not that friendly if you're not in the mood for meat.",

This restaurant was the only part of my experience at the Aria that was without flaw.    The decor of the restaurant is sexy, urban, chic.  Stroll past the imposing wine cases into an environment that closes out the casino completely and focuses on making your taste buds so very happy.  My first thumbs up goes to the bar staff.  Very well executed classic cocktails.  Though I did not sample the wines myself, another couple that were local, explained to me that they come to Sage just for the wine selection.  Try the Sazerac if you're inclined to enjoy something with some whiskey in it.  The bartender really enjoys making them and she made a beauty.  On to the food.  The amuse bouche was a generous spoon of a tuna tartare that was excellent.  It was the starter that let me know all you Yelpers had done me right.  I had the Waygu Beef Tartare.  It's served with little crisps of chocolate.  I would have never imagined that pairing, but it sure worked well.  An exceptional starter.  So how do you top that starter?  A Kobe Flatiron steak did the trick for me.  It was topped with some shaved truffle, baby carrots on top of a neat little potato deal.  The steak was perfectly prepared and carved for me to appreciate all of it's medium rareness.  The quality of the beef was apparent and it was exceptional.  I forgot what the little potato thing was, but it was very thinly sliced and transformed in such a way that it did not resemble a potato product in appearance.    While I was tempted to indulge in dessert, I knew I had a long evening ahead of me, so I enjoyed my Sazerac and promised myself I would be back, oh yes, I will be back :-)",

The service, decor, ambiance are all first class, the food was good, but not the best we ever had.   Interestingly, I would rate the freebies the highest: the salmon tar-tare was very tasty and refreshing; the bacon roll was flaky, crunchy & even better w/butter & salt. I blamed myself not to ask for an additional one; :( and the chocolate butterscotch was smooth and creamy...yum!   For Appetizer, kusshi oysters are definitely \"Must-Have\"! The best of its kind! They are small, but fatty and juicy. The sauce is incredible as well. A 5-star here!   For entrees, I had the scallops with braised ox tail. Huge scallops tenderly seared with very rich braised oxtail. The mushroom and leafy veggie (don't know what it was, but it was good ) were soaked in the rich oxtail gravy and were actually the best part, in my opinion. I would give the scallops a solid 4-star.   My husband ordered Belgian Ale-Braised Short Rib. The short ribs were slowly braised, and were very tender. Honestly, they were good , but not the best  we have had in other places. Again, it was a rich dish with big portion, it made him so full that I had to help out :( We both agree that's a 3.5 star dish!",

The corn soup with crab that I had was wonderful; the American Kobe Skirt steak was perfectly cooked, bursting with flavor, and surrounded by some absolutely delicious crispy avocado balls.  The Pineapple Mousse I had for dessert was beautifully plated and a great cap to the evening.",

    "text": "I love this restaurant - elegant decor, great service and the food is delicious! Instead of ordering an appetizer and a main course, I decided to order three appetizers. I started with the Yellowtail dish. It was basically yellowtail sashimi with truffles. It was an ok dish. I felt the truffles were a little overpowering. I couldn't really taste the fish.  My second dish was the Beef Tartar. OMG, it was sooo good. The beef was fresh and seasoned perfectly. Paired with crunchy bread, I almost licked the plate.  I ended my dinner with the Foie Gras Custard 'Brulee'. It was one of the most creative and delicious foie gras dishes ever. Loved every single bite of it.  I am giving it a four star rating because the Yellowtail dish was just alright and I just couldn't believe that after spending $100, I was still hungry.",

The service here was incredible--the timing of each course was absolutely perfect, the waiter was friendly and knowledgeable and all of our needs were anticipated.  Even before the courses started to arrive, Sage won me over with its delicious bacon bread, which should not be missed!  We also ordered a poached egg with crostini appetizer that was covered with some sort of truffle foam.  It was just fantastic and very beautifully presented.  Next came a bowl of fresh burrata with summer squash, a crispy sea bass and finally a white chocolate ganache dessert with blueberries and caramel corn.   Sage is my new favorite restaurant in Vegas.  I can't wait for my next visit!",

    "text": "We came to Sage especially for the Absinthe, they have 3 different ways that they prepare the Absinthe for you.  The one I ordered was the Russian way, which this is where they coat the glass with Absinthe and light it on fire, trap the vapors then give you a straw to inhale the Absinthe vapors.  If you ever wanted an instant drunk feeling without having to drink so much, go to Sage and ask for the Absinthe the Russian way.  My friends got the French way of Absinthe and that is where they drip water through a sugar cube onto the Absinthe.  That way was good too, but mine was better.  Freebasing your Absinthe is the way to go!  They have a huge selection of Absinthes to choose from , unless you know what you are looking for, ask for help.  The bartender was a jerk but knew what he was doing.  If you want a friendly guy at the bar, this is the wrong place!  This is more of a restaurant, but we didn't eat cause we only wanted to drink.",

    "text": "Wow! The food was amazing.  We had the prix fixe which offered an appetizer, two smaller size entrees, and dessert for $89.  To start, I had the Foie Gras Custard Brulee - if you like foie gras, you MUST get this.  I think this definitely was the highlight of the meal.  The foie gras had a light whipped texture and since it was a brulee there was a hint of sweetness.  Next, I had the Ale Braised Short Rib and Maine Lobster Casoncelli.  After the Foie Gras, the rich short rib was a little much, although very good.  The casoncelli was good too.  The dessert was a little of a let down though.  I had the carrot cake and in general it was dry and had a very hard outer layer.    Great fine dining restaurant, date night/girls night, have the Foie Gras Custard Brulee",

We ordered the foie gras custard brulee, duck, and 4 course chef's signature menu, with selections of the wagyu beef tartare, main dayboat scallops, iberico pork loin, and chocolate ganache and caramel tart.   Pretty much, as everyone else has noted, the custard brulee is a must-get. Surprisingly, it wasn't overly-rich. The duck was a bit on the salty side, but it was very good still. The wine helped to cut the saltiness. the beef tartare came with a perfectly poached egg yolk. The scallops were cooked perfectly. And I don't think anyone can go wrong with iberico....  If you're eating before a night out in vegas, I'd also recommend getting the french press coffee. It helped to keep me up for a night of clubbing. Regardless, I loved the food.",

    "text": "Really disappointed with Sage as it came highly recommended.  We had the $120 tasting menu and the food was mediocre at best.  Just too much going on each plate and it was not cohesive.  Seasonings and sauces were worse than average.  Amuse buche was very good, oysters.  King crab had too many components that did not work well together. Best dish is the scallop with the garlic panna cotta.  The lamb was over cooked and sweet breads were oily and did not belong on the plate.  The 48 hour beef belly was the most disappointing as the sauce had no flavor,  the belly ended up tasting fatty and the best part of the dish was the asparagus and almonds.  The chocolate mint soup was devine.  The desserts were a mess!  Best part of our meal werethe wine pairings.  The service was lacking as our waiter was too cool for his position.  He spoke ever so softly and was full of himself.  He spoke down to us and put down the other restaurant that recommended Sage.  Once he took our order we were serviced by the sommelier, bus boys and runners.  Waiter at one point scolds the bus boy at our table. Sage does a poor job of entertaining the diner.  Our time there was painful as dinner took 3 hours, we waited for our dessert for 20 minutes.  With so many great restaurants in Vegas, I would not recommend Sage. I want a refund of my time back.",

The setting/surrounding in this place is really psychadelic and classical so its a cool mix and vibe.  Def go for the table and not the bar-the bartenders can make interesting/mean drinks but the perks of eating a meal/appetizers at the tables are wayy better.  For example, at the table, we got a complimentary glass of rose moet each, foie gras free and a shot of cocoa (BOMB!) at the end of the meal.  Everything on the menu is awesome, loved the wagyu tartare with the gold flakes and venison.  Awesome meal and ambiance for little over 100$ for 2!  Usually pretty dead (customerwise tho) the 3 times I came.",

I had read many reviews for this beautiful place inside of Aria in City Center, and had my plan already set.   We were the first people in that evening, as our reservations were for 5:00, which is when they open.  I really wish I could remember our servers name, she was SO friendly and helpful with any questions, and she would chat with us, without it being annoying or uncomfortable.    We had the octopus salad, steak salad, oysters, the (amazing) foie gras creme brulee, and the sweetbreads.  Everything was incredible.  Service was top notch, everything came out timely with great food descriptions (which are like lullaby's for me, soo soothing.)    While speaking to our server, (I WILL find out her name, because she deserves to be in this review) I mentioned that it was my birthday, and also that I was a culinary student. Later in the night I asked who the chef was that evening, she told me that Shawn McClain was in, and he then came out and spoke with us.  It was such an honor to meet such a wonderful and successful chef!  We ended our meal with the canneles de bordeaux.  It was an incredible night filled with amazing food, quality service, and happiness.  We will be returning again in June, and I can't wait!",

Our waiter was knowledgeable and smartly attuned to what we were expecting in this experience. He read us like a book. We skipped apps and went right to entrees and dessert. For us, that was the only way we could have made it through the dinner and I'm usually a pretty big tasting menu kind of gal. Bread course (we're from Texas, we opted for both kinds) and amuse bouche were consumed quickly, I didn't even have time for pics!  Once again, I had the 36 hour short ribs with white asparagus and roasted turnips. Licked that plate clean. The short rib was spiced just right and was very tender. For dessert, I had to have the foie gras candy bar. At first, I wasn't quite sure if I liked it because it was just so busy for a dessert, but by the last bite I knew it was really good.  Ambiance was spot on with the feel of the entire hotel. Classy, sexy and just the right amount of chatter. I would come back for this.",

All the artwork throughout the restaurant was amazing....The table we had was part booth with pillows so comfy loved it!

My friend got the salmon which was pretty good too....and for dessert we shared their version of Strawberry Shotrcake...which I adored!!

    "text": "Define: sage  /saj/ Noun:  An aromatic plant (Salvia officinalis) of the mint family, with grayish-green leaves that are used as a culinary herb. A profoundly wise man. Adjective Having, showing, or indicating profound wisdom.  This place totally deserves its name!  We didn't do the tasting menu (which I regret a little), and also didn't get any cocktails (also, a miss - they looked amazing and I overheard people at the table next to us praising them). I think that our menu choices weren't really \"sage\", we got some wine, I got catfish dish and my fiance got a Kobe steak.  Both dishes were great - presentation, taste, just the right wise combination of spices, perfect portion size. However, I must say that I liked the sides more than I liked the proteins - I had amazing pea puree and my fiance's parsnip puree made me reach out to his plate a few times.   However, the reviews of dishes in this restaurant are irrelevant - their menu keeps changing... The dishes from previous reviews are not longer available. But I am sure, that if you take a tasting menu, you will not regret!",

However, with some modern background and lights. Very nice concept   Food is well above average and the service is superior.",

    "text": "I had high hopes for this place but I ended up walking out very underwhelmed .  As the reviews recommended, we ordered wagyu beef tartare and the foie gras brulee for starters, and ordered the veal cheeks for the entree.  Beef tartare was okay, nothing spectacular. I've definitely had better. The sauce was a bit overpowering.   The foie gras brulee was the biggest disappointment of the night. Now, I was already aware from the reviews that this dish is a bit on the sweeter side to be enjoyed as an appetizer. Regardless of the sweetness, I feel like this dish just simply doesn't... work. The dish was definitely too sweet for an appetizer. But the taste of foie gras did not get along well with the creme brulee , and was off-putting to be eaten as a dessert. And I've had foie gras many times, in different forms. The idea was nice, but the flavors were just... clashing. The sauce on top (I can't recall if it was blackberry or blueberry) did not work well either. I tried the dish as an appetizer AND as a dessert, but neither way worked. No matter how hard I tried to like it, I could not get past 3 bites and neither could my date.  Veal cheeks - These were good, but definitely not worth $41. Honestly you can get something similar to this elsewhere for around $25. The portion was small too. You can pay 5 more bucks and get a 6 oz filet mignon at a decent steakhouse.  All in all, the meal wasn't bad, but definitely left more to be desired. For the same amount of money, I'd go elsewhere.",

    "text": "I'll refrain from being overly critical.  The food was pretty good.  We ordered 3 to 4 courses each for a table of 4 with a bottle of wine.  The service was not exactly over the top, nor was it any worse than the last time I went to a chain restaurant such as California Pizza Kitchen where I bring my young boys.    We came for an anniversary dinner with close friends on a quick trip away from the kids.  We told our waitress about the occasion.  A birthday was being celebrated next to us, with a candle for the birthday boy.  For our table?  Nothing.  Perhaps I should have spelled it out a little bit more.  I guess in this day and age of having to spell everything out, a la carte, personal check lists, that's just the way things should be run nowadays.  Man, do I sound old.  The bread service, where CPK would win in this case, came at a random time.   The sommelier (or maybe he wasn't a som) didn't seem to like that I was seeing if the wine would be palatable for my wife...\"Is there something wrong with the wine?\" He asked somewhat irritated.  I said, \"No, but I'm trying to figure out if my wife would like it...\"   I'm no som, but I know what my wife likes.  The gentleman said nothing after my concern and, after I succumbed to the pressures of his irritable tone of voice by saying \"it's good\", proceeded to pour with robotic mechanics.  Did I mention I like border collies.  They're pretty intelligent and task driven, but if not trained they are known to nip joggers and be somewhat socially shy.  The delicious food seemed to be on the heavier side. I guess \"New American\" may be more like French Bistro with an Asian/Mediterranean mix.  There was nothing subtle about the flavors, so what you ask for is basically what you get.  If I were to suggest to myself if I had a time machine, would be to order 3 instead of 4 entrees, don't come here for special occasions but if you do have a check list of items you would like,  and avoid tasting the wine with an opinion unless you know a specific wine that you know is off their huge wine list.  If you want decent food and, maybe, serviceable service, then this place is for you.    Thank you for your time.",

    "text": "Sage is truly a hidden gem in Las Vegas but there were a few glitches on my visit. Went in on a Saturday night for my boyfriends birthday and it was not full. I had made a reservation and was seated right away. I went during restaurant week and I took full advantage of it their menu. For starters I ordered a dirty martini and when I received it, it was not dirty at all. I told my waiter and he told me he could bring me more olive juice on the side or make me a new one. I opted out for just the olive juice but quickly regret it when it warmed my drink a little. Wish he would've just told me he would get me a new drink, the concept of bringing olive juice over was slightly strange. I ordered the roasted carrots for my first course and it was the perfect balance between sweet and salty, nutty and earthy. I loved it! For my main entree I had the skirt steak. I ordered it medium and received a well done steak! I told our waiter and he said it looked medium well when clearly there was no pink! He asked if I wanted to have them run it again I said no because I hate putting others into trouble and I didn't want to eat at different times with my boyfriend. It's very inconvenient. I also wish our waiter was a little more supportive. When offering to run things again it seemed more as if he was just saying it because he had to. I felt like he didn't take us too seriously. My boyfriend and I are in our early twenties and I usually don't care but when I'm paying a little more than usual I want everything the way I asked it with out having to ask twice or question myself. Anyways, it was a good steak and would've been better had it not been over done. I also had the passion fruit Mousse which was nice and refreshing. Deff recommend this place over any other over crowded restaurant in Las Vegas, will be back but I will put my foot down next time. Three stars for the mediocre service, would've been a five had they fixed their mistakes the right way.",

The bartender was friendly but not over bearing! And the bar itself is so pretty to look at! Once we sat at the perfect table, the service and food started. You MUST get a wine pairing from Christina! She knows her stuff and added that extra touch that put our evening over the top. The brulee foie gras was amazing, melted on my mouth! Duck confit salad, sturgeon and both the desserts were out of this world. Yes, it's pricy for the portion size. However, every bite is worth the price! If you are looking for an unique experience on the strip and a food vacation. You must visit Sage!",

My husband and I ordered different things so we could maximize our tastes, and I have to start by saying that everything I tasted was delicious and memorable.   Highlights for me included the luscious foie gras brulee, the scallops with braised oxtail, and the pork loin with spaetzle. The pork was paired perfectly with a 2002 Rioja I'm going to have to track down somewhere.   The restaurant aesthetic is modern and chic, in line with the rest of the Aria. I also really appreciated the kind and attentive service! There are plenty of wonderful upscale dining options in Vegas, and I think Sage can hang with the best of them.",

My recommendation is to start off with the Cotton Candy cocktail; a requirement in my opinion. It is served at your table with a ball of pink cotton candy and the cocktail poured over it.  This delicious libation is not overly sweet and I can tell you, one is not enough. Though there are so many things I can boast about regarding the cuisine, the star of the menu was the Iberico \"Secreto\" Pork. Personally, I had to slow down my pace to savor every bit of this savory and tender meat. Complimented with kale and Asian pear, this dish found a perfect balance of sweet, savory and bitter. Though I was too full to order dessert, I did finish out with Absinthe served traditionally over a sugar cube. There is the option of serving with fire and ice in case one needs more flare in their serving. The dress code is \"dress casual\" so I wore a polo and khakis. I did some in three piece suits and others in jeans and a button down. As for cost, dining on a budget is not the name the game. Though the menu options are pricey, this is one restaurant to splurge. If there is one fantastic night of food and drinks you seek, make it Sage.",

The staff were all very attentive and pleasant. The menu changes every so often, so there is a chance that the menu will change by the time anyone reads this review. Hike the menu does change it isn't extensive so you don't have pages of items to decide between which is nice.  I ordered the Grilled Wagyu Hanger Steak with crispy potatoes, salsa brava and wild leeks. It was one of the most amazing steaks I have eaten. It melted in my mouth and was the perfect portion as to not be overly filling and just enough to satisfy my appetite.  I did not partake in dessert, but I did partake in the Absinthe bar. While I have enjoyed absinthe in the past, I have never enjoyed it presented as an experience. When you order it, they bring a cart to your table and prepare it for you table side. The brand, flavor, region of absinthe that you select is poured. Then a sugar cube is soaked in it, then placed on an absinthe spoon and lit on fire. Once the flame has burned a certain amount of time they then pour ice cold water over it to fill the rest of you glass and voila!   I was very pleased with the service, food and entire experience.  I can't wait to go back.",

The lighting gave it a romantic ambience. We made reservations earlier in the day, so we were able to get seated right away. Service was really good. I really liked our waiter, he was always there to get anything we needed and our food came out fast.  We chose to do the tasting menu, where it's a 7 course meal for each of us. All of the food was DELICIOUS! Even though the portions were smaller, we were fully stuffed by the end of the meal. Every single course was unique and flavorful. And each plate that came out looked like a piece of art. We also received one course of oysters on the house and a palate cleanser sorbet before our dessert. So you can say we had 9 courses overall! They paced our course really well, so our next course came out right after we finished the current one. We also ordered cocktails that were very well made. I had the cotton candy and the glass came out full with cotton candy, into which our waiter poured the alcohol mix on top of. How cool! I would say give at least 2 hours for this dining experience, because we were cutting it ind of close in trying to get to the show we were going to watch at another casino.  Since it was our anniversary, they also wrote 'Happy Anniversary' at the top of our dessert. It was a really nice gesture :)  Overall, it was a really great fine dining experience and would recommend!",

    "text": "ARIA has some legit dining options. Well done on their part. Sage was one of the best dining experiences my wife and I have had this year, and that's saying a lot.   We were greeting at the door courteously and professionally and the staff was totally on point. Our server who's name I cannot recall did not miss a beat and her support from the kitchen and Sommelier was fantastic.   The decor inside is romantic and dark. We enjoyed it. My wife's gown pretty much matched their aesthetic exactly which was cool.   We opted for the Five Course Summer tasting w/wine. We also added two cocktails on the front and one on the back (mistake of mine but not Sage's more to come on that). Since I'm a glutton we also added Wagyu Tartar.   We know our food, we love our wine. This meal did not miss a beat. I won't go into detail of each dishes construction or flavor but every single bite was a delight. Major kudos are due to the Sommelier for being adventurous with her pairings and really stepping out from what I've grown to expect from a lot of tasting menus with wine. She really surprised us with a few choices and even though we are not partial to whites the ones she poured knocked our socks off. Also, very generous pours of 8-10oz.   The one mistake I did during this meal was order Absinthe as a final cocktail. I wish I hadn't. My wife wasn't finishing her wine, I was trying to do it for her. By the end of the meal and the Absinthe I needed help walking to our hotel room.   Overall 5/5. I mentioned the food, the wine, the staff...one thing you really need to keep in mind at Sage is the value. Their tasting menu is one of the less pricey in Vegas. You get a lot for what you give.",

You ever had that feeling that you were being judged in a high end store?  That's what that waitress was like.  Apparently she's never read Nordstrom's book.  We had appropriate attire and we were not rowdy.  She paid more attention to parties of 2 or 3.  When we finally got her attention, she just waved a finger at us to signal will be there in a minute.  Least she could do was walk by to directly tell us you'll help us in a minute.  You'll enjoy this restaurant.  I hope you don't get this waitress on a Sat night.  I had better service at In and Out Burger.",

The $130 5-course chef's tasting menu (mine consists of lightly smoked ora king salmon, seared foie gras, maine day-boat scallops, Japanese f1 wagyu, and chocolate pot de creme) was phenomenal. It was the perfect amount - not too much, not too little. Every dish was perfected and unique. My only disappointment is the bread. The mini baguettes, although not soggy, were way too hard. Overall great dining experience. Given the courses I would say it was well worth the $130. Would recommend to others.",

First of all, the table we were sat at was in a very weird location that felt like a table shouldn't have been there. The lighting was sharp and bizarre and honestly made me feel a bit queasy. Then, the service was slow and inattentive. It made me feel like we didn't matter or they didn't care that we were there.  First I had the Spring Arugula Salad. I knew I'd be having a steak so I wanted a light appetizer. It was... fine. Nothing you can't get anywhere else. I then had the Wagyu New York Strip. It was well cooked and seasoned and tasted nice, with a good texture. But the service and weird table were almost enough to ruin the whole evening.",

    "text": "We had 10pm reservations for a Monday night after being in Vegas for a trade show for a few days. We had heard great things about the Foie Gras Chocolate Bar. We arrived around 9:40 for the reservation and let them know we were here. They said they were just going to set up the table for us and it would be a few minutes. It was just us 4 so I didn't think it would take too long considering that and they didn't have any one else waiting for a table besides us. Well we finally got seated 20 minutes later after asking why it was taking so long. When we went to the dining room, there were a few tables open so it was a little annoying that it took them so long to seat us. They made up for it by offering us some champagne on the house.   The dining room was beautiful. Dimly lit and well decorated. It's perfect if you're looking for a nice date spot.   We only came for dessert so we ordered two of the foie gras chocolate bars and one of the foie gras creme brulee. I'm not a huge fan of foie gras but the chocolate bar was great. It came with caramelized popcorn on top. It wasn't overly sweet either. The foie gras creme brulee wasn't my favorite. It was a savory creme brulee which was a weird mix for me.   Overall the dessert stop was fine. I'd probably try here for dinner but skip the creme brulee foie gras.",

Both the secreto pork and Maine day boat scallops were prepared wonderfully and not a bite was left on our plates. Friendly, attentive and incredibly competent service from Virginia.

Jacob was fantastic, filling our water before it was even close to empty and swiftly helping wherever he was needed.  Robert brought us champagne when he found out it was our 10yr Anniversary.

We decided to try the Chef's Tasting Menu as we had not been there before and thought it would be a great option to sample the full essence of the restaurant. Sage is one of those places I've walked by a thousand times but never went in. I always thought it looked dark and sexy and it is. Sage is brought to you by James Beard award winning chef Shawn McClain who's other Las Vegas offerings include FIVE50 Pizza Bar and the new Libertine Social at Mandalay Bay. To be fair McClain stops in about twice a year. The chef is the very talented Chris Heisenger. It's considered New American Cuisine with an emphasis on California local harvests. The amuse bouche was a tasty Kuushi Oyster with Tabasco Sorbet and Tequila Mignonette,  delicious indeed! That wasn't on the menu so it was a nice start and surprise. As the dinner went on, each course was better than the next. The Ora King Salmon as the perfect first course and was followed by my personal favorite dish at Sage, the Oyster Beef Tartare. All of the other offerings were outstanding and complimented each other well. This menu was thought out and flowed like mountain spring. Service was flawless and friendly. Each dish was described to the detail and preparation. A wine pairing is offered but we declined. The cocktail program at Sage is among the best in Las Vegas and no one does a better Absinthe preparation in the country. Dinner was $150 and the wine pairing is offered for an additional $100. This menu does change as to what is in season and available. I highly recommend Sage and it's twice the culinary experience than E, by Jose Andres. Go and enjoy!",

There were multiple ways to dine - caviar, al a carte, or fixed. There was even a vegan menu. The most popular dish of the night were the scallops and the short rib. Short rib was braised for 36 hours. I'm a vegetarian - I had one of each item on the seasonal menu. The Heirloom Tomato Salad - light, fresh, aromatic. Sunchoke Tartare - first time for everything; rich flavors and smooth textures. Garnished with a cool rice cake. Finally, roasted eggplant - eggplant is not usually my first choice but this one was cooked to perfection in a sweet bbq sauce mixed with mushrooms and broccoli. Crushed it.   Dessert was so special - the staff came out and wished my Grandma happy birthday.   Super classy. Very delicious. 5 stars.",

But I still ordered the mash and it was good. The one thing I wasn't a big fan of were the oysters; can't say I would order those again.  The price was reasonable too, so in all I would say it's worth a visit here.",

    "text": "Exterior = 5/5 This is a bar and restaurant located on the first floor of Aria. It was a little difficult to locate at first, but we found it tucked away in the corner, near the lobby and Tetsu. There isn't really a waiting area, unless you sit near the check in line. For us, we didn't have to wait since we wanted to go to the bar (and there was space).   Interior = 5/5 Lighting was more on the dim side which set a nice relaxing mood. Music and other customer conversations weren't too loud so I could still converse with my boyfriend. I did notice that they were setting up some live music (we got there around 6:30pm on a Saturday), so that was probably for later. Tables were spaced out nicely, and there was a good amount of setting at the bar. We didn't find space, so we took a nice table near the back. My boyfriend mentioned he could see table spacing issue if the bar area was more packed.  Service = 5/5 Server was quick to come and ask for what we liked. We didn't go with food, since we had dinner plans, and we opted for the drink menu. When we did order our drinks, he poured them at our table so we were able to enjoy the experience as if we were sitting at the bar - which I really liked.  Order = 5/5 Smoke: 5/5 Boyfriend ordered this, and it was tasty. It came served in a bottle filled with smoke, with the liquor at the bottom. The server then opened the bottle and poured its contents into a waiting glass. The smoke poured out along with the drink and reminded me of dry ice. When we went to drink it, you could still smell the smoke (sounds weird but actually was really nice). Even the after taste had a little smokey flavor which was oddly enjoyable for me since I thought I would be turned off by it. The drink went down smooth and the after taste was a nice ending to each sip.  Cotton Candy: 5/5 I ordered this and wanted to come here specifically for this drink since it looked interesting on Yelp and the Aria tablet in our room. When I looked at what it was composed of I just read citrus and sugar. I was sold. When the drink came, it was cotton candy sitting in a martini glass. The server then poured the liquor slowly over the cotton candy, and I was smiling as I watched it melt till it became this pink liquid. I like the balance it had, since the tartness of the citrus was balanced out with the sweetness of the cotton candy. I enjoyed sipping it and trying to find the flavors.  Overall = 5/5 I was a nice place to go for evening drinks. The ambiance and menu options were great for a relaxing chat. I did wish that they had longer hours, since they are not open on Sundays and usually only open evenings only. I will have to come back and try the restaurant next time - though I will make a point to grab a drink since our first two were a hit.  Hint = If you are concerned about restaurant lines, go early and grab a seat in the bar area while it is nice and spacious.",

    "text": "Best place we ate at in LasVegas this week during CES. I had the tasting menu, which includes options for all four courses. I had the faugras brulee, divers scallops, wagyu, and  German Forest cake. My favorite were the brulee and the scallops. The brulee was very smooth and creamy with the thinnest crust on top. The flavor was unique blend of sweet (mostly) with a touch of rich savory from the liver part. The pan seared scallops are a normal item but these were just very nicely done.   The only things I didn't like about this nicely appointed restaurant are that the food takes a bit longer to come out than i would have expected. Also, I thought the wine list was overpriced. Even using the \"2x normal retail\" rule, they are super high.   All that said, this could easily be a five star with just a little more quickness and tuning. And, maybe the prices for wine are just my problem :-)  So, next time you're feeling flush, and you're in LV near the Aria Hotel, give it a shot!",

    "text": "I've been dying to try out Chef Shawn McClain's new restaurant... and when I found myself spontaneously going to Vegas for my spring break, I HAD to make a reservation for Sage. To be honest, I had really high expectations coming into this meal. I was definitely not disappointed.   The food was delicious, portion size just right, and pricing not too bad for Vegas. I especially liked the amuse bouche, which was the perfect way to start the meal. I also loved the bread that came with the meal (very reminiscent of the bacon brioche that is served at Melisse in Los Angeles).  For appetizers, I got the poached eggs with shaved truffles and country bread. Oh my god. I didn't know what country bread was until I ordered this... basically its super deep fried bread, aka. AMAZINGNESS!!!!!! I was afraid that the poach egg would be too simple, too plain, not impressive enough. BUT, instead, the flavors and texture of the poached egg complimented the umami taste of the truffles. Overall, this dish was just perfect. The oiliness of the bread was subdued by the soft creaminess of the poached egg yolk.  We also ordered the foie gras creme brulee, since foie gras has been deemed illegal in Cali..... I've been so deprived of this fatty goodness. I was hesitant about ordering this at first, fearing that the foie + egg would be too sweet and too creamy. However, the consistency and taste was just right. The layer of crunchy burnt sugar on top of the fluffy foie custard was perfection. In addition, there were blood oranges thrown in, giving the custard more depth.   For the entree, I got the chicken entree with braised celery and truffled sausage. Boy oh boy. The chicken was tender, the sauce was amazing, and the truffled sausage was sooo tasty. I'm never been a huge fan of white meat (woo juicy dark meat!).. but this piece of chicken breast was so tender and moist that I forgot for a split second that I was eating white meat!!  Overall, this was a great food experience. Only reason why this didn't 5 stars is that the service was a bit iffy. The servers weren't very attentive and we had to keep flagging them down to refill our waters and take our order. With that being said, it may have just been a down day. I'm excited to come and try the tasting menu next time that I am in Las Vegas!",

One of our fellow Yelpers had recommended him and he was great!  We had the 4 course meal and started off with the foie gras brulee (yum!).  Our next course was the grilled octopus followed by the 48 hour beef belly (soooo tender and delicious).  To end the meal, I had the milk chocolate medallion with raspberry coulis and dark chocolate.  Oh yeah, the amuse bouche was lamb tartar with champagne grapes.  Delicious!

    "text": "Too long, didn't read? WAY overpriced and overhyped for mediocre food and pretty crummy service.   The long of it: We were seated at 9pm for an 8:15 reservation. In the bar. I only got a peek at the restaurant because I used the restroom. A server came over and asked if we wanted water. Five minutes later he came and filled two glasses, ran out of water and came back some time later to fill the other two glasses.   Drinks were probably the highlight of the night, my friend got a really tasty jalapeno cucumber cocktail and my husband's old fashioned was on point. However, I ordered a glass of red wine, which they poured into the \"general wine glass\" which was on the table. My friend's husband ordered a white wine and his was in the same glass. I thought it was pretty odd and asked the server why they didn't have red wine glasses. They do. If you buy a bottle. Well for $22/glass I DID buy the bottle and you know it, plus I called you out on (what I consider) a tacky cost-cutting cop out: bring me a red wine glass. Bertucci's serves wine in the appropriate stemware. The fine dining restaurant in the Aria Resort and Casino can't get themselves together to figure out a wine glass??   Food was fine, the husbands definitely chose the better options with the beef belly and the short ribs. My rabbit was good but my friend's halibut was tasteless and overcooked. Dessert was a major flop of small deconstructed disappointments. I had a really excellent cappuccino though.   The more we discussed it, the more disappointed each of the four of us considered the experience. And it definitely wasn't sticker shock. We love finding great restaurants and paying for exceptional service and amazing food. This was just a Vegas markup. I wish we had gone to Bobby's Burger Palace and spent our money at the tables getting drunk on watered down vodka tonics.",

This place was outstanding!  Our server and sommelier were so friendly and helpful. It always makes a restaurant experience when you get top notch service. Our sommelier was able to help us pick out an amazing wine that we would've had trouble pairing with our food otherwise.   Get a cocktail, they are well mixed and delicious.   We did the chef's tasting menu. Course after course of goodness. The whole dinner seemed to have a playful autumn and smokey theme to it. Some highlights:  -Sourdough and bacon bread with flaky salt---mmmm! I wish there were more of it. Not the epic bread carts of some other restaurant, but tasty portions to get your salivary glands pumping.  -oyster shooter amuse bouche--plus tequila. Yum!  -Shaved foie gras on a walnut gelatin concoction.   -Day boat scallop was sweet buttery goodness.  -My husband had the egg yolk with a smokey foam---probably the best dish on the menu (from the vegetarian side of things)  -Ribeye was quite possibly the most delicious piece of beef I have ever tasted. Succulent, perfectly cooked, crispy sear. Oh my goodness!  -Pear custard with root beer bubbles. A nice palette cleanser.   -Petite sundae--like a fruity pebble dance in your mouth!  Wow, what a great night!  We left fat and happy. Would come here again to try a different menu.",

I have been here twice for dinner, once during Restaurant Week when it first opened (best decision ever) and then for my husband's birthday. Both times the food and service were beyond spectacular. The restaurant interior is impeccably decorated and provides the experience of a luxurious yet inviting restaurant.   For appetizers I have tried the steak tartare and roasted pumpkin soup, both really, really good. The pear and brussel sprouts salad with red endives in a bacon mustard vinaigrette, the wagyu short rib with an interesting horseradish potato puree and the ochicken were all excellent. For dessert I have tried a fruit tart-type of thing, the pineapple mousse and gelato.   The cocktails are excellent as well. I can't recall exactly what I drank but it had pine nuts in it, VERY INTERESTING. It wa super delicious, I highly recommend it.

Service was great, our waiter (wish I remembered his name) was nice and very attentive without being snooty.  I was impressed when he handed us an Ipad and a quick tutorial on how to view the drink menu on it.  Ok it takes little to impress me but still....  - Complimentary pre appetizer mango froth from the chef was light and tasty.  - Complimentary bacon bread and sourdough loaf with australian sea salt and butter- good but would have liked the bread to be warm.  - 36 hour wagyu braised short rib - flavorful, melts in your mouth short rib, heaven.    - The hubs had the $89 prix fix menu and chose the grilled oysters, Spanish octopus, Australian sirloin plus foie gras for 10 bucks extra and olive oil ice cream with hazelnut crunch and basil jam. - all amazing.  Sage is one of your pricier restaurants but hey it's Vegas, gotta splurge at least once or twice when you're here.  I wouldn't say the ambiance is super fancy but it's nice and worthy enough to get dressed up for.  I did see guys in there wearing jeans and a t-shirt, which I thought was kind of meh but just fyi if you were wondering about the attire.",

Our waiter transitioned service just after we were served our 3rd course (I've never experienced this at a \"fine dining\" restaurant with coursed dishes - typically the waiter finishes your service before leaving). We waited over half an hour to have our empty dishes removed from our table and then another 15 for our dessert to arrive. No apologies or explanation from the wait staff for the delay. Meanwhile, the tables of 60+ year-olds around us were being waited on hand and foot and never had empty wine glasses.  Very disappointed in this dining experience.

In fact, we walked out as happy and very satisfied diners.  I tried their 4-course Signature Tasting Menu and my husband went with the ala carte options. The wonderful thing about it is that the entire table doesn't have to do the tasting menu. Phew. However, if you want to do the 10-course menu then the entire table needs to also do it because of the complexity of trying to coordinate everyone's meals.  For the 4-course Signature Tasting Menu, you get to choose between options for each course. I chose the market oysters for my first course and to my surprise, I was given FIVE oysters! Woah! I love raw oysters on the shell so that was a great plus. Then I had the seared scallops which was also very good. The beef belly was the star of the tasting menu. It was so soft it literally melted in my mouth. Ended the tasting menu with profiteroles for dessert which was so good.  As for the ala carte menu which my husband went with, he had roasted sweetbreads which he was very happy about. I tried a piece and the soft texture was amazing. He had the hanger steak and it was prepared to perfection just as he requested: rare.  Service was also professional and attentive. Our server gave us a reasonable amount of time in between getting seated, ordering drinks, then food and also came to check in on us without overdoing it.  Sage is easily one of the top restaurants in Vegas.  Note to Chicagoans: I asked our server about Chef Shawn McClain and apparently he has plans to gradually close his restaurant businesses in Chicago to focus fulltime in his Las Vegas venture.",

    "text": "I had read some of the poor reviews below, and I was somewhat apprehensive about dining here.  In fact, I almost contemplated canceling my reservation, but I'm glad that I kept it as the food and service were exceptional.    We had heard that the specialty cocktails were tasty, so I ordered an Empire State...good but certainly not worth the Vegas price premium.  We did have the kumomoto oysters which featured a tabasco kick.  For our main course, we ordered the special:  Aged bone in Prime Ribeye steak for two which included the marrow.  It was sensational, and the presentation was equally good.  Throughout the meal, our waiter and the accompanying staff were extremely attentive.  I don't believe our water ever got to half full.  I would encourage those who are wavering to try Sage.  Date:  March 30th, 7pm",

    "text": "Once a month, a few friends and I get together to dine at a nice restaurant. Sage has been on our list for a long time. Three of us got there early and spent some time at the bar. The signature cocktails are innovative and fresh. Most of the ingredients are not your conventional elements and mixed well. Personally, I like the Moscow Mule. Served in the traditional copper mug, the blend of lime, ginger beer, and vodka hit the spot.   James, our server, was beyond amazing.   We started off with a glass of champagne. We found out that any full bottle of champagne or wine under $500 is half off. That is dangerous, because it lead to five bottles being consumed throughout dinner. It is a great deal for locals and a great way to get people to come back.   The best appetizers are the oysters with aged tequila mignonette and a Tabasco sorbet, roasted sweetbreads, and frois gras creme brulee. The wagyu beef tartare was decent. Nothing amazing or unique. The ones we could have done without were the octopus, yellowtail, and the brussel sprouts salad. The greens had too much of a bacon flavor. I never would have thought I'd be the one to say that. Normally bacon is the solution to all of life's problems. In this case, the smokiness was overbearing. Two different places have taught me that yellowtail is not to be ordered outside of sushi restaurants.   As for entrees, the veal cheeks and NY strip were melt in your mouth buttery goodness. The side of creamed potatoes were irresistible. The tile fish was not worth getting. I would suggest getting something else. Both of the pastas are impressive. The raviolis had large pieces of king crab meat on each stuffed pocket. The cavatelli had a generous amount of shaved truffles on it. The toasted pine nuts add a textural component to the dish that was complimentary. We were told that every dish was rich and heavy. By the end, I was done for. If death was at my door, I would gladly go.   Desserts are Sage's weak point. The sweet potato sundae was the best offering. Otherwise the other three desserts we ordered were forgettable. Skip dessert and just order another entree. Otherwise go to Jean Philippe Patisserie.",

    "text": "Beautiful space, wonderful food....but not 5 stars.   I wanted to go somewhere nice and kind of fancy on our trip to Vegas. I posted to Talk and this was one of the suggestions from my fellow Yelpers. Thanks for the great suggestion.   We arrived a bit early for our 7:45 reservation so we could have a cocktail in the bar. I had a tea infused martini and my dining companion had a scotch. Service in the bar was good. The hostess came and got us promptly at 7:45 for our table. I appreciated how she carried our drinks for us to the table.   We were seated at a table with one side chair and one side booth on the end. It was cozy and the atmosphere very private and welcoming. We received an amuse bouche from the chef. It was a tomato and avocado treat. I loved it! We also received our choice of bread. I went with a basic bread, he had the bacon roll thing. Both were good. I liked the whipped butter served with sea salt. Perfect compliment.   For an appetizer, I ordered the poached egg with shaved truffles, dining companion had the yellow-tail sushi roll. I liked the egg, but I always forget truffles give me heartburn. The combination of truffle, egg, and potato puree really worked well together. He enjoyed his sushi.   I had the asparagus soup instead of salad, he had the beet salad. The soup was probably the best soup I've ever had. It was by far my favorite part of the meal.   My main dish was gnocchi, he had fish. The gnocchi was with cauliflower and other veggies. It was good, but a bit salty.   We typically do not order dessert, but we were on vacation, so I caved for the lime tart with fresh blueberries. It's been a long winter with not too many good fruits where I'm from, so that was the perfect end to the meal.   Everything was very good, but why not 5 stars? Here's why -  1. Although the food runners were good, our server disappeared for long periods of time.  2. There was a woman walking around trying to take and sell us a picture. This is a restaurant, not an amusement park. I found it off putting.  3. Not many wines by the glass to choose from. My dining companion and I don't like the same kind of wine, so a bottle is out of the question.   All in all, a good meal with great choices, presented beautifully. I'm glad we ate at Sage, but I'm not sure I would go back.",

    "text": "Wonderful restaurant!  Another winner at Aria (we love Julian Serrano).  Not at all your typical Vegas restaurant - it is hushed and elegant, with superb food and very good service.  If you need refuge from the chaos which defines Vegas, you could do worse than slip into Sage for a meal.  After a weekend full of gluttony, we couldn't handle much more than a couple of appetizers, so we sampled the beef tartare, which was a very nicely done version of the classic; the grilled octopus, which wasn't bad but probably wasn't the strongest of our dishes; and the poached egg.    Okay, let me say something about the poached egg.  This thing is so good, we actually had to order a second one!  My mouth is watering just thinking about it! It is a perfectly poached egg served over some sauteed potatoes and then topped with shaved biancetto truffles (spring truffles, sort of a cross between a white and a black truffle), and served with lovely toasted rustic bread.  When you crack the yolk, it forms this melange of tastes and textures, and when eaten on top of the bread, it is ... well it's sublime!  This dish alone is reason to head to Sage next trip to Vegas!",

GREAT value... what else you need?  the wine pairing we had could probably be better... besides that our experience was nice! we ordered the $79 chef's menu, and it was enough food since the portion wasn't small!  the complimentary breads were just OK... i am not sure about the lavender flavor butter for the bread either... i think it'd be better if the breads were hot...   the appetizers are the ones we loved the most.  the beef tartar, foie gras, and the oysters are all really amazing... i like the oysters the best cus they are light but still flavorful... the foie gras and beef tartar are awesome too but it gets heavy towards the end...  the rabbit does have a little after taste (actually, it taste like pork!)... but the ravioli was yummy... i liked the veal better than the pork loin... but they are both really well made, the presentation as well as the taste...   towards the end we are so full and not sure if that's the reason we didn't like the deserts too much - but the citrus infused chocolate syrup shots (warm) complimented from the chef was pretty amazing!",

Plus, the portions are very generous for the price and service was surprisingly warm and friendly (I'm not sure what some people were complaining about... Just go to a buffet if you are looking for quantity over quality)  The wife and I got 2 signature tasting menus with the wine pairings (90 + 45 each; you can't beat that!) Oysters w/ tequila blood orange mignonette - just the right amount of flavor as to not overpower the delicately sweet oysters Foie gras brulee - the highlight of the dinner and a must have. Make sure you let it melt in your mouth and then wash it down with the wine pairing. Believe me, I fought to not lick the dish clean. Octopus - I LOVE octopus, but this none fell a bit short. Very tender, but the flavors seemed to fight each other and I ended up picking out the octopus to dip in the sauce of the next dish Scallops with braised oxtail and oyster mushrooms - this dish was up there with the foie gras for top dish of the night. Unbelievable sear in the scallop and a succulent sauce with just enough mushrooms and oxtail.  Pork loin - solid dish. A bit rich but the pork really was incredible Wagu sirloin - melts in your mouth and, again, an unbelievable sear that made you wonder how they possibly maintained a perfect med rare Olive oil ice cream with chocolate and raspberries - delicate ice cream and beautiful presentation. Very good. Blueberries with lavender ice cream - powerful lavender and beautifully macerated blueberries made for a truly unique dish.  Well done Sage - we will definitely be back!",

Kudos to Alex Strata who actually resides here to oversee his pride and joy.   Sage by Chef Shawn McClaine is another great restaurant in every way shape and form. The menu and wine list are strong and diverse. The quality of ingredients is definitely there. Let's not talk about price because you get what you pay for. We had a party of eight and tried just about everything on the menu except for maybe 3 entrees and 3 vegetarian dishes. The beet salad was refreshing and sublime. The sweet breads and veal cheeks were rich, flavorful and satisfying. Presentation on all the dishes was perfect, balanced and well thought out. The few weaknesses in my opinion were the lobster ravioli, hamachi crudo and pork tenderloin which was on the dry side. Lobster dish was decent but just not great. The sauce lacked somewhat in depth and the ravioli were okay. Hamachi was not bad, but maybe going with a Kampachi would be a better choice.   Desserts were good and service was very attentive. All in all it was a very nice evening and the atmosphere was relaxing. Will return again to try more dishes.",

I just didn't get the, \"Wow\" factor I was hoping for.  My husband ordered the Steak and mashed potatos. The steak was excellent, very tender and well cooked.

You can converse which is lovely--as some Vegas restaurants are loud and obnoxious. The portions are generous for the price, and the ingredients were incredibly fresh. I opted to do the 4 course tasting menu, which was plentyyyy of food and only $80 (you can wine pair for an additional $40). I had the wagyu beef tartar (perfect consistency and temp but a tad bit bland to be honest), maine scallops w/ braised oxtail and broccolini (yummmX1000), 48 hour beef belly (I'm not a hugeeeee beef belly fan but whatever, it was tasty), and some chocolate amazing desert with mocha icecream. My friends had the fluke, skirtsteak & the octopus as an app which could have easily been a smaller main! The service was attentive without being annoying, and they were knowledgeable about the food/wine/spirits.  PS--I don't recommend the ginger cocktail though (forget the name, but was served in a quaint copper cup) and they gave us a complimentary after-dinner \"chocolate soup\" shot which was horrible and tasted heavily like chai (Chef McClain, if you're reading this please stop! lol) Cheers!",

    "text": "I have been to Vegas 4 times and this was, by far, the best culinary experience yet!  My husband arrived on Tuesday and I was set to arrive on Thursday.  He was there for work and my birthday happened to be during the same week he was there - bonus!  I love to research, so I had looked into a few restaurants for our last night there (Saturday).  We already had plans for Thursday and Friday - Little Buddha in Palms and Sirio in Aria (both were excellent as well)!  Since we were staying at Aria, I researched their restaurants thoroughly.  With it being a fairly new hotel, I knew we couldn't go wrong.  I stumbled upon the reviews for Sage and was completely mesmerized!  There were no bad reviews and the recommendations were repeated over and over again.  I had to try it.  On the final day, my husband cancelled my \"surprise reservations\" at CraftSteak and we were able to obtain a 9:30p reservation at Sage - perfect.  First of all... if you can... ask for Bond.  He was terrific and made the experience even MORE enjoyable than it would have been with an average server.  My husband and I beamed the entire time we were there and are still talking about it!  First course... The ever SO popular Foie Gras Custard Brulee and the Slow-Poached Organic Farm Egg.  While we were so-so impressed with the Egg (nothing special in our eyes), the Foie Gras Custard Brulee was OUT OF THIS WORLD.  I have never had foie gras and was never planning on have foie gras, but after reading the reviews, I had to try it \"just once\".  It was amazing... the crisp brulee topping (just like the dessert) and the creamy texture of the foie gras was worth the trip alone.  The Salted Brioche that came with it was superb.  The brioche was salty and sweet and I would have welcomed an entire basket if possible.  A must try!    The amuse bouche (1-biter) served in between courses was ok.  I like trying new things, so it was fun for me.  I believe it was pate, a green bean and sauce.    Our main courses were delectable!  We asked our waiter for recommendations and he quickly suggested the scallops (Roasted Day Boat Scallops).  My husband got the hanger steak.  My meal can be described in one word - HEAVENLY.  I had eaten scallops the night before, but I didn't want to pass up the recommendation.  And I am so glad I didn't.  The scallops were cooked perfectly, the oxtail/mushroom mixture was extremely savory and the best part was... the salted caramel reduction sauce.  I would bathe in this.  My husband's meal was wonderful too, but we both agreed that the scallops were the star.  Dessert was a big question... so our waiter, as great as he was, suggested a few things.  For me, he suggested his signature drink, the Cappuccini.  A shot of cappuccino, Kahlua, Baileys and vodka.  It came out in a martini glass with a frothy top and 3 coffee beans for decoration.  I consciously had to try and sip it... I really wanted to pour it all over me so I could savor the flavor throughout the evening.  My husband's dessert was a little more \"out there\"... his dessert of choice was Absinthe.  Yes, the \"recently legalized Absinthe\".  My husband had never tried it and like me, wanted to be adventurous.  Our waiter explained that it is usually served over a melted sugar cube, but he had his own way of serving it... if we dared.  We dared.  Given a few choices, my husband chose the flavor \"vanilla\".  The extravagant cart of different absinthes was eventually rolled over.  There were multiple choices to choose from along with a hi-ball glass filled with ice and a shot of vanilla flavoring.  After choosing the waiter's favorite Absinthe (we couldn't go wrong with his suggestions), he placed a sifter on its side in the hi-ball glass.  In went the healthy shot of absinthe.  Then came the flame.  The shot was lit on fire and twirled around in the glass for a few seconds before he picked up the sifter and poured the shot into the vanilla.  The sifter was pretty far from the hi-ball glass so you were able to see the blue flame tunnel its way down to the glass.  SO COOL.  Once the drink was poured, our waiter covered the sifter and had my husband use a straw to suck the vapors out of the glass.  Then, while holding his breath, take a big sip of the drink.  WHOA!  He was able to do this one more time (while the fumes were still present) and WHOA again.  He said it was biggest rush!  What an experience!!!!  (p.s. do not try this at home)  We will definitely go back to Sage and we will definitely ask for BOND!  A++++",

I had the Scallops which were AMAZING. my mom loved her halibut, and my other girl friend raved about her steak. The service was absolutely EXCELLENT. our server Jason (said to call him Smith) was great-super conversational and funny. the service was fast but not rushed- we enjoyed plenty of drinks and sat for a while and never felt rushed or like we were being pushed out or anything. The ambiance was perfect, it was a little expensive but well worth it! the portions were perfect size and we were all full when we were done. The food was all amazing so i truly feel that it was fairly priced. I honestly cannot say enough good things about this place- definitely check out Sage when you're in Vegas.",

    "text": "Sadly, a very disappointing experience. I picked Sage for our first night in Vegas because I thought it would be a great way to kick-off a foodie weekend. I gladly charged my way down the Chef's Specialty Tasting Menu.  Maybe my appetizer was an anomaly, but I did not like the Foie Gras Creme Brulee.  Keep in mind that normally, foie gras, in all it's glorious forms, is a little bit of heaven to me. But over-processed to a flavorless, bland custard and layered with a thick caramelized shell of sugar? Paired with a thick, sweet dessert wine? It was a travesty and definitely not worth an extra $10.   But every restaurant has it's bad moments and I eagerly awaited redemption with the next course. The bacon-wrapped rabbit on top of a carrot puree ravioli with salsify sauce was not bad. It was a very small portion (two bites of rabbit), but acceptable for a tasting menu. Overall, nothing amazing, but a decent taste. The third course saw another okay flavor in a small package. I had the crispy pork shoulder. However, a single pork tenderloin medallion and a 3-in by 2-in by 2-in piece of crispy pork shoulder from a terrine didn't add up to my expectations. It was okay, but nothing special - especially when paired with a gag-worthy, overly-peppered red. And finally dessert - the low point of the meal. I wanted a light finish to the meal and ordered the pear poached in Riesling. The pear tasted like - a pear. But the 4 tiny slivers were laid out on a single, warped piece of phyllo dough beside an ice cream bite, sprinkled with thyme. And the ice cream? It tasted like a cross between a cheap Rouquefort and 'something funky'. I thought it very telling that when we asked for the mystery flavor to be decoded, our waiter apologized for the 'recent experimentation in the kitchen with black truffle oil' and offered to bring any other dessert.  I felt bad - he seemed embarrassed to have been involved with that fiasco of a dessert. But really -  black truffle OIL ice cream?! Sorry Sage - your chef's taste's are definitely too \"special\" for me.",

    "text": "This was my first stay at Aria and I was thrilled to find a restaurant on the property with a vegan dining menu. Just for accommodating the vegan/vegetarian crowd  with an entire menu I commend Sage but overall this was the most disappointing meal over the course of our four day stay. I selected the four course vegan menu and just none of it had really great flavor (in my personal opinion. If you're using melon and corn cakes without fresh corn and one small slice of zucchini as a zucchini steak I think you need GREAT flavor. BUT most of all - if you're serving a plant based meal , it will take more food to fill up a person than the servings you would use for meat, dairy, etc. I left so hungry - really hungry but was in a rush to see a show. I really don't expect that to be the case when you're spending $75 for a tasting menu. I had to leave mid show to get something to hold me over and then went to lemongrass when I got back to Aria for essentially a second dinner. I do love that the restaurant is trying to accommodate plant based eaters and clearly this is a review of mostly that experience. My partner had a steak dish (steak frites?) and said his was fine - not great, not memorable. I will stick with some of the other options going forward.",

First, service was great and the sommelier was great.  We ordered the signature menu (4 courses, $99 with the foie gras creme brulee).  Plus 2 bottles of California wine and tip came to $165 person).  My knock against Sage is the meal lacked passion!  Exception was the Foie Gras.  Everything else was over-sauced and our pork loin was overcooked.  The Day Scallops would have been a whole lot better if their delicate flavor was enhanced, rather than drowned by the sauce.  The chocolate/olive oil desert looked like it skidded off the plate, making eating a bit of conundrum.",

Service was amazing, the waiters never let our water glasses go empty.    And the food was delicious, hence, I live my life filling it up with food that makes my tummy go yummm.  They give two choices of breads, a sausage biscuit one or a sourdough one which the sausage biscuit was warm and fresh.   The waiters offered an Amuse Bouche of Onion Soup with Toasted Sunflowers as well.  Onions are normally so pungent, but the aroma of this soup was extremely comforting and smooth, hats off to the Chef (who is also from San Diego :) ).  I ordered the Seared Bigeye Tuna Sashimi to share with everyone which included 5 slices of melt in your mouth tuna.  I had ordered the Braised Veal Cheeks which was extremely tender, while my friends ordered the Maine Boat Scallops and the Potato Arctic Char which both extremely flavorful as well.  The waiters also gave us another sample of a Chocolate Kahlua soup at the end of our meal with our desserts that was delish!  Very rich chocolate and it was absolutely perfect for our group of girls :)   I just wanted to try something a little different than what the prix fixe menu had offered, and I thought the Chef did a great job, however, I can also see how others could also say that there wasn't anything too impressive because you are able to find each of some of the ingredients such as tuna, steaks, scallops at other restaurants as well.  The main point I'm making is that when I go out to eat, I'm looking at the artistic point of view of how the chef turns these simple items into something memorable which is why I'm writing this review.  This place is wonderful for groups of family and friends with great service.  It is rather on the pricier side, but you are paying for service and ambiance which was top notch.  Sage Restaurant, I love your waiters, the hostess and the Chef.  I hope to visit again soon!",

I still remember being speechless from the hamachi shashimi & another appetizer I had, even before my entree arrived. We went back, last time we were in Vegas, eager to have the same experience and...well, its was....good. Meaning, it didn't blow our socks off like the first time, but there was nothing we could complain about. Granted we live in San Francisco now, so we never have a shortage of amazing places to eat. But my palate is still always appreciative of new combinations of flavors. Maybe it was what I ordered? Not sure. I still recommend it, based mostly on our first experience and will probably give it another chance to 'wow' me. But only 4 stars until then.",

    "text": "2.5 stars.  Now this may not be 100% True, but judging by the previous review and what we saw, if you are asian, you will be escorted to the back of the restaurant.  When we arrived, it was quite empty, but we were kindly taken to the rear room, which is sectioned off behind the cash registers and some decor.  There was an old couple and a chinese family in there, and soon another asian family and another asian couple joined us in the back.  We noticed it was fairly strange, and so when we finished eating, we checked out the other guests and our suspicions were confirmed.  However, I should note there was a non-asian couple that was seated in the back when it got busier.  As for the restaurant, the decor is nice, the pork loin tastes like ham, but for now (perhaps since it's new), the chef gives a complimentary foam and grapefruit amuse appetizer and citrus infused hot cocoa drink to finish your meal, which is nice, along with the bacon bread, which adds a 1/2 star.  Also, the service was very attentive and timed quite well, with a lot of care taken to keeping our table tidy, which adds another star, however we're just left with a bad taste in our mouth after feeling discriminated against.  So if you are asian, prepare to have a party with the others in the back.",

Thankfully Sage is more of the former than the latter.  The dining room and decor were very nice.  dark, rich colors, tasteful art and great floor plan layout.  I liked the fact that there is lots of room between tables so it doesn't feel like you're shoehorned into a dining room concerned about turning tables or packing it full.  Food was solid.  very good.  spectacular/original?  not quite, but safe, solid and focused on quality ingredients.  Appetizers are sized/plated for individuals, but the portion is big enough to give 2-3 people a bit or two and still have enough leftover for your self.  I had the beef tartare which was super rich and good, but the consensus was the red snapper carpaccio was the star appetizer.  The appetizers were all very good (even better than our entrees).  I had the scallops with red wine reduction, mushrooms and pieces of braised oxtail.  It was a bit over salted and I thought was missing a starch or veggie side.  overall solid.  I also got to try the the braised short ribs which was good in a small portion but almost too overwhelming to eat a plate of it.  The veal cheeks were tender and was probably the most impressive entree.  We didn't have desert here, but they have an absinthe cart and put on a little show by lighting it on fire which was pretty cool.  Staff was attentive and nice.  Overall, it's a solid choice for dinner and they did NOT offer bacon bread.  They changed it to an herb bread or a cheese bread about a week ago...sad times for the lack of swine bread.",

    "text": "4.5 stars  I was in Vegas this past weekend for a bachelorette party and we came here for dinner on Saturday.  We originally planned dinner at 7:45 but we arrived early to walk around the Aria and City Center because some of the party people has never been there (me included).  However, we did not end up walking around because we were hungry, and asked if you would be able to be seated sooner than our reservations.  They were able to seat us early, mostly due to the Mayweather/Cotto fight that was happening, the restaurant was not too full.  Our party choose to have the prix fixe menu ($79), it would be simple to divide the check at the end.  But our server did inform us before ordering, if one gets the prix fixe menu they ask the whole table order from that menu, and the table will only receive one check.  After ordering, we received an amuse-bouche of tuna tartar with avocado mousse.  It was very taste and only there was more.  For the first course, I choose the Waygu beef tartar, my first time with beef tartar, it was good but I think if you prefer your beef more on the cooked side, choose another dish.  I had a sample of the oysters, which was another choice.  They tasted fresh but the size of the oysters were on the small side, but you do have to consider this was a prix fixe menu item.  Someone from the table ordered the foie gras brulee (this is an addition $10 if you choose this for the 1st course), and I had one bite of it.  My first time with foie gras and it tasted really good.  For the next course, I had the seared scallops, this was one of my favorites.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and were very tender. I tried a piece of the other offering which was the bacon wrapped rabbit. I have never had rabbit before but it did taste like chicken, and wrapped bacon around anything and it will taste good.  The 3rd course, I had the 48 hour beef belly.  It was pretty good and tender, it was fatty but its the belly, so what do you expect.  I had a piece of the pork lion, the other option, many of the girls at the table felt it was salty, but I think if you ate it with everything all together it will balance out the saltiness.  The last course was dessert, I had the pave (there was something before it but I don't remember what it was).  This was a chocolate bar meets dessert as our server described it.  It was very tasty and if you like chocolate this is good. I liked the filling but did not care much for the crunchy parts of it.  There was coffee ice cream which was very smooth and delicious.  The service here I experienced was very attentive and friendly.  We did not have to wave down a server for anything.  There was not much waiting in-between each course, but then again if you are with good company time flies.  Everyone left feeling full and happy with the meal.  I hope if I come here again, I would like the tasting menu with is the 6-course option, but the server informed us it will take about 2.5 hours.  We'll see, until next time Vegas!",

    "text": "My wife and I went here for a special meal and it definitely delivered.  I ordered the small tasting menu and my wife ordered the Seaboat Scallops.  Pumpkin puree - very full flavor.  Don't particularly line Pumpkin but we both enjoyed this dish  Pear salad with bacon and light vinaigrette - very light and refreshing.  Good balance of flavors  Spanish octopus salad - incredibly tender.  One of the best that we've ever had.  I don't like octopus and really enjoyed this dish.  Wagyu beef - Absolutely top notch.  Incredible flavor and just the right combination of fat and meat.  Seaboat scallops.  Four huge, well cooked scallops.  The oxtail with mushroom reduction was a very nice contrast  Dessert was the pistachio tart with strawberry ice cream.  Overall very decent dish.  The service was top notch.  Great decor and atmosphere.  Our server was named Bond.  Make sure to ask for him.  He was attentive but not overbearing; as well as knowledgeable about the dishes.  The timing of each dish was spot on.  To finish it off our server brought us a special after-dessert dessert.  Hot chocolate with fleur de sel.  Amazing taste and mouth feel to this dish.",

The food was delicious, from the lobster soup appetizer to my wife's steak and my lamb to the dessert. Great presentation and exquisite tastes. The service was also top notch. Our server did appear a bit cold and business-like at the start of the meal but warmed up towards the end thus making this a five star review.",

    "text": "Sorry, but Sage just doesn't do it for us.   I know that I would be the odd one out in the sea of 4-star and 5-star reviews, but hey, I tell it like it is.  Our dinner was at 7.30 and we thought we had ample time to get ready before heading to our table at XS (I told our host we would get there at 11.30).    But we were late - a large part of it was due to our server.  He was nice and all, but boy was he slow.  He gave us our menu, left, came back 15 minutes later to go through the specials, and left again, during which time we decided to go with the four-course signature menu.  At that time, it was already 8 and we were ready to kick off the dinner, but our server was busy chatting with other patrons despite the fact that he acknowledged that we were ready to order.  Another 10 minutes passed before he finally wrapped up his earnest discussion and finally took our order.   $79 for the four-course dinner plus $39 for wine pairing seemed like a great deal, until the courses were served.  The dishes ranged from underwhelming to pure nasty.  My beef tartare was the latter and the beef belly was the former (maybe I'm uneducated and unsophisticated but, I don't come across beef belly too often.  I'd like to think it's for a good reason because well, it just doesn't taste good and I could think of a bunch of other parts of the cow that are infinitely better).  The best dish was dayboat scallops, which were plump and fresh.    But the entire experience, plus the price tag, just made for a bad meal overall.",

It is about a good of a meal as I have had in New York, London or Paris.  Its pricey but every bit worth it.  Its a culinary experience and  you have to prepare to pay for one.  I cannot say more, I cannot say less.  Everything tried was unique, fresh and the flavors built up with time in palate.  Thats when we know we have experienced something special, and this place was that plus.  Dont miss this next visit to Las Vegas",

    "text": "Maybe I made the wrong choice between Sage and Julian Serrano at Aria.  We made reservations on the same day with the chick at the desk in front of the restaurant. Nice decor, wine bottles and all, deceivingly huge.   Anyways, we walked through the lounge at the front of the restaurant and were seated in the back. Spacious, very spacious with high ceilings, mirrors and weird murals. The mural I'm referring to is the one to the left as you first enter that back dining room. I didn't understand why it was even in this restaurant; it was a painting of farmers and kind of purple-ish.   Our server was ok, maybe trained to promote more food than we needed to order. Menu items range in prices from $15-$40 per entree. So, upon ordering our entree, our server asks \"how would you like to start?\" I'm like \"??\" What she meant was, pick out another dish from another area on the menu, as if it came with our entree. Nope. She made it sound like it was included. So, I ordered the gnocchi (soft and pasty with brussel sprouts and radish) and cobia, which was not all that great. The fish had a nice seared crust but that was about it. Kind of bland, medium in tenderness and nothing special about it. Mashed potato was thinned out and didn't have much good flavor.  The \"chowder\" sauce they poured in my dish was nothing like chowder unless chowder is that watery. I felt like I was dining with Top Chefs, so now I understand the harsh critique. But I am no Padma.  For dessert we ordered the beignets with a caramel sauce with tiny bits of apples. It was cute because they were like doughnut sticks in fancy applesauce. I could probably do better using krispy kreme doughnuts and mott's applesauce.  They don't listen. The sommelier asked if we wanted to keep the wine menu and we replied with yes, yet he took it away? When given the option to pick a bread from a wood case I requested sourdough; he gave me bacon. WTF? What if I was allergic to bacon? Although, I have to say that the bread and fancy butter was good, at least when it was warm. Oh and when our meal was over, the waitress handed us our check. It was wrong...about $300. wrong. She apologized profusely but still, c'mon that's a huge difference. The only good thing she brought us was the complimentary orange infused hot chocolate  shot at the end of our meal.   It's not that I can't appreciate a fine dining experience, but there was nothing fine about it. Actually, the water boy was great. He made a point of keeping our glasses full without splashing water all over the place because he shielded the pour with a cloth napkin. Nice. Will not dine here again.",

We both looked like crap! we are two guys in our 30's, shorts and mismatched shirts... we probably should have been told no, but were told that we could eat in the bar if \"we wanted.\"   Great! No one knows us in this place... so we sat down at a table for two in an open area in front of the Bar. My friend started on Beer and I jumped into Appleton Rum.   Our waitress was an all star... she could have taken us as a bad investment, but she did not. After 4 courses and 4 drinks each our bill and tip was $300. We sat there and people watched and discussed life for 2 hours and never felt rushed.   I must say, that we were fish out of water, and next time I will dress up a bit more.",

So it's pretty much equivalent to going to heaven and taking a nap because I don't remember anything after.  Definitely sexy  It's the kind of restaurant you want to spend your dinners at in Vegas.

I wish I had an endless stomach.  For occasions like this, I want to eat their food forever. Try their tasting menu or off a la carte in this exact order: 1) Vancouver Island Oysters 2) Wagyu Beef Tartare 3) Grilled Spanish Octopus 4) Main Day Boat Scallops 5) 48 Hour Beef Belly 6) Meyer Lemon Cheesecake .............then tell the kids to close their eyes.",

    "text": "Located by registration and the neighboring crystals wing of the expansive Aria resort, this unassuming contemporary restaurant had me intrigued as soon as I stepped inside.   As we traversed through the dimly lit bar flanked with purple hued impressionist walled paintings that soared up to the high ceilings and into the main dining area, I couldn't help but be impressed by the sleek modern club-like feel of the space. It was the perfect mix of contemporary cool with traditional elegance. With chilled house music pulsating in the background, I did get an ultra lounge vibe from the restaurant, which was actually refreshing and relaxing. We also didn't feel crammed next to our neighboring diners, which made things feel much more intimate and private.  Our server was full of friendly banter and made every effort to make us feel welcome.    We all went with the Signature Tasting Menu.  The wait staff knew that we were heading out to a show afterwards so they made sure our dishes came out at a good pace.   We were started with a tuna tartare amuse bouche that was just the right mouthful of tang & punch of flavor to whet our appetites.  The first courses were all very good. From the fresh oysters to the beautifully prepared wagyu beef tartare to the exceptionally inventive foie gras brulee.  The second courses were inspiring and enjoyable, as well. The octopus was grilled to perfection and the dayboat scallops were easily the best I've ever had! These thick golden medallions were beautifully seared on the outside locking in a fluffy and buttery flesh that left me in complete awe bite after bite.  Our third courses were also winners in my book.  The wagyu sirloin was mouthwatering and each tender bite was blissful. The 48 hour braised beef was incredibly soft and you could tell it was cooked for awhile for all those rich, permeating flavors to develop.  Desserts were exquisite and what could be better than a surprise at the very end! A shot of cinnamon hot white chocolate. It was both warm comforting and festive. An excellent end to an amazing meal.   I can't say enough about my wonderful experience here. It's definitely one I'd gladly experience again and again.  Happy Eats!",

    "text": "A top notch restaurant that was delicious from start to finish.  The people working there will literally give you the shirt off their back!  My wife was freezing and our excellent server offered the manager's cardigan to wear during dinner.  Who does that??  We went with Chef McClain's Signature Menu for $89.  No wine pairings because I am usually too buzzed at the end to appreciate the flavors.  I started with the \"Wagyu Beef Tartare\" with crushed caper aioli, slow poached egg and dark chocolate.  Chocolate and beef isn't a combo I am usually down with but it was a fun twist that totally worked.  I literally could've had this as my whole meal.  The buttered and grilled sourdough bread complemented it perfectly.  My wife got the \"Foie Gras Brulee\" which was wow, wow, wow.  It was such a creative dish and a wild mix of flavors upon first taste but it just got better and better after each bite.  It's ok to lick the dish, right?  This could have been a dessert and I wondered if the chef ever considered that.    I got the \"Australian Wagyu Sirloin\" for my main entree.  It was as tender as expected but I was ready to swap after having a bit of the 48 hour beef belly.  That was treeeeemendous and what I would go with had I done it all over again.    \"Gianuja Pave\" was my choice for dessert.  It's not often I get to try olive oil ice cream with basil jam.  That was a really excellent ending to the meal and kept up with the creativity of the experience.",

    "text": "This place is a solid 4.  Maybe with a lower price I could go 5, but definitely a four.    My wife got the vegan tasting menu.  I don't quite understand why they don't advertise this more.  Sadly I don't remember too much about it, but it did have a really good variety of fresh veggies with some creative sauces and applications.  Great use of some unique meaty mushrooms to make up for the absence of meat.    I started with the foie Gras.  I don't know if I just don't like it or I just didn't like this one.  The brioche was almost too salty as it was hard for my palate to distinguish the flavors. I don't think I would order again, probably the lowlight of the meal.   I go the scallops.  Oh my goodness.  Probably one of the best bites I've ever had.  I would order a whole bowl of that and eat it every day.  Sweet, savory, rich, fresh. Just all the wonderfulness of the beef, scallops and mushrooms.    For the entree I got the beef belly.  Great textures and flavors of fat and meat.  My only complaint was that the starch it was on was really gummy and a little unpleasant.  The portion was very small, but I guess that's what I paid for.    The coconut basil foam dessert was a treat.  Cool play of textures and temperatures in the foam that hardened on the ice.  very fresh end to a wonderful meal.   If every item had lived up to the scallops I would give it a five, but if you are going to charge that much, you definitely will be help to a higher standard.   The service was very professional and accommodating.  No complaints there.",

    "text": "Came here back in October for my husband's surprise birthday trip to Vegas. We stayed at Aria Sky suites so this was a restaurant he wanted to try since the last time we were in Vegas. We are definitely glad we came to sample their menu.  First of all, the restaurant is tastefully decorated...it's trendy but has an old world charm feeling to it. Maybe it's the absinthe station I saw walking in....but I was absolutely obsessed with trying it out once I saw it. But first, I want to first speak on the impeccable service that we received. I hate that I forgot his name but he was so knowledgeable about the menu and made great suggestions on drinks. He even explained everything I needed to know about trying out absinthe for the first time. Which I will get to later :) I had the cotton candy cocktail and omg it is so good! I love food and drinks that \"wow\" me. So of course when he brings me a drink with a cup and nothing but cotton candy in it, I was instantly trying to figure it out. He pour liquor over it, and I could see the cotton candy melting into the drink. I knew instantly this was going to be a good one!!!! I forgot what my hubby ordered, but it was equally impressive. Their drink menu is awesome. I really wanted to try several, but I am a light weight and I really wanted to try to save some room for the absinthe. When it came down to ordering the absinthe, our server gave us a little history and how the menu works. If you see it you would know what I mean, it's a little confusing to read. But he gave me suggestions, so I ordered the original and the St. Germaine. Honestly, even though they are suppose to taste different, It was still not my cup of tea---the taste just isn't for me. If you like star anise favor then this is for you. But I am glad we tried it out anyway. I am always down to try anything once! Even if it's poison! haha Now to the food...you will see beautiful pictures of their signature scallop dish all around Aria. My mouth would water every time I saw it, so it was so brainer what I was going to order. Guess the advertisement worked because my husband ordered the same too lol. That  dish is absolutely delicious, perfect flavor combination with the soft tender oxtails. Everything cooked to perfection.  A must try. Oh, I also ordered the foie gras creme brulee since I just love foie gras....it is definitely different but it is quite rich for one person. So even though it's small serving I would suggest sharing it with someone, unless you just LOVE the fattiness of it all to yourself. But it is different, and I am so glad I ordered it. So hard to explain it... There is just so many different textures and flavors going on at the same time! They also send you different types of \"shooters\" in between courses to clear your palette. For example, one I remember was a fruity one (I think it was Mango?) but it was very refreshing. And I love that because it really resets your palette. I noticed this trend taking place in more luxury dining establishments now and I like it.  It was definitely a great evening. Give this place a try if you are in Vegas next time.",

I ordered a cucumber cocktail (SO DELICIOUS) and he got a beer.  We ordered the grilled octopus appetizer to start, and it was soooo tender (definitely order if you're into octopus).  We both ended up getting the salmon entree.  Salmon was cooked so well, with such crispy skin.  We obviously made the mistake of getting the same entree and not trying two different ones.  We also ordered the lemon thyme foam with pomegranate sorbet dessert with this foam that was absolutely amazingggg. We got this because we were looking for something kind of tart to end our dinner with, and it did the trick.  Service was amazing- very attentive and friendly.",

My girlfriends and I chose to do the Signature tasting menu which was more than enough food, as I actually couldn't even finish all my food. I still can't believe it was only $89 -- seemed super reasonable for the quality of food and caliber of service/ambiance.   Our server started out a little stuffy but eventually warmed up and turned out be very friendly in the end. Make sure you order a cocktail here. They have a great variety of fun and unique drinks. We tried several all of which the names escape me but we really enjoyed them all.   Standout dishes included the the foie gras creme brulee (of course!) -- it really was as delicious and decadent as everyone raves.  I also really enjoyed the Maine dayboat scallops and and the wagyu skirt steak -- upcharge on this one but worth it as it was very tender and flavorful. My friend also really enjoyed her 48hour beef belly.   The Pave dessert here also wowed me, and I'm not one to be wowed by dessert.  It has to be one fo the best I've ever had at a fine dining restuarant and the olive oil ice cream was UNBELIEVABLE. I loved every bite of it!   I'd come back here in a heartbeat and hope they don't become wise to the fact that they're one of the best deals in Vegas IMHO! ;-)",

The menu is set up as a tasting menu, where prices vary on the number of courses selected from each of 4 sections. This is could be nice, except the bill racks up quickly. According to my husband, \"don't go here if you're hungry.\" The portions are small for US standards, but I would say they are normal human portions. An amuse bouche is offered, which is nice. They have a very small vegan menu and a few more vegetarian options. They will also accommodate gluten-free diners.  Presentation is also highly prized and well-done- think food tweezers and pouring sauces out of little containers table-side b  The chestnut soup was a unique flavor- earthy, oniony, toasty. The poached egg was interesting- almost like an egg soup. The the venison was well-cooked and standard.   The outliers- hazelnut espresso mousse topped with a crumble and caramelized persimmon slices. It was fabulous, a textural wonderland, bursting with flavor, and a balance of sweet and salty- Just perfect. The other- the amazingly attentive and helpful busboy. Nevertheless, I would have expected a little more for the price.",

    "text": "Maybe this was a case of Yelp hyping up a place and such great expectations that led to a meh kind of night for me.   I had friends in town visiting and decided to do something special for one of their birthdays and made reservations at Sage after reading all of the amazing things about McClain's restaurant.   Upon arrival, we were greeted and brought into the restaurant which I have to say is gorgeous. The decor and tones of purple make it very sensual and elegant. Loved the ambiance going on!  Bread basket was okay. The breads were a little too hard and it hurt a little having to bite down so hard on them. I did enjoy the amuse bouche very much although I can't recall what it was. I had ordered the Wagyu Short Rib and shared the Beef Tartare app. Honestly, the Beef Tartare was the only reason I didn't give Sage a 1 star unfortunately. The tartare was paired very well with the capers, mustard and egg on top. It all worked very well!  I can't say the same about my short rib. It was very meh and I am very sad to have to report that. It was accompanied with white asparagus and roasted turnips. The short rib is braised 36 hour but it did not fall apart/feel like it was and was very tough to cut. It is always a shame to see the appetizer outshine the entree in my eyes, especially at a place like this. My friends each had the scallops and pork loin. FWIW, my friend enjoyed her scallops very much. And the pork loin was also meh in his opinion. :(  The icing on the cake was that I let the waitress know ahead of time that it was a friends birthday at the table and did not go out of her way to prepare anything special for him and simply brought us the check at the end of the night. I know it's not a written rule, but not even a cursory dessert for the price that I'm paying for the meal and kind of restaurant this is?! No thank you!  Overall, thoroughly disappointed but maybe I had too high of an expectation for Sage. Would I return to give it a second chance? After all of the glowing reviews, it's still a iffy maybe.",

The sweetbreads were amazingly tender and succulent, great texture with an amazing sauce throughout. Took most of my self control not to drink it. The foie gras might be one of the most unique things I've ever eaten; be warned your brain and palate might have the best nervous breakdown ever.

I recommend grilled peach salad with the scallop. We also had pea soup and short rip. I would say just have the salad and scallop. I don't mean that the soup and short rip are not good, but just the salad and the scallop are so good and much better than the other two. Even if you don't like scallop, this place is worth a try.   The other important thing is service. The service is top notch! If the scallop is top 3, the service is THE BEST! Our server was very knowledgeable and attentive. Everything he recommended was absolutely amazing. He explained everything so well like stories behind each dish, ingredient, etc. He made sure that we enjoy the food and like the restaurant. I can say, in addition to the food, he is the one that makes us want to go back to sage. I hope restaurant manager will see this review and appreciate our server's hard effort.

    "text": "So I came here about a year ago and did just the absinthe tasting and I came back to do it again and maybe... MAYBE get one or two food items. John, my server suggested the Oysters and the beef tartare but once I saw the tasting menu I decided I had to go with it.  1. Lightly Smoked Ora King Salmon with Haricot Vert, Kumquat, Golden Ostera Caviar. -- I love raw salmon and this dish was no exception. The crumbled baguette gives an amazing sandy texture. The caviar was just... salty. The green beans give an amazing crunch that I really enjoyed. The dish was very citrusy but not exactly kumquat. It was more sweet than tart, not sure how they managed that with the kumquat.  The flavor and textures were very reminiscent of sweet cream / creamy buttery flavor? I realized the dish had masago in it too. Super... amazing and very refreshing dish. I guessed that the crumbled baguette was actually some kind of lemon shortbread cookies and I was right! I think there were some nuts in it? made it taste like carne asada or something. Pairing with remy Martin is amazing. Amazing Amazing dish.  2. Seared Foie gras with Green Apple, Yuzu, Dashi.  Incredibly savory and fatty. Dashi foam. Very nice balance of fruity and fatty. Amazing apple flavor. Don't taste the yuzu. Was extremely savory and bacony flavor. Enjoyed this immensely. I believe it was the first time I've had an actual, hefty, chunk of foie by itself.   2.5 I asked the server to have the chef throw this in somewhere. Wagyu Beef Tartare with crushed caper aioli, slow poached egg, and crispy chocolate.  This was served with the most deliciously toasted bread. There was some pickled radish that tasted appley. The tartare was cold and had a silky texture. I'm guessing the caper aioli gave it a slight tart / vinegary flavor to the dish. I loved the crunchyness of the toasted bread. There was more than enough. Again, a very nice and refreshing dish. The radish is very tart and maybe was marinated in apple cider vinegar. The egg yolk was basically dried / cooked to a hardened but not hard boiled texture. It wasn't runny and I wonder if it was over cooked. I think that the chocolate chip should have been served separately. Everything over powered it but it tasted so good dark and strong roasted flavors but quickly disappeared I wish there was more of this. It was probably the most unique part of the dish but it's a shame it didn't really pair well. Ultimately, I don't think I'm a fan of beef tartare though this was done well.   3. \"Maine Day-Boat Scallops with 'chowder' sauce / bacon / coffee and green chartreuse. The scallops were seared on the outside and soft in the center. The dish was extremely rich and baconey. It also had baby leeks. It tasted like sweet cream and was really buttery. Almost like clam chowder re-imagined. The scalops were a bit sandy but eh. Very unique dish but... it basically tasted like clam chowder. I didn't get the coffee flavor. Not sure if I tasted the Chartreuse either.   4. Japanese F1 Wagyu. with Ancho Romesco, asian pear, lacinato kayle, and pumpkin seeds. Legit or marketing gimmick? Not sure. Supposedly you get F1 when you cross breed wagyu and angus cows. The flavor was very bacony. Not my favorite though it had a very nice, juicy, and tender texture. Soft steamed pears are honestly so nice. Got a slight tartness somehow and the savoryness of pine nuts. Kale chips. There were pearls of potatoes as well so I enjoyed playing a game called potatoes or pears with myself. I later learned that the pine nut flavor came from the Ancho Romesco which is a pureee of hazelnuts, pine nuts, and bell peppers. The kale eventually softened and took on a texture akin to collard greens.  I could honestly barely finish this. The tasting menu probably would have sufficed and I could have done without the tartare.   5. Chocolate pot de creme with white chocolate cream, Guinness chocolate cake, and oreo crumbles. Dish was ok. It just tasted like a chocolate pudding with thick, dense chocolate cake. I din't enjoy it too much.  6. Grand Finalle, Got a comped Absinthe experience from MGM's rewards. Chose the Butterfly this time. I went with the traditional experience this time and they lit a sugar cube on fire and let ice water slowly drip down into the glass. I'm not sure if the pour was too light or if they added too much water but it ended up tasting a bit faint. There was a distinct aspartame flavor that I did not enjoy. Possibly, absinthe just isn't my thing.  Honestly if you're thinking about doing the tasting menu, I'd say go for it. For $130 I think it's a steal. I greatly enjoyed the salmon tartare and the foie gras. The service was excellent but typical for fancy dining. My server John and the busser Jacob were both extremely helpful in repeating every single ingredient and description of what I was eating. Only complaint is that the meal was extremely heavy and much of it tasted like bacon.",

Keep an eye out for the two absinthe stations. They are quite elaborate if your are adventurous. I thought it would be too loud but it was just enough.  I normally don't like fancy food but this place even pleased me. The prices are high but not extreme. The food was plentiful too. I didn't feel like I paying a fortune for almost no food.  Tip: they will split the salads in half to keep the price down so you can share them between two people. They will offer you bread but make sure to try them all. Don't settle for just one!",

We were a party of 4 and ordered filets and short ribs amongst us. I also had the gem salad which includes romaine and smoked trout. Everything was outstanding. The menu was short but that tells me everything is fresh.  The presentation was unbelievable. They really take pride in astetics.

The bar lights up beautifully as you enter the dining area toward your seats and the music completes the whole young, but discerning vibe. I had the Little Gem salad that thankfully was both hefty and delicious. The  Vancouver Island Kushi Oysters were equally tasty as was the tuna tartar. One drawback I'd like to note is that the kitchen was out Of prime rib. It's nice to tell guests ahead of time of any dishes that might be out of before they order. Seeing as it was late on a Friday night, however, one can understand. Last but certainly not least was a foie gras candy bar dessert that words just cannot do it justice. I'll definitely be back here with friends from out of town. The service and food are worth writing home about!",

I'm particularly fond of restaurants that focus on farm to table, Sage was high end dining at its finest with a relaxed atmosphere and a menu focused on fresh seasonal ingredients.  I was set on getting the 5 course tasting menu which started with a king salmon appetizer with caviar that was just bursting with flavor, it was absolutely amazing, every bite was an explosion of flavor and textures that left a giant smile on my face! 2nd course was the foie gras dish... This might've been the best foie gras dish I've ever had...Wow wow wow! HEAVEN! 3rd course was the scallops, another home run! All 3  courses I paired with the Westmalle triple ale, all worked wonderfully in their own ways, 4th course was the Japanese Waygu steak which I paired with the dark roasty bready doppelbock the celebrator, from Ayinger brewery, another excellent match! Final course was a yummy chocolate pot de Creme with Guinness cake, a great finish to a memorable meal.  The service was friendly and frequent, all expectations were matched and then some. I have to also compliment this place on their excellent beer selection, I'm a huge beer nerd and the opportunity to drink very respected and rare beers in Vegas was a very very nice surprise!",

They are all very polite and polished as well. Our waiter was professional, personable and attentive. He came back just enough to be courteous but not annoying, I think that balance is an art. He had stories and explanations for all the dishes we asked, and it was quite a lot. It seems this isn't a place that gives the food to the staff for free or a great discount, as he hadn't tried many of the dishes but still knew them like the back of his hand. To me this means that the food is very quality, rare and not just food they charge us a lot for and eat for free in the back.   Food:  Roasted Veal Sweetbreads - this was a very interesting dish, and I'd never had it. I discovered that sweetbreads is a culinary name for the thymus or pancreas. The flavor was interesting and the textures were nice. It was a unique offering and I'm glad we did enjoy it.  Delicata Squash Salad -  nice flavors, light and tasty. The pear was exceptional, and the pairings were perfect. The dressing was light enough to make it easy to eat without an overpowering flavor.  Iberico \"SECRETO\" Pork absolutely my favorite dish. It's a portion of the pig in the shoulder so it was a good texture. The meat was seared to give it a crispness that I thoroughly enjoyed. Sauce and flavors were just so incredibly good. Order this dish!  Wagyu Flat Iron Steak - Probably around 6-8 ounces, and more than my partner could eat because of the apps. Great flavor and cooked to perfection. You know you're in a good spot when they don't ask you how you want it cooked because they know how to cook this dish to perfection.   When I return I'll bring a bigger appetite and try the tasting menu, my mouth was watering just thinking about it.   Ambiance was a purple glow and it was quiet and intimate, which I appreciated. There was a large group off to the side so they weren't disrupting everyone else which seemed to be on dates.",

So if you are like us and like to taste a bunch of items, I would suggest ordering a salad and an appetizer each, and ordering one main for every two people. Then you may still have room for dessert.   The food was excellent! The foie gras was given the compliment of \"this is the best foie gras I've ever eaten\" from my husband who eats foie gras every chance he gets. And the poached egg - I seriously never knew an egg could taste so good! The Iberico Pork and the Wagyu were also incredible. The halibut was good, but not as good as the other mains.

    "text": "I will admit to you that the only reason we \"ended up\" here at Sage, was because of a MyVegas reward.  We were staying next door at Vdara, celebrating our 10th anniversary (and we love absinthe) so the absinthe experience here seemed like a logical reward to choose.  We originally intended to just pop in for that, and dessert, but upon closer inspection of reviews and menus, decided to just make a reservation for our whole anniversary dinner.  This was the best decision we could have possibly made.  From the moment we were greeted and escorted in by the hostess, we were treated like absolute royalty.  We were there on a Monday evening just after opening, so there weren't many other tables yet.  I think this created a quiet, intimate and romantic experience that you wouldn't necessarily get on a Friday night.  It felt very exclusive this way, each new staff member becoming a new friend, calling us Mr and Mrs _, etc.  Just beautiful.  The purple and lime and candlelight originally worried me when I saw photos here on yelp, if I'm continuing to be honest.  I wanted some really exquisite anniversary ambience and I wasn't sure this was it.  But I tell you what - it is has a cooling effect coming off the strip, if that makes sense.  It's like a glowing cave - a modern and fun, but still romantic and elegant hue.  I actually loved the whole vibe.  The sommelier listened intuitively to our preferences, then described and poured us the most perfect wines and champagne.  The list is epic.  Do explore it.  The server, the bread/water guy, the manager... all steered us in the right directions for our meal.  We had the Himachi Salad, the Little Gem Salad (a delicious and unique twist on caesar flavors), the Wagyu tartare (O.M.G. I don't even have to tell you it was like buttah), and the Scallops, which scared me at first because a) putting salted caramel sauce on them sounds completely counterintuitive and gross really and b) I never enjoy scallops.  I have never had them not taste like rubber.  WELL.  GUESS what is now one of my favorite dinners, ever in history?  Those scallops with their delicious counterintuitive gravy-sauce!  Woo! They ruined me.  I will probably just go back to never eating a scallop again because no one will do it like Sage.  We finished with the pot d'creme.  Luscious.    I must say, I really appreciate that they simply let us be lovebirds and share all of our plates between us instead of making us feel like we needed separate plates to be proper, or that we were somehow cheap for not getting individual entrees, etc.  Some establishments (esp in Vegas!) would charge you for such requests.  But the Absinthe Experience!  The cart and presentation, the magical fountain, it all sets the tone.  At least one of you HAS to get it served fire and ice style, because pouring a glass full of fire by your table is so Vegas.  And you get to inhale the buzzy fumes.  We did two varieties, served two different ways, and it was so interesting to compare and share them.  Absinthe is just fun period, but Sage has somehow made it entertaining to serve as well.  It was truly a one of a kind celebration.  We cannot wait to return one day.  Thank you to the entire staff, and especially the manager, for making this an unforgettable night for us both.",

Not sure I would go again with all the options in Vegas.",

There's a front area to the restaurant with a large bar and then a large back room with tables.   The menu would probably be classified as upscale American. My group split a burrata/greens salad and steak tartare to start. For my entree, I got the duck and it was cooked perfectly. Huge wine list which had some really impressive bottles. Enjoyed both apps and my entree a lot. No complaints, but definitely a little pricey!",

When I walked in, I was seriously captivated by how sexy the room looks from floor to ceiling. The staff was very courteous when checking us in and greeting us through the dining room.   Aaron took wonderful care of us at the bar, and made sure my friend's birthday experience was nothing short of perfection. Between three of us we ordered two tasting menus, the foie gras, and the scallops which came highly recommended. If you come to Vegas, you have to stop here just for the foie alone.   I'm usually not a wine pairing kind of girl because I prefer cocktails, but this pairing for the tasting menu was spot on and Christine & her team of Sommes definitely know what they're doing!    Dessert from the tasting menu was a chocolate pot de creme of sorts and I wish I could have taken it to go/finished it if I wasn't so full.   I cannot wait to bring my family here for future celebrations and nights out!!",

Since my friend was friends with one of the chefs at Sage inside the Aria we decided to come and enjoy the delicacies. The appetizers were a world in itself. We ordered about every single one and almost didn't have room for our entrees! The marine day scallops was amazing with the right amount of dairy and pieces of bacon that complemented the perfect succulent scallops. The ravioli was truly amazing and filling as well that had nice aged cheese and ground beef that went hand in hand. The foie gras toasted and fried roll was amazing with the right amount of sweetness and softness of the bread. First time I had medium rare pork that actually tasted like steak and was very juicy and went very well with the kale! I recommend this place and hope this business last many more years to come!",

Service can easily get subpar due to the never-ending crowd and wherever you go, the decors always seem a little cliched and repetitive.  But let me tell you: Sage is one of those \"must-go 4-star\"s indeed.   We went with the chef's tasting menu, which brought us plenty of 5-star dishes including the foie gras brulee, the chilled maine lobster with pumpkin flan and the herb-crusted lamb saddle. The chef is not afraid of creating bold flavors and everything was spot on delicious!   My boyfriend would definitely recommend the big 6-course tasting menu. But if you are scared of overindulgence like I do, go A la carte and make sure you get those 3 dishes I mentioned.   Living in California is awesome, but living without foie gras sucks. So I went to Vegas hoping that I could have a little treat, but I did not expect to have the BEST mousse-like preparation of foie gras I've ever experienced. Give it a try and let me know if you agree :)",

I've been here twice so far while in Vegas and it's always been a pleasant experience.  In fact, one Vegas weekend I had dinner here one night and the next night at Joel Robuchon (which was around 10x the cost) and I actually preferred Sage's food over Robuchons.  Call me crazy, I know.  My favorite dishes here are the market oysters and the scallops.  Probably one of the most flavorful scallop dishes I've had.  Also, they tout their foie gras creme brulee as one of their signature dishes, but I must warn you, it is a very polarizing dish.  Some people will love it because they've never tried anything like it before but others will hate it.  I didn't care for it much even though I love foie gras, so I didn't find it surprising when it was off their prix fixe menu the second time around.  Their wine/beer pairings are also a great deal for around $44.  The only problem I had with beer pairing was that they were pouring near full pints each glass.  I got so drunk after the fifth course, I couldn't remember half the night afterwards.  But then again, I guess that isn't such a bad thing in Vegas.",

It happened to the other tables too.  amuse bouche (Duck tartare with cream cheese and pickled grape) 3.5/5 - better than my expectation.  First time to try duck tartare but I liked it.  The picked grape was good too.  GRILLED SUMMER PLUMS 4.5/5 - The plums/peach/apricots were sweet.  Crunchy bacon (more like bacon or pork fat than pork belly to me).  Totally mixed well with the pecans  MAINE DIVER SEA SCALLOPS 4.5/5 - 3 giant scallops.  They were gigantic and well (under)cooked.  Seared with rare inside.   BRAISED BEEF SHANK 3/5 - too small when we compare to the Scallops.  4oz at most?!  COCONUT AND KEY LIME FLOAT 3/5 - They pour the foamed soda in front of you.  The lime soda was too sour.  I didn't find that they were matched.  FUNNEL CAKE 4/5 - reminded me of the Chinese egg/bubble waffle.  Not too sweet.  Came with vanilla ice-cream.  Hot chocolate soup with cayenne pepper 4/5 - complementary!  It was too sweet for me but the others really enjoyed it.  There was a kick when you get to the bottom.  Dining on the Strip has at least 50% markup.  We were only because of the $50 special.  We would have picked the $89 tasting menu without the Restaurant Week (more likely we wouldn't have come).  It was okay but not good enough for me to come back any time soon.",

The ambience is great, and the price of the tasting menu was very reasonable. The food was pretty good, and I'm glad I tried it, but I think there are better places in Vegas. The foie creme brulee was disappointing for me. I love foie, and I love creme brulee, but I didn't think the foie came through enough for me. I would have rather just ordered seared foie instead (I think that should be an option in addition to the brulee). The meat dishes were well prepared but again nothing I really even remember one month later now that I'm posting this review. And our server wasn't very friendly for 75% of our dining experience. During the last 25% he got friendlier, as we got closer to tip time, but he seemed a little condescending before that.   In summary, food quality would yield 3.75 stars, service would yield 2 stars, and price would yield 4 stars, for an average of 3.25 stars. Who knew I would be doing some math for a yelp review?!?",

Both were just \"ok\" but didn't stand out as much as the previous dishes  Chocolate something - don't remember but it was good with olive oil something....  Service was also great and very attentive. Would recommend it!",

We only ordered sparkling water which Pablo, the best busser ever, never let me refill my glass on my own. For a starter, we ordered the beef tartare with quail egg, mustard seeds and freshly baked crostinis. I have been craving beef tartare and can never find it anywhere in Orange County that does it well- this one hit the spot nicely. We were given share plates by a beautiful Czech man wearing a well fitted suit named Robert (the general manager). I was very impressed by how hands-on he was and we both really enjoyed conversing with him. My girlfriend ordered the 35 hour wagyu short rib and I ordered the braised veal with polenta and carmelized cioppolini onion. Every component of both of our dishes merry so well together. Kudos to Chef Shawn McClain! For dessert, we took Jason's recommendation and ordered the foie gras candy bar. We even got a complimentary hot chocolate soup which was to die for when you pair it with the foie gras candy bar.   I've been seeing a lot of reviews and complaints about the prices. I thought the prices were very fair and to be expected with a beautiful restaurant like Sage, the level of service and the value of the food. You're in Vegas. Pay up!  Thank you, Robert and Jason for the fine hospitality! I look forward to my next visit!",

Hey Management -- you are wrong! If I want LOUD conversation-killing noise levels, I will go to a nightclub or a sports bar. If I want to spend $150 per person on a nice dinner & wine, & enjoy an evening of relaxed indulgence & dinner, I want a place that meets the price point.",

As soon as you walk in, you are taken back by the swanky lounge/restaurant romantic feel and the place looked regal with it's colors! First of all, do not look at the prices for this is not an cheap place...but worth every penny! The Price Fix is a great option, but if you don't like the options, just dive into the menu and order what sounds great...we did!  Apps: WAGYU BEEF TARTARE and the SASHIMI OF YELLOWTAIL I could have eaten a bowl of the Tartare as it was warm. The Yellowtail was light and refreshing and never thought of apricots and Yellowtail going together but it made a great combo!  Dinner: I had the GRILLED AMERICAN KOBE SKIRT STEAK and my wife got the BRAISED VEAL CHEEKS. The combination of smoked avacodo with the pureed potatoes and salsa were to die for! The steak was cooked just right. I had a coupe of bites of the Veal and the it was quite comforting...delicious. Both our plates were clean.  They keep bringing out bread with butter and sea-salt...so that combined with apps and dinner forced us to skip dessert and go for the....Absinthe Cart!!  I've never had it before and my wife did in Europe (but she doesn't remember much of that!!) and since it would make a great aperitif we went with server's choice. She put on a great show and the drinks were out of this world. Excellent way to relax after dinner.  The thing that I love about Sage is that though the prices were high (as expected) and the place was quite exquisite, the folks who work there are very friendly, down to earth, and make you feel very comfortable. I've gone to many high-end restaurants before and you have to \"behave\" very refined.   Writing this review just made me hungry....",

This time around, my friend and I decided that we would try Sage based primarily on the contents of the four-course tasting menu ($89 plus $44 for generously poured wine pairings). We were not disappointed by any stretch.  The beef tartare is a revelation--I didn't know that tartare could remind me so much of tuna, but it was melt-in-your-mouth stunning. The scallop and oxtail was delicious, and the beef belly was terrific (and I don't even typically like belly cuts of pork or beef). And the desserts are in a league of their own--it's hard to even describe the complexity of what we were served. Suffice it to say, they were phenomenal.  I'm extremely pleased with our decision to come to Sage and I do hope that I can return.",

    "text": "Overall Value: 4.25/5 Sage delivers in all areas and although I rated them highly across the board below, at their price point, This is EXPECTED. I didn't feel like I got anything above and beyond what I paid for. At this price point there is little room for error and they did enough to ensure I felt like I got value for my $$ but not above it.  Price: $85-$125/per person w/a cocktail but w/o wine. With wine  the sky is the limit. Dress: Business. Many woman wore coktail dresses and men wore suits or a button down with a blazer. Dark Denim is as casual as them men want to get. Time Needed: 2hrs to 3hrs  Service: 5/5 Our waiter, Andrew was knowledgeable about the menu and we chose Sage as it had a lot of Gluten free options for one of our guests. We had a special surprise for one of our friends and he was more then happy to help in delivering the surprise. Further their in house wine expert was very helpful in helping us pick out a great bottle within our price point. It did not disappoint, I now love the Stanton Cab Sav.  Food & Wine/Cocktails: 4.5/5 Sage as it says marries American cuisine with global influences. We forego the chefs'tasting menu as our group didn't have that big of an appetite. We shared the Roasted Veal Sweetbreads to start and they were fabulous. I then moved onto the Grimaud Farms Duck which was cooked perfectly. It was moist, not too fatty (duck can be) and paired perfectly with the Beluga Lentils! I do reccomend! I had to pass on dessert was I was stuffed from Wine & the Duck. Sorry!  They have a very robust wine list for the Wine-O's out there. You won't be disappointed and prices range from $80-$6000. The list sorts by region and also by type.For the coktail types, there is also much to choose from their handcrafted coktail list.  Ambience/Decor: 4.5/5 This is a very modern restaurant with very tall ceilings and has that \"grand\" factor, consistent with Aria Hotel. From the entrance which walks you right through their wine collection and into the grand main \"ballroom\" is how I would describe it. You feel like you're about to get a real experience in both food, wine and service and to be honest you do, but you pay for it. It's dimly lit and all the waiters are outfitted in vests, white dress shirts & a bow tie. I would feel underdressed if I wore denim. On this evening, I opted for Grey chinos, a button down & a navy vest paired with some brown toe cap shoes. IMO, perfect for this restaurant. The ladies were in beautiful cocktail dresses.",

Once there, we decided to splurge on the Holiday Tasting Menu. The option for a wine pairing was also available, but husband was hoping for a beer pairing instead. Sage came through and did a custom beer pairing just for him (I got the wine pairing).  The meal was incredible! Technically it was 7 courses, but actually 10 or 11 if you count the extras.  - Bread: Small French Roll, Bacon Roll, Australian Sea Salt, Herb Butter  - Amuse Bouche: Kumamoto Oyster on the half shell with cucumber and jalapeno.   - First Course: Maine Lobster with Meyer Lemon Panna Cotta & Caviar Vinaigrette  - Second Course: Foie Gras with Poached Pear and Gooseberries  - Third Course: Truffled Chestnut Soup with Pork Belly, Black Trumpet Mushrooms, and Huckleberry  - Fourth Course: Grilled Ribeye Cap with Spiced Pumpkin, Bone Marrow, and Apple  - Palate Cleanser: Sweet Grapefruit Syrup with Vanilla Sorbet  - Sixth Course: Six Layer Cake with Dark Chocolate Cake & White Chocolate Mousse, Bacon Rice Crispies, Stout Brittle Gel, Malt Foam  - Seventh Course: Peanut Butter Mousse, Grape Gelee, Fresh Grapes, Brioche Crisps  - Sweet Ending: Demitasse of Lightly Sweetened Warm Milk flavored with Rosemary and Peppermint  All the food was truly memorable (and we have high standard), and the wine and beer pairings were spot on. Service was friendly and attentive. Well done, Sage!",

    "text": "Decor & atmosphere: Sage is a beautiful restaurant. Of course, it is huge with high ceilings and extravagant decor--Vegas style. There were large tables in the middle of the room for bigger parties and smaller tables along the sides of the room that could seat groups of 2-5. Our reservations were at 5PM, so the restaurant wasn't busy at all. However, the room was so large with so much space between tables that I imagine the dining experience at their peak hours would seem just as intimate.  Service:  The service was great. Our waiter was very nice and remembered to ask us if we had any time limits due to seeing a show after our dinner. We told him we had tickets for Zardana at 7PM and he made sure our food came out quick enough for us to feel relaxed but gave us enough time to get to our show.  Food: To be honest, I don't really know what to say about the food. None of the dishes were \"bad\", and most of them were really delicious. However, almost all of them were way too rich.  One of my friends ordered veal cheeks, and they were probably the best dish I tried at Sage. However, combined with the richness of all the other dishes we ordered afterwards, it was just too much to have in one sitting. I understand that this is the kind of luxury restaurant where the portions are small, but the dish supposed to be filling because of its richness. I honestly started feeling a bit sick towards the end of the meal and was about to pass up dessert--and I love my dessert!  With such great reviews for this restaurant, I had high expectations. I was probably most disappointed with the yellowtail sashimi I ordered. This dish was not rich (thank god), but was not what I was expecting. There were literally three thin slices of yellowtail on the plate on top of a jumble of cauliflower, mandarin oranges, and a strange jelly ribbon.. I mean to be fair I guess I shouldn't have expected Japanese style sashimi but meh, I did.  Overall, we did not have a bad experience here, and to be fair the service was great. However, with such high expectations for this restaurant we were definitely disappointed. The next time we're in Vegas, I don't think we will be coming back.",

    "text": "I spent quite a bit of time researching Vegas restaurants for a special birthday celebration.  I wanted something posh that wouldn't completely break the bank.  Luckily, I decided on Sage, which was conveniently located in the lobby of our hotel.  I was soooooooooooo happy with my choice!  We sat at a quiet table for 2 with a great view of the dining room.  The decor is an interesting mix of contemporary (clean lines and dark woods), traditional (pleated shades on the chandeliers and Renoir's \"The Luncheon of the Boating Party\" on the wall) and 70's glam (gold accents and gold speckled mirrors).  Bonus points because purple is my favorite color.  The ambiance is lively but not loud.  Some kind of chill electronic music was playing in the background, which made for a very comfortable and relaxed vibe.  We noshed on fresh bread (sourdough and some sort of bacon roll) while we enjoyed our cocktails.  I had the delightful tea rose, which is a hoity-toity version of a lemon drop martini.  We were all set to try the tasting menu but we got sucked in to the night's special - a rib eye for two.  I am so bummed that I didn't get to try the foie gras custard brulee but I am hoping there will be a next time.  Our meal began with an amuse bouche of pate topped with fresh greens.  Mine had a slight kick to it.  I had the wild mixed greens salad, which was incredibly fresh and flavorful.  The Hubs raved about his heirloom beet salad.  Our rib eye, with foie gras glaze, mushrooms and leeks, came in a big dish for us to share, which made it fun and a little romantic.  It was tender, juicy and delicious!  I am usually not a fan of glazed meats but this glaze was so light and not at all sweet.  We also had yummy golden mashed potatoes on the side.  For dessert we shared a decadent chocolate and raspberry creameaux and finished everything off with the chocolate soup.  The night's flavor was the amazing chocolate caramel which our waiter likened to liquid gold.  Indeed!  We had wonderful dining experience at Sage and I would be completely remiss if I didn't mention the incredible service.  From the time we were greeted at the door until we walked out again, we were treated to prompt, courteous, attentive, and professional service from everyone we encountered.  If you want a really nice dinner at an upscale restaurant that is not stuffy or pretentious, go to Sage.  Go, just go!",

The ambiance and decor was nice but I seriously didn't understand the big deal about the food. Due to time constraint the 3 of us only took the smaller set menu. I really wanted to try their foie gras creme brulee because the description of the dish seemed amazing but it was actually very disappointing. I don't think that Sage is really worth spending time and money at, there are so many amazing restaurants in Vegas that i'd rather go to!",

It was not too busy but we were seated in very close proximity to two other couples, right in the middle, providing us very little privacy. In fact, next table to us butted in a few times in our conversation. Ironic given the restaurant was empty.   Now to our food, we ordered the grilled octopus appetizer, and for our main entree we ordered the scallops and the halibut. All these dishes were highly recommended.  Grilled octopus came out on a salad with sauce that drenched it. It was done right but the flavor was lost with the salt overkill.   Our main courses unfortunately was very similar, salt overkill. Do not eat here if you have high blood pressure or are sensitive to swelling.   The service was great, and We were very well attended to.",

(I'm very familiar with the industry and culinary arts, both have been a passion)  Went for my birthday-- terribly terribly over priced for the experience- Atmosphere = stuffy and non existent.  Food taste = trying too hard to be rich and fancy, each bite probably contained 5 spoons of butter.  My date and I spent over  $400 on tequila shots and wine but barely touched our food, whole entrees went to garbage (or hopefully some enthused servers belly).   I feel like the server and som were all over us because we ordered a lot and we were very funny. If that had not been the case, I get the impression that they would seldom come around.   I eat out a lot... 4-5 times a week, and have no problem blowing serious cash on a great restaurant experience. I really don't think I will be back here, sorry guys.",

    "text": "We can here to drop cash and enjoy a super fancy dinner and by the reviews we were super excited. Unfortunately we were highly disappointed...and left tons of money ($150/person with only 2 drinks). The reason for our disappointment (and the opinion was unanimous between 6 people who all ordered different things) is the food lacked any sort of wow factor or creativity. Here's what we had: Appetizers: - Beef tartare: this was delicious - Veal Sweetbreads: first time I've had these and they were cooked pretty well. - Beet salad: pretty good but nothing extraordinary - Sashimi: pretty good - Octopus: this specifically was my dish and left much to be desired.   Entrees: - Ribeye for two: the meat was cooked well but once again, this was nothing special for a place that is considered one of the top in Vegas. - Veal Cheeks: these were delicious - Scallop: too salty and nothing special about the technique or flavors. Needs to be elevated in some way. - Gnocchi w/ veal: this again was my dish and I was really looking forward to it. It was pretty good but the gnocchi were a really weird, mashed-potato, texture (this was the immediate reaction of anyone tasting them).  So while the food is prepared well there is nothing special, elevated, or unique about this place. Too much salt and not enough creativity. Meh.   The service is really good though.",

I love Vegas because, in a 1 mile stretch of boulevard, you get some of the best restaurants in the world.  Sage is far and away one of my top 10- Maybe even a top 5.  The service was amazing, first of all. I was seated immediately, and immediately got water and my drink order taken.  Just a few minutes later, my server greeted me with a menu and some explanations of how things work around there.  The server was attentive without hovering, had suggestions but was not upset when I ordered something else, was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and wine list, and was just generally a nice guy.  Not the \"stick up their ass\" that you may expect to find at similarly priced establishments.  My meal consisted of the artichoke confit salad, which was lovely. Light, flavorful, and had a lovely combination of textures. It was really a delightful start to the menu.  My main course was the shelton farms organic chicken, roasted, with buckwheat spatzel and a sweet potato puree.  This was a real treat. The skin was lightly crispy, the buckwheat spatzel was the perfect texture with a nice brown butter accompaniment, and the sweet potato puree with nuts was a really nice contrast of textures.  My dessert was the Milk chocolate cremeaux. This was sweet, but not overly so, and not too rich. Very playful taste and textures, with pomegranate seeds that provided a nice tart burst, which also helped to lighten the texture of the dessert.   I rarely give 5 stars, but Sage deserves it.  It was a great dining experience.",

Again excellent with amazing mix of flavors in sauce ana accompaniments 4th veniso: little over salted but seared perfectly to melt in the mouth.  Unless you have a big appetite, i would suggest 3 or even 2 course options as portions are large and food is relatively rich. Could not finish the last course.  My wife had the octapus for appetizer and scallops. Both had awsome flavor profiles and were again very large portions.   For wine we tried four by the glass offerings. All fairly pricey though the reds were definitely well worth the expenditure($18/glass!) Rodney chardoney  Sauv blank selection forgot name Holdredge pinkt noir (incredible nose and smooth finish, excellent with seafood entrees) Coto imaz riojo reserva great nose and sophisticated finish good with the venison  The yelp ad saying 89 dollar tasting menu is incorrect.

I didn't like what was being served on the 4 course meal (120 per person)  The place is super nice and the ambiance is great.  Servers/hostesses were all great but for what I paid for, I feel like I got totally jipped.    The portions are ridiculously tiny and NOT worth what you pay for.    King salmon sashimi - 18 ish dollars.  4 measily tiny pieces.  Seriously... FOUR  Foi Gras Brulee - 25 dollars - This was THE thing that was the saving grace to this restaurant.  I wanted to bathe in it it was so tasty.  Me: Pork dish - crispy pork paired with another pork loin wrapped in bacon served with some kind of greens and carrots.  Sounds amazing right?  EHH WRONG.   Crispy pork was good but not knock my socks off and take me to bed good.  It was just meh.  The pork loin wrapped in bacon was tough.  COME ON  I pay 40+ bucks for this meal and it's tough?  I can't even cut it with the knife you give me?  Give me a break  friend: veal cheeks.  Those were tender served with some pickled veggies of some sort and a very creamy mashed potato type of thing.  That dish was pretty good but we weren't blown away by it.  Not to mention, the portion was super small.  I think that if we hadn't had buffet for lunch, we would have walked out of this still hungry and ticked off.    Last but not least... if I'm going to spend that kind of money on a place, I should expect to not feel rushed.  We were in and out of there in about 45 minutes.  Almost felt like they had the dishes waiting and mildly heated them up before everything came out.  Blah... Totally underwhelmed.   Never going here again.",

    "text": "Visited Sage on our honeymoon. It was a great treat. We had the chefs special menu, which was very impressive. Our server was very attentive, friendly and polite. We got to enjoy some absinthe after our meal too. I have to say though the legal version of absinthe has such a low level of wormwood that it is just a stiff alcoholic beverage (basically, I didn't see any green fairies)  So, why 3 stars? The portions were very small and the prices a little too high. On this trip we visited some of the best restaurants Vegas had to offer and I have to say for $420 (after tax and tip) I don't feel like it exceeded some of it's rival restaurants which ended up costing almost half this amount.  I will say this, we noticed that most people who were dining in there seemed like they were there on business. We noticed a lot more couples sitting at the bar area in the front. I guess the food and drinks would go down easier if you were putting on the company's tab :)  We caught a show after dinner, when we left the show we were hungry again, so had to stop to grab a bite somewhere :(  Overall, I might go back, but not for dinner. Maybe for drinks and appetizers.",

    "text": "------------- The Quick: -------------  Good, but not great, contemporary American fare that is served in a setting and demeanor too casual to be called fine-dining.   ------------- The Details: -------------  During my latest outing to Las Vegas, I was searching for a new fine-dining restaurant to try. To my disappointment, I was not encouraged by any of the new offerings and decided that I would go with a repeat visit to the current fine-dine Vegas champ restaurant Alex (see my review for more details). Unfortunately, I was greatly saddened by the fact that Alex had recently closed! I could not find a clear answer to why it had closed as it attracted a fair amount of diners and was not lacking in the recognition department (2-star Michelin). Nonetheless, I was left in the situation where I had to \"settle\" for one of the new fine-dine establishments I have yet to try over the last year or two.   ...which leads me to Sage. As alluded to in Vegas dining magazines and articles I had read on the web, it appears hotel owners (like Wynn/Encore) believe that most Vegas visitors do not hover toward traditional, intimate, True fine-dining environments. They believed they could attract the most customers via establishments that had good food, but a more relaxed, hip, and glamorous (showy) experience. My opinion on this school of though set aside, it basically left me no choice but to pick a restaurant that was not as fine-dine as I originally wanted. With the exception of Guy Savoy and Joel Robuchon, there are really no more True fine-dine establishments in Las Vegas (at least that i know of).   Anyways, here are the concrete details of my dining experience at Sage:  1) Food - I didn't care for the offered tasting menu and to my surprise, not everyone at the table had to have the tasting menu. Consequently my gf got the tasting menu as I elected to pick off the a la carte menu.  a) Appetizer #1: Pacific Yellow Tail Crudo w/ shaved trumpet mushrooms, black winter truffle, and toasted pine nuts -I'm always a fan of raw fish and especially yellow tail so this dish was a no-brainer for me. The tangy citrus marinade worked well with the inherent flavor of the fish. However, I was not a fan of the shaved (raw) mushroom and felt it did not blend with the other ingredients of the dish.   b) Appetizer #2: Chilled Dungeness Crab Salad with fennel, tangerine, and creme fraiche -Again, another favorite classic ingredient of mine: crab. Good flavors, probably my favorite dish of the night. Very delicate, mild tastes in the salad. Not overpowering but just the right amount of flavor to not mask the sweetness of the crab meat.   c) Entree: Bluenose Grouper with chanterelles, leeks, parsley root -Why did I get this dish? Why didn't I go for the kobe? Yeah, I have no idea actually. In hindsight, I should have gone for the bold flavors of the meat dishes and skipped the fish. The grouper was okay, but did not stand out at all. It had some decent flavor and was of course cooked perfectly. It was strictly ordinary and ordinary was not something one looks for in such a high-end establishment.   2) Service - subpar in the context of True fine-dining establishments. Our waiter did not do anything especially wrong or was especially rude, but like a lot of the other components of this restaurant, he was merely okay. I could not differentiate whether the waiter simply had a natural, apathetic demeanor or he did want to serve us. In either case, however, his bored, casual affect immediately disappointed my dining experience.   Overall, Sage was a forgettable restaurant in a slew of similar, high-end, but ordinary Las Vegas restaurants. Sure, it was pretty good food overall, but you honestly find good food like that in almost any other 4/5 star hotel in Vegas. There was nothing that made it stand out from the competition nor did it possess a theme, trait, dish, or element of service that compels me to return.",

Menu constantly changes with what is in season (as it should, who the heck wants Strawberries in October? ew.) either in preparation or all together. There are some signatures of course. Two of them are the steak tartare with fried chocolate and foie gras brulee with the most heavenly brioche buns. Must try those two if you come here. Also get the farm poached egg with truffle, so simple and delicious. I want that for breakfast every day!  Cocktail list is also great!  Every time I'm here I always try the current Duck dish on the menu, always cooked perfectly!   Desserts are also on point so be sure to try them.",

    "text": "Sage at the Aria is (so far) my favorite restaurant in Vegas. My dining partner (A.P.)and I decided to order the four-course Signature Menu. Each course came with two or three choices. A.P. and I strategically ordered different items for each course, so we ended up sampling a total of eight dishes.  For the 1st course, A.P. ordered the Vancouver Island Kushi Oysters - fresh and succulent, with a hint of the sea. I opted for the Wagyu Beef Tartare, which came topped with a slow-poached quail egg and a few crispy chocolate ribbons - clean-tasting and nicely chilled. A great way to start off the meal.  The 2nd course was even better. A.P. chose the Maine Dayboat Scallops, which were served atop a bed of braised oxtail and wild mushrooms - the plump and sweet scallops contrasted beautifully with the rustic oxtail and mushrooms. I ordered the Grilled Spanish Octopus, with charred leaks and shishito peppers - the tentacles were so tender that I could cut the pieces with my fork.  The 3rd course was not really an entree course, as the portions were small. A.P. and I shared the Iberico Pork Loin, a few half-dollar sized slices accompanied with roasted pork bread pudding, heirloom tomato jam, and braised chard, as well as the 48-Hour Beef Belly on sweet corn puree. Outstanding! The pork loin, in particular, was prepared to perfection.  For our 4th course -- the desserts - we shared the Gianduja Pave, an amazingly smooth and pleasing olive oil ice cream and hazelnut crunch, and the Marcona Almond Tart, with blueberries, whipped Mt. Tam cheese, and a soul-soothing lavender gelato. What a wonderful and unique way to end a fabulous meal.  The wine pairings were exquisite (kudos to the sommelier). The only negative was the relatively slow service on that especially and perhaps unexpectedly busy Tuesday night. Nevertheless, in my book Aria is a five-star restaurant.",

Does this make me a priss expecting this? This says to me that the management is a bit off on how they manage the team and likely tips.  * Once we sat, it was 15 mins until we were given menus. The waiter dropped them off and then disappeared without any explanation. Now, it would be different if they were packed, but they weren't.   * One final example (but not the last remaining \"really?\" moment of the night), somm came over to pour our bottle of wine and barely engaged with me when I asked him about the wine. It was as if he had better things to do than talk to someone about wine. But he's the somm?!  OK, but let me talk about the food because despite the service, I actually did (and do) recommend Sage. My friends and husband had three courses, but being the food champ I am, I had four! :-D My favorite course was my husband's chestnut soup. It was wonderfully delicate and flavorful. The beet salad and my slow-poached egg received big thumbs up too.   I had the veal cheeks for dinner and they were great. Loved the corn and hominy accompaniments. The table favorite was the lamb though.  We had three desserts for the table. I don't remember all three, but do remember a coffee chocolate dessert that was great!  Wine list was good. Great diversity and good price range, while not being overwhelming.",

    "text": "I looked at the menu and figured out that I'd be happier with three appetizers than any combination of appetizer and the main course.  The Foie Gras Brulee was very good - compared to other foie gras brulees that I've had this one tasted much more like a dessert. It was a little odd starting the meal with it.  The spanish octopus was great - it was really tender.  The veal sweatbreads were quite nice. I asked for no mushrooms and they added in some pork belly as a replacement, which was a nice touch. The pork belly itself was just okay - I didn't notice anything particularly wrong with it but it didn't impress.  After all of this I was somehow tempted into ordering a dessert. And because I'm from CA where it would be illegal I had to try the foie gras sundae. Everyone at the table agreed that it sounded horrible. But it was really awesome, and as we compared desserts (other desserts I tried includes the sorbet, which seemed unnecessarily complicated) it ended up as the favorite. Something about the subtle foie gras plus raspberry and white chocolate worked well.  The service was also quite good. The overall experience was good enough that I'd be tempted to come back, but I would want to try out quite a few of the many other places I've yet to visit here in Vegas first.",

    "text": "I would give this restaurant negative stars if I could. True customer service shows through when there is an incident. Unfortunately this restaurant responds very poorly to incidents. The servers here would have let my friend die on the floor if it meant we didn't file a report.  But we did file a report. Both myself and my boyfriend got food poisoning from bad foie gras. We tasted it--it tasted funky--so we sent it back, only to be snubbed by the servers. Then 30 min later we went to the bathroom to vomit. We told the servers and they did nothing for us. After about 15 min, they finally called a professional inspector to file a food safety report.  A full 30 min later, the food safety guy finally came over. At that same time, my other friend was walking back from the bathroom and took a horrendous spill on their slippery floor, hitting her chin and spraining her ankle badly. It swelled like twice the normal size within minutes. The most horrible part: For literally 10 sec, not a single server came to help her. There were like 10 servers there, and they just watched her writhe on the floor in pain.  The inspector ended up filing a report for both incidents. We called the manager of the restaurant (Robert Nikodem) to tell him what had happened. We were appalled by the restaurant's lack of response to both incidents, and hoped he would show us some respect and at least apologize for the terrible experiences we had. Unbelievably, the manager actually snapped at us (like literally talked down to us like children!) and then immediately brought us our check.   We paid the full $300+ for our meal even though we never even got the other half of the courses we ordered. We want to be clear that we never once tried to get out of paying, yet we were treated like second class citizens and quickly shooed out the door.  But we didn't care. All we wanted was to leave that horrible horrible place. You can tell that the culture of a place pervades every person who works there. Unfortunately for Sage, the terrible lack of customer focus pervades each person from the manager down to the servers. I hope the Vegas hospitality gods give this place what's coming to them and shut this place down for good.",

After waiting in the bar for 40 minutes we were seated in the restaurant at the table closest to the bathroom and serving station by the entrance.  Very disappointed with the 2nd table provided.  I should have requested another table since the maitre d' obviously was sticking it to me for asking for a table change from the bar area. We were dressed to the nines and a very cute wealthy couple.   The positive:  The food was fantastic. I had the beet salad and black bass.  Our waiter was great.",

    "text": "This is now the second time we have been here, and both times we had great meals. After having been to many other high-end restaurants, I think this place offers incredibly good value as compared to some of the rest.  Sadly, I don't remember what I had the first time about a year ago, but I did remember having a very good meal. Last night's experience with the 4-course signature menu was very good. We did not choose the 7-course signature menu because the whole table would had have to have it.  The lineup was as follows:  Fois gras brulee: very interesting concept and tasty. Basically creme brulee made with fois gras. Worth trying once for the extra $10, but probably not worthwhile every time, as the Waygu beef tartar was also very good  Scallops: prepared well with ox tail  Pork loin - this is where the money was. After I took the first bite, I had to ask the waiter what I was eating because it was SO incredibly good. The loin itself was good, but they did a second part of it minced and seasoned with mostly pork shoulder, at least according to the waiter. It was unlike anything I have ever eaten.  It would have been awesome if the whole dish was made out of that!!  Layered chocolate cake with coffee ice cream: I remember using a different two-word term starting with a G (ganache?) but can't recall exactly, but wow it was heavenly. It appeared as a small bar, but it was densely rich an incredibly decadent. The coffee ice cream with cocoa shavings was also very good.  Overall, a very good meal, and excellent value for the price. The Tea Rose cocktail was also very good.   Last but not least, the ambiance was also well done. Our party of 8 was located in the smack middle of the filled dining room, yet we felt we can have private conversations without being overheard. We can tell it's very happening all around us, but we didn't have to talk loudly to be heard.   I will definitely be back. It has become a favorite place of mine.",

    "text": "I didn't realize how talked-up the foie gras brulee happened to be until I came to yelp to review the restaurant.  Honestly, if you look at the price tag and decide that this place is perhaps a bit out of your reach, spend a more reasonable amount just to have the foie gras brulee. However, if you're seeking to enjoy a spectacular festival of taste at a venue with stellar ambiance and service and don't mind the price tag, pull up a chair.  I came for a work outing. We had the big eye tuna sashimi and the brulee for appetizers, three rounds of medium wagyu skirt steak, and three desserts which seem no longer to be on the menu. To the desserts: I can't recall anything other than to say that my own choice was a primarily chocolate-centric treat, whereas the second dessert composition had been arranged entirely from items not intended to be used as dessert components (cucumber, for instance) and was itself therefore quite notable, and the third item was not consumed by myself and ergo not memorable to me personally. Two of us also exercised absinthe options to begin a traditional Vegas outing, but I'm the odd one out in that I personally don't drink, so I can't attest to that adventure.  I'll be brief in stating that literally every single item consumed by myself at that table was the best it could possibly have been, and that my own experience overall at Sage decimated any possible perception my mind had previously held about the concept of an excellent restaurant.  Yeah, I'm probably lavishing too much praise, but that's how I feel about it.   Now, going more in-depth in describing my experience would necessitate a significant increase in my enslavement and ensuing abuse of wild adverbs. If I had to describe just how wowed I was by the experience, I'd struggle to precisely define just how my taste buds registered what exactly I had consumed. The complexity in flavors and textures rendered me capable of appreciating the individual ingredients, their respective preparations, and the resulting whimsical delight with each taste which my own mind struggled to tame. The crispy avocado in the skirt steak preparation, for instance, complimented the delicate tenderness of the steak by introducing the slightest tart and crunch to each bite, and the radish shavings freshened the palate immediately following consumption. The portions were about what one could have expected from what was effectively an experience in flavored art, meaning that it would have been unfair for me to have entered with the belief that a Cheesecake Factory-esque helping of food would have been delivered to my table. In spite of this, the process of truly experiencing every morsel of what I had consumed made the entire meal not only the most tasteful in memory, but also the most adequately filling.  I admit that this is perhaps the most politely colorful language I've employed in any review thus far in my limited history as a yelper and likely in any review to follow for a good while. I stand by it, and we intend likewise to visit Sage as regularly as one can visit a top tier restaurant off the strip when living on the other side of the country.  Addressing the bill: If you have a room credit on your room, go ahead and use it. It'll adjust the sticker shock you'll feel once your next credit card statement hits. Shows are great, but this is by far a more memorable experience than any of the dozens of shows on the strip.",

Amazing. You definitely got the lemon flavor and the potato was really smoky.   The American Wagyu steak was also cooked wonderfully, and had a tasty crust. They really give you a good portion of shaved truffle, and that crunchy potato cake thing was like all the crunchy part of breakfast hash browns!  Finished up with the coffee cream cake, which was SO rich and sticky.  The real treat (besides the stellar service, of course) was the table-side absinthe bar! A few people at our table ordered 'em, and it's quite a show! The melting sugar is fun to watch.",

I hemmed and hawed for months when I was charged with the duty of finding a really great fancy (and not too expensive) restaurant for me and my 20 closest girl friends. Seriously. I settled on Sage. Two things pushed me towards this restaurant-- the vegetarian friendly menu (we had vegetarians and a vegan) and that they wouldn't force us to get prix fixe if we split the group in two. Also a bonus-- this place is extremely reasonable for being in Vegas and for the quality of food and service.  The two group split worked perfectly because they sat us in the back room RIGHT next to eachother so we could walk between tables ooh'ing and aah'ing and TASTING. One table got the chef's tasting and another ordered what they felt like. The server at my table was fantastic; SO helpful and sweet and never impatient (even though it was all very confusing at some points with all the girls shuffling and shouting). They allowed some of us to pay cash and others to use their credit cards. They brought us everything we wanted basically. Impeccable service, period.   All the cocktails I tasted were incredible. All the food I tasted was perfectly seasoned and never boring. Highlights include the foie gras brulee, the hanger steak, New York strip, steak tartare, slow poached farm egg. Another very awesome thing was that the chef made a special amuse bouche and dish for our lone vegan friend. She was asked about what she didn't like and she was brought out this totally unique and impressive dish-- she looked SO content. Honestly, everything was fantastic because my friends all toasted me and gushed all weekend about it. I am so so happy I went with Sage.",

Hard to describe, you just have to experience it. The sweetbreads are really, really rich and as an appetizer, the portion could probably be cut in half.   My favorite entrees are the scallops and the skirt steak. Both are probably unlike anything you've tasted before. The scallops are cooked to pure perfection with a beautiful sear on the outside, and the sauce....to die for. I eat tartare, so I like a rare steak and it came out the perfect temp. Nothing  worse than an overcooked steak.   I'm not a big dessert person so can't really comment there, but I promise you one thing.  Sage will give you an over the top dining experience!",

Service was very friendly, no wait for a table, good wine and the food choices.  Maybe I just didn't take as much time as I should have on as many of their offerings since I was focused on making it to the show and feeling fat from the night before, but with all of the other choices in Vegas, I'm not sure if I'll be back here.  positives: + Charred sashimi + Iberico pork loin + Organic farm egg (but not as good as Robuchon's)  negatives: - 36 hour braised wagyu beef.  After 36 hours I expected it to be very very tender and falling apart.  Not so. - Dessert?  I can't remember it",

    "text": "Been wanting to do this review for  a long time now but always keeps forgetting.  My husband and I went there for his birthday in June.  We are both avid foodies and we can say that we had a phenomenal dining experience.  We would definitely go back again.  Ambiance:  The interior decor is a bit fancy and modern.  I really like the up lighting.  The high ceiling makes the space look bigger and spacious  Food:  We got the Chef's Tasting menu which was at $120 per head.  Good choice for first-timers as you get to try a little bit of almost everything.  The selection might have changed since we came but when we went these were the items in the tasting menu:  Market Oysters with Piquillo Pepper and Tabasco Sorbet, Aged Tequilla Mignonette - I normally don't eat oysters but the flavor was so good that I forgot I was eating oysters.  Don't get me wrong, the oyster taste was still there and it's tasted really fresh.  Actually, this was given as a complimentary item by the Chef  Alaskan King Crab with Creamy sunchoke, bacon, and paddlefish roe - I absolutely love this as an appetizer.  I love crabs plus add bacon and I'm a happy camper.  The flavors just melded well.  Heirloom Beet Salad  with Duck Prosciutto, Point Reyes Blue Cheese, Roasted Walnuts, and Celery Vinaigraitte - Light and fresh.  The dressing wasn't overwhelming  Foie Gras Brulle with Salted Brioche, Toasted Cocoa Nibs, and Shaved Torchon - interesting way of serving foie gras.  We think the size is too big though for an appetizer. Maybe they can make the serving size a little bit smaller  Pan-Roasted Sea Scallop  with Jamon Iberico, Green Garlic Flan, Black Trumpet mushrooms  - scallops was cooked perfectly, flavors are just right and compliments each ingredient  Herb-Crusted Lamb Saddle with Crispy Sweetbreads, Baby Fennel, Creamy White Polenta - lamb cooked and seasoned well.  I loved the sweetbreads!  48 Hour Beef Belly with Shaved Purple Asparagus, Ramp Sorrel Puree, and Toasted Almond - beef is so tender it melts in your mouth.    Gianduja Pave  - Olive Oil Ice Cream/Hazelnut Crunch/Basil Jam - Yes, you read it right.  Olive oil ice-cream???  I had my doubts at first but it was a really good plate cleansing item with all the flavors we just had  Strawberry Profiterole - Vanilla Ice Cream/Lemon Sorbet/Chervil Mousse -  Light dessert, not too sweet,  flavors melded well together.   Service: Our server was attentive and really knows the menu that she can answer any question we have.  She also saw that I was not enjoying my cocktail since I am not really into citrusy drinks so she suggested to change it  We enjoyed our dinner and it was definitely worth the money we paid. The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars for this restaurant was because they didn't do my request to bring out a cake for my husband as requested.  I made a note when I did the reservation requesting them to bring out a slice of cake for him but it was not done.  It didn't really matter but would have been nice if they did it.",

However, every once and awhile, you stumble across one that not only meets but exceeds your expectations in every way imaginable. From the service to the ambiance to the food, everything thoroughly surprised me. Mind you though, that all that fanciness doesn't come cheap but I am a huge believer in getting what you pay for.   The last couple of times we have eaten here, service has been superb and the details never a miss. While the portions are generally on the smaller side and served a la carte, it does allow one to sample many things off the menu which is always a treat. However, the best way to get a little of everything without getting to full or breaking the proverbial bank is the tasting menu. I generally try and always take advantage of tasting menus when available because they truly allow you to sample a little bit of everything on the menu.",

    "text": "I was so excited to come to this restaurant from reading all of the great reviews and seeing their tasting menu. We arrived about 15 minutes late, but being that it was a Monday night, they weren't busy, so it wasn't a big deal. The hostess checked us in but was kind of rude. Not once did she even look up at us and just lazily motioned for us to follow the other hostess to our table.  First of all, I am going to comment on the food. The bread and herb butter was so good, we had 2 helpings of each... Dat bacon bread tho... We decided on the tasting menu for $89. This is a great deal if you want to taste a lot of different items. I started off with the foie gras creme brulee... It was savory, rich, decadent and delicious. I wouldn't say it's a MUST HAVE, but for $10, it was worth trying. My bf had the beef tartare, which was delicious as well. Next up we had the scallops and grilled octopus. I loved the mushrooms and scallops, which were perfectly cooked. The octopus was perfect; had a wonderful texture and the mushrooms and peppers went very well with the dish. For our main courses, the bf had the pork loin... OMG, the pork just melted in your mouth and the iberico infused with it just gave it the most amazing flavor! I'm not a fan of pork loin because it tends to be dry and flavorless, but it was the best pork loin ever! The beef belly was also delicious; moist, tender and full of flavor. The polenta was a little salty since the beef was already flavorful, but I didn't mind too much, since there wasn't a lot of it. Finally, for dessert, the panna cotta was to die for! But I'm probably biased since I love panna cotta! It was topped with chocolate crumbles and a wonderful madeline... The ricotta cheesecake was not good AT ALL. Pass on it if you see it... So yes, I was very happy with the food and alone, I give it 4 stars.   Service: OMG. I should have known as soon as our encounter with the hostess that refused to make eye contact... Once we were seated, we waited a few minutes to be greeted by a gentleman who took our drink order. Now I'm a firm believer that the server should greet you within 1-2 minutes of beating seated, but we seriously waited 20 EFFING MINUTES BEFORE OUR SERVER CAME BY!! We were running a little behind to catch a show, and now we were going to be at least 20 more minutes late! W T F ? ! Not only that, but he didn't even offer a proper greeting such as \"hello\", \"how are you doing tonight?\" Or \"sorry for the delay\"... Instead, it was, \"So do you know what you want?\"... Wow, JOHN F (our server), that was just completely unprofessional. As I mentioned, they weren't even busy, so this was completely unacceptable! The guy hardly ever came by to check in on us and once we told him we were running late, he offered to speed things up for us, then took forever with our bill! The only thing that saved this from being a 1 star review was our bus boy, Jordan. He actually checked in with us several times, took our drink orders, brought us more bread and made sure we were taken care of. So guess what? We had no problem giving Jordan a tip in cash and nothing for John.   It would have been a great experience, but ruined by poor service. I might come back, but only if Jordan can be our server!!!",

The decoration has been described as sexy and that's a pretty good assessment.  It's gorgeous.  Serene and relaxing.  A great environment to eat amazing food.  Our server was kind, knowledgeable, and attentive.    We started off with a delicious arancini (fried rice ball) from the kitchen.  My wife ordered the chestnut soup with pork belly.  I tried it... phenomenal.  I started with a poached farm egg with black truffle and toasted bread.  Simple and yet mindblowing.  For dinner, my wife had the gnocchi with braised rabbit and black truffle.  It was great.  I had the scallops which were cooked perfectly in a salted caramel sauce... not too sweet but enough to bring out the flavor of the scallop.  Outstanding.  For dessert, my wife had the liquid pumpkin pie... fantastic flavor.  I ordered the nut tart that came with espresso ice cream, crunchy glazed peanuts, caramel, coffee crispies, and mandarin orange.  No bite tasted the same but all were blissful.   I really commend the chef for allowing the sauces to accent the food without over taking the flavor of the proteins and starches.  I really can't recommend Sage highly enough.  This is the type of restaurant in which you want to take your time.  You will really want the experience to last forever.",

    "text": "Definitely a delectable menu with a very classy yet stylish ambience.   Steaks, poultry, fish, and duck are big on the menu. If you're into duck, sushi, or tartare you'll enjoy the appetizer selections otherwise opt for lobster artichoke soup or the sprout pear and bacon salad.   The meats are very well prepared and incredibly rich. Presentation was fantastic.   I was quite surprised by the extremely slow service. We rarely saw our heavily French accented server though his support staff was always close by for water. I enjoy long eventful dining experiences but this was not eventful; it was almost boring. We spent most of the time with empty glasses or no bread and there's no server around to even request another drink.    At the end of our meal, we shared the white chocolate ganache dessert because of how full we were. It was a little medicinal in flavor, licorice maybe? We ate half, then the aforementioned support staff cleaned the table. Approx 15 empty glass minutes later, our server made his 3rd appearance of the night to say that the dessert was well worth the wait. He had no clue that we already had it, didn't like it, and were done with it.   I would give 3.5 stars. Honestly the food is fantastic but the service really killed the experience. Maybe sitting in the bar area would be better.",

    "text": "4.0 Stars  When you first walk into Sage you'll pass by the two tall glass wine cases that make up the entry way into the bar area. Past that and you'll enter the main dining room that is elegantly lit with purple and yellow lights. I wonder if the head chef is a Los Angeles Lakers fan? The restaurant has high ceilings that help round out the posh interior. As others have mentioned, the interior has sexy and chic written all over it.  Our party dined here on Christmas and were offered two prix-fixe tasting menus to choose from: Christmas Menu consisting of 3 courses for $75 or Chef McClain's Signature Menu consisting of 4 courses for $85. Our server requested our whole table decide on either the Christmas Menu or Chef McClain's Signature Menu and we all opted for the first choice.  The first items brought to the table was our bread. We were offered two varieties that included a Country Bacon Roll and a Sourdough Baguette. On the side we had Sea Salt from Australia and Butter from Las Vegas. Who would've thought there were cows in Las Vegas? Our group got a good laugh out of that. The bread was warm and delicious. I could really taste the bacon flavor infused into the roll and it was scrumptious.  Next came our Amushe Bouche, which was a Berratta Cheese with Pumpkin Seeds and Roasted Tomatoes. It was served on a wide silver spoon that made it easy for a single bite. The cheese had a texture smoother than mozzarella and the pumpkin seeds had a subtle mustard flavor. I liked it.  My 3 course Christmas Menu consisted of the following:  Wagyu Beef Tartare *Crushed Caper Aioli/Slow-Poached Egg/Crispy Chocolate *This was a unique interpretation of beef tartare because it tasted like it was mixed together with mayonnaise or cream. It reminded me of eating the potato salad version of beef tartare. *The egg had an interesting texture because I was expecting the yolk to burst when punctured. On the other hand, the yolk had a solid texture that made it easy to spread onto the 4 slices of toast provided. *The crispy chocolate made the dish stand out because it added a change in texture. The chocolate pieces were very thin and accentuated the already crunchy toast. I couldn't taste the chocolate flavor though. *This wasn't the best beef tartare I've had, but it was an unique interpretation.  Braised Veal Cheeks *King Trumpet Mushrooms/Creamy White Polenta/Black Garlic *The veal cheeks were so tender and divine! They had a robust meaty and hearty flavor. It reminded me of stewed beef. *The polenta had the texture of mashed potatoes, but was actually made from white cornmeal. *The dish also had a crispy long crouton on top. I presume this was for presentation. *The mushrooms and garlic complemented the flavors of the dish really well. *I really enjoyed it.  Honeycrisp Apple Tart *Apple Butter/Sour Cream Gelato *This was a great way to finish off the meal with something sweet, but not overpowering. I tried the other dessert: Dark Chocolate & Espresso Mousse Cake and it was too bitter and heavy for me. *This was very similar to a piece of apple pie with a scoop of ice cream on the side, think Apple Pie ala Mode.  After dessert, our group was presented with one last gift from the chef. It was a Winter Spiced Chocolate Soup that had strong herbal/ginger flavor to it. It had the consistency of hot chocolate. The general consensus wasn't very good within our group because it had a funky taste.   I had a good overall experience from Sage. There were definite hits and misses amongst my meal, but with such an elegant and chic atmosphere and great service I bumped up my review to 4 stars. I rate the food 3.5 stars mainly because it wasn't phenomenal given the fact it had a hefty price tag of $75 for 3 courses. Despite this fact, I'll still recommend trying it at least once.  == A MUST TRY! ==",

The only reason I can't give five stars is that I reserve those ratings, based on comparable restaurants, for the ones that knocked my socks off from start to finish.  Sage is barely one level below Mix, but Sage is still an exceptional restaurant that you should definitely try.  The first time I went to Sage I had the tasting menu, which was good, but nothing to rave about.  However, the second time I went there, it was great (especially the scallops - Michelin level good - I would go back again and again for the scallops).    Overall, the service was great (somewhat of a reserved eye roll when they can't upsell you, but it's fair based on the level of dining).  You won't be rolling your eyes at the end of the meal thinking that you just wasted money (that was L'Atelier - although it was exceptional the first time I ate there, second time around was not memorable and disappointing).",

    "text": "Went to Sage which is located in Aria. It was a Tuesday night and we got a day of reservation on OpenTable.   Really nice ambiance and a nice break from the grandiose glitz of Vegas. Dimly light, relaxed vibe and not too loud where you can carry a conversation easily.  We opted for the 4 course pick your own menu which I highly recommend if dining with another where you can share and get the opportunity to try 8 different dishes. The portion sizes of each course are substantial to the point they can easily be shared. We ordered the salt roasted beets, the alaskan king crab, grilled spanish octopus, wagyu beef tartare, atlantic striped bass, maine boat scallop, waygu filet and organic chicken. The highlights of the meal were:  Salt roasted beets - absolutely embodied the farm to table as you could taste the freshness and I can't remember a better way to start the meal with something light, fresh. and delicious.  Wagyu beef tartare - flavor overload. The crunchiness of the baguette, the delicious tartare, and the egg tied it all together to make it moist and perfectly decadent.  Wagyu Filet - Hands down one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten. The flavor combinations are out of this world, the tender filet along with the puree and black truffle is not to be missed.  Organic Chicken - perfectly cooked with a sweet and savory flavor profile. Maintained that light fresh feel while embodying tons of flavor.  5 stars, 10/10... We got a decent bottle of Reisling, so we ended up getting out of there after tip and tax at about $340 total. Compared to some of the NYC 3-star Michelin's I've broke the bank at... this goes toe to toe with them at a fraction of the cost. Not to be missed - Bravo Chef McClain!",

    "text": "KK and I are in Vegas right now, since Wednesday, for a conference.   It's always a big dilemma for me when in Vegas. Do I revisit the place I know I love, or do I try the millions of new restaurants that have opened since I was last here?  On this trip, we've been doing both. One of the new places we simply had to go to was the Aria Hotel; this much, I knew.  KK made a reservation prior to our arrival to dine at Sage, Aria Hotel's posh restaurant.  The decor at Aria is nothing short of beautiful.  It's a great mix of romantic balanced out w/ modern and sharp. One entire wall of blue light extends an element of fun and lively, but the conservative hardware used to design the place makes it intimate and romantic. Never before have I seen a restaurant that gave so much space in between tables -- privacy was never an issue.  We arrived early to our meal after a happy hour at Social House at Crystals, and the host sat us immediately at a corner table.  The server was nothing short of perfect as far as attentiveness and friendliness.  We ordered a bottle of a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc and read over the menu.  Everything read beautifully.  I chose to have the sweetbreads and flatiron steak; KK chose the eggplant soup, Kusshi oysters, and pork loin.  The amuse bouche of the evening was a sterling silver spoonful of smoked salmon -- totally underwhelming and entirely too small to form a real opinion regarding this dish.  But then began a wonderful procession of food. I tried KK's eggplant soup - and never before have I tasted eggplant so delicious! My sweetbreads were delicious and perfectly cooked. The taste was not masked by sauces - and it was accompanied by thick slices of pork belly.  How could one go wrong with that? KK's pork loin was absolutely delicious. I usually refrain from ordering pork loin due to it being dry, but however Sage cooked it, it was phenomenal. The True show stealer, however, was my flaitiron steak.  I can honestly say that never before have these lips of mine come together with flatiron (not a normally impressive cut) cooked and seasoned so beautifully, with shaved truffle atop the beauty of this dish.  I had asked for it was \"medium rare, but err on the side of err\" to which the server replied, \"So, rare plus?\"  I agreed, and this was PERFECT.  I licked the plate clean.  So why four stars? Well, it's the oysters.  I know and love Kusshi oysters but these were subpar -- I've had better elsewhere.  If you're going to dress them yourself and not offer the typical horseradish and lemon, then you best be sure that you dress them well.  The kitchen, however, didn't make such an impressive creation, and any restaurant that doesn't serve their oysters properly cannot be given 5 stars, in my opinion.  We had originally intended to return to Social House for dessert, per the request of the general manager of Social House.  However, given how great Sage's food was, I was inclined to try at least one dessert.  When our server told us about their french press coffee, well -- he had me at \"French\".  Strangely enough, neither KK nor I remember the pannacotta we ordered.  I do remember the coffee, which was quite delicious, but not the pannacotta.  Very odd.  We simply shared the dessert, then ran back to Social House to try their new coffee and desserts.  Sage is an outstanding new restaurant. For such a new place, they had their act together. The front lounge is phenomenal, and the back restaurant is nothing short of impressive.  The meal is expensive, but well worth every dollar.  On your next trip to Vegas, be sure to check out Sage at the beautiful Aria Hotel.  Running around the Aria Hotel from place to place, bar to bar - and having great company was without a doubt one of my best Vegas memories to date.",

Couple minutes passed and the hostess told us our table was ready.  We were ushered into the restaurant. There were couple people at the bar drinking, but the restaurant looked pretty empty at 5:30 pm. We were seated at the front part of the restaurant by the bar. I thought it was weird that when we were seated, the hostess never gave us our menus. Couple more minutes passes. No water or menu. We tried to get couple waiters attention, but we were ignored like 3x. When the waiter finally came to our table, he was nice, but seemed to lack details of the restaurant.  I think he was new. Once we placed our orders, our food came out fast. Everything we ordered was delicious.",

    "text": "This restaurant is worth every penny!  The service was superb, the food was beyond my wildest highest expectations and they have absinthe. The absinthe was the main reason we chose this restaurant, not knowing that the food would be amazing.   The one dish that you must absolutely order is the FOIE GRAS BRULEE. Holy crap!!! I mean where else can you order that dish? No where else that I know of.   The Maine Lobster Agnolotti and the shortribs were also top notch. Even the house bread (bacon bread) was to die for.   We ended the night with absinthe for dessert. Our first experience... Tasted kind of like licorice and although it's pretty mild going down, it's like over 100 proof alcohol.   Check it out, you won't be disappointed!",

I try to be open minded when it comes to service because I have worked in the service industry to eight years, but the rest of my party was very upset with the service.    The food was amazing!  I got the scallops and really enjoyed my dish.  I was also kind of surprised at the dessert menu.  They had a lot of interesting options, but they didn't have a staple dessert like a brownie or creme brulee.    With all of that being said, I would highly recommend Sage.

Perfectly seasoned with a beautiful yolk on top and served with sinfully buttered crisps. DROOL- 5/5  Maine scallops: I've gone to many $$$$ restaurants who manage to over-cook their scallops. Sage is NOT one of them! Well-executed, melt-in-your-mouth, orgasmically good.- 5/5  Beef belly: Eh... too smoky for my taste. One of the cons of getting prix-fixe is the menu including something you're not too excited about in the first place. - 2/5  Peanut butter chocolate tart: Is there such thing as too much peanut butter? Why, yes, yes there is... and sadly, it was in this tart. -2/5  Service was friendly & attentive, good atmosphere.   Disclaimer- I was quite inebriated by the 3rd course due to previous libations consumed before & during dinner which may have affected the last two ratings... however, I can promise you I vividly remember the tartare and scallops... and those two dishes were enough to bump the rating to a 4. :)",

    "text": "This review pertains to the Restaurant Week menu.   The Skinny: solid modern twist to some great classic offerings (4) service is warm and efficient (5) value: it's restaurant week - for the level of cuisine, definitely worth and can't wait to try it again (4).   My hubby and I were super stoked to try this place out after all the accolades by the local food critic. Between the both of us, we tried all the items on the tasting menu (see pics above): summer peach salad, corn chowder, wagyu beef and halibut.   We started off with an amuse of ahi tuna tartare which was nicely balanced in flavour and texture.   The corn chowder with crab really accentuated the natural characteristics of corn - it's innate sweetness and it's creamy texture. Wonderful dish.   The salad was a truly harmonious dish. Everything just worked on the plate. You had the textural crunch of the nuts, the saltiness of the bacon, the sweet/tart of the peaches and the lightness of the butter lettuce. All these ingredients sung inside your mouth.   The entrees were slightly less successful than the appetizers.   The wagyu sirloin served with boulangere potatoes, onion tart and pickled tomatoes was good but wasn't perfect. Beef had a nice texture and was seasoned correctly but wasn't anything special. The pickled tomatoes were delicious with the onion tart. The boulangere potatoes were a miss - blanched potatoes sitting in a bland rosemary infused consomme.   The halibut fared better. It was well seasoned and cooked perfectly. Loved the accompanying vegetables and use of apricots to sweeten the dish.   Dessert was a modern twist on the s'more. A caramelized marshmallow topping over a chocolate cake with a ginger graham cracker and a serving of ice cream. I loved the story the pastry chef was trying to convey with the use of pine nuts in the ice cream to remind diners of the woods and campfires (although it didn't really taste like pine nuts, it was a nice idea). We were also treated to a hot chocolate mixed with espresso which was a nice end to the meal.   Service was friendly and the atmosphere is tres chic. The manager recognized us from the Wet Republic event (I'm not sure how because it was packed there) the night before and welcomed us to the restaurant.   Overall, given the quality of the food and menu, this place deserves a solid 4 star rating and a return trip to try their non-Restaurant week offerings.",

    "text": "Visited Vegas last weekend and had to introduce my friends to the great ambiance & service of Sage.   Sage is located feet away from the Aria reception area. It has a somehwat small front, but don't let that fool you, the dining area has a grand high ceiling dining room with gentle ambient lighting and spacious dining tables.  We made a reservation previous day, when we arrived, we were taken promptly to the dining area. We had a large circuluar table and very comfotable seating. We already had some cocktails from the Sage bar area ( $15  crafted cocktails).    Our waitress Virgina did a great job explaining the menu and some options for a 4 course meal. Scanning the menu we decided to have grilled spanish octopus to start & I ordered the snake river NY strip steak coupled with a Merlot to enhance the taste.  When the appitizer arrived, they brought in two seperate plates as they knew we were sharing, The Spanish Octopus was very tasty, had a nice ting to it, I would have it again! Our friends ordered Wagyu Beef Tartare & they did not like it & returned it, we were not charged for it later.  My snake river NY strip arrived and I must say is was very good, Beef Marrow,  Potatoes, and glazed maitake mushrooms. Was it tastey? Yes, Was it worth $54? No.  And last but not least, desert, and this was the big grand finale since Absinth was recently legalized. This is an experince worth daring to do since you are in Vegas & I did not post photos of any who decided to try it.  The choice was Butterfly Switzerland, which is a 130 proof A Absinth. You dont drink it, you inhale the fumes..and again, yes, it is legal. The effect apparently, is like getting somewhat high ~~~~~^^^^^^^^ 8-D..  We spent a good 2 hours there and we had a good time. The service was excellent but the prices were a tad high and thats why I am giving it a 4 star.   My recommendation, skip dinner and go for the $35 Butterfly Switzerland Absinth!",

    "text": "Located in the \"front\" of the casino by the Hotel Lobby by other restaurants, it sits in the corner between restaurants like BarMASA and Julian Serrano.  With a party of 2, with my friend and myself, our reservation was set for 6:30pm on a Wednesday night, during the week of the largest convention in town (CES). Not only did they quickly find the reservation, they directed us to be seated, even though we were a bit early ! (maybe 10-15 minutes)   By the entrance, they have glass enclosed racks of various wines (available to order) displayed. From what it seems, there are 3 \"rooms\" to the restaurant. First room, will have a fully stocked, wide and long bar, along with some longer tables along the length of the bar for large parties as well as smaller tables along the wall. The second and third room are the main dining areas. As with a lot of high end restaurants, the ambiances and lighting is dim but each table is accented with a light as well as some walls are accented with a purple light. wonderful atmosphere !  Aside from the regular menu, is a separate smaller menu, which features their signature tasting menu for i believe $89/person, and their chef's tasting menu for i believe $150/person.   We had ordered the Wagyu Beef Tartare as a starter (to be shared), Grimaud Farms Duck Breast (hers), and Snake River Farms New York Strip (mine). We were told by the waiter, we will be brought bread, when it is ready. i was like \"ooooh freshly baked bread!:  After ordering, we were brought a small plate with a metal spoon, a standard special of the day amuse bouche (single-bite hors d'uvre). Today's amuse bouche was a piece of big eye tuna with a pistachio puree on the side. Tuna was very fresh and matched well with the puree. Though personally, the puree tasted more towards the peanut flavor than pistachio. Along with the amuse bouche, we were given a plate with 2 things on it. One was a small dish to what seemed like a house blended butter with herb and the other was course pink sea salt (less salty but slight hint of sweetness) .   As mentioned before, bread was brought out when ready. One was a french baguette, the other i didnt catch the name of. My friend got the french baguette, and i got the other one. Indeed, the bread was warm (score!) and the waiter said we can get more if we wanted to later (woo ! no i didnt ask for more hahaah). As usual with my friend, if we get different things, we share =P i got to try her baguette and to my surprise, not only was it well made, it was stopped with sea salt ! nice surprise and touch ! my bread was nice too but wish i remembered to ask what it was.   The starter, Wagyu Beef Tartare arrived pretty quick, set in the middle of the table, for sharing. Mixed in the tartare is a crushed caper aioli, topped with a slow-poached egg, with a drizzle on the side of pickled mustard seeds and accented with crispy chocolate, and a side of PERFECTLY toasted bread. To my surprise, i thought the egg yolk was supposed to be raw, like a raw quail egg. I forgot it was slow-poached. The server suggested to just mix everything together and eat it on the toast. As recommended, thats what was done. The beef was super tender, though with some small chewy spots that somehow always found its way into between my teeth. GRR lol.. I didnt really taste the capers but did find some while eating, and was able to taste if ate separately. The crispy chocolate thing was a little weird? more like a chocolate flavored chip to me. Both my friend and I liked this dish  Now the main entrees. The Grimaud Farms Duck Breast arrived sliced with a persimmon (fuyu persimmon for those familiar.. the soft type) diced and puree, spiced rillette (pretty much a seasoned and slow cooked pork shredded) and roasted cauliflower. The duck breast was seasoned well and pan seared skin was crispy. Perfect cook ! seasoned pretty well. Though the spiced rillette to me, seemed a little off from the main dish.   The Snack River Farms New York Strip was topped with a beef marrow, a la ratte (fingerling) potato puree on the side, and glazed Maitake mushrooms. The steak was ordered to be cooked to a medium rare, and indeed, it was a perfect medium rare (past experiences at other restaurants has gotten me extremely scared nowadays). Nice seasoned and tender steak. Glazed maitake mushrooms had a nice unique (sour-ish?) flavor.   With our entree's we were given a side of mashed potatoes. Upon first tasting, what was going through my head \"oh my god its so buttery and smooth\". I'm not sure how they got it so smooth but oh my god they put a lot of butter. Still pretty good though.   To finish off the meal, we were given a white chocolate almond soup in a small glass. Nice almond flavor but sweet.   Overall experience was great. Waiter refilled the waters really often (never went passed half)... +1 from me for their effort. Overall a great place for a nice dinner. Prices aren't that bad either. Total for our dinner was a little over $100",

I don't drink, but I brought my girlfriend here to try the absinthe experience as well as the cotton candy cocktail. The way they craft drinks here is very visually stimulating, so even if you don't drink like me, it's cool to see in person! (But of course bring along someone who does drink hahah)  **And not to mention, on certain days, they have a live DJ, who is AMAZING! Not only does she DJs, but she also plays an electronic violin at the same time, total badass. She'll even come by with her violin and give you a personal show. Awesome awesome person!!   There are many types of absinthe drinks to choose from, but unfortunately we didn't get to choose ours, which was disappointing. I got it compt from myVegas, which doesn't mention anything about a specific drink you get, but hey I guess it was free and something cool to try. The manager chose a really herby one for us; for two girls, I would've thought he would choose the fruity one hahah. These drinks are really really strong so take your time drinking them!   My girlfriend's favorite was definitely the cotton candy cocktail! Sweets and alcohol in one! Can't go wrong with that.   PRICE: $35 for absinthe experience (it ranges from ~$25-$35); $16 for cotton candy cocktail   SERVICE: it was okay, I would give a 3 for service because the bar had less than 10 people inside, very empty, but our waiter wasn't very attentive to us; it was hard to find him, we had to ask another waiter for water. The DJ was more attentive and helpful to us than our own waiter, which is kind of sad.",

Just like the rest of the Vegas restaurants, this place is overpriced.  However, if you are getting those comp dollars then please use them here! This place a delicious menu and I had a chance to taste a bit of everything!  -Kushi Oysters- What's not to love about freshly shucked, small oysters that pack a lot of flavor?!  Served with a tobacco sorbet, it was quite refreshing!  -Wagyu tartare- Again, see comment above.. What's not to love about tartare, especially when it's WAGYU! Really great texture, flavorful, and perfect size.  -Heirloom tomatoes-  Simple, refreshing, and good.  Nothing great, but nothing bad... just tomatoes!  -Foie Gras Brulee- WOW! this is something different, for sure! New spin on foie gras, delicious flavor, and the most popular dish at our table, for sure! Loved the smokey flavors without it being too salty, as foie gras can get that way sometimes!  -Australian Wagyu sirloin- YUM! Melt in my mouth tender, juicy, and perfectly cooked!   - Iberico Pork Loin- very tender, but I do recall a bit on the greasy side.  -Chocolate Olive Oil dessert- this was quite the creation mixing both sweet and savory! I was a fan, because the olive oil was really brought out and showcased in this dish!  Overall, come here if you're not paying.. Overpriced, but if you have some casino comps, or you're feeling like you want to splurge, this place will give you a great dining experience!",

Anyways, on to the good stuff -- the oyster was off the chart, $22 for 6 small oysters but man the kick and the power you get out of each one is better than anything you can get at the buffets here in LV. We did the three course sampler and I got the Alaskan King crab salad, beef tartar with poached egg, and the scallop with oxtail! I enjoyed the king crab the most, and the scallop with the oxtail is a great blend for every bite. Beef tartar is a unique taste but it's strong so it's better off to share  Overall, I rate this: DELICIOUS***  ***if you don't have to pay for it",

Wagyu beef tartar with crushed caper aoili, slow poached egg, pickled mustard seeds & crispy chocolate!  Heaven on earth!    Foie gras custard brulee with bing cherries, toasted cocoa nibs & salted brioche -- My favorite way to have foie gras.  DAYAM it was GOOOOOD.  Main Courses:  Maine scallops with braised oxtail, wild mushrooms and salted caramel reduction - Fabulous-O!  Salted reduction was genius.    The short ribs were dynamite.  They were so tender and quite the party in my mouth!  I've been dying for something like this after watching an episode of Master Chef season finale.  Dessert:   Efferescent grape mousse with greek yogurt posset, carbonated grapes and lychee sorbet. Unique! Never seen anything like it on any menu & pretty darn amazing.  Didn't think I would like it but wanted to try it because it's so different.  What a perfect combo of balance... especially with the lychee sorbet.  Apple fritters with root beer panna cotta, apple cider sorbet with sassafras ice cream. This is supposed to replicate what you would get at the fair, but with a sophisticated twist.  The edible paper was so cool.  Definitely a lot of intricate details involved in crafting this piece of art.  UNIQUE & EXCELLENT in every way!  Talk about creative.  Must try the grape mousse.  I was a bit nervous but the pastry chef knows what she is doing.  Complex, creative & delicious. Better move quick though because the options change with the season.  At the end of our meal we were given warm sage milk.  How fitting and perfect to help cleanse the pallet.",

Other high end restaurants provide for free. I'd expect that at a place like this.",

    "text": "Sage is an absolutely outstanding restaurant - a couple of misses almost inclined me to go 4-stars, but after much thought, I realized the hits where so phenomenal, I'd be remiss to deduct a star.  First off, the starters: -Foie Gras Custard Brulee - Wow. One of the most unique dishes I've had, and absolutely fantastic.  -Grilled Octopus - excellent and worth getting - nice flavor and perfectly cooked -Roasted Wild Mushrooms - Holy WOW. Maybe I was most impressed with this because it seemed least wowable when we ordered it, but I can't put into words how delicious this dish was.  Best mushroom dish of any kind I've ever had anywhere. I convinced my sister, who hates mushrooms, to try a bite and her eyes lit up and she said \"that's amazing.\"  Mains -Pork Loin - Wow again. Definitely one of the best pork dishes I've ever had.  Even the greens were so good I turned to my fiance and said \"you have to try these.\" Don't try to picture this dish - it's nothing like you would expect. And it will exceed your expectations.  -Braised short rib - the short rib itself was delicious, but the pickled cauliflower on this dish was a bad miss. Kind of bizarre actually - all 4 of us tried it, and none of us liked it, and it just did not work on the plate at all.  This is reason one I contemplated 4 stars. It's hard for me to give 5 stars with such a big miss. -Crab Ravioli - my sister (a picky eater) ordered this and didn't like it. I will say, it had a very unique flavor (unlike any flavor profile I've ever had with a pasta), and I could see a lot of folks not caring for it, but I liked it OK - not enough to order it, but enough that I ate several bites of hers!  The crab was extremely fresh.  But definitely not a 5-star dish, and reason two I contemplated 4 stars overall.  Otherwise, I liked the atmosphere, and the service was OK (not as good as I expect from a restaurant of this caliber, but not bad).    I will definitely return the next time I'm in Vegas.",

The waiter was attentive, friendly and professional. The ambiance is Vegas but classy.  The Turbot was excellent as was the squash salad. The desert was 'smoked chocolate ice cream' some might like but not to my taste. Tasted like sausage flavored ice cream. An excellent meal and experience. This was social/business meeting with 3 others.",

We chose Sage mainly because of the other great reviews we found on Yelp, so thank you fellow yelpers!   Anyways, you won't find another restaurant like this in Vegas right now! It is really different, but in a nice way! We loved the well-spaced seating throughout the restaurant. Great ambiance, as well!   They have a very nice beer selection, so the hubby tried a couple different types of beers and I stuck with a glass or two of cab. For appetizers we shared the oysters (hubby's pick) and the black and blue tuna (my pick). Let's just say I thoroughly enjoy my pick and hubby enjoyed his as well, but there wasn't a whole lot of sharing going on, haha. For the entrees, hubby had the veal cheeks and I had the scallops with oxtail. The veal was very tender, almost like a stew consistency. And my scallops were like butter......so very good!!! A great recommendation from our waiter.   By the end of the meal, the waiter brought us our bill, and I noticed it had a few extra items on it that we didn't have. We brought this to his attention and he fixed it right away. Normally, I would have been a little upset at this, but it was an honest mistake as I noticed all the additional items were what was ordered by the couple next to us, haha!   Probably the best part of the meal was the complimentary hot chocolate shooter they give to you at the end! It was really quite delectable...I think I would have taken a few and called it a night ; )",

We got the Sage tasting menu, which came with 4 incredibly flavorful and enjoyable courses.  The best part of the meal was the ability of the waitstaff to assess the personality of our party and really personalize our dining experience.  We thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere, the meal, and our time spent at Sage.  It was easily one of the most enjoyable dining experiences I've ever had.  I would happily come back to this restaurant next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "I don't know if I was particularly starving or exhausted or some sick combination of both, but I didn't go into Sage expecting a whole lot, but was blown away by the service and the food quality!   It was surprisingly empty for a Friday night, but as long as the food is good, what do I care?  I got the Chef's menu and enjoyed every single dish.  The chef started us off with a little amuse bouche of some sort of escargot.  I'm not a huge fan of snails, but this one tasted a bit smoky and not too much like snail, so all was well.  My first dish was the Wagyu Beef Tartare, with a poached egg yolk on top.  It was served with a generous amount of delicious toasted bread soaked in olive oil and the combination of the beef, egg, and bread was fantastic.  It was followed up with a couple of seared scallops and braised oxtail.  the scallops were cooked perfectly and the oxtail was so tender it practically fell apart.  My main dish was a 48 hour beef belly (actually, it's marinated for 24 hours, then cooked for 48 hours, so it should really be called a 72 hour beef belly) which was so tender it literally melted in my mouth.  By that time, I was completely full; however, this beef belly was so good I finished it all and powered through.  I finished off my meal with an apple and fennel crumble-like concoction with some brown butter ice cream.  While it was delicious, it was way too sweet for me and I couldn't handle it after the copious amount of food I just ingested.  Regardless, the service was amazing - all of the waiters were very attentive and friendly.  The food was delicious and completely blew me away!  I don't know why this restaurant wasn't more packed, because I've definitely been to other \"higher-rated\" restaurants that underwhelmed and disappointed me.  I'd recommend Sage if you're looking for a great meal at a great price!",

Very cool design and a generally cool vibe made for a good start.  We sat at the bar and had great service from the bartenders.  As we sipped on a very good bottle of red wine and enjoyed a trio of appetizers the restaurant did get a bit busy and it was good to see things picking up for them.     Service and ambiance alone would get five stars from me, however the food, all though well conceptualized just simply was not seasoned properly.   This just leads me to believe that they are still working out the kinks and training the staff to properly prepare the items.  A little salt and pepper goes a long way, and unfortunately they didn't seem to have any in the kitchen on this night.    Overall, I think that this restaurant will do well, and I will back to have a full dinner sometime soon.   I'm pretty sure that they will have things ironed out soon.",

Most of the high-end dining in vegas is a poor facsimile of their original NYC, Paris, or SF locations (I've been highly disappointed by Nobu, Scarpetta, Bar Masa, Michael Mina's joints, etc) but Sage is a vegas creation all its own and it shows.  The food was great - as others have mentioned...foie gras creme brulee. I am pretty jaded when it comes to foie gras concoctions but this was just amazing.  I didn't LOVE the atmosphere as it was classic showy \"vegas\" but if you want a meal that is actually GOOD and not just expensive for expensive's sake... Sage is your place.",

For the main course I had the pork loin which yes I know, pork loin tends to be dry.  It's almost impossible to cook pork loin where it comes out juicy.  The loin pretty much tasted like canadian bacon but at 8x the price.  It was indeed pretty dry and tough in some areas.  It was probably sous vide to retain some moisture but if they did do that, even that didn't work.  Since they pre-sliced it the loin lost most of it was cold before I was finished.  It was a nice effort but for what I expected I was a little disappointed.  I'll definitely go back and try something else.",

We sat at the bar before dinner for a drink; the bartender was super friendly and went over menu items he enjoyed while he made our drinks. My date was sold on the fact that they had a secret recipe for the best Manhattan in town. It was fabulous by the way, they use a lemon twist to garnish instead of a cherry, and I think that is what made the difference! I had a dirty martini of course, was pretty close to perfect!  When we first sat down and I opened the menu I am not going to lie, I was not very turned on to eat anything really, with menu items like pork belly, nothing really stood out to me at first. We started off with the seared Ahi, which being from Hawaii, was just OK (hardly any flavor), but then came the main course. I ordered the beef tenderloin, and I have never enjoyed anything so much in my life. It literally melted in my mouth! Was the perfect portion size, not too much, but not so small you walk out hungry. My date had the Pork Tenderloin and it was very rich and flavorful as well, I'm not a huge pork fan, but it was very good.  I will have to disagree with Blair B. we had a great server and the bartender was really amazing, even the hostesses were really friendly.   We didn't save any room for dessert, so I will have to go back to let you know how their desserts are!",

We get walked to our table and dayum this restaurant is huge! Must have taken 15 minutes to get to our table at the very back of the place (okay maybe not 15 but you get the idea). It's a great all around restaurant from decor to lighting to the menu and drink options and, of course, the grub.  We decided to go with the Chef's tasting menu (what the heck it's Christmas right?) and from the amuse buse to the dessert this was one delicious meal! I won't go into specifics as I'm sure it gets changed as much as every night but these were some of the tastiest plates I've had. Some that come to mind are the Wagyu Beef Tartare which not only started with some great beef but also added a Caper Aioli (anything with Capers for me is halfway there) and the crispy chocolate got me all the way there and beyond. The braised short rib with a bone marrow crostini on top was so rich that I'm sure an artery got blocked that night. On top of that it was as tasty as tasty gets. Our waiter seemed a bit arrogant initially but it may have been the setting as when the wife left for the ladies room for the second time (she has the bladder of a squirrel) he and I got to talk a bit and he was really a cool and laid back dude that recommended some other nice places to grub the next time we came back to LV.  By the way this place has a great selection of not only wines but some very good beers. For me being able to chose from more than one IPA on the menu (when you aren't a pub) scores a 10 in my book. Actually, just OFFERING an IPA on the menu is better than most places. Overall I would come back here not only for the food but the beer, wine and good service.",

    "text": "So Sage was booked the night after a tremendous meal at Tao.  After reading the reviews we were both very much looking forward to the meal/experience.  I'll begin by stating the service was \"top-notch\".  Probably one of the best I have ever had in my 36+ years.  Our dinner reservation was on the early side, 6:30pm as we had a 9pm show and wanted to allow enough time.  We arrived on time and were promptly seated at a very private table for two towards the back of the restaurant.  The restaurant itself is very attractive in a dark, purple sultry type of way.  Now with that out of the way, the reason we went here in the first place... the food.  Unfortunately this is where I truly feel, it was just \"ok\".  If I'm putting down over two bills for dinner, I want to at some point be blown away by the entire meal, or atleast one of the items experienced.  Once seated and having reviewed the drink menu, we started with our drinks.  I was in a beer mood so went with the Sierra Nevada on draught, and the gf went with a pino grigio.  When the drinks arrived, my beer was only half-full and was issued an apology that the draught system is having problems, and I would need to select a beer off the bottle menu.  Not the way I was looking to start off the meal.  After going with a different selection and review of the dinner menu, I opted for the 4 course chef tasting and the gf went with the halibut.  The choice of bread was good, as we both went with the bacon infused and the amuse that arrived was just \"ok\".  Some sort of jelly that was pretty much tasteless.  My first course was the beef tartar which was good and a decent enough portion to share a significant amount.  The second course was the scallops.  They were cooked fine, but honestly the portion size was a bit ridiculous.  Two very very tiny scallops.  I mean verrrry tiny.  Third course was the 48 hour beef belly.  LET DOWN.  This was about 98% pure fat.  Pretty much inedible.  As normal the course was brought with a separate meat knife.  Unfortunately the only use was to try and find any meat at all in an entire plate full of fat.  Even writing this review now, i can't believe that was served as one of the courses in an $80 4 course menu.  The fourth course was a warm carrot cake with cream cheese ice-cream.  I'm not the biggest carrot cake fan, but the gf is and I didn't much care for the other dessert option.  The gf had the halibut for her main course.  It was a nice piece of fish, however, when you drop close to $50 for a piece of fish, what you don't want to hear is \" it's good, but I can do this just as good at home\".  Problem was that she was right.  There was nothing spectacular or anything to set this dish apart from a very fresh piece cooked at home.  Would I eat here again...no.  Would I recommend anyone else to go who has only a brief period of time to experience vegas dining....no.  Was this meal worthy of the number that arrived on the bill... not even close.  Had two very good meals at the same exact price point while out there the last three nights ( Tao, Emeril's ), and unfortunately Sage was quite a let down when it came to the food.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came here for dinner.  We had the Signature Tasting Menu and it was a good amount of food.  We shared so we both had a little bit of everything on that menu.  Some highlights are the Foie gras brulee and the wagyu beef tartare.  We really liked the brulee but I am glad that we shared because like the waiter said it is very rich.  The scallops were also notable.  I paid a little bit more for the wagyu sirloin but it was worth the money.  It wasn't the best wagyu I've ever had but it was good.  My boyfriend got the beef belly which he liked but I thought was okay.  I have to say that overall this is probably the best meal that I've ever had.  I liked or loved every plate.  The waiter was friendly and very helpful as well.  The food came out in the perfect amount of time, they give you a little time to rest before the next plate.  I was definitely full after the tasting which I was surprised about.   I wish that I had saved a little more room because the white hot chocolate drink they give you at the end of the dinner was sooo good.   The music is kind of loud but that's pretty much the only thing that I could think of that needs improvement.   We loved it here so give it a shot if you're ever in Vegas!",

    "text": "After reading several positive reviews on <a href=\"http://yelp.com\">yelp.com</a>, my wife and I looked forward to our dinner at the Sage Restaurant.   As we walked into the restaurant, the first thing that comes to mind is that it is very dark, warm, and inviting.  The low-lighting, dark purple arrangements, high ceilings, and the art work contributes to this romantic effect.  In the main dining area, the tables and seating were laid out spaciously - it gave the illusion of being not too crowded, but not empty.  Seats were comfortable, but the table was not.  For a fine dining establishment, there were no tablecloths.  It was just a bare table.  It looked and felt rather cheap.  In addition, we noted that most of the tables had a LARGE round base bottom.  Problem with this is that it was difficult to put your feet down  ~ one foot was on the base and the other was on the floor.  As a result, when seated, you kind of feel tilted.  As I scanned the room, I noticed every couple had the same issue.  You think the restaurant's management would notice. Please replace these tables with something else and put some tablecloths on them.    As for dinner, we made our selection based on the <a href=\"http://yelp.com\">yelp.com</a> reviews.    Our first course was the Foie gras custard brulee.  I ordered one dish for my wife and one for myself.  The blend of the blood orange, chocolates, and brioche was exquisite at the first bite.  At $25 a pop, it can be extremely expensive.  This is where our waiter should have stepped in and advised us to limit this to \"one\" course that should be shared.  Honestly, 1 dish per person was a bit too \"much\".  Think of it this way, the first bite is inspiring; however, the more you tastes it, it becomes boring and uninspiring (think of Ricarodo's law of diminishing returns).    Our second course was the slow poached organic farm egg.  This was our favorite dish of the night.  At the base of the dish is smoked potato.  It is layered with a half-boiled egg topped with truffles.  My wife and I loved this dish.  Of note, like the brulee, this was a very rich dish as well.  Unlike the brulee, I would recommend ordering 2 of this (one for yourself and one for your significant other).  Our third course was a light salad.  We shared the Taylor shaved pears with brussel sprouts.  Hmm, this was an okay dish.  At $15, I thought this was way overpriced.  It was a slice of pear, some greens, some brussel sprouts, and bacon.  It probably cost less than a dollar worth of ingredients.  It was quite unimaginative and nothing special.  As for our entree, my wife had the liberty farm duck and I had the Belgian braised ribs.  With the duck, you basically get like 5-6 sliver of duck meat with some greens under the base.  I travelled the world trying various duck and this was \"blah\".  There was no punch or much spice.   It was bland!  And, it cost $48 a plate.  Honestly, I could have gone to china town and bought TWO WHOLE roasted duck for $36 and it would have tasted so much better.  This was a True disappointment.    As for my ribs, it was one of the few positives of this meal.  It was cooked perfectly.  The meat peeled off the bone and it was very tender.  The only issue was the plating.  The chef decided to plate this in a round cramped cylinder.  It looks good at first, but when you try to cut the meat and use the fork, it was cumbersome.  This may be a bit of an exaggeration but think of it this way, try cutting a piece of meat in a Campbell soup can... who does that?  Note to the chef, think of plating this in a large plate.  Keep it simple.  Finally, we ordered the pineapple passion fruit dessert.  Basically, this was fried passion fruit topped with a sorbet that was sprinkled with pineapple.  It was way too sweet for my taste.  Another disappointment!  As for the service, our waiter John was okay and on par.  He provided some good explanations on some dishes, but I wished he stepped in and recommended the type and quantity of our selection (i.e. one shared dish of brulee).  At other major establishments, our waiters have been excellent.  Of note, John also waited on the table next to us.  It was two business ladies.  Apparently, during the meal, the waiter failed to follow-up with these patrons (they had to wait over 20 minutes to order their desserts AFTER receiving the menu).  They complained amongst themselves regarding this issue.  At this type of restaurant, this was inexcusable. Management should have taken note.  For our meal with a tea rose martini, the total price came to $230 for two.  Add in the tip, it topped $270 bucks for two.    Overall, with many fine dining establishments, my wife and I looked forward to our \"next\" dish.  At Sage, we were looking forward to \"finishing\" the meal and getting over the evening's disappointments.  For the price and the meal, we cannot justify a quality rating.  There are so many better places to dine within the Las Vegas area.",

    "text": "My husband and I went to Sage on the recommendation of a friend.  We were not disappointed.  We ordered the 7 course chef's tasting menu with wine pairing and added the steak tartar as we were told it was not to be missed.   We started at the bar with a wonderful hand crafted beer for my husband and a drink with St. Germain (my favorite liquor).  The bar tender was very knowledgeable and affable.   We started with an Amuse Buche (sp?)  of an oyster that was really very good.  The bread had bacon in it (my husband loved that), and the butter was creamy with some sea salt on the side.  Yum. First course was a tuna belly  tartar with some watercress and cracked black pepper.  It was melt in your mouth good.  Buttery with a touch of spice from the watercress.   We had our waygu tartar as a 1.5 course.... It was also buttery and wonderful.  It had truffles and olive oil.  Wonderful. The next course was foie grois brulee.  I can't even begin to explain this dish.  I hate foie grois and creme brulee, but I couldn't get enough of this stuff.  It was creamy, somewhat sweet and savory with the cruncy top.  It was topped with something fried and crunchy, but I don't remember what it was.   It was served with buttery brioche bits of heaven.  I can't get the stuff out of my head - it was really that good. We had a duck tourine which was awesome, and and some sort of meat that was absolutely insane.  We also had scallops at some time - honestly after the brulee, I was in such a food coma that I don't remember a lot of it. The wine pairings were perfect, and I even tried some wines that I had not had before. We had a raspberry chocolate and a peanut butter chocolate dessert that were heavenly. We decided to skip the absinthe even though they are known for it becasue we didn't want to lose the taste of the wonderful food.   The cost was high, but absolutely worth it. We have done chef's tastings at other well known restaurants (i.e. Bartelato del Mar), and this was leaps and bounds better.  There is just no comparison.",

    "text": "My bestie & I happened across this restaurant while perusing the Aria Hotel.  She yelped it & saw that it had excellent reviews so we decided to give it a try for my husbands bday.  It was THE best decision we made.  The atmosphere was warm & inviting. The decor, contemporary & sheek but very intimate even having a large party as we did.  The food exquisite.  First things first I must mention their delicious bread rolls.  I always believe the sign of a good restaurant begins with their bread.  The waiter came around with a plethora of bread choices...I chose their bacon bread.  Yummmm friggen Yummm.  One can never go wrong with anything bacon but this bread was fresh, crunchy crust outside but soft & warm on the inside.   I started with The Di Stefano Farms Burrata Cheese salad which was a nice blend of butter beans, artichoke hearts, Burrata Cheese tossed in a light vinegrette. Prior to our appetizers being served, the waiter brought our entire table Amousse Bouche, sample size cream of mushroom soup, compliments of the chef. While I'm use to cream of mushroom out of a can, I will admit having it fresh was pleasing to my palate. For my main course I decided on the Kobe Flat Iron steak....this, I must say was DIVINE.  Usually flat irons can be fatty but this...this was heaven on a plate, cooked to perfection. It's served with shaved black truffles that when added to each bite took the awesome Kobe flat iron right over my mind blowing precipice. Acommpanying the steak was a fluffy Bleu Cheese Mash potato & heirloom carrots that tasted like candy.  If it wasn't such a fine dining restaurant, I would have easily picked up my plate & licked it clean. Heaven knows I was around friends that night who would NOT have cared because we were all in food bliss!  The indulgent & undisciplined person that I am decided on Sage's Warm Brioche Bread Pudding served with a warm Meyers Rum sauce & delicious Brown Butter Icecream to seal my fate of gluttony.  BUT just when I thought I could not eat a morsel more...the waiter once again gifted us each with a warm chocolate shot to accompany my husbands chocolate birthday torte complete with candle!  The service was impeccable. The ambiance awesome & the food DIVINE.....That is the formula for a Great restaurant!  I highly recommend SAGE and will be returning at  next years trip to LV!",

After being wowed by the beer list, I started out with the poached egg, and it was indeed as delicious as other yelpers have pointed out.  So delicious,  I begrudgingly shared it with my dining companions so as not to waste the truffle infused goodness the perfectly poached egg was nestled in.  I then moved on to the lobster angolotti, and it did not disappoint.  The only dish I should have skipped was dessert (and anyone who knows me know I always save room for dessert).  The bread pudding had a good(not great) flavor but was overcooked and tough.  The butterscotch/caramel ice cream that topped the bread pudding was the standout and I wish I could have ordered another scoop.    Anyway, if you are staying near Aria, I would definitely give Sage a try.",

Although the website touts that this restaurant has uncomplicated the menu, there were words I didn't recognize. When I mentioned to the server that I felt like I needed a dictionary for some of the words, he suggested that I access Google on my phone to find my answers. Later during our dining experience, I heard him say the same thing to the women at the next table. I'm sorry, but I thought we were being discouraged to use cell phones in restaurants. I wonder too if a man had asked about the menu if the server would have responded as glibly.  I felt somewhat rushed in that my dining partner ate a little faster than me, and every time she had finished a course the server would come and attempt to remove both of our plates. During our tasting I had to ask to not have my plate removed on three different occasions. Finally, I was disappointed that our table was not tidied during our entire meal. The fact that there are no tablecloths may have been a factor.  The table was wooden and pretty, but during the meal drips, spills and crumbs went unnoticed by the staff and impacted the presentation of the food and pleasantness of the experience. Although the food was exceptional, and I would recommend Sage for the food, I expected a better overall dining experience and unfortunately Sage fell short. I'd give the restaurant a 5 for food, but a 2 for service. BTW, we went early on a Friday before going to a 9:30 show.",

I think where things really dropped-off was towards the end of the meal, when it came time to either order desert or the tab, and our waiter, who had been with us from the moment we first were seated, was no where to be found. Instead, without any \"hand-off\" or anything, we had a different server. This was just somehow \"unnerving\". So, we asked for the bill, paid our tab and unceremoniously, left the restaurant without as much as a \"thank you\". Again, less then a \"feel good\", when spending some $300+ on dinner.

We arrived early and I had a sublimely subtle sage martini at the bar before sitting down in one of the very mellow eggplant-colored dining rooms. The amuse bouche was this delicious tuna tartar with pureed sweet potatoes, the orgasmic foie gras I already mentioned, and the skirt steak was cooked right--medium rare--with almonds and thinly sliced new potatoes. My boyfriend had the veal with mushrooms and it was so buttery and sensual that I was tempted to eat his entree as well. The cheesecake hit just the right texture and hint of pucker, but the real end of the meal came in a tiny cup from the chef--an orange hot chocolate that was so perfectly blended and balanced with a rich cocoa flavor and not a trace of bitterness, and not overly sweet either, that I couldn't help but do that shuddering sigh that only True happiness can induce.",

    "text": "Thursday, December 22, 2011 at 5:00pm: Party of 4: My Second Visit  Sage was the finest dining experience I have ever had. I wore my finest suit for the occasion. We were greeted by a friendly hostess and were escorted into the lounge.  The artwork and decor were classic 1920's / 1930's. The purple and gold hues with low lighting set the mood. We were escorted into the restaurant. My wife and I were in two chairs while the other couple loved the bench seating wrapped around a column. The menus were easy to read.  Throughout the evening, the staff met all of our needs. The ones who stood out to me were James, John and Pablo.  They were attentive, quick, personable and knowledgeable.  The meal was outrageous. The warm bacon bread roll and sourdough baguette with creamy butter and sea salt created an obviously salty taste to the level I wanted.  My wife and I followed that up with the Shaved Brussels sprout salad with pears, macadamia nuts, and a vinaigrette. It was sweet and tangy.   Slow-Poached Organic Farm Egg: Smoked Potato / Shaved Summer Truffles / Toasted Country Bread. It was warm and soothing.  The Pacific Yellowtail Crudo: Shaved Trumpet Mushrooms / Black Summer Truffle / Toasted Pine Nuts. The yellowtail was cool and the pine nuts created a nice texture in combination with it.  Side note: Truffles go great with the last two items.  My main course was the Iberico Pork Loin: Milk-Braised Cannelloni / Baby Eggplant / Creminelli Mortadella.  The meat, pasta, vegetable combination was great. The meat was soft and had a special flavor. I had to read a little about Iberico Pork Loin, because it was so good. It's even a specialty in Spain (Iberian Peninsula).  We didn't get the dessert this time, but we were here in July 2011 and the dessert was excellent in presentation and in taste.  We started the day in an Aria Sky Suite with a view of the Strip watching the sunrise over the mountains just to the left of the Mandarin. We had breakfast at the Cafe Vettro and spent the day in Aria. This was end of a perfect day and the beginning of a wonderful evening before going to see a show at 7:00pm.",

I tried the beef tar tar topped with a raw yolk, foie gras brouille, day boat scallops with ox tail and mushroom reduction and beef belly with asparagus. For the desert course the gladly accommodated my request for berries instead of the pine nut tort or olive oil ice cream.  The food was superb, the prices were too high, the wine list too short. For the price of the meals, I would expect a better ambience. Since there are so many amazing places to eat in Vegas, we probably won't go back, but I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't been.",

    "text": "Oooh fancy new restaurant in the Aria hotel.....modern yet classy atmosphere... everyone is dressed up....well almost everyone...I saw some woman with tennis shoes....=/ but most were in dressy jeans and dress shirts, dresses and suits. Like all fancy restaurants...the menu is very limited...and it took me awhile to decide what I wanted.  So for starters, they give a complimentary piece of bread (either the bacon wheat or regular sourdough...since I don't like sourdough I took the bacon wheat...which oOoh was soooooo good with the lavender butter spread!) then they was a tiny teaspoon of lobster meat and something else..lol also complimentary of the chef...it was a small bite but quite flavorful.   I ordered the Belgian Ale-Braised Short Rib....and my bf ordered the Liberty Farms Duck....I honestly didn't like the short rib that I ordered because it was like eating fat and it was pretty salty....it came in two pieces...with a few fondant potato sticks..which is really fries..lol but they were salty too.....so at $41 dollars I felt like I was eating over-salted larb. =/ It might sound like I'm exaggerating .... and maybe I am...but that's how I would describe the short rib. The duck on the other hand was really good...despite the fact that I don't like figs...with which it came with as a light sauce...I liked it way much more than my short ribs.   So I'm really giving this place 3 stars and half....the service was pretty good...nothing to complain about there...it wasn't a very busy night even though it's Friday evening...but then again it's Vegas...most ppl are either drunk or gambling...not eating at $50 a plate restaurants....unless they are up...haha   Overall I guess I wouldn't mind coming back...but eh I might just as well stick with buffets....for $50 bucks at least I get a wide selection...and I would be full...honestly I don't think I was full...so I wanted dessert but they didn't offer anything I wanted so I kinda left not hungry but not super full either. Good for dates I guess...since if the girl didn't want to eat so full after fitting into that oh-so-hard-to-get-into dress. =P",

    "text": "I chose to eat at Sage simply because of its location in the Aria resort where I was seeing a show.  I knew nothing of Shawn McClain or the restaurant.  After eating at Sage, I am a fan of both!  I believe the menu varies according to what is seasonal and fresh.  The menu I saw was pretty extensive for fine dining.  I chose the $79 Chef's Signature menu which is a four course meal, amuse bouche and additional dessert \"compliments of the chef.\"  Starter: Bacon bread with whipped butter and sea salt Amouse Bouche: duck pate with fig First course: Heirloom tomato salad Second course: Maine scallops with braised oxtail in salted caramel reduction Third course: Pork loin Fourth course: Peach profiterolls Chef's dessert: mint infused chocolate soup  Cocktail: Desert Blush  I am not exaggerating when I say that each course was truly wonderful.  I felt like I was eating a meal prepared by someone who actually cared about every bite.  The portions are perfect for this type of menu.  The service was spot-on.  It seemed that we had four people making sure we were well cared for -- all very friendly.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and comfortable.  Sage turned out to be a very happy surprise for me.  It was a meal I'll remember.",

The food is delicious, and was immensely mood enhancing - a good thing, considering the impression Sage made on me from the start.  The amuse bouche, appetizers, and mains reminded me of Scott Bryan's uncomplicated perfectionism, while the desserts are very creative and offer interesting spins on seasonal flavors.  It has a large by-the-glass program, and the pours are a decent size.  Normally I could overlook the inexperienced staff, the decor, and the uncomfortable seating, but the prices put it within range of Eleven Madison Park, which outclasses it in every way.  It's a hard place to give a full recommendation to, but perhaps if you can eat at the bar, some of the unfortunate factors can be avoided.",

    "text": "First off, FOOD was EXCELLENT but the service was terrible and unnecessarily so.    We had called ahead to let them know that we were a little late for our reservation. 10 minutes and I believe the standard allowable is 15 min.     Arrived to be told that they gave our table away and that we would have to wait for it.   Told them that was not satisfactory, that we had called ahead and were told this would be no problem.   They said they would see what they could do.   We were okay with that because we had found a table in the bar and figured we could have a few drinks.    Waited almost 40 minutes and asked 3 times for a bar menu.   This waiter ( I assume) kind of wander by and finally gave us an Ipad with no explanation as to what to do with it.   Tried to use it and it didn't work.   The same waiter came back and took it away and never came back???   At 50 minutes in, we asked about our table again and they said \"Oh that's right, come with me,\"  I'm guessing they forgot we were waiting???   We finally get seated and immediately ask for our drinks.   We again, had this Ipad given to us that didn't work.    Now an hour in, we asked somebody to please just take our drink order and bring us something.   Maybe the desperate plea is what they were waiting for because I'm assuming our \"waiter\" finally came over and took our drink order.   It took a second request to \"bring our drinks sometime...today\" and a half hour before our drinks finally arrived.   They then took our order and at this point we felt trapped.  We were hungry but hated being there but our friends were jet lag and not up for hunting down another place and waiting more time to get food.   So we reluctantly placed our order.   The food again was excellent but took about 30 minutes to come out.   But the service for our table was the equivalent to being served at a Denny's.   Our tableware was practically thrown on our table and made clanking noises when placed.  When our food was served, it was shoved in front of us to the point that our food slid to the other side of the plate.     In total, we spent 3.5 hours there and only an hour of it eating.  2.5 was spent trying to get drinks, food...someone to acknowledge us?!?!    I hate writing these type of reviews because I feel like I'm whining but honestly it was this bad.   Not sure if this was an off night or new staff but it's unacceptable and I don't recommend dinner here.",

    "text": "Yeah, this place really sucks. Mostly because I've been here for a week and haven't eaten here every night.  Oh, and also because Aaron the bartender is not available to be my personal meal selector on a permanent basis.  By now, you may or may not know that I'm a horrible decision maker.  As in, I do not possess the ability to make one.  So, when everything looks incredible, I enter standby mode.  I thought about ordering several drinks.  One included tobacco leaf infused bourbon and one included smoked grapes.  But Aaron, my decision maker, put the kibosh on that.  Yeah, I'm not a smoker and probably don't want to end up barfing.  If I wanted to do that, I would have gone for bottle service with my coworkers.  The smoked grapes just got that subtle, yet obvious, head shake.  So, I went for the sidecar.  It was tasty but didn't hold a candle to my friend's Moscow Mule.  Served in a copper mug, that puppy didn't lose its frost for 2 hours.  Awesome.  Anyhow, since I clearly couldn't pick a bev, it seemed hopeless for food.  Aaron talked us into the poached egg and we also chose the sweetbreads.  Holy cow, that egg was unbelieveable!  Just enough truffle oil (and I'm SO over truffle oil, btw) and smoked potatoes.  Amazing!  Then there were the sweetbreads.  Perfectly cooked with a big fat piece of bacon on top.  So good.  After blankly staring at the menu and driving everyone nuts, I ultimately let Aaron surprise me with an entree.  He didn't let me down.  Scallops with braised oxtail.  Unreal.  Four huge scallops cooked to perfection with tender oxtail.  Everything I never knew I wanted.  Time for drink two.  I've read about classic daiquiris in Updike novels but now I know why they were always so popular.  Not your typical spring break concoction, this bev was the single best i've had in weeks.  Ridiculous.  To finish things off, Aaron surprised us with the carrot cake.  I'm pretty sure you can guess how that went.  So I LOVE this place.  I'm just sad that I wasted so much time at the Monte Carlo food court.  Time to give up the crack smoking.  Sage, say hello to your next regular.",

    "text": "Was in Vegas for the weekend and a group of us went to Sage for dinner to celebrate a friend's birthday. Why the three stars?  When I go to a restaurant, there a several things that make it a good experience: decor, service, and food. Here's the breakdown:  Decor: upscale elegance.  Simple, chic and classy.  Service: if it wasn't for the waitress, I would've given Sage 5 stars.  Talk about a total SNOB.  The whole time my friends and I were there she had her nose up in the air as if she was better than us or something.  You know when you could kind of tell if someone is totally two-faced?  Well our waitress was a prime example.  She had FAKE plastered all over her.  One of us in our party wanted to order an appetizer first because we were waiting for two more people to join our group.  We asked if it was ok to do that and she hesitated and was like, oh yes, that's fine.  But then she does some other stuff and completely ignores the request and walks away.  And so we ask again when she comes back and she's like \"Is this for the whole table?  Our appetizers are more individual portions and aren't meant to be shared\".  We were like wtf?  Does she think we were just gonna order 1 appetizer and split between the 12 of us or something?  What the hell is wrong with her? I mean I get that maybe it was more proper to have all the food come out at once so not only 1 person is eating while everyone else is waiting but she was acting like a total snob about it.  Makes me irritated just thinking about it.  And I'm the type of person that rarely gets mad at anything. I took off two stars because of her.  Food:  Now here is where the good stuff is.  The food definitely saved the night.  Bread was ok, nothing smancy.  They gave us this bite sized appetizer - smidgen of cherry tomato w/ some sort of crunchy item and sauce. Totally delicious and i dont even normally like cherry tomatoes.  For my main entree, I ordered the Maine Day Boat Scallops - braised oxtail, wild mushrooms, and a salted caramel reductions.  I gotta give props to the chef because those scallops were unbelievably delicious.  Cooked to perfection.  The best scallops I've ever had.  I'm just drooling about them as I'm typing this. haha..  So my friends and I made the best of the night even though the waitress treated us as such. oh and to top it off, when we paid the tab, a mix of card and cash, she comes back and tells us we're like 15 dollars short and she said that she added it to on the card. My friend kindly told her that she was wrong and asked her to look at it again.  And of course, she realized she made a mistake.  She didnt even apologize.  She just was like \"oh, i'll go fix it\"  and when she came back she was like \"I was looking at the wrong total\" or something along those lines.  But no apology.  Come one.  My friends and I are Asian.  You don't mess with Asians and their math.",

    "text": "During the Restaurant Week 2012(Feb 27-Mar 4), my friend took me to this beautiful place.  We decided to have a dinner together since it was my birthday week. If someone asks what will be the best dining experience ever and why it's so special...?  I can say without hesitation that it is not the best seat in a fancy 5 star restaurant, it's the joy of company having a nice conversation and a meal.  I will not trade that for the world :) I sometimes hear people describing the art work, a music concert, opera, or even poetry reading along similar lines are beautiful but I wish more people would realize that sharing food can be the same way as well.  Actually, it wasn't my first time trying out food at Sage.  In Aug 30th 2010, there was a fundraiser for Three Square(\"Wet your Appetite @Wet Republic - MGM Grand).  I had a chance to sample the foods, cocktails, & desserts from each restaurant's food station including Craft Steak, Jean Georges Steakhouse, Circo, Sensi, Joel Robuchon, Fleur de Lys, Burger Bar, & Sage.  All the dishes were excellent but the Ginger flavor cocktail from Sage was outstanding that I still remember the taste of it!   I started my dinner at Sage ordering a glass of cocktail called, \" Dark & Stormy\" It was basically a rum with a fresh lime & a ginger beer :). It was very refreshing and tasty.  *1st course: \"Spring Green Garlic Soup\" - very mild flavor of Spring garlic, light texture of Greek yogurt,  & crispy duct confit.  It was a very unique dish that I never had it before.  \"Seared Bison Tenderloin Carpaccio - Amazing!  At first, It looked as a raw tuna by the color but the taste was very solid.  The roasted pistachio & beets were sprinkled over the bison carpaccio & it blended well with the dish I thought.   *2nd course: \"Roasted Jumbo Fluke\" - This dish was well presented with spinach, brown butter apples, & crispy leeks.  It was so tender and juicy inside and the crispy golden brown texture outside. I learned one thing from this dish that the sweetness of the apple can go well with the fish. \"American Wagyu Flat Iron Steak\" - Oh, it was melting in my mouth!  We ordered a medium cooked for our steak and it was perfect.  It was fairly pinkish red in the center, beautifully juicy, with crisped and crunchy edges, and so much flavor! It wasn't necessary to cut the steak with a knife because it was so tender.  I was enjoying the dish along with the salsa verde and the potato puree.   *3rd course: \"Gianduja Pave\" - it was a small dessert/ice cream with a flavor of caramel, hazelnut, & tangerine.  The taste was so rich that the small portion was more than enough to spoil my appetite for a dessert!  *a complimentary drink for surprise: At the end of our dinner, the server brought a tiny porcelain cup of warm chocolate milk infused with fresh rosemary :) The aroma of rosemary was pleasant and I learned that it is a valuable in digesting foods that can be used in many dishes. I thought the pine-like fragrance & pungent flavor of rosemary went well with warm chocolate milk.    I would like to say our server, Johnathan, he was the picture of perfection in service.  He was taking time to explain all the dishes we had and waited on us at exactly the right moment each time checking on us.  And he remembered to put a little candle on my dessert and that was very nice :P I extremely loved the interior decor such as high columns, huge mirror walls, elegant lamps on random tables, and chocolate brown colored theme all the way through out entire restaurant. I really think the chef & food make a great restaurant, but also the staff & environment ambiance also contribute. I am definitely coming back for the chef McClain's Tasting Menu to try more dishes and can't wait to taste their famous \"Foie Gras Brulee\" :P  PS $50.12 - per person for Restaurant Week Menu        $14 - classic cocktail price",

The tables. Spaced nicely apart .  However the giant pedestal under the table leaves you nowhere to put your feet.   Photos of you and your guest?  Moments after being sat, we were asked if we would like our photo taken.  Unbelievable at a well priced dining establishment. Took the romance right out of the restaurant.  The sommelier the star of the night . Five stars.  We ordered fois and tartare apps.  Scallops and short ribs for entrees.  Fois good, weird but good. Apps came flying out. The tartare tasted excellent except for the gelled egg yoke. Overcooked. How did no one notice in the kitchen. I ate it anyway.   No sooner were apps removed before the entrees came flying out as well.  My worst pet peeve in a restaurant. I thought we were at mcdonalds.   Scallops no real complaints. Short rib, same. Biggest complaint here, the bus staff is not trained to not take plates until all guests are finished. How many times will they try to take your plates. Buy a book on dining etiquette and train it to your staff.  About an hour into our rushed meal, we had had enough. Pass on desserts. Even though I wrote in my open table reservation that it was my wife's birthday we were celebrating, this was never acknowledged.     We paid our bill and left a fifteen percent tip. Our usual is twenty percent. Ten would have been deserved.  Sage. Thanks for ruining dinner. We were so bummed after eating there, we cancelled our reservation at Gordon Ramsay steak.  Tired of paying for less then stellar experiences.   We both work for our money.",

    "text": "The chef's signature menu is incredible. We added a few things to it, and were almost uncomfortably full, so don't do that. Just do the chef's signature menu.   Also, request Jason Bond as your waiter, because he is just the greatest thing that has ever happened ever. Attentive, adorable, and great at making suggestions should you require them. I have a giant crush on him.   But anyways:  we added the foie gras creme brulee, because our amazing waiter told us to, and it was delightful. I'm not sure why it comes with giant pieces of buttered, baked bread though. The foie gras is so delicate, that putting it on a giant piece of texas toast feels a bit sacreligious.   We also added a raw dish, which Jason warned us was small, but we didn't listen...and we should have. It was delicious, but split for ways, it was just a tiny bite.   On to the signature menu!  The wagyu beef tartar is sinfully delicious. It comes with a slow poached egg that is rich and runny and perfect, as well as crispy chocolate, which - not gonna lie - you can't really taste, but it adds a nice texture contrast.   The dayboat scallops were among the most perfectly cooked that I've ever had, with a salted carmel reduction that was a fantastic flavor balance.  I was already getting full by the time the wagyu sirloin showed up, but when I saw that marbling, I basically swooned under the table, then got up, and cleaned my plate. Incredible.   We shared the desserts, a chocolate confection, and a fun take on a lemon pie. They were both served rather deconstructed, so we had a lot of fun tasting different components and savoring each flavor.   Such a good experience.",

    "text": "Went here with some friends.  The service was alright, but not 5 stars as I saw the waiters hanging out talking.  Everyone else including the hosts acted classy and to the caliber expected of the restaurant.  The people who pour the drinks take great care in even testing what they pour.  They are extremely knowledgeable and honest outside our waiter. The waiter basically made up answers when asking him a question.  1. Asked about Absinthe and if the Absinthe sold is the type that gives you hallucinations (made with wormwood has Thujone as the active ingredient). Waiter replies. \" NO government all around the world would ever allow any drugs like that to be sold to anyone.\" I reply \"Salvia\".  Weird awkward silence.  Then he goes on a rant how wormwood isn't an active ingredient for that and he's smoked tons of it with no effect...  I don't expect waiters to know the chemistry of smoking something rather than brewing something, but for a $20 glass of absinthe it makes Sage look like it's joke when it's suppose to be a classy place.   We do not allow the chemical Thujone from the woodworm brewing method to be included in Absinthe sold in the United States. Strictly for the reason of the effects it has on the body.  For him to say all the absinthe at Sage was brewed the exact same way as it was 100 years ago is ridiculous, unless they are breaking the law.  2. We asked the water guy what type of tea it is they serve.  He brought out the actual can as he wasn't too sure.  Super helpful super friendly.  So we ask the same waiter.  He say's \"Well it's a secret blend that only sales to exclusive rock star hotels like us\".  As he's saying that I'm looking up the exact same can of tea on my phone.  My friend ordered it after leaving the restaurant.  The food now.  It is good, but not like the other upscale dinning I've had around the world.  Only thing world class is the duck Foie Gras. The idiot waiter is almost offensive.  I would come again if they go through a purge of the stupid waiters, and the food price matched the quality.",

Upscale setting, incredible drinks, attentive staff...oh, and I haven't even gotten to the food!  We had several starters which were all so unique and tasty. Started things off with the duck fat roasted heirloom beets salad. I typically don't even like beets but this appetizer changed my mind. We also tried the wagyu beef tartare with a slow poached egg. It was such an awesome combination, piled on top of crispy brioche cracker for a crunchy, flavorful taste.   For my main dish I got the most flavorful scallops I have ever had in my life. The consistency was flawless and they were expertly paired with braised oxtail, wild mushrooms, and finished with a salted caramel reduction.  For dessert, they brought each of us a bite-sized, rich and tasty chocolate dish, compliments of the chef. Overall an incredible dining experience and I would highly recommend it!",

I've been here three times and we've dined at the bar each time. This place must have just about the best bar staff in town, because they've always been chatty, informative, and terrific with their liqours.

Perfectly cooked egg, crostini spears, and an appropriate and generous portion of truffle shavings on top.  WONDERFUL, complex, flavorful and rich.  Next was the Foie gras, best I have had, because it was paired with this chewy, spongy, delicately toasted, thick, buttery Texas toast bread that was to die for.  That-with the smooth richness of the Foie gras-was superb.  I followed it up with scallops that were perfect.  They didn't have any surprises, but were simply perfectly executed scallops, which is a feat of its own.  I am so eager to return.",

    "text": "My wife and I came here to Sage last night.  We had great hopes, having read the great reviews, but we left disappointed.  First, we arrived 8 minutes early, but the \"too hot\" hostesses refused to seat us.  \"I'm sorry, we're seating on time this evening.  Why don't you grab a drink at the bar.  We will get you when your table is ready.\"  We chose instead to walk for a couple minutes, but when we returned, even though we were still early, they sat us right away.  It was obvious they were pushing people to the bar to buy drinks before they sat down.    Second, we had one good appetizer and one we didn't like at all.  The market oysters were great, prepared with piquillo pepper and tabasco sorbet.  Probably the high point of our meal.  The low point was the much heralded foie gras custard brulee.  We love foie gras, and since it is now illegal in California, we had been looking forward to trying this dish.  We thought it was strange, soupy and inedible.  Our server asked us if we liked it, we said no, and while encouraging us to try it with more bread, she acknowledged that not everyone likes it.  Each of us only had a bite, but the server never said another word about it.  No offers to bring another appetizer - no apologies, no nothing, just indifference, and $25 on the bill.  Third, our entrees were fine.  My wife had the Morro Bay Black Cod, which was perfectly cooked with a beautiful \"bar\" of pumpkin flan and deliciously chewy pancetta.  I had the kobe skirt steak, which was good too, but the sweet potato puree and pecan-brown butter vinagrette that were both supposed to come with the dish were just drizzles under the pile of sliced meat - there was barely enough to get the meat wet much less add much flavor.    We finished with the caramelized layer cake - good flavors but it tasted old and stale.  Plus the crumbled slice looked like it was cut by our toddler.  We wondered if they scraped together the last bits of cake from the night before.  OK, so the bottom line is that for us Sage didn't live up to its reviews and its price point.  It was pretentious and overrated, and for $250 for two, we expected better.",

The bread they initially give you is just okay, but still yummy. I definitely recommend using the herb butter with sea salt. SO GOOD!  Chestnut Soup - One of my favorite dishes of the night. It was so savory and a great way to start the meal.  Mushroom Salad - I also really loved the salad. The mushrooms were delicious and I love endives as well. The poached egg on top really added to it. Only thing I didn't eat were the purple leaves since I don't like bitter.  Kobe beef with cauliflower salsa verde - TOO DELICIOUS! It is very rich and salty, but so good! If only I hadn't eaten my entire soup and salad before (plus bread) I would have eaten the whole thing. It was a really good balance of meat and vegetables, and the salsa verde was amazing. To be honest, it also tasted great the next day as leftovers.  Chocolate Panna Cotta - The deconstructed panna cotta was also just okay. I didn't like the madelines that came with it. Still delicious though :)",

She ordered the oxtail, carpaccio, foie gras creme brulee  and roasted peppers. Each of them very elegant and tasty!   Oh and the dessert is to die for! I forgot what it was called but it was recommended by the bartender, it was pistachio something with ice cream topped with rhubarb and meringue! So delish!!!   I hope this review helps my fellow yelpers! Muaaah   Try try or die die!",

It was dark, sleek and had black lights which is always a plus. We chose the 4 course tasting menu. Everything was delicious and a good size. The service was good but not very welcoming. Our server seemed like he was just going through the motions. I know it's fine dining, but I feel service should not be stuffy even at high end restaurants.",

I had the bacon bread which was really good..and I loved that the sea salt was separate from the butter because I love salt. I'll eat salt by itself, it's so good. While we were waiting for our meals, they gave us a tiny spoonful serving of pureed date and blood orange on a piece of artichoke. It was cute and a nice little offering. My bf and I shared a plate of the kobe beef (I didn't want to eat too much because my dress was so tight, haha) and a salad..it was more than enough. The kobe beef was SO good. Tender and juicy.  I also had a bite of a friend's beef tartare which was SO good also. That was my first time trying beef tartare and I hope all my future tartare experiences are as wonderful as this one. The service was excellent. This is not a place for a quick dinner.",

    "text": "Sage is a fabulous restaurant, but I think chef Shawn McClain needs to tame his passion for fat.  Two of us had the 4 course menu.  I started with the market oysters, each a perfect mouthful, with delicious piquillo pepper and tequila mignotte.  Next I had day boat scallops, prepared in a very rich oxtail broth with wild mushrooms.  The beef and mushrooms almost overwhelmed the scallops but it was an intriguing contrast.  Third course was the Iberico pork roast.  The crispy confit and surprisingly the brussel sprouts and dates that accompanied it were delicious.  My dessert was warm carrot cake, very light, with a coconut sauce, a lovely ending to the meal.  My husband had the Wagyu beef tartare for his first course and honestly the fat was overwhelming.  We know to expect Wagyu or Kobe beef to be highly marbled, but in raw form it was very unctuous and hard to have more than a couple bites.  His second course was lobster agnolotti, which was more like cannelloni than traditional agnolotti, but quite tasty.  His third course was the 48 hour beef belly (hey, he choose it).  Yes, beef belly is a lot like pork belly only pork belly is a lot tastier in IMHO.  His dessert was the chocolate and caramel tart, which was essentially a very intense version of a Snickers bar.  We had the wine pairings which presented a interesting selection and introduced us to a new varietal, Gruner Veltliner.  I'd definitely recommend Sage, but balance the lighter foods with the richer ones.",

I had pretty low expectations---I have been to Green Zebra and while I liked it, I thought it was really overpriced and didn't love to atmosphere and haven't been back. We picked Sage because it was one of the few places on the Strip (that I was aware of, at least) that had multiple good vegetarian options at dinner.  The food was really great! We split the poached egg entree for a starter, and it was so rich and delicious, the service was outstanding, and we had a great time.",

    "text": "My sister and I came here to have our \"fancy\" meal of our Vegas trip.  We opted for the $79 signature menu.  The stand out items were the heirloom beets cooked in duck fat, the scallops and the pork loin.  The beef belly was too fatty for me.  Other yelpers describe the food so much better, so I'll leave it to them.  The service was fantastic!  It felt like we had 5 different people waiting on us.  Our plates were taken away quickly and our courses came very well timed.  Unfortunately, it seemed our neighbors were not having the same level of service.  There was a disgruntled older couple and a mother/daughter table whose order must have been forgotten because they were there before us and didn't get any food until after we had had our 3rd course.  I've never heard so many apologies from a waiter in my life.  Good old Gil was having a bad night (also dropped a tray of silverware).  I'm glad it wasn't our table that got the bad service.  I guess you don't need to dress up to go (but you can if you like).  Our neighbors had shorts and a polo top on-sneakers too, I believe---so you won't get booted out or shunned.  Or is that why they got the bad service??",

    "text": "We were in Vegas this past Presidents Day weekend and the choice to eat at Sage was an easy one because we have dined several times at Spring in Chicago, Chef McClain's first restaurant.  There were eight of us and it was really, really delicious.  I had the poached egg, which was so outstanding I wished I could have licked the bowl and ordered 5 more.  I then had the hangar steak which was perfectly cooked and full of flavor.  In addition, everything else on my plate was bursting with flavor as well, including just a plain carrot.  Our dining companions also loved their meals, with the exception of one who ordered the pumpkin soup and scallops.  He said it was good, not great.  Then we got to dessert.  This place would have been 5 stars for me easily, but the desserts were just ok.  I am a huge bread pudding fan and although my serving vessel that the pudding was in was hot, the pudding was luke warm on the outside and cold on the inside making it dense and tough.  The other desserts were better than mine but also not outstanding and it was a disapointing way to end the meal.  Based on other reviews here, it seems Chef McClain should consider changing his pastry chef.  Otherwise I highly recommend this restaurant.",

Jason, our waiter was tremendous. An all time great meal was had by all.  Back dining room is quiet and bathed in dark fabrics, front of house more sensory minded, with music and lighting.",

    "text": "Wanted to try Sage after reading all the good reviews.  Its actually a much nicer looking restaurant than I thought it would be.  For some reason I thought it would be a little more rustic looking.  Anyways, the hottie and I had a great meal and would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone.  We got the signature tasting menu and of course, we each ordered different courses so we could have a taste of everything.  First course the hottie got the foie gras brulee.  It was good but I would not call it spectacular.  I got the wagyu beef tartare.  I will admit I am not a conissouer of tartare so I wasn't sure what to expect.  After all, you would think that since its raw, there would not be much of a difference between wagyu beef or any other beef..... wrong!  It was awesome!  In my mind, the best course I had that night.  The wagyu beef was so flavorful, mixed in with the egg, and a nice crispy toast to go along with it.  Second course, the hottie got the scallops and braised oxtail.  Good scallops but I really can't get excited about scallops anymore.  I got a rabbit wrapped in bacon.  Really creative so that the look and taste of the dish reminded me of canadian bacon.  Yum!  Third course, the restaurant ran out of the beef belly so they replaced it with the braised short rib.  Meat falling off the bone!  I ordered and was really looking forward to the Iberico pork loin.  I had heard so much about Iberico pork I think I was expecting too much.  The pork was good but nothing special.  I think my expectations were just too high for Iberico.  For dessert, the hottie got an apple streudel and I got the chocolate and peanut butter tart.  My chocolate and peanut butter tart tasted like reeses peanut butter cup but richer and more refined.    Overall, high marks for this restaurant and highly recommended to all.",

    "text": "Most people come to Vegas to gamble, to party and to sin.  Truth be told, I don't gamble and I can party much harder and sin far worse in my hometown of Los Angeles than I can in Vegas.  My sin in Vegas is gluttony. Add to that worshipping at the temple of Michelin, whose bright stars cast a long shadow over Vegas, and idolizing the three French gods of cuisine who have set up outposts here (Robuchon, Savoy and Gagnaire), I'd say I have my fair share of penance to pay.  So it's surprising, then, that the best meal of my recent trip was neither Michelin starred nor devised in France.  It was at Sage, Shawn McClain's contemporary American ode to the farm-to-table/artisanal/sustainable/seasonal ethos.  Now, let me be clear, those terms hold no particular draw for me. I'm just as happy for my produce to be exotic, my fish to be endangered, and my truffles to be out of season. And this is Vegas, a neon outpost in the desert, a place where money trumps ideology and possibly the least sustainable city in America.  No, what brought me to Sage was that, after the buzz had quietened and the dust had settled on the new CityCenter's more talked about restaurants -- Gagnaire's first US outpost Twist and Bar Masa/Shaboo's $500 hot pot -- Sage emerged as the most interesting new restaurant in Vegas.  Not that Shawn McClain doesn't come with accolades. Esquire magazine's \"Chef of the Year\", James Beard winner for \"Best Chef Midwest\" but it's safe to say he's not a household name outside of Chicago.  Yet.  The restaurant space itself is everything you'd expect in Vegas from the newest Dubai-funded casino on the Strip. Opulent, expansive, classy and swathed in plum and gold. This is not a restaurant you wander into from the casino floor.  This is a destination.  And the service there was impeccable. Probably the best I've received in ANY restaurant. Ever. Friendly without being intrusive, knowledgeable without being pretentious, and generous.  Vancouver Island Kusshi Oysters | Piquillo Pepper and Tobasco Sorbet / Aged-Tequila Mignonette I love kusshis by themselves but the piquillo pepper and tobasco sorbet was stunning. A perfect cold and hot complement to the briny oyster. With a nod to Mexico, the mignonette sauce was made with aged tequila rather than vinegar.  Heirloom Beet Salad | Duck Prosciutto / Point Reyes Blue Cheese / Roasted Walnuts / Celery Vinaigrette One of my favorite dishes of the night. Simple in its preparation, the beets were soft and flavorful, the vinaigrette perfectly balanced, the blue cheese creamy, and all sitting atop slivers of duck prosciutto.  Foie Gras Custard Brulee | Bing Cherries / Toasted Cocoa Nibs / Salted Brioche One of the best mouthfuls of food I've enjoyed in '10. I love foie gras, I love creme brulee, and I can honestly think of nothing better than combining the two. Except perhaps shaving a torchon of foie gras onto it and serving it with a sweet and salty salted brioche. Absolutely craveable and made all the better by the complementary glasses of sauternes paired with it.  Crescenza Cheese Mezzaluna | Grilled Mushrooms / Braised Black Kale / Parsley Emulsion Of the two pasta dishes we tried, this was the stronger although nothing extraordinary. Still, the pasta was pillowy and well made, the mushrooms adding a nice, meaty texture to the dish.  Roasted Sweetbreads | Glazed Bacon / Creamy White Polenta / Marinated Chanterelles I'm a big fan of sweetbreads. The breading on the sweetbreads here was less crispy than I would have liked although the polenta it sat on was very good, having soaked up all the juices of the sweetbreads and bacon. Bacon is one of those things I'm really getting over although, thick cut like this and glazed, it was a welcome addition to the dish.  Maine Lobster Ravioli | Lemon-Olive Oil Puree / Baby Spring Peas / Mascarpone / Fresh Mint This dish was a disappointment. The sauce overpowered the taste of the delicate lobster to the point that I wouldn't have known I was eating lobster if I hadn't read it on the menu. Overall, oversalted and rather leaden.  Smores Remarkably beautiful and satisfying at the same time. Did it remind me of childhood s'mores? I don't know. I didn't grow up here. But the bruleed marshmallow was suitably sweet and sticky and the gingerbread crisp a great savory counterpoint.  To finish the meal, the kitchen sent out cups of hot chocolate infused with citrus. A fun and whimsical way to end the meal and the citrus finish was a nice touch to the chocolate.  So there you have it. Yes, there were a couple of missed steps but whether it was the gorgeous space, the opulent and classy ambiance, the wonderful service or the company of great friends, this meal transcended its faults and was definitely greater than the sum of its parts.  Possibly the meal of the year so far and definitely the dish of the year for the foie gras custard brulee.  For me, Sage is the best bet at CityCenter.  And, as I said, I don't like to gamble.",

    "text": "The Vegas Strip is full of fine dining establishments and other good restaurants, but I have to say that Sage is probably the perfect place to start off the night with a little bit of class. While I'm pretty used to fine dining in NYC, upscale dining in Vegas really is a totally different animal. Everything is brighter, glitzier and more glamorous. And dare I say, more expensive?  If there is one place to get a little fancy while you're in Vegas, however, Sage is the place. First of all, I love its location in the Aria (since I always stay at the Aria now whenever I visit Vegas), which basically makes it a lot more modern and newer than some older restaurants in the other casino hotels.   The bf and I had a reservation for 8pm Friday night, which seemed like the prime time to come. The dining room was lively, yet not overly noisy or crowded at all. The high ceilings and large spacing between the tables also makes for a more romantic setting - which I definitely enjoyed.   Everything we had to eat was delicious and perfectly executed. The famed foie gras custard brulee really is everything it's hyped up to be, a must order. I loved the creamy, almost-whipped texture of the foie custard underneath the sweet brulee shell that was just begging to be cracked with the back of my spoon. The pear mostarda that came atop the custard brulee provided a nice acidity, and left me yearning for more. While the dish is quite dainty, the richness and decadence makes it very shareable; the bf and I were definitely glad we shared it, because with the buttery brioche and foie custard itself, I really don't think either of us could have conquered it alone. The gold pear and shaved brussels sprouts salad I had was great as well, surprisingly hearty and savory with the addition of macadamia nuts and a bacon mustard vinaigrette. Raw brussels can be a little hard to pull off, but I absolutely love it when it's done right - and Sage definitely did it right. Another impressive dish of the night was the braised veal cheeks the bf ordered, served with honey roasted carrots, glazed cippolini onions and smoked polenta. The braised veal cheeks were the most fall-apart tender and buttery piece of meat either of us have ever tasted. So impossibly tender that the bf could have smeared it on toast as meat butter - which I'm afraid he secretly wanted to try at home.   Sage also has an impressive wine selection, and our wonderful server was more than helpful to recommend a nice bottle of red to pair with our meal. Everything from the ambiance, to the food, down to the attentive and genuinely warm service here totally wooed me. I only wish that I hadn't lost money at the casino right outside - so that I could have had a second dinner at Sage instead.",

    "text": "After securing our reservation for a party of 5 on Thankgiving evening, I was very excited to finally get to try Sage.  Talk about deceiving-- from the front, near the Aria lobby, the restaurant looks as if it will be very small and quaint inside. UH, NO. Being led into the main dining area, be prepared to be whisked away into a palatial-style room, complete with high ceilings, pillars, dim lighting, and purple and yellow-gold notes of light characterizing most of the room. I give 5 big stars for the superb ambiance and atmosphere!  TIP: If you consider yourself a True \"foodie,\" this will be your heaven; most, if not all, of our dishes were notably unique (and sometimes \"too\" unique...I'll get to that later).   Service seemed to lag a bit at first, but picked up as the night went on. Bread choices were brought around the room by the waitstaff; that night's options were a sourdough and a country white bread of some sort. While good, it was not very memorable (I tend to obsess about the bread at upper-scale restaurants...love me some carbs!)  Warning/TIP: The chef seems to have some kind of fetish/fixation with gelatin-izing several accompaniments to dishes (and even some dishes as a whole, like our dessert). Here we go.   ::Food::   *Starters: --Sashimi of Yellowtail ($21): Absolutely delectable, melt-in-your-mouth yellowtail. This starter was accompanied with delicious smoked apple puree and some squash. The cons? Baby portions. My dad and I split this item and we each got about two bites of the sashimi.   --Roasted Pumpkin Soup ($16): The best I've ever had at a restaurant. Very simple yet complex flavors (oxymoron, whatever) overcame my senses with every bite. Like other high-class establishments, they first brought out a bowl with just a few pieces of solid food; here, there were mini-raviolis and a scatter of vegetables, I believe. They they proceeded to bring a silver pitcher filled with the soup and filled each bowl. Very nice presentation. Unfortunately, I don't think they have this item anymore (a shame, as it was perhaps the most memorable part).   --Roasted Wild Mushrooms ($21): I mean...it's what you would expect. I, however, am very partial to different varieties of mushrooms and these were fantastic. The dish was complete with pine nuts and a few greens.   *Main Dishes:  --Grilled American Kobe Skirt Steak ($51): PLEASE GET THIS! What a delightful surprise. Our waitress recommended this over the other meat option (NY Strip) with the advice that \"the NY Strip you can get anywhere else, but the skirt steak is unlike anything else you will ever have anywhere else.\" ...Okaaayyy, we're sold. When I first read that it was skirt steak, I was a little skeptical; I've never had much luck with it. This steak was almost like that of a prime bone-in filet: tender, can essentially be cut with a fork, and has loads of flavor like a NY or even ribeye. Once again, the accompaniments were very intriguing, but still tasty. The crispy sweet potato puree was really like little fried balls of smooth sweet potato. The whole table loved them, but there was a spice in it that I wasn't particularly fond of. It also came served with a honey-roasted radicchio and a pecan type of glaze. Bravo on this one, Sage.   --Morro Bay Black Cod ($43): Another stunning winner. I enjoy black cod because of its mild flavor, and this one was no different. So smooth! Tip...if you're with some..er, older citizens who might not be able to chew very well, take the initiative and order them this dish. We seriously didn't even have to chew the fish, it just fell apart and disintegrated in our mouths (okay maybe not that far..but you know what I mean).  Aaaaand, enter the gelatinous food stage. Alongside the fish was a strip of yellow, omelette colored \"gunk\" of sorts. This was our first encounter with the aforementioned gelatin-textured food. This yellow rectangle was a sweet pumpkin puree of sorts, and was actually pretty good. Just an odd texture that confused my taste buds and mouth? In addition, the pancetta gave the fish a nice kick of salt, and don't forget the smoked green grapes! Incredibly unique for such a simple concept.    *Dessert --Gingerbread Cremeux ($12): Strange. Strange. STRANGE. This is really what cemented in my mind the idea of the chef slaving over making every dish have some kind of gelatinous element. THIS WAS ALL GELATINOUS. I know it might sound kind of bratty, but this was just a huge fail, in my opinion. It was like a harder version of shaped pudding, in a ribbon the width of a fettuccine noodle. Uhhh.  Final disappointment: Our family friend and I got their french press coffee at the end (very good coffee), and my mom asked for a small cup because she just wanted to taste it. There was maybe 2 oz. left in the press. They still charged her for the cup ($5!). I'm sorry, but nickle-and-dime-ing a table at a restaurant of this caliber is pathetic.   Overall, Sage is definitely worth a try! Especially for foodies.",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of Chef Shawn McClain, so being able to visit his restaurant within the same hotel that we were staying in was a bonus.    Here's the rundown of our choices:  Wagyu Beef tartar....  Melt in your mouth, stomp your feet, kick your partner under the table good!  The Beet Salad:  roasted red and yellow beets in some sort of slightly acidic vinaigrette with a crisp piece of prosciutto.  One word:  FIERCE  I don't remember what my partner had because I had dived into my dinner and barely remember anything other then really wanting to place my face in the stainless steel bowl and shamelessly lick it clean.  BUT, I had the veal cheeks with the most creamy polenta base and a braised leek with some unknown mushroom variety.  With each bite, I melted and slid lower into my seat.  I don't eat mushrooms.... I've hated them since I was a kid....  but I ate those.  That's right mom....  I ate mushrooms!    A chef's fundamental mantra is for the dish to be a feast for the senses...  Not only was the dish a feast for the senses but so was the location itself....  Everything came together to make it THE most amazing dining experience I've ever had.    THANK YOU!  (By the way, as I was writing this review my mouth started watering as I recalled the experience)",

    "text": "[For the full review with pictures, see the link to my blog on my profile.]  Jet-lagged, hungry and slightly woozy from the putrid fast food odors on the airplane, I arrived at the airport in Las Vegas thirty-five minutes before a 9:15pm (Pacific Time) dinner reservation. With only a carry-on duffel bag I made my way to the tortuous taxi line and waited a few minutes before a good-humored vulgarian would rush me to Aria. Arriving at 9:05, I would thank the driver and make the short walk over to Sage.  One's first fine-dining experience is just that, an experience and nonpareil at that. Every meal thereafter then becomes a matter of grading experiences against themselves. And fairly or not, I decided to compare Sage to Mesa Grill and Daniel Boulud Brasserie, the first dinners on two previous trips to Vegas. Through that lens, Sage dwarfs its competitors.  A bit of background. Sage is helmed by Shawn McClain, a relative nobody in a hotel that hosts Michael Mina, Julian Serrano, Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Masa Takayama. But don't let the limited name recognition fool you, for McClain is a \"Best Chef Midwest\" James Beard-award winner.  With our order for the four-course prix fixe placed, a runner dropped off the the evening's amuse, two tiny pieces of apricot with slivered almond and crispy pancetta. Soon after, another runner approached our table with the bread tray. Two offerings were available: a country bacon and a sourdough with flecks of sea salt embedded in the crust along with Murray River sea salt and room temperature, house-churned butter studded with lavender.  For our first course, we went with one of McClain's signature dishes: a foie gras brulee, which was infused with Grand Marnier, a bing cherry, toasted cocoa nibs, shavings of foie gras torchon and brioche. This is right up there as one of the top-five foie gras dishes it has ever been my privilege to eat! The wine pairing, a 2006 Tokaj, reminded me of a Mott's apple sauce made with Fiji apples, complementing the sweet custard (bear in mind, dear reader, this is my first wine pairing, so my repository on which to draw is barren).  Can one ever really have enough offal? The correct answer is no, so I supplemented the first course with a generous-sized appetizer of crispy sweetbreads, a piece of crispy pork belly, roasted trumpet mushrooms, sauteed spinach, and mascarpone-laced polenta. A polenta described as \"creamy\" was watery, wholly inferior to Scarpetta's in Beverly Hills; the greens, too, went almost entirely untouched. It seems after the kitchen expertly handled the sweetbreads and belly, they relegated the accoutrement to an afterthought.  For the second course, my dining companion was served Maine Dayboat Scallops with braised oxtail, broccoli rabe and wild mushrooms, paired with an oak monster of a 2008 Pinot Noir. Again the greens were underseasoned, but the half of scallop I tried had a lovely caramelized crust--though not quite as nice as the one atop the brulee--and a healthy helping of salt. And I had the Maine lobster-stuffed casoncelli with braised Spring peas and lobster knuckle scattered throughout, paired with a 2007 Chardonnay. I would have been devastated if the kitchen fucked the peas; to their credit, they made love to them. In fact, everything on the plate was properly cooked and well-seasoned, from the al dente pasta to the tender lobster.  The penultimate courses for the evening were (1) a 48-hour braised beef belly with roasted potatoes, onions and rhubarb and (2) an Iberico pork loin, a milk-braised cannelloni of shredded pork shoulder, all of which rested atop asparagus and creminelli mortadella. As for the pairings, there was a 2006 Margaux with some barnyard funk to it for the beef and a Cotes du Rhone for the pork. The balmy 90+ degree temperature outside ought to have swayed me in favor of the leaner pork, yet it was the intensely marbled beef that left me smitten, the reasons for which include its fork tenderness and its ability to tame the aggressively alcoholic wine.  For dessert, we were treated to a terrine (from the bottom layer to the top) of chocolate, blackberry and raspberry cremeux with a blackberry gelee, powdered chocolate and chocolate pudding. Its tartness proved to be a good foil to the richness from the previous courses. And to go with it, a glass of Lillypilly Late Harvest that tasted of starfruit with a hint of florality.  For our last taste of the two-and-a-half hour meal, our server brought us Sage's version of a petite four, a shot of hot chocolate infused with mint, which I sipped happily, content that the first act of our Vegas gourmandizing had delivered.",

    "text": "In one sentence summary, given the price, the food was very disappointing. I would not recommend it to anyone unless I want to set that person back $180 without good food. Now in more details.  The good: - Service was good - Wine was good - Ambience was good Although to be very honest, none of the above is anything to write home about - it's what you expect for a restaurant at this price point. They didn't exactly go above and beyond.  The bad: The food... I went with two other friends. Together, we ordered 3 appetizers and 3 entrees. The main theme of the night was salty and greasy. For example, the grill octopus would have been great had it not been too salty. I can tell the flavor had potential. But that one extra spoon of salt really killed it. The Foie Gras brulee can be a hit or miss for people. If you really like the taste and texture of Foie Gras, then you will be disappointed. You can barely taste the flavor of Foie Gras and the texture is definitely just mousse. I would describe it as Foie Gras flavor infused mousse. (The brioche that came with it was quite tasty but was definitely reeking butter.) My entree was a veal cheek. It's an Asian flavor inspired dish. The whole dish looked like it was soaked in oil and butter, and of course, the ingredient of the night - salt. I could still chalk that up to some people liking rich food or very richly flavored food. However, part of the veal was completely burnt and tasted like cardboard. It was all I could do to not spit it out. Our favorite dish was a plum salad. The plum was very well marinated. But I wouldn't recommend anyone to go there just for a $22 plum salad. :) Finally the dessert. We only ordered one dessert, a peach tart. The portion was very small and yet it was SO bad that we couldn't finish it. We each took a small bite of the tart and couldn't continue. The pastry part was overly sweet with a weird flavor and texture. The peach part was quite dry. The combination of the flavor was even more bizarre.  When it comes to food, it's always to each their own. But at least all three of us collectively thought it wasn't worth going, especially for the price.",

    "text": "Amazing food and service! We had a great waiter and bartender who gave us great recommendations on the menu and drinks. He was also great company without being intrusive either.  We stumbled in here after a long day out on the Strip in dire need of some good food. Collectively, we ordered the octopus salad, yellowtail hamachi with trumpet mushrooms, sugar snap pea & garlic risotto, gnocchi, and day boat scallops. The scallops came highly recommended and were delicious, especially with the salted caramel reduction. It's pretty hard to go wrong with scallops though. The octopus salad and yellowtail crudo were both delicious and light, just what I needed. I coud have definitely eaten another plate of each!  I also got the roasted apple baklava which was just what I needed to top off my meal. The real hit was the absinthe - it was a pretty involved and interesting process... our bartender was awesome about walking us through the steps and ensuring we had a great experience from beginning to end. The drink itself was so-so (not a huge fan of licorice) but the overall experience was very memorable!",

The food was superb, and our group of three was happy with the two Signature Tasting and an entree.  The new space is modern and spacious.  There were many large parties on a Sat night, but the crowd was not noticeable with the well-placed tables and booths.  The only drawback is the service; it was good but needs work.  The waitress should have noted that my rabbit starter and the port entree were similar and suggested a change.  Also, we made a change to the order before she left, and the change was not accurate.

Recently visited the Jean George upstairs and was really disappointed. Yelpers said to try a different server next time but at that price and in Vegas I decided to give Sage a shot. From the moment we sat, Virginia our server was awesome and attentive as she provided a world class service.   There was two chef signature menu's.  We tried both with the wine pairings and started off with market oysters that were some of the best I've ever had. Next came the Wagyu beef tartare that was Amazing but be warned that the slow cooked egg on top of a raw meat with chocolate is not your average dish.  Clearly this was just the start of an amazing evening. We had the scallops and hen egg, yummy. The iberico was crazy good but the beef belly was at the top of the list.  No doubt why this was the Chef signature dish.    We finished off with some amazing desserts and couple extra treats from the chef.  This place is not a place you budget at but you have to experience some amazing food in life, sage is just that.",

    "text": "Wow!  All I can say is, wow!  I've been wanting to try this restaurant since it opened, so when the opportunity came up I  jumped on it.  I had family in town and thought it would be perfect to try a good selection of dishes.  There were four of us and we were seated promptly in the main dining area.  I really liked the decor.  It was hip, modern, and had a nice quaint atmosphere that wasn't too loud, but not too quiet either.  We were approached by our server, who wasn't very inviting and were presented with menus.  She didn't bother going through the menu, nor did she offer us any specials or the tasting menu.  I would've liked the option of a tasting menu.  The waitress seemed rather rushed to get our orders in, I guess we came in towards their closing time, but she didn't offer any suggestions or help with the menu to expedite our ordering.  I asked her what she recommended and she pointed out the octopus and foie gars for appetizers.  I asked her if she could come back in a minute and she left annoyed.    Anyway, we ordered the Ricotta Cavatelli, Braised Waygu, Foie Gras Custard, Spanish Octopus starter, Poached Egg starter and Organic chicken.  She then told us that the chicken would take about 30-45 minutes to prepare.  It was kind of upsetting because my cousin had her heart set on that chicken, and for a dish that requires extra prep time, it should be mandatory they tell us in the beginning.  She could've put her order in the first time she came around.  She ended up going for the lobster ravioli instead.  The food was horrible, to say the least.  Six dishes came out and all was difficult to eat, some more than others.  We left the Waygu, Cavatelli, Foie Grad brulee and octopus uneaten.  The waitress saw this and cleared the plates without asking us how our food was.  She just wanted to get out of there and I could tell while she stared at us from across the room that she was hoping we'd finish fast.  Seriously, service was such a joke.  She was useless, rude, and unhelpful.  I asked her about the portions and she said they were individually portioned out, which was fine.  I just wanted an idea of how much we would order to get a good selection.  To my surprise, the dishes were actually pretty big.  My pasta could've fed two.   THE FOOD: -The Grilled Spanish Octopus (starter) was extremely acidic.  The texture was tough and kinda rubbery.  You couldn't really taste any other ingredient, and the plating was messy.  -Foie Gras Custard Brulee (starter) was ok, it was the best dish out of the six.  I liked the salted brioche it came with.  The texture wasn't like a creme brulee though, it was more like a mousse.  They added some fig and brown butter chestnut, which over powered any taste of the Foie Gras.  It was a really sweet dish, so I felt like we had a dessert for a starter.  -Slow Poached Organic Egg (starter): I didn't try this dish, but my cousin said it was good.  How can you mess up a poached egg though?  -36 Hr. Brasied Waygu was extremely sweet and acidic, as if they braised it in vinegar.  One bite was more than enough, so this dish went to waste.  -Ricotta Cavatelli: They tried to make Spaetzle for this dish, which is a thin pasta, but ended up making it so thick it had the texture of gnocchi.  This extremely thick doughy pasta was the only thing you tasted.  Moreover, it looked like they just took a bunch of ingredients from a fridge and threw it on the plate.  Less is more with this dish, and they over did it.  No one at the table wanted to eat it, so it sat untouched for the duration of our dinner.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND AGAINST THIS DISH.  -Fennel Ravioli w/ Lobster was a joke.  It was pasta, topped with lobster and whatever else it came with.  All of the ingredients were sort of layered and just laid on top of empty ravioli pasta.  My cousin decided to finish the dish, even though she did not like it, because we left so many dishes uneaten already.  Didn't bother with dessert.  At that point we were already pissed at how much money we threw away to this restaurant, and our server just sucked.  I believed all the hype that came with this restaurant and was extremely disappointed.  I will not go back, and will not recommend it to anyone.  I want to think I came on a bad night, too close to closing time, but the quality of the food and service is not worth the $30-50pp price mark.  Also, they shouldn't be taking tables an hour and a half prior to them closing if they are going to end up rushing you out.  I really want to come back and give this place another try, but my experience was just flat out horrible.    I did like the bread they offered, lol.",

    "text": "After a lot of research, we (brother, cousin, me) chose this as our fine dining restaurant of the trip. The ambience is fantastic - dark, comfy seating, great decor.  Service was excellent. When I didn't like the drink I ordered, the server let me taste something else before pouring. Every course was explained and questions asked to the chef and answered (my brother is in culinary school and had a few questions). The timing was perfect - not too fast or slow.  The food was amazing. My brother and cousin ordered the 4 course tasting menu and I had the 6 course chef's menu. We shared each course which was perfectly prepared, presented and sized.  They have an absinthe cart that we did not sample, but it looked interesting.   I would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant or eat there again the next time I'm in Las Vegas!",

    "text": "Restaurant Week was cut short for us this time, because I was traveling to Chicago. We snuck in one more dinner beforehand at Sage. It is also one of our favorite restaurants so we knew it would not disappoint. Sage is great on many levels, but one thing that sets it apart from others is its beer menu. They always have a great selection and a few rare choices on draft. One day, I'm determined to come hungry enough to try the tasting menu with beer pairings.   On this day, though, the husband had a German beer, Schneider Weisse, and I had St. Feuillien Saison from Belgium. Both were delicious! Already off to great start, we welcomed the choice of bacon or baguette rolls. The baguette is my favorite. And we were brought an amuse bouche of lamb tartare. Yum! What a scrumptious little bite. While we intended to both choose items from the Restaurant Week menu, the husband opted to order off the menu so he could enjoy some favorites. My three courses for $50.13 included Chilled Sweet Corn Soup, Sea Scallops and Funnel Cake. He ordered Sweetbreads ($17) and the NY Strip Steak ($54).   The soup was silky and smooth with chunks of delicate Dungeness crab. Huitlacoche was also part of this dish. It's not something I was familiar with, which is part of the fun at Sage. It always introduces me to something new. It's fungus that grows on corn, it's not common in the US, but in Mexico it is treated like a delicacy. Like we would consider truffles to be. His sweetbreads were amazing, just like the first time we had them at Sage for my birthday dinner. I was fortunate that he shared. He must love me.  His steak was beautifully prepared; a perfect medium-rare and it was piled high with mushrooms. Accompanied with a side buttery mashed potatoes. My scallops had a lovely sear and on the side was a lovely medley with sweetness from grapes, smoky saltiness from the bacon and the earthiness of the chanterelles.   We wrapped up this outstanding meal with funnel cake laced with strawberries and malted ice cream. It was a fantastic version of the carnival classic. Service was once again exceptional. They do it right at Sage. I hope it stays put for a good long time.",

    "text": "Sage - you will find it tucked neatly and quietly into a corner of Aria, dwarfed by other restaurants, but you need to go here to treat yourself to a delectable meal.  Ambiance - typical of Strip restaurant venue, but with a touch of old-school, almost speak-easy look with large dated paintings on the wall and antique lamp shades next to the tables. All the touches were there, including variations in plating, quirky silverware, and impeccable service by the waiter and busser.  Bread service offered a brioche roll and a cheddar-bacon roll, along with an herbed, very creamy, spreadable butter, and accompanying salt (from Australia we were told).  $89 Tasting Menu - of which my friend and I ordered off of, each ordering a different item, and we shared a majority of the food between the two of us.  Wagyu Beef Tartare: A serenade of flavors with a cracked egg on top and served with crusty bread. Salty, but savory and an obvious taste of carefully cured meat.   Foie Gras Custard Brulee: Not exactly my favorite dish of the night. Crackled top offered too much bitterness with only a hint of sweet, paired with also bitter kumquats - this dish just did not have a medley of flavors that would be expected.   Grilled Spanish Octopus: A gorgeously plated dish with served along with Chorizo aioili and a textural surprise - Marcona almonds! All in all a taste festival in your mouth.  Maine Day Boat Scallops: Nothing wrong with large succulent scallops. Bathe them in the sauce that comes in the dish, and add some of the oxtail for best flavor combination.   Bacon-Wrapped Iberico Pork Loin: Rich and almost sinfully delightful pork belly is served along with the loin, which Is nothing like you will find outside of an establishment like Sage - or perhaps Spain if you'd like to travel there to have some piggy delightfulness.  48 Hour Beef Belly: Never mind the pork belly, this beef belly was so rich I could barely finish the portion I was given. Not to say it was not good - it was definitely more than good, and combined with the sweet onion and crunchy root vegetables you can't go wrong.  Meyer-Lemon Cheesecake: Probably the least strong of everything I ate. Just too many flavors and too much going on with this dessert to truly enjoy it.  Foie Gras Candy Bar (ordered outside of the tasting menu, but only $20) - Melt in your mouth creamy peanut butter and foie awaits you encased in a chocolate milk bar, topped with a dusting of gold and crunchy popcorn. Once you cut into it, the caramel oozes out and you pretty much die and go to heaven. The end.  Just kidding, we also ended out meal with a selection of teas - I had a pomegranate that was flavorful and refreshing, and lastly we were presented with a \"shot\" of hot chocolate flavored with rosemary - a surisingly lovely combination of flavors.   Highly recommended. Foodie must list. I will be back.",

    "text": "Came here as part of my birthday dinner.  Located within Aria, Sage is one of the higher end restaurants in the plethora of fine dining establishments in Las Vegas. The decor of this restaurant creates a more intimate, private, dining environment where lights are dimmed and the decor is very Vegas-esque in that it is grand, and clean.  The Sage menu is well-balanced with a selection of meat dishes, appetizers, and fish. If you are coming from CA like me, there are some foie gras dishes you may partake in ordering. As we had a long night ahead of us, and loved the selections on the 4 course meal, we both settled for that.   Course #1: Beef tartare: This was the BEST beef tartare I've ever had. Hands down, delicious including the warm, crunchy, bread it was served with. If you enjoy a good beef tartare, this is a must. I also tried some of my girlfriend's foie gras creme brulee, which in my opinion was too sweet and funny tasting for my liking.   Course #2: Maine Scallops: The scallops weren't the best I've had but the overall dish was good. All-in-all, a decent dish.  Course #3: Australian Wagyu Sirloin: A fancy name for a dish that basically boils down to just being sirloin cuts serves with a fioe gras with creamy potatoes. The beef itself had great flavor and tenderness to it (cooked just how I asked), however I was a little put off by the foie gras. It mixed in with my potatoes and didn't taste like a great combo. I tried the 48-hour beef belly which although flavorful, felt a bit dry (overcooked).  Course #4: We finished off our meal with the Milk Chocolate Cremeux. Normally, I don't enjoy sweets but this one was delicious. The Milk chocolate was extremely rich and came with a small scoop of ice cream to help blend the taste. We also had a Nut cake with caramel shavings which, when eaten together, had great flavors but wasn't all there texture wise.  Service here was good, but I felt it could have definitely been better. The pace of the meal though we both went with the 4 course meal was slow, and we were sitting in between each course. Admittedly, the service and pace account for the lost star. The meal all in all was pretty expensive and given its price and the different caliber of restaurants I've eaten at for that price, it probably wasn't worth it, but then again it is Vegas and I still enjoyed my birthday.",

As for the quality and value of their NY strip steak and Yellow-tail appetizer, I gave this place 2 stars (experienced much better).  Where this restaurant shines is in their sauces.  I found the dishes flavorful but the dishes lacked proper execution. The NY strip steak ($54) that I ordered was well seasoned from the bone marrow but was served lukewarm and it was not seared enough to give it that nice charred flavor and texture. And the la ratte potato had the texture of thick glue/paste - which made it unappetizing for me.   As for the yellow-tail appetizer ($22), it was thinly sliced and there were maybe only 2 ounce of fish (see pic).  One word to describe this dish would be - overpriced!!  If you are going to charge more for your food, at least train your staff to provide better service.  With so many better quality and value and excellent service restaurants in Las Vegas, I would not return nor recommend this restaurant to anyone.

    "text": "The short version:  Sage was good, just not spectacular.   Vegetarians will be challenged to find enough to eat and even more challenged to find something worth the $100 (per person) meal tab....  The long version:  We had a party of 8 for a family member's 50th birthday party.  We were staying in the Aria so this was a big deal for us.  I called a couple of days ahead to confirm that they could accommodate the birthday boy: a vegetarian.  I was told \"no problem\" essentially.  in fact they said that he could ask for anything he wanted and the chef would make it if they had the ingredients in the kitchen.  This sounded great, so we went with Sage for our party.  Flash forward to the birthday celebration and when I arrived, I spoke to the hostess to remind them what they'd told me, that the birthday honoree would be asking for something off the menu.  Suddenly they changed their tune - we can't just make him anything....  This wasn't really what I'd hoped for for the vegetarian guest of honor of an 8-person meal that would likely cost over $1,000.  Sage had little on the menu that was vegetarian friendly and it wasn't what was described when I booked the party.  Anyway, everyone ordered some kind of starter or salad and an entree.  I asked our server if their asparagus salad had any greens on it, was it an actual \"salad.\"  She said 'no' it was just asparagus and egg.  Since there wasn't any kind of \"salad\" starter, I asked for a mixed green salad, same as the birthday boy was getting.  It was wholly uninspired.  Just one type of baby lettuce tossed with a vinaigrette.  And to my disappointment I saw someone else getting the asparagus salad and turns out it *was* a salad with greens - arugula I believe.  Our server wasn't completely familiar with the menu apparently...  Next was the \"amuse bouche\" which is cool that they brought it out.  However, the 3 vegetarians at our table got a scrap of blood orange with a sprig of fennel on it.  Essentially it was a stripped down version of what the meat eaters got.  But frankly, again, for a $1,000 meal this seemed like a lame compromise/accommodation.  What kind of mouth amusement was a scrap of orange with a pinch of fennel? I was starting to see a trend here.  I don't think Sage's chef or staff really respect vegetarians.  Sure, they'll accommodate them, but it's a lackluster accommodation - uninspired, perhaps almost begrudging.  I will say our meals, those who weren't eating vegetarian were very good.  The honoree, the vegetarian, got the crab ravioli without the crab, which was basically 1 of only 2 options available to him and suggested by our server as the better choice.   But guess what?  He got a few ravioli in a bowl - 5 maybe, and they were EMPTY.  Just 5 little squares of pasta in a cream sauce.  What kind of entree is that?  Nothing else substantial was added to the plate to bulk it up for him.  So, for his meal, a man at his 50th birthday party, the best Sage could do was give him a plate of plain lettuce tossed in vinagrette and 5 EMPTY ravioli in a cream sauce.  The guest of honor was treated like an afterthought, a second class citizen.  It's clear Sage is biased against vegetarian diners and makes little effort to give them exciting options.  That'd be OK if it weren't for the fact that I called ahead of time and was told otherwise.    So, bottom line, vegetarians are better off skipping Sage.  For the rest of you, I'd say Sage is good but not THAT good.  As far as the atmosphere - much hoopla on the web about how cool the restaurant is and how great the ambiance is.  It's just a lot of hype.  Sage is a basic rectangular room with some curtains and mirrored type gold against the walls and not much more.  Some sampled blow up French impressionistic artwork graces small portions of the restaurant but it actually gives it a cheap feel, not a fancy one.  The decor is tame and uninspired.  To call it \"Minimalist\" would be kind.  Not much atmosphere to speak of except slightly dimmed lights.",

    "text": "For a birthday in Las Vegas, we decided to try out something new, the Sage restaurant in Aria Hotel. We're glad we did!  First, Sage is a beautiful space filled with beautiful people. Mostly 20-somethings and 30-somethings in the bar, which was hopping by 8:00pm. The restaurant is all dark and elegant.   The food is mostly deserving of its Zagat rating and local praise. The highlights were: braised beef short rib, which had a marvelous demi glace and garnished with roasted parsnips and carrots. Delicious! The scallops were enormous and wonderful.  Less successful was the duck breast, which was chewy. And the fish of the night was unspectacular. You do better with meats here.  Desserts are good, but get ready for tiny portions. Apple fritters were very small fritter bits scattered with a small amount of apple. The purple sweet potatoe pie with charred marshmallow was delicious, but again, the tiny wedge of pie could fit in a toddler's hand. For $12-15, you'd think you were getting desserts that are sharable!  As others have mentioned, service was erratic. Our waiter was professional enough, but he seemed to have too many tables, even some very far away -- why not delegate sections for waiters? Even with different assistant waiters and water boys, we still had to wait quite a bit. We ordered absinthe with our desserts, and it was completely forgotten. Then we had to ask to have it removed from the bill. Little things like that take away from the experience.",

Since we were there without child, we decided to go on a culinary adventure and, instead of dining at one restaurant, we opted to get a couple of dishes at 3 restaurants.   It certainly isn't a good way to go as far as cost since it's a much more expensive endeavor, but seeing as I luckily won $1300 the night before, I didn't really give a damn about the cost.  We started our dining experience at Sage, where we sat at the bar.   Aaron Baca, the bartender or mixologist if you prefer, guided us through the menu and made a couple of spectacular Woodford Reserve Manhattans for my wife.   We opted to go with the oysters first and Mr. Baca highly recommended the Foie Gras Creme Brulee.  Oh. My. God.   Both my wife and I were speechless.   The Creme Brulee was simply fucking divine.   Pure ambrosia, there's no other way to say it.     If you're in Vegas and are looking for a good place to eat, you simply must try Sage.   Service and food are both impeccable.",

    "text": "Another visit at Sage in my last Vegas trip.   This time we just ordered from their regular menu. I tried their Foie Gras Creme Brulee served with salted brioche, entered the second course with Veal Cheeks with Candied Carrots and Creamy Polenta, ended the meal with Coconut Key Lime Float.  They changed the bar menu to iPads for easier surfing, you can see the actual image of the drinks without having to search through tons of pages of pictures on Yelp. Another great experience here beginning with our server who's named Bond. Such a humorous guy who told us he's a secret agent (whoops, not so secretive anymore!)  Anyway, finally tried their famous Foie Gras Creme Brulee. It's a very rich starter, slightly offset by the strawberry jam dabbed in the center, scoop a spoonful onto the fluffy brioche, and what you have there is a mouthgasm. Basically you have a little bit of everything, savory fragrant foie gras, salty and buttery brioche, and a tad tarty sweet balance. I must say, I should have ordered a lighter entree because it was quite a heavy appetizer.   Next came my mini pot of veal cheeks. Veal cheeks were made correctly, very soft and tender in each bite. Fatty pieces? Why of course! That's the best part of tender meat. I am not the biggest carrot fan nor sweets, I must admit that I was picking at the carrots. They served their part flavoring the sauce and making the polenta less bland. It might be just me, but I could barely finish half of this plate after the foie gras brulee. A bit too much flavors going on that made this dish less appealing, mistake on my part.  And then entered my funny server. He handed the menu to me saying that he knows exactly what I want. Unfortunately points at another heavy piece of dessert, Gianduja Pave. I could handle it a year ago, but not this time, I opted for the Coconut Key Lime Float, something to cleanse my palette and something light. Not a disappointment at all! when my dessert came, I was like \"oh cool, a sorbet in a glass cup set on top of a bowl of ice. NBD\" Then comes the fun part, like the experiment of dry ice. The foam for the float was a tequila based soda. It looked like I had a white volcano for dessert. I had the next table wanting to take pictures of my dessert. And if you want to order this, be sure to have your camera ready, the foam sinks in so quickly, your newest phone might not load fast enough for it. As expected, very light in the tequila taste, each scoop of gelato has very well defined flavors. I wouldn't suggest eating either of it alone. Maybe you can for the coconut, but the lime is darn tarty by itself!",

    "text": "Beautiful restaurant, great food, and company make a memorable experience. The interior of Sage has ageless attention to detail. Reservations are always hard to get when you're in town and if it's last minute at some of the fancier restaurants. It was a Sunday and didn't find trouble dining here but it later in the evening that worked with our schedule.  The drink menu at Sage is quite extensive with a great selection of absinthe and high end spirits. We ordered a few drinks. I don't recall exact names but each had high quality ingredients. Our party all ordered from the chef's 4 course tasting menu and was shared from each other. The waiter brought out warm rolls with an herb butter. To our surprise, the waiter brought out a spoonful of tuna tartare from the chef for our tasting which was quite good. From the chef's signature menu, we ordered wagyu beef tartare, foie gras custard brulee, grilled baby octopus, main day boat scallops, 48 hr beef belly, Snake River Farms flat iron, bacon wrapped Iberico pork loin.  Every dish was superb.  For dessert, we chose the milk chocolate and early grey panna cotta with madeleines, blackberry scalded milk gelato and ricotta cheesecake with smoked graham crumbs white chocolate pearls and blueberry basil gel. These desserts were good and different. Honestly, a bit too complicated for me. I'd rather same something simple.  Aside from the food, the service was great. As mentioned, we had a later reservation and we were there way past closing time along with two other parties and the staff was still accommodating.",

We had show reservations and made the restaurant reservations two months prior and they were 40 minutes late on seating our party. Then the waiter was throwing lots of shade and being extremely slow which made us almost miss our show . I was only able to get one round of drinks, they never came around again. They we slow in clearing dishes which made subsequent course delivery difficult.    I do not recommend this restaurant.",

There was a short wait, maybe 15 minutes despite having reservations but the bar staff are friendly and it was entertaining to watch them concoct the fancy drinks. Food was outstanding!  The veal cheeks were like butter. Service is outstanding and the waiter even went to ask the chef what one ingredient was in my meal that I loved but could not place (dehydrated sauerkraut, who knew?). Ambience is lovely, not too dark not too bright and reasonably quiet at least when we were there. We would absolutely return. Reservations HIGHLY recommended especially during a busy season or if there is a big convention in town.",

    "text": "This review is long overdue, but it's here! I went here with my boyfriend and my friend for her birthday. She ordered the tasting menu with her choices of the scallops, sirloin, and I forgot what dessert she got. I ordered the foie gras creme brulee and beef tartare for an appetizer. I can't forget how amazing the foie gras tasted. I love foie gras and creme brulee, I would've never imagined how perfect a marriage between them would be. The salted brioche that it came with was soft with a slight crunch. I definitely had to ask for extras. The beef tartare was super refreshing. My boyfriend loved this one and ate most of it haha.   For the main course I ordered the rabbit and my boyfriend had the Kobe Skirt. I ordered the rabbit because I never had it before and I was just like, \"okay I'll try it!\" The rabbit dish was super interesting because they cooked it in three different ways. Eating the three different textures of the meat was a new experience. I loved the fried one the most because it was crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside. The flavor was amazing and everything was cooked perfectly . I was lucky enough to take a bite of the Kobe skirt steak that my boyfriend ordered, and that was also very delicious!   For dessert I had the banana cake. The presentation was beautiful. They also gave us a small complimentary dessert after which was lavender milk. That was tasty, I loved it.",

    "text": "We've stayed at the Aria numerous times, but this was the first time we tried Sage. It was our anniversary weekend so we decided to splurge a bit and take a chance on this restaurant. Perhaps it was also that model on the \"Aria channel\" subliminally telling us about James Beard award winning chef Shawn McClain over and over again too..  Cocktails-wise, I totally spaced that Sage has a wide array of absinthes. We enjoyed a couple of Old Fashioneds and a Smoking Bulleit - both bourbon fare. Big surprise on our part since we always default back to whiskey and bourbon. These drinks were done really well!   I could not decide what to eat since a lot of the menu sounded good. I went with the $89 tasting menu from which I chose:  Fois Gras Custard Brulee served with a salted brioche - a desert like fois gras mix of sweet and salty with a custard texture but crispy Creme brulee top. Sensory overload of satisfying goodness!  Maine Day Boat Scallops - the braised oxtail with salted caramel reduction and wild mushrooms dressed these scallops to the nines. Scallops are scallops - typical everyone's reliable favorite but the sauce and wild shrooms with oxtail made them stand out  Snake River Farms Flat Iron - cooked to perfection and bathed in red wine Bernaise sauce and the creamy potato puree was an excellent side kick  Dark Chocolate Panna Cotta with Red Velvet Sponge Cake - I'm not typically a dark chocolate fan but this was ridiculously good. I am reluctant to say so because of course dark chocolate is typically rich and amazing to everyone but this dessert capped the end to the tasting menu with flawless disregard. Yes, the sponge cake was velvety and airy!   My hubby ordered: Waygu Beef Tartare - with crispy chocolate, slow poached egg and crushed capers - this appetizer killed the flavor senses. The taste buds were given no mercy. Loved this!  Braised Veal Cheeks - tender, succulent, rich!  Service? As expected, our waiter and his accompanying staff were consistently helpful even though they were super busy Friday night but not over bearing. We were really pleased with our overall experience. The atmosphere was lively and the music was a slow but progressive electronic pulse that kept an energetic setting for the contemporary American dishes set before us.",

Did not do wine pairings. Extensive wine list with standard Vegas mark-up. Sommelier was very helpful and he was up to the challenges we posed him (10 people with varying levels of wine snobbery). Would recommend the Paul Hobbs Pinot / Frank Family Cabernet / Tamber Bey Cabernet. Suggest sitting in main dining room if going for romantic dinner.",

Each table has a black vase centerpiece with yellow tulips.  The color theme of the restaurant is gold, black, and purple.   ::Drinks:: I got the Pink Cashmere from the Sage Signature Cocktails Menu. It has Grey Goose Cherry Noir, White Cranberry Juice, Lime Juice, and Cotton Candy. This drink is so cute and fun. First I got a martini glass filled with pink cotton candy.  Then the contents of martini shaker were slowly poured over the cotton candy.  I watched the cotton candy disappear and turned into my drink.  I posted a video on it if you want to see it in action.

It also came with Pink Australian Sea Salt, it went well with the butter.  The bread was warm but over toasted.  Then we each got tuna tartare amuse bouche which was served on a tasting spoon.  I liked it, the portion was perfect. I got the Chef Mcclain's Signature Tasting Menu which it includes four courses.  For each course, you choose which dish you want.  For the First Course, I got the Foie Gras Custard Brulee.  It also came with a warm and buttery roll.  I never had this dish before, it was rich and creamy. The second Course is the Grilled Spanish Octopus.  It had a lot of different flavors mixed together; I liked it.  Next one is the Third Course.  I choose the 48 Hour Beef Belly.  It was tender and had the smoked flavor.

I read from other reviews that reservations are hard to get but I had no problem and the place was not overly crowded.   Upon entering you walk through a large bar area into the main dining area.    The wine menu was large and should be able to accommodate anyone's taste.   I had the wagyu beef tartar with a poached egg and chocolate for an appetizer.  It was great.  A great combination of flavors.    I had the wagyu beef short rib for my dinner.  It was great, just great.  My complaint was the potato swirl that accompanied it.  It was rock hard like it had been reheated 5 times and passed from plate to plate.   Come on, you can make an incredible meal but pay no attention to the potato.  Leave it off the plate for that matter. I could have thrown it at a mirror and broke the mirror.   For dessert I had the dark chocolate panna cotta. Very good.    Overall it was a great experience with super friendly service and smiles.  I loved the atmosphere. I would recommend it to friends.   P.S.  For the love of God, do something about that stupid potato.",

    "text": "Sage restaurant is located within close proximity of the check-in at the Aria Resort and Casino lobby level. Due to the volume of high quality 4 to 5-star restaurants at the Aria, this restaurant could be overlooked once you check in to your room at the hotel as it is situated in the hotel lobby, and not alongside the other restaurants on the casino floor or the second level of restaurant row. I did not notice this place until we were looking for a place to hang out for late night cocktails the same night several of us were also flying out! Sage is located next to the Lobby Bar tucked away in the corner. There are ample parking at the Aria hotel parking lot by either valet or self-park.  From the moment you are fronting this restaurant, just standing there, peeking inside, you already know this is a beautiful, classy, upscale and elegant restaurant! I believe most or all of the men were wearing coats/jackets! Luckily for me, I never entertain in Vegas without a jacket! An added emphasis as you enter the restaurant are those three pillars of glass as high as the ceiling which houses a nice selection of wine to compliment your dining pleasure!  Although we were there for only cocktails (we had dinner earlier in the evening elsewhere), I would have loved to take a peek at the menu! Just the ambiance and vibe of the place gives you the relaxed feel of a high class restaurant! With the exception of the bar area, most of Sage is dimly lit or candle lit, which gives you a more intimate and/or romantic setting if you are hanging out with that special someone!   I will definitely make a return visit to Sage, but the next time it will be to experience dinner! I am already looking forward to my next Vegas trip, and I am already looking to update this review with a complete, full review! :)",

Surprisingly, the pea soup was the absolute best course on the menu. The eggplant was extremely over cooked and mushy, but the flavor made up for the bad timing of the dish.  There was a mix up with the last course, but the restaurants manager kept us informed and took care of that part of the bill.  The service is wonderful and it's just a great place to splurge for dinner.",

    "text": "We were SO NOT impressed with this restaurant, NOT at all! It wasn't bad, but for an upscale restaurant at Aria, it was just NOT good enough!   Beautiful restaurant for sure, it was nearly empty on a Saturday night, not a good sign. Got seated at a comfy and intimate booth, very romantic indeed. Brought our own Perrier Nuit Blanche, corkage was $35 too. Took a moment to look through the menu, our server introduced the chef's tasting menu, but I don't eat meat so we can't order that. They have vegetarian and vegan tasting menus too.   Starters: Garlic soup with prawn, the best dish of the entire meal, very nice garlic flavor, not too light or too strong, tender and fresh prawn, so good!   Dozen of Vancouver island Kushi oysters: fairly fresh, the housemade sauce was a little bland, had to ask for tabasco, tasted better with hot sauce though.   Romaine greens with parmesan cheese, my salad never came, so I asked to pack it to go, but didn't eat it when we got back, so it was a waste because they forgot about my salad.   Entrees: American kobe skirt steak in rare plus: it was not rare enough for hubby, he liked the flavors alright, was not mind blowing at all.   Pacific red snapper with veggie stock: server said this was a popular dish, OK... The fish was completely flavorless, the veggies in it were a little too raw for my taste, it tasted like grass to me, or was it the veggie broth? But the fish was very fresh and tender, just extremely bland! This dish FAILED!   We weren't interested in our entrees, didn't want desserts either, just asked them to pack everything, including our unfinished Champagne, I have to say that I had high expectations for this restaurant because of the high ratings on yelp, and the major advertisement of fine dining at Aria hotel. It was a HUGE disappointment!   The service didn't meet my expectation either, our server wasn't attentive or friendly enough, there were a few staffs served us, they all looked dull to me for some reason, or probably we finished our meal too fast that they didn't have time to check on us.    I don't think we will ever be back for Sage, this restaurant didn't work for us, just one of those high yelp rating restaurants fell short I guess, it happens sometime.  THE worst dining experience in Vegas!",

    "text": "Dont get me wrong, i love seeing my man in a nice suit and being treated like a princess. But sometimes fine dining servers just take it a little too seriously. I mean just because we're all dressed up and dropping some big faces on foam soup and mushroom dust doesn't mean we can't crack a smile, does it?! We're in Vegas people!!! I plan on drinking wayyy too much and spending a mortgage worth on a purse at Crystals when I'm done TYSM. ; )   The restaurant itself is gorgeous. It has a nice, sexy vibe. The music is perfect and the lighting is just right. Cocktails were hand crafted by the bar and amazing. Aria has some of the best \"made for you on the fly\" cocktails anywhere.   I've read other reviewers talking about the pricing, I don't know about you but I can rack up a $200 bill at Cheesecake factory real quick..but usually with restaurants like these you get quality drinks so you need less and decadent, rich food that you can hardly eat a whole dish. Although the plates are typical fine dining saucers...either way the food was legit. Pretty complex flavors, very inventive dishes. Definite fine dining farm to table concept. But some of these dishes just arent my thing. I hate fois gras. Shoot me! The pork dish was one of the best parts and I enjoyed my night for sure. However I think if the bartenders could make some of the servers the drinks they made me, we would all have had a better time.",

No complaints on the filet. Cod was good but the rest of the entree was flavorless. The flat iron steak was ordered medium well and came out red and was medium to medium rare. It was sent back and returned with half medium well and the other half medium and red. The steak was served sliced so not like the middle needed to be a problem and was visibly undercooked.  I ate half in lieu of sending back a third time and being the only one eating while the others were finished. I mentioned to the server, showing him the remainder on the plate and he stated it is difficult to get a steak cooked at the right temperature all the way through. I have been ordering med well for the better of 30 years.   I specifically ordered the flat iron as opposed to the filet due to difficulty in cooking med well. I know chefs do not like to \"overcook\" steak but I am the one paying for it and eating it.  I mean I am not at outback-a $50 steak should be better than subpar.  Skipped dessert as the selections were not appealing.  Don't waste your time here and spend your money at Andrea's, Nobu or Michael's Gourmet Room.",

Already feeling a little aggravated,  we went to the bar.  Paid 96 dollars for 4 drinks! Got seated. Waited a long time for waiter to come with menus,  even though it was a fixed price tasting menu.  Got free champagne. First course was caviar with lobster essence.  Very salty.  Second course was crab. A lot going on.  Too many flavors. Third course,  foie gras with salted brioche. Meh. Then the long wait...30 minutes until the 4th course arrived.  Risotto was ok.  Pumpkin seeds were an afterthought.  Bland. Mushy. Fifth course... scallops.  So salty that no one could finish the dish.  So so so bad. At this point, we have been in the restaurant for over 2 hours and are afraid of missing the fireworks on the strip.  Asked for our last 2 dishes to go.  Waiter looked perplexed.  Manager comped us one person's price,  which was nice.  People all over the restaurant were leaving early after having similar experiences. Really wish it would have gone differently.",

My colleagues have always recommended Sage, but I hadn't been myself. I was seriously missing out!  Sage blew me away, from the friendly and welcoming hostesses, to the live classical covers of classic rock songs, to our AMAZING server, John. John inquired about any food allergies, which was wonderful because my cousin does have an allergy. He was extremely familiar with each dish and was able to keep up with my extremely inquisitive family. He made great recommendations, the pork was unreal and I order the scallops which were prepared perfectly.   Their menu is small, compared to other places, but I didn't feel like it was lacking in any regard.   The cocktail list is comprehensive and truly well-crafted. It guides you in choosing the right beverage that compliments you meal, which was a great touch. If you want to treat yourself to a very unique experience, order \"The Flask\".   Thank you, John for providing my family with one of our best dining experiences. The thing is, you can dine at a great restaurant, spend a few hundred dollars and feel like it wasn't worth it because of poor service... John absolutely emulated what it means to be a server at a fine dining establishment.   Thank you for all you do. It makes all of the difference when an employee seems to love their job.  Also- thank you for chasing me down and hand delivering my purse which I so carelessly forgot. (Three glasses of wine has that affect on me).  Caroline",

    "text": "This review may be a little different than most. A few years ago I won an insane live auction item at a local Las Vegas charity - dinner for 20 people, in home, with Chef Shawn McClain.    The night of the event, after some preparation with then restaurant manager Robert Nikodem, 8 people from the Sage team ascended on our home and created an evening that we would never forget. Among the team was Chef Richard Camarota.   Besides the food, service, presentation, and absolute surealness of what was going on in my home, one thing that stuck with me was how family oriented the entire team was with their interactions. They held regard for each other. They were down to Earth, genuine people, despite Chef McClain's celebrity and accolades.   That's the set up to my review of finally getting to dine at Sage April 18, 2018 - over two years after the magical evening at my home with Chef McClain, Chef Camarota, Robert and the rest of the team.   I had some dear friends in town. They come to Vegas fairly regularly. We were planning to go to dinner and ran into the conundrum... there are literally hundreds of excellent, unique, remarkable restaurants on the resort corridor... how do you pick???   I used the opportunity to recommend Sage and my friends happily agreed. The cool part was I texted Chef Richard to let him know we were going so I could say hello if he was on property. He was so gracious. He replied he was out of town but would let his team know we were coming. I didn't expect anything more to be honest.   Once again - the Sage team created an unforgettable evening. Part of it, admittedly, was deliberate in that they sent out amuse-bouche and Gerard Bertrand Cremant De Limoux Rose as compliments. The rest of though was a statement of this venues excellence in every category.   Let's start with service. If you find yourself at Sage, you would be well advised to request to sit in Virginia's section. She was elegant offering the perfect amount of presence through the duration of the evening. Virginia explained the menu and advocated appropriate starters, entrees and deserts.   The atmosphere was gorgeous. The music was present but not overbearing.   I really don't want, or need, to comment on the specific food options because this review is long enough and others on here have done so in much more detail. I will say I ordered the scallops as my entree and they were perfect. No other way to describe them.   What I would like to end with was a final observation.   As we prepared to leave Virginia made a comment that stuck with me. In our saying goodbye's and thank you's, Virginia said, \"if you talk to Richard please tell him we miss having him here.\"   Virginia didn't have to say that. But she did.   I mention that because, with the hundreds of excellent dining options in Las Vegas that you just can't go wrong with, if you want to choose a venue that is family oriented, where the people in the organization matter, and they express a regard for one another both up and down the hierarchy... then Sage is a one of a kind!   I hope you enjoy!",

My 13 year old son found it amazing, but I am a chef so he has quite an extended palette. The food is always great, well developed flavors, perfectly cooked, and great staff. From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave it outstanding. I can't wait to keep coming back. I want to shout out to lip smacking foodie tours for introducing me to this and many other fantastic Vegas restaurants. Sage is great and keep up the out of this world food and staff.",

    "text": "This place is my absolute favorite place to eat on the strip of all time. It is a little pricey, so I must save it for special occasions.  Start your night off with the bubbles drink. If you're a guy, you may not like it, but it is definitely a girls night out dream drink. Champagne with vodka and little bobas. I always have two.  Next, order the hamachi crudo salad. Actually, just order two, because you won't want to share. The fish is perfectly paired with a salad and dressing that I can't even begin to describe. My boyfriend and I used to order the heirloom carrot salad alongside this but they discontinued it. Hopefully they'll bring it back!  For the main dish I highly recommend the venison, shortrib, and any of the fish dishes. So basically, I recommend everything. The chicken and pork are also stellar, just not my cup of tea.   My only complaint is they used to have awesome housemade breads like bacon and cheese and chive, and now all they have is a lame storebought tasting sourdough.   Overall I love this place and will be back!!",

The prices are exorbitant and ridiculous. A bottle of Dom will run you $1000 when on the strip other places were charging half that. The drinks were amazing but we had a wait time on those too. Our waitress kept apologizing for the wait through out the service which we thought was awkward. It was like they knew other tables had priorities and could care less about ours. The food was good but bad service can leave a funky taste in your mouth. The ambience was a little stuffy but the decor is beautiful. Wish we could have had a better experience but glad we check this off our list of Vegas eateries.",

    "text": "Sage - is hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. The style of the restaurant and the attention to detail are some of the highlights that keep me going back. I love the rooms there and have always loved the food. It's eclectic and modern, with such a beautiful classic feel to everything they do.   The food is the creation of Chef Shawn McClain. He's man behind the 'Five50 Pizza Bar' also at Aria, and now 'Libertine Social' at Mandalay Bay. Truly an artist.  The tasting menu at Sage is seasonal and every bit delicious. On our most recent trip - we decided to choose from the al a carte menu. It's filled with items that are just too good! We enjoyed beautiful cheese selections, excellent lamb paperdelle and spectacular flavors like the seabass with a pistachio aioli, blood orange puree and watermelon radish. Just too good.   If you get a chance - and please make it available to yourself - get over to Sage and enjoy one of the best meals around.   Happy Eating !   If you're feeling like something decadent and  delicious- the FOIE GRAS candy bar with salted caramel and caramel popcorn, is a fantastic treat.",

The other thing worth mentioning is the fact they change their menu every 2 weeks here! A lot of the new modern restaurants now do that which is impressive as the chef has to constantly think what to put on his new menu. The only downside of this is that I wanted the corn chowder previously pictured on their Yelp and is no longer offered. Wish they had more soup selections overall. Oh and we got the pear salad and it turned out, it wasn't quite a salad as there were maybe 4 leaves on the plate hah - would not recommend if you're going for more of the traditional salad look.   Atmosphere is beautiful and romantic. Nice for a family dinner, a date night, or even an upscale bachelorette dining experience in Vegas.",

I ordered the wagyu filet and it really was amazing. It was cooked perfectly and the additions on the plate were packed with flavor and complimented the beef well. I also ordered some sort of bacon ravioli dish that was to die for. The desserts were interesting with some flavor combinations I would not have pictured together but somehow it worked.   Each of us ordered a drink, and an entree ranging from 45$-65$. We shared 3 appetizers and total was just under 700$.   I recommend trying out this restaurant if you haven't before. I might go back for a special occasion; however, the restaurant itself did not have any signature items that would really make me want to come back.",

    "text": "***There are a few good things about Shawn McClain's Sage, but it (like a lot of Vegas restaurants) is overpriced and does not deliver the same quality as similar upscale restaurants in cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles and Chicago***  Sage is one of the several upscale restaurants in Aria.  Aria's upscale restaurants are much more contemporary than the traditional fine dining spots you will find in older casinos like Caesars Palace and Bellagio.  Sage follows that trend.  Sage is in a very modern space that has kind of an upscale lounge feel.  There is  no white tablecloth though the restaurant does feel like a fine dining restaurant when it comes to their menu--a la carte items with premium ingredients, a pre fixe menu and a tasting menu are available.  I had the pre fixe menu, which offers the choice of several of Sage's signature dishes across four courses.  The meal started with complimentary bread--two crusty options including a bacon roll and salt dusted sourdough.  Both breads were fine but nothing special.  The amuse bouche was raw tuna with cucumber and wasabi.  It lacked the brightness and vibrant flavor of a good amuse.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Xx2ixDh92XbugQPNsARWxA&userid=w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  I started with the foie gras creme brulee, which was a foie gras custard base with a traditional creme brulee caramelized sugar crust.  Garnishes included good and sweet Bing cherries as well as warm, buttery and sweet brioche (topped with a little bit of salt).  The starter was very dessert-like, but it did have a strong foie gras flavor as well as foie gras' creaminess.  The brioche was a little oily.  I liked the dish, but I think it would work better as a dessert given its very sweet flavor.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=tuTEWuF9RJLCM0gO39PSEA&userid=w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  Next came day boat scallops with good mushrooms, greens and braised oxtail.  I did like the garnishes.  The oxtail was very good--tender, juicy and meaty--though there was too little of it.  The scallops were just okay. They just were not as soft, fresh or moist as I have had at other restaurants including Vegas spots like Picasso, Table 10 and Olives.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=-AmrCdNy2bPb4g30EVVeSQ&userid=w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  I had the braised beef belly for my entree.  It was an okay tasting dish.  The garnishes were decent but not as good as what came with the scallops.  The best garnish with this beef dish was the tart pickled ramps, which was the only real flavor that stood out.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=7u38OgDbTux-a4MU7_N2dQ&userid=w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  The beef belly was like ribs.  The beef belly had a good flavor and it was tender and juicy.  I did not like the unevenness of it with some meaty parts but also fatty parts that were not rendered down.  It could have just been the nature of this cut.  Dessert was an almond tart, which was really dense and thick with the texture of a butterscotch square.  It was dry and had no cake-like or cream-like consistency.  I did not like the core of this dessert though the garnishes of macerated berries and creamy, refreshing and fragrant lavender gelato were both good.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=W9-266MC8A3Rbr7hAIaKYQ&userid=w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  A la carte prices were very high like other high-end Vegas restaurants with entrees in the $40s and $50s.  The pre fixe menu was not too bad of a deal given the variety of ingredients and generous portions.  Service was good.  The staff was attentive and the food came out at a quick pace.  Our server had a matter of fact manner (which I liked).  It was a little different from the service I have had at similar restaurants where servers tend to be very gracious and eager to please.  Even though she did not have that incredibly pleasant approach of those other places, she was still polite, professional and engaging.  Overall, the food at Sage was decent and properly cooked though not much about the meal stood out.  Though Vegas has a lot of fine dining and upscale restaurants, I actually find it quite hard to have a really great high-end meal in Vegas.  If you are looking for really good contemporary upscale cuisine, I recommend the more expensive L'atelier de Joel Robuchon in MGM Grand.  If quality of ingredients and good flavors are what you are seeking, I recommend the similarly priced though more formal and traditional Picasso (in the Bellagio) over Sage.  Aria, like most casinos on The Strip, offers both complimentary self and valet parking.",

I had the summer tasting menu while my wife got the scallops. The carrot salad starter looked wild and tasted great as well. The wagyu NY strip that followed was cooked as ordered to perfection with phenomenal flavor. The scallops were some of the best we have had and the way they pair it with the oxtail sets it apart from scallops at so many other restaurants.   For dessert we had the chocolate torte which was a great finish to the meal. We love trying new places each time we are in Vegas, and Sage far surpasses the cutline for us to return to many more times!",

The usually carb conscious group could not stop eating them! - The sommelier made amazing recommendations for champagne, red, and white wines for the table. We enjoyed all three! - I loved my scallops! The preparation was simple, but they were cooked to absolute perfection.  - Other girls loved the gnocchi and short rib!  I would love to come back to try more of the menu! Thank you for a great celebratory dinner, Sage!",

    "text": "Having come from London, with its plethora of fine dining restaurants, I had big expectations for Sage but it disappointed.  Food wise, it would get 3 out of 5 in my book, as the execution was good, although there was nothing extremely exciting or creative. Just standard dishes executed well. Wagyu beef tartare was nice, but standard tasting for a tartare at a top restaurant. Scallops from the 4 course tasting menu was the highlight, while the iberico pork course came in such small portions that I felt it was half a dish. Desserts were presented exquisitely, but nothing special. No wow food here.  Service, from the waiter, was 3 out of 5. Professional, discreet, and did the job as expected of a fine dining waiter. No wow service here.  Where Sage falls over is the rest of the service. We were there on a Wednesday night. The strip was quiet, but this place failed to handle the small crowd it had. It took us 10+ minutes to be seated from arrival. Another 5-10 minutes to even get the wine and food menus. Our entire dinner took close to 3 hours because of the long waits between courses. I complained at the end and all the manager could offer was another free dessert, when clearly we wanted to just get out of there as soon as possible.  Very disappointing for a fine dining restaurant, and one that charges what it does for food.",

    "text": "We stayed at the Aria last week and with our stay, we were offered $140 in resort credits. Even though it was our second time at Sage, we figured why not use the credits towards dinner. Sadly to say, our experience was nothing more than just OK. The service was super slow (it wasn't very busy at all - 12/29)! And not just the service, but it took an awfully long time to get our appetizers. We started with the Foie Gras Brulee and the Lamb Neck Pappardelle. The Foie Gras was just mediocre; I couldn't even finish it. Hubby said that the lamb was actually descent. Then for dinner, we both had the skirt steak which was so incredibly chewy! It was served with potatoes that I could have cooked myself. The quality of the entrees was extremely poor for the price and the presentation could've been much better. Our server rarely came to our table to check in on us. She barely smiled and acted as if we were just a waste of her time which made us feel very uncomfortable. The only good thing that came out of this dinner were the cocktails! I had the Cotton-candy which had a fun presentation in a beautiful etched glass and he had a whiskey on the rocks - simple. We definitely won't be coming back any time soon especially with all of the newer restaurants in Vegas. The food is well overpriced and just not worth it. Sorry Sage, better luck next time I guess.",

They offer you rolls one is studded with bacon and the other is a French loaf along with real herbed creamy butter and a special salt.  Next comes an amuse bouche ours was a raw salmon that went down fast.  The sashimi dish featured melon like I never tasted before I think they were compressed and delicious, very sweet with an almost crisp texture. I thought this plate looked stunning and part of the look were those buttermilk caviar beads. The beads did add a texture and had were there for attractiveness but for me they seemed strange but I still thought this was a good dish. I admit I'm not the biggest fan of molecular gastronomy.  We are suckers for truffle so we tried the slow poached farm egg. It came out all foamy and you had to break the egg yolk and smear it on the nicely seasoned toast they give you. I thought the flavor was spot on and really great but the texture of the white foam was odd and little like raw egg white to me.  I thought the Oro King Salmon was OUTSTANDING. The fish seemed carefully sous vided and then seared. It truly melted in your mouth like butter. The marinated fancy tomatoes were flavorful and sweet. I enjoyed the carefully seasoned yellow squash that was cut into linguini noodle shapes. I didn't recognize the eggplant in the dish but it must have been the sage laced sauce on my plate. I was pleasantly surprised by the tasty use of snow pea tops in this dish. This dinner would have been better on a smaller plate because it was almost lost on the very large plate they put it on.  Wagu Short Rib was a winner.  We tried the corn dessert. It was very unusual and lacked sweetness.  Then we received an amuse bouche of hot white chocolate coffee.  Service was efficient and kind.",

FOOD:  First of all, the food was not impressive AT ALL. The foie gras was dry and in poor taste, with way too much peanut sauce. The grilled octopus: the thick and one-dimensional sauce overcompensating for the fact that the octopus was bland and flavorless. Flat iron steak was just all right. The steak was nicely cooked, but the sauce was boring and unimaginative. Desserts were probably the best part. They were delicious and the presentation was lovely.   SERVICE:  If this were your local BYOB, I would say the service was acceptable. The servers were generally friendly, but they did not pay any attention to details. There was such a long wait time between courses (I waited at least 20 minutes between my second and third course). One would think the servers would check on us more often, but they would only come over when they had to deliver the food and drinks. To make things worse, after I precisely asked the restaurant to prepare something special for my husband's birthday when I made the reservation, there was no happy birthday written on the dessert plate, or really anything, other than the restaurant's host wishing my husband happy birthday.",

Spacious, with pleasant lounge music at an appropriate volume, well-isolated from the craziness of the casino.  Comfortable lighting.  Well trained staff.  Excellent timing.  Appropriately priced menus.  Delicious and exciting food.  If Michelin still rated Vegas, this would be a solid candidate for 1 star rating.",

    "text": "Wonderful service- our waiter was attentive and personable. I definitely felt important and like a valued customer. The ambiance was great, we didn't make our reservation til a day before we went, so we had to arrive on the early side. At that time the dining room was pretty empty, but by the time we finished it was nearly full. However, it never felt crowded (except towards the end when a group of 6 rambunctious business men sat next to us) the dining room is spacious with high ceilings and the seats were all comfortable than standard dining chairs. My only complaint is that the table was really wide- I felt a mile away from my date! And since the service consisted of all small courses (never family style), this didn't seem necessary.  Ok- here is the real scoop: The food was DELICIOUS. My bf brought me here for a recent celebratory dinner, and we each got the smaller tasting menu ($89/person). We diverged on each course except the second  (scallops! absolutely the best dish of the night!) which was nice to get to try most everything  The highlights for me were definitely the scallops, the pork loin entree and the beautiful desserts. Neither was overly sweet, each had a savory element, but both were decadent and delicious.   This was an amazing dinner and I would LOVE to come back again for another special occasion (well, I would love to come back much more often than that, but with drinks, the bill was $250 for the two of us, so definitely not an every day meal!) I highly recommend",

The ambiance is amazing. Dark, intimate, and classically modern. Being here just felt right.   They have a million people on staff. One person brings you to your seat, another person pulls the chair back for you, another bring silverware, another does drinks, etc. you get the point. Their fresh baked breads were amazing and constant! They had bacon bread rolls made every 20 minutes, they were amazing.   The Amuse-bouche was a tuna tartar that really set the tone for the evening. We ordered the Wagyu tartar and sweetbreads for the appetizer, they were insanely good and fairly priced.   The Wagyu was served with a chocolate crisp and mixed with the most delicate of ingredients topped with an egg yolk. The sweetbreads were lightly battered and confit in bacon lardo, the sweetbreads go down as one of the best dishes I have had.   I had the veal cheeks, I have had veal cheeks before and this is by far the best that I had. They were cooked to perfection, I cannot say anything bad about my dish.   This place truly deserves its Michelin stars! The prices are so good considering what you get. There were 4 of us, we had 2 apps, 4 meals, 2 bottles of wine and dessert all under $400?! This is insane for 4 people at a Michelin rated restaurant.",

I had my expectation high before my visit. It didn't let me down at all. I ordered FOIE GRAS CUSTARD 'BRULEE' for appetizer. It was amazing! I am BIG foie gras lover and I never had it in this form before. I felt heaven after my first bite of salted brioche with foie gras custard topped with crispy sugar. It absolutely was one of my best foie gras tasting experience. I had scallops with braised oxtail for entree. It was very interesting combination in a good way. Salted caramel sauce brought the whole dish together in a very balance way. I finished my meal with olive oil ice cream. It was very good too. I had olive ice cream at Jaleo by Jose Andres before. I think they are about same good! The only thing I could complain was the service speed. It probably took 20 mins or so for our server brought my bday cake to table. Other than that, everything was great. I also sampled all dishes my girl friends ordered. There was no dish I tasted I didn't like. Sage is definitely a good place for adventure foodies.",

Our water glasses were constantly being refilled. The restaurant is beautiful (and quite large), and it's really quiet, even when the place got packed later during the evening. I would highly suggest this restaurant for large groups.  Now onto the food! Their bacon cheese bread to start is quite tasty. I ordered the tasting menu, and it was soo yummy and relatively affordable, and tons of food! A few standout dishes were my rabbit wrapped in bacon served with a sweet potato (?) ravioli. The combination of salty, smoky, and sweet flavors was amazing! Also, the chocolate peanut butter dessert the server suggested had amazing texture and crunch. Served with a raspberry sauce filled dark chocolate. So yum!  The only criticism I have is probably that the Aria is not my favorite hotel in Vegas...something about the decor/ambiance is just kind of \"off\". But 5 stars for Sage anyway, check them out!",

What?!?  Then we get there and it takes 20 minutes to seat us and we happily waited in the bar. Hostess/ host seemed very green and not very polished. We finally sat down and it was the noisiest fine dining experience I've ever encountered. My husband and I had to shout to talk. It was like they were serving us in the middle of a crowded casino floor. The food came out so slowly. It was not a well paced meal - leaving us hungry and often wondering if we were forgotten. At one point a tartar appetizer was served to me and I had to call someone's attention to the fact it was wrong. It was swept away and given directly to another table without apology. Food was subpar at best. We finally had to leave taking our dessert with us. Horrible!!! After the fact, I realized we never did get out deal with my concierge service. $700 for two people I expect way more in service from the front and from the back of the house...  Overrated and not worth. Look elsewhere.",

We were too hungry to wait until 630p so we changed it to 5p and the doors opened promptly as the host invited us in.  I requested a romantic table and appreciated the one that was selected on the side in a cozy corner, away from the center of the room.  Lauren from NJ was our server and her gentle technique and style of sharing the menu was perfect.  We choose to have the chef's tasting x 2 with the exquisite wine pairings.  The Beef Tartare was over top to start and the Chocolate Orange Soup at the end was nearly orgasmic.  What an amazing final touch... and there was more than enough to eat!  Food, service and environment all made for a lovely evening.  Sage is located in the Aria hotel.  It's been open for a year and it was a visual treat for anyone who loves style.  Walking from through the property was a nice warm up to a perfect night.",

Tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the Aria casino floor, decorated in rich purple tones, plush velvet seating - it's a True oasis in Vegas-town.  I had the 4-course Chef's Signature menu which was fantastic value at $79, however my favourite dishes were two add-'ons.. the Slow Poached Organic Egg and the Foie Brulee.  The Egg was phenomenal - a delicious, delicately poached runny egg hidden under a creme fraiche foam with smokey potato gratin and topped with shavings of black truffle.  Like the best truffle egg soup you can imagine.  I was very close to licking the bowl - thank goodness for the bread.  I don't even really like eggs, yolks make me kinda queasy - but i loved this dish.  The Foie Gras brulee is another winner - sinful, especially on top of the salted brioche.  Light, airy and mousse-like textured underneath a brulee crust, topped with shavings of torchon.  Yum.  Skip the slot machines, spend your money here instead!",

    "text": "The entrance to Sage is completely dwarfed by the bright and massive entrance to Bar Masa. As you walk towards the restaurants the Bar Masa entrance is in the center, Julian Serrano to the right, and Sage is off to the left. Despite having the least appealing entrance of the three, the food at Sage takes a back seat to no one.  At a glance, the menu has a little something for everyone -- steak, seafood, pasta, vegetarian options -- and a few dishes that might make middle America say, \"huh?\" (sweetbreads and foie gras custard). With so many tantalizing options and my limited stomach capacity (sidenote #1: as I get older I'm getting fatter but eating less... my metabolism is shot.) I wasn't sure what to choose. So, thank god for tasting menus. After hearing which dishes were on the chef's tasting menu ($120 pp) it was a no-brainer for my wife and I to get it.   //Amuse bouche// A single Kusshi oyster that went down smoothly then kicked me in the taste buds, thanks to a tobasco sorbet and a tequila-something or other. (sidenote #2: I never take notes while eating and have a terrible memory, therefore most of my reviews aren't that detailed)  //First course// Yellowtail Crudo. Delicate slices of yellowtail with mushrooms, truffles, and pine nuts gave this fabulous dish a light, refreshing, and emphatic earthy flavor.  //Second course// Foie Gras Custard Brulee. I have no idea how this dish is made and I'm not sure i want to. But, it was the most unique dish of the night and one that was so deliciously sweet and savory at the same time. Foie gras with the texture of creme brulee. With bing cherries and salted brioche. Amazing! They give you a fork, spoon and knife to eat it and I used each and every utensil to scrape the foie on the brioche or directly into my salivating mouth. Despite the dish's awesomeness, it's so rich that I can't imagine eating more than the serving provided (and part of my wife's).  //Third course// Lobster Gnocchi. I love lobster. I love gnocchi. Put them together and I'm in heaven. So light and delicate! Although the mint and other herbs in the dish gave it a very strong earthy taste.  //Fourth course// Scallop. I was on a total food high at this point. I really can't recall many details about the scallop other than it's served pre-sliced, was laying on a bed of risotto, and was accompanied by a slice of prosciutto. Make no mistake... it was tasty but not as memorable as the other dishes.  //Fifth course// Ribeye. Several slices of tender beef cooked to a perfect medium rare with some tempura mushrooms (?). It was so incredibly delicious that I think it may have been as good, if not better, than the ribeye I had at CUT.  //Ah... the ol' palate cleanser// Raspberry Sorbet. Smooth and sweet. A perfect set up for the final course.  //Sixth course// Sweet Corn Panna Cotta. After such a delicious meal this dessert was a bit of a let down. Call me old fashioned, but I tend to like traditional desserts with traditional ingredients. The sweet corn taste was good but just a little odd to me. I'm glad I tried it but it's not something I would crave again.  While the food was exceptional, the service was just the opposite. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't awful, but it was off-key most of the night. Let's rewind and start from the beginning...  What a fabulous choice [sarcasm] for management to hire a hostess that hates people, doesn't like to smile, and acts like she's doing you a huge favor by walking you to your table. After that great start to the night we sat at our table and waited. And waited. It was almost 15 minutes before someone (not our waitress but another employee) acknowledged our presence. Another 10 minutes pass before we get water. When our waitress finally shows up we mention the slow service and she gets defensive. Doesn't apologize or anything. We order drinks and that doesn't come out until after the amuse bouche. Then on two separate occasions we see a waitress heading towards our table then veer off to the server's station when she sees that our place settings are correctly set. We knew it was our food because we saw her standing there as new utensils were set, then she finally walked back to our table to deliver the food. If it happened one time... no biggie. But twice? When we're dropping four bills to eat dinner I expect service to be top notch. Then of course, there's the glasses of water. It seems like such a simple concept -- if a glass is empty, fill it up. Not here. Maybe each guest is only allowed one refill? We're in a desert after all, so maybe it's so scarce that they're saving it for the waterfall outside of the Aria registration area?   The service did get better towards the end of the meal and our ice princess waitress even cracked a smile and seemed a little friendlier (although in a fake \"I really don't care how you're doing\" sort of way).   The food here is 5 stars in my book, but they'll have to settle for 4 because of the crappy service.",

    "text": "First off, the beef tartar will give you life! It's by far my fav beef tartar in Vegas and I crave it weekly! It's rich & decadent, just the way tartar should be. It has truffle and chocolate shavings (which sounds odd but it fits in perfectly) and an egg on top, the portion is quite large too. I've tried the scallops and lamb there (not sure if they're still on the menu) and both were great. The short ribs were very tasty too (a little salt heavy that night) but tasty nonetheless.   The service has always been good and consistent, never any issues.  As for the ambience, it's dark in there and kind of on the romantic side. It's not loud like a lot of Vegas spots and it feels tucked away. It's a great date night place and a good spot for conversation. It's NOT a poppin place though, don't expect to go if you're looking to meet and mingle w strangers.  On the down side though, their menu is REALLY small which doesn't bother me but my man never gets excited about going there for that reason. I do wish they had a few more options.  Overall, it is definitely one of my favorite Vegas restos and if you go PLEASE try the tartar, you'll thank me later.",

    "text": "Solid surprisingly affordable 'fancy' dinner w/a dark sexy interior.    Freebie: Maine Lobster Bisque, OMG, amazing, with a little surprise crouton inside.   Bread: Check out the bacon roll, flaky, crunchy & even better w/butter & salt.  Drinks: 4 glasses of wine, double & single espresso.  Grub: Loved how ALL dishes had some veggies, the predominant ones, peas & asparagus.    *Gem Lettuce Salad, great tangy dressing and love 'em fresh peas. *Lobster Ravioli, thin pasta skin & loads of sweet lobster, truffles didn't hurt either. *Kobe Beef Tartare, fantastic on the buttery toast.  OMG.  The toast, the BUTTER.  *Yellowtail Crudo, an Italian twist was spot on.   *Gnocchi w/Ricotta, ordered the small size, it was plenty, the pillows were a bit big for my liking and the sauce too heavy.   *Mishima Flat Iron Steak w/summer truffles, very rich aromatic dish.    Final Freebie: Liquid dessert, delicious itty bitty Valrhona hot choco.    Total w/o tip: $199.99  Dark on Sundays.",

    "text": "The culinary talent oozing out of the kitchen is highly commendable, the ambiance is equally pleasing to the eyes, the service, however, leaves a little something to be desired.  Still, when in Aria, I would recommend visiting Sage without fail.  Once you walk past the wine racks that line the entrance to the restaurant, a lounge/bar area serves as the holding area before you are seated in the cavernous dining room with blue-lit walls featuring sections of a painting by Seurat.  It's classy, yet modern, and delightfully decadent.  Most of our party ordered from the Signature tasting menu, which at $84 was a solid deal for 4 courses.  All dishes were wonderfully prepared with balanced flavors and artful presentation.  Although many opined on the foie gras creme brulee, I opted for the burrata, which was good, but it had me wishing I ordered the foie gras.  The dayboat scallops with oxtail was fantastic, perhaps my favorite dish of the evening.  The 24 hour cooked beef belly was wonderfully tender, reminiscent of braised pork belly, but not quite as fatty.  For dessert, the olive oil ice cream on my plate was my favorite part.  While I skipped the wine pairing, several people did and were quite pleased with the pairings.  Onto the service.  Oh, our server.  He was young and inexperienced.  He spent more time crossing the restaurant floor back and forth than coming by our table.  I can excuse inexperience, but the rest of the staff at our table seemed cold, one person in particular.  He would almost toss our place settings at our table and seemed like he really didn't care about being there that night.  It certainly didn't ruin the meal, but it was a shame to have the service mar an otherwise wonderful experience.",

It's one of the best places to eat in Vegas if you're staying at Aria, even better, just go right downstairs & it's there waiting for you. it's all totally worth the prices. Seriously was one of my first 4 dollar sign restaurants i've ever been to in Vegas & I've been going back to it every time I'm in Vegas ever since. Also shout out to my waiter for letting me have everything come out at once so I could take pictures of it~",

    "text": "I really wanted to love Sage. We went to celebrate a birthday and picked Sage because we had walked through last year and loved the decor.  We ordered the full tasting menu and it was just okay.  I am not a fan of people talking about the high end places they visit when writing a review, but I will break my own rule here. We go to a lot of nice places living in San Francisco and traveling quite a bit. We like to either ask our server to choose our dinner at small plate restaurants or order a tasting menu.   Sage offered up an okay menu with okay service. The reason for 2 stars was the Wagyu beef course. It was cooked well done and tasted like beef jerky. inedible and I mentioned it to the server who took my plate. I had 1 bite and my friend ate 2 bites. For this price, I would expect some sort of reaction to both of us sending our beef back and mentioning it to the waiter. Nothing was mentioned again. We didn't want any type of compensation but expected some sort of acknowledgement of the issue. Maybe re making the dish. Most chef's notice when 2 plates come back untouched. Again it was the beef course which is usually the highlight of a tasting menu.   Another lowlight was the desert under the dome, it was just for show and made no sense. the raspberry mousse in a chocolate egg was way out of proportion. The next it was served on was tasty.  Very disappointed by the dinner and the experience.  It felt like it was done on autopilot.",

    "text": "We came for a birthday dinner here, of a very good friend. The fiance and I both decided to do the signature menu. It's 4 courses and there are 2-3 choices for each course so it was a great way for us to get two different items and be able to share. The rest of the table mostly went signature too, and 1 a la carte.   Our meal started with a amuse bouche of panna cotta, celery salad with braised beef tongue. Pretty good, though the tongue was slightly greasy rich that some may not like it, I don't mind it.   Bread service gave a choice of a bacon or plain with a chive butter. Very good bread with a lovely texture.  -First-  Kushi oysters which came with 5 small oysters. Nicely sweet, creamy and ends with some brine on the aftertaste. The tequila mignonette is nice that I may consider alcohol in my mignonettes at home.   Beef Tartare was solid as far as tartare goes, but it wasn't anything out of the extraordinary.I was hoping that the chocolate crisp in the description would be more prevalent.   -Second-  Grilled Spanish Octopus was a pretty good salad, though I think the octopus didn't really have a grill flavor. The garlic puree dressing was tasty if you like aiolis like I do and the chorizo was a nice touch, but I think I like this salad to have been not hot as I felt that messed with the dressing and leafy greens.   Dayboat scallops had a perfect sear and cook, the salted caramel reduction sauce was actually a really good pairing.   -Third-  Bacon wrapped Iberico pork loin had a very pleasant porky flavor that tells you you aren't eating conventional pork which I will choose every single time over the tasteless stuff. The slaw gave a bit of acidity which was a good contrast.   48 Hour Beef Belly was the star though. It was rich and decadent and I like those type of experiences that make you feel you're having something luxurious and naughty. Tender meat with melt in your mouth fatty bits...Mmmm.The confit veggies, the polenta with it was perfect too. Because of this dish, I went home and braised beef cheeks for 48 hours.   -Fourth-    Milk chocolate and earl grey panna cotta was lovely. I love tea flavored desserts and this work really well with the chocolate and berries on the plate.   Ricotta cheesecake had a nice fluffy texture. This was a bit salty and savory with the herbs in play, but I liked that. I can see this be not everyones type of dish though.   Then we were given a mignardise to end the meal of a hot chocolate infused with rosemary. I enjoyed this as I love rosemary in sweet applications but the fiance felt it was too strong of a infusion and overpowered.   Service was good. Drinks filled, generous bread service, plates and utensils cleared and reset with a quiet swiftness.   I enjoyed my meal here and I do see why people really like this place. However the only thing that wowed was the 48 hour beef belly out of the 8 dishes so maybe my expectations was set too high? Still, nothing was bad and I wouldn't say no to coming back, but I'm not rushing up to return for the price.",

The portion sizes were as expected for a four-course tasting menu and I was decently full afterwards (at the point where I'm satisfied, but if you were to put an In-N-Out burger in front of me, I'd eat it).  Make sure someone at your table orders the Foie Gras Brulee as their app. It's very rich and you might not want all of it, so it's good for one person to do the upgrade with the other just orders a lighter salad and then sharing.  The only impressive entree was the Iberico Pork Loin. Nothing else really stood out entree-wise.  And for dessert, make sure you get the Gianduja Pave. It was probably the most exciting thing I had that evening.  Service was a weak spot for me that evening. We had a prime table near the center of the room, but didn't get much attention throughout the meal.  As a whole, the dinner was good. But it definitely wasn't something memorable. I might have just gone on an off day, but I felt like every dish either had too much of something or was missing something. The main entrees were the least impressive (except for that amazing Iberico pork dish). Everything was lacking a certain depth. If you can spend a little more, I'd go for Le Cirque instead.",

Chef started out with an amuse bouche which was nice.  Must recommend the foie gras custard brulee - creamy with a slightly sweet crust (just like creme brulee) that came with the most amazing fresh brioche bread - it was nice, warm buttery and a bit salty that complemented the foie gras.  We even asked for more bread to finish off the foie gras.  I got the maine boat scallops which were perfectly cooked - you got 3 nice large sized scallops which were the perfect portion, accompanied by oxtail sauce and mushrooms.  My brother got the NY strip steak which was very tender and perfectly cooked to medium, and he couldn't stop raving about the mashed potatoes that came along with it (waiter said there's probably more butter and cream in them than potatoes!).  My mom got the salmon which also looked very tasty.  We were too full for dessert but they still brought over a little cup of dark hot chocolate with almond in it - it was yummy and a nice sweet touch to finish off the meal.",

The experience was much better than expected and much better than some of the reviews I've read.  We really enjoyed our appetizers - the steel cut oat veloute was especially notable. The flavors were unexpected and so delicious. We also had the oysters and they were nice.  For dinner, the rabbit, ricotta gnocchi, and short rib. The meats were tender and perfectly cooked. The seasoning and sauce on the gnocchi was especially delicious.   For dessert, the pumpkin clafoutis and caramel apple. The latter was yummy - take a bite of each component and then scoop all of it together. The clafoutis was also delicious, but we wanted a touch more of the orange to have some with each bite. Without that component it starts to fall a little heavy on your palate.  Our cocktails were also very nice - the bar staff was helpful since it wasn't too busy when we went. The aviation cocktail from the old fashioned menu wasn't quite what I wanted - maybe a bit too sweet. But I took a try on something new. Negroni and Bloody Mary were also ordered and my group was happy with their order.   Overall I was pleased with our meal - the new flavors presented by the meal accompanied by great service made it a wonderful experience. This is just what I want when I head out for an upscale Vegas meal.",

For the chefs menu, you can choose how many courses you want with or without the wine paring.

It was so sweet, it tasted like I was eating cheap jam by the spoonful. I literally felt sick to my stomach as I ate it.  I think I'm really harsh with this place because they've ruined fois gras for me. It's a delicacy not meant to be messed with, and after having it at plenty other restaurants, I didn't you could go wrong.

It was a night of great cocktails, small plates with amazing, memorable flavors, and free samplings brought to the table throughout the meal.  All of the dishes are very unique and one can guarantee it won't be found anywhere else, at least in that particular way.  One of our free samples was a delicious white chocolate soup infused with almond and thyme.  The service was great, which it better be for that price, and the atmosphere was pristine.",

    "text": "Our annual trip to Sage and again a 5 star experience. We had a fun drink at the bar with Erin serving us (he must be the best bartender in Vegas).  Our group ordered the beet salad, octopus, NY strip, and arctic char. They were all terrific. I ordered my usual wagyu beef tartare to start and it was so good as always. For my main, I ordered the potato gnocchi for the first time. I am so happy I did. It is prepared with braised lamb and pistachio's which meld together so well. By far the best gnocchi I have ever had. It was so filling I could not order dessert but so worth it. It's a seasonal dish but if you are lucky enough to see it on Sage's menu-ORDER IT!  Bottom line: Food and service here are exceptional and have been that way since they opened. Sage's GM, Robert, runs a first class operation and that's what keeps us coming back year after year.  If you have a special occasion or just want to have a dinner to remember in Vegas-make a reservation at Sage. You will remember it all year long.",

    "text": "I felt a little bit like a country bumpkin when my boyfriend walked me through doors of Sage. I mean, I have been to a few nice restaurants in my day, however, I have never been the youngest person in the room at any of those places. In Sage's case, that's probably because when people my age visit Vegas they partake in the $19.95 buffet at the Imperial Place and drink margaritas out of large plastic cups. I am extremely happy that my boyfriend and I have either better taste or deeper pockets than most of the 21-25 year old crowd because this restaurant is delicious!  We started with drinks at the bar towards the front of the restaurant. Sean said that his Martini was one of the best he ever tasted, and my peach bullet was just unreal. The bartender was awesome. I couldn't decide on my pre dinner drink, and he helped me choose based on other drinks that I do like. He also spent a good twenty minutes giving Sean and I a lesson in different absinthes. He let us smell all of the different kinds that Sage offers and taught us about both the French and Russian methods of serving it. Fun fact: Sage sells the most absinthe of anywhere in the world.   We were walked into the main dinning room which is decorated with deep purples, dim lighting, and dark wooden tables. After being seated, we were given bread and creamy butter with an array of spices mixed in. After that the chef treated us to a sample of the soup of the night. I can't remember what it was called, but it was fantastic.   We ordered beef tartare for our appetizer. I was a little hesitant to try it, but I am so glad I did. It was probably one of the best tasting foods I have ever had. I can't really compare it to other tartares because this was my first time having it, but as a N00b I really enjoyed it.   I ordered the spagetti with scallops, lobster, and octopus as m main course. I also really enjoyed that, but it was a little too much after the starters.   We ended with a hot chocolate and orange soup. It really put the final touches on the meal. Everything was perfect. Our main server and the other staff that waited on us through out the night really made it a wonderful evening!",

    "text": "During our recent trip to Las Vegas, I had to do some damage control to make up for the supremely lame meal we had the previous night at Delmonico's at the Venetian.  Mid-afternoon on a Saturday, she was browsing Yelp looking for a dinner spot and stumbled upon Sage. We called and were able to make a reservation for 9pm that same night.  We arrived a little early but the restaurant had quite a few open tables, so the hostess offered to seat us right away. We declined and instead had a cocktail at the bar. She told us to let her know whenever we were ready to be seated. There was a sizable selection of signature cocktails at the bar; but the misses went with a Moscow Mule, which was served proper in a cold, copper mug. Nice touch. I ordered the Smokin Bulliett, which was bourbon, infused with mint and lemon. The infusion definitely subdued the burn a bit, but it was delicious.  After a short while at the bar, we elected to be seated. Our waiter, Marcus, promptly introduced himself, presented the wine list and went through the menu with us. He was very friendly and polite. When he mentioned the chef's tasting menu, we were instantly sold. The chef's tasting menu is a six course meal ($120 per person) with optional beer ($50/pp) or wine ($60/pp) pairing. We decided to go for the gusto and opted for the wine pairing.  To begin, Marcus brought us a 1997 Nicolas Feuillatte champagne brut with an amuse-bouche -- a single oyster with a dab of foamed hot sauce. It was a great starter and palette cleanser, with just enough burn to notice it before it faded from your taste buds.  The first course was a hamachi sashimi with lemon, paddlefish row and a pear foam. Wow! This chef knows his stuff. The combination of the yellowtail and the pear was amazing. At this point, we both just wanted an entire entree of this course.  Next, for the second course, was a foie gras brulee with tangerine marmalade and cocoa nibs. Another mind blower. The \"brulee\" was slightly chilled, rich and creamy. The richness of the foie gras with the hint of cocoa, and the sweet of the marmalade, worked so perfectly when spread over the brioche on the side.  With the foie gras, we enjoyed a Sauternes (Chateau Roumieu Lacoste, 2006). The sweet wine with the sweet of the marmalade contrasted the richness of the foie gras very well.  The third course was a pan-roasted sea scallop with small, crispy potato rounds and sweet fennel. After Marcus brought it to our table, he then poured a Jamon-Iberico (black Iberian pig ham) chowder over the dish. This \"ham\" broth smelled amazing and worked in unison with the potato and fennel. The scallops were cooked to perfection. Of the six courses, this was both our least favorite. Please don't take that as a knock on the dish; it was amazing, but alas, something always has to finish last. Still a stellar dish.  The fourth course was a bacon-wrapped rabbit loin with a pumpkin puree and duck-venison terrine. The size of this dish was small but perfectly sized to compliment the other courses. While I enjoyed the rabbit (with bacon!), I found the duck-venison terrine to be my favorite part of the course. A terrine is similar to a meatloaf, but with coarser chops on the ingredients, and it's served cold.  Next was a 48-hour beef belly for the 5th course. I'm not sure what the 48-hours meant, and it escaped my mind to ask at that moment. The belly was very tender and, as expected, quite fatty. This course was paired with an amazing juicy and spicy 2004 Nero d'Avola Harmonium from Italy.  For dessert we had a passion fruit mousse with huckleberries and a small almond sponge cake. The mousse was firm like custard and very delicious. Just before dessert came, the pastry chef sent us a small \"soup\" of white chocolate and cayenne pepper. It was served in something akin to a shot glass and slightly warm. That was amazing! My girlfriend hasn't stopped raving about it since.  Final damage with tip was just over $500 for two people.  This was, hands-down, the best food and dining experience I've ever had! My girlfriend agrees.  The service from Marcus was impeccable. The atmosphere is sophisticated, modern but still inviting. Tip of the hat to Chef McClain.  We'll be back every time we're in Vegas.",

From the service, to the food and decor...one can expect nothing short of excellence in every regard.   First time we came here, we had such a memorable meal, that the next time we were in Vegas, we just knew we had to go. We had the chef's tasting menu the first time around and did the signature tasting menu the second time around. Both were quite delicious.

    "text": "As much as I want to, I just can't give this place 5 stars -- and I blame it on the scallops.  But we'll get to that.  Group of 9, Saturday night, made 7pm reservations, though -- didn't really seem necessary as the place remained pretty open.  For what it's worth, we had to change our reservations several times and the staff were very kind and understanding.  Upon arrival, we were greeted warmly and promptly seated.  Waiters came to take drink orders and offer us bacon bread.  (Delicious, but use caution -- don't ruin your appetite!)   The four of us girls on one end of the table wanted to split the foie gras custard brulee and steak tartare as appetizers.  While it was recommended that each dish would only be enough for 2, I would say that it was plenty for 4.  The tartare was absolutely wonderful - between the egg and the shaved truffle...  OH MAN.  Then the foie gras -- the richness you expect... and so much more.  I would've been fine with just those 2 dishes.  For my entree, I had the scallops that sat on braised oxtail and was coated in a salted caramel reduction.  For me, the sauce killed it.  Didn't really get the sweet/salty combo, as it was more salt than anything.  The oxtrail could have been better prepared, though I largely ignored the meat and the mushrooms in a feeble attempt to finish my scallops (which were thankfully, perfectly seared).  So between 2 apps, 1 entree, and paying for one of the attendees, the bill ended up being about $100 -- not as bad as I was expecting.  Sage is very much worth a visit with good friends or a significant other.",

We stopped by near opening time for cocktails ... and a little foie gras.  Originally skeptical, the Foie Gras Custard Brulee was enough to make us want to stop by for a full dinner sometime.  The bar has some good beer on tap - mostly Belgians or Belgian-styles.  They also have a respectable classic cocktail menu.  We came to try out some absinthe, though.  They're a little ... overly sensationalistic ... about the recent availability and changes in law, but they have a decent selection of bottles to choose from and are happy to make recommendations in a variety of price ranges.  They also do the fun, flaming \"Bohemian Method\" of serving it ... or the more staid French water dripping thing.  Service at the bar was friendly and fun ... we were about the only people in the restaurant at that hour, though.",

    "text": "My husband and I always go on a food crawl whenever we go to Vegas. There are many great restaurants and we have tried some each time we go. This was a complimentary meal given to us by management. So let me get started.  Ambiance: The lighting and the layout of the restaurant is beautiful and very romantic. There is enough room between diners so that you aren't on top of the next party of diners. My only criticism was the music. A bit too loud and not my favorite or suitable for a nice dinner. Seems all the restaurants want to be trendy here.  Service: The service was excellent and we never felt like they were hovering over us or like we were being ignored. Very friendly and willing to make us happy.  Bar: All sorts of great concoctions at competitive Strip pricing. They have an incredible absinthe selection! The drinks and bartender were superb.  Food: Don't know where to start it was all SO delicious.  Rolls studded with bacon and crunchy on the outside. I could eat dozens of these with herb butter. Next, complimentary Amuse Bouche which was a yellow fin sashimi with sauce & scallions (one small bite) to get the juices going! Appetizers :WAGYU BEEF TARTARE Absolutely incredible served with buttery  toasted brioche CHARRED SASHIMI OF BIG EYE TUNA Not as good as the tartare but a worthy sashimi dish Dinner: MAINE LOBSTER MEZZALUNAS really good with just enough sauce and great lobster flavor SNAKE RIVER FARMS NEW YORK STRIP by far the BEST steak I ever ate! Really, it was a very nice sized steak and cooked to perfection. Wine reduction for the sauce and marrow delicious Dessert:GIANDUJA PAVE which is:Hazelnut Crunch/Pomegranate/Olive Oil Ice Cream/Basil I have never tasted anything like this. It was heaven During the course of the meal they brought us a thyme infused hot chocolate after our dinner. It was the size of a shot. It was so good! Portions on the food are generous and enough to fill you up.  Great wines by the glass here folks and an impressive wine list. This dinner will set you back $200 before the tip for two but well worth it. Wines are from $50 to $1000 a bottle so if you want a bottle of wine, plan on spending some money. One of the best meals I ever had! We will be back!!",

Since it was back in May, I can't promise you that the entrees we had will still be on the menu, since their menu changes now and then.  Tip: Get the Chef's Menu with the wine paring.   How much wine did I have? Too much, apparently. Here's what I do remember:  - Appetizers:  Foie Gras Brulee - Very creamy but not that strong.  Wagyu Beef Tartare - Enjoyed this  A large assortment of Olives - and I'm talking 40+ olives. The GF loves olives and will still attempt to plop one on each finger of her hand and then wave to me. It doesn't matter if we're in a fancy restaurant, because she will attempt this nearly every time.  - Entrees:  Braised Veal Cheeks - Tender and tasty. GF cannot stand veal, but that's more for me!  Iberico Pork Loin for the GF - I believe she liked it a lot.  - Dessert:  Giandjuja Pave - this is a must-have. Simply the richest Chocolate/Hazelnut ice cream you can indulge in.  And some other items that I can't remember because I was pretty lit from all of the wine pairings. I do recall that their wine selection was so well-matched with our dishes, that I haven't had a comparable pairing at dinner since (although our recent Alan Wong dinner comes really close).  The decor is very beautiful. and very chic for a restaurant that specializes in \"American\" cuisine.  The service was excellent. The waiter was knowledgeable and friendly, and helped us out with a few answers on a couple of items.  I want to eat here when we return to Vegas, sometime in the near future. Highly recommended.",

We started with the sweetbreads--they were the most richly delicious I have ever had.  We followed that up with day boat scallops and the sock knocker-offer of the night...the American Kobe NY Strip steak.  Now, for the most part we are rib eye and filet people, but this was probably the best steak we have had in a long time--We are Morton's and Harris' people, so that is saying a lot.
