The food is tapas style and the prices are really cheap (well, compared to SF and LA tapas prices) for the quality of food. We ordered about 10 different dishes to share between the four of us, along with a pitcher of their sangria (large pitcher for only $28!!) and we were all STUFFED!   Our favorite stand out dishes include the scallops \"escargot\" (juicy scallops in a butter pesto sauce), the bacon wrapped dates, shrimp diablo, clams and mussels. I'm sure everything is yummy because there was not a dish I did not enjoy out of the 10 that we shared. This restaurant will be bookmarked for all my future trips to Vegas! It's great for groups or a romantic dinner and food came out hot and fast.",

I discovered it via a friends recommendation last time I was in vegas and now it is an essential part to any great vegas vacation. First time to the new location which is a stones throw from the old location. I like the larger size but miss some of the character of the old building.   They have a great mojito and a even better happy hour M-F 3-6. Unfortunately the happy hour is only for drinks. I also enjoyed one of my favorite craft beers rouge hazelnut its only 3$ during happy hour.  We brought a few friends along and stayed for several drinks and hours. It was definitely one of the highlights of our trip. The standouts wrrr the majitos we had both a pitcher and a few extra glasses. It is a little better in a glass the flavors are better proportioned. The sliders and dates were my two favorite dishes. I really enjoyed the shrimp, empanadas, stuffed mushrooms and firefly fishsticks. The only dish I would pass on was the scallop as they were rather fishy.   I feel the best way to experience firefly is with good service,  friends, drinks and great food.",

    "text": "Slightly disappointed because all the publicity took away some of the intimate aspects of the \"old\" Firefly. Parking was horrid (you can't tell if one side is one-way or not) and the wait was long at the new location when we finally found it! Given that, I still think that this is the best tapas restaurant that I've ever been to. My friends and I have been a regular before it was \"popular\" and hyped up, and we've always loved the menu items, all the way down to asking for extra bread and that yummy butter!   Our regular orders would usually consist of the chicken salad (TO DIE FORRRR!!), petit filet, firefly fries, empanadas and the kabobs among other things. I am absolutely in love with the chicken salad and I wish I could make it at home, but ehh. Price is okay, but I wouldn't go regularly--only on special occasions or when the gang gets together for a dinner date. Their dessert items are also very good.  I have never, ever been disappointed by their food! Also, the white sangria is yummy but I gotta say that their pitcher of Strawberry mojito beats the sangria hands down.   I wish they had a Firefly here where I lived now, that's how awesome this place is (minus the long wait). Last visited August 2013.",

We were not in a hurry, but were very happy with their ability to accommodate us quickly.   The atmosphere is swanky and fun. The staff nice and very knowledgable. It was our first time trying a tapas restaurant, the menu is quite extensive giving us many choices.   We tried the sangria, was excellent. The white was a little too sweet to drink a lot of, but was very good. Most in our party preferred the red.   We ordered to share as a group, so we made a rule that if someone before you ordered an entree you could not order the same thing. Doing it that way allowed us to try many different things. Fun!   When the food came we passed it around the table family style. They filled our extensive order accurately and with a great flow, well timed so we were not overwhelmed or ever waiting.   The prices are affordable, the food is flavorful and varied (everyone can find something that fits their taste), the drinks are yummy and the ambiance is unique and perfect for a group looking to celebrate or an intimate date.   Don't leave without trying the filet mignon or bacon wrapped dates, they are fantastic.",

    "text": "I was brought here by my friends who are locals. This is hands down some of the best food I've ever had! Everyone must try this place. It's about one mile off the strip, so everyone should be able to reach it.  Having traveled all over Spain and also having eaten at Spanish restaurants all over Southern California, I expected to find the typically understated and demure, simple and clean tapas I'm used to. Not So! This is bold and flavorful. It's Innovative, it's creative, it's Spanish fusion.  The Food Style: This is gourmet at at an affordable price. IMHO the chef is a genius. Each small tapas plate is unique and individual, no two dishes are the same. Again, they are flavorful and bold, never bland. They display complex and contrasting flavors that are complimentary and blend seamlessly together to form a cohesive unit. Because each tapas plate is a small bite, the three of us were able to try 9 plates + 3 free bread and olive plates (The honey-almond-butter is amazing). This meal was like an amusement park for the taste buds.  I don't eat much meat, so we stuck to seafood and vegetable dishes. It's great for vegetarians.  My Favs (all 5 stars): The stuffed peppers, the roasted eggplant cannelloni, the manchego mac 'n' cheese, grilled scallops with saffron potato puree, and steamed mussels (incredible sauce). They give you as much free bread with honey-almond-butter and olives as you want. My friends raved about the bacon-wrapped stuffed dates, which are arguably the most popular item on the menu (I don't eat bacon).  Others (4 stars): Tortilla espaniola, patatas bravas (great brava sauce).  To Drink: A pitcher of Red Sangria. This is the real deal and very very tasty. It tastes like a fruity Merlot, not like some frou-frou fake sangria cocktail you get at chain restaurant.  NOTE: some tapas are better than others, but you have to be adventurous and start trying. Use the tips above. The only one I wouldn't order again was the seared ahi tuna skewers. They didn't have much flavor and the texture a little too tough to chew.  Ambience: somewhat dark and intimate, warm decor, comfy booths.   Service: Excellent. very friendly and attentive. They easily accommodate special requests.  Prices: $35 per person after tip per person for 9 plates and a big pitcher of sangria, and we were all STUFFED.   PROS: The Amazing Gourmet Food; great for vegetarians; affordable prices; delicious sangria; comfy booths;  great service too; close to the Strip (about 1 mile)  CONS: NONE  BOTTOM LINE: Come here, or you're missing out! I would consider driving back to Vegas from LA to eat here.",

It's all very spacious and when the weather is nice, the whole place feels very open and airy when the patio doors are open.  The food was great as I remember it from the previous location, with their signature items such as the bacon wrapped dates. We tried a handful of plates and with each tapas order, we were impressed. I can't even really repeat back to you everything we had but there were plenty of delicious and savory options. We tried so many and didn't feel like we broke the bank in the end. We opted for two desserts, one that was the flourless cake and both desserts sent us straight into a food coma as desired/expected.  We visited on a Saturday night and the one thing that was a little annoying was how loud the music was. There was a nice mix of songs - some Spanish, some radio hits, some rock - but it was all very, very loud. At one point in the beginning of the meal, we considered asking to move to the patio because it was just so so loud inside (seated at the bar). Since it's a very open layout, maybe that wouldn't have even helped.  Luckily, sound did not disrupt our dining experience!",

We went late at night and it was still bustling with a lot of people. There was also a separate area for dancing for which I believe there is an entry fee. We had 6 plates between 3 of us and were pretty full. Octopus, clams, lamb sausage, lamb chops etc were all delicious. Plenty of more diahes to try for which I am going to go back next time I am in Vegas.",

The waiter recommended an appetizer, a salad dish and several main entries, which were all fantastic! I had the chorizo plate, apple & manchego salad, Tierra y mar skewers, and chocolate cherry bread pudding. My mouth is watering just from writing this review several weeks after I left Vegas. If your in the mood for a change of pace, you can't go wrong with Firefly. They have vegetarian, seafood, meat, spicy options, etc. I will be returning here on my next trip to Vegas.",

AMAZING. Who would've thought sliced apples and manchego cheese together would make such an appetizing dish?! This is a must order for me every time I'm here. Definitely shareable too!  We sat at the bar, to which our bartender was very knowledgeable on the menu and suggested many items to fit our taste buds/diet.  We then ordered their shrimp ceviche, tuna tartare, and scallops \"escargot\" from his many, delicious sounding, suggestions.   Their shrimp ceviche makes my mouth water just thinking about it. SO FLAVORFUL! Its a little on the citrusy side, but I loved it that way. They came with crackers so balance out the lemon. *droool*  The tuna tartare came with taro chips, which by the way, are my faavorite, so it instantly got a lot of lovinnnn from me. But the tuna tartare alone was delicious. It's basically ahi tuna and avocado, and their seasonings, sprinkled with love.   And lastly, the scallops escargot was very delightful! Herby, buttery, breaded goodness with a nice lilll scallop in the middle.   Those four were about 50 dollars, give or take. I absolutely love tapas for the fact being you can try many different options on the menu without breaking the bank. And with that, I absolutely love this place! The portion sizes, yeah they're still small plated, but I feel like they still give you a good amount! We're small girls tho, so that was enough to fill us up without feeling too full  Also, side note, on another occasion, I had their stuffed dates and those are just as bomb as everything else :) try everything! Or atleast what I've mentioned.",

Interior was nice, and had my boyfriend even saying he didn't feel like he was in Vegas when we ate there. Parking lot and valet was full when we arrived, but most were dancing out in the patio, and not eating inside so we were able to get a table instantly.   Service was prompt, with waters and appetizer bread being brought out as I sat down. Boyfriend ordered the calamari and Shrimp with pepper and butter. I was crazy excited to break that yolk on top of the Huevos.   Waters were continuously poured, food came out in a timely fashion, bread was gahhhmazing and service was good. Definitely try it!",

Anyway, the tapas, the drinks, and the dessert are all fabulous. You really cannot go wrong with whatever you pick, particularly because you can do family style and if a dish is not your favorite, someone else is bound to enjoy it. My favorite items are the stuffed peppers, the patatas bravas, the bacon wrapped dates, and the chocolate tres leches cake. Aside from the food, the ambiance is great, with a bit of a classy romantic flair, the service is good, and the valet parking is free.",

Can't wait to go back the next time I am in Vegas.   Not sure if they have Salsa dancing every Friday, but they did we we visited in June 2017. And that was thoroughly enjoyable as well.",

They have great lunch specials, happy hour deals, and also great for date nights and dinner time.   It is tapas style so there is plenty of options to choose from depending on your preferences. My girlfriend and I went the surf and turf route as the below will describe our order.  Scallops escargot Tuna tartar Lamb chops Pallela  I think we tried flan or an ice cream dessert I don't remember as I am writing this review over a month later. ( I know horrible procrastinator)  I have never gotten sick here and I've eaten here probably 6-7 times over the years of my Vegas trips. I love the honey butter or whatever butter they serve with the thin baguettes. They used to give olives with the bread but I guess not many people were eating it so they stop. I do believe you can request it though. Will come back as the location isn't really far from the strip either and they have a parking lot you can park in.",

The tapas style worked perfectly for our large party, and we all got to sample a variety of dishes: ceviche, tuna tartare, patatas bravas, pork empanada, chicken empanada, fish sticks, fried calamari, pulpo asado (octopus), steamed mussels, scallop \"escargots\", steak and mushroom skewers, lamb chops, and seafood paella. We also ordered pitchers of both red and white sangria. Everything was delicious and there wasn't anything I didn't like! Some plates do only come with a few pieces, so we did order doubles.   The service was attentive the whole night, with our waiter checking up on us regularly and our waters refilled. We brought a cake in, and they helped us cut and serve it for dessert. Price was extremely reasonable, unlike some other restaurants in Vegas. In terms of atmosphere, there was some dim mood lighting, Spanish decor and art, and the space is pretty big. We got seated in a sort of private booth which was kinda cool. Will definitely come back the next time I'm in town!",

I've been here several times, with pretty good experiences, however this time I ordered take out, and was severely disappointed. To start the food was not ready 20 minutes later when I went to pick it up, the teenaged receptionist seemed out of touch and ambivalent about my order, another inquiry 10 minutes later, and I get \"it will be up soon, just waiting for the steak\". Another 5 minutes and I ask for the manager seeing it's now been over 35 minutes, and they could have started cooking the food when I arrived and it should be ready by now. Another 10 minutes no manager, but the food comes out and seems to be hot. Get home, food is not to order, despite all the time wasted.  While this used to be a go to place, it seems understaffed, management does not care (half full restaurant btw), and service level sucks (did not even order the paella, which takes 30 minutes). I'm done with this place and would not recommend it (despite previous reviews).  Please see my review record to confirm I'm usually a pretty positive person.",

I used to come here all the time and accidentally burnt myself out on the place, so I had to take a break but it's been long enough so I'm back. Anytime I come here I usually start with the Stuffed Dates [bacon-wrapped,smoked almond,red wine reduction with blue cheese]. That gets me ready for the next few items that I order which are the Chicken Skewers [grilled marinated chicken breast,seasonal veggies,and roasted garlic cream] The Petit Filet [mini filet mignon, herb cheese,roasted potatoes,mushrooms and red wine sauce] The Baked Cod [lemon,garlic,butter and fried onion] The Chorizo Plate [4 imported thinly sliced cured meats, cornichons, capers and mustard] and lastly The Baked Goat Cheese [goat and garlic cream cheese, tomato sauce, Pesto and toast]. All are delicious and should be given a chance. Now for dessert well they have over ten to choose from so I'm sure you guys will find something. As far as the actual restaurant and bar the vibe is great and always fun. It's a cool hangout if you and some friends just wanna kill some time!",

If your idea of a good time is to bring a crowd and sample many different dishes over the course of several hours, then Firefly may be the place for you. Our party of twelve thoroughly enjoyed the experience and tasted just about everything on the menu, along with several pitchers of their excellent sangria.  An added bonus for vegetarians or those with gluten allergies, Firefly has a separate menu with their vegetarian options on one side and their GF options on the other. This came in handy when ordering for our group, and made it easy to have safe meals for everyone, no matter their dietary restrictions.  If you like sangria, be sure to try some. Both the white and the red are excellent, but I preferred the red. Nice and dry, not too sweet, and a fine accompaniment to the Spanish-style tapas. Also good - their mojitos! Available by the pitcher.  My favorite items were the bacon-wrapped stuffed dates, the Padron peppers (deceptively simple, but tasty), and the watermelon sorbet at the meal's close. The sorbet flavor changes daily.  Others at our table raved about the Tierra del Mar skewers and the lamb chops. The bread and almond butter disappeared quickly.  Basically, there's enough variation on the menu to find something for everyone. But that's a little bit of the problem too. The menu feels scattered and not as cohesive as it could be.  Service is professional and fairly efficient, but at times was hit or miss. This is expected with large groups and a busy restaurant, and we never had to wait too long for beverage refills. Plus, the staff wants you to have a good time. As an example, our first order of lamb came out overdone, but Firefly was able to get another going and on the second try the lamb chops were hailed as the standout meat dish of the evening.  One final note. Don't call this a Spanish restaurant if you have an actual person from Spain in your group. It was my colleague's first time in the USA, and he was appalled that Americans think Spaniards eat this way. Live and learn! (Although he did enjoy the food and the drinks. He just took issue with anyone saying it was Spanish.)",

HERE'S A TIP: If your wait is long to get seated, go to the bar, order a pitcher of Sangria and put in your order for a paella because that will take 40 minutes to cook and by the time you get seated you can have the paella delivered to your table. By the way, the Sangria will change your life.          Let's start with the house bread which is garlic and the butter that accompanies it is this sweet, herby mix with I don't know what, but it tasted AMAZING! The staff saw that our group enjoyed this and brought extra bread out without us having to ask. We ordered the mac and cheese which was delicious and used the pasta shells instead of the elbow macaroni. Definitely home made and not out of a box, creamy and delicious.The goat cheese dish was good and had a sort of marinara base. I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese but it went well with the base. The mixed paella was out of this world! I need more paella in my life after eating the mixed paella which consisted of pieces of chicken, shrimp and clams and just a great flavorful bed of rice.  I'm still heart broken that we didn't take the leftover mixed paella (there was at least a cup of paella left) to go because my friend said she didn't want her car to smell (we were headed to XS at Encore after dinner and it would've sat in the car for like 3 hours). It was my friend's birthday, and they brought us flan for her at no additonal charge and put a candle in it. Luckily she hates flan so I got to eat most of it and yeah, I'd lie and say it's my birthday anytime I visit here to get free flan.             Everyone from the hostess at the front to the bartender and wait staff outside were courteous, beautiful and attentive. Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm definitely eating here and trying even more tapas and taking the leftover paella to-go and eating it on the way home.",

If your going to be on the strip this has got to be one of your stops for a girls night or dinner date trust me everyone will be thanking you later!  Atmosphere is fun and flirty here! Love the accents of red and the lighting, service was also really good- our waitress was very accommodating and despite how busy they were her service stayed considerably great throughout the night.   Sangria!!!! About every table had a bottle so we knew it was good, we got both the red and white fruit sangria- I preferred the red but both were bomb! I really can't wait to try their Mojitos next time :).  The tapas here are 5 stars worthy and the price just can't be beat!!!! Love that each person can order a few things to try something different. It was perfect for a large group because it ensured that everyone would find something they liked & the tapas style makes people more open to sharing lol.   Recommend:  - the mussels in their broth are outstanding, everyone was jealous they missed ordering this one, it's definitely a meal within itself bc you won't be able to resist dunking your bread into it. - calamari was good, great dipping sauce. -ahi tuna tartar was fresh & light _clearly there are so many things on the menu id say almost everything looked worth trying once!",

The Tres Leches was also delicious, so much that my wife ate about half of one of our friends before he realized it. Our other friend who is the tres leches fan said it was up at the top of his favorite tres leches cakes.

We made a reservation in advance through the Firefly banquet contact (the information is easily available on their website) and did a pre-fixed menu of family style tapas for a great price!  We did the Tapas Banquet for $33 and with (copious) drinks on top of that, it came to $60 pp including tip.  If we had had the same dinner on the Strip, we would have paid more than twice as much!   Firefly was super easy to work with in making the arrangements.    What also was great is there were great options available for my vegan and gluten-free friends, in addition to the yummy food for us meat-eaters.  We also had a ton of leftover food that we had boxed up and ate the next day as hangover breakfast food.    This worked out super for us based on our bachelorette party schedule, which was as follows:   6 - 7:  Pre-dinner light drinks at The Platinum Hotel (we booked the Marquis Suite, which easily slept 6 ladies with space to spare!),  7 - 8:30 Dinner at Firefly (we ubered there from the hotel, about $6 - 8, the uber ride was about 4 minutes),  8:30 - 10:30:  Back to the hotel to freshen up, pregame, and do some bachelorette games, 10:30 - late:  We went out clubbing to Tao in the Venetian  The overall night went great, and Firefly was one of the best parts!",

Not even the food poising outbreak at the old location could stop me lol! We tried going the Friday night when we were in town and it was slammed packed. We went back the next day at about 2 and there were only 4 other parties in there at the time.. I stuck with the same dishes that I normally ordered, but my girlfriend was trying new things. I like the tapas style, bc it allows you to be able to share and try more things at once.  Bacon wrapped dates- these things are worse than a crack addiction, I'm assuming lol.. The bacon and the blue cheese go great with the dates. And it doesn't hurt that the bacon is crispy!  Shrimp ceviche- nice fresh taste, lots of shrimp and flavor. The avocado is always a nice touch.  Menchago mac n cheese- cheese cheese and more cheese. You know it's good when the cheese is still bubbling when it gets to the table.  Stuffed chicken and chorizo mushroom- the mushroom add a great texture, the the flavor of the chicken and the chorizo are on point.  I suggest you try the place out.. It not on the stipe but it's not far at all. Give it a try, I'm sure you will like it  Yelp 100 Challenge 2016- 7/100",

I have a weakness for Mojitos and they have like 9 different flavors. I asked our waitress what she would recommend and she had me try the Paradise Mojito and it tasted like a tropical getaway.

There were vast vegetarian options for my wife. It is worth a cab ride or renting a car. I had the ceviche, which was great, and the camarones di diabla were amazing. Lots of meat choices, too. The service was wonderful. We come to Las Vegas three times a year and this is going to make it part of our regular places not to miss. When it's not too hot the outdoor patio is a great place to sit",

    "text": "Def a place to go in Vegas! My boyfriend and I were trying to find a place in Vegas to go that was different, not over priced, and delish. We didn't want to do the traditional steak houses because honestly you can get a good steak from a good steakhouse anywhere. My boyfriend has never had Tapas before so I suggested we look up restaurants with Tapas. Firefly had good reviews so we made reservations for 6pm. When we got there it wasn't very busy yet.   Ambiance: The lighting is dim which is nice because it makes you feel like your the only ones in the restaurant. We were seated in a corner booth and it just made everything perfect. There is a lot of red to the color scheme and it kind of had a tacky-manly-romantic vibe to it but it fit its romantic fun feeling.  Service: We had the best service. Our waiter was attentive, knowledgeable and all around an all star. I have worked in the restaurant industry for a good 5 years and i appreciate when someone is as good as he was. Not only was our server great.. the food runner was good, and the busser or server assistant was amazing. He did not let a empty plate sit on a table for anyone.. I saw him sneakingly cleaning up without interrupting people in the dinner conversations.  Food: It depends what you get. All of the food we had was good. But some were just good and some were AMAZING. The portion sizes are definitely bigger than a normal tapas place which is nice and well worth the money. Some suggestions for food are.. Dates, Filet, Lamb. Those were our favorites.. we wanted to try much more but we got full fast. Not only is the food good.. omg the sangria was heavenly.. we got the pitcher and it was gone at the end of dinner.  Price: The price is very reasonable and I'm so glad we went there. We got a pitcher of sangria and 6  tapas.. our bill was $95. We got to try all different kinds of food and get 6 glasses of sangria out of the pitcher. It is very reasonable.  The next time we are in Vegas we will be coming here!",

Or maybe because I was not drinking pitchers of sangria like others at my table that I was able to taste what their food really taste like.  SO not impressed... the empanadas taste like the Goya frozen ones that you get from the spanish supermarket.  The fries ehh okay.  Although the location is bigger now it is still to loud for a decent conversation... and again the food was just okay.  So if you want okay food and alcohol go here.  Otherwise there are plenty of delicious places to go in Vegas.",

The potatoes that came with it are great too.  Can't go wrong with the shrimp either. The sauce is succulent.   But the real kicker here is the Mac and cheese! Nothing like anything I've had except maybe the Mac and cheese at BarBistro by Chef Beni Velasquez. These two Mac and cheeses are the best in the city.   Overall a nice dinner date venue.",

Call to make a reservation if going with a large group to avoid long lines.",

The stuffed dates were so good. I'm usually not a fan of bleu cheese crumbles, but it paired so well with the sweetness of the dates. In addition to the dates, we got the vegan crab cakes, the veggie empanadas, and veggie pasta. We finished our meal with the passionfruit mini cheesecakes and it was the perfect combination of tangy & sweet. We hope to come back to Vegas in the next few months with family & we definitely plan to bring them to Firefly. Thanks for such an incredible evening! :)",

Food: my favorite is always going to start with the bacon wrapped dates. Make sure you order the paella ahead because it takes some time. It's worth the wait.   Overall, this place is a great place for date night. Just make note it is busy, so plan ahead and enjoy the tapas.",

Firefly came up so I checked it out and menu looked good so we met there.  The restaurant looked really nice inside; dimly lit, a little loungy-like. We were both pretty hungry so we ordered a few dishes to start. The vegan crab cakes, the patatas bravas and the vegetable empanada were all so delicious and the presentation was great!  Next we ordered the tuna kebabs, the filet mignon kebabs and the lamb chops. They were all perfectly cooked, delicious and well plated as well!  We ordered the dessert sampler because all the desserts looked so good so we wanted to get a bit of a lot of the desserts. The passionfruit tarts were really good. So were the berry tarts and the bread pudding. But the flan! Perfectly creamy and sweet! A great end to our meal! And even though it seemed like it didnt take a long time for our dessert to get to our table, a lovely lady apologized for the dessert taking so long and took it off our bill!  So if you in the area, and are looking for a great tapas restaurant with a great menu, great service and great ambiance, look no further than Firefly!",

The food was served sporadically and some were left to watch others eat. I order the stuffed dates and Mac & cheese. My dates were tasty as always, but I didn't not get the rest of my meal for an entire 45 minutes later! This was the case for the group. When I notified the waitress of the ridiculous wait her response was \"yes.\"  I was underwhelmed with the food quality, and the quality of service further aided in this outing.",

Okay, not really, we did have to wait a few minutes because there was a line of people at the host stand, but it wasn't more than 10 minutes before our table was ready. Nahum was our server and he was on point. He checked back often but wasn't overpowering the table and he was SO NICE!  The menu is huge and the plates are tapas style so it's easy to over order. A few highlights for me were the Scallop Escargots with the buttery herb sauce and the Chicago Beef. Oddly, my table mates weren't as big of a fan of the Chicago inspired sandwiches but they are east coasters so perhaps they have more to compare it to. I also loved the Hearts of Palm *Crab* Cakes. They are vegan, so don't expect crab, but I loved the texture and flavor.   A few misses were the Serrano Ham & Cheese plate and the Seafood Paella. The cheese on the plate was flavorless and the paella was very bland.  The pitcher of red sangria was amazing though and for how busy this place is, the food comes out super fast. This was my second time here and although it's not my favorite spot in Vegas, it's close to my house and worth the price.",

    "text": "This place is conveniently located a few streets off the strip behind the Linq hotel.  The place itself is huge and there is parking in the rear and valet parking up front. The lighting is dimmed inside.  My group of 4 ordered the following items:  Mixed Paella - $26 - All the paella dishes take about 40 minutes to prepare so I placed an order for this as soon as we arrived.  They are also highly customizable.  My mixed paella consisted of shrimp, mussels, clams, calamari, chicken, veggies, hold the chorizo (as I don't eat pork).  This was the star of the night as this dish was bursting with flavors and had quality ingredients.  The dish is designed for 2 to 4 people to share.  Pulpo Asado - $10 - Another one of my favorites was the grilled octopus with potatos, tomato, and a paprika-lemon vinaigrette.  It wasn't as soft and tender as my favorite tapas place, but it was still very good.  Scallop Escargots - $10.50 - This dish consisted of scallops baked in garlic-herb butter and the presentation gave the affect that they were escargots.  Tinga Empanada - $4 - This tapa was a bit small and consisted of 2 crispy chicken empanadas, tomato, onion, and chili-lime crema.  This dish was good as well.  Petite Filet - $13.00. - The filet mignon was tender and I asked them to prepare the dish without the red wine sauce.  This dish wasn't bad, but I would probably order some of the other tapas.  By the time we finished our meal there was a huge wait.  I really enjoyed the meal and would highly recommend ordering the mixed paella as some of the other tapas weren't really filling.  Service was extremely fast for the tapas that we ordered and our water glasses were filled through the night.",

    "text": "As soon as knew I was going to Vegas I bookmarked this place.   I read the reviews, saw the pictures, and knew I had to try it.  I did not have a lot of time in Vegas, just going for a trade show, during the week, and only time off for dinner. First night I attempted to go, place was booked for a private event and wait time was over an hour.  I didn't give up, next day, I went a little earlier and was able to find a spot at the bar.  I was greeted immediately, and given both the happy hour menu and food menu. I love Tapas style restaurants, gives you an opportunity to try many different things, especially if sharing.   Since I was traveling solo, I didn't get to order many things but what I did, I absolutely loved.  I started with one of their specialty sangrias, the sparkling one.  Very well balance between the wine and peach flavor, plus all the fruit.  It's a little too sweet for me but very refreshing and I would order it again.    While enjoying my Sangria, I looked over the food menu and decided on the Mushroom and Steak kabobs, and the Manchego Mac N Cheese.   They didn't take too long to come out, and they served them almost at the same time so I was able to have them as a meal.  Protein and it's side dish. The steak, I ordered medium-well, was soft, juicy and very flavorful.  The mushrooms were decent size, and so delicious with the steak. The Mac N Cheese was crunchy on top, perfect amount of cheese...  maybe if I would have stopped eating this I would have been able to try something else but I just couldn't.    Before I was able to finish my meal, the sangria was done.  Instead of ordering another one, I saw their other specialty are mojitos...  and, they have a passion fruit one.  I just HAD to order it, and absolutely LOVED it!  The passion fruit flavor (my favorite fruit) really comes through, and it's not drowned in sugar/ simple syrup (like many places do).  I like it's natural tartness, and love when people don't mess with it.  Extra points for that!  The food was amazing, service was friendly & quick, and on top of that, I got to talk with some fun people sitting at the bar near me.   So glad I went again that night and got to enjoy this place.  Definitely a must and permanently on my list of restaurants to visit in Vegas.",

    "text": "Perhaps we didn't order the right dishes (despite following some of our waiter's recommendations), but we thought this was not a very authentic Spanish tapas experience. We've eaten at a lot of tapas restaurants in the past, and this one was definitely my least favorite. To break it down:  Food: Based on our waiter's recommendations, we ordered the Stuffed Dates, the Tierra Y Mar (surf n' turf) Skewers, and the Camarones al Ajillo (garlic shrimp). We also ordered the Mushroom Montadito and the Merguez Bocadillos (lamb sandwiches). The Stuffed Dates are apparently the most popular dish on the menu, and we thought they were pretty good (the best dish of the night). It ended there though. The surf n' turf skewers were so overcooked that even the shrimp was tough! We each ate a bite and didn't want to keep eating. The garlic shrimp was way too salty, but at least the shrimp wasn't overcooked... The mushroom and lamb dishes were also salty, not much other flavor profile.   Service: Our waiter was nice and attentive. We thought the dishes came out way too quickly, it felt like they were rushing us. Makes sense, because they were packed - if you're going to eat here, I recommend making a reservation.  Atmosphere: Crowded and noisy, but not necessarily in a bad way.",

The waiter came out several times to check on other tables and even after we ask someone to send a waiter to us, and he checked on the other tables again and left. We walked out.",

Sorry Firefly.. Your service was good since it was a late lunch, and it wasn't crowded, but your food has changed and not how we remembered it. We each ordered 2 dishes (total 12) plus a paella. Every thing was mediocre except for the scallop with butter and garlic sauce, the mussels, and the salads.. But other dishes either were too sweet (the ribs, shrimps, octopus), and the paella was not even close to be ok. It wasn't your thing. It has too much tomato sauce which causes the dish too wet, and the mussels, clams, shrimp were too dried. Hmm.. Not sure if we would come back here again for the good old time.. You had it going, but not sure what went wrong?? Did you change the chef or just simply because of the expansion that made it go out of hand? Hope you could pull it together so i could recommend others when they're in town because the new place looks awesome with good decor and vibe.",

    "text": "My husband and I just went there for lunch today and it was extremely disappointing. We ordered a veggie paella because we missed the paella we tried there couple years ago. So after 40 mins passed, the paella came with so little rice, and it was really more like a stir fried veggie instead of paella. Paella is a rice dish, there should have been a reasonable amount of rice but there was really not much rice! I remember they gave more than that years ago. And I have eaten paella in various restaurants, so I know how a paella should be. The paella today at Firefly was absolutely ridiculous. It was like a stir fried veggie with little rice sprinkled on it and then stirred together. We felt totally cheated. We didn't send it back because we didn't want to wait another 40 mins. And we totally lost faith in this place so we didn't bother to ask them for making a new one or ordering some other tapas instead. I ended up not touching the paella after 2 bites, and my husband ate the whole thing; he was able to finish it by himself because there was hardly any rice to make him full. the menu said paella is meant for 2-4 people, so u can imagine how little rice there was when my husband could finish it by himself! Compared with the paella we got there years ago, we couldn't finish the whole thing together years ago, while my husband can finish the sorry pathetic \"paella\" today by himself. It was really jacked up and we got out of there as soon as my husband finished it, and now we are sitting in another restaurant to get fed. We will not go back to Firefly again, it was not like what we had years ago. I never see any paella with so little rice in it in my whole life! Totally not an honest business. $20 for a stir fried veggie looking paella was totally wrong!",

If you don't care about people parking your car, DO THE FREE VALET.  I drove my boat back there trying to find a parking space, and I couldn't find ONE space I felt comfortable leaving my car.  I ended up parking in the hotel parking lot next door and walked over after leaving the frustration known as Firefly's parking lot.  I wanted the Firefly fries that I've grown to enjoy...They come with Parmesan, Herbs, and an Aioli for $6.  Since I knew I was gonna order another plate or two in addition to the fries, I decided just to spend the money for the steak and fries :P  14oz Ribeye ($20): Red Wine Sauce, Cabrales Bleu Cheese, Firefly Fries and Aioli. Surprisingly large ribeye for the money! It was a good steak, cooked perfectly, but the sauce/seasoning was a little distracting. Still good though!  However, the fries were undercooked and stupid oily.  Like \"dripping off your fingers\" OILY.  I should have returned them, but my steak was cooked perfectly, and I thought it was a waste to turn over the plate.  They probably would have just brought me a new side of fries, but that's in hindsight.   So you can still get a decent value at Firefly...just factor in bad parking and a hint of inconsistency and you'll probably be fine!  Pics :",

Honestly (surprisingly enough) the food was hands down the saving grace of this place. The stuffed dates were insanely good and everything from fries to steaks was well cooked, expertly seasoned and of decent portion size.   However, and i wish i knew his name (a big muscular guy, maybe late 20s), the bartender was so incredibly rude--and openly so!-- that instead of moving on to entrees like we wanted to, we cashed out and left.   I wont go into the drawn out details of it all, but trust me when i say i was shocked how clear he made it to us that our business was neither wanted nor appreciated. Its not like the bar or well was even busy. If it was negligence due to that, i could have understood...  Well, we liked the food so much though that we decided to give it a second chance a couple weeks later. But, when we walked in and saw the same bartender with his signature eye roll and snarky comment as our only greeting, we quickly regretted it and left.   So then, it really is a shame, because the food is killer. If you decide to go, i recommend getting a table and bypassing the bar. We wont be back though.",

I have never tried a dish that I didn't like, but my favorites and first to recommend would be the Stuffed Dates, Ahi Tuna Skewers, Steak and Mushroom Skewers, Petite Filet Mignon, Stuffed Peppers, and Chocolate Tres Leches Cake. Try it and love it too!",

And oh my gosh the almond butter is to die for ((if any foodies can figure out the recipe please let me know )) anyways this place is great whether you're dressy or casual! Each plate is priced differently so it depends on what you order my friend and I spent 50$ all together for 5 plates :) the camarones a la diabla is so gooooooood and it's not really spicy it actually has a Sezchuan taste to it. Well that's my opinion anyways if you like a sweet chili sauce then you'll love the shrimp  can't wait to be back here soon!",

I parked in the rear and had to walk past the dumpster with a man rummaging through it.    I sat at the bar.  The redheaded server was very sweet and know her menu items.  I was especially impressed when she told me what looked good out of the kitchen that night. I started with the Salmon Toasts.  They had very good flavors but tasted very similar to bagel and loxs(should have listened to the waitress). The second dish I ordered was the shrimp Diablo.  The sauce was a perfect mix of spicy and sweet.  The shrimp were cooked perfectly.   The third dish I ordered was the lamb chops.  They too were delicious.  I would not recommend them if you're in a large party.   Overall the food was good.  The service was great.  One critique would be the presentation of the dishes.  They could have made them look a little better with the small plates.",

It was a nice sunny day and they have a nice patio!  Service - meh. The waiter brought in 2 wrong dishes even though we asked questions about those dishes before ordering. By the time the food arrived, we had already waited more than 30 minutes.  I guess the worst part of the experience was that I was charged double the actual amount that I signed for. I called to correct this, and they were very nice, friendly and apologetic but its more than a month later and I still don't have a refund. My advice would be to check your bill twice and make sure you keep a copy in case you need to dispute it later.",

My favorite item to get is the steak and mushroom skewers, they're cooked in a red wine reduction; and it's amazing.   The only reason I couldn't give 5 stars is because of the service. The service is pretty terrible at best. Everyone looks annoyed to be there, and the servers tend to disappear after you order only to be briefly replaced by what they call, an assistant server. They look even more annoyed that the regular servers.   Firefly, please hire some better servers. The service needs to be comparable to the food!",

The reason I didn't give a 5star is because they auto added a gratuity. I truly despise that. This is Vegas and hospitality and guest service are expected. All interactions like this should be 5star no matter where you go. That being said, lets talk about the food. ITWAS SOOOO GOOD.  there was 6 of us and we all ordered 3 tapas so u can imagine what our table looked like. I didn't get the waiters name, slight deduction for that as well, but he made suggestions to me based on what my friends ordered and they were spot on. i got to try the shrimp tempura, the filet, the steak on a stick, the ahi tuna, the scallops, empanada ( chicken ), stuffed pepper, the spanish chorizo, the ham, and the mini bagles and salmon. everything was so good. had a stella draft. it was kind of tiny to be honest and this is coming from a non-drinker. either way yo will not be disappointed !  the amount of food they put on each plate is actually pretty significant. enjoy !!!",

My go-to's are the the tuna tartare and the mixed paella. Make sure you order the paella early on so you don't have to wait too long.   This time we had Jaime serving our table along with our main server and he was amazing. Someone give him a promotion! He never let me see the bottom of my water glass and that is very rare. He even stopped another server from taking away my lemon wedges because he knew I wasn't done with them.   Good food, good prices.",

One year later, I was craving Firefly again because I had such fond memories of how delicious the food was.   Once again, I wasn't disappointed.  The food was as good as I remember, the service was great and I believe you get a good deal for your money.  I highly recommend this place.  It's slightly off the Vegas strip, but worth the trip!",

Maybe it's because I live in NYC and we have some amazing tapas places (Boqueria), but I wasn't so impressed. The sliders were delicious, but the paella left something to be desired.

    "text": "I went to Firefly with some family visiting from out of town. I have experienced tapas restaurants before but never this one. There were four of us and we chose two dishes each and then shared them around the table. Everything was well prepared and tasty. If I had to pick a personal favorite from our choices, I would be between naming the goat cheese or shrimp. That said, everything was good and with multiple choices everyone at the table found things they liked and things they really liked. We finished with a dessert sampler that was also very good. The service was prompt, courteous, and helpful. The price was in line with expectations, about $120 for four satisfied people with tip. Overall, this was a good lunch experience. The only negative is that it is right behind the LV strip so traffic can be a little daunting. That's not the restaurant's fault though. It just is the way of life in Las Vegas.",

I'm not sure what happened, their service used to be top notch at the closed location. The placing of the tables in this new location are awkwardly away from everyone, so much so you seem so far from everything (especially your server). The atmosphere is red dim light and art all over but you can't really appreciate it since it's too dark to be able to tell what things are, or the color of food on your plate. I always get the sangria pitcher, which is my favorite. Red or white, both good. Dates wrapped in bacon with blue cheese is still a favorite of mine. The salmon toast aren't that good in my opinion. The rest of the menu of good too. Depends on what you like more, sweet or salty. I haven't been back here and probably won't be for a while. However, I'm hoping my next visit reminds me why I used to go here so often.",

I am obsessed with the bacon wrapped dates, the fantastic chorizo clams, stuffed peppers, MAC n cheese, petite filet is bomb!!!! Even the butter for the bread is amazing!!! I just got back from my bachelorette party out there and I am telling you that even my burbs were delicious after dinner. Haha!!! I can't wait til my next visit to Vegas so I can indulge in all the deliciousness firefly has to offer! To add one more thing... The berry infused vodka drinks they have are tasty and get you smashed! Until next time xoxo",

    "text": "If you're looking for tapas in Vegas, this is the place to go! My friends and I came here for dinner one night and ordered the Mixed Paella and 4 tapas to share. We also ordered a pitcher of Sangria. The Sangria was light and sweet. The Paella takes about 40 minutes to prepare so make sure you order that with your waiter as soon as you sit down!   They bring out a nice garlic herb bread with sweet almond butter while you are waiting for your food. my party ordered the ceviche, tuna tartare with taro chips, bacon-wrapped stuffed dates, and pulpo asado (grilled octopus). All of the tapas were delicious and left us craving for more but we knew not to order any more while we waited on our paella. The paella came out and it was huge! I do not understand how a paella serves 2-4 people. I cannot imagine 2 people sharing a whole paella. The paella was good with a nice assortment of seafood and meats. However, it was a little disappointing that the paella didn't have any soccarat at all. I understand that it was probably because they were in a rush to serve us since we were sitting there with no food after we finished our tapas. However, I would have rather waited for the paella to finish cooking fully.   Overall, good food, good service and nice atmosphere/decor! I would definitely just stick with the tapas next time though.   P.S. it is a little pricey but it's Vegas, right?",

The 2 stars is for the food ALWAYS being AWSOME at any Firefly location but honestly your palate gets affected when other things affect your mood such as service.  We were greeted promptly ... we ordered some cocktails & one of the guys ordered a bulleit rye on rocks while my man ordered it w/water. They brought both w/ water. Mind that both our boys are bartenders & love their bourbon & know the flavors. BUT we saw the bartender pour just Bulleit Bourbon & not Bulleit rye... also because the bottle was still sitting on the display. The fact is he had the odosity to come & say we ordered wrong & even though it was our fault he would make a new one. We said forget it...it's fine. The boys decided they wanted one more... & again we were watching as the drink was being made.. he poured the regular Bulleit AGAIN!! Brought it over & said it was rye... UGH! ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?!?   APPLE & MACHENGO SALAD $3.50 - absolutely refreshing with thin julienne slices of green apple & some cheese w/toasted almonds & lightly dressed.  STUFFED DATES $3.50 - bacon wrapped w/ toasted almond to give a crunch... sprinkled w/ Bleu cheese crumbles & drizzled w/ red wine reduction. A MUST dish whenever you go into firefly!!  FIREFLY FRIES $4 - large bowl of fries thin & crispy w/ seasoning.  Sadly DEFINATELY will not be back to this location...",

Finished up with the chocolate tres leche. I couldn't give 5 stars because the service was not great. Our server, Ivan came to our table...no greetings, no introduction, no smile. Basically asked us \"Anything to drink?\". Took our order, delivered the food and didn't come back to ask how's the food, need anything...we had to flag him down to order more tapas. It was disappointing and it was not busy at 9:30 pm. Nevertheless, we will return because the food is just too good",

The service is so on point that they refilled my bf's Arnold Palmer 3 times throughout our dinner, immediately provided a new knife for me when mine fell, and quickly came to retrieve each dish and glass that was no longer in use (Thanks Mario and Lenny). I have tried so many dishes, I wouldn't know where to begin! All I can say is that when a restaurant has a separate vegetarian menu and the dishes come out delicious and in under 20 minutes - I'm impressed!  I heard they had some issues before, but they have truly made up for what ever errors took place in the past and have continued to surpass my expectations for service, food, and ambiance on multiple occasions.",

Also yummy: Baked goat cheese Chicken salad Artichokes toast  It was very busy, my critique would be that I called to make reservations the day before, a left a message and they never called me back. I made reservations through open table and ta-da! Rsvp's for a party of 3 at 7:30 was confirmed.  This is a *must* try place when visiting Vegas!",

Reservation via OpenTable is recommended but do go back to the lady seating ppl when your reservation time is due because it gets busy and she might forget.  Paella was big and really good.

Full bar so order your heart out but be prepared to expect no conversation- the place is loud and at dinner time there are lots of people.  Still worth it - dinner for with Mixed Paella $76 (3 tapas, dessert, 2 coffees and a drink).",

Not something I recommend if your really hungry, the food did take a little longer coming out then I had hoped.  And its best to come with friends and share you plate.

    "text": "I must admit that I was a bit weary to dine here given that they were shut down in the past due to severe food poisoning, but a really good friend wanted to eat here and since it was her celebration and ultimately her decision, I went along with it. Another friend, who was also part of the group that ate with me, came here on her birthday and had nothing but great things to say about this location and she didn't get sick from it then.   The parking was a bit confusing. Up front they have a valet area and in the back of the restaurant is self park. When entering the lot, there was no indication that the back parking lot is self park. Here is where I got confused--normally the parking in the front is reserved for self park and valet is sectioned off somewhere in the back. So I thought that the back parking was reserved for valet. I decided to valet my car since I couldn't figure out parking and it was just easier for me to drop my car off. When the valet parked my car in front of the restaurant, I thought that was interesting that I valeted my car to have it within walking distance.   We had reservations already made so we didn't wait at all for our table. Right from the start, our server came by and asked us if we wanted anything to drink and since we were still waiting on one more, we just asked for water for the meantime. We also placed an order of paella since that takes awhile to cook and we thought it wise to get it started. Other dishes ordered were the shrimp ceviche and calamari. We also ordered a pitcher of sangria for the table.   Reasons for the 3 stars: -parking could be better indicated for first time guests -the paella said it could serve 2-4 people. This could be True if more tapas are ordered along with it, but we ordered it as if it was the main dish. When I imagine paella, I think of a big serving of it! -the shrimp in the ceviche were whole. I'm used to ceviche being cut up in smaller pieces and I've had better ceviche at taquerias -it wasn't as busy as it could be, but we still had to wait around and ask for our check several minutes after they cleared our table  I would come here again to try other stuff on the menu. Maybe next time with better knowledge of the place I'll have a different experience. For my first time there I would say that it was ok, but it wasn't spectacular.",

Tried all 3 sangrias and we decided the winner was the sparkling version (least sweet of the 3), although they're all above average, esp. the white. Scallop escargot was voted #1 of the 7 tapas we tried. I liked the bacon wrapped dates, but my husband liked the stuffed mushrooms better. Tierra Mar skewers were also fantastic. Bottom of the list was the mac 'n cheese which I thought was a little salty. Chocolate bread pudding w/ cherry, recommended by Alejandro, was also outstanding. Overall, a great night out w/ super service.",

Some of the better dishes we had were the shrimp tempura and the beef and mushroom skewers. The calamari would have been better if they had used the same batter as the tempura. We went at an odd hour, so the place was pretty dead, but it's definitely spacious and would be great if they hosted weekly salsa nights or something, I'm not sure if they already do. The staff are very friendly and you can tell they really want you to have a positive experience.

Went in with high expectations and boy we were not disappointed! The padron peppers were delicately fried (no hint of greasiness!) and piping hot. Some peppers were spicier than the others so order them if you like spicy. Our server was so pleasant and welcoming! He recommended several dishes , one of them the Camerones Diabla which was beyond delicious with the most complex sauce that was finger licking good. The refreshing artichoke toasts with a tasty aioli and the white anchovies with avocado were second to none and great palette cleansers because both are topped generously with fresh, chopped basil. Lastly, we ordered the eggplant cannelloni - 3 delicately rolled eggplant stuffed with airy goat cheese mixture - wow! We ended with the cherry bread pudding with port reduction and ice cream...it was beautifully plated . It was a feast for all the senses.  Oh, don't forget the sangria- we had the red and it was so flavorful with a perfect balance of alcohol and sweetness.  I wish we had another night because we would go back to try more tapas that we could not devour tonight. We have been fortunate to dine in some great places and when you come across friendly and attentive staff...neat setting...and food you would pay double for in other cities..Firefly is your kind of place! We look forward to an encore in the near future!!!!",

    "text": "Went here last Saturday night. We sat outside on the patio. The patio was so dark, it made reading the menu difficult to say the least, and I have 20/20 vision. Next visit, I'll make sure to sit inside.  THE SERVICE - awful, confused, unattentive. Our tapas arrived long before our silverware and plates, or water. I tried flagging someone down 3 TIMES to no avail. Finally, I had to pop into the bar area to request plates, silverware, etc. Not very good. Then, it seemed like we had several waiters, none of which communicated with each other. After we were almost finished with round one, another waiter brought bread to to the table and seemed quite confused that we were almost finished with the plates already on our table. So, word to management.....  TRAINING AND COMMUNICATION.  THE FOOD - wonderful! We ordered the stuffed dates.... OMG!! We ordered an additional plate! We also ordered the pulpo, the lamb sausage, manchego Mac n cheese (holy lord that was good!), patatas bravas and a couple of  other plates that escape my mind and a pitcher of sangria. The sangria was pretty tasty.  The quality of the food saved the experience. I will return to Firefly, I only hope that the service is better, otherwise, that will be the end of it, good food can only take it so far if the overall experience is not that good.",

My only complaint is that all of our tapas didn't come out at the same time, so it was more of a two course meal. Other than that, would definitely be back.",

Prices here are very accommodating for the quality of food and service.   Every tapas dish we had has been excellent.  I don't think you can go wrong here.  Our favorite is the Scallops \"Escargots\" (scallops baked in garlic-herb butter).  This is a must.  Amazing cocktails..  we've tied a few and I don't think you can go wrong here. They all had a complexity of flavors and excellent presentation.  There are very few restaurants that excel in every category and I can consider a \"favorite\".  I stop here every time I am in Vegas.  P.S. Jesus is an amazing server.  Very attentive and friendly.  He even remembered our entire order from the night before (yes, I wen't 2 nights in a row).  I have never had a problem with parking (there is parking in the back).",

    "text": "Great Spanish tapas for a birthday family lunch. All ages OK in the restaurant. We had a party of 7 and were quickly seated about 1PM. Jesus was our server and was very attentive throughout the meal. The warm bread served with the honey butter is always a nice way to start the meal, of course we had another hot batch mid way ;-)  We started out with waters and a pitcher of sparkling sangria. Very good and dangerous as you can barely taste any alcohol 5/5. We began with some stuffed dates which are... amaze balls 5/5! We also had a couple orders of the Firefly fries 3/5 and a tomato basil soup 2/5.   Since we arrived early in the day they had breakfast tapas available so we tried the Huevos Rancheros 4/5 and the brunch potato bravas 4/5. Camarones Al Ajillo were very good 5/5. We also ordered some of my favorites: Scallop Escargots 4/5, Tierra Mar Skewers 4/5, Albondigas 5/5 and another 2 orders of stuffed dates. To try something new we ordered the Petite Filet 4/5, Pulpo Asado 4/5 and fried calamari 4/5.  Overall a good lunch and everyone enjoyed the variety. For dessert they brought out a flan and sang Happy Birthday. The rest of us tried the Banana Beignet 4/5 and the trio of Gelato 4/5.  Thank you Firefly for making this a memorable birthday lunch! Will be back for Happy Hour as this is one of our faves!",

My group ordered pork empanadas, Parmesan fries, Mac and cheese, chicken skewers, fish sticks, and Italian beef mini sandwiches (forget the actual name). Not a bite left!",

Three girls/hostess were at the host desk, they were not welcoming, no smile , no greeting, just a \"how many?\" We said \"3\" and the girl didn't look at the books or anything, and was like \"30 minutes.\" There was no one else waiting. We knew someone that worked there so we called him and boom got seated right away. From this point on, everything was great! Our server was very attentive and always checking on our table. When our food came out, it was phenomenal. I got the steak and mushroom skewers, and my two friends got the filet minon, and the lamb, we like meat! Lol all three was soooooo good! We also ordered a pitcher of Passion Fruit Mojito, and it was very good and refreshing!!!!   All in all, great food, great servers, great ambiance BUT HORRIBLE HOSTESSES. I think hostesses are a big part of a restaurant operation, they are the first impression of the restaurant, and with those girls there that night, Oh NO, seemed like they were just there chit chatting and checking out guys, not doing their job. Should have been 5 stars, but garbage hostesses made 1 star go to garbage.",

I had the veggie empanada with was AMAZING. It was flavorful and creamy goodness, I can't say enough about it.  I'm vegan but the person I was with really really wanted the seafood Paella and it is for 2-4 people so I just sucked it up and agreed to share it. IT WAS SO BLAND! How can something so visually appealing taste like nothing? I was able to save it with the salt and pepper but after a 55 minute cook time (we were quoted 40) I was just over it. Save yourself the trouble and order something else from the menu.  If you take pics in the photo booth, expect it to take a week to get the email or text of your photos.",

    "text": "Firefly! Such a great place to enjoy little bites and drinks. It's a Spanish eatery serving tapas and cocktails in a lounge-like setting with patio seating.   I've been going to Firefly so many times in the past years. Long before they moved to this building, I used to like their old location too! Love the paintings on the walls. Very colorful, powerful colors (red, black) and the music! Especially love their Latin nights!   I had almost everything from their menu! I never ever had anything I would not like! All tapas, and big plates of paella delicious! Paella takes about 40-45 minutes to be prepared, so be aware of that! (But, they stated that on the menu, so everyone can read it. I'm sure most people don't read the fine print!) Anyway, knowing that, if you are hungry, I advice you to order the tapas first. They serve them fast! Almost all the time I order the Shrimp Tempura ( 4 large, very tasty beer battered shrimp with ponzu sauce), Steamed Mussels are my other favorite! It is actually a pretty big portion! Black Mediterranean mussels steamed with white wine, shellfish stock, leeks, lemongrass, lemon zest, lemon juice, tabasco, finished with butter, roasted tomatoes and spices. So creamy and delicious! It also comes with garlic bread! By the way, they also serve complimentary bread with herb butter. It's so addicting but don't fill up with it! Save yourself for the delicious food! My friends usually like spicy food, and they order accordingly! I, on the other hand, always stay with mild or no spicy choices!  Love the Albondigas (meatballs), Empanadas (last time I had the chicken), it was kind of spicy, despite the fact that I specifically asked the waiter to tell me if it's spicy or not. Anyway, it was very tasty! So no complaints!  Usually I drink Classic Mojito ($8), and if you like premium alcohol in it ($12). Most of the time drinks are pretty good. Occasionally, I experienced lousy drinks, especially if the place is super busy. I know, it's not funny, drinks should be always on point! But I guess it varies! I'm not a big drinker, but my friends are! LOL  Happy Hours usually on the afternoon! Specifically between stated hours! Deals are if you order a pitcher of Sangria or a pitcher of Mojito!   If you can save room for dessert, you won't be disappointed! My favorite is the Lemon Berry Tarts (very refreshing flavors), and the Chocolate Tres Leches (very light, tasty chocolate cake).  Vegetarian food lovers! There are so many different vegetarian choices on the menu! Everything is absolutely delicious!  I recommend Firefly for everyone who loves tasty bites, good music and great atmosphere! It's open very late, so it's a great place to stop by for a late night dinner and drink!",

My Hubby enjoyed two of the three Old Fashions on the menu, right there a treat to have multiple Old Fashions on a drink menu. Our server, Maria, was wonderful - when one of our dishes was not hot enough she took it right back, apologized and had a fresh hot one brought quickly. I love that kind of attitude - when you are paying for a dinner it should be prepared appropriately - right!!",

I will say they have very unique dishes on their menu. Lots of choices if you like to try new,original meals.   I usually get the sangria but this time I went with the lemongrass cocktail from the happy hour menu. It was refreshing and packed a punch (but not too strong). I also ordered the streak salad (not on HH) which I liked a lot. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I always receive subpar service. Food takes forever to come out every time and the servers are never attentive. I kept trying to get a refill on water and I just had to wait until she dropped off my food to ask. Not a bad place but definitely wouldn't make a special trip to visit here again.",

A Tapa should range between $3 to $5.   Tonight I ordered the 1/2 chicken trying to avoid the costly Tapas menu. What I got was a very tasty meal sauce wise, but the Chicken, or the Cardboard with Wings was terribly old.   I would have done better ordering from Pollo Loco and adding the sauces.    Always serve your best, 3 day old Chicken is not your best.  I would probably give this place 1 more chance. But not sure what they have that will turn it around for me.",

If you aren't allergic to peanuts you must try the Apple Manchego salad or the tempura shrimp !! Never had a problem with his location except for this one time , we had a party of people and the seafood paella took nearly an hour to make and when the food finally came out is looked as if it had been left out because it was cold and the seafood was super over cooked !! I gave them another chance and since that incident I have gotten nothing but great service from the servers .",

When we arrived it was pretty full already and I would recommend making a reservation if you have a larger party for sure on the weekends.  This is a small plates/tapas syle restaurant.  We were able to sit at a high top in the bat, which was perfecr for the two of us.  We ordered a few smalle plates and only the chicago style bocadillo beef dip sandwich really wowed us.  We ended up sending the grilled octopus back as it was very chewy.  We did order a pitcher of their famous sangria but it took forever for it to be made and we were right next to the bar.  I think it was an off night bc our server was definitely new and it was so loud we had to repeat ourselves several times to ensure she heard us correctly.",

It was the perfect temp to sit outside, it's not quite so loud on the patio which is nice especially since we were there for my dad's birthday. He LOVED the cucumber mojito, total win. The artichoke toast had a sorta weirdly heavy sauce that I didn't love but the mushroom toast and spinach salad were really good. The vegetarian was happy, sad the meat eater was happy and I'm a sweets person so...We ended with the dessert platter and I gotta say, that chocolate tres leche cake is amaze. For three people with drinks and dessert the bill was under $100 so I'll say that's a win. Our server was great, the hostess seemed sorta mean but maybe she was having a bad minute-no biggie.

They have a wide variety of items you can choose from, and basic items with a twist. They also serve paella that is made to order, so you have to give them 40 minutes to prepare.   They start you off with some garlic bread and their house butter. It was sweet, and balanced very well with the savory flavors.  We ordered the firefly fish sticks, and I was pleased with the crispness of the Japanese bread crumbs. The spicy tartar sauce wasn't spicy at all, but it had a slight kick to it.   The vegetable empanada was delicious. The breading had a wonderful texture; soft, buttery and flakey.   We also ordered ribs, that were doused in their mango barbecue sauce. The meat just fell off the bone. It was so soft and tender! The mango chunks and the sweetness of the sauce created a beautiful symphony of flavors!  Finally, we finished the meal off with a pan of chicken and mushroom paella. It was filled with flavors, that just made you want to eat more! By this point of the meal, I was already full, but I just couldn't stop eating.  To top it all off, we then ordered a chocolate tres leches, which was also very delicious. Super soft and moist! Tastes even better with the chocolate bits drizzled around the plate!  I had an amazing experience here at firefly. Definitely would like to come back to try their other tapas options. One of those places where you don't regret spending a bit more for some small plates!",

The tapas list is alittle overwhelming and wish It was a bit more descriptive on size of the items so we knew how much to order. We got the dates which were recommended, however the sauce was alittle too thick and gravy like. The flavors didn't mesh well for me. Then we got the ribs, Lamb, and tuna tar tar. Loved the tuna! The sauce on the lamb reminded me of the sauce on the dates. It worked well with the lamb so that was good. The ribs were tasty and a good size portion. The tapas can vary in size and can add up pretty quick so be prepared for that. For two people with 3 drinks and the tapas i mentioned above it was around $100+ with tip. I would definitely come back and try some other stuff.",

    "text": "WOW! How did I not know about this place any sooner?!  We came here for dinner on Saturday night and our server Carlos was just downright AWESOME. He was attentive, courteous, and offered excellent meal recommendations! I love that we didn't feel like we were rushed given how long the wait was and how crowded the place was. We got to enjoy our meal - people watch a bit and take in all the flavors of the amazing food.   Food - bring a huge appetite because this place will rock your taste buds. My favorite staple of the night was the Apple Manchego salad - order it!! It was crunchy and salty and every bit amazing. I almost wanted to order another plate to go as a late night snack post drinking. We also ordered the veggie empanadas, the petite filet, the firefly french fires and for dessert - the trio of gelato. If you aren't drooling yet - you should really re-read what I just ordered. The food came out as each plate was ready and it was nice and hot. I did think we could have lived without the fries. It didn't have much of a wow factor compared to the other dishes we ordered. The food tasted great and it probably now my go to place for every vegas trip going forward.   Amazing food - awesome service and no fancy price tag. Gotta love that! Be sure to make reservation. There are always large groups here so to avoid the wait, plan ahead. Also perfect place for group dinners!",

Bacon-wrapped dates: I was terrified to try this.. Because dates... But they were delicious ! Perfect balance of sweet and salty.   Chorizo and clams: much bigger portion that I expected. Essentially an entire meal on its own! The sauce is amazing and they give you a healthy serving of clams!   Mac n cheese: what can go wrong? one of my favorites!   Lamb skewers: totally shocked me and definitely my favorite dish. Again, portions were great and this can also stand as a meal on its own. The lamb was not gamey at all and cooked perfectly! Also lentils were flavorful and filling.   Tuna tartare: comes with taro chips that compliment the raw tuna very well! I wish there was a little citrus but it was still really good.  This is one of the few restaurants I've been to where everything I tried was amazing. I can't wait to come back here !",

They wouldn't take reservations  on same day (knock a half star for that), but we took a chance, just showed up at around 7:00 and were seated right away.  Surprisingly, there were many seats available for a Sat. Night.  We ordered 6 dishes and I specifically had a discussion with our waiter to bring a couple of dishes out, wait till we were almost done and then bring the rest.  So what happens?  They brought all dishes out at once!! For that poor service, I knock a half star.  Food was good.  Not amazing, but good except for a couple dishes.  Highlights we're the bacon wrapped dates, firefly sticks and ahi Tatar.  We weren't crazy about the stuffed peppers (cheese was just too heavy, thick and flavorless).  Also disappointing was the Tres Leches desert.  Too dense compared to others we've had in the past. The restaurant is nice, clean has a good vibe and we will probably go back with a larger crowd so we can try more items.",

To be honest, I think it was better than most of the paella i had in Spain last year.  It was full of seafood, and the rice was cooked perfectly al dente.  It was perfectly seasoned and the portion was HUGE.  We were all happy campers.  It's just a close cab ride from the strip.  It's moderately priced and there's something for everyone.

The waiter suggested the dates which we loved and can whe why they're one of the more popular dishes. I can't wait to come back this summer and enjoy dinner on the patio again. As a side note, Jonathan, the manager, truly took my dinner to another level. His level of service and care for our experiemcewas on another level.

They moved into a much larger place from the start so you can get in pretty quickly with a party but always make reservation if you have a large party.  The 1st favorite is bacon wrapped dates, just try it and you will be hooked. Plates are small so sharing is recommended.  The meats are awesome, albondigas(sp).  Etc.  I love almost all fish dishes, try to get the ceviche with fish or shrimp.  You should try the sangria's and order pitcher's, you'll want more after one.

When we told her we didn't order the first one, she gave us an attitude and insisted that we did order it. We originally ordered stuffed mushrooms but changed our order to mushroom tart when she told us that the dish I wanted on the picture was actually the mushroom tart- not the stuffed mushrooms. We ended up with two mushroom dishes. The stuffed mushroom was mediocre but the mushroom tart was superb! I didn't want to make a big deal out of it (although my boyfriend was a little frustrated.)   Later on, she gave us the wrong order... again. We ordered baked tetilla and got something completely different (I don't remember the name). We couldn't  eat because it was too spicy and frankly, it didn't taste good. My boyfriend was very upset. We ended up paying for food we didn't want and can't even eat because our waitress was not paying attention. She should start writing down the orders and repeating them back to customers to avoid messing up orders in the future. She caused us money that we did not want to spend.   The garlic bread was chewy, but everything else was great! The baked scallops were delicious. The petite filet was juicy and cooked perfectly (medium rare.) The red sangria and the pina colada were both awsome!  If it wasn't for the messed up orders, I would give this place 5 stars.",

I fell in love the first moment I had their food. It's hard to find any Spanish restaurant that actually has TRUE Tapas. This place has the best Tapas outside of Spain. The flavor of the food is absolutely mouthwatering and delicious. I have never been disappointed. I don't live in Vegas but when I visit, I have to eat here each time. It's a must!!! If you are vegetarian like me, they have a special menu for you. I wish they had more location but I am grateful for even having this one. The Sangria is also a must. And if you are a fan of Nutella, you have to try their banana Nutella sandwiches! Yummy!!!!!",

SUPER SERVER~ Jessica, I think. Very helpful and personable and even tho it was late she was friendly.  We ordered the garbanzo beans, FRICKIN INCREDIABLE!!!!!! More addicting that BBQ Potato Chips for me~ just DEEELISH! Ordered the dates, husband ate those said they were quite good. These are highly recommended on Yelp! The chicken Tinga Empanadas also FAB! And the sliders all . The Machego Mac & cheese disappointing, try something else as they have numerous options.     DEFINATLY will return, however the location on Eastern is more convenient from home for us.",

What I do remember is that the prefixed menu of about six course I believe was only about $80.. And on top of that the plates are unlimited! Say what??! I know, I still am trying to fully grasp that idea myself. For prefixed menu this is an amazing deal, let alone for unlimited plates. Also unlimited sangria/drinks included! I don't remember if it's just sangria/mojitos, or if other cocktails are included. I'm pretty sure they were.   The food was pretty good as well. I remember the scallops being delicious. We had sliders included and I only ate half of mine because I don't really like sliders and it tasted like a normal slider you would get at a TGIF. Mussels and the spicy beef salad were very good, I definitely recommend those. We only used the unlimited plate option for a couple items split between 11 girls and by the time our last two plates came we were so full. We ended up wasting a lot of food because we couldn't take leftovers with us as we were having a night out and didn't have time to go back to our hotel.   I definitely recommend this place for group outings.",

We ate here 2 times in 3 days if that says something about how much we loved this place.  It's a tapas place with a nice variety of dishes.  We ordered the stuffed mushrooms, the bacon wrapped dates, the mussels, some Asian shrimp dish, the apple and manchego salad, and coffee.  All the food was really great and the coffee was much needed after a long night of partying.    We came back again with some other friends and had an issue with their steak.  It tasted really weird and the servers were so great and accommodating.  They offered to make the dish again or replace it with any other dish free of charge.  When we didn't want anything, the chef came out to apologize and sent over a free dessert platter! AND they sent us the steak anyway, which I brought home to my husband (and he said it was delicious).    LOVED the food and the super nice service.  I don't think I've had such great service anywhere (except, of course, for those fancy pants places where it costs $150 a person).    Highlights were the bacon wrapped dates and apple and manchego salad.  I am definitely coming back every time I'm in Vegas.",

Dark curd, nothing to show a curb there, poor lighting, an overall reflection of a management/owner not really caring about the safety of its customers, a common thread for these owners.  Explains why they have had issues and have had to close a few establishments.  My mother law tripped over the curb and fell, the valet guy could have cared less.  Didn't say anything, didn't offer any help, management has no idea, a total lack of caring otherwise there would be plenty of lighting and a well marked curb just like the north side of the building, well lit with a bright yellow curb.  Like I said the service was good, the food came out fast and all tasted good, just disappointed about the outside and the lack of care for customer safety & if someone does have an issue, oh well not their problem attitude.",

If you are planning in going on a friday evening and you don't want to wait for a table for a long time make a reservation. The food was good. The tapas that I recommend are: the chorizo clams, stuffed dates wraped in bacon, baby back ribs, and lamb chops. The pitcher of red sangria was refreshing and very good. My son is Vegan and he had the tomato bread and the veggies and lentils. The coconut sorbet ice cream they had that day was out of this world. I also recommend the banana sandwich with nutela for dessert. I did not like the scalops escargot, pulpo asado, and the ceviche of shrimp. The service was very good and efficient. As soon as you are done with your tapas the servers clear the plates off the table. Selfparking is behind the building and it was full on that friday night so I had to use valet which is awesome that is free of charge. So I gave the valet $5 in and $5 out. I will go back again for sure and if I have guest visiting I would definitely bring them to this restaurant.",

Prices are fantastic and range from an average of $5 to $10 per tapa dish. I ordered the bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with almonds. Bacon-wrapped dates are one of my favorite tapas, so the almond was definitely a different texture than what I was used to, but still tasty. In addition, I got the veggie empanadas, which were quite savory. I was saddened that there were only two of those on the plate. My table ordered a pitcher of sangria for $28, which was a steal. Firefly* also has some affordable desserts, and so I shared the chocolate tres leches cake with a friend, and was more than happy with its taste and texture--not too sweet, and not too runny.  I am not sure about other nights, but definitely on Fridays, it can be quite loud with the live band, so be prepared to use your outdoor voice inside. The band, Space to Pace, played light salsa music. After seeing one of the waiters dance with a hostess, I really wish I knew how to salsa dance (note to self: take some salsa lessons). I love Latin music, especially the classics like, Oye Como Va and Guantanamera, which they both played, and so it was a treat to be there that night to listen and clap along with the band, as well as enjoy tasty, inexpensive food with great company. This will definitely be a go-to spot every time I go to Vegas.",

The tapas here are incredible!!! Mushroom tart, Serrano Ham Sliders, Scallops and ended with the Banana Nutella Sandwiches. All amazing! Typically, I get these with cheese in them because they mainly use Manchego which is my favorite. So, I highly recommend the Mac and Cheese and the Manchego + Apple Salad. We didn't drink this time because we had to immediately drive, but both the white and red sangrias are to die for.  Pitchers on pitchers! Go here, you won't be disappointed!",

We originally wanted to get the paella, but we didn't want to wait, nor did we have the appetite for the dish (it feeds from 2 to 4 people and there were only 2 of us...), so we ended up opting for the tapas. The tapas were delicious! The stuffed dates were delicious! Bacon! Dates! And a toasted almond in the middle! The croquettas were of course delicious! I'm not sure how that dish can ever go wrong. The stuffed peppers were super cheesy and good. My favorite, though, was probably the baked tetilla. This is essentially a large pot of baked cheese. Oh so good! The cheese also has some tomatoes and chorizo, so each bites has a bunch of flavors and stuff mixed into creamy baked cheese.",

I would've given it five stars but gave work because the service on this trip is not so good. The server system was excellent I waters were always fall. However the server himself acted like he had somewhere else rather be. I will continue to visit firefly for the great quality food.",

    "text": "This kind of reminded me of a diner that decided to re-brand itself as a tapas restaurant.  The space is large, with both indoor and outdoor seating.  The service was very efficient.  The menu was huge with sections for cold, hot, meat and seafood tapas.    The quality and preparation were not all that great, though.  Best thing about it was that the portions were huge.  The ahi tuna skewers and spinach salad was enough for two people.  The fish,however, wasn't of a good quality and it came in some gooey sauce.  The salad was OK, with pine nuts and artichokes and feta, but needed some vinegar and flavor oomph.  The merguez sausage was odd tasting, unlike any I've had before and quite spicy.  The octopus was mealy and came in a large dish with mushy potatoes and other mushy items - odd.  The serrano ham sliders came on awful supermarket hamburger buns and the burgers were of a low quality.  The fried onions as a side, however, were the highlight of the meal.   Considering the amount of food the prices are very reasonable.  Just like a diner.",

    "text": "Good tapas place off the strip. It's a really short taxi ride/drive from the Wynn end of the strip so don't be afraid to deviate from the main strip. They offer free valet here too so it's convenient if you have a car.  We went with a fairly large party of 9 and our waiter advised us to just order a few tapas at a time in rounds. They come out fairly fast so you don't have to be afraid of waiting that long. For the most part, he was correct, except our party was pretty hungry and scarfed up every plate almost immediately after they came to the table.... so if your friends are a pack of ravenous dogs like mine, you can order more at a time.   We ordered: Mixed Paella (one order is good for about 4-6 people)- nomskies. Legit Spanish cuisine.  Ahi tartare + avocado- standard dish you can't really go wrong with  Bacon wrapped stuffed dates- I don't normally care for dates but this was like CRACK. So good. Nice balance of salty and sweet. It's really small though, like 5 dates on a plate and one date per person is not enough   Fries- good but also forgettable  Lamb shank? Thigh? I forget which part but it was good. 2 pieces only.  Mac and cheese- nomskies in all it's creamy goodness  Stuffed mushrooms- nomskies,  I'd get it again  Some kind of stewed veggies + egg- meh I'd pass on that one   I can't remember what else because it just kept getting passed around the table rather quickly.  My other advice to you would be GET THE RED WINE SANGRIA. It's a little on the sweeter side but I think everyone can appreciate it, even those who don't care for sweeter tasting wine.   \"Take this all of you and drink it. This is the cup of my blood which will be given onto you and to all so that your sins may be forgiven.\"  If Jesus was talking about the Firefly red wine sangria then I'd be downing that all day and all night... like a mofkn sangria vampire or something.   Okay that's my advice, you heard it, enjoy your time in Vegas!!! :)",

My boyfriend owed me dinner, so I asked him to take me here last night. Not one of the tapas I had wowed me. For the price, the portions are exceptionally small. Three mini stuffed peppers for $9. A single cup of soup for $7. We left with a bill of over $80 (two drinks included), and I was still hungry. I would have ordered another tapa to fill me up, except nothing I had thus far was all that good, so I didn't want to waste even more money on substandard food. Most of the food we had was too salty, aside from one tapa that didn't have much flavor or seasoning at all.   At least the staff was friendly.",

Although, I could go with more crunchy toasted rice from the bottom of the pan. -Sparkling white sangria is so good and refreshing.  -Baked goat cheese was ehh...

We started off with ordering a pitcher of red sangria which gave us about two glasses each. Each of us picked 2 plates to being with. I can't honestly say I remember all of the plates since we were randomly picking off the menu. I can say though, as each one came, they got better and better. We were all pretty fully satisfied, but did end up ordering 2 more plates because we really wanted to try them out. We had steak, chorizo, shrimp and mango skewer, Ceviche, ahi skewer, stuffed peppers, Diablo shrimp, chicken skewers, goat cheese dip, petite filet, and mussels. They were all great dishes. We had absolutely so complaints. Service was great, staff were friendly and helpful. Place was nice and clean with attractive decor. Bomb!",

They're still located on Paradise but they have moved to a bigger and better spot.  This place has a bigger outdoor patio and is large enough inside for big groups.  While they have moved on to bigger and better digs, this didn't change their attention to detail when it comes to food or service. My only problem was that I came alone and since it is a tapas place I wasn't able to sample as many items as I wish I could.  Firefly is bigger and better than ever and definite worth a visit if you're in Vegas, it's a little off the strip but well worth it.",

    "text": "Firefly on Paradise  Location/Parking: If I said it's \"on Paradise\" you would probably smack me, so whatever. Google it.  Atmosphere: We saw a bit about Firefly on Paradise on the show Restaurant Stakeout a few months ago and wanted to give it a try. What a find! This is the kind of place you want to spend 3-4 hours at a time, nibbling on small plates of awesome deliciousness and drinking countless glasses (and by glasses I mean bottles) of wine. It's beautifully decorated with dark, bold reds, striking paintings on the walls, eye-catching chandeliers, and a big open dining room with several smaller sectioned off tables for privacy. Great place to meet up with friends or to have a first date.   Cleanliness: No issues. This place is spotless. The bar is clean, stocked, organized, and well lit. Glasses and silverware are always sparkly and shiny.  Service: Attentive without hovering. You can take your time ordering and no one is rushing you to take your plate away as you nibble. You can linger as long as you want before and after your meal. It's nice.  Food/Drinks: We always get the house Cabernet and it's always delicious. Only $5 a glass and it goes great with pretty much everything on the menu.   6/6/13 - We had the house Cabernet, Warm Spinach Salad, Chicken & Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms, and Baked Tilapia cooked with lemon, butter, and garlic. The bread is delicious. Fantastic meal!  11/1/13 - Tried a more expensive Cabernet and it was really nice. Had more bread than I care to mention, Artichoke Hearts, Lamb Chops, Chicken Tinga Empanada, and the Manchego Mac 'n' Cheese. Yummy!  5/29/14 - We had several glasses of the house Cabernet, bread, Chicken Tinga Empanadas, Ham and Cheese Croquetas, Stuffed Dates, and Lamb Chops. Delicious!  5/30/14 - Had the house Cabernet, bread, Roasted Eggplant Cannelloni, Boquerones, Petite Filet, and Serrano Sliders. Outstanding!  5/31/14 - Third night in a row. This is craziness. We had the house Cabernet, bread, Tortilla a la Espanola, Pisto, Camarones al Ajillo, and the Garden Variety Salad. Another winner!  8/4/14 - Came back for our wedding anniversary. Had countless glasses of the house Cabernet, Steak and Mushroom Skewers, Chicken Skewers, Bacon Wrapped Dates, and the Firefly Fries. Tasty! I could come here every night for a week.  Happy Hour: I don't think there is one, but who cares? It's all tapas and it's all cheap, so stop your bitchin'.  Price: Surprisingly reasonable for a place this nice. Anywhere from $5-$10 a plate. Really good quality dishes.  I've been here six times so far and it never gets old. It's forever staying on my short list of places I have to visit in Vegas.",

Ahi Tuna Skewers were the perfect little bite, there was pineapple in between each piece of tuna. Great idea! Love some grilled pineapple. Chorizo stuffed mushrooms weren't my favorite. They tasted like the mushrooms were pre stuffed and frozen.  Lemon tarts were cute, I just wish it was bigger. Not enough of the tart alittle too much crust. Flourless cake looked good, my girlfriend said it was delicious !  All in all, everything was great :) but I'll be back for that red sangria !",

    "text": "So I wrote a really scathing review of this place before it moved and when I walked in, I told the concierge. I basically got treated like garbage by the bartender because (I'm pretty sure) I didn't fit their hipster classy crowd. They reassured me that the place has vastly improved.  I came with Angela and Kent. We ordered about a dozen dishes here. I'm only going to mention the two that we would order again. The stuffed dates and the spicy beef salad. Everything else we had wasn't even ok. We also got seated outside and there were only two servers outside and we actually waited 5-10 minutes until we got our drinks! Seriously, have you ever waited that long for alcoholic drinks in Vegas? Yeah, it's like we walked into some pocket dimension not in Vegas. Our food also took a long time gettin' to. Even the bread and butter they give you, I had to ask for twice before we got them and they took their time also. What really made no sense was that we got our dessert before we even were served all our main courses! WTH? That's a first, never happened to me.   I will say that the sangria is pretty awesome here and the pear-ginger martini was pretty outstanding. Only reason why I'd ever come back, the drinks. But then again Angela made a good point that you can find better in Vegas if you looked hard enough. Yeah, probably so it's a question of whether I would go out of my way to come here just for the drinks. Nope.  So I'm really, finally done with this place. I was done before they moved and now I'm done again with this place.",

    "text": "I was seeking a unique eating experience off the Strip but special for a day trip to Vegas. My Special Lady Friend hadn't ever had Tapas and Yelp was recommending Firefly so I thought we'd hit it.   I'd been to a couple of Tapas places but looking on the app I've never seen such an extensive menu with so many types of Tapas to choose from such as Chilled, Seafood, and Meat and Poultry.   The space is pretty amazing with the romantic atmosphere and these awesome images of Flamenco dancers and Spanish art all over the walls. Great for something romantic or friendly or just stooping in for lunch on a day trip to Vegas. I'd love to come check it out on their Latin Night. The bar is a very stylish installation that should be a wonder when the lights are low.   Have individual captions on the Tapas that we ate. Our favorites were definitely the Bacon wrapped dates that had a nice, rich sauce to go with it, the Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms, and the Serrano Ham and Machengo Cheese. Each portion is sizeable and great for two people. The Ahi skewer was actually pretty meaty and nicely packed with fruit and a great garnish that completed the dish. I would have loved to try more of what they had on the menu.   My one complaint might be that during lunch rush our waitress disappeared for a bit but the bus boys and her fellow waiters made sure to help us out as best they could.   I'd totally recommend this place and would happily visit again for lunch. Many more Tapas to try.",

Based on yelp reviews, we thought we would give the paradise location a try. When I was about 15 minutes away, I called for reservations but was told that we couldn't get a reservation until 730. Clearly this wouldn't work. I asked about walk-ins. The young woman I spoke with told me I could have a 15 to 20 minute wait. I thought this was worth the chance and so we went. When we got there we found the restaurant nearly empty and had no problem getting a table immediately. Not sure why the hostess was so discouraging on the phone. We decided to order the chicken and mushroom paella ($24) with chorizo (extra$4) despite being warned that would take about 40 minutes to prepare. No problem, I nursed my beer and 40 minutes flew by. The paella was it worth the wait. Could've used a little more chorizo, but that's a minor complaint. Huge portion. More than enough for dinner for two. We've already made plans to return for dinner with friends in about two weeks.",

    "text": "During our trip to Vegas we ventured off the strip to go to Firefly.  At the end of the trip everyone said it was their favorite place out of all the restaurants we went to and I have to agree!  I made a reservation a week ahead of time for a party of 6 and they called the day before to confirm. The ambiance is dim lit, energetic, loud and fun!   It's the perfect place to go to with a group because you can try a little bit of everything. We ordered and ate family style and everyone seemed to enjoy it. All that was left was empty dishes! Some of our favorites were the stuffed dates, baked goat cheese, and the steak and mushroom skewers.   Out of the 6 of us 5 were sharing the tapas and 1 person ordered an entree. The tapas came out all at once, but our friend with the entree had to wait 15 minutes before hers came out so that sucked since we all felt bad she didn't have her food at the same time as everyone else. We could have clarified a bit better when we ordered. Since the tapas came out all at once I'd recommend ordering in courses especially if you are ordering half the menu like we did. The service was good and only got a little slow at times, but they were slammed so its to be expected.   In comparison to all the restaurants on the strip we visited, the food at Firefly was better and it was a lot cheaper since you aren't paying for the celebrity chef's name.   We also had fun with the GIF maker on the way out!",

The restaurants looks and feels sexy inside with the decor.  They had a long list of tapas categorized by proteins an also had paella's to share. My friend and I started our food adventure with the tomato soup and mini grilled brie sandwich ($7.5). the brie threw us off because were expecting the traditional grilled cheese flavor, yet it was good. The ahi tuna skewers ($10)were also a big hit with us; mango, basil, ginger-soy glaze, house pickles, and salsa verde is what this dish was mixed with. At this point with the, skewers, the soup and the complimentary bread they gave us we were getting a bit full, so we decided to share the delicious ribeye. A 14oz. ribeye with Firefly fries, aioli, red wine sauce and cabrales bleu cheese cooked medium rare ($29) was just the right thing to have. The meat and the pitcher of red wine sangria ($31) were complimenting each other perfectly.  If your into salsa dancing and great food, this is the spot to go. A lot of attractive people were around and both the restaurant and dance area are open late and is not too far off the strip.",

The food and service were great when I dined here for lunch last week.  There wasn't a wait for a table when we arrived for lunch on a weekday. I'm sure evenings and weekends are a different story. The ambiance of the restaurant is cozy and I could see this being a great spot for a date night. Our waiter was great about refilling drinks, checking in frequently, and getting food to us as soon as it was ready. There weren't any delays in getting additional orders placed.   I really enjoyed every item that we ordered. The menu offered a nice variety of dishes so everyone will find something they are sure to enjoy. All of the plates had a lot of flavor and I was impressed with everything I ate.  Roasted Beet & Persimmon Salad- the largest serving of the items we ordered, several really great flavors that came together well, loved the pecan crusted goat cheese and beets Stuffed Dates- my favorite tapas I tried, bursting with flavor and the texture was perfect Padron Peppers- one of my favorite pepper dishes I've tried, salty in a good way Empanada- serving includes two empanadas, the outer pastry was delicious and the sauce on top was great too Chicken & Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms- simple, but delicious Manchego Mac-N-Cheese- addicting, this was really yummy and was tastier with each bite, one of the heartier tapas options Warm Persimmon Cake- yummy, a moist bread pudding with delicious raisin gelato on top, a delicious dessert for sure  I'll definitely return and bring my husband for a nice date night!",

    "text": "All five of our senses are triggered.  Starts with the hearing, sight, and touch; continues with smell and taste.  Having an eye for art, interior design, and food presentation will be a bit of indulging.  With a strong preference for noise to drown out a hectic week, the task can be satisfied within the walls of Firefly.  All of the other senses will just follow.  Allow it... by starting with a Ginger Smash, Island Mojito, or a Pear Ginger Martini at the bar.  For the remaining flavor senses, manipulate them with a cool selection of tapas.  My faves are as listed:  Mushroom Tart - comfy smells appetizing Seared Tuna - wonderful highly recommended Calamari - pretty good nice with the sauce Grilled Octopus - soft good flavor, missing sticky rice hahaaa (no picture included) Bacon Wrapped Dates - stuffed with an almond WOWtastic! Baked Cod - good flavor but DRY (get it right next time) Beet Salad - salty... why?!!! (otherwise healthy)  There were more tapas ordered by others in our group of 11 people.  They had a good flow going with servers delivering them to our table.  Best to make reservations way ahead.  Even with a reservation it took almost 40 minutes to be seated after our reservation time at 8pm.  This restaurant rocks!  Friday night Salsa dancing happens in the side room past the bar.  Didn't try it; just letting people know in case they didn't yet.  Cuz no - not everybody knows everything.  4**** stars even if it was a little chaotic.",

    "text": "Right on! Knowing that Firefly Tapas reopened was fantastic news to me. I used to frequent their location on Eastern at the base of Anthem over the past years and when they closed, the dark clouds covered my blue Firefly sky. I have not had the opportunity to check out the Paradise location but when I was given the opportunity to on Friday night with other Yelp Elite friends, I jumped on it.   The vibe is pretty busy, sexy and swanky. The amount of people who were there was like visiting a popular New York restaurant on a Friday night. It was wall to wall humans but due to the size of the location it was better than said NY location. Although we had reservations, we waited at the bar for our table. It wasn't bad because I got to catch up with friends and drink a Ginger Smash. Excellent pre-cocktail by the way.  We ordered tapas. Lots of Tapas. Shared those lots of ordered Tapas. One thing I have always liked about the Tapas experience is that you can just try a bit of everything. Can one get full from trying a bit of everything, of course one can! I have always enjoyed their bacon wrapped dates. When they first closed I was sad, so sad because I have not found Bacon Wrapped Dates that even nail Fireflys. The added smoked almond does it for me. Most places don't add the almond so it just mushes. The ham and cheese Croquetas, stuffed peppers and beet salad are also a fabulous choice. I recommend those for tapas  ordered. You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu, so fun to explore Spanish style tapas here.   I hope to come back down soon, there are a lot of tapas that I want to try or revisit!",

Machego mac and cheese: nothing special, tastes like mac and cheese to me   Stuffed mushroom chicken: yummy and juicy.   We also got a Flan dessert with a crispy waffle like roll for our anniversary and it was yummy.    The complimentary bread looked really good from the looks of it but it tasted stale.   Make sure you make rsvp.  I saw a bunch of people waiting when we left (around 7:30pm Saturday).    I would come back to try their ham sliders, and paella.",

    "text": "I can't believe I have not reviewed this place yet, especially because it happens to be one of my absolute favorite places in Las Vegas. Mainly because it is so consistent in so many ways that I completely appreciate.   Ambiance-whether it's high noon on a Monday or midnight on a Saturday, Firefly always feels great accommodating, welcoming and prepared for your presence. The music is gentle during the day and a little bit more lively in the evening (which seems to mirror the general  joie de vivre that's present). Even the outdoor seating has its own sense of charm about it. Well, except for in the summer when it's just downright hell fire hot, but that's not the fault of FIREFLY.   Ease-Whether you are by yourself or with a party of 10, they never seem to have a problem finding a place for you to sit while also giving you great service competently and efficiently.  Choice- Because It's a tapas place you get a wide variety of Foods to choose from which make it easy to accommodate all kinds of taste palettes. There is also a full bar within the restaurant that is only slightly separated from the rest of the room but you can eat at the bar if you like.  Delectability-More than any other restaurant I've ever been to, Firefly has inspired me to try new things each time I come. Everything from the tuna tartare to the lamb chops, from the chicken salad to the paella, from the roast beef to the escargot, and from the mac&cheese to the patatas bravas; each  has been a taste treat I'd easily repeat.  Oh, and their Sangria is a MUST HAVE!!  Adaptability- dressed up or dressed down you will feel comfortable here. Whether you come from a formal event or just want to throw on something comfortable and run out for a meal, somehow you'll feel appropriately dressed in this atmosphere  Parking-even when this place is crowded there is always ample parking, which I appreciate. They also have free valet.  Last, but not least, The wait staff and hostesses are most charming and efficient. I have felt seen and welcomed with every visit.   FIREFLY is a great place to experience while you're in Vegas, so make sure that you do. If you happen to be a local, it's a great place for you to bring your friends that are visiting Las Vegas because it's always a winner! (and it's open late!) I just went last night and already I'm eager to go again.",

It wasn't too busy so our party of 3 was seated fairly quickly.   The menu had plenty of options - it's a bit overwhelming so we had a hard time deciding what to get. Everything looked so good! Some of the highlights of what we ordered: Tuna tartare - came with taro chips which you can ask for more if you run out. Steak and mushroom - two skewers of juicy steak with mushroom covered in magic sauce. Go for the medium rare!   The service was excellent, and the food came out very fast. Will definitely come back again :)",

We love to try different things and this is the place to do it. They have so many choices!!! Drinks are great too.  I always opt for their sparkling sangria. Sooo good.  I only wish they never closed their West location :( PS. I didn't know they do Latin nights on Fridays (maybe other nights too). It was a lot of fun to dance outside and just let loose.",

    "text": "I was really looking forward to going to Firefly given all the good reviews. However, the food was average at best. We tried multiple dishes. The tempura shrimp lacked flavor. The Mac and cheese was just ok. The chicken skewers would have been better if there wasn't a cream sauce on top of them; it was unpleasant. The patatas bravas was a bit soggy. Additionally, it's pretty loud so it's difficult to hear conversation.   We did enjoy some of the dishes... The filet was awesome! And the flourless chocolate cake and seasonal veggies were also very good. We were seated easily. Our server was excellent and the food was out quickly. The support staff was also good about running food and picking up old dishes. Prices were reasonable.   I wouldn't return but maybe we just picked some dishes that were subpar.",

On this occasion I did not go for happy hour but for those considering it i would highly recommend.    This place has a tendency to get busy so if going for dinner I recommend making reservations beforehand. There's a great staff that made sure to keep drinks full throughout dinner and service was prompt.  The restaurant is a little loud so just be aware that is can be a little difficult hearing people at your table if you have a larger group.    The sangria is a must for this place. I prefer red but all are good.  Get a pitcher, it's worth it.  Food is great and for a tapas place the dishes are quite large.  On this night we ordered the paiella which I have never tried here before.  You must put the order in early as it takes around 40 minutes to prepare.  It is a large dish and serves quite a few.  I got the chicken one with chorizo added. I'd probably recommend getting the seafood version instead as this is how the dish is traditionally made.  The bacon wrapped dates are also a must.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and son brought me here for my birthday dinner. It had been years since I had eaten here and I was so excited.  We showed up about 5:20pm for our reservation and were seated right away. Our server asked us for our drink order and told us that we could make either the red or white sangria sparkling. We decided to go with a pitcher of the red sparking sangria and boy did it not disappoint. It was delicious and had the smallest chunks of apples and fruit and that made it that much better in my mind.  The server gave us a small plate of bread with honey butter to start and man, was it good. That was a nice touch. We used the bread later in the meal with different sauces and with just the butter. Delicious!   For the food, my son ordered the fish sticks and firefly fry's. He loved the fish sticks, it came with an order of two and a spicy tarter sauce. He loved the sauce so much he asked for more to eat with his fry's.   My girlfriend and I ordered the stuffed dates, lamb chops and the apple manchego salad. It was all SOOOO good.   For our second round we ordered the tuna tartar, garlic muscles and escargot scallops. The flavors were mind blowing!!   Lastly we rounded it out with another order of stuffed dates and albondigas meatballs. We all enjoyed the meatballs but the stuffed dates.....there are no words to describe how good those are. By far my favorite part of the meal and girlfriend enjoyed the tuna tartar and escargots scallops the most.   We had a really great time, service was excellent and very attentive. The servers checked on us often, refilled our sangria and picked up empty places quickly.   I cannot wait to come back and try more of the tapas and have a pitcher of the white sangria.",

    "text": "I was on my last leg with starvation by the time we decided to go to this place, and was somewhat worried the food would not be expedited quickly enough for my growing hangriness.  However, upon arrival, we were seated quickly (it was just passed 3:00 p.m.), and seated at a small candle lit table. It was a very laid back atmosphere, but with an intimate feel due to the dim lighting. Despite the hour, there was a nice amount of patrons enjoying both their company, the drinks, and the tapas.    The service was a bit slow initially (it took a while for our waiter to come, and our water and bread took even longer).  However, after that hiccup, our server was mostly attentive.  As a side note, the gentleman serving our waters and food was a bit brisk and curt in many regards.  For example, he mumbled the entree being placed on our table, and the cups and plates were not thrown at us, but was not placed on our table in a very polite or gentil way (especially for the setting we were at). Anyway, I surmised he was just having a bad day or just has a more standoffish nature.  Who knows what has been his life experiences after all? Anyway, he managed a smile at the end with a bit of eye contact.  So maybe he was just a timid creature.  In any case, I grew accustomed to his disposition through our late lunch dining, for we sat for a while.  So now coming back to my hangriness which had by now transformed me to a desperate withering mess, I threw aside the substantive drink menu (since I don't drink), and scanned the main menu.  The menu lived up to its tapas name, as there was an extensive list to choose from.  Scanning through the menu for no more than five minutes (which is not my style), perhaps due to my ravenousness (not a word, I know) or maybe wonderful menu options, but I knew with conviction what I was going to order. Not only for myself, but for my husband as well (It must have been the hunger, or the menu, or the grumpy server, who knows?). It was a first ever!  So here it goes:  Bread and butter was complimentary.  The bread was a nice combination of soft and crusty.  The butter was soft, creamy,  and slightly sweet. It was a winning pair.  Tuna Tartare-  it was a nice mound of tuna mixed with avocado and infused with a sesame dressing that hinted some spiciness.  The taro chips was an unexpectedly great companion to this little entree.  I was very pleased with this particular dish.  Veggie Empanada-  I was a bit disappointed that it was just one( cut into halves) that came to the table. However, it wasn't too lonely looking as there was a small mix European salad, lightly dressed to accompany it. I think it ended up being a great contrast to the empanada.  The crust was crisp, and slightly greasy, but the salad saved it from being too heavy and oily. The filling was rich and savory, with the perfect seasoning.    Seafood Paella- (which is why we sat for some time. It takes 40 minutes to prepare as noted on the menu and reminded by our server)  I've never actually eaten paella (only with my eyes), but this was pretty good.  It seems the flavors become more and more developed with every bite.  I'm not too big a fan with overly moist rice, but this was very pleasing.  I enjoyed this dish tremendously, and so did my husband. Incidentally, if you are a seafood aficionado, you may not thoroughly feel sated by the amount on the dish, nor the minute size of the little creatures (I had to squint at one of the clams as I daintly extracted the little guy from the shell).    All in all, I really enjoyed this place!",

Men watch and stare at the girls and seriously keep to themselves.   This is a pattern I've noticed at many different salsa clubs in the city. On this particular night, the outdoor patio was where all the dancing was happening and my good looking coworkers were basically dancing alone or amongst themselves. Come on guys, get a grip. It's salsa...just ask instead of staring and watching.  Drinks are good and service was bomb. The interior restaurant vibe is super cool as well. I'll definitely go back to try their food and one more shot at the salsa scene here.",

It certainly lost its coziness.  My friend and I had a lengthy discussion noting all of the differences and how we didn't know how to feel as 'it's just not what it used to be'  Then the bacon stuffed dates came out, and all of a sudden, it felt like Firefly again, and we started to appreciate all the improvements including the significantly larger space and improved decor.  Food and Booze were still as good as ever.",

Like candy! We will definitely be back on our next business trip!",

    "text": "I haven't been here since they moved and I always enjoyed Firefly. A 30 min wait on a Friday was not bad and we were taken to a table within this time frame. We sat and it took  a bit for a server to come over so we made some food decisions before ordering a drink. Finally ordering a mojito it was brought back to the table with the worst sour taste to it. A new one was made with no issues and it was a little better.  -The food itself was up and down. The fries are always good and the Serrano ham and cheese plate was excellent. The clams with chorizo were bad, the clams weren't cleaned and there was grit in the dish along with broken pieces of shell. The Tierra y mare skewers which are my favorite were so salty I wiped them off with a napkin! just a nightmare. - service may be the worst. Waiting on drinks and trying to reorder food is like waiting in line at the DMV but with alcohol. Most of the staff was busy talking to a friend who sat at a big booth and sipped water for an hour while other parties waited to be seated. It was nice to see someone was being waited on.",

    "text": "Yes, you are reading this rating right 4STARS for Firefly.  At the end of this review I will explain why I did not rate 5STARS  With all the negative publicity that this restaurant has received it's time to put them back in the good light.    I was recently here for a team meeting, and I have to say that I was very impressed. This new location is AWESOME, valet parking in the front and ample parking in the back.  Hostess booth as you walk-in just like the old location but the update in the new location is now there is a WAITING AREA.  Helloooooooo, no longer do I have to wait outside, in addition to the waiting area the new bar area is big enough to sit and have a drink and not be elbowed by other patrons.    RESTROOMS - clean, clean, clean! and more than 2 stalls (sorry just keeping it REAL)  DINING ROOM - OMG, amazing you can actually walk through the restaurant w/o saying the following:  - \"oh, I'm sorry\"  - \"excuse me, can you scoot your chair in please\"  - \"it's hot in here, is the AC on\" , etc  Big parties can be seated and accommodated comfortable.  Firefly now has a extra room for private parties, that sits off tot he side of the dining area.  BAR - The bar is SUPER, more than 5ppl can sit at the bar now.  If you and friends want to chill at the bar and sit together, you can.  Open bar area, it sits kind of in the middle of the restaurant.  PATIO - couches outside, more of a lounge area now.  FOOD -   - STUFFED DATES: yummy! yes indeed, dates stuffed w/ blue cheese wrapped in crispy bacon. (I don't even liked blue cheese, but i KILLED those stuffed dates)  - MANCHEGO MAC&CHEESE: when you can see the grease of the cheese along the rim of the dish, know that you're in for a culinary delight.  bubbly cheesy goodness, mac&cheese comes out w/ that crunchy cheese top. you know how you throw food in the oven set on broiler to make it extra crunchy...YEP, and that's what come to you table. mmm, mmm, good  - ALBONDIGAS: juicy moist meatballs w/ melted parmesan cheese sitting in a bath of tasty tomato sauce.  NO really, the sauce is on point, I wanted to take the bowl and slurp but I didn't want to look like a fat a$$.  - VEGGIE EMPANADAS: crispy flaky dough, you hear that slight CRUNCH when you bite into the empanada.  the veggies are not all mushy or hard for that fact.  its a nice balance, it comes drizzled with some kind of sauce that matched very well  - STEAK&MUSHROOMS SKEWERS: um YEA! medium rare, i don't what type of steak but it was tasty.  it reminded me of filet mignon, it was so tender, when I pinched the steak to pull of the skewer it just slide right off.  If you are a mushroom person, then this dish will make you very happy.  They do not skimp of size or flavor  - BEEF SLIDERS: DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! no extras needed, don't ask for for any ranch, no ketchup, no mustard, no NOTHING. EAT AS IS, beef is seasoned perfectly, cooked medium rare, you take a bite and your teeth just sink into the beef.  OH MY GOSH, i'm getting hot over here..oh i forgot I'm still writing a review  GO TO FIREFLY'S you will not get SICK, I PROMISE.  They have cleaned house in there, I did not see any of the OLD employees there.  I was a regular at the old paradise location, I was familiar w/ all the workers at the old location.  The NEW paradise location is NEW all the way around.  The food is still GREAT   NOW, the reason why I did rate 5STARS is because of this one problem: With a new spacious restaurant and bigger restrooms there is still NO TOILET PAPER in the bathroom.  If you're a girl, go to the bathroom with a friend just in case you walk into the stall and it is out of paper.  \"hey girl, can you hand me some rough ass paper towels please\"  I'm just saying.....  Check out the NEW FIREFLYS on Paradise, it's good.  A good place for anything",

    "text": "Been wanting to try this place for a while now.   Deducted 1 star because it took a while for the hostess to realize their was people waiting by the stand and it was confusing. Most of the night people would just walk in think ing they could just sit anywhere or were actually looking for the hostess.   4 stars for the food and ambience. Very trendy, but somewhat casual atmosphere. This is definitely a \"Date Night\" Restaurant. Gets loud with large groups, so you may need to speak up with whoever you're with. The service was awesome! Our waiter was kind, he broke down ingredients and flavors in a lot of the dishes and helped determine some of the tapas we may enjoy. I ordered the Sparkling Red Sangria, very good. They have a lot of space for large and small groups. I noted one booth had a curtain with it, so even if you wanted to have a more intimate dinner you definitely could.  Favorite Tapas include Camarones Al Ajillo, Firefly Fish Sticks, and the Baby Back Ribs  You can easily do quite some damage at this restaurant and you're bill will reflect that. Walking away, I paid close to $75 on the bill for 2 people. So you can only imagine what you can do with more food and drinks.  All in all a good experience, and would like to return.",

He had a great helper Jazzey who made sure our plates were taken once done. Waters were refilled really quickly. This is what we had... Mango ribs... tender. Sauce was over powering Bacon wrapped dates...delish  Tuna tartar... my favorite Ceviche... good amount of lemon and came with these hand fried tortillas Mac and cheese... ehhhh Marinara sauce and a glop of cheese in the middle. BOMB with the bread Surf and turf skewers. Tender. Was excellent combo with the steak shrimp and sausage. Filet mignon on a bed of spinach and fried onions soooooooo tender We had a few more thing but we were starving from being out on the strip. Overall. This would defiantly be a place to visit again. 6 people. $150. A crap load of dishes. Awesome service. Quickly served. Food was prompt and hot. Thank you for a great meal.

Makes you feel like home.  Athena is professional, yet fun.  This place is a must every time I come here. Never ever ever had it let me down.  Great ambience. Great patio. Great food.

Danny makes a mean cucumber Bloody Mary - Omar is famous for his fun personality and mixology skills.

    "text": "Went here for a friend's bachelor party and we were rolling pretty deep (like 20 of us).  I was appointed to order for the table and was very glad to.  We got 13 different tapas (3-4 sets of each) and some paella.  The paella was OK.  If you get it, get the seafood one.  I've had some pretty good paella and it set the bar really high.  Make sure to start with their Sangria (I got the red).  It was delicious!  They say they marinate it for a minimum of 3 days and it definitely shows.  So smooth and bomb.  Pros: + Restaurant had a nice ambiance + Friendly staff (the owner came out and even bought us a couple rounds of drinks for the bachelor party). + Waiter was knowledgeable about the food + Huge selection of tapas to choose from (could make things difficult)  Cons: - Not exactly on the strip, but worth it for a nice dinner.  Food highlights: + SCALLOPS \"ESCARGOTS\" - these scallops were amazing!!  My favorite dish here!!!  They were cooked in the escargots container thing and the garlic herb butter hit the spot so well.  Definitely get this!! + MANCHEGO MAC 'N' CHEESE - super cheesy but very delicious.  Can never go wrong with mac n cheese + CHORIZO CLAMS - clams with chorizo in a sweet and salty sauce.  I believe it came from the clams and the the chorizo. + Lamb skewers - tender and did not have a gamey taste to it + CAMARONES A LA DIABLA - big shrimps cooked to perfection. nice and crunchy with a sweet and spicy chili sauce that complemented it very well. + STUFFED DATES - bacon wrapped dates... crispy bacon wrapped with dates inside. + TIERRA Y MAR SKEWERS - shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo sausage.  AWESOME COMBO!!! enough said.  I'd definitely come back to this place.  Just make sure to come with a decent crowd so you can order a bunch of tapas.

Firefly did not come close. The flavors were bold as tapas should be but it did not feel authentic. Something missed the marks. However, it is a great place to come with a big group and only a few minutes drive from the Strip.",

As a courtesy to the restaurant, we called an hour ahead and told them we'd be arriving at 1:30, and asked if they would mind seating us and taking an immediate order. They said it was fine. So we drive across the city, excited to eat at one of our favorite restaurants, only to find out that they would not seat us once we arrived (30 minutes before closing time). We informed the hostess that we called and she said it was her that we talked to, to confirm the reservation. She then went on to to explain that they decided to close early because they changed their mind. They did not bother to call us back. They were unapologetic, and could care less that two loyal customers had just driven across the city to eat there. It felt like they just spit in our face. I'm familiar with the restaurant business so I know it's not just the hostesses fault, but management is to blame. I'm disgusted that any restaurant would do that to someone. SHAME ON YOU FIREFLY. I'll be leaving this review on every outpost and review site that i can find. Hope it was worth it.",

Setting up the reservation, menu and contract was a simple process. The room was great, we had our own private bartender and the food was fantastic! All for a price that was very competitive. The paella, meatballs and dates were a few of my faves--delicious! The service was excellent! We had put together a 6 minute video for my mother--she had a bit of a hard time hearing it so they turned off the music in the entire restaurant--on a Friday night--for the 6 minutes so she could hear the audio. That was an awesome touch--great food, great ambience and great customer service! I would completely recommend Firefly and we will definitely be back!",

We had a main server and a runner whom both provided us their names and recommended dishes based on what we said we liked.  My friend actually asked for an iphone 4 chsrger and the waitress was kind enough to let us use her charger & she even watched it for us while it charged.

The only downfall was we didn't see the note on the menu that it took longer  for the paella to come out( I guess for cooking time), so as we ate all the other wonderful scrumptious tapas, we were all stuffed by the time the paella was served. It looked so delicious we all had to try it (stomachs protesting) and man it was soooooo delicious! It was by far the best paella I've eaten. The seafood was not overcooked, rice perfect, wonderful spices! All the tapas we ate were delicious! The staff was very attentive and friendly.

Only a hop and a skip from the strip and plenty of parking.  We'll definitely be back on our next trip!!",

The sangria is the same and I had two glasses. My sliders had chewy meat so I gave up on those and my boyfriend didn't like his chicken empanadas. He got ahi tuna and he ate the whole thing and like it! We got the peppers and they were delicious! We got the dessert platter but next time I'll just get tres leches. Coming back again .",

And the red sangria was better than the white but definitely not the best I've had. The ambience was great - djm with red and black decor, which matched perfectly with our bachelorette party attire theme of red and black :) only downside was that it's off the strip and it was a pain getting a taxi from there. May want to get a taxi number and call them in advance.",

For a drink I tried the cherry mule, as I suspected it was pretty sweet but good flavor, would have preferred a little more ginger beer. For food we tried the baked cod which was fsntastically amazing. Albondigas (meatballs) were also pretty tasty. Chicago beef bocadillos, something went horribly wrong with this, one slice of meat was downright terrible, tasted really old with a bad texture, not good at all. Petite filet was pretty good but I've had much better, was good flavor but not super tender. Not sure the mushrooms and cream cheese paired all that well either but it was good overall. Chicken skewers were good but underwhelming, not what I was craving.  Service was excellent, didn't feel like bringing up the bad price of meat but I'm sure if I did they would've handled it.",

Having worked in the industry, I can confidently say that a place that has undergone such public humiliation is not going to drop the ball again. I am sure this place is now cleaner than one of those crazy decontamination suits in Outbreak. But, unlike that movie, Firefly does not suck. This place is the bee's knees. Try getting quality tapas at such a very reasonable price elsewhere - I dares ya! This new location (about time!) is much larger and nicer than the last joint. The once overly packed patio area is now open and spacious, and the same goes for the interior. The cramped bar has been traded for a full encompassing rectangle of drinking goodness. And the food lived up to the atmosphere. The bacon wrapped dates are a stalwart, and not to be missed. My only knock is the bread. I have never cared for it - hard and flavorless (closer to a cracker than bread). Although, it could be a blessing in disguise, as skipping he bread leaves plenty of room for countless small plates. Hopefully people start coming back and filling up the patio again, as it would be tragic for Vegas to lose this local dining icon.",

    "text": "My husband and I were in Vegas in October and couldn't wait to go back to  Firefly! When we heard they shut down we were so bummed. I just loved the atmosphere at the old location. We always take our friends  whenever were in town. I dream about the pardon peppers and bacon wrapped dates. We had no problem getting a table around 8:30 or so on a Monday night. The new place seemed almost bare it's so much bigger. We sat across from the kitchen next to each other looking into the kitchen thru the swinging door. Not what  we had in mind . I hate being to close to the kitchen traffic. We decided to move to the bar. It's a really nice addition. We were the only ones at the bar when we sat down. By the time we left it was 3/4 full. Restaurant appreciation night I believe. We always order red sangria but heard the white was really good. Our bartender offered to let us sample it . We still went with red. 2 of us will down a pitcher!  We are in Vegas you know! We were brought some yummy bread and omg! That butter is the best stuff ever! I forgot about the butter!  We ordered our usual , 1 order of bacon wrapped dates, then pardon peppers, such wonderful chile flavor not spicy a little salty, I believe they are flash fried, but I think the order was a little smaller than it use to be. They are so addictive. I found 1 place in Denver to get them but not the same  restaurant vibe. We decide we need more dates and then the cream cheese stuffed peppers. The sauce and cheese and peppers! Yum! Our bartender told us about the garbanzo beans. We had never had them roasted in the shell before. We liked them.  And then more stuffed peppers! That was our fav. Dinner in Vegas as always. Just sit and graze. Every bite was a party in my mouth! The bartenders were on top of the water and plates and very friendly. The manager stopped to see how everything was and we chatted for quite a while.  He was eager to hear our comments. When he found out we were in the bar biz in Denver he even gave us the locals discount! That was a really nice thing for him to do. I can't remember names as it's been too long. I should have written this sooner.  But life happens.  The food is as good as ever at the new location.  The atmosphere in the dining room I'm not sure I'm sold on. Something's missing. The kitchen really stands out too much. It's just really open for everyone to see. I missed the intimacy of the old place. Will we be back? Absolutely! If it's warmer I'm looking foreword to sitting on the patio! You guys do a great job!",

Arrived around 6pm and although the large dining room looked like it had space, we opted for bar seating and found seats immediately.  The tapas here are at least twice the size of a normal order and easy to share. We enjoyed a bottle of wine, the bacon wrapped dates, pork empanada, clams and chorizo, the octopus, and the lamb chops. Every option was cooked to perfection and delicious! We made the mistake of ordering a little too much just because of the portion size being larger than anticipated. It provided the substance we needed before a night of drinking at a concert. The icing on the cake.. our wine and feast were all for under $100!  I think I just broke $100 with a $20 tip. We will definitely be back because the service at the bar was fantastic, the food was on point, and because there is so much more that we would love to taste from this menu.  Off the beaten path.. and well worth it!!",

Truly amazing!  Our party of 3 finished two pitchers (it would have been more had we not been \"forced\" out).  It was SO noisy inside with little acoustic material to absorb sound so we asked to sit on the patio. It was a beautiful fall night!  We had the dates, shrimp ceviche, tuna tartare, baby back ribs, skewered meats, and caramel flan.  All the food had a rich flavor, and everything tasted very fresh. The sauce on the ribs was sweet yet savory.  Everything was perfect until the salsa band showed up. Girl #1 started moving tables to make room for dancing by dragging the metal tables across the floor. It was so loud & the pitch was so high that it hurt my ears....like nails on a chalkboard!  Seriously?!?!  There were still 3 tables enjoying their meal!!  Then girl #2 approached each table & basically told us to leave because they were going to play music & dance. WTF?!?!  After telling the server that I was upset, we paid our check.  When we arose from the table, these people had all their band stuff around our table & we couldn't even exit the area!!  SO RUDE!!!!  Had the manager approached us earlier to let us know what was going on, we would have taken our group inside to drink more sangria. But instead the server kept apologizing.  So we just left.   If I do return to this restaurant, it will be for the food & I will NOT get in the way of the rude conceited self-absorbed salsa people. Just plain ridiculous.",

    "text": "Eh.   I used to adore this place. If I was able to Yelp Firefly years ago, I would've given it four stars.   I've been eating at Firefly for over ten years. I brought my boyfriend there last night because I used to love the cozy, intimate atmosphere and great food, and I wanted us to have a cute date night before he flew back East.   It turns out the restaurant moved (to the old Z Tejas Grill building down the street?), which is a much bigger space. The atmosphere is gone. It's now a busy, loud restaurant like any other place in Las Vegas. I realize that the old Firefly was popular and always packed, so I see the need to expand. They just lost the charm in the process.   I suggested we order the Serrano sliders, mushroom tart, and Manchego mac and cheese, because I've had them before and they were always great choices on the menu.  I felt like even the quality of food has changed, because I wasn't really impressed by any of the dishes.    I gave Firefly two stars due to the fact that they changed so drastically, and not in a good way.  The food was not terrible, but it wasn't as flavorful and visually appealing as it was in the past. The mac and cheese was excellent, but the sliders and mushroom tarts were bland.  The chicken empanadas were boring and the lemon tart dessert tasted like mass produced tarts defrosted and topped with a few berries and whipped cream.   I doubt I'll ever come back here and that makes me sad.",

    "text": "Located just South of the Strip, Firefly on Paradise has become an essential stop that brightens the already ecstatic Vegas experience usually felt by yours truly.  This place oozes Vegas in all senses. From the dim lights above, to the bright lights around the bar and along the walkways, the banter, laughter, cheers, showoffs, care-nots, great service and what matters the most, GREAT food.    The wait was (and usually is) relatively long as we entered the packed house. It was just my sister and I.. that being the case, we noticed a couple available stools bar-top and nabbed them on the (fire)fly. It's not necessarily the case in ALL restaurants with a bar, but I noticed that because there's more action here, you'll probably get an attentive bartender, prompt service and  a quicker food turn around time.   Spanish tapas / small plate style.. Ladies and gentlemen, this means you'll be eating more than one dish tonight!    First dish that was placed before us was the chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms.. though quite small in size, they definitely pack a punch when it comes to flavor.. probably because of the chorizo.  Second, Serrano Sliders.. mini burgers with Serrano ham, bleu cheese & crispy onions, cooked Medium rare; Not sure why we ordered mini-burgers.. they played the 'void' filler until our next dish arrived. I enjoyed the bleu cheese, but asked for medium rare and they came back to us a little too well done.. dry & crunchy. They happily replaced them and got us a new order within minutes. Very nice service.  Third, Steamed Mussles.. steamed in white wine with an heirloom tomato, garlic, herb butter with parmesan crustini. I'm not even a fan of the things, but the Mussels were the best tasting seafood item that I've had in a quick minute. It's really the sauce that made it.. the best way I can describe it would be the equivalent to a creamy Alfredo, minus the pasta. It masked that 'fresh out of the water' taste, which I don't mind.  And Fourth, the item that stole my heart.. the baby back ribs covered with an out of this world BBQ mango sauce. Fall off the bone tenderness covered with a sweet finger lickin' sauce that'll have your tongue and lips slurpin' and smackin' through every bite. I'd get a full rack of these alone. Straight up, yo.   Our bartender was on point; we were continuously checked on, had our waters refilled, if my beer was low another was offered (this is how you keep me here) and aside from the slider mishap.. everything here was tasty and the atmosphere sparked the perfect start for our night. We'll be back to explore the rest of that menu!",

Sometimes my wife and I, and sometimes friends, really want to go out but we don't want a full dinner.  That has been hard in Las Vegas because we haven't found a Tapas Bar we like here.    I am happy to say we finally found one we liked.  My wife and I really enjoyed Firefly.  Great selection, great service and atmosphere.  We will definitely be back.",

The reception was set up outside on the patio area and was well decorated. The staff were nice and even though I'm not big on tapas food it was served as different samples and some things were very tasty. I was pleasantly surprised this time around.   The one thing that stood out is the parking is in the back of the building and there are signs to lock your cars and hide belongings. Maybe there have been car break ins??? Not sure but it was a concern for me.",

Only after we ordered their Firefly fries with cheese on the side and my friend stated that I was vegan was I offered the vegan menu..and our server was vegan. How did she not think to offer it from the start? Yes, there is a menu that features vegetarian, vegan and GF options. I've suggested they offer it to guests when giving the standard menu. Hope they run with that.  Think they'd have a lot more people talking about their attention to dietary preferences.  So from my humble vegan opinion you should have the artichoke crab cakes and heirloom carrots and go from there if you are still hungry. Both are amazing and my non-vegan friend even agreed.   From my humble beer lover opinion they have a nice selection of drafts and of course their sangria is kinda famous in this town.",

Most of them were 10/10, besides the Veggie Empanadas. The cheese sauce drizzle didn't do it for it. I rather of had it dry.   Firefly knows how to take care of their customers. They even set up a long table for a big party of 20 for us even though we were seated in the back corner separated. Special treatment to make their customers happy equals 5 stars in my book!",

The ambience is calm (unless you come on Latin Night) with dark lighting giving it a nice intimate feeling.   We ordered several different items but like everyone else, the all time favorite is the bacon wrap dates. If I could choose one tapas to have for the rest of my life, it would be these, but I would probably become overweight extremely fast!   It's a great restaurant considering majority of the items are small allowing you to try more food items at once. They also have larger entrees which are just as good.   The only downside to this place is parking. Parking is so limited it forces you to valet and sometimes valet is full! Please note a few years ago they were shut down due to health concerns, but I have yet to experience that. Fingers crossed that I never do!!!",

We had just enough time to finish our drinks before our table was ready.   There are so many options on the menu I suggest you start slow and order a few dishes at a time. The stuffed dates, and the Tierra y mar skewers were my favorites of the night! And the sangria pitchers are a must for the table...sooooo good!   The waitstaff was super friendly as different people came around dropping off and clearing plates throughout the night. One thing to note is that the food comes out in whatever order it's ready in. One dish we ordered the first time around was the last to come to the table and we almost thought they were going to forget it! But it was worth the wait.   I'd definitely go back to try a few more things we didn't have room for and for that sangria!",

This is a go-to spot in Las Vegas, especially since it is located a little away from the chaotic strip (and there is parking). I visited Firefly both times I was in Vegas since my cousin who is a local introduced it to me. My go-to's are the tuna tartare w/ taro chips, bacon wrapped dates, and ham and cheese croquetas. The gelato was nothing great but I would recommend the flourless chocolate cake for dessert! The portions are small and don't leave you feeling gross after eating--which you don't want to feel like when you're in Vegas heat and going to be walking around all day/night. You just get a good taste of everything.   Not so positive but still ok...  The chicken-skewers here are nothing spectacular, and my friend ordered the sliders which I thought were average--but I'm not a sliders fan to begin with. I'm not a fan of the sangria here but it's also partially because I've been making my own sangria. It seems like the fruit hasn't been properly soaked in liquor, more wine needs to be added, and they could def use more variety of fruit besides apples/oranges (cheapest fruit you can find -_-).    Overall, I'm such a fan of the tapas I listed that I would come back anyways esp for a midday lunch or light dinner. Cheers!",

Any way, what did we order?  1. 2 pitchers of Sangria (one white, one red) Both tasted good! Comes with infused apple pieces.  2. Bacon wrapped dates. These are off the charts! Crispy and extreme flavor! 3. Manchego Macaroni and Cheese; the best cheese to use in this dish - so decadent! 4. Tuna Tartare  with Taro Chips; this is really good and refreshing. Tasty! 5. Steak and Mushroom skewers. I wish I knew what kind of sauce they use for this cause it's fabulous!  6. Ham and Cheese Croquetas - manchego cheese again! Yum! Some thought it was a bit salty; but I love salt! LOL. 7. Baked Cheese; whoa! Didn't think I'd like it, but I loved it! 8. Firefly fries; great combo with the Sangria; carbo load while drinking! Plus their fried to perfection and has a great seasoning! 9. Paella! Whoa! We got the seafood one and it was a great ending to the rest of our tapas! It was able to give a sampling to 7 people and everyone loved it!  You can't go wrong with anything you order here. Everything tastes so good. I have brought friends and family alike here, and it is ALWAYS a winner and becomes a favorite to all! Go now!",

The food was excellent, the service was beyond expectation and the atmosphere was conducive for a relaxing good time.  Somewhat nervously, we made the arrangements over the phone sight-unseen with Regina & Fernanda and nothing was less than promised.  Regina was onsite throughout the event and was very hands-on to ensure that all went smoothly.  The Firefly Tapas Kitchen is highly recommended.",

There is something here for people of nearly all tastes and as others have mentioned all of the Paella variations are excellent. The tapas are small and relatively inexpensive allowing even a smaller group to sample an impressive variety of dishes. Definitely worth a try.",

The entire Staff is so happy to serve. They greet you with a smile, they serve your food with a smile...everyone here is so happy. Definitely will be stopping by every time we're in Vegas. We had the fried calamari, Mac and cheese, tuna tartare, firefly fries, Tierra y mar skewers, mushroom tart, muscles, and beet salad. Along with the free bread they serve with almond butter. Awesome! Best place we ate at during our Vegas trip. Love love love this place! Must try!",

Also checked out the yelp reviews and saw the raving reviews. After 11 hours of walking and working, I was SO EXCITED to get my tapas and sangria on.   I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED. There were 4 of us and the waitress suggested we each order 2 dishes. 8 dishes came out and all 8 dishes were sub par. All the proteins we ordered were either over cooked or over salted. All the veggie dishes we ordered were uninspired or under seasoned.   The saving grace was the sangria. The red sangria here was amazing. You can definitely taste the fruit coming through the wine. so yummy! Maybe if I had a couple more glasses before the food came out I would've enjoyed the tapas more. The ambiance here is also really cool and casual.   I'd probably only come back here for drinks and bar food.",

(Some are even more than 40%). We asked why & they blamed it on Yelp that they had no control over changing the prices on the system and offered 10% discount. We just left the place as we didn't like their approach to their customers. Then we found out that we were not the only ones who are misled.  There are lots of quality options in the area with great taste & worth the price.",

Each dish was large enough for everyone at our table of four to get a portion. It makes me want to return for paella. The Red sangria was also delicious. Of note were the empanadas, Albondigas and shrimp diablo(?). Disappointing goat cheese dish. Lots of manchego (sheep cheese) dishes, including their take on a mac and cheese.

But we could've done without as we enjoyed the other dishes way more! - Ceviche - So fresh! Be sure to ask for extra chips, it's not enough! - Mac and Cheese - Pretty tasty but also pretty standard compared to most other restaurants.  - Babyback Ribs - The meat fell right off the bones and was so tasty with their mango bbq sauce.

Amazing!  They worked with us to create several smaller checks to make it easier to figure out our large groups bill and did a phenomenal job at getting us all our food and drinks.  Now for the food.  I have travelled extensively in Europe and this rivals some of the best Tapas I have ever had.  There is literally something for everyone including kids.  I had the figs, two different empanadas, the pulpo and spicy salad.  The figs and pulpo were unbelievable and the empanadas were cooked perfectly and just re right spices.  I sampled the chorizo stuffed mushrooms and shared the seafood paella and can say the only negative thin I can mention is the paella was slightly more salty than I prefer.    Overall, an epic meal that when combined with the service and laid back no rush atmosphere will be remembered for ever.",

Had several different appetizers and main dishes. Since my Spanish is no bueno will not even attempt to put down what we had but it was all very good. Nice flavors and everything was done to perfection. Will definitely go back maybe even this trip it was so good.",

The octopus was particularly delicious, as was the mushroom toast, the artichoke toast and the stuffed dates.  Fun place with tasty food!",

I totally recommend the avocado toast which is topped with heirloom tomatoes! Not heavy and just right.",

We started with bread and butter for the table, but the butter was far from average. It was sweet and slightly spicy. We then moved on to a salad with hearts of palm, oranges and feta which was decent. They also brought out chicken breasts with interesting seasoning, but the real star of the show came later. We had a seafood paella which was incredible and contained plenty of fresh shrimp, mussels, clams and artichoke hearts. Lastly, we closed out with filet mignon medallions with blue cheese and crispy onions. Dessert was a chocolate cake version of a tres leches cake that tasted like German Chocolate cake. Very tasty, but i can't wait to come back and try more tapas!",

I also ordered the tamarind margarita and it was so strong I could not drink it. When I told the server he still asked me if I wanted it to go. He never once offered a different drink or anything and he still charged me for the drink. This place is a joke I would not go back and it is very sad because I use to love going to eat here.   Update!!!! I went back a couple of weeks after my review and I must saw they went above and beyond what I expected. We tried the apple salad and it was amazing I must say the whole experience was great. I definitely recommend this place for a great date night like me and my boyfriend did. Thank you to the manager he was amazing he made sure everyone was having a good night!! I will definitely be back again!!",

Service was incredible and prices are very reasonable. We thought we were going to pay al least $50 per person (we were a party of four), we were surprised when the bill came up to $117, we had food left over and we all got drinks.   I wasn't able to try to it but my friends said the butter that came with the bread was incredible. Also they had croquetas that because they are breaded I was not able to try it.  Notice the purple stick on all the meals says \"allergy\" is to show that someone on the table has an allergy and they prepare the food in a different part of the kitchen to prevent cross contamination.  I highly recommend this place!!",

We ordered about half of the tapas on the menu and we found them all delicious. The sparkling sangria is delicious as well..strong yet fruit at the same time. The butter that accompanies the complimentary bread is, in all honesty, finger-lickin' good and I wish I had the recipe! Oh, and the desserts are just to die for! We ordered the dessert platter which included the caramel flan, chocolate tres leches cake, lemon-berry tarts, and passion fruit cheesecake. To say that these deserts were exquisite would be an understatement!   The service was great as well, zero complaints there! The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is that the atmosphere was not what one would think one when thinking of a Spanish tapas restaurant. We expected it to be more lively and vivacious but it was more quite and mellow than we had hoped. Still, I highly recommend Firefly!",

We've been here multiple times and we've always been completely satisfied with our experience.  Reasonably priced, live music (sometimes), and good sangria. Our faves are the bacon wrapped figs, Serrano ham sliders, calamari, mussels, empanadas, and patatas bravas.  Paella is awesome as well, but beware, it's HUGE. Great to share for a large table, but for two, you're going to be stuffed if you order the paella and two dishes of tapas.",

I live in LA, where \"tapas\" are like $20 each and you get a serving that looks like a Costco sample. I was hesitant about coming here but I wanted to try and be a good son for once so we tried it out.   The menu is HUGE. Lots of options that made the decision difficult so we just said funk it and ordered a bunch of stuff. Avocado toast, chilequiles, steak and mushroom skewers, calamari, a couple other things I can't remember, and the chicken mushroom paella. The paella was decent, nothing groundbreaking, but all the tapas were DELICIOUS. And affordably priced for the generous portions. I was surprised. We didn't really need to eat the paella by the time it came out but we're American so obviously we didn't just stop eating when we were full. Come on.  Service was kind of bad, but the waiter made up for it by offering a complimentary espresso and a flan for my mother. I didn't eat any, but my mom said the flan was amazing. Now she's inspired and sending me pics of her in the kitchen at home working on her own flan recipe. Thanks Firefly...you inspired a new chef.",

There's a huge bar in the center if you prefer ordering drinks or some small dishes asap. Servers were very friendly and accommodating. I was worried that since we had such a large group it would take a while for all our orders and it was a busy night but, absolutely no complaints! All food came out on great timing and was fresh and so delicious. I didn't get to post all pictures of everything I ordered because it was so good everyone ate it too quickly.  **I recommend the stuffed dates & manchego macncheese #perfection  Their paella is also very delicious! Order that first because it takes 40 min to cook and serves between 4-6 people.  Overall it was so much fun for a birthday dinner/party  10/10 experience  I'll definitely be back again with more friends, probably during their happy hour from 3-6",

So many great bites to choose from, some of my favorite are the Ahi Tuna Skewer, Steak & Mushroom Skewer, Baked Goat Cheese, Camarones ala Diabla, and Camarones Al Ajillo. The Stuffed Dates are usually my top pick, but they skimped on the goat cheese and the dates where tiny and dry this time.

    "text": "I still like the original Firefly best. But alas, they moved on to another Paradise location, pretty much next door to where the original was. Sure, it's bigger and newer. But it's just not the same. The prices have dramatically increase over the years. Most tapas have gone up $2-$3.50 each. So it's no longer as cheap as it once was. But nonetheless, it's still a decent cost-quality trade off. So, in other words, the food is tasty and the prices ain't bad (even if they are steeper than they used to be).  And while I miss the old place, I do have to admit this newer version is quite nice. It's just intimate enough, just dark enough, just decorated enough, etc. And the bar area is huge and really nice space. Fair warning: Happy hour can make the bar area quite crowded. I also really like the patio area too.  The service we experienced here was fabulous. Very attentive and friendly.  The menu has just so many good items. The flavored mojitos and sangrias are all amazing. And I've never had a bad or even so-so tapa here. The stuffed peppers and mac 'n' cheese will forever be personal favorites. And then there's the steak and mushrooms skewers, the petite filet, the shrimp, the mussels, the gazpacho, the dates, the meatballs... It's all good eats.  So yeah, it's still a top Vegas restaurant for me.",

    "text": "Usually when I make a trip out to Vegas, I am much too intoxicated to eat anything at a sit-down restaurant but it was my friend's birthday and his gf suggested this place and I'm glad we went! The menu is tapas style with various small plates to share family style. They also have entrees if you're the kind of person who just doesn't like to share :)  The paella takes about 40 minutes to prepare so you should order that right when you sit down as you look over the rest of the menu. We opted for the mixed paella for the table. Everyone ordered various things and honestly, EVERYTHING was delicious. I have no complaints. I had the petite filet as my main entree and it was DELICIOUS, only $15!   From what I remember from tasting everyone's tapas, the shrimp, stuffed mushrooms, ahi tuna, chicken and rib eye entrees were ALL great! I hope I can come back soon. The menu is so extensive, there's prob around 50 tapas to try!",

The drinks are refreshing and delicious. I started off with the Passion Fruit Mojito and ended with a Watermelon flavored mojito. Both delicious but entirely different flavors. The passion fruit sour and watermelon sweet.  The waiters and waitresses are very knowledgeable and service was impeccable. Can not wait to come back once visiting Vegas again.",

From the moment you pull up, you know you're in for a treat. Off the strip? Yes. Lacking the glitz you seek in Vegas? Not at all. The best part is that you get a great vibe minus the pretentiousness of the strip. Highly recommend ordering something from each category to get the full experience. We had roasted eggplant, calamari, surf & turf, ceviche, and and and.... too many to list and all delicious! Our personal favorite was the ceviche. Perfect acidity and delicious pops of avocado and bright onions. The margaritas are so obviously homemade, without the unpleasant sourness of the bad mix so many bars try to pass off. And you MUST MUST try the sangria!! They let it marinade for days before you get it and it shows. Perfectly balanced flavors of fresh, bright fruits. All in all, everything we had was extraordinary and we can't recommend it highly enough. Thank you, Firefly, for such an outstanding experience!",

I again explained that I wanted to come but that I cannot wait. She suggested I go elsewhere then. Her tone was very rude. She certainly has no empathy for people with disabilities. It is a very poor reflection of the establishment. I do not plan to go there now.",

Unfortunately, their old rep is preceeding them, but I've never had food poisening here, and neithet have any of my friends or family.   The happy hour here is great. The pear martini is delish. Not too sweet. I really like the sangria, I usually get a pitcher. Sometimes two. :P  The boqueronea are toasts with anchovies, avacado, and lemon drizzle. Super super good. Nice and fresh. Not too heavy. The roasted eggplant cannolini with goat cheese is also quite good. I'm a sucker for goat cheese. The beet salad is probably my favorite. Also has nut crusted goat cheese.  The stuffed dates are probably the most popular dish, and for good reason. They have an almond inside with of course...goat cheese. So delish. These are pretty rich, however. Stuffed peppers have mozz and cream cheese. It's like jalapeno poppers but fancy.  I've also had a few of their salads, the steak one is my fav. Just look at the menu. You'll know why.  All in all, a great place to come after work for happy hour or before a night on the town.",

The service is great and they make sure you're doing alright. I like the decor a lot. There's a reason there is over 1,000 review for this place.

The must-haves:  Bacon Wrapped Dates-everyone likes these. EVERYONE. I don't like bleu cheese and the little pieces in this make the dish stand out! GET THEM.   Anchovy toast things-Boquerones? I probably just butchered that. Anyways. THIS IS MY FAV!! I know I know, anchovy whaaaaat!!!? But for real get it. White anchovy on toast points with avocado, roasted red peppers and a lemony sauce....it is SO GOOD. I didn't want it, my date insisted, and it's now my favorite dish. A balance of seafood saltiness and creamy avocado...omg yum.   Manchego Mac N Cheese- I'm a lover of all things cheese and this is great, baked on top which just enhances the texture.   Stuffed Peppers- cheesy, creamy, and fried onions for crunch. Love this.   Nutella Banana Sandwich Dessert. Explained itself.

The slightly warmed up spinach gave the salad a nice body and the addition of pine nuts added a great crunch.  * Baked Goat Cheese - can't really go wrong with baked cheese! Ever. This was creamy and melt-in-the-mouth delicious. * Shrimp in lemon garlic butter sauce - the sauce was good, but the shrimp did not absorb any of it and seemed to be tossed in it a few minutes right before serving. * Grilled octopus - very disappointing, the octopus was chewy and didn't taste fresh at all...the sauce lacked seasoning as well.

Everything was hot, tasty, and served just at the right time. The staff was busy but very friendly and provided good service. Dessert was Nutella and banana for hubby and coconut sorbet for our son.

    "text": "Came back for a second visit with good recollections of fine tapas.  Beyond wobbly tables and broken chairs,  service was different with a variety of waitstaff kind of throwing dishes in from all directions. Food was fine although it tended to be sweet and mostly meat dishes. Most notably I had no idea this restaurant wants to be a nightclub with pounding house music making it impossible to hear the waitstaff or carry on a conversation with our friends,  which might have been good to know.  We ate quickly without yelling at each other and went somewhere else so we could talk over drinks and dessert.",

Food is solid and service is good as well. Their fried tempura fish is da bomb and so is anything with shrimp. Their steak tapas is pretty good as well. Try to sample as many small plates as you can since the portion sizes are smaller.",

Very attentive and just a really nice guy.  I don't love the location, but when I'm in that part of town for work, I always try to go to lunch, happy hour or dinner there.  It's fantastic and reasonable!  Can't wait to go again and try some new dishes.  Hopefully, Roberto will be my server!",

I have been here so many times and I just haven't gotten a chance to write a review. I order probably 6-7 dishes every time I'm here. My top favorites so far are their bacon wrapped dates, mushroom tart, tierra y mar skewers, scallop \"escargots\", steak&mushroom skewers, and their camarones a la diabla. The bacon wrapped dates is a nice blend of sweet and salty, with a dash of creaminess from the cheese crumbles. I can have all 5 to myself, honestly. The mushroom reminds me of cream of mushroom soup over puff pastries. It's so delicious! The tierra y may skewers is a little bit of everything from shrimp, chorizo, and I think some beef. The scallop \"escargots\" are exactly what they sound like, they're scallops made how escargots are normally made on the escargot platter with the butter herbs. The butter herbs is so delicious. After eating all the scallops, I enjoy dipping my bread in the butter. For the steak and mushrooms, it's steak and mushrooms! How can you go wrong with that. The camarones a la diabla are shrimps in a somewhat sweet and spicy sauce. It's to die for. I also love dipping my bread in the sauce. Maybe the only reason that I don't write this review is because it makes me hungry! Haha.   The service is very subpar. In all honestly, they should just hire more employees because it takes long to get your order in, to get more orders, to get a refill or anything. Plus the guys are not very pleasant, but oh wells! Can't expect 5 start service from such a busy place. Parking sucks so maybe just bring a couple dollars for the valet? And it's a very noisy atmosphere so don't expect to go here for a quiet dinner. Definitely try this place out.",

They were slimy with a spicy but otherwise flavorless sauce and globs of what seemed like mayo from a jar. A feint shadow of the fabulous potatoes brava at Julian Serrano, which have a gourmet tomato-based sauce and light creamy aioli.  The service was also frustrating. We were in a booth with about eight people. The curtains blocked people on the ends of the table from sight, which meant waiters never bothered to ask us if we wanted anything else. We had to get up from the table and seek out the waiter several times.  This is huge place and in terms of quality this is like the chain restaurant of tapas places. For a little bit more Julian Serrano, in Aria, is orders of magnitude better.",

He always had a smile on his face and was very attentive given the size of our group and that it was a busy Friday night. I have a shrimp allergy and when I was disappointed that I couldn't try the tierra del mar skewers, Pepe offered to make one of the three skewers all beef so that way I could have some. It came out on a completely separate dish which makes my allergies happy. This was also great for my boyfriend since he loves shrimp but usually doesn't get to order it due to my allergy. We also ordered their truffle fries and albondigas (a staple every time we visit) as they never disappoint! We then tried the ham and cheese croquetas which were great but were just very small - 3 pieces each about 2 inches in size. I probably will not get those again. Lastly, we enjoyed 4 pitchers of the red sangria, half priced during happy hour. The sangria is, and has been, the reason I keep going back and back!",

This was a wonderful experience for us. We had about 35 people and the coordinator (I wish I remembered her name) was amazingly helpful and got us set up in a banquet room, with a separate table for the wedding cake, and spots for everyone to mingle and eat. Kept checking in with me to make sure all was good. We had three appetizers (so yummy!) and an open bar. The bartender Miguel was super great and took food orders for a few people who wanted a full meal. All the guests loved the food, the atmosphere and their experience. Most of all my daughter was happy! Thanks Firefly for helping make her day as special as possible!",

There's quite a lot to choose from, so you'll probably be back again. My favorites are the coconut mussels, fish sticks, and tuna stuffed peppers. There are many other notable items, including hot/cold options featuring shrimp, beef, chicken, fish, etc. Their drinks are the best I've had. I'm a beer girl, so when I order sangria or a pomegranate mojito, you know something is up.   Prices are reasonable. I love the ambiance and the service is always good here.

I looked them up online and and came across the event section, I sent a quick email for someone to call me.  That day, the event coordinator Regina Simmons contacted me.  We corresponed via email text and by phone.  We were a party of 35 and were able to have the private room in the back.    On our way to the venue I sent Regina a text that we were on our way.  Once seated our waiter, Jesus was on it.  We had water bread and drink orders.  Oh did I mention that I left all my centerpieces there and Regina and her staff decorated for me.  She even ordered linens and napkins to match our rustic chic wedding decor.  Everything looked beautiful.    Within 10 minutes of settling in, BAM!!!!  The food, oh the food.  We had artichoke toast, the bacon wrapped dates, salmon toast, beef and chicken skewers and the diablo shrimp.  Everything was delicious.  The service was awesome and the food amazing.  The value was definately there.  Parking, use the valet parking, it's FREE!!!!!  When we were leaving, the place was bumping, it was a great vibe and great mix of people.  I will definately be back on our next trip.  Can't wait to try new items. (Will definately order the bacon dates again)  Thank you Regina and the Firefly staff for making this event special and memorable for my nephew and and now new wife.   Gracias por todo!",

Our waitress seemed to have one whole side of the restaurant plus tables outside.  We had to ask for our check twice.  Then waited for awhile before she would come back to get the check.  In the meantime one of the people I was dining with had to leave.  10 minutes later came to get my cash payment and then 20 minutes later I was till waiting for my $87 of change.  The other three people I was dining with had to leave so I was now sitting alone and the waitress still did not come to bring my change.  I finally flagged a manager down and asked if I could please get my change because I had been waiting 20 minutes.  No apology, just said the waitress was having issue with another table.  Brought my change back in two minutes again saying the waitress was having issues with another table , I said I understood she was busy as it looked like she was waiting on half the restaurant.  She just looked at me like I had two heads. Brought down the mood from what had been a fun dinner.",

    "text": "So my future sister-in-law made reservations here for her bachelorette dinner on a Saturday at 7:30. We arrived at 7:30 or 7:35 and were seated at about 7:45. The ambiance was nice and I as digging the vibe. We were seated and were kind of discouraged right off the bat when the servers were around our table but no one came to introduce themselves, ask for our drink order, or if we wanted to start off with any of the tapas. Thirty minutes later we flagged someone down to ask if we could order drinks and food... And had to flag people down for another thirty minutes afterward. The restaurant was quite loud and busy, but other tables were being served and we were right next to the server station and bar and couldn't get anyone to take our order! After I explained that it was my sister-in-laws bachelorette the staff became more attentive. The saving grace was most definitely the food and mojitos. The bacon-wrapped dates and ceviche were amazing, as well as the pork empanadas.   All in all, the food and drinks were delicious but the service leaves much to be desired. We are visiting from the east coast and my future sister-in-law was bummed that we were being looked over on what was supposed to be a fun evening out. The photographer that snaps a picture of you while you're trying to enjoy your food really brought us down a notch too. She then comes back later and tries to sell you the photos for $15 apiece... What?!? It really cheapens the entire experience. I get that it's Vegas, but there is a time and a place and it isn't while we are eating.",

They waste absolutely no time when it comes to customer service. Well done!",

    "text": "We were invited by friends for dinner (party of 6 for tapas and drinks) We were seated right away. Our friends chose to sit on the patio, so I didn't get to see the inside. The patio faces a busy 6 lane roadway with no real view, and no garden between you and the street, only the sidewalk. The waiter never brought my drink. We ordered loads of tapas to share which ranged in price from $8 to $12. The dated wrapped in bacon with blue cheese were delicious, but overcooked. The steak and mushroom skewers were such a disappointment - ordered medium - they were tough and were fat and gristle, so we left them uneaten. The calamari was good, the roasted vegetables were mushy and flavorless, the veggie empanadas were forgettable but served on a nice bed of greens that we all enjoyed. Then there was the ribeye steak - we ordered it medium rare, but it was so rare no one ate it and the steak knife they served it with wouldn't cut the steak! The shrimp tempura, the shaved steak sandwiches and the big pasta bowl were the favorites. The shrimp tempura had enough shrimp for 5 to taste and also was on a pile of vegetables tempura that were delicious. The steak on the sandwiches was hot and tender, served on delicious fresh rolls, with a chopped cold vegetable relish topping and we cut them into 4 generous servings. The pasta was angel hair with a red sauce that was just spicy enough to perk up the taste buds without burning them. The food was served hot as each dish is brought out as it is ready, so no one really ate at the same time.  Plates were not cleared, so we ended up with piles of plates, and they never offered us clean tasting plaes. Our friends had a pitcher of peach sangria, which they reported was delicious. I was in it for the company, and some of the food was good, but I have no desire to return.",

    "text": "I have been going to Firefly for years.  It was recommended to me first by a close friend that worked in the restaurant industry in Vegas as a locals place. I went to the original location one block away and since the move, have been to the new location a few times now.  I make it a point to visit this place each time I visit Vegas on business or pleasure.  I recommend this place to all my friends, family, and co-workers.  On my recent visit on 12/28/13, my family (4 of us total..kids were 10 and 14) enjoyed:  1) Red Sangria - Get a pitcher(s) of this stuff.  It is the nectar of the wine gods.  It is a perfect blend of sweet and tart on a hot or warm day and compliments all the dishes they have well.  2) Tapas Style - Since moving to the new larger location, they changed their menu and added more flare.     - Tomato-basil soup and grilled cheese is light, flavorful, and refreshing.   - Shrimp ceviche is cool refreshing, seasoned well and balanced in flavor.   - Stuffed Dates had a smoky bacon wrapped around a semi-sweet date with an almond inside.  It was a great combination of flavors and the crunch added a nice texture.   - Firefly Fries are a large portion of garlic and parmesan goodness.   - Manchego Mac 'n' Cheese was the kid's favorite.  Fresh and homemade with real cheeses.   - Chicken Skewers was another kid's favorite.  There was a roasted garlic cream that added some good flavor to the chicken.   - Serrano Sliders were really tasty and tender.  We added some of the onion straws it came with as a garnish in the slider to kick it up a notch.   - Merguez...my wife doesn't like sausage but this lamb sausage was great.  Not very gamey but a good rich tasting meat complimented with red peppers.   - Lamb Chops - It was like eating candy...it was lamb as it should be with a base of seasoning that brought out a slight pleasant sweetness.   - Camarones a la Diabla - Shrimp in a spicy sweet sauce.  Hands down one of the best dishes there.  The sauce is so good...ask for extra bread for dipping.   - Desserts for us consisted of our favorites...flan and tres leches cake.  The flan is traditionally made and the flavor of the custard has an almond taste to it...the tres leches cake is moist and sweet to eat.  3) Service - The servers, runners, and bussers were fantastic.  Our drinks were always filled, table was clutter free, and our server checked in at the right moments.    4) Ambiance - The new location is much easier to get in and out of.  The decor and layout of the restaurant was very open and relaxing.  Overall...great job on the new location and new menu!",

The place is always packed, and the smells from the outstanding were amazing, but the eating experienced left a lot to be desired.  I had a hard time even getting a table - tried a couple of days - and then I was seated but only outside in a corner.  Waiting times for service were longish, and then a couple of dishes I was served were obviously made ahead of time and heated at the last minute, and the inside of the food was still cold.  The dishes were modern yuppy fusion and not traditional.  All in all, there is a lot of flash and not a lot of substance.  I will not be coming back.",

The Firefly name has unfortunately been marred by multiple restaurant closings from the health department, so they've gone from three or four locations down to only one.

Marcos made sure that we had what we needed, and did his best to keep up with clearing away what we finished, and that nothing was wasted. This has become one of the Vegas team's favorite places!",

This is a must go spot for us every time we are in town. The sangria here is to die for. The goat cheese fish was rich and the sauce added the right amount of acidity to cut through the richness. Most plates come with enough to share between 4 people. I recommend this place all the time to friends and family. See you again soon Firefly!",

From the The cab attendant at the hotel, to the cabbie, everyone raved about it, this is definitely a much loved which even the locals enjoy. It's a nice looking restaurant, not over the top like most other places in Vegas, service was friendly and the food was excellent.  We tried: - Artichoke toasts - Stuffed Dates - Roasted Veggies - Patapas Bravas - Empanadas - Steak & Mushroom Skewers - Ham & Cheese Croquetes  Everything was delicious, the only one we didn't care for was the Baked Tetilla (Chorizo & cheese fondue) but everything else was excellent. I would love to go back next time I'm in town.",

The best items were the artichoke toast.  omfg.  it was like little bits of heaven.  do yourself a huge favor, and get this.  the stuffed mushrooms, is something you can skip.  not too appetizing.    this place has a fun vibe to it.  i heard that some nights they have a live band come in and play.  call ahead and check. so come down to firefly and order yourself a sangria and enjoy your night.  They also have free valet for your car.",

I've only had their tapas, drinks, and Big Bowl salad, but everything has been amazing. For tapas, I've tried: mushroom tart, chicken skewers, petite filet, stuffed dates, ham croquetas, apple and manchego salad, garden variety salad. Each dish has been beautifully presented with a tantalizing combination of flavors. Their sangria and Fly Mule are awesome too! Really, I don't think you can go wrong with anything here. I'll try their paella sometime, but can't seem to get away from the tapas!",

Though all the plates we ordered were good nothing stood out to me as fantastic.  The drinks however were fantastic and those were the most memorable of the night.  Especially the espresso martini which was mind blowing.  Location is a little off the strip but not more than a 5 min Uber ride away.  Nice to get away from the Vegas prices but this place is not cheap by any means just more of a bargain than anything on the strip. Would return!",

He would talk to us but was always looking away , was in a rush to take our order .  But our busser Jaime was very attentive to us . Brought us water , was always around to see if we needed something . While our server was sitting down at a table. Which I believe was his friends table . Didn't care to come around at all . My husband and I are also servers so we know how this industry is . I wish we could have more people / servers like Jaime, that's are very humble and care about customer service !",

Definitely recommend it . Our second mini dish was the empanadas. We were a little disappointed with it. It's only one small empanada cut in half. The meat was okay in flavor just wish it contained more than just meat. For drinks we ordered sangria and a raspberry mojito. Over all food was a 4 out of 5. Reason I'm giving only two stars is because the service was not what it should have been. We had to keep waving down our server and our plates were never picked up until about 15 minutes once we waved down one of the hostess.  Also hostess did not seem happy to stop and see what we needed. After wards the person that came to help us and bring us the check was very rude and just dropped the bill off with out saying a word or looking at us. Really wish we could have been treated better . ALSO I mentioned it was my wife's birthday and not once did they even say happy birthday.  REMEMBER customer service makes a huge difference in a persons visit to your business.",

Finally made it (apparently it is now the ONLY location) and I was not disappointed.  The ambience is sexy, the drinks are tasty and potent and this is THE original place for tapas!    Many other restaurants began offering tapas menus following the late 00's economy crash, but nobody does it as well as Firefly!  They offer something for everyone, whether you're a vegetarian or a carnivore, and the food presentation is interesting and unique.    Basically, tapas style is like ordering appetizers.  But these aren't anything close to your traditional \"loaded potato skins and chicken fingers\" appetizers!  While Firefly does serve more traditional entrees as well, the tapas is where it's at for the ability to sample multiple items.  I can't think of a more fun destination for a night out with a group of friends.  The mojitos and sangria are delicious, as is the food.  And if you are splitting the bill, you can really get a lot of bang for your buck here!",

Many professional dancers promote Firefly for Latin dancing over the weekend while working downtown around the law offices Monday thru Friday. Friday nights, crowds are invited to dance. Latin Night with fine dining surrounded by art. Last night, our party celebrated downtown at Dinos, Atomic Liquor, but went straight to Firefly Tapas to dine, dance and feel the sophistication of the warm fires burning around us. Firefly had what the other bars lacked - Dining - Eating great food, laughing with cocktails, wine and a menu starting with gazpacho, grilled shrimp ceviche, all with tapas in baked goat cheese, fondue, roasted vegetables with chorizo, asparagus, zucchini, and blue cheese or cream cheese. The scallops baked in garlic butter, the clams served with white wine. At our last party for the night, we were able to relax next to great art or dance with abundant energy. These were experiences we could not have at the other bars we visited Saturday night, well by that time it was Sunday morning; but the champagne was still sparkling next to merguez, lamb spiced sausages, babyback ribs and marinated grilled meat skewers of steak and chicken. Parking in the back or valet.",

The pitcher of sparkling sangria was a hit and if you drink enough you get a nice buzz. The lamb chop was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. The civiche de camarones is seasoned to the absolute t. Just the right amount of acid. Definitely recommend this restaurant. You can dress up or dress down either way you fit in. My date enjoyed every dish we selected which made for a nice date. Look forward to returning for another pitcher",

    "text": "Went here during a girlfriend's bachelorette dinner. It came recommended to us from some other friends as a perfect spot for a larger party such as ours, 15 loud girls. The location is definitely NOT strip, the clientele will also let you know you are not on the strip. Once we got over this though and sat down at our table we soon forgot where we were and focused on the expansive small plates menu they had. To be honest, it was a bit overwhelming but our server was happy to walk us through popular items and recommended some great items.  The list has something for everyone and prices that will save lots of cash for drinks, club entrances and whatever else you might spend your money on in vegas.   The decor was lacking a bit in my opinion, and at the time we were there the bathroom was under construction so we had to share time with the guys bathroom (ladies in, guys out, ladies in, etc. . .) it was interesting for sure.  Overall, knowing how good the food is I would go back. It worked out for our large group as well, but if you are looking for a True vegas feel then this isn't going to be your spot.",

    "text": "The value for the price we paid was great.  The food is good, maybe slightly above average.    We ordered calamari, eggplant roll ups, mac and cheese, scallops, ham croquetas, salad.    The calamari was good, not greasy, rings and tentacles..sauce was served.  The salad was good, but as I write this, I can't remember what was in it so it was not memorable.  But I do remember that I loved the salad dressing (vinaigrette of some sort).  My husband liked the croquetas, but croquetas are not my favorite thing, I'm not fond of the gooey center.    The scallops had some sort of burnt taste to them.  Kind of reminded me of burnt garlic.  They were cooked well, but ruined by that burnt garlic taste.  Maybe something stuck to the grill and then stuck to the scallops.  I find that inexcusable.    Eggplant roll ups were quite tasty, I wish the portion was larger, or we ordered another plate.  Eggplant with goat cheese, and very little tomato sauce.  Over all good.  The mac and cheese was made with manchego cheese.  I think manchego is best eaten on its own, or with fruit.  I didn't like the mac and cheese, but I think that's my personal taste and not the dish served here.  I like mac and cheese more traditional and creamy.  Again, just an opinion, not a knock against the restaurant.    I'd go back to try other dishes, but I think I'm spoiled with previous experiences at other, authentic Spanish Tapas Restaurants.  For example, Emilio's in Hillside, IL.",

I found this place from the Yelp reviews and after glancing at their menu thought it looked perfect.  We went on a busy night but we were seated quickly and given plenty of attention from our waiter.    The food was incredible.  Creative combinations and it was fairly enough priced that we could order 6 or 7 different things without feeling the sweat of the final bill.  I didn't have a single dish I didn't think was worthy of coming back for, and as we were on our way out the manager greeted us and asked about our experience.  After telling him exactly how much we enjoyed the food, he invited us to come back tomorrow and try some flights of their new dishes on the house.  Our schedule was already pretty booked, so we thanked him and declined, but the gesture was really nice.  This will be a permanent stop for future Vegas trips, and if they opened one in Los Angeles I would be there in seconds.  Skip the money-trap places surrounding the big hotels, this is way better.",

Their old location was about 500 ft away and that's where it was love at first bites. Tapas style makes it easy to have a variety of flavors and share amongst family and/or friends. There are many choices to choose from that consist of seafood, beef, veggies, and much more. Some of my favorites are the ceviche, stuffed mushrooms, tuna tartare, tomato basil soup, tierra y mar skewers, baby back ribs with mango sauce, the pork chops are a must, and the empanadas with roasted pork are yummy. Whatever fulfills your pleasure, I'm sure you'll find it here with the endless choices. The table set up is the perfect setting that gives you plenty of room to work on multiple plates at once. The atmosphere has a romantic setting for date night during the week. But the beat picks up Thursday through Sunday and the place gets a little loud, but that's what makes this place a great experience. The staff is great, the vibe is trendy, and music sets the tone for a wonderful evening. If you want to avoid the larger crowds, I suggest to visit during day and the food will be just as delicious as it is at night. Also, if you're staying anywhere on the strip, you're a short $8 taxi away from most hotels on the strip. Oh yeah, the drinks are amazing too and you must try the red sangria. I better stop here and leave a few things for you to discover yourself here at Firefly.",

So Friday night in the City that never sleeps...we are looking for a nice place to go have dinner...we start Yelping and find this place. Best choice ever.   We were at the Venetian so since it's not really on the Strip we took a Taxi...8 minutes later we arrived.  As soon as we walked in...I'm already loving it. The hostess was very nice. She said the waiting time would be about 25 min, but I think we waited less than that.   We seat at our table & wow! It's such a Happy Feel-Good Place! Great ambiance...People dancing. Everyone seemed in a great mood, happy vibes! Feel good music!   Our server Mario was amazing very attentive...also there was another girl that would bring the drinks...my boyfriend had like 5 Iced Teas as soon as the glass was empty she would bring more!   Our food! Yummmm! Everything was delicious! My boyfriend had Tuna Tartare & Roast pork Empanadas and he said they were delicious! Attention Vegetarians! They have a Vegetarian Menu!! :) I had \"Crab Cake\" & Stuffed Peppers... so delicious!!! We also shared some Firefly Fries...so yummy!   Price: Not expensive at all...for all the delicious food we got (pics attached) we spend $63.27, we also had 2 coffees, 1 Mojito & 1 Iced Tea.  5 Starts for Firefly!  I'm definitely eating there again next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "With so many food options in Vegas, it is really hard to pick a place to eat. If you are looking for a wide variety of tapas and small food portions, then look no further than Firefly. Parking is very easy because the restaurant has its own free private parking lot. I was able to grab a table near the bar fairly quickly and the service was very friendly and accommodating. They have TVs with sports games at the bar section.  Menu: There are so many options that they just make your head spin, but thankfully Yelp highlights were very helpful. Tapas are priced between $6.5 to $13 and you can easily spend more than $40 per person here.  ***  Complimentary Garlic Bread with Honey Almond Butter: Oh wow that butter was really great and it had such an unique flavor. It was so good that I had to ask my waiter about the butter.  [Meat & Poultry Tapas] Steak and Mushroom Skewer (grilled filet, roast garlic cream, red wine reduction - medium rare, $11): Decent steak, but sauce was not super flavorful.  [Meat & Poultry Tapas] Lamb Chops (2 chops, red wine reduction, sauteed lentils and julienne vegetables - medium rare, $12): Meat itself wasn't too shabby, but both lamb chops looked slightly overcooked. Sauce for veggies tasted slightly salty.  [Chilled Tapas] Tuna Tartare (marinated ahi tuna, avocado, sesame dresing, taro chips - $10): Tuna tasted pretty fresh with a slightly spicy kick and smooth texture from avocado. Sauce wasn't too salty and this was the best tapa of the night.  ***  Great place to share food with friends and families in Vegas. You get some hits and misses, but overall I didn't really have horrible tapas here and I had a pretty positive experience here.  P.S. - You get 5% cash back if you sign up for the Yelp Cash Back. I pretty much signed up on the spot via the Yelp app and saved few dollars!",

The service was on point, everyone was attentive to filling water glasses(never got below half full before getting filled again), dirty plates removed quickly, and food brought out in a timely manner.  The entire waitstaff works together to ensure your experience is beyond one you have never had anywhere else.   Drinks were on point as well.  We ended up coming back to Firefly a few days later with another couple because it was a great experience the first time.  We were not disappointed.   Definitely try this place.",

It was amazing the tres leches cake!! If I could have it delivered to Indy I would order right now. The restaurant had a lot of families but some nice little areas you could hide in for a date night. Spanish decorations and a large bar area. From the menu they can happily cater from vegetarians to carnivores to picky eaters.",

Speaking of dates order the dates those were the best things there. The other dishes we great as well. Also not too expensive for about 5 people it's came to $100 and divided with each person not too bad.  Top dishes: the bacon wrapped dates, smoked salmon, petite filet, mushroom baguette, and the chicken empanadas.",

We sat on the patio to enjoyed a smorgasbord of appetizers. We had a pitcher of Sangria because why not, lol, the Wrapped Dates are amazing. We also had the Firefly fries and the dipping sauce is perfect, my favorite are the Smoked Salmon Toast it's just a little peace of heaven with every bite. The Bruschetta with Mushrooms are scrumptious and that sauce is perfectly creamy not to watery or thick, just right. I don't recall the specific names for the appetizers, yet there was one other yummy item we had. It was small squares of potatoes, one or two eggs sunny side up and bacon, there was a hint of hot sauce and it could be a hearty meal all on its own. The Sangria was really refreshing and my water glass was never empty. We spent about 3 hours nibbling and catching up and time few by.   I wish I could have gotten the Server and Runners Names today, but they served our small party on the patio today at 11:30am. I want to thank them for being very attentive at times the service we never had to ask or needed anything else due to them being intuitive with our needs.   Thanks again. I shall visit again for some more Smoked Salmon and Ahi Tuna bites.",

    "text": "GOOD LUNCH TAPAS  We stopped here for lunch but were not really surprised by the flavors.  They start you off with cold bread and garlic butter, which wasn't really our thing... We're more of a hot-bread people.  FOOD: The \"Patatas bravas\" (7) were not as spicy as expected yet they had good flavor. We tried the \"Camarones a la Diabla\" ($11) and they had good taste. The \"Stuffed Peppers\" was another good selection.  SERVICE: We were disappointed to get our plates at different times, even though we ordered everything at once. When we asked for more tapas, it took an awful lot of time.  Wi-Fi: GOOD! Cell reception with AT&T is awful around here and you'll want to use their Wi-Fi network.  Definitely won't visit again unless I REALLY want some good sangria, which I'm sure it's easy to find within a casino.  #ruizmedina #fireflytapas",

We walked around still wondering if there were people inside or if we'd be the only ones there for dinner????  We walked in and I'm so happy we did, it was packed.  The vibe was great, the decorations was great, the music was great!  Now let's get to the food.  It is tapas, so it made it great for sharing.  The food was absolutely delish and I will definitely come back again to try more dishes.  If we're weren't so stuffed I could be just kept ordering.  The need empanada and salad we're so, so good.  The ribs just fell off the bone.  The croquettes we're, ok I'm going old school, the bomb dot com!!!  Hahaha. The fries were the beginning of our meal, and my daughter would not let them take the ate until she had the very last fry, so in saying that...  They were pretty darn good!  Off the strip, well actually, right behind the strip, so prices are decent. The reviews are pretty on point.  Give this place a try when you're in Vegas.  You won't regret it!",

We had the scallops, ahi tuna skewers, heart of palm \"crab cakes\", roasted veggies, anchovies in toast, firefly fries, grilled octopus and potatoes, the seafood paella, mango sorbet, and chocolate tres leches cakes.  The stars were the ahi tuna skewers )which tasted kinda like steak and had an amazing sauce), the roasted veggies Brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes, and carrots. They had a nice lemony flavor, and the grilled octopus and potatoes.  The fries, scallops, anchovy toast, mango sorbet, and tres leches cake were also very good.  The seafood paella however took the longest and was so over cooked, bland, and mushy that we sent it back.   But everything else was so great. We spent nearly three hours there and had great service the whole time. Will be back.",

The food, the ambiance, and the service are consistently excellent! This is the restaurant I always recommend for people new to Vegas, and so far everyone has thanked me for this recommendation.  As for what to order...I always get a pitcher of red sangria, to share of course. They start you off with complimentary bread and sweet almond butter, which surpasses any other buttery spread I've had. Most of the menu is tapas style which makes the meal even more enjoyable because it is possible to have a little taste of everything if you want. My absolute favorite dishes are the artichoke toasts and the vegan \"crab cakes.\" YES, they are VEGAN FRIENDLY here! Lately, I've been getting their veggie paella. It's delicious, huge, and contains the most perfectly cooked artichokes within it. Back when I did eat meat, their stuffed dates, sliders, and fish sticks were my top picks. For dessert, you can't go wrong with the Nutella sandwiches or chocolate cherry bread pudding.  Do yourself a favor, and give Firefly a try if you haven't yet. You can thank me later!",

The tuna tartare came with taro chips, which were very light and complimented the raw tuna perfectly. I was hesitant about trying the bacon wrapped dates, but it was one of my favorite dishes of the night. The saltiness from the bacon paired well with the sweet juicy dates. Firefly is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas!!",

How can you make world class tapas but serve terrible French fries is just silly to me. I guarantee almost 50% of the fries get thrown in the garbage, the owner should be ashamed they haven't been removed or fixed.   Great service almost all of the time, rarely been unhappy with they. I have brought groups of 10+ without reservation a few times and got seated and served reasonably quick.   I'll be back for sure.",

Here's what we had:  Tuna tartare: perfectly seasoned, great ratio of tuna to avocado, nice portion size.   Green salad: Fresh, crunchy, fantastic dressing  Meatballs: Flavorful, rich but not too heavy  Chicken skewers: moist, and tasty. I wouldn't go out of my way to get this since it's not special in any way, but it was far from bad.   Petite filet: Our favorite! High quality piece of meat with just enough sauce to bring out the exquisite flavor. The mushrooms, fried onions, and potatoes were perfect accompaniments. Really delicious.   Service was prompt and friendly. Really great experience.",

    "text": "Firefly was delicious! Usually tapas are a no-go for guys, but my boyfriend seemed to like this place. The portions are fairly generous if each person orders about 2 plates each to share. Here's what was memorable:  Bacon Wrapped Dates: Salty, sweet, juicy and the crunch of the almond inside the date. This was delicious. I could've eaten more of these.  Tuna Tartare: A nice cold dish to contrast with the other things we got. The tuna was in generous chunks and the taro chips were light and crunchy.  Pulpo Asado: Tender octopus. Not overcooked. Full of flavor from the ingredients cooked with it.   Scallop Escargot: Think of how escargot (snails) are usually served, but with scallops instead. So they're soft without the chew usually expected with escargot. Generously sauced with butter and herbs, it was easy to want to use the complimentary bread to sop up the sauce that remained with these scallops.  Mushroom Tart: This was unexpected, but it's mouth-watering. I thought this might be dry because of the puff pastry, but surprisingly, they were generous with the sauce/mushrooms so it's not savory.   Making reservations on a Saturday night is a smart move and highly recommended.",

I don't care to drink free booze until I black out and wake up with a face tattoo in Thailand.  I just enjoy good food and people.  Wanted to stay off the strip to avoid all the meaninglessness so walked to this tapas place near my hotel. Bellied up to the bar... group to my right were bartenders and waitresses from the strip on their day off, laughing out loud and having a great time .  Guy at my left was a chef grabbing some food before heading to work.  Bam.  You know you got a solid place.  Everything I had was amazing (Stuffed dates, pork empanada, eggplant cannelloni, petite filet).  Bartenders on their game and very attentive.  Just a great place, bottom line.

(our waiter did take it off the bill without me specifically having to ask though, which is always appreciated.)  service: 5/5 ambiance: 4/5 (it was just a skooch too dark and i needed my phone flashlight to read the menu like an old lady.) food: 1/5  if you're looking for delicious tapas in Vegas i'd recommend Jaleo over Firefly. yes, it's significantly more expensive, but the food is light-years better in quality.",

We sent it back, however the manager came to our table and said: \"Just so you know, I'm going to take it off the check but back in the kitchen no one could've drop a hair there\" she didn't apologize, in the contrary, she insinuated that we, as customers, put the hairs on it. We thought it was very offensive. We were ordering lots of drinks and by that time we ordered a bottle of wine... We were there to eat well, spend money and have a good time and it was just offensive to hear that. Even if we could've been \"those\" type of customers, she should've just apologized. Very disrespectful. Our server was really nice and came back and apologized for everything, which was the only thing we wanted to hear.",

Tuna tartar is fucking amazing, great quality. Ham & Cheese Croquetas were crispy on outside and super cheesy and delicious. Calamari was cooked to perfection. The Tierra y Mar skewers:shrimp, steak, sausage was filing and great flavor. Apple and manchego salad was refreshing, but not my favorite.

When we were seated we ordered a bunch of small plates.

Cooked perfectly! Chicken Skewers - Flavored so well!  I have to say everyone in our group/party loved every plate of food! Service was also great.

    "text": "Maybe they should change the name to phoenix cause this place is reborn.  Its nice to see spot like Firefly bounce back from the whole Salmonella disaster last year. Yes people got sick from the food here, will it happen again? Nope. In fact they have a food safety consultant and its probably the safest place in town to eat.  I've been slacking on checking out the new location but I finally got to stop by a few days ago. The new location is a building over from their original spot but is probably three times the size. Its a large stand alone building with a big patio, massive bar, and plenty of space for diners and large parties. The new spot captures the look and feel of the original Firefly while expanding a little and establishing itself as its own restaurant. Across from the bar is an open kitchen viewing area/bar which should ease some concerns about food handling and safety.  During our visit the service was spot-on. Our server and bussers were on top of refills and had some great recommendations. Keep in mind that the tapas come out in waves not all at once. The food thankfully (unless you had the limited edition Salmonella flavors) is the same. During this last trip we had the mac n cheese, chorizo and chicken stuffed mushrooms, bacon wrapped dates, and chicken skewers. We also had the chicken and mushroom pallela, kind of like a gumbo without the shrimp, this thing can easily feed 3 to 4 people. All of the dishes were as delicious as before and I recommend checking out all of them. I think their raised their prices on the pitchers of mojitos but its still worth it especially if you are stopping by during happy hour.  Its great to see people give Firefly a second chance, and I commend the restaurant on making some substantive changes.",

However, the quality of the food was good! I wasn't much of a fan of the mac and cheese we ordered, but the bacon wrapped dates were so good and I don't usually like dates!  If you order the paella, it takes 40 min, but if you order a bunch of tapas, it won't seem long because the tapas come quick and in the meantime while you eat them, your paella will be ready!  As for service, they really do a good job filling your glass of water and taking away your plates!",

Lastly, the veggie samosa, which was decent, not great. My boyfriend got the filet mignon sliders; I had a bite and they were so tender and juicy! His machego mac and cheese was just alright; that kind of cheese is too mild, in my opinion, for mac and cheese. A very enjoyable out-of-the-ordinary meal for Valentines Day! We had to wait for a table, but that's to be expected given the holiday. Service was pretty good; they were very attentive. I will probably be back!",

    "text": "THINGS I LOVED  Artichoke Toasts: (hearts, aioli, basil, pepper) I couldn't get enough of these. Definitely do yourself a favor and order yourself a handful...for yourself alone lol Very generous chunk of an artichoke heart on a little soft toast. Really thought the use of a non-toasted piece of bread was genius.   Stuffed Dates: (bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese) Like candy for adults that kids would probably enjoy too.  Scallop \"Escargots\": (scallops baked in garlic-herb butter) Don't be fooled or worried, depending on how you feel about snails, but there are no escargots in this dish. I believe the name comes from the traditional escargot plate it's served in. Either way, it was delicious. That garlic-herb butter, I must have the recipe. Very balanced, not overly buttery and a beautiful blend of herbs.   THINGS I LIKED  Baby-back Ribs: (mango BBQ sauce) These ribs are better the next day. Either I coincidently picked the one rib that wasn't off-the-bone tender that night or something else but I thought the flavor was subdued. Not the next day, full of flavor. (Maybe I had so much to eat that my tongue got flavor profile overload?)  Paellea Mixed/Seafood: (shrimp, mussels, clams, calamari, chicken or tilapia, chorizo, and vegetables) We ordered both the mixed and seafood. Only difference is the chicken or tilapia. Honestly, I don't think you'll even notice because it's not like they give you large portions of either meat choice but the paella also was not that great when I ate it at the restaurant but the next day it was a recovering hangover's best friend. I will say, it says it feeds 2-4 but that's if you order this and only this. We ordered thirteen different varieties and multiples of each plate so by the time the paella came out, 40 minutes later, we didn't even finish one paella plate and we had a group of 12.   Camarones a la diabla: (shrimp, sweet and spicy sauce, grilled bread) Flavor was good but very strong. I would pair it with rice if I could.  Serrano Sliders: (mini burgers with Serrano ham, cabrales blue cheese, crispy onions) Another good drinking/hangover meal.  Sangria: Flavor and wine-full lol  THINGS I WOULD PASS  Tuna Tartare: (marinated ahi tuna, avocado, sesame dresing, taro chips) The tuna was fresh, I'll give them that, but you'll definitely need to add a little citrus juice to kick up the taste. To me, served as-is, it was on the mellow side with the star of the show being the taro chips. I didn't know you could fry taro root.  Steamed Mussels: (steamed in white wine heirloom tomato, garlic, herb butter with Parmesan crostini) I would definitely pass on this dish. A bit lackluster and the mussels are so small. For almost 10 bucks, it was disappointing.  Ham and Cheese Croquetas: (Serrano ham, manchego cheese, aioli) Filler food. You should order something else with more flavor than waste space in your stomach for I say. They weren't bad, just tasted like potatoes.   Chicken and Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms: my least favorite order. No flavor, all I could taste was mushroom. Boring zzz  Firefly Fries (parmesan, herbs, aioli) So SALTY. Could not eat more than two but other people liked them.",

The atmosphere here would be considered trendy and tends to be on the loud side but as long as you know that going in its no problem. If you go on a friday or saturday night expect service to be a little bit less than stellar because of the sheer number of people in the joint.  Some of their stand out dishes would be the bacon wrapped dates, the ham and cheese croquetas and the manchego mac & cheese.",

We would have made our server aware of this, if he had ever come back to our table, besides to ask if we got our bill after we had already paid. It was also a let down that the old scallops were off the menu; new version was not as good. Other apps (dates, stuffed mushrooms, beet/pear salad) were just OK. I've had my fill of Firefly.",

The blood orange mojito was highly recommended to us so we decided to try it. For $30, I thought it would be savory. Unfortunately, it tasted like some juice mixture I made in high school. It was barely drinkable and tasted like bottom shelf liquor. Not worth the money. The food was just ok, for small plates, could have been better. I just wish the service had been better to reflect the food and create a better experience for us.  Menu is very boring and the ambiance is very pretentious.  This was the last time I visit this place, sad to say we you need to move on...",

I could simply go there and just order these and the mojitos and be a happy camper.",

This place did not disappoint!  The food and the drinks were fantastic!  We ordered a pitcher of sangria to split.  So yummy!  I just kept drinking more and more....They have this amazing garlic bread to start, with some sort of sweet butter.  AMAZING!  It was addicting and I had to stop myself from eating the whole thing.  In addition, my friend and I ordered the firefly fries, steak and mushroom skewers, and ham and cheese croquets.  All of the dishes were phenomenal.  They have a lot of different options for tapas and they all sounded so good but we had to stop after 3 since we were getting real full.   The service was also great.  Our server always came by to check on us and our glasses were always filled.  This place looks to be a great place for groups to eat and drink together.  We came around 7:45-8pm and were seated right away.  It wasn't too busy.  However, as the night went on, it seemed to start getting really busy and louder around maybe 9pm with a lot more groups.  Something to keep in mind.  I can't wait to come back here and take my husband so we can try some more tapas (looking forward to trying their paella)...and so I can drink more of that delicious sangria of course ;)",

We could've opted for a table pretty quickly but decided that the bar was where we wanted to be.   Bartenders were pumping out some massive carafes of mojitos and sangrias. We both decided on sangrias (amazzzing)... Not overly sweet. Everything on the menu looks great. Unfortunately we tapped out after 6 dishes. Top pick by far was the bacon wrapped dates but you can't go wrong with anything here.   Ambience is perfect. Great for small or large groups. But if you're coming with a big party be prepared to wait. Service could've been a little more personal but it wasn't bad. That would've made it 5 star otherwise. Thanks yelp for the help,",

Bacon was somehow over cooked and yet the dish came out lukewarm.  Empanadas: pretty heavy and salty.  The sauce on the outside is probably unnecessary as the dish is already flavorful.  The empanadas breaking was cooked well.  Serrano ham sliders:  a little salty as the ham itself is already flavorful.  There is a spicy kick that is offset well by the bleu cheese.    Chorizo clams: broth is great.  Still  n the salty side but you get some more bread to dip into the broth.  Worth it to just be able to dip the bread.  This was enough food for two people so not bad  3.5 stars: I probably wouldn't come back often but the price and food was fair and service was pretty good from the waiter",

I recommend ordering the paella before everything else so that it comes out as you finish with your tapas. The paella was the best that I have had stateside and for $26 we got a steal with the seafood paella. Incredibly cooked and seasoned.  The tuna tartar was amazing, incredibly fresh and if it was just me I would have ordered 2 and would be done with my meal. The scallop escargo, which is basically scallops cooked in the escargo style of heavy butter and garlic was also well done buy I wish the scallops were better.  The music was also great but could be turned up a bit to help drone out the other conversations and because it by itself is very nice.   The best part is that this place isn't too far from the strip, like one mile off las vegas blvd. So it wasn't crowded but still tasted good. We were full but we weren't vegas buffet style full/dying so we could still go get drinks and gamble without the food coma feeling.  We will be back soon.",

We were in town for the weekend for Mr Olympia and to celebrate our post-wedding bachelor/bachelorette so i wanted to come back and try their new larger location.  i made a reservation for Saturday at 8PM and we drove up right at that time. They had our table all ready and set up with no wait time at all. The restaurant is definitely much bigger and nicer than their previous spot.   I absolutely love sangria so naturally, the beau and I ordered a glass each of the red sangria ($7 each). Some of the others in our party ordered the mojitos which I tried as well.  Both drinks were delicious and refreshing!  For food, he and i had the chicago beef bocadillos, chorizo plate and huevos estrellados. i'm a meat eater, give me lots of protein...and all the dishes we had was perfect! i also had a little taste of the dishes my friends ordered which included stuffed dates, chicken skewers, steak & mushroom skewers and baby back ribs. OMG, i was seriously in tapas heaven! the portions are much bigger than what you'd expect too so be prepared to share!  we really wanted to order the paella but knowing it would take a long time to prepare and we had to places to go, we decided not to order it this time.  the service was good, the food delicious, the drinks strong and made to perfection. it was absolutely one of the best dining experiences, especially with good company!

The food and drinks were brought out faster than our go to breakfast establishment. Don't be deterred when walking by with the noise or appearance, the Back has a quiet area. This place is sensational. Also the mojitos are banging!",

The food was fine just nothing spectacular, the service was fine as well just nothing impressive overall. It was super loud so it was difficult to converse with our friends. I do recommend trying to bacon wrapped dates if you come here, though. Those were really good but you only get a bite since this place is tapas style. Nothing bad to say about Firefly but just nothing impressive about it. They do have a bar that we did not try anything from so perhaps they have some awesome drinks to make up for the place.",

However our bartenders, Jordan and Maria, made up for her bad service.  The two of them were friendly and extremely helpful.  They are both personable and made our visit worth it.

The food quality is always amazing. surprisingly this place is very affordable, especially if you order many tapas plates to share at the table. The apple salad, filet bites and spicy shrimp are some of my favs paired with their house sangria. The vibe and atmosphere here is always relaxing. Candles lit, red themed, music playing (sometimes a live dj). This is the best vibe in Vegas for dinner/date. The patio is really nice and calmly lit. There's free parking in back or they have free valet. HIGHLY recommend Firefly. Quick and friendly service always!!!!",

Should be three $$$ instead of $$ since by the time you order enough tapas to be satisfying, you've probably shelled out $30-$35/person.  Interesting dishes. The almond honey butter was amazing. Tiny portion size for the price - one could easily eat 4 $10 tapas and still be not full. $6-12 for 4-6 morsels of food - the scallop escargot ($11) didn't even come with 6 smallish scallops but 3 smallish scallops cut in halves. The mixed seafood paella ($26) has lots of chicken (every other bite) and maybe two clams and two small mussels and lots of rice and little other discernible ingredients.  Loud and lively attractive scene. Not a place for quiet conversations.  Probably worth trying once but for us experience was somewhat underwhelming primarily due to the the stingy portion size. You can tell the tapas were light on costly ingredients which took away from the dining experience.",

Keep in mind that everything is served tapa style. We also ordered the Red Sangria which was delicious! We got a pitcher of the Sangria at happy hour which ends at 6pm. Some of the other tapas we had were the Scallops Escargot Style, Bacon Wrapped Dates, Calamari and Empanadas with Pork. I can't complain about anything we ordered.

We often had to ask for water refills and our server disappeared many times throughout the meal. Needless to say, we all enjoyed ourselves. Food was delicious, and we ordered a ton of different dishes so we could try them all. I do have to say though that about half of our party had stomach issues a few hours later, which I'm chocking up to just eating too many different things. The food was pretty rich too.  Bacon-wrapped stuffed dates: i hate dates, but these were SUPER tasty. Only got about 5 of them per order though  Scallops: I'm also usually not a fan of scallops, but these were cooked perfectly and the polenta underneath complemented the seafood well.  Mussels: Tasty! Good. Not delicious, but not bad.  Chopped chicken salad: Tasty! Good. Not delicious, but not bad :D  Baked tetilla: basically cheese fondue. I looove me some cheese and some fondue, but the cheese had a weird rubbery consistency after a bit  Chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms: LOVE! So good. Mmmm  Petite filet: It was kinda rubbery meat. The steak was a disappointment  Meatballs: These were pretty good, I'd order them again  Paella: A couple of the girls in our party had been to Spain before, and they said the paella here was better. Delish!!  For all the food we ordered (we ordered multiples of the above dishes + a few I forgot to mention), dinner only came out to about $30/girl. Awesome!!  They're off the strip so you avoid the wait, the long lines, and the overpriced food. But they're also really easy to find.",

Also it was enjoyable watching the two couples at the table in front of going to the bathroom every ten seconds... ya know... for stuff.  The rest of the food here was adequate and not worth the price. And as many reviews say... it is extremely loud! Once again due to all the alcohol consumption. It is also very dark... great place to take an ugly date.  The service is great, and I don't really know what else to say about it. Great ambiance minus all the noise. Our reservation was for ten but they let us in at 930 because there was no one in line. A lot of people have said to get a reservation which I suggest... BUT if you want to go earlier you might be able to sneak in... to the bathroom and do blow.  THE VERDICT: Go?! I can only suggest this place who have money to burn. Which i do i burn 1 dollar bills for heat. There is such a VAST variety in vegas (how bout that alliteration?) that if you are there for a weekend you should definitely go to other places, because there are a lot of delish places. oh and to the prostitutes at the table in front of us... make the powder breaks a little less noticeable.",

This place isn't on the strip so parking was a breeze. Will be back the next time I'm in town. The wait staff was attentive and friendly. The reception could use some work but I'm judging this place on the food so I would override that mishap. Don't forget to order the paella in advance 'cuz it takes ~40 mins to make.

My favorites are Firefly fries, Firefly fish sticks, Spicy Beef salad, and steak and mushroom skewers. It took me 4 years before I tried the bacon wrapped dates. They are amazing and a must have!! Sangria is the best I've had anywhere. I love all 3 versions: the original, white, and sparkling. For dessert, try the banana Nutella sandwich!  The only downside is that I live in the NW and this location is just too far to visit often. I wish the Sahara location didn't close down. So basically, my only complaint is the location.",

To top it off, the atmosphere and staff are so accommodating, helpful and very knowledgeable. My husband has a gluten allergy and they were nice enough to spend time explaining ingredients so he was sure not to have an allergic reaction.

We ordered the chicken and mushroom paella to share, and then a handful of small tapas plates. The paella was delicious, it did not look like traditional spanish paella, but it was very good! The tapas plates we ordered were also good, the do seem a bit pricey for such cute tiny plate though.  The only thing i didn't like was our table, it was the half booth on one side and then a chair on the other side, which is fine, but the table (that was for 2 people) was so big i felt like the people next to me could hear our whole conversation because my boyfriend was so far away.

    "text": "So many options, but there was only so much room in my stomach to try them all. Had the tuna tartare, stuffed dates, steamed mussels, & the lam chops aka $40. Not too shabby on the pricing.   Before I get into the \"imo\" of the food, I have to recommend the sangria ($13/pitcher). Probably the best sangria I've had so far. Sangrias tend to either have too much alcohol or just be too fruity, & I don't know how they make it here, but man oh man the balance was just perfecto.   Okay, back to the food. The tuna tartare was okay. My favorite about this plate was the taro chips. Those are some tasty chips. But, I have had better tuna tartare. I am not a dates fan. And although this taste wasn't particularly for me, everyone who enjoys dates in my group loved them. But if you don't like the texture of dates--yeaaaah, don't try this one. The lam chops were okay in my opinion. I've had better lam chops as well. Not sure if it was the texture, the taste, or just both but the sauteed lentils & julienne vegetables were just not doing it for me. The star of all these plates were the mussels. Be warned, this is not a tapas plate. They are very generous in portions with their mussels, but it is nothing to complain about. The sauce just had my taste buds exploding with flavor. This is a must-have for mussel lovers.   I would compare Firefly to Cheesecake Factory, but a more elevated version. I would've been happy with just the mussels & the sangria all night long. For a group of 17, I did expect a bit of better service, but I guess we can't have it all now can we?   Eat on.",

I was not full in anyway after the meal, but I knew if I was going to have 21+ later that night, I would still have enough food in my stomach to keep me functional. However, if you're looking to chow down, I wouldn't recommend this place because the portions are fairly small and for three girls, we pretty much cleaned up every plate. For that reason, I would put this place at more of a 3.5.",

I hope Firefly on Paradise will stay True to their quality and continue serving delicious food. Next time we are in LV we will definitely come back with our friends.  The only negative is Citrus Bliss drink ($10) -- they have to improve their cocktails if they expect people to order more of them. This one had very artificial taste, as if they added dry 20 cents mix to it so we just put it aside. In house made white wine sangria was fresh and tasty, but I would prefer it with less ice in a pitcher.  The amazing thing about ordering tapas is that you don't have to commit to a huge meal which can be hit or miss. Instead, you order a lot of different tapas for the table and have fun sampling differed food. Highly recommended!",

The girls at the front desk were polite and helpful, the waitress, other servers and manager were incredibly attentive. Drinks were lush, especially my cocktail. I cant remember the name of it but it had mezcal and kahlua in it. The food was incredible; tasty combinations and huge portions. We shared 7 plates between us, not anticipating the size but demolished the lot. The stuffed dates and the roasted heirloom carrots are a must. The petite filet and the chicken skewers were also awesome. We cannot wait to go back and try more of the menu.",

I was torn on what to order but our server helped with narrowing down the decisions. Pear &-best salad, chorizo plate, and the mushroom pastry were more than enough to satisfy.   The location is close enough to the strip to make it an easy enough venture but far enough away from all the noise and hustle n bustle. Loved the outside patio seating that provided plenty of shade and cooling fans with mist.   I definitely need to come back again...with more friends and a bigger appetite. The dessert menu is calling my name!!",

I've tried multiple items with everything always being so tasty, however I do remember last year when I came I tried the veggie paella and it was not delicious. But again, paella is supposed to have seafood and meat, so that was a lack of judgment on my vegetarian friend who ordered it. So I forgive Firefly for that one and blame my friend. Ok back to last week. I ordered the clams, and it was so tasty my mouth is watering just thinking of it. Steamed to perfection and soaked in a broth with chorizo. Simply amazing. Roasted veggies were also amazing, as well as the pasta bowls. Our table ordered 3 of them and everyone who tasted it was in awe. However, it's alot of pasta; I don't think we even finished 1/2 of each one of the orders. All in all, you can't order wrong here ( Unless you get the veggie paella) and the sangria is one of the best I've ever tasted. This place is always on top of my list to visit when in Las Vegas!",

The paella is also very delicious with many ingredients but it does take a while to cook so order first. Latin night is always a good experience and can't wait to go back.

We sat down for a while before our server approached us and we barely see that person through out rest of the dinner time. We had to ask someone to refill out water and that person never returned back to our table.  One server stood close to us once a while to watch a game that was playing on the tv which located right above my friends head.  Asked for the bill and took forever to get it. I feel like we spent most of our time just waiting around for someone to serve us. We did not enjoy our time at all. I'm very surprised to see this kind of service here. I will not recommend it to my friends and family.  There are many places in Vegas that provides great food with great service. I would not come back to this place again.",

One pitcher of sangria is $30. If you have 3 people, I guess that isn't that bad.  Overall, it is a great place to hang out and get some food.",

Very reasonable prices, a great selection (i haven't had anything on the menu that i didn't like - and Ive had a lot), and fantastic service.   Highlights:  -Tortilla espanola -Shrimp ceviche -Tierra y mar skewers  Come here with a group that's hopefully not too picky, and try as much on the menu as you can until you can't eat anymore. The waiters are very happy to help you through this process and make suggestions for you too.   Cool atmosphere and an extensive beer and wine selection on top of all that. Tapas + Rioja + sobremesas = happy Kurt G.   Also - the bathroom smells like Sweetarts. Not sure how i feel about that yet, but thought it deserved mentioning.",

He said he inly serves on Friday nights. .. not sure why though because he's great at what he does. I'll def be requesting his section going forward.   Food is delicious. Worth the wait every time to enjoy this great food. Red sangria is my favorite, order by the pitcher, it's a better deal and ur going to want a few glasses!

It's safe to say I had a nice buzz going on after a couple drinks. Firefly is all tapas, or small plates. These are good for sharing which is why I like going with a group. My favorite thing on the menu is the stuffed dates. They are wrapped in bacon, and stuffed with blue cheese. Fun fact, I don't even like blue cheese, but the combination of these things is AMAZING. Do get these, and thank me later.   To be honest, I can't remember too much else because that brandy got ya girl feeling randy, or something like that. LoL.

The sangria was grossly watered down.   You would enjoy coming here with a large party for drinking purpose because it's more like a quantity over quality place.   If you are looking for real Spanish tapas in LV, Jaleo at Cosmopolitan is the better option. Don't be fooled by the stars on Yelp.....They are fake anyway.",

Before we could order drinks someone came and told us we can't take that table without ordering and it's not our turn yet! There were 3 other empty small bar tables!

The rice was cooked perfectly, and I loved the flavor of the dish. The service was excellent. Had refills before I could even ask! I really appreciated the attentiveness and friendliness of all the servers. Only downside was that the atmosphere was very loud with the music, and it can sometimes be hard to hear.",

The new location looks fabolous!! its really nice and intimate inside and the bar is really pretty. We went here for a birthday party and they served the red sangria, omg to die for. Really good and lots of fruits. They also served artichoke hearts on sourdough bread really good. Bacon wrapped dates omg this is the best thing i ever tried. So yuumy. they also order the beef kabobs, the meat was really tender and not chewy. For dessert we had the tres leches chocoalate cake. OMG OMG!! seriously..First time i ever had a tres leches cake and omg i freaking love it. You have to try it.   The waiters were really good on making sure my water was full and to take the dirty dishes away. Really good service and i would deff recommend this place.   Lets just hope they don't close down again.   FYI the Firefly in Anthem is closing because they got a C grade. YIKES!",

The strawberry one is really good. Food here is pretty good too. The portion sizes are not really that big considering their prices. I do like their complimentary bread and butter. Sometimes they do \"forget\" to serve it so make sure you ask for it. I love their fries. The menu has a pretty good selection of tapas. Not a lot of entrees though. I honestly haven't tried anything from here that I did not like. I just wish that their portions were bigger or the prices were a little lower. Try this place. And do not forget to try any of their mojitos. Outside seating during the summer time isn't bad either because they have mists to keep you cool.",

    "text": "This place was highly recommended to be by a few people, and I had really high expectations. The bad part about high expectations is that most of the time they are not met. However, Firefly went above and beyond, and I absolutely loved it.  This restaurant serves Tapas, which is basically small plates and/or appetizers. Our table decided to just order a bunch of these small dishes and share them all, which was nice because it would have been so difficult to just select one! Everything we ordered tasted fresh and amazing, and have AMAZING flavor - from the stuffed dates to the mac n cheese to the tuna tartare. For us, they brought out the dishes one by one, so we were able to focus on one dish at a time, passing it around the table for everyone to serve themselves. It is quite a different experience than most restaurants, but I definitely enjoyed this method. We also ordered a pitcher of Mango Mojitos, which we SO yummy. The mango did not taste artificial at all.   The atmosphere of this restaurant is pretty modern and artistic. We had a unique dinner because we were able to experience both the inside and outside seating. At first, we chose to sit outside because there were beautiful round fairy lights, and the inside seating seemed a bit to dark for my liking.  We really loved sitting outside, until the thunderstorm started! We were quickly moved inside, just before the large amounts of water soaked through the thin cotton overhang. The inside has a great ambiance - dark and candlelit - but I did like the outside more, before the storm obviously.   The staff was very accommodating and helpful, especially when we had to quickly move inside. They said \"grab your drinks, and we will take care of the rest\". It was very nice of them to brave the storm outside which got crazy pretty quickly.  Our server was also very friendly, and was helpful with our questions about the menu. This is amazing quality food for not that expensive, ESPECIALLY for Vegas.  I don't know if/when I will be back to Vegas, but if I do, I will definitely be coming here again!",

We ordered the Lamb chops, Smoked salmon bagel, Goat cheese toast, Skewers (Fillet, mignon, shrimp, chorizo), Mushroom tartar, and spicy calamari...can't recall if we ordered more. MUST TRY!",

Everything's was great but I do have to say that the menu was overwhelming with so many options . The good thing is I can keep going and try something new every time.",

    "text": "Initially, I ordered their chopped chicken salad and tierra y mars skewers.  The food took maybe fifteen minutes to come out. The first of my two dishes that came out was the chopped chicken salad, regretfully. What they produced before me was a large white chunky glob of mayonnaise. I proceeded carefully with my fork and made an attempt to identify the dish put before me. What I found were chunks of canned chicken,  shreds of endive, and grapes. The dish was composed of more maynonaise/dressing than of its distasteful counterparts, much too overdressed. This was no salad at all. I returned it to the kitchen. (1/5) Would not recommend.  I later placed an order for their garden variety salad: romaine lettuce, spinach, orange, feta, dried cherries, pine nuts, sherry vinegar, and heart of palm. The orange and dried cherries lend a nice natural sweet component to my dish, which I thoroughly enjoyed, especially since I had selected water for my beverage. This salad is priced at $7.50. What initially attracted me to their aforementioned train wreck of a chopped chicken salad I returned, was the fact that it came with a protein. I added grilled (actually GRILLED, not out of a can, like the first dish) chicken to my new salad for an additional $3 or $3.50 bringing my salad to nearly $12 grand total. Eh, should be $9.00 at most. (4/5)  The Tierra Y Mars skewers were great. The tapas includes three skewers, stacked with filet mignon, grilled shrimp, and chorizo. (5/5)",

A lot of friends have been recommending this place but I never got the chance to go due to Vegas shenanigans I would always get caught up into. lol.   Every dish we ordered was delish and their sangrias are to die for. I wish they were a bit stronger but its okay I'm just going to have to order my own pitcher with a straw next time ;).  Service is great and the staff are all super friendly. We must of ordered like 10 different small tapas dishes, a paella, and a pitcher of sangria and the bill came out to be about $125 for 5 people, SUPER REASONABLE!!! Unlike that Spanish restaurant they have at the Cosmopolitan, which was way too overly priced with super duper small portions that didn't even taste good. But its okay lesson learned, just go off the strip to Fireflys for your Spanish fix.   I'm making sure every time I'm in Vegas to pencil in Fireflys for dinner. Ah! Cant wait to go back :)!!!!!",

Firefly is known for their tapas and their sangria is DELICIOUS!   I ordered the \"Ahi Tuna Skewer\"- The seared Ahi Tuna was cooked perfectly, and the presentation was nice. There's two skewers and there's pineapple bits in-between every ahi tuna cube. The pineapple and tuna goes pretty well together.  The sangria was AMAZING! I had two glass. So good. It was not too strong yet not too light. However, my girlfriend got tipsy drinking it. Funny. It's really good though. Definitely recommend others to get it.  The ambiance was nice. Dimmed lights inside. Service was great.",

First off, happy hour only has drinks discounts, food items are always regular price. We came in for dinner, and ordered several things. The signature bacon wrapped dates, unfortunately had a cold center and was not baked throughly, which is an indication that the kitchen was rushing and not paying attention. The other thing I did not like was the serrano ham sliders. The filet mignon patty was definitely not filet mignon, I can taste the difference, also there were pieces of bones AND chewy tendons in the patty that I had to spit out. Yuck! Also, I was informed by our waiter that the serrano ham was grounded into the patty, which I couldn't taste at all, probably due to the tiny amount of ham that was put in.   Service was very nice,  but I'm really disappointed with the food.",

While it's True you can't order anything that's bad on the menu there are a few more items that pop out with perfect pitch.  It would be a crime to come to this restaurant and not order the stuff dates. They easily nail the perfect sangria but don't let that stop you from experiencing the infused vodkas. I highly recommend this place bring your friends and have a wonderful time. If I ever make the mistake of getting married again I'm definitely going to have this place cater my wedding",

My husband and I got 4 small plates and it was enough food for dinner. Dates were amazing (very small portions) eggplant was good, tri meat skewers were good and which came with steak, shrimp, and chicken and stuffed mushrooms were Average. This place doesn't knock your socks off but doesn't knock your wallet empty either! Our bill was around $35 without our drinks.",

And the service is friendly and very prompt, maybe even too prompt; if you want your dinner paced, you will have to do it yourself (see hint below).  But in every other respect, Firefly excels.  Every item on the menu that we tried was very good to excellent.  No misses at all, and some were really outstanding, most notably the baked goat cheese and (believe it or not) the Chicago beef bocadillos.  The San Gria was above average too.  The menu is large and has a wide variety of selections.  You will want to order 20 or so, but two per person is enough for an average appetite.  The prices are quite reasonable, with a typical plate being well under $10.  Go hungry.    HINTS: 1.  Reservations are really necessary. 2.  From the time you order to the time you get your food will vary from a few minutes to about ten.  Each plate will be brought separately, so you really need to share.   3.  To pace your meal, order one or two dishes, sit around eating and talking, and when you are ready, order a couple more.  They are fine with you doing this.",

Both the red  and white sangrias are sooo good! I also recommend the empanadas with the chicken or the veggie, the apple and manchego salad was aaamazing!!!The only one I am not a huge fan of was the chicken skewers it was a bit dry. We put in 2 orders of the mixed paellas, of course we definitely did not finish it so we took it to go. We were staying at an Airbnb, after the 7 of us came back from partying tipsy, tired  and starving late at night ... we just heat up the paellas in the microwave and they are the perfect comfort food before going to bed!!",

Even came with two tapas sides (apple salad and patatas bravas were the ones we opted for).  My friends insisted that their standard tapas must be tried, so we did a combination of brunch dishes and tapas, which was a fantastic choice. There was not a single item that did not taste good. Even the complimentary bread with butter was bomb diggity. I especially enjoyed their scallop escargot, which came out piping hot, silky soft, and swimming in little pots of garlic herb butter. The ribs and goat cheese plate was also delicious. By far the best tapas I've ever had.  And did I mention the absolute BESTEST sangria ever?! Because if you've been looking, this is where it lives. So come for the Sangria and definitely stay for the food.",

There is sometimes live music from a band or just a loud DJ playing the best of Latin music. It gets really cramped and full on Latin Nights. Parking is hard to find because people love to dance and drink!  FOOD: Their tapas menu is amazing! Bread and sweet butter is served complimentary with a sweet butter(bread can be hard if you come late at night). My favorite dish here is the Mac n cheese. It is prepared with small shell pasta, yummy cheese, and baked to perfection. I LOVE the Mushroom Tart here because it is a dish you can't find anywhere else in Vegas. It is a flakey dough with a mushroom sauce on top. If you want more mushroom dishes, the stuffed mushroom is also really great. I would recommend more dishes but honestly their menu is pretty big so your best bet is to be adventurous and order a dish from each section of the menu since it is tapas:)  DRINK: They have a full bar offering whatever you're craving for the day. So you can even go here for drinks if you're not feeling hungry.  ATMOSPHERE: This place has a really great Latin setting with Latin music and Latin food. Great place for a date or just to hang out with friends.  TIP: Be careful of your own sensitivity to foods. Latin foods can be raw because that is how the food is supposed to be prepare (many customers complain when they get sick from raw foods but it's not the restaurant's fault).",

We have been there a couple times before and last night's stellar experience was on par with our other visits.   Go with a group and order a paella or two (recommend the mixed paella with all the seafood, chicken and chorizo in it for $30ish it is a great deal because it can serve up to 4 people) to start to share as a table (they take 40ish minutes to make, so order it first thing) and then have everyone pick out a plate or two to start with and enjoy! The sangria is pretty good, not the best, but an awesome value at $33/pitcher. Another favorite appetizer of mine is the petite filet, they cook the steak perfectly and the accompaniments and sauce is tasty!  Give firefly a try for your next get together or celebration.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went for Valentine's Day and had a great experience. It's our 3rd or 4th time here and each time has been a solid 5 stars!!! THIS PLACE IS TOP NOTCH AND WON'T DISAPPOINT!! We have been when it's slow and busy and even when it's busy the wait for dishes isn't bad. Reservations *highly recommended* in the evenings!   Tierra y Mar Skewer is PERFECT!! The steak is tender, the sauce is tangy. I hate shrimp and it's still delicious! The sausage completes the dish!!!   We've had the apple and manchego salad as well as the chopped chicken salad and both were unexpectedly delicious. The apple and manchego has a delicious, tangy bite.   My boyfriend got the Beef Wellington, which was one of their specials. I wasn't the biggest fan but it's not really my cup of tea. He loved it and it was only $15! Great way to try a dish and be able to do smaller portions.   Ceviche of shrimp is the last dish I'd recommend. I'm such a snob when it comes to ceviche and Firefly's is always delicious!!!   Lastly try the damn passion fruit mojito! I usually don't care for flavors in mojitos or margaritas but passion fruit is the way to go! We got a pitcher this time because of the deliciousness factor!   If you are scared to try something, look at the yelp photos! It helps!!!",

I was with a large group for work, so we literally ordered the whole menu. Here's my takeaway.   Hot: Tuna tartare, artichoke toasts Mild: Shrimp tempura, camarones al ajillo Cold: Ahi tuna skewers (not great flavor)  My favorite parts of the meal were the sangria and the dessert. Not that alcohol and dessert being the favorite part of a meal would be surprising, but that was definitely the high point of the day. The cheesecake and the flan was great from the dessert platter, and the banana nutella sandwiches were delightful.  Based on the prices, small quantities of food, and bland flavor, I probably wouldn't put this high on my Vegas to-do list. There were definitely a few plusses for me, but overall it was a bigger miss.",

You can tell that this place is filled with locals and it is such a great break from the intensity of Las Vegas. The atmosphere is fun but not overwhelming and filled with cigarette smoke.

Our service was spot on: the bartenders had amazing recommendations for drinks and tapas, and they took great care of us.    The highlights of our meal were the shrimp diablo, clams with chorizo, chicken tinge empanadas, white sangria, and the apple/manchago salad.  I've never been so impressed by a salad before!  We had a slight hiccup when a bug flew into my glass of sangria, but our bartender wasted no time and replaced our entire pitcher.  Above and beyond!

If not for a personal friend, who also happens to be a manager of one of the better hotels in Vegas, I would never have had to pleasure to experience their excellent food.

    "text": "I can't really rate the food, but the way we were treated was terrible. We walked in tonight, understandably there would be a wait, since we did not make a reservation. The hostess said it would be 15-20 min for 3 people. Our party of 3 could handle that. About 45 min later, we saw plenty of people get taken back to be seated, we asked about how much longer they thought it would be, and she said oh umm you guys are next. She then proceeded to take another party to there seats. On that note, we decided to leave. Very disappointing as I am sure their food is tasty.",

We got the red and sparkling sangrias and the sparkling is definitely a winner  Bread with almond butter - The almond butter was soo good! Creamy with a little kick  Bacon wrapped dates - Must try! Sweet and salty combo was great! Theres a surprise nut in the middle.  Tierra y mar skewers - sooo good and tender with a chile verde sauce. Comes with sausage, filet and shrimp  Scallop Escargo - Garlic butter sauce is delish I wanted to drink that sauce  Steak skewers with gravy sauce, Yum!!!! Meat was very tender and flavorful  And last but not least Paella - Very tasty and plentiful. Flavor is good and it has a little heat.  Service is really good. Servers are nice and attentive. We'll be back here every time we're in Vegas!",

I enjoyed the various tapas that were ordered. The highlight for me was the chorizo clams, mac n cheese, and the steak. That steak hit the spot. It was cooked a perfect medium rare. I don't know if I was famished or just jet lagged but that steak was gooood.  The sangria was very light and very dangerous. I shared a pitcher with my friend and we totally destroyed it. I went with the sparking white sangria and later on the classic red. Thank goodness for cab service!!  The service was spot on considering how many people were present (about 20 ppl).  I had a great time with my friends. I highly recommend it.",

They forgot to bring us the ribs, but we were so full by the time everything else came that we just didn't say anything.  The salad was very good, very refreshing.  I'd totally get a salad here because you need the acidity of the dressings to break up the other proteins you order.  The sauce on the tortilla was WAY too spicy for me.  I had to send it back and have them remake it.  The shrimp were too spicy as well, but I just picked off the red flecks of pepper and that was ok.   The service was good, if not a little rushed.  There was no rhyme or reason to the way the dishes came out.  We didn't drink so can't comment on that, but the food was great.  The complimentary bread was delicious too.",

At first, I thought having one empanada wasn't enough, but with the other dishes combined, it turned out I couldn't eat another bite!  We also ordered a pitcher of their delicious red sangria.  What I also liked about this place was there were a lot of vegetarian options, which I usually don't see at a tapas place.  We also ordered the spicy chickpeas, but it never came out.  I'm glad it didn't because, like I said, I was full.  I would love to come back here and try more of their dishes.",

Ahi tuna tartar- with bits of avocado.  Sliders- tasty! Machego Mac n cheese- probably the best thing I had there. Spicy beef salad-I wish they used other greens beside the iceberg lettuce, and the beef could of been more tender. Sangria- good, get the pitcher!",

We had the veggie empanada, grilled cheese w tomato soup, lentils w veggies, manchego mac n cheese, and baked goat cheese! All flavorful! What I love about tapas is there's always room for dessert. Don't miss the chocolate tres leches cake, yum yum and more yum!  Our server was patient and caring. The runners and bussers all efficient and friendly.

    "text": "I'm so happy that Firefly moved and didn't close. I have loved visiting this place as long as I've been coming to Vegas (long time). Their Padron peppers are my favorite menu item and they did not disappoint today! A full plate of peppers flash fried with lemon and sea salt was $5.50 - a really unbeatable price compared to anywhere else. We also had fries with Parmesan seasoning and that's the only plate that at all disappointed me. The serving was very large but the fries were soft and not crispy, even though they were skinny and browned. Lots of yummy shaved cheese though!  Husband enjoys the ham and cheese croquetas ($5) and had a soda also (coke $2.50). I tried a new plate this time and went with the chili, lime garbanzo beans (in the shell!) ($4.50) I didn't even know they came in a shell (but it makes sense) so I asked the server what they're like. He compared them to edamame but these little pods were much more difficult to work the beans out of. I liked them a lot but they were a lot of work for too little reward.   The new restaurant is wonderful. Much bigger and still a great location. There is parking in the back, but if you miss the driveway on the way in, be sure to not park in the subsequent parking lot, as we were told they are happy to tow you.  $25.41 for amazing tapas for two",

The menu is tapas style, which is basically my favorite thing in the entire world.  I mean, you can get so many different flavors and varieties (each at around $6 or something) all while appreciating the ambiance and fun atmosphere!  Our table ordered the big bowl salad to start, followed by the stuffed dates (AMAZING! GET THESE!!!), spicy beef salad, manchego mac 'n' cheese, ahi tuna skewer, camarones a la diabla, sliders, chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms, merguez, firefly fries, and we all shared the seafood paella.  Everything....EVERYTHING....was wonderful!   This sounds like a lot of food, but keep in mind that it is tapas style.. Between 7 girls, it came out to be like 2-4 bites per dish!  They were perfect for sharing!  Also, our server was spectacular and everything was served relatively quickly, given the restaurant was packed!  Oh, try their blackberry and raspberry infused vodka and/or a pitcher of the blood orange mojitos.  Trust me, you will love.  This will be one of the first stops when I go back to Vegas!!",

We ordered all sorts of different plates and a mixed paella. Everything came out accordingly so we always had food on the table while waiting for the paella (they let you know it's gonna take about 30 minutes.) They also gladly brought us more bread and butter when we asked for more. The paella and the mushroom puff pastry was a bit too rich for my liking but it was still good. We had a great time here.

The food quality is about the same as the old location. I asked for a red sangria, mushroom tart and firefly fries. Honestly, I remembered the red sangria to be a lot better from the old location. Delicious fries. I wasn't too crazy about the sauteed  mushroom on top of popovers.",

Next we ordered chorizo plate and chicken skewers. Chorizo plate was good with thinly sliced cold cuts, mini pickles, and capers. The roasted garlic cream sauce on the chicken skewers was very tasty. The assortment of vegetables with the skewers was also very good. Lastly, we ordered the flan and flourless chocolate cake. Both deserts were very tasty and we would order them again.",

We ate at some of the \"nicest\" places we could find (not trying to be snooty, just dropping a benchmark for everyone) Firefly was our favorite spot on our four day adventure. The service was outstanding and the food...ohhhh the food...  We started at the bar with the house infused vodka..I knew we were off to a good start when it hit the lips. I initially thought there couldn't be any vodka in it because it was so smooth and at six dollars, I guess I was still in the twelve dollar mind set for hotel rum and cokes.   We were quickly seated by Irinia Omar, who became known as the Tapas wizard. We're passive aggressive in the fact that we like to order a few dishes and then have our server pick a few. There were four of us just to complicate things a little more. Some servers balk at this and are very hesitant to offer their opinion, let alone make the final call. After a few quick questions Irinia smiled and headed off. Then the onslaught of food began..the tomato bread followed by the tuna tartare, and chorizo plate set the stage in the chilled Tapas department, then the fun began. The stuffed dates, baked goat cheese, grilled octopus, spicy shrimp, scallops, empanadas, and lamb chops were to die for. We regret we didn't try at least one Paella (that was our choice ) but by the end when the desserts came out it really didn't matter.   At this point in the night after the onslaught of tapas and a few samples of the cocktail list, we were now in a battle against the food. We had to almost force down the desserts, the tres leches and bread pudding won.   The manager, Jon was very personable and friendly and made sure our group was taken care of and was overly apologetic when a group of twenty seated beside us quickly grew to the unplanned group of thirty and we volunteered to move tables to allow everyone to be seated.  Jon runs a very clean and efficient restaurant, and is quick to jump in and make sure his customers are enjoying themselves and are full.   If your in Vegas and you want an awesome and unique meal put Firefly at the top of your list. You won't be sorry. I would put Firefly up against ANY of the other \"well known\" establishments in a food off any day.",

    "text": "Cool little tapas restaurant, came in a large group for an event.  We had a private room which i though was weird that the tables were all squished in together, yet the room could have accommodated more tables spread out.  But it turned out fine and everyone had a great time.  We had the \"Tapas Banquet\" Toasted bread, Olives and almond butter artichoke toasts -  artichoke hearts, aioli, basil and pepper  Stuffed dates - smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese wrapped in bacon Baby back ribs - with mango BBQ sauce patatas bravas (spicy potatoes) - Roasted potatoes with spicy aioli steak and mushroom skewers - Grilled Fillet, roasted garlic cream and red wine reduction. camarones a la diabla - shrimp in a sweet and spicy sauce. Chocolate tres leches cake.  My favorites were the Mango BBQ baby back ribs, i didn't taste any mango but it was definitely really tender and fall off the bone, and the BBQ sauce was delicious.  Bacon wrapped dates, smoky/savory and sweet at the same time too.  I think my favorite of all was the spicy potatoes, so good, i love a good tangy aioli and especially a spicy one it went really well with the potatoes, I'd put that sauce on a burger or even their fries any day of the week.  At first bight its really hot, but it wasn't the kind of hot that multiplies as you eat it.  I think as the dinner went on i got used to it so i just kept eating more and more of it.  So good!  Service was great, they explained everything and offered to take pictures of our group, refilled waters and drinks promptly.  Im sure everyone had a really good time.",

    "text": "Man, it seems quite out if place for me to drag this restaurant like I am about to do (because they have so many positive reviews and were able to do something right to get the place re-opened)...oh, well..here is my experience..  Friends and I went this past Saturday night to celebrate a bday. The mango mojito was amazing...the drinks were all delicious and the bar staff were friendly despite being busy. We got our booth and started to order plates to share..some were better than others but I especially liked the fish sticks...very meaty. So, we are just chatting at this point and I go to put my arm up on the back of the booth when I see a full grown COCKROACH (NOT A WATER BUG, A ROACH) crawling FROM the direction of the kitchen and along the wall. We all shriek (involuntarily) and call the waiter over. He sees it and tried to kill it but it crawled down somewhere and he moved us to a center table. Of course, we are disgusted and shaken. He brings over the rest of our drinks from the table and tries to bring the food over..I was like...\"no we don't want that now.\"   The manager was called over and began to spin a story and try to do damage control. We told her we appreciated it, but our experience was ruined and we would not be paying full price (in my mind I was thinking we'd pay half and that'd be fair). They said their place is pristine and gave us a tour of the kitchen after 20 minutes of telling us we could  (if it was as clean as she swore, why did we have to wait so long?). The floor was sticky, there was clearly a second kitchen, but she insisted it was a hallway (lie, we saw servers coming from that area with trays and trays of food all night).   The meal ended up being on the house but we still tipped our waiter because, after all, he just brings the food. As we are exiting (not making any sort of fuss), the hostess rolls her eyes at us when we say good night! Really?? This is a FILTHY freaking restaurant and you have some ill feelings towards some dissatisfied customers? Some nerve! I have gone to firefly when there was a location in Henderson and enjoyed myself immensely. I WILL NEVER EVER EVER DARKEN THIS RESTAURANTS DOORWAY AGAIN. It was filthy, and their staff are (obviously) poorly trained!   Hostess tip: just smile and say good night! We tipped you anyway, and clearly you did not deserve it.",

    "text": "Firefly is a vibrant little tapas restaurant that's great for large groups. We were treated to some nice, cool fall weather on the outdoor patio. The menu has a huge selection of tapas, broken down by hot, chilled, meat & poultry, and seafood. Their eclectic food choices are matched by their drinks menu with numerous types of cocktails, beers, wines, and sangria.   With a large group, we were able to try a bunch of their most popular tapas. My favorites included the ahi tuna skewer with mustard-ginger glaze, the ham and cheese croquetas, and the manchego mac 'n cheese. The firefly fish sticks were a bit over-fried. For dessert, we tasted the banana-nutella sandwiches and the trio of gelatos. Nothing special that couldn't be store-bought and made at home.   All in all, Firefly is a nice place to grab a drink and some food after work, but I imagine the value to be better during happy hour 3-6 PM or reverse happy hour 11-1 AM.",

We planned our entire wedding from across the country, so we put our trust in the 5-star yelp reviews Firefly already had. We were a little nervous booking a dinner for over 30 guests having never tried the food, but in this case, the reviews were absolutely right.  HUGE shout out to Fernanda! She totally put us at ease, helped us make our reservation, choose our menu, answer any questions, and everything in between. She was super helpful, got back to us quickly, and adjusted the contract to our needs. We wound up having a few more guests than we originally anticipated, and they were more than accommodating.   When we arrived for dinner, they had a private room set up for us. Fernanda was actually there with Regina and Neo; they all took really amazing care of us the entire night. Every single tapa was top notch and the drinks were amazing (sangria and mojitos were especially fantastic). People are still raving about how great the food was, even the few picky eaters we had with us. My sister, who doesn't eat seafood, actually came up and went \"OMG did you try the shrimp?!\". That says a lot! Firefly also allowed us to bring in our own cake (they recommended an amazing bakery, Freed's), set up a table for it, and brought it to the back to cut and serve all the guests. Everyone's drinks were full all night and we all left extremely satisfied.  I want to come back to Vegas just to come back to Firefly! It was the best meal we had our entire trip and the staff is amazing.",

Yes! The carrots! We ended up re-ordering more carrots during our meal because they were the star of the show, they ate more like ribs than anything else, deliciously roasted in a BBQish sauce. If you do anything here, get the carrots. I promise they'll blow your mind. Patio seating during the evening (in the spring) is lovely.",

This most recent time I came with my boyfriend and parents for an early Father's Day celebration. The location parking kinda sucks which is my only reason for a 4 star rather than 5 since it's so hard to find a spot when it's busy.  This time we ordered quite a few different things. My favorites were the steak and mushroom skewers, stuffed peppers and stuffed mushrooms. Their bacon wrapped dates are also very good. Don't let the word tapas fool you as some of these plates are pretty large portions.  I also have to recommend the red sangria, so good! They don't skimp on the liquor either.",

    "text": "First off, parking was a nightmare. I would avoid this place Friday to Sunday for dinner. Yes, there's free valet but they park your car like they're playing tetris.   Next, the food. The food presentation is great as is the ambiance, but most of what we got was jusy OK. Based on the price point and parking experience I probably would not be back. Yardbird was better.   *BACON WRAPPED DATES: sweet and savory bites of heaven. A MUST TRY.   *STUFFED PEPPERS: good flavor just a bit much on the cream cheese.   *FIREFLY FRIES: you can get these fries at McDonald's and sprinkle Parmesan on it. The Parmesan melted together and was difficult to distribute for taste.   *FIREFLY BURGER : we asked for medium, but it was pretty much med rare. Nothing special just your average burger.    *PAELLA, as others have mentioned - order first as it takes like 30 to 40 min. It was good, but unfortunately we were pretty much full when it arrived at our table.",

Our favorites were the apple salad, mac n cheese and the steak skewers! Everything had great flavor and the bread was also delicious. The Fly Tai cocktail was very light and refreshing. I would definitely recommend Firefly and can't wait to visit again!",

All of the tapas that we got were tasty, but the real highlight was the stuffed dates. I don't like dates, but they were decorated with so many other things that it didn't even matter anymore. The dates were wrapped with bacon and topped with blue cheese with a sprinkling of some red wine and smoked almond somewhere in there. It was an explosion with every bite.  We also ordered a pitcher of sangria because it's a tapas bar, who doesn't? I didn't take it too well though. Ended up with a bad headache. It was probably too sugary for my brain.  Sounds like this place can get packed on the weekend, but we went during off-peak hours and it was pretty empty. Parking wasn't an issue either with plenty of space behind the restaurant. Definitely would come back for the tapas, but I'd probably go elsewhere for drinks.",

As is typical with large parties the restaurant under staffs the table and the service is poor; however, the restaurant still tacks on an automatic gratuity, in this case 20%.    I find paying an automatic 20% gratuity on poor service very annoying.  I don't blame the wait staff but the restaurant management for under staffing large groups.  If you plan an event here you should consider a pre-event meeting with the restaurant management regarding either providing sufficient staff to serve your table or dropping the automatic 20% gratuity.",

It's a popular place and a Little too noisy and dark for me, but I would definitely come back.  I was waited on by 3 different people and never left waiting and had some bread and flavored butter that was a great appetizer And I didn't expect it.   I had the pork empanadas and the chicken  and chorizo stuffed mushrooms ( my wife would've loved).  Everything was good and I topped it off with a couple of Long Island iced teas.  A little expensive for the lit , but they were perfect.  I didn't try the stuffed dates this time, maybe next time.  Also I might try the warm spinach salad.  Was just the right size with 2 dishes, I was not over stuffed and the waitress Elena C was great.  This was the first time anyone ever asked me if I had any allergies, so that was impressive!  Great job Elena!  She even separated the drinks on 2 separate tabs for me, what a gal!",

    "text": "Went here for a friend's birthday. Haven't been since they closed down the original one across the parking lot.  One thing that struck me is how big Firefly is. It's a huge establishment which is nice. I feel the new location is much bigger than the old place. This is a definite plus.  Drinks. I did not order a fruity drink (like sangria or mojito) but I saw people order them. The mojitos are drowning in mint. Barely any drink in there. That was a downside. The beers on tap though are actually pretty good. You would think they would only specialize in mixed drinks, but they had some nice Belgian Tripels on tap that really packed a punch.  Food. The bacon wrapped stuffed dates are what you get. Get a couple of orders. Quite possibly the best item on the menu. Fried Calamari was okay, they give you a bunch. Bit chewier than I wanted it but it was still good. Empanadas were okay, nothing special. Tierra y mar skewers were very delicious. This is the one with filet mignon on a skewer along with some other tasty morsels. For dessert, the flan was fantastic.   Service. Just like many other restaurants, there seems to be a communication issue with servers. You'll have a server take your order (dates), then they'll disappear. Another server will come and take someone else's order. That person's order will come out before yours. You'll see another server, ask about your order as another server is walking aimlessly around asking every table if they ordered dates. This just happens so often with every order. Luckily, all my food arrived without much trouble but I can only imagine that other people's meals aren't so lucky. The positive is that every server was very nice and was trying very hard.   Overall, I like the new location better. It's bigger, better atmosphere and the food didn't make me sick.",

    "text": "The tapas in LA area are much more flavorful. Why is this one 4 times the price? Oh wait never mind...  They tried to make a pimento kind of butter with their bread but it was more than a little sour. I don't know how. We ordered our food and my  ceviche tasted like old fish and was also pretty sour. My veggie empanada was a really weird combination of things thrown together that tasted old. And the paella, although cooked fresh, was not very flavorful.   The servers kept ignoring us, although I wouldn't think a table of 9 is easy to miss. When they took the orders, we did ask ahead of time to split it 3-way for it to be easier. When I told her my order, I said the ceviche and veggie empanada... When the food came out, they gave us an extra plate of tartare and said I ordered it. When I said no and repeated my order, she insisted I said so, even though my eating buddies said no as well. Even more so she avoided our table, and then the new waitress came over 3 times to fill 10 ml of water (it was about an inch tall in the glass). But even then, when we told her our needs, service came really slowly (I believe water girl isn't supposed to do more than fill water and run small errands)... Probably because the other one didn't want to help us out.   I wouldn't come back here again. I can't stand mediocre, overpriced food. We each ended up paying more than a buffet per person (except for the two girls who didn't order).",

Never ever j remember that somebody ask me about allergies in restaurant. Everything we ordered was delicious. Stuffed dates with unusual kick of bacon, nuts, cheese and reduced red wine but absolute delicious, must try. We also had spicy beef salad, ceviche of shrimp, baked tetilla ( melted tetilla cheese with sun dried tomatoes and chorizo), and mixed paella . Everything was delicious with enough spices. I hate over salted or over spiced food. They had just right. We were told it will take about 40 min to prepare paella so we ordered it first with drinks. Plates with tapas were brought at perfect intervals, as soon as we finished one, next was coming. I would recommend to visit this place off the strip about 2.4 miles from Caesar casino.",

    "text": "Ahh! One of my favorite places EVER.  Every time we come here I get Sangria.  They have red, white, and sparkling.  They are all delicious, but I think sparkling is my favorite.  **Half off pitchers of sangria during happy hour!  They bring you complimentary bread with almond butter.  AMAZING!! Seriously. I would order this stuff if it wasn't given.  We always ask for another order.  My top 3 tapas are the firefly fishsticks, the ham & cheese croquetas, and the salmon toast.  I was really excited for the parmesan fries, but they aren't very good.  I have tried them twice and both times they were soggy and bland.  I also really like the babyback ribs (with mango BBQ sauce), the lamb chops, the petit filet mignon, and the fruit & cheese platter.  My boyfriend loves that they have Pacifico here.  He loves the stuffed peppers, bacon wrapped dates, and the tierra y mar skewers.  I like that this place is tapas style that way we can get a wide assortment of food.  I'd suggest getting at least 3 dishes per person as they are pretty small.  We have tried a couple desserts here but weren't very fond of them.  Last time we tried the flan.  We have had the banana nutella sandwiches twice and both times they were made differently.  The first time they were delicious.  They were fritters stuffed with bananas and strawberrys in them and nutella on top.  Last time we went they were literally nutella sandwiches, which we can make at home.  I don't know why they were different.. Maybe because the fritter styled ones were at the Sahara location?  But no more desserts for us, we'll just stick to the tapas.  Service is usually pretty good.  The food comes out as it is prepared.  We will continue being repeat customers.",

    "text": "Hey in life everyone deserves a second chance.   I remember before moving to Vegas I read an article about a restaurant that received the worst nightmare it could have as an establishment. Like everyone else who searches a business on Yelp, of course we look for the negative or 1 star reviews. Aren't we all entertained by bad press?   Fast forward my friend randomly took me out the first week I moved <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhere.to&s=39487568443e0346bde32c016a1db6da62139d18990453ec4db2aa590b53565b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">here.to</a> a salsa night. The meals that night were pretty fantastic I must say. Loved the Sangria and all was well until my friend mentioned about the history of the restaurant.. then BAMMMM! In my mind I was thinking \"No F*in way this is the restaurant I read about in the paper?!... You bring me HERE!?\"   Good times.   Any who, I've been here maybe a handful of times since then and I haven't been disappointed thus far. Most of the time I don't order myself so I can't give any recommendations except for the awesome sangria and comped bread with orange butter.   There is a latin night on Fridays and it's pretty neat. I prefer the old school salsa dancing and they play a few here and there but it's mostly merengue, cumbia, and latin electronic music (it exists folks).   I'd definitely go back.. sometimes through failure companies can figure out what went wrong and ensure it doesn't happen again. Business is going well.. so either they got it together or we just love Firefly to not care!",

I made reservations for 13 about a week in advance since my company had a conference out here in LV; and they were able to accommodate it easily. With a large group, and a loud/happy group of people, all our servers were FAST, answered all our questions, and made sure we were well taken-cared of (probably b/c they knew they'd get a great tip). Food came out super-quick and their water / beverage replenishment was on point!  - We were also celebrating one of our co-worker's bdays and they were able to keep the cake in the back and bring it out to surprise her after dinner!  2) The Food: again, WOW. I haven't been to a spanish tapas restaurant in awhile, and this made me just want to go everyday! The food was fantastic. With such a large group, we were able to order a good variety from the menu, and honestly, everything was great!  - Just to name a few favorites: Tuna tartare, ceviche, bacon wrapped dates - We also had the seafood paella which was very delicious BUT there were parts of it that was way too fishy - which made me worry & wonder if they washed the seafood since I haven't tasted anything so....\"seafoody\" (& I'm not even that picky and eat lots of seafood). BUT again, since the service and EVERYTHING else was so great, I couldn't knock off a point for this but thought it was still important to mention.  3) The Sangria: Saving the best for last - oh. my. SO GREAT. The end.  Overall, awesome experience. Thanks to the employees that waited on us! They were so fast and ensured our drinks/water was always replenished! I will be taking my fiance here when we return to Vegas next month!",

They don't take same day reservation, and it's easier to park if you come like 5pm.   Employees: my waiter is so nice and patient, we took little long to order, and he always come back and make sure we are ok on the menu and refill the drink on time.  Shrimp tempura: I love this dish so much I constantly order it, it comes with very decent portion, the shrimp size is amazingly big, the they fried veggies are so tasty, I like to dip everything in the sauce that comes with it.  Baked cod: The seasoning is on point, and the sauce goes perfect with the fish, the crispy on top of it give this dish different texture and joyful for mouth.  Chicken and chorizo stuffed mushroom: It comes with 4 in total, one bite of it you will taste everything together, the meat juicy is drizzling down, it's amazing.  Camarones Al Ajllo: I love the jumbo size shrimp, its mouth full. The garlic sauce underneath is haven, I asked extra break just to dip the sauce from it.  Chicken Skewers: The presentation is nice, they have squash grill underneath the chicken skewers, the chicken taste tender, but is just difficult to take it out from the stick.  I'm a regular customer of firefly, I will definitely come back again. Good job!",

I like almost everything we ordered except for the steak skewer. I think they could have done better with the steak to make it more tender but other than that, everything else was great especially their bread.",

Tried the bacon wrapped dates, it was a great pair. Paella mixed had a lot of flavor. Very very big to share with at least 4-5 people. Also tried the pulpo Asado, the octopus and potatoe had a lot of flavor and I was very impressed with this one. Octopus was actually not rubbery. The only downfall is parking. Come early or I would suggest Uber.",

    "text": "Las Vegas is known as a culinary hub for a reason -- no matter what worldly cuisine you're craving, you'll be able to find a place that has it. I've posted plenty of reviewed for Asian cuisine, but this time around I'm going to Europe for this review. More specifically, this is a personal food wish of mine that I'm fulfilling! Driving home from work, I've always driven by Firefly on the route home, but I've never actually stopped in until fairly recently.  Firefly is a Spanish restaurant that specializes in Spanish fare -- though they have paella that several people can share, their real draw is in their tapas, small plates or appetizers that can range from hot to cold, meat to vegetable, and everything in between. It is these tapas that I will be focusing on for my review!  Of course, they bring out bread for snacking on while you wait -- though the real surprise was in their butter, a light honey and almond affair that made the bread itself very irresistible. And again, their taps are broad enough in range that you could get any combination of them and have a complete meal! As I came in during happy hour, I ordered tapas from both the happy hour menu and the regular menu.  The photos I've included in this review show the wide range of food I ordered -- particular highlights include the petit filet mignon ( so tender and flavorful ), the apple and manchego salad ( surprisingly light and perfectly sweet and savory ),  the ham and cheese croquetas ( crisp, very flavorful, and VERY addicting ), the pork empanada ( rich with deliciously flaky pastry ), and the chocolate tres leches cake for dessert ( so good! ).  One may recall that Firefly was in the pews a while back due to a food poisoning incident, which admittedly made me apprehensive about coming in to try the food in the first place. I'm happy that I came in despite my apprehension, though -- regardless of what one orders you can easily find something you'll like on this menu. Do yourself a favor and come here! You won't regret it.",

Our waiter was accommodating and knew the menu in and out and gave great suggestions from each of the menu sections. He was prompt with our drinks too! My friend is preggo and wanted a fun mocktail so he brought back something she loved without alcohol.   We only ordered 4 plates (he suggested 2 per person was the norm). Pork empanadas, the bacon wrapped stuffed dates, artichoke toast and a meat skewer   I don't like dates but the waiter said they were very popular so I dove in wanting to plug my nose just in case they were disgusting and wanted to spit it in my napkin. Buutttt....they were freakin awesome!! The almond in the middle was a nice touch!  You've gotta try these!!  Artichoke toast - i love artichokes and sauce and the aioli was yummy.   Empanadas - the pastry was not doughy, it was light and absolutely perfect!! The pork was tender as well. No complaints at all!  Tierra y Mar Skewers - Loved these!! There was grilled shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo sausage on the skewer and topped with salsa verde - makes my mouth water thinking about it again.   It was pretty loud in there but it didn't both us at all.  Parking I read is hard but, we didn't have an issue, although we did come on a Thursday at 6:15. By the time we left the lot was full.   There are so many other things I want to try on the menu so I'll definitely be back to explore more.",

    "text": "We were looking for a decent place to dine at midnight. It's Vegas, so I figured there had to be something open. They served tapas until 2am and had excellent reviews, so I initially thought it was perfect! However, I came across multiple articles on how this restaurant just couldn't get it together with health inspections and multiple cases of food poisoning. I was skeptical, but I still decided to take the risk!  We ordered the firefly fries - good for a big group to share, but not worth getting for 2 with all the other options. The Tierra y mar skewers with salsa verde was \"ok\" - I wouldn't order it again. It just wasn't special and I've had better. The manchego mac n cheese gave me a mini heart attack with every bite, but those basked pasta shells were delish! The chicken tinga empanada was excellent, but it left me wanting more of it! The camarones a la Diabla had a real sweet and spicy kick to it. It tasted like it had quite a bit of siracha. It was tasty, but not my favorite.  The last item was the bacon wrapped dates. I do not like dates, but these bites were little pieces of heaven. Sweet and salty, with an almond crunch in the middle. I still couldn't believe how good it was. I don't like dates, but I liked these! It comes with 5 per order, so perfect for 2-3 people.  The evening was topped with the trio of gelato - vanilla and chocolate were good, but not as good as the pistachio flavor! Love love love! We also ordered the chocolate tres leches cake to go. Our server said it was a must have, so I wasn't leaving without it. Hopefully, it's still good tomorrow!  I gave this review 4 stars because of a couple things, the hostess wasn't very friendly (our server was good though) and there were so many options on the menu. They should really cut it down and focus on the items that are really good. Not everything we ordered was that good, I will only rate a restaurant give 5 stars when ALL the food is excellent.   I might go back next time I'm in town, in depends how good this chocolate tres leches cake is.",

The service was not at fault and she did remove an item from my bill I could not eat. But the food quality unfortunately as not as great as it once was.",

    "text": "We picked Firefly for our 11/12 wedding reception, as this was frequently one of our favorite places in Vegas for dinner, and they had a nice banquet room, big enough for our party (45 people). I communicated primarily with Regina to set everything up. I'm a project manager, so I tend to over communicate, and communicate frequently, and expect the same in return. Sometimes I would have to follow-up for a response, which made me hesitant at times, but on the day of the event, it was clear that everyone (including all of the vendors) had communicated just fine, and Regina had everything set up perfectly. Our other vendors included a DJ, Elvis w/ Showgirls, & a Desert Bar. We had a bar set up in the back for our guests, and we thought they did a great job separating the rooms for cocktail hour, dinner, and dancing. The best part, Firefly's food! It did not fail. I was nervous that if we had a lot of food, it would come out cold, and slow. I was wrong. It came out hot, and quick. The only complaint from my guests were that they wish they knew what was coming out- as they ate a lot in the beginning, but didn't realize how many courses there were. My Grandmother wasn't a fan of the food (very different for her!), but they were so nice to make her some ribs with no sauce, and she was happy. All in all, we were very happy with our event at Firefly, and I was glad I didn't need to worry about a thing! Thank you!!",

From my past visits I have never ordered an actual entree because I'd usually get full off of their tapa's menu but my friend ordered a steak entree, which was pretty big and presented nicely. The food is okay but in my opinion it is on the pricey side for certain items you get. The environment is a bit dim inside setting a relaxed ambiance. The first time I came to their restaurant it was hard for me to see others in my group on the other end of the table because it was so dark. However, the other times I came after, the lighting was better. Customer service has been okay, they are nice and try to get our orders in as quick as possible. The wait is pretty long but Firefly is always busy so it is expected from this type of business. I have been a consistent customer for the past 4 years since they moved locations and each visit they get better and better.",

    "text": "I recently used Firefly for my wedding cocktail reception.  We did a destination wedding with only 18 of us, so I wanted somewhere small, with drinks, and food for after the ceremony before we all took off to party on the strip.  This place fit the bill perfect.  The Food - It was amazing.  We only had the passed appetizers, but if this is any indication of their menu, then omg we are definitely going back for dinner the next time we're in Vegas. We had the bacon wrapped dates, the ham and cheese croquetas, and the steak and mushroom skewers.  Everything was delicious!  Our guests had nothing but good things to say about the food.  The atmosphere - The decor was nice and fit the theme of the restaurant.  Everything was clean and well presented.  The area where our reception took place was private and well decorated.  The staff -  The staff were awesome.  Everyone was polite, attentive, and very professional.  When we arrived at the reception there wasn't any seating or low tables.  I asked one of the staff if we could please get some chairs.  We got a full seating, I was so thankful as we had people who needed to sit and ladies in heels looking for a rest.  Booking our space was easy.  We worked with Regina who was friendly and responded to my emails quickly.  We were able to make last minute adjustments to the reception due to last minute changes with our guests.  Why 4 stars.  I held back a star due to how our reception ended.  As we were winding down staff started coming in and moving tables, clearing our cake, and bar service ended.  The clean up went on for about 10 minutes before the staff came over and very politely asked us to please wrap it up.  Our reception was from 5:30 - 7:30, and I checked my phone thinking we must have gone over our time.  It was 7:20 when I checked and I estimate they began cleaning up around 7:10.  While not the end of the world, I was a bit miffed that time that I had paid for was basically shorter than I expected as staff closed our reception down about 20 minutes early.  Again, not major, but if I were to ever do it again I would make it clear I want my space for the full time.  I still highly recommend this place for dining or an event.  I know that I will be back when in town again.",

And it's because I'm so in love with this place!  It's perfect for groups or dates because tapas are the best thing ever!  I have tried a lot of things on their menu, but not everything.  I hope to try everything, but there are so many choices!  And of course you have to get your favorites, too.  My go to favorites are the empanadas, baked goat cheese, chorizo clams, to name a few.  I'd probably list all the stuff I've tried, if I could.  But yes, I still have to try all.  Go with a few friends and have each person pick a couple so you can taste a variety.  I mean, hopefully, everyone would pick different items!  And the best thing to drink is the sangria.  Tapas and sangria are so awesome together.  The sangria tastes great and isn't watered down or bitter.  Trust me on this even if you don't care for wine, get the sangria!  Normally it's just a couple of us, so we've never had to wait for a table.  I know if you have a large group, you should make reservations.  There is ample parking and the service is awesome.  Kind of random though, when a person just drops food and takes off.  They normally tell you what it is.  But with me, I normally forget what I've ordered and I'll sit there wondering, did I get this?  But usually it is something I've ordered.  Rarely do I get someone else's order.  Service is always quick and friendly, I just love it!  I can't wait to return to Las Vegas to come back!  I need to try more items!  With Sangria!! Yay!!",

I have a ton of favs at Firefly that I typically order but am never disappointed when trying something new (lots of options on the menu).   *Things to note -Infused potato vodka with lychees and berries..YUM.  -Pitchers of Sangria are perfect for a group.  -Manchango & apple salad- looks plain but full of flavor.  -Any of the empanadas are delightful.  -Salmon bagels are excellent  -All the skewers are tasty, especially the shrimp and ahi.  -Tomato basil soup with the little sandwich is great comfort food -BACON WRAPPED DATES are a must-do.  -Flour-less chocolate cake   And I have yet to try stuff off the brunch menu but will sooner than later (especially the lemon blueberry pancakes).   -Unlimited mimosas and bloody's on Sunday for $20",

From the happy hour menu we had bacon wrapped dates, veggie, cx and pork empanadas. Personal favorites are the pulpo and empanadas. It's off strip, which was nice break from the hustle and bustle.",

He ate everything,  as did the other two of us,  for a total of nine (maybe ten) tapas; plus he ordered bottomless mimosas. The food was SUPERB! To commemorate our travels and forever remember the wonderful experience we even bought wine glasses.  The food was so good,  we went back on Tuesday but unfortunately being wasn't an option,  the menu was limited and the bananas beignet that I fantasized about weren't an option.  We each agreed if ever traveling to Vegas again,  we'd return,  but only for brunch.",

    "text": "I haven't been back to Firefly in years because of the crazy salmonella outbreak that happened at their two previous locations. If you don't know what happened, there used to be a location in Henderson and one where Tacos and Beer is right now (same owners). There was a huge salmonella outbreak in the Tacos and Beer location that made a ton of people sick and hospitalized, including some friends of mine. The health department then checked their Henderson location and it had to be shut down because of the health grade.   The only reason why I came back was because my friends wanted to go and it is conveniently located near our office. I ordered the Firefly burger, which was actually pretty good. The fries were a bit under seasoned but the burger had really good flavor. They have a vegan menu here too if you're into that. I didn't order sangria because I had to go back to work. I won't be coming back just because I'm still not over the whole salmonella thing, sorry!",

    "text": "Pros: Food is pretty good Large selection Lots of vegetarian and vegan items Moderate pricing  Cons: Loud, definitely have to increase your voice level to talk to the person across the table from you Some dishes could be executed better   I came here with my friend on a Thursday night and we were seated within five minutes though the place is filled and booming. One of the most immediate things we noticed was the volume of the setting. We chose four tapas plates, albondigas, empanadas, scallops escargot, and heart of palm \"crab cakes.\"   The albondigas which are a type of meatball in a tomato sauce with cheese were delicious and warm.   The empanadas, which was really just one cut in half was good, but maybe a little heavy. I understand that it is an empanada, but I've had empanadas that are lighter and airier. The pulled pork with the cream cheese and the aioli on top was a little much.   The scallops \"escargots\" were good, they came in a pesto like sauce with a lemon to squeeze over. They were good, the flavor was spot on but... I wish they were seared more for a crisp outside, they didn't have much of a crust at all, so I was slightly disappointed.   The palm of hearts crab cakes was vegan, really just a mix of vegetables seasoned with old bay and served with a mustard aioli which was quite citrusy. These were good, but not necessarily crabby except for the old bay and the shape of them. However, they were still tasty.   Overall, I'd return, but I'd likely try some of their other dishes, which isn't a problem because they have a huge variety. Our bill was $36 for four plates.",

And parking was a pain in the butt.  I'm very impressed with the new building, it's spacious and very nicely decorated.     I heard some things about the previous location being closed because it was unclean, but I felt really confident eating here, everything was 'sparkling clean'. The waitstaff was pleasant, and very quick on service. And for me (as it always was) the food was just amazing.   We got a pitcher of the blood orange mojito as suggested from friends, but It was to strong for my taste and over priced. We will stick to the good stuff in the future (Big firefly sangria fans here)    Our favorite  things to order from here are the Bacon wrapped dates (YUM), The mac n' cheese, the sliders, and the stuffed mushrooms. My bf is obsessed with the stuffed peppers also. Im not a cream cheese fan, but I take his word they're good. Also tried for the first time last night Tres Leche   The reason for the loss of a star is although its delicious I feel its a tad over-priced. Still, doesn't keep me from coming back though ;) (just not as often)",

I was told by the manager this was due to to people complaining that it was too sweet.  Well...if you don't like sweet, get a regular mojito.  They made me a new one the \"old way\" but it wasn't the same.  This was a year ago.

Than there was the Clams in a tasty broth with chunks of sausage in it, that was really good just a tab bit too much sausage flavor as it took away from the clams having any flavor at all.   We also ordered a Safron type of rice that was wayyyyyy to overpowering that flavor was stuck in my mouth all night.  I'm thinking we ordered wrong and there was possibly way better dishes on the menu than what we choose.   I would give this place a 2nd chance but probably at a different location.",

Highly recommend!",

The service was excellent, food very good, reasonable prices, unique dishes, nice atmosphere, easy parking.  It's where the locals eat, as well as the folks you see performing for you on the strip.    It's where you will spend half of what you will spend on the strip, and get double the quality.    We would check this restaurant out again next time in Vegas.",

Food was great but service was horrible.  When I say service, I mean only the waiter.  Drinks took forever to come out, refills bahh, food plates remained on table as more food was being served, and we never got bread.  Can't split checks, come on upgrade your system.  - 2 stars.  Came again for happy hour with just one other and the food still tasted great.  Bacon wrapped dates still delicious, mango ribs still killed it, firefly fries, sangria, everything was just as good but with better service.  - 4 stars.  If I ever come back, it'll probably be for happy hour.  And I would definitely recommend Firefly's for one of Vegas' best happy hour option.",

But yeah nothing too special to be honest with you guys.   The salads were good, I'm not a salad girl but I'll f*ck up a salad there for sure. The empanadas have a freaky texture but they're packed with flavor and I know you're asking hey why is this place average tho ..  Listen up it just didn't wow me like I thought it would.",

Atmosphere: Typical tapas place.  Not a complaint at all, but don't expect anything above and beyond in terms of atmosphere.  It looked like a nice date spot. In fact we sat next to a couple on a birthday date and honestly it looked perfect. They even had a private photographer who came around and took photos.  Food: I feel like we ordered a ton of stuff, ironically my favorite dishes were the roasted vegetables and the grilled peppers (not sure what they are actually called). I've been back for over a week and I'm still thinking about those peppers, they were the perfect blend of sweet (not spicy peppers) and salty.  My other favorite dish was the scallop \"escargots\".  I must admit, they did a fantastic job with this dish.  The presentation and flavor was spot on.  Firefly escalated a scallop dish in an inventive way that I have never seen before, and I always appreciate that.  We didn't drink or have dessert so I can't speak on either of those topics. I would definitely come here again.",

Parking was free and plentiful behind the restaurant, although rush hour traffic made it a bit difficult to get to. We timed our visit to take advantage of the Happy Hour specials and had the inside dining area to ourselves at 5pm on a Wednesday.   We started with a beer and a sparkling sangria ($5) which was both strong and sweet! We got several of the $4 tapas specials to sample and share including the wonderful French Fries and some rather standard little Meatballs. The \"must try\" Stuffed Dates were delicious and I am craving that sweet-salty flavor combo now as I type. The blue cheese really makes the dish. The Apple Manchego Salad was light and flavorful and went so well with the other heavier plates.  We saved room for dessert as the Chocolate Tres Leches ($7) stood out to me and the Chocolate Bread Pudding ($7) caught my husband's eye. Both were delicious and he finished the bread pudding, but the Tres Leches cake was definitely meant for a crowd! Mmm, all of that for only $40 plus tax and tip!",

Firefly Fries - came with parmesan cheese on them and an aioli sauce on the side, heaven. Garlic Bread w/ sweet creamed butter - bread was soft and the butter was mixed with some sort of spices... sad when we finished the plate. White Sangria - sweet and tart, not disappointed.  FINALLY Dessert Platter!  Caramel Flan - I HATE flan, this one changed my mind. Did not have a rubbery consistency which is what usually turns me off. Lemon Berry Tarts - sweet and tart, perfect. Lemon Berry glaze on the tart was delicious. Mini Cheesecakes - creamy and came topped with a strawberry. Yum. Chocolate Tres Leches Cake - amazing.  Food was so delicious and the service was fast. Irina was our waitress tonite and her busboy was ON HIS GAME. our glasses for water were rarely empty more than 2 minutes.  I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS.

I also appreciate the fact that unlike the old location you can actually have conversations here without yelling or feeling like you are sitting on top of each other.  I have now been here for a private function in a back room, sat at the bar for apps and drinks and most recently for a birthday celebration.    I've never had a problem with service.

    "text": "This place has been my favorite place since they were in the smaller building just right next door. I am glad that they have moved to a bigger restaurant. Being that this is me and my now husband favorite place to eat, we love the atmosphere, but of course the food and the RED SANGRIA.  Being said, we just had our wedding reception there in the patio area. The outside is very nice, the hanging light bulbs, the red and black walls, everything about it made my reception amazing. Ana, Alejandra and their staff was amazing.  Instead of ordering per person, we ordered from the tray menus. We ordered about 5 trays for each 15 different tapas. My guests loved the food and they got really full and the food were still coming. LOL. But they were able to take to-go, which is good, so food doesn't go to waste. Plu, our 4 year old son has severe food allergies to all 8 allergens, they were able to accommodate that and my son loved his baked chicken.  I also was able to do my own kind of decorations, i was also able to hire a DJ, a photographer and a photobooth without going through there vendors. I had a Sweethearts table, a guest sign in and Cake and Sweet Bar. By sketching out how the tables are going to be set up, i was afraid it was going to be tight, but it wasn't...i was able to have a decent size dance floor and still had space to walk around.  I didn't want a big normal wedding reception, I wanted something different, and I am glad I chose this place. For anyone who is trying to do an event, nothing big or extravagant, I recommend inquiring with Fireflys.",

The atmosphere was great for a dinner before a night out on the town. Must-try dishes include the ever-classic bacon wrapped dates, the ahi tuna skewers, and the ribeye. Additionally, I didn't try the paella, but the sangria was decent.",

The pitcher of sangria always gets me tipsy & I try as many things as I can!  I also want to comment on the usage of the color red here, it's super sexy!

    "text": "I was skeptical to come back here, but my friend was insistent on getting tapas. I thought the food was okay, but it wasn't mind-numbingly amazing and mouth watering.  AMBIANCE: 4 - I'm not gonna deny that this is a really nice venue. It is dimly lit with very organized tables inside. Also, they let you sit wherever you want to. With the dim lights, and sitting with my best friend \"alone\" in the lounge--it was pretty romantic haha! The whole place is very lounge-like, and actually pretty comfortable.   SERVICE: 3 - As with many places, the service was pretty good in the beginning, and got slower and worse towards the end! Most of the food came out fast, but some of them came out an hour later than the rest!   FOOD: 3 - I don't have any food that I really want to shine a light on. None of it really popped out at me or was really amazing that it was worth mentioning. Probably the best part of the meal was my strawberry mojito, which was pretty well done!   I'm going to say this as a generalization, because this happened with all the dishes we ordered. The food taste was average to above average. But, with every dish there was major problems such as really dry meat, it sometimes tasted off or not right, or the cheese that they used wasn't as luxurious tasting compared to the rest of the dish.   In conclusion, it was good, but it wasn't great.   Lastly, I don't wanna be one of those people, but I think I should mention this anyway..My friend and I both got stomach aches not long after we ate. I had never eaten there since 2010 or 2011 and my friend had never eaten at Firefly previously.   My real complaint is that they should have kept the Firefly on the west side open instead of this one!",

The new location is very nice!! It's not as dark as the old location but dim enough for mood lightning. The waiter, runners, and busser were on point! Dirty plates taken quickly, we were regularly checked up on, and the food... Whhooooweee, the food!!!  We got bacon-wrapped dates (a must), chicken & chorizo stuffed mushrooms, tierra y mar skewers, and calamari. All were soooo good!! We also got a sangria pitcher that was delicious!   We were stuffed but opted for the passion fruit (lilikoi) cheesecake bites and the lemon-berry tarts. Both were amazing. The passion fruit cheesecake may have been my favorite all night. I'll def be back!!",

The three tapas I got were the apple manchego salad, the tuna tartare, and the manchego mac n cheese. Omg! The salad was so refreshing, the tuna tartare was delicious, a little spice and I love that. A little more avocado would have been right up my alley. And the Mac n cheese, total guilty pleasure. You can never go wrong with Mac n cheese. I will be back, soon, to try the other dishes.",

    "text": "Finally a place I can order several plates and not be judged.....   I like tapas restaurants because you get a little bit of everything and you don't need to order five huge meals to get it. The idea of tapas is to get people at your table to share so you get to experience several dishes and that's exactly what we did.  They started us off with their sweet almond butter and bread. This was complimentary and the only problem was I couldn't stop eating it. The sweet almond butter was addicting! I think I filled up on bread.   We also ordered off the tapas menus:  -The Apple and Manchego salad: Green apple, Manchego cheese, smoked almonds, and light dressing. The salad was light and refreshing if you want a healthier choice. It was good but nothing memorable.  -Veggie Empanadas: Spinach, mushroom, artichoke, herbed cream cheese in a pastry with red pepper aioli. They were served hot and crispy.   -Firefly Fries: Parmesan, herbs, and aioli.  I'm not a fry person but I do prefer thin fries when I eat them. These actually were my least favorite.   -Baked goat cheese: Goat and garlic cream cheese, tomato sauce, pesto, and toast. This was the groups favorite dish. I thought it was great for cheese lovers! So cheesy and delicious!   -Mushroom Tart: puffed pastry, herbed cream cheese and mushroom sauce. This was my favorite. It was rich but also had enough carbs to make me happy!   I also tried The New Girl drink which was house infused Vodka, cranberry, hint of Jalapeno and mint. Delicious! I loved it!   All these tapas dishes were pretty big. They probably run on the bigger side of most tapa plates.  My friends ordered two main dishes:   -Firefly burger with truffle fries   -Clams   Neither of these interested me but everyone seemed to love their food, they all were very happy. It was very busy on this Friday night so it's probably a good idea to make reservations. We came in with no reservation and waited about 30 minutes.  This place was very busy and the atmosphere was fun. There were lots of people at the bar, loud music, and I even saw people dancing. No frowning allowed in here!",

    "text": "I really love Firefly for birthday or special events. The atmosphere is very loud and exciting. Great for large groups ordering tapas or meals for sharing. Or sit at the bar and have a few drinks with a date before heading out for the night. Saturday nights is Latin night in their private room inside the restaurant, I've never been but I've heard great things about it. They change their menu periodically including ingredients on options that have been around for awhile. I absolutely love! Their Red Sangria, at $9 a glass your better off buying a pitcher for $30 and sharing. Be careful they are strong (to my liking).   The food, tapas style, is very good! They have a ton of seafood options and of course you must have the Firefly fries, they are very garlic-y so bring some gum. I recently tried their Ahi Tuna skewers, they were decent and not too filling which was perfect to start the night with.",

My family also loved the petite fillet .. the sauce and the veggies with it really complimented it ... their free bread and butter was also amazingggggg.. it's made of honey , butter, and almonds . We couldn't get enough of it. Service was ok. Their photo booth doesn't work . Paella was a bit lacking for us ... specially me, because I was in Spain earlier and I couldn't help but compare The ones I tried there to Fireflies . But there's a reason firefly is called FIREFLY TAPAS. Go for their tapas !! Oh and also , for the sampler plate .. the one I liked there was the passion fruit cheese cake . Patatas bravas also was in the same level as the ones they have in Spain .",

The sangrias are amazing and the red one is my favorite. The ceviche tastes so authentic to me it's so limey and good! I also got the lentils with veggies which are delicious as well and the tomato basil soup is great so is the baked cod but they put too much fried onion on top next time I'll say light on it or non at all. The customer service is great he kept making sure we are good!! I highly recommend this place! I heard they have great brunch I need to try it sometime!",

Stuffed Dates - Fire!  Tuna Poke with Chips - really good  Serrano Ham - really good  Fruit and Cheese platter - So good, I don't know why it's on the dessert menu  Beef empanada - Fire!  BBQ ribs - Fire  Lamb Chops - Bomb!  Han Croquettes - Would have been good but were cold  Fried Calamari - Good  Ricotta cheese served hot - Fire!

Got two plates out of every category on the menu and it was plenty for two people including desert.   Came back again for drinks and small appetizers before our actual dinner reservation!

It's a pretty big space but also busy so a reservation would definitely help. They also seem to be stricter about being on time, we were 10 minutes late and they had marked us as not shown up on open table. So just keep that in mind! Below are the dishes we tried.  Shrimp ceviche - shrimp was over cooked and it was way too much lime taste  Empanadas - good but wasn't amazing. Would've liked more than just one empanada  Stuffed peppers - a bit too much cheese stuffing. First bite was good but then got a bit sickening  Fried egg on top of potatoes (forget the name) - also was okay. Good taste but nothing special  Lamb chops on lentils - favorite dish. Would order these again  Overall if you're looking for a great taps joint I would say this missed the mark for us. We did also have a pitcher of mojito though and that was very good and boozy!",

It's located pretty close to where I'm at. Many people around me say they love it. They know what they're talking about. If you're with a group it can get pretty squishy inside. That also goes for the patio. Happy hour is actually a little less crazy. The later it gets the busier it gets it seems. Even late into the night. The happy hour has some great prices though.   A good place for getting crazy while staying classy. Fantastic drinks and also good food. Fun times.",

I've heard this place is popping during dancing time and it definitely was packed during the dinner hour.  The service was great as the server was making sure we had enough water since we didn't order drinks. The one thing we found comical was if the plates weren't stacked the bus girl would only pick up one plate.  I would go back but to try other dishes but mostly during happy hour. I believe you get more of what your money is worth going to happy hour.  I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what it's like during dancing.",

Be sure to make reservations if you want a table, my friends and I sat at the bar.   Seafood paella: Delicious, savory mouthfuls of rice and seafood. The shellfish was not gritty at all, the rice perfectly cooked seasoned with so many different herbs and spices. It'll leave your tastebuds tingling! The dish can feed up to four people, it's huge!   Salmon Toast: Delicious! Nicely smoked salmon with a nice surprise. It packs a little punch, and there is a touch of citrus, which leaves you happy. I could eat ten of these lol.  Passion fruit mojito: I loved the fresh mint, and I loved the slight hint of passion fruit. But I didn't get a lot of alcohol in mine.   Not featured in the pictures, are the scallops and the chorizo stuffed mushroom. Both were wonderfully cooked to perfection!",

The restaurant is gorgeously decorated with replica's of my favorite Spanish oil painter \" Fabian Perez\", with a romantic dim light to accompany it. Shortly after your seated they serve you complimentary bread and butter. Now as for the tapas they are to die for, some of my favorite's that one must try are:  1. Dates wrapped in bacon with blue cheese crumbs sprinkled over them....  The petite Filet Mignon topped with grilled onions,  The clams in this delectable coconut base, lemon grass and ginger sauce.   Shrimp Ceviche,  These skewers that had filet mignon, shrimp and chorizo (can't remember what they're called, Lol) And  Their lamb chops If you enjoy fine quality dinning and your in Vagas, it's a must to stop by for dinner.",

We pull in and discovered the parking in front is solely for those with the hanging blue sign so you will need to park in back. We walked in and my mind screamed, \"this place is huge and way sexier than their previous Paradise location \".  The place was packed at 730pm so reservations are recommended.   We sat at our dining table for 8... I say this because it was a table for eight and not two tables smushed together. Anyway, Alejandro was our guy but he had a team of 4??? helping him deliver the tasty Tapas as we ordered more and more plates during this grub fest...and refilling our drinks and clearing our empty platters, glasses and stuff to keep the landing strip clear for more food and cocktail arrivals.  The service was impeccable. Thank you Alejandro. Also note, we were a big group that ordered a bunch of stuff. Two of us had to leave early to pick up show tickets. Alejandro was very helpful to provide us with separate checks.   I had the warm spinach salad and I forgot the name but it was a mushroom toast with this incredible sauce poured over it... here it is... dang...  $10 Mushroom Montadito [toasted baguette, shitake, oyster, and button mushrooms, roasted garlic and herb cream, chili oil]  And this...  $7 Warm Spinach Salad [artichoke, red pepper, pine nuts, feta, lemon]  Vegetarian fare that will blow your senses away with their flavors, textures and scents.   It's the kind of menu where you can close your eyes and point, and you will select something that will make your eyes shut with pleasure and as you fight not to utter an eff bomb of delight.   Support you local small businesses.   Enjoy this place!  Oh and I didn't order them this time but the Bacon wrapped dates... dang",

I was abruptly INFORMED by the hostess that there would be a $2.00 fee (per slice) to cut my cake. I explained to her that there wasn't a cake in box, and that we wouldn't be needing anyone to help us with it. She told us that she needed to check with someone to make sure that that was okay. I was pretty put off by this whole interaction, and honestly made to feel like I was doing something wrong. You have to \"check\" with someone before even seating me and my guests? How about saying something pleasant like, 'thank you so much for choosing us for your celebration, will you be needing us to help with your dessert?'   I completely understand when a restaurant would rather have you choose their desserts than bring in your own, but keep in mind that I also brought in a party of 6 who ordered enough food and drinks that I shouldn't be hassled about bringing in something special for my daughter's birthday.",

Because it's a tapas place, each if us decided to grab 2 dishes each to share among the group.  Great food: meatballs, mussels, skewer, 'crab cakes', complimentary bread with tomato butter spread, fries.  These were super yummy and I would order them again. The price was decent for the portion and it was cooked well.   Not so great food: avocado toast, lamb sliders, escargot, octopus, clams. These were definitely not worth the price. The taste was either bland or just wasn't appetizing.   The sangria was amazing. We gulped that down within minutes.   Service was good. Overall, I don't understand the raving review as price was a little pricey and food was decent.",

After the salmonella outbreak, I just went back for the dancing and occasional sangria on Friday's.   Last night totally blew! I would think that after closing down two locations plus upsizing, the restaurant would be better service-focused.   We arrived at 11pm. There weren't available seats at the bar, so we opted for restaurant seating. We ordered our drinks at 11:15 and they didn't arrive until 11:40. No apology from the female server. No apology from anyone. On top of that, she delivered them one at a time. After sometime, she was no where to be seen, but we got another server (I wish I got her name!! She might be Russian or Ukrainian). She definitely stepped up the game. Thank you!  My preference is to get up and walk away from terrible, but when you're not paying the bill, I guess you just take it *insert shrug emoji*.",

The food came out so fast and each plate was more delicious than the last. We tried the Salmon Toast, complimentary bread, lamb Ffilet, a spring salad and empanadas. Every bite was loved.  The patio was adorable - plenty of seating and no wait at 7:30 on a Saturday.   I so wish Firefly was in Milwaukee - this would for sure be our go-to restaurant. I highly recommend!!",

They also have Fernet Valle, which is almost impossible to find here in Vegas!  Only downside is the prices. Be prepared to shell out at least $100+ for two people!",

I love the selection at Firefly, but the amount of delicious food makes it difficult to not order the same things every time I go back. The lamb chops were perfect and they had skewers with shrimp/filet that were packed with flavor! I also recommend the tomato soup, which is served with Fireflies take on a grilled cheese sandwich. It brings back childhood memories in a classy way. Firefly is a great place for a date, night out with the girls, or celebration with friends. The atmosphere varies from fun to romantic,and that's what makes it such a classy place to be! I'm a wine drinker, but I will say that their white and red sangrias are both delicious",

Who'd a thunk Mac n cheese at a Mexican themed joint would be good, well it was. Correction it was great (especially after a wee pinch o salt).  Did I mention the bacon wrapped dates?  And our starter was the manchego and apple salad. I wanted a big bowl of it. It was lightly dressed with chopped, toasted nuts atop. I am going to make that at home - twice.  Did I mention the bacon wrapped dates? Maybe?  Go. Have fun & eat like a local in Vegas. Bring some friends and sit in the gangster alcove in the back.",

When food is not served at the right temperature, then I'm over it.  The garlic cream cheese stuffed peppers sounded better on paper than they did on the plate.  The cream cheese completely separates from the pepper when you cut into it.  No bueno!  The best part of my meal is the garlic bread and sweet butter.  That was good!  Restaurant is dark and very large.  Self-parking in the back.  I was put off by the large number of kitchen workers taking their break outside of the restaurant that backs into the parking.  I also didn't like seeing the numerous servers inside the restaurant all chatting with one another waiting for something to do.",

I am a fan of their spicy shrimp tapa... can't remember the name of it but it's  sinfully good. Great place for casual business dinners, or girls night out.

We made a reservation which was super convenient, we were seated within 15 minutes..place has a very trendy vibe,bar area was very appealing,and it is more on the louder side but it's only cause everyone is genuinely enjoying themselves... We ordered a few beers and a pitcher of sangria,very very tasty and refreshing.. We ordered tapas, our faves were the ceviche ,and lamb chops= super yummy.. The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 was the service, our waiter seemed to have forgotten about us by mid dinner. Overall a pretty good experience, and I will definitely come back when in town.",

Our drinks, house Shandy and a Cherry Mule, delicious different and just right after long flight. Small plates includes spicey steak salad which was a palate explosion and chorizo stuffed mushrooms.

    "text": "Those of you who know me or have read my reviews know that I generally only review a restaurant for which I completely disagree with the average reviews on Yelp.  I figure a great restaurant with 5000 reviews praising their establishment doesn't need another similar review for someone to wade through.  This is not one of those occasions.  I suppose I should have seen the stale, tough bread as a sign.  If I did, I chose to ignore it.  Overall, the food was hit-and-miss.  The apple manchego salad was nice - light and refreshing.  The ubiquitous bacon-wrapped dates were fine, the recommended shrimp, chorizo and filet skewers disappointing and the also-recommended grilled octopus just terrible.  Neither seafood option was fresh - the octopus was tough and tasted off, with a miss-matched sauce and generic potatoes.  The filet was fine, but the shrimp were frozen and in short supply.  The chorizo almost non-existant.  My real issues here are with the restaurant in general.  This was, by far, the most unimaginative, pretentious, poorly-executed and disappointing tapas restaurant I have ever been to.  The menu is just plain boring.  Come on, this is tapas!  Give me something exciting I've never seen before.  Give me crazy combinations and flavors.  At least give me something simple done perfectly.  I know this is Vegas, but off-the-strip Vegas.  House music?  Really?  An entrance like a steak house out of the 60s?  Pretentious waiters and bartenders who would rather talk to each other than their customers?  I have heard about this place for years, had friends recommend it and was anxious to try it.  Maybe it just can't live up to the hype.  Don't waste your money in town where great food is everywhere.  It's not worth the drive.  It's not worth the money.  It's not worth eating here at all.",

    "text": "I have nothing positive to say about my experience at Firefly on Paradise.  The service was the most awful thing ever.  I was in management for a Forbes rated the hotel for a long time, and I would be seriously embarrassed if my team ever acted like this team.  We were sat at a table outside, and then we were left for 20 minutes before anyone checked in on us. During this time, all the tables around us were being serviced. I watched the waiter check in with several tables. 25 minutes into this experience the busser brought waters, and the waiter came over. He didn't say Hello, he said what do you want to drink. I was expecting some type of reason why he was ignorning us. The paito wasn't that full.  He took the order and left.  During this time the manager was walking around the patio area.  I also watched the manager of Firefly mingle with what appeared to his friends and several other tables except ours. During this time, the manager made eye contact with me four times (I was giving the look of hey how's it going can you please assist me), but he failed to do anything.  He started to walk our direction, and I was about to speak up to him, but he turned his focus to a table full of young women. The service should be the focus, I can understand if you are speaking with your guests, but this was not the case.  He continued to check in on what appeared to be his friends and tables full of young women. Each time he did this he was chatting it up for several minutes.  We were still waiting for our drinks at this point about 35 minutes into our experience. At this point, we had to walk up to the bar to get our drinks because no one returned with them.  The manager also was at the bar during this interaction and failed to say anything. We mentioned our experience to the bartender and the manager could have said something, but he didn't.   Overall, the waiter seemed mad he had to work, and the only person who was doing anything positive was the busser.  We asked our busser at one point to get send over the waiter so we could order another round.  The busser walked over to the waiter, and the waiter disappeared for several minutes before coming to our table.   During this time, the waiter made eye contact with our table, and then walked away. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, but I then watched him walk inside and stand by a curtain. He wasn't doing anything for a good five minutes, and then he finally came back out, went to another table and walked away.  I had to wave him over, which I hate doing, because it is rude, however, there was no other way to get his attention.    Eventually, our food came out, and the waiter continued to be short with us.  The food was good, but the service at this place was awful. I think the thing that rubbed me the worst about this place was that the manager failed to step in and show any interest in our situation. He seemed consumed with talking to women rather than doing his job.  This was my perception last night.  I hope everyone else doesn't experience this while you are at this establishment. Maybe it was an off night, either way, the service was horrible.  The only reason we didn't leave was because our friend loves Firefly and it was her birthday.    I also witnessed several staff members on their phones, I can't believe this place...get your standards in with the rest of this city!",

Most recently, however, was the crown jewel: my brother, his best friend, his bf's wife, and I, truly enjoying ourselves. Yes I have had better sangria, but FF's version is delicious, refreshing, and compliments the food well nonetheless. I cannot live without their mussels with chorizo, bacon wrapped dates, and camarones a la diabla. Our service has always been outstanding -- a couple of visits were a tiny bit more frustrating than others because we had to flag down servers, but those incidents were few and far between -- and we always leave feeling really satisfied as far as value is concerned.  So what prompted me to write this? Man, haters gonna hate. I suppose that's the beauty of Yelp, and America in general I guess. But seriously? I find it highly ironic that there is a petition circulating to shut down all Firefly branches. ABSURDITY. I'm no math teacher or anything*, but Firefly's aggregate rating goes into the 4 star range, which for hundreds of reviews is pretty impressive. I've delved deeper into this situation and found that many have claimed that Firefly's owners refuse to adhere to any standards of cleanliness or sanitation, and Firefly's owners responded by hiring a consultant specializing in health safety. I don't know who to believe -- the strange minority stepping in because they know so damned much, or the overwhelming majority of people who are pleased with Firefly and believe it to be a True Vegas gem.  I adore you, Firefly, and so does EVERY person I send over. Don't ever go away!  * Note: I actually am a math teacher",

When you sit down they give you some garlic bread with an amazing butter spread. The butter tasted like some herb/chipotle/garlic butter. We ordered ribs which melted off the bone. Even when we tried grabbing the bone the meat was falling off. It was one of our favorite dishes. We also had chicken skewers that were just okay. They were a little chewy and the sauce could of been better. For the most part service was great and the food was good! I will for sure be back the next time I am in Vegas!",

It was clearly a piece of the metal lid of the wine bottle. (Not my bfs day!)   We told the waiter who called the manager! Wow! What a joke!!! He treated us like if we wanted the meal for free (we didn't even ask for anything). He never apologized however proceeded to tell us that the sangria is filtered 3 times. I don't care!! Hello! He was rude and defensive. We all work in hospitality and honestly wanted to laugh in his face. He asked us what type of sangri we wanted, he would replace the pitcher. (I hope!) we sAid white and he sent out red!!!!!! We told the waitress who called him over and he gave us the nastiest attitude. Wow!! Will not go back! Service went bad in that place.

    "text": "Overall a very good experience here at Firefly. Traveling solo (no co-pilot!), so grabbed a seat at the large bar. The tapas menu is expansive, with many cold, veggie, and hot options. Very solid drink options and I chose wisely with the red sangria--not too sweet w/excess sugar and fruit--it was a perfect mix, just right.   My tapas selections were spot on:  Pulpo asado (octo, potato,tomato, paprika-lemon Vinaigrette), the Chicken Tinga Empanada (fried and good), and the Mushroom Tart puff pastry (served warm--herbed cream cheese) in \"gravy\". The pulpo plate had a lovely coordinated flavor and the mush tart was a light, creamy journey to loveliness.  The tapas and sangria were vehicles to the holy-land:  the Chocolate Tres Leches Cake. Do yourself a solid and share this with a pal or two--they will love you for it   I had the honor of devouring this symphony of flavor all on my own.   Service was attentive at the bar--friendly and no nonsense. Grab some friends, some drinks, and have fun at Firefly.",

There was only three other tables there so it shouldn't have been a problem. But our server was not attentive at all. Her name was Jatziry. We heard about the sangria summer special and the carafes being 50 percent off if we mention that to her, so of course I did, and she stated that I \"had to mention summer sangria\" and that it was only for the glass and not a pitcher. It clearly said that on fireflys facebook page and I showed it to her but she paid no attention to it. Didn't get a manager, nothing. I brought it up to her again and she just ignored it. My friends and myself felt like she didn't want to lose out on a tip since it's normally 33 bucks a pitcher but damn she shouldn't judge especially since we're in the service industry as well. This makes me not want to go back to firefly because of the shitty service.",

They have big selection of dishes, and of the ten or do we tried, everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned--ranging from the warm spinach salad to the boquerones to the pulpa. One great thing is that they are fine working with even the most limited diet restrictions--our server checked on dishes and made sure everything was up to par for me. And she did it all graciously, which isn't always the case at restaurants.   The wine list was a nice treat, with a range of inexpensive Tempranillos and Malbecs, a change from the spendy wines everywhere else (if I wanted overpriced wine, I'd never leave Anchorage). They had a delicious sparkling sangria, too, which is never heard of before.   I liked the atmosphere: dark, comfy, and great Spanish art all around. The music was fun. The space was big and accommodating.   I'd love to go back when I can eat everything again. My one and only criticism is that the flavors of what we had and what we're on other menu items was a little one-note, without much expansion beyond red peppers and garlic, both of which are good, but a little variety for the palette always helps.",

The restaurant is bigger, more open and it looked like they had separate dining rooms for larger parties. It was super unfortunate what happened a few years ago with the food poisoning but don't let that change your mind about dining here. The food is still amazing but their prices did go up a few dollars per item. This trendy restaurant has always been my favorite Spanish tapas go-to. The flavors never disappoint! I love their tuna tartare and artichoke toasts but tonight I tried some new dishes. The smoked salmon bagels and scallops were a great pick! Larger than expected and a flavor explosion in my mouth! The only reason I can't give 5* is because the service is still amiss. Our server was friendly but he did forget to put in half my order. When the food runners dropped off food, they literally drop it and run away, instead of taking pride in the dish and announcing what it is. Our drinks were also always empty. I would understand if it was a Friday night with a 45 minute wait, but we came in on a Monday night around 9pm.  I watched bussers look at our empty glasses as they walked by, and servers huddled in groups on the floor.",

Only downside was when I asked the server who brought me my food for some extra bread he stated \"Only one per table\" and left. It seemed like he just didn't want to get it. He came back multiple times asking if he can take our plates when we weren't even finished yet. Not sure what happened there but we definitely didn't feel welcomed. Would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for him. Our waiter later came by and without even me asking brought out some bread since he noticed we were getting low.

They even helped out finding a glutenfree alternative for my friend.  So, happy hour here includes a lot of the good stuff on their regular menu, Did I mention the bacon wrapped dates? The squid was not that good but the fries, the meat balls (watch out they are very hot), the huge baby back ribs, salads, bread and what not.

We chose  to sit outside since it was pretty nice outside considering Vegas never has nice weather lol ((I hate the weather here.)) Outside seating area has fans and light bulbs hanging from the ceiling.   They start off with bread and almond butter. My expectations were high since all the reviews raved about it, but the bread was pretty hard and didn't taste fresh and the almond butter was a bit too sweet.   We ordered firefly fries, calamari, mac n cheese, and the ribs.  When they brought the fries out, my eyes lit up and I swear my pupils turned into hearts. The portions are so big and they put the perfect amount of Parmesan cheese (some places are so stingy with that lol), luvvvvvv fries!!!!!!!!!! You can never have too much fries. If you think otherwise, we can't be friends. Ever.  The mac n cheese was really good at first, very unique flavor. The tomatoes on top make it even more flavorful. However, halfway through I had to stop eating it because it was way too cheesy. It's either that or I was a little tipsy off my red sangria (which is yummy, btw!)   Calamari, yum! So crispy and well portioned out.  The ribs....... R.I.P to those. They were devoured in about 5 minutes.   Service: Quick and attentive.   All in all, would definitely recommend!",

Where to begin . . . The service, Naum, is the man with a plan!!!! He is the best and always on point with the most excellent service and attitude. The sparkling white peach sangria (pitcher) is a must have and we drink every drop of it, even eating the blue berries too!   Now let's start with the food, I have had 90% of the menu and everything is delish! My faves hands down is: camarones Diablo,  fire fly fries, filet mignon slider, lamb skewers, empanadas, calamari, ahi tuna, paella, Mac n cheese, and the stuffed dates! You cannot go wrong here. Nice atmosphere, music, food and people! Cheers!",

When we arrived, my group of 3 was seated immediately. We each ordered 2 plates per person of tapas. Each tapas plate was unique and served rather promptly. The filet in my opinion was the best. We each got dessert as well, and my only issue with the restaurant was that we each ordered an individual scoop of ice cream. I think the waitress tried to play matchmaker and put 2 of the scoops together in one bowl and another scoop in an individual bowl. This made everyone feel very awkward. Overall though, the atmosphere and experience was pleasant. It was pretty affordable too, it only cost $72 for all 3 of us to eat.",

The ambience/atmosphere is pretty cool, I liked it. It is a perfect place for a couple or for a small group of good friends. The service was good, fast and not too oppressive. The only negative note to it is that at the end of the meal the waiter took my husband's glass away before he had actually finished his beer!  Anyway, I'm giving 5 starts also because of the food: it was really tasty, fresh and well prepared and presented. We tried a few tapas - some of them in HH too, GREAT deal! - and the empanadas were probably the best, so give them a try. I enjoyed my red sangria as well.  The place is a drive away from Las Vegas' center, and that means it isn't crowded. Thumbs up!",

    "text": "***Firefly is a decent and not too expensive alternative to the many overpriced Las Vegas restaurants on The Strip; unfortunately, there are some mediocre tapas here to go along with their good tapas and service was poor on my visit***  The Strip is filled with overpriced restaurants that churn out mediocre food.  Whether you are going to a fine dining restaurant or a cafe charging fine dining entree prices, chances are you are going to leave the restaurant feeling like you did not get much for your money.  Off The Strip though you will find more local spots and more bang for your buck in good quality and not outrageously pricey restaurants like Lotus of Siam (some may find Lotus of Siam pricey, but it is nothing like the Vegas fine dining spots charging sometimes twice as much as what that restaurant would cost in Los Angeles or other cities).  Firefly is off The Strip and it is a local spot.  It is a longstanding tapas restaurant with a huge following and maybe even a bigger menu.  With the big menu, it is not surprising that some dishes shine while others underwhelm.  Here is the rundown:  (Anchovy toasts with avocado) I liked these toasts.  It was nice having the flavorful anchovy as well as the creaminess from the fresh avocado.  (Bacon wrapped dates stuffed with blue cheese and smoked almond, red wine reduction) The bacon was crispy and the date was sweet and I liked the blue cheese.  The crunchy almond was kind of odd and I did not like the red wine reduction--unnecessary and it kind of made the bacon wrapped dates overly sugary and soggy if you did not pluck the bacon wrapped dates out of the dish as soon as they came out.  (Camarones a la diabla, shrimp, sweet and spicy sauce, grilled bread) The shrimp was nicely cooked and plump and the sauce had a good amount of heat (a little too BBQ sauce-like though)  (Artichoke toasts, aioli, basil, pepper) The artichoke hearts were good--not as good as the anchovy toasts but still satisfying.  (Heirloom tomatoes, burrata, butter lettuce, basil, balsamic vinaigrette) The heirloom tomatoes were surprisingly juicy for not being in season and the burrata was very creamy (almost as good as the more expensive burrata at Mario Batali's B&B Ristorante in The Venetian / Palazzo).  Unfortunately, the butter lettuce was drenched in balsamic, which made this good green into nothing more than decorative garnish for the plate.  (Empanada with pork, red pepper cream cheese and aioli) I am not familiar with empanadas, but I thought these were good.  They have several other types of empanadas available.  (Padron Peppers) These flash-fried peppers had a nice light outside skin and some good heat.  They would be a nice addition to many dishes.  (Chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms) A surprising amount of heat.  (Albondigas, meatballs in a sherry and tomato sauce with parmesan) These meatballs were average stuff in a simple tomato sauce.  I would have preferred freshly grated parmesan to the melted parmesan cheese here (which felt like it had been melted a long time ago and had been sitting around for a while).  (Camarones al ajillo, shrimp, lemon and garlic butter sauce) The shrimp were fine, but I thought the lemon, butter and scampi-like sauce was just okay.  Still, it was not too heavy or oily (I think many would like it).  (Steak and mushroom skewers, filet, roasted garlic cream sauce) I thought these were average; the meat was a tad dry.  (Fried calamari) Standard calamari.  Desserts were satisfying.  The caramel flan had a good flavor and the right texture and while the ice cream did not have an incredibly creamy consistency, the portion was generous and the flavors were pretty good (chocolate, vanilla, pistachio).  The chocolate tres leches cake definitely had the expected moistness of a tres leches cake as well as a light chocolate flavor.  Prices were reasonable.  The food was decent and you do not have to pay the outrageous prices that you have to pay on The Strip.  Service was poor.  The staff was pleasant and the food came out at a quick pace, but the staff was not attentive.  After putting in our order, the staff was pretty non-existent so getting drinks and water glasses refilled and receiving the bill took way too long.  Firefly has a dark and loud atmosphere.  Firefly is a good spot if you want a decent meal in Las Vegas but do not want to pay the typical outrageous Vegas prices.  It reminds me a lot of Long Beach's Cafe Sevilla in terms of menu choices and the quality of the food (though that Long Beach restaurant has much better service).  Firefly has its own parking lot (I believe it might be valet parking though).",

This trip was special as we drove over for wife's birthday. We come to LV every month and eat here every time. It was @ 10:00 pm and we were seated next to 2 tables of 2. Our server a Ukrainian girl came over after say \"15 minutes\" and took our drink order. Never told us her name, failed to describe sangria, left to get drinks. About that time both couples on each side told us here is where the fun starts. Twenty minutes later she returned with one of the two drinks. She said I'll be right back. I said wait we want to order!  She took our order and again split. Now 40 minutes into this celebration she returns with the drink. I asked how do we get bread ?  One of the bus boys brings out \"cold hard bread\". What seamed like days, our food comes out and she drops and tried to split. I ask her if we could have warm bread. She can only give us what is ready in the kitchen. I explained we have dined here at least 35 times and have never been told that. A busboy returned with warm bread. She never came back to see if everything was ok, if we wanted to order anything else, or need another drink. We had dessert and left thinking do we ever want to return again! Walked into dark scary parking lot in back to find our six week old car smashed in the back and broken tail light. Go ahead hide us in the back so no one can see us.  Just like you will never see us again.",

From the ahi tuna skewers, to the manchego mac and cheese, to the petit filet, lamb chops, and much much more, it was all rememberable and amazing.  The most enjoyable  dishes for me were tuna tartare, the manchego mac and cheese, ahi tuna skewers, and the flan :)  Lastly, value wise, it is extremely affordable.

    "text": "Story Time - My bro and I were in Vegas for 3 days of golf. We asked the concierge at the hotel to recommend a restaurant in Vegas, not necessarily on the strip. He gave us two to pick from. Battistas <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.battistaslasvegas.com%2F&s=cae54962b520768ea02ac74538034cfc4c3d59692721b961e735840ae1e12a9a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">battistaslasvegas.com</a> - \"Italian Food\" and Firefly \"Tapas\".     We navigated to the Strip and ended up closer to Battistas.   The smell of the food was great, but there was no ambiance and having Chablis as the included wine was not working for me.  So, I pulled my brother out of there pronto and we drove to Firefly.  When we arrived at Firely, we walked in to ambiance and vibe.  Yes, this place had a buzz and I knew I had made the right decision.  No wait on a Monday night, yeah.     Our server was excellent and somehow we merged our picks from the great tapas on the menu for one of the best meals I have ever had.  From memory, the following were our choices.  Heirloom Tomato Salad  -  One of the best salad dressings (the cheese they use in combination with the balsamic dressing was out of this world good).  Risotto Stuffed Peppers - Amazingly simple, but just the kind of Tapas I love.     Ahi Tuna with Mango on skewers -  If there was a flaw in anything, the mangos were a bit unripe, but it was still really good.  Lamb Chops -  Small lamb chops.  I do not each red meat, so this was for my bro.  But, I am not religious and had a nibble, they were amazing and the sauce was great.  The garlic butter with the bread was so good, I have to mention that too.  The food was so amazing, we came back the next night after playing 36 holes of golf.   We were a solid 40 minute drive away, but the food was so good, we had to come back.  Unfortunately, we tried to broaden the orders and made a few choices that were not as good.  Gary ordered the fried calamari, but in hindsight, it is always good and it was not something that stood out with so many other amazing choices on the menu.     In any case, if you are in Vegas, you gotta visit this great spot!",

    "text": "Bacon wrapped around your dates!?......end of review. Came here with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday, the choice was perfect, elegant, clean, affordable and with a menu so intensive anyone would surely find something to their liking. I had the fried calamari, pardon peppers, the dates wrapped in bacon and the paella which was very delicious and loaded with seafood. The peppers were medium to mild but you may end up with a very spicy one, but as Forrest Gumpzalez once said \"life is a plate of peppers, you never know which one is going to burn you\". I asked the waiter if they could fry the calamari in tempura mix instead of their regular mix and they did which means that everything is made to order and not frozen ready like other places do.  I also ordered the sangria and a mojito and they both were perfectly done, a harmonious mixture of fruits and wine made this sangria one of the best I tasted.    Service was great..at the beginning and then it slowly became nonexistent, but to be fair I think we might have overstayed our welcome. I blame it on the sangria.  Tip was included on the bill as any establishment would do for parties of 8 or more but we added some more to cover lingering fees. Great times and great food will surely keep me coming for more and if you keep on making good drinks as good as your dates wrapped in bacon, you'll definitely have me wrapped around your sangria for sure.",

I had an amazing ginger pear martini that was out or this world, and my date had a mojito that was also impressive. I was disappointed that they ran out of pear puree for a second ginger pear martini, but ended up having a mojito myself.  The food here is some of my favorite in Vegas. Favorites included the plate of Serano ham and Manchego cheese, steak and mushroom skewers, and lamb chops. Also good was the veggie empanadas, grilled scallops, and the chorizo plate.   The atmosphere is good, always have pretty decent customer service, and the plates are priced well considering the quality. You will need a few plates per person so it can add up, but you definitely get what you pay for. Most people I know really like this place. I did come here in summer 2013 and it definitely improved from the first visit. I would come back again no doubt.",

It's right off the strip, but it's more popular for locals, so the vibe is laid back.  Now for the food!  The salmon toasts, veggie empanadas, and calamari were excellent! I went with my sister and a friend, and we ordered 6 savory apps and 3 desserts to split, and we had plenty of dessert left over. I absolutely recommend the mini cheesecakes and lemon berry tarts for dessert, and the goat cheese and eggplant cannelloni as a starter.   The house shandy is an excellent choice of drink; they mix up the traditional beer-and-lemonade cocktail by taking a light Belgian beer, mixing with fresh strawberry bitters, and adding a bit of Amaretto to top it off. So refreshing and so delicious!  We always hit up Firefly before a night on the strip; it's a tradition now to make it our first stop to kick off our annual Vegas weekend.",

    "text": "Id give a 1 star if the food wasnt so delicious here. thats why im giving two.  The service was horrible. came here for a going away party last week and we were sat in the middle of the room at a long table. My boyfriend and I were a little late so we asked the hostess if she sat any big parties, who ever she was texting on her phone was obviously waaay more important then we were so we found our party ourselves. once at the table it took us 15 minutes to be able to order drinks. I ordered my usual scotch and soda, never being asked what scotch i wanted, but i assumed they would just give me their well scotch. was i wrong about that... but we will go over that once i tell you about our bill.  our drinks finally arrive about 10 minutes later, i ordered water as well so i reminded the server when he dropped off our drinks. Our water never came, even after reminding him a 3rd time.  The food was amazing, as usual. We had the heirloom salad, padron peppers, artichoke toasts, ceviche, ahi poke, and we split the spicy shrimp. (i obviously took a break from veganism for a night) The heirloom salad is freaking amazing, ive never had such a great salad.   Once getting our bill, we noticed i was charged for Macallan 12. For all my scotch drinkers that are reading this, it is a crime to mix Macallan 12 with soda.. If you cant just drink it straight, just admit to yourself that you are by no means a scotch enthusiast.  And with a price of $14 (i think?) a drink, we werent too thrilled. On top of everything the tip was already included, and we werent told this. So for horrible service we ended up tipping double.   On our way out the same hostess was still on her phone texting away. If we didnt live in Veer Towers and were so close to this location we would never return. You would figure with all the bad press this restaurant has endured they would step up their customer service.",

I saw her eyes pop out of her head, but she calmed down once I reassured her that this venue came back with a clean bill of health. And let's be completely honest - after a complete PR meltdown with a grip of guests falling sick, the place can't afford another screw up, so it's probably more paranoid about sanitation than a mom in a daycare center.   We came just in the nick of time for happy hour and grabbed a couple of glasses of sangria before ordering usual staples like stuffed dates, shrimp ceviche, and steamed mussels. All a big win in our book, plus the service was fast but not at all rushed. Firefly is a great place to grab a drink and a few small bites, or to order a lot of dishes and sample everything. You know, European dim sum!   Parking is a bigger fiasco than it was at their original location in that it is now a small lot in the back, so consider yourself warned!",

    "text": "Firefly is a large old fashioned restaurant.  It's dark inside with candles on every table and the seating is crowded.  The restaurant is very apropos of Las Vegas because once you're inside you can't tell if it's day or night, like the casinos.  They serve tapas (small plates), cocktails and some dinner entrees.  I came around 3 pm for a late lunch and to take advantage of their happy hour menu.  The happy hour menu is priced at $4 or $5 for each small plate and seemed to include most of their popular dishes.  I ordered firefly fries, bacon wrapped dates, meatballs, chicken on a stick and red wine sangria and water to drink.    I was served bread and flavored butter to start but the bread was so dry, dense and stale I couldn't eat it.  I was surprised when my food arrived because the bowl of fries was the antithesis of small plates, the portion was huge (they were also some of the best fries I've ever eaten) and the dates, meatballs and chicken were much smaller than traditional tapas more in the line of tiny amuse-bouche.  The dates were in a delicious red wine sauce and the cream sauce on the chicken was so good I was thinking of ordering another plate.  The meatballs and sangria were average but still good.  The food, with the exception of the bread, was all very good and $4 or $5 per plate was a fair price for quality and portion.  However with regular menu prices of $8 or $9 per plate and the suggestion that each person order 2 or 3 plates to share, your appetizers and drinks get pretty expensive.  And if you think a few plates are enough for dinner I think most people would leave hungry.  The restaurant is a little too dark, dingy and old fashioned for me and the service was just OK but I thought the food was great...the menu prices on the other hand I thought were very high for the quality, portion size and ambiance of the restaurant.",

The hostess was underwhelming when we bothered her and she had to lift her head to greet us. We were taken to our table and had great service from our server, the expeditor and the bus people from that point on. Ordered our drinks (I, a wine and my husband tried the fruit infused vodka martini.). Mine was fine and his came out in what looked to be a sampler size martini glass. It looked half empty and we both took a sip of what tasted like a watered down fruit drink. It had absolutely NO flavor. Sent it back and got an IPA that was fine. Ordered everything I always get with my favorite being the Apple/Manchego Salad which was delicious, as it always has been. Bread and butter was good, but missed the olives. Guess that went with the move. Shrimp aLa Diabla was just ok. Not the same zip it always had and the shrimp was a bit over cooked. My go to has always been the lamb chops and YIKES, what a disaster they were! We each tried cutting it and left the whole plate. The idea that we would have sent 2 things back in one visit was too much! We overheard our poor server having to take care of someone at the next table that was complaining and just asked for our check. She looked at the full plate of lamb chops and never said a word. We paid the bill, tipped 20% and asked the server to take the chops back to the chef/cook and have them try to cut into it. She apologized, thanked us and never came back. She acted as though it were an every day occurrence. We won't be back and we were frequent visitors when we are in town.",

Their cocktails are spot-on and available by the pitcher. Their sangria is good without being overly sweet, and their passion fruit mojitos gave us a nice afternoon brunch buzz.  There is a huge selection of tapas and plenty of vegetarian choices which makes it easy for me to dine with a group. The only one I haven't liked is the tortilla espanola. All the others have been quite tasty, especially the empanadas. I would definitely make a repeat visit.",

One being gluten free and the other Vegan. Once we ordered our food our server came back and told us that our food will be right out BUT because 1 individual was gluten free everyone's food was made gluten free....wtf???? I don't think I've ever eaten at a restaurant  that forces you to be gluten free because of 1 persons order! Her response was that they take allergies serious and there's also a option to sign a waiver to eat there......wtf??? I have nothing to say about this. Get it together fireflys!! Youve already been  closed down once by the health department. ..... I'm not done ... 3 items on our bill was doubled! Bacon wrapped dates came out burnt , had to get up out of my seat and find our server for bread and butter...needless to say, sounds like the kitchen was ready to close. Stop being lazy! This is food we're taking about .theres  no shortcuts!",

    "text": "Food is not bad....Food is actually good. However my \"EXPERIENCE\" as a whole was NOT a good one!   First thing we were asked after sitting was \"Do you have any food allergies? \" I understand the question because I do have some, however it should not be the very 1st thing you ask your clients when they sit down.  Now I know my food allergies and reactions the best.... not these waiters. I felt like they forced us to get certain things set aside or given to us on the side instead of how it should be plated. There are things I am allergic to but only in its raw state....like fresh cherries for example. However, sweetened cherries or a cherry vinaigrette I am totally ok with. Why did our waiter see me take a bite of salad that had Cherry vinaigrette and ran to tell me not to eat that?  Oooh and then a girl who works there comes out with a waiver in her hand that I had to sign that basically states I had eaten something that I knew contained something I was allergic to. And this was smack in the middle of my meal. It was so not a pleasant experience and even though the food was good. I don't think I'll ever return.  So apparently this place was most recently ( on 5/24/18...and its public record) in trouble with the food commission for not swapping out a pair of gloves and/or washing their hands before dealing with a client who had food allergies. This does not mean you have to treat your clients in a way that makes them uncomfortable.  You need to learn a better way to deal with these situations.   And now I wonder....if the proper thing was for them to have given me a copy of the waiver they made me sign. Shouldn't I have a copy of any paperwork they can and plan on using if there were any legal action necessary?   Now our waiter was great. No downfall to him. Not his fault. And he brought me the best Cucumber Jalapeno Martini but I won't go back.",

    "text": "The first time I visited Firefly was in 2013 for a wedding reception and I had the best time munching on the bacon wrapped dates and downing mojitos.  So when I was planning my high school's 20th reunion, I immediately thought of Firefly, a hip, super fun place to have a great dinner and hang out with friends.  From the initial email I sent Regina with Banquets to payment at the event, the whole deal went without a glitch.  Communication with Regina was a breeze and she answered all of my emails quickly.  Our group was small (under 50) and from out of town so naturally many of them were skeptical with the salmonella incidence and health inspection violations and closures at their other locations.  But I kept close communication with Regina and paid attention to the REPUTABLE recent reviews of Firefly on Yelp.    The affordable all you can eat banquet menu included their starter, a choice of 6 tapas, and \"chocolate\" tres leches cake for only $30 per person.  Out of their extensive selection, I chose the most popular based on yelp reviews:  artichoke toasts, stuffed dates, baby back ribs, patatas bravas, steak skewers, and camarones a la diable.  We decided on a cash bar that they set up in our private room and we added on unlimited soft drinks for $2.50 per person.  The room charge was $200 with a minimum $1000 food and beverage.    Our room was set up with one row of tables which initially seemed a little crowded, but turned out fine.  Our crowd mingled for about 20 minutes before I asked when the food would be served and they told me as soon as we were seated.  We sat down and like magic, the food was ushered in by the trays.  As expected the dates were a favorite, but people seemed to love the artichoke toasts, ribs and shrimp as well.    They are located minutes from the strip and parking in their lot was plentiful.  Our group had a great time and having it at Firefly was awesome.  Highly recommend Firefly for your banquet.  Excellent service from start to finish.",

Prices and quality are always great. Our go to's are always;  Ceviche ; super limey just how I like it. Big chunks of avocado and shrimp. Just delicious.  Shrimp A La Diabla; sweet and spicy and just the best. The sauce is thick but not overwhelming. We usually get two of these dishes as my husband and I don't want to share!   Tierra y Mar: Yum yum! Chorizo, shrimp and filet mignon skewer with a salsa verde drizzled on top. Another must have a must order 2!   Bacon wrapped dates: I don't need to say anymore. Get them.   We had our toddler with us this time so we explored beyond our usual 4.   Mac & Cheese: This was a large portion and just so so good. I know you can't really get too crazy with Mac & Cheese but it just tasted different, ans super cheesy. Our toddler loved it.  Albondigas: He really enjoyed these too! The spices where perfect and not too overwhelming for a toddler.   See you next time Firefly!",

Service went down hill here, even from the hostess up front having an attitude about sitting me and my wife down.

The beet and roasted pear salad was perfect for a very warm day. Vegas is so crazy on the Strip, this location on Paradise Road is a welcome respite. The Tiera y Mar tapas was excellent - shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo with a salsa verde - great flavor and fun to eat, although it would be nice to offer to take them off the skewer to avoid a meat projectile. Complimentary side of toasted garlic baguette with almond butter was a great filler between course. Server Mario and staff were very friendly and efficient.  I'm guessing this place is quite busy and hectic at night, but daytime is the best choice.  Great outdoor patio for al fresco dining. I'd return on my next Vegas trip for sure.",

    "text": "After hearing about Firefly on Paradise for years, I was happy with my first visit and can't wait to return. As the other reviews have stated, this is an excellent spot for group outings as well as intimate dates. While my wife and I enjoyed our meal, I'd suggest going with a group so everybody has a chance to try a wide variety of tapas.  My wife and I decided on an early dinner on a Sunday night and booked our reservation through Open Table on Yelp, which was easy and convenient. We arrived and were seated immediately. It was still early for Vegas, so the restaurant was not fully buzzing yet.   Our server Nahum greeted us and he was terrific throughout the dinner, as were the additional servers who promptly removed empty plates and refilled our drinks. Nahum explained some of Firefly's dishes and offered a few recommendations. We went with a few of the more popular items and since we'd had our share of meat during lunch that day, we went with dishes that were not meat-centric.  The tapas we tried:  The stuffed dates were outstanding and lived up to the hype. I was a bit weary at first, thinking that the bacon wrapping would overwhelm the date, but it was used more for its smoky qualities and the almond center was a nice way tie in all of the flavors. Highly recommended.  The fresh garbanzos were a nice snack seasoned with lime, chili, and sea salt. It was the first time I'd had them served in their shell; it was similar to munching on edamame, but with more flavor.   The Firefly Fries were shoestring potatoes topped with parmesan and herbs and served with aioli. I didn't think they were anything extraordinary, but my wife really enjoyed the comfort food quality they brought to our meal.   We both enjoyed the manchego mac and cheese, which was made with baby shell pasta instead of elbow macaroni and topped with a tomato-pepper relish. It was rich, creamy, and mellow.  The camarones a la diabla were more sweet than spicy, with the shrimp cooked perfectly and served in the sauce along with small pieces of grilled bread.  Surprisingly, the tapas filled us up more than we thought they would, so we intend to return to sample the other dishes as well as their popular sangria. We did, however, leave room for dessert and devoured the chocolate tres leches cake. It was a perfect ending to our dinner.  Note: it's unfortunate there's no sort of dress code at Firefly. It's a nice restaurant, but when diners show up looking like they just returned from their hotel's swimming pool, it ruins the atmosphere. I'm reserving my fifth star for a future visit.",

Delicious! The menu is primarily made up of small plates, or tapas. There is a large variety of selections, from salads, to chicken and steak, to seafood. Most are prices from $6 to 11 each. We have been there numerous times, so we've had many of their offerings, which are consistently excellent.  In our most recent trip, we were served by Alejandro and his assistant, Roberto. Both were personable and attentive. They made great recommendations, which helped us, even though we have been several times before.  We started with the plate of serrano ham and manchego cheese. Served with bread and sun dried tomatoes, it was a great start.  We followed this up with the pardon peppers and pork empanadas. Both were great. The pork empanadas were cooked perfectly and tasted terrific.  We followed these with an order of the Tierra y Mar skewers (skewers of shrimp, beef and chorizo) and another order or sangria! When we asked Roberto about his favorite dish, he suggested an order of the camarones a la diabla, so we ordered that, too. Both dishes were outstanding!  Without saying much, the second pitcher of sangria was better than the first.  All in all, another outstanding experience at Firefly. If you go to Las Vegas, this off the strip gem is not to be missed!",

So, I made a u-turn and my wife and I ate dinner her instead. We had the following:  Smoked salmon bagels $9  Patatas Bravas $7  Fried Calamari $10  Ahi Tuna Skewer $10  Chicken Tinga Empanada $7  Vanilla Yogurt Mousse $7  First of all, we were told that this is a spanish style resto with emphasis on tapas. All of the food tasted pretty good. The bagels were great mostly bc the bagels were toasted perfectly and that caper dill cream was pretty tasty. The patatas bravas was pretty much an elegant version of roasted potatoes. I wish the friend calamari came with a acidic sauce like a tomato-based sauce bc eating it with tartar sauce can get pretty heavy. The Ahi Tuna Skewer was the best tasting dish for me. The ginger soy glaze on it actually reminded me more of Hawaii than Spain.  The Empanada was pretty good...light and fluffy and not greasy at all. Im glad it came with a side salad. The vanilla yogurt mousse was ok. It was like not as heavy melted ice cream mixed with fruit. The crispy sugar cookie sticks that came with it were probably one of the best cookies i've ever tasted and made a good dipping partner for the mousse. Overall, I would say this place is pretty good. I'll be back to try their paellas and update this review....",

    "text": "My girlfriend had been dying to try Firefly for quite some time and kindly decided to take me for a belated birthday dinner. We were able to make reservations through open table via the yelp app (very cool and super easy)! Based upon reviews of Helpers and friends Firefly was surely a place that would please our curious appetites. The service we received was attentive and extremely helpful. Our server had us stop ordering after we selected 6 items suggesting that it may be too much food for 2 people. I had a craving for a cocktail and order the Cherry Mule. It was such a creative take on the Moscow Mule with the twist of adding the St. Germaine's lovely flavor. Thebread and butter was absolutely a great pairing. The butter was sweet and the bread was slightly salty. Our server recommended the figs which we loved! They were stuffed with candied walnuts and sprinkled with cheese as well as a great lightly drizzled sauce. Next were the tuna tartar & ceviche. The tuna tartar was accompanied by fried taro chips and not only did it look good it was also very filling. If I had to pick a favorite of the Tuna Tartar and the Ceviche, then it'd be the ceviche hands down. It was so flavorful and refreshing! The next item was the spicy beef salad and item did not disappoint with its slight kick and yummy dressing! We decided to try out the Diablo shrimp and octopus. Of the 2 dishes I'd recommend the shrimp over the octopus since octopus seemed to have too much going on. We decided to add another dish for good measure. I must confess that Chicken AND Chorizo was my absolute favorite dish!!!! What an amaze combo of tastiness!  To end our meal we ordered the gelato trio and chocolate trees leches cake. The chocolate tres leches cake was ok. I've had better versions in Santa Ana and at other establishments, but the Gelato Trio was spot on!",

The flavor is good, but the texture is not what you would expect with paella. Maybe they are just rushed the day I had it.   Prices are very reasonable.",

And the sangria will not disappoint.   Five stars tapas are as follows: stuffed dates (ON POINT - I mean seriously on POINT! ), merguez (couldn't ask for better lamb sausage - savory with right amount of spice), empanada (NOT the the chicken tinga), chicken and chorizo stuffed mushroom,  juevos estrellados (it has really good spice but only order to get full...carbs will help fill you up)    They have outdoor misters if you want to be outdoors. Noise level is fine. Not too rowdy at all but I went on a sunday evening around 8 pm so you be the judge.   Plenty of parking but can easily get here by taxi from the strip for under ten bucks (like 8 bucks) - note that we came from Wynn.   One of the better tapas places I've been to. Really really good food. :)",

This of course scared me and I told her I did not want to have lunch here anymore, but she assured me that the new location was fine and that they had really good food. So I gambled with my health and we decided to come anyway. Sure enough the food was delish!  Stepping into firefly I noticed the environment was nice and clean. The walls were painted with warm, dark tones. The overall atmosphere was pleasing. You even had the option to sit outside, but with the sun beaming out we decided to enjoy our meal inside where it was cool.   We stuck with the groupon and ordered multiple tapas and not one of them was a disappointment. My favorite tapas would have to be the mushroom and steak skewers and the smoked salmon toast. The steak skewers were tender, juicy, and flavorful. And the smoked salmon toast..yuuum! Their dishes were served with abundant flavors. And before I forget to mention, their firefly fries are really good; the dipping sauce served with it really compliments the fries.   The servers were also nice. I never had to ask for a refill because my cup would already be filled. I would definitely come back to try their other tapas or entres.",

I understand its Vegas and when servers are charging gratuity for big parties at some point they dont care because they probably won't see us again. Its sad but True. I will recommend this place to friends when they want amazing food but will always warn about the service.  Salsa, Merengue, cumbia, Bachata dance floor outside.",

Our waiter took the time to answer our questions about the unfamiliar dishes on the menu and he gave adequate suggestions based on our tastes and food familiarity. We ordered all Tapas for meal. 6 different types, a couple that were house specialties. The white anchovies and stuffed dates. They were superb. A pitcher of White Sangria was tasty and accompanied all of our Tapas selections which included lamb, beef, veggies, seafood and chicken. Everything prepared had excellent eye appeal and flavor and each portion was comparable to the price. We shared each Tapa dish evenly. The warm bread kept coming. Because it was our wedding anniversary a wonderful flan was comped by our superb waiter. We came home to L.A bragging to our friends and family about our new food spot in Las Vegas. We will surely return there.",

Such a special place off the Strip. Carlos, the owner came to our table, introduced himself and even sent us an exquisite dessert platter. I was in Heaven. Thank you Carlos and to your whole team at Firefly. I will be coming back and bringing more guests!!!",

On our last day, we were getting ready to drive home and had to go to the outskirts to fill up on gas, when we passed by this restaurant!  We were both hungry and saw that it offered small plates, tapas, which was just our style so we decided to go for it!  I can't remember what we ate, but it was SO yummy!!!  I am so happy that we happened upon this cute little place, and the next time we're in Vegas we're definitely going back!!",

I am sad that I have moved so it is out of my way so I can't make my weekly happy hour trips, but I have been able to visit a few times and I have had great experiences. The food and drinks were just as good as the old location as was the service. I love that the new location is much bigger and more modern, although I do miss the dark romantic ambiance the old location had, but the bigger the restaurant is that means the less of a wait so I'm happy about that! Also, valet is a HUGE plus as the last location's parking situation was horrible. Some of my favorites I order every time I have been here and never disappoint are the stuffed peppers, pulpo asado and camarones al ajillo (garlic shrimp, I may have totally spelled that wrong but at least I tried LOL). Definitely recommend this place to everyone!",

We also ordered the seafood ipella.  That was ok it had the flavor.  I suggest to come here with friends and have fun not a one on one on Friday nights. With friends you can make as much noise as you want and drink.  Like a local bar almost.   I give it a 3 out of 5 because of the service. I think it was great they were always on top of everything.",

The food here is always top notch and I must repeat: the Sangria is so delicious- easily the best Sangria in Vegas, and it's definitely in the top 3 best sangrias I have ever had (and I've had A LOT of Sangria!)

Didn't care for this  - apple salad was the only edible thing but BEWARE a lot of their meals have almonds in it .

I love tapas and was first introduced to paella and tapas on a Barcelona trip 2 years ago. Before then I never really knew what tapas were lol. My favorite things to get are either the shrimp ceviche, paella, tuna tartare, pulpo asado, steamed mussels, scallops, empanadas, or camarones al ajillo. The seafood here is super delicious and the sangria excellent!  The paella takes awhile to make so if you're gonna order that, put your order in with your appetizers. Weekends are really busy here so make sure to make a reservation or there's first come first serve seating at the bar.",

    "text": "Shout out to L.C. for another great suggestion for some savory tapas!  We met up on a Friday night for my first go at Firefly.  Luckily we were seated in a nice comfy booth because the place filled up really fast.  After eating here I knew why.  When dining with my Yelp friend I knew I would be trying a lot of food and stuffed to the gills.    Upon putting our food order in, the food just seemed to roll out of the kitchen quickly and efficiently.   We started with the Chopped Chicken Salad.  It certainly wasn't the type of salad I was expecting but it was enjoyable.  The salad scoop was surrounded by endive leaves which made for a lovely presentation.  Plus it made a nice chicken salad 'boat' for consumption.    Next I tried the Stuffed Dates.  Holy Buckets. It was my first time having dates with dreams of having this hot tapas again.  The bacon wrapped date with smoked almost and blue cheese was divine.  Since we were all sharing I couldn't eat the whole dish as much as I would've liked to.  To appease the men at the table, Chicago Beef Bocadillos were before us.  The shaved beef sandwiches were topped with house made giardiniera.  The beef was tender and full of flavor.  The giardiniera just made the sandwich better and earned a thumbs up.  The pork stuff Empanada was also a good choice.  I wish there were more on the plate for sharing like some of the other tapas but we all still had a little taste of hot pastry.    Of course we can't skip dessert when they offer a Dessert Platter.  Flan, chocolate tres leches, cheesecake and a berry tart make up this delicious sampling of treats.  The chocolate tres leches stood out as the star on this platter.  The cake was soaked in goodness that you just shouldn't pass up.    Service was ok as our waiter seemed to disappear for lengths of time.  I was guessing because it was a busy Friday evening so I might try another day of the week for my return visit. I left full with a smile.  See you next time!",

I ordered the empanadas (delicious), fries (big basket!), Mac and cheese, croquetas and chocolate tres leches cake. All the food that we ordered was great. The only one I did not love was the Mac and cheese. It tasted fine but not something I would order again. My personal favorite was the empanadas. The dessert was also very tasty and could be shared with 2 people.   Like I mentioned, the sangria here is really good. We ordered pitchers for the table.

It was tasty. I ordered Chorizo clams - the clams were very fresh.  Camarones Al La Diabla - the lemon garlic sauce was flavorful and the shrimp was plump.  The place is great for big groups. It was very loud and packed with big parties celebrating birthdays. Not a place for quiet conversations.  My friends enjoyed their food. If you let them know it's your birthday, they give you a complimentary flan.  The service was top notch. We sat there talking for a while and they didn't rush us.",

Recommendations- the octopus was delicious, the steak and mushroom skewers were great and the dates super yummy! The tuna tartare was a good size and good quality but I would pass that up if you are trying to decide.",

Such a steal. I also had the hot spinach salad it was fresh and everything went together perfectly. Lastly, I had the tierra y mar skewers. So much goody on such a small stick. There are so many options that have mbut attention I look forward to revisiting this place. I also tried their berry infused vodka. I dont typically like sweet drinks, but this was smoothe and almost tasted like straight grape juice. Bartenders were nice and attentive.",

One of us had all of our plates and the other person had none. I ordered a glass of wine that never came so I asked the waiter and he ran and got it.  We were enjoying our meal and I patiently waited for my empanadas when I realized I better ask in there whereabouts. Once again the waiter ran to get them.  Once I received them I was a bit disappointed because the were burned around the edges, which left about two bites of empanada because they are small.  Lastly the oil used to cook the fish sticks was past its prime because the fish stick color was an ugly darkish brown. No good. For the foot version the service could have been better. The food is very good but attention to detail would help.",

    "text": "After our wedding at the Flamingo, we came here for our reception. The food is spectacular as well as the service.   Fernanda and Regina took such great care of us before and during the reception, making sure everyone was taken care of.  Paul and Neo, our servers and bar tenders of the night, also deserve high praise for their efficiency and attentiveness.    We began outside on the patio for light tapas.  Albondigas, the stuffed dates and artichoke toast kicked off the night.  Multiple trays of each were passed around to the guests, enough where I could have filled up on those had I not known what else was to come.  Although I loved all three of these starters, the albondigas were my favorite.  They were tender and juicy and full of flavor due to the Parmesan and sherry sauce.  The guests raved about the stuffed dates which had a perfect balance of sweet with the red wine reduction sauce and savory with the blue cheese.  The smoked almonds added not only another element of surprise to the mixture of flavors, but a nice juxtaposition of texture to the dates.  My mom and aunt's favorites were the artichoke toast- a perfect amount of salty crunchiness from the bread with a generous piece of warm artichoke on top,  Honestly, as I am writing this review recalling the food, maybe all three were my favorite!  To accompany the starters and the meal, we had an open bar. Being on the patio we had a separate opening to the inside bar that only our guests could order from.  No waiting at all.  I enjoyed the sangria, pretty much all night.  Both the red and the champagne sangrias were filled with fresh fruit and both had  unique flavors.  The champagne sangria was a little sweeter, perfect for dessert, while the red accompanied most of my food.  Regina brought out pitchers for all the guests to enjoy on top of whatever else they wanted to drink. Fernanda, Regina, Paul and Neo did not skip one beat!  Now on to the meal...We were moved to a private room inside.  The only downfall was that there was only a black velvet curtain separating us from another party and at times they got a little loud ( as did we I am sure).  But other than that, Firefly set up a private drink station for us to continue to order drinks from.  We began the meal with Toasted Bread, Almond Butter, and Marinated Olives.  That almond butter was so sweet; being married to the saltiness of the olives made this, again, another tantalizing combination.  Next was the paella. I have never had paella before, but now I am a paella believer!  It was filled with seafood and pork - just a whole lot of stuff! Many guests filled their plates with whichever meats they liked best. We also enjoyed the ribeye and the herb roasted chicken.  The ribeye was nicely cooked, especially in the inside if you like your meat more medium.  It was more cooked on the outside.  The sauce was reminiscent of the red wine reduction form the stuffed dates.  The herb roasted chicken was tender and we were served both white and dark meat.  As a side, we had the firefly fries, and damn that aioli was addictive.  A few guests admitted to eating multiple plate fulls of the fries the next day.  To end our evening of food, we got to savor the Chocolate \"Tres Leches\" Cake.  Moist and delightful, it was a perfect end to the perfect meal.  We also ordered a wedding cake from Freeds which was delivered to Firefly.  It was one of the most flavorful and delicious cakes I have every had - I recommend the almond flavored cake.   The night was coming to a close, and we all had such an amazing time.  We were supposed to be out by 8, but our speeches went a little longer and people lingered a little longer.  The staff did not rush us out nor did we feel pressured to get out.  This wedding experience was pretty close to perfect, a word I don't use too lightly but used repeatedly in this review.  The only thing I wish is that there was a Firefly in the CLE.  Much thanks to Firefly: Fenanda, Regina, Paul and Neo!",

    "text": "Firefly is perfect for groups, but definitely make reservations!  Firefly's ambiance is high-energy and a bit romantic, as evidenced by the dim lights and curtains dividing areas.  We made reservations for 8 people at 6:45 and were seated right away in a booth that comfortably fit all 8 of us.  It was especially nice because we were seated in a little nook that gave us privacy, and more importantly, a quieter area so that we could actually hear each other.  Disclaimer: I am not a sangria connoisseur, so my taste is not very discriminating.  I ABSOLUTELY LOVED the sparkling wine sangria; I regret not getting a pitcher.  It went down just like juice.  It is on the sweeter side, so beware if you like a more mild sangria.  As for the tapas, I had the tuna tartare and the petite filet.  The tuna tartare was pretty bland and rather oily, however, I was impressed with how fresh the fish was!  This was the first time I had tuna tartare, so maybe that was how it was supposed to taste, but I would not get it again.  However, I loved the pairing with taro chips (disclaimer: I may be a little partial because I am from Hawaii) because it was a little different and made up for the oiliness of the marinade.  The petite filet was DELICIOUS!  It was cooked perfectly, moist, and soft.  I absolutely loved the red wine sauce, as well as the fact that it came with mushrooms!  It is a must have!  My friend had the firefly fries, which I heard good things about.  However, I thought it was also rather bland and oily, and did not eat too many of them.    All in all, I would definitely return for the sangria and because of all of the enticing tapa options!  There are so many other tapas I would love to return to try.  Additionally, I didn't save any room for dessert and the banana-nutella sandwiches are calling my name!  Firefly is perfect for groups of friends to catch up!",

    "text": "Firefly, this hurts me more than it hurts you.  Trust me on this.  I live in Southern California, so Vegas is like our back yard playground.  For the past few years, I have raved about Firefly; this semi, off-the-strip restaurant that didn't have a celebrity chef's named attached to it that still offered innovative and delicious food.  I would recommend this place to all of my friends and I initially gave them a 5 star review.  But a lot has happened since the first time I fell in love with Firefly.    (1) The were shut down for Salmonella poisoning (2) They closed down their first location (3) Moved to a larger, new location (4) Food quality went down the toilet  I took my husband to Firefly and all day, I had hyped up this amazing restaurant ... the \"best tapas\" I told him. Oh man, the disappointment was equivalent to that of a kid finding coal under the tree on Christmas morning.  The food was salty and mediocre. There were some dishes that we didn't want to finish -- and these are tapas, small plates.    Also, service was sub par.  They appeared to be slammed with guests or under-staffed.  It was difficult to catch the attention of any server and had different people serving us each time. Who was our waiter again?  Honestly, like I said before, I mean it when I say that it hurts me to write this review.  I would love to have Firefly back to the way that it used to be.  Somewhere, after the Salmonella poisoning and the move to their new location, they seemed to have lost their good taste and service.    There are so many other places to eat in Vegas-- don't waste your time here.",

    "text": "When the most recent health inspection debacle revealed the same offenses (food handling, contamination, hand washing) as inspections in the past, it sent a message. It was a blatant disregard for the public's health and safety. It stung more because I was very adamant about forgiveness and continued to patronize their restaurants after the salmonella incident. I've never had a food poisoning issue, but now it felt like a gamble to dine with them. I've made a choice to not support a business that has repeated offenses of this nature (regardless of what they claim is not their fault) based on principle.  My recent visit was prompted by the celebration of a good friend's graduation. We joined her and her family on their vacation to Las Vegas (I had forewarned them about the events). In any case, our dining experience was mostly pleasant and I was admitedly excited to eat some of my favorite dishes again.   The hostess was kind enough to accomodate our large group in one of their semi-private dining booths/tables with drapes (although these proved difficult for the servers and bussers since they had to constantly move them to reach the table). Everyone was really friendly, but service was just okay. Several times we were searching for our server or anyone to come to our aid or just replenish water.  The food was still as delicious as I remember. My favorites being the Stuffed Dates, Firefly Fries, Paella (mixed), and Pork Empanada. The only disappointment was the Tuna Tartare, which was also an old favorite. But overall, I enjoyed my meal. Also, I really liked the Chocolate Tres Leches Cake.  So, the food is still good and service is okay. Doesn't change how I feel about the business and their owners. Dine at your own risk.",

The one star review is about several members of the staff.   I was there on my birthday, dressed up in a pretty dress and my guy friend was wearing a nicely pressed button down shirt. I'm pointing this out because the staff treated us like we were filthy street people. The staff was literally fawning over every table around where my friend and I were sitting -- yet they were beyond rude to us. At least four times they tried to take plates away long before we were finished, brought the check before we asked for it and while we were still eating, then trying to take the plates away again while there was still food on them! Two nearby tables had the opposite experience. The waitstaff was attentive, smiling, and even engaged in polite little chats. I thought maybe they were the owners or friends of owners... until I realized the waitstaff was being that way with almost every single other table! They were being NICE to them!  Here is the sad fact: My friend and I are not Latino, sorry but there is no other way to say it. We are white people and there were only a handful in the entire restaurant. VERY DISAPPOINTING to be treated that way because of our skin color. As delicious as the food was, I will never go back to Firefly.   It was when we were leaving that I realized what was going on. Here is why: someone had accidentally left a car key near the front door. So I walked it over to the bartender who wasn't even taking an order or making a drink -- he looked at me with a quick little nasty expression, then ignored me. All I was trying to do was return someone's lost key. I had NO other interactions in the bar area while at Firefly, so there was zero reason why the bartender would give me a dirty look.",

The paella was quite delicious; good flavor and a lot of food. The tapas were just okay, nothing to rave about. Prices were fair (paella was $26 for 2-4 people, which isn't bad at all), though tapas were on the pricier side. I would give this place 3.5 stars for the food, will bump up for good service.",

I also had the petit fillet, which melted in my mouth. I was bummed that I didn't have more people with me so that we could try more food....but those two small plates filled me up!

We had the seafood and it was good, lots of seafood. The dates bacon wrap was a tad bit salty. The potatoes with chorizo was super salty, you truly need a bowl of rice to scarf that down. The shrimp glazed with sweet and sour sauce was typical , nothing interesting. Felt like I can buy a sweet and sour sauce bottle at the Asian store and just stir fry it with the shrimp.   I truly enjoyed the scallop escargot , pesto and bitter were so yummy!!! Must order !! I also enjoyed the apple salad with manchego cheese and smokes almond, very light and refreshing!",

In fact, my husband and I were at the restaurant by 6:45pm. We were then told that we had to wait until closer to 7 to be seated. Understandable. Until I noticed about two to three parties without reservations being seated before us. What's the point of making a reservation???

Huge selection of delectable tapas. The croquettes were delicious and everyone's favorite. The stuffed dates were little flavor bombs. The clams with chorizo were amazing. We asked for more bread THREE TIMES to sop up the sauce and never got it. Eggplant around goat cheese was delish. Chicken tinca empanadas were good. Our least favorites were the stuffed piquillo peppers and chorizo stuffed mushrooms (which needed a sauce).

    "text": "It seems to be that everywhere you go, tapas is the hot new topic. Small plates are awesome. You can have as many plates as you want, and variety makes us all happy. You don't have to order 1 dish and be stuck with it. If you order one wrong dish, you at least have 3 other ones that are good. Tapas is shareable, and at one sitting, you can easily have tried 10 different dishes. For those saving money or not too hungry, its a good way to save money and just get snacking items. It doesn't seem like tapas is going away anytime soon. Firefly in Las Vegas, not too far from the strip. They have some of the best tapas in Vegas, and the atmosphere is very relaxing. Stumbling upon this spot, I could only wishttp://www.dinedelish.com/wp-admin/edit.phph it were on the strip, inside the comforts of a resort.  Their stuffed dates were on point. Wrapped in bacon, the salty and the sweet was working perfectly together. Also stuffed with smoked almonds, it gave it a nice nutty flavor as well as a good crunch. A sprinkle of blue cheese made everything round out nicely. When you are talking about tapas, stuffed dates is automatically in the conversation. The ones at Firefly were nothing short or spectacular. The red wine reduction was a nice touch to the stuffed dates. This is a must order when you are at Firefly.  The filet minon sliders were surprisingly tasty. Topped with blue cheese and fried onion straws, the sliders were rich. The fried onions gave it a good crunch, and the cheese is what gave it a nice flavor. If the cheese didn't do it in the flavor department, their south western style sauce topped it all off. With filet minon being the patty, you know it was going to be soft and juicy. The patty had a nice crust on the outside, and the inside was juicy and not dry at all. This was a perfect little slider combination.  My favorite was the tierra y mar skewers. Skewers with grilled shrimp, filet minon, and chorizo sausage was a perfect trifecta of flavors and textures. Drizzled with a nice salsa verde on top, each bite was perfectly different on its own. The filet minon was uber tender and though it didn't have a lot of fat, it contained so much flavor. The shrimp was grilled to a nice crisp and was a match made in heaven when eaten with the chorizo. Everything seemed to work together in this -- as if the shrimp had the beef's back, and the chorizo had the shrimp's back. Obviously, pork chorizo sausage can hold its own. This is a must order. Maybe a double up would help so that you can have your own plate.  Firefly was awesome. Despite not being on the strip, it isn't that bad. Basically a block behind the strip, it isn't too far off. The food is done right and the tapas allowed me to snack on the cheap. Yes. All that was a snack, not lunch. All kidding aside, Firefly is the place to be if you want small plates. I went during the day so it was quite mellow. I'm sure it gets somewhat rowdy at night as it turns into a lounge after hours. Either way, you will get your tapas the most delicious way possible.",

It's a hidden gem visited by many locals and a place where you can practically order anything on the menu and not be disappointed. Living in Los Angeles, whenever I happen to come to visit Vegas this is always the first place on my to do list. The food and service are exceptional and always consistent. The prices are very reasonable for the quality of food!! This place is perfect to come with family and friends.. Considering that it's a tapas style restaurant everything could be easily shared and leave you completely full and satisfied. Make sure to call in advance to make a reservation as the place gets very busy late in the evenings.. Especially weekends. The crowd favorites seem to be the stuffed dates, ceviche, baked goat cheese, tuna tartare, firefly fries, and the Camarones A La Diabla! I can't even get started with the Garlic Bread that they serve complimentary once you arrive.. HEAVEN!

The food and service were outstanding, and the Tapas theme great for having a fun business meal. The place was noisy, but you could still hear each other. However this trip to Firefly we found the restaurant had moved to a new and larger location just about a block up the road, however the building has low ceilings and terrible acoustics, making the once passable noise level for business unacceptable. Also, the tables are really small, so once you seat six or more people, and they start bringing Tapas, there is simply ZERO room to put the food! Unfortunately we will now sadly not return for business meals, but will always go for the Bacon-wrapped Dates!",

All the tapas are $4.50-$8 each and the drinks were reasonable too. The result - 6 items and drinks for under $50 for the two of us!  We had: Chicken Empanadas - my favorite dish, flakey and full of flavor; a lot lighter than a typical empanada. Excellent.  Tuna Tartar - not the best tuna I have eaten but for $8 it was decent for the price  Bacon wrapped almond fig - okay no the official name but you will see the one I am talking about it. If you like bacon order it. The perfect blend of salty and sweet. Has a bit of blue cheese and a balsamic type sauce. Very good.  Apple and Manchu Salad - really awesome. a light and yummy summer salad. I love the fresh green apple cut julian with the almost-blue-cheese.   Garlic bread with almond butter - the free dish was probably the most unique. I need to know where they got the almond butter from because it was like nothing I have ever tasted. It was galic meets peanut butter, but not. It looked and spread like butter but tasted creamer. So good.  Dessert - Gelato Trio - 3 excellent flavors: chocolate, vanilla and my favorite the pistachio.  Sangria it was the sparkling white one aged for 3 days; very good for a hot summer day  No this wasn't the quality of San Fran tapas but it gets 4 stars for being cheaper than eating at the Olive Garden and excellent food. I will be back on my next trip to Vegas.",

My boyfriend is a full-fledged carnivore and this is a place that suits us both.   His favorite: the Rib Eye. My favorites: The empenadas, the artichoke toasts (with or without the aioli!), the green apple salad and the lentils (though they do need a little salsa/sauce).   We always sit at the bar.  Service is not the friendliest in the land or the most attentive but it is definitely not bad. Actually, in about the 2 years we have been going there it has improved. But there is still the occasional empty bar and we have to flag down the bartender even though there is no one else around.   I encourage you... please do NOT go here. It will be too packed and I will be super sad if we cannot find a seat! This is my place, MINE I tell you!",

I was in Vegas for 5 days and this was by far my favorite restaurant and I will be back the next time I'm in the area. Heard about it on Yelp and realized the hotel we were staying at our first night was right next door so I made a reservation (btw this is a couple blocks behind the strip but worth the detour). We ordered the Stuffed Dates, fries, and beef bocadillas. We may have had one more item, but I can't remember. Everything's was great although the little beef sandwiches were noticeably bland. The True MVP of our meal was the pitcher of sangria we ordered: BEST. SANGRIA. EVERRRR!! I still day dream about this stuff. The atmosphere in here is completely appropriate for a special occasion, date night, or evening out with friends. My BF had never had tapas and since he's a big eater I was nervous, but he also loved his time hear and when he found out I hadn't written a review he scolded me, lol. It was his birthday and I had made a note on my online reservation. I was dog tired from our flight and we were stuffed so I had completely forget and was ready for the bill when they came out with a birthday flan for him. I'm not ashamed to admit that I fought him for the last tasty morsel. Great place.",

I used to love their bread and now that's even different!   Oh good luck getting a refill!   I just want to old firefly service back, this is too commercial for me.",

Firefly has become a must visit anytime I'm here in Vegas. The small plates are always my go to. With so many options they have something for everyone.  I do have a few favorites, \"huevos estrellados\" and \"scallop escargots\" are at the top of my list. I do try new plates when I'm there, the goal to at least try them all once. I'm sure anyone who goes will also have favorites. So take some time off from the strip and enjoy some great food.",

Coming in at around 10pm, our small party didn't end till around 1am. This is definitely the place to not only eat, but get a good conversation in.   TAPAS are amazing. Our group ordered several small plates to try it all out! Our dishes included machego Mac n cheese, stuffed peppers, Apple & machego salad, firefly fries, camarones a la Diabla, etc.   I don't eat bacon, but many others have loved the bacon wrapped dates (I wanna say it's called chorizo or something).   It was all so good my mouth continues to water. The apple and machego salad was different; definitely worth trying! The camarones a la Diabla were fancy, loved the sauce/dressing. I could go on and on about the stuffed peppers and the garlic cream cheese that was stuffed inside...but even then no justice would be served.   For dessert, us 4 girls ordered the dessert platter and that was more than enough to try their best sweet items. Flan was definitely the best!   Bottom Line: TRY what you can. It's delicious. It can get ridiculously busy, but they are open late.",

However, parking is impossible here. I had no choice but do valet on a Friday night.   I asked for a white sangria and a glass of water as soon as we sat down. I got my sangria but got my glass of water a few minutes before we left...that's 2 hours later! But then again, we were a big group. I can tell our server was really TRYING his best.  I noticed they added more items on their menu especially desserts. My Firefly faves are Firefly fries, bacon-wrapped dates, sangria and steak and mushroom skewers and a few others but I only ordered those last night since I wasn't too hungry at 9:30pm. I did get some calamari and chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms from my friends. We also got a rib eye. It was huge and comes with fries for only $20, wow! Last night's fries were super oily though.  If you get the fries, get double aioli...it's yummy! You can't go wrong with their sangria...either red or white. Just get a pitcher and leave happy. I don't recommend the Nutella dessert and I'm a huge Nutella freak...it's something you can make at home. Pretty much everything on their menu is delicious, trust me. Just have the patience for the service and pray they won't have another health violation scare.",

I also really like the eggplant with goat cheese. I mean, who doesn't like goat cheese?! It tastes like heaven.  The fries are always a good option especially with a larger party.   The escargot scallops are also divine. It's not actually escargot just cooked in an escargot tray. It's made with lemon butter and garlic sauce. Need I say anything more?  The dessert platter is also a must try. So many desserts on one tray-trust me you'll love it! The dolce de leche cake is out of this world!",

Highly recommended, and if you don't try the bacon-wrapped dates then either you're a fool or you hate bacon which is essentially the same thing. The flavor explosion is life altering. Pair the pulpo asado with a Rogue hazelnut brown; it's a surprisingly exceptional flavor combination. Cheers!",

    "text": "Hubby and I met up with some friends for a birthday dinner here. We had a reservation, but still had to wait for our table in the bar area which is pretty common on a Friday or Saturday night. The bar is big, busy and can get crowded. They have several options when it comes to hot and cold plates to share. We tried and shared several dishes from the menu and most everything was well liked.   Garlic Bread with Sweet Almond Butter - This was brought at the beginning of the meal and it's oh so addicting! Very very good.   Ham and Cheese Croquetas ($6) - Serrano ham and manchego cheese. These were tasty! Comes with 3 croquetas. Why oh why couldn't you put 4 on the plate to even things out? Lol. They are a decent size and best eaten right away while hot.   Roasted Beets and Persimmon Salad ($9) - Star anise, mixed greens, pecan crusted goat cheese, beets, persimmon and balsamic-pear vinaigrette. The greens were a tad too salty on this dish, but everything else was very good.   Mushroom Tart ($10) - This was a well liked dish at our table and now we know to order more of it next time! It came with 4 puff pastries covered in a delicious mushroom sauce and it also had some cream cheese. Everything melded well together and I wanted to lick the plate.   Stuffed Dates ($6.50) - You get 5 bacon-wrapped dates each stuffed with a smoked almond in a red wide reduction and sprinkled with blue cheese. This is one of the most popular items on the menu and with good reason. The stuffed dates here are some of the best that I have had and even when I see Firefly at Bite of LV or some other event around town I have to stop by and grab some of their stuffed dates. These tasty gems shouldn't be overlooked when ordering from the menu.   Baked Goat Cheese ($8) - Goat and garlic cream cheese in a boat of tomato sauce that's drizzled with pesto and served with toast. My hubby really liked this dish while I didn't like it much at all. I personally didn't taste any garlic it was just plain cream cheese. I did enjoy the bread that came with it.   Stuffed Peppers ($8.50) - 3 good sized Spanish piquillo peppers stuffed with fresh mozzarella and garlic cream cheese on a bed of tomato sauce and topped with green onions and crispy onions. This was a very good dish and well liked by others in our group.   Serrano Sliders ($9) - 2 mini burgers with serrano ham, cabrales bleu cheese and a side of crispy onions. These sliders tasted great, but where was the ham? I'm not sure if the ham is mixed with the burger and then cooked or if it's supposed to be slices on the slider, but there was no visible ham or none that could be tasted in the mini patty itself. Still tasty regardless however with serrano  in the name I would expect more of a piggy flavor.   Someone in our group brought a birthday cake from a local bakery and the restaurant had no problem slicing it up and serving it to us on their dishes after our meal. Service was good and the menu is priced fairly. Definitely a great place for large groups.",

The sauce to go with it is buttery and fantastic.  I would highly recommend trying their food. It did not disappoint.",

The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because the wait time to sit and the wait time for your food are a little out of hand.   *Tip* Before you read the rest: If you're looking to try the Paella, order as soon as your butt hits the chair. It is to die for, BUT you have to wait 45 mins while they wait!   We went to Firefly for Valentine's Day, and it looks like we weren't the only ones that had that idea. We had to wait for about 45 min - 1 hour to be seated. Not bad for a popular restaurant, I guess, but definitely longer than I'm used to. Especially since there was just the two of us, not a large group.   We tried a chorizo plate ( i forgot the name of it :( sorry)  It had an over-easy egg on top of chorizo and potatoes. It was warm, and spicy and the runny yolk was just icing on the cake.   I did order the Paella and it came sizzling in a plate. It was the best Paella I've ever tasted, almost worth the wait. It was seasoned just right. I was so full from the other tapas, though,  that I ended up just tasting it and taking the rest of it home.   Order the sangria! i got the white sangria. It was white sparkling wine, peaches, grapes, oranges. It was sweet and refreshing and with just the right amount of alcohol to make waiting for my paella bearable...",

I tried a couple of the tapas including the steak and mushroom skewers, Mac and cheese, this baked egg thing and the stuffed mushrooms. Each dish was tapas sized and looked pretty but it didn't taste that great to me at all.   The Mac and cheese was not bad. Very creamy rather than cheesy actually, but it wasn't special or great. The beef skewers were wayyyyy saucy. The whole plate was covered in 3 types of sauce. Although presented nicely as the sauce made pretty patterns, the skewers weren't that flavorful and the beef was chewy!  The egg thing was a super disappointment. It had the same roasted red pepper garnish as the Mac and cheese and beef skewers ( how lame.. Same garnish for all your dishes?) with a piece of potato inside?  It was very flavorless. The stuffed mushrooms were ok. I've had better. The mushrooms were good.. the chicken paste they stuffed it with was kind of weird.   It's a nice big place with nice outdoor seating and a full bar. Service was good, ambiance was good, parking was good. Everything was pretty great except the food haha. I will not come here again unless someone chooses to eat here for their birthday. :(.",

    "text": "Long overdue review. Came here in Feb during our trip to Vegas. This was the one restaurant that I was dying to try in Vegas. So I made the BF drive here straight from the airport, even before we checked into our hotel.    Firefly sits in an unassuming location off the strip. I didn't expect it to be so big inside, but I guess everything is bigger in Vegas (or is that Texas?). Anyway, came during late lunchtime on a weekday, so the place was pretty empty. The menu looked so good that I wanted to order one of everything, but the BF convinced me to start with just five dishes first, probably a more sensible approach.   Here are the dishes we tried: Stuff Dates - my favorite dish! To be fair, I rarely met a stuffed date dish that I didn't like. The combination of the soft sweet dates, crunchy salty bacon and the stinky Gorgonzola cheese is just heavenly.   Lamb Chops - oh how I love my lamb chops. I always try order it when I see it on the menu, even though most of my friends can't stand the taste of lamb (whatever, more for me). The chops here were seasoned well and perfectly cooked. The accompanied lentils and vegetables made me feel healthy, despite the fact that I just inhaled two lamb chops.   Stuffed Peppers - not a dish that I would normally order, but I am so glad I listened to our waiter and got it here. The peppers had just a hint of spiciness and provided a perfect balance to the creamed cheese. I still think about this dish today...   Shrimp in Sweet & Spicy Sauce - shrimps were well cooked, I didn't really taste the spicy note in the sauce, but it was a good sauce nevertheless   Tuna Tartare - the most average dish among the ones we tried. I didn't think the tuna was very flavorful, although the taro chips were good.   Trio of Gelato and Chocolate Tres Leches Cake - oh that cake, it was what dreams were made of, so fluffy, so moist and so chocolaty. I would marry it if I could. Or at least date it for as long as I can without the BF getting jealous. It was sooo perfect. The gelato were good too, but, they were like the jealous bridesmaids next to the cake.   The service was a little weird, our waiter was extremely attentive in the beginning with recommendations and water refills. All five of our dishes came out in extremely quick successions, I understand the place was pretty quiet, but they could've slowed down and allowed us to savor the food instead of rushing us. Our small table was covered in plates in the span of 10 minutes. Also, our waiter disappeared once we've put the dessert and coffee order in.  I had to track down another waiter to finally get my coffee. Moreover the coffee came in a comically small cup, it was more like an espresso cup. I would normally take off a star for the weird service, but the food was soooo good that I am will to overlook it.   Overall, I highly recommend the place, wish they would open an outpost in NYC!!",

    "text": "This is a hidden gem in Las Vegas! Located at the end of the strip on the far side near the convention center, I had no idea this place existed until I was invited by friends. We showed up around the time of happy hour and I quickly saw the place fill up!  (There is valet which is complimentary aka tips only, so that's helpful when it becomes busy)  Our group decided to order a bunch of tapas, small appetizers, and share those as well as some pitchers of libations!   I decided to stay with my go-to: red wine. However, I did have a taste of the sangria and it was delicious!   My favorite tapas were the shrimp ceviche which was fresh and served with crunchy chips. Also, the parmesan fries were crisp and hot. The chicken skewers were tender and came with roasted veggies.   I loved the ambiance as Firefly had in and outdoor seating and rooms for large parties like ours. My only caveat was that the servers weren't quite privy to large parties, it seemed. I should've brought cash so that I could check out quicker, like most in my group. But, I thought that most people these days used cards to pay. I ended up waiting over 30 minutes to get my check, give my card to the server, and then another 15+ to actually sign my check to leave.",

There were no tables inside, but the outdoor sitting area had fire pillars to keep you warm (see picture)  4. The bathrooms were clean and had around 5 stalls so there was no line for women (always a plus)  Cons: 1. Our entree came out before a lot of our tapas which was weird for me  2. The blue cheese on top of the steak was a bit much so if you don't love blue cheese ask for it on the side  What we ordered: 1. Scallops Escargots (hot tapas) 2. Lamb chops (hot tapas) 3. Roasted Eggplant Cannelloni (hot tapas) 4. Stuffed dates (hot tapas) 5. Chicken and Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms (hot tapas) 6. Blue Cheese Ribeye 7. Flan (not a huge fan) 8. Chocolate and cherry bread pudding (delish)",

Great atmosphere with great drink selections and spanish beer. The manager Eduardo was extremely gracious.  I will definitely be going back and recomending to friends. By far the best place we ate during our recent Vegas trip.",

His recommendations were right on and his service was excellent considering we'd order each appetizer one at a time before deciding what we wanted next. The only note is if you are looking for a quiet place to have a romantic dinner this is probably not for you as it's a little loud inside the restaurant...it didn't bother us at all, but a warning if wanting a more intimate setting. The prices were great as we had 2 drinks from the bar each (so 4 total) and 4 small plates and our bill was only $65, a completely great deal in Vegas!",

Then his friend eas talking more trash and loud enough fIe me tp hear thsy she wanted me to say something again so she could hit me. One of ours friends  came to tell him not to talk to us that way he wanted to fight him and then his friend had more words and threatened us and continued wanting to fight. I went and got management and told him what happen.  Management  had  three people leave and the host for salsa dancing went and brought them back in after the fact. The host then goes up to us and told us to stay on one side of the floor or she was going to call the police. We went and got management to come to tge bar and they appeared to be in shock. I ask them to explain to me why host was allowed to do that and they were unable to explain why.  We spent over 1500.00 tonight and was treated  very poorly. The host who is not an employee of fly flies  choose to keep non paying customers over paying. The fact we were planning on spending more money before the drama over 2 chairs. We won't be coming there for another event we will spend our money at another location.",

I did some web-searching and cross-referencing and Firefly seemed to fit the bill.  It was a Saturday night and we arrived at Firefly at about 8:00p.  After about 5 minutes we were seated on the heated patio that was beautifully strung with red and white lights and really just seemed to be an extension of the dining room.  Drinks were tasty: sangria and dirty martinis, and we were offered a nice crusty bread with compound butter consisting of schraicha, honey and almonds.  It was really good!  We ordered two cold plates and two hot plates.  The green apple manchego salad and pisto were real standouts.  All the plates were reasonably priced between $4 and $6.  For dessert: the caramel flan with almond biscotti was sized very well and tasted perfect! Not too-eggy and velvety smooth.  All-in-all a great dining experience.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend!!",

I haven't tried dessert because I'm usually full by then, but I can only imagine they are inspired.  Portions are a steal with prices ranging with smaller tapas $4 to hearty paellas $20. And believe me, you'll want to share that paella!! It's a lively place that I always think of going with a large group. But I must note, this new bar is large and the separation from the restaurant makes it comfortable to kick back with their sangria on your own as well.  The staff is friendly and attentive. The bartender is knowledgeable & smiles. And now this new space is bright, clean and inviting. I'm glad to see them bouncing back from the bad press they received from the shutdown.  After all, mistakes happen, and we all deserve a second chance! Wait to go Firefly! I'll see you again very soon I'm sure.",

    "text": "The 5 stars goes to our dinner and our server, which was absolutely wonderful. We were a party of five and ordered the chicken & mushroom paella, two pitchers of the red sangria (my favorite over the white) and several tapas. The bacon wrapped dates are by far the best I've ever had, the pork empanadas and roasted red peppers are also a standouts. All the others were great as well. Although we enjoy this place a lot, it was our first time bringing out of town family members here and they were beyond impressed with the food, ambiance and service.   HOWEVER: I must note that the valet parking here is RIDICULOUS!  It's like FIVE feet from the entrance. We initially parked in an open spot out front NOT marked for valet, only to have the jerky valet guy bitch us out for parking in a \"valet\" spot. So we backed out of the spot, drove about two feet and gave him our keys to valet....and he parked it in just about the same damn spot! I don't get it, but whatever. Wasn't thrilled about tipping him either, but the fiance did.   Definitely my favorite restaurant in Vegas. Despite the idiot valet situation. I think we would have had a better time if we weren't all put off by the valet guy. Lame.",

We've done Jaleo in our hometown (it's a go to) so we venture away from the Vegas locations to try Firefly. The white sangria stood out as the best thing we ordered. With four of us we order 10 plates and they were all good - nothing to really complain about - but nothing that stood out. Nice staff. The mark down is for the roaming photographer who's running some sort of \"you're on the rollercoaster at DisneyWorld and want to buy pictures.\" She took a few and then came back to pass along a 'free' photo and offerings to sell. I don't need someone selling me photos at dinner - it's cheap and...cheap. And, vaguely unprofessional for a restaurant. If the manager reads this, knock it off. It's awful. Ran about $125 for ten plates, a pitcher of sangria, and two coffees.",

    "text": "I lived for another day...so their previous demerits should not merit on this review. I like their new location and the new feel. It's very dark, romantic (if you want it to be), and hip. They are filled with nicely designed booths for more privacy, and they have a private room which you can reserve for a big party.  I headed to the bar and of course you have to order one of their signature mojitos or sangria (by the glass or pitcher...if i were you I'd order a pitcher) as I wait for the rest of my party. Even if I was already late I was still early than the rest of my group. Anyway, I ordered a glass of the BLOOD ORANGE MOJITO. Then, as our party slowly but surely showed up, we ordered rounds of pitchered mojitos. This included the watermelon and cucumber mojito.   Here are my mojito highlights: Glass: $7.50 Pitcher: $30.00  BLOOD ORANGE: Lovely! It has that nice tart taste from the blood orange, and can barely taste the alcoholic kick. So if you want something with a strong cocktaily flavor with less of an alcoholic taste I would recommend.  CUCUMBER: This is pretty good too. Here, you taste more of the alcoholic flavor. It is a lighter mojito flavor wise. So if you're looking for something fun in flavor...probably steer away from here.  WATERMELON: While a pitcher or two of these bad boys may lead you to your own rendition to DRUNK IN LOVE (you can't help it since Queen B does say watermelon), this has a really light refreshing taste with a good mixture of that alcoholic POW. Definitely, one of my faves. In which we did drink the most of.   Food wise, we ordered a bunch of random plates in which a party of 7 shared. 4 pitchers and a handful of tapas plates later, our tab reached a good $300. So expect to pay a good $60 to $80 PER PERSON especially if it's at a dinner party.   Other favorite foods I like ordering here:  DATES CHORIZO SKEWERS SCALLOP ESCARGOT STEAK AND MUSHROOM SKEWERS SHRIMP CEVICHE MUSHROOM/CHEESE TART (this is really filling with a strong cream taste...which is usually a hit or miss with people so be careful)  Just name drop these choices and you'll sound like a regular here. Other than that, read everyone else's review on the plates.",

Everything we tried was amazing and the tuna tartar was the best - I had TWO! This will be a MUST place to go to whenever I am in Vegas. I even dare say that it is a lot better than some high prices, high rise, five star restaurant's I've been to on both the strip and downtown.  But remember this is a TAPAS restaurant which means that plate sizes are finger food sized and not very large. It is a good place for groups but if you are all looking to stuff your face then this is not the place for you. If however you are looking for a sleek and posh restaurant with amazingly high quality food and flavor this is THE place!",

Best way I can explain tapas are little plates personal size, of appetizers. It's so fun because you all order different things and you pass around and try. They also have an extensive drink menu...but since my drink of choice is diet coke with lime... I'll leave it at that . Some of my favorite things to try... first and foremost- bacon wrapped dates- seriously , they will change your life! I always order these! Loved the apple slaw salad thing.. The best review I can say is. Don't be afraid to try... get some items that you wouldn't normally eat! There is not a bad thing on this menu!! Also.. get dessert, I'm thinking it was the chocolate tres leches.... amazing!!!",

The parking is not great in the back of the building, but outside of that this is a huge improvement. They fit plenty of seating and you don't feel like you are right on top of the people next to you as you were in the previous location.  Love that they have a full size bar now with plenty of seating. Food was as good as always... I have a very hard time not ordering the Serrano Sliders every time I go to Firefly. It's pretty sad actually.  Wish them luck with the new location and hope they learned their lesson and continue to monitor their staff/food more closely moving forward.",

Let me just say they were amazing. I also ordered.. Steak & mushroom skewers, baked goat cheese, spicy beef salad (I wasn't absolute fan ..but the rest the table was), mushroom tart (perfect) , chicken tinga empanada (yum) , baby back ribs (also not my favorite but very tender) , camarones a la diabla (loved) , and last but not least ceviche of shrimp (also very delicious.)

We went here for the first time last weekend with my brother and sister-in-law and learned first-hand exactly why it is one of their favorite place to dine in Las Vegas. The food was stellar and the service prompt and friendly. This was my first tapas experience and I fear it may have spoiled me for anywhere else.   Since there were five of us and we all shared our selections with the rest of the group, I got to taste a wide variety of their menu offerings. It is hard to pick a favorite because everything was delicious, but I think I'd have to go with the stuffed dates if pressed to only pick one. I only had the white sangria but it was so superb I can't imagine the other sangria offerings would not be as well-crafted and delicious as the white.",

I like it as a less formal dining option, decent food.  Service at this location is much better than the westside location.  Probably why that location is closing..

Definitely a place you can come with a party...to party.  With awesome food, service and ambiance, a good time is to be had!  No matter how many people you come with, you can expect them to enjoy their experience.  Don't worry about ordering, everyone can order something different and pass the plates around.  A favorite of mine is patatas bravas, veggie empanada, firefly fries, and mac n cheese.  That mac n cheese I won't share.  Get your own, you won't regret it. Along with the food, the drinks are tasty too.  Can't go wrong with sangria.  Red sangria is really good.  If you plan to have more than 1 drink, order a pitcher.  Service here, I hate to say, could be better.  My friends and I were seated right away, but service after that was slowww. And we were sitting at the bar, where someone is always there.  We ordered through someone other than our waiter, because he was a lil too busy.  But other than that, I enjoyed myself.  Fridays at 10:30pm is Latin night.  Salsa! So much fun.  I love watching the really experienced dancers.  The fluidity of their movements is amazing.  Some of them incorporating flips and special turns in their routines.  And they all switch partners.  Don't be surprised if someone come to you while your dancing.",

Ordered the usual:  Stuffed Dates - bacon wrapped... yum!  Some might find the flavor unusual however... each serving comes with 5  Roasted Beet Salad - have had better elsewhere... you can skip this and try something else  BBQ Mango Ribs - my favorite dish... very tangy yet has that mango sweetness... meat falls off the bone... dish comes with 4 good sized ribs  Firefly Fries - truffle fries = king of all fries.  comes with a nice dipping sauce as well  Stuffed Mushrooms - stuffed with some sort of chorizo... fantastic. 4 pieces per order  Seafood Paella - order this right when you sit down because it takes a while to cook... probably could feed 4-6 people... it's great!  It's quite on the peppery/spiced side (not spicy but you can taste a lot of different spices added).  Unfortunately it came last and we were quite full already and couldn't enjoy it.  Even the bread appetizer is delicious... comes with what I think was a jalapeno butter and olives.  I stayed away from it this time... but the Sangria is fantastic.  Especially if you get it during happy hour.... quite the bang for the buck... careful though... that sh*t creeps up on you!  Only reason this doesn't get 5 stars in my book is the music is way too loud and the service is a bit slow.",

People were dressed anywhere from jeans to cocktail dresses. My group was impressed with the food. Mine was really good, but I'm going 4 stars because I felt like my shrimp (ceviche) and octopus were slightly overcooked. Not the best I've ever had, but it was good. The tapas selection was insane, huge variety and super reasonably priced especially considering how large the plates were.",

The filet mignon was cooked perfectly. The stuffed dates in the wine reduction are a must! The warm salad was amazing! We were not big on the chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms. It was hit and miss on whether or not there was enough stuffing in the mix.   We loved it so much we came a second time and ordered all the same dishes except we had lamb instead of the stuffed mushrooms and we ordered TWO of the stuffed dates (so friggin good!). The lamb was the first dish we had that we were not impressed with. We love lamb and eat a lot of it. This was tough and lacking flavor. The lentils that come with it were great though. The cook on the Tierra y mar the second time was off too. One of the shrimp tasted raw. Meat was tougher. I think it is probably different chefs on different nights? We were not as thrilled the second night.",

The food was great. Their butter is so good I can eat a whole tub of it. My husband still loves this place and like Pinball HF we come here every visit to LV.   I don't like this place much anymore because I have had better. They lost their touch. The warm salad is just warm lemon juice on greens. So plain. Should change up the menu, or go back to the old menu. Tapas is an adventure to me but Firefly decided to get married.   Four stars because he loves it and I think it's ok. Worth a try. All our friends now love this place.   They use to give out really cute matchboxes but not anymore. Boo.",

The Summer salad features thinly sliced french green beans,  marinated in a balsamic dressing surrounded by halved red and black cherry tomatoes and a few dollops of smooth, lucious burrata cheese.  Delicious!   The Albondiga -meat balls in tomato sauce- doesn't sound exciting but it is irresistible.  Serrano ham and Manchester croqettas- sublime.  Crispy outside soft and delicious inside.  The red Sangria was perfect. We had other dishes and all were top notch.    The Flan was a spectacularl end to a perfect meal. Smooth and creamy and not too sweet. The tiny bit of lightly sweetened tart berries was just the right foil for the creamy flan.  I recommend Firefly wholeheartedly!",

    "text": "This review is for 3.5 stars.   I came to Firefly after work on a Friday to hit up the end of Happy Hour and try some tapas I've heard so many great things about.  The Happy Hour menu only includes drinks, but included beer, wine, and Sangria, most for $5 or less.  The bar area wasn't too crowded for the time and day of the week and had a very low-light, intimate, Spanish-type of setting.  It was a great environment and had a very post-work feeling to the crowd.  This makes sense as the restaurant is ideally located right next to the Corporate sector of Las Vegas.  I began with the Sangria, and it was very good and highly recommended.  I also had a chorizo plate which was quite good but not as authentic as I was expecting.  I saw a bunch of orders around me and they all looked great.  I will be back to come for an actual meal in the very near future.  Most of the food sits at around $7-13 for tapas so it is highly affordable and worth a go if in the area or even for an after work stop.",

    "text": "Firefly recently started serving brunch, and I have been wanting to try it since they started. I finally decided to go to celebrate my 22nd birthday with some friends. The brunch was so good, and you can still order from the rest of the menu if you want. It is a tapas breakfast still, which at first I was a little skeptical about, but it ended up being great! I had their patatas bravas (Potatoes) and the carne asada breakfast taco. The tacos are like little street tacos, but they were SO good. I also tried one of the Pumpkin Beignets, they look a little bit like donut holes,  they didn't really taste like pumpkin, but they were still a tasty treat.   Most importantly, for brunch they have all you can drink (with a 2 hour limit), mimosas, sangria, and bloody marys. I obviously had to try all of them. The mimosas were very good, I am not a big fan of bloody marys while I'm eating, but besides that it was a very basic bloody mary, still tasty. Their sangria is always good, so no surprise there. I like to get the sparkling white, because I'm not a big wine fan. We definitely stayed the whole two hours.   Besides the food, the service was great! There were about 10 of us so we had a lot of people coming over to help. The manager even stopped by to wish me happy birthday which was very nice! I also got a birthday shot, great place to go to celebrate! I would definitely recommend!  *disclaimer: I had written this almost a year ago, and apparently forgot to submit it. I just noticed it was still in my drafts and decided I should still post it!",

I ordered the ceviche (as its my top fave) and it came out way after our 2 order of tapas. I didnt like that they drop off plates at the table and leave right away. I needed condiments and Im in the service industry myself, I feel like they could at least ask if we need anything else. After asking 2 people that werent my server about the ceviche, they finally brought it out. We didnt see our server much until we would look around. I know I'll be back because this is one of my favorite local restaurants. I just wish they improved their service.",

Back again to treat my daughter and daughter-in-law for mother's day. Our reservation for 3 plus an infant was 545 on Saturday night. Although not a place you would normally take a baby, the girls just moved to Vegas and a sitter was not an option. They kindly accommodated us in a corner booth with plenty of room for the baby. (She slept most of the time and then smiled at & watched the staff bustling around). On top of the dishes from my first visit, we added the mushroom  tart, tuna tartare, lemon & berry tarts, stuffed dates. Again, it was all delicious. I tried the blood orange mojito which was so good I had a second.   This place is a gem. There isn't another restaurant I've been to twice in 6 months, and I'd go back here today.

    "text": "I LOVE this place.... it's a MUST GO to when I come to Vegas.  This time I brought my girlfriends and we really went to town!!  We came here to eat an early dinner before our show.  Ordered about 12 dishes to share among 4 of us.  We could've done with just 10 as the meat dishes were huge!!  But we managed to eat everything plus down a pitcher of white Sangria which is a MUST!!  so light and refreshing!!  Food came out pretty steadily...  We started with the Apple and Manchego salad! SO GOOD - slivers of refreshing green apples and manchego cheese (which is light and not over whelming) along with chopped smoked almonds to give that extra crunch!  We then got the warm spinach salad - WOW!  So MUCH - perfect for four of us - very lightly dressed - loved the artichoke hearts and feta that came with it!!  We loved EVERYTHING we ordered.... their tuna tartare with bits of fresh avocado to be enjoyed with crispy taro chips!  WE LOVED their Veggie Empanada... I actually wished I could've eaten a whole one myself!  The crust was crunchy - with warm fresh veggies - SO MOUTHWATERING GOOD!! Then there's the mushrooms that were stuffed with chicken, chorizo and cheese!! so good... then you can never go wrong with their fried calamari!! :)  A nice surprise was the octopus!  had a bit of a bite - spice but the octopus was SO tender... grilled to perfection!!  Loved their lamb chops (we had to order 2 as each order comes with 2 lamb chop).  Had SO much lentils... was crazy - that's the one thing we couldn't finish... OH and their ribs - scrape off the bone deliciousness!!  OH and the other nice surprise was the Shrimp with the sweet and sour sauce... shrimp cooked perfectly but that SAUCE.. yes - wipe clean with the bread goodness and even dipping our calamari in the sauce was AWESOME....  Overall we had a GREAT time - rolled out of there... the one thing about service which was frustrating was we needed our bill so we can run to our show...  the waiter forgot and I had to chase him down after 10 minutes... UGH...  but other than that - great and fun place to get a variety of tasty tapas and DELICIOUS refreshing drinks!!  A MUST GO to place when visiting Vegas!",

It was a busy time for the restaurant and our server took his time to go over the menu with us, suggested some great items from the menu and was constantly checking on us.  One thing I noticed about this restaurant was that all of the staff worked together. If we needed something anyone was willing to help us.  We will definitely be going back.

We consistently had great food and great service, but this past visit was horrible.   There were maybe 10 other diners in the establishment; slow time of the evening gearing up for the evening. Our waiter came by, took our order (4 tapas for 3 people) and we never saw him again. We had to flag him down for our bill; deciding not to even bother to order more food.  Food was ok, like a few other reviewers we thought they changed some ingredients and some of the dishes all tasted the same.   Regardless, it will be some time before we go back.",

Artichoke Toast - $7 - Artichoke was tender and seasoned well.   Stuffed Dates - $6.50 - Salty bacon and sweet date. Reduction makes it really sweet.  Pulpo Asado - $10 - Octopus was grilled perfectly and really tender. Too much potato mixed in, made it hard to find the octopus.   Camarones Al Ajillo - $11 - Shrimp were plump and tasty. The lemon garlic sauce resembled something you would find in an asian restaurant.   Steak and Mushroom Skewers - $11 - The filet was so tender and flavorful. Mushrooms were placed evenly with the steak so each bite was perfect. The garlic butter and parmesan enhanced the steak but did not overpower it. My favorite dish we tried.   Babyback Ribs - $12 - Ribs were fall off the bone. The mango sauce was good but there was to much and made the ribs so saucy and sweet and hid the pork flavor.   Chocolate Tres Leches Cake - $7 - Chocolatey and moist cake.  Red Sangria - $8 Blueberry Mojito - $8 The signature drinks they have here. Good but to sweet for me.",

When you first walk in it feels sexy and intriguing, but the further into the restaurant you go the more it feels like just a dimly lit casual restaurant (NOT a compliment).   Nonetheless, the servers were pretty nice, and the dishes came out at a good pace. It was definitely a very solid dinner, if you count only the \"easy\" dishes. In other words, their kitchen is fine in terms of using skill, but for things like charcuterie where sourcing really matters, they weren't great.",

While the food itself is pretty good, it is not \"amazing\" or good enough to justify the high prices & small portion sizes relative to the price...especially considering the poor customer service. If they knocked $2-$5 off each dish or increased portion sizes by 30-40%, I might not mind coming back.  Do not come here with a group or on the weekends! If you're with a group, they won't allow you to split checks so expect to spend a lot of time calculating the bill and have everyone bring cash. They say you can just use the ATM but it was broken when we went last Saturday.  Also, parking is a nightmare here and we, along with many others, had to make our own spaces along the wall.",

The restaurant is beautiful! Black velvet wall paper, red velvet booths, perfect dinner lighting.  Even the staff's uniform is great! Everyone was so professional,  kind and attentive. The perfect spot for a special event! The beautiful manager offered us a complimentary glass of champagne and checked in on us a couple times, she was so nice! We decided to purchase the photos from the young lady taking shots of guests. She did an amazing job!  We got blood orange mojito and sparkling sangria. Both drinks were big, mixed exactly right and it was happy hour! Bonus!!!!   Our server suggested a tapa item from each section, we decided to get 2 of her 4 suggestions. We also got the special of the night YES! They were so good. Here's what we decided on: Boquerones, anchovies on toast w/roasted red pepper, vinegar, fresh avocado and greens. Delicious! Everything blended quite well... the acid from the vinegar was a perfect touch.  Bacon wrapped dates.  W/smoked almond and bleu cheese. I could eat a platter of these!! They were addicting! A MUST try  Eggplant cannenoli with goat cheese. Tender, thin sliced eggplant, creamy filling, light tomato sauce. Excellent   Grilled Octopus with roasted potato and diced pepper relish . I Love this dish. I don't remember the title of it, but it was cooked perfectly. I usually get octopus or squid and this dish was one of my all time favorites. Acidic, sweet, and a textural delight.  Heart of palm \"crab cake\" a vegan choice...very very VERY good. Over baby greens topped w an aoili, these cakes were prepared perfectly, lightly panseared, perfectly moist and very fresh.  Special was...Red Snapper and grilled shrimp over grilled asparagus w pomegranate sauce. Again, another fantastic dish. It was cooked perfectly, especially the seafood. So tasty!   We got the dessert platter, had a couple bites and took it togo since we were full. Every item was fresh. Chocolate tres leche was our favorite as well as passionate fruit cheesecake.  I Would absolutely recommend Firefly and we may go again before we leave Las Vegas, as there were many more things to try.",

    "text": "We came here last night and left REALLY impressed with the food! The service, on the other hand, was less than stellar.   We initially sat at the bar to grab some drinks before the rest of our party arrived. The bar was busy, but bartenders kept flying by for at least 10 minutes until 1 finally asked to take our order. We had the sangria & the tamarind margarita. The drinks were good!   Once our party arrived we sat down and scoured the menu. We settled on the shrimp ceviche, tuna tartare, Mac and cheese, and shrimp de ajillo (Friday in lent so no meat). All the dishes came out at a decent rate and tasted great! My 2 favorite were the tartare and ceviche. It was some of the best ceviche I've ever had!   Now, back to the service... Our waitress was mediocre, and the bar was constantly backed up to the point it took 20+ minutes for our party to get their 2nd round of drinks.   Thinking we could get our drinks faster, we started ordering them from the bar... However!!! Drinks took well over 30 minutes to come out directly from the bar. It was quite bizarre.   All in all, food was awesome, drinks tasted good but took forever to arrive. Salsa dancing was pretty cool too! We'd come back for the food & hope to have better drink service next time.",

    "text": "I wanted something different for lunch, and an exhausting search for seafood popped this place up on yelp. Good reviews, small plates, why not, right? A quick lyft from the strip, the restaurant looked divey and dingy, like it's going through a remodel. I figured if it was gross, we could just get some pizza or something afterwards. The hostess sat us down on the rear corner by the kitchen, and only a few other people were there at noon.  We ordered a pitcher of white sangria for $33. It was delicious, filled with fruit. We decided ro do a bunch of small items, 2 at a time, on case we didn't like it. First up was stuffed dates and white anchovy avocado toasts. Holy crap, that was good! The dates had a red wine reduction and were wrapped in bacon. A perfect single bite. The toasts tasted like ahi and avocado,  the tiny anchovies were succulent and tasted of clean ocean water. Next, we selected an eggplant roll, stuffed with goat cheese and served in a simple tomato sauce with green onions. Very creamy and soft, I liked it best smeared on the bread from the bread basket. We also got a chorizo sausage, shrimp, and filet mignon skewer, with a salsa Verde. So flavorsome, all the meats were the right texture. The grilled octopus and potato dish came next, and made my taste buds tingle- the octopus wasn't chewy, but had a meaty, almost steak texture. We also ordered hearts of palm crab cakes (which were actually vegan, no crab involved!) which were tasty, but not something I would get again. For desert, the vanilla flan with the almond cookie. Best flan I've ever had, I will dream of it! My husband also got the chocolate  cake, which was good, but not flan good. What I was most surprised about was the affordability. Our epic lunch, with a tip, was half of what we expected, but each dish is priced at about 5 to 14 dollars. We left stuffed, happy, and determined to return! Go here.",

The chicken skewers with veggies, scallops served escargot style, and bacon wrapped dates were all full of flavor. They serve bread with some kind of butter, almond butter if I remember correctly. It was different - my husband wasn't crazy about it, but I enjoyed it trying something new.   Even though we were satisfied from the three small plates, we ordered the dessert platter. It's a good value for the money if you like sweets. I wouldn't say any specific dessert blew me away, but I am glad we got to try several different things.   Our bill was less than $50 (before tip) for three small plates, two sodas, and the dessert - for Vegas stands that is a cheap meal, but nothing about it tasted cheap!",

Order the clams and chorizo and get some extra bread because the broth is the elixir of life.  Pork empanada is another favorite from a large menu of small plates.  There is something for everyone in your group and sharing is the order of the day.  I always go when I travel to Las Vegas.",

The staff really took care of us, the service was excellent, the food was really good,decent portions for tapas style and reasonably priced. Our wait staff even came out with a birthday dessert for my wife and her cousin who was also celebrating her birthday. Would definitely recommend Firefly to anyone who wants to have some good food, a casual restaurant with nice ambiance and an overall good time.

Excellent bar atmosphere, chill and great customer service. Overall appearance of the restaurant is great.  Best thing they can do for this place, re-train their cooks or fire the ones they have. They need new cooks.   Overall, take your money elsewhere, this is VEGAS. You will find better.",

Like more tapas restaurants, you'll need to order multiple items to get full, if that's your intention. The Sangria is recommended, also. There were 3 of us and we each ordered 2 dishes plus a pitcher of sangria. The sangria might have caused us to feel full but it was worth it. I ordered the skewer and the potato dish. I don't recall what my friends ordered. There is a dance floor adjacent to the entrance and it's a pretty lively place. I would recommend this restaurant if you want to get away from the strip.",

He finally go if you want it you have it but he's going to be nasty. The garlic shrimp and spicy potatoes and shrimp ceviche were the best thing on the menu. The clams hold the meat were also good. He recommended the mussels with curry sauce so we tried it and sent it back it so gross. It was a Mexican restaurant but the flavor of the food was Asian and Italian ( Diablo shrimp dish ). I probably wouldn't come back here again.",

Interior was very nice and server was friendly however we were seated in the middle area near where the kitchen is and the servers kept on hitting the back of my chair when they walked by. It happened at least 8 times while sitting down so I moved my seat and a server noticed and asked about it. I said it was fine since I moved my chair but shouldn't the servers notice if they hit something as well? Food was good so points for that but it's really unnecessary to walk so fast when it wasn't even a full house. Anyways my favorite dishes were the Bacon Wrapped Dates and Scallop Escargot. Everything else I'll take a pass on, even the complimentary bread was not memorable, it was hard and stale.",

Never had that flavor in a sangria. It was great. We ordered a couple mojitos as well - they were good, but the sangria just blew em out of the water.  We were vegetarians and I went here after reading someone else's review that said they had vegetarian options. He was right on the money! It had a good number of vegetarian options - and they were willing to customize the almond stuffed dates to make em veggie-friendly as well. And all the dishes were excellent.  Honestly, I'd have given these guys 4.5 stars, but I rounded up cuz the food & drink were so good. The -0.5 stars would have been for 2 things :  1) for loudness. Try asking for outdoor sitting to help with that (it seemed quieter outside). There was a longer wait for outside seating when we went 2) When we did ask to move from inside to outside the waitress insisted that we'd have to close out our bill and then move and re-open a new tab. I get that we'd have a new waiter/waitress (i.e. I don't want someone else getting my tip?) , but as a customer, that should be transparent to me. They should have been able to figure it out between themselves, and leave me out of the picture.  Having said that, this place is a must visit for me now.. I'm going here (and asking for outdoor seating) next time I visit the area!",

We sat down & I bet it took a server ten mins to greet us. We were not only ready with our drink order, but our food order. I had their house infused vodka martini & my husband a Moscow mule. Mine was watered down, remade (I mean stirred as the server said) & then it tasted like cough medicine. My husbands mule he said was good. We ordered the stuffed dates, stuffed peppers, flashed fried patron peppers, roasted pork Empanada, & scallops escargot. The stuffed dates were fine, but not amazing along with everything else except the stuffed peppers....they were good! So I would not go back, but at the end of things they did take off my martini even without asking. I like that, that's the way you want a restaurant to do business! Of course we never did figure out who our server was...we saw three & never one consistently.",

Our waiter Mario had taken our order not long after we sat down and it was great that he kept checking to see if we were okay or needed anything else even after service was picking up. He was great enough to let my friend and I know that if we were to come back for dinner same night to come in early, make reservations to avoid wait time as to they do get busy.

Just  sayin'. As far as the place, this is the new location much improved ambiance, further back from the street, bigger, nicer, cleaner than before. Same menu and maybe a little too friendly waiters. This is primarily a local joint , but visitors have caught on too. It's a tapas bar with some good selections; The standouts; Suffed dates: smoked almonds, blue cheese, dates and awesome sauce. Stuffed peppers: w/ cheese herbs Baby back ribs: fall off the bone tender Tierra Mar skewers ; Surf 'n Turf for us fogies- were recommended but  a bit too many things goin' on for my taste. Summer Salad with heirloom tomatoes- for Vegas OK - but not primo  by west coast standards.Greenhouse stuff , not the aroma you expect. The interior is full of options, inside, outside, bar, tables what ever you like. The best thing is that with a group of people everyone will find something they can own and get behind. Beers , or a pitcher of  white or red sangrias ,you can't beat that for  $ 28- The place beats the pants off the typical Strip crowd, it's easy, and can be quick or slow as you like. Great early or late- you could do a lot worse.  It's more about the company you 're  with than the restaurant IMO- this place will support whatever is you are trying to make of the evening.Salut.",

I'm told the champagne sangria is great and I will probably get it next time. I came here with my husband and 5 friends, this place is great for a group, because you can try many of there tapas this way. The bacon wrapped dates were my husband's favorite, and the group as a whole. I really loved the apple manchego salad, it was surprising how much I enjoyed it. It was so fresh, crisp, and nutty. I will definitely get it next time. The filet was delicious, I thought the Mac n cheese was just ok. The mushroom pastries were lightly crispy, but the saucy mushrooms on top we're just ok. Calamari good, stuffed peppers yummy. Padron peppers that were flash fried were a table favorite, I thought they were good but I might have enjoyed them more with more lemon. Was impressed with the stuffed mushrooms which was disappointing. The heirloom tomato salad wasn't very good. The butter lettuce, vinagrette, and tomatoes were yummy, but the creamy cheese they slathered on top was just too much. It overwhelmed the dish and ruined it for me. All in all I'm extremely excited to go back. I will definitely be getting Sangria (get the pitcher), filet, apple salad, dates, and stuffed red peppers again. Hopefully I'll leave some room to try some new things and dessert!  I took away a star because our waitress was kind of snobby, and seemed to be in a \"wish I was anywhere but here\" kind of mood. I'm assuming because we were in a group, they automatically added gratuity, and I don't think she was very deserving of it. Having been a waitress, I completely understand adding gratuity to parties (I wish they did that when I worked at Applebee's'), but I feel that some waiters take advantage of that and slack on service. I will return though!",

I have in to the sangria with white wine and it was delicious. I have a tapas place in Chicago that I love and this superseded my standards. The staff was really nice and friendly.

The food is always amazing and I've tried every dish on the menu. They also have great sangria, which you can order by the cup or pitcher. It does get busy, so a reservation is recommended. The private parking lot does get filled up, so you may be circling around to find a spot. You can also easily fill up on the tasty butter and bread. I came here last week with a reservation for a birthday party and we were sat down right away.   Food: The main staples that you should always order are 5+ orders of Stuffed Dates, Tierra y Mar Skewers, and the Steak & Mushroom Skewers. We also ordered the Seafood Paella, Chorizo Clams, and the Ceviche. They do bring out the food as it becomes ready, so if your party orders different dishes, they'll come out at different times. The Paella takes a long time to cook, so you'll most likely finish all the other dishes before it comes out. It's also a huge dish that can probably feed 4 people.  Dessert: Tres Leches is the best Tres Leches you'll ever eat. The tart strawberry with the chocolate shavings go perfectly with the soaked milky cake.",

Based on the building and parking lot (which is private), they must get incredibly busy later in the day, but at 11:30, I was the 2nd table seated.   I was seated right away and everyone was friendly. The service was great throughout. The waiter immediately brought bread and butter. The butter was honey and some type of pepper. I don't do bread, but it looked amazing and the sweet/spicy butter was great.   The waiter recommended 2 items and they were exactly what I had my eye on! So I got the stuffed dates and Tierra y mar from the Hot Tapas menu. Both were awesome. The dates were almonds, dates and then bacon-wrapped and had a red wine reduction and blue cheese on top. The Tierra y Mar was grilled chorizo, shrimp and steak skewers with salsa. Delicious! I will definitely go back.",

We were staying at the Elara in Vegas and were craving Spanish food, paella in particular, so after a brief search we settled on Firefly for delivery to the hotel. We ordered bacon wrapped dates, fried goat cheese, lamb chops, spicy aioli potatoes, the mixed paella and the desert sampler. After delivery charge and a $10 tip to the driver, the bill came to $100 and was worth every penny.  The flavor combinations, freshness of ingredients, execution of the dishes, and even presentation (yes even delivered) was incredible. The lamb chops were perfectly cooked, balanced salt pepper and herb profile with a great reduction served on perfect lentils. The bacon wrapped dates were decadent and creamy, with a nut in the center to give it crunch and bring all ingredients together. The fried goat cheese was spectacular, lots of spices and some crunch for texture. The star was the mixed paella, seafood, chorizo, chicken, veggies, rice, all perfectly cooked in a broth that gave the dish all the accents of home cooked Spanish food that I loved to eat while visiting my wifes family on various holidays.  I'd highly recommend anyone craving tapas, or great paella, give Firefly serious consideration. If you're at the Elara, its the perfect place since you'll have leftovers for sure.",

The items we shared: the cod, lamb, Chicago sliders, and chicken skewers were all tasty for sure.  The service was friendly enough and attentive, but the time from order to table was not very efficient.  The chicken skewers from order to table was approx. 25 minutes.  Eventually I just had to ask to check on my order when a food expeditor asked.  They also use a team approach for food service and not just one server.  All in all, it was a tasty experience but an awful time suck.  Plan on spending at least $75-100 to fill your appetite.  I do recommend utilizing one of their two happy hours where the prices are much more reduced.",

The menu states it can be shared between 2-4 people, uh no. It could be shared between 3-8 people. It could feed more people if you are ordering tapas as well. Be aware that the paella takes at least 40 minutes to prepare so relax, order some tapas, drink some of their fruity sangria's and enjoy your time. The staff at Firefly will keep you filled one way or another. And if you're feeling daring, there are nights you can go for some salsa dancing. When the weather is beautiful, their patio area at night becomes festive with music and spirited people. I've had the pleasure of tasting half of their menu so to give my take on all would leave a lengthy review. There hasn't been a dish on their tapa menu I haven't enjoyed and same goes with their paella dishes. The only item I didn't care for was their Tres Leches Cake. They have fabulous desserts that I would choose before every having to try this cake. I am cake lover but this was not sitting well on my palate. A great thing about this place is their gluten free menu. There are many choices on it, so your friends who can't eat Gluten won't feel left out.",

Make sure you make reservation ahead of time and order the Spanish rice ahead of time since it takes about 40 minutes to make. The tapas are all good, except it's a bit salty. I'm not an expert at Spanish cuisine so I don't know if this is typical or not. We ordered a lot of other dishes and I didn't take all the pictures. Besides the rice, I thought the lamb chops were great. There's a lot of #Thinsulin approved dishes as well.",

Octopus had grilled nose, very gently salty and spicy palate with soft consistency with only a hint of chewiness. Potato was skillet with skin. Smokey nose, a bit of saltiness with skin crunchiness. Some sauteed small-diced pepper, tomato, and green onion added accent. I think potato was unnecessary. 4.25/5. 4.5/5 without potato.  Merguez  Nose of feta cheese and tomato-pepper confit. Gamy lamb nose on the sausage, followed by medium saltiness and high black-pepperiness. Feta gave accent and tomato-pepper confit gave sourness fresh counterbalance. Eat them together. 4.5/5.  Service  Half bar half trendy bistro. Bar open seating. Food delivery is as authentic Spanish as the tapasAlcohol service. 4/5.  Ambience  A trendy bistro for a nice getaway. 4/5.  Overall  A delicious food at a crowded trendy place. 4.5/5.",

    "text": "Vacationing in Las Vegas was wonderful especially because we found this great Tapas restaurant. We were a table of 4 and got a seat right away since we got there at 6:30pm on a Saturday. Expect a wait if you go after 6:30pm, but it's worth the wait to get a drink and relax while you wait. We started with a pitcher of Red Sangria, which was able to serve each of us a glass and a half (we ordered a pitcher of White Sangria after that was gone). I'm not sure which I liked better. Both were delicious and the red was a little dryer which was nice since we had it with dinner and it complimented the food nicely.   We had a friend with us that is allergic to shellfish and made sure we told our server before hand that way the server can tell him if he ordered anything for himself that had shellfish in it and he wasn't aware.   The dates wrapped in bacon were one of my favorites as well as the tuna tar tar. Yummy! The flavors were like fireworks on my palate exploding with flavor and making me want more. The dishes came out quickly and even after ordering so much our final bill was not as high as we all thought it would be. 4 people ordering dishes like crazy with 2 pitchers of margarita's around $200.   In my opinion the food was better than our favorite Tapas restaurant in Boston, MA and the prices were a lot better as well. Service was great and ambiance was perfect. With it being so big I thought it would get loud, but you don't notice it when you have good food, pitchers of sangria and wonderful company. Yum!",

Had the patatas bravas, camarones a la diabla, tortilla espanola and the scallops.   Scallops are served like escargot. Mehta. Too hot, the butter and garlic overpower the scallop. Pan seared would be much better.   The patatas were very good and the sauce slightly spicy and tasty.   The tortilla is something that varies widely from place to place. This one is on the eggy side. This one was a bit underseasoned, as it needed a bit of salt. But the sauce was very good and helped an otherwise too bland dish.   The camarones were highly recommended by the waitress, and did not disappoint. Slightly spicy and sweet. Delicious.   The Rioja wine was very drinkable. The 9 ounce pour seemed a lot larger than 9 oz.. It paired well with the potatoes and shrimp.   This place isn't in the same league as Julian Serrano at the Aria, but definitely worth the visit.",

Food: lots of vegetarian options. I hear the meaty ones are good, too.  - Paella: large cast iron skillet- looking thing, which serves 3-6, not 2-4, was tasty and flavorful. *** Really does take about 40min., so order it first.   - Manchego mac & cheese: creamy & cheesy. Not overly salty  - Tomato soup: how come I can't get that flavor at home? Rich and smooth, just the right balance of tomato-sweet-salty.   - Mushroom puff pastry thing: creamy. With mushrooms that weren't overlooked- great texture.   -  Veggie empanadas:  crispy crust, and a filling of who-knows-what deliciousness. Outside wasn't too thick, and the filling was plentiful.   Sangria- 2 kinds: sparkling white or traditional red. Both were tasty, but most ppl preferred the red.  Check this place out.",

Being that we look Chicago style Italian beef sandwich with had to try their version in the tapas form and boy are we glad we did. It was three mini-mini size hoagie Italian beef that were delicious.

They use fresh ingredients not syrups so the flavors are delicious.",

    "text": "I came here on my last visit to Vegas with pretty high expectations given the 4.5 star rating, reviews, and photos. I love tapas so I was excited to give this place a try! I will say that half the tapas we ordered were pretty good and the other half just didn't do it for me.  Here is what we ordered:  Chicken Skewers $8.50 - These were served cold and the meat was dry. I did like the garlic cream sauce so that saved this tapa even though I was disappointed with the cold meat.  Shrimp Ceviche $9.50 - The presentation wasn't all that but the taste was fresh, lemony, and delicious. I was surprised since it didn't look like it would have much flavor (see pic)  Tierra y Mar Skewers $11 - Thank you for serving up a nice piece of tender filet mignon as it should be. The shrimp and chorizo added a nice flavor to this skewer along with the salsa verde.  Apple & Manchego salad $6.50 - I love manchego cheese and apples but this salad definitely lacked flavor, nothing too special about. It was missing something but if you like manchego and apples that's exactly what this tapa is about.   Albondigas $7 - If you like Chef Boyardee then you will like these meatballs because that's exactly what they taste like. I wasn't too fond of the flavor and it was a disappointment.  They do serve complimentary garlic bread with a sweet almond butter. This was definitely addicting stuff! It was sooooo good we ordered another round.  My girlfriend ordered the Sangria and had to send it back because it was overly sweet. Our waiter was very kind about replacing her drink. So just FYI the sangria is pretty sweet!  Overall this place has reasonable prices but the tapas could be hit or miss. I'm glad I could check this place out!",

Sangria - No. Not strong enough, and way too little fruit flavor for a drink that claims to have been marinated for 3 days. Did feel like the pitcher was never-ending, just never-ending sugar juice.  Stuffed dates - No. Recommended by server. Tasted like BBQ sauce.  Stuffed peppers - No. I prefer the Peruvian version. This was a bit overly cheesy (and I love cheese).  Pulpo asado - Eh. I've had better.  Camarones a la diabla - No. Tasted Chinese, and not spicy at all.  Albondigas - Eh. 6 meatballs for $7. Could have had 3 In-N-Out cheeseburgers.  Lamb chops - Now we're talking. The 2 chops for $12 were very tender, and my favorite of the night (and I don't even eat lamb!).  Ambiance is not conducive to holding a conversation, anything romantic, or close to relaxing. It's probably easier to hold a conversation at Chinese dim sum restaurants than it is here, as noise is coming at you at all angles. I could barely hear my BF across the table. The only good thing was the service; my glass was always full!  Needless to say, I'll save my stomach space for Vegas meals elsewhere.",

Atmosphere - The atmosphere is really nice. Modern decor and dim lighting.   Service - We were greeted promptly and were seated within a couple of minutes. The servers were friendly and came by every so often to refill our waters and ask how the food was.  Food - Oh my god. Everything was so on point. We ordered a lot of food, but my favorites would have to be the Babyback ribs and the Apple and manchego salad. The salad was delicious; it had just the right amount of dressing to counter the sweetness of the apples. The ribs were also amazing! The meat was cooked perfectly and the sauce was drool-worthy. Everything was perfect. The portions are decently sized, allowing you to order a variety of tapas to try. And just to add on, the mixed paella was just as tasty. There was a perfect proportion of seafood, chicken, and rice. The flavors were incredible. I would highly recommend this place. Yum yum yum!",

They made me look so good on Saturday! Service was absolutely impeccable, thank you Ana and Neo!  All of my guests raved about the food and even drinks.  Lol seeing their faces when they found octopus in paella was priceless. Btw we ordered 4 course menu which started with bread and butter with olives, followed by stuffed dates ( the bomb!!!) and some kind of delicious meatball tapas. Garden salad was generously sprinkled with pine nuts, yum.  For entrees we had were ribeye( tender and delicious), roasted chicken and paella. Tres leches cake for dessert. All served family style  All of the above for $40 pp plus drinks, way below the banquet prices everyone else charges( by Vegas standards).  Highly recommend for events and will come back next time I am in Vegas",

The time provided was a little later than I wanted so I called the restaurant directly. The hostess hung up on me the first call. She flat out told me the second call that they weren't accepting any more reservations for the evening. I wish I'd gotten your name, love, because your hosting/customer service skills are lacking.  Er, okay. I logged back into Open Table and booked a table for 2 at 9pm no problem. Kind of made me wonder if they try to lighten up the later reservations so the host staff can get cut? Anyway, we arrived at nine on the dot. And we sat. For fifteen minutes. Staring at an empty two top. Which we were eventually seated at.  We had a server...who took our order and who we pretty much never saw again until we got the check. Odd, There was an \"assistant server\"...some young girl who seemed annoyed to be there. No smile, no initiative to refill my boyfriend's Sprite.   The food! The food! Good, great, awesome! (5/5)  The service (crying emoji face) Stop the madness. If management doesn't oversee this closely, they will crash and burn. Good food only carries you so far. Especially in a town with endless options.",

I would say this is the best low-key tapas spot in Vegas. And no, I am not including anything with an address on LVBLVD (read: low-key). The menu is reasonably priced for small-plates, and the waitstaff is both attentive and knowledgeable about their food and drinks. I especially love the dessert sampler, which comes with approximately 5-6 desserts for tasting (the Lemon-Berry tarte is my favorite!). In addition, the Firefly fries are delicious, I love the ceviche of shrimp, mushroom tart, and the Manchego mac'n' cheese is to die for! The fried calamari is also a win here.   I hope that you go, and experience the love of tapas that is Firefly. Yes, they had issues. Yes, those have been resolved.   Go. Love the tapas.",

We tried a couple mojitos (which I wish were on the all you can drink option menu!) and my favorite was my blood orange one. I tried the white house sangria and it was a little tart for me. The bartender was great and gave us suggestions on his favorite dishes on the menu. We ended up ordering solely off the regular menu instead of getting brunch and got the tuna tartare, the shrimp in garlic butter sauce, chicken tinga empanadas, and the filet/shrimp/chorizo skewers. While we waited, they brought out bread and butter and the butter was so amazing I could have just made a meal of the bread and butter. My boyfriend's favorite dish was the tuna, but mine was the shrimp - so flavorful. The empanadas were really good and I would get them again. I wasn't as big of a fan of the skewers, some of the meat was a little tough and the sauce wasn't my favorite. I will definitely make this a stop on our next trip!",

    "text": "Traditional tapas dishes with flamenco music and patio dining? Why didn't I come to Firefly sooner?!* Sampled several dishes, was mostly pleased with the flavors and quality. Servers are professional but are assigned far too many tables, and I imagine it only got worse- they were considerably busier by the time we left.  BOQUERONES ($7): 4  tasty toasts with a mix of compatible toppings including anchovies, avocado, roasted red peppers, and a lemony drizzle. Bright and fresh!  BEET SALAD ($7.50): roasted red and gold beets with vin-dressed greens and pecan crusted goat cheese. Definitely my kind of dish. STUFFED DATES ($6.5): wayyy too rich for me, but I can see why they're a favorite for others STUFFED PEPPERS ($8.5): piquillos with mozz and garlic cream cheese, in a tomato sauce with crispy fried and fresh green onions. Think of a classy version of jalapeno poppers, but with a different kind of pepper. Almost too cheesy for me, but good. PULPO ASADO ($10):  I didn't like this at all.  Potatoes and tomatoes were not enough to save the unappealing octopus. Menu claims it is grilled but seemed boiled or overcooked, unfavorable texture. ALBONDIGAS ($7): dish of mini meatballs in sherry sauce, basic but successful. MERGUEZ ($10): two links of spicy lamb sausage with a heap of roasted red peppers and two tiny slices of bread. Sausage and peppers had a good kick to them, but the lack of accompanying bread made it hard to enjoy this dish without chopping it up and rearranging like a stir fry.  Difficult to give a rating: I usually round down but this 3.5 is going up because I definitely want to come back for paella and sangria.   * Rhetorical question: their negative reputation precedes them, unfortunately. Lots of locals still associate the restaurant with their old (but serious) salmonella outbreak from 2013, but if you look up the stats on SNHD, they've received As on all inspections for nearly two years. It might be time to give them a try again.",

Their sangria is refreshing and cold on a hot day, with the ice that some reviewers complain about adding a bit of welcome hydration.  But one of the best reasons to come here is for the lovely shaded patio just off the Strip. For a city known for its great weather during much of the year, it's surprisingly difficult to find outdoor seating in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Oh, FireFly. How i love thee, let me count the ways!  Every time I decide to try a new restaurant in town, I almost immediately regret not going to my faithful FireFly.   I've been a regular for about a year now, and I'm never disappointed. I love the tapas style. Tapas meaning small plate, If you didn't already know that. It's great to share a few plates with a friend or scarf a few down all to yourself.   I'm a vegetarian but I have no problem with options here!  Some of my favorite plates include; -Apple and manchego salad- scrumptious and light  -Artichoke toasts- a delicious little snack  -Veggie Empanada- Pretty filling  -Warm spinach salad- healthy and yummy  And of course the Manchego Mac and Cheese if you can afford the calories!    Not to mention the pistachio gelato! To freakin die for.   As for drinks, the sangria's, both red and white are delicious.  My personal faves are \"The new girl\" a red vodka drink infused with a hint of jalapeno! Yum!  And the \"cherry mule\" a Moscow mule with cherry flavored  grey goose!   Ok, but MOST IMPORTANTLY.... The servers and bartenders.  Athena, Omar and Eduardo are so sweet and they always take such good care of me!  I love it when I walk in and they greet me like a friend, and then ask, \"your usual?\" Maybe it's because I come here too often, or maybe it's because they're great at serving their loyal customers!  Either way, I'll keep coming back!",

Obviously, the demand led them to a bigger space, which makes business sense.   We sat near the bar... they have TV's with sports on, which takes away from the experience in my opinion. Whenever I have had tapas, it's usually an intimate spot with your wine or sangria, your tapas, and your friends. This was almost like tapas in a sports bar!  As for the food, I can't find any reason to complain. I thought the bacon wrapped dates were pretty much dead on. I didn't expect the chicken salad to be as good as it was. The steak skewers were really good and also the empanadas hit the spot.   Although the setting may not be what it was it is nice to see the quality of the food to be where it always has been and that it didn't disappoint!",

Fantastic spot to check out hipsters, have a few shots, and a few more tapas, savory and sweet alike, as well as enjoy the beautiful decor and friendly staff.  Started off with Patron shots, then a pitcher of Sangria which was very refreshing then we moved on to tilapia sauteed in butter and wine, dates stuffed with goat cheese and wrapped in bacon, shrimp cocktail, Spanish albondigas, Angus sliders, ohh and so many other delicacies that I want to remember but it's been a month since I was there and my memory is a bit shot from the Patron but I promise, everything was excellent.

I enjoyed the flamenco paintings on the wall and the atmosphere afforded by pleasant waiters reminding me of southern Spain.  The tapas make me happy. The only thing I would add is some more architecture...as it is, the place is a bit too much of a strip mall in a desert city in the U.S.A..  It needs a bit more stone work, a tighter decor that makes you feel like you are in a tiny alley in a historic town in Andalucia.  Oh well, it's Las Vegas.  Go for the prices and you won't be disappointed by the food.    I guess the \"firefly\" lived up to it's name: the place needs to add some fly catchers on the front patio.  Another recommendation to improve this place would be a better beer list.  More microbrews from the United States would be a good addition to the Spanish wine drinks.",

We sat at the bar and had a couple cocktails until our table was ready and those cocktails were delicious. When we finally got our table our waitress was nice and explained the popular tapas dishes to us. We ordered based off of her suggestions. We were very happy with the food but we never really saw our waitress again until we had to ask for her so we could get our check. It was really busy and really loud. Don't come here if you are on a date because you can't really have an intimate conversation and aside from that the tables are so close together you are rubbing elbows with strangers. I'd definitely come here again, but maybe on a regular week night. If you come here, definitely order the popular dishes that they recommend and you won't be disappointed.",

It's a tapas place, so everything on the menu is a small portion, generally meant to be shared.  They all probably average around $6-9, with just a few topping the $10 mark.  Everything I tried was outstanding, and I'm looking forward to trying a bunch of new things next time.    The restaurant itself was clean, new, and very tastefully decorated.  And the service was outstanding.  We were there maybe 45 minutes, and had no less than three people (including what I assumed was the manager) make sure everything was to our liking.

The first Firefly we went to many years back was in downtown Vegas.  Although the seating was nothing special, the great view of the old casinos and the light show made for a very cool atmosphere.  The second Firefly we went to was at their PREVIOUS/smaller Paradise location.   That one had some cool seating with couches and what not, giving that a very cool atmosphere as well.  Suffice to say that when we were seated at their CURRENT Paradise location, it was a bit of a letdown.   The atmosphere is completely missing in this larger location of theirs on Paradise.   They tried to give it some atmosphere with the candles and red hue, but the space is just too big and open for sit down tables for that to work well.     The red pitchers of Sangria are still delicious and well worth the $28.       The tapas don't seem to stand out to me as they used to; they were all good, but nothing really stuck out as being delicious.

    "text": "One of our favorite restaurants. We left in 2008 and came back to more Firefly locations. We tried one of the new locations and hated it. We tried it again thinking it was a fluke and it was still terrible. Then the food poisoning happened. and while I would not wish that on any business, it has forced them to close the other locations and focus again on their main one.   This has allowed them to go back to doing what they did so well before. Although I wish they would bring out the bread, olives and honey almond butter like they used to. Now you have to ask for it. They have some new things on the menu now too like the Chicago beef sandwiches. Their flavors on that one are spot on. (I'm from Chicago, I can say that). The dates are to die for and   The things have have changed for the not so good are the mushroom tarts, filet sliders (now it's much cheaper meat) and ham and cheese croquets. Those are so bad that the inside is ground down to the consistency of baby food.   So it's all about knowing what to order.",

We ordered four tapas and the seafood paella and dessert with two drinks, bill for the four of us was just under $100. The atmosphere was beautiful with velvet walls, rich colors and original eclectic array of art. The food was fresh and we would have loved to come on Friday instead as I heard they have live music and dancing. Either way this place is a definite must when we are in Vegas again. Missing one star because our waiter/male was inattentive and unwelcoming, he was like, \"what do you want to eat\" and did not engage when asked questions about the menu, only really seen him during check time. Oh well, I will still come back as this was one of my better dining experience with food and value.",

    "text": "I absolutely love this place and I always come here. Whenever friends are in town or I am trying to impress a friend with a Vegas local hot spot, this is my go-to place.  My favorites include: Apple and manchego salad Tuna Tartare Stuffed Dates Scallop / Excargots Petite Filet Last time we visited we ventured out of the comfort zone and ordered some plates for the very first time. My new favorite is actually the Herb-roasted chicken. It is so juicy and flavorful. So many restaurants miss on chicken but this just hit the spot. It also comes with delicious crispy fries and it is very filling.  I was dreaming of their Paella since ordering in on my birthday in May and I ordered it again this time but something went terribly wrong. It was super salty and I could taste the rice distinctively as though it was not flavored well. I advised the waiter who alerted the chef. The manager was very kind. He came to our table and apologized and took the Paella off our bill. We would have loved to order one more but we had already waited 40 minutes for this one to cook and had a place to go after so we decided to pass. I love how they handled the situation. We are still loyal and will be back in the future for sure!  We also ordered their sangria pitcher and that was wonderful. It is very smooth and fruity, I think it is perfect for a light weight but only if you are sharing ;)  Overall, besides the wonderful food, the decor is beautiful with slight dim lighting. The noise level is a little higher if you sit inside but they also have outside seating with beautiful lights. It is all very fresh and exciting.",

    "text": "We haven't been to Firefly in awhile, but thought we would give the new location a try.  It is awesome!  They have made a few changes to the menu that are great.  Specifically, they have mini Italian Beef sandwiches Chicago style.  As a Chicago native, I thought they were spectacular.  The new restaurant is roomy and has great ambiance.  Our interest in Firefly definitely has been renewed and it will be back on the list of regular places we frequent.  Room for improvement: The service was a bit slow, especially since we went on a Friday night and the place was not packed.  We prefer to order a couple plates at a time. Though we told our waiter this, he was not very good at checking back regularly to see if we were ready to order more.  Also, something has to be done about the noise level.  I suspect that due to the low ceilings and type of flooring there is nothing to absorb the noise all the patrons make.  It was very difficult to carry on a conversation due to the loud crowd noise.  If the place was packed, it would have been unbearable.  I hope management will do something to help minimize.  If the noise issue is resolved I would give it a 5 star rating.  Overall: This is a must on any trip to Vegas.",

    "text": "WOWZA. Every time we come to Vegas, Firefly is our go-to dinner. I'd highly recommend coming here with a group of people, as it makes things more fun with getting to try a little of everything if everyone orders 2-3 tapas a piece. The pitchers of mojitos are a must. Some memorable items not to pass on include the bacon-wrapped dates, the calamari, and the shrimp ceviche. This time we went with the mixed paella, and it was enough to feed 4 people although there were only two of us. The service here is outstanding every time we come. From what I heard this last year was hard for Firefly because of a salmonella issue and scared off a lot of customers. As a veteran industry worker, this was sad to hear, but it happens to everyone, and I can't give enough kudos to the Firefly owner for stepping it up and resolving the issues immediately and moving forward. If I could offer any advice to the restaurant from a customer who just dined at the new location for the first time it would be that my experience was less intimate than at the older location. There is too much bright light in the building, and that needs to be addressed. A big part of why we come is for the intimate low-lit vibe with some gypsy kings on the loudspeaker. This time I was sitting next to the kitchen with a spot-light on me listening to top-40. Still giving you 5 stars because I'm a die-hard fan of the food and service. Get the ambience back and I'll be a lifer.",

The only set back was that it gets a little loud, and the seating doesn't allow you to sit closely to your date. So, I had to cup my ears to listen to my wife tell me how her day was. Probably better for a social night out, than a date place.  I am looking forward to returning soon.",

The Chapel went faster then we thought it would and our reservations weren't until 7:00pm and we were done by 6pm!  With 30 people standing around I called Firefly and they were SO accommodating to see if we could get in early!  We got there at 615pm and the room wasn't quite ready but no worries, we all went into the bar area and ordered a drink.  About 15 minutes later we were ushered into a really cute room with a long table and then drink orders were taken and then appetizers started to flow!  We did the multi-course sit down for 30 people ($35 a head) and a two hour open bar.  The food was SO good and I'd never been here before, was totally off of the Yelp reviews that I picked this place!  The manager and our coordinator were amazing, always ensuring we were happy and that everyone always had a full drink and food in front of them.  I guess the only thing I could say is that I wish the glass door to the room stayed closed, it got a little loud, and my dad was having a hard time hearing, but that would be THE only thing I could say!  This place has amazing service, awesome food and wonderful people working here!  Next time we are in Vegas we will be back.............with less people but we'll be there!!!!  THANK YOU SO MUCH FIREFLY!",

    "text": "Well we saw the good reviews on yelp so we decided to try it out. I have to say, I really enjoyed the place. We made reservations for 5:30pm on a Wednesday. I know it was early, but I like to eat an early dinner. This was a birthday also for my friend so this is where we went. When you pull in the parking lot, there is some street work going on and the parking lot seems plain. Most of the parking is in the back. Not really impressive looking. But when you walk in the front door, it is like an oasis. Beautiful inside. VERY nice. I had checked the menu ahead of time and about the last 50 Yelp reviews so I had written down the accumulation of the six most recommended food items. You will need about 3 items each for a man my size (6'1 225 lbs). My friend got a red wine sangria, which I tasted, it was VERY good. I'm not a wine drinker either. I'd probably get the sparkling sangria next time. I got the strawberry mojito. Good but too sweet to have with dinner.  We got and shared the: Bacon wrapped stuffed dates. Everybody says to get these. These and the sangria were probably the most listed items on the prior 50 Yelp reviews. I didn't see it. They were ok, but not to die for. Would I eat them again? Oh yeah. Would I order them again? No.  The petit filet. This was the most expensive item at $12.50 and a very small piece, but very good piece of filet. It sat on a bed of tomatoes and spinach and diced potatoes that was very good. Wouldn't get it again as money can be better spent. Chorizo and chicken stuffed mushrooms topped with melted cheese. Yummo! I would get this again. I am half Mexican though so I may like chorizo more than most. The scallops escargot. There are NO snails in this, just made with garlic and butter. You get 6 decent size scallops cooked to perfection. I would totally get these again. Gotta try these. Camarones a la diabla. Fantastic! The best thing we had. Decent size shrimp, cooked perfectly, in a sauce that is hot, but not too hot, and sweet also. The sauce is so good that you want to dip the bread they give you into any remaining sauce. Five shrimp came in a serving.  Tierra y mar skewers. These are skewers that are maybe $8.50. So $4 cheaper than the petit filet. On each skewer is a chunk of filet, a shrimp, a chunk of tomato and a piece of chorizo. You get three skewers and if you combine the amount of filet on each skewer you get more on the skewers than in the petit filet. So get this instead of the petit filet and save.  We both had the chocolate and cherry bread pudding for dessert. We could have shared one dessert but weren't sure how big it was. It was a big serving of bread pudding and a rather large scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. No bourbon sauce. But like I said, even if there are three of you, just share one as you will already be full. If it is not someone's birthday, I'd just skip the dessert. My TIPS: Ask for Alejandro, as he was a superb server. He was always around if you needed him, but never a bother.  TIP 2: order all items at once as they bring them out as they get cooked. Ours were staggered and since they are small plates, the most we had at once at the table were two items out of 6.  TIP 3: get the tierra y mar skewers instead of petit filet. TIP 4: get the sangria. It really is that good.  TIP 5: Make a reservation. We got there at 5:20pm on a Wednesday. Maybe 1/4 full at most. By 5:45pm it was 3/4 full and by 6pm it was completely full. On a Wednesday. It's a nice place and worth it. We were dressed fine and we were in shorts and Hawaaian shirts. Our bill with two drinks each and 6 Tapas and two desserts was $86.75 and with tip $102. If you cut out the desserts, that would be $17 less after tax and tip. Which would bring the bill down to $85 for two. Of course if you drink water instead of the 4 alcoholic drinks, that would save a lot more, maybe $30 more when you think about the tax and tip.... but I want the two drinks. hehe.",

We had two birthday boys with us, and the restaurant treated us with a few pitchers of sangrias, two birthday shots, and two tshirts for the birthday boys.

That being said, I have a particular fondness to the tuna tartare, tuna skewers, tres leches cake, and especially the chocolate cherry bread pudding (warm with a generous serving of ice cream on the top).   The ambiance is really lovely as well. You wouldn't be out of place dressed up or down (as with most LV places). Prices are very reasonable. I think each individual plate is good for two people to share and feel satisfied with the amount tasted. If you have three or more, you might want to order doubles of some plates to make sure everyone gets a decent amount. The two of us order four to five plates, plus one dessert (and you get some delicious free bread), and leave feeling well-satisfied.",

I called ahead for reservations as well as to notify them that we would need a gluten free menu as my sister is highly allergic and is on medications. They assured me there wouldn't be a problem with this as they have a full vegan/gluten free menu. As we sat down, they forgot to bring us this Menu as previously requested over the phone so we had to call her back, no big deal we thought. We placed our orders, and I do admit we placed them at different times as we were a bit all over the place with our menus'. Once my sister's order came, she seemed concerned and was sure her dish was not gluten free. We asked the waiter, he said, \"No, it's not gluten free, its not in that menu\" as he rolled his eyes at us. We were confused as we made sure to only order from that menu for her. We asked for it to be taken back and asked for the menu again to see if we wanted to order something else, but at that point we were more worried that she would have an allergic reaction and decided to stick with drinks. They did remove 1 of my drinks from the bill as well as my sisters untouched cod (and made it seem as they were doing us a favor by removing it from our bill). Out of everything the Hostess provided us with a good attitude over the whole experience, can't say the same for one of male waiters, the other guy was pleasant though. We don't expect anyone to kiss our ass or anything like that, but if we took the time to call ahead and let you know of severe allergies as well as specified there no less then 3 times once we arrived, then we would appreciate if you don't give us attitude if we had to send untouched food back when you messed up our order.",

Parking was easy to find there's a medium lot in the back of the restaurant. The interior has a clean and modern night club type feel. We arrived at 6:45pm and was seated right away in a booth.   We ordered the stuffed dates, padron peppers, boquerones, petite filet, merguez (lamb sausage), and chicken paella. The only underwhelming dish was the peppers I would skip those the next time. But please do yourself a favor and get the petite filet! It was super flavorful and perfectly medium rare. I've had a lot of stuffed dates but this one was one of the best I've had. The paella is AMAZING. Perfectly cooked and not too salty. Chicken can be tough if cooked for too long but this chicken in the paella was tender and juicy. For dessert we ordered the cheesecake and flan. They're both good but the star of the dessert was the little cookie that came with the flan! They should have a dish with a bunch of those little cookies. On a side note we ordered a pitcher of red wine sangria to share. Delicious and smooth! You can't go wrong with the drinks here either.   Definitely try this place out when you're in Vegas! It's a little off strip but it's so worth it. Didn't feel overly crowded and the food was amazing. Looking forward to trying this place again.",

The camarones aljillo, tuna tartare (with taro chips), shrimp ceviche, steak and mushroom skewers MUST TRY THESE), and any of their empanadas are always what I order right away. Did I also mention they have bacon wrapped dates? Try them. They sound weird, but so worth it.  If the party being seated to eat is more than 6 people, gratuity is already included in bill.   I come to Firefly at least once a month and I can honestly say, despite it's salmonella outbreak a few years back, I'm still a loyal food-goer and will always be willing to throw some dollars on their pitchers of sangria!",

    "text": "My wife and had dinner rather late around 10pm and it was maybe 50 % occupied. We ordered the combo paella first because it takes about 40 to 50 minutes. We had the patatas brava and wasn't to impressed by it the potatoes were not crispy my daughter had this in Barcelona and it was not up to par and we also had the huevos estrellados which is similar to the braves but with a fried egg and chorizo.  I was waiting for the server to mention that I had  2 potato dishes but he said nothing and it was a little better but I have to say that both potato dishes seemed like they sat around for awhile. Someplace place use the 2 fry method to crisp them up but it seems like over fried once trying crisp them but it was not.  Then we had octopus(pulpo Saadi)was really good and tender.  Next came the warm Spinach salad and it's just okay.    The ipaella finally showed up and it was okay but not prepared properly it had no socarrat at the bottom of the pan which I was looking for; the flavor was rather muted.  We had dessert the cherry bread pudding and flan.   The bread could have more edge it lacked any cherry flavor but the flan was one the best I had in flavor and texture not heavy or aerated it was perfect.",

Always go with the Firefly fries, stuffed dates, and the chicken skewers. They have the best stuffed dates I've ever had, and the chicken skewers always have different seasonal veggies every time I go. Last time I went they had brussel sprouts. Firefly also has some of the best bread! It's a sliced garlic bread with AMAZING almond and chipotle butter I think.   This is a great place for a late night dinner with friends, my friends are always reluctant to go but by the end of our meal they rave! They have a fun photo booth too so you can commemorate your awesome dinner.",

I had the shrimp ceviche extremely generous amount of shrimp considering the price and very fresh and tastey. For our meal we decided on seafood paella.  Honestly I've had better. The seafood portion was on the light side and so there was a lot of rice.  Wouldn't have minded increased muscles and clams and shrimp for a higher price tag.  Flavor was solid but just lacked the natural magic that comes together with cooked to order paella.",

We sat outside where a guy was playing the bongos to a DJ. Different, but cool.   Our server was great as was everyone else who was helping.   The food was incredible. We wanted so many things and couldn't decide, so we ended up getting way too much! Next time, I would order one thing at a time so I don't get as full. However, the online menu said that brunch came with two sides and the menu contradicted that, so I assumed the portions were small. Regardless, we loved everything we ordered!!",

Every single dish we got was very very good. Complex flavors, not something you normally find at a place with good reviews, strangely.

Ok, I got this.  The reviews were, in the words of Vin Scully, \"remarkable\".  Two $$. Good looking pictures (food porn).  Easy to make reservations for a party of eight.  My wife and I were the first to arrive and we had the choice of inside or outside.  The bar area is gorgeous, the inside had cool music and a classy vibe but the patio was perfect for us.  We are a loud group so we wanted to feel more comfortable.  Red and white lights above us on the canvas patio cover.  Very simple, kind of cool.  Service was prompt and efficient.  The tapas were amazing.  Top picks were the hot cheese dishes with chorizo, bacon wrapped dates and tuna tartare.  The highlight was the paella.  We had one with seafood and another with chicken and mushroom.  Killer dishes.  3 pitchers of different sangria so made us all fuzzy and happy.  The desserts were plentiful and the banana Nutella dish was a standout dish.  In truth, I was pretty buzzed to remember too much but all of my friends had a great time.  About $40 per head including booze, tax and tip.  Winner winner tasty dinner.",

    "text": "I've had Firefly bookmarked for some time now and I was finally able to check it out this past weekend for my Birthday.  I made a reservation for 8 people and when we got there, we were seated right away. Although, I would have preferred to be seated in the main dinning room, we were sat in the room adjacent to the bar. Our server greeted us right away and offered up his suggestions on drinks. We opted for the pitcher of Watermelon Mojitos. It was so refreshing and tasted great!  We knew that we wanted to try the Mixed Paella so we put in an order right away since it takes about 40 min to make.   Here's a breakdown of what our table ordered:  Mixed Paella  Chorizo Plate  Serrano Ham & Manchego Cheese  Stuffed Dates  Camarones a la Diabla  Chicken & Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms  Babyback Ribs   Chicken Tinga Empanandas  Stuffed Peppers  Tierra y Mar Skewers  Everything tasted amazing but my top 3 favorite dishes of the night hands down had to be the Stuffed Dates, Mixed Paella & Camarones a la Diabla! The stuffed dates were so good, we ended up ordering 2 more orders of them! We just couldn't get enough of their goodness!   Only complaint of the night was that the room we were seated in was extremely hot. It started to get uncomfortable in there.   All in all, I would highly recommend dining at Firefly next time you are in the Las Vegas area. You will not be disappointed!",

We ordered: 5/5 - Camarones a la diabla (shrimp with firely sweet and spicy sauce)  $10 5/5 - Grilled Scallops $12 4.5/5 - Steamed mussels $9.50 3/5 - Seafood paella $20 45 min. wait so order in advance 5/5 - Large Salad $12  The shrimp and scallops were absolutely flavorful and cooked to perfection.  Even the salad with sun dried tomatoes and roasted peppers was absolutely delicious!   Since this is a Spanish tapas restaurant, we decided to try their seafood paella. The paella takes 45 minutes to prepare and for most people, that's not a long wait since the times goes by fairly quickly when people are talking and sampling tapas. Nevertheless, it wasn't very authentic so will skip that next time around.  Great service and lively atmosphere. Will definitely return!",

They also passed artichoke crostini and tomato chutney toast. It was all amazing! My favorite was the dates stuffed with an almond, rolled in bacon and cooked with a red wine reduction, melted in my mouth with a little crunch from the almond. I would recommend this place to anyone. Exceptional for sharing as the plates are all served tapas style.",

We were able to order a wide variety of things and nothing had let me down.

I have to think the alcohol is definitely factoring in to what a great experience I had, but honestly the food was great and our servers (we had two) were AMAZING!! I would go back just for the service alone as they were attentive and went above and beyond to keep our party of 9 happy.    Food - like I said it was all you could eat tapas and desserts for us, and a table of 9 girls, yep we pretty much had it all.... and managed to hand the plates around as if they were big enough to be family style.   I loved the bacon wrapped dates, the octopus, the apple salad, the tuna tartare, the empanadas, and the dessert platter. You can probably skip the mussels, the chick peas in shells (these were actually good, but not worth the mess or effort to eat), the shrimp diabla, and the steak skewers....  trust me we ate many more than this, but these stick out as the best and the worst.  Drinks - the mojitos were ok, not as flavorful as I would have liked, but it was all you could drink and really I wasn't complaining. The sangria was strong, maybe too strong, and then others in our group ordered wine and beer.    Service - again, sooooo good!! Our waitress took the time to get the bachelorette a candle and sing a made up bachelorette song to her as though it was her birthday... she didn't think the bachelorette looked happy enough so she kept going above and beyond with little details to make our night that much better.    Atmosphere - loud, like really loud, and I'm sure our table wasn't helping... definitely not a romantic tapas spot I'd want to go to with the bf, but perfect for our kind of evening.",

Let me preface my comments by saying that I have lived in Spain and frequented many tapas bars there and in southern California, where I live. The prices are very reasonable. Comparable dishes at other places would cost the same or more in California. The portion of Serrano ham is very generous and delicious. I got my food quickly. Both items are beautifully presented and tasty. I will definitely come back. They have ample parking that's free. They have an extensive wine selection.",

Just like the other location the sangria is good, service is friendly and although this place is bigger than the Sahara location there's still a lack of space to move around.  They have a large patio which I can see could be nice to dine on if the weather is  nice but the problem is that Vegas usually has very extreme weather, either too hot or too cold and appropriate weather days are far and few between. Latin nights would have been so much nicer if there were misters on the patio at least or if they held the event indoors. Everyone was complaining about the heat ALL NIGHT and most people had to dance one song and sit out for five to \"cool off\" in the 100 degree temperature. Heat + Sangria + sweating due to dancing = super dehydration and hang over and feeling that I shouldn't go out Friday nights ever again lol   Also I didn't know that there's an automatic 18% gratuity on drinks for a reservation. Not that we weren't going to tip but that was just a tad odd. I thought that was just for food. Just FYI so you won't be caught off guard!   And yes after all that complaining I still give them four stars bc I think under the right conditions this could be an amazing venue.",

    "text": "This is one of our regular go to spots when we are in Vegas. It is stylish, and even though they say they're Spanish, it is more Latin American Fusion food. The service is on point and the prices are not bad for what you are getting. The Sangria is amazing, and the Tuna Tartar is one the best I have tasted. The Paella is good also, but you really need to make up your mind on that one as soon as you hit the door, since they make it fresh it takes about 20 minutes from order to your table. Will we go back yes!",

Alright, now that I've gotten that off my chest, onto the review!  Firefly is awesome. Period. We piled up plate upon plate of dishes, each one more delicious than the one before. Instead of eating some overpriced frou frou garbage on the Strip or succumbing to your newfound poverty and eating 99c hotdogs, please get in a cab or car or whatever and head to Firefly.  There's something for everyone. You like to kill and consume four-legged animals that run through the plains? They got it. Perhaps you're more of a follower of Poseidon and it's swimming creatures that get your tummy rumbling. You're covered there as well.  On the real real, I'd probably drive back Vegas on the stupid I-15 just to eat here again.",

Even if i ask what you perceive to be a stupid question. ..you should still be pleasant in your response. Since i hadn't been to the new location,  and the lighting is dark the place looked closed, and the valets were just setting up their stand, so i asked if the bar was open. Response with tude was \"i guess, it should  be\". Anyway, didn't eat,  just stopped by for drink and see the decor. Good for drinks. And self park your car!!",

    "text": "I cannot say enough about how great Firefly was. The menu was extensive, prices were great, and serving sizes were much bigger than I'm used to at tapas restaurants. What really made this worth five stars, however, was the excellent, excellent service. I went with two friends, one who has an extreme shellfish allergy. We called ahead of time, just to make sure it wouldn't be an issue (she knows not to order shellfish, of course, but kitchen cross-contamination can be deadly). We were told they could accommodate this food allergy, just to let our server know when we got there. Apparently, unbeknownst to us, they also flagged the reservation. So immediately after we were seated, Carlos, a manager, came to our table, acknowledged the allergy, and let us know we would be taken care of. The cleared out one fryer to only fry non-shellfish items for the evening, offered the best suggestions, and even put up with the additional issue that I'm a vegetarian. (Note: they have a separate vegetarian menu with only non-meat choices!) The sangria and mojitos were flowing, the food was great, and my friend was able to enjoy the meal without worry. Fantastic all the way around. This was, by far, our best food experience in Vegas, and we tried the gamut during our four days there!",

    "text": "Food was great, drinks were great.  Too bad they don't understand how to run a business.  I purchased this Groupon for use on a Friday night while visiting Las Vegas.  I called first, because I read the restriction about only being able to use from 5:00 - 6:30 for dinner, and reservations being required.  The person I spoke with was really short with me, didn't really understand my question about \"having a groupon and needing a reservation during that window, etc.\".  She told me to just come right over, because they weren't busy and there was no wait.  When we got there, approximately an hour later, it was 6:15.  I know this, because we had told friends we would meet them there at 6:00 and I was upset with my husband because we were 15 mins late.  By the time we got sat and had ordered our drinks, it was probably 6:30.  We had a party of 8, and spent almost $300 and 1.5 hours there.  When I presented the Groupon, the waiter told me it was only valid from 5:00 to 6:30.  I explained that I had read the fine print, had called for a reservation, was told it was unnecessary, and was still seated by 6:30, regardless.  He persisted in saying that he understood, but still couldn't honor it, but i was welcomed to use it on a different night.  When I explained that we were in from out of town and had purchased it specifically to use that evening and asked him if he could let me talk with a manager, he said he would certainly check with the manager and explain my dilemma.  He came back a couple minutes later and told me that \"the manager was sorry, but they couldn't accept it, and since I was from out of town, I was welcomed to call Groupon and request a refund\".  Really?  I'm not a cheap skate.  In fact, I'm the opposite.  The measly Groupon amounted to a $17 discount on a $240 check, upon which I left a $50 tip.  I really don't care about the $17 but I do feel a little scammed for being lured into their business, bringing 7 other people with me (2 of which live in Las Vegas) only to be treated like dirt.  Worse than that, I hate that the employees at Firefly, clearly don't understand that the value in advertising is in bringing new customers into your business and keeping them coming back, not to bait and switch them, thus ensuring they will never visit again.  And, sadly, had the manager come over and spoken to me, I could have shared this feedback with him, rather than airing my grudge on Yelp.  Fail, Firefly.  Fail.",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite places to eat... food is great!! But the service was not so great.  We arrived on a monday night around 10:20pm the place was empty.  At this time we were the only ones who sat inside the restaurant.  Our server was Jesus (tall, skinny gentleman)  He greeted us with a smile, but throughout our visit.  We felt rushed when it came to ordering as if he didn't have time to be waiting on us.  I felt there were other workers in the restaurant that took care of us more than the server.  When it came time to pay the bill, we paid in cash and Jesus said he would be back with the change.  We waited, but all we saw was Jesus walking past us from the kitchen to the bar to his outside tables; He did not bother to look at us or come back to the table.  We flagged him down once we saw that he was not going to come back, only then did he say \"Did you want your change?\" without us having to say anything.  I will say we did not leave a good tip due to our experience.  We thought if was very rude of him to expect he deserved that tip.. We are very generous tippers but we tip based on the overall experience.  Because of that his tip went down further but it was never because of the fact that we are cheap.  We understand that people work for their tips and that is part of their income; but I also believe in excellent customer service wherever I go.  Because I love the food, i would order to go instead of dining in",
