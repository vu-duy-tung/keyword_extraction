    "text": "I love pampas!  I decided to make reservations here for my BF's birthday, as it came recommended by many. As we walked in, we were immediately greeted by the host. She was nice and took us to our table right away. I've never been to a Brazilian steakhouse, so I was really excited to try their unlimited meat rodizio and side salad bar.   My favorite of the meat rodizio is hands down the top sirloin! It's soo delicious and I like my meat medium rare, it was perfection! All the other meat were good too, but that one stood out to me. There are so many options available, &  I really love the red/green side of the card so the servers know when to come or not to your table.   The side salad bar has many options as well, ranging from; salads, salad toppings, veggies, mashed potatoes, salami and cheese! I couldn't help but go at least twice to the salad bar. Although, I didn't want to fill up too much on side items as the meat rodizio was unlimited. I wanted to make sure I tried everything including the chicken hearts. You just have to order it with your server because they don't walk around with the chicken hearts, must not be very popular?   Food is nothing short of amazing. Service was great too, our server was very attentive. We both left full and happy. Come hungry, you'll want to get your moneys worth =P",

    "text": "Food was good but the THIEF of a waitress ruined the experience! So my family from Mexico is in town and they are staying at the planet Hollywood . They had show tickets that came with a dinner to Pampas and invited me to join. We were a large group of 19 and she gave us great service she was really nice and helpful even though most of my family didn't speak English. The guys serving meat were great as well. The problem started at the conclusion of our meal when Amber our server brought the check. She wrote on the receipt that we had to pay 25% gratuity? I've never heard of that and I felt like she was trying to take advantage of people who didn't know or maybe spoke another language. I told my aunt and uncle not to pay that and to ask for the manager but they didn't want to cause a scene and they simply paid it to avoid conflict. I work in the industry and know there is no such thing as 25% auto grat! I also know that you don't write the percentage down on paper it always says it in print from a computer. She is stealing from the customers point blank period! Management needs to investigate this THIEF because I'm sure we aren't the only ones who were being effected by her. I will never go back to this place and I won't recommend it and it's sad because the food and experience was good up until the end.",

I suppose you could just do the buffet and be okay, but the grilled meats are very poorly prepared, and very low quality.  The waiter was very good, and trying his best, but after we spoke to the manager who removed the $10 upgrade from our meal (was included in our vacation package), he whispered to us, \"I totally agree with you!\"  Why else would they need 2-for-1 coupons and groupons to get people there?  With so many better options on the Strip, there is no need for this place to exist, or for you to eat there.  Avoid!!!!",

    "text": "What an awful dining experience. As a Brazilian, used to going to this kind of restaurant my whole life, I don't think I've ever felt so uncomfortable and disappointed seating on a dining table before. We were hungry, looking forward to the yummy recipes of Brazilian cuisine and it was Vegas for Christ's sake! We made reservations for New Years Day at 10PM. Got there and were seated right away. Within minutes, the waiter comes to our table and takes our drink order. We had a voucher and were immediately told what we could and could not eat (no steaks or seafoods). He also said that we had 15 minutes to eat because the kitchen was closing soon (this was never said when we made the reservation for 10PM).   When telling him that I'd like to upgrade and eat all that i wanted, he didn't know what to answer but stuck with \"you can't\". I found that odd. I was willing to pay whatever it took to eat what they offered (premium meats and seafood), so I felt disappointed with it. Out of the 15 minute deadline he gave us to eat, 10 minutes went by and no meat was brought to our table (waiters were walking right by with the meat skewers to another section of the restaurant). I decided to inquire about it with the manager at the time. I explained to her that we were given 15 minutes to eat but still haven't gotten any meat at our table. She was surprised of such deadline given by our waiter, and worked on getting meat on our table. She said we could eat as much as we want, no hurry. She was nice and tried to take care of everything.  When the meat finally made it to our table (chicken thighs, breast, top sirloin, etc..), the quality was pretty bad. Dry, blend, as if it had been reheated a few times. We tried a couple bites and left the rest on the plates. I went on to try all other cuts of meat, but the quality was consistent throughout. I figured I'd cancel the seafood upgrade as I expected it would be just as bad. The salad bar was good, and that was mostly what we ate (and the cheese breads, those were yummy. But I can make those at home lol). To those who don't know, the main feature of Brazilian steak houses, is the constant flow of different cuts and types of meat that are brought to the tables. Unfortunately, that night, we didn't enjoy that.  The service was regretful the entire night. Our waiter offered to take our plates several times when we were still obviously working on it. He seemed untrained and not too professional. He even took a bite (with his hands) from something in the salad bar as he was walking away from us. Probably thought no one would see it. lol Then wandered around the restaurant chewing what he ate. He also made a plate for himself in the middle of service. Haha.  We wondered if that was just a regular evening of service there, or if it was just due to us having a voucher. We will never know because we are never  going back. Lol If we knew that one of our vacation dinner experiences would be so miserable, we would have definitely chosen somewhere else to eat, with voucher or not. After all, the best restaurants in the world are in Vegas. And apparently, the worst.",

The meat is low quality and your stomach will hate you. We waited for over 45 minutes just for water! The server got mad and actually complained to host for sitting 3 parties in his section at the same time (this was being discussed right at our table over our heads). It was not a pleasant experience and with as much talent as Vegas has this is a total waste of your money and time!",

Even the pineapple was very dry.  I'll never go back there again, let alone, never buy a Dinner-Show tickets anywhere. Wendy's burger wound have bin a lot tastier and meat hot and juicy.  I paid wayyy toooo much money for the dinner and what a total disaster, disappointment and sad experience that was. Even the plastic water glass was dirty, imagine that?  They paint-brush oil into the outside of the meat to make it look good before the servers walk around with it, but inside, even the pork, steak, sausage wrapped in bacon, etc, etc were all awful dry.  A total waste of $$$. The show was good however.  Ain't gong back there ever again. If this YELP site had a ( - ) minus it would have been -5.. yup, minus five. maybe YELP if you're there, add the (- minus 1 to 5 also) in this rating system.  1 star does not do the justice.",

    "text": "Since the kids are on spring break at grandma's this week, me and the husband are also on spring break. And although we have to work during our spring break, we decided, to do something completely different and fun for our Tuesday night dinner, something we can't ever do with the kids. We became tourists in our own town with dinner and a show. We scored 8:30 pm tickets to Zombie Burlesque through <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FVegas.com&s=815df335831efd1e460521ad580e06c20729c8d21a1b3ec4986fca500635ab53\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vegas.com</a> which offered dinner at either Pampas Churrascaria or the Italian restaurant across from the V theater where the show would be. I went on Yelp beforehand of course, and read the unimpressive reviews of Pampas. We briefly considered the Italian place, but because we're living dangerously and hadn't done Brazilian in a long time, we thought we would give it a try, Yelp reviews be damned.   Well the rating lived up to its hype, or rather non-hype. For us, we believe the worst part was the pokey service. When we finally did get a server to acknowledge us, we then had to go over the fine print of what the show tickets included in terms of the dinner. We would only get a choice of an entree: beef, chicken or fish which came with run of the mill sides. And the only alcohol included was the sangria, house beer, and their cocktail concoction, which I can't remember what it's called, but, looked completely labor intensive for the gal making it. We upgraded to the buffet for $10 more and the $20 per person alcohol ticket for an hour of well drinks. Fuck it! We're on spring break.   The buffet was decent. It offered an array of cheese, veggies and other sides. The meat merry-go-round was just okay. The tri-tip piece that I had was dry, which made it difficult for me to cut into. My husband appeared to have received a juicer piece of tri and he still had issues cutting the meat. His contribution to this review is simply: this place needs sharper knives to cut the meat.  So yeah, I got nothing else. This place is just adequate and tailored to the tourists. If you're in Vegas as a tourist, you don't generally come for the food. You come to gamble, see the shows and drink yourself stupid. If you're looking for a really good Brazilian place, this place isn't it. But if you're looking for a last minute dinner and show, this will do okay.",

There was a guy outside handing out $15 off coupons for the buffet option, and although I didn't want the buffet, the man told us I could order something a la carte and that I'd be able to share with my boyfriend if he did the buffet option, so we agreed to give it a shot.  After the waiter had seated us, he then proceeds to tell my boyfriend that in order to activate the coupon, he needs to order a cocktail first....then he tells us that there's an additional charge for WATER!! Halfway through our meal, our waiter comes by and yells at us because I was eating a few spoonfuls of mashed potatoes off of my boyfriend's plate, and threatens to charge us for an additional buffet fee since I was not allowed to do this (even though he neglected to mention this when we sat down; and we had even specifically mentioned to him that we had never been to a brazilian steakhouse buffet before).  After making a scene in front of everyone sitting near us, the waiter hesitantly agreed not to charge extra for the additional buffet fee after we asked to speak with the manager... We had both pretty much lost our appetites at this point and asked for the check (which the waiter makes you pay for right in front of him so he can see how much you're tipping, which in turn made things pretty awkward for us after such a terrible experience).  NEVER GOING BACK TO THIS PLACE EVER AGAIN!",

It has much of the same items at the buffet but the meat selections seemed fewer. What we did have was very good from the prime rib to the bacon wrapped chicken. Save room for dessert - the chocolate mousse on top of a chocolate brownie (super moist) was truly decadent. We tried to finish it because it was just that good, but we were too stuffed.",

    "text": "We received a promotional gift card to check out Pampas during our most recent trip to Vegas.  My stepdad wasn't feeling very hungry that day and opted to do the salad bar only meal.  He was very pleased with the options.   My cousins didn't have the same promotional card as us, but they were offered a discount at the door for I think around $18.50 per person for lunch! We found it to be a very good deal.  They had around cuts of meat for lunch and kept them coming.  Be sure to be vocal about how you like meat prepared. Some of the slices offered at first were to well done for my liking.  The only thing keeping this from being 5 star for me is the pineapple offering. I'm used to the grilled pineapple covered in cinnamon and sugar.  The pineapple served here was not coated before grilling, which in our opinion paled in comparison to the other preparation.  All in all, for the lunch price we'd certainly visit again!",

    "text": "Okay, for those reading my review. Hello. Buy a TravelZoo voucher before dining. Trust me, our original bill was over $270 but with a TravelZoo voucher, there was a discount of $209 dollars. Total paid: $73.30, tip not included.   Check in with Yelp for a Caiparinha/alcoholic drink. Our server, Mindy was phenomenal. She recommended white sangria (part of the voucher deal) and we readily agreed. All four of us got an alcoholic drink but when we took the first sip, our eyes bulged. Maybe we're just lightweights (probably) but the drinks were way too strong. Mindy came by later and noticed the drinks were still full, she asked what was wrong. We explained and she collected our drinks and promised they would be remade. True to her words, she came back with the new drinks and yup, us weak Asians could finally drink our Caiparinhas now.   FOOD:   There is an unlimited sides buffet. It was filled with cheeses, beans, salads and beets, cheese rolls and a variety of pasta. Also pulled pork (a must!) and mashed potatoes.   With Brazilian steakhouses, you sit and wait for servers carrying meat chunks to come to your table and carve you a slice. You'll use your tongs to grab the pieces. There is a little circular paper on your table. When you want meat to continue coming to your table, keep it on the green side. When you are done, flip it to the red side. Keep it where the servers can see it. Meats that came to our table were picanha, sirloin, lamb, pork shoulder, bacon-wrapped chicken, and sausages. Pineapples were also making the rounds. Meats are salty and for the most part, tough and dry. I ended up being more satisfied with the pulled pork from the sides buffet.   Overall, I would not pay full price for this. My main gripe was that we asked for a water refill 3 times and didn't get it until we were done with our meat selection. By then, we were really thirsty and feeling dizzy from sodium overload. But otherwise, good experience. The stars are for the side buffet, the meat servers and for Mindy.   Notes:  -Buy a voucher! -Make a reservation, we left at 8:30 and there were crowds of people waiting  -WATER IS $1 PER PERSON  -Ask to be seated in Mindy's section!",

    "text": "My companion and I came into Pampas 1/3/2019 with a comp from the timeshare presentation. Pri was our server, she did tell us about the upgrade for $10 extra but since we weren't that hungry we wanted to save room for desert, so we ordered soft drinks. We noticed some of the cocktails and wanted to order cocktails but Pri never came back to our table to check on us, she never checked to see if we needed refills on our sodas or anything for that matter. We wanted desert which was never offered she just automatically told us she was bringing us our check, which took 15 minutes to get. As she brung us the check I asked her what was her name and she told me Pri and noticed I was doing Yelp. Then she began to say I hope it's not bad, so I began to tell her how she made us feel, it was like because we had the comp we were a waste of space in her section. The little signage on the table was like a signal to the rest of the staff to stay clear. The woman who was taking pictures walked past our table twice and asked everyone else except us did they want pictures taken. Pri tried to offer to pay for desert for us to keep me from putting this experience on Yelp, I told her I didn't want anything free, all I wanted was service. It angered me that she thought that buying desert was gonna make my experience go away. I told her that you trying to give me something free is sweeping the experience under the rug and that it's not about getting something free it's about getting her fixed. Somewhere she was failed by management, cause if she thought that level of service was ok then something is seriously wrong or no one cares. I let her know that I'm in the service industry and your suppose to treat everyone the same regardless of a comp check or not. I totally get it, servers most likely don't make money on those comp tables and this was the very reason I wanted to save room for desert and order cocktails to bring a check average up so she could have gotten a tip on her service and so that we're not gonna be a waste of space in her section BUT she never came back. She kept insisting on buying this desert and I told her you just need to treat people the same cause you never know who's sitting at your table and then we got up and left, I just felt myself getting more angry because she just thought free stuff was gonna solve the issue. Also the picture below shows what was supposed to be included in the comp. so we went up to the salad bar, but we're expecting what the menu stated that the side of meat would come with mash potatoes and vegetables. My companion ordered salmon and I ordered the steak expected the steak to come with a gravy mashed potatoes with vegetables and the salmon with mashed potatoes with vegetables, all we got was on a small plate 1 very small piece of salmon, the steak was with 4 thin slice no gravy no mash potatoes no vegetables as stated on the menu. Overall a very disappointing experience.",

Ordered a beer and it sat on the bar for 10-15 minutes before the server came back and then said sorry the kitchen got backed up.  No idea what that had to do with him letting my beer sit on the bar counter for 10-15 minutes but that is unacceptable.  Oh and be prepared for the \"water pouring charge\" LOL!

    "text": "Surprisingly one of the cheaper Brazilian steak house options, especially for it being on the strip. This place is located inside the Miracle Mike Shops right next to the new Buffalo Wild Wings. MEAT LOVERS.. please, step right on up.   Pampas is a Mother's Day tradition for my family & me because they have such a good deal: BOGO free meat rodizio. For Brazilian steak house newbies, the meat rodizio is generally the most popular option. This is where you see the men walking around with stacks of meat & slicing them for you on your plate. There is a slight difference between the selection of meats for lunch, what my family & I chose, and for dinner.  There is also a little salad bar in the back with various salads & a several hot items as well. One of my favorites being the pan de queso (I know that's not Portuguese, but I forgot what the exact name is). It's this delicious cheese bread that's kind of like a pop over, with cheese in the dough, slightly over baked on the outside for the crispness & then fluffy & airy pockets of YUM on the inside. I can just go there to eat those things, they're too good.  Although the meats are served and sliced at the table, it is all you can eat style. So as long as the people keep coming around, you can keep eating. Some of the meats we ate were the house sirloin, pork sausage, chicken wrapped in bacon, tri-tip & Parmesan crusted filet mignon.   I would have given 5 stars, but the seating arrangement was a little too tight. We sat right in front by the main door of the restaurant, so we had a lot of foot traffic passing thru our table. Aside from that, there were also smaller couple tables surrounding our table & I could only imagine how less intimate it would be for a couple to be sitting back to back with another. Also, after a while I had to ask our server to have some more meat pass our way...  I would recommend if you've never experience a Brazilian steak house on a budget compared to other chains that are pricier. This way, you'll understand the EXPERIENCE of it all & if you decide to try more expensive options you'll be more familiar with the environment.",

    "text": "Oh my, now I understand why they're in groupon for a long time now. Reviews on Yelp are mixed about this place but after trying them out, I now know where they stand: 2.5 stars. Although i'm leaning towards just 2 because I left unhappy.  Seating and start were a little impressive as the hostess and our waiter Philippe were awesome. The salad bar and hot side dishes are located all the way to the back of the restaurant, like all the way at the end.  The cheese bread was dry and hard, the veggies are overcooked, the pasta was tasteless. The rest of the stuff though were good like the mashed potato, mushrooms, chicken tortilla soup, plantains, and salad bar. Our waiter brought us the surf plate with a small bowl of mussels (terrible), shrimps (the only thing I ate), salmon (with sweet sauce and over cooked) and 2 matchbox sized pieces of tilapia which are nice and tender. I had a feeling that they were pushing for the customers to eat plates of the surf so as not to consume much of the meat.   So, we had our little \"sign\" card turn up green for like 12 minutes, but no meat was coming out of the kitchen. My hubby and I were literally looking at each other waiting for the meat cause we don't want to get filled up with the carbs. There was a very little choice of meats during lunch, I counted 5: picanha, sirloin, bacon-wrapped chicken, pork and sausage. I don't really mind the small selection as long as the quality is good. I only asked for the picanha and sausage because the steak was almost on the rare side, no part was at least medium, an ounce of blood was oozing from a piece of meat placed on the service plate, it was gross. The gaucho said he'll get me one that is more cooked but he never came back with the piece he promised. OMG, the picanha was such a big disappointment, it was so dry, tough and lacking in flavor. The sausage was the best-tasting of them all but I still won't order that in a restaurant. I tasted my hubby's chicken and it was not good either, but at least was tender. The last thing the gauchos were serving is pineapple which is a disappointment because it's supposed to be grilled, but these were not, they were just warm and looked pale and sad.   The only saving grace was the cheesecake which was actually good. Our server still received a great tip because he was great and attentive, thus the extra star, otherwise, this business only deserves 1.",

Probably, this is  the worst of this type of restaurant I've ever experienced. The salad bar is lacking, and to top it off, there's $1 per person water tax added to your ticket. We were also put in an area that the cold draft every time someone went in/out of a hidden door somewhere, even though this was in a mall. This was not a good choice and I wish I'd have chosen differently. Don't waste your money.",

As soon as we arrived the hostess Mickey was wonderful she did her very best to accommodate us getting us a table made up with a bench seat so our three year old could fall asleep if needed as he was so tired and then put our stroller away you don't often get great help with a little one in Vegas but Mickey couldn't have helped more!!!   Then our server Elias Caballero was awesome!!! We upgraded to the unlimited meats which also included the unlimited salad for just $10 each and the unlimited drinks for $20 per person. Initially it took a while to get any meat so we told our server and our plates were never empty again. And our drinks were never empty. On top of that Elias was friendly, helpful and just created a lovely atmosphere.   Also every server coming round with the meats was so polite and friendly again setting a perfect atmosphere   Wonderful experience, food and people. Very family friendly, I would definitely recommend",

When we arrived and showed the voucher to our waiter and he immediately tried to up-sell drinks and additional meats.   We politely declined and that appeared to upset the waiter.   He was very curt with us thereafter and admonished us by saying we were only allowed one visit to the open salad bar.   This was contrary to what was mentioned on the Hilton voucher for this restaurant as \"Help yourself to unlimited samplings from our side bar which features over 40 Hot and Cold sides and salads to complete your experience\"  He then brought the main course (Chicken), which was two pieces of chicken drumsticks on a plate without anything else. I have a picture of two sad looking drumsticks on a plate with a fork...  This is advertised on the voucher as 'Roasted Herb chicken served with mashed potatoes and fresh vegetables'    On their menu it says \"Grilled Peito De Frango: Tender chicken breast seasoned with olive oil, fresh herbs & grilled garlic. Served with steamed rice & grilled vegetables.\"  We brought this to the attention of the manager Ms. Roybal and showed her my plate. She said that was the way they served their dish and that the voucher that Hilton provided us needed to be updated by Hilton. She said Hilton had misled us.  Overall it was a very bad experience with their server and manager and with the quality of food.",

Even with the 2 for 1 coupon, bill came out almost $100 because of the drink you must order. Then the bill suggested tip is bast on the regular priced dinner so the final total is over $120 for two.

    "text": "We visited because my husband's coworker told him he \"dreams about this restaurant\". I then found a deal on travelzoo, and the plans were set.   Even with a reservation, we had to wait a while (about 30 min), it's a popular spot.  You are seated, a friendly waiter greets you and takes drink orders, then you're sent to the serve yourself hot/cold food bar. This includes sides such as rice, grilled squash, salad, and my ultimate favorite part of the whole night.... (Gluten free) Brazilian cheese bread aka Pao de Queijo... Oh my goodness is this bread amazing. It may have been the highlight of my entire trip to Vegas!  Our travelzoo deal included a bottle of house wine, it was a Cabernet Sauvignon, and it was nothing special- a CA cab that was metallic and pretty cheap tasting. This wasn't even offered by the glass on their wine menu, so I know it was a cheap offering just for the deal we had.  Then came the meats...  I believe there were 12 that came around? Chicken thighs, bacon wrapped filet mignon, sausages, lamb, pork, it seemed unending. We had to turn down most of the meat they offered because I was so full from the sides. I had the idea in mind that they would be bringing a huge slab of meat around, and that it wouldn't be fresh. This is not the case, they cook a fresh item then walk around with it once until it is gone, then bring something else fresh a few minutes later.   There is a sign to put on your table, a wooden sign with a green side (bring more food) and a red side (we're taking a break/done right now), but even when we had it on red they still didn't skip our table just in case we wanted the new meat.  This was a great experience, we'll be back.. For me, maybe just for the GF cheese rolls!",

Don't forget to get your starch from the salad bar. I got the garlic mashed potatoes but passed on the rice pilaf.  Our server was very friendly and provided a very awesome experience. They also have a nice wine list.  The meats kept coming and coming and it was a carnivore's dream. The seafood took a little more time and my wife didn't get a second round.

Trust me, he was not your typical stuffy Vegas manager, this guy is the real deal. He was spot on every single thing we needed and made a point of checking on us several times throughout the meal . The salad bar was fresh and plentiful. Along with this initial self-serve option you could also scoop up a variety of sides such as rice, beans, mashed potatoes and plantains. I had some of each and they were all super yummy. For the meat selections... they came again and again. Each time they were hot, very tasty and extremely juicy. For a place that we simply tripped over it was a fantastic find and surely will be the meal highlight of the weekend. We are hooked and are a sure bet to return the next time we are in town.  I need to quickly add that all of the kids (young men) that served the meats (protein) were super friendly and knowledgable about the products they were serving. Charles and the boys hit one out of the park for us tonight and as we waddle back to our room we are extremely grateful.",

All you can eat meat is all about quantity. If you want quality, you go on the other side of the strip and you eat at the steak places in the City Center places. If you want a sword's worth of meat, you come here.  It's worth the time it takes to chew through it all, though I do have some cautionary advice for you, depending on your evening's plans and how often you eat multiple pounds of red meat in a single sitting. Maybe consider this place on the night that you are not going to be bumping up against people for hours on end in a packed nightclub. The meat-burp-breath is not as popular as it used to be a few years ago. People are starting to move on to other fads, unfortunately.  Taking a lady home? I hope you brought aromatic candles with you. Your room will smell like the dumpster behind a McDonalds by the time the sun starts beating against the blackout curtains.  Five-hour flight back to the east coast? I hope the plane has a convertible roof, or you might set off the lavatory smoke detectors.  No? You've got it all under control? Okay. I won't give you the last bit of advice then.  Best of luck.",

The meat dishes were all excellent but the salad bar was kind of lame in comparison - no homemade olives, no decent cheese or dry ham. Cuts of meat were tasty but a notch below the competitor in quality. No lamb or suckling pig. Rodizio is about 70% of the cost at the more upscale place. Service was excellent, restaurant and back of the house were spotless. Excellent caipirinhas. Advantage of Pampas over the competitor is location - it is in Planet Hollywood, whereas the other place is far from the strip (not walkable).",

The salad and fried bananas were okay  but you will get full eating the salad items before the carvers get to your table. I've been to a brazillian restaurant and carvers were very fast in serving the meats. The meat has nothing to brag about, most of the meats were tough like rubber especially the lamb, some were over cooked and some were under cooked like it almost raw. The only decent meat was the sirloin steak and that was served when we were almost done eating. They also served grilled chicken drumstick, very tender but has no flavor. The server was very nice though. Over all the money we spent was not woth it. Wont be coming back for sure. Oh and they charged $1 per person for drinking filltered water.",

We sat at our table for well over 30 minutes after placing our order and considering this is a Brazilian Churrascaria, I sat and watched meats come and go, but never stop at our table. We alerted our food server and she reassured us that the meats would come our way, but again, they didn't.  The one piece of steak that I did get served (medium) was completely dried out and very salty.   Service was poor! Our server didn't smile, speak much, nor did she apologize for the fact that we had to ask her several times for our food, as well as the one and only drink that we ordered! Salad bar options were plenty and this is the only reason for the one star. I do not recommend this place! I do however think that the round paper circle used to alert servers (keep it coming / no more please) be replaced with an object that is more visible on the tables.",

So, service was excellent. Management was atrocious. Rodizio food was below average. Salad bar was mediocre at best.  It started when we checked in at 6:25pm for a 6:30pm reservation. They overbooked, so we weren't seated until 7:35pm...remind me, what's the point of a reservation?  Our waiter, Monfre (sp?), was very attentive, as was the girl circulating to make caipirinhas tableside, good at her job. The compliments end there.  Between paramedics coming through the restaurant to resolve an undisclosed issue, or security restraining a guy at the door (prob furious at having to wait an hour after his reservation time, too)...at least there was free entertainment.  We've been to many charruscarias in Vegas, and Pampas is toward the bottom of my list. I won't be going back, ever.",

    "text": "I am severely disappointed that I must 1 star this review.   There was no card given to us to flip red or green. The restaurant was empty yet the men with meat sticks were very few and far between.   It seemed their aim was to get you one slice of something and take their time in hopes you filled up on the buffet stuff to make a profit on their outgoing expensive cuts.   We were not told that the water cost 1.00 per glass/refill if I had known that, I would have asked for tap water.  I had to ask several times where the meat gauchos were and when they did come, it was all pork offerings, no chicken, or beef after several \"no's\" I had to specifically ask for all of their beef dishes.   The buffet table offerings were sub-par and served as filler space I felt.   Our main server was friendly but I did not openly complain about the experience, I simply had to sit there, steam about it, and deal with it.  Our server kindly asked us to leave a 5-star review, and I just can't bring myself to it... I can't do it... I'm sorry sweety, You are awesome and deserve to be at a much better place than this...   over-all I will not be returning to this particular place. It is NOT worth the money, go to Fogo or Texas and get your money's worth... This is a hard NO from me.",

    "text": "First of all, thank God we got our meal free, because otherwise, I would be one pissed off customer!   Let me just say, my husband and I are Churrascaria fanatics. We love us some Brazilian steakhouses...so when we were offered a free meal (and show) for sitting through a dumb time share presentation in Vegas, we took it! We can save money and eat in one of our favorite types of restaurants, so why not?!   Now I know why it was free. The salad bar is left to the imagination, with very little on it. They had CUBED cheese. CUBED!! What are we? Four year olds? The hot food wasn't any better. It looked like it had been sitting there with no one to stir it or check on it.   Now let's get to the main part. What should have been the main event...the MEAT! Wish I could tell you how it was...there was at least 10-15 minutes between each Gaucho...our server (the bartender) never asked us how we liked our meat (which is ALWAYS asked at any Brazilian Churrascaria restaurant)...so we would ask our gauchos for medium rare. Not ONCE did we get medium rare. Not ONCE. It was medium to medium well, and even well at one time. The selection of meat is as follows: ham, ham, ham, sirloin, ham, ham, sausage (burnt), ham. What the heck! Where is the BEEF?! They only had sirloin. Nothing else. And it was mediocre at best. Service sucked-we have never had our drinks empty at any other places, but we had to flag down our server (the bartender) 3xs to get him to refill our drink. When we complained that we never saw the beef, he came (20 minutes later) with a plate of burnt sausage, two chicken legs, and ham on a plate. What the HECK?!   Oh-but my favorite part...we had asked for clean plates, so our server (bartender) took our plates and said he would be right back with clean ones...of course this would happen to be the time that a gaucho stopped by with meat...he asked if we wanted some and my husband pointed out that we didn't have plates...the gaucho then proceeded to say, \"I can put it on the mini plate (the plate that holds our tongs) until you get your plate...\" Um, no?! Ugh. I hate incompetence.   They charge $2 for \"bottled\" water when you ask for water-they place the bottle on the table and then conveniently forget to tell you it's a charge...  Again-I'm so glad it was free, because I would have been super pissed if I would've paid for that.   Save your time, save your money, don't come here.",

We Waited 30 minutes for server to show up- to order my dessert and my neighbors' bills. That was just the snapshot of the awesomeness of the service level here.   From my understanding, people come to this restaurant for all kinds of Groupon, coupon, timeshare deals. It is very smart from the business perspective. Unfortunately it didn't seem like they are able to meet the needs of those who their marketing department brings in.   Slow down Pampas.. get better before you get permanently blacklisted or become a heartless business machine.",

I am a very easy happy customer and I almost never complain. I have even been to this place twice to make sure I have a better opinion formed. First of all, I am Brazilian and this is not authentic at all. Are any of your cooks, waiters etc Brazilian? Cause almost nothing there is Brazilian. Please try using Brazilian rice for example. Or jasmine, or basmati are better too. Not those weird awful rice you have there. The cheese breads need to be less cooked, cause pao de queijo is soft. Try adding more potatoes options, Brazilian don't care so much for mashed potatoes. Also, what about some Brazilian music? Those Spanish speaking music reminded me nothing about my country. I can bet most people who work there are not Brazilian but you could at least try harder. Or make your prices lower. One more thing: your service is very slow. For that price you have to make rain meats on our plates. We had to wait forever for a little tiny piece of cow",

    "text": "During our weekend trip to Vegas, my husband and I were craving Brazilian and decided to see what Vegas had to offer. The other Brazilian restaurants (Texas de Brazil and Sampa), which both had higher ratings on Yelp than Pampas, had 1 1/2 hour wait times. Pampas did not have any wait time and despite its 3 1/2 star review, we thought, how could you go wrong with Brazilian? Well, let me count the ways...  1. They stuck us in the far back corner of the room, which I was ok with at first since  we had a 15 month old with us, but when the meat guys (not sure what they're called) systematically avoided our table, that was strike 1 for us... 2. Ok, so the meat guys finally made it to our table, but guess which one kept coming to our table again and again. The LAMB guy. I mean, really. If we wanted lamb we would have gone to a Mediterranean restaurant or something. I mean, bring on the skirt steak and top sirloin. Enough with the lamb.  3. Except they didn't have any skirt steak. They did have something they called filet mignon, but to be honest, I've never had filet mignon that tasted like beef jerky.  4. But the REAL deal breaker for us...I mean the one that almost made us dine and dash, was their pan de quejio, if that's even what it was. They tasted more like dry biscuits from a fried chicken shop than those delightful little bursts of warm cheesiness we were anticipating. Pampas, we can forgive you for the filet mignon. We'll even forgive you for ignoring us. But when you mess with the pan de quejio, that's when you've crossed the line. F-!!",

I am the last person to complain about pricing as money is not an issue, but this place was too expensive for its own good. The food is good, but not exceptional and the service is lacking. The deserts were not good, just generic and nothing ethnic or special at all.   Servers were very condescending, seeing how I am in my mid 20's and was dressed causally, and they automatically assumed that I don't have the funds available...which is far from the truth. You can definitely notice the 3 piece suits were served with a lot different approach than our \"youthful\" table. There were also quite a few mess-ups with the bill at the end.

Like someone else stated, the little hostess was snobby and didn't have much of a customer service mind-set. But as much as I wanted to lose my cool, there was a HUGE plus in my experience, the manager Bob. Bob is a gentleman who knows customer service. And just as he kept his word to us on our visit to Las Vegas, I'm keeping mine to him by writing this review.  Because of my encounter with Bob, who asked that we revisit the restaurant before we departed Vegas, we did. And I assure you it was a much different experience. Both visits, the food was good, but I am a stickler for customer service. Not only did Bob rectify my issues on my first visit, it was obvious that he addressed my concerned prior to visiting again. It was also surprising to see that he was at work again, so obviously he takes a hands-on approach to management and has great work ethic.  The side items were different on each visit, and we even tried some of the other menu items.  I would suggest that you do not go if you are in a rush or if you're starving, the relaxed atmosphere is designed to take your time eating so that you can savor the items as they travel through the dining area. I would recommend the Brazilian bouillabaisse. It was full of flavor and had a wonderful spice. I would go again when I travel back.",

It was obvious you were expected to satisfy your hunger on the less costly salads & sides so meat portions would be minimal. In fact, if you are hungry, you have no other choice.

    "text": "Let me get to the point right now... DO NOT EAT HERE!  This was a BOMB from start to finish and a complete waste of $157.00 for 4 people.  We made reservations.  When we showed up the hostess tried to put us outside where everyone walks by you. We noticed that's whereshe tries to put everyone initially. It's obviously is an effort to gain attention of by-passers, who think \"wow, let's eat here, it's so busy\".   It's very impersonal area, so we said we will sit inside.  So now she makes us wait for like 7+ minutes.  The inside was nearly empty and we still waited.  The waitress looked \"frazzled\" that we choise to eat inside.  So she seats us next to an entry way like a thoroughfare, but this place is nearly empty.  Many nice tables available.  Then we waited nearly 10 minutes for someone to say \"hi\" I'm your waiter/waitress.  We were just ready to leave this place when out of the blue, a waitress greets us with a really bad vibe, unhappy feeling, impersonable to say the least.  So I order the unlimited meat thing for $37.95 or close to that price.  Well to keep this short, the meat carving people DO NOT make their rounds consistently.  They leave you waiting for more than 10-15 minutes at a time before another meat arrives.  I sat there looking around thinking what the heck is going on here?  Then someone shows up.  You can feel the reluctancy to carve you any decent sized portion.  Then you wait 10-15 minutes... another person comes, you get the picture???  One of my guests had a halibut fish at $27.99.  It was sadly the size of a king-sized pack of cigarettes, with some steamed veggies and that was a bit dry.  This was a let down.  My wife's dish was a lobster bouilliabaise.  The dish was mediocre, the tiny shrimp you had to find in the soup, the mussels were so tiny that I cant believe they would serve that!  The pasta was overcooked.  They only served me 5  types of meat while there. The filet mignon was the only one I could comfortably chew.  The rest of the meat was not very tender and tasty.  We over-heard our waitress complaining to another one saying the meat service is affecting her tips.   Yes it does, and so does her crappy personality.  Let me tell all of you that read this.  This place survives, thanks to the countless tourist turn-over.  This place is so desperate, they hand-out discount coupons in front of their place to the people that walk by....if you walk in because you wanted to anyhow, no discount coupon offer for you!   Plus take in mind my earlier comment about how thay want you to sit out front so they can market you to other suckers walking by. This place is no better than an average dinner buffet for $12.95.  I should have payed attention to the other Yelper comments out there, and I got burned.  Oh yeah, our seats were badly covered in grease drippings and other spills left behind from customers.  Gross!  One last thing, when we left, we walked by a hostess or a waitress who was using a company computer moniter station area  to check her FaceBook photos.... \"class act\" here people.  You can see, this place is a BOMB from start to finish.  Take my advice.... and others.... just pass over this place, it should close it's doors... for good.",

The fam and I got seated in this room full of wine so it was our own private room rather seating with everyone else. The waitress got us everything we needed. The manager at the end even brought us two desserts as a complimentary which was cool! I don't think they will do that for everyone and I don't know how we even got it, but either way Pampas is great. I think they are good everywhere and I can't wait next time to go to breakfast (hopefully).",

    "text": "We came here for my 30th birthday celebration last month. Since we knew this is a meat buffet kind of thing, we came very hungry. We arrived and got seated fast. 2 servers came for drinks or whatnot before our real server even got there. We already had our salad/appetizers in place when the real server came and took our orders: 2 seafood for the girls and 2 meat for the boys. Simple, right? Let's see...  One meat came after another serving the boys. Looks good, smells good, tastes good...the boys had it good for about one hour while the girls sat down nibbling on some salad...waiting for some seafood. We were waiting for half an hour when we asked one of the girls who brought us meat if we can have some -- she said, \"you ordered seafood, you can't have meat.\" Okay then...  We waited another half an hour for our seafood to arrive (mind you: our real server didn't bother coming during our total 1-hour waiting) to no avail. Thank goodness for the salad bar and conversations that kept us sane.   Finally, the real server came and we asked how long it usually takes to prepare the seafood. She scrambled her notepad and from her verbal responses and facial reactions, it seemed to have forgotten that the girls ordered seafood. But she tried to cover it up by saying: \"Let me check the kitchen.\" So she left. Shortly, she came back and said, \"Oh I'm sorry, they threw away the paper that I gave them. They're cooking it now. Do you still want it?\" We said yes, and she gave us meat plates (to indicate to the others that we are now ok to receive meat). Then our server said: \"I will tell my manager to remove the seafood off your tab.\" We said thank you.   4 types of meat came but we were already full from the salad. By the time the seafood came, not only we were stuffed but they were fishy and oily. So we stopped eating after one bite.   Then we recieved our tab. ALL regular prices. I was confused. Our server said that she will remove the seafood off our tab. What she ended up doing is 'replace' seafood with 'meat' instead. Replace? That's not the word I remember her say.  I confronted (calmly) our server and told her how I understood her when she said \"remove the seafood\" from our tab and when she gave us meat plates. I said: \"I thought that was your gesture of saying sorry for letting us wait an hour and 10 minutes for our right food to arrive.\" Then I added, \"I didn't ask for meat plates -- you put it on our tables so that was to imply you're giving it to us so we'll have something to eat while waiting.\" And when the server answered me: \"Oh, you mean give you $40 worth of free food? No, we don't do that.\" At this point, I was irritated.   So bottom line, we were ripped off. We paid full meat price when we only had time for 4 rounds and a bite of their fishy seafood items. This doesn't even include when the boys had to ask the servers to bring them the rest of the meat mentioned on the menu to make sure they get what they were promised, plus we had to ask for drink refills, and we had to ask for soup bowls in the bar.   If there was a negative star on this rating, I would give it. Only two of the meat that we ate were better than what we make at home -- the rest, mediocre -- not worth for the money.   The food and the service -- two thumbs down. very, very down.",

This restaurant was beyond sub-par.  The meat options were limited and were warm. We went for lunch and thought the food would be fresh and hot but it wasn't. We also ordered the surf and turf option and the fish were down right  gross. It was dried out and seasoned improperly. I should not see a clump of spices on a portion of the fish.  The waitress was slow although she only had 3 tables. It felt like groundhogs day with the same meats coming around. The flavor was awful with little to no seasoning.  I am SO glad my husband and I didn't spend our hard earned money for this terrible food experience.   I absolutely wouldn't recommend this restaurant and will never ever return.   Save your money for the abundant, classy and flavorful restaurants in Vegas",

Upon answering the door, they graciously gave me my precious grilled salmon, I was about to close the door and they said \"Tip please!\" and I reached deep down my pockets and handed the short man a pleasant $5 bill. The man turned around and nodded to the car with a slight smile. As soon as the man nodded, a waiter dressed in formal attire and an apron opened the door, we locked immediate eye contact. The man came strongly marching for my door with a 45-foot pepper grinder, I had almost closed my door in fear until he yells \"PEPPER, NOW.\". I open my box and he grinds pepper as dark as night onto my salmon.   When he grinded the pepper I got a little bit in my eye, but the food was amazing!",

The meat was mediocre, the seafood (shrimp, mussels, and calamari) were terrible, the salad bar was comparable in both looks and quality to something you would find at Sizzler, the drinks took 30 mins to come out, our table was haphazardly thrown together with a 3/4 empty bottle of water and disheveled flatware, all the tables were squeezed so close together that the servers could hardly get through them, and our server was overtly stressed and kept telling us how terrible a night it was. The restaurant was only half full, so it's hard to understand how everything was being managed so poorly. I would never recommend this restaurant to anybody.",

When you go to a Brazilian steakhouse,  you would think their beef would be amazing.   Unfortunately this was not the case.   The sirloin,  filet mignon & tri tip were dry and well done.  We did get to try a medium rare sirloin and that was tasty but not amazing.  Their chicken wrapped bacon was nothing to rave about.  The first chicken drumstick we got was juicy and delicious but the second one was alittle overcooked and charcoal.    The best thing that was brought on the skewer was the grilled pineapple.   Sadly what I enjoyed the most besides the grilled pineapple was from their salad bar....   their ceasar salad,  mixed greens, sauteed mushrooms, and Pao de queijo (Brazilian cheese bread).    For their price, it should be fine dining but it's definitely not.   It's more like a casual atmosphere.",

The buffet was well stocked, the freshly cooked meats were amazing and the service was top notch. We should have gone back today, but I stead chose the Spice Market Buffet on the casino floor.. Big mistake! It's worth the extra 5 minute walk to Pampas!   We'll definitely be back next time we're at Planet Hollywood!",

    "text": "** UPDATED REVIEW (from 3 stars to 5!) **  12/29/17  Had 5:00pm reservations. Got here about 4:45pm and were seated immediately. We were starving so inhaled our first round in about 20mins.  Kind of disappointed in us bc we could only go 1 round! We were stuffed!   The meat guys were a little too quick for my liking to slice and dash. A couple of times they just piled things. I don't like that, but whatever.   Waiter: I think his name was Sean (we started with one guy who may have gone on break bc we ended with another guy). All the staff was extremely nice and attentive.   Shrimp: excellent   Sirloin:  Absolute favorite. Juicy with great flavor.  Tri Tip:  I thought it was a little dry. The Man thought it was very good and flavorful.  Pork Tenderloin:  I thought it was decent. I didn't finish my piece, though. The Man thought it was a little on the dry side  Sausage:  Crispy on the outside; juicy and flavorful on the inside  Bacon-Wrapped Filet Mignon:  I love bacon but wasn't really feeling this. The Man said, \"Almost anything bacon-wrapped is good!\" To each his own.  Lamb:  First-time trying lamb. Nope. Not lamb fans.   Chicken:  I didn't try it. The Man said the skin was nice and crispy but dry on the inside.   Ham: didn't try  Salad bar:  Good variety of cheese, pasta, rice, salad, and sides.  Water:  Excellent! I don't like water, but this was good! Nice and refreshing.  Guarana Soda:  First time trying and it wasn't bad. Refreshing; tasted like carbonated apple juice, sooooo apple cider.  (got FREE with my Yelp checkin)  Bathroom:  Disappointing! Was definitely in need of some maintenance and it did not smell very nice, AT ALL.  The Man said the men's restroom was ok.  Picture person! This time, though, the lady didn't get irritated when I said \"no thanks\" to buying the big pictures. She was super friendly.   Three stars because not all the meats met our expectation from our past experiences at other Brazilian Steakhouses. Overall: Decent. We will eat here again, especially with a BOGO!   Ok -- time to roll me out .....  ** UPDATE **  12/31/17  We were invited back by Arash for lunch and seated in the private room. Erica was our server. First thumbs up because she was amazing!!  All the meat and seafood was served hot and fresh.   Their salad buffet was still amazing. This time, someone was constantly cleaning up and replenishing. Excellent bc people can be messy at buffets.   * Bacon-Wrapped Chicken: YES! * Sausage: YES! * Garlic Mashed Potatoes: YES! * Sauteed Mushrooms: YES! * Sirloin: YES! Plus I mixed it with my salad = Excellent steak salad! * Tilapia: YES! * Mussels: Both mine and The Man's first time trying - different but not bad! They were served in a tomato-based sauce so you can taste the tomato. Mixed with mashed potato, they were very good. * Salmon: I am allergic to salmon but The Man said YES! Best salmon he's had in a long time. It is topped with a sweet teriyaki sauce which they make in-house and he said it is EXCELLENT. * Ham: YES! * Chicken: In my previous review, this chicken was on the dry side. Today, OMG! The chefs nailed it! Super moist and the skin! YES! * Tri-Tip: YES! I got an end-fatty piece = Eye-rolling OMG! So much flavor and tenderness. * Pork Tenderloin: YES! Much better flavor than last time!  So -- after all this, I had to unbutton my jeans; everything was so good, I wanted to try more! So, here it goes:  * Chicken Tortilla Soup: Good. The chicken was just a tad dry, but that can happen when it's continually heating. The flavor was on point! * Corn Chowder: Amazing! * Tortellini Salad: Yes! * Asian Pasta Salad: First-time trying! Different taste but very good. * Italian Pasta Salad: Yes! * Green Beans: Yes!  * Garbanzo Beans: Spicy for me (I'm a total spice lightweight), but good flavor! * Basil Tomato: Yes! * Basil Carrots: Yes! * Couscous Salad: Yes! * Cheesecake and Chocolate Mousse Cake: EYE-ROLLING OMG!  Bathroom: Yes! The men's room was being cleaned - The women's room had a fresh clean smell and was neat and tidy; AS IT SHOULD BE! YES!  Way to go Arash and Pampa's! You have exceeded our expectation! Everything was absolutely amazing! Thank you for the VIP experience! The next time we are in Vegas, we will DEFINITELY make this a spot to eat!  From 3 to a well-earned 5 stars! Thank you!",

Since I tend to think with my stomach, I can overlook the service in this instance and direct my rating toward the food. The meat, as well as the salad bar, was great. I stuffed myself like I was living my last day on this earth. The meat came at decent time intervals. I especially jumped at the chicken, bacon-wrapped turkey, and sausage.   My server, however, was quite cold and rude. She flinched when we mentioned that we had the Tix4Tonight voucher, taking away our menus immediately (what if I had wanted to browse it further?). Instead of giving us tap water, which she did for the adjacent table, she handed us an Acqua Panna bottle ($6.95). Two weeks later, I am still perplexed as to why this happened (I clearly did not say bottled water). She also consistently failed to check up on us, bypassing us as she checked on her other tables. I sometimes wonder why such people decide to go into the hospitality service. Needless to say, her tip was accordingly small.  p.s. You can get a decent deal here with the Tix4Tonight booths.  p.p.s. I may have eaten almost as many fried bananas as I did meat.",

    "text": "Pampas currently has an offer through 11/30/11 for a $43.95 Gift Certificate when you bring in a canned or boxed food item for donation to the LV Food Bank.  Even with a discount I wouldn't return, but if you're still interested the offer info is on their website.  We arrived around 9:30p and waited briefly to be seated because they only had 2 sections that they were seating.  After about 15 minutes of waiting and no greeting from anyone, the waiter for our section greets the last table that had just been seated to take their orders.  Really??  Aware of our displeasure, the manager approaches and apologizes, introducing our server, Marcio (the same server who was just at the previously mentioned table), \"who will take good care of you.\"  After giving Marcio our order for the Meat Rodizio, he tells us to start with the salad bar area.  (We wouldn't see Marcio again for a very long time.)  There is absolutely nothing notable about on the salad bar, nothing that looks tempting, or overly fresh.  Everything is just alright.  We return to our table to find the meat gaucho scene bleak.  Over the next 20 minutes we would be offered 3 things: fresh pineapple, sirloin, and ham.  Really??  I've been to Brazilian Churrascarias before and I've never seen so little action.  Enter the scene Jeremy, our savior, who immediately jumps into action.  He asks what meats we have tried and would like to try. We tell him that we have only had 3 things, to which he says, \"I'm gonna go make a note on the board for you, so we can get you guys a taste of everything.\"  Thank you sweet baby Jesus!  Jeremy opens the flood gates, and just like that meat starts flowing into our room.  For the rest of the night Jeremy would be the only person keeping an eye on our glasses, making sure we got food and beverage refills.  Thank you Jeremy!  Food quality is highly inconsistent, ranging anywhere from a (-3) to 4.  The first piece of picanha we tried was more dehydrated, shriveled, and overcooked than a slice of beef jerky.  Once we asked for rare they did step it up and deliver a tasty piece that I would rate at a 4.  Their chicken legs had no flavor, pork loin was dull.  The good: bacon wrapped turkey, picanha (after adjustment), lamb (inconsistent, but had 1 good piece), and tri-tip (shocking because I normally don't care that much for it, but very flavorful & juicy).  Ok, we're donzo.  Check please.  Marcio!  There you are!  We were certain that he had gone home or something.  I really hope that they split tips there because our \"would be server\" gave us absolutely no face time.    At most Churrascarias the gauchos are personable and communicative.  There is a total disconnect here.  Once, one of the gauchos did, to my surprise, ask us if there was anything that we would like to try.  The atmosphere is non-existent.  As we strolled to our car my boyfriend made a comment that summed it all up.  He said, \"Pampas is an Olive Garden in the world of Churrascarias.\"",

    "text": "Got a Groupon to go this place for lunch. The deal included surf and turf lunch for two plus two cocktails and one dessert to share. It cost us about $50. I'll start with the few positives: -The cocktails were good. I got the sangria and my friend got a mojito. Both were nice and strong and tasted good.  -the rolls were light and fluffy and delicious (we ate a lot of these to get our money's worth) -the dessert, a chocolate mousse pie was yummy! Now for the negatives: -the service was slow. We had to ask for them to send over the meat carvers more than once. -the surf part of our meal included a few dry mussels, several shrimp that were not deveined properly (seriously gross!), some fairly tasty salmon, and some mushy white fish. -the meat was not tasty at all. The beef was fatty and hard to cut, and the pork and chicken were dry. The only good meat that I had was the sausage.  -the side dish buffet was sparse and many dishes were empty. My friend never got any potatoes, as they were never replenished. Server failed to take away our dirty dishes and they began to stack up.  -at the end of the meal, the server came over and made sure to tell us that the value of our meal was $94, and to make sure we tipped on that amount! We are good tippers normally and as local Las Vegans, we know how to tip. We didn't need the lesson. -there was $1 charge each for warm tap water that they bring in an opened water bottle. We took bets that it was just normal Las Vegas tap water.  -the womens' restroom was filthy and unusable.   Overall, the experience wasn't worth the gas we used to get to Planet Hollywood. If we had actually paid $94 for this meal, I wouldn't thrown a fit. I am not normally a picky eater. I would suggest that if you want good Brazilian food, your best bet is to go to Texas de Brazil.",

He did an OK job, was very polite but did not do anything above and beyond. At the end of the meal, he made sure to remind us that we need to tip off of the total before our vouchers, and instead of letting me fill out the area for the tip, he asked \"so which option would you like to leave, 15% or 20%?\" In all of my years eating out, I have never encountered this. He knew exactly what he was doing, that in a packed Vegas restaurant I was not going to object and cause a scene, and that was extremely rude of him. After reading about this issue in a previous review on YELP, I see this is a reoccurring issue. I begrudgingly paid the 15% tip, although refilling water twice and taking away two plates hardly earns a 21 dollar tip. I am honestly amazed by the nerve of this waiter to do what he did, and had there not been tables surrounding us, it would've gone down differently. Avoid this place if you aren't looking to be hassled. The waiter was an older, bald Man with a British accent.",

We had a large party of 11, so we paid $3 bucks each for discounted coupon on the meal. We were all a little skeptical, becasue none of us had never had brazilian food, but we figured how bad could the meat be. Well typically the meal is $50 for like 50 different meats served on skewers and cut for you at table side. But with our coupon we ended up paying only $32 and you could upgrade to seafood option for $7 and get like 5-6 seafood items. Salad/soup and pasta bar included in teh price. We were full after trying like 5 meats. The grilled pineapple and filet mignon is to die for!  The waiter was absolutely on it and catered to our every request. We ate here before the show, so service was very fast and efficient and we were able to get in at 7pm and get to our show by 930pm. They typically don't make separate bills but they will charge as many payments as you like. I suggest if you go in large group make sure everyone has cash!

As for the food they just kept bringing the same five meats over and over and the steak was raw - NOT medium well. Our server Amanda was rude and had a face you should just not wear to work.  The only positive thing about the experience was the drinks cart the young lady was friendly and made amazing drinks.  Overall save ur time and money, there are a lot of other great restaurants out there don't waste ur time here.",

Too expensive and too much (wasted) food for me in general but everything, from the capirinha prepared table side by a lovely woman to the delicious salad bar and of course the meat. And the staff was so gracious. However a dining experience like this has a lot of other components. We had to wait a l-o-n-g time between each course. I understood that you are plied with different meats but we were kind of ignored. That said, I really had a enough but my friend who knows what's what was put off. Certainly for the price she expected better service. And the bathroom was AWFUL. So if I frequented that type of restaurant I'd give them another chance but they do need to work on a few things.",

    "text": "OWNERS: I was going to begin \"Pampas Grille is a turd that even \"Mythbusters\" couldn't polish\", or \"when I die, I now believe that I will either go to Heaven or Pampas Grille\", but this review will be about one server. After I was seated, my server asked if there would be one or two joining me. \"Two\". She poured my glass of water and the one across me, saw my Vegas4locals voucher unfolded, stopped pouring, let out a little growl, shook her hair directly over the water of my guest, and walked swiftly away. Maybe a bug flew in her ear. Maybe she had forgot something that she just remembered. Maybe she didn't like my voucher which was not free! I bid many times on 7 other auctions before I won(?). After the ladies arrived, she came back and asked what we wanted. I introduced the ladies as current A-list banquet food servers and me as a former one. A normal reaction is to celebrate, because it is virtually impossible to screw up a great tip. After ordering, she explained that we needed two plates; one for the salad, and the other for meat. She circled behind me, and then walked across in front several feet away. I confess that my next question was a rudeness test. \"That was two plates, right?\" She answered, \"TOooo plates\" as she looked down at her pad while shaking her head no, and moving two fingers back and forth while twisting her wrist both ways. Try doing all of that yourself. That two stupid word reply \"TOooo plates\" has kept me awake more than once, because NOBODY could be that rude in this business!! My watery drink took an hour. I heard, \"Are you finished with this?\" on my right; I looked to my right, then to the left. She had taken my salad plate, and within earshot I said' \"nooo\" to no avail. Finally, the check comes; I know that's what it was because she showed it to me from 4 feet away for a full second before closing in on the ladies. WAIT ONE F#&%ING SECOND. I understand that I'm not much to look at, and I carry a Shillelagh, but if a server wants to talk about the check, they better make sure that they are INDEED talking to the host. Besides, GODDAMMIT, \"I'm A MAN, not much of one, but A MAN.\"~~Daniel Tosh. While I waved for the check to come my way, she turned left and got it closer to Tomie, one of my former shop stewards, so I leaned in to see. This little POS was telling Tomie that any gratuity should be based on this number and not this one. I leaned as far as possible, and she moved the check about 1/8 of an inch, so that I still couldn't see anything. I got her attention loudly! \"Why won't you look at me?\" \"I thought that I was looking at all of you.\" \"Well you weren't!!! At this point, I can't remember very much while being this upset, but I think that I demanded she leave. SHE WAS TAKING THE INITIATIVE OF DISCUSSING THE TIP!!!! Almost nothing gets you fired more quickly in the service industry--it is the Golden Rule. Maybe that's why I leaned so far, because her voice got soft so nobody but Tomie and Sabe would hear her. I threw two one hundred dollar bills for the $189 bill into the wallet which she picked up, began to walk away, turned around, and said kindly, \"Do you want your(?)...\"  NOT AGAIN!!!!!! She was begging a tip for a SECOND time!!!! I EXPLODED!!! \"DON'T YOU...... (as I shook and pointed a finger at her)\". I calmed a little and said, \"bring me my change!\" That last one was an attempt to get 11 stupid dollars. I have NEVER EVEN SEEN OR HEARD any server being RUDE or BLATANTLY INITIALIZING DISCUSSION OF THE GRATUITY. Reviews that I read mentioned the servers were rude. I said it was BS. It took me 2+ weeks to start this review. I was so mad that I wouldn't tip; ANOTHER FIRST. My guests tipped $35. The manager smiled like she had a mask on as she listened, that's it. I held my glass as I left so that sorry excuse of a waitress would have to stop me for a final stare down alone. I didn't go for the food; I went for the service. A hot dog would have filled my tummy. Read 1 star Brazilian reviews for food authenticity. OWNERS: YOUR RESTAURANT IS IN THE TOILET.  Is anyone still hungry??????????",

What will make or break your experience is where you're seated.  I suspect that to be the case at most churrascarias.   Don't let them seat you in the bar.  Request a nice table in the dining room, you will most likely get better service just due to the convenient location to the kitchen.  Get there well after the dinner seating has begun to avoid the lunch overlap.  Oh, the photos they take of you are not free if you actually want one printed before you leave.",

    "text": "Wow, the food and service at Pampas was so bad, I regretted coming here even though I used the Groupon \"two for $28\" voucher. If it wasn't for the voucher, I would have screamed bloody murder.  Anyway, coming here on weekend during lunch hour, we only saw a few tables occupied which we didn't think it was a good sign. But we went ahead and decided to give it a try before reaching any conclusion. After we were seated, I looked around and noticed nobody was really enjoying their food, and not a smile in sight (including the staff.)   After we got salad and soup from the salad bar, we must have waited like 10 -15 min before two staff came out with skewers of meat. We were starving but the look of the meat didn't even look that good to us. The meat were cold, under seasoned, and very rare. And that was the way it was throughout the rest of lunch. At Texas de Brazil or Fogo de Chaos, they always re-roasted the meat when they brought it back to the kitchen. At Pampas, they rarely (no punt intended) do that so all you got cold, under seasoned, under cooked meat. Funny thing we noticed that for a meat joint, most of the customers (including myself) kept requesting grilled shrimp because it was the only thing considered good to eat.  Now let's talk about service. Since this place is like dead, they kinda copied that feeling into their service. Even though the place wasn't crowded at all, it took the waitress a freaking long time to refill my soda. Everything we asked for something, it took her so long to get it even though she wasn't busy. How do I know she wasn't busy???? Well, because she would go back behind the bar counter, right in front my my view, to either count tips, put on make up, check and text somebody from her phone. Our waitress didn't come by often either, so you can imagined everything took a long time for them to bring it to us. Even though she wasn't rude and got what we asked for (eventually), the lack of care, service, and depressing environment just made everything worse.  For those that visit Vegas and think this Pampas is good, you gotta spend some taxi money (about $15)  and visit Fogo de Chaos or Texas de Brazil. The food quality that you get at either place will make the taxi fare worth it. Trust me :-)",

Salmon and the shrimp was the best. Mahi Mahi was over cooked.   Cons - Portion size is too much. Like another reviewer said, it's all about quantity vs quality. If I'm going to end up paying $130+ for 2 person, I'd stick w Texas De Brazil or Fogo De Chao (it be cheaper and way better food)  - Majority of the meat I had was too well done making it hard and chewy. BBQ pork wreaked of BO aftertaste. Thank goodness it came last cause I lost my appetite. I literally thought the smell was from the waiter but I was wrong lol  - Floor is super slippery  - Bar selection is not great (food and space wise). The layout and area is so small that you have people running into each other. Most places give you certain appetizers (bread, mashed potato and fried banana) but it was served buffet style. The fried banana was gross because it just like they breaded a regular banana vs using plantain.   - Dessert was not great. Even the mint leaves were not fresh.   - Service is lacking.",

I mean, come on, it's rodizio, right?  Well, in a fitting tale of \"not all rodizio is created equal,\" we learned that - indeed - Pampas is no Rum Jungle (GOOD GAWD, I miss that place).  We had a reservation and didn't have to wait too too long.  Our waiter was a nice enough guy, but kinda felt like he was a banker or trader for a long time and had to take this gig to get a paycheck...it felt like he was partially checked out for most of the meal.  The sides/salad bar was OK...I am not a huge fan of filling up when there is meat to be had...but there I was eating Tortilla Soup, (lousy) peel and eat shrimp and (delicious) Asian Noodle Salad.  But we came for the meat...and I couldn't have been more disappointed.  What we loved about Rum Jungle is what we greatly disliked about this place.  The meats had no flavor.  Now I love a good steak...salt, pepper and a grill...no problem.  But here, I wanted marinated meats...I wanted spice rubbed meats...I wanted flavor...I wanted effort.  Adding to that was there really wasn't any in-between as far as \"done\" goes...rare or well...nothing else.    The beefs were OK, the lamb was good, the chicken was too salty, the shrimp were disappointing, the scallops were a bit underdone...not what you expect for $40/pp.  And a last note...there were certain meats we saw over and over...and others we only saw once...bad balance...they need a better routine.  2 Stars and lucky to get the second.",

I decided this was going to call for a drink and went to the bar to order a couple glasses of wine for my husband and I. Thank goodness two nice guys were about to be done so we ended up taking their seats at the bar so we would not have to wait even longer.  As we sat there, we noticed every single server, bartender, manager, etc was running around like chickens with their heads cut off. There was one bartender making drinks for the entire 300+ person restaurant. They ran out of clean glasses and ended up serving in plastic cups, quite comical!  The salad bar was subpar and not authentic Brazilian Churrascaria salad bar like Fogo De Chao. The meat was tough and not flavorful. Even the floors were slippery and felt like they hadn't been cleaned in days.

    "text": "Within the Miracle Mile shops at Planet Hollywood there are probably 10 sit-down restaurant options - more so than your average LV casino/resort.  So with so many choices, we were a little disappointed in our choice on Saturday night.   This was our first experience to the Brazilian steakhouse concept (think Fogo De Chao etc).  The main entree is an endless parade of skewers to your table where the meat, seafood, chicken is taken off the large skewer for you.    At Pampas, the salad bar and sides were excellent although the area was small in size and thus crowded at times.  The salad bar is a square with no real beginning.  Thus, if it's crowded, jumping in somewhere was difficult. This was a Saturday, in Las Vegas, with a concert at the PH live venue.   As for the main entree, the steaks were tough.  Really, really tough.  Flavorful, but very hard to chew.  The lamb was good, and the chicken also good.  However folks, the price of this meal is just under $40 pp.  In all, the food quality, although plentiful, was not good enough to warrant the price.   Also, our waiter emphasized the value of getting a bottle of their house wine and we could take our unfinished portion anywhere in Vegas.  We are experienced travelers, restaurant goers etc and he caught us with our guard down.  We ordered the bottle half-way through our meal, in lieu of a second round of wine by the glass.  We do understand that a reasonably priced bottle is often a better value than wine by the glass, if the table is drinking the same (red v. white).   In this case, we made a mistake because we didn't finish the bottle as we were heading home the next evening.  We knew better but...still.  (It's like making that one extra bet at the casino where that tiny voice says no...but the larger, alcohol influenced part of the brain says go for it...and the result:  not so good!).",

The carving of the meat right at our table was quite the experience and we just had to stop it before there was just too much to eat. The cheesecake--dear God, the cheesecake! We shared one because the portions are large and the dessert was so rich and fresh! And the raspberry Mohito... to die for. If you haven't tried this spot, you MUST give it a shot. Inside the Planet Hollywood shops--it's a experience that you won't soon forget!",

I was disappointed that there wasn't any salmon at the salad bar, which has been a normal feature for both lunch and dinner at the other Brazilian steakhouse in town. Most of the meat was good, especially the sirloin cut, which is my favorite, and the chicken with bacon. The other meats were on the dry side, especially the tri-tip, which we just couldn't eat after one bite.The salad bar was good as the other Brazilian restaurants and didn't have as many things that I would've liked. I don't know if I would go back.",

The atmosphere is great for a relax and dine. The salad bar is an excellent thing to have. Make sure not to fill up on the sides because there is a lot to eat here.  Have drinking packages starting with $20 for unlimited drinks, take advantage and order more and more. Other than that. We were served by Nicole who was very kind and sweet to my family, knows what she is talking about and easy on the eyes. She'd be 5* on Yelp.",

We usually saw the same 4 meats and only saw a total of 7 different meats, one of which was pineapple (not a meat). The Tri tip and sirloin were both good, but the others were just ok.    The salad bar was a big disappointment.  Not much of a selection for a higher priced restaurant.   For two of us, our bill came to $117 which includes my 20% tip. Not worth the money to eat here. We only tried it to experience a Brazilian steakhouse.   Advise: if you want great meat,  spend the money and go to one of the amazing steakhouses around the strip. Heritage steaks at the Mirage is amazing. (No I don't work for them)",

After reading the reviews we had really low expectations, we were even scare of showing Amber our vouchers and to ask for our wine or sangria. Once we show her the voucher we joke with her about it and she actually was pretty nice about it, the voucher and the special price we paid didn't affect the service or the food we got. We went to get our salads, I have to admit that the salad bar doesn't compare with  other places I've tried in Vegas ( more expensive ones), but for the price the sides and salads were good, we just added  some salt and pepper to the mash potatoes and it was really good.When the meat started coming it didn't stop until we were full and switched our green sign to red. Everything we tried was really good juicy and well seasoned, the only thing that we all agree it was too strong it was a garlic steak. Over all for the price we paid we had a great experience, we are already planning to go back with a larger group.",

Good meat, good prices and good service at about $35 a person with the coupon.  Now for the picture...  The free dessert was pretty bad. It was a piece of white crack with coconut and not too interesting. Kind of thought we'd get a choice of some of the desserts we had seen being offered. Certainly not worth typing a review. Also, we bought a coupon from one of the kiosks. When the bill came we were encouraged to tip for the pre- coupon price of about $250. The dinner wasn't worth anywhere near that and with so many buffets around I don't think we'll be coming again. We tipped $21 which I thought was more adequate.",

I had never eaten  there before so I don't know how the service is compared to a full paying customer.  I did upgrade our meals  to the all you can eat meat  , and was pleased with what I got .   What I wasn't pleased with and it's very small was the fact that there is a water conservation charge if you drink water...... water that they give to you without you asking for it and without telling you there will be a charge. It is mentioned  on the menu but it will not be pointed out to you . The charge is only $2.00 but it's the fact that you wouldn't let your customer  know before hand that you are gonna charge for thirst quenching , life saving , FREE, water . The table next to me was a voucher couple as well they complained to the manager and got it removed. I wild have too if it was higher priced and I'm sure that's what they are counting on , that the price isn't high enough to care.  Unfortunately for the server it did cost him a bit of a tip just because I would like to have been told of the SECRET  charge  So it went from 20%-15% tip. On a $50.00 check.",

This was great because we had a nice variety and stayed full.  The waiters were also very attentive with refilling our iced teas.

We went here on time share coupons and and our waiter was completely inattentive and just didn't care to deal with us. His push was for a \"double\" on my cocktail out the door, which came immediately, and it took a good 10-15 minutes for the rest of our party to get their drinks.. That was how it started from there on timing was horrible... Meat started coming before we were ready and signaled as such.  The shrimp was not deveined ( major Poop vein) and the mussels were very overcooked and rubbery so they were essentially inedible.  And then there was dessert, we ordered coffee and espresso first then the tiramisu. The tiramisu was soggy and lackluster at best. The worst part is that we completely finished out tiramisu before the coffee ever arrived.  When we received the bill we had some questions and our waiter was bit snotty about having to answer them.  Then came the final straw, card was used to pay bill( tip was in cash) when we received the charge slip back for signature a  \" mandatory gratuity\" had been added to the charge slip and he had kept the cash.  We took this to the manger who looked bewildered and lost as we explained the situation.  In the end we got our cash tip back and left unhappy and very dissatisfied.  Don't go to this restaurant spend your hard earned money elsewhere. Vegas has many options to chose from.",

The meats are flavorful and well cooked.  The chicken is pretty good too.  The shrimp and crabcakes are tasty but the fish isn't anything special.  The salad bar is so much more than that.  It has some very delicious items: calamari salad, fresh mozzarella, antipasti, soup, side dishes, and the tasty cheese bread puffs.  The tiramisu is awesome, but the cocktails are sub standard.  Try it out and get a groupon or amazon local coupon.",

We got the Beef Special and well of course before they came around we got some of the sides that they offer and they are so delicious. Starting off  with the Cheese Bread and then moving on to there salad bar everything was divine. Just make sure you don't overfill on the side cause when the Meat comes around thats when the part starts! Trying the Meat we had 10 different kind to try from they just go around with it and give you a taste you can ask for how big of a size. I tried Lamb for the first time and that was so tender that Im a fan of lamb now. The roast beef the  bacon wraps man every thing was delicious from start to beginning.   And then came the Pineapple. Oh how can a fruit taste so good when it is cooked. I just kept waiting for them to keep coming around for more.  They also have Fried Plantains and they are so Creamy and melt in your mouth delicious.   I cant stop talking about this place. I keep Raving to my friends. The overall experience the welcoming atmosphere just made it the that much better. I cant wait to eat it again!   Absolutely Loved it!",

I understand the Ribeye is a fattier cut but my piece was over 50% fat.  bleh. In addition, my Medium Rare was VERY rare.  On the side note, the fries here are great! ironic, everything I liked at this dinner was non-brazillian related.   Some of our party opted for the all you can eat bbq but everyone wasn't feeling too great 30 minutes after our meal.   The highlight of the meal was their grand salad bar. Not only salads but had many sides. My favorite was actually the mini baby back ribs and corn cheese bread. I felt like I should of skipped the $40 steak and just opted for the all you can salad bar.   Tip: they have <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestauarant.com&s=fbf2d52ee66a51e28d19679099aefee3fd7402c2af53fc85962fd8f5ab411d56\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restauarant.com</a> or if you have the Planet Hollywood Hotel Chain players card - they will give you 10% off your bill.",

First of this waiter Juan was pretty cock-y. I asked about the food, he gave sarcastic answers, his demeanor was very unpleasant.  We had our interest on the skirt steak from other posting by orhers.  Skirt steak plate is 30.00 and came this very sad looking plate with about 6 inches very thin skirt steak with a line of rice which equals to maybe 2 spoons of rice and same amount of black beans.  To top it off, it was cold. At the end he explained the check, reflecting the discounts. He explained that 50.00 discount came from the resort, and 50.00 came from the restaurant.  Well, that was a waste of restaurant money on this marketing effort to bring people in if they're going to compromise the quality or quantity of the food they serve because one is using the coupon given. It was very disappointing,  and we tried so hard not to get up and walk out!!",

This is the only Brazilian place that I have been to that has fried bananas so for a whole year, I have been craving that and they were as good as I remembered them to be.   As far as the meat portion of the dinner, it was great.  I tried everything once, and some twice, and some about 8 times.  If they would of let me, I would of just had them give me the whole pineapple in the beginning to save them all the trips back to me.  I really loved the sirloin steak, it was cooked perfectly to where it melted in your mouth.   I thought the service was great.  Our server Dave, who we had the first time was fantastic and very personable.  I can't wait to go back and have more of their fried bananas.",

The wife and I had been to a Churrascaria the weekend before in San Antonio, and we're blown away. We hoped that for the fact it's in Vegas, Pampas to be much better.   We arrived on time for a 730 reservation, and we're told to wait another 15 minutes. No problem, sat at the bar for a while. We were finally seated 30 minutes later, and waited 10 minutes for our server. Finally the floor manager took our drink order.   The salad bar was not as good as places I've been in the past. The only item I liked were the deep fried bananas and cheese bread. Some items I usually enjoy, mashed potatoes, tempura, and Caesar salad all fell short.   The meat came around infrequently. Initially only 4 cuts came around on a regular basis, without seeing any other meats. We eventually told those guys to stop coming, and told the manager. Slowly other cuts came around, and we became frustrated. I don't think either of us got out fill.   The quality of the meat was poor. Nothing stood out except for bacon wrapped turkey, but then again how can you mess up bacon.   We spoke with the manager again, and he comped us desert. I had the cheesecake which was \"okay\".   I would not come here again unless I has another voucher, and if I did I would drink a lot of beer and fill up on fried bananas.",

Alright I guess  Service: Never saw our waiter but the 2/3 meat men were awesome! They were very attentive!!  AND.... You can't ever go wrong with the pineapple!! PINEAPPLES!!!",

After we finally ordered, we got just 2 cuts of meat in 45 minutes!!! A real Brazillian steakhouse would serve 2 cuts in 2 minutes. We were just sitting there looking around for anyone to walk by.  On top of that the cuts we requested never came!  When we asked to speak to the manager she was like people either love us or they hate us.  I can't imagine anyone loving this place.

It's in a mall and after 20 minutes of one of the worse service experiences I've ever encountered, we walked out. They didn't tell us the restaurant would no longer be seating in the dining room and stuck us in the bar. The salad bar was so far away that we didn't even see it. My husband walked over to the bathroom near it and still didn't see it, that's how unimpressive it was. No spoke to us for ten minutes after we were seated and then the one server who was also bar tending kept telling us he was going to help us but then kept walking away. We saw two meat guys in that twenty minutes and the meat did not look that good. Ooops, there was also a guy walking around with raw pineapple. Anyway, we had a Travelzoo deal and still didn't think it was worth staying. The place next door was great, served promptly and prices were good too. Don't remember the name though but trust me, go there.",

    "text": "I've eaten at a few of the Brazilian steakhouses in town so when I saw the Groupon for this place I thought we should give it a try. Often when we can't figure out where to eat and we've exhausted our yelp lists, we go to groupon for suggestions. Unfortunately, I was less than impressed with our experience. The hostess was fine as she sat us at our table. When our server greeted us he was very nice. We informed him of our groupon and ordered our drinks. The drink cart girl was very nice but a little over the top. We started with the salad bar and there are a lot of good options. When we got back to our table, we noticed that some people had markers to let the meat servers know to come to their table but we didn't. That was a little confusing at first, but then a meat server did finally come to our table. The first few times the meat selection was either bacon wrapped or well done. I informed a few of the servers that I could not eat pork and preferred medium rare. I'm not exactly sure why a high end steak place is serving well done steak as the main cook temp. Some pink or red on some of the steaks would have been nice. We did get the surf and turf, but were disappointed that it didn't come with the lobster. I was also kinda grossed out by the shrimp. The coloring was off and it looked very limp/weak. No thanks. However the other surf options were better, the salmon was good and the white fish was very flavorful.   Anyway, after a few rounds of well done meat, we did get one medium sirloin and it was really good. Although I was mostly full at this point. I'm not saying the meat tasted bad, because it didn't. It was on the whole quite flavorful, but there should be a varied options for cook temps. Medium rare people don't like well done people don't like medium rare. Offer both. It makes no sense to only have well done. The service was pretty good, although the table next to us had a lot of issues. She was also irritated that all the meat was well done or pork. We came to a steakhouse because we wanted steak. So sadly this is my least favorite of the Brazilian steakhouses in town. Step up your game, Pampas, the competition is stiff.",

It would have been nice to be given a choice. We decided to order entrees since it was late. The dinner service was poor the entire night. To begin, my family is French and have lived in the US and ordered water without ice from the server. The busser arrived with the water glasses and they were filled with ice, they asked the busser to bring water without ice and he rolled his eyes and said he would let the waiter know. He eventually returned with two glasses and we assumed he would return, with the other two, he never did. He was asked later to bring a glass with no ice. We inquired about the wines and the server could not offer any information except to try a cab.   The server suggested adding the salad bar after we ordered. It was very disappointing, two of the trays were empty and a few other trays were almost empty. I was happy I did not order the  buffet.  We were in the middle of eating our salads and the entrees arrived. It would have been nicer to have enjoyed the salad. When the food arrived the tables were so close that we had to handle our own plates as the server could not get behind our chairs to put down the plates. The filet mignons were dry and when asked for extra sauce the server returned and said it was impossible as the sauces were cooked to order with each filet. The skirt steak was flavorful and juicy. The bouillabaisse  passed the palate test.   Will I return? No. The  level of service was poor for the price that was paid. The second night when we walked by they attempted to entice us with a special, we all walked by, especially after I apologized for recommending Pampas. I also noticed that there seemed to be a lack of servers with meats for those who chose the rodizio.",

I referred to the  seafood as being \"abused,\" but john thought this meant it was so good that I was going to eat it all up.  \"Well abuse that seafood, then!\" was his reply. This remark actually made me giggle.  The buffet selection was decent, although I wished they had more salad greens.  The manager, was quite attentive, and he was quick to remedy the situation with the seafood by providing us with a freshly, properly cooked skewer. He even comped us dessert (this policy must be standard in the manager 101 handbook) We had the white chocolate cheesecake, which was decidedly more cheesecake than white chocolate. it was beautifully presented on the plate with a raspberry culee and mint garnish.  Overall, I would recommend this place. Just make sure that the seafood is cooked to order.  Overall our experience was reasonably pleasant. The staff was quite attentive (even when our \"go meat!\" Indicators were turned to red they still came sound to make sure we didn't want what they were offering).  Thank goodness for Groupon for making this dining experience more affordable. Otherwise, there is usually a Brazilian themed show girl hanging out in the desert passage shops handing out coupons.  Come for lunch because: A) it's less expensive B) you have longer to digest the massive amount of meats you have consumed before it'sp bedtime!",

    "text": "I'd been hearing from work folks that Brazilian BBQs are the bomb.  Being a vegetarian there isn't anything for me at the ones back home so I've never been or been able to attend with my carnivorous sweetie.   The nice part of Pampas is they have a large buffet salad bar with tons of options that are veggie and will do a vegetarian rodizio up if requested so I figured it would be a nice place to take my carnivore while not starving myself.  Carnivore man ordered the surf and turf and I ordered up the veggie skewer.  Honestly my veggie skewer was boring and the part I enjoyed was a few dishes from the buffet which was acceptable and I didn't leave hungry to say the least.    MY fiance was in heaven at least until the seafood skewer appeared and they put shark on his plate.   He was very upset to learn they serve shark as he's morally opposed to the shark fishing industry.  For this reason I'm not sure he'd ever make a return trip to Pampas.  I wouldn't ever choose pampas on my own accord but would still attend with someone who'd get the full experience out of it.   If you can swing it,  visit at lunch because the food seems the same but it's double the price at dinner time.   Lunch is kind of expensive for a vegetarian like myself but it's reasonable for the surf and turf or just the turf in my estimation.  You'll find coupons a plenty for this place -  from 5% off and 2 for 1 dinners is what I've seen.   5% is a better deal at lunch and 2 for 1 makes it lunch priced if you go for dinner.",

Their goal from my perception is to be like either via brazil, fogo de chao, or texas de brazil and their execution is poorly done. They don't use the round stop and go cards traditional of a churrascaria so you're constantly harassed by the meat servers, unfortunately you're not harassed by your waitress. She rarely came to the table and had to be \"flagged\" down several times. Beyond that the meat was just... kinda blah.. It was salty but not necessarily flavorful. They claim to have lots of different meats but I personally only saw about 4-5 different meats circulating. You had to essentially ask for any other meats they carried. There are too many other really good Churrascarias to be bothered to spend my money here. I won't return.",

    "text": "If you're not on the verge of passing out from hunger pangs, you should probably wait and come back later.  Because they'll feed you until you can't fit through the door.    If you've never been here, it will seem a little strange.  Servers walk around with skewers of meat and shrimp and stop by your table.  If you want some, they cut you a little.  If not, they move along.  Don't worry if you miss something or if you didn't get enough, they'll be back in short order.  The last couple of times I was there, I think I had the meat rodizio thingy, which came with a trip through the salad and side item bar and all-you-can-eat meats.    I like it.  I'll be back.  It's good casual dining for when you're (a) ridiculously hungry, and (b) don't feel like waiting in line at the Spice Market Buffet.  Tip #1:  Find a coupon for this place.  Otherwise, it's a little pricey.  Usually, there's a girl standing out on the Miracle Mile handing out coupons.  You'll recognize her.  Believe me.  If she's not there, you'll find a coupon in some of those books people are always trying to hand you on the strip.  Tip #2:  They let you bring in your own beer.  So hit the ABC store around the corner (on the Miracle Mile) and buy one before you get overcharged at Pampas.",

It was delicious! And we received a sweet deal for the amazing food. Our waitress was very attentive and gracious.

    "text": "I wanted to really like this place, I like Brazian stake houses and the format is fun. But they disappointed in several areas.  Typically, This is not an inexpensive meal your paying for the variety of meats and the presentation. There are always add-ons to up charge and increase your bill. Expect to pay $50 per person not including drinks. At this price point my expectations are higher than fast food so I hold them to a higher, refined standard to earn more stars, sadly they did not live up to the price.  I came in a lone without a reservation but was quickly seated, that was great since the dinning room was nearly full. I read the menu, people watched, started pyscho-analizing the sales technic of the wine lady, the photo girl and the way staff as they try to get people to take on the up-charge items. Why am I pointing this out because after all that I start fidgeting and realize I'd been sitting there 18 minutes without anyone approaching my table, now water or drink order, not wait staff visit, nothing. I had to wave down a waitress to get started, strike one.  The waitress makes not apologies and asked I fI know what I want surprised because as I mentioned the format is to offer you a bunch of other add ons and up-charging or upgrading your order. Most of the waiters I observed were working the crowd and doing just that, not mine, just what did I want. I placed my order.  If you have not been to one of these you choose which meat program you want and if you want seafood and other upgrades then head off to a mini buffet for your vegetables salad and other starters to fill you up before the more expensive meats start coming out.  Now here they really shine! Everything was great, interesting tasty salads, marinated vegetables, several soup choices that all smelled great, cheeses and some better quality deli and more. They want you to fill up on this so you don't eat as much of the higher cost meats to come.  The format in this places is to have a token on the table, often red on one side green on the other to let the roving staff with the giant skewers of meat when you want them to approach or let you rest. There are about a dozen meat choices that are supposed to be part of your meal. Here comes strike two.  Of the dozen meats I was only ever offered four. This was a failure of the management team, it was clear the staff had not pattern to follow or choreographed direction. They sort of wandered aimlessly offering meat to some people then disappearing to the back leaving many guests looking around in wonder. There seemed to be no reason or purpose, this is easily fixed and sloppy management of the dining room staff. This truly disappointed the most, meat is why you come to a Brazilian stake house, the format is variety of small portions that keep coming until you ask them to stop. They failed to execute the basic format correctly. I did receive tri-tip twice, garlic steak twice and both times they pushed more than a normal amount, bacon wrapped tenderloin, and roasted pork. I only got the pork because I finally asked for it and though I also asked for the lamb it never came to my table along with the rest of the selections.  Now for a few minor things which added to the overall negative experience. The tile floors were thick with grease and slippery, I saw and older fellow slip and fall near the rest rooms and I almost fell twice myself, this is unelectable in a higher priced establishment. Next the up charging water ($1) which was not a lot but thy try and say its a required surcharge from the city (its not). There were a number of other missed items not worth listing that all fall back to a poorly executed management team, poor coaching and poor monitoring to the dining room.   Food was good, what I was able to sample but at $50 a plate and up I expect better service and professionalism. I cannot recommend this location as it's surrounded by better restaurants just feet away. This location is located in the Miracle Mile near a number of other mid-grade and better restaurants.",

Unfortunately, the lack of patronage should have been a clear indication of what was to come.   First, the meat was just okay. They definitely don't serve as many meats as Fogo De Chao does, and the majority of them were overly salty and fatty. Second, the sides bar was beyond awful and sparse. They pretty much only had some wilted lettuce, mediocre cheese puffs, and some random salad toppings. Third, our waitress was horrible and never came by to check up on us. We had to repeatedly try to flag her down, and even then...she still wouldn't come over! So basically, service was completely non-existent. Lastly, the pricing was ridiculously expensive and NOT WORTH IT AT ALL! I've had much better Brazilian BBQ elsewhere and would NEVER come back here again!",

Brought my family here for lunch on a Saturday and was seated quite quickly. The buffet was pretty good with salad options, soups, and some brazilian options (including feijoada and fried plantains). The best item in the buffet in my opinion, though, was the garlic mashed potatoes, which is odd for a brazilian place. The meat is brought to your table but the servers did not come as often as I would have liked. I have been to other places where they were constantly coming around but I had to wait quite awhile for steak. The meat options were: chicken drumsticks, two types of steak, ham, sausage (a little too spicy for me), and bacon-wrapped chicken. The only seafood option was peel and eat shrimp. They did have two nice sauces for the steak (chimichurri) and shrimp (a brazilian version of cocktail sauce). Overall this was just ok and I am not sure I would come again given how many other options there are here.",

Please avoid this place.  Our meal was free from a voucher...but would rather eat fast food Chinese.",

They always circulated from front to back and thus always ran out by the time they got to my table. Feeling guilty, they would then ungracefully hack off an overly large piece which would inevitably be burnt grizzle on the outside and bleeding raw on the inside.  Salad bar above average. Definitely not on a par with Brazilian steakhouses found elsewhere.  Update: You know they are really in trouble when they've touted plans to open in Palo Alto, CA in the Fall of '07 with even the manager of the Las Vegas locale had no information and its already January with no further information forthcoming.",

    "text": "Pampas, presumably named after the Pampa region of Brazil, was a perfectly acceptable choice for a pre-show meal, recommended to us by the folks at Tix 4 Tonight. (See the other Yelp reviews to explain the discount.) Having arrived more than thirty minutes late due to a logistics problem* our party was concerned that we would not have enough time to eat or worse, lose our reservation completely. Upon arrival we were assured by the friendly hostesses that we could be fed and on our way in under an hour. Casting furtive glances at one another, our party of five decided to take a chance and be seated.  I'm glad we did so.  Our waitress, Michelle, did an extraordinary job of corralling a tireless squadron of saber-rattling picanha peddlers (passadores) who were all too willing to slice you off another portion of their allotted meat assignment (rodizio). Every few minutes, a wave of sizzling meat arrived tableside just begging that we claw at it with our individually administered \"meat tongs\". Those looking to capitalize on the premium offerings are advised to skip the chicken and turkey wrapped bacon and double up on the pinchana, pineapple ham and Brazilian sausage.  Also worth mentioning was the side bar that came with the Rodizio specials. Highlights include the spicy black beans and sausage, the caprese (wish it had fresh basil instead of dried) and the fried bananas.  I don't recommend going for the Surf and Turf Rodizio, however. An apparent afterthought, the strangely presented fish (platter/tile/metal sheet?) was ice cold, tasteless and uninviting. A shame really as I was totally looking forward to the bacon wrapped scallops. After making a mention of this to our server she was deeply apologetic and took it off our bill.  Overall the meal was of three star quality, but garners a fourth star overall because of the impeccable service we received. Thanks to hostess' ability to seat us within five minute (despite completely missing our reservation) and Michelle's vigilant watch over our table, we were not only able to enjoy a large meal in under an hour, but also had enough time to have dessert. I myself enjoyed rich cappuccino while a friend enjoyed the flan.  * Top Tip: If you're arriving here by taxi, do not tell your driver to simply drop you off at Planet Hollywood. Doing so will result in you having to traverse a near half mile length of casino floor rooms AND almost the entire stretch of Miracle Mile Shops. Instead I recommend trying to find a way to be let off closer to the end of the mall. Your lady friends in heels will most assuredly be thankful.",

    "text": "My wife and I bought a discount coupon for Pampas at Tix 4 Tonight on the strip. We were buying tickets for a show at Planet Hollywood, so we decided to go ahead and eat somewhere in PH as well. We paid $3/each for a $20/each discount on our choice of the Meat Rodziio or the Surf & Turf Rodizio. We both chose the Meat Rodizio for $39.95 (before our $20 off coupon). We presented the coupon to our server when we were seated and he was obviously familiar with it and he explained what our options and discounts were.   Plenty of other people have explained how the Brazilian steakhouse concept works with the servers coming around with the different meats, so I'll skip that part.  The food was good. The salad bar area was self-service and there were alot of options, mostly made up of dishes we were unfamiliar with since, I assume, they were Brazilian. Some of them were great and some of them we didn't care for but I don't think they were made poorly, I just don't think they all fit our tastes. No problem there though, we were trying new stuff. Overall the salad bar area was good.  The different meats were good, some better than others. The fillet minion was excellent, as was their very tender ham. My wife and I both loved the grilled pineapple which didn't seem that appealing at first but it really was! Some of the other steaks and meats, were good, but nothing too exciting or better than you could grill up at home.  We each ordered a drink to our table; my wife had an amaretto sour and I had a margarita on the rocks. We aren't drinks snobs by any means, but both of these drinks were undrinkable. We had drinks all over the Vegas strip and Downtown and we never had a bad drink except these two. I will give them the benefit of the doubt and say that maybe the bartender was sick or the servers have to make their own drinks? My margarita tasted like cheap, overly sugary sweet and sour and it tasted like something you'd expect to get out of a punch bowl at a frat party.HA! My wife's amaretto sour probably had the same sweet and sour mix in it because it tasted very similar. Again, I hate to sound like a complainer because everything else was pretty good, but the drinks wouldn't even cut it at a Chili's Bar & Grill. We didn't say anything or complain because we figured we wouldn't get anything any better.  With the two drinks and the two meals our total was $99.90 before the $40 off coupon. All in all it was a good meal and I think if you've never been to a Brazilian themed steakhouse it might be worth going, especially if you get a coupon. I probably wouldn't return, only because there are so many great places to eat in Vegas, but again, we enjoyed our food and our time there.",

First, the surprise came from fashion show tix4tonight booth. It was like 3.00 a person for a discounted rate for lunch.  Second, the service was great. Our waiter was constantly checking on us, and refilling our drinks.  Third, I ordered the Surf and turf. I am more a meat person than seafood. I cannot recommend the seafood selection it was a bit dry and a bit too healthy. I recommend the meat selection, the tri-tip, and chicken was great. But what really stood out was the turkey sausage, bacon wrapped turkey, pork tenderloin. These were really, really good. It was all you can eat and I was stuffed.  The salad bar, was a bit thin but i was there for meat. So i have no complaints. I am visitng again very soon. I heard during dinner then have 12 types of meat but it was very busy and you had to make reservations. Lunch was great, it was pretty empty and had no problems getting food or drinks.  I hate eating bad food, or bad service. We had no problems what so ever.",

As far as the food on the swords, I wasn't impressed.  Compared to other Brazilian spots I've been too, there just wasn't a great variety of selection.  The tri-tip was the best one.  The filet mignon was dry and the parmesan crust was AWFUL.  Filet should melt in your mouth.  I knawed until my jaw hurt, and that was only after I spent several minutes cutting through it.  All of the poultry was salty.  The turkey wrapped bacon did nothing for the taste of the meat but make it too salty.    The seafood was decent, but I've definitely had better. My favorite thing was the ham and pineapple, but only because the pineapple was so good.  It definitely wasn't worth the money we spent.  My one major gripe was the time between the meat presentations.  I felt like we were kept waiting so that our appetites would catch up to our digestion.  I guess that's one way to keep up profits.",

We made reservations and when we arrived, we were seated right away. You get the choice of going all-you-can-eat-meat or pay a bit more for a big seafood meal. Go with the meat meal because the meats are among the juiciest, most savory I've ever tasted and you can still get smoked salmon at the buffet (which was actually my favorite of everything I tried).  I feel like the meat variety wasn't as big as other Brazilian buffets I've been to, but again it could be the fuzzy memory.  They sell pitchers of Sangria (for an additional cost) which are great to split with one or two friends.  The only negative part of the experience was paying the bill.  We had some kind of passes from the MGM which were supposed to bring the meal down to $23 per person.  Granted I split a pitcher of sangria with 2 other people, I still didn't expect my meal to come out to $40.  It turns out the automatic gratuity fee they apply for groups is based on the price of the meal BEFORE any discounts. Oh well.",

Had to wait even though we had reservations and the hostess seemed not to care and just had us stand around for over 15 minutes beyond our reservation time.  Then it took forever to get initial table service.  Had a terrible waitress Renae who rushed us, told us she had to leave to pick up her son so we had to pay the bill.  When we paid the bill before finishing dinner, she told us that she couldn't leave until we left and was quite distraught.  She didn't clear our plates and her service was poor even though there was a mandatory 15% tip.  The tip should have gone to the men serving the meats.  At one point, I had to ask her if I could finish chewing before she bothered us again about the bill.  The meat was overcooked and dry and the salad bar was mediocre.  I left most of the meat behind and didn't want to wait for them to cook more even though they offered to do so.  The men serving the meat were very accommodating and nice however.  We were charged $2.00 for a \"water conservation\" fee even though we weren't given a choice and didn't drink the water.  Save your money and eat somewhere else in Vegas.  Worst churrascaria we have experienced anywhere.",

    "text": "My husband bought an Amazon locals deal for this restaurant for our 2nd anniversary.  We've been talking about doing a \"Brazilian meat place\" for a while, so when he saw the coupons, he jumped on them.   I made a reservation for 7 for the two of us. We were running a bit late because of strip traffic, and got to the hostess stand at 6:59, she said we were checked in, and had to wait 15 minutes.   My husband then ran to the restroom, and I waited in the most crowed lobby I've ever been in. He wasn't back by the time they sat me, so I went a lone to the smallest table in the smallest corner of OUTSIDE OF THE RESTAURANT!  You're kidding me right?  You're seriously sitting me in the hallway of the hotel/casino?!  I was livid.  But let it go, it's supposed to be our speical night. Our waiter came over and immediately asked if we had any coupons (tacky much?) but yes, I had coupons!  (It's tacky, I know, but we thought we had a good deal).  The almost unintelligible waiter informed us that the coupon only gave us access to the salad bar.......urge to kill, rising.   At that point I lost it.  \"This isn't what I was expecting\", I need another table.   He went to go talk to the hostess to get us another table, in the meantime, another almost unintelligible girl came up with a HUGE CART of \"house drinks\" gave some BS about them, and just about forced you to buy it. \"no thank you\" your sure?!! \"YES!\"  +1 star for the waiter being on his game tho, and getting us another table INSIDE the restaurant, and even better right by the salad bar.  Let me try to get something across, there is NO ROOM to move in that place whatsoever.  You bump into people everywhere, the tables and chairs are packed so tight you have to shimmy behind them.  Could you imagine carrying a tray of salad over 100ft back to your table?!  Not this girl.  Anyway, so we're inside now, got a new waiter, who was amazing, I'm ashamed I didn't get his name.  He was shorter, bald and had an Aussie or New Zealand accent, if you read this, thank you sir, you made our night. But anyway, with new waiter, we showed him the coupons, and he let us know that yes, we get the salad bar and we get an hour of open bar (well drinks, draft beer, house red and white wine). Ohhh, ok, that's cool.  And if we would like to partake in the meat, it's $20 more a person.  Well yeah!  We're at a better table, I feel like I'm in the restaurant, we came here for that, so yeah, BRING ON THE MEAT! So with two Blue Moons on the way, I go up to the salad bar.  I saw mozzarella balls with balsamic vinegar and just loaded up on them.  They are my favorite.  Grabbed some tomatoes, and extra vinegar.  Grabbed some of the Italian pasta salad, and a few containers of their cimichurry (sp?) sauces (for the meat I was assuming).  I love condiments. My husband had flipped his card to green, then went up to the bar as well.  Almost immediately, they came over with the meat.  Alex (also my son's name) had some chicken wrapped in bacon, and sausage.  I didn't know how it worked with the portions, so I got one of each for me, and my husband.  I was still eating my mozzarella while the meat was piling up on my plate.  I had flipped my card to red because I wanted to take my time, relax and go at a slow pace to the onslaught of meat I knew was coming.  Not my husband, he downed his salad, then started cleaning his plate of meat while mine piled higher and higher.  Even tho I had a red card, they would still ask me if I wanted the meat.  I had my mouth full, and kept having to say no.  But wow that sausage was good.  The chicken was very dry, the pork was tasty, and the other meats faded into each other as piece after piece was dropped on my plate.  I remember lamb, tri tip, ham, even some roasted pineapple and oh yeah, the sausage!  I was stuffed...and we still had 30 mins on our open bar.  My hubby got 2 more beers, and I nursed my first one all night.   Even after everything that went wrong, the service of the new waiter saved the night, and the food was tasty enough to make us want to go back, like today, but IT'S SO PRICEY!  We got a credit for the coupons we had, and the $40 we spent that night, the bill came to $130, but we only had to pay the $40.  We tipped the waiter on the $130, as you should, and he seemed to be appreciative of that.  So that made us happy. It stared out horrible, and I wanted to walk out, but we had those coupons, and it was our anniversary...so I waited it out, and it tuned out great.  But there is nothing relaxing or calm about that place.  When and if you go, just remember that it's a very hectic atmosphere...maybe you'll be in a better mindset then I was.",

The grilling made the fruit sweeter and more aromatic, and the acidity helped digest all that mediocre food, so you could have more of it.

She came back 10 minutes later and says that the a la carte skirt steak and lobster were not gluten free but couldn't tell me what on the a la carte menu was. I asked to speak to the chef.  Nothing 10 minutes later. Still no drinks either. We got up and left so I can't really tell you how the food is. They have the no wheat/gluten symbol posted on the menu, but it made me nervous, so allergy/celiac customers should be very very weary. I don't recommend  this place at all!!!  P.s. They charge $1/per person for still water!!",

Saturday night, we had reservations for 730, got there an hour early they got us right in. Ordered all you can eat meat and fish, wife got all you can eat meat. Food was very good, staff very friendly, drinks were a bit slow, but good. My bill after the voucher was 30 bucks. They have vouchers and half price deals all over. I would say make sure you have one. We had a wonderful experience.",

A lot of reviews ding the restaurant because of the upsell or voucher they received -- I'm focusing on the food which was not up to par pure and simple.",

I wanted to relive my memory :)   I had the meat rodizio, which was a variety of meats from chicken, pork, beef! The dining experience is authentic that they bring skewers of meat to you and you select what you want. Honestly my favorite was the sirloin, it was juicy and flavorful. The other meat were bland and very chewy. I was disappointed with the food, but I had great company! Oh and I had my favorite Brasilian drink Caipirinha, brought back memories of my time in Brasil!",

I don't mind paying but the way she delivered the message was I don't care just pay what you eat.. Service sucks here.. Still waiting for my food.Waiting here more than 20 mins for my appetizer...maybe 45 now .. Management needs to improve service get rid of this type of ppl.. They will ruin business.

This place is not comparable with the quality of food, dining experience or service.... But it does cost just as much.   The salad bar wasn't up to par because the selection isn't as wide as Texas de Brazil or Fogo de Chao. The cheeses weren't as good, nor the cold meats.   The meats brought around weren't cooked well. The selection of meats was mostly cheap pork or chicken, and I found them fatty. The sirloin, when it finally came, was tough.  Don't pay extra for the seafood. It's basically a plate of crab cakes and tilapia (decent enough) with some unshelled shrimp. Really? Unshelled shrimp?  If you're local just stay off the strip and go to one of the other places. If you're a tourist, it's worth the trip to towne square for Texas de Brazil.",

The salad bar was cramped and unappealing-for starters.   The worst part of the meal is it was twenty to thirty minutes between meat services. My son was begging for food I got looked over three times. I asked for the manager not once, not twice but the third time was the charm because I got up to look for her. She was nice and offered desert but what she couldn't offer was two hours of my life back so I could go to Texas De Brazil instead. Right now I'm feeling the service was not worth the wait and the food wasn't worst the price.     Our server, manager and busser where nice but couldn't over ride the other deficiencies.",

It's not too hard to get me to say no to a good meal!  Coming from the east coast, we have wide variety of Brazilian cuisine, so is pretty hard to impress me! Pampas by far the best option for Brazilian BBQ in Las Vegas. I have been to a few others, so I'm not just saying this based off of my liking of Pampas. I've also tried other places many times due to the fact that Pampas is on the strip, but assure you it's worth the drive!    Service is always great, and the wait is never too long! I love that fact that the staff is friendly, and does their best to accommodate guests . Last night we went in for a late dinnerwent with my daughters. A tired 6 y/o , and 10 month old, it was hard to get up and move around, but the staff was so thoughtful, and took it upon themselves to bring dishes from the buffet, to the table. Being that they were out of some, and to continuously get up was a bit challenging.     Our server was very sweet, as well as informative. She made sure let us know about the variety of meats, as well as any coupons that applied to us.   **kids under 6 eat for free**  I know many people shy away from bringing their kids because of the pricing, so it's nice to have this option.  We love the Brazilian cheese bread, salad bar, mashed potatoes, and the rice and beans are all very delicious. Lots of variety, and they are always  switching some of the items. The meat is always well  seasoned, and no shortage of there's someone coming around with the various options! If your more of a surf and turf person, or even seafood lover, don't worry they have it covered!   I highly recommend Pampas to anyone, especially if have you friends have visiting in town, great deals on Groupon, as well as a full bar!  ***Check in on yelp and receive a free drink! ***",

    "text": "Warning: Worst service ever. Please don't waste your money and and lose  your pleasant emotion at this place. You will be disappointed and upset after eating there. Their price doesn't match their food and service. Your money worth better places. You are welcome to read through my experience. I hope every one of you would think twice before wasting your money there.   First, We were given a hand written prize card out side the restaurant. The marketing guy said that the unlimited meats and unlimited seafood will be 42 dollars for regular days' dinner and 39.95 for dinners in Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. We showed the guy a $200 dollar restaurant gift card and asked him if we can get the Christmas price if we use that specific gift card. He confirmed yes. He also confirmed that the 39.95 price is for both Christmas Eve and day. So I made a reservation for Christmas Eve and started to invite friends.  So we, a group of 5 people showed up five mins past the schedule time. They let us waited outside for about 15 mins. Fine. That's bearable. Then they took us in, gave us the menu and left. we waited for at least 10 mins before someone brought us water. For The first time ever that I get to know that the unlimited buffet on the menu says 64.95. When we were ordering, I told the sever if we can get the Christmas special price. He said that it is only for Christmas Day. I repeated that the guy helped me made the reservation said the price is for both days. The serve apologized but said no. Then I asked if we can get the 42 dollars for regular days' dinner. She said she doesn't know about that price. She said she cannot give me that price unless I show her the handwritten card I was referring to. I didn't have that with me. She said that I need to pay the 64.95 price. Jerk, yeah, it was your marketing card you gave me yesterday and your front seat person who told me the Christmas price. Now that you just denied everything!  We cannot let our hungry friends just leave. So we had to continue. Then we went to the salad bar, I was surprised. it is just veggies with way less choices than it is at any $10-12 per person simple buffet I've been to. For a $64 buffet, you are offering me this trashy salad! Wow!! I've been to other Brazil bbq buffet. I don't want 64 dollars should worth.  Then as to the service. Our empty oily plates piles up high. The server didn't come until an hour into the dinner. The sea food is cold. There are only 8-9 types of meats, not 13 kinds said on the menu, so another lie! The meat is way below average. Some tasted ok, such as the lamb, but after the first serve, I needed to ask for it. They didn't come to me any more. Most other meats tastes like jerky, over cooked and burned.  When it comes to bill. I asked two other lady servers to grab our sever. From the time I asked the first Lady service to the time our server finally came, 20 mins passed. I am not at all exaggerating. Our group was going to leave if he doesn't come, since he has taken our gift card at the beginning. I was so upset and disappointed for the whole experience. One guy serves meat is super nice. He went to grab the meat that we be been waiting for at least 20 mins, and was no longer served to us. That was the only guy we appreciate. One other lady who helped us twice to grab our server was pretty friendly too. Services from the rest of the restaurant are terrible terrible terrible.",

Once the orders were done, I was able to get to the sides pretty quick.  It wasn't bad.  For a brazillian churrascaria, I would've assumed the meat carvers would be going around cutting up meats for people but in the last hour I've been here I've seen them come out once and I haven't even gotten any beef yet.  I would think pampas is a big enough chain to be consistent everywhere.  This branch needs to hire more carvers or cook more meat.  *** update :  I got full eating sides because I was waiting too long for the meats to come around.  I shouldn't have come in really hungry.",

Also, Total bill came out to be $108.69 and they put 15% tips at $25.93. Customer should be aware of the unethical practice.  $25.93 tips is only if the total bill is $172.87. They also use electronic bill payment method right at the table. If you are not good in math and click 15%, you should be paying 23.9% tips. I've uploaded receipts on the photo. BTW, Pichana was never brought to us even after asking for twice. I think I am going to report this place to BBB for fraud on the tips.",

I ordered the 1 hour mimosas/ Bloody Mary and did not receive it. After getting our plates from the salad bar (it was good) we hardly saw the waiters come around with the meat. We did not get the shrimp which come from the meal and only got 2 small pieces of chicken. Then we sat for over 30 minutes and no one came to check on us until my husband asked for the manager. The manger took 10 minutes to come out to see us. He promised we will receive more service and did not. Overall we thought the food was good if we had an adequate amount but the service was absolutely horrible",

    "text": "So I purchased my fiance a packaged theater/dinner combo at the Zappo's theater... The options were Pampas or an Italian Restaurant (I can't remember the name offhand).  Apparently, we chose wrong. After waiting 25 minutes to be seated, they finally took us in. The waiter (tall guy, mid 30s, black hair, bearded, heavy accent) , walked up to us with a huge smile on his face and greeted us as one would hope to be greeted. However, that instantly changed the moment he saw our voucher for the free dinner. Not only did he NOT ONCE check in on us... He didn't even bother to ask us if we wanted anything to drink.  He literally said, your vouchers are good for chicken, steak, or salmon and you get unlimited salad bar, all the way at the end over there to the right. He pointed and then left. We didn't hear from him again, until over an hour later as we were getting ready to leave. This was probably the most disrespectful treatment I've ever received whilst dining. I advise to all reading this, to please avoid this place. I will be deterring all my friends and family away from this place. It's very offensive he discriminated against us because he must have thought we were cheap or something.  We will never be back.   P.S. The food was maybe a 2/5 ...",

I've been to other Brazilian steakhouses in other states and they've always been quite impressive so when we passed by this one, in Vegas of all cities, I immediately assumed the food would be fantastic but I was wrong.  First of all, we paid $1 per person for a bottle of water that was supposed to be unlimited but here's the catch, our waiter never came back to refill our bottle of water.  I'm pretty sure it wasn't anything special either and it was quite small for 2 people to share and never get a refill.  We had the meat rodizio (a parade of meats until you are full) which came with the Market station sides. The Market station boosted a great selection of cold and hot sides and they were okay. Nothing special. The meats, I really only like the first one which was a medium rare steak cut. The rest of the meat parade was okay at best. The chicken were fairly dry and lacking in flavor.   Wait service wasn't great. The overall restaurant was clean but the service was lacking. Like I mentioned earlier, we didn't get any drink refills and he didn't even come back to ask if we had everything we needed during our meal. He dropped off a drink I had ordered and then was gone the entire time.  We sat and waited a while to even get our check. We didn't go back during our 6-day stay and I can't really recommend it.",

    "text": "So to start off, in just the past 3 months I have been to 4 different Brazilian Steak Houses. So I guess you can say my husband and I go to a lot of them. this is definitely the WORST ONE EVER!!!   We bought a Groupon and honestly didn't read the reviews at all. I just assumed it would be good because we have been to so many over the years and never had walked out dissatisfied.   The Salad Bar is pretty standard. No complaints there.   Our Groupon came with endless sangrias for one hour!!! Very delicious.   Our Server, Paris, was very friendly and on point with our drinks. She has the personality to be working at a wayyyy better establishment. We still took care of her.   Also Rich, who was one of the gentleman that brought out meat to us was very helpful and nice.   These two employees are the reasons why I didn't give a one star. Unfortunately we came for the meat. I'm not sure if they were understaffed or don't know how to cook the meat.   The meat was charred on a very thin layer on the outside and rare underneath. Meaning they turned up the flames to put meat out quick and was actually just burning the steaks on the outside. As soon as they cut the meat at the table  it was just raw underneath. Not even medium just raw. Just went from burnt to raw. I didn't eat a lot of the meat because it wasn't cooked. Each time someone came by I asked if I could get medium well or well. No one brought my well until I asked Rich. He personally cooked me some and plated it and brought it to me. True service.   My Husband and I also got to enjoy and cheesecake as well. It was pretty good. Maybe do away with the green sauce on the plate. Kind of takes away of the strawberry and Cheesecake. Other than that it was good.   Thank you Paris and Rich for the outstanding service.",

They charge $1 per bottle of water- which is TAP water in re-used sparkling water bottles!  I have no problem tipping on full value IF the service is quality... which it wasn't!  No one that came to the table brought a smile- they all looked like they hated their jobs!    Free drinks for an hour... we got 2... because we couldn't get her to come back!  Boo  Ok- the food- was OK.  There was nothing I wanted seconds of... they also didn't attempt seconds of anything at our table!?    The \"salad bar\"- also OK!  The salad bar was not stocked with enough for how many people were in the restaurant!  There were no mashed potatoes no veggies, no ranch dressing... the first time I went through.  The revisit to try and get those items- I grabbed some cheese bread bites... there was 1.  Ummmm.... annoying!   Three stars- but doc'd one additional for the water- that's just cheap!

They're very pricey ($50+ per person) so when I visited vegas i was quite excited to find brazillian steak house for $15 per person with the discount from half price tickets (normally $23) for lunch. Lunch started at 11:30 and we were sat right at 11:30. The waiter didnt seem like she really knew the ins and outs of the restaurant and they charged more if you wanted the seafood. So off the bat this place seemed a little odd.  Our waiter told us there was the salad bar and what not in the back so we went back there surprised to find they were serving brunch items. Mid through our meal they switched out the food slowly with the lunch foods (mashed potatos, plantains, mushrooms etc). Now heres the crazy stuff. It took about 20 min for us to get the first serving of meat then after that, NOTHING! We then realized we didnt have that little stop go paper you normally get to let the servers know we want meat. We remedied that situation by swiping one from an empty table and signaled for meat.   Alas, 30 mins later hungry and sad we still didnt have meat. We brought this to our waitresses attention that meat wasn't coming our way and she said she'd let them know. Slowly they start venturing out to our table with what seemed like meat but didnt taste very good. So we're thinking maybe the pineapple is good but no..  How does one go wrong with pineapple? You burn it. Thats how.  Finally after 2 hours we've had our share of this place. Never gonna come back here, we'll stick to the buffet of buffets from now on.  Oh and here's a nice cherry on top, they charge $1 for water per person and it tastes like tap.",

Hmmmmm.., I know how about the weird ticket scalper out front selling 50% off NOTHING. Nothing at all.. The lobster that showed up 40 minutes late and ended up being salty with me? How about the all you could eat shrimp that pulled a Whoodini and never showed up... Or the time we ordered a Unlimited drink package and ended up stuck sucking down glorified tap water?.. (Don't you dare judge me, This is the desert dang it!) We we're so thirsty we were ready to drink Trump's Flint Michigan Bath Water. Don't order meat. It only comes by once every 3 hours. Do ask for the Buffett. Yum. But DO also  ask to be seated within 6 miles of it. You may be seated in Bunfun Egypt next to the bar from which you'll never get drinks from although you paid for the Gotdunlimited drink package!",

Our second day was a disappointment in the service and attitude of some of the staff. With many tables available, we were seated right at the door where my chair was actually sitting halfway in the doorway.  We asked to be moved and were put in a corner at a dirty table.  We brought this to the attention of a waitstaff and he literally just started at me. He then argued the glass was clean and wiped the crumbs on the table onto the floor with his hand. They were out of several item on the buffet, but the meat service was better than the day before and our new waitress was very nice.  Bottom line, it's a good brunch bargain, and the meats are delicious, but some of the staff needs better training.",

The waitress said they don't have ginger ale but she can make it. Huh!!! So you can make ginger ale, ok. So we found out her trick was to mix cola and sprite after she literally went back and forth with my sister(can you say uncomfortable) that she didn't use Coca Cola.   Their choices of sides are gross. The best thing were the mashed potatoes. Salad bar was weak. Hot foods were seriously lacking flavor. The meat selection was boring. All I saw was 2 choices of chicken and 5 choices of beef. Where was the lamb??!! The meat seemed to come out every 8-10 minutes. There were many times where we sat without any meat and just sides.   All around a bad experience",

    "text": "Reservations were easy to make but the hostess I spoke to was more on the condescending side with her questions. We had purchased a Groupon for two for surf and turf, a desert, and all you can drink for one hour.   We were seated relatively quickly. Then the dining experience began. We waited for over 5 minutes for our server to come to the table only to say she was going to get us water then be back. Okay, no problem. She comes back and we inform her we have the Groupon. She immediately becomes rude and when I tried to order a drink she said \"Wait a minute. The Groupon is a process.\" Okay....sorry? She finally takes our drink orders then quickly explained the process of the dining experience to where we didn't completely understand what would happen.   We went and got plates at the salad bar and their selection was sub par. A few dressings, barely any toppings for salad, and when I went to the cheese section they had empty holes in the ice where the cheese was supposed to be. The meats were okay, some were way too salty and ended up drying out. The ham and the pineapple were the only two items that were absolutely delicious.   Our server told us that halfway through our meal we would receive the surf part of the surf and turf. After being there almost 45 minutes, I asked about it and she said \"Oh you didn't get it? Ha I didn't even notice that. I'll put it in for you right now.\" She then gave us choices for desert and we picked the chocolate explosion cake. Our surf arrived and everything was completely cold, mixing the poke with mussels in the same bowl? The unfried fish was slimy and smelled horrible. Our desert tasted completely like powdered sugar.   For the all you can drink, we got 4 drinks. She was always \"waiting on the bar\" and barely came to check on us at all the entire time. The service was HORRIBLE. I am not one to get a manager but I was so beyond disappointed in this place.   Spend your money elsewhere. Not worth it.",

    "text": "First time at Pampas,  but not new to the Brazillian steakhouse experience.  The salad bar is actually pretty good for one of these types of places - the cheese bread rocked!  Great pasta and rice options.  Amber was our server, and was great.  Very personable and checked in on us at regular intervals.   The meat service was a bit slow.  They came out of the gates strong - bacon wrapped filet and garlic sirloin.  Then we got the pork sausage guy.  Then we got him again.  Then we got him again.  The pork sausage guy at a brazillian steakhouse is like your chubby friend.  Sure, if there is nobody else around, you might have a taste.  But... you put her next to filet mignon and nobody wants her hanging around!   Meat was cooked a bit more than we would have liked - after a few trips we began asking for more rare cuts, which worked out great.  Pretty standard fare otherwise.  Went to the half price show kiosk to get a discount on the dinner - for $27 plus tax and tip (and free dessert for this review!) It was a great value on the strip.  Don't be afraid to speak up or request the more \"high end\" meat, and you'll be golden!",

This sort of sums it up: the lousy Margherita that I ordered as soon as we sat down did not come until we were almost done with the over cooked dinner.    Surprise!  The salad bar has a nice selection of items. This creates a False sense of what the meal will be like.   But reality set in when the waiters started to serve the rodizio meats on the skewers. Only one item was medium rare, the sirloin steak.  Other than that, the chicken, sausage, lamb, pork, filet mignon ( a crime to ruin a good cut on beef), ham and other unrecognizable rats were over cooked, dry and tough.  Shoe leather would be more tender.   Wait I am almost done and my Margherita finally arrived. I really need a drink to digest this food. I take a sip and wait, when did 7-11 start making Margherita icee's?  The drink was all crushed ice very little drink. I guess it is a fitting cocktail.      Oh no. The bill just came. They put different tip suggestions based on different percentages.  So the bill was $102 and the 20% tip is $33.40?  What type of math are they using???   On top of everything, Pampas is expensive.  $70 per person.  Save yourself some money and go to a Mc Donald's .",

Nice selection of meats, however, I was only offered the lamb once (which was excellent).  It seemed like they offered me the ham or some type of chicken more frequently than the higher quality meats though. Some tables in the restaurant are in a better location than others. Overall, a decent dinner choice at Planet Hollywood. I would go back again. I didn't have room for dessert.   Also-- FYI: A $1 per person fee is charged for the water. Unfortunately there was a long gap of time where our waiter didn't fill in the water containers at our table.

    "text": "This is going to sound crazy coming from a vegetarian... but I just had a great experience here and it was mainly due to our server Troy! So the menu is indeed pricey. But they use an all-you-can-eat & all-you-can-drink model, so you can absolutely get your money's worth between your main entree, a buffet of sides, and dudes endlessly walking around with skewers of food (including grilled pineapple). There is a vegetarian entree, grilled summer vegetables which were tasty, and when paired with the buffet, more than enough. The vibe is upscale and cozy. The service is classy and impeccable. Bottles of wine are reasonably priced. Our server Troy was very cool, very down-to-earth, offered recommendations that felt genuine and not like a hard sell. He even knocked a couple dollars off our bottle of wine when we lamented wanting to save money for dessert! If you're going to see a show at V Theater or walk the Miracle Mile, this is a nice little spot to cozy up for dinner.",

    "text": "This was not our first time at a Brazilian BBQ spot but so far it has been one of the best. My wife and I went in for the lunch. We ended up also getting the beer and sangria special which also includes mimosas and bloody Mary's.  The salad bar had sone good options and the cheese rolls were amazing. But that is obviously not what we were the for. So on to the important part.  The meats were delicious and not over seasoned. The sirloin and tri tip were tender and they gave us the option to order it to our liking (medium, well done, etc.). Although I'm usually not a fan of chicken at Brazilian BBQ spots, the bacon wrapped chicken here was very good. This time I also decided to try the pork which was cooked perfectly and seasoned just right.  On to the drinks. The selection of beers on tap was petty good and the sangria was also good. If you're more of a wine enthusiast, the red sangria is for you. If you are into the sweeter drinks then the white its for you. We enjoyed both but gravitated more towards the red.  And finally the service. Or server made the experience exceptional and he is definitely one if the reasons I would go back. Elias was very attentive and has a friendly personality, a well as being very helpful. Overall, the experience was great and we will definitely be back when we go to Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Having stayed in Vegas for a week already, we've eaten out a LOT. Which is why I'm really saying something when I say that this was probably the worst dining experience we've had while we were here.   First of all, I was really insulted when a big, beautiful glass bottle of water was brought to our table, only for me to discover that it was most definitely tap water and the bottle had been refilled.   My husband and I ordered sandwiches, his steak and mine veggie, each with a caesar salad. We also ordered the loaded fries to split. Our order took much longer than I would have expected a couple of sandwiches to take, and when it got to our table we were semi-disappointed. The salads were incredibly wilted (but not warm), meaning they were dressed either that morning or more likely the night before. Surprisingly, the sandwiches were pretty good. My veggie sandwich was delicious... But the menu said it would contain portobello mushroom. I've never seen portobello mushrooms that small or that similar looking to regular button mushrooms (if you catch my drift). If I can give this restaurant any tip, it would be to at least cut their fake portobello mushrooms because when they are whole, they shoot out of the sandwich and you end up eating them off of the plate with the fork.   What really upset me was that when someone (not our server) brought us our food, we mentioned to him that we also had fries coming. He didn't understand us and therefore didn't check the kitchen, so no one knew that they never dropped our fries. Eventually the waitress came to check on us, we mentioned the fries, and she put the order in (it was apparent that she hadn't in the first place). They took another 15 minutes, in total we waited about 45 minutes just for them to bring us fries that ended up being not very good (they were crinkle cut-- I expected something more sophisticated or at least well seasoned), and instead of chives, they put parsley on them.  While the salad was the kitchen's fault entirely, I blame the rest of the frustration with the meal on our server. It was clear she wasn't very good at multi tasking or checking on her tables... Or putting an order in right in the first place.",

I was told no need to worry,  but upon arrival I was told there was a 25 minute wait and no one knew who I could have spoken to. After being seated, our waitress did not stop by for another 10 minutes.   The meat was mediocre at best and many of the hot sides were cold. The shrimo was severely overcooked, mussles were dry, cold, and with shell chips all over the bowl. Our plates were cleared once, and our server had to pause and move around some dishes to place our dessert on the table. Our table had ordered one cocktail and a beer, but it was not brought until halfway through the meal.  Overall, there are so many better places to go for the cost I would not recommend this resultant at all.   Go to Texas de Brazil and have a fantastic meal. This will be a dissapointment.  P.S. this reaturant offers free dessert if you write a Yelp review. Consider this when you see many 4 or 5 star reviews. They will ask to see the review before providing dessert and most people will have a hard time writing an honest review that they then have to show their server.",

However, my curiousity got the better of me and I and a friend with a healthy appetite went to eat some steak.  The place was clean.  The waiter was attentive but they were not bringing us steak. After a bit we realized, our cards were on the wrong side.  I suspect some of the people who had service issues in their reviews may have self inflicted their issues.  There is a salad bar which has pasta, fruit, soups and all sprts pf other stuff.  They were pretty efficient and once we realized how seriously they take the cards, often watching from a distance, we got great service.  At once point our plates and utensils were taken as if we were done.  They got us new stuff and all was well.  This is not some fancy big city steakhouse per se, but it wpild hold its own in many cities, especially at some off the coupon prices I saw.  The bump I give from 3 to 4 stars comes from the good service we got.",

The waiters came around at a good pace with meet choices - pork, chicken, sausage and beef.  Also a pineapple.  My favorite was the top sirloin, moist and tasty and cooked just right.  The pork was juicy and tasty as well.  The flank steak was a bit tough for me.   The filet wrapped in bacon and the brisket were also cooked just right.   The salad bar was okay - there were plenty ofoverall, not  offerings. The standouts for ms were the huge mozzarella balls with the tomato slices and the fried bananas.  No sushi or nanything overly fancy - pasta and regular salad findings with some hot plates (including meatballs) and several soup choices.    I ordered a Caipirinha which was a little disappointing as the ones I have had in the past were made with sugar cane rum - this one added sugar (my fault as I should have looked at the ingredients pre-order).  The waiter did ask us what meat we were waiting for and had the cook prepare for us - the top sirloin.    Overall not bad, but the price seems a bit high for what you are getting food-wise.",

Everyone had a reservation and were crowded in the center of the establishment. It truly was a fire hazardous nightmare. We were finally sat down at 8:15 which is pretty long for a \"reservation\" we made a week ago. They threw us in a corner by the bar where we got the worst service. They didn't even care it was a special event.  The food was really good! The first round at the salad/hot bar, everything was almost gone or not fresh. I had tried almost all of the cheeses offered, the cheese bread, the fried bananas, and the mushrooms. They were all luke warm but tasted so good so I went for seconds and thirds. We ordered the sangria pitcher which was delicious and reasonably priced, but took forever to comeout (20 minutes timed)   The meat was okay. I had a few cuts of beef, and a bacon wrapped filet mignon. They were dry and had blood dripping out of all of them. They were all really rare, or rare.. not medium rare or anything in-between. There was also no way to ask for more or less meat. The people holding the meat slabs were almost non-existent and never came by our table so I was starving and had to get up 4 times to go to the salad bar. I was still starving by the time I left.... Whenever we would get new plates and put them by the table, the server would take forever to take them so our table was filled with dirty plates.",

    "text": "This place is alright in our book. I sure do love rodizzio style. there is quite the selection of meats being continually brought out. This is awesome b/c you are continually being served hot meats (no homo lol). My favorites are the bacon wrapped turkey, the sausage and their grilled pineapple. They also have some various steak cuts, chicken, ham, etc. The one complaint we would have is all their meats are consistently  salty. It could just be us though b/c we tend to eat low sodium meals.  My tips would be these.... 1) Don't waste your $ on the seafood upgrade. For what they offer it's definitely not worth the money. i will admit the ahi was good but that's it. The one item they offered that we were looking the most forward to were the shrimp and they came out dry as eff. Complete and utter let down. Service here is always on point unlike Texas de Brazil who consistently have the worst hostesses.  2) Go to discount tix tonight and pick up your meal voucher for a fraction of the cost or keep your eyes peeled on Groupon for a 2 4 1 voucher that usually includes 2 drinks to boot! Lunch is until 4:30 so have a late lunch and call it an early dinner to save some $ :)  And I would definitely order a caipirinha, just note they are ca$h only (I think $5 + tip). They come out w/ a cart and make them right there. They are bomb diggity!",

    "text": "Terribly overpriced and poor service. DO NOT come here unless you want to kill time and have $$ to throw away. I regret not checking the <a href=\"http://Yelp.com\">Yelp.com</a> reviews before coming here. We came for lunch on 2/13/16 because of a discount voucher we bought from TIX4TONIGHT (half-price booth similar to those in NYC). Two of us both ordered the all you can eat meat ($21) lunch option.  My history: Been to Fogo de Chao in NYC, Baltimore, and San Francisco multiple times, once at Texas de Brazil in Chicago.  Very familiar and love the Brazilian steakhouses in general.   1. Service: Arrived at 1pm on Saturday 2/13, seated at 1:10pm, but waitress Ashley did not show up until 1:20pm. Drinks (2 glasses of water) arrived at 1:30pm. The restaurant was less than half full at this time, so I don't understand why it took this long.  2. Meat carving service: The meat carvers (only 3 guys for 20-30 tables) are bringing out meats every 7-10 minutes, compared to every 1-2 minute at other Brazilian steakhouses. We spent 80% of the 1.5 hours meal time waiting for meats to come by. I finally spoke up and alerted the manager, who said she will send meats our way. The carvers did show up within the next 10 minutes, but with an attitude.   3. Meat quality: The meat carvers are not educated about how to slice the steak (especially Picante, the top sirloin), and cut out 1/2\" slices that are very chewy. Out of the 8 steak slices, 2 are blood-dripping raw (I asked for medium rare), 2 have chewy tendons (taste cheap), 2 are fibrous tri-tips (I spit them out after chewing for a while) and only 2 are edible. When I asked the carver to return with medium rare steak, he complained why I am not eating the raw piece, which has a pool of blood sitting on top of it. Please see attached photo.  4. Meat selection: we were promised 7 meat options according to the menu, here is what we actually saw during 1.5 hours of waiting: -chicken wrapped with bacon is overcooked and dry. Bacon is crispy though. -pork sausage is good but on the salty side, so I couldn't eat more than 2 bites without drinking water. -Picante, the signature Brazilian steak top-sirloin, only came to our table 2 times, after the manager got involved. One piece was amazingly tender and the other piece is surprisingly bloody raw (see my photo). Quality control is poor.  -Pork loin is the best and most edible part of our meal. Juicy and tender. Only came to our table two times though.  -Tri-tip steak is fibrous and chewy, so I finally spit it out after chewing on it for 2 minutes.  -grilled pineapple is not ripe and sour.  In summary, even with the discount we had, this is NOT worth the money. I hope you read the reviews here and decide to go elsewhere. It is definitely not worth $21+tip+tax per person for lunch. Frustrating experience and will NOT return even if it is a free meal.",

As an MGM member myself, I tried a restaurant in a hotel area under planet Hollywood instead.  I was instantly reminded why I never stray from MGM.  Our reservation was for 8 and our table was not ready for over 20 min.  Our waiter was frazzled every time we asked for anything and mind you, he only brings drinks.  All salads and sides you go get yourself.  We asked countless times for soda refills.  He forgot my friends dessert.  My friend and I asked THREE times for cream and sugar for coffee and it never came.  Finally she had to ask the bartender.  The assistant manager came to our table and asked if we were ok with the automatic 20% gratuity that would be on our check.  We said no that we needed separate checks and we would tip as we wished.  That request was ignored and the waiter got 105.00 top for doing nothing.  Not even a thank you have a nice night to us.  He was never to be found and rude constantly.  Pretty terrible since the gentleman who come out to carve the meats really made the place enjoyable.  I will not return or recommend to other locals.",

Food: Way too salty to eat, way too tough to chew, and on top of that, the food came out cold. It was most definitely the worst steak I've had in my life.   2. Service: Slow, unfriendly, & inefficient.   We talked to our server about the cold plates of food we had received. He didn't seem to care and didn't apologize once. He took our plates back without telling us what was going on, and we waited another 10-15 mins for the food to come back out. In the mean time, we asked to speak to the manager bc the service was so poor. But the manager was no where to be found. When the food came back out, it was cold again, and this time the steaks were over cooked. When the waiter came by and asked how it was the second time, we stated that it was not any better. He just said okay and walked away. In the end, we just ate the steaks, but I couldn't finish mine because it was way too salty to eat. Finally, we were able to speak to the manager, but he wasn't any better. It made sense why the service was so horrible, because the manager, himself, was not up to par.",

We got a private room and were immediately seated.   Buffet of sides was decent. Nothing exciting  .... That's about it.  Cons: Food - meat was dry and poorly seasoned. Also, we got about 3 rounds of meat and they stopped coming... not enough meat for the price. I thought these steakhouses were supposed to keep coming as long as your card is still green.  Service - the restaurant wasn't that busy but service was very slow. I'll let that one go because we had a big party  We won't be back.",

We had a reservation and still had to wait 20min for a table because of walk ins wanting tables. Our waitress was good at explaining what was included in our groupon but after that she was basically nonexistent as she tended to her other tables. The sides were good but everything was barely warm. We were seated in the tables just outside the restaurant which meant the meats never came around. We were offered 2 meats in the hour and a half that we were there; unacceptable. The seafood was brought randomly by a guy that would just look around to see who doesn't have any. It was good but again it was only warm not hot and fresh. We had a couple mimosas and bloody Mary's and they were made well. The bad service was topped off with our waitress repeatedly referring to us as \"her groupon table\" to other waiters. For dessert we had the cheesecake which wasn't great but at that point I wasn't expecting anything good. We definitely will just pay the extra money to have REAL service and delicious, fresh food elsewhere. Note: while we were there we saw 2 couples be seated and just leave because service was so slow.",

I was in the mood for meat, goooood and flavorful meat. What I got was salty sausage, garlicky chicken, and everything bacon wrapped. What's with America's fascination with wrapping everything in bacon? My fiance's seafood entree was disappointing: few crab legs. The crab seem like they're weeks old. For $56 he and I would expect more, if not in quantity at least in quality. Service: Slow and lacking enthusiasm. It's not even busy.   Lastly, I don't care for our server, Craig's, snippy and rude attitude, especially when it's peppered with not-so-subtle arrogance. Boo, boo on you, Craig!

I have several complaints.  First, when you are seated, the waiter poured each of us a glass of water. After we all took a drink of the water, he then told us that this restaurant belongs to some kind of water conservation program and that we were each going to be charged an additional $1.00 per person for the table water. What a scam. Second, the service was so slow. The waiter comes to your table every so often and only gives you two slices of meat.  I had to constantly call for the waiter to come for more meat. Third, I asked for the tarasco steak and was told there is none. Fourth, when the girl comes to take your Free photo, say NO right away or you will regret it later. Trust me on this one.  I was with a party of four people and we all agreed that we did not have a good dining experience here and the water surcharge is tacky, to say the least. I will never go back and I would not recommend this establishment to anyone.",

    "text": "The reason why we got here because the guy at the information gave us a coupon. He sais that the place is really known for their Brazillian food and it's eat-all-you-can. My husband wants to try it. The service was slow. We came here around 6pm. The waiter was trying to sell us or upgrade us to something. I couldn't understand him. My husband just said \"Yes\".   We had the seafood which consist of the shrimp. My husbans liked the lamb meat. The roasted beef was not good. I think it was dry. The other meat I liked. The shrimp is my favorite. Just make sure you are readt to get your hands dirty because you have to peel the shrimp yourself.   The servers were okay. There's one server who's originally from Brazil. He doesn't speak English fluently but he can make a conversation. He was nice. He would always go to our area and always ask if we still need something.   We called our waiter then we waited for almost 15 minutes for the guy to give us our receipt. After seeing the receipt, it came to almost around $90! I was shocked and I couldn't imagine how it can be! Well the waiter put the shrimp into the bill. Horrifying!   Make sure you understand what the waiter would say to you before he takes your order.",

The food was tasty, but definitely not worth what we were billed.  !!THE ONLY REASON TO COME HERE IS IF YOU HAVE A COUPON!! I can't imagine having paid full price for both meals. We had a buy one get one and it still cost $80 dollars -we had no alcohol on the bill.",

    "text": "I definitely have experienced better Brazilian dining. My experience here went from to being okay to worse at the end.   Food: The food was definitely good. The servers were able to serve us fast. The meat quality is really good but some of the meats lacked flavor. I believe that some of the meats that we received were either good or really hard and dry. Keeping consistency is definitely the key.  Service: When I first came, my group and I were seated fairly fast. Most of the servers were kind but there was a server who definitely gave me a bad impression. When UNLV came for a field trip here, I was one of the students. The servers were very nice to all of us and catered to our needs often. At the end, I just really wanted some water or a refill on my soda so I ended up asking this lady server for a refill. The next thing you know, I get denied. She stated that she had to tend to the bill and won't be able to refill any drinks. In the end, I just left the restaurant with a bad taste in my mouth because of this lady. She was very rude. I understand she's busy and all but she has other servers she can ask to give me my refill.This person really needs to control her attitude when she's under stress as it was fairly busy. I did not deserve that attitude from her.  In conclusion, I probably won't come back to this place. There are cheaper and other Brazilian places that has better service and quality than this place. Don't waste your time like I did.",

The shrimp was horrible (I even had to try one) and we were scared it might make us sick. It said \"chilled\" peel and eat shrimp but it was beyond room temp.  Mussels were ugh, cod was crappy and uncertain what the \"catch of the day\" was.  We started with salad and didn't have a plate for the meat when they came by, then, once we did have room, we waited forever.  Meat was okay but there was only 1 that I really liked.  I don't mind the cost but this was extremely overpriced for the value and quality. Other similar Brazilian steakhouse have triple the salad bar and way more meat options with better quality. I won't be returning and suggest you find elsewhere to spend your money. Planet Hollywood and the Miracle Mile Shops have plenty of other (better) restaurants to spend your money at.",

The \"buffet\" portion wasn't bad, lots of variety. Nothing fancy, but a good spread.  The meat came readily, and when I expressed that I only wanted well done, an entire heaping plate arrived just for me! My daughter ate only off the buffet and grilled chicken and was delighted with that option.  The \"add on grilled shrimp\" that seemed so enticing on the coupon was the only real let down- it was peel and eat, cold and more like boiled, no grill marks.  We just stuck to the other meats.  The grilled veggies were amazing, and we would return again for the simple fact that it is a desirable location and decent food.",

I believe it came with ham, bacon wrapped chicken, tritip, sausage, shrimp, pork tenderloin, and top sirloin. This deal is $32 at lunch.   We thought we had a deal wth our coupon for buy one get one free, but the deal required everyone to order a drink, and we realized we ended up payoff very close to the regular price anyways. Our bill came out to $420 including our 20% tip.  Our server did his best and this review is not because of his service. But the meats came around very slowly and only one at a time. This was a big reason for this bad review.   Not the best experience here, but it wasn't the worst. It's the amount you are paying for compared to the service and food. Not worth it.   (:",

The rest of us were all done eating and still waiting for his meal,  Management finally came to table and made things right. Server was not worth the $70 tip she received from our table (mandatory gratuity). Not sure I would ever return. My suggestion to the server, Look for a different job because this job is NOT for you.

All you can eat meat is a great value at lunch time. Our waitress Erica was prompt and preordered our drinks whenever she dropped off our drinks (if you get there for happy hour it is all you can drink sangrias, bloody Mary's, mimosas) highly recommended!

I was really looking forward to trying the lamb and was a bit disappointed it wasn't the burst of flavor(I was expecting) it was rubbery and tasteless.  Did they have to put bacon on the chicken?!!! So sad...I was like \"NO!\"    I really hope they start marinating the meats more and perhaps let it rest for a longer period of time for the meat to observe the flavors of the seasoning.  I like the fact that they do offer photography services....just incase you have great company but remember for 2 pics I paid $30. So take it easy (don't turn it into a photo shoot!) lol  Why not?!

The food, the service, and the water (yes they charge for water) ain't worth it, when there are WAYYY better steakhouses in the valley. Ones that have excellent service, so when you sit down you will actually have a place setting instead of snatching it from another table. When you ask for a high chair you will actually get one. Or when you say \"yes please\" to the carver you won't be bypassed by the next person or table. Or when you go to the salad bar you won't get stuck in the mosh pit of hangry people trying to inch their way from the salad to their table and vice verse while avoiding the workers with plates in their hand trying to head to the dish pit located right next to the salad bar. Or some place that serves meat that is actually seasoned well. And has flavor. And for crying out loud who the hell charges for water in a dessert!! That's just unethical and desperate!   -the bathrooms are disgusting and dirty - the plates still had food/ gunk on them  - the salad bar is horribly confined and next to the kitchen/dish out.  - the meat was mediocre, definitely needs more flavor- if you tell me it's garlic, I fully expect to taste garlic.  - the service was about as good as their meat - THEY FREAKING CHARGE FOR WATER! But wait, if you check in on yelp you get a free hand crafted soda....ummm can I sub the soda for WATER????- this just kind of pisses me off.

The server initially was very helpful when were seated then became very inattentive as she was hanging out at the bar not bringing my Dusse that sat on the bar 15 minutes before she brought it to me. Every time we order something it was a long wait, mostly all drinks alcoholic and nonalcoholic.  The food, especially the chicken wrapped in bacon, was very bland and overcooked. Tri-Trip was semi-decent, and that was the best on the menu. The Mojito my lady friend ordered was watery and I'm sure it was due to sitting on the bar an extended amount of time.",

He sat us in front ( I believe to make the restaurant look crowded, but the back seating area, where the food was located, was empty). We waited 5 minutes but no server came so we went to the buffet on our own. When the server did show up, she was very nice. The buffet food was just average but the bacon was very good. The fruit,  cantaloupe and honeydew, was diced into small cubes. They also had slices of watermelon. Very limited selections.  All three meats they brought to the table were delicious. If you wanted any type of dessert, they charged extra. THEY CHARGED $1 FOR WATER..you had no choice to say no..it was in their \"fine print\"! We will probably not return.",

Unlimited drinks, all you can eat shrimp, meat, and a huge salad bar that was very fresh. To top it all off you get a desert. We were very impressed with how we were treated and the food was superior!! Amazing value for Vegas!!!",

They charge $80 per person according to the server, so with the coupon, it came to $40 each. Their website says Thursday evening dinner is $65/person. It should have been $32.50. They also charged for water without telling us.  Aside from the price, the food was okay. Very salty. Meat was very chewy. The servers seemed to always be walking around, but when you ask them to stop to give you meat, they say they are \"on their way to another table and will be back\" - but never return. Not worth $40 per person. Just go to a buffet. Better food & no begging for food.",

The service is very good and their customer service is excellent.  Enjoyed myself and although this price deal is only before 11:30 am, I got there at 9am and by 10:45 I couldn't eat another bite.

Slow, slow waiter in our section by the name of London. 30 minutes and asked twice to get water, one hour to get our first unlimited drink. The service was so slow, the couple sitting next to us never got water, so they paid cash and left. Would give more stars because the meats were good.",

    "text": "This was a bad experience. We went there for my wife's birthday and got there around 9. They told us they were still opened. It seemed strange as the place didn't see as busy as you will regularly see on a Brazilian churrasqueria restaurant. We didn't see that many waiters with the meats.   We decided to go in anyways.   We sat down and our waiter told us we could ask her for any cuts, or we could just ask any of the other waiters carrying the cuts.   First of all, there are no sides brought to you to the table. All of the sides like mashed potatoes are in the back where the salad bar is. BTW, the salda bar doesn't have that many options. And it's way in the back next to the kitchen. And not a really good sight back there as the is a window you can see in to a not that very clean kitchen.   So we got our sides and salad and came back to the table. Our waitress asked us if we wanted any drinks, we said now, and she later came with a bottle of water which we were charged one buck per person which I guess is fine. We also asked her about the meats they had and she told us 2 were already out. So we asked for pichana.   We waited like 10 mins for the guy to come and get us the first cut. All this time we didn't see anyone else serving meats. We thought that was strange especially because there were other patrons dining.   We then notice that it seemed that the waiters come out with meats like every 5 minutes or more. They are not constantly coming out with several meats being carried by different waiters. Basically one waiter will come with one meat, not coming to all tables that have the green light on at their table and the same guy will go back and come out like 5 to 10 mins later with another meat. In the inter, maybe another waiter may have passed with another one.   We also got the seafood buffet, and the only thing that was added and brought to the table was a late with like 10 shrimp while 4 other seafood cuts were supposed to be included.   The flavor of the meats were just ok too. We were there like an hour and we only got pichanna twice, one sausage and one piece of chicken.l as to get each one took forever.   To sum up, this restaurant is very disappointing. It is not a real Brazilian Steak House and Churrasqueria   Not recommended. For more than 64.00 dlls per person, might as well go to a better place and get a way better dinner experience.",

We had a voucher from the theater which allotted us the option of 3oz salmon, chicken, or steak with unlimited salad bar.  The salad bar was decent but nothing out of this world.  My salmon was over cooked but the sauce that came with it was very tasty.  The reason this restaurant got 2 stars was for several reasons. They gave us a glass bottle that read still water but it was very clear that it was not as it tasted like regular water.  The service lacked and the fact that a party of 2 had to wait immense time between getting seated and ordering and then again between finishing our meal and getting the check was unacceptable.  Our table and glasses were not cleaned well and I couldn't ask for it to be addressed because our waitress was no where to be found even after we got a switch of waitress right after ordering.  Honestly, if this restaurant had not been part of the dinner and the show meal I wouldn't recommend it.",

    "text": "We received a voucher for this restaurant and decided to try their lunch buffet. Three of us went for the meat buffet ($21/person), one got the seafood and meat buffet ($30/person). There is a small buffet bar at the back where they have some fruits, salads, rice, and pasta (included in the price). They also have some entrees available instead of the buffet.   Unlike a regular buffet, servers will come around with the meat and cut you a piece from the skewers. For seafood, you are given a seafood platter with shrimp, mussels, salmon, and tilapia. You can ask your server for refills for seafood.  Some meat that came around included sirloin steak, pork chops, bacon chicken, pineapple and ham, and chicken legs.  My favourite was the pineapple and ham. The salty ham and sour pineapple were perfect when eaten together. I didn't eat much of beef, but my family said it was very juicy and tender. The spices used for the pork was good, but there was a strong \"pig\" taste in it. It would've been better if they used more spices to cover up the taste. The chicken was extremely dry, rough, and overcooked.  The shrimp from the seafood platter was probably the best out of the platter. They were fresh and not too salty. The mussels were very salty and didn't taste very fresh. The salmon was very dry and thin (I prefer thick cuts). The tilapia doesn't even taste like fish.  The price is excellent if you're a meat lover, but if you're as picky as me, I would go elsewhere.",

    "text": "I'm just getting around to reviewing here from my visit last October.  We were from out of town (as I'm sure most customers are) and had a Groupon for the Surf & Turf Rodizio buffet. We called on our last day in Vegas to make a late night reservation (I think at 10pm), but when we showed up, the host table was closed and we were told that they were no longer seating and would be closing soon. We pointed out that we had called and made a reservation and once the manager showed up, he got us seated.   Even though it was their employees mistake to let us make a reservation that late, we were so impressed with the service and how they made it right. The manager waited on us himself and he kept his entire kitchen staff around to serve us. We felt kind of bad but they were so gracious and never made us feel like we were imposing on them, and truly took ownership of making sure we still had a great experience. I wish I could remember the name of the manager because he was amazing and I want to give him props.  The food was pretty good -- I probably would have given it 3 stars but the service bumped it up. The rodizio meant we got to try tons of options, and some of them I really didn't care for (bacon wrapped chicken) but some of it was really delicious. The drinks were also really good and nice and strong!  Overall it ended up being a great experience that could have been a terrible one if not for amazing staff. We'll be coming to visit again later this month and will be trying out the regular dinner entree menu!",

Most of the customers here were from that place.  The concept is great. Serve lots of BBQ'ed meats on large swords to hungry guests. However, the execution of this idea was very poor. Most of the meat that came out was very dry and almost burnt. Luckily the wait staff was very helpful and willing to bring us some \"medium-rare\" meats. The \"medium-rare\" was really medium, which was tolerable compared to the hard black rocks they were bringing out earlier. The best meats of the night were the lamb, and the parmesan filet mignon. Based solely on the food, this would be a 2 star place, but because they were so nice in bringing out rarer meats and keeping the food coming, they get 1 more star. a weak 3 stars.",

Nice mix of fat and tender meat.    The only problem that day was the service, which was very slow.  They warned me when I went in, so maybe they were short on staff for some reason that day.   So since they didn't come around very often, some of the good stuff, like the pineapple, just showed up once, in the 1 hr I was there.",

    "text": "FAIL!  I've been to a couple different Brazilian churrascaria's before and this was probably the worst that I've had.  I expect more from Vegas.  Perhaps it was that we were having a late lunch and were in between their lunch and dinner meats, but this assumption still doesn't make up for the poor tasting food, horrible service, and price.  Atmosphere: The restaurant itself looks great and has a nice ambiance.  The bar has several drink selections to choose from as well as you wait.  The restaurant is hidden between a couple others within the Miracle Mile shops located in Planet Hollywood, and to me can stay hidden.  Food: We had a party of 4.  3 had the meat plates and I had the mix plate of both meat and seafood.  I was in the mood for some good surf and turf!  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.  As with most typical Brazilian churascarias an all you can eat buffet style bar was available for salads, side dishes, and appetizers.  The selection was not too bad with some pasta salad, rice, beans, and even fried banana.  This banana was probably my favorite treat of the meal.  The meat I found to be very dry.  We sampled all the meats from the filet to the sausage and none of them blew my mind or were exceptionally good.  The filet mignon was the best one by far and was not a great as most steak houses.  The seafood comes all at 1 time with 3 bacon-wrapped scallops, 3 grilled shrimps, a piece of salmon, and a piece of fried fish.  You have to specifically ask for more of the seafood from your waitress, but more on that later.  The flavors were ok for the salmon, scallops, and shrimp.  Just not phenomenal.  Service: We were greeted upon entering with a smile and that's always a plus.  We were then offered a tour of the kitchen.  Sure why not...the tour is nothing to jump at as you take a few steps through a small corridor into the kitchen and see all the meats cooking above a vat of fatty grease.  This alone should of killed my appetite, but then again I'll pretty much eat anything at anytime.  I guess they wanted to show how cool the cooking process was???  Or maybe they want you to be grossed out so you don't eat as much?  Here is the biggest gripe the service from the waitress.  She took forever to just take our orders.  The food then took even longer to come out.  I thought that meat would come and go until we had to \"tap out\" due to over consumption.  No it came every few minutes or so as my belly filled with side dishes.  We specifically requested the filet mignon on 3 separate occasions and it seemed to come out just as the check came out...I'm on to your cost savings plan!  Price: We were given the lunch menu as we sat a little before 3PM and the plates are slightly cheaper than the dinner menu.  But of course when the bill came we were charged the dinner prices.  We quickly mentioned it to the waitress that gave us slight attitude before changing the prices back.  Lunch price is fair.  Such high expectations and such a let down...",

What an awful, awful experience.  The service was horrible and the meat was tasteless, over cooked and in short supply.  Honestly, there was absolutely nothing positive about this dining experience.  From the service, to the meats, to the chaotic salad bar, if I were the owner, I would probably sign up for \"Restaurant Impossible\" and see if they could help turn this place around.  Actually, the owner is probably laughing all the way to the bank.  If I could serve sub par food and charge $$$ for it, why not?  If you decide to try it anyway, do everything you can to get some type of voucher or comp meal coupon.  You will be kicking yourself for paying full price for the stuff they consider food here.",

Paul made sure that our event was a success with most of  our guests visiting from Canada enjoyed the concept of the bottomless servings of the endless meat parades served, cooked and cut to your liking. We definitely recommend this place for  the sumptious Brazilian style steaks- the picanha, and the cheesebread which is  house specialty.A second or third helping is always welcome as for the value of your money, and a satisfied palate!",

    "text": "**Summary**        - Quality - Perhaps I got a bad piece, but the meat quality of my rib eye         - Value - Save the Pork Ribs, the value of this place is horrendous. I paid $40 for a steak that I could easily find for $15 elsewhere. No wonder they're always having deals on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> or Groupon.        - Rodizio - Though I didn't get the rodizio dinner, from the looks of the meats passing by, the selection is limited compared to Via Brasil. With the same price as Via Brasil, the service and ambiance is reminiscence of your local Applebees than a fine dining establishment. **Price**        - $11.95 Malagueta Pork Ribs        - $39.95 Rib Eye Steak **Ordered**        - Malagueta Pork Ribs - 4 succulent pork ribs over a bed of black beans and rice. It was slightly crispy on the outside  and juicy on the inside. The flavor was delightfully sweet and salty. If you're looking for a small meal, this would be the perfect choice.        - Rib Eye Steak - The steak comes with their Buffet Bar that's priced at $24.95. The Buffet Bar is definitely not worth that much. I'd say $10 at most. I ordered the steak medium rare and it came out as so, but it wasn't tender at all. Somehow they managed to make the steak as hard as if it were cooked well done, while having a pink center.  **Recommendations**        - I wouldn't recommend this place at all. Rodizio wise, Via Brasil is definitely a better choice. Steak wise, there are so many actual steak houses where you'd pay the same price and get way better cuts of meats cooked right.",

I do not BY ANY MEANS RECCOMEND TRYING OR EVENGOING TO THIS PLACE, THE FOOD WAS HORRIBLE AND SERVICE WAS EVEN WORSE, I could have gone to the wicked spoon and had paid the same $90 price for a Wonderful dinner .",

So, we set out to find breakfast, but since we (as most folks visiting vegas do) had woken up quite late, we ended up roaming into this Brazilian buffet. We were pretty early for lunch, so the place was pretty empty, but that didn't stop the food from making its way to our table.  The sides at the walk up buffet were pretty diverse, everything from capreze salad to falafels. The olives and feta were fantastic! If there was anything missing, it was mashed potatoes.  The meats were equally good. I wasn't a fan of the not-spicy chicken, but the ham served with pineapple was great and the big slices of beef were yummy as well. If you have never been to a Brazillian buffet, be warned, their stuff is always extremely salty. I think this is just the style they make it in. It will taste very different from the slab-o-prime-rib at the buffet down the walkway.  Best part? Never ending food for under $15 per person! This was definitely the cheapest buffet we hit up in Vegas and it was quite good. So, great value, good food, go in the afternoon when it's super cheap and not very busy.",

I don't want to overstuff myself on the salad bar, so I could care less if there wasn't a large variety.  I had the spinach salad, some rice, potato salad, fruit and that was about it for me and the salad bar.  I would come back for the meat.

    "text": "I am due to be married next year and my fiance and I saw this place on our chapels website as a reception option, so prior to us going to vegas, I looked at the review on here and saw that they were avg 3. I was hesitant about trying it but after getting to vegas my fiance and I quickly noticed that you can get awesome deal through Tix4Tonight booths located up and down the strip, since we were able to get a good coupon (pretty much by1 get1 free), the coupon cuts the price down by 1/2 (orig-$43/cupon $25)  Mind you when we got the tickets the people said that it was a most awesome place to eat and sundays were to do it since their volume is minimal. So we made a reservation for 5pm and promptly were seated when we arrived 15 min early. the waitress we had was such a sweetheart she told us how our coupon worked and what we were in for 11 different meats! There is a yes/no indicator on ur desk so when the dervers come around with the meat they can see wether or not u want some or not. So we went to the salad bar, im pretty picky when it comes to some things so although there was much variety some things were intresting...to say the least althought the fried bannanas were delish! And the sauted carrotsmmm!   After we got back to our desks the first person came around with sausage and turkey wrapped in bacon, the bacon was a little salty but good none the less. After that was lamb, i recommend it with the sauce its like a vinagrette delish! After that was tenderloin, roast beef, fliet minon(sp?) One thing I didnt like was the fact that we didnt get the chicken to the very end, they came around 2-3 times with same meat options and we would say no cause we were waiting for the chicken, so finally when we were almost to our limit here came the chicken and it was magnificent! it was like a spicy and you get a whole breast piece. So after we ate, we counted back and noticed we werent offered al the meats but oh well what are you gonna do, gotta leave some for next time i suppose. But I recommend this place just go get a discounted ticket first! Its worth it!  Definitly an option for our up-coming reception",

Well worth the $10 price tag.  The stars are removed because \"Bloody Mary & Mimosa Bar\" was a huge letdown and not worth the price. First, there's no \"Bar\" as the name implies, they just bring you a bland cup of tomato juice and vodka with an olive in it. We had to have them bring a bottle of Tabasco to the table to give it a bit of flavor. The Mimosas were mostly orange juice.  Definitely not worth the marked price of $15, and still not really worth it for the discount they hand out to passers-by either.  And lastly, the additional fee for water ($1 per person) was not advertised anywhere.  And we were not offered an alternative.  Would have been helpful if they were up front about this.",

    "text": "To start off, if you were given a coupon/voucher from an associate in the strip, please do NOT go to Pampas. I can explain why below:  Service: 3/5 Side Dish/Salad Area: 2/5 Meats/Entrees: 1/5 (VERY SALTY) Worth it? No  My boyfriend and I were given so many vouchers for Pampas our first day in Vegas. What really catches your attention about the voucher is the \"Brazilian Steakhouse\" part. So, we were expecting a Fogo de Chao type experience, boy was I wrong. I should have knew something was up from all the vouchers being passed around.   The voucher allows you and another person to get your total meal for $54.99 (This is the price of the rodizio dinner). The voucher is misleading as it says BOGO dinner, which it in fact is, BUT in order for this voucher to be valid you MUST purchase the AYCE shrimp for $20 ad well. So instead of the $54.99 total for two you thought you were paying, you're now paying around $75.90 for shrimp charge. You can opt out of the shrimp, but that would make your coupon invalid because you are not purchasing the steak and shrimp combo.   Upon being seated, we noticed that they were playing trap Latin music like Bad Bunny on their speakers. I am not saying I dislike their music choice, but based on all the elderly and families present, they could have chose music that would better suit their audience. We waited about 15 minutes for our waiter who was super busy walking around and taking to all his tables. During this time, it might just be me whenever I go out to eat, but the tongs, glasses, and silverware they had our for us to use we're dirty. You could still see the good particles on the ware like it was rinsed quickly and not washed.   After our waiter told us about how the coupon works we did not really care much because we were still in the mindset of a \"Fogo de Chao\" experience.. we thought wrong. They had a very minimal side dish/salad area. Some of the side dishes (pasta, cheese bread, plantains) looked like they had been sitting there for a while. One good side dish I enjoyed was the crab salad.   NOW, the meats were something on  a lower level. It seemed that the chef only sent out the same meats with all servers each 10 minutes. We were so excited to try the top sirloin, thinking of the \"Fogo de Chao\" experience, and it was so TERRIBLE. The meat was so, so, so salty. It was like the chef grabbed a ton of salt and slapped it all over the meat before serving. In addition to the salty meat, the meat was completely raw. Don't get me wrong, I'm a medium-rare kinda guy, but the meat was so raw the blood kept oozing out everywhere on the plate. Some other things I noticed was how they had some weird choices of meat/entrees to serve, for example: Parmesan filet mignon and whole pineapples.   The shrimp was very minimal for the $20 up charge. I got a small plate about a little larger than my palm. The shrimp had skin on and head some type of all meats/seafood seasoning. Shrimp was bland and tasted over cooked. Obviously, not worth $20 for the shrimp at all.     After ingesting all of that salt, and barely eating to note, I was just ready go back to the room and sleep. Our waiter was super busy, it looked like he was waiting the whole half of the restaurant. By the time he came back and offered us dessert, he said he would come back with the receipt. In this, he was quickly restating the meal we had and quietly and quickly stated there was a $2 charge for water!!! I have never been to a restaurant where hey charged for water! Nonetheless, tap water! I felt bad for the waiter in the end, he tried to liven up the atmosphere after reading our faces of discontent from this experience. Please, save yourself the money and go to Fogo if you are craving a REAL Brazilian Steakhouse experience.",

One of the tongs that was put on our table had some crusty meat on it still (we had the waiter replace it with a clean one). Oh and they also charge you $1 per person for water! Really? $55 a person isn't enough that you also need to charge for water? Kind of ridiculous!  Their small meat pieces were over-cooked/charred. Yet their larger top sirloin were rare and under cooked. We asked for the meat to be cooked closer to medium and weren't ever able to have any of the meat cooked to medium. I'm glad that we had a voucher from our hotel to go there because even paying the reduced amount was still too much for the service and food we received.",

If you are lucky enough to get a BOGO coupon you can eat at this Brazilian Churrascaria, have an hour of All You Can Drink Mimosas/ Bloody Mary's for under $13 a person! Together you and your breakfast mate, with the coupon, will spend $25 plus $1 for water (per person). That is an incredible bargain!   There is a little buffet that accompanies the meats carved tableside. There are nice breakfast items like French Toast, eggs, cheese omelets, breakfast potatoes, breads, etc. There are also other items like vegetables, salads, rice, beans, hearts of palms and so on. There is something for everyone!  The meats carved tableside are very good. The sirloin is always a favorite as well as the chicken drumstick. Two types of sausages make the round, both pork and chicken, as well as a delicious ham. It is not as big of a selection as during lunch or dinner time but for breakfast and for the price... I am not complaining.  As for the booze part, you can add one hour for $15 of All you can drink Mimosas or Bloody Mary's. I normally choose the Mimosas, actually the Cranberry Mimosa! I like to say that it is filtering my kidneys while the champagne passes through it. ;) They do serve a regular OJ Mimosa so you can always ask what juices they have for the day to make your Mimosa.  For tourists or locals, this is a great breakfast find! I just might see you there. Just look for the  table with the Cranberry Mimosa!",

This place has a rather cheap breakfast buffet option that includes Churrascaria (chicken, steak, sausage, beef) all for about $9! It's the drinks that will get you so tread carefully. I think the Apple juice was like $5! There's an unlimited Bloody Mary/ Mimosa option for an additional $15. Service the first time was perfect. Service this am? Not so much.",

If there was anything to improve upon, the adult drinks we got were poured a little on the light side and the person that brought us to the table was a little too snobby for his own good (wasn't Tyler).

The buffet area are full of fresh salads,fruits,soup,bread,rice,beans,eggs,cheese,pastries etc.I tried almost everything and none of them disappointed me.Then the chief came with fresh roast ham,sausage,sirloin steak,chicken etc.The flavor is amazing.The highlight is steak,which is so tender and perfect medium rare,just melting in my mouth.I can't explain how satisfied I am.My husband favorite is bacon rapped chicken,which is very juicy,too.  As we eat,more and more people start to come.By 10am,we are all full and ready to burn some calories.Such a exceptional experience dining here and more surprised is they didn't charge my 5 year old son.Hooray!!! And we both feel full the rest of the day.Haha!!",

Lots of staff around but doesn't seem like anyone's assigned to certain tables (We expected this based on other reviews though). The bartender was our waiter and he was really nice.

Let me tell you, there's a reason their trying to salvage their restaurant with Groupon! The service was awful. They made us wait to be seated even though the restaurant was only 50% full. Once we were seated nobody waited on us. We had to flag down another server who found our server. He seemed busy because he would disappear for long periods of time. The shrimp had a really strange grainy  texture and the mussels were lukewarm which freaks me out because of food poisoning.  The positive was the tritip medium rare. It was really good as well as the dessert. My husband (the least picky man on the planet) was so turned off he stated if we never went back he'd be ok with that!",

    "text": "If I were to give a rating solely on the service, this place would have gotten a 5 star rating. But for a restaurant, we are here to talk about their food, and it is a total disaster.  I am a meat lover, so Brazilian Grills are one of my favorites. I have been to a few locations around US and Canada but never had I gone to one that I left 80% of the meat on my plate. The first round come a cheese crusted filet, that is cooked 120%. I feel bad coz of it was cooked properly at medium rare or even medium, I would think the beef would be a nice cut. But what we got was a super dried up chunk that is hard to swallow. Next up was a burnt, hard piece of ham that once I saw I refused. Then the server brought over this Bacon wrapped chicken breast that the bacon is crispy but the chick is dry and hard. We were ready to call it off but the next meat coming up was a perfect medium rare sirloin tip that sort of saved the day - well it's heaven compare to the last three! Even the seasoning is non-existent. And the sirloin roast that came after was decent even it's cooked to medium well. Then there is a pork loin that turns out to be the best one. I asked if i can get some lamb to end the meal, and when the server brought out the skewer I cannot believe my eyes. They were like lamb jerky, tough and dried with absolutely no juice or moisture on the meat. The dude wanna drop me a big piece and I asked him to only give me 1/4 of the piece and I cannot even swallow a single bite.  I told the server, who is very very kind and courteous, that their meat is way over cooked and I cannot eat it. And he just replied \"well that's the good thing about here, you don't have to finish it if you don't like it.\"  Sure but I still feel bad that food is wasted, and I still have to pay for it too!  So, one star is for their service. From the hostess at the door to our waiter, they are really great people. The other one star is for their salad bar, which is much better tasting than their meats. Minus one star for their main attraction. And also no star for their grilled cheese that my kid ordered, which is strangely two bottom half of a hot dog bun barely toasted with half melted cheese. Yeah, they even screwed up a grilled cheese! They charge $54.95 for an adult. We were recommended by our hotel to go there and we were given a 50% off coupon, which ended up only paying $65 before tips In total for three ($27.5 for each adult, $3 for the grilled cheese, plus 0.50 each for water. Yes. They charge $1 per person for water!!) If I had to pay full price for this meal, I will probably raise hell.  Final verdict - avoid at all cost. Go elsewhere if you want good meat. It is sad to see a restaurant that would destroy food like this.",

It was overall a disappointment.   First of all, our server never asked us at the beginning of the meal if we had coupons/vouchers/etc. but then at the end of the meal when I handed it to him, he responded \"this is why I asked you at the beginning if you had any!!\" I told him he never asked me, and then proceeded to walk away without a word. It's not like I was trying to be sneaky about how I was paying. We just usually hand our meal vouchers at the end of meal when paying. I asked the speak to manager. 15 minutes later a manager walked by the table, not even stopping to introduce himself, and says as he walks by \"we don't usually honor those since you didn't tell the server at the beginning of the meal, but I will this one time\" and continues to walk away. Never made eye contact with me or anything, it was so awkward and rude. So the whole paying for the meal situation was just a disaster.   But also food, such a disappointment!! For how much money your spending, at least the food should taste good! It doesn't. The buffet is very unimpressive. And the servers bringing the meat were few and far between. We weren't even there at a busy time but we were there almost 2 hours due to how slow the service was. At least the people sitting next to us were nice and they made up for lack of customer service. They were laughing and joking about their awful experience too!   And honestly our server was a nice guy, just not great at his job since he was new. It was the manager who handled the whole situation who I was MOST disappointed with. If your manager, act like it. I hope management reads this review to IMPROVE the restaurant. With all the dining experiences in Las Vegas, this place needs to step it up if they want to compete.",

If I had a date that was trying to impress me, I wouldn't want to walk into an area named the \"Free Zone\".  I am married with children so the free zone for us was brilliant ....anyway, the food was good. My family has a restricted diet but we were able to eat and get more than full. There were lots of veggie dishes that were delicious, but I don't believe that the salad bar has 40 plus dishes (which is what was advertised).  Nice place for dinner because, as most Brazilian steakhouses, it is all you can eat.   Con- we sat for a good 8 minutes before our waiter even came and acknowledged us. After 5 minutes of ignorance, I usually start my \"5 more minutes and we are out\", timer. He made it just in time.",

We went there and realized there were lots of small prints we didn't look into so carefully, but however it was still worth it. Then we realized lots of people were coming in with their groupon and found out that we could have even more value there so we asked to switch it midway and they had no issues.   The salad bar was great, they had artichoke hearts, mushrooms, tortellinis, fresh mozzarella, fruit, some hot dishes and them some (I could get full just eating that).  Came with unlimited shrimp which was at times were overly cooked. In fact the first batch we had was leaving a bad first impression, but we like shrimp and it kept getting better.   The meat and the shrimp was always making it to our table. Hardly ever had to wait around. The only thing I have to say is that it would be nice if I had a say in where they cut the meat. The outer parts are usually the more well done section and the inner parts were of course not. The moment we say yes they just go straight to cutting the area of their choosing. Thankfully my friend like the opposite so we can just switch if we needed to.  Some times some of the meats felt like it came out a way over cooked. like the chipotle chicken, I bet it would have been great had it not been so crispy.   Drinks were strong, the dessert was delicious!! Service was good.  Overall it was a fun experience and considering we weren't paying a a crazy amount of money we felt that the food reflected its price that we paid which was discounted. Not sure if I'd actually pay full price.   I recommend taking advantage of the groupon or the coupons that are passed out on the the strip.",

When we were sat, we were told the normal price is $58.99, but we would be paying $71 and a $2 charge for water and two drinks for a minimum of $4.5 ($9.) each since this was a coupon.  They stated our deal included shrimp.  I said we did not want the shrimp.  The waitress spoke broken English and either pretended to not understand or did not understand.  The shrimp was over cooked, small and had to be peeled. Felt like it was a bait and switch.  Watch your coupons people!",

We came here because of a Groupon for 2. I made a reservation, and upon checking in to the restaurant, my party and I were seated within a few minutes.   Salad/side bar is decent, though I'd recommend staying away from the rice and mashed potatoes trying to steal stomach space from the steaks and meats.   Meats includes tri tip roast, pork loin, pork tenderloin, bacon wrapped filet mignon, lamb, bacon wrapped chicken breast, salmon, smoked ham, mussels, shrimp, grilled pineapple, and grilled chicken thighs. Our favorites were definitely the pork dishes, all seasoned and cooked very well. The beef and chicken dishes fell a bit flat: beef tended to be under seasoned, chicken was dry. Aside from the mussels that were extremely overcooked, the seafood was very good. The one annoying thing was the frequency of the dishes offered to us. We probably were offered smoked ham 4 times, whereas the lamb only came around once, and portions were tiny (though the lamb was also an underseasoned, overcooked disappointment).   The service was excellent and very attentive, but at $50 a person, I expected a lot more out of the food. You would do better to go to any of the other buffets in Vegas.",

Pros - Ok price if you get groupon, <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a>, or other \"deals\" Very clean, great location if you're at Planet Hollywood Decent food selection  Cons -   Worst meat cuts of all Brazilian steakhouses I've ever experienced Smaller selection Dismal poor salad bar comparative to regular Brazilian buffets Service is \"rare\".  In other steakhouses someone stops by every minute, here you might not have someone stop by for a while, and then you're full and ready to go home - maybe it's their strategy.   Several times when I'd asked for well done I was told \"sorry we don't have it\". like what? Sorry you don't have well done meat?   When they do stop by you might not see the same meat cut ever again and since it's not self serve, you're S-out of luck unless you ask them specifically to bring another serving of something you liked, which may take a while.   This really isn't as much all you can eat as it is \"all we think you can eat while we have it by your table\".   But it's not just about quantity, like i said, service, meat cuts, preparation, and quality aren't nearly what you'd expect from places like Fogo De Chau or Texas De Brazil.    Pay a little more, and get gazillion more quality, quantity, and far better service.",

    "text": "This place was a disappointment overall. I've eaten at lots of Brazilian Churrascaria restaurants and this one by far was my worst experience. We found this restaurant through advertisement of a timeshare and were given \"free\" tickets for dinner. Upon arrival they were pretty busy but none the less we were seated pretty quickly within about 5 mins so that was great. However once we were seated we noticed all 4 glasses on table were nasty as if they hadn't been washed. We immediately asked for new glasses and pointed out a lipstick stain on one of the glasses. We were told it was because the cups were plastic and hard to clean. She returned about 5 mins later with 2 actual glasses this time which were again dirty. We just took them and decided to wait for waiter. After waiting about 10-15 mins our waiter finally made it. So we asked again about getting some clean cups or glasses to drink out of, he wasn't apologetic at all about the dirty glasses and still poured water into the dirty glasses as if we would still drink it after we had asked for clean glasses, so I reminded him they were nasty. We presented the tickets and he explained that we would need to pay additional $10 each to get the entire salad bar and all the meat service. So we agreed because we wanted to get the total experience, as well I ordered a sprite(that never came). The salad bar was subpar, some items were out and there were not very many to start with. The salad area is very small and crowded, and as soon as we arrived at the bar there were angry customers addressing the manager about the poor selection and some items being out for over 45 mins. The manager apologized to the people complaining and said they had a few new trainees in the kitchen and they couldn't keep up with the crowd that night. We returned to our seats and the meat service started. They seemed to mostly only have sirloin steak and a roast like cut of beef, we asked about filet mignon and we were told they didn't have it. The also had a grilled ham, chicken, lamb and other pork items. We asked for our meat to be medium well so we were served our meat on a saucer they brought from the back with about 3 thinly sliced pieces of meat instead of it being carved at the table. Pros of the visit were the sauteed mushrooms on the salad bar, the grilled pineapples which were delicious and the meat servers. Cons everything else about the visit. If offered this for sitting at a timeshare please run away because it's definitely not worth your time!",

Pampas has the best sangrias, the Red used to be my favorite, until I tried the white sangria.  It's light and nice..... Our server.was.intentive to our needs at all time...... Our friends had a great time and was impressed and I know we will all be back. ***It can be kinda of pricey, but it's one of those places you can once in awhile. ***Also This time I found our deal on GROUPON",

The meats were kind of on the dry side and not as many selections as I would have liked compared to Agora which is another brazilian bbq chain.  Bit the most disappointing part was the salad bar. There was no onions and blue cheese dressing which I enjoy eating with my salad greens. I've never seen a salad bar without the 2 ingredients i enjoy. And even besides this, the salad bar was messy and did not look good and i was starting think if it was sanitary..",

Our Groupon came with two cocktails- try the Caipirinhas, they have a variety of flavors and are not too sweet, with just the right amount of booze.  Groupon also came with a side of seafood- the fish had good flavor and was well-cooked, shrimp was also very good, mussels were unfortunately a little fishy for my taste.   We had a few cuts of chicken, but after a while, our main focus was on the tri-tip and steak...it was a little salty due to being the end pieces, but still good, especially when combined with a large scoop of horseradish. Yum. Love me some good horseradish.   Ambiance is quaint, service is a little slower than I would have liked. If it weren't for the Groupon, I wouldn't have come here, much less even know that Pampas existed on the strip. I feel that I got my money's worth, and would recommend to others visiting Las Vegas.",

The meats were poorly seasoned but the salmon was amazing. If you can get past paying a hefty price tag for blain tasting food you will enjoy a beautiful ambience and decent drinks. This review however was written for one main reason. Our waitress Roxanne was AMAZING!!!! I would have gave this place one star due to the food. If it was based solely off Roxxane this place would receive 5 stars without hesitation! I almost feel bad about giving this place 3 stars because Roxanne was just that great. I wish the food reflected her because it would have been to die for. If you are all about service and decide to try this place you have got to ask for Roxxane!!!!!!",

When we arrived, we were informed it would be ~20 mins before we were seated. Ok, we didn't have a reservation, we're ok with that.   After ~25 mins, and listening to the hostess cue people up, I noticed we were missed.  When I asked, they did not have our name on the list AT ALL. We were then seated right away.   Once we sat down, we waited 15 minutes for our server to come introduce herself. It took another 15 minutes for our waters to get to us.   Throughout dinner, there were numerous times when we were waiting for someone/ANYONE to come by with some meat.  I double checked...we had our green signs up. We came to eat meat, not get full off the sides.  The waitress came to check on us once, saw that our waters had less than 1/4 cup left but didn't refill them until 20mins after we emptied our glasses and asked for a refill.   The meat dishes were mediocre.  It may have been our first time at a Brazilian steakhouse but definitely not our first time eating meat. Everything we sampled was dry, the beef tough.  The bacon wrapped items tasted like nothing but bacon, the chicken drum was waaaay too salty, the other meats didn't have any flavor.   For what this place charges, we expected better service.  We believe that tip is given based on the service received and not a required amount based on the total bill. So in this case, we tipped accordingly.  It's unfortunate since we tip well for \"normal\" service.  DEFINITELY not returning here.",

The Buffett was stocked, fresh, and had a few tasty options. The meat was served promptly but some of it was not cooked properly. For example, undercooked bacon wrapped around a few of the steaks choices. My major issue was with the service or lack there of. I was very disappointed to find that we were supposed to squeeze 20 people into a tiny room where the chairs literally touched each other. Because it was my wedding night, my family decided to ask for a manager in hopes that perhaps they could add another table or suggest another area that can actually fit 20 people. The manager asked to speak with me (middle-aged Hispanic man) and when I told him our issue with seating he replied with \"well you only paid $150 for the room.\"  Nevermind that we paid over $60 per head for everyone I guess... After I picked my jaw up off the floor from hearing this, I calmly walked away and let him know that I would contact my wedding Coordinator to pass on his response. He shrugged and never came back to check on us. We were assigned one server who was obviously overwhelmed because my husband along with several party guests had to wait nearly 45 minutes for refills of our drinks. But it seemed all the alcoholic drinks that certain guests ordered kept flowing. I was very disappointed in how everything played out. We made the best of it though. I wish this review would serve as a warning to other party planners or persons reserving private rooms. Note that the rooms are not as large as they may say.",

    "text": "Visiting Vegas from California, we decided to Groupon our entire trip. Lunch on Tuesday was Pumpas Brazilian Grill. We've had Brazilian food before so we looked forward to it.   It felt like we were walking forever!  This place was so hard to find! My husband almost veto'd the whole thing, we asked for directions like 5 times!!!!  We get there, 40mins late for our reservation by the way. We wait about 15mins for a table . The server was pretty nice, she was serving way too many tables to truly be attentive to us. But we understood. My husband loves to eat nothing but meat (no veggies) he didn't seem impressed at all with the taste of the meat. I was looking more forward to the salad bar. I was disappointed that the only salad available was Caesar salad and romain lettuce with some vinaigrette. I wanted more green salad options. There were tons of other salad I don't eat like: Crab salad, noodle salad, etc. but I craved more fresh garden options in the salad bar area. The seafood served was just average. Thanks to Groupon we didn't regret the visit, our bill came and we were pretty happy with the $2 bill. No offense but I won't be back. There's way too many other great restaurants to visit in Vegas than to waste time trying to find this place like a needle in a hay stack.",

I'd give it a 3 out of 5.  The location is great - inside Planet Hollywood.  Service is also ok.  The last time I went here in 2007, I had dinner for 2 for free.  What's my problem you ask?  Well, the only reason I didn't pay anything was because I saw not 1 but 2 roaches running around the restaurant floor.  Naaaastyyyyyyy!!!  From then on, I never set foot at Pampas.  I wouldn't go back even if they paid me.",

She made me tell her the tip amount so she could put it in her tablet. I prefer to look at my bill & think about the service before I decide on tip amount. Salads/sides were less than average. Of the 10 or so meat options, five came around & only two were really tasty. Huge disappointment for our 20th anniversary celebration dinner.",

Well I went back in December of 2014 and holy moly this place has taken a turn for the worse! Wait staff completely ignored us!! I don't know if it was because we were using a groupon or because they had friends in the restaurant. There were only three couples in the restaurant since it was later in the evening, but it took about half an hour just to get water brought to the table. It got to the point where we were so frustrated that we decided to get our check and leave even though we didn't get any meat. Never going back again.",

If you park in the self parking, you're in for a healthy walk!!!  Now, the food is very good... they have an amazing salad bar which has everything you can think about... it's delicious and fresh, that's a meal in itself!! But the meats are the highlight of the meal. You leave your \"green light\" on until you're stuffed, then flip it over to RED... to stop the meats from coming.  The staff are very nice, the place is very clean, and the price is just right!!! Hint: if you have AAA, go get the AAA booklet from the information center at the hotel, and there's a coupon in there for this restaurant. :)",

Salty vegetables, and a sad looking piece of meat (I can't call it a steak, it just wouldn't be right).  Other people did have the rodizio, which seemed ok.

    "text": "This restaurant is located in Planet Hollywood inside the Mile High Mall. They offer both indoor, private and outside patio dining. Me and my husband bought a show and food vouchers so we decided to use our voucher here.  Big, big mistake. When the waitress Valeria was her name came to our table her demeanor wasn't pleasant. I guess maybe because we were using food vouchers she thought maybe she can treat us that way. I asked Valeria for ketchup and she told me I have to get that myself and that it's located in the back where the salad bar is at. Later as she was passing our table I waved her down. I told her I thought it was very unusual to go to a restaurant and ask for something so simple as ketchup and was told no and to get it yourself. I had told her my family and friends own restaurants before and there are requests made by customers and the employee are more than happy to accommodate or get whatever the customer is asking for. You can't be petty or have a bad attitude about it like Valeria. After telling her how I felt she was angry and said in a very rude tone \"You want me to go get the ketchup for you.\" I told her no but maybe she might want to do that for future guests. Definitely won't be returning to this restaurant. The majority of the guys that came around and give you the unlimited meat were not friendly and tried to rush you. It was just terrible service all around. I forgot to mention we upgraded for 20 dollars more to get unlimited meat. Management if you're reading this you might want to have a talk with your employee Valeria on mannerism and customer service.",

We were invited by the manager (Brian) to revisit.  Our server was great.  Perfect service from the entire staff.  And the food was much more flavorful. The meats (skirt steak, garlic sirloin, filet mignon,  port tenderloin, sausage, etc) were all delicious.  Tiramisu was perfect.    Overall experience was very good.

    "text": "Where should I start?   This is a set up. In theory, it sounds amazing! Buffet with 12 different grilled meats carved at your table for a relaxed and filling eating experience. Throughout the entire strip promoters are passing out buy one get one coupons which sweetens the experience even more. The problem is, it's a tiny buffet with limited sides, I only saw 5 or 6 meats (no where close to 12), and it was a constant fight to get the few meat selections to your table which caused frustration...not relaxation. Additionally, the BOGO coupon was BOGUS! We did get it half off but you couldn't buy the basic buffet, you had to upgrade to add the grilled shrimp and a beverage which makes your total $4.50 cheaper than the price of the regular buffet. Doesn't sound like Payless BOGO sale to me. Other than the gimmicks, the few grilled meats we had were actually tastey. The ham and steak were really good! If you did not prefer rare meat, you had to request it separately which caused more waiting and frustration. There wasn't a single side that I had that was amazing. Just different cold salads. I think the buffet deserves to be $25 and needs some additional sides.    Final advice: pay the extra dollars and eat the buffet at one of the nicer hotels. Thank me later",

Roast beef was super tender. The lamb wasn't gamey. Bacon was fatty goodness in my mouth. Can't remember the other meats.  The sides were also yummy. Many to choose from, although everyone knows the money is in the meat!  Overall, great experience, but not for the price tag. Glad they were open late though!",

I came in alone killing some time and needing a quick lunch while out in Vegas for a conference.  To be frank, the food quality at Pampas just kind of lacks.  The salad bar was mostly bland and ill-prepared or overcooked.  The service was fine, but sometimes awkward and at times brusk.

A couple friendly ones and a couple rude ones that seemed like you were troubling them and literally would throw the food on your plate. Living Social deal, free dessert with yelp review, and FANTASTIC sangria...keeps my review at a 3.

We got a peal and eat shrimp that smelled, made your hand smell and the shrimp was old and mushy. A drief piece of some yuck fish and a mussle that I was afraid I would end up in the hospital. When I inquired as to why they talk all about the lobster in our ad and a pic of the lobster, why don't we get lobster. SHe said that's their misleading ad with groupon and that makes it not their fault. No one else complains. Then I ask for a manager. He or she had plenty of time to show up since getting plain water takes 15 minutes. We were there for a party of 5 over 90 minutes mostly because they would rarely bring us food because we wouldn't eat the crappy 'surf' because the crappy manager never showed in 90 minutes. after hundreds of dollars GO ANY WHERE ELSE.... FOR THE MONEY THERE ARE 100+ restaurants that are 100 times better in Vegas than this dump hole.",

It took me less than a minute to eat it.....waited another 15 minutes for the guy to come back. After he came back, he brought beef which I don't eat so waited again for 15 more minutes for him to come back. When he came back, brought chicken wrapped with Bacon which was dry and no flavor. Got tired and frustrated..... not worth waiting so I decided to flag waiter down for my check. Waited and waited...... for 30 minutes this time...

    "text": "Bought a coupon for this restaurant at TixForTonight as it seemed a good place to try out. Suffice it to say we were very pleased with the service, variety and general deliciousness that greeted us.   My first impression of Pampas was style over substance; in that regard I was very much mistaken. Yes, it is a fancy restaurant with a matching feel, however it is also warm, welcoming and infused with an overall pleasant feel. Our waiter Dave was a consummate professional. Our drinks were never empty and were strong and crisp. Despite the fact we had only an hour open bar we were met with no delays and were given precisely as much as we could drink in that time. His service was beyond reproach. What's more the servers and managers were also very on the ball, asking us consistently how we were enjoying our meal and if everything was to our satisfaction. The service here really was five star quality.  As for the food: superb! The salad bar was fully stocked with more pasta, vegetables and sides than you could ask for. You could very easily and happily indulge only in the sides and still have a very satisfying, delicious meal without fault. However, to do so would be to miss out on the main event of truly sensational, high quality meats brought and served at your table. My particularly favourite was the perfectly cooked Sirloin and yummy spicy chicken. But all the meats were divine and well worth the extra money, if only for the variety and unlimited quantity you receive. My only fear is that this place was somewhat wasted on me due to my small appetite. But if you're a big eaten then I can promise this place will not dissapoint.   Fair warning though: Pampas (as you might expect considering the unlimited nature and remarkable quantity) does come with a hefty price tag. It cost us $130 for the two of us (and that was including the discount). Expect to pay big.  Overall, a truly sumptuous night out that I'll definitely repeat next time I'm in Vegas. Well worth the money.  And remember: come on empty stomach.",

Almost all of the meats were overcooked and extremely bland. The salad bar was eh. The staff was completely unengaging. Though we had free tickets, we actually opted to pay an additional $20 a piece so as not to be limited to one meat. It was a complete disappointment. We followed this with another deeply disappointing show with Marc Savard.

    "text": "On one hand, I was pleased with the meats and the salad bar was fine.  The price was definitely in line with similar places.    On the other hand, the service was awful.  I know that's a thing in tourist towns like Vegas and New Orleans in general.  But, even compared to other places in town, the service is bad.  Not so much from the guys bringing the skewers of meat.  How can you not like those guys?  They show up with a smile and food?  But the main waiter seemed completely disinterested.  He tried to sell us a bottle of wine for $30 with his strong recommendation, and once we declined I don't think I saw him again for an hour.  We had to ask the manager to get our drinks refilled.  We eventually complained about having to wait for the bill.  We were offered free dessert--and then charged for it until we complained.    And while the manager apologized for the poor service, never once did the waiter mention it or offer an explanation.  They were kind of busy, but not slammed by any means.  I swear, he just seemed irked that we didn't buy the bottle of wine.  There are other places in town offering the same basic deal (Texas de Brazil, for one) and the service was better and the overall class was a step up.  Again, there was nothing wrong with the food--it was priced similar to the competition and very good.  It was just the attitude of the people working there.",

The bacons are soggy, the beef is either too tough/chewy or too raw to eat.  Their seafood ain't any better.  Salmon is dried and Tilapia is bland.  The only reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 is because the service!  There are so many other better restaurants in Vegas, this is a disappointment.  Whoever gave 5 stars is BS'ing!  I wouldn't take their reviews seriously at all.  I remember now: whoever gives 5 star reviews get FREE DESSERT!",

    "text": "This was our first time experiencing a Brazilian style restaurant. My fiance, my parents and I went here while we were here on vacation in Las Vegas. The flavors of the meats were amazing. My fiance had the endless supply of shrimp, salmon, and muscles. She thought they had good flavor and were quite tasty. My parents and I had the endless supply and choices of the meats which were quite full of flavor. I think one of the highlights for my fiance and I was the fried pineapple. IT WAS AMAZING!!! Best eaten while it was still warm or hot. I think it enhances the flavor of the pineapple and made the citrus have more kick to its flavor. The waiter told us in Brazil it's used to cleanse your pallet so you get to taste the flavor of the next portion of your meal. I think I am going to try and make it at home. We all loved the experience.",

    "text": "Service was really good, so we'll start with that, our waiter was really attentive/friendly/and talkative.  I made a reservation and we showed up 10 mins early. So we had to wait. Off to the bar we go, where I ordered a cocktail and watched some football. We waited about 15 more mins, then we were 'accepted' to sit on the waiting seats behind the hostess stand. Great.  Sat down and went to the salad bar, which was pretty good, but not as extensive as I've seen at other churrascarias/ all you can eat meat buffets.  The seafood pasta in the cream sauce was my favorite.  The only sauces available here were 2 kinds of Chimmichurri, no horseradish creme sauce or regular horseradish which I typically enjoy with my steak. Only green I saw was Kale and that was actually pretty tasty.   The guys cutting the meat did not smile. In fact, I don't think one of them cracked a smile the whole time, they definitely need to be more friendly.  They looked like they were in pain each time they came over and would rather be hanging themselves than working.  I also never saw Lamb. I looked and looked for it, but it never showed up. bah bah lamb.  I think they only have 1/2 of the options they tell you they do.  The most memorable items were:  the bacon wrapped scallops, grilled shrimp, and the roasted crispy chicken.  The steak for me was Outback at best and again I did not see as many options as I thought there should be.  The trout and other mystery white fish should be avoided.  No dessert options either or at least a little something sweet to eat would've been nice.   AND it's pricey. If you are going to spend $120-$150 for a dinner for 2 people in Vegas, especially for a steak, this place is not what you are looking for [see my steak list for Vegas].  Ever popular: Would I go back?  No I don't think so unless someone else had a coupon and was paying",

He told me he bought a Groupon and made a reservation for us here for a date night and I immediately got on Yelp to check the reviews and was quite worried because of the somewhat negative feedback. However, I'm so glad we went because we had a positive experience! Our reservation was at 8:30, we showed up at 8:50 (fashionably late?) and were so sure we would have to wait a while to get a table but we were seated almost immediately and the food began. Our server was from England and had the greatest accent and was SO attentive. The food was fabulous, I was a fan of every meat that came out, bacon-wrapped anything was immediately a favorite. You can add on an open bar for only $20 a person and it includes their sangrias and caipirinha. Both are very strong, I only had one of each! Fantastic food and great service. I'd definitely recommend buying the Groupon if you're planning on trying this place out!",

I've been to a few other Brazilian BBQ places and their selection was a larger. But it doesn't discount this place any either. I wasn't able to use the groupon as our group was quite large but they honored the yelp coupon and saved everyone quite a bit.  A few of us took advantage if their all you can drink special and it was nice to see them hand make your drink.  A special shout out to my man, Marcelo, the real MVP for continuing to bring me food even when I forgot to flip my card and taking my requests. (They'll bring you whatever you ask for and will cook it to order). Also major props to Robert! He took special care of us, drinks were never empty and he thoroughly explained everything!

    "text": "If I could give this place a zero, then I would. This was the most HORRIBLE dining experience that I've ever had. It is no surprise that they continue to move their business page!  Our cousins invited us to stay with them at their fantastic timeshare and we wanted to show our appreciation by taking them to a nice dinner. Earlier that day, I passed by Pampas and a hostess in front of the restaurant offered me a coupon. It was a buy one get one free offer. I inquired about the price difference between lunch and dinner, and asked that she explain what we should expect to get based on when what time we decide to eat. She told me that the main difference is that there would be 7 meat selections for lunch and 12 meat selections for dinner. We were all excited and looking forward to our dinner. It was a Sunday night, and we were sat right away. This was the only good thing about this night, no wait for a table, but here's the rest of our infuriating debacle. Our server, Karen, approached us a few minutes after we were sat and brought over a couple of large bottles of water. The caps were already removed from the bottle so we assumed that they were trying to be creative in how they served water. We later found out that they CHARGED US FOR WATER! We did not request water to begin with. She should have informed us that there was a charge before placing it on our table. Also, as you'll see on the attached picture that the bottle states that sparkling water is served in the bottle, but it was NOT sparkling at all. I asked Karen why they charged for water that we did not ask for and she said \"Nevada has the worst tap water in all of United States, and I would never drink it.\" Obviously, her reply did not answer my question as to why they charge for something prior to informing us of the charge. BTW, it a minimal charge, but it's the principle.  Karen informed us that our coupon required that we buy a drink, so she goes on to suggest that we buy a pitcher of some type of alcoholic drink. I asked her if the coupon required that the drink be an alcoholic drink, and her response was \"Well this is Vegas!\" WTH!!! This girl was so irritating. I informed her that my husband did not drink alcohol, and she gave us a look of disgust. What she doesn't know is that it was only my husband who preferred non-alcoholic drinks, and the remaining 3 people would have ordered a bunch of alcoholic drinks, but the look that she gave automatically triggered us to order only the cheapest non-alcoholic drinks (with refills). Time to eat! The salad bar was horrible. It looked as if workers do not check the area to keep it clean. Totally looked unsanitary. Karen claimed there were 40 different types of food at the salad bar, and that was a totally False statement.  The meat options were horrible!!! I was already irritated by Karen's lies and up sales, so it triggered me to keep track of the number of meat options and again ... caught them in a lie! At the most, they only had 6-7 meat options that night for dinner. We asked Karen twice and another worker once if they can bring out lamb and they kept saying it was on its way. It NEVER came out to our table and we noted that it was not ever offered to anyone else. MORE LIES AND DECIT. They were charging us dinner prices for the same lunch options. They could have simply admitted that they did not have the lamb that we requested.  STAY AWAY from this place but if you're brave enough to try it, make sure that your server is not Karen, so that you'll hopefully have a more pleasurable dining experience. Karen's level of unprofessionalism left such a poor impression.",

Third, I had to ask if any meats were going to come out as we had been seated for 15 min without any site of some beef, chicken, or pork. Finally they came out but so sparingly. We had been there for over an hour, having to get back to work, and I left hungry! I have had other experiences their for dinner that were great.

    "text": "Came here this past weekend with a group of friends while enjoying Vegas and I have to say this dinner outing did not go great.   We had a group of 12 (understandably large but considering the setting it's not bad at all)  and they were able to squeeze us in without too much of a wait (this is the one star). However once we were in and had all ordered which plates we would want, that's when things went down hill.   Our table seemed to become invisible when it came to the meats, we had about 2 guys come and slice everyone meat and then we had nothing for a good 15 minutes. I've been to other brazillian style churrascaria's where you literally have to turn them away with all the meat they're bringing to your table. We had to inform our waitress before we got maybe 2 more guys to come by. At one point someone in our party had to call out to a guy to come by and slice meat for us and he looked pretty upset to be bothered to serve us. Our party was definitely bothered that they couldn't enjoy their meats like they hoped.   Actual quality of the meats was ok, not great. A lot of the meats that we did have served were definitely overcooked IMO (I'm more of a medium rare kind of person), but what can you do I guess.  Finally when it came time to split the bill, things went from bad to worse. I understand that splitting the bill can be tedious and time consuming, but the process of getting our bill and paying should not 30-40 minutes. Some people got their checks first, others had to wait an additional 20 minutes before theirs came out and our waitress was no where to be found. We actually asked another employee to help us track her down for the missing checks so we could finish paying and he came back saying that it takes time to split bills for such a big group (aka OUR fault)   Next time I want to have mediocre food on the strip I'll just head to McDonalds, save the money and not deal with the service here.",

    "text": "We came here in Jan 2017 for an early lunch because we had an Entertainment coupon (BOGO) and with a party of two, the price is reasonable.  However, the experience was still less than stellar and of 3 Brazillian steakhouses we have been to, this is definitely in the bottom third.   First, they don't bother to tell you they charge for water - they just put it on your bill. We ordered drinks and they still brought water, then they surreptitiously added it to the bill with no notice or explantion!  This would be consumer fraud in California, but in Nevada, where their clientele are mainly tourists, I guess they can get away with it.   The buffet was barely warm, this just after opening and the bread old (maybe yesterday's leftovers?).  Meat service was very lacking, and they seated us at the wrong end of the restaurant (near the bar).  Meat selection was minimal with an almost complete lack of variety, and we were at the end of the carving route, so by the time the meat got to us, we only got the inside cuts near the skewers with no crust.  The meat was cold, tough, had no seasoning, and requests were ignored.  When a sausage skewer came out, I asked for 3 pieces, but was ignored - only got 2. Meat service was slow, coming by only every 10-15 minutes.  They still come by with a hard sell to take and sell a photo or two - pretty  irritating.  In short, if you live in the Bay Area, don't bother.  There is no need to go to Las Vegas to eat Brazillian Barbeque.  Fogo in the bay area is a much better value with better food, even if twice the cost.  Miracle Mile has several restaurants, and next time, we will go elsewhere.",

We came in around 1pm, the middle of lunch service, with a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> coupon. The hostess was pleasant and we were seated promptly and addressed by the waitress as to the salad bar and how a Brazilian steakhouse works.   The salad bar has the Brazilian essentials: traditional cheese bread, soggy from the steamer, a rotating pasta surprise that tastes from a can or bottle, cheap deli cold cuts in place of the Brazilian meats and your standard salad fixings and dressings.  If you were expecting to enjoy meat at this steakhouse, prepare to be severely disappointed as the servers come along very infrequently. The meat itself seems to be either rare-blue or cooked to death. Their beef, both sirloin and tri tip, was both seared to a crisp on the outside and almost blue-raw inside. The chicken drumsticks are covered in leather-like skin and the \"house-made pork sausage with fennel and garlic\" is a gritty, dry hunk of regular American breakfast sausage that makes a McSausage look tasty.   The only saving grace about the food at Pampas is the roasted pineapple, which was delicious and sweet.  Onto the service, the waitress ignored our table for the bulk of our 2 hour meal. She ignored our requests for more napkins and water, despite us directly addressing her. All the while, she made great conversation will the table next to ours, laughing and joking more than the next three tables combined. When she did finally bring us one refill of water to the carafe, it was clearly tainted. The water was sour and smelled like gasoline. Because of our waitress' negligence, we had to ask once of the other servers for fresh water, which as expected, never came.   Finally, we weren't going to waste any more time with our waitress and were going out to pay at the hostess station when she scurried over to let us pay for our meal. No pleasantries, no apology for the tainted water, just swipe the card, throw the receipt at us and walk away. This was the worst meal and restaurant I have ever been to in Las Vegas. The price is high for you to just fill up on canned pasta and bread to just be ignored.",

As for dinner, we had a groupon for the most expensive surf and turf rodizzio...not worth it!! Turns out another couple came with us and they had the \"steak and shrimp\" rodizzio and they received almost everything we did. I believe the only thing we received that they didn't was bacon wrapped scallops which were lousy anyway!  Overall, the food was fair...the steaks were ok, the shrimp were nice size and tasted pretty good, but had the shell on so you have to spend a while getting them off (they didn;t come off easily) and your hands get really dirty from the marinade! Overall, I would recommend for breakfast and perhaps lunch...I would pass on dinner...not worth the price even with the groupon!",

Our voucher only gave us a choice of a chicken, sirloin or salmon plate with a side of green beans and mashed potatoes and the unlimited food bar. Portions were a joke for a dinner valued at $40. I ordered a sirloin medium and got an overcooked end cut that was about 2 oz of thinly sliced burnt meat. When I brought it to the waiter's attention the rude response I got was, \"that is the right amount and that is a medium.\" The service was slow, the portions were small, the meat (whether salmon or beef) was mostly flavorless/lacked seasoning, and in most cases, overcooked. The green beans were squishy and the mashed potatoes were as hard as a rock. The food at the bar was subpar. The Brazilian cheese biscuits were as hard as a rock. Overall, this place was an epic fail! I will also be doing some research on the mandatory $1 per person water conservation charge. I've never heard of it and when I do an Internet search nothing comes up about this mandatory charge except for complaints about this place charging for it. Also, when the check came, the waiter entered what they call the full value of the meal since we were on a theater voucher combo and wrote down the amount of suggested tip on your receipt for 15% and 20% off the full value, and require that you enter the tip amount before running your card. Another pressure tactic. They also pander to Yelp reviews and give you a free dessert of you take a picture and post a Yelp review while in the restaurant.",

There is an all you can eat salad bar in the back as well as some hot plates, rice and beans, plantains, cheese bread, mushtooms, etc. All good but i just tasted a few things because well lets be honest i was there for the meat. In my opinion the sirloin was the best. Juicy, flavorful, delicious. The tri tip wasnt bad, but not as tender as the sirloin. They also served chicken wrapped in bacon,  sausage, and pork, all grillled and all you can eat of any of these.  Well many plates later we were more than full and had no room for desert.  The service was excellent also. I had a waiter named jeff who was very friendly and helpful. The other great thing was that we had the coupon so we got two lunches for the price of one. The bill came to 55 dollars. If you experience eating on the strip, then you would know that is an incredible bargain.",

    "text": "Positives are the quality of the meats and food. The negatives are location, prices and service which could have been a lot better. I am used to going to Texas de Brazil which is very different as far as service goes, but doesn't have the seafood selections this place has. We were only able to sample a few of their meats because they only brought out a couple choices. Compared to Texas de Brazil, it seems as if it took them forever to get over to our table. One server did make our meat well-done when requested so that was decent. I think Pampas needs to improve on their service and meat selections. We had to ask them to bring out certain meats so we can try it, we never had to do this at the other places.",

    "text": "I love going to Vegas on business because it gives me a chance to hit the Vegas resort buffets, but the last day I was there I just wanted something different so me and a friend decided to try Pampas.   First off the people are just SO NICE! All in all Vegas is a very good customer service town, but the people here are just great. From the greeter to our server Jessica it was a pleasure to be there. Secondly, the restaurant is neat, softly lit, not a great deal of noise. Just a nice place to relax after a tough days work.   But the best part is the food! I have a Brazilian BBQ by my home in Millbrae and I love it but this place just raises Brazilian BBQ to a new level. The selection of meats were wonderful, but i really liked the addition of seafood to the mix. By the way the grilled shrimp were great! The salad bar there was also very nice. You go for the meat, but I had the best Brazilian potato salad there along with a wonderful salad of Roma tomatoes and fresh mozzarella cheese. The fried bananas were not great but nobody is perfect.   Every November I take my staff on a trip to Vegas to thank them for a year well done and for the last four years we have always went to the Planet Hollywood buffet, but this coming year I will be taking my staff to Pampas and start a new tradition. Thank you again.",

    "text": "Location great ... Miracle Mile mall close to planet Hollywood and Paris. Was a little hidden but it was nice. Was greeted and seated by a very pleasant hostess. After a couple of minutes our server Jackie came up to us what would you like to drink at that time she was very pleasant we ordered drinks and told her what we wanted to eat we went ahead with the all you can eat seafood and beef. Then she directed us to the salad bar after we came back to our table from the bar Jackie brought us our drinks. Everything was fine until that point another gentleman brought us a plate of different types of seafood which the food was absolutely delicious and different gentleman came up to watch able to give us different type of beef and pork. 20 minutes later I asked the server how do I order more seafood because I wanted more seafood he told me just tell your server Jackie passed by us not once not twice but six times without asking us if you need anything else. I called her over and told her that I would like more shrimp she said ok and that she was going to bring up over some clean plates. Another 20 minutes past with us sitting at the table when she returned she asked us if we would like the dessert when I told her no she said do we want her to bring us the tab. I told her I am still waiting for you to get us our seafood. No apology was received for her forgetting to get us our food and she bought us over two clean plates. I was already frustrated because not one time did she ask if we needed anything and we had to call her to our table and our table was right in the center of where she was serving everyone. There was hardly anyone there the only thing that I could assume is that she was just new. Another 10 minutes passed by and still no food. I've again called her to our table and asked her did she put our order in. She smiled and said yes then a couple minutes later a gentleman came up to me and asked me who was my server. I told him who it was and after that he went up to her said something and left. Time passed no more food was served to us. I had to leave to catch our flight because we realized we spent almost 2 hours there and were served only once. I called her over again completely dissatisfied and told her to give me my bill. I had a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate that when I told her about it she said they didn't accept because they had no internet. I was like omg really?? The icing on the cake. She started speaking to me like I was retarded and didnt understand her. I then asked to speak to the manager whom was very nice and I explained everything that happened. This was the worst experience I ever had with a restaurant. He listened and took care of the problem but I did tell him never everrrrr again will I eat there. I Dont know if she was having a bad day but with what happened I would never return.",

    "text": "Just keep it coming! Love these kinds of steak houses. Other places give u a small filet on a fancy plate for like $65 and they think they are doing you a favor. Pampas has a groupon for $65 which covers dinner for two (And all the meat you can eat!). Also included is two drinks up to 12 dollars each, and a dessert.      First of all, we made a reservation. They were really nice and even let us put it back 45 minutes when we were running late. As soon as we sat down we were greeted by our server. Love that. He went over the ground rules: Green means go. Red means stop. Enjoy! My wife and I hit the salad bar first. Nice touches with things like artichoke slices and already tossed caesar salad. A couple of notes there, 1) No ranch dressing or iceberg lettuce. I know this is a semi-fancy place, but keep it real. 2) Awesome job of having a section full of garlic mashed potatoes and rice. Ribs and hot wings also at the ready. Soups and breads also offered. All tasted pretty good, and I just wish there was Ranch! Maybe next time I will bring my own.      Now to the star of the show. \"Would you like leg of lamb?\" Yes!\" Filet wrapped in bacon?\" Yes! Shrimp and Scallions wrapped in prosciutto were wonderful. All of the meat that we piled onto our plates somehow disappeared. (We will have to call and have that investigated)      Dessert was a lovely Tiramisu and was very good. Overall, I really like this place. They were good with keep up with my appetite, which was a task in and of itself. My wife thought everything was perfect. Just a great value with the groupon.",

I had already purchased my Groupon and honestly I thought at the very least, I will get what I paid for.  Upon arrival we were seated. The seating was a little crammed for my liking, but we weren't there for the decor, we were there for the food. We got the surf and turf, and like most yelpers said, the shrimp had the shell on it still. The shrimp was properly cleaned, and cooked nicely. We decided not to eat more than one cause it wasn't worth the effort. The salad bar was impressive.  The food was fresh and delicious. They had an array of meats to choose from and all of them were delicious. Only one of the beef options was a little to salty for my taste, and I was not a fan of their crab cakes, but all in all it was tasty. To top off the amazing food was our server Constantine. He was friendly, informative, and made our experience a pleasant one.",

I loved the lamb, with the vinaigrette sauce (my wife asked what was in it, and they told us it was balsamic vinegar, mixed with honey).  The sirloin was wonderful, as was the grilled pineapple.  The sausage, chicken versions, were OK, but I hated the parmesan filet, couldn't finish it.  Again some of this is personal preferences.

The awesome thing was we received a coupon as we were walking in to the restaurant and that made brunch an absolute steal. Two brunches and all you can drink mimosas for $25 is outstanding!   This would typically be a 3 star review, but the bartender/ server was awesome. I wish we remembered her name, but those mimosas were going down!",

    "text": "A friend and frequent visitor of Las Vegas highly recommend this spot for an enjoyable meal, but keeping with the city's theme eating here is a gamble.   Our decision was solidified when we found a remarkable deal on Groupon for a surf and turf dinner, but in reality it should've been the first red flag we were dealt a bad hand.   The atmosphere, quality of food and limited options on the buffet were the worst of the experience. Only the waiter made it slightly more enjoyable.   Greeted at the hostess stand with a \"hey big balla\" because of our Groupon reservation, we were seated in at a table about a foot from 118\" TV screen in the middle of the bar. That was the final straw before the meal was even served.   We were dropped off by an Uber driver who remarked \"It used to be good, but customers said it made them sick recently,\" but even with his discouraging comment we navigated through the busy mall to a restaurant slightly nicer than an Applebee's in a food court.   The salad bar had only a few items on cold plates. Not what you'd expect if you've frequently visited other Brazilian steakhouses. Once the meat started flowing everyone tried limited options. The sirloin was dripping blood, the filet was caked in Parmasian cheese and the tri tip was too salty to eat. The dessert tasted like it was from Sam's and the alcohol was so bad it couldn't even wash down the taste.   We walked out disappointed and still hungry, but learned from the experience and won't return or recommend others try.",

    "text": "Omg - spend your money and time elsewhere.   My family came into town for a school event and had found pampas online as they were advertising a promotion for \"prom\" where large parties could dine for $25 a head. I didn't do the planning for this event so if I had I would have been a little skeptical of this amount, but that isn't the point because promotions like this should be easy for any customer to understand. My family booked a large party reservation and came from states away and wanted to eat at this restaurant as a celebration after the event. They were told after being seated that they only allowed high school students to take part in the promotion, so since everyone wasn't a high school student, they couldn't use it. Now I realize this seems like something you might hear and go, \"oh, duh, prom for prom-attending students\" but I would stop you and ask, did they state that it was only for high school students in the promo (answer: no) and i would also urge you to think of other season/time/holiday-related promotions of this nature - do Veterans Day sales only apply to military veterans? Do Christmas sales only apply to Christians? (Answer, again, to both is 'no'). All I'm saying is, put it in clear terms so you don't have people coming from far and disappointed upon arrival. The waiter did manage to get a military discount for the check since it seemed he wanted to do something to make up for this but it wasn't even close to what the promo would have been. The second, and to me, most annoying thing about this restaurant is their water policy. They place water bottles on the table without saying anything besides \"water for your table\", then afterwards come and tell you \"I must tell you that we charge $1 per person for water in our restaurant, but it is bottled and filtered\". First of all - you must tell people BEFORE. TELL PEOPLE BEFORE. Secondly, there was not another option as far as we could tell, so you literally could not get a glass of water unless you paid for it. Lastly, if I charged you for an unsealed bottle of water but told you - 'oh don't worry, it's filtered' - would you not wonder WHY IN THE WORLD AM I PAYING FOR TAP WATER SERVED IN A REPEATEDLY USED GLASS BOTTLE TRYING TO PASS AS BOTTLED WATER? Sorry, but as you can tell, I was not very pleased with this practice as I personally believe it's crooked and dirty.  Just avoid this place, as a local i can tell you there are great Brazilian steakhouses in Vegas and you might have to pay a little for a Lyft to get there if you're visiting from out of town, but it would be so much more worth your time and money.",

    "text": "For all you meat lovers out there!! This place is a fairly decent priced with all you can eat meat and side dishes.   You get seated in the table. We had a large group, so we got the side dishes they had. I got some rice, mashed potatoes, etc. I suggest not grabbing too many things, because the main course are the meats that are personally served to you.  **Make sure the little card is facing correctly on your table is for service meat servers to serve you**  The servers go around with various meats, such as, pork loins, tri-tips, turkey bacon, sausages, etc. The servers will tell you what kind of me he is serving. You can say \"Yeah I'll try\" or \"No thanks\". They would carve out a section of meat and tell you to grab it with your tongs. You can always ask for extra meat if you like it. They'll cut 1 or 2 more upon request. I really liked the pork loins. It was really good. I had to ask for other servers when the pork loin person is coming again, because I would like some more. Some meats are pretty salty for my liking, esp the sausages.  When were were about to pay, it took 15 minutes of waiting in frustration. No one was able to take our card. Our waiter didn't come back and when we told the other waiters, they just told us we have to ask our waiter. We could have walked out and now one knew or cared that we didn't pay. We waited, until my friend had to tell the manager that we were waiting 15 min for someone to take our card. The manager apologized and helped us. But that was the only problem we had. Other than that, it was a neat experience to try.",

The wine i ordered was served in a plastic wine glass which was unexpected. I personally like Texas De Brazil better but we had tickets to this place which we upgraded so all in all we got a really good meal with attentive service for a deal.

    "text": "We ended up at Pampas not by choice but with a certificate after attending a presentation in December 2018. Everything looked great in the pictures before going there for dinner but the food was very disappointing! I don't see why anyone would go there paying out of pocket unless the kitchen has different qualities for customers without vouchers. From what I noticed, most customers there come with vouchers from hotels presentation because the waitress asked us for our voucher and then she put it with a handful of others she had on hand. As you arrive there and decide not to upgrade to buffet, you will be given a very limited list of options from an already short menu. The prices displayed are inflated to use up the vouchers' value (my best guess). The actual value of food is much much less. My wife got Salmon for $37 and was nothing special with side of soggy broccoli and mashed potatoe. I had lobster tail and had no sides with it. The most disappoiting item of all was mussles in red sauce, I mean in a pool of water. This place lives off people with vouchers who are forced to go there and Pampas has no desire to offer good food because people will come regardless. Your $100 vouchers' real value is no more than some $50.",

The water (which wasn't free) came in a filthy bottle that had built up yellow gunk on the inside....yuk.   We got there at 11:30 for lunch and the kitchen staff was way behind in prepping the food, not even our server was made of aware of it. The all-you-can-eat salad and sides only had half of the items out, it took them over an hour to get the remainder items out, and some of the ones that were out didn't have serving utensils.  Three of the seven meats that we were part of the our meal were never available and so never made it to our table.   With the exception of our server Steven (really great guy), everyone else acted like we were bothering them. On top of that, the Yelp Check-In offer of a \"Free bottle of wine with a Pokemon lure\" wasn't honored simply because we couldn't get internet/data connection within that section of the mall (why even bother with the offer if guests can't use it).  Such a disappointment, it could have been very good; but we'll never go back now.",

    "text": "Pampas is a Brazilian Grill where the specialty is the all you can eat meat platters, that are specially carved right in front of you and taken straight from the cut. These cuts vary from your hams, beefs, chickens, and steaks, but all are top quality. Also important to add; all that you can eat! The most notable cut is the steak sirloin, which has a beautiful charred crust on the outside, while sporting a succulent inside. The water is also supposedly cleansed to a higher degree, and while it is a subtle difference, it does add a small boost in the quality of dining. Most meals here regardless of whether they are meat platters or simple entrees are coupled with all you can eat access to the salad bar, which includes breads, soups, and mashed potatoes. The only downside, was that entrees seemed to be on the smaller side. All in all great dining experience, if you have the wallet to support it! ($27-50)  My server was Jorge :) He did great!",

He kept us entertained throughout our time there and most importantly, he kept my drink cup full. Food is somewhere between Texas de Brazil and Fogo de Chao, certainly worth a try if your looking for big portions. When in Vegas again I will def visit pampas and my bartender Marc for part 2",

They also have a very light cheese popover. Nice, hearty soups.  The meat was served \"Brazilian\" style on cut off long skewers. We chose a meal where several different meats were served. A few were very good, others were not so good. This option also included apparently unlimited platters of nicely cooked shrimp. The white wine sangria was terrific. We will go back but will likely only have the salad bar and the shrimp.   The service was very good. The waiter came by several times to check with us. I appreciated that he carried the credit card reader with him so my card was never out of my sight when we paid. The prices are what you expect on the strip - no bargains here.  This restaurant is located in the Miracle Mile shopping mall associated with the Planet Hollywood casino.  It is close to The Las Vegas strip side of the mall - convenient if you are walking from another hotel but quite far from parking.",

Now if you order a steak at Applebee's or a diner you may be thrilled... however if you frequent rodizios & go to real steakhouses not chains for steak you are going to be extremely disappointed!   Servers were very attentive & the only reason I gave the 2 stars! Also the salad bar was filled and kept watch over. Yes it looked nice but taste was another story. Beets had odd taste, mashed potatoes tasted like they had been reheated a few times & the chicken noodle soup was just awful...   The sausage tasted like a breakfast link not any chorizo or other sausage I've had at rodizio at all. Garlic steak had odd color and bland flavor, ham was ok at best & smelled way better than it tasted. Honestly on the red meat aside from the garlic you couldn't tell one from the other. Pineapple is usually my favorite palate cleanser & am used to cinnamon but this was just grilled and hard on outside not caramelized. In all I'm very glad this meal was a part of our tour & we weren't very hungry because it was our worst meal in Vegas!   My advice if you was rodizio in Vegas hit up Texas De Brazil! No you won't get a groupon or it wrapped in a tour but you'll get what you pay for! Maybe I'm being picky because I've had Brazilian style meats all through Central America & have transplants from Brazil with mom & pop rodizio in NJ but I've also been very happy w/ Texas De Brazil which is a chain. Hope if you go your food experience is better than ours!",

When we arrived they were having a Mother's Day special but that voided the use of the cards. We had a party of 8 adults and 4 kids and our bill was over $300. They would not work anything out and told us that regardless of gaining new customers they wouldn't do anything. I told them it was the difference of keeping customers and them never coming back, and was essentially told we did not matter. Despite the good food I would not recommend a place that does not care about their customers! Highly disappointed in such a highly acclaimed establishment and will be contacting the corporate office for Planet Hollywood.  Update: according to the comment below, he tried to give us $80 off. He did not, he tried to switch offers that would have had me paying $10 more.",

    "text": "Super bad service. Too bad the restaurant has potential. From front desk to meat servers. First we arrived for our reservation on time and they hd to make us wait 20 minutes to be seated and the restaurant was empty!!!! Then the meat service was so slow that we ran out and even stand up to call for meat. It was stressful. Then the server came only when we were about done...saw her hiding in the kitchen on my way to the bathroom. We had to stand up to get ketchup coz we cant find her and had to buss out our plate to the next empty table coz no one was attending to our needs. The pineapple that's suppossed to nuetraloze the taste of the meat only came after we were done (2hrs from when we came). Lunch took longer coz the meat service was so slow!!!! Frustrating. Food is ok but the worst service !!!!! More like a self serve restaurant. Send your manager to Fogo de Chao or Espetus to show him how a brazilian restairant is run!",

A few moments later they got a server who took their order. It took about 15 mins for us to get any service and the only reason we noticed the time delay was because they put a little slip on your table of what time you got seated. After 15 mins of being seated and no one coming over the manager came over and took our order. Drinks mainly and he explained the buffet side bar. Took about 10 mins to get my drink from the bar but at that time we had started eating so it didn't even matter. Compared to other Brazilian steakhouses we have been to I felt as though Pampas had a limited meat selection. Don't know if it was the time of night or what. If it wasn't for the 15min wait to get a server I would have put 5 stars.",

I was expecting something similar to Fogo De Chao which I enjoy very much. The place is very low end.  The tables are old, the walls are peelings, just a overall cheap dinning experience.  My wife ordered wine, which came in a lovely plastic glass, first for us.  They have a sizzler like salad bar, which reminds of a salad bar if motel 6's had salads bars.  They food was just okay.  I believe a majority of their customer go there because of the shows discount.    I have been to Vegas many times, and this is a place to avoid.  Oh, I do not know why this bothered me but they charge you for tap water HA.",

    "text": "Just bad. I came here with my boyfriend and I was really really hoping that the place didn't deserve the mediocre to bad reviews because we had a coupon , but, unfortunately, it did. I've been to several Brazilian steakhouses, which are usually of a pretty high quality, so this was an exceptional letdown. The service is awful. The servers don't come around with the meat very often. We went for lunch (the lunch menu is small compared with that of other Brazilian places by the way) and they didn't even have the bacon wrapped chicken available that was on the menu. SMH. When we first walked in, our waiter said that the steaks were prepared \"medium-rare to medium\". No. If I come to an expensive steak place, I should get my steak prepared exactly how I want. It should not be for THEM to tell US. A Brazilian steakhouse has never told me this before- they usually bring out meat that is cooked to different degrees and the customer can choose what he or she likes. After I complained I got a few pieces of the rare steak I wanted, but not many. After awhile when they hadn't brought the steak around and we asked for it, they gave us a plate with steak on it and half of it was medium or medium-well. Gross and NOT what we asked for. The seafood, by the way, is disgusting. They give you a plate of shrimp, mussels, and \"catch of the day\". We weren't quite sure what the latter was, but it was gross. We love shellfish and both the shrimp and mussels were inedible. I've had much much better mussels for 7 dollars at a bar. The normal sides like mashed potatoes, beans, bananas, and even bread are all at the salad bar ?! Which kind of gave it a trashy feel. It's better when they bring those things to you and they're not sitting there with everything else. The rest of the salad bar though is pretty bare bones and mediocre at best. You don't come to a Brazilian steakhouse for the salad bar, but everything there was just bad. They had this crab salad that was fairly nasty, would not repeat. Imitation crab and mayo laying around don't belong in a pricey steakhouse imho. The only thing decent were the plantains. Our waiter told us that almost everyone coming also came on a coupon. He actually asked us first as if he were expecting it. No wonder !!! AVOID. Not even with a coupon. Give it to someone you don't like if you have one.",

    "text": "It's not typical for my husband and I to try restaurants that have unusual name, not recommended by someone we know, nor because we're not the adventurous kind. Unless it's the only thing open and we're dying of hunger, maybe there's a slight chance. And if it weren't for the voucher we got, this restaurant ain't in our list to try when in Vegas, but it was a win-win, good opportunity to try since it's free dinner (with exceptions of: dessert, alcohol, tax, and gratuity)!  We were seated at a divided room where large parties were placed. Our server named Juan seemed a replacement as the main server for that area was slammed or should I say was too busy  favoring the group before us. It made it more noticeable after we've eaten as the main server took care of two other incoming groups seated in the same large party room. But what the hell, they all does the same, but to be determined to bring quality service, which I felt Juan didn't deliver well.   I had Brazilian bouillabaisse which was a big meh! Bucca di Beppo or Bravo's, all located in Hawaii probably could have done a better version. It's pretty much a pasta with seafood medley of mussels (which the only thing I liked), shrimp, and salmon fish that's super untasty! My husband had Surf & Turf Rodizio with \"unlimited\" meat serving and my in-laws had Grilled Salmon and Skirt Steak (not part of this review) while my child had Loaded Cheese Fries (bacon, cheese, sour cream all OTS because we have a picky eater).   Going back to my husband's food that didn't impress me at all, even if there's different meat carvers who goes to your table to serve it, due to lack of consistency. They seemed to be favoring other parties and we had to ask either our server or other bypassing staff to call the meat boys. Not a big fan of dead carcass (I'm a wannabe plant based dieter), so I can't really attest how good it was for my husband, but I can tell it didn't really pass to his liking the meat choices and service.   To end the night, we had some confusion with our server Juan. I should have mentioned this beforehand and the server should've done the same with warning us with water charge per person. Like who does that? I guess only Pampas Brazilian Grille! Or the voucher could've printed it too with other exceptions. Plus, the way Juan applied our voucher against our orders were very out of order! Instead of simply listing all our orders and inputting the voucher at the end, he customized the receipt like they're trying to manipulate something. And call me stingy or whatever, but I didn't like the force tipping impression! That's why it's called a tip because it's up to the guest if they think it was well-deserved. At that case, he obviously didn't earn the whole 15% because I had to swallow my own saliva and drink from my husband's and child's water just so I can go on with my dinner. Plus it's not even ice cold! They charge for water back to the customers because it was placed in a fancy water bottle. There was also a lot of idle waiting for our server to get back to our table in between dinner session and the meat carvers were sparse serving and favoring table groups.  Giving it two stars only because it was \"free\" dinner and experiencing the meat serving at a lackluster manner! Go get that voucher as a VISA card instead!",

They brought only 6 shrimps for a table of 4 meats only came around once, the servers were very nice and pleasant. Salad bar was plain and not very authentic. The vero water (which they charge $1 per person) is straight tap water it was just awful. I give two stars because of the host and servers but food isn't worth what they charge. If the food was good I wouldn't even complain but it wasn't.",

I understand where the criticism is coming from from the Brazilian comparisons to places like Fogo or even Texas De Brazil. But what we found here was that the service, above all else, was exceptional.   From start to finish, Ray went above and beyond to make sure all of our needs were met and that we had a great experience.  As far as the food was concerned, the seafood platter was quite good. The mussels and the shrimp were really exceptional. As far as the meats, the pork sausage and tritip stood out above the rest.   We went and lunch and found the atmosphere relaxing. Great selection of drinks and even a couple local beers as well.   If you're looking for a place that won't break the bank but will leave you satisfied, I highly recommend Pampas. And once again... ask for Ray.",

    "text": "Main course was okay. Glad I didn't pay full price (30 bucks a plate) but I did pay for a food voucher with our tickets and received so so service. I felt that because we had a \"voucher\" that we got service like we were just getting free food. We waited to be seated for 10 mins when the restaurant was half empty, waited another 6 to 10 after being seated and then took forever to get our reciept to leave.    I would say that the food lacked flavoring, like salt. I had to add that to my steak just to get a little more taste. The \"fresh\" green beans were a little overcooked for my taking, but the side bar was great. They charge a 2 dollar convenience fee for water but dont tell you until your bill arrives.   The bar environment was upbeat and the restaurant side was a nice place to relax. I only saw our server once though. Kind of felt like a free for all, they give you water on the table and leave you be. After dinner our server brought over our reciept and showed us what our bill \"would have been\" if we paid and showed us what we could tip based off the prices we could have been paying. That was a little annoying because we did pay for the food voucher and I felt she didn't deserve a tip, because we only saw her when we were sat and when she cleared our table. Sorry, not leaving a 9 dollar tip when you didn't do anything. We are good tippers when the people treat you equal and do an amazing job.  My husband and I felt that the \"voucher\" food was staged already. One, the food came out in like 10 min, the steaks seemed kind of rubbery, the green beans seemed like the sat in boiling water for too long and the mashed potatoes tasted differently from the food bar was serving. Word of advice...fill up on the side bar it's the best (and most) seasoned thing of the night.  I wonder what this place would taste like if we didn't have a voucher and actually sat in to order off the menu. Maybe would have had a different experience.",

We saw other guests walking to salad bar, so we did the same.  Salad bar was nothing special, area was very crowded.  Most of the meat was very dry and not seasoned.  Chicken was very very salty.

Our waiter, Nick...came by to say he would be back in a few minutes to get us started.10 minutes later, a female waiter came by, poured water into our glasses, proclaimed Nick would be our waiter and asked if she could help in the meantime. She noticed my phone open to the groupon voucher and began taking down the info, while explaining how things would be done. She took our drink order and ended with...there is a dollar surcharge for water with the groupon voucher. I didnt ask for water. You poured it before saying a word. My husband doesn't drink water, so his glass sat full the entire meal. We got up to go to the salad area, after being told meats would begin coming by once we came back and that the seafood would be brought by Nick.. We sat back down and watched three meats go by without a single look in our direction, even helping the table directly across from us. It took 20 min. sitting there before our sangria was brought to the table(we had a one hour unlimited drinks timetable). Nick never came. Seafood plate didnt come. We flagged down the female that gave us water at the beginning to tell her, she went to the manager and informed him. We never talked to a manager. But meats suddenly showed up right and left. Seafood plate was brought. And somewhere in the middle of it, Nick showed up with more drinks for me. End of dinner came. I asked for a white chocolate cheesecake and a chocolate mousse cake to go(one dessert came with the voucher, one did not).  We got home and I opened the desserts to see what they looked like. We had one white chocolate cake and one tiramisu... needless to say, we were beyond disappointed and we will not be returning.",

Meats tasted good - but not enough gauchos and we had to constantly ask for them to come round. Would not have had all 14 on the selection if we had not asked. Even with a reservation, we had poor table, average food, and dreadful service. Asked to see a manager - he ignored us!  There are better Brazilians steakhouses, with better food, Service, ambience!  Go off-strip! They cannot cope on the Strip with amount of customers and want to pack you in and don't care for customer Service quality.  Would NOT recommend or go back!",

While the decor was nice our location was not.  The hostess sat us near the entrance which was in itself not bad until each and every time a new customer was seated. The ventilation made an unpleasant gust of cold air blow in at each opening of the door.  This was exasperated by the door being left open half of the time, should have worn a parka!! We were greeted by a very pleasant server who was the one and only upside to our visit. The salad bar was lackluster at best. This was punctuated by very very infrequent visits from the meat servers. My plate was empty a good 70% of the time. Not only was it infrequent the offerings were extremely limited.  I don't think we saw 1/3rd of what was claimed on the menu. To top it off we paid extra for the seafood selection and saw 1 small plate of shrimp.  I really don't like posting negative reviews but I cannot see the experience improving for others without stating the truth.  The server alone brought this rating up to a two. Pampas, you can do better than this.",

She told us she did not want to ruin the experience of having the meat served on skewers at our table however she would bring out a selection of meats for us to try and the servers would be out with the skewers.  They never did come.  The service was marginal at best and the 6 of us agreed that although it was our first time there, it was also our last.  We were given a $200 voucher to use and the meal was $147 per couple.  We were told that we could not use the voucher unless we spent the entire $200.  This was AFTER we we're finished eating even though they knew we had it before we ordered.  We took two bottles of wine to.make it over the $200 and ended up paying $11 out of pocket.  The wine was charged to us at $33 a bottle.  A quick search on Google showed the wine was priced at $8-$10 a bottle.  We will not go back",

The buffet was decent. The cheesey bread was delicious. It looked like many of the patrons were using vouchers of some kind. We tipped on the full value of the meal ($35 or above per person for the Brazilian meat and buffet), but not on the disgusting sangria which we only had a little of.

    "text": "This review is based on a dinner-show package that we purchased online. I will be reviewing the restaurant portion only on this site.   As a first-time visitor to Las Vegas, we looked forward to our one and only show to which we bought a dinner package. At the box office check-in, we were given the option of three restaurants and we proceed to select Pampas Brazilian Churrascaria (should have picked the burgers!).  At first, the restaurant seemed \"nice\" even though is located inside a strip mall. We were immediately sat down at our table and we turned down the \"upgrade\" to the meal as we had already paid for our dinner in advance. As part of the dinner package, we had the option of chicken, fish or beef and unlimited salad bar. This being a steakhouse, we obviously picked the beef.    This is my third visit to a Brazilian steak house and it was the worst one of the three. The salad bar selection was very limited and the hot food sides were barely hot and some items were as hard as stone. Nevertheless, we filled up on whatever \"fresh\" items they had as we eagerly awaited our beef. Upon arrival of our entree, we noticed the minute and insignificant amount of dry and tasteless beef along with a very small portion of dry mashed potatoes next to it.   We proceed to fill up on the Brazilian cheese bread (more like stones) and to make the best of a lousy meal. A frozen dinner beef patty will definitely taste better and be a larger portion. The red wine we had was atrocious and drank it because there was no place to spit it out. Had we upgraded our meals by $13.00 each would it have made a difference? I honestly do not know and don't care to find out as any restaurant who serves this kind of food is not worthy of a second visit. The service was above average and the bathrooms were clean but I will never eat here again.  Next time we visit Las Vegas and see a show, we will make our own dinner reservations and not part of a package. By the way, the show was fantastic and would come back to that one.",

    "text": "In a word: Yuck.    Got a Groupon for this place (Lunch for 2 for $28, I think?). Was hesitant after reading some extremely mixed reviews but figured, why not?  We came for lunch on Black Friday around 1:30, without a reservation, and though the restaurant was only about half full we had to wait for 10-15 minutes before being seated.  Our server, Kelly?, introduced herself and seemed nice enough, but seemed to forget about us throughout the rest of the meal and our bill was ALL sorts of messed up! She tried to charge to charge me TWICE for a $10 drink (Honey, I had one, it was disgusting, it took 20 minutes for you to bring it to me in the first place...and I wonder how many other 'drunk' customers you tried to pull that crap on).  Additionally, there was some sort of $18 additional fee for using the Groupon...wait what?! ....so in reality, it was $28 + the $18 fee the restaurant charges...oh yeah, and water (flat OR sparkling) is $6 a bottle...so bare minimum, lunch actually came to $58 plus tax and tip...and believe me that did not in any way reflect the quality of the meal.  Yeah, it was a 'surf & turf' all you can eat kind a thing, but Eeeeeesh, gross me out! The salad bar reminded me of the kind of $10 buffet you find in one of the area discount  casino/hotels, and I would say 9 out of 10 of the cuts of meat that were brought to the table were either grossly overcooked or raw. Plus, they brought around the bacon wrapped chicken, and some sort of sausage thing (read: the cheap stuff!) to the table at least 3-4 times each, but only ONCE, in the entire hour and half, brought around Picanha (steak)...and the slab they cut off for us was still bleeding.  Ugh, could not get out of there fast enough.  Will NEVER be back.",

The explanation was inadequate, and everyone moved in slow motion or disappeared for several minutes at a time.  When there is a line of people waiting, you expect to see at least some urgency.",

This continued for another 10 minutes even after asking the waiter to please have somebody come by. Then once we did all we got was completely raw meat. The Raider made a valiant effort and having the kitchen prepares to meet made medium for us but that came out charred.. disappointing experience.",

Twelve of us went to dinner there last night and the experience was horrible!!!!! The greeter, who turned out to be our waiter, bartender, cook...explained they were short staffed...on a Saturday night???? RIDICULOUS!!!!   Most of our party ordered the meat rodizio, or the meat and seafood rodizio! They reported the meats were hit or miss with some meats being really good and other meats being so overcooked they were inedible!!!  Two ordered the grilled chicken, one ordered the bisque and one ordered chicken and French fries! These orders took soooo long to get to the table that most of us didn't want the food when it arrived!!! Both of the chicken breast were so overcooked that you couldn't cut through it with a serrated knife!!! My friend described her grilled chicken as chicken jerky!!!! We sent her order back and asked that it be removed from the bill!!!  The greeter/waiter/bartender/cook did his best, but it just wasn't enough to make up for the horrible food and lack of service. When the bill arrived, of course he tried to charge us for the inedible chicken!!!! After getting the corrected bill, we couldn't pay and get out of there fast enough!!!! Please don't waste your time on this place!!!!!!",

And it had an overwhelming cinnamon flavor, to where we had to dilute with a lot of ice and water.",

Had I paid the over $125 for this meal I would have felt outraged! When we went to Planet Hollywood and the miracle mile shopping area we had a choice of three places to eat (dinner/theater) and selected this one (mistake). It was around 4:00 PM and we wanted to make reservations before the show at 7:30 PM. The seating hostess told Us not to rush the show but come afterwards as they were open until 10:30 PM. Very long story short... We got there at 10:00 PM and there appeared to be a good crowd. We were seated and told the help ourselves to the salad bar and other items. We did and returned to our table  and found our \"ordered drinks\" had not arrived. About 10 minutes later the waiter cruised by and I stopped him and asked about our drinks and some water. He said \"right away sir\".  Almost 10 minutes again he showed up with our drinks and a bottle of water. Then the really bad stuff started happening!  We did not see anyone to carve a meat for another 15 minutes and then it was like filling teeth to get someone to come by and ask if we would like and other piece, of anything! We ended up having 4 of 11 items on the menu and left at 11:25 PM! They had already cleaned one of two dining rooms and the bar area was all that was open. Four tables of customers still remained as I paid my check with a 5% tip and went back to hotel. Needless to say.....I won't be back!!",

It seemed like there was a lot of sides but they were all empty and the area was so messy...there was food every where on the counters, it was not appealing at all.  It took a while for the meat carvers to come around our way, we rarely saw our waiter, and when we did get some meat it was mediocre. The taste was bland, meat was chewy and it was not hot or even warm.  We barely ate and I even felt sick afterward. I'm not sure if the lack of customer service was because it was a Groupon but our overall experience was awful.  We've gone back to Vegas in September and will be returning again in February but we will definitely not be eating there again.  We really wanted to enjoy the place but just couldn't.",

Then the waiter came up to us and said the group on was no longer valid for what he told us it was good for but he would credit us the $80.00 we paid for it. The meats came around on skewers that they carved off onto your plate. They were cold and could not even chew the chicken or the sirloin!!! We decided to just get dessert and call it a night.We ordered a brownie to share it was not a brownie and we did not even get through half. when the bill came it was another $79.00 for food we didnt even eat. We were there maybe 25 minutes. It was truly one of the WORST meals we have EVER had. The service was poor as well. HORRIBLE experience I will tell everyone I know and on social media to stay away! We did speak to a manager who was no help. who ever Robin Carpenter is (the general manager, who was unavailable) you have some serious issues with the way you run a restaurant!!!! If I could give no stars and a health warning I would.  I would like to add that i was contacted about my review and they made things right. That says a lot to me!",

My boys always wanted to try a Brazillian steakhouse, and they are big meat eaters, so we gave it a try.  So glad we did!  Once we were seated and placed our order, the meat kept coming-- filet wrapped in bacon, chicken wrapped in bacon, lamb, sirloin, pork loin, chicken legs, flank steak, sausage.  All of the meat was flavorful and the portions cut by the servers were generous as you wanted them to be. (In the past in such restaurants, I felt as if the servers were trying to be stingy-- not here!)  The salad and side bar was okay, with enough selections, but the star of the evening was the meat!  The seafood was also good- salmon, mussels, peel and eat shrimp, and another kind of white fish which was delicious and melted in my mouth.  Even with the discounts the meal was pricey, but it was great!  We enjoyed it so much.  And the serving folks-- they were all so very nice.  I am not sure why I expect the service industry as a whole to be so \"blah\"-- probably because that is mostly what I see out there-- but the folks here were attentive, they worked hard, and they were pleasant.",

    "text": "more like 3.5/5 stars.... but i'm feeling generous.   located in the miracle mile @ planet hollywood.  the interior looks nice and new.   20 bucks for lunch = ayce brazilian bbq.  decent price of a buffet.  the food was too salty: ie, the bacon wrapped turkey, the sirloin, ham and spicy chicken.  i could barely taste the food.  it felt like drinking ocean water.... bleh.  the service was meh.  i had to ask 3 times for a ginger ale and also, they sometimes skip our table with the food.  =/  my gf asked for a Arnold Palmer, but the waitress refused because they make their lemonade fresh squeezed.  so she was afraid the consistency would be off.   but i have to admit, the lemonade was pretty tasty.  the pineapple was AMAZING.  its like a burst of tropical refreshment to your mouth after mounds of meat.    i also liked the salad bar.  the chese bread was simple, but delicious.  the antipasta was good, and the artichoke salad was fresh and juicy.   the fried bananas, was interesting... breaded on the outside and juicy and banana-ish on the inside....(i hope that makes sense)  we came here cuz we had a BOGO lunch coupon.... but i heard they always pass around coupons, so keep your eyes peeled for one.",

    "text": "Was skeptical of coming here after reading prior reviews but they had a good deal on groupon. If only coming to Vegas for a few days I wouldn't recommend waisting one of your nights here, whether it's a good deal or not. I would of much rather spent more money for a better and more peaceful dining experience. The Groupon was for surf and turf, unlimited drinks for an hour, and dessert. After ordering our drinks we were able to go get sides from the salad bar. All of which wasn't bad. We were then immediately bombarded with multiple different meats within a five min time period. Over the one hour time limit for unlimited drinks, we received two. The waiter brought us our drinks and then was overloaded with so many large tables, we didn't see him again til the hour was almost up. In the mean time there were people chanting and screaming as if we were at a sporting event. Not an atmosphere for a restaurant. When this was mentioned to the manager he claimed this was a Brazilian \"bar.\" And let the room when it continued to happen. It took a ridiculous amount of time just to get dessert because they were busy taking pictures of it in the back and when we finally got it, the order wasn't even right. Not a good experience. Do not recommend.",

In the meantime, we kind of filled up on the \"Fresh Buffet Bar\" offerings and by the time the meat servers started coming by, I didn't have much stomach room left! The Fresh Buffet Bar is far more than just a salad bar and in the future I would probably just have it alone for $24.95/dinner and skip the meat altogether. Among the salad offerings are various salads (pasta, tabbouleh, hearts of palm, greens), stews, rice, charcuterie, mashed potatoes...definitely enough to make a meal, and everything was delicious! As for the meats, they were fine - I just wasn't hungry enough to have many bites.",

    "text": "Ate here on Saturday with a groupon and gotta agree with Lauren M. If you want good Brazilian BBQ just go to Texas de Brazil. Its not that this place is bad, its just put to shame by Texas de Brazil. Atmosphere here is more like buffet, while TdB is upscale restaurant. You could impress a date at TdB not Pampas. Service was about equal, but i don't ask for much at Brazilian BBQ, just stop by with meats frequently and don't leave me waiting when I am ready to go. Both places accomplished that.   Ultimately the meat is what really differentiates the star status for these to for me. TdB just seemed fresher and better cooked. Most of my meats were overcooked at Pampas here. At TdB the meat guys (is that what they are called? Eh I'll go with it) at least tell you if meat is cooked med. rare, med. or well done. At Pampas i was left guessing with most of them seeming well done, while I am a medium rare fan. The only thing cooked proper to me was Pampas's Sirloin. The filet, lamb and everything else was all over cooked. Also Salad bar is better at TdB.   I would say it was worth the discounted price with groupon but I would not pay full price when i could add a couple bucks more to go to Texas de Brazil.",

My expectations were low, but I had a slide hope as I enjoyed Pampas in Palo Alto before and this was a great experience. We had to wait for our table to become ready. Waiting time was OK, as we had to wait for two more colleagues anyhow. After getting to our table the waiter explained the food and tried to upsell to include seafood. We had to order ice-water extra. The meat comes not on a regular basis, sometimes we have to ask for more. The quality was OK and there were lots of variations/ For Las Vegas and the pricing IMHO it's OK to give 3 stars.",

Greeted by our fantastic waiter, David, and he explained what was in store for us.  We ordered our drinks and went to the buffet.  Nice assortment of hot and cold items. Cheese Rolls and fried bananas were delicious and excellent chimichurri sauce.  When we got back to the table we had our seafood plate waiting for us, shrimp, mussels, salmon and white fish. Was told the shrimp and salmon were delicious - i couldn't try because of food allergies. The mussels and white fish were also very good. Not too impressed with the skewered meats, most were overcooked and dry, but the bacon wrapped filet was awesome.   Even when asking the skewer servers for a med rare slice, a small piece or any request, they gave you whatever they wanted to.   The specialty meat was a grass fed sirloin, mine was very tasteless and chewy but my friend enjoyed his slice.  Overall we had a fun experience, but we are ready to try other Brazilian restaurants to compare.  Thanks to David for making our visit to Pampas special.  We need more like him!!!!!  5 stars to David.",

Our server was Alex who gave us a short orientation being our first time there. He also checked how we were doing every so often. The meat they brought around was good-always warm and tasty. For the seafood part you get a total of 6 shrimps, 2 salmon slices, 2pieces of white fish and a bowl of mussel. They have the salad bar plus hot side dishes like rice and potatoes. I believe they had 2 or 3 kinds of soup.The only thing we didn't like was the desert.  We chose tiramisu. It was from frozen I guess that's  why when we tried it, it  was wet and soggy though it didn't look it. Needless to say,  we didn't go farther than what we tasted ; it's a good thing they had that fried banana on their buffet table for the side dishes. .  Received a free complimentary picture.  You can upgrade to one with  frame if you want. Not pushy if you don't want to. So overall my hubby and I had a great time. Will recommend to others and will make sure to come again every time we come to Vegas.",

It is wise to reserve in advance, and when we checked in, they said it would be 30 mins. to wait, but to our surprise, they had a table for us in less than 5 mins...  Not sure if it was because we were still in our wedding clothes, but hey, it's nice to receive great customer service anywhere!    I love the concept of Brazilian BBQ, and we were always being waited on by the roving servers with the skewers of delicious and tender meats, large shrimp and the palate cleansing grilled pineapple, which was very sweet and helped with digestion of all the food...  The cold and hot food buffet was really good because it was not overwhelming and had stuff that went well with everything we were served.  I thank them for their excellent service, as well as the delicious food!  They now have a repeat customer in my wife and I, and since she doesn't have Pampas in NY, I have one close to me in Palo Alto, CA, and may head there for a taste treat!  Only thing is that you should be there with an empty stomach, because it's difficult to say \"no\" or turn your card over to the red side, all due to the quality of the food...  We had a coupon from Vegas Values, which you can find in all taxi cabs in Las Vegas.  It is for a buy one, get one free meat, steak and shrimp buffet dinner.  Regular price is about $64, but with the coupon, it goes down to $32 per person, which is more than worth it!  Thanks, Pampas for making our wedding reception a great one!",

The chicken and sausage were both also dry. Expensive without quality. They have a captured audience on \" the miracle mile mall\" on the strip, but don't get captured. Drive a little to Henderson for Bertolucci's Brazilian BBQ. Much much better",

    "text": "We LOVE Brazillian and were excited when my husband received a coupon for this place to buy one steak and shrimp buffet and get one free.  The original price for the steak and shrimp dinner meal is $71 so for 2 people it's about that price plus tax and tip.  We each had Brazillian lime-aid too so our bill was $91 + another $20 for the tip.  We went in hungry and began with the \"salad bar\" which also had hot sides too.  The selection was small compared to other churrascarias we've eaten at and the flavors weren't impressive.  The vegetables didn't have the fresh, distinct flavors we expected based on other Brazillian experiences, the plantains lacked flavor, and we were less than impressed overall.  The meats were slow to arrive and were overcooked.  The picanha was good, but otherwise, the chicken wrapped bacon was tough and chewy, as were the sirloin and other meats.  The filet wrapped in bacon was overdone and chewy as well.  The meats were bland compared to what we've enjoyed in the past.  The sausage had a nice fennel flavor though.  They kept the shrimp coming but even that wasn't as fresh tasting as we'd expected so we stopped after the first plate.  The lime-aid was overly sweet and tasted like they'd mixed pina colada mixer with lime juice, rather than the traditional Brazillian recipe.  I suppose if we hadn't enjoyed Brazilian in the past our expectations wouldn't have been so high and we may not have been as disappointed.  However, contrast this to Texas de Brazil in Town Square and for about the same price we could have had an amazing meal.  It still stands as our favorite with consistency and flavor over several years and multiple visits.  It's hard to beat!",

    "text": "My husband and I rarely go out, but family was in town so we had babysitting available. Normally, we go to another Brazilian steakhouse in town, but a friend encouraged us to look at Groupon and this restaurant has seafood included in their line-up of meats. My husband is a big seafood lover so we decided to try it out. We were about 20 minutes late for our reservation as we misjudged traffic on the freeway and didn't realize how much walking we'd have to do to get to the restaurant past all the shops. We were told we'd be seated in a few minutes, but it took about 35 minutes. It was busy and it looked like quite a few people were complaining about the wait. Our assumption is that even if we'd been on time for our reservation, we would not have been seated on time.   Some seating was in the front of the restaurant so those people had to maneuver through all the people standing to get to the food bar, which contains side items and salad items. Thank goodness we were not seated in the front.  Tables were mostly pushed close together so they could pack as many as they could into the restaurant.  In other words, you got an intimate look at the wait staff's rear ends about 12 inches from your plate when ever they were waiting on tables next to you.  That is a turn-off. To go back and forth to the food bar, you have to maneuver between tables, hopefully when someone isn't coming up the aisle at the same time. Once a male waiter started at the same time I was going the other direction.  Instead of being gentlemanly and letting me go first, he shoved through first.  I found that rather rude, especially since I was also a customer.  The men carrying the meat throughout the restaurant did not stop at every table. In fact, a lot of the meat we didn't even see until we were finished.  They didn't go table to table. They'd wander around and completely zip past us, without even slowing down. Therefore, I'm sure we didn't even try some of the meats. The quality of the meat was very poor. Most of the beef was extremely chewy or gristly. A lot of it, I just left on my plate as I found it inedible.  We buy all of our steaks at Costco and let's just say that the Costco steak that we prep at home is far superior to the discount gristly meat they prepared.  For the seafood, they brought a plate and refilled as necessary. The salmon was good and had some type of teriyaki sauce. There was a white fish, maybe tilapia, that was so-so.  It tasted like something I'd prep at home and I can't cook fish.  The shrimp was disappointing as that is my favorite since I am not a seafood fan. Well, it was cooked, but not peeled. It really cut down on how much we ate as it was too big of an annoyance to peel each one.  The only value of the Groupon was that it included 2 cocktails, which my husband and I don't find necessary and 1 dessert to share, which we frequently don't get anyway  The seafood was supposed to be the added value, but it wasn't anything special and I would not return based on their seafood.  The salad / food bar was tasty and I have no complaints there. Our waitress was awesome and we tipped accordingly.  We will not be returning to this restaurant as it really had a discount, low budget restaurant feel. .We were packed in like sardines and the meat quality was like something from IHOP.  This is not acceptable when you're paying about $50 per plate.  On our next date night, we will be going back to our other Brazilian steakhouse which costs the same, but they do not offer discounts.  I prefer to pay full price for quality, flavorful meats with top-notch wait staff.",

I've eaten at both Texas de Brazil and Fogo de Chao, but to be fair, I'll try to write a review that is unbiased.   Reasons I gave this place a 3-star:  1) I made a reservation at 8:30pm.  Got there at 8:37pm and they didn't even have a table reserved for us.  We had to wait 30 mins to be seated.  Ok...so what was the point of making a reservation??  2) They seated us away from the salad bar, instead we sat near the bar area.  The bad thing is that we were away from all the action, so we had to wait to get another slice of meat.  It was literally one slice of meat at a time.  3) Salad bar was great, but some of the meat was not cooked very well for my liking and bland.   4) Glad I found a 2 for 1 coupon because if I paid regular price it wouldn't be worth it.",

I found it interesting that the meat servers would serve the men at our table and then walk away from the table ignoring the me, the only female....repeatedly.  And yes, if you've seen it in other reviews, they DO charge for water. They bring a bottle to the table and automatically charge $1.00 per person, whether they drink any of the water or not.

Which would be the typical buffet price so it was definitely A LOT more reasonable than what they charge.   Service I would give 4 stars, my girlfriend and I were 10 minutes late due to the marathon street closures and the lady was very accommodating, but just didn't get a very welcoming vibe from her. Our waiter was great, very attentive and funny. We asked for a refill on the mimosas, he forgot, but later apologized and fixed his mistake.   Food-wise, eh, it's okay, we arrived around 3:40pm, just before dinner started so we were lucky enough to pay the lunch price but also get the dinner meats. I would say there were about 6 different types of meat that came by, nothing grand, but definitely a jaw workout, it was either dry/tough or bland. You also get a plate of unlimited seafood (salmon, bass, mussels, shrimp), which I thought out of everything was better than the meat itself.   The dessert at end though, we got tiramisu and it was DELICIOUS!! It even looks beautiful, probably the best tasting thing there if I have to be honest hahah  Overall, the place is okay, if you are going to come here, I wouldn't recommend coming here without a Groupon, unless you're a big baller LOL. Even with the Groupon it really isn't worth the price for what you get.   **Note: if you do come here, there will be a person coming around taking pictures which she says is \"complimentary\" but what she means is that she's TAKING the picture for free (which you can do yourself with your phone lol), but she'll be back with printed versions of the picture to sell to you for like $35/2 pics. It makes it kind of awkward so if I were you just say no to the picture from the start and just take your own or ask the waiter to help you take one.",

    "text": "Sure, the food tasted just fine, but why pay an arm and a leg when you can have a better experience, better food, and better prices elsewhere? If I ranked it among all the other Brazilian steakhouses (Tucanos, Rodizios, etc. ) Pampas would have a solid case for the very bottom of the list.  After waiting to be seated, we waited for another 10 minutes at the table before a server stopped by to say he would be right with us, before disappearing never to be seen again. Meanwhile, a new server who \"just clocked in\" showed up 10 minutes after that (by now the kids are about starved to death). She explained to us that our gift card wasn't able to cover the tax (which wasn't True in the end) and that whatever the lady said about the Thanksgiving special on the phone when we called beforehand was obviously not True. Having just been ditched by server #1, at this point the vibe was \"not good\". We settled for some steak burgers, and made a beeline for the door as soon as we could to get out of the noisy restaurant. We were so eager to leave (and so tired of waiting for the check) that we almost left without the credit card!  It's a good thing we used the entire gift card, because I'd probably waste the extra balance rather than go again. Word of advice: save yourself the hassle and the wait, and go to a restaurant that won't leave you with a headache and an empty wallet.   For reference: A Tucanos full churrasco and buffet is $25, and the same thing (albeit with half the buffet options) is $50 at Pampas. That's what I call a bad knockoff.",

Once seated, there was a little confusion about the voucher we were using, but in the end it was a wonderful experience and a terrific value.   My husband ordered the $15 beer package, and the first and second beer took a while to arrive at our table.  But the 3rd and 4th arrived in good time and he felt he was able to get the most out of the package.   Our one disappointment was the variety of meats being offered. We had hoped for a wider variety of meats, like rabbit. The meat was a bit over-salted and many of the meats offered were bacon-wrapped, so I was not able to enjoy them.    Service was friendly and efficient.  The cheese biscuits were to die for, as were the mushrooms!  Salads and side dishes very yummy.  Lots of gluten-free options at the buffet table. (yes, I cheated when I ate the biscuits. Shhhh.)  I would return with another voucher or to entertain a group.",

We found a great deal at those 1/2 price ticket location (they have discounts for shows AND restaurants, I never knew!). We paid $2/each to get $15 off the Meat Rodizio, not bad! Total bill for both of us (including taxes and tips) was $60, which is like 1/2 the bill of the Pampas back home.  Unfortunately, 1/2 the price means 1/2 the quality, I was disappointed in the meat selection.  Service was okay, nothing to complain about but nothing to compliment either.  The salad bar had interesting selections (curry??) Maybe they try to fill you up with the cheap stuff. I did like the bread though, yumm. I wish the sirloin were better cooked, they were a bit dry *sadness* The chicken was tender but needed more flavor. The sausages were a bit salty.  Nothing I tried really hit the spot. It wasn't bad but I guess I had higher expectations :(",

We've been to other churrascarias across the country, and find that this one is as good as any other that we have tried.  The pricing for lunch is very reasonable (dinner is higher, but still reasonable for Las Vegas), and in my opinion, even lunch gives you as much variety for meat as a reasonable person could want.  We've had a number of servers in the past, but Constantin is the epitome of professional service.  He is unfailingly friendly, attentive, and makes certain that our meals are truly memorable.  He will walk up to the table, scan for a few seconds, immediately identify anything amiss (glass empty, plates dirty) and make sure that it's taken care of immediately.  As such, we are now exceedingly spoiled, and find it hard to settle for anyone else.  I plan to send friends to Pampas for their first Las Vegas trip, and they will be requesting him by name.",

It was only the sausage that I absolutely did not like.  The surf consisted of shrimp glazed with butter, scallops in butter, grilled salmon and tempura cod. The seafood was BAD, Bad, bad. I couldn't even choke down a scallop, I spit it out. The shrimp were rubbery, the salmon was nearly jerky and the cod was bland and the tempura was hardly intact.

We were seated at an out of the way table, and I was immediately worried that service would suffer as a result, but we were never left waiting for more meat.  The wine was great, and the owner even came by to chat with us for a little bit and tell us a joke about the little \"yes please\"/\"no thank you\" button you use to signal whether or not you want more food, after which he gave us $5 off our next bottle of wine.  It's generally a great marketing trick to get you to buy more wine, but we'd already decided to have another bottle anyway, so it just felt like a nice gesture.  The salad bar was a little on the small side, but frankly I didn't care.  That wasn't what I was there for.  Definitely go to one of the discount tickets stands you can find all over; for $3 each we bought tickets that cut the price roughly in half, down to around $25 per person.  YMMV, of course.

    "text": "I love to eat Brazilian food and I try new places all over the country. I was in Las Vegas this past weekend and received a coupon from a girl in Planet Hollywood Mall, so we decided to go try it. The coupon was for $5 off Lunch. We went to the hostess and asked to see the menu first. We noticed that there was a lunch buffet on the menu. One part of the buffet was for salad bar only and the other one was for salad bar with Churrascaria (Meat). The Churrascaria was $19.95 and the Salad Bar Only was $13.95. We asked if the coupon reduced the price to $14.95 for meat or $8.95 for just salad bar only, and she said yes. My friend is a vegetarian that is why we asked about the salad bar only. We were in kind of a rush and needed to eat FAST, so we said okay we would do the salad bar only. We received confirmation that it would be $8.95 per person.  We fixed our plates and ate our salad bar, which was okay but nothing special. In fact the fried bananas were not like I usually eat at most Brazilian places. I am used to fried plantains but these were some kind of stale fried bananas in corn meal, not even tempura batter, YUK! I actually spit it out. The black beans, rice and salad was actually good and I was enjoying it until we received the bill and they were charging us the normal price $13.95 per person. We calmly explained to the waitress that we gave the girl at the front our coupon. She came back and explained to us that the coupon was only for the Churrascaria, not on the salad bar only. WE explained to her that we had confirmed this with the hostess before being seated. We asked to speak to the manager to resolve the misunderstanding.  The blonde hair male manager came over with a real smirk on his face and told us that there was nothing he could do. We explained again what we discussed with the hostess before being seated and he with a REAL BIG SMIRK on his face said she would never say that and called us LIARS! My mouth dropped! I was so in shock! I had never had that happen to me before. I kept my cool and tried to calmly explain but he just kept shaking his head NO and smiling really hard, kind of weird like. My friend lost it and started screaming, \"Are you calling us LIARS!\" The entire place stopped and started watching what was going on. He realized this and asked us what we expected him to do and we said nothing but honor what we were told when we arrived. He reluctantly changed the ticket and slammed it back on the table and walked off. The waitress was even embarrassed at his actions. My friend and I paid the bill and swore we would never come back to this place as long as that manager was working there. I only wish that we could have gotten in touch with the OWNER because he should FIRE that guy. As a business owner myself, I would never treat my customers like that or anyone for that is concerned. My only advice is that if you are offered a coupon to try it, make sure you get confirmation of the real deal and record it for proof just in case this guy does this again. Sincerely, VERY DISAPPOINTED Brazilian Food Lover",

I was served my Brazilian grilled meat & pineapples by one of the kindest & hospitable servers, Marcos N! He asked how did I prefer my meat to be cooked & ensured my meat was well done & delicious! Marcos came to my table with every meat available until I tried it all lol! He was persistent in a kind way, and it worked! I was stuffed! The Marketing Mgr. Johnathan welcomed me to their establishment & invited me to visit their California location. Devonte was kind & agreed to take my pic with the staff.

No complaints for the meat. Everything I ate was worth eating. My wife stuck with the meal option available with the show pass and it filled her up, but was similar to an outback sirloin special, two sides and a steak.  This place is definitely not the most amazing Vegas experience, but it was a quality meal for discounted rate. Our experience was not like some of the others with bad service. Yes, the waiter was scarce once he took our order, but there really was nothing for him to do. The other staff roaming around kept our water full, and the guys bringing the meat were very kind and NON-STOP. There literally was meat piling up on my plate.  In all, I think we saved $30 by using the meal option with the Vegas show.",

It seems that everything went downhill quickly. We went for our 1st trip to the serve yourself area.. then shortly after four different meats arrived; house special, sausage, top sirloin and bacon wrapped filet., Then no one came..20-30 min later chicken and top sirloin came.. then nothing again.. meanwhile we were being entertained by a. Inch of employees huddled 10ft from our table discussing workplace drama.. we called our new server over and explained to her that we hadn't been getting meats. Then the top sirloin came again with the chicken.. we declined and waited for what felt like another eternity before we mentioned to our server that the meats hadn't arrived. She mentioned it to the manager who was also huddled in the corner discussing the drama. Needless to say this went on for a while the manager came over and heard our complaints but we never saw him again. I wouldn't recommend Pampas. Save your money or if you really wanna eat Brazilian go to towne center or anyplace else,. The manager and server said they couldn't do anything because we already received a steep discount as though it was our fault their employee out front offered the discount... same on pampas for the bad experience.. this was our 4th time there but will not b back. We taken lots of people there.",

We were given coupons for BOGO on the $44 lunch so 5 of us decided to take advantage of that offer and one of us just wanted soup, $44 lunch... Gotta be good, let's go! Right off the bat, if that wasn't canned soup I wouldn't want to admit I made it!  Nice salad bar, not great but no complaints there. The rolls they put out weren't worth eating  but why fill up on bread anyway, we're expecting some great meat coming around anytime now.  First they brought some shrimp out for the table, not bad but my husband was really the only one eating it.  Then they brought the sausage around, EXCELLENT! Roast, and the sirloin, ummm, let's say I tried a couple bites and thought I'd save room for the next dish.  Ham came around, not bad, not great. Chicken... took a look and passed.  There was a very tasty steak (the star of the show) that was actually very good, that and the sausage were really the only meats worth eating.  $3.50 a glass for very flat soda, mandatory to use the coupon.  (along with a $1 per person \"water conservation\" charge)...  Seriously?!? When the waitress came around (she was very nice btw), we explained that the soda was completely flat and maybe they needed to change the CO2. She said they have but they've been having a lot of trouble with it.  REALLY, this $3.50 FLAT soda is mandatory?  When the bill came we had asked to split it in half and pay with 2 cards (mine and my daughters), I guess half meant something else to her. Anyway... Soda, I did explain that we felt taken being forced to order $17.50 of flat soda and they should be ashamed of themselves.  I did this while standing over my flat Diet Coke and my flat Sprite that I had barely taken a couple of sips of.  She said she would talk to the manager. She came back with $7 cash since she couldn't fix the bill. That's ok, but $7?  \"Oh you want it all back?\" Of course we do! I told her don't worry about 1 of them, our teenage grandson didn't mind... Teen boys just drink it, fair enough there! Again, the waitress and most of the staff were very nice but had we paid $44 a plate for this lunch I would be demanding  a lot more than my soda money back!",

Our sad plates were never taken away, and fresh plates for our meat was never given. We had to use the salad plate, and pushed what little we had on them to the side. If my feet hadn't hurt so bad we would have walked somewhere else, but I needed the break. So we gave the meats a try... the shrimp was bland and chewy. The only 2 meats that came around were extra extra extra well done and disgusting. We were ready to walk out... so upset this was my birthday trip and dinner. He said oh you're done (after he had been lost in a portal somewhere, for quite some time) I replied yes I can't eat this stuff. We expected for a manager to come over... nope, that would be good service. Instead he brought us our bill and showed us what 20 &25% tip would be. Really? A tip for no service, bad food, lack of meat selection and a recycled salad bar? Seriously avoid this place at all costs. I have never done this before but I will be handwriting a letter to the management so they know just how bad this experience was. Overall: service: terrible Food : there aren't words to explain how bad it was both selection and taste Cleanliness :  horrid!  Pushing dropped salad bar items back into the containers on the salad bar. Can you even imagine what goes on behind closed doors?",

First, it's a bit of a tight squeeze in that place. They need more organization.  We made a reservation and was not seated for a good 20 min after we arrived.  Can you say, RUDE?   The salad bar had quite good selections, but it makes you wonder if most of the stuff they put there was intentional (to make you full quicker).  There's seafood options (although not very good).  Their mahi mahi and most of their meat lack flavor. Actually there was a couple of meat that was TOO salty, but it beats the hell out of bland.  Our coupon included dessert which I'm sad to say was too rich and sweet.  I think that after an abundance of meat and protein, something soft and not overwhelming should be dessert choices.  But unfortunately, they didn't have the \"refreshing\" dessert choices.    All in all it was just okay.  My winner is still FOGO DE CHAO.",

    "text": "This would be the worst Brazilian steak house I ever been to, even the lower end steakhouses have offered better service. We where sat and I requested to sit by the tv so I can watch the game, the host placed is right under then gave me the ugly look when I asked for another table more back.  We then had to wait over 10 minutes for any one to greet us. The manager happend to be walking around and noticed we where mad and waiting, she spoke to the bartender and they told her no one had taken care of us(I work in the restaurant business as well so I know exactly what they where saying) she eventually made her way to us and we told her we haven't been served so she got out drinks and we where on our way. We went to the salad bar as usual then sat and waited for meat to come...we kept waiting...we waited more( normally in these steak houses they bombard you with meat) eventually the manager walks up to us again and says is everything ok? (At this point we still didn't even know who our server is, eventually we realized it was the bartender) we told her we haven't gotten any meat brought over and the food from the salad bar to go with the meat was already cold :( after that everything was fine, they kept is full of meat but never an apology :/  The drinks where great, the staff sucks, normally servers should greet a table even if it's not there's but here they care about their own tables, the people that bring the meat SUCK. They are extremelyyyyy rude, they offer me something, I say no thank you then they just leave and ignore my wife! Half the time she was left wanting to try something and it was one in particular(Spanish male with spiky hair and glasses) he boulders in with the meat smashing my plates out of the way...like really? Also we got the surf and turf deal but not one time was any seafood offered, I didn't really care because I came for the meat but just beware if you're coming here for sea food. The bartender taking care of us later was nice and pretty attentive but the damage had been done, specially considering the price you pay. The icing on the cake was that it was my birthday and they came signing to my wife instead of me, that didn't bother me but just pointing it out for those who take birthday signing in restaurants serious. You might like this place if you're treated better but maybe we hair had the worst luck, however I don't recommend it to anyone, if you're visiting Vegas like we are there are many other places to choose from",

Their salad bar is puny but that could be forgivable since it isn't the main attraction anyway. Right away, however, our waiter seemed to be on a pressure-tactic to try and upgrade us to some surf-n-turf mumbojumbo that we had no interest in. When we politely declined, he seemed to visibly dismiss us but didn't miss a beat to try and slickly pressure us into buying bottled water. I'm not a fan of tap water anyway, so it was no big deal, but he definitely came off as a used car sales rep-level slimy.  The gauchos came around once and....that was about it. We were really early for dinner, right at 5, and there weren't many other people there, so it was really puzzling to me as to why they couldn't be found. I wanted more of the steak and fatty meats, but they only ones that came by a second time were the dry chicken guys and the underwhelming sausage dudes. Since we had a show to catch at 630, we really couldn't linger anyway.   All in all, I wouldn't come back here - the meat was too rare, the service was lacking, the cold food was bland without enough variety, and I wasn't satisfied. The one standout was the Brazilian lemonade - we couldn't get enough.  Oh yeah - they will come by and try and take a picture of you before you leave, \"Complimentary souvenir postcard.\" Once you pay your bill they'll show you 2 large printouts that are $25 each or 2 for $30 as a 'Vegas keepsake.' Uh...what happened to the whole gratis part? That's when they'll whip out a tiny 2\" x 2\" print out and again with the high-pressure sales pitch. Very, very tacky. They also photoshop you without asking so you look like a cartoon character. Skip this place if you can.",

The salad bar had just enough variety; in addition to traditional salads, meats & cheeses, and pickled artichokes, hearts of palm, etc. I loved the salmon stew, the ratatouille, kale soup, and plantains. I'm honestly shocked that this place doesn't have a higher rating!   In addition to the fresh and delicious food, the service is WAY above what I could possibly expect in Vegas. I bought a Groupon for lunch here, and my husband and I had a slight emergency during the day and missed our reservation. Not only did we miss our reservation, we missed the entire lunch period. Our flight was the next day, and Brian the manager allowed us to use our Groupon for the dinner period instead. This was greatly appreciated as the price for dinner is significantly higher.  This place is a wonderful and delicious departure from typical Vegas dining.",

The buffet had some awesome sauteed mushrooms and also a chafing dish full of bbq smoked pork that was actually one of the best items of the night.   The only problem we both noticed was that a few of the hand carved meats were either dry or poorly seasoned. Luckily enough there is a big enough variety to choose from to get you through the meal. I probably would've only given 3 stars but the efforts of the wait staff, especially Aaron made up for the short comings of the cooks.",

The fact that this place costs more per person than Texas de Brazil is a crime, when this place is like prison food in comparison. This is the kind of place that doesn't care about excellence because they can rip tourists off and it won't matter because a new crop of unsuspecting tourists will be in the next night. Seriously, just take an Uber about a mile or two South to Texas de Brazil at Town Square if you want a Brazilian steakhouse experience.  Was gifted a Groupon for surf & turf rodizio with 1 hour all you can drink. It is 8:04 PM, 44 minutes in and I have had one glass of sangria and have been waiting on a second.   Salad bar is an absolute joke and is unkempt. There is a wedding going on and the waitress told us they ran out of wine glasses, hence the back up on drinks. I even had to ask for the little card that signals we want meat or not   I asked 3 different service people if they had chimichuri. Our waitress said all they had is A-1. I didn't believe it but another guy showed us where it was supposed to be after I told him it wasn't on the salad bar like he told me it was. When it wasn't there, he asked in the kitchen and they said they ran out. It wouldn't be so egregious if they seasoned their food, but so far, everything is completely unseasoned and tepid at best. I've been offered pork tenderloin about 5 times and ham twice.    This place has no business being in business. Don't bother.",

Seriously, you can't go wrong with a restaurant that offers pleasant & tasty meals for a great value.   Tons of meat, a salad/sides bar, and add-on alcohol options - whats not to love?! Service is uaually pretty stellar and protein rotation ample. My only True gripe would be spreading their staff thin on the floor. Even with an all-star team, there's still a ton of waiting around for the server, the check and everything else in between. Nonetheless, I've enjoyed every single visit here & will be back again.",

Vanessa helped me and my Elder parents that required translation feel comfortable and she did the job ! Without me asking she translated the Menu to them in Spanish. She then brought us water and just had a positive attitude towards us, and was asking us about ourselves which made me connect better and feel more comfortable, that to me is what a host should do, she started off our amazing experience. Nick, he didn't make us wait ever , he was on it . He explained our menu very well and like Vanessa, he was very welcoming and warming. When we wanted more meats he would make sure himself that the meats would come our way right away. He would keep up with our refills and he always checked in on us as busy as he was. If I could give them a 10 star I would!!!",

It's plain expensive and I think only the drinks are palatable. We had the surf and turf option thinking that it couldn't be half bad.   The plate of seafood we tiny cooked and boiled shrimp served like shrimp cocktail, the mussels were overcooked, the squid or octopus was not even chewable! And it looked like the plate had been served before.   The meats came out either raw or dried and well done. I didn't see any chicken come out and no pork choices either. The waitress was never around either for refills of drinks.   I thought the least they could serve is a nice dessert since it would be served cold and the waitress took almost 30 minutes to come back and tell me, they were out of Tres Leches. BAD BAD BAD and I rarely find a place that is below 1 star. Even the washrooms had a bad smell to them.",

The meats were undercooked and not up to the usual standards. The sides could also use some creativity. The white chocolate cheesecake was an excellent end to a bad experience. Trevon made us smile with the beautiful dessert presentation. We will return and chalk tonight up to a bad night. If you go request Trevon he's great and I wish he could be cloned for every restaurant. Good luck, Trevon and don't lose that winning personality. See you next time.",

Through out my entire meal- always asked how I was doing- asked for my meal to be comped and always made sure there was food on my plate. The customer service he provided was above and beyond. ALL of the employees there, including management- should take note of WALTER's customer service skills and maybe even a lesson. Thanks again WALTER, you made an unexpected situation, manageable. I appreciated your kindness, professionalism and ability to get things done. I hope upper management see this and gives you props. You deserve it. The world needs more WALTERS around.",

    "text": "We were here for a free dinner offered as an incentive for attending a timeshare presentation, and I give it three stars based on that it was free (although, it really wasn't free).  The star rating might actually have been only two stars based on the overcrowding at the restaurant (Saturday night) and the little tricks they play to up the price beyond free.  I think we would have been incensed if we had had to pay the high menu prices for what we got, and the rating would have been two stars based on a poor value for the money, if we had been regular paying customers.  First - the good - the salad bar, with the soups, pastas and other foods, is actually among the better you will find at an AYCE Brazilian steakhouse.  The greens were mostly crisp and fresh, and the various dishes tasty and good.  Our server Joseph - was very good.  I felt that he was just a cog in the wheel of this restaurant, and had to play the part of its spokesman, so I didn't blame him for their little \"charge you for extras\" tricks.  Although our meal was supposed to be free, apparently the free tickets got us only the salad bar and chicken (wasn't clear to me if it was AYCE chicken, or just a plate of chicken).  Our server told us that for ten dollars each we could upgrade to the AYCE menu, which he kept pitching, but I just cut him short and told him, \"Yes, you can have the ten dollars.\"  However, as it turned out, even with the upgrade, we didn't get any seafood with that AYCE (although the dinner menu online includes both meats and seafood (shrimp and fish), still for whatever reason our AYCE experience did not include any seafood - we would have had to pay $18.95 for a side plate of shrimp, is what we found out later).  We also got a can of guarana soda which definitely packs a punch, free for our Yelp check in.  Over all, the meats are average quality.  Probably the Picanha Nobre (Brazilian top sirloin with sea salt & olive oil) and Maminha de Alcatra (tender tri tip roast seasoned with sea salt), were best, although really it depended on the cut being presented and how long it had been cooked.  The filet mignon with cheese on it, was dried out and not that great.  The lamb too, was a little dry, but I have to admit that good lamb at restaurants in the U.S. is very hard to find.  Also, we never saw the File de Costela (tender rib-eye roast seasoned with sea salt).  The chicken legs and pineapple were fine.  Without the free tickets, the AYCE would have been $64.95 each.  The quality of meat and the overcrowding at both the too-close-to-each-other dining tables, and the too busy salad bar (was hard to get at the food at times due to the crowds), detracted from the experience.    Also, the way the dinner was promoted as free, but ended up being something you had to pay extra for, and the way seafood was on the menu in the AYCE but ended up being extra, was representative of the over all desperation I felt this restaurant is experiencing.  Desperation, in my book, is a precursor to quality's going way down, and eventual restaurant closure.  I mean, we had a massive seafood sampler and Caesar salad with superb service, privacy and quiet elegance, at AquaKnox at the Venetian, two nights prior for just over $100., or could have paid even more for - granted more food - but a sort of cattle car experience - at this restaurant.  You decide which way you wish to go.",

However, after I got to the restaurant I realized Groupon was still pending after 24+ hours. The manager ended up matching the price which I really appreciated.   Even with the groupon I wouldn't have paid $10 for the food I got there. If anyone knows what a good steak is, don't eat here. The sirloin was dry and extremely tough. The \" filet mignon\" was more like a NY strip with no flavor and very stringy. I choked the ham down and didn't dare to get any thing else. Their salad bar was very sparse and wasn't very good. The drinks that were free were very selective and I ended up with a sangria which was alright but after 3 I didn't even have the slightest buzz. At a past Brazilian Buffett the pineapple was my favorite, this pineapple I wouldn't even eat. Everything was dried out and flavorless or had the wrong flavors.   I was excited for dessert because they had Tiramisu which is one of my favorites. First bite in I was running to the bathroom with food poisoning.   I've been to Brazilian buffets and this was not one of them. I would never recommend this place and will not be back.",

Not only was the food delicious, but when they brought by a type of meat that had cheese on it and my mom politely declined (she's lactose intolerant), they proactively offered to bring one without cheese for her shortly, and they followed through.   Additionally, because there are a set number of meats you should get to try, our waiter came by at one point to verify which ones we had and had not gotten yet, and made sure the ones we missed came around to us within the next few minutes. Will definitely be dining here again!",

The plantains tasted like it was boiled instead of fried. For $100+ I feel cheated.",

    "text": "Walked by and was met by very nice host name Dee who gave me a discount coupon to try the all you can eat everything meat and salad.  He sat me where I wanted out in the mall.  I assumed he was the manager since he was so professional.  Turns out he was just a host.  Then I waited for seemed like an eternity for service.  The waiter was missing.  So too was the meat that was supposed to come by.  I almost got up and left.  Then along comes my angel Trini.   She was so sweet and helped me get started with a drink, water, and sent me on my way to the salad bar.  I wish she was a server.  She checked on me the entire meal to make sure I was ok.  In additon, the busboy AJ was kind enough to get me some watermelon from the salad bar since it was empty when I went up there.  Walter the meat server was very kind.  He and Trini made sure I got everything I needed and explained how to turn the coaster from red to green if I needed something.  The service and people were amazing with the exception of my server who I saw rarely and never brought me anything except a bill which he watched me tip him on it.  I asked if the tip was shared by all and was told yes.  This is not True.  So the amazing people who made me feel special got nothing, and the worthless server got 20%.  I don't like it.  From my experience here, the waiter is worthless.  ALL the other employees did the work and provided excellent customer service.  The tipping model here should be revised to ensure Trini, Walter, and AJ get their fair share since they are who makes this restaurant special.",

    "text": "IT was a fun experience.  The atmosphere is fun and the servers were fun and entertaining.  Keep in mind there is meat and more meat offered and served at your table so go hungry.  The experience starts with a server taking your drink order and instructing you to go to the salad bar which is a meal in itself.  Salad was fresh and plenty of choices other than lettuce and toppings.  In addition there are soups and hot vegetable offerings including mash potatoes, mac and cheese etc.  So after you have your salad plate, leave some room on your plate for MEAT because that is when the servers begin bringing meat on skewers to your table to serve you one of 12 different kinds of meat.  There were several different kinds of beef, different cuts and different flavors.  Additionally there was ham, bacon wrapped chicken and pork tenderloin.  The chicken, pork and ham were my favorites.  They serve small portions but even that was too big for me.  I would take one piece and share with my dining companion.  You have a card on your table and turn it over to let the servers know you do or do not want more meat.  Food was all good but nothing exceptional except the pork and chicken.  It was costly.  $100 for the two of us to dine (that included tip).  I would not go here regularly due to the cost as well as the I don't particularly care of buffets since I eat too much but one a one time experience is worth it.  Be warily as it is Vegas.  Our hotel had discounts coupons that were meant to be misleading.  It appeared the meal would be about $40 for us both and it was actually $40+ per person.  Good for the experience and the food was good.  Nice atmosphere and friendly meat servers. We did however have a difficult time finding our waiter when we were ready to leave to pay the bill.",

I didn't eat any of the meats however my son and Husband enjoyed the chicken, steak and salmon. The chicken was a little too charred but the inside was nice and cooked. As far as the salad bar I actually really enjoyed it, I got like 3 plates.  I really enjoyed the mashed potatoes, the tortilla soup,  the Asian pasta salad, the fresh fruits watermelon and cantaloupe they were super sweet! I also liked the salad and cubed cheese as well as the cheese bread. The corn and chick pea pasta was good too. I'm not a big meat person so it was nice to have options and good options. You can tell it tasted very fresh which I liked.  The service was good here. We came on a Saturday night so make sure you make reservations. They also have a girl come around and ask to take your picture and sell you the picture in a nice keepsake frame. I was a sucker and couldn't say no. It was a nice picture and a nice keepsake from our trip.    All in all I enjoyed the food and service was solid. Would recommend!",

I like their open bar concept and seemed reasonable so the wife and I gave it shot. Pretty decent for the value. The wife and I each had 3 glasses of wine for less than the price of a bottle.   The salad bar was just okay, but most, including me aren't probably here for the salad. I did love their CousCous and the wife really enjoyed their kale. She tends to be more healthy than I so consider the source.  Overall, a good value for Vegas if you have an appetite.",

One of which was to visit a restaurant of our choice from a few listed and we selected Pampas. Picked up our dinner vouchers a day show tickets made our dinner reservations and went with the flow.   Restaurant: in my opinion slightly hidden but it's nice because it gives you the more private not so chaotic dinning experience. We arrived early and they were able to seat us earlier than our reservation time. Very nice staff and nice restaurant. My bf selected the Meat Rodizio for an additional $10  and I selected the salmon plate which was covered with the dinner voucher.   All in all everything was perfect we tried all the different meats and the Salmon was perfect melt in your mouth. The drinks were strong and we'll served. We ordered the cheesecake and it also was delishes. This is definitely a place we will be returning to.",

My husband complained to the manager and was told to tip on the discounted amount. When Renae came to collect the the money she was argumentative about the tip amount stating it reflected 8 or more people; we all paid separate checks but there were 11 of us.  We told her we were not tipping on pre discounted amount. I told her it was bulls*** that my cousin was being charged $15+ on a discounted amount of $15+. She stomped off saying she needed to speak with her manager. I wonder how many people weren't paying attention that night. In addition, the drinks came out slow and we didn't get all the meat promised and only one plate of shrimp. We asked for the grilled pineapple three times before it came. So very disappointed in this place. The next time I have family in town we will NOT go here.",

It's in a far corner of the mall, so be ready for a walk and a hunt depending on where you enter.  Lastly, for discount seekers: We got a discounted dinner ticket from one of those red ticket sales booths that you find all over the strip, saved a big deal.",

    "text": "After purchasing the $99 Groupon for what I though would be an amazing dining experience turned into morning but a bad experience. My date and I waited 10 min for our reservation. Patiently waiting to meet or server, the $25 open bar drink package, 1st drink, came to our table 20 min later and one was incorrect. We recurve our water which had a film of grease on the top level. Our first round of meat I asked for rare and was given well done. I waited an additional 10 min for the meat and correct temperate. We order the Surf & Turf meal option which came with small peel and eat shrimp, tilapia, as very hard piece of Mahi Mahi and muscles. I must say the muscles were good, I ordered another order which NEVER came. Due to the slow service we were only able to order 2 drinks on the package. I asked to speak to the manager and all that was offered was for me to return tomorrow night or when I'd like to for compensation. I shared that with all of this competition in Vegas and the fact I usually go to Fogo de Chao which happens to be right around the corner (even more of a reason to on top of your restaurant) I did not wish to return but since we didn't finish our meals and had to leave to catch our show it would be nice to have this meal comped for our dining experience. Corporate, working the flood that evening, explained I would have to go back to Groupon to try to get a refund. I spoke with two other tables around me and they too said they are having \"an awful\" experience. When I spoke with the woman from corporate before leaving I shared how upset I was, the fact that nothing was able to be done for me at that moment was absolutely ridiculous. I pulled two random servers aside and asked if this is how the restaurant is and they said yes. I shared my apologies to them for having to work in such an establishment and they too responded, \"yes, this place isn't the greatest\". When I asked who was about corporate that was there and that id like their info as we are now running late for our show, she said \"you'll have to wait a moment\" and rolled her eyes at me. We waited per her request until she was finished with 3 other servers at a computer. She came back with the Managing Partner's business care whom I have every intentions on calling. Being s local and having a culinary degree, family owned restaurants, many many friends in the casino host business and a food critic I would never recommend this establishment when Fogo de Chao is around the corner.   What is advertised on Groupon and what actually shows up is False advertisement since nothing looked the way they had  advertised it.   So at the end of the day, we had to wait after making a reservation, dirty glasses and water, over cooked meat, paid $99 for two which includes surf & turf (never came with a second round of muscles I ordered). unlimited drinks for an hour (only was brought 2 drinks - one of which i had to track down someone to have them make me a 2nd drink, and dessert (which we were never offered).  I can go on and on about this place about how unhappy I was. Not only did Pampas ruin my date night with a terrible dinner, they also robbed me of my $99 for the meal since I wasn't told nothing could be done for me and I'd have to contact Groupon.   I have every intention of contacting the Managing Partner, Groupon, and Corporate. Furthermore, being a local and knowing individuals that can refer business I have ever intention to share my story and the photos I took of our experience.",

    "text": "Where do I begin?  My party of 6 called for a dinner reservation prior to 6 pm and was told it was unnecessary.  We had a very long night prior and did not wake to have breakfast or lunch.  We were famished as our last meal was the evening before.  We arrived at 7:45 pm and was told our wait would be approximately 20 minutes.  An hour later, we were seated.  A wonderful gentleman (the food runner, I assume) assisted my party and I.  He was very attentive and amiable.  Unfortunately, he was the only one who was such.  This gentleman filled our glasses immediately as we sat.  And we sat, and we sat.  And we stared at our 6 glasses of water.  A server never came.  We thought we were lucky when the manager stated he would assist and tend to our table.  Then we saw him walk out with his backpack and we were again left with no server.    The entire Pampas dining experience was HORRID.  We came to celebrate the birthday of a person in my party and her happiest moment was when we left.  At 10:30 pm.  This is when the party begins...  Birthday girl doesn't feel well and returns to the room to lay down.  One member of the party has bubble gut and excuses herself.  Another member utilizes liquid courage to help with her stomach pains as I sit in the casino drinking nothing but water and a can of Sugar Free Red Bull to ease the aching.  I proceeded to throw up 3 times in the restroom of the casino, 5 times on the floor of the casino, and 3 more times at the emergency room.  Though the rest of my party was also sick, my sickness was much more magnified due to my Type 1 Diabetes and the fear of any other underlying issues.    ER Copay:  $150 Missing departure flight:  $220 Being a vegetarian at Pampas:  PRICELESS (The 2 members who did not fall ill were vegetarians)  Two nights in the hospital, I missed my return flight home, 6.5 months later and my stomach still isn't the same.  I've travelled all over the world, eaten overseas, never had ANY issues as it relates to having a sensitive tummy.  Somehow, Pampas got us -- me, especially.    This review is not only a reflection of the FOOD and the SERVICE, but also the lack of good MANAGEMENT.  The day I was released from the hospital, I called to speak with Pampas' management to inform them of my party's issue.  My name and number was given.  That was February 19th, 2016.  I called two separate times and to this day, have not heard from one member of management.    Is there a possibility I give negative stars?  Because Pampas, you owe my party and I some stars.",

    "text": "We dined here Night 1 of our Vegas CES adventure. The other couple we were with are BIG Brazilian BBQ fans and they were really into it, I'm not as big of a fan and wouldn't have chosen it myself, but I was outnumbered as my husband likes these types of establishments as well. However, I did end up enjoying myself a lot more than I thought I would.  We went to Tix4Tonight and got a coupon that basically took off $18 a person for the all you can eat meal...so we paid $3 to get $18 off, a savings of $15 total. That made me feel better as I certainly didn't think I would eat almost $50 worth of meat, so I would definitely suggest doing this deal at Tix4Tonight.  All 4 of us got the all you can eat which includes a salad bar of various offerings like cheese bread rolls (OMG those were REALLY good!), garlic mushrooms, pasta salads, rice, mashed potatoes, etc. It was a nice showing and I enjoyed many of the things offered there.   They also have \"drink specials\" where you can pay $20 for unlimited beer and wine, $25 for unlimited beer, wine, and sangria, or $30 for unlimited beer, wine, sangria, and caipirhinas. I opted for the $25 and the other 3 opted for the $30. The caipirhina gal pushes a cart around in circles just re-filling as many as she possibly can. She will mix and match any flavors you want using syrups. Real caipirhinas typically used muddled fruit for flavors and not syrups, but since these were all you could drink and she needed to make a lot fast, they cheated and used syrup. This didn't detract TOO much, but for a caipirhina purist, it could be an issue. The service was excellent on all levels all night. We were never without drinks (which made the extra money mostly worth it), meats, or fresh plates.   The food itself was also good. They had a pretty big choice of different meats that they come around with on skewers cutting you off as much or little as you want. Almost everything we had was very good. Some of the meats come out more or less cooked and you can ask for the \"part\" you want. I myself like my meat well done so I asked for some of the beef well done and they actually went back and cooked me my own plate of well-done beef....nice touch.  While I wasn't thrilled to go here originally I did enjoy myself and my meal. I would not be opposed to going back if others in my group really wanted to go. I just feel like for $35 dollars (or $48 if you pay full price) you have to eat and love A LOT OF MEAT and I'm not a huge \"steak off a stick\" person LOL, but there are lots of people who are and I think if you're that kinda person, you'd love it! :-)",

Unfortunately, she didn't know the correct prices for the upgrades they try to sell you on. Nor did she tell us that the deal meal from the Hilton was only 3 ounces of meat.  Then 3 or more couples that arrived after us were seated before we were.  We wondered if th hostess knew we were here for a special deal.   I stuck with the 3 ounce deal and my husband upgraded to unlimited meat.  We both enjoyed a wonderful salad bar that could have served me dinner by itself. My husband enjoyed his many cuts of roasted meats.  It was a fun new approach for us.  Overall we were satisfied with the meal.  That almost overcame the poor communication that we experienced up front. Francisco was a good server.",

Pork, beef, chicken, sausage...a constant parade of meat and the occasional pineapple. The salad bar was beautiful but nothing compared to the service. The meat stewards were friendly and would bring orders to your table that were prepared to your liking.  Stephanie went over and beyond in making sure we were taken care of and stayed well satisfied.  One of the best places on the strip. In the beginning, most were on the well done side but they quickly corrected when asked for a fresh rare piece. Again, Stephanie really made this dinning experience a great time.",

So for $70 for 2 people you get a plate of over cooked supposedly grilled shrimp, dry and tasteless meats and nasty salad buffet! I was nice enough to give them 2 stars because the waiter was super nice! But save your money please and go somewhere else!!! It is NOT! I repeat NOT like a Fogo de Chao or EVEN close!!!!",

The waiters walked around with different meats on these giant skewers and they would slice the meat right into your plate. I had chicken, filet mignon, sausage, rib eye and some pork. All of which were cooked to perfection. A definite must have when your visiting Vegas!!",

My seafood platter with the shrimp was good. However the small pieces of mahi mahi was dry. The sliver of salmon was perfect. It was moist. The muscles were small and edible. I didn't care for them. The shrimp was delicious and cooked to perfection.  I had an iced tea. My hubby had a Coke. I also got my daughter an apple juice. The waitress forgot her apple juice, so I had to ask her a second time. She apologized. She was pretty good about refilling our drinks. The guys kept coming back offering us a variety of meats such as steak, chicken, pork & bacon wrapped chicken which I thought was delicious since I love bacon!  Service was a little lacking a first but the guys with the meats kept coming. I was stuffed with the salad bar. Had some Asian noodles (cold), cheese, melon, tomatoes & a mozzarella cheese ball. The salad bar is what filled me up. The best part was the free complementary cheesecake for my birthday! Awesome, Thanks to our nice waitress! This restaurant is located inside Planet Hollywood in a mall. I definitely recommend this place if you are staying in Vegas.  Pretty cool experience!",

    "text": "My wife bought the Groupon (lunch for 2) and we decided to give it a go this past Saturday. I was expecting it to be crowded since it's on the Strip/ we didn't make reservations and its a Saturday, but it wasn't too busy. We walked right in and were seated on the patio promptly (it's not outdoors but still a patio if that makes sense). Our server Felipe took care of the Groupon bit and got us started with drinks. I highly recommend the white sangria! I personally am not big on wine since I get wine headaches very easily and generally do not like the way it tastes. This white wine sangria however, was the best I've ever had! Light, sweet and chilled absolutely perfect! The salad bar had good options and was clean. Our server as well as the meat runners were VERY attentive! The meats were tender and tasty! I wasn't a fan of the chicken but the grilled pineapple was delightful! The seafood part of the lunch was delicious! Very nice sized shrimps! The muscles and salmon were tasty too, I think cod was served as well on the plate but I didn't try it. Now let me tell you about the dessert, cuz hot damn it was mind blowing. You get to choose from 4 dessert to split with your Groupon. They have a chocolate mousse, white chocolate cheesecake, and 2 other desserts to chose from ( I cant remember the other 2, I was really focused on the other 2). We chose the white cheesecake and I could easily eat it for the rest of my life! It was so soft and smooth without being overtly sweet like cheap white chocolate can be. All we ended up paying for was water, tax and gratuity.   TLDR; Get the white sangria. Meats are good, not over salted like some reviews say. Wait staff was fantastic. Get the white chocolate cheesecake because it's the very best!",

A lot of the food tasted pretty fresh and everything reminded me of Brazil.

Not much flavor and steak is not that tender. I would say i have better than other brazilian steakhouses. We had sausage, pork, chicken, steak and etc. Meats are acceptable but far from superb!   The worst thing is the wait time.. There was literally NO MEAt so we ended up eating salad and refillable seafood platter. We complained and followed up where are all the meats.. The table next to us was so annoyed too. I tried PAmpas in palo alto,ca but didnt have this bad service. Our server is awesome but the meat servers are just nowhere to be found.

The food here is really not worth the price. The meat is hardly seasoned and the selection is terrible. One of their \"12 cuts of meat\" offered is pineapple. You would be better off just going to Texas de Brazil for better food for a better price. Also don't waste your money on all you can eat shrimp, it was served room temp with shell on and like most of the stuff here tasted like nothing.   Final note ; the free dessert looked nothing like the other desserts they had around the place, it ended up being a dry brownie with some chocolate icing on top.",

    "text": "My second time here and it was just as good as I remember. First I must admit I don't eat beef. So my review personally is based on what I did eat - chicken and pork.   The chicken wrapped in bacon is heavenly. I've tried to duplicate it to no avail.  Somehow they are able to infuse the chicken with the smokey goodness of bacon and it is amazing!!!  I love a nice crusty piece of ham. Again they somehow are able to do this and retain the juicy ham goodness.  Their side buffet of choices had scrumptious offerings too. I love the fresh mozzarella drizzled with balsamic, garlic mashed potatoes and cheesy bread.   Nathan had his share of all the meats and said they were expertly done. Nothing bad to say about any of the cuts.   We were waited on expertly by Dave. He was ever present with a refill and blessedly absent while we were chowing away. The wandering meat carvers were plentiful and made sure we found just the cuts we were looking for.   This is a great deal with or without a coupon.",

We had to constantly asked where was the guy with the meet. The server we had was always apologizing for them not coming around. There was times he had to actually bring us a plate with some of the meat that they still had left. I would not recommend this Brazilian restaurant to any one. The food is just okay",

The guy out front literally asked if we had them before we went in. We waited for 10 minutes for a low top in the back.  Rather than choosing from the three options, we upgraded $10 for the meat and another $8 for the seafood.  The seafood was fine, but unnecessary in my opinion.  FYI, the bill looks a little weird.  It puts the meals down as salad bar and then removes the salad bar with the vouchers, so you are only charged for the upgrades. Our waiter, Dave (Great name), dropped off our drinks and we were off.  We went to the salad bar and they came by with different meats.  Lots of beef, chicken, ham, pork, lamb, etc.  Some were better than others.  Also, they had pineapples grilled too.  Very filling and high sodium feeling. It was a great time.  Not sure the prices without the vouchers.  If you get the vouchers, definitely go.  If you don't, you probably won't be disappointed either.  We had a great time.",

It asked if we were celebrating any special occasion at which I listed \"birthday\" We were celebrating my dad's 66th birthday as he was here visiting Las Vegas from Hawaii.  We arrived at 6:15pm and waited. The hostess told us that they would have the table prepared. Our seating arrangements weren't the most spectacular as we were seated at a round table about 5 feet directly in front of the entrance where there was constant foot traffic with people coming in and out.  We went with the \"Meat Rodizio\".  Unimpressed.  The \"parade of meats\" to our table were scarce as well as slow. It took forever for the servers with meat to come by our table.  They came by with the Filet Mignon once whereas the grilled pineapples 4 times.  Really? As far as the sides...the only good thing was the Pao de Queijo. The mash potatoes were runny and sour, it seemed like sides were not being refilled as at 6:30pm we were scraping the bottom of the serving warmers. The desserts were mediocre as well. We had the Flan, Cheesecake and some chocolate item that was made up of a brownie, chocolate mouse and some frosting on top. They didn't even acknowledge anything with dinner being celebrated as a birthday.  Sad to say, would not return here.",

We started with their salad and soups which were terrific but not so much as to lessen our appetite for the main courses. We had 9 different servings, all in the sizes we wanted and done just the way we like them. Then Antica and Hallie surprised me with the piece of cheese cake that was delicious. We can't wait to come back. Don't miss it when you're in town.",

All in all it is was a 70 buck dinner bc we upgraded and of course I got a bottle of cab sav. I was full and happy. So yeah do it.",

The photo for this GroupOn was on steak & lobster... We arrive, got seated and was told there is no lobster included in our meal... Instead we are served a plate with wilted fish, peel and eat shrimp & broken old looking mussels! We were told this was unlimited... The only thing we asked more of was the salmon & they finally delivered a piece, 25 minutes later.  We had to ask several busboys  for meat to be brought by our table because we sat for at least 10 minutes with nothing on our plates. Not quick at all on meat circulation. Finally after waiting more, the meat came out way..   I feel completely mislead by the description of this meal and then customer service experience was horrible!   There was a check in option on Yelp for a bottle of wine. I was denied the bottle of wine because the waitress said we didn't buy a full price meal? Shouldn't that be stipulated on check in? Free bottle of wine with purchase of a full priced meal for checking in? Again, misled....  Very disappointed. Won't ever come here again!",

Filthy is an understatement.  They had barely anything available and no staff to replenish. Dirty everywhere. Our glasses on the table were dirty.  They partner with some water hoax and charge you $1 person for water but don't ask if you even want it first. I understand it's only a $1 but at least check if we want it since we had ordered another beverage. Since they poured it out of the bottle and we didn't drink it since the glasses were disgusting I'm sure they just refilled from the tap.  No cutlery until we asked which was about 20 min after our server decided to return after socializing with his friend. The hand carved meat came around once as there was one guy serving all options to the entire restaurant. I had a paper thin slice of steak that tasted great but maybe they only had enough for the entire restaurant on the one stake. Utterly disappointed with everything about this place. You are better eating at literally any other restaurant in Vegas. For a less than mediocre buffet and 2 coffees we paid $40...oh and water we didn't ask for or drink that I'm certain is from the tap.",

Every marketing material shows the breakfast brunch opens at 7:00; the signs out front, small marketing cards, and online all indicate the same hours (yelp says 8:30...so nothing matches up). Imagine our surprise when we got up early to enjoy a nice breakfast after walking down the strip, arriving at 7:35 to the doors locked and no sign of it opening. The people inside ignored us and eventually came over after we knocked. They didn't open the door, rather gestured \"8.\" It was really poor from the restaurant and the staff. We will not be back again in hopes that they actually open when advertised.",

    "text": "Came here to eat for my birthday in Vegas.  My husband had a coupon for $50 off which we thought was a good deal.  I had read all the yelp reviews so I knew what to expect.  When I arrived there were a lot of people waiting and they also had reservations.  Most people that were waiting, also waited a long time and were getting disgruntled.  I believe this is because most people are willing to try this because of the coupon from either watching a show or from going to a time share presentation like I did.  But once you get seated things come pretty fast.  The best value for your buck, is the buffet which cost about $59.  You get assess to the buffet bar which has some delicious mashed potatoes, some chicken, soup etc.  Different waiters come around and slice different kinds of meat for you to eat.  My husband is more of a meat eater.  I am not.  I ordered the salmon with rice and green beans. I have to say, this salmon was the best salmon I ever tasted.  I was actually very impressed.  So happy that I found this place.  The negative is the wait and the disorganized hectic mess from all the people waiting. Since is it is so busy our waitress was overwhelmed and she was a bit short and impatient with all the people that were seated.  I understand how she feels, but again this makes you feel a bit uneasy.  Overall, this is a good place to eat with very delicious meat.  Just don't expect the service to be a 5 star.  Expect the service to be a 2 or a 3 and the food tot be about a 4 or a 5. Don't be in a hurry it gets busy and everyone is waiting an extra 15 to 20 min more even with a reservation.  At least if you know this you won't be annoyed or upset.",

I've been to both Pampas Grill in Los Angeles so I thought that maybe this one was somewhat similar. I'll tell you one thing. Aside from the name, this place has absolutely NOTHING to do with Pampas in LA. Very frustrating. The buffet is tasteless. The meat is either overly cooked or the cow is bleeding. The ambient is not bad at all, the overall look is good and I think someone should revamp the kitchen and make sure they are serving real Brazilian barbecue or simply change the name of the restaurant.

    "text": "When it comes to Vegas Brazilian steakhouses, you can forget about \"Texas De Brazil\" and \"Fogo De Chao\" -- \"Pampas Grille\" has been in business longer and does it WAY better! Trust me, as a Vegas local of 15 years who has a longtime Brazilian girlfriend, I know what I'm talking about -- \"Pampas,\" Vegas' first Brazilian steakhouse, is less expensive, better tasting, more authentic, and has superior customer service than any Brazilian place in town.   Over the last decade or so, I've eaten here for holidays, casual meals, romantic dinners, catered events and even bachelor parties, but I've never had a single bad experience or known anyone who has. It seems to be an extremely well-run restaurant with an attentive staff that's eager to meet every customer's needs.   Whether you're a \"rare\" individual, a stickler for \"well-done\" steak, or even a staunch vegetarian, this place will make sure you leave happy. And in a tourist town like Vegas where customer service is king, the importance of that quality can't be overstated.   Plus, there are always a bunch of coupons and deals you can find online that will make your bill even cheaper!   In summary, if you're visiting the betting capital of the country and looking for a great place to eat, \"Pampas Grille\" might be the safest bet you'll make during your entire stay.",

We both had 2 3oz TAIL pieces of cheap chum salmon that was processed in China making it twice frozen with a scoop of mashed and a dozen string beans $28,00. We sent both back and then got the SAME TAIL PIECES only this time about 4oz each. If not for our friends we would have left then we took a few bites and that was it,  Our other friend ordered the NY Strip that he said was tough and tasteless once again about $25.  They are committing consumer fraud by serving farmed shrimp as GULF shrimp. I have no issue with farmed shrimp but they can not mislabel it.   Our friend with the meat deal was served mussels that she said were dry yet mushy and tasted sour, Most likely a cheap pre frozen product she tried only one the others were dry as well  Based on the alert of planted reviews and our experience it looks like they have dubious ethics.

We asked two staff about a coupon we had. They told us your waiter would explain. We wanted to know before being seated. We were in town to vacation. My mother arrived on the 1st and we decided to take her here. When seated I asked the waiter do they sing for birthdays. He replied no. Ok. A few moments later the table behind us is being sung the birthday song by staff? Ok. We ordered shrimp and steak rodizio. We had to ask for the shrimp several times. When he came back I asked him. He said it was not staff. I said I was looking dead at staff. He then brought over the person singing with some lame explanation that they join in if diners are singing? So I started to sing and he didn't join in, so I started again. The waiter came back to state see I wasn't lying. I said you still kind of were. The food was tough and fatty. It took a while to get wife's because she wanted well done. Finished meal and was offered desert. We chose one and the waiter states it's cost. Now granted the entire night every server has explained to every guest that if you post a picture and review to yelp it's free. There's also a huge sign in the front if the restaurant. I asked him, Rigo about this and he said well do you have a review and photo ( very matter of fact). Of course I already had it ready since he never offered to explain it. I will say the one thing he explained well is the amount of tip he should receive and why it was \"recommended\" I tip on what would have been the full amount which was over $100 more than actual. The irony after telling me no they don't sing and sending someone over to tell us they don't sing. They bring the desert out and like 4 staff to sing happy birthday. Anyway this was likely our last trip to this restaurant. And they even charged for table water on top of the charge for drinks. We stayed in Vegas for a week and went to several restaurants. They were the only ones to charge for water?",

Meat selection are not as food as Fogo de Chao or Texas DE Brazil. Seafood not that great either. They ran out of Mussels.  Our friends were not up to drinking to much so we didn't booze up to make it worth the amount what was charged. *Caution they charge $2 water conservation  charge per person in addition to the amount already paid plus if you have a group of 8 or more they charge gratuity on the $174 undiscounted  price.  Which in total we paid an additional $41 dollars...  so the total for 2 is 99+41= $140 ... I would recommend you just go to the Aria, Bellagio, or  Wynn Dinner Buffet instead!",

We have been here about three times so this restaurant is nothing new to us. We came back because of drinks were included in the deal. Can't beat the Groupon deal especially in Las Vegas where drinks alone can be $12-$15 each. Food tasted good and service was good as well. We will definitely come back if Groupon is offer another deal. Much better deal than the coupon. Don't dine here because it can be really expensive if you don't have any kind of coupon.

    "text": "I think that people who have never been to this particular Brazilian/Argentinian-style restaurant seem intrigued by the presentation, and relatively satisfied.  However, there are a lot more thumbs-down reviews of this place, and having been to many churrascarias, this is among the worst...largely due to the food, but partly due to their latest marketing strategies to pick your pocket.  The full name of this place is \"Pampas Brazilian Grille\" and you'll find it squirreled away in a remote corner of the \"Miracle Mile\" shops inside the Planet Hollywood complex adjacent to a nondescript door on Harmon Avenue.  They are prevalent with many of the online discounters, so we chose (and you should too!) to purchase a voucher on TravelZoo, dinner for FOUR ($94 - $10 code I found online) = $84.  That also includes one bottle of \"house wine,\" or they'll give you $32 against any other wine they carry. We passed once we looked at the overpriced wine listed.  Still sounds like a great deal though, huh?  Of course, the waiter is all about upselling you from your low-priced voucher the minute you sit down, so be sure to get your friendly-but-firm face on to defer his suggestions.  The salad bar here is very ordinary--in fact, not even as good as a decent Las Vegas hotel buffet--and certainly pales in comparison to other churrascarias in town.  Most of these places are known for the astounding arrays in their salad bars, and you literally have to be careful not to fill up on all that, so you'll have room for the more expensive main course: MEAT!  Their MEAT:  Regrettably, we were served uniformly poor cuts of almost everything they offer.  When's the last time you had \"filet mignon\" (if that's what it really was) that was full of gristle, hard to cut and worse to chew? So disappointing, and DISGUSTING!  The series of other beef cuts were equally awful, either due to lack of seasoning or poor cooking (either way overcooked or raw inside), with the exception of their \"house special\"--a top sirloin cooked about right with an appealing outer seasoning.  The bacon-wrapped chicken breast was also edible, but so what--it's just chicken.  I ended up filling up mostly on salad and mashed potatoes when I sasw where this was going.  A member of our party had to ask a couple of times for lamb (I passed), but said it was definitely not worth the wait.  I had lamb once at Texas de Brasil (another terrible churrascaria restaurant in Vegas) that was so gamey/nasty, I literally ran to the bathroom to vomit. I swore to myself: never again.  Anyway, at $22 per person (before the extra charges and tip), I guess we got about what we would expect, but really didn't consider it a great value (or a very good meal), and certainly glad we didn't pay more than we did.  When the waiter brought the check, it included sales tax (about $6, not included with the voucher) and a \"water conservation fee\" of $1 per person (?) = $4. No explanation on that one (seems like another BS charge to me), considering that they are just serving tap water in some weird decanter.  Is this a city/county mandated fee that goes into conserving water there?  Our not-very-personable, mostly inattentive waiter then proceeds to point out that if we had paid full price, the bill would be ~$230, and the suggested tip would be 20% = ~$45!!  He wanted to stand right there in front of me while I filled out that tip amount to be included on my credit card charge.  Good luck with that strategy, my friend.  I told him to bring me the charge slip just for the tax and \"water conservation\" fee.  I left a $30 cash tip, concluding that was more than generous for the very minimal amount of time he and his meat-serving, deadbrained buddies spent on us (don't bother to ask those clowns for anything...they'll say no problem and that's the end of that).    Bottom line: bad food, tourist trap...steer clear, mateys!",

The meat and seafood started coming and they were coming so frequently that I had to turn the sign to red! They didn't seem to be paying attention to what color you turn it to cause they still kept coming up to our table. I was not impressed with the meat or the desserts.

Him and Claudia treated us fantastic and they are great bartenders. The food was pretty great as well and we really enjoyed the unlimited meats, seafood, salad, and drinks.

    "text": "I'll start my review by saying that I don't like to mention other restaurants' names during reviews, I don't feel it's fair, but with that said.  If you are living in or near Las Vegas and you want this type of restaurant, there are three other very much more viable options available throughout the city, look them up, it'll be worth it.  All three have better tasting meats, friendlier service and a much better salad bar.   When we were seated the waiter comes over and without even asking starts pouring water from a glass bottle, I don't pay for water, but I looked around and every other table had the same bottle of water, so I thought that is just the way they served it here.  I have been to places that provide bottled water free; however after receiving the bill we were charged $2.00, I know that's not a lot but we weren't even given a choice.  The salad bar was a mess, many of the ingredients looked like they'd been sitting for a while, despite us arriving just 30 minutes after dinner began.  It's also cramped and small, several times while I was up there, restaurant staff was in my way. One person was putting dishes out, but I really don't know what the others were doing, cause they weren't cleaning or putting out fresh selections. Also they filled their salad bar with three different kinds of pasta.  I don't pay this amount of money for pasta.  I will say that the meats were flavorful and the servers came around plenty, but all the side dishes are part of the salad bar which i've not experience previously, usually they are brought to the table prior to meats being served.  This caused two issues, one it makes the salad bar have less of a selection and second it takes away from the experience of the meats if you have to keep getting up for fresh potatoes, or rice, or plantains, etc.  The price for dinner here is $79.95, that is way higher than other places in town. The men's bathroom was a mess!, there was urine on the walls and the floor, paper towels and toilet paper pieces were scattered about.  The toilet paper dispenser was broken and wouldn't close so it interfered with sitting on the toilet.  If you're a local, leave this place to the tourists.",

(it seemed like we were always the last table to be served so we got all the pieces towards the center). the sirloin really let me down. i wasn't lucky enough to get the 1st slice, but by the 3rd slice the meat was a little too rare to my liking. the following rounds of sirloin all came to our table well done. the bacon wrapped turkey was good, but i would have loved to have some bacon wrapped filet.  we've definitely had better, but we chose this place because we were hungry, but didn't want to go to one of the usual vegas buffets. if you choose to do the same, you can save a bunch by purchasing your meals via tix 4 tonight. they have a 50% off special for lunch at pampas.",

So we slowly walked down to this restaurant. Had to wait for maybe 10 minutes because at the time I didn't realize it, but there was a wedding reception going on. We got seated in the private room or maybe not so private since the entire room was made of glass. We all ordered the rodizio style because by now it's our lunch time and we were all starving. First round of food came around, then the second, then third. A total of 7 meats came around, but not all the meats were good. Some of it was way overcooked. I could barely chew it, so I just left it on my plate, thus the reason I didn't give this place 5 stars. The service on the other hand was spectacular. Everyone even the guys who cut the meats were funny and very attentive. The service basically makes up for the food at this place. Next time around, maybe just maybe I might try the breakfast.",

At times the meat was a little slow in coming out but once it arrived it was very good. They have a great and might I say the best pear martini I have ever tasted. I even got a free piece of cake that was very nicely decorated. I would definitely go back to Pampas on my next trip to Las Vegas.",

    "text": "This place by far is the worst Brazilian churrascaria I've ever been to.  My boss married a Brazilian woman and lived in Brazil for four years, and I've had the good pleasure of eating at places they've recommended (and with him on several occasions).  They KNOW Brazilian churrascarias.  This place is for posers.    Their salad bar contained smoked salmon with cucumbers, Greek olive and feta salad, and caprese salad.  I love these things, but I neither want nor expect them at a Brazilian restaurant.  I expect BRAZILIAN food.  They had 3 selections of beef. They had roast turkey and sausage. They had 1 pork selection. That was it.  And it was mostly overcooked.  No chicken hearts (my fav at Brazilian BBQ joints)  Their dessert menu contained creme brulee, tiramisu, and cheesecake.  Because those were all invented in Brazil.  At least they carried Brazilian liquors and made Brazilian cocktails.  The bartender was pretty helpful and seemed like a nice guy.  The service was terrible, with the picanha coming around only once.  We specifically had to ask another waiter to have the other waiter come over.  Frustrated, we called over the manager.  She was attentive but after airing our grievances (poor service, WTF menu items, and overcooked meats) she primly said, \"Sir, we cater to mainstream tastes.\"  If you wear a striped shirt and act like a complete douchebag when you go to Vegas, this place is for you, cara de buceta.",

Robert, the host, was really welcoming and nice! and then the manager, Pascual (or Paco as I've come to know him) is EXTREMELY NICE! and not to mention a really GOOD LOOKING GUY! =D so that was a MAJOR PLUS!  the first time we were there, Pascual was really nice to me and my girls.  The next day, Robert was doing some club promoting, and we met him outside. When we got in, the females were really nice, and got us seated in a BETTER area of the restaurant.  Instead of piling up at the salad bar again, i got as little as possible, and just waited for the meats and sea food to start.  Out of nowhere, Pascual came by to check on us. WOW! so nice! he then said that we needed to make room for desert, but i didn't know if i was going to be able to have the room.  we were still working on our food, and once we finally thought we were done, the server came and cleared our table.  My girls and i were just chatting away, when out of nowhere...... 3 DESERTS CAME! WOW! we did not expect to get desert! Pascual said to make room for desert, but we were not expecting to get 3 different kinds! sooooooooooo good!  the desert put us over the top! Pascual even gave it to us on the house!  the next person that hits up Pampas, ask for Pascual and tell him Kat says, \"hey boo!\" LoL... he'll remember me! =D",

We've been to a few churrascarias in San Francisco, New York and Rio de Janeiro so it being Las Vegas we assumed it would be just as tasty.  This place was the worst churrascaria ever.  All the meats were very dry and bland.  The pork was all fat I couldn't even eat it and the sides selection was minimal.  But even before all of that we had a reservation and they still made us wait about 20 min before getting seated and when we got seated we waited another 10 min before we were acknowledged.  So yes the service was bad.  I would never recommend this place! Stay away it's horrible!",

We did unfortunately have a hard time finding it once inside Planet Hollywood, probably just poor planning. Pampas was very busy upon arrival, which it to be expected on a Sat evening, we were told the wait would be about 20 min, only had to wait about 10.  The indoor seating is very nice, the outdoor seating isn't quite as nice, not a busy end of the casino, but people are still walking by.  We were very happy with the service, everyone was very nice and personable. It was quite nice that a large portion of the staff was also Brazilian, made it more real. I was some one disappointed by the side dish bar, was not the freshest, and limited variety. The fried bananas are amazing though! The meat was spectacular and they kept it coming, and was never left without!  Would recommend to anyone, but suggest going with reservations, and lots and lots of time to eat.",

At half price we definitely enjoyed the meal, but at $43 bucks regular price you could spend an additional $5 dollars and take advantage of the pre-fixe menu at any number of great dining options along the strip. Surprisingly, for being a Brazilian Steakhouse the steak was the disappointing part of the meal. The filet was way overcooked and the sirloin, while perfectly medium rare was also perfectly bland. The other items we sampled included the ham, bacon wrapped turkey, sausage and pork loin were all very tasty. Salad bar was solid with a variety of items to choose from. Only salad bar item that was off was the antipasto salad. We would return with half price tickets in the future.",

We had a reservation for 8:00 and we got there a half an hour early and waited at the bar until 8:30, and never got a table.  We ended up eating at the bar.  We sat next to a nice couple and they had been waiting an hour for meat.  We went to the sald bar and it was no different then a cheap buffet.  I ordered the surf and turf but I never saw any surf.  NOT ONE PIECE!  The meat was horrible, all the beef was well done and had no flavor.  Other people around us were having the same experience.  I can't believe anyone could post that they enjoyed this place I would be wary of those posts.  We wasted our night out and paid a high price for cheap cafeteria food.  Do your self a favor and go anywhere else.",

I will have to try Fogo de Chao after reading the other reviews.  The food was very good in my view (the a/c at Samba's was so cold that the food would be inedible in seconds), particularly the sirloin (very tasty), the pork loin (juicy and tender) and the feijoada and plantain croquettes. I could probably live on these last two for the rest of my life and not complain, but that's just me. Service was very friendly, but slow at first. There was no one else seated in our section, so we waited for about  10 minutes without anyone taking our drink order. We finally spotted the host and complained, and he took our drink order right away. The service improved quite a bit after that. I will definitely go back (especially if I snatch one of those coupons everyone is talking about).",

    "text": "I was very disappointed with my experience at Pampas.  The evening started when my wife and I walked up to the hostess and were not greeted with friendly \"Welcome to Pampas...\" or other nice greeting, it was straight \"Can I help you.\"  Next, even thought I had made reservations through their website, received a confirmation email earlier that day, they had no record of my reservation.  We wound up waiting about 10 minutes and it wasn't even that crowded.  We were seated to see 3 Rodizio servers in our section and were quite excited to get the Rodizio experience started.  However, it took about 5 minutes for our server to come and take our drink order.  We then went to the salad/side bar to get our sides and returned to our table.  We flipped the token to green to indicate we wanted to be served but we wound up waiting and waiting.  In the first 15 minutes at our table, we were offered only 2 meats.  Meanwhile our sides got cold.  Service was horrible.  We wound up keeping our token up signaling we wanted service the whole time.  There was one server who wouldn't even stop at our table.  It was as if we were invisible to her.  To top it all off the meat wasn't even that good.  Throughout the evening the service never got better.  We were never offered 2 of the meat selections on the menu even though they were paraded around the dining area by servers.  We were very disappointed.  I had gone online and received a $40 father's day gift certificate essentially only paying for one meal.  Unfortunately we still paid too much.  I filled out the comment card at the end of our meal and personally delivered it to the manager to express my displeasure.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  Save your money and go somewhere else... or if you want the Brazilian Grille experience, go somewhere else.",

They flat out don't bring you any meat and when you ask for the expensive meat they just don't bring it to your table.  When they do bring you meat you wish they didn't bother since it was either overcooked, undercooked or just chewy.     The service was even worse than the food.  I asked for tri tip three times before they brought me some charred meat that looked and tasted like charcoal.  I asked for a glass of water 2 times and had to go to the bar to get it myself and they simply refused to bring you a clean plate, after asking for one 2 times I gave up.   The sad reality is they know you are a tourist and you won't be eating in Las Vegas on a regular basis so they don't care if you are happy dining at they restaurant.",

She didnt check periodically, when I asked if I could change my drink not only did she have an attitude she took over 30mins to bring a replacement drink. The servers dont know the difference between raw and well done meat. No matter which server, I requested well done and instead received bloodly. The only one not bloody was the burnt sausage. The unlimited drinks package for an hour sounds nice until you are spending most of that hour waiting to get your drink, kinda defeated the purpose. Slow service would be understandable if they were busy, but that wasn't the case. The fastest service received throughout the whole night was the bill. I believe it was because we paid cash and the waiter thought she would be receiving a tip. If you really want to get your moneys worthjust go to Fogo de Chao. WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!!",

Service was decent, coupon made me feel otherwise.  Especially after our waiter told us the bill would only be a little more than $44 with the coupon.",

The salad bar is small than most places I am use to.  However, I must hand it to their salad with the crasins with the option of strawberry or ranch dressing.  It was delicious with strawberry dressing.  Their muffins are dry.  Their fried bananas are meh.    During lunch, they only serve seven meats--ham and pineapple, sausage, spicy chicken, barbeque chicken, turkey wrapped in bacon, and two other meats I cannot remember.  They do not have my favorites-- filet mignon wrapped in bacon and sausage with melted cheese.   The pineapple is very juicy and delicious.  For some reason, their pineapple tasted juicier than Rei Do Gado or Texas de Brazil.   Overall, I had better Brazilian food.  I didn't like how they only served seven meats during the lunchtime.  In San Diego, they serve more than seven meats with filet mignon wrapped in bacon and sausage with melted cheese during lunch.  Thank God my boyfriend and I had a lunch voucher.  I wouldn't want to spend nearly 19 dollars if I can have more meat in San Diego with a lower price.",

They serve those shrimps in their shells and when I asked the waitress if they can prepare the shrimps without she denied my request. They don't want to please a customer and serve what you are asking for. That night I dressed nicely for the show and I ended up playing with those stupid shrimps. After consuming those shrimps I had stomach ache and I threw up. I assume their food is not fresh. Another issue was that the waitress barely served us. She brought water only one time and at the end she wrote down on the check that she wants $20 tip in a very creative way taking into account some ramped up prices from the sky that I would never consider to pay for this kind of food. They also try to bribe you into giving them a good Yelp review by offering you a free desert. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL.",

We especially liked the little garlicky cheesy pop-overs. Our rib steak platter had items that were also on the salad bar. There is SO much waste of food. I like the option of having water filtered 9 times, however, I didn't like having it poured in a glass and being charged $1.00 per person before I was told I would be charged.

Tri tip was the best meat- although the skewered pineapple was pretty tasty- if that and adding a1 to the meat says anything  Desserts weren't bad.

We're super glad this was NOT out first experience with Brazilian steak house/grille. If it were,we prob would've never tried anywhere else.

Three assistant waiters brought us a bottle of water within 5 minutes, a server attempted to serve us someone's shrimp that we did not order, they served our appetizer and dinner at the same time. The filets and potatoes were good except the green beans were way overdone! My friend did not get her lobster tail with her dinner, we were told they gave it to someone else.  To top it off, we were seated in the outside area, near the front door. We witnessed the waiters with the meats on the sticks walking through the palms out front to get to the other side with the meat touching the palm leaves.  It was very busy with a long line so the waiters were walking outside between the customers in line and one touched a customers hair.   Not a place for me that is very picky about food safety.",

We came at around lunchtime when it there was light foot traffic and great service. We were greeted promptly by our hostess and seated just as quickly.   Rigo, our server was very attentive and thorough, my boyfriend and I had his lunch suggestions which were the Meat and Ultimate Surf and Turf Rodizio. The mat cuts were delicious my absolute favorite being the Picanha, I nearly put myself into a food coma off of that alone.   The lunch menu was pretty reasonably priced for the amount of food that is served and the salad bar was always full. All in all, I personally enjoyed this place and when I'm craving hearty, savory meats, it will definitely be on my mind.",

None of the seafood appetizing; the shrimp were over cooked and mushy, the fish was a little rubbery. The grilled meats and pineapple were really good. So, I recommend not paying the extra for the seafood option. The grilled meats are totally worth it.  3/27/18 - Update: added 1 star to Pampas. Brought my daughter for our dinner after a show. I had a Groupon for here which didn't download correctly but the waiter price matched our dinner which was great. It was crowded but only a 10 minute wait. The meats were awesome as always and the shrimp were good this time. Only thing left to address is the salad bar. Good options but chaos in a tiny area because everyone is there at the same time.",

(I'm 7 months pregnant so didn't think much of it) So I tried to eat the meat they bring around and couldn't eat much. During the middle of the night I woke up to the worse abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea. (As well as my poor 2 year old son). We ended up in urgent care and the doctor told us it was more than likely food poisoning. All we had that day was cereal and pb and j sandwiches to work up an appetite for Pampas.  I contacted the manger Mike at Pampas the next day and explained to him what happened. He said he would look into it and give me a call in the morning. He never returned my call, so I called him around 3 pm to see what happened. He acted like he had no idea who I was so explained everything again and made it seem like I was lying. I asked him if I took him my discharge paper work from the urgent care with the diagnosis if he could at least  refund my meal which cost $50 and he said no. So I was out $50 plus my dr visit copays and the copays for our prescriptions. I didn't even get an apology from this man!   We loved going to Pampas and every time we were in Vegas it was a must! Now I'm so disappointed in the customer service that we will not be going back. Being pregnant and a 2 year old child makes you more susceptible to food borne illnesses and unfortunately I had the worst experience of my life here and they didn't care. Highly disappointed.",

There was a wait and was not long at all. Miracle Mile has a \"mall\" feel to it but this place was just as classy as an Olive Garden. I was expecting a sample of their wine but apparently they don't do samples here. I got the steak plate which included the buffet style salad bar in the back. I think the decor in here is nice and the cheesey bread was my favorite thing to pickup from the buffet. I noticed the servers are all kind of snooty in here, they certainly weren't the friendliest I've ever met. Our server was prompt but it just seemed robotic and she was doing her bare minimal. I would say the customer service is okay. Our food was phenomenal but portions were very small. There were just four slices of very thin steak but I was able to load up on the salad bar so I wouldn't starve.",

The salad bar was very basic compared to Fogo de Chao or Texas de Brazil. We had the seafood platter and it was just ok. The steak selections were minimal and they were all pretty nasty. I think the only reason this place is in business is because of all the tourists that want to try something new. They have someone outside trying to get people to come in. I really wanted to tell people \"Don't do it! You are better off at McDonald's!!\"",

We sat down quickly and the waitress came over and was very odd when rambling on the menu and kept making a big deal about coupons and if we wanted any or asked we had to speak to the manager. We ordered drinks and the waitress brought them and left didn't see her much. The meat came around very slow and wasn't impressed at all with the salad bar. I finally asked for a refill on my tea. About 5- 10 min later she finally brings me tea with melted ice... iced tea is supposed to have ice right?? Especially in vegas where it's hot as hell. So I politely ask for ice she takes the cup and seems annoyed and I never see again. I had to go find the manager and ask for tea and explain she took the cup and never returned.  All the while him and two other Co workers or management Is sitting on there butt talking. He brings me the tea with ice and I'm annoyed now politely tell him we live here we aren't tourists so if service is bad we don't return.  He doesn't seem to care and now I see why all the reviews are bad here. Lol by then my meat is cold and lunch is runied. We finish and have to ask the waitress for our check of which she didn't even have the sense to apologize or say sorry. Of which goes along ways with me. I understand we all have bad days or shit going on and not a good day. She could have redeemed herself with a simple hey I'm sorry. But she dropped the check off and walked away with nothing... apparently management doesn't care how the employees come off to customers or assume this is vegas we will get business anyways. Nor did management have the nerve to apologize and say hey sorry about the service i will speak to her and send her over.  Was the worse service I've had in along time and won't be going back. Now I know why the waitress said she use to work at another Brazilian steak house here in town. Must not have been up to there standards. Save your money and go elsewhere.  Too many other great places in Vegas!!",

With the voucher you get a free entree or for $10 upgrade to the rodizio which is unlimited roasted meat. If you have this kind of deal, I highly recommend the rodizio. The waiters constantly come around with huge skewers of meat and cut fresh pieces off for you at your table. There's a good selection of sirloin, chicken, pork and even pineapple. It's a great deal if you're hungry and the food is solid (although I wouldn't say it's amazing). You also have unlimited access to the salad bar and the sides including vegetables,rice, mashed potatoes, Brazilian cheese bread, etc. It's definitely pricey without some sort of deal but if you are good at buffets, then it might be worth it.",

Our experience here was very disappointing.  The food was mediocre in comparison to other restaurants like this one and our service was almost non existent. It only took 5 minutes to seat us in a restaurant that was less than half full but then it took an additional 20 minutes to bring a glass of water to the table. It is the first time I have ordered my drink and entree at the same time and the entree arrived first. It took over 10 minutes to get a simple soda refill and that only happened once throughout our entire  meal. We were there for 2 hours to have a simple Brazilian style lunch where they bring the meat to your table! This is not a restaurant that I would waste my vacation time on even if you get a free voucher.",

The meat was delicious!! The pork was my fav! BUT it did take a while for them to bring out more meat and we had to keep asking about the pineapple we ordered like 5times!

The food itself was fine, but nothing special in my opinion.  The chicken and sausage were my favorite meats, and thankfully the chicken was moist and not dried out like it can get sometimes.  The beef dishes were ok, but I found the meat to sometimes be tough or chewy, which is surprising considering how it's cooked.

He had a huge attitude with several guests as they were going back & forth asking questions about cocktails. But after everyone was finished ordering (a table of about 15) we went to the salad bar to start. The salad bar had some hot items and a good variety of appetizer-esque dishes.  Cut to about 30 minutes later when our drinks finally arrived... AWFUL! Didn't even bother drinking the nasty cocktail that was served. Good thing we didn't want anything else because our waiter NEVER RETURNED TO THE TABLE!!!!!! We were a large party there for about 2+ hours and only saw our waiter when he took the drink orders & then when the bill was paid.... WTF!? Next the meat started to arrive... Finally we would \"get our monies worth\"... WRONG. Meat was bland, overcooked & of poor quality. You would think a Brazilian Steakhouse would offer quality proteins, maybe that was too much to ask.  While the majority of us went with the Surf & Turf a member of our party had ordered a simply medium rare fillet mignon with a potato side which took OVER AN HOUR to arrive. By which time we were ready to pack our bags so we got it boxed to go & our friend left without eating a thing. I would never recommend this place to anyone nor will we ever return. The service was horrendous, the drinks awful & the food disgusting.",

    "text": "Stopped in last Friday 2/13 @ 6:30 pm. We were starving so a rodizio seemed like a good call. We sat down- actually took 3 attempts to get the table we asked for. Once we sat down, we noticed the place was a mess. We saw only 2 servers with meat skewers in 10 minutes. We looked at the salad bar and I must say, it was insufficient and looked like a college salad bar circa 1986. Poor quality, unkept, and small. We just left. It was not even worth a try.",

Come back 10 min later and ppl before and ppl walking in are getting seated. They seat us and no one comes to greet us or do anything. Then i notice only 2 meat carvers thats bullshit. Doesnt matter what day of the week or what time. You're on the strip it should be top notch service. My fiance and i decide to go to the salad bar and see what happens. We come back and nothing. Still no one helping us. Horrible horrible horrible. I rather pay extra and go to texas de brazil or fogo de chao. Fuck this place",

I went with my family and had the following experience: Hassled to take a picture so they could charge us to buy it. Hassled to buy bottled water for our table instead of bringing tab water as asked. Hassled to buy a drink that they bring to your table, they ask you to try without informing you of the price - made it seem it was for free. I had to ask three times before I was told the price. Shame on them.  They charge half price and then try to hassle you into buying other over-priced items. Shame on them - the worse part is after you say no they keep asking to the point you get anger and annoyed.  Shame on them",

Come on an empty stomach and plan to stay awhile! Only complaint was my wife's drink. She had a mojito and there were so many limes in it (5 wedges in total were in the drink and I don't know why) that her drink became bitter. She was given another drink (half because Lili said you want a whole new drink as half the glass was gone). She didn't care she just couldn't finish the drink so she settled for half. It came with no mint and 3 lime wedges... My drink was great however and I enjoyed everything so I'll give them 4 stars!!",

    "text": "Jeremy was spot on that Pampas compares poorly to a real rodizio (Two words: chicken hearts. [they don't have them, so don't tell me about the \"7 tradition chrruascaria meats\"] What should one expect from a restaurant named for a region more associated with a different country than what it purports to be.). It was adequate, but would not have been worth the price if we'd paid full price. Like many of our fellow diners, we had a voucher for one entree and (one trip to?) the salad bar, so we took the $8 up-sell to the full meats. That wasn't bad. (What is a normal tip on a meal with an artificially high price, and half self-service?)   The salad bar wasn't overwhelming, but had a few particularly good items (grilled mushrooms, hearts of palm, tortellini.)   There is an open-bar option: unlimited beer, wine, sangria or caiparinha for $20. That's probably a good deal if you were going to order drinks anyway and drink heavily. At their prices a 3rd drink would probably cost more.   Loss of a star (and should have been a loss of tip) when our waiter asked we wanted to drink we said 'Just water.' He asked 'Still or sparkling?\" I found out that is a trick question, as he brought a liter bottle of water.   When the bill came (after a long wait trying to get the waiter's attention) there was about an $8 charge for the water. The waiter was at that point holding a pitcher of water. I asked about the charge and he said \"I asked you still or sparkling and you said 'still'\"  I pointed to the pitcher of ice water he was holding and said \"What do you call that?\" and he said \"Tap water.\"  I said \"When we said '_just_ water' that's what we wanted, it's not sparkling.\" He said he would find the manager and have it taken off.   I'm sure the time share that gave us the voucher compensates the restaurant. We accepted the up-sell for more meat. (The limited menu, and a big plate from the salad bar, would have been sufficient.) There is no need to nickel-and-dime the tourists. (Some of us argue the charge, the rest probably pay the $8 for what is indistinguishable from tap water. [I grew up on NY Catskills water, and there is nothing funky about the Las Vegas tap water.]) I cannot recommend a restaurant that tried to rip me off.",

The buffet portion had danishes (which were disappointing and seemed to be the same kind you get in cheap continental breakfasts in mid-range hotels), potatoes, eggs, french toast,  breakfast burritos, a good selection of watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew, pineapple, etc.   The \"main event\" for the breakfast is the meat which was sirloin, ham, two types of sausage and grilled pineapple. The sirloin was cooked just right (not too juicy or dry) but I wasn't a big fan of the sausage. The ham and pineapple were both quite good. The place was pretty empty when we got there around 10 and the service was good. The meat guys came around frequently and the waitress asked if there was anything meat we'd like them to bring out again right before we left.   I had a $2.99 bloody mary which was great and had a spicy kick to it rather than just a salty taste. My wife had a mimosa and said it was good as well.  Overall for $12.99 it's not a bad deal if you like meat and it's a very good deal for $7.99.",

If you are looking for salad bar they have a few premixed salads (thus the disappointment of a few reviewers), on the side bar, but its mostly side salads, potatoes, soup, fruit etc... One out of the eight meats I tried was dry and two of eight I got a 'bad cut' (fat and grizzle). I enjoyed all, however with the sausage being my favorite overall.  Sangria from the bar was delicious, although not very potent (if you are looking for such things). Service was attentive, although the hostess was not very friendly and I noticed other diners having issues with certain servers. Once the meats started coming, they continued at a good pace, with a emphasis on the chicken (often times paired with other meats such as bacon or sausage).  Over all I was dining with a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> discount, and I was pleased.

    "text": "Ate at Pampas this past weekend.  Had a decent experience, but not great.  We stay at the Marriott Resort across the street and had walked by this restaurant many times in the past, but decided to give it a try this trip.  So, we also had the \"dreaded\" coupon that other reviewers had mentioned previously.  At face value, it's a pretty good deal - lunch for $21 per person, all you can eat.  The problem, as mentioned by other posters, are the additional \"fees\" they add on as part of the coupon deal.  First off, water is poured before even asking, which is normally normal, but not in this case.  Every person is charged a $1 water filter (yes filter) fee.  Obviously, a minimal charge, but a charge nonetheless.  Second, everyone had to order a drink as part of the discounted lunch.  We decided to get two pitchers, which counted, as well.  We got a pitcher of an IPA and a pitcher of sangria - shame on us for not checking the price.  $35 for one, $36 for the other - ridiculous.  I was thinking maybe $20-25, but this was over the top.  Plus, the sangria pitcher was at least half full of ice and really not very good.  On to the food.  We really liked the salad bar and the choices there.  My daughter and I really loved the sauteed mushrooms.  But really, plenty of choices for everyone.  On the meats, the sirloin and pork loin were our favorites, really tasty, tender, and well cooked.  The bacon wrapped chicken and grilled pineapple were both pretty good too.  The ham was too salty for me, and the tri-tip and chicken legs were over cooked and dried out.  Overall, we were very happy with the meal.  Definitely come with a big appetite, because it's all about eating quantity here!  The service was fine.  Our server was mostly attentive, although we had to ask for water refills several times.  Again, the biggest negative was the cost of drinks.  If it wasn't for that, I would say four stars.",

As for the available sides....the mushroom risotto was very very tasty.  I liked the cheese bread as well.  There was a whole bunch of salad options, but hey, I'm at a churrascaria... I was in \"meat\" mode.  I bypassed the greenery that day.  I know, shame on me.  I did get a sampling of their asian noodle salad, which I liked.  It was about $50 for all you can eat meat/seafood.

At the end, the waiter brought us our check (we waited longer it felt for the check then it did for us to eat our meal) he explained with the voucher how mich our meal wouldve been and how much it was (free +  our upgrade) and how much we should tip based off howuch the check would have been. Ok great. We had our xash together as we had waited awhile to pay. Instead of letting him walk away, my boyfriend put the cash into the check thing and the waiter opened it up, counted our money and explained we did not tip enough based off his calculations. Excuse me, but we did leave a decent tip and no maybe wasnt based off a 100 check but, we didnt come there expecting to pay or tip on that. We were completely embarrassed as the waiter got loud in counting our money amd telling us it wasnt enough.. the tables next to us could hear and were staring. Forst of all, we were there for 20/30 minutes. Our waiter brought us water and we had a go with the meat one time. I didnt feel good leaving there and in all honesty if we couldve stiffed his ass, we wouldve. That is NOT how you treat a customer no matter how much their bill was. Shame on you guys! If you dont like the vouchers than i suggest you opt out of being apart of it. And his snooty ass can finally make better tips! How dare he!!! My boyfriend ended up tipping beyond even the pro rated calculations against my idea of leaving him even less for the sheer embarrassment he brought to us during dinner on our vacation. So i hope you spent it well!!",

    "text": "Last year, we were supposed to have our wedding dinner here. Our wedding chapel screwed things up and forgot to set the reservations w/ the restaurant, so we weren't able to get the private room. We figured for the price they were charging, it wasn't worth the money without the privacy, so we ended up going elsewhere. On our 2nd trip back to Vegas, we knew we had to try it and see what could have been.  This was my first Brazilian steakhouse, so I don't have anything else to compare it to. I notice a lot of reviews state that this isn't as good as ___insert another Brazilian steakhouse here___. My review will probably be on the higher side as a result.  The ambiance is beautiful. I really liked how it felt somewhat romantic, but I think it would have been a good spot even for a bunch of friends or family. The waiter boasted of the salad bar but I didn't think that they had a lot of great choices. It was a bit of a let down. The soups were soo good though, as was some of the cold pasta salads, so there was enough for me to eat. (Don't miss out on the cheesy bread either! It was my favorite non-meat item.)  The meats- -Everything bacon wrapped was delicious, but then again what isn't? -Sirloin. We had them keep bringing it back. So moist, perfectly seasoned and the definition of a good piece of meat. -Grilled pineapple. Not really a meat but it was brought out in the same fashion. Loved it! Wish that they served it with the ham though. By the time the ham was brought out, the pineapple guy was nowhere in sight.  All in all, the deliciousness of the meat selection made up for the somewhat lacking salad bar. Now that I've experienced the Brazilian phenomenon, I'm hooked. Can't wait to try another one!",

It was seasoned perfectly and it was just so amazing. My only problem was that the room I was in with my classmates was really dark and I couldnt even see my food. I had to use my phone to even see what was happening and I already have poor eyesight to begin with. The portions of the food varied from server to server as well for person to person. I ended up getting a massive piece of beef on one occasion, while my friend ended up getting something smaller than me. But other than that, the food was fantastic, the servers were all really friendly and it was just a nice place to go to.   I would go again if I had the chance.",

    "text": "Horrible from start to finish. Went on a Groupon deal, and still would never go again nor recommend it to anyone. There are a billion places to eat in LV with better service and better food for the price. This place just stank all around. To start, the main dining room was completely empty at 1PM on a Friday, and yet I was told that there would be a 15-minute wait to be seated. ?  So, I opted to sit at the bar, as the initially friendly bartender told me that the Rozidio servers still made rounds through that area. Well, while that was True, they didn't come by very often at all, had to be flagged down, and the bartender acted horribly swamped, even though there were so few occupied tables. My water was never refilled either, and it took FOREVER to get drinks in the first place. So, the Groupon itself included a cocktail, dessert, and the \"surf and turf\" rodizio. When the seafood never came out, I noticed that another group at the bar had seafood. When I asked the bartender, he mentioned that I had to order that from the kitchen. It would have been nice to know that BEFORE I sat for over an hour for lunch, especially since he was well aware that I was using a Groupon for that particular meal choice. :(  I actually forewent the remainder of my meal, as the meat and sides were all mediocre at best, and the service was a complete wash.   Avoid this place, even for free.",

All the meats were top notch. the tri-tip and the bacon wrapped chicken were the stand outs but every other selection was amazing.  We also had what I will say was the best grilled pineapple I've ever had -NICE  We didn't have very much from the salad bar (We were there for the Meats) but the things we did try were excellent.

It appeared to be open seating as no one said anything to us as we walked in.  No welcome, no one offering to help us find a seat even though they had the restaurant nearly pitch black for the dj lighting affects.  We had chosen to sit at a table near the dance area.  The girl that finally came to take a drink order after about 20 minutes would not even speak English, she kept trying to talk to is in Spanish... Not sure if that was because my fiance is latin, but it was a little frustrating because the music was very loud, and hard to hear her.  Then she didn't even bring my fiance what he had asked for :(!!! We got up to dance a little and the manager began to give our table away, when we let him know that we were sitting there he very rudely informed us that those tables were for bottle service only.  So we moved... Even our drinks because the waitress didn't inform us of that.    The dj however was pretty good.  The only thing we didn't like was that he played several of the same genre of song in a row.  But the salsa songs, merengue songs, and bachata he played were great!  Great music.  That dj should consider playing at a place with a legitimate dance floor and better service.    The bit of dancing was fun, and others seemed to be having a wonderful time.  And the location within the miracle mile shops was great... That mall has a great atmosphere and nice selections.",

Another 10 minutes  for a glass of wine. I ordered the Vegetarian Rodizio which took over 15 minutes. In the meantime I tried the salad bar which was fairly good. The Rodizio was a skewer of vegetables For $30 there were a couple of pieces of onions, three pieces of squash, a tiny mushroom, a piece of green pepper and half a tomato. . The vegetables were pretty bland and tasteless. They asked if I wanted another one, but I didn't want to wait another 15 to 20 minutes.  The meat equivalent was $40 and they brought more meet to the table. I guess you can expect to get ripped off in Vegas.",

We came here on a Saturday afternoon at lunch and the restaurant was not crowded at all. We were greeted warmly and taken to our table. Our server approached us quickly for our drink orders and gave us a rundown of the layout of the restaurant and all their offerings. We quickly headed to the salad bar while our waiter went to get our drinks. The salad offerings were slim. There weren't a lot of fresh veggies, but I enjoyed the mashed potatoes and kale, although it lacked a little flavor.   On to the meat. The servers came out regularly and our server made sure that all the meats we wanted made their way out of the kitchen to us. I enjoyed that personal touch quite a bit. The meats were pretty good. My favorites were the pork, sausage and my fella really enjoyed the sirloin. I found it to be quite good as well. There wasn't as much selection as other Brazillian steakhouses we've been to, but the food was pretty good and we had an excellent meal.   I would have given this place 3 stars for food, but I rounded up based on the great service we received. Our server was friendly and incredibly attentive.

    "text": "While we were in Vegas, we received a coupon for lunch at Pampas.  I was especially excited because I had been telling my husband how much I loved Brazilian BBQs.    The restaurant is located in that new miracle mile mall thing, kind of down a short hallway from the main circle.  Upon walking up to the entrance, there were two ladies standing in front.  One lady welcome us and the other asked if we were there because we had a coupon.  It was a little odd, but ok.  We told her that we did have a lunch coupon and she explained that the coupon was only good for a sandwich, but we could do an upgrade for $20 to have the actual Brazilian BBQ.  We opted for that.    Once we were seated, a woman came to our table with a fancy glass bottle and poured water into a couple of glasses and asked if we wanted something else to drink.  We both ordered iced tea and the Brazilian BBQ meal, which included the buffet area in the back of hot and cold dishes.  They were ok, but nothing to write home about.  We noticed that there was quite a bit of time between \"meat\" guys coming around.  It felt like of like they were hoping you would only sample a couple things and leave.  I could totally be wrong, but that is how it felt.   About half way through our meal, a lady with a camera approached us and asked if we wanted to have a complimentary photo postcard.  We agreed.  A few minutes later she brought us a print-out of our photo on basic photo paper and began showing us photos of us in little paper frames she was selling for $20.  We kept saying no thank you until she said she would give them both to us for $10.  It was pretty annoying to be propositioned during our meal, but I guess everyone has to have a hustle.    Another annoyance was the fact that they were vacuuming the room with a loud vacuum while we were trying to enjoy our meal.  At the end of our meal, the bill came and they had charged us for water!  We didn't ask for water, the girl poured it without even asking if we wanted it...and we were charged for it.  My husband was very upset, not really about the $1 added to our bill, but the fact that they would sneak that into our meal. He spoke to who we think was the manager about the annoyances, but he was kind of rude about it and mentioned that we used a coupon.  What does that have to do with anything?!  The meats were fantastic, but will never return!",

The best things were the cheese bread and fruit. I also upgraded to the surf and turf for an extra $10 and had to send it back. The seafood was soo bland. I feel like Red Lobster could of produced better seafood than that (mussels, fish, shrimp, and tuna). I am giving three stars because of the great staff and friendly waiter!! Not a place you have to go to when u visit but if you get free vouchers give it a try.",

It is more than double the next closest price. I would NEVER come here if it weren't for a coupon we found. Even then it was more expensive than Tucanos. The coupon was also misleading. So for price I give it a 1.  The meat wasn't nearly as good as the three above mentioned places. It was dry and mostly flavorless. Not the worst I've had but far from the best. The salad bar was ho-hum and messy.  The soda was watery. For food quality I give it a 2.  The staff were friendly enough even though a meat server spilled water all over my wife. We got an apology but that was it. They were quick to bring food and refills. For the staff I will give a 3.  So 6/15 which averages to 2/5. I will never return unless they offer to pay me to eat here.",

We went for a meat rodigio and a veggie rodigio as suggested by the server. We had a coupon which gave us a free wine provided we ordered two Rodizio. The service was pathetic. We did not get there wine till most of our meal was done. We did not get any food from the vegetarian Rodizio till we were done. We spoke with the manager who informed us that no changes could be made to our bill as we used a coupon. I do not think the coupon included such lack of service.  Additionally the food itself was not of great quality. The meats were dry and too salty. And the bad service only made this experience worse.I would avoid this place in the future",

Favorites were the bacon-wrapped turkey, sirloin, pork tenderloin, and grilled pineapple (okay, that is not a meat but it was delicious).  Every skewer of meat had a wonderful caramelization on the outside and flavorful juiciness inside.  Yea!

We also purchased the 1/2 off tickets.  Ordered a pitcher of sangria which we were told was $9.  I guess the lesson here is \"If it sounds too good to be True, it probably is!\".  We confirmed the price with our waitress because we thought it was much too cheap for a place that charges an arm and a leg and a thigh for everything else.   In that case, get the party rollin!  It was my birthday so we easily polished off two pitchers of sangria during our meal.  The bill came and it was over $200 for two people! wth? After our meal at about 11:30pm, we spent over an hour with the manager who refused to refund us for the \"$9 sangria\".  The waitress even admitted her fault to the manager, but ol' cheap ass wouldn't budge.  Talk about a BUZZ KILL!   The next morning I had to call down there again and harass the guy to give us our well deserved credit.  He offered to \"split\" the bill with me.  HELL NO! It was their fault for misrepresenting the price, I was not about to split it. Especially on my birthday!  you cheap bastard.   After a 45 minute phone call and some choice words, he agreed to refund me the amount minus $18 (the price they claimed it was per pitcher).    The food - was a little better than average, but nothing to \"wow\" about.  the experience was more worth the money then the food.  I love how its like a sit down buffet rotating in front of your face!    Anyways, I would advise to try a different place than this.    P.S. I got the papaya mousse for dessert (I think that's what it was).  It looks great, but it was really DISCUSTING!",

They said they were expecting a large party, which did eventually show up.  We helped ourself to the buffet - the food was typical.  Nothing to brag about.  I had to get my own silverware from another table.  We had finished our salads and waited 10-15 minutes before the first meat skewer was brought to our table.  This would have been acceptable if they were slammed...but they weren't.  Our waiter even came by to ask \"how is everything so far\"?  \"Well, my coke tastes great, but we're hungry.  Can we get some food\"!  (I actually said something nicer).  They only put one \"meat tray and tongs\" on our table, even though we both ordered the rodizio.  So...each time they came out with meat, we had to explain to them that we had BOTH ordered the rodizio.  I guess the number of meat tongs = number of people who ordered the rodizio?

It was explained to us that we could use the coupon along with the 2 for 1 deal. So that is what we ordered. After dinner the bill comes and not only were we charged for the 2 for 1 deal but the bill included a host of other charges (a second 2 for 1 charge amongst other things) that brought the total to nearly $150. The worst part, the $50 coupon we'd given them they'd only applied $37.50 of it.  After fifteen minutes of arguing the legitimacy of the bill and with their logic that somehow $37.50 equals $50 I just paid the bill and left out of frustration.

The meat rodizio was less than mediocre.  They offered ham, sausage, chicken and beef.   The service is HORRIBLE!  When we arrived the place had only a few customers and 90% of the restaurant was empty... and we still were made to wait about 10 minutes to get seated.  They were only seating people facing the mall and they couldn't get any of their lazy waiters to clear any of the dirty tables to get us seated.  So they reluctantly cleared a table and got us seated.  When the waiter came to our table he had an attitude.  He seemed angry that we didn't want to BUY a bottle of Perrier or other bottled water.  We just wanted some water because we had just walked a long way.  I asked him if we could just have the \"regular\" water and he replied pretentiously, \"TAP water, yes we have that.\"   LOL!  This, coming from a twenty something year old kid who can barely scrape enough dough together to buy gas!  Anyway, it all went downhill from there.  No one was receiving any level of service, no one could get refills on their \"paid\" drinks either, and every diner had 5 or 6 plates on the table because the staff apparently doesn't clear them out.  Don't waste a dime here!",

    "text": "WOW!  This is my first time eating at a Brazilian restaurant.  The experience was amazing and the Father's Day gift certificate ($40 off through the month of June) was the icing on the cake. Pamas Churrascaria is tucked into the south end of the Planet Hollywood shops.  If you go in the correct door, it is immediately on the left - otherwise you get to wander through the maze of 170 shops looking for it. We had reservations (highly recommended) and still waited for about 10 minutes to get a table (not too bad).  The host was very good but spoke a little too fast for this novice to catch everything he was saying. One of the managers (Michele R.) came by while we were waiting on our drinks and talked with us about Pampas and what we could expect.  From my questions, she offered us a tour of the kitchen and then took our picture in front of the grill.  This was a very nice touch and certainly helped me to understand what to expect from the overall experience.  She also made herself available to us throughout the night - checking back to make sure everything was just right for us. Michelle (our server) is from Chicago and has the great Chicago accent.  She is friendly, knowledgeable and fun to talk with.  Service could have been a little faster for my taste but at 7:15 on a Saturday evening with a wedding party on board, it gets a little bit crazy around there. The food is amazing - 10 different kinds of meats, all freshly carved and served at your table.  The all-you-can-eat seafood was freshly prepared and very good but I was already getting full from the all-you-can-eat meat and salad and side bar by the time it arrived. The desert tray looked fantastic but since I cannot have sugar, I asked about some strawberries.  Michele R. came to my rescue (again).  The rest of my table enjoyed the chocolate mousse. This place is fantastic.  I love it.  If you are going to a show after dinner, allow yourself 2 to 2/12 hours for dinner and transportation to the show.",

His communication with other wait staff made the meal exquisite!   Antonio, Jesus and Poncho were the men providing the meat. Eric asked what specifically we wanted and he communicated to each of them exactly what we wanted, filet, medium rare no bacon...exact perfection!  Having a brief conversation with Shari, the Asst Mgr, was pleasant. She assured us that the host staff will be notified and trained to be friendlier.   We were so rudely welcomed, (the word welcomed is not best used here), that we we both felt apologetic for asking any questions.   The value was great 4*. The wait staff excellent 5*. The food quality great 4*. That initial contact 1* (and that's generous). Overall 3* since it spoiled the beginning and first half of the evening.",

I have no complaints at all with the salad bar.   However!  I have never seen so much sad, overcooked meat in my life! Everything brought around was at least medium-well. We asked a few times for medium-rare. One cut brought to us was spot on, but the last serving of picanha was rare. Like super rare. Still mooing at me rare. I ate half and couldn't eat the rest just because the texture grossed me out.   I was excited that they had Guarana...it's been a while since I've had it. They also had a gal walking around taking photos of the guests. You get an itsy bitsy photo of your party with the option to buy a regular sized version. That was nice and I did end up buying the photo.",

The salmon, shrimp, scallops, sausage, and chicken wrapped in bacon were my favorites  I didn't like the roast beef- it was dry, the sirloin was tough.

I decided to take my boyfriend to this restaurant, and I had made a reservation at 7:30pm, we got there at 7:40pm and didn't sit down until 8:45pm, it is okay we know it is Valentine's day and they are busy, everything is cool at first and food was good for the price, however we finish our dinner and my boyfriend went to bathroom and saw a young thin Latino worker and finish use number 2  and just rush out and didn't wash his hands. THAT IS SO GROSS, I hope we don't get sick or got e.coli, at that point we both really gross out when he came back and tell me what he saw, we  wanted to leave right away and never come back, because that was really a turn off. We didnt even want to finish our dessert, Our Valentine was ruined. We talked to manager Monica about the issues, she offer us 50% off to our bill, I just hope that they will have a good stuff training and make sure everyone work there will wash their hands after they use bathroom and before they going back to work!!",

We went with the Meat ridizio for 2 for our dinner. That's unlimited servings of different types of meats. When I saw unlimited... They had me sold. It also comes with a salad and side bar to add to your meal as you eat with a good amount of choices, but once they start coming around with the meats, you'll forget the side bar exist. My two favorite meats they serve are the sirloin and sausage. All of them were good though, ever the lamb which I don't even eat. They will make your plate full, so make sure you come with an empty stomach. The sangria is also a good choice to have as a drink.   The service was excellent. Our waiter stayed on top of everything and the servers of the meat will make sure to find you immediately when you're wanting more.   I was very impressed. I give 5 stars all across the board. You'll be plenty full and satisfied when leaving here. Pampas is definitely in the rotation to make a visit to every time I make a trip to Las Vegas.",

We made reservations that needed to be changed a few times (amount of people changed), and we were accommodated without any issues.    We arrived at 645 pm with a party of 10 (5 adults and 5 kids).  We were sat immediately and was greeted by our server.  He took our drink orders and asked us to make our way to the salad bar when we were ready.  I was pleasantly surprised with the selection, but declined even one bite from the salad bar because I wanted to get my fill of some MEAT!!  As the night progressed pork, lamb, beef, and more pork, lamb, and beef, AND MORE pork, lamb, and beef - oh yah- chicken too (was pretty flavorful).    A lot of food that tasted great.

They never rushed us and were good about explaining everything to me and answering questions.   The salad bar was pretty good! I wanted to fill up on all the fresh fruits and veggies! They had some stuff I've never had but tried and was delicious. I don't remember the names so check the pics!   The drinks were great! I had the pampas specialty cocktail and my friend got the pina colada one and we both really enjoyed our drinks. Good amount of alcohol and great flavor. My boyfriend's Coke was refilled consistently. Lol he's such a goodie goody.   The seafood was cool. I only had the salmon but it had some kind of glaze that was amazing!  I wish I could make salmon like that!   The meats were good. Mind you, I'm not usually a meat person, so it was a chore for me to eat all the meats haha I asked for thin slices every time they came around and managed to try everything at least once. I wasn't a fan of the bacon wrapped chicken. I know, WHAT?! I love bacon everything, but just wasn't feeling this. The chicken was dry and had no flavor. I run into the same problem wrapping bacon because you want to make sure the bacon is cooked and in the process, dry out everything else, so I'm not going to ding them stars for it. The grilled pineapple was good. But then again, I love pineapple.   Dessert was good. We got the flan and the chocolate mousse. We didn't finish because we were stuffed! And this is why I always go dessert first! *stops writing, puts down phone, shakes head at boyfriend for stopping smart girlfriend, picks up phone*  All in all, an excellent meal and one I'm likely to repeat! (Note to self: wear pants with elastic waistband) Thanks Ray and Ashley for a great first experience at a Brazilian steakhouse!",

It was a variety of 14 meats on the skewer ranging from rib eye, smoked ham, dry tip ,steak, bacon wrapped around chicken ,chorizo sausage and the list goes on. You also get to have sliced grilled pineapple. The waited Sammie was amazing very down to earth and friendly and one of the meat servers was great to l. Nice flow of conversation. Meat was amazing seasoning was on point. They also have an unlimited salad bar food for side dishes and they have desert but we had no more space. Downside is that there is a service charge per person for water which is $1.",

Also paid the extra for bottomless mimosas for 1 hour. Buffet line was typical buffet food nothing special. The carving guys take their very sweet time coming around. At first they came fast they give you one slice of steak and take off to never be seen again. I asked if we could get them to come back and was told they have to make their rounds. That's fine. But there were only 4 other tables with people. What rounds are they making. The chicken guy came around but we only seen steak and ham guy one time. It seemed like they make one trip and done.  The bottom less drinks are also not refilled. Again hardly anyone there and we waited forever to get drinks. Once they came I ask does our hour start now and was told no it starts when you sit down. O. Ok then it's now 45 minutes of bottomless drinks. Drinks only refilled twice. Was told by a actual employee there \"they only want you have three\". Wow really. Ok then. All and all with the coupon you get at the hotel or mall it's not terrible for the price. But they have some improvements to make to met Vegas expectations. Also when paying server said \"if you could leave a tip in cash that would be best\". Mmmm. Maybe if my bottomless drink didn't stay empty we would be more willing. We did tip of course but just thought that was a tad ballsy.",

This included all you can eat salad bar and such which had soup, salads, veggies.  Service: was very slow. Anytime we had to request for an item we had to ask 2-3 times . Also at times the request we put in, the item didn't come. The servers , I feel bad for, because you can see that they're busy but their service felt rushed. The check also took a long time to receive.   The food: The meat servers also did not come around often. The meat was dry. There was nothing I wanted second servings of.   Luckily we ate here and didn't have to pay for the tab. We came here because my friend had received a gift card.   I'd say I'm very fair when it comes to grading/rating. 5= exceed expectations/excellent. 4= Pretty good. I'd come back.  3= Average. Nothing special, nor distinguishable, run of the mill.  2= less than average. Satisfactory.  1= Complete joke. I'd probably find better food at a gas station.",

The place was almost completely empty yet the wait was about 15 minutes. The servers took quite a while to get around to us and the drinks (virgin \"strawberry daiquiri\") were terrible! Meat was extremely undercooked or over cooked the \"seafood feast\" consists of all COLD shrimp I think it was tilapia and mussels....NO THANK YOU the sides were just sad....garlic mashed potatoes that for sure needed to replaced I think rice and the rest cold appetizers. The place is quite lovely on the inside. Beautiful decor I just wish they would add that same amount dedication to the food/service as they do to keeping the place nice.",

It's super expensive ($75 a person with out a food voucher)for what you get. Cool idea but it just doesn't taste good and it has a \"smell\" inside. Off putting as I thought it smelled like bad meat. We also had a coupon for all you can eat grilled shrimp skewers and they don't even have grilled shrimp skewers...  We also had all you can drink wine coupons for one hour. They were very prompt on that which got us tipsy and made us forget how much money we just spent on a awful dinner.  We came out for our last night, nice dinner and was very disappointed. Won't be recommending or coming back.",

For $25 it's crazy good. The meats are really good. Better than other Brazilian BBQ places I've been in San Jose. Salad bar is so-so but who goes here for salad anyway.  Without the discount it's a four star.  And by the way that discount card is good at like 69 other places around the strip.",

When you sir down they give you water with out asking and then when I got the bill it says water 1.00 per person.   How can you charge and not tell the customer.  I won't be coming back here again.",

    "text": "Update on review:  I was re-invited to Pampas after addressing some concerns from a previous experience.  I'm glad I was re-invited.  This is a favorite for my son and it has moved back up on my list as well.    First, my son and I usually opt for the Travelzoo voucher which includes all meats along with a pitcher of Sangria.  We made reservations and a table was ready for us immediately upon arrival.  The hostess, as usual, was very polite and friendly.    Upon being seated, our waiter Alex greeted us and advised that he would return for our drink order.  It is nice when your server acknowledges your presence and notices you that he will return promptly.  That he did.  We ordered the white sangria pitcher along with two Brazilian Limeades.  We patron two other Brazilian Steakhouses and Pampas has the best limeades of them all.    Our table was soon visited by Gustavo - with Pampas.  Gustavo was very accommodating and it was nice to see part of Pampas management team take time to greet patrons at their table.  This style reinforces good customer service and exceptional attention to service.    The salad bar had a variety of selections to ensure you keep healthy!  Good assortment of vegetables, pasta, and other delicacies that compliment the meat selections.    Here is the best part:  The meats/cuts: From experiencing the other two main Brazilian Steakhouses in Vegas - Pampas cuts are not saturated with sodium.  That is a major turn off from other establishments - too much sodium.  Not at Pampas.  The cuts at Pampas seem to have just the right amount so as to not inflame the gums!  The gentlemen were at our table offering their selection and - you can simply request a particular cut of preference and they will bring it right over.  Their lamb is great too!    Overall, the experience was exceptional and made me forget the past experience.  Previously, the first few times we patroned Pampas - the service was good.  So the poor experience appears to be an exception.  I'm just glad Pampas re-invited us and regained our patronage.  My son was definitely happy with our experience.    Pampas staff and management - Thank you!   Recommendation: Absolutely.  Definitely get yourself the white sangria pitcher.  It complements the meal with perfection.",

We were seated at a table and told a waitress would be with us soon. 20minutes go by and we were not helped. We had a few waitresses go bye and no one even showed us any interest. Finally, someone walking around with a meat skewer asked if we wanted to try what he was serving I told him we had not even received any water and he got the owner/manager on it right away. Once the manager came over to start helping us everyone was surrounding our table! The manager was an incredible and sweet man. But it should not have taken him to come over for others to notice us. Because I enjoy the food and the hot buffet I will return and even more for the manager making us feel more at home after the incident. I do hope you have a better experience",

The garlic potatoes were absolutely disgusting. The waitress was rude and short with no personality.  When our meal came the waitress waited a good ten minutes before asking how our horribly prepared food was. My girlfriend replied, it would be better if I had something else, the waitress replied ok then turns and went to another table. I sought after the manager, I asked her what she would do if it was her. She replied I would just walk away. After that I had my food voucher returned and we will never darken the doorstep to inconvenience them to my little money that was called \"free\" by the manager even though I bought it in a show bundled. \"Free\" is not paying a premium for a show and dinner with crap service.

I have eaten at a number of Brazilian steakhouses, and this place is well below the bottom of that list. Literally ever cut of meat that very slowly made its way to our table was very over-salted and so tough and fatty that it was nearly impossible to chew. You can ask for medium or mid rare but you will only end up with well done or very well done. For an extra fee you can add the \"unlimited seafood\" which consists of poorly prepared and obviously frozen shrimp, mussels and fish. I would honestly choose Golden Corral over this place and save $50 a plate in doing so. Don't make the same mistake my wife and I made.",

Lucky for us, we got the groupon for the rodizio surf and turf lunch for two, so we didn't feel like we were robbed by the restaurant.  When we arrived, we let the host know that we have a reservation.  She then asked us to have a seat.  Waited for about 10 mins before we were seated.  Our waitress didn't come by often.  She was there to take our drink order, and returned to hand us our bill.  The staff with the meat do come by very often and for the surf, we each got a piece of scallop, shark, salmon, and shrimp.  The shark tasted...odd.  I am not a fan.  Our favorite item is the cheese bread pao de queijo.  The third time I came back to get another 4 pieces, there was none left.  I asked one of the kitchen staff to bring out more since the basket is empty and 5 minutes later, he gave me a plate of fresh hot pao de queijo...He is the awesome-est person there.  One star for the pao de queijo. One star for the awesome staff.  Pampas got nothing on Fogo.",

First they tried to leave of our discount voucher we had 2 and they only did one but when the bill was dropped the waiter said \" I took off both of your discounts\" NEVER buy a small pitcher of mojoito or sangria unless you want to pay $50 for well rum and a pitcher of ice. The waiter said it was on \"special\" which there was no special. so we didn't ask the price the bill was $131 for 2 people and we had $42 dollars of discounts no desert or appetizers. The service was below average. The waiter in training spilled the mojoito while pouring it and did not go get us more. Please people do not go here avoid at all costs very crappy service and a total rip off. Check your bill very closely!!! The waiter actually thought I was going to leave a $32 tip lol yeah right if you didn't rip us off on the mojoito pitcher",

The benefit of this place is, if you're from out of town, this location is in the Miracle Mile Mall.  They also have plenty of Groupon specials regularly, so you can save money eating here.  It does get crowded, so make reservations.  In terms of food quality, I definitely have better options out there, and despite the great service, the salad bar and meat options are just okay.  Still, if you're stretching your vacation dollars and want this experience, Pampas is a good choice.",

As far as food, meats were not flavored right, some were very uncooked that you could barely eat. The salad bar was fair but the utensils were unsanitary. We tried the fruits instead of ordering the deserts and let me tell you, those watermelons were disgusting! Very soggy and just wasnt right. For the bill we paid for $85, i wouldve expected more.

On the surf side the mussels and shrimp were great but the salmon and other fish were not good. The side buffet was nice but nothing really stood out there. Our server was Elias and he did an excellent job with his drink recommendations and helping us with how the service worked. Service did get pretty slow towards the end of our visit as we came in at the tail end of dinner.

I have to give special thanks to him to replying back to my message and wanting to make things right. That shows how much he cares about customer service.         Let me start off by saying how amazing Amber was as our waitress!  She was on point with explaining everything from the selection of meats and seafood.   As she waited many tables she never looked frustrated or tired always had a smile. Food was great. Salad bar was divine. I had the surf and turf. Mussels were yummy. Salmon  with a spicy honey glaze was melting in my mouth. Loved the side sauce. The lunch special for drinks was a good deal. $10 dollars for all you can drink on their selected list. The dessert menu looked so yummy but we were full. But Amber remembered I said it was my husband's 40th birthday and brought us a tiramusa cake. Yummy! Overall I would come back. Ambiance was nice. Not too loud just perfect enough for each other to have a conversation!  Thanks Bill and Amber for an excellent service.",

I LOVE meat that goes moo when you cut in but was also sitting with people who enjoy a well done cut of beef. Had a huge variety of meat come by with (again) great food cutters/servers and the right amount of variation to satisfy everyone. Definitely try the grilled pineapple, as well as the filet mignon and the house special sirloin. All. The. Noms.",

Half off is still $25/pp. The hostess was absolutely fantastic in seating us and our son loved her. We have been to many Churrascarias in the past and this one was on the lower end even though it's one of the most expensive. The salad bar was just ok. The frejuada and cheese rolls were really good which is nice because they are my favorite at Brazilian salad bars but everything else left me wanting more and better. The meat tasted really good but it came around so slow and they didn't offer chicken hearts. I've never been to one of these that didn't have chicken hearts. The one thing that was really annoying is they opened up a large bottle of water and served that when asking for water. You can't even offer free water. Yes, this is a nice restaurant, but that nice to only offer bottled water.  So, to bottle up my thoughts. Only go if you get a dining card that discounts the dinner greatly.  If not don't even consider going here :) oh, and give the hostess with the short hair a big raise!!!",

    "text": "The review is NOT a reflection of the food or the service, it's the presentation of the Buy One Get One deal, which is shameful.  You walk into a dark alley, and a well dressed, clean shaven, nice looking man, his face partly obscured by the poor lighting approaches.  You take a deep breath, and start taking larger and quicker steps.  He leans over, and whispers in your ear: \"how about a great Brazilian dinner at half price, my friend?\".  You make your best uninterested gesture, but your face screams: \"tell me more\".  So he does.  $34.99 includes all you can eat grilled Brazilian meats, perhaps twenty kinds of them.  That's 50% off!  You're hungry, it's hot, you almost surrender.  But the nice man goes on: \"free access to the buffet, which has forty kinds of side dishes, fruits and vegetables, and even more meat\".  \"One minute\" you say, and turn to consult with the family.  Where's the family?  They're gone.  Instead I see three full size lions, their teeth sharp, their tongues hanging out, drooling all over the place.  \"Yes\", I say to the nice man.  \"Yes!!!\".  We go in, and we sit down, and our waitress, sorry, our server, comes by for introductions and instructions.  \"In order to use your half price deal, you must order an alcoholic drink from the drink menu\", she opens.  \"Wait\", I say, \"the nice man never mentioned that\".  The server says calmly: \"nonetheless, this is the deal\".  We pretend to consider, but everyone knows there is no way back now.  We surrender.  We order a beer, a Lemon Drop, and whatever for the kids who aren't allowed alcohol anyway.  Then we visit the buffet, and bring the loot to the table.  Then a marching band of meat carrying young men walk by us, at the rate of one per minute with the most delicious meats we had in a very long time.  Garlic Sirloin, coated chicken, lamb, Filet Mignon, Sausage, and many more mouthwatering meats are dropped into our plates and devoured in no time.  Wow, it's really amazing.  The excellent meats and the alcohol, make us forget the nice man in the dark alley.  We almost forgive him.  Until we see the check.  The check puts you in a very compromising position.  It actually registers the amount without the discount (we would never set foot in this restaurant without the discount), and with the discount, but with the drinks that we were forced to order, and then makes a very silly proposition: you can choose a tip amount of 30% on the amount before discount, or 30% of the amount after discount.  At this point, despite the excellent meal and the alcohol, we realize: we've been cleverly lured into a very flavorful trap, and the only way out is to pay the ransom and move on.  So here's my review.  If you want a great meal, at a good restaurant, on the strip in the heart of Las Vegas, and you are prepared to pay about $60.00 per person, go for it.  Dinner was quite good indeed.  But if you think that a promise of a man in the alley will get you a great dinner at half price, you got another thing coming my friend.  In other words, when visiting Pampas of Las Vegas, expect what you'd expect in the original Pampas: lowlands, filled with shifting sands, hungry predators, traps, and really good meat!",

I love the variety of food you get to try with the surf and turf plus the little buffet area in the back (I can never get enough of the cheese bread). I always end up over eating because of how great the food is. Well done :)",

Shrimp came with the meal and we looked forward to these however they were not deveined and for the menu pricing Ana scale you'd think this would have occurred.  The servers came by far more often than our waiter (Juan) didn't take time to answer questions we asked....felt like his only job was to seat us and take payment.

Shrimp over cooked fish was rubbery also! Serve was ok .. They charge 2.00 per person water conservation fee .. Would recommend everyone avoiding this place it's over priced and not worth it!",

The waiter proceeded to bring out a rare sirloin. Not even cooked in the slightest. What's crazy is the waiter never returned to ask how our food was only when it was time for the check lol. I was pretty bummed it all looked tasty but the waiter ruined the meal.",

    "text": "I am so disappointed with this place, if I.l could give it a half star I would!!! Brazilian food is suppose to be fun and exiting. Pampas is dull, overrated and provides less than satisfying food. Not photo worthy at all!   We did have a voucher from our resort to check it out. I had a reservation and was able to get a table quickly, however it was on the \"patio\". The patio consisted of tables on the outside of the building, it's an indoor building so people are just standing around. We opted to sit at the bar top in hopes to get faster service and less stares from people walking by.   We waited 20 minutes before even seeing any meat come around. Once it started the first round was good. Then it went down hill from there. I like a medium rare steak, but when the entire steak/meat has nothing but red blood spilling from it... that's a good indication it's not cooked. Honestly feel like this place is just a major tourist attraction that resorts get tons of coupons for and give out. This is their main business and they aren't looking to impress you.   Don't be fooled by the upscale pricing, the \"unlimited\" hot and cold car and the fun atmosphere video provided online. The pricing is a rip off considering you walk away hungry. The unlimited hot and cold bar had veggie salads that appeared to be sitting out for hours, you could see the kitchen wide open from the bar and the only American food besides salad was mashed potatoes.",

It took us 15 minutes to be seated when there were plenty of open tables on the floor. Once we were seated we got up to get our salads and then waited at our table for the meats. We waited....waited....waited some more... and finally we asked someone if we could get some meat?? They brought over one meat and we ate. Then we waited...waited some more... FINALLY a second meat came out. It was about 15-20 minutes before we got offered a 3rd meat. There were 6-8 meats we were supposed to get and the same people kept coming around with the same meats. One guy gave one of us meat, ran out of it, and left without coming back with more for the rest of us. We finally were over waiting for it and decided to leave. We asked the server for the check and he said he'd get it to me. Mind you we already have him our coupon but we wanted to be nice and leave a tip. He NEVER   Came back! We were so agitated we got up and left. If it weren't for the coupon and I paid full price I 100% would have asked for my money back or not paid it was ridiculous service and a huge waste of time.",

Coupon listed an entree deal that is not even listed on their menu.  On the coupon it says the meat dinner is usually $64 but with coupon is $32 When you get there, they pretend to be seeing the coupon for the first time. I paid attention to patrons after me with the same coupon and my same waitor each time looked at it, \"let me see.... oh yes this is a special\", they hand out the coupon right outside the place a few feet away. Everyone is bringing in the same coupon and each time he pretends to never have seen it. On the menu the same meal is named something else and cost $34 So the coupon list a meal which they claimed isnt on the menu and they are giving you 50% off but its the same one listed on the menu for $2 more than the coupon price which claims 50% off....  When i brought it up, everyone was claiming its a different meal... i asked what was different about it... oh its not on the menu... yes it is, i got the meat dinner... thats the same meal !!!!!!! where is this discount your claiming on this coupon your handing everyone? My wife got the more expensive dinner which inludes Surf and Turf... Their surf is just shrimp and scallops... thats all they offer...

They ran out of dinner plates all the meat was over cooked tuff and cold or maybe the steak knives were dull. A saw would have been helpful. The restrooms are not maintained the women were having to hand toilet paper underr the stalls. No paper towels. You so did we go at a busy time no..6:15 on a Tuesday  night.",

    "text": "Bought a groupon type deal for this place for my girlfriends mothers birthday and after reading the reviews I got kind of skeptical, but upon arrival our waiter Eric put my doubts to rest. Eric greeted our table almost immediately, we told him we had a deal and he went over our options we were able to choose from sangria or a bottle wine. We initially ordered the sangria and he pointed us in the direction of the salad bar which had a selection I felt was really good. I'm a picky eater and had no problem finding things to fill my plate. By the time I got my salad and assorted finger foods and sat back down the sangria had been served. Unfortunately the sangria was too sweet for the majority of our group so only about 2 1/2 glasses had been consumed I let Eric know and he switched it out no questions asked and no extra charge for a delicious bottle wine he had recommended.   The meats came around at a perfect pace the table never had an empty plate until we were full and flipped our cards over. To top off the night Eric heard us talking about the birthday and brought my girlfriend's mother out a piece of cake. It was an all round great experience and would recommend it to everyone.",

Meat choices are excellent and flavorful. They do need to space out the servings though. We had them all arrive at the same time, then delays of nothing at all.  The seafood was not worth the up charge. Some of the worst seafood. I'd rather \"Go Fish\" at Long John's Silvers.  It's sold as all you can eat, which is all you can eat if they actually get it served to you, and if they ever bring you more than the first plate.  It was a busy night but waiter could have been more attentive since our party was of 10. A 20% gratuity was applied to our bill. which he in no way deserved. One meat server was very helpful, and offered to get us the cuts we wanted.  In all the meats are a 4 star but the seafood is a 2 star and everything else lacks and drastically drops the rating. I will not be returning. There are a lot of Brazilian steakhouses in Las Vegas that I would much rather frequent.",

All the meat was amazing the side buffet was great. We had another Brazilian steakhouse in SF and we enjoyed this restaurant by far. We suggest buying the deal off of Travel Zoo.  The only complaint I had was the service from our waitress & hostess. The hostess did not smile, she was not inviting, and did express her enthusiasm as we entered. She acted like we were waisting her time. The waitress was not clear in the fine print from the travel zoo package, we made sure to ask prior to ordering to prevent any confusion in our bill at the end. We made our drink selection based on what she said which the package didn't include alcoholic drinks which in the end it didn't ( I didn't order one based on what she said) At the end, as we reviewed our voucher she was wrong and did not correct it until I called her out in her mistake. She did provide us a free cheesecake until she noticed my frustration. Food two thumbs up!!! SERVICE SUCKED!",

When you have all hands on deck, everyone committed and willing to do their part, then you create an atmosphere for success. From the moment you walk in the door, you're greeted promptly with a warm smile! Although there was a wait (both nights), it speaks to the quality of service and food you receive. Well worth the wait!   Our server, Rhyanna, was beautiful, inside and out. She greeted is, checked on us throughout our meal, made sure we were accommodated, engaged in a friendly chat, all while keeping up with other tables. Ray (Majestic mustache) wasn't even our server, but made himself available to us.  Manny, the manager, was professional and attentive to his staff and customers! Most managers are often seen when problems arise.  However, Manny paced the floor in certain way that just set the standard for the rest of his staff. ALL hands on deck!   Food- we had the all you can eat meat rodizio. Go for it. I was defeated by all of the options they provided. Although everything was delectable, my favorites were: Bacon wrapped filet mignon Roasted chicken  Bacon wrapped chicken   And to top it off!  The place was clean! At the thought of a \"buffet,\" I cringed. However, everything was kept stocked and clean. You could even watch them make some items fresh!  If you are in Vegas, DO NOT pass up this place! Well worth the $$$! Thank you guys for an awesome time tonight!! We will be back!",

The drinks are expensive.  They do not have the health inspection rating posted.  When we went back the next day to ask where it is, a lady stepped forward who appeared to be in charge, said she never heard of it.",

    "text": "So very disappointed, the service lacked, went for lunch and the main dining room was empty but they were seating everyone out of it to give the appearance the the restaurant was full. The salad bar met our expectations but the meats lacked and the amount of time for it to come out was a real bummer. Every meat was rare, even the seasoning tasted odd like they didn't leave it on the grill long enough to be marinated. Other times the server will offer to cook the meat to your liking but they were indifferent didn't care to make your experience pleasant. The $2 water conservation fee is listed on the bottom of the menu in small print the waiter doesn't ask if you'd like the water they just bring it out. Won't be back and it's quite sad. Avoid the dissatisfaction.",

    "text": "Service = 4 Stars Food = 3 Solid Stars Value = 4 Stars  I ate here for lunch twice and breakfast once when staying in Vegas across the street.  I was with wife and kids and wanted quality food, nice setting, a bit away from casino smoke.  It's a very nice setting.  Upscale interior, solid furniture, nice waiting area.  Service was uniformly good if not great throughout stay.  It's a nice upscale all, right on the strip, and most importantly, it was very reasonably priced compared to other VEGAS Strip eating options.  If this was in Henderson, I might give it 1/2 star off as Value would fall.  They have an excellent $6 Steak and Eggs breakfast.  Steak is top sirloin, served to your desired temperature (like mine medium).  Eggs were standard scrambled the way I ordered.  Potatoes were fried \"home fries\".  For Steak and Eggs of this quality, would have paid twice this and been happy.  Now on to lunch.  I had the meat \"buffet\" option both other times.  Now, most importantly you have to understand this:  * Quality of meet for $20 buffet lunch is not going to be what you would get for a $40-50 dinner buffet at other Brazillian restaurants.  It's just not going to happen.  Instead, you get very tasty sausage, rotisserie mini chicken pieces, bacon wrapped turkey chunks, and some slice top sirloin.    No premium meats.  But the meats they give you are tasty and filling.  Plus, you get an excellent \"salad bar\" buffet.  I'm not a huge buffet person, but it's a nice one.  Cheeses, olives, salads, soups, breads, etc.  I thought the calamari salad was pretty decent, and loved the fresh mozzarella, olives, artichokes, heart of palm salad, and a few other dishes.  So say what you will about this restaurant, but I think it's a decent to very good value.  I think the setting is very nice.  The service is good.  And the food is tasty and filling and not overly expensive.    I do think you could get very expensive for dinner or if you run up certain menu choices, but that's your choice, isn't it?  Just don't think you are going to be in a nice setting, right on the strip, and get the same meal you could get at a Fuego de Chao.",

    "text": "We had a $99 Groupon dinner for two.  For the amount of food/drinks you get, I think it's a good deal.  We made a reservation and were seated about 5 min after we checked in with the hostess.  She wasn't very welcoming but they were extremely busy that night so maybe she was overwhelmed.  We went on a Saturday night and the place was PACKED.  I'm talking every seat had someone in it, including those outside of the restaurant.  There is not much privacy or space between you and those seated around you.  I could hear the convo at the table next to me clear enough to join theirs and my sister and I had to talk pretty loudly to each other throughout the meal.  It was a little confusing who our waiter was since two kept coming by to check on us.  I appreciate the extra effort, but it seems like they are a little disorganized.  There were plenty of gauchos and the meat just kept on coming, so zero complaints there.  We also had no issues ordering alcoholic drinks (yes, the groupon includes those!)  The salad bar and side bar were well stocked the entire time we were there.  They were on it!  Those items were fresh and tasted decently.  Most things, like the mashed potatoes and gravy, needed salt/pepper.  My favourite meat out of them all was the pork.  I don't eat pork often but it was flavorful and very juicy.  The steak/filet mignon that they had was most of the time cooked rare, and if you wanted it cooked longer you had to ask.  The surf n turf plate was very minimal, and unfortunately it was room temp, but that's ok with me b/c I don't eat a lot of seafood anyways.  The Groupon also came with a dessert.  We chose Tres Leches dessert and split it.  It was enough for her and me, especially after all the meat we consumed.  It was an average experience so I'm relieved I didn't pay full price.  Rodizio is a better option at this price point.",

We got in at about 1045pm. Your starches and veggies are buffet style.   I gave them a three stars because of the wait. Our proteins came out super slow. So slow, that we got full and did not eat as much. In the hour that we sat, we got served one round of 5 different proteins. Not all that were listed on the menu. The fillet mignon was bloody. They didn't not have a variety on the sword, just medium rare. The other proteins were good. Our drinks went dry and at the end of our dinner our waiter emerged. He apologized and discounted our meal and drinks. I could not understand the wait though. I counted only two other families in the restaurant. Maybe, it was near closing and everyone just wanted to go home after a long day of work?",

I am not sure if he was overwhelmed or what but still it was \"not good\"!service, the waiter never introduced himself either.  The food was really good and the  salad bar was super solid. I feel like the gentleman who came around and served meat were prompt and came around plenty. I did surf and turf and the small plate of fish they brought was adequate and I could have requested more, especially since it was not offered.  Honestly since it was a groupon if there is ever another one I will go back, the food was solid and you can't beat the location.",

Luckily we had a coupon, buy one get one free, so we totally took advantage and took him here for his birthday.  If it wasn't for the coupon we definitely would have gone to another Brazilian steakhouse in town.  The restaurant was super duper busy when we went. Luckily we had reservations. One thing I noticed off the bat was how close together the tables were set up. For a place that has servers constantly going from table to table with skewers in hand, you would think they would allow more walking space. But nope! Thankfully we were on the outside vs in the middle of the dining area.   Now the food, the servers didn't come to the table all too much and when they did, the meats weren't all that great. They were dry and tough. I don't remember there being a lot of selections offered either. There were also a lot of empty pots in the salad bar. They obviously had a hard time keeping up with the crowd that evening.   The one good thing though was our waitress. She was amazing.  She always made sure our glasses were full and checked in on us regularly.  She made the experience decent for us.  So would we come back...most likely no.",

The service was \"okay\" from our waiter Jake, but exceptional from one of the Pasadors (Walter). We asked both our waiter and Walter on the status of our food that was taking a long time, and Walter was the only of the two that came back each time giving us updates, whereas Jake didn't come back until I caught him in passing to ask for the check.   Walter was exceptional and was very attentive to our requests.  He went out of his way to figure out for me a specific steak that I had tried when the Pasadors had first started rounds on our table.   I've rated a 4/5, thanks to Walter's service and of course, the food.  -1 star for the service from our waiter and the wasteful rule of not being able to have a takeaway box for your food for specific meals.   Going to Las Vegas for a vacation, your experiences (& the food) are part of what makes Vegas memorable. Thanks to Walter, our experience at Pampas was a lot better than what it would've been with only Jake waiting on us.   Thank you Walter for providing TRUE customer service!

The steak was AMAZING. The bacon wrapped chicken was awesome too, but my favorite was the grilled pineapple!   The place was beautifully decorated and our waiter was great! We got a deal off Groupon which made it even better!   The only reason I gave this place a 4 instead of a 5 is because their sides where slim pickings and didn't look appetizing. The mashed potatoes were good and the rice was great but you can't really mess those things up. The other carb they prepared for lunch was a white sauced with tomatoes pene past and it was not good at all.   Glad I came for the experience but if I want a Brazilian steak house again I'll probably try to find a different one to try out.",

We arrived around 8 and had reservations. I didn't see any parties waiting to be seated either.   Our waiter was very informative when we told him this was our first time. He suggested a few things and still told us what the best deal would be. The salad bar area was amazing. It had more than enough options for us. The meats kept coming ... up until the Medium Rare. When I mentioned to one of the managers (because he happened to ask me how the night was going) he personally had the guys serving the meat come to our table first. I was so impressed. I also asked the same manager for a personal side of hot green beans. I saw it pass me on a plate and didn't see it at the salad bar area. So when I asked him he was more than happy to give me a side of the hot green beans. His name is Kyle and he knew how satisfied I was with their service and the dinner.

Thank goodness for the Tix 4 Tonight Dining Discount card, we wouldn't have found this restaurant and deal.   The first day a couple of us opted for the AYCE Meat w/ salad bar option ($14) and the second day we all opted for the salad bar option only ($10). I didn't order the Meat option but from what I can observe, there were about 5 varieties of meat on skewers that came to our table.   If you prefer vegetables over meat, I highly recommend the Salad Bar only option (what I ordered). There's a vast selection of cold salads (garbanzo bean salad, tomato mozzarella basil salad, couscous salad, pasta salad, green bean salad), mixed greens, the usual accoutrements (olives, carrots, tomatoes, heart of palm, roasted red peppers, cucumbers), assorted roasted vegetables, soups, Brazilian bread (yummmmmy crack bread, couldn't get enough), assorted fruits, plantains(!!!), and so much more. (See photos)   Pampas Brazilian Grille is a unique concept in Las Vegas dining. An all you can eat Brazilian Steakhouse, also known as a Churrascaria, it's a great place for meat lovers (and vegetarians who can dive right into the salad bar with such a great selection of vegetables and other stuff).   If you're curious: The Tix 4 Tonight Dining Discount card came complimentary from show tickets we purchased at the Tix 4 Tonight booth along the strip. Pretty good deal!",

Ok, so we made a reservation for 7 people for some good Brazilian bbq and arrived in time and after maybe 5minutes of waiting we got seated.  First of all the decor was actually nice! I mean 7 guys eating an all you can it bbq, so we don't care  BUT it was nice and I would 100% bring my gf here next time I'm vegas as a last day stuffing night!  Anyways we got seated and Paris greeted us with the biggest and the most genuine smile and her attitude was so perfect. JUST PERFECT! I felt like she could get me the moon if I had asked for it!  We ate or rather stuffed our face with various meats. I recommend the sirloin and the house special meat(I forget the name) but the sirloin is a lot more tender! You can always ask the \"meat guys(lack of a better name)\" to give you the inside/ouside meat and rare/medium/well or however you like it! And most of the meat guys were very cool too! Except that one old guy with a big belly, he kinda had an attitude but he won't take any stars off because the other people there deserve a 5 star if not more!!  Some of the menu we wished weren't rotating so we asked if Paris can help! And it like literally came out a minute later! Damn girl!  Well so here is the slice. 4/5 atmosphere 5/5 service 4.5/5 quality of food  And if you go to Pampas, wish to the all mighty gods that you are being served by a guardian angel Paris! Well tip well!! She really deserves it!!",

The salad bar was probably the highlight, but after driving for 6 hours San Diego to Vegas, the first thing I wanted was a nice cold glass of anything they was alcohol related. We ordered..... i looked around and there were about 5 other tables that were occupied. It took the girl about 15 minutes to get my drink, mind you I had to ask her again. Meat.... Cold, SO dry, it scraped the roof of my mouth, bland... no kind of sauce to spruce it up. I had to get some chimichurri from the salad bar. The linguicas were shriveled up and chewy, I almost choked on it... i literally left just about everything on the plate, except for the olives and s couple of pieces of lamb. The gentleman who brought the meat to our table were very delightful... that's what the one star is for.. the meal was 279 plus 15% tip... a total loss. I dare you to go, and if you do, all I will say is, I told ya!",

We ended up both ordering the salmon and I was pleased with how well seasoned and fulfilling it was, but the portion was on the smaller side. The salmon came with potatoes and grilled vegetables but I would've rather had more salmon to eat. With our meal we were able to get access to the salad bar which was one of my favorite parts of the meal. They offered a good selection of salads as well as starters to choose from like meats, potatoes and small sides like that. After enjoying our meal, the bottled Vero water and  salad bar we ordered some cheesecake which we were very pleased with. They even decorated the plate with the anniversary image pictured which was a nice touch. Although pricey I believe the meal would be worthwhile and I would come back.",

The water on the table - large bottle of water cost $10, and this was even tap water... This meal cost us $75 for lunch special, which was not worth it....

    "text": "Whew.. where do I start..  My family and I came to have lunch at this place only to be sat down for 15mins before anyone even came over to acknowledge us. Before anyone approached us, my mom asked another worker if she can speak to the manager.. Do you think a manager came over? Absolutely Not! So finally a server came over by the name of Erica, super rude server.Told us that no one can share food or let anyone at our table eat some of our food. Excuse me, that is ridiculous!! She also had another server (JoAnna) watching us to make sure no one was sharing. It was a very uncomfortable experience eating here and I wish we would have went to a different steak house.  We had a few free vouches to this place and maybe that's why we were treated the way we were but you never know who is around you. Everyone didn't use vouchers, we have money & it shows that people will treat you different and not have any idea who you and your family are .They bring over water in these glass bottles and you can definitely taste that it is tap water... yuck..plus we didn't even ask for water she just brought it over, only to find out it's $5 smh, at least ask people if they want water and don't forget to tell them it's $5 and also Tap water . My sister paid for Unlimited shrimp and asked for a Togo box and the other server (JoAnna)that Erica had watching us told my sister \" I have to see if you can take that Togo\". Finally our sever comes over and brings a Togo box and bag the states that she's not suppose to do this but will. Mind you, they did for other tables that had unlimited meat etc.. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. DO NOT waste your time. Food was okay but you'll be better off going somewhere else. It took so long just for us to receive our check so we can go on with our day. The manager Marjorie then comes over ( we've asked for her well over an hour ago) all she can say was she apologizes and she waived the rest of our check. Who wants to receive this type of service while out of town? Please do better on staffing and customer service. We will NEVER return to this place and I advise you to not step foot in here.",

    "text": "All the negative reviews you've read about this place - believe the hype.  I came here for the rodizio lunch with a reservation, was promptly sat at a table, but that's where it quickly became apparent that this place doesn't care about anything at all.  I was with a group of 4 total, and we all ordered the rodizio lunch... after about 10 minutes of waiting for a server to come by, anyway.  So then we head to the salad bar \"market station\" and it is about as sad as can be.  I've eaten at other Churrascarias such as Fogo and Texas de Brazil - both of which are top notch - and this place Pampas is a joke compared to them.  The sides offered on the bar were all very basic and bland, if not just gross in many instances... the Brazilian cheese bread was hard as a brick even when they brought out \"fresh\" ones... and overall it was just a pitiful display.  But that's only the start.    When we all returned to our tables with our uninspiring plates of sides... we were ready to at least dig into some hopefully delicious meat.  5 minutes... nothing comes by.  10 minutes... nothing still.  15 minutes... wow, nothing.  I ask the server what's going on, and he says that they will be by any minute now, though I can tell he doesn't give a crap about anything.  5 more minutes we wait, now starving because the salad bar has nothing to offer... and still nothing.  At this point we discuss if we should just get up and leave.  I decide to talk to the manager and tell her the situation and that we are just going to leave, and she doesn't seem surprised or apologetic at all.  Just says that's fine, we can leave.  What a complete joke.  Oh and here's the kicker - they were offering \"buy one get one free\" rodizio to get you in there... but then what you get wouldn't even be worth buy one get 10 free.  Beware for sure... you can literally eat anywhere else in Vegas and your experience will be better.  This place won't be around much longer as it exists now.",

Gnats everywhere   The lamb was served with a sauce similar to a balsamic vinaigrette.. how hard is it to get some green mint? This place is obviously run by someone who doesn't care.   Our server lied to us to attempt to get us to close our tab early.  Don't come here.

While the food was good, several of the meats were rather dry and for the hour we were there, probably only 4-5 different types of meats went by (we ordered the most expensive option with 12 meats). If I was paying $30 a person it wouldn't be terrible, but for $60 plus a tip, I would rather go to a Morton's or Ruth's Chris. Our waiter was extremely friendly and attentive, the salad bar had lots of options which I probably enjoyed more than the meats (again, for me, not worth $60 for pasta salad). Thank god we had a groupon which helped cut the price in half. With the groupon I say definitely try it, without it, not worth the price to go more than once.",

My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary along with the first time away from our kids overnight and we wanted good food.  Server: We had Constantin for our server. He was incredible. He was welcoming, friendly, comedic (appropriately), and down to earth. Where some people give a lower level of service when you have a Groupon he did NOT. He even reminded us that the Groupon includes dessert and to save room!  Ambiance: I did get the feeling that they tend to seat Groupon customers closer to the bar area so you don't get the full feeling of the ambiance of the restaurant however it was still a great table and the bar wasn't loud at all. (In fact our drinks likely came faster because we were near the bar.  Food: Where do I begin? WOW! I was beyond impressed. Perhaps I had low expectations after reading some of the poor reviews but I LOVED everything! My favorites: the bacon wrapped filet mignon, the flank steak, and the roasted chicken. These were incredible and my mouth is literally watering thinking of the flavor and juiciness of these foods. I was there only two nights ago and I am still drooling! The salad bar is wonderful- try the fried bananas! The white chocolate cheesecake- phenomenal. I was too full to finish all of it (Constantin had warned us!) but it was SO good!   The waiters kept coming around with more and more meats. I could have sat there and ate all night however we had a show to get to and I was STUFFED!   I am not sure what happened with the poor reviews. We had great service, the food and drinks were excellent, and they weren't snobby about us having a Groupon. I WILL be back!",

The broccolini and the marinated carrots were good as well. The meats were very flavorful and I was stuuuuffed afterwards. The mahi mahi and the shrimp were my favorite. For dessert we got the cheesecake and it was amazing and rich,  This time I went in early Jan '13 when there was way less of a crowd with my mom. Again, I made reservations and was seated right away.

    "text": "I've been to my fair share of Brazilian steakhouses in a few different places. First with the good: the service was awesome from the hostess to our waitress to all the gentlemen that came and offered us the different cuts of meat. Everyone had a smile on their face and when we responded in Spanish they spoke back to us in Spanish and made us feel welcomed. There was a variety of cuts and I tried: lamb, garlic sirloin, tri tip, bacon wrapped filet mignon, and pork. Now the bad: there are 12 cuts of meat offered but in the hour it took me and my sister to finish our bottle of wine the tri tip came to our table about 7 times, the other cuts would rarely circulate. I had to ask for the lamb and garlic sirloin to be brought out but it seemed that some cuts are not brought out unless requested. The salad bar was a bit messy but the cheese bread was delicious. The ambience is satisfactory but the noise level drowned out any music the restaurant may have been playing but I feel like they may not even had any dinner music.",

This is the place to go. But I would not go and pay full price... It is best to go get the half-price discount vouchers.  The salad bar is underwhelming it is not like the more popular Brazilian steakhouse is like Fogo de Chao .  The fillet and other meats are also not top-quality meats...",

We sat THERE FOR 15 MINUTES until I asked one of the many people walking back and forth if we could get some service.  The couple sitting next to us got so upset they left. We had already paid so we decided to stay. The drinks were EXTREMELY sour, like it was the bartenders first day. The mashed potatoes had no flavor and all the meat was cold, chewy and flavorless.

There is definitely a large variety to pick from, but my boyfriend and I got tired of chewing after like our fourth slice of meat because it was so chewy/tough.

    "text": "Came here with a Groupon ($52 for all-you-can-eat surf 'n' turf and unlimited mimosas, sangria, or beer for two during lunch hours, which is before 4 PM) and we enjoyed the experience! My review is only about the Groupon we used, since we did not order anything else. Note: you have to pay for water + tax at the end, even if you didn't really drink water. Not including tip, we probably paid about $60 after water and taxes, if I remember correctly.   Definitely come here hungry if you plan on doing this, since meat and drinks fill you up pretty quickly.   Here's how it works: once you're seated, you can start with the salad bar and order your drink. When that's done, different staff members will come around holding different cuts of meat, and you can choose whether or not you want to take it or wait for something else to come around. If you've ever been to a dim sum restaurant, it's a little like that except with meats instead of carts of dim sum, and of course everything was already paid for. Once you're done eating meat, they bring you a dessert to share, and you pay and leave!  My least favorite thing was probably the salad bar. We pretty much had to choose from pre-made salads since they didn't have the individual salad toppings anywhere, just plain lettuce or things like cole slaw, potato salad, green bean salad, etc. However, they have a bunch of cheeses to choose from as well as some breads, chips, soups, and other miscellaneous items. Lots of options!  Get the white sangria! We tried that and the mimosas, but the white sangria was better in my opinion.   The service here was THE BEST. Everyone was so nice and enthusiastic.   Some of the meats were great, and some were just okay. They give you this wooden cylinder with red on one end and green on the other. Green side up = more meat, red side up = no more for now. We were gorging on meat for a little over an hour while we were there, and my favorite was the sirloin! So tender, medium-rare, and juicy. Some of the pork we got was pretty dry, so I didn't get too much of that.  They also had bacon-wrapped chicken, sausages, tri-tip, grilled pineapple, etc.  The seafood dish they bring you has mussels on it as well as some shrimp and salmon, and you can ask for another if you finish the plate, since they won't be bringing it around like they do the meat.   We had the flan for dessert and it was delicious! I'll be uploading a picture later.   Overall, I would do it again with a Groupon.",

Someone handed us a coupon while we were waiting in line, so we basically got in for the price of one. Ironically, I don't eat meat very often and was worried they wouldn't have enough options for me. The \"salad bar\" (or whatever you want to call it) is heaven. You can get by without ever having a bite of meat, if you'd like. They have pasta, vegetables, rolls, cheese, olives...  Because I wanted the full experience, I tried a little bit of everything anyway. Oddly, I didn't enjoy most of the meat all that much. Some of it seemed overcooked and tough to chew (maybe that's how it's supposed to be?). It wasn't bad, but I personally didn't care for it. Still, the place was PACKED. So it must be good.  There's something for everyone; so if you get the opportunity, give it a try! Staff was very friendly. We had made reservations and had to wait for maybe five minutes, so not bad at all.",

We had a server in the beginning and then another one towards the end. Andrea, the server name on the receipt we think was our server towards the end was nothing less than cheerful wonderful. The meat service took longer than anticipated. We were there for approximately 30-40 minutes and was not offered as much meat as we predicted. Was expecting more flavor, and more of the melt in your mouth texture with a rare piece. Gave them three stars because I had higher expectations with the food than what was presented to us.",

We were told that they could only honor the coupon if we also ordered their seafood special ( an additional $28 ). Then we also had to order a drink ( $8 ). Finally, we also learned that we will be charged for TAP WATER  ( $1 per person). So the dinner for 2 that was supposed to cost  about $55 with the coupon all the sudden became $93. .

I've been to 3 other Brazilian Steakhouses and had amazing experiences at all 3 but not this one. The salad bar is basic and not like a typical Brazilian style but that's ok I really came for the meat. The meat took FOREVER to come out... they come by with 2 meats then disappear for 20 min then come back and at that rate your body starts to digest the food and your full so you don't get the real Brazilian Steakhouse experience. The sad part is I read another review before writing this and others have had the same experience so the business doesn't care to change. Don't waste your time here, I only came because it was free with a timeshare. There's no wonder they barely had customers inside I would never pay to eat here I'd rather just go to In & Out at least they are fast with their food. Oh and last but not least I'm inserting a picture of a \"medium-rare steak\" but I'll let you be the judge of how \"rare\" it was, it was definitely well done. All of the meat was inconsistent and flavorless. Hopefully management reads this and makes a change. Otherwise stay away!!",

    "text": "So, I got this restaurant with a Groupon for lunch for 2.    It was definitely worth the Groupon.   We got a plate of seafood (shrimp, mussels, salmon, and talipa).   I hate seafood... But the talipa had good flavor.    We also got access to the salad bar which was more expansive than most Brazil restaurants.   They had fresh mozzarella which I was happy with.    The meats themselves were OK....   They didn't have the flavor I am used to.   They were a little bland.     Our service was very good and we also got an hour of all you can drink beer, sangria, mimosa, wine.... The sangria was very good, but different than most sangria's.      The atmosphere was nice, but the tables were a bit cramped....   This is well worth the Groupon... But is a little high otherwise...  There was only 8 meats at lunch and the normal price was more than a normal Brazil restaurants....",

    "text": "Came here for dinner after a long day. It was similar to the one in New York. It was a buffet style Brazilian place. I had the meat rodizio and my significant other had the surf and turf rodizio. The seafood part of the rodizio wasn't good and wasn't worth it at all. The meats that were given were a hit or miss. Some were really good and some had too much fat. My favorite meat would probably be the garlic sirloin steak. The filet mignon wrapped in bacon was not good. The chicken was really juicy and flavorful. The lamb was undercooked....which was kind of nasty. Our waiter was really friendly and conversational. What I would like to see is more salad ingredients. Overall, it was a good experience.",

We had previously purchased 3 Groupons for $65 for two deal, it included all the meats, salad bar , unlimited drinks and seafood! There are attendee outside the restaurant asked if You're in for Groupon or not, you may also get the coupon from them if you didn't!  After we were quickly seated, the Server we had were amazing! Although it might take him 2 rounds to get our cocktails each round but he brought as many as we wanted, the only thing that was lacking were the shock tops we didn't get to have extra of that after a few because the machine ran out. Overall since bottomless drinks were included we all got a pretty good buzz of it!   Highly recommend everyone to try this out, they're generous and had a variety of food and drinks!!",

My girlfriend and I went because of <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a>, and I realize that a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> offer should be a red flag to begin with, but I work across the street from Planet Hollywood and my girlfriend is a Brazilian steakhouse aficionado. So we went.  It was a huge mistake. The service was great. Our server Marco was friendly and attentive, burdened by poor management and a sub par kitchen. But even his excellent service couldn't make up for all the problems with our meal. It started off poorly; we sat down and ordered Hendricks martinis and a bottle of Pinot - yes we are drinkers - and they were out of both. We nixed the cocktails and picked another bottle, and to Pampas' credit they adjusted the price to match the 86'ed bottle. We were optimistic, glad they went out of their way to accommodate us.  There are essentially 3 options on the menu: meat, seafood, and both. I believe the meat was 43, the seafood 48, and the combo 54. I got the seafood and my girl got the meat. Yes it's ok that sentence was funny.   I am a Brazilian steakhouse neophyte, so I was a little surprised that the first thing we do after ordering was go to a salad bar. This was disgusting. Wilted salad, stale bread, and a stab at Asian cuisine that makes PF Chiang's look like Nobu. I grabbed a little Caesar salad and cafeteria pasta salad and braced for the worst.  And worse it got. First of all, as soon as we sat down from the salad bar they immediately started piling my girlfriend's plate with food, but my seafood took 25 minutes, so that was slightly awkward. However, it did give me a chance to sample the meat.   The meat sucked. We had pork tenderloin first, which was woefully overcooked. This was followed by beef that had some kind of cheese crust that was disgusting. The procession that followed was all mediocre at best, and it was all overcooked! We went in late, like 930, so maybe that was why everything was dry and well done. But for the price I don't think it's too much to ask for properly cooked meat. The lone exception was the lamb, which was delicious.  Eventually my seafood came. It came with baked salmon, cod, shrimp, and mussels. The menu claimed bacon-wrapped scallops were included as well, but we didn't receive those until we requested them. It was essentially buffet quality seafood. The mussels were cold. Only half the shrimp were actually peeled. The fried cod was hard and hot on the outside and cold on the inside. When the scallops finally showed up, they were also cold.  We skipped dessert. The whole experience was dismal, and the modicum of savings we got from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> didn't really make up for the waste of 2 hours. Planet Hollywood is simply a black hole for food, I would avoid the whole hotel.",

Anywho, some of the meats were really good, like their house special and their filet.  They had a prosciutto wrapped scallop which I really liked as well.  But everything else is average compared to the competitors.  If they are going to charge the same prices as the other Brazilian steakhouses, they gotta kick it up a notch.  Everyone loves the cheese bread from Brazilian steakhouses, but this place's, like a lot of the other items, are just nothing to write home about!",

As soon as we walked in though I felt like I was walking into a Soup Plantation or something. The tables didn't have table cloths and the dining area felt like a cafeteria. The salad bar was okay and I can't put my finger on it but felt much cheaper than others I've been to, and the meat was good but not great.  Pet peeve: We had the card on the red (aka don't serve us) side for the latter half of the meal yet the servers kept stopping by to try to give us meat.   Even with the $10 off each the meal was way overpriced for what we got.  Food: Okay Service: Okay Location: Convenient in the mall Ambiance: Not great Value: Overpriced",

Most of the meat was under flavored and some was chewy and over cooked while others were pretty good. and the same meat was brought to our table it wasn't until we were full and at the end of our dinner they started coming around with the better meat . Also the shrimp was not peeled found that odd your at a nice dinner getting meesy peeling shrimp . Salad bar was ok ANd the thing I enjoyed most was the variety of olives in feta. We were not sat in a very cozy seat area either especially since It was a birthday and I had mentioned that when making reservations and they said don't worry we will do something special and nope nothing.    My main complaint was it took 20 minutes to get our first water and even with the groupon it brought the total to about 100$ my suggestion save your money and go to Texas da Brazil  over all it was an ok experience but I would not go there again unless it was free",

Upon entering we were impressed how elegant it looked inside especially since it is in the mall, but it was really nice.  We were seated and greeted right away and our waiter was awesome!  I'm so sorry I can't remember his name but he's from England! He was so attentive and very nice.  I felt like he really wanted to make sure that we were enjoying ourselves and had everything we needed.  And the rest of staff kept visited our tables frequently and kept our plates full.  I was not as impressed with their salad bar and side offerings as one of their competitors but it was good enough for our vegetarian that we had with us.  If you're going to eat here, come hungry!  Try everything as they are delish but my favorite was the sausage, garlic sirloin and chicken drums. So good!  For the amount that I ate, I can't really justify paying full price but if they have the same deal again, we'd be back for sure!  Thanks for a great experience Pampas!",

To our disappointment, they didn't come close to the competition.  Pampas lacks in the areas of cleanliness, service, food, and atmosphere.  I would compare it to a buffet that primarily focus on serving proteins.  Don't get me wrong, they do have a decent salad bar.  But the experience and value that you receive in return for the price you pay is just poor.   This is the only churrascaria (to my knowledge) that has both surf and turf option.  However, if you choose to go opt for the meat only.  The seafood here consisted of salmon, scallops, shrimp, and a fish that I can't recall.  None were impressive and the unnamed fish was terrible.  The highlight of our mean was the Picanha.  This is the \"C\" shaped meat that Brazilian churrascaria's are known for.  Then again, if you can't get this right... then you don't deserve to call yourself a Brazilian steakhouse.  The service here is average at best.  Expect your table to pile up with plates you haven't finished.  The servers don't exchange and clean off plates / tables often so you'll be showing off the carnage of items you didn't finish to other patrons.  So would I ever return?  Only if every other Brazilian churrascaria goes out of business and shuts down.  In a city that is overwhelmed with AYCE buffets and Brazilian steakhouse options, you would be better off spending your money and time elsewhere.",

On a side note, we found a Groupon coupon for Pampas- buy one, get one ultimate Surf and Turf dinner. We saved approximately $50 on our meal. In addition to the Surf and Turf, we received one appetizer and dessert. We ordered the ceviche, which was made with coconut milk and was outstanding! We ordered the tiramisu for dessert, and found room for it even though we were stuffed.  What a great experience we had at Pampas! We'll definitely return.",

Apparently half of the positive reviews from this restaurant came from the same IP address yelp told me when I came to write my review. That should say something! The food was disgusting and we had to ask for the manager to even complain. Rice undercooked, pasta at room temperature, meat was low quality. Manager did take food off and we just paid for 2 sodas. Please be careful spending your money here! This place is not fit to be a restaurant.",

Food: The pao de queijo tasted like bisquick bacon and cheese biscuits. I love me some biscuits but please, they're not the same thing. We paid $1/person for water. We ordered the pitcher of sangria and received a pitcher of ice with murky purple sugar water. No fruit. Can't taste the wine. Maybe it was a powdered sangria mix? And finally the meat. It's adequate but not good. Selection is weak and the chicken comes around four times for each time a beef item comes around.

The Meat Guys came around often and the meats were hot, not overcooked and very favorful.  Our favorite was the tri-tip and the garlic pork.  The signature sirloin was another hit but didn't come out until later in the evening.  Another highlight was the young lady who was making the Caipirinhas,  They were incredible!!!!  Dessert was light and oh so good.  We're locals and had a groupon.  I would recommend Pampas to our friends.",

Although the food was plentiful and the price (with the Groupon) was okay, the salad bar fell way short both in selection and accessibility. They didn't seem to be able to adequately accommodate the request for rare meat and certain items didn't seem to come around unless requested. One thing they did have on the Groupon package that we either didn't have or weren't aware of at TdB was a surf and turf which was very nice. The wait staff though was pleasant and attentive. Overall, the place was okay, but I'd opt for elsewhere.",

It has a robust tomato-enriched flavor that is expected from a bouillabaisse but with an added creaminess from the coconut milk. It sort of reminded me of Thai coconut curry but lighter. It is luxurious! The seafood, scallops, mussels, shrimp, lobster tail are cooked to perfection - sweet, juicy, and succulent. The linguine is a great way to enjoy any of the left over sauce. You don't want to waste it. Thumbs up, way up!  Grilled Salmon Sandwich is Pacific salmon grilled with sweet and sour malagueta pepper sauce atop garlic cheese bread with your choice of Caesar salad, steamed rice, or French fries. Wow! This is the best salmon sandwich ever! The salmon is a thick fillet grilled to perfection. The cheese is melty and gooey. The hearty baguette holds up well and adds a slight sourdough flavor. The malagueta peppers are the perfect heat for this - slightly spicy with some sweetness giving it a great flavor without scorching your taste buds. Thumbs up, way up!",

Our team discussed where to go. We all agreed that Brazilian bbq was going to be it, and I still needed to coordinate with the hostess for a private room. Briana at Pampas communicated well with all the details. She gave us several options on how to reserve and pay for our private room.  The private room did not disappoint, in fact the entire comfortable vibe of the room fit our group of seventeen perfectly. Pampas served us several different types and cuts for meat. The bacon wrapped chicken was our first serving, but only our first. We enjoyed steak, lamb, and more pork. Everyone enjoyed their meal. Our VP is a little picky about his wines. So picky that he is known to send glasses back. At our dinner he liked the wine so much he ordered a total of three bottles for the entire table. Other drinks were provided for everyone as well.  Our private room allowed us to discuss company matters. It allowed us privacy. Yet still, we had some of the most attentive, and ready staff at any place we've eaten.  The next day, everyone shared e-mails together about how great our meals went.  We recommend Pampas for any company party. Thank you for the service!",

Whatever the specialty meat was and the sausage, were by far the stars of the meal along with the mojitos.  The rest of the meat was meh.  The plate of seafood was terrible and not even worth eating.  The salad bar had a great selection, but we stuffed ourselves so full of meat that we barely ate anything from the salad bar.    The mojito was really good.  We tried another rum based drink but ended up getting a second round of mojitos because they were delicious.    For the price, there is no way you should go here without getting 2 for 1.  Especially now that I've read some of the other reviews that show how prolific the coupons are.  I really prefer not to have to resort to coupons.  I really just want good food and good service at an honest price.  The prices here are jacked up more higher than Disneyland's to account for the abundance of coupons.",

We started by the waiter making us wait an unacceptable amount of time before taking our order. The price for the meat buffet both with and without seafood was excessive. We decided to take the salad buffet. The menu description was nothing like the actual.The selection was limited and best described as average.Specifically the menu said chili (my favorite)...there was none...only one kind of soup..very watery...no protein of any note...the fried bananas were above average...we then topped it all off with a wonderful chocolate mousse cake that would have done any restaurant proud...then the bill came...they overcharged us for a drink...they waiter agreed immediately to remove from the bill.He agreed so quickly that it was apparent he knew before we brought it to his attention..(why would he bring an incorrect bill)...during the meal they brought everyone a bottle of their water...now they charged for it...the waiter pointed out that the menu said there was a mandatory charge...the print on the menu was so small that no one would see it...it was a small charge but I struggled with the way it was implemented...given the slow service, the attitude of the waiter, the incomplete selection in the buffet compared to the menu, I would not return to this restaurant...I did not think the value was represented in the price...",

    "text": "I'm a bit spoiled here, I must admit, because I have been to several top notch rodizios (Fogo de Chao, Texas de Brazil, Boi na Braza and Nelore) - and Pampas really doesn't match up to those in food quality or variety of offerings.  I think if I had never been to a rodizio before I'd have been somewhat impressed, as the picanha was pretty decent and the seafood that came with the surf & turf was surprisingly decent.  But, most of the meat was a bit dry, except the picanha and the bacon wrapped chicken.  The ham was VERY salty.  The sausage was actually fairly overwhelming by itself, but probably would have been fine as small slices in an italian dish.  The salad bar had a decent amount of coated salad type dishes and standards but nothing I had was really exciting.  They serve the ubiquitous rodizio cheese bread as part of the salad bar instead of fresh at your table, and fried bananas instead of cinnamon plantains are on the bar as well.    One thing I will give them top marks for is the service - our waiter was super nice and attentive, in fact there was a slight mixup (not their fault) that they handled very graciously.  I had booked my reservation for 11 but didn't realize the rodizio didn't start until 11:30.  We ordered a couple cokes and were going to wait, but my honey wanted to just leave and come back.  So when I offered to pay for the cokes and explained we'd come back later, our waiter said not to worry about it, but just come back and see him later.  So I tipped him pretty big for the cokes and then again when we came back on the full meal.  I am giving them a 3 overall, though honestly anyone who has been to Fogo or TdB is likely to grade them far more harshly in comparison.  If you get a discount to come here via Tix4Tonight or Groupon it becomes a much better value for your money, but it's still not really the best example of rodizio by a long shot.",

Their meat providing is quite interesting because they bring the meat to our table and cut it, this kind of experience I never had before. The meat I really is grilled chicken and sweet pineapple.

    "text": "When I go to a restaurant, I always check two things: atmosphere and service. First, Pampas Churrascaria in Planet Hollywood had a lovely Brazilian atmosphere. Second, servers were friendly, and they provided great customer service; however, chefs seemed to give less attention to customers. For example, chefs at other restaurants always ask what part of meat a customer wants from Sirloin, but chefs in Pampas never asked about it. They just told us what part of meat they had, and they served some burnt meat to us. Their attitude toward customers did not offer me satisfaction, but the lovely atmosphere and great customer service dissolved my dissatisfaction from the chefs' attitude. In conclusion, it was a great opportunity to visit a new Brazilian BBQ restaurant in Las Vegas; however, the restaurant should provide high quality of meat, and the chefs need to have high standards of customer service. Overall, I am satisfied.",

When I got a coupon for BOGO for this place while my wife and I were vacationing in Vegas, I thought we were doing great.  Sadly, it proved to be a case of getting what you pay for.  The meat was tougher than it should have been, in part because they cut it too thick.  The salad bar was not as varied as the ones I am used to, almost as if they knew people would be paying less, so they stocked it that way to offset.  The fried bananas/plantains were evidently green rather than fully ripe before they were fried.  The promised grilled skewers of shrimp were actually  boiled shrimp that had been frozen.  The other churrascarias also had more people taking out the cuts of meat, so you don't have to wait long from the time you finish one cut until the next one is there.  At this one, that was not the case.  It also seemed that every cut was served medium or more.  I love medium rare to rare meat. Well done meat, to me, might as well be shoe leather.  Altogether, I was very disappointed.",

You sit for long extensive periods of time with nothing at all. So what ends up happening is, you have meats with no mash or veggies as you've already eaten those while waiting on the meats to be brought to the table. It seems that there are a lot of people seeming to be managers standing around doing nothing, other than surfing the internet for the latest celebrity gossip whilst guests are waiting on their meat, selections. Paying $21.99 per person for lunch, i expect the service to be decent, waiting 15 minutes between each meat attempt seems ridiculous. Having the green tag up on the table, really makes no difference. Overall when the food was brought to us, it was good, but having to wait for such extended periods between, is not enjoyable at all.",

First let me say I've tried many Brazilian steak houses and today's service was the first time I've experienced such a low level of service. Before even sitting down we sent our glasses back because the glasses were very dirty in which Waseem (our waiter) replied \"is this not clean enough for you\"? I laughed it off and kindly requested new glasses again. Secondly I wanted meat well done and well let's just say it was done very well smh. Fast forwarding past the first 30 minutes the same 4 meats kept coming around before we asked for the other selection of meats and the seafood to be brought to our table. Soon thereafter a plate of seafood came out and you can just look at the pictures yourself. Also we were charged $1 per person for water which is fine but it was just a refill of a bottle which was weird because again I've never experienced that. Ok I'm done ranting so let's leave this on a positive note. The grilled (or warmed) pineapple was very good and actually was the best part of the selection.",

    "text": "This restaurant has been the \"largest\" disappointment of our LV vacation!  We ordered Salmon and Top Sirloin and was then directed to the salad bar and told that our meal would be delivered shortly.  Well, 50 minutes later after watching other patrons come in, being served and leaving(and of course after we had completely finished with the food bar) our \"main course\" was no where in sight!  We finally \"flagged\" down our waiter - Larry and asked where our meal was.  He promised to check on it.  Well, we never saw Larry again!  Finally, when we stopped (whom we thought was a manager) she too promised to check on the progress of our meal.  Finally she returned telling us that their \"printer\" had failed to work and that our order had not been put in; but, promised it would be out in a matter of minutes.  Pretty soon, a server arrived with some skewers of red meat.  That would have been \"fine\" had I in fact ordered red meat!  The manager returned again apologizing for the mistake and \"again\" telling us \"again\" about their printer problem.  Amazingly - no one \"else\" in the Restaurant seemed to be affected by any printer problems!  So finally, my Salmon arrived on a \"saucer\" sized plate with nothing but a small plastic cup of sauce.  Quite a \"paltry\" portion for the price I must say!  Then the arrived with my husbands ( what we thought would be )Sirloin steak.  But instead, they showed up with a \"huge\" skewer of meat and carved him off \"three\" amazingly thin pieces of meat.  Because we had not opted for the \"all you can eat\" option - this was our entire meal!  Very \"sad\" showing to say the least!  The manager \"did\" comp the two beer we drank which was nice.  However, considering all the \"screw-ups\" and skimpy portions - I would have offered a certificate for a whole new meal for some later date.  That being said - we probably would not have used it anyway.  I was so \"weary\" of dodging waiters and tripping over other patrons at the food bar - I would \"never\" return!  All and all - an extremely disappointing experience.  The bottom line is - I wouldn't wish this restaurant  on my \"worst\" enemy!",

The only thing we kind of rolled our eyes at was the charge for the water. I had read about this in the reviews. It appears the brand of water they use here charges a $1.00 a glass for a conservation fee. All refills are free. I had no issue with this, the eye roll was the habit of the waitress of pouring out the glasses and THEN telling you about the fee.  Meats were all great and they came around with amazing frequency. We are all carnivores and were very satisfied. The salmon on the seafood plate was amazing. We will be back if ever in the area and are looking forward to trying Brazilian steakhouses other places we happen to be. The white peach sangria was also incredible.  I guess if i had to come up with something negative it would only be that the tables are situated closer together than i am used to.",

The salad bar was full of unique salads and the freshest ingredients.  I could fill up on the salad bar alone.  There is a flag stand for your table that you display green which notifies the meat servers to stop by your table to slice off your next portion.  When you can't eat anymore, simply flip the stand to red, which means no more.  My favorite restaurant in Las Vegas, and there are so many.  Comfortable atmosphere.  Not pretentious.  Nice lighting.  A woman from Ukraine went table to table asking if you want a photograph.  One is complimentary for your visit, but she also sells them.    Wonderful restaurant in the Miracle Mile mall.  I would highly recommend to anyone wanting a quality all-you-can-it meal in LV.  I purchased a Groupon for about $70 which was a dinner for Two and included seafood.  For a few bucks more, you can add unlimited Sangria for an hour.",

The Feijouda was black beans in extra water. Zero seasoning or meat was evident. They also did not have any faroafa to accompany the Feijouda.  The caprinias were meh and the meat was surprisingly bad. Poor cuts of meat with little care given to their preparation. The selection was also meager as I only saw tri tip, sirloin, lamb and chicken wings.   Service was relatively poor, I was able to run out of meat several times. The frequency or the servers circulating was spotty at best, and they tended to skip tables.   Even with coupons or Groupon discounts, this place is not worth it.",

Refuse it off the bat.  If the restaurant wants a table charge as in Europe at least be up front about it.  The menu is fairly extensive.  My adopted son, ordered the meats 49.00 for all the meat you can eat.  He enjoyed it. It to me some meat was of quality cut but some kinds seemed lesser cuts and seasoned to camouflage.  The salad bar was ok, olives tasted like canned, other items were clearly not prepared on site.  Lettuces were fresh and crisp.  Over all salad bar was fair at best.  The filet of beef was very tender but covered in sauce and. It cooked to order. Salmon was good.  My opinion it is highly over priced and they look for every way to boost the ticket.  Regular iced tea was 5 plus dollars. Drinks were nigh across the board. Definitely not fine dining. Place was loud and hurried.  Restaurant was busy so many must like it but for me......won't be back.",

This place is a very far cry from other, more high end Brazilian restaurants that actually bring you fresh, warm hot cheese bread and plantains, instead of forcing you to get up and get old, cold ones on the buffet yourself. Sad. Glad we had a gift card from this place. I would have been really upset if I actually had to pay for this mediocre food and service myself.",

    "text": "If I could give this place less than a star, I would. This was hands down one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant.   Walking in, we were greeted right away, and sat right away. After being seated, we had to wait about 15 minutes until we were even looked at by anyone. Finally, we were approached by our waiter, who said he would be with us in a few minutes. What?! The fifteen minute wait wasn't bad enough?   When he finally came bakc ,we ordered our drinks. We all got alcoholic drinks - and I also asked for some tap water to go alone with my meal. Upon returning, he brought back water in a glass bottle. Now, I've been to restaurants before, where they put their tap water in glass bottles to make it look more fancy - so I thought that's what this restaurant did too. WRONG.   After seeing a couple tables next to us, with just regular cups of water, we flagged down our waiter to ask if this was the TAP water we had asked for. He said no, and that they charged for each bottle. We asked how much it was for each bottle, and he said he didn't know and would go find out. There were two things wrong with this situation:      1. How the hell do you not know how much a bottle of water costs? As a server, you should know your menu inside and out.        2. It took him fifteen minutes to get back to us with a price, which meant we went fifteen minutes without anything to drink, because we had all finished our drinks as well as the water.   0 stars for service.   As for the food, bleh. Everything was salty and overcooked. They came by our table at least fifteen times with sausage, but we were only offered their beef items a few times. As for their salad bar, they had a lot of choices, but none of them really worth while. I will say that their chimichurri sauce was pretty good. Actually, it was the highlight of the meal. It was the only thing that was actually good.   I would never set foot in this place again. HORRIBLE service, and sub par food. You are better off going to Fogo de Chao or Texas de Brazil.",

Overall they provide cheap services food isn't all that great and overpriced.",

My husband could care less about salad bars but I LOVE their salad bar. It's not the standard iceberg, crouton and ranch type of deal, they have delicious fixings. They chefs come around to your table and offer you different kinds of meat, the sirloin was definitely our favorite. The drinks are good and they have the best tiramisu and cheesecake we've ever had! On both of our visits the service was great. We've only had good experiences here, we just love it.",

    "text": "Ok First off, we only go there for lunch, before 4pm. So I can't tell you  what the place is like for dinner. But I have been there for lunch going into dinner and the only difference we noticed was a couple of extra meats we didn't care for.  Anyway. Even if we had to pay the full price of $20 for lunch (meat only) we would still go very week like we do. However we bought a dozen $25 off $37.50 or more coupons with our air miles from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a>. This makes our bill $16.22 w/ tax for the both of us. With a $6 tip it's $22 for an excellent all you can eat Brazilian lunch. You can't get a buffet on the strip for this amount, nor most fast food joints in the mall.  Amazon locals is an excellent site you ought to get emails from. They often have coupons for sale for this place. They often cost $4 for the $25 coupon. Which still would make your bill only $20.22 for two of you.  I believe the restaurant is in a crap location, this is why it has to do so many promotions in many areas. It's in the mile of shops at Planet Hollywood, kind of at the back of a row of restaurants on the north side of the mall  by the rainstorm mess of a show.  Now to the food. Salad bar is at the back of the restaurant and kinda tight, but the food is awesome. My boyfriend loved the marinated carrots. I love the large meatball sized mozzerella balls and salads. The meats come out on skewers from the staff who are often and many. I would say there are seven or eight different things on a regular rotation; pineapple, bacon wrapped chicken & sausage, flank steak, BBQ pork, sirloin steak (my favorite) chicken legs (pretty large too) and I think there's something else that I can't remember. Any way, we have never been disappointed with the food. If the meat comes out too raw, just ask your server to get it cooked more. I hate it when I read on here that the food came out to rare. I like it that way, but my boyfriend doesn't, so we always ask for a better cooked piece of the steak and they come right back with it. Just ask people, don't wine if you can't be bothered to open your mouth and ask.  I think this place goes through a tonn of staff as we have been 10 weeks in a row and never had the same wait person twice. However, they are all good and attentive. Never had a problem with the food or the staff. Will continue to frequent this place every week until we get bored with it....which will be never.",

All you can eat served meats. We got up and walked around. Not one person was serving ANY beef for almost 20 minutes. I asked the waiter. Who also was hard to find. We came to the conclusion they want you to eat salad bar. Even with the discount, 30$ for salad, 2 bucks for TAP WATER, 3.50$ for ice tea, which we had to beg for refills.  Overpriced for such hard to get product. Service is mediocre to poor. Food is good. Service is poor.",

    "text": "Gullible tourists and the high traffic location are the only things that are keeping this place in business. I bought a special Groupon to use here and even with the discount I found it overpriced, the service horrendous and the food awful. This place is a RIP OFF. If you've been to ANY other Brazilian steakhouses, then you've had better food than this place.   Let's start with the abysmal salad bar. Other places (Fogo de Chao, Texas de Brazil) have pretty high quality goods on their bar, but not Pampas. It was filled with the cheapest salad bar ingredients possible. No asparagus, no artichoke hearts, no high quality cheeses, just a bunch of junk. Even the salad bar at Golden Corral is better! The little cheese biscuits were tasty but that's it. Sure, their gimmick is that it's \"unlimited,\" but so what when there is nothing you actually WANT to eat!?!  The rodizio food was even worse. We had a special deal to add the \"Ultimate Surf and Turf\" seafood option. This was a COMPLETE JOKE. I expected fresh shrimp on skewers but nope, we were served a teeny salad sized plate with two small pieces of salmon, a small portion of mussels and 4 (yes, FOUR!!!) pitiful looking unshelled shrimp. That's it. The seafood was pretty bad and I have never felt so ripped off. They have the gall to charge $58.00 PER PERSON for this junk!   The service was so awful. I realize the place was inexplicably packed on a Friday night, but there were plenty of waiters around so there's really no excuse. We had to wait for water refills and even for forks! The guys bringing around the skewers weren't knowledgeable about anything they were serving. We kept asking about the sausage and he would only say \"it's sausage,\" though the menu mentions there are several different kinds being served. He had no idea what kind of meat he had either! WTF? Poor staff training!   One of my friends skipped on the all you can eat and ordered a steak a la carte from the menu. It was obvious our waiter forgot to put in his order because we had to ask FOUR TIMES where his missing meal was. Finally it arrived with zero apologies. Some weird looking guy who looked like he was an Elvis impersonator at his second job appeared to be the manager but he was just standing around and never even came over to our table.   You have been warned. This place sucks.",

Although, I've been to many Brazilian Steakhouses in San Diego and on Cruises, this one was not my favorite. Let's start off with the service. It was super slow. The waiters seemed stretched thin and/or inexperienced. We waited about 10 minutes to be greeted and only the bus person came to our table to fill our water glass (More on that in a minute). She advised us that the server will be with us soon. The server finally came and took our drink orders. He explained how the buffet works and we all got started. The gauchos started coming with their specialty meats however some were meats repeated and others very seldom came out. The meat temp was too rare for most (although I was alright with it) or it was over cooked and dry. The buffet was delicious and everything was kept at a perfect temperature and clean. During our meal, we saw our server about twice and when it came time to get the bill, it took forever. Now remember the water they served us? It's a specialty bottled water. They don't tell you that they are charging you for that but it shows up on the bill! That's a deceiving practice.",

The only thing that was good was the watermelon and honeydew. But we could had paid way less then $100 for that somewhere else. Honestly, we could have had a better buffet line and better quality food at The Rio buffet. Absolutely do not recommend!   I don't only say that on behalf of my husband and I but also from the two guest sitting next to us. We bumped into them on the walk back to our resorts and would never go back. They added oysters and nothing compared to what they get in their home state.   Again don't waste your money! Go experience Brazilian food at a real authentic Brazilian restaurant.",

    "text": "I'm writing this review as I eat this very sad dinner in the middle of Pampas :(  Very tough, dry meat :( Every single piece of meat -- chicken wrapped in bacon, pork loin, filet mignon wrapped in bacon, tritip, pork sausage, etc -- is just plain dry. Even the chicken in the tortilla soup is somehow dry! I can't concentrate on anything else.   The salad bar is pretty lacking, too. The hot choices are lukewarm in temperature and taste. The pasta of the day was penne with slices of squash, but I have no idea what the sauce was or if there was one. I do like the cheese bread, but they'd be so much better served hot instead of wasting away in a buffet tray.  Pampas does seem pretty tech-savvy, which is nice. I like how you can make reservations directly through Yelp. You can get a free dessert if you write a review with a picture, and Pokemon Go players can get a free bottle of wine if they check in through Yelp and put a lure module on the nearest Pokestop. I can't reach the Pokestop from where they seated us, though, so we had to skip that.   Also, all of the Gauchos keep reaching over the table to give each of us pieces of meat, sticking their swords and knives in our faces in the process. Your arms aren't that long, dude. Walk around the table.  PS we just got our bill, and it turns out the Water Conservation charge for glasses of water wasn't a hilarious joke. It is Very Real.",

I know they're busy, and that's great for them, but it's loud and noisy and there's not enough space between tables to walk and not enough servers to handle the crowds.    Just about all the meats brought to our table were over cooked and most were over salted.   The quality level of the meats wasn't on par with what they charge.    The \"filet\" was not anywhere close to filet mignon.   The choices on the salad and soup bar were quite underwhelming in variety and quality compared to most of the other brazilian steakhouses I've been to.    Really no reason to go here except if you want to gorge yourself on many pounds of meat without leaving your chair, there's so many other better  choices for an all you can eat meal in Las Vegas.

October 2017 review  We had no service what so ever. The Food was subpar and lacking flavor.   We were there for a birthday and they sat us in a private room which you think would have been amazing. In reality, we were forgotten about in that room and didn't get the whole service that we were supposed to Poor poor service from EVERYONE in the restaurant.  June 2018 We decided to give it another try. We showed up at our reserved time and were seated right away. The place was busy, I was excited.  As soon as our server took our drink order the food started flowing. We were served every single meat in the first five minutes which was just fine for us.   The flavors were ahhhhhmazing! The steak had those crispy bits from the cooking on it and I couldn't get enough of that red meat!!   The fish plate has been changed and I liked the change, all except for the fried fish pieces, those weren't so great.   The salad bar was kind of meh. I've seen them do better with that but I do love their cheese bread. One of my favs.   The drinks were great, I started with the specialty and ended with white sangria. The white sangria was my favorite.   Once we were served in the beginning, the guys serving the meat started to thin out.  Our server then was no where to be found. It took almost a half hour to get our check.   I wanted to give this a better review as the food and some parts of this place has gotten exceptionally better. Seeing as how my first review would have been 1 Star, I bumped it up to 3 stars.  The manager reached out to me regarding my review. I emailed him detailing my full experience. He has since not reached back out to me or tried so contact me in any way.",

We had an 11:30am reservation and were the second group seated for lunch.  We were seated in a really cool private room that looked like a wine cellar with glass walls.  We discovered right away that even though the room appeared to be great, it was probably the worst place to sit in the whole restaurant.  We waited and waited for our server who never came.  One of our group stopped another server and asked them to find our server and send them over.  A manager heard the conversation and stepped in to help.  At this point we found out that the bartender was supposed to be our server - which did not work well as she was busy making the drinks for all the tables.    Once we gave our drink orders to the manager we went to get our salads.  Upon return to the table our second issue started.  None of the 'carvers' were stopping to come into our room with any of the meats as they passed by.  We could see them walk by, but no one stopped.  When the manager returned to check on us we told her and she went to find them to send them over.  After that we got plenty of chicken and sausage, but still none of the other carved meats.   Eventually word got out that we were not being served and they started to come by, but by that time we were all getting full.  We had had salad and a couple of meat choices and then sat for a long while - so our tummy's were done for.  I think this would probably be a nice place to eat, but DO NOT allow them to seat you in a private room.",

Our server was very polite and professional but it looked like he was overwhelmed with work. We waited about 25 min before anybody came to offer us the many different meat cuts. I have been to many different Brazilian Steakhouses and so I know what good quality meat is. I was Disappointed in Pampas. The meat quality was by far bad and the seasoning was either to light or too strong, some of the chicken was completely burned (charred) while some of the beef was very rare, so rare to the point where I was afraid to eat it because I did not want to get sick. It was so rare I could hear it screaming  . I will give Credit to the manager on duty, after 25 minutes of not being served any meat, I did notify the manager and she did come back, apologized and brought a plate of different types of meat which was very nice of her. My wife really enjoyed Argentinian-Paraguayan Chipas (Cheese Bread or pan de queijo in Portuguese) and the Argentinian chimichurri sauce. I paid 120 dolllars plus tip and it was definitely not worth it, will not eat here again.",

We were seated almost immediately in the bar area and were given the run down. The drinks were good, but I can't say the same for the salad bar or meats offered. The salad bar is small and doesn't offer many options. The steak options were almost all overcooked. I am used to the non steak options not being so good, but they were better than the steak. Also, there was a token on the table that alerts the gauchos on whether or not you want served - and none of them noticed this. They also only have like, 7 different kinds of meat in all.  We decided to give this place a second try, and after having to ask for almost a half hour for pineapple, they finally brought it over. We told the gauchos multiple times that we were only waiting for that, but they kept coming and offering other items instead. I really don't think I'd come back to this place.",

    "text": "*** it's a pity I didn't read the other reviews for this place before dining here, as so many people have had similar experiences***  Checked out this place because we had a BOGO coupon... or what we thought was a bogo, as the coupon was very misleading. I have attached the type of coupon to this post for reference. The coupon makes it look like you're getting the steak & endless shrimp dinner for  ~$40+ for 2 people. However, what you are getting is a discount on the normally priced $85 meal + you must buy drinks to use the coupon. Either way... I cannot imagine paying $85 per person at this restaurant!!    Onto our endless shrimp and steak dinner experience:  The \"endless\" shrimp i.e. 2 small plates of shrimp. We got our first small plate of about 10 cold shrimp right as we got back from our first round at the salad bar, ate that real quick. the first batch was alright, okay seasoning. However, it was never replenished/asked about refill for about 30 minutes. At that point, I had asked our server for another plate of shrimp. He said \"sure, let me take your plates, so you guys can start fresh at the salad bar... we'll have the shrimp out by the time you guys come back.\" Okay.. we go back to the salad bar, I asked someone to refill the cheese bread station, as there were only 2 cold, hard ones left; also had to mention that the warmer for the bread wasn't on (which they then switched back on)... welp, the fresh ones weren't any better anyway.  We come back to the table, shrimp wasn't there yet AND our table had been completely cleared, including our drinks (which were not empty) and silverware. We got our silverware and drinks back (finding out later that they had charged again for the drinks that THEY cleared!!). We ate our salad bar pickings and began our wait for our endless shrimp and meat...  We sat there for 45 minutes, without having been served any meat, despite having our card on \"green.\" In that time, we watched as a food runner dropped a piece of meat on a lady's leg; he just apologized as he quickly hurried off, leaving her husband to wipe down her leg with his napkin. At some point I asked our server again for the shrimp, he was surprised that they didn't bring it out and said he'd get them for us after taking care of our neighboring guests. He brought back the second and last plate of endless shrimp and I asked for the check. That second batch of shrimp not good, no seasoning, no flavor. We ate 2 shrimps each and didn't finish the rest.  There was no organization with how the food runners were going about the tables. They would walk through our row, straight to the back, not stopping at us or our neighboring tables (we all had the same astonished looks on our faces). Some food runners would even glance down at the green card, but notice that the people were not looking at them or were chatting amongst themselves, but didn't stop to ask them if they wanted any meat -- this happened multiple times to multiple tables, including us.  In the 2 hours we were there, we were offered meat/skewers no more than 10 times, 5 of those being meats we decided to try and 2 of the rounds being of their grilled pineapple skewers.. and these offerings only occurred within the first 20 minutes of us sitting down... the rest of the time we were there, no more offerings.  During those 5 times we did get meat: When the sausage skewer came by, I got the most charred piece of sausage, runner didn't even think twice about what part of the meat I was getting, just quickly slid it onto my plate and walked off. Taste-wise, the food - the very limited amount that we got to try - was very mediocre.  Don't waste your time or money coming here... Check out Texas de Brazil at Town Square, less than 2 miles away and essentially off the strip. You'll have a much better time!",

Second they put one bottle of water on your table e start to put the water in your cup, and after they tell you the water is 1$!  The food doesnt taste like brasilian food!  And the rodizio with meat, we can count how many pieces we ate!  They go into your table, and cut the meat in front of you, The Service for the meat was very, very slow!  The nice thing, the meat taste good! But its not the place that I plan to go Back!",

The cold food and sides bar was very skimpy, and, like many others here, we found the meat to be dry, overcooked and lacking in seasoning.

    "text": "Ever since moving to Las Vegas from the East Coast, I've learned to avoid the Strip and Fremont street as passionately as AB avoids a quiet existence in the NFL. That being said, Pampas is pretty much one of the dining establishments that make me brave the Strip.  Service is impeccable at Pampas, no matter how crazy the lunch or dinner rush. While I'm also a fan of Texas de Brazil and Fogo de Chao (my all-time favourite churrascaria chain, from all the way during my Boston days) and think their food are top-notch, the reason why my mom and I frequent Pampas more often is the service; we don't ever feel like we have to flag down the gauchos or any of the dining staff. They're attentive without being very hovercraft-y.  If any of y'all are in the evening rush, make sure to look for Trevon, Brooks, Ray, and the amazing gaucho with facial hair... Totally forgot to ask his name, but he's the short Hispanic man with facial hair who's on point in making sure you are not left without succulent slices of meat or pineapples.  TL; DR. My friends and I may lovingly dub ourselves \"The Hangry Social Workers,\" but over at Pampas, \"Hangry\" becomes \"Happy with cheese bread and picanha in our bellies\"!",

From receptionist down to table servers. Upon arrival, it's obvious my son's sleeping in his stroller, yet receptionist asked if I can take my son off his stroller. Of course I said no. I thought there wasn't room for it, but no! They have private rooms where we could have been seated away from passerby. You might say that they weren't using the rooms, they were! There were kids inside too. Then, we still stayed to have a nice lunch. Our server Carlos, very unprofessional! Not only did he ignored us the whole time we were there. I asked for a soda fill and did not even bother to do so until I threw a fit about it. I asked for our check and he literally walked by multiple times and ignored us, until my husband had to get his attention and raised his voice. We're very disappointed with the service. The food was good, but will not come back due to really bad service. Do yourself a favor and pay the extra bucks and go somewhere else.",

We're from Denver and we have awesome 4-5 star Brazilian restaurants there, but the compete here is to be had! They win in my opinion because they also have a groupon! The filet mignon had a Parmesan crust & it was just so so good. The only thing was the chicken was dry-ish.

The salad bar was good but it wasn't outstanding. The meat was a hit or miss. It was either rare or very well done. Most of what we were able to get was tough and chewy. We were also left waiting for long periods of time for meat to come to the table. For a second, I thought maybe we had our card flipped to red but it was indeed on the green side and yet, no meat was coming to us. I munched mostly on the shrimp since that was already at the table.  We shared some cheesecake for dessert. It was just ok. Not very smooth like other cheesecake I'm used to.  Pampas needs to work on customer service and not burning their meats. Not a fan at all.",

My wife can't eat pork due to allergies so she waited on the beef. Now, the pork and chicken I had was good and seemed done as I expected. The top sirloin was fatty and tough, another cut way under done, and the filet was overdone and not very good. To top that, we all got sick over night and this was the only common thing we ate. Had to cancel our Grand Canyon trip (lost that $$). We talked to the folks next to us, and had the same results with service.  Stay away.",

I ordered sirloin medium rare entree and expected it to come out on a plate with a full piece of meat. NOPE! They did the Brazilian style and brought the sword of meat over. Three thin slices were cut out. I was really disappointed! In addition, it was rare. The chance of me coming back here is thin like the slice of meat I got.",

    "text": "I ended up at Pampas after attending a show in Vegas with a \"free\" dinner option included. If it's free, maybe go for the salad bar. Otherwise, I would SKIP ENTIRELY. There's much better food in Vegas than Pampas, and Pampas seemed somewhat gimmicky to me. I think their branded as a Brazilian steakhouse, which triggers the idea of lots of meat. But they are far from that.   We were offered a choice of sirloin, chicken legs or salmon, along with the salad bar (which includes some hot options too). I chose the salmon and was quite disappointed when it came out looking less than fulfilling. The sauce for the salmon was very good; however, the portion size is very small and the salmon was not very tasty on its own.   And from what I understand from a person in my party, the chicken \"legs\" (which looked more like chopped thighs or breasts) were extremely dry. In fact, she called them \"chicken pucks\" like hockey pucks. Ooooh boy. Given the small portion sizes of the meat, I expected that they would be cooked much better.   The salad bar was sufficient -- enough to make a filling, colorful salad (and also have soup, pastas, mashed potatoes, etc). The sauteed kale was also good. The Brazilian Lemonade ($6.95) is excellent.  Overall, I felt somewhat scammed eating at this place. It's very clear that they really expect you to get full from the salad bar (which in theory may be okay but felt deceptive).",

    "text": "First time here.  This place had good cheese bread.   LOVED, LOVED, LOVED the cheese bread.  However I wasn't as impressed with the salad bar.  The fruit, and the olives tasted great.  All the other items were bland.  This is supposed to be Brazilian food so I expected more flavor & seasonings in the food & meat.    The meat was just ok too.  It tasted good but not as flavorful as other Brazilian food I've had at other restaurants.  The staff will come around to your table every few minutes serving you meat such as chicken,  sausages, beef, & lamb.  We also had the Brazilian lemonade which was very tasty & frothy.  We had a voucher for 50% off dinner and got a pitcher of sangria.  This was good too but the alcohol content was a little low. I wish it was stronger.  Our total cost was under $75 for 2 people.  The environment was beautiful, softly lit, and romantic.  Our waiter was good.  However some of the staff bringing out the meat didn't pay attention to our, \"stop serving meat\" card when we wanted to slow down from eating.  That got to be a little annoying since we were trying to have a romantic conversation.  Lastly I personally didn't like the photographer taking photos without informing us they were to purchase. When we sat down a lovely woman who works there asked to take our photo.  We said yes not knowing what's ahead.  Then she walked away without saying anything.  She came back later with two photos printed out with Vegas cardboard frames.  Then asked if we wanted to purchase one for $20.  We said no. Then she offered another deal and we said no.  Finally she offered both photos for $10 without the frames, and we said no.  Please be aware of this if you don't plan to purchase.  It felt like a setup and didn't like this inside the restaurant.  It would had been better just letting us know up front.  The photos were beautiful though.   Overall the place was ok but probably wont go back since there's many choices to try & choose from in Vegas.",

All kinds like expensive steakhouses, or regular family like olive garden,  and even counting places like Taco Bell and McDonald's. This place is probably ranked in the worst ten when it comes to food that i have ever been to. All the cuts were so tough and flavorless.  The worst 100 bucks i ever spent. The only food I liked was the salad. There's alot i can add, but I don't want to waste your time and mine.",

The steak for the proteins was paper thin and with both proteins this equates to probably 4 bites total. The salads were decent but everything else such as pastas from the market bar were extremely bland and low quality. I'd recommend staying away from this restaurant.",

    "text": "I pretty much agree with most other reviewers.  It's a solid three.  We really enjoy Brazilian steakhouses and have been lucky to visit them occasionally for about twenty years.  We enjoyed the food.  I always love the syrup coated plantains and salad bar.  The salad bar here had less variety than I was used to, but had some solid favorites.  The fresh fruit and veggies were good.  I like the mashed potatoes.  Not many prepared salads but the chick pea salad was good.  A bit of overkill on the cold pasta in my opinion.  The meat was good and the meat servers were super friendly.  We didn't see them too often but I think it may have been our table  location.... we were kind of out of the way in a nook near the front entrance.  We never did get our seafood platter.  We're still waiting.  Is it ready yet?  We gave that up for lost and did end up ordering dessert.  That was the best part of the experience.  The mousse and flan were GREAT!  We had one waiter take our order and then never saw him again.  Another one sort of took over I guess, and he was nice enough... but no one person seemed to be really monitoring our table.    So I guess the experience was a bit disjointed??  I'd go again though because Brazilian food is just amazing.",

    "text": "I got a free $57 dinner here Oct 2018 as part of my gifts for attending a vacation club presentation.  I also got a free show.  If you wanna get these gifts and free lunch (just prepackaged sandwiches, chips, popcorn), go through the west-facing entrance (on Las Vegas Blvd) of Miracle Mile shopping center and right inside the entrance is a horseshoe counter in the center, displaying posters of various LV shows.  That counter will sign you up for a vacation presentation where one of the things you get is a dinner here at Pampas.  But this was Oct 2018, not sure about \"today\" when you are reading this.    I tried to cut the presentation short, but the saleswoman insisted on showing me a suite for 8, when I told her alone is all I know and it would just make me so sad that I had no one to share it with.  I yelled, \"GET ME OUTTA here!!  It makes me sad.   I just want my gifts !\", in front of other people who were being shown the suite.  She GOT IT !  She hurried me outta there.  Cost me 2 hours at the presentation, but I still think it is worth the free show and Pampas dinner.  I ate my Pampas dinner alone, cos remember, alone is all I know.  I sat at the bar at first, cos they didn't have a table for me.  Anyhow the meat Pampas brought around to my seat, was not rare enough for me but when I said so, the servers told me they would be back with meat cooked the way I liked it.  And they DID remember me.  So I think the service was 5 stars.  But some of the meats like chicken, were overcooked and dry, except the lamb.  Even rare was not that chewable, and had gristle and things I spit out.   The thing I liked the most about eating all the meats was the chimichurri sauce.  I LOVE chimichurri sauce.  I had them bring me that in a BOWL.    I didn't find the salad bar very appealing.  Only thing I liked and ate from it was the beets and the hearts of palm.  That's OK, I don't go to a meat buffet to eat \"salad\".     I read the reviews about the charge for the water bottles, and told them I didn't want \"those bottles\".  The bartender gave me free water in a small cup.  He also gave me tastes of drinks I was asking \"what was that\", but I don't remember what \"that\" was now.    I found the waste at other tables appalling.  I talked to the couple at the next table (we were about 2 feet away).  They paid extra money to upgrade to seafood offerings.  They had a bowl full of large shrimp.  that bowl stayed uneaten and full for the duration of their dinner.  When they got their jacket and things to leave the table, I said \"I can't believe you are leaving that bowl full of jumbo shrimp\".  They said, \"we are just too full !\"   Then someone came to clean up their table right away, and stacked the shrimp on the tray with other dirty dishes to be thrown away.  I spent 3 hours eating here, and left my server a $10 tip.   I would come back again.  My rating is 3.5 stars.",

The chili was the meatiest chili I have ever had. It was a favorite for my husband. The tomato salad with roasted garlic was so good!   At first our table kept getting missed when the carvers were coming around but our waiter corrected that right away and we were able to sample all 12 of the carvings including the roasted pineapple!

The food, from the salad bar to the meat, was bland, and poorly cooked. Our server was non-existent but for twice during our \"dining\" experience. This place gives a bad name to Brazilian steakhouses, and my husband and I have been to very many in our day. First time in Vegas, and first and last time at this hack of a restaurant. Overall, I would give it an (F-).",

Ps they have an incredible salad bar but the server stated when we sat down that we shouldn't waste our time with it. I did anyway and have 0 regrets. I have never enjoyed braised kale so much.   I went here last night with a group of about 20 people. We ordered the meat buffet (all you can eat) and bottomless drinks, which is always awesome.   We were served by a lovely gentleman who was quite attentive and considerate. I left there full and satisfied with my experience.   At one point we had a few lovely ladies (I only caught one name: Carla) bring us a traditional Brazilian drink which to me tasted like a raspberry daiquiri. It was really, really, delicious.  Clean atmosphere, nice people, delicious food (fillet minion wrapped in bacon anyone?) I would def come here again.",

We came for lunch today since we had a 100$ comp from a time share presentation and it was for our anniversary. My wife and I both got the surf and turf, an yes where the salad bar lacked they made up for their main food. We loved all the meat, never had Bacon wrapped chicken but it was awesome, best sausage ever!   The sea food was a little small portioned but after we finished the first dish the waiter asked us what fish we liked the most and brought us those, the only one we didn't like was the swordfish, I never tried it before an was a little fishy. Loved the salmon, shrimp and crab cakes.   The servers were non-stop! Our plates were never empty. Their passion tea was great! The manager came over to check on us and to refill our drinks for us (which I feel more personal when the managers take care of you like they're a server).   For dessert my wife had the Tiramisu and I had the Cheesecake, which neither of us could finish cause they were so big!",

Delicious cuts of meat coming around and around and back around. We order the unlimited drinks so the bartender set up a bar right at our table and that was bananas. Double fisting drinks left and right like there was no tomorrow.  The only flaw to this spot was the salad bar- the options were limited. All in all Tho great experience!",

The service was great, the waitress that we had was very attentive and made sure that we had what we needed to be comfortable.   There were a couple of things I didn't like about Pampas; first, someone from the restaurant offered to take a \"complimentary\" picture of us. We agreed and ten minutes later she came back out and gave us a small picture with a 10% off our next meal discount. That wasn't the bad part - she also brought out two larger pictures, one with a Vegas themed border and one without for a price...what is this!? I just wanted to eat at your restaurant, I didn't want to be sucked into a sales ploy...  Second, I ordered the salmon sandwich with ceasar salad and it was TERRIBLE. There was NO flavor, the bun was dripping with grease and the cheese was so thick I almost chocked on it. The ceasar salad did not taste like a ceasar salad at all! In fact the only thing I could taste was lettuce and the fake parmesan cheese that it was doused in. Not only that but an hour later I was feeling sick wondering if I was going to vomit or not. My husband had the steak sandwich and the steak was tough, there was NO flavor and again the cheese was incredibly thick.   Would I go back? No. There's too many options that are 100 times better than this for half the price in a five mile radius alone.",

We LOVE Brazilian steakhouse and eat it pretty regularly (Fogo in Beverly Hills, Samba in Redondo Beach, Greenfield in Long Beach/Covina, Texas de Brazil in Dallas and Las Vegas) so we know what good Brazilian steakhouse is.   Cons: We waited for a long time for meat.  There were few meat choices (beef, chicken, pork .... no lamb).  The meat was not of a good quality (was coarse or rubbery).  The meat was not flavored well.  The salad bar did not have many options.  The salad bar ran out of bananas midway through lunch service.  The pineapple was not carmelized.   Pros: Our server was AMAZING (moved tables to make our large group fit, asked if we needed a high chair, was patient with the kids).  When requested, the guachos brought meat cooked as requested.  All servers were helpful and no one said, \"You're not my table\".   Guachos would walk by us without offering meat and when they did offer it, they sometimes didn't say what kind of meat it was or wait to be invited to plate it. Some in our party did eat pork and some didn't. If you don't eat pork you will have few options. Even with a Groupon we didn't leave satisfied. I would not return.",

Filet mignon, salmon, these foods are meant to be cooked medium but they cook them all well done making them rubbery and chewy. Don't fall for the voucher scam from bluegreen vacations.

Some of the meats of course were better than others unfortunately by the time you realized this they were gone and you had to wait until the next pass with it but none failed please.

    "text": "I purchased the recent Groupon for the 2-for-1 Surf & Turf dinner, before reading the reviews.  After reading many of the recent negative reviews, I was worried that I had just wasted $46.  Turns out I had nothing to worry about.  We arrived about 15 minutes late for our 8PM reservation, but had called once I realized that we were going to be late.  The hostess told us that reservations were having to wait about 10 minutes, so we stood in the lobby for a while until a couple chairs were vacated, sat down, and shortly afterwards we were seated at our table.  I explained to the server that we had the Groupon and he looked at it, and told us we made the best choice on the menu, and explained how things worked.  We received excellent service throughout the meal - attentive, polite, respectful.  Towards the end, when we were obviously stuffed, our served asked me if there was anything else I wanted.  I requested one more serving of the Chinese pork, which appeared about thirty seconds later.  Here's an attempt to list everything we were offered:  Shrimp and bacon wrapped scallops Three different kinds of beef, including bacon wrapped filet Salmon and Shark Chinese style pork Grilled chicken Ham Pineapple Turkey wrapped in bacon  We also enjoyed the salad bar - not exceptional, but definitely serviceable, and a very wide selection of items.  I might have had higher expectations had we paid full price, but for $23 per person for the food, I would go again and again.  At full price, it would be a once per year visit, as there are just too many other good restaurants at that price point.  Paid $23 for our drinks and left $22 on what would have been a $110 bill w/o the Groupon.",

The meats were average and they didn't come around to our table as often as others, and the salad bar was a joke. It felt like cafeteria food. They claim to be a True Brazilian steakhouse, but all the main Brazilian fare was so underwhelming.   What was most disappointing was the service. I can get over the bad food, but the service ruined the entire night. We were seated in the center section and there was only one server working the entire thing...there had to be at least 15 tables she was serving. It took 35 minutes just to get our check and no one even asked about our experience.   My advice: spend a little extra money and go to Texas De Brazil!!!",

I asked if I could substitute a different cocktail than one of their signature cocktails and just pay the difference.  Eric said absolutely and didn't even charge me the additional amount. Salad bar was full and fresh lots of variety.  When we came back to our table after hitting the salad bar, their was a plate of salmon, clams, peel and eat shrimp, and halibut waiting for us.  The gentlemen came around with the skewers of meat about every 5-10 minutes, which we felt was timed about perfectly. When we were finished and ready for dessert Eric  brought out a beautiful dessert display: we were offered chocolate mousse, cheesecake, tiramisu, or flan.  We opted for the chocolate mousse and were not left disappointed.    I will definitely eat here on my next Las Vegas trip.",

The cost was $38.99 for the Rodizio.  I ordered a grilled season chicken and fries for $28.99 that was good, but way too much food.  Which was the problem.  They don't keep a close eye on you here.  I was eating the extra meat from my friends extra plate the entire time waiting for my chicken.  By the time it arrived, I was full!  I should've not used the coupon and ordered an appetizer and snacked on the filet mignon coming around all night!  The meats were excellent as far as taste and presentation: I really enjoy them coming to the table with freshly grilled meat.

I came a little late, but it is all you can eat so I wouldn't miss much.  The selection of meats they had were pretty limited compared to the other places I have been to.  I stayed away from the chicken, only because most of the party said that it was \"dry\".  Of course I load up on the bacon wrap chicken and sausages.  That was probably one of the alright item to eat.  I am sadden to say that the signature meat was over cooked and also dry.  Then I gave it another try when the gentlemen came out with a new batch, much better.  I would probably say that the grill master in the back needs to be more attentive to the meat they are cooking.  The salad bar was impressive with a huge selection of things to go along with the meat.  I like the fried bananas; probably the one thing I grabbed a plate of. The group seem to enjoyed the pineapple they had, but I had one and passed after.  They just grilled the pineapple up and there wasn't anything special about it.  The other place I have been to had a pineapple grilled with cinnimon and sugar which made it sweet.  Here it was sour.  The service was wonderful up until when we started to slow down and they all vanished.  My cup was empty and was wondering if any other meats were going to make their way back out.  My group was done so I didn't want to be the only one left sitting and eating so I decided to leave as well.   Overrall, I don't think I will come back.  For the price, I rather hit up a buffet.",

We had the Lunch Surf and Turf Special. The first seafood (Surf) platter was not edible, cold and fishy. Our waitress did got us another plate after I told her it was horrible. They do not serve scallops any more even though it is on the menu. Salad bar sure is not as good as used to be.  The only good item for \"Turf\" was Sirloin roast, everything else was either dry, tough, or salty (or all of the above).",

    "text": "We came here for an early lunch (11:30, right when they opened) and didn't eat for 3 days. OK, not really, but you have be real careful not to overeat and make yourself sick. I've only been to one other Brazilian BBQ in San Diego and I thought it was definitely better (though it was also $10-$20 more expensive).   The lunch menu has only 7 meats compared to 11 (I think) for dinner. At lunch time, the meats were pretty fresh and none were overcooked. I didn't try the seafood so I can't say if its any good. If there's insufficient turnover, I could easily see how some of the other diners experienced overcooked or dried out meats.   The BBQ Chicken and Spicy Chicken were both great and normally, I don't really care for chicken. I could do without the bacon-wrapped turkey, but I've never been a fan of bacon-wrapped anything. Just give me the bacon.   I will say the salad bar is a bit on the \"light\" side. I've been to a similar place in San Diego ($50/person for dinner) and the bar was twice the size. The mozzarella and tomato \"salad\" was OK, but not great. I'd say the deli counter at Von's/Safeway is better.   Service was pretty good. The waiter explained the process pretty clearly and made sure our drinks were kept full and plates bussed without being intrusive.   Authenticity? No clue. Ask a Brazilian.   Herbivores need not apply.",

We signed up for discounted dinner through \"tix4tonight\" and made 7:30 reservation. [The discounted dinner is the only way to go here]  We arrived at 7:20 and proceeded to watch as people without reservations could end up going in before those with reservations. We were told 20-30 minutes and ended up waiting 50 minutes. They have a system that is as follows: \"One table is filled with a reservation, then the next table is filled by someone without a reservation - We want to keep it fair!\"  The food was just okay. I have had better. They don't have ANY chimichurra sauce. NONE.   The salad bar is a joke. The fried bananas were sort of gross.   The \"bacon wrapped turkey\" is a piece of jenny-o pressed turkey meat, like you'd make a sandwich with. It is chopped in cube shape and wrapped with bacon. It retains a lot of moisture. It was not \"good eats\"  The sausage was dropped on my plate even though I said \"NO!\" It didn't look appetizing.   The servers are friendly. The place itself is nicely decorated. But, there is much better food available in Vegas for your dollar.",

First they have a great marketing team that is constantly advertising all around the strip to bring people in which I have a lot of respect for because it's got to be tough opening a new restaurant in Vegas (well relatively new) and I'm in marketing so I know it's tough to get your name put there and they do a great job.  Secondly and most importantly the food is so savory and delicious it practically melts in your mouth. I literally wish I had time to stay there all day and just eat meat and drink wine in True hedonistic style. Definitely try everything if you can!!  When my group went we were about 3/4 through our Meal when a nice gentlemen named Bill came over and starting chatting with us and told us a nice little anecdote about the yes lease no thank you signs on the table. He had us rolling on the floor we were laughing so hard and it turned out he was the owner and then proceeded to give us 5$ off our next bottle of wine!  All and all definitely a 5 star experience every time I've been there and I can't wait to go again next time I'm in Vegas. Thanks Bill and to our fabulous waitress and meat servers as well!",

Today we were walking among the crowds and took a turn into Planet Hollywood Hotel. It's a really cool place and the have a very nice selection of restaurants. Many of the restaurants were chains that I have been to already and we felt like trying something new so we popped into Pampas Brazilian Grille. The place is really classy and clean and we were seated right away. Our table was right outside in one of the major walkways, near the Harmon entrance so we were able to do some people-watching while we enjoyed our Caipirinha (which were made perfectly!) it's kind of like a mojito but I think it has a bit more of a kick.  Our server Nicole was very polite and we asked her for a recommendation as we had never been to this type of Brazilian Grille before. Nicole gave us a great description of the way they work and suggested we try the Surf & Turf \"Rodizio\". It's an all you can eat salad bar, with an endless supply of seafood and a variety of meats that they bring around to your table on these big skewers. The waiters actually carve off pieces for you right at your table so it's pretty entertaining too. There are a variety of skewered meats that include sirloin, pork loin, sausage and a bacon wrapped chicken that was amazing. My favorite was the skewered ham and the shaved pineapple. Really tasty.  Okay so it's a Brazilian Grille..the parade of meats is incredible but their salad bar totally rocks too! Marinated artichokes, roasted peppers, sliced portabello mushrooms, pasta salad with olives and sliced salami, lamb stew, an assortment of rices, mashed potatoes, seasoned chicken, and tons of other soups and traditional salad bar items. My only suggestion is that you have to bring your A game appetite when you go to Pampas because it is all so good.  Overall the meal, service and experience was excellent.",

We were sat at our reservation time, our waiter walked by and left us sitting for 15 minutes with no water, and I watched him walk by and there were a few empty tables in his section. Finally, a bus boy that I stopped brought us water, and about 10 minutes later my lazy rude waiter came over to ask for drinks. When we ordered he brought us a pitcher of ordered drinks with no glasses, then took 10 minutes to bring us glasses and didn't pour the drinks for us. The food was pretty good, and the guys walking around the skewers were great and fast. Finally, our waiter came back to check on us when the pitcher was gone, and forgot my drink order. Finally, I asked for the bill, we had a voucher from the place we were staying and he brought me the receipt that $45 wasn't covered, and tip was optional-gave him the card back and he gave me a charge for $59 charged on the card. I couldn't find him after 10 minutes and I asked for a manager. When she came over she asked him about the bill and he said he added his 15% gratuity and when I questioned it the manager did nothing. I didn't make a big stink about it just signed and left....That should be illegal for them to tell me one thing and charge another! I totally felt like the waiter was scamming a 2nd tip....he threw away the $45 receipt and brought a new one....I can't believe that! Super wrong! Bottom line, decent food but not worth the price with the other Vegas choices and illegal practices....Don't go! Expect some of the worst service anywhere!",

Our server was fantastic. He was very friendly and explained all aspects of the restaurant from salad bar to Drinks to Dessert and to the meats and how they would be brought to the table.  I have to say the salad bar was just OK, nothing special. But who comes to an all you can eat meat place for the salad.  The meats were good, especially if you got the edge cuts (they had the seasonings on then). Though there was salt and pepper on the table if needed.    I had the Pina Colada, not blended though.  It was very enjoyable.   Desserts were brought to the table and offered.  After all the meats, who had anymore room. There were only 4 to chose from so if you wanted one didn't have to think very hard.  Would I go back?  Only if I was with someone who had never been, otherwise I'll look for a real 'Steakhouse'.",

She was very helpful.   The day of the reception, everything went smooth and we were very impressed. The decorations were done well, and our wedding cake was made in-house and it was a 3-tier cake and was huge. We were very impressed with the cake. We had eaten here previously so we already knew how the food was, but our guests praised them. We had about 60 people.   All in all our reception was done well and I would not hesitate to eat here again or use them for a family gathering/event.",

All the food on the salad bar was outstanding, really fresh and tasty. The seafood was just okay, the shrimp and salmon being the best. The star of the show is the sirloin with the tri-tip a distant second. I didn't really care for the chicken leg or the sausage or the pork. The tiramisu was excellent. For my specialty drink I ordered the Caipirinha on the advice of our waiter. I had seen Anthony Bourdain drink them on No Reservations, it was really good! If we hadn't had a Groupon I'd have given it only 2 stars. I expected all of the meat to be exceptional.",

As we all know, the red top up is suppose to signal the server to keep on going and the green side up asks for service. Apparently these servers cannot read red nor green. Even after seeing the red side up, and then being told no thank you..they served  us anyway. Most of our meat was tough. I also watched other customers fighting with the steak knives trying to cut cut their own. While walking thru this cluttered dining room I had to walk without picking my feet up of the floor. It was so slippery on the tiled portion of the floor that I was scared of falling.  I mentioned it to one of the waiters and his reply was simple..... \"it really hurts when you fall\"!  For $43.00 per person I will find a nice buffet somewhere else. Sorry, there are a lot of good reviews but I do have somewhere to compare it to and would rather drive 250 miles to get there than to come back here. Somebody mentioned Alex the waiter and I agree that he was very good. probably the best part of our experience.",

    "text": "So my husband and I wanted to try out this restaurant and have their lunch menu. The lunch menu and dinner menu were no different except for the price. There was a $20.00 difference, so to beat the dinner traffic and save some money we reached the restaurant hidden in Planet Hollywood right before lunch ended at 4pm. Now mind you this was on a Monday, not a day that fell on a holiday or any special discount days. Just a regular Monday. So we reached the hostess and was relieved there was only a few people there. There is inside seating and somewhat of a patio area still inside the mall area. We planned on ordering the Surf and Turf Rodizio, which is the all you can eat brazillian meats, seafood and with the salad bar. But for some reason this hostess decides to seat us all the way in the backside of the patio and is super far from the salad bar. I look and see there is no one seated at all inside near the salad bar. The last thing I wanted to do was walk 2 miles for the salad bar. So I ask nicely, \"Can we get seats near the salad bar inside\"? She lies and says \"We don't have anything available\".. WTH really? This is my one pet peeve when it comes to restaurants. I hate lying employees. It may have been my hunger getting the best of me but this was not the case. They wanted the restaurant to look like it was busy but screw the facade. I was trying to get my grub on. So we wait for the meat to come around to our table and it seems like a lifetime. The waitress we had was Lizette and she was attentive and courteous. Which is not what I could say for other waitresses who look like they were hating life. The meat finally comes around and my husband gives the sirloin and tri tip the thumbs up. They had the pork which was tough and unedible. The seafood was tasty but the mussels and salmon were bland. The white fish and shrimp were better.They provide you with very small portions for a place that serves all you can eat. More like all we can try.  The salad bar didn't dazzle but it made for fillers for the meat. I recommend the cheese bread. We had no problems with our service going forward but I only made one trip to the salad bar because for me it wasn't worth going back multiple times because they sat us near state lines. I waited for the sausages but by the time they came around we were already full. But as I contemplated the tip at the end of our meal, I decided on the bare minimum of 15%. I also cashed in on our 1 year old <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate (never expires). It will be a while before we go back but not without my running shoes for the salad bar trips of course.",

    "text": "What are some of the biggest tourist attractions in the country? Times Square, Hollywood Blvd, and the Las Vegas Strip. What do they all have in common? Crap food served at chain restaurants. I don't understand why people travel thousands of miles and end up eating at a restaurant that has a location around the corner from their home. While checking out some show tickets we asked one of the employees about some good lunch places that are different than any chain restaurants. It was lunch so we were looking for something cheap, but tasty. The guy told us about a Brazilian restaurant called Pampas that's inside Planet Hollywood.  It's no secret, the hotels on the Strip are massive and act like a maze in order to force you to walk past as many slots, tables, souvenir stands, and other money wasters as possible. It just so happened that Pampas is at the very end of Planet Hollywood. Nice.  We were given coupons for $5 off which includes their salad lunch buffet and the meat rodizio. Normally this is $20 which is pretty cheap, but the coupon makes it even better. Our server gave us a green and red card thing and we were told to flip it to the green side when we get back from the buffet and the meat carvers will start making their rounds to our table.  The \"salad\" buffet was amazing but it didn't have too much salad which is fine with me. There was a few different pastas, vegetables, cheeses, and a couple types of salad. I'm not going to lie though, my favorite thing at the buffet were the squares of feta cheese. I downed at least fifteen of those awesome squares of happiness. Also, they had slices of salami which were fantastic.  I'm not much of a carnivore, but every time one of the meat carvers came over I got extremely happy. The choices included smoked ham, bar-b-q chicken, spicy chicken, bacon wrapped turkey, sausage, bar-b-q pork, and sirloin. The best ones in my opinion were the sirloin and sausage. I couldn't try the bacon wrapped turkey though because of my stupid allergies. Dumb. One other option they had was grilled pineapple which was just as delicious.  This is definitely a restaurant that makes sure your tummy leaves happy. The \"all you can eat\" style usually fails miserably in regards to taste. However, Pampas seemed to excel higher than any other restaurant I've been to of its nature. We were so full when we finished that we all had to sit back and relax for a while before we started walking down the Strip again. I ate so much that I think I heard the chair crack a little before I stood up. Whoops!",

The steak was a bit flavorless and rough (I asked for medium-well). A far as the meal goes, good price, but lacks some flavor. Service was okay. The table and surrounding area was a bit crumby. Overall, save this place for lunch or dinner, unless you really want steak and eggs for breakfast.   BTW, if you stay at the Marriott across the street you get a discount here.",

    "text": "I've been to many brazilian steak houses with rodizio style service and was expecting to have a great experience (since this is Vegas of course). This was not the case. This was the first time I went to a Brazilian steakhouse and had a poor experience.  The meat: The main reason why we went here was to get our meat fix on! It was bad...i mean BAD. The quality of the meat was equivalent of the \"T.G.I. Fridays of Brazilian Steakhouses\". The meat quality was poor and although they offered the piccanha rare or more well done,  everything else was over cooked.  The seasoning on the meat was almost non existent. We were expecting the traditional salty goodness on the outside of the meat with the crusty outside of the meat, but it wasn't there at all. Just overcooked meat with no seasoning. To be honest, the meat even tasted old I kid you not. The brazilian sausage is something I really looked forward to (at other brazilian restaurants as well) and my fiancee and I looked at each other and both thought it was hill shire farms sausage. They say it was made in house on the menu, but seriously, they shouldve saved the time and just bought the hillshire farms sausage from the grocery store right next to where they got their salad bar items.   The salad bar: I kid you not when I say this, but I felt like I walked into a grocery store salad bar. The fried bananas shouldn't really be deep fried with breading on it, its supposed to be in a pan with I assume butter and sugar. The bananas were breaded, but not only that, they were soggy and have definitely been sitting there a LONG time.  The cheese bread are also one of the big reasons why we go there! They were stale and dried out (also have been sitting there) you would assume it would have been fresh since dinner service had just started.  The soups were a disgrace as well. Chicken noodle soup and lentil soup? Really? I don't really know about the lentil soup, but chicken noodle doesn't scream Brazilian to me. Even their competitors Texas De Brazil have lobster bisque!  They even had eggrolls at the salad bar! WTF?! If I wanted egg rolls I wold have gone to a chinese restaurant.  This was unacceptable.  The Service: We waited maybe 5 minutes to be seated, so it wasn't bad. When we did get a table (there were many other tables open) we were pretty much stuck in the corner with no server for about 15 minutes. We were literally looking around to see if they forgot about us! The manager finally realized we were looking around and desperately tried to win us over, pushing the desserts and wine when we haven't even been given any other food or water for that matter. 10 more minutes pass (now 25 minutes after being seated) and our server comes up to us and literally says \"HI my name is David, I will be your server. Please let me know if you need anything and go ahead to the salad bar\" and then quickly walked away to tend to another table.  I suppose I could add this to service, but there was a lady with a \"drink cart\" that was really pressuring us to get the Caipirinha, the Brazilian cocktail. When we said we had them before, she asked oh, you didn't like it? why not? I don't know lady! leave us alone! They really tried pushing alot of extra stuff on us, I suppose it is their job, but damn it made things awkward. The whole drink cart idea was tacky.   The only \"pro\" I can honestly add to this was the $10 coupon they were handing out in front of the restaurant, but even with a combined $20 dollars off  for my fiancee and i, it still wasn't worth it at all.  I would genuinely say save your time and your money and go to Texas De Brazil or Fogo De Chao because even though they are a \"chain\" they know what they are doing service wise, and especially the food (meat!).    I usually write about places that I love, but this restaurant really made me want to go home and warn people about the quality you will be getting. I've been to many brazilian steak houses but this was by far the worst.  Gordon Ramsay if you are reading this, please go to Pampas and tell them whats up!",

The salad bar was standard, there were a few hot sides as well. The meat we got to try was the tri-tip and bacon wrapped chicken as well as pork sausage. There should have been other meats and pineapple, but we didn't ever see those come around. They seated us in the \"patio\" area, so not sure, but maybe they purposely don't serve as well out there. There were 5 full tables out there and everyone wa unhappy with the service. It took 25 minutes for the first meat to actually come around and that was after we had already finished the sides and salad bar... Pretty much a bust at that point. We waited another 20 minutes and then got the chicken and sausage,  pathetic servings were tiny and with the wait on the meat, we would never go back or recommend this place to anyone. We actually asked for a different type of beef, but it never came. Sorry, but the tip we left was equal to the service.",

For the cocktails I ordered the Mojito and the shaken Pina Colada. To me, they were very good and had the perfect strength. To my wife, the critic, they were a little strong. We then went to the salad bar, which is a misnomer, it has everything!!! The mashed potatoes were good, the chicken teriyaki from the salad bar was very good, and the had mushrooms for the steak and mozzarella balls. I also got the chimichurri sauce from there as well. When you get back to the table, there is this wooden thing you turn over from the red side to the green to let them know you are ready for unlimited meats. Plus they bring you a plate with salmon, shrimp, clams, and another fish. The service was fast. I couldn't eat fast enough to make room for the new items as they were coming. That is a good thing. So many meats. The best in my opinion of what I tried was the sirloin. Usually I'm not a sirloin guy, but it was good. My wife's favorite was the shrimp, but she loves seafood. I paid $59 for the Groupon for 2, the bill was a little over a $100 if I didn't have the prepaid Groupon. I don't know if I can say I would pay that without the discount, but it was good for the $59 and $20 tip.",

Seafood dinner (includes: shrimp, bacon wrap scallops, battered fish and grilled salmon) - Shrimp - good - scallops - ok (bacon was chewy) - battered fish - good - grilled salmon - bad (very dry no flavor)   Lamb - good  Filet Mignon in Parmesan cheese - not so good (over cooked in my taste)  Smoked Salmon w/capers - very good  Pasta salad - very good  Tomato/Mozzarella & Basil - Very good  .::Recommendation???::.  I don't know if we caught them on bad night or what. I seemed to prefer the dishes on the salad/appetizer station better than the seafood and meat that I was served. It's a nice restaurant but IMO Espetus in SF had better meat & seafood.",

    "text": "We've visited thew few Brazilian style steak houses in Vegas, and this was hands down the worst of them all. The main reason we decided to try this place is because we had a buy one get one free coupon, which they ended up only honoring $50 of the $58 price. So onto experience. Dinner started off by seating us in the corner of the bar at a table that you'd find in some cheap dive restaurant. The chairs were hard, lopsided, and kept sliding on the slick floor. After being seated we went to the salad bar to start our meal. The variety at the salad bar was meager at best. It included cheese rolls (even though just brought out, I could play baseball with them), mashed potatoes that I could re-stucco my house with, flavorless mozzarella balls, and house dressing so thick it wouldn't slide off the spoon. So sometime in the 10 minutes or so we were up at the salad bar, a plate of mystery fish, salmon, shrimp, and mussels was dropped off at our table. There was 10 shells in the mussel plate, of which 8 were empty. My 2 mussels were not half bad though. The shrimp was still fully shelled including legs, and overcooked making them too tough to enjoy, was like eating rubber. Mystery fish was cold after sitting there so we didn't try it at all. We did try 11 of their meats, but we had to ask for them each time. They regularly brought around the cheaper meats (chicken and pork), but we had to specifically ask for the picanha (the Brazilian grills signature meat) garlic steak, filet wrapped in bacon, etc. The chicken was passable, and the pork sausage was rather good (but I don't come to a Brazilian steak restaurant for its sausage) The best food of the night was definitely the picanha, but it was no where near the best I've had in Vegas. The service was another part of the night that was sub par. Our drinks were constantly empty and we would have to ask twice for things like sugar. We'd ask for certain meats and the waiters would just forget about us, and we'd have to ask 2-3 more waiters to get things to happen. We sat for almost 30 minutes waiting for picanha before we gave up for the night. The wait staff seemed confused as well. They brought special ordered food to our table we didn't order, and we saw them actually placing people's orders on empty tables and the waiters coming back 10-15 mins later and giving the food to the right person. Overall this place was horrible. Even with $50 off our $116 meal I felt like I was ripped off. If you're looking for a nice classy Brazilian all you can eat steak place, check out Via Brasil. We've been there probably 20-30 times, and it's great every time.",

Customer service here was the worst part.  We waited at least 20 minutes for our water that we were charged a \"water surcharge\" for. The waitress seemed very confused.   The seating is very close to the other diners so if they are experiencing problems you know about it.  The people next to us bought a very expensive package and never received most of the perks that went with it.  Mainly the lobster.  The food at the salad bar was just ok. Not worth the price they were charging.   In my opinion, go to Fogo or Texas de Brazil if you want a good Brazilian experience.    Don't waist our time here.",

I was immediately let down from the moment we sat down.  The drinks were extremely watered down.  The meat they served was all overcooked, dry and had either too much garlic flavor or not enough flavor at all. The only meat I had that was good was the spiced chicken.  All the steaks, etc were blah.  The salad bar was ok, but not anything to brag about. Pretty much all I ate was the salad, and the mash potatoes because everything else was meh.  I wouldnt go back and wouldn't recommend this place.  I think you'd find better value and food elsewhere.",

We came in with a reservation late on a saturday night. We were seated right away. We went with the Rodizio which is the all you can eat churrasco with the salad bar. I don't know if it was because it was late at during the night but it wasn't like the place was empty and people were continuing to come in through out our stay. The 'gaucho's' took FOREVER to come out. I mean, they were nowhere in sight.  They finally came by with some filet mignon with parmesan cheese. It was good but nothing special. Interesting flavor but nothing to rave about. They then brought some ham which the bf said was good. I had some brazilian sausage that was good. They kept bringing out the filet mignon and i wanted some picanha, some lamb.... something they did not bring until 45 minutes- 1 hour that we had been there. By that time, appetite was gone. Still tried some of the picanha but it was meh. They also did not ask how we wanted it (medium- medium rare, etc) which is not a requirement but I have always been asked that at churrascarias. Pan de queijo was pretty good, and since the meat took so long, we filled up on that. Good, but not worth a 40+ dollar meal for cheese bread!  Service by our waiter was decent and we came in with a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon which always helps. Still, with so many good options in vegas, I am not coming back.",

We had sirloin, roast beef, turkey wrapped in bacon, chicken, pork loin, lamb.  We also ordered a few orders of grilled lobster and grilled king crab legs. Lobster was great but a bit of trouble getting the meast out of the crab legs.  The sweetness of the grilled whole pineapple complemented the flavor of the bbq. The sides and salad bar were mediocre. I've had better Brazillian sides at other restaurants. Drinks were great.  Sangria had brandy and I was ready to sleep there. They also have traditional Brazilian drinks. Service was great.. They never rushed us even though we spent over two hours there. Bbq servers were very attentive and came quite often.",

Has everything from pasta to mashed potatoes, from boccoccini  salad to veggie tempura! Everything was awesome!  Then there's the meat *drool* so much meat... The pork tenderloin was cooked to perfection, the prawns were buttery goodness, the chicken was moist and flavorful. The sirloin was rare but could be cut with a butter knife! Yummmmm!  Not only was the food awesome, the staff was very good. They were attentive, fast and came around often enough to make you full but not annoyed. Highly recommended!  Just make sure you bring your wallet and your appetite. Expensive, around $28/pp for lunch (i think its $40+ for dinner?) but very, very good.  The only thing that would make this place any better is free WiFi. Then I would never leave! Hint hint, Pampas...",

Price wise not sure it would be worth the full price cost of over $70 (including the peel and eat shrimp) but we had a half off coupon.  I probably wouldnt choose to eat here for brazilian BBQ.  Not nearly as good as mainstays such as Texas de Brazil or Fogo de Chao.",

They seemed a bit short staffed, as we had to wait a while for a drink order from our waiter (thus part of the 4 stars), but other than that a pretty great meal food-wise.    The husband and I both got the \"meat parade,\" aka the salad bar + the traditional Brazillian meat-sliced-at-your-table bit. Good quality of salad bar, they even had choices for the GF types like myself, which was nice. Not a huge selection though, so if you like to pig out on side dishes this place might not be for you. GREAT quality of the meat-parade in terms deliciousness (they offered roast beef well AND medium rare!!), but I do wish there were more types of meat available.  I did eat until I was comfortably full though, and I did wish there was room for more.  Overall a great meal, though I thought it was prices a tad high. Next time I'm in Vegas I probably won't go back.",

    "text": "Please, please, read the other reviews and think about this before you even think about setting foot in this establishment.  All the negative reviews are very True.  If you've been to another Brazilian restaurant, this will be a huge huge disappointment.  To boot, it is overpriced for the food quality and variety -- think about it, if over 50% of the diners have half-off certificates, it's because they're tourists and have never eaten here.  I apologize for being so negative, I usually try to find the good in establishments but there isn't much good here.  The best part of my dining experience was my server, Cynthia (she was absolutely awesome!) and the fried cod (from my seafood option).  Yes, the fried fish was the best part in a Brazilian restaurant.  My experience as a diner started out, on a 105-degree day, of the maitreD insisting on seating me as the 2-person table at the far end of the bar (farthest away from servers too!)-- facing the mall hallway and 100 feet away from the outside doors facing the heat.  When I noticed the heat and sweated immediately, she told me that it was airconditioned (as if it was my imagination).  This was early, too, around 530 p.m. with restaurant 80% empty.  Not only did the meat servers ignore me (being out of the way), but I began sweating even more (hey youre splurging for a supposedly nice meal in a nice restaurant on vacation, that aint right).  I politely asked my server if it was possible to move somewhere cooler and after much discussion with the maitreD (who acted all surprised-shocked that I didnt like my table, doh), they allowed me to move inside where it was 15 degrees cooler at least.  I wish I could say that the dining experience was tremendous free there on.  I really wish.  But other than my server's attentiveness, it was god-awful.  Honestly for what I ordered (the churrascaria with the surf and turf), I would have been better served by dining at a nice casino buffet like Planet Hollywoods for half the price (take the prime rib, carved turkey carved ham plus the middle-eastern meats and add the seafood dishes with the various salads/desserts and it's 10x better).  Specific reasons why I am so negative: 1. Horrible Logistics -- Instead of having 3d red-yellow-green wood that a customer can place on a table to indicate whether he wants servers to bring meat, this restaurant uses plastic decals (smaller than a coaster) that lay flat on the table and cant be seen by servers -- thus they breeze right by you table because they cant see that you want food. 2. Poor Maintenance -- They did something to the floors (extra wax???) whereby people were slipping and sliding as they walked to the salad bar or restrooms, which by the way were kinda nasty. 3. Poor Quality and/or Prepared Food -- which is the main reason a) Iced Tea -- I asked for unsweetened regular iced tea and received a fruity version (which can cause dietary isues) as the original server (in the bar) didnt feel it necessary to tell me (I thought the tea was rotting or going bad based on the unexpected \"flavoring\"). b) Over-Seasoning to mask either the quality or preparation.  Filet mignon that was tasty if you could get by the intense seasoning...after a few bites I couldn't eat it.  Even the ham tasted like a salt shaker -- I mean, ham is the easiest meat to cook with a little seasoning (if at all) to be flavorful.  On the seafood option, the ahi tuna skewers were all over the place -- sometime cooked just right, sometimes chewey/overcooked, and so overseasoned it wasnt edible.  Next to the ham, the next easiest (or even easier) item to not screw up is grilled pineapple -- instead, I received thin, tart, hardly grilled pineapple (the kind youd get at Country Buffet).  Even the deep-fried bananas on the salad bar-buffet were soggy and mushy.  Did I speak to management and express these concerns?  No, I figured if they work there and supervise and taste their product, they should have a clue (a manager was going through the restaurant asking patrons regarding their dining experience -- honestly I just wanted to finish and leave and be done with it).  It is what it is....a $20 meal for $50-60.  You decide...but there are so many other wonderful choices for dining in Vegas.",

Without telling you, they charge you a \"tip\" on your bill (and the service was terrible, so they were definitely not getting 18%....but too late, they already did).

When we showed up the line was quite long.  With reservations we still had to wait 15-20 minutes to be seated.  Our waiter was really good all night, no complaints about him.  We had the full meal plan.  As we don't like fish we didn't take the surf part of the meal.  The meat service was very slow.  WE had to wait quite awhile between servers for the meat to come around.  The bacon wrapped chicken didn't looked cooked, and after we cut it open we confirmed that and we didn't eat it, and put it aside.  The beef was very hard to cut, never mind chew.  The salad bar choice was poor, things were labelled incorrectly, not very appetizing.  And then 3 hours later both my husband and I were in the bathroom sick, something there, not sure what.  But we won't be going back.  The other brazillian steakhouse is hands down much better.",

The grilled pineapple, the filet mignon, the spicy chicken and seafood are my favorites.   My recent trip was on October 5th for my 38th birthday.  I met the nicest hostess by the name of Natalie.  I also met the owner Bill who really went out of his way to make my birthday the greatest.  He has a genuine nature about him and now I see why Pampas thrives in the heart of Las Vegas!

    "text": "I had high expectations of this place considering my first Brazilian BBQ experience was with Espetus Churrascaria in San Francisco.  Pampas came very close to meeting those expectations.  The food here was really good.  Out table, including myself, ordered a combination style dinner that included meat and seafood.  I was under the impression places like this only specialized in meat, so the seafood was a delightful surprise and a nice contrast to red, bloody and savory meat.  My favorite items on the menu: Picanha (served nearly rare), Louisiana sausage, Herb Chicken, Scallops wrapped in bacon, fried cod, and grilled pineapple.  Surprisingly, they didn't have any chicken hearts (a popular item among my friends).  Our waiter explained that it was a menu item they used to carry, but scared a lot of people so it was taken off the menu.  The salad bar options were larger than expected, they had a good variety of veggies and pastas to choose from.  I particularly liked the fried mashed potatoes and fried bread.  The sea food plate was awesome. It's delivered to the table as it's cooked, that way you don't get seafood that's been sitting under a hot lamp.  We were seated promptly from our reservation time. The place is setup nicely, with quasi private areas for large parties.  The area we sat in could easily host a party of more than 20 people.  Our waiter was very friendly and personable.  Once we were seated, a barrage of waiters came out to deliver our food, one just as quick as the other.  As we got halfway through our dinner, things began to slow down, the waiters approached us more infrequently.  But by this time, I was already full out of my mind so I didn't care much.  I think it was apparent my stomach was waving the white flag of defeat.  The only thing I didn't like was the lack of selection when it came to their BBQ options.  There was still plenty to choose from, but not as much as I expected having gone to other Brazilian BBQ's restaurants.  As far as price goes, be sure to have a wallet to match your appetite.  This place is not for penny pincher's.  Overall, I really enjoyed this place.  I would definitely revisit Pampas the next time I'm in town.",

I have only been to one Rodizio style restaurant before so I was expecting the seafood to come around just as the meat does (and be able to turn it down). It actually comes out separately on a plate (with 4 types of seafood) and they won't take it back or let you take it home...but that's really besides the point. The salad bar was very good in my opinion - cold salads, hot pasta and rice, soups, cheese biscuits, and more. I thought all of the meat was delicious as well, especially the bacon wrapped turkey. They also offer lunch for $20 without the seafood, which I would gladly go back and pay full price for. I think the prices might go up at dinner time, but I can't really imagine what more they can offer, so I would say stick with lunch.",

Honestly it was overpriced.  $60 (with a coupon) per person?  Is that normal?  oh well, maybe I'm just cheap.  the meat was ok.  Pork was too dry though.  I think we tried filet mignon which was good, chicken was ok and so was the lamb.  but oh the pineapple... it was delicious.  you mean i paid $60 to eat a freakin whole pineapple?  yeah.  and that was worth it.  The staff was friendly and pretty comical.  Whenever we didn't want a certain meat, the server was like, what?  you don't like my meat?  fine.    I don't think I'd come back because of the price.  I'd rather eat somewhere else, but it was good enough for me.",

    "text": "Very disappointed and unperfessional!!! It was my wife's 30th birthday last Saturday and a group of my family and friends came along to celebrate at what we thought was going to be a wonderful experience.... NOT!  We purchased an Amazon special for a buy 1 for the price of 2. Not anywhere on the voucher did it say, Meat not included. The buffet is only veggies and a salad bar, and that is $45 regular price. Basically, what we got was the salad bar for half off, and free alcohol (only well drinks) for the first hour, not including the tax and gratuity.  Little did we know that the meat was not included. That ended up being an extra $20 per person, plus tax and gratuity. Don't get me wrong, the meat was amazing and the service was great! The issuse we had, especially me, was when I asked for the Manager of the restaurant and the Chef came out after we receive a bill for $360!  When I was approached by the (so called manager) he walked right up to me and said, \"What's the issue here\"? Not as any professional would approach a table and introduce him/herself and say their name and rank, also asking us the right questions and showing customer service the way I thought it would be.  He said, \"What is the issue\"? As I began to tell him what the issue was and how my hole table is confussed as we had no idea and it was never indicated on the voucher, that the meat wasn't included and tax and gratuity isn't included, the hole time he had the facial expressions of, no matter what you say I will not help you, give you half off, listen to what you're saying, in fact I am going to argue with you and make this all your fault because you the customer of my restaurant that's never been here before is wrong and I am right! Let's not forget the fact that it's my wife's 30th birthday and she is pregnant, as we're having a great time and here he comes and reined the damn birthday party!  Complete douche bag, inconsiderate, False leading and no compassion or understanding of the customer or to even listen and try to work with me and understand that it's not the money, it's the fact that my friends and family didn't expect another larger bill, especially after the servers where coming around serving meat and drinks we all were tipping well over $100 plus not knowing another bill of $360 was coming.  Never!!!!! will I return to this place. I am embarrassed that I was treated with such disrespect and my wife feels bad after receiving the bill and we had to pay $40 each extra as a group per couple. I would rather have gone to Chuck e Cheese and all of us adults acted like kids again instead of being treated like a piece of trash.  Don't worry, I am not the only one who feels horrible about the service I received. There's more reviews to come from other couples of the party. : )  Thanks.",

    "text": "So, a little background. We purchased a voucher on Travelzoo that was a 2 for 1 deal.  An $86 meal became $43.  After reading some of the reviews on Yelp, I was not looking forward to this dinner.  Prior to purchasing the voucher, I had read some pretty favorable reviews. That was 2 months ago.  I checked Yelp this afternoon before we went to dinner, and I found some reviews that trashed the place.   Even though I am giving this place 3 stars,  I started out wanting to give 5 stars.  The food, in a word, was SPECTACULAR.  I don't know what restaurant some of these people were eating at, but both my wife and I found this place great. The salad bar was fantastic.  Lots of vegetables such as Chinese broccoli and pickled veggies.   Caesar salad was surprisingly good.    If you are a meat eater, you can eat yourself silly.  I especially liked the spicy chicken and a top sirloin that was a special of the night.    Before I get to my downgrades, some advice.   Don't bother purchasing a 2 for 1 voucher ahead of time from Travelzoo or any other site. We could not walk more than 50 yards without someone offering a 2 for 1 coupon on the strip.  Heck, there was some dude wearing some Brazilian bird outfit not more  than 50 yards from the restaurant inside the Miracle Mile mall adjacent to the Planet Hollywood hotel that was offering a 2 for 1 discount coupon.    Again, this would have been a 5 star review if not for a couple of things that our waiter did that were, let's say, disappointing.  When we sat down, he asked us if we wanted any drinks.  We said \"no;\" however, we wanted water.  He asked if we wanted flat or sparkling and we said flat.  Not too long after came a couple of bottles of Pelligrino.  About a half hour into the meal, my wife asked me \" are we being charged for this water?\"   I brought the waiter over and I asked him this question, and he said \"yes.\"  I said \"not a chance.\"  He got defensive and I said that nothing was mentioned about charging for the water, and our waiter, to his credit, told us that he would take the water off the bill. By the way, the cost of these two LARGE bottles of Pelligrino was $30.  One could conclude that this is how this place makes its money.   The second thing that the waiter did was bring our final bill and it totaled almost $20.  Mind you, we had not purchased any extra sides and no drinks.  Our expectation was that we would receive a bill for the sales tax which should have been between $6.80 and $8.60.  I explained this to the waiter. He left to take care of it, and came back w/o any changes.  Instead, a 5 min explanation as to why the bill was correct. I was very calm and explained that he was incorrect and why.  He then realized that he got our voucher mixed up with another promotion involving the purchase of show tix.  He brought the check back  and everything was corrected.   One more thing. Another reviewer trashed the place because he was part of a large party and was annoyed that the restaurant added a tip for everyone based upon the full cost of the meal BEFORE the Groupon discount.  He felt that the tip should be based upon the discounted Groupon price. This is incorrect as the waiter is being penalized.   ALWAYS tip based upon the full value of the meal before discounts.",

    "text": "This place is not worth the money or the sickness you get afterwards. The food and service were the worst we've ever experienced in Vegas. Trust me, pay a little more money and go to Fogo de Chao or another steakhouse. We went here because my parents got a voucher for two compliments of the timeshare they own. Their meal had to be upgraded to unlimited meat for $10 pp. The hostess offered my husband and I a coupon for two $34 buffets. We thought that was nice...at first. They don't tell you that you have to buy an alcoholic beverage per person in order to activate the deal - after you buy the alcohol, you're paying roughly what you would for two dinners without the coupon. Our waiter, Rigo, was ok but pretty inattentive. He didn't bother to inform us that the water they bring to the table (without asking what we'd like) is an automatic charge per person. Meat service was extremely slow. They don't bring new plates after you're done with the salad bar - they told us to go get another from the bar if we wanted one. The salad bar was extremely lacking, with wilted romaine hearts and empty slots where other items should be. Their cheese rolls were very dense and dry. Their mashed potatoes were the only bright spot on the salad bar. When we finally got meat cooked a little more thoroughly (everything seems to come out medium rare) the meat was flavorless and fatty. This is obviously not top quality meat. Both my dad and I pulled out large chunks of gristle while chewing (mine was almost like a valve to an organ).   We were thoroughly underwhelmed with service and food quality. We didn't leave full, but were tired of chewing the tough meat and waiting forever for the type of meat we wanted to try. The worst part, though, was when we all got sick in the middle of the night to varying degrees. Getting back on a plane the next day was not fun.",

This is the only reason this place gets a star,  although I'm not sure I could give them 0 stars even if wanted to.  We sat at our table for 20 minutes, and I never got a drink, or the little wooden marker so I could be served dinner. I get it,  you're busy,  but this is  inexcusable.  Forget thinking you're going to get a nice meal here.  It's in a mall.  It's over rated. And it's a huge letdown.  After waiting like a castoff, I got up and left.  But first I gave the manager a piece of my mind. I couldn't believe his best suggestion was \"you should stay here,  you're going to have to wait wherever else you go,  you should just stay here for dinner\". Um, yea, I don't think so.   Honestly, stay clear of this place.  It's just not anything special for the $50+ per head.",

The salad bar and hot apps bar is a great touch.  There is always a coupon available or a deal you can find to save a few dollars.  Go at lunch and it is almost half the price.  Many of the buffets around town are approaching $20-$30 per person, why not get real food for that price.  Kids 5 and under are free as well.  BTW, no free desert here.  Just love the food, atmosphere and place.",

They have an small area with salad and some hot food to put on plates, of which you have to go get yourself. It is crowded and reminds me of livestock at a water trough.  The little cheesebread is delicious.  They bring you skewers of meat constantly and ask if you want some. If you do, they cut you pieces off to eat. You can keep eating until you are sick if you wanted to.  NONE of the meat tasted like top tier cuts, but they were cooked just right. The pork tenderloin and garlic beef tenderloin had the most seasoning but everything else was pretty bland.  They never offered us ham - I saw it at another table as we walked out.  If you want to spend 75 bucks and get fat on meat snacks, this may be your spot.",

Reluctant at first cause the groupon told us to state that we were using one, I was nervous to actually use it. Many restaurants put you in a shady seating area with little to no attention and can treat you differently. Pampas was totally different. We were treated like any other patrons in the restaurant. The meats were fresh and hot and came frequently. The roasted pineapples were quite refreshing as well. Cheese rolls were alright, probably better when hot. The roasted plantains were yummy as well as the roasted potatoes and sauteed shrooms. We ended the night with a white chocolate cheese cake. Yum. We would come back again with or without the groupon. We had a great experience.",

I was paying with cash and the server said Thank You, I had to have them fix the bill and ask for change , I am a 15-20&% tip person, but not 40%. She look surprised and returned with the change, also stated I do not know what happened , the discount is applied automatically. Of course this is a lie as each register has to be told their is a discount or coupon and the code for a discount.

I ordered a groupon for the seafood lunch rodizio; and let me tell you, if you have any coupons or groupon- you may risk getting crappier service.  We got there and I showed her my paid for groupon- and let me tell you; for lunch it still costs $60 for the groupon plus tax and tip so you're still paying $75 for lunch. They brought us one small plate of seafood and that's it. The appetizers on the bar were pretty good except for their being so much cranberry in the dishes- this isn't necessary in every cold dish you prepare. Sometimes simpler is better:)  The meats they brought out were basically the same- sirloin and chuck; which were very good but lunch doesn't offer as much variety as I felt. Also, they barely came around to your table. Our server seemed like a nice lady but I saw a change in her presence after we mentioned our groupon- i think mainly because many people who have vouchers do not tip their servers well. So, we barely saw her come around to our table- we did notice though there was a lack of servers for lunch and so I felt kinda sorry for her.  However, that being said...she still should have had a better attitude towards us even though we were groupon customers. We still left a tip- because both of us always believe you tip your servers; unless it's outright horrible service- most of them make minimum wage. Always tip!!   We went for dinner one time before without a coupon- we were treated very well and there was much for variety of meats and a better sides bar.   Overall okay but most likely won't return.",

    "text": "My friend had got a coupon from a timeshare presentation at Westgate Resort & casino. So our meal was basically buy one get one free as the price of 1 person is about $68 I believe, but we each paid half. So after looking at the Yelp reviews and pictures we were excited.  Due to putting the incorrect address in my GPS we ended up being 30 minutes late. Once I discovered my mistake which was after 17 minutes off setting off my friend called the restaurant to notify them. When the staff member picked up we were quickly put on hold and left on hold....for 30 minutes, the entire time it took to drive over from the incorrect location we were at.  I even called them from my phone when we were about 10 minutes away and also was put on hold.  When we arrived at the restaurant, we told them we had tried to call them to give them a heads up that we would be 30mins late for our reservation but we had been placed on a hold and still were. The waitress was shocked and marched us to the desk to show the hostess. With us standing there they didn't even bat an eyelid and somehow got it mixed up that we were part of a table already seated. After telling this waitress again what happened, she apologized which the other hostess didn't and gave us both a complimentary drink.  After being seated, we got some food from the buffet and waited for the meat with our green circle clearly visible. After 4 rounds, it seemed our table was invisible as we kept getting passed over...this happened for 20 minutes. To get their attention my friend lifted the green circle up in her hand and after 3 minutes suddenly we had 3 servers at our table.  One of the servers tried to make a joke about it & I basically said she had to go this far to get some meat service at this table & I don't see how that is funny! After that we got served as we should have but the experience was already down the toilet by then.   I am glad I didn't pay full price as our experience was not worth the price in my opinion. If it wasn't for the waitress who apologized & gave us complimentary drinks for the awful service I wouldn't have tipped at all.  The food wasn't all that great, Fago de Chao is better in my opinion. The meat wasn't seasoned enough for my friend and I and the salad bar was  smaller than I had expected with less variation for the price. I will not be coming here again. Such a shame as I love Brazilian food.",

    "text": "We had a Groupon for this place. Included in our meal was all you can eat salad bar, seafood and meats. Also one hour of unlimited bloody mary, sangaria, mimosa or draft beer and a dessert to share. Soon after being seated our drink order was taken, we were invited to the salad bar and our sea food platter was served.   The salad bar was not huge but plenty to choose from mostly cold salad items not a lot of lettuce as you would expect from a salad bar. Some of the items were mushrooms, kale (both hot), zucchini, green beans, rice, bread, soup, fruit, cheese, curry chicken and greek couscous. I only made one trip to the salad bar to save room for the other offerings. The seafood platter was just ok. The fish was a bit dry. The shrimp was good.   Soon, the meats started to come along. Pork loin, bacon wrapped chicken, chicken, tri tip, pork sausage, and sirloin. A nice surprise was the grilled pineapple. My favorites were the bacon wrapped chicken, pork loin and sirloin.   The food was pretty good. We were happy with the customers service here. Everyone was friendly and helpful. Our server was on top of it. This restaurant is located inside of Miracle Mile shopping center.",

They charge you for water without even telling you. 10$ for water for a table of 5. For water really? Let alone the small plastic cups had water stains all over them. The service was horrible. Our waitress name was Bailey and did a terrible job.. We all had ordered sodas and with being there for almost 2 hours we had only received one extra refill, which already was a mission to begin with. They have 3 waiters sitting at the front chit chatting taking people to their seats when they should have waiters taking orders! As for their 50 item salad bar! FALSE ADVERTISEMENT! I bet there was only 20 items. Terrible salad bar, they have you waiting so long for the meat to come that you end up filling up on the salad bar. This place is a huge scam. Let alone an automatic 20%. We were forced to give a 33$ tip to Bailey when in reality she didn't even deserve 10$. This was an awful experience as a first time goer. Our waitress was too busy  looking at the computer, talking to customers who had already paid and was making jokes instead of paying attention to people who still needed to be served. Also there was no sight of seafood in the vicinity which should have been included! This place is a big scam. Do not waste your time or $$$ here!",

We spent the weekend in Vegas with another couple and I recommended pampas for their night alone and my boyfriend loved it so much he wanted to come back too. This time our experience was different. The salad bar seemed lacking. The meats were just passing us by. Instead of being stuffed line the first time we barely got to try each meat once. I don't think we even got to try every meat. The same sausage kept coming to our table even though we didn't like it. But the sirloin and good stuff only came around once. I also don't like how they charge you for tap water but don't say that. Apparently it was printed on the menu. I didn't get upset at the time because they didn't charge us for our beer and iced tea but now I'm thinking the meal we ordered must have included beverages or open bar or something because the menu price is $50 but with the bogo coupon I had they charged us $80. I have mixed feelings about this place. Try it if you have a coupon and know what to expect. But we will not return  Edit to add - the shrimp on the seafood platter wasn't all cleaned. Inconsistent. Half still had the poop vein thing which is a huge turn off, couldn't eat those",

They offer red and white sangria and it's one of the best I've ever had and I drink a lot of sangria! Every server I've had here have all gave exceptional service which let alone would have me coming back again and again.

    "text": "John and I visited Pampas (Brazilian Rest.) while on Vegas. We met a couple who just left prior to arriving. They stated the food was overrated. Me, I am a meat and veggie girl so it was just what I was looking for. It is about $50 per person for the full salad bar and all you can eat meat selections. For an additional $10, you can drink all the Mimosas you like. You have a  & a Go sign at your table. They literally bring you all the fresh meat you can eat. The meats are hot, juicy and sliced off the skewer right in front of you. They sliced pineapple was super delicious . I actually thought the overall service was really good. He came around enough to let us know he was still there. He didn't brother us with a lot of extras. We did pay $2.00 for a Tall container of water. That was real funny to me. I thought water was free...Lol. Joke was on me.",

We came at the end of lunch as they were clearing out the lunch salads to \"turn into\" dinner options as the hostess said hey offered more options. Well the options were exactly the same. Nothing mire or nothing less than the lunch choices. It really was all unappetizing. Boiled zucchini, runny liquidy mashed potatoes, wilted lettuce in the salad.. pretty much it. We did manage to eat a decent meal with the rice and beans and the cheese breads (which were shaped like muffins interestingly). As for the meats a lot of it was not really edible. It just tasted very sodium and nitrate filled like deli meats/hot dogs etc. We usually are content with chicken but it was inedible. One option was literally canned ham. We were only able to enjoy 1 out of all the meats they offered (which by the way we had to literally flag the meat guys down bc they didn't really have an order in which they rotated around the room. We were often skipped and overlooked and we were seated in the middle of dining room). It could have been a complete waste of time and culinary disaster but the rice and beans and cheese bread along with one of the meats provided us with enough to have a meal. I will say the staff was all nice and tried their best to make it a good experience but we won't be returning. The quality was just not up to par as any Brazilian restaurant we have been to.",

Once my friend arrived we were set to go eat somewhere else. As i've never tried Brazilian, Lizzy persuade us to stay and just try it. We grabbed a table and the food was just amazing. Meat lovers dream, especially when they wrap it in bacon. The service deserves 5 stars alone, the food was great, and the drinks by your lovely bartender were amazing.

I got there around 12pm and the food on the buffet was terrible, but I thought \"no problem, I just want some salad and I'm gonna wait for the meat.\" So, the first waiter came with only two small pieces of sausage and it was not so good. And after 5 minutes waiting for more meat, another waiter came and the meat were these in the pictures (disgusting).. I waited more, and another waiter came with another terrible piece of \"picanha\" the best part of the animal ( but that meat that he served us, was not Picanha, not at all). Oh, and before I forget, a lady came to us to take a picture.. and before she takes the pic I asked if it was for free, and she said Yes, and if you want more than one, it'll be 20$. Ok. A few minutes later, she came with the pictures, I saw the photos and I said I didn't want to buy it. Suddenly she took the photos, turned around and grumbled: \"why did you let me take the pictures then?\" I had no idea what to say to that unhappy lady. Well, that's it. If you don't want to eat good meat and a good CHURRASCO go there! But if you are looking for a great brazilian restaurant, I suggest you go to another place.",

My parents bought my girlfriend and I, whom are both Vegas industry workers, the groupon for Pampas for her birthday; we have never been so let down.  We both had surf and turf, which was fantastic, when we didn't get a charred end piece of meat. They are authentic and cut the meat off skewers, which leads to various inconsistencies. Example, the tri-tip just came out, I got a burnt piece with almost no meat at all, while the next piece was perfect. Our meat server seemed to have noticed but as with every table, just wanted to get his round done with.   Besides Jonathan, this is the worst staff in Vegas. They seem as if you are a burden, unwilling to be friendly or helpful about any inquiries towards their cuisine. It's in the way they won't look at you in the eye, return any manner pleasantries or even smile.  I have never been so unimpressed with a restaurant in Vegas and when $147 gets two surf and turf dinners, two drinks and dessert.. You could dine at a plethora of better eateries.   I will not be surprised when Pampa's is replaced. They are a shame to what the Vegas service industry prides ourselves on.   Do not waste a dinner in Vegas here.",

    "text": "ONLY visit this location if you're not paying. Nearly every step of the visit was off, starting with our seating. We had 4 PM reservations, as much to enjoy the food and its unique presentation as to be able to beat any Friday night crowd. When we approached the exterior host/hostess stand, we found no one there, which was fine as there wasn't a line, only us. We walked into the interior host/hostess stand and waited for someone. Again, no staff member. When we were \"greeted,\" the staffer acted annoyed, as if we'd disturbed her by making reservations AND arriving for them. Despite absolutely no one else waiting to be seated and literally tens of open tables, we were told to wait. We waited for 15 minutes for no apparent reason and the person who seated us was only slightly more friendly than the first staff member.   Our waiter was nice, which was a pleasant change, but other than bringing our drinks and clearing plates (not particularly efficiently, by the way), he really did nothing more. In the area in which I live, the two Brazilian steakhouses offer much more engaged wait staff. This is important because Pampas literally prints what you should tip on the bill. Not the usual 15%, 20%, 25% amounts, but a literal \"You're bill is X. The tip is X.\" As someone who wait tables to pay off her grad school debt, I'm a damn good tipper - WHEN I GET SERVICE. Our waiter, who treated us no differently than the other tables in our section, took a drink order, refilled our water (also, don't drink water at this place - there's a \"Water Conservation Fee\" that isn't revealed until you get your bill. While I agree that the Southwest is close to water crisis mode, pulling this without informing customers is just shady) and only sometimes cleared plates from a crowded two top. When we wanted to leave, we waited 35 minutes for the bill. For this \"service,\" we had to give the guy $33.   We had a Groupon that, according to both Groupon and Pampas websites, was the equivalent of $142 in food and beverage. The \"Surf and Turf\" option was to include eight meat selections, four seafood options and \"more than 50 hot and cold side and salad choices, \" according to the Groupon description. Um, no. As to the salad and sides, the only way anyone is getting to fifty is by making roughly 30 odd salads with various toppings or considering plain mashed potatoes one option and mashed potatoes with butter or gravy another. While I did not count every hot or cold station on the buffet/bar, my guess is that there are less than 20 stands, but that these contain selections with multiple items, like an antipasti station with a variety of meats, cheeses and vegetables. That does not \"50+\" options make.  On to what these folks believe is worthy of paying close to $60 a head to eat: the meat (and in this case, the seafood). Have you ever been to very run-of-the-mill Asian buffet? If the answer is yes, you've had the equivalent of the salmon, Tilapia and mussels served by Pampas. Every piece tasted over-sauced and looked, tasted and smelled like it was cooked before well we arrived - exactly like a strip mall buffet. Those buffets, however, don't start at $38 per person and tend to be much more satisfying.  The meats, you ask? Only slightly better than the seafood, with the exception of the top sirloin, which was wonderfully flavored and extremely tender for that type of cut. The chicken drumstick I got was so overcooked, the leg bone actually shattered (and scattered, much to my chagrin) when I cut into it. The meat looked desiccated, which was a bad start for the meat course. In the two plus hours we were in the restaurant, only five of the selections (one of which was grilled pineapple) came to the table. Again, this wasn't any different for anyone else in our section, given the immense amount of time we had to observe other tables while we waited for the bill.   The offer included dessert - frozen cheesecake, purchased in bulk - and two cocktails. I opted for a Caipirinha, the national cocktail of Brazil, an excellent aperitif. While well-made, it was far more boozy than I had hoped, especially since I would be driving. My companion, who had been drinking the night, opted to have a soda. While I get that the deal included two COCKTAILS, we thought it was silly that our waiter didn't switch out the cheaper soft drink for the never ordered second cocktail.  On top of all slowness, weird charges and marginal food, an attractive woman with an accent as beautiful as the rest of her, rolls a heavily stocked bar cart throug the restaurant, slinging drinks (possibly at an upcharge from the bar) tableside. While I enjoy a hustle, especially one with style, was odd at 4:45 PM, in a sparsely seated room. Additionally, while the woman - again, she was lovely and the only staffer with a personality - didn't reek of desperation, the ploy did. Once the bill arrived, we felt like it was a slow, bad tasting, scam.   Avoid if you can.",

They have two lines they put you in... one for show vouchers and one for walk-in customers. They told us 25 minutes (two hours before the show) that they would seat us. They said they would page us. While I am sitting there they are seating each and every walk-in customer. They never paged us at all. I got pissed off and went next door to Todai and they were kind enough to give us $20 off each meal just because of my experience there. They had indicated to us that Pampas gets plenty of haters.",

    "text": "this is a letter I wrote to management regarding our experience this past weekend on Fathers day. This review has nothing to do with the food. We ended up cancelling our order and leaving this place because of the poor offensive service.   Dear management,  I took my family of 9 this past Sunday to your restaurant for the first time. None of us have ever been to Pampas and none of us have ever gone to a Brazilian steak house. We heard about Brazilian steak houses and how they work but for our first experience at Pampas it made us never want to try Pamas or any other Brazilian restaurant.  We did not get to eat the food mainly because of the service.   We waited 25 minutes to be seated and that's expected but then we waited another 15 to 20 minutes for anyone to even come to take out drink orders. We were served water a few minutes after being sat and that was fine but when my sister in law asked for straws, the woman that served the water answered impolitely and then brought back a handful of bar straws (after I had just watched her handling a tab) those straws had no paper or covering on them aside from us being uneasy and most of us not wanting to even drink from those straws because someone else has already touched them, the table was dirty with dried crusted food and one of the tables was loose from the top of the table where the food is placed. Usually a table gets lose from the legs.   After this, someone finally came to take our orders. she explained the 2 big options and them proceeded to ask if we wanted the option with sea food or the option with only meat. We were all confused because we were given menus with several other options but she was only giving us 2 options. After disputing this with her and expressing our confusion she told us the reason why she 'suggested\" only those 2 options was because if we try to share we would get charged. This is understandable but she then proceeded to tell us that we were being watched by cameras and  that whom ever was watching us will have her charge for an additional meal if we are \"caught\" sharing. Mind you, One person on the table was deathly allergic to sea food and is also a vegetarian so this person was going to order from the buffet. We had 3 children on the table, one whom does not eat sea and none of these 3 kids would have to even order a 30 dollar all you can eat meal because....they are kids and kids don't eat that much and finally another person on the table does not eat red meat.   This waitress pushed a 2 options that only 3 people on this table would have/wanted to order and then offended the entire table by telling us we were being watched so \"no sharing\" as if we were a class of 10 year olds. After she took our orders she let us know that there was going to be a one dollar charge for the waters we received. We did not ask for water. It was served to us without her asking.   After she left, we all looked at each other and decided to leave. I canceled the order with the waitress. She insisted she had already put in our drink orders but by this time we were all offended. I did not tell her the reason because it was just to much. We just wanted to get out of there. This was our Fathers day for our dad. He always wanted to try eating at a Churrascaria but now he feels he will never go to one because of this experience.   Most of us know how buffets and brunches work. You pay per person. We went in knowing that this place would work the same way (from what we heard how a Brazilian steak house works). We had no intentions of \"cheating\" and only ordering one big 30 dollar all you can eat meat and sea food. We are not cheap and we are not crooks but according to your waitress and the comments she made about us being watched I guess we look like the type that would do such a thing. Better choice of words would go a long way in a case like this.",

We were offered alot of beef but who can a argue with that right? Now the thing about it, is that we were impressed alot more with the salad bar...the roasted vegetables were delish and these cheese biscuits they had were incredible.  If you eat here, get the discounts that you pay $3 per person at Last Minute tickets. It will save you $$$ and that way you won't be disappointed.  I'm giving this place 3 stars because of the raspberry mojitos, cheese breads, and salad bar that had so yummy Brazilian side dishes. I just hope that they get riskier with the proteins",

    "text": "I have to downgrade Pampas to a 3. I've been there plenty of times and have always enjoyed the food but the last time I went there for dinner the food and service was not up to par as I have previously experienced in the past.  My boyfriend and I came there on 12/30/14 around 730pm we were told they were not allowing anyone to be seated unless you had a reservation which didnt bother me I'm reasonable they seemed a little busy but I had never had to make a reservation before and there next available reservation opening wasnt until 9pm.  When we returned they immediately sat us in the bar area and we sat and sat and sat while watching the waiters pass our table and while watching others be seated after us and being assisted by thier waiter.  I finally complained to the manager that we had been sitting here for at least 10mins the manager seemed annoyed that I was annoyed.  I asked the manager to move us into the bigger dining area and he did and we were then immediately assisted by a waiter.  We took to the salad bar area hmmm somethings missing seems to be a lot less hot items at the salad bar than there was on previous visits.  Then the food starts coming to the table all the meats were either too raw \"and I like mediums rare\" the meats were tough overcooked and underseasoned.  Ok surely they can make up for this with that bacon wrapped scallop and the grilled shrimp that Ive had everytime Ive come there but nope no scallop, no shrimp. I asked the manager about it she said yeah they used to have it for dinner but they no longer serve it.  Another waiter came by and placed a small plate at our table and said your surf and turf. it had a few mussels a small piece of grilled halibut I think it was and a couple of nonmemorable items.  Really?  How come the menu items are being removed and not being replaced with another item and the price is still the same?  No longer a fan of Pampas and I wont be going back ever.  Fogo De Choa will be my new brazilian steak house spot.",

While the salad bar was good (for what they had) I was disappointed at the rest of my meal (surf & turf). I'll admit, maybe my issue was expecting the food to be as good as Fogo... it wasn't. Some of the steaks were salty and it didn't seem to matter if you wanted rare or well. I honestly didn't have anything I really liked as everything they brought out was mediocre at best. Hopefully this was all due to one or two guys back there not having a good day... Then the server brought me the bill for two and I saw $95.

    "text": "My group of 8 friends who came for a Bachelorette Party got reservations for Pampas since it was a option I had through Hilton Honors. We got there and the service was beyond slow and the waiter will not be attentive.  Most of our group ordered a prix fix meal and it took over an hour and we still never got the food.  Asked what was going on and no response.  Told them that we were late for a show and needed the check.  Still never got our meal.  So they comped our drinks, as compensation!  Really?!?!?  We paid a voucher for $48 each to get meal and a show and they only comped $39 from the drinks we got.  To top it off, 2 out of our group got sick instantly and throughout the day vomiting.  Still no compensation?  Never go here, unless you want to wait over an hour for a simple plate of food where all the meat is flying by.  Get sick from only having the salad bar.  And then not get any compensation.",

We got seated right away in a private room and then went out to the main floor to grab some salads, greens and other appetizers. They had a pretty big selection so I assumed that was it.   Boyy, was i wrong. A couple of waiters came in the room with these huge skewers of meat. I thought it was the coolest thing...they serve and cut the meat right in front of you. Then other waiters kept coming in with other different meats and fruit and then the first waiters came in again but with different items. I was such in awe. All I remember was that everything was sooo good and whoever had the bacon wrapped chicken I told him to keep it coming (lol).",

    "text": "This is my first trip to Las Vegas and Pampas was the first restaurant we ate at.  We were trying to find a sports bar as it was Sunday at 1pm and we wanted wings and football.  We walked the entire Miracle Mile shopping center and the two main sports bars, Blondie's and PBR Rock Bar, were packed.  We were really hungry by this time, so we stopped at Pampas.  We were promptly seated at the very front/patio area of the restaurant.  The salad bar is all the way in the BACK of the restaurant.  My husband is disabled and walks with crutches, so I was already planning my strategy to get his plate and my plate all the way across the restaurant.  Our server arrived, noticed the crutches, and immediately asked if we would be ordering the salad bar and, if so, would we like to be seated closer?  This scored major points with me.  They actually opened a section for us to sit in, and we had it all to ourselves.  We both ordered the surf and turf and hit the salad bar.  The only other churrascaria I have been to is Fogo de Chao, so that is where I will base my comparison.  The salad bar at Pampas is about 1/4 of the size of the one at Fogo.  I actually found this preferable as I remember being completely overwhelmed at Fogo.  The Pampas salad bar had a nice selection - jicama and citrus salad, Brazilian coleslaw, pasta salads, potato salads, hearts of palm salad and several others.  For a more traditional salad, there was an option of romaine or spring mix.  The romaine was dark green, crisp and fresh and the spring mix was equally fresh - not soggy at all.  All of the basic salad toppings were available and several dressing options were available.  My only complaint about the salad bar would be that the fresh mozzarella balls (presented with cherry tomatoes) were very bland.  On to the main reason we were there...MEAT!  By the time I returned from the salad bar, the sirloin guy had already been by and had left a delicious slice of perfectly cooked, medium rare meat on my plate.  It was seasoned just right and very tasty.  I ended up eating A LOT of that sirloin.  There was also bacon-wrapped turkey (can't go wrong with anything wrapped in bacon!), Brazilian sausage, ham, BBQ chicken, BBQ pork and even pineapple!  All of the meat was well seasoned and well cooked.    I had noticed one of the menu options was a skirt steak with chimichurri.  I asked our server if I could get a side of chimichurri and she was happy to oblige.  She let me know it would take a few minutes because they make it fresh for each order.  It came out a couple minutes later and was delicious!    The \"surf\" part of the surf and turf was ok.  When you order the surf and turf they bring a platter of seafood to the table and let you know you can order more of anything.  The inital platter includes grilled shrimp, scallops, salmon and the fresh catch of the day (not sure what it was - I think it was grouper, which I don't care for).  The shrimp were small but tasty, the salmon was well cooked and made even better by the provided soy ginger glaze.  I didn't try the catch of the day.  The scallops were very small and not very good....can't quite put my finger on it, but I ate one and didn't want anymore.  Overall, I would say save a few dollars and just get the meat.  There was a woman who was around during our entire visit...I believe she was either the owner or the general manager.  She stopped by our table to make sure we were satisfied and talked to us a little about the restaurant.  I commented on the chimichurri and she stated that everything is made fresh, in house.  In fact, I had noticed a window into the kitchen while I was at the salad bar where I could see people making all of the salad bar items.  Anyway, I always appreciate when I am in a restaurant and the owner or manager is interested enough in making sure the guests are happy that they stop by and chat.  When we checked in to our hotel, the concierge gave us two $5 off coupons for Pampas.  I am sure we will be using those before we leave Vegas at the end of the week.  At $19.99 for the meat-only option, its hard to beat for lunch.  If you go for dinner, it is more than double the price ($41.95 for meat only) but they add tenderloin, tri-tip beef, and lamb.  I have to admit...I am tempted.",

The tix tonight guy made us a \"reservation\" and when we showed up they said they would seat us in a few minutes. While sitting there waiting to be seated multiple people kept walking in and getting seatede right away. The only other people left waiting for a table was a group of 6 guys that also checked in with the voucher. Hmmmm.... so we were getting shafted for having a voucher?  So we wait around another 15 mins and finally with an attitude we get called. This is where is gets better low and behold they seat us in the very very back corner far away from where anyone with their little beef skewers are and from the buffet! Then we see them seat the 6 guys right next to us! When we asked to be in the main dining room the hostess said it would be another 20 mins!  We decided to up and leave and as we left noticied several open tables in the main dining room! This place is a rip off and with so many other options you would think they would get it together!   Stay away!",

As soon as I saw this place had a B health grade we should have left. I dos get the groupon. So glad because if I paid full price I would've had to fight them for my money back. Food for similar to Fogo, but quality was not. Undercooked bacon wrapped chicken has had my date night turn to the bathroom instead of the bedroom. Beware of this place. Very similar to a buffet.

We forgot all about it until the last morning we were in town & were able to get in an early dinner reservation before catching our plane. We showed up a half hour early & were seated right away. Our waitress, Stephanie, was a sweetheart & even charged my phone for me because it was dying & we needed to call a Lyft to the airport right after dinner. She had good recommendations for both of us based on our tastes & we weren't disappointed in our choices. Hubby had the petite filet & a lobster tail & I had the seafood bouillabaisse, which was phenomenal and was a huge portion that could have easily been shared between 2 people. It wasn't the fanciest place in Vegas & it's a little pricey without the voucher we had but the service was great & the food was delicious! Thanks again Stephanie! :)",

From who our server would be to the process of meat coming from kitchen. After that everything was smooth sailing.  The sangria was delicious, their deserts were completely yummy - so that leaves the middle of the meal, which leaves the salad bar and meats that come out endlessly. Much to be desired- the salad bar was a mess, but since there were so many people taking from it constantly and the meats - well the beef didn't seem to be the greatest cuts, pork, chicken - They had flavor, but not flavorful.  Our server was great, he checked on us  numerous times throughout the meal, and our friends had a wonderful time which was most important. Had our beautiful pictures taken. Overall, I would say that this was an awesome experience and outing for us on the strip, but the food wouldn't bring us back.",

First the salad bar was supposed to have 50 items including entrees, we couldn't find any entrees. It was very ordinary, few Brazilian offerings. Then came the meat,most was over cooked tough and dry. There was one meat server who friendly the rest were deadpan or even sullen.

The mashed potatoes were only good part of dish but not enough to save this dish. Definitely not worth $29...perhaps I will stick with meat order if I return.",

There were walk-ins waiting for tables and when I checked in with reservations,  then the host asked me if I would mind to wait behind the people waiting to be seated or sit at the bar. I explained that I have reservations but she said the walk in people now on the list so I would have to wait or sit at the bar . So I sat at the bar.  A note to future patrons, DON'T sit at the bar it is the last stop for the people bringing meats by and the typically run  out of anything well before getting to the bar. So the frequency of being served is far and few between. A note to leadership,  have every other server visit the bar first to be fair to patrons stuck at the bar. The salad bar is okay..",

(after waiting 10 minutes in line to get checked in for our reservation!!!) When we were finally sat, we were placed in the bar area under a TV, next to the bar with people crowding around the bar trying to get a drink while they waited on a table.   It took a while for our server to come, then took a while for drinks.  We had to walk through the crowded bar and then the crowded waiting area on a hallway floor that felt slippery / greasy to get to the salad bar area...not to mention, walking back through all of that with full plates from the salad bar.   We could barely hear each other speak it was so loud.  The food itself was good.  The server was polite.    We used a credit card for our dinner that we did not use anywhere else during our time in Vegas.  We have had this credit card for over 2 years with no issues.  All of a sudden, 4 days after using for dinner we get fraud reports from the credit card company that our card had been attempted to be used to make unauthorized payments.  Coincidence?",

After the meal I did tell her we had been there before and the service was awful and on this visit we enjoyed our lunch and service.  The drinks were filled without asking and the servers came around a lot and I do mean a lot with the meat offering. We did order desert, the cheesecake... it was very good and normally we don't get a desert... but again it went back to the great service Thais provided. We would not go back again though, unless maybe a groupon ( a big maybe).  There are far better Churrascaria in the Las Vegas area than to go on the strip for this one.  Personally I don't think this one will survive.",

When we were seated 10 minutes behind our time there were plenty of seats available. Some tables had things others did not even the basics like salt and pepper.  I looked over the salad bar while waiting on the server and it was not worth the effort. We ordered the drinks and the meal immediately since we had the time to read the menu ahead and the drinks showed up 5 minutes behind the meal. (15 minutes). the meal was prepared well but the serving size to cost was poor (almost twice what I would pay elsewhere for a filet mignon). Our server was slow on checking on drink refills and even slower handling the check. They were using a tablet system to order (supposedly for the first night) and finalize the checks but watching him the receipt printers were a challenge.  The restaurant itself looked satisfactory as far as decor but the bathroom was undersized for a restaurant of that style where people are going to stay and eat a while for their money.  I am certain we could find a better place on the strip.",

The waiter that finally decided to come over decided to tell us how much more money it was going to cost us. We had a discounted coupon where we paid $50.00 for two dinners. The gratuity plus the $1.00 per water bottle they make you pay even if you don't drink water came out to an extra  $25.00. The waiter name I believe was Eric, whom was as arrogant as they come. Didn't help that we were the only black couple their and had so many eyes glued on us as if we were going to run off with the China. I will never refer anyone to this place. HORRIBLE. Don't think the waiter deserved anything especially due to the fact he did absolutely nothing. This was a rip off with service that's worse than a drive thru window at your regular fast food restaurants. STAY FAR AWAY",

I realized that this place was working off of volume - likely driven by the coupon we and likely most of the guests had.  I asked my group if we should take off, telling them that we should not expect a fantastic meal.  Unfortunately we decided to stay.  The meats were extremely sub-par,  the Sirloin and Filet were chewy and grained with fat.  The salad bar was uninspiring, and the service stretched across all of the guests packed into the restaurant.  If you have eaten at Fogo de Chao before, do not come here.",

I wanted to try their 5.99 steak and eggs special because it was plastered all over the Miracle Mile Shops. However, it was really disappointing. I rarely ate meat these days and I was hoping it would be somewhat decent. It was actually not good. It was somewhat tolerable by A1 sauce. Also, it came with small potatoes and a meager portion of eggs. I really wanted only egg whites but they wanted to upcharge me 1.99 if I did so. Damn, no wonder, there was not much egg to begin with on the plate. It was not worth the 5.99 plus tax and tip.",

    "text": "WOW! Where do I start??   First of all-- this restaurant offers complimentary valet parking outside! With it being on the strip, valet parking (especially free) is awesome!! It was easy to find, extremely welcoming and gave off great vibes.   We chose to have lunch there, and also used a Groupon that was available, making everything affordable as well as amazing. The choice of meats as well as the variety was great, needless to say you will leave stuffed and satisfied.   The staff working was great- from the hostess to the meat server/carvers everyone was knowledgeable, professional and just seemed happy to be there. We were seated after a very, very short wait, and we were provided service shortly after. We did not have any problems with meat availability and overall just had a great time.   I really enjoyed my experience at Pampa's and can't wait to go back! 5 stars for sure.",

    "text": "Unless you're looking for overpriced meat sweats, you can find better options for less money. This arduous journey started when we walked up to the front door, there was a gentleman that stopped us before we got to the desk and offered us coupons for some nominal amount off the all-you-can-eat meat option. He really tried to sell it too, but unlimited amounts of animal on a spit brought to the table does not sound appealing. So after we said no (three times) we were able to put our name on the list, and had a table in the back room. Overall the restaurant setting is very nice and the room we were in was quiet. But the menu and pricing leave something to be desired.  Most of us ended up getting the salad bar buffet, which was also a half-assed hot food option. I'm not mad at the salad bar, but I could've paid half and been happier. We also had a birthday in our group, and you don't get free dessert (just a discount), which would have been great to know before we gave them the go ahead. But the \"chocolate explosion\" was good. You've got other options extremely close by, so unless you're into the meat sweats, you're better off going elsewhere.",

The shrimp they bring isn't the best, overcooked and not that tasty.  The salad bar was good too, although who wants to fill up on salad at a Brazillian Steakhouse??",

Incredible offer!  For $90, you get the radizio surf and turf dinner for two, unlimited beer, wine, sangria and caiparinas and a dessert.  It really made it a much better deal than the higher end Brazilian places.    The place itself is nice, the service was very good, salad bar was good.    I'd recommend Pampas, especially with the Groupon special.",

I returned the dirty utensil to my waitress, she just simply takes it and gives another one to me without any apology. The most ridiculous thing of the day was one of the meat cutter storm out of our table because there are only two chicken drumsticks left on the meat stick, and we decide to share it between three people. Then he refused to serve us because we decide to share. I get up and tried to get the manager, the waitress stopped me in the middle and asked me what happen. After I explained myself, the waitress talked to the meat cutter and let the meat cutter to talk to me, that meat cutter said I didn't want the chicken drumsticks, which is a ridiculous big lie!  I get upset and want to talk to the manager, the waitress told me to clam down and said the meat server was apologizing. I was like Are you kidding me? That's arguing, not apologizing. I wonder how those people got trained in the first place. At the end of the night, I ask for manager, and the waitress told me he was in the middle of the meeting. When I try to fill out a comment card instead, she told me they just don't have anything like that. I was so regret to pay the price to get this treatment. Everybody, spend your money somewhere else, I bet they will serve you with better attitude and clean utensils.",

    "text": "First of all, I must say I was nervous about this place after reading some of the reviews below, but I had already committed to a \"deal\" on another website (you probably get my drift).  Actually tried to return the other deal but it was just a little too late.  So glad I couldn't return it, we had a great meal and overall great experience!    We went on Friday evening, 1/25/19.  We did not have a reservation and had to wait about 7 minutes to be seated.  It appeared that most tables were occupied at that time.  Our server Paris was great, and Luz (our roaming caipirinha mixer that night) returned to our table later in the meal to check if we wanted any more caipirinha drinks (I tipped her well the first time around), which I did so she whipped another one out right away.  Also had one of each sangria which were included in the deal.  5 drinks with one meal is plenty for me (though Luz offered to make more caipirinhas and Paris offered to bring more sangria).    All items in the salad bar were stocked when we went through.  It is not as large as at some other Brazilian steakhouses, but there is plenty to (over)fill up on before starting in on the meat.  I thought all the items I selected were fine, though I'm not the pickiest eater.  I did think the cheese cubes were a bit strange like a previous reviewer, but my steak knife cut them easily.  :-)  The passadores came by frequently.  And I do mean frequently.  I lost count of how many times, but it was generally every couple of minutes, even when we were full.  One time, one of the boys even returned a few minutes later with a few pieces of filet mignon which he had NOT been carrying but brought at our special request!  Absolutely nothing to complain about regarding this part of the meal, unless you would complain about being offered too much meat too often.  We were not given an indicator, they just kept coming.  The sirloin in particular was very good and VERY tender, though obviously too rare for my wife's taste but she tried it anyway and agreed it was excellent.  When a later passadore served some well-done sirloin, she agreed with me it was better rare.  We did not try the pork items but thought all the beef, chicken and lamb items were good.  And roasted pineapple is always a treat.  We also had the tilapia (Paris brought that) which was fine but nothing special.  It is a Brazilian steakhouse after all.    The cheesecake dessert was on par with any other restaurant, no complaints there either.  We do try to be good customers and be nice to the waitstaff to help attract \"niceness\" back, but this really was plain and simple good service (no vestige of any of the negative things I read in other reviews here).  I'm sorry to all those who clearly had a different experience.  I can't help but think their ratings will be coming up, if our experience is how things will be going forward.  It will be on our list for future trips based on our experience this time.",

The meat is not top grade and chewy, very chewy and tough and fatty! All the Beef cuts tasted exactly the same, bland and no flavour at all. There was very little selection at the buffet and the food again tasted horrible. Pasta was hard and they even ran out of fresh clean plates and we had to stand to wait for more. The waiter never took away dirty dishes, ours was full of unwanted fatty bad meat. But the worse part is the CON they tell you is a deal with the 1/2 price coupons they are pushing out inside the mall and casino. Look on their web site, a meat dinner is $54.95. So here we are expecting that the bill to be $54.95 + 1 beer that I had. They charge you $1.00 each for the water they serve you too. Nope, our bill was $93 and change. The waiter said it was normally $184 for 2. The coupon gives you 1/2 off. We barely ate anything it was so bad and they hardly come around the tables with meat, but we stopped even saying yes to any as it tasted so bland and bad. The pineapple had no flavour but warmed up pineapple. Don't waste your money here. It is so not worth it!!!!",

Let's get the worst part out of the way; two of use ordered the steak and shrimp AYCE, only the waitress never brought us shrimp, even after one reminder. There's no excuse for that.  The food was slightly better than I was expected, but some of the cuts were criminally overcooked. The tri-tip, top sirloin, and bacon-wrapped chicken were my favorites. The meat quality is below that of Fogo de Chao or M-Grill.  While the waitress was quick to refill our drinks, forgetting the shrimp was annoying. The servers bringing out the meat were friendly and prompt.  With BOGO coupon, an appetizer, and drinks, lunch was around $90. That's normal for this type of restaurant. Without the coupon, it would have been ridiculously overpriced.  Bottom line: Go here if you want churrascaria and don't want to trek to Fogo, but only go if you have a BOGO coupon. Just don't go in with high expectations.",

    "text": "Well I've eaten at better Brazilian restaurants, much better.  The attitude of our server was very condescending.  When we asked for a different table he was reluctant and made us wait until he was ready to seat us, when we could see open tables nearby.    The advertisement says Steak and Seafood.  Should have been Steak OR Seafood.  Apparently you can't get both without paying an extra supplement, something that wasn't explained in advance.  Only on very rare occasions have I been talked \"down to\" by a waiter and made to feel like serving me was beneath him. This guy was definitely in the wrong occupation.  He personality was better suited to being a tire mechanic.   The food was \"OK\" nothing to brag about.  The servers worked on a pattern of \"feast or famine\".  They came by too frequently, followed by long periods of nothing.  The buffet salad and vegetable bar was also, \"just ok\", nothing special or worth filling up with. Over all there was a lot of meat, however, I didn't think that it was top cuts, some pieces were a bit chewy!  Did I mention that it was off the beaten path, located in a mall at the end of a branch that lead nowhere.   This meal was planned to be our highlight of our eating out on the strip.  We were all disappointed and felt that we could have done better eating somewhere else.    To add insult to injury, the waiter presented the check to  one of the ladies in out group of two couples.  How does a waiter make a mistake like that?  Since it was my treat to the four diners, I felt insulted that he chose to give her the check.  I think that she felt obligated to participated in the bill so she insisted on leaving the tip.  It was hard for me to say no to her given the table dynamics.  The whole thing ended in an ugly sean with her male counterpart telling her to stop interfering with my part of handling the check and payments. NO, I will never return even for a free meal.",

    "text": "A tagged along on a lunch gathering one FANTASTIC day.  What I thought was lunch downstairs at CapStone was actually lunch at pampas.  Capstone can be classified as a POP-UP restaurant where I work, so I thought we were going to the pop-up restaurant, my co-workers look at me like...\"nah, we is going to #PAMPAS\" say what, say huh....LET'S DO THIS,  Fantastic day indeed.  We went for lunch, the restaurant was semi-busy as we waited for the others to join.  By the time our entire group arrived, it was a steady pace of traffic.  Seated guests and take-out guests, YASSSSS you can do like -  AYCE chinese buffet take out - you know the place where they let you pack your own styrofoam, Yes, the option is available.  Very clean restaurant, kind staff, great customer service and very fast service.  So they give you give you approx. 20 mins to go attack the salad bar.  O-M-G, cheese biscuits, let me say it again CHHHEEEEESSSSSEEE BISCUITS and gluten free.  Not that that really matters to me, just wanted to throw that out.  My fat a$$ had about 12 of them, but WAIT dip the cheese biscuit into the bean soup...shut the front door.  So freaking good!  A variety of salads; beat salad, green bean salad, olives, NO ICEBERG (not even for decoration) \"Thank you, I really appreciate that\" multi- bean salads, quinoa salad, fresh fruit and veggies.  Other soups available that day Italian Wedding and Chicken Soup.  But the bean soup, it reminds me of red beans w/ hamhock that's been slow cooking all day w/ the perfect season.  (don't judge me and my food choices, it's good, shoo) Not too salty yet still flavorful, salt is not needed but that is just my personal opinion. On to the meats....  Don't get FULL off the salad bar, here come the Passadores come and IT'S...ABOUT...TO...GO....DOWN! (well, it WENT down)  Bacon wrapped chicken, filet mignon, italian sausage, pork chops, ham; really good stuff.  Meat tender and juciy, no extras needed.  Simple seasoning, salt and pepper, sizzling and piping hot flying out the the kitchen.  Even if you turn the card over, the Passadores still may if you would like any more...and guess, you ended up saying yes,even though you are STUFF.  But it is so good.  Give Pampas a try, they have a groupon every now and then, try them out at a percentage less of the original price.  I like Pampas alot, they are located in Planet Hollywood/Miracle Shop - southeast corner facing Harmon Ave.  Actually I'm going back in 2wks, yep I'm doing my dance ;-)",

We sat for a couple minutes and greeted by a server. She was very informative and recited what our Groupon had included. Unlimited steak, seafood, unlimited beer, wine, sangria, and capirihna- I think I spelt it correctly? A Brazilian drink, I guess it's vodka but I felt like I was drinking a margarita with a whole lot of tequila. I liked it.   I started with the white sangria. Tasty. Salad bar had plenty of options. Fresh veggies, salad, soup etc. The seafood platter was not very well prepared. The plate consisted of shrimp, mussels, salmon, and white fish that seem to be tilapia or cod? The salmon and white fish were over cooked, so very dry. Shrimp not too much flavor. We got one platter, we did not ask for more after. The meats I enjoyed was the sirloin medium rare and filet wrapped in bacon. All the other meats seem to be very dry and bland... was a little disappointed in the meats... but very happy I started off with the Groupon to try this place. Yelp gave mixed reviews so I did not want to spend $140+ and leave disappointed. To end we had the tiramisu which hands down was the star of the show. I ate all of that. Our server was great, drinks were great. Overall okay experience but may not be returning...",

    "text": "Avoid this place if you can. Maybe I'm spoiled by good customer service, floors that are not slippery, clean silverware and just some common courtesy. We travelled from Jacksonville where we've gone to Texas de Brazil and Terra Gaucha and the experience was great at these other places. From what I was served they only seemed to have 2 beef options a chicken that was as dry as the desert and pork tenderloin. The pork was good and the beef was good I will give them that. But if you are use to an upscale Brazilian steak house this is not the place to go. I was very surprised that our resort recommended this place. Hosting staff seemed very unprofessional kind of like teenagers. We were called over to be seated and upon getting to the hostess stand three hostess began a conversation as we sat there looking on waiting for them to walk us to our seats. When we were taken to our seats we waited for about 10 minutes before our waiter came over to introduce himself. He then brought some water over and poured it into a glass that was already on the table. I had to call him over 10 minutes later to get a second glass of water for my wife. He never asked if we wanted anything other than water. If he up sold me on a drink I would of probably gotten a beer or two but since no one asked I stayed with my water. The salad bar was also nothing to rave about. Spoons by the salad bar were dirty and almost empty, so one of the staff came by and threw some more spoons in which turned out to have food on them already. We upgraded to get the unlimited meats but hardly anyone came by to serve you. We got the filet mignon and about 15 minutes later someone came by. After complaining, our waiter did tell us that a lot of people called out and that he would get something out to us which he did eventually. Between the staff and the food I wouldn't waste your time or money on this place.",

It was a bit cheaper so I expected a little difference. I was pretty stoked with the open bar package we also got! The salad / side bar was very small, the garlic mashed potatoes were dried out and Luke warm, the cheese was hardened and started to change colors, the cheese bread was hard. I did enjoy the roasted jalapenos and tomatoes with mozzarella. The waiter was very friendly, the all around service was great I just wish the food were better. It was very loud and my friend and I pretty much had to yell to each other- that wasn't a big deal though. Just wanted to make a mention of it. The meat that was brought out was garlic sirloin ( pictured below ) Over cooked and dry, completely tasteless and hard to chew. Some other type of sirloin that was actually decent, a pork tenderloin that was extremely salty, I happen to like a lot of salt so it didn't bother me but my friend didn't like it. The last thing they brought out was ham shank and lamb chop. We didn't taste either of those. Here's my problem with the selection- there wasn't much of one. The waiter made my friend a very nice happy bday dish and it looked amazing! The drinks were served quickly, never had an empty glass. I was pretty happy about that seeing as how I didn't eat much. At least I got a good buzz. Honestly though. Very disappointed with the food selection and quality of the food they did serve.",

The Picana (sirloin) which is really what everyone goes for was very good as was the sausage, the pork, the bacon wrapped chicken and the grilled pineapple. The meat service was not as slow as I was expecting based on other reviews, however our waitress was virtually nonexistent I think she checked on us one time. However, do not waste your time on the salad bar or expect to have a salad bar like Fogo or Texas de Brazil because this is NOT the place. They do have 30 items on the salad bar but that would be counting sliced tomatoes, lettuce, cucumber,and  cubed cheese individually, probably also including counting the salad dressings individually. it was a sad, sad, salad bar. They will bring you a bottle of water and set it on your table without asking and then charge you a dollar a person so just be prepared for that. Luckily, I wasn't too disappointed because we were walking in the miracle mile shops and handed a buy one get one free coupon. We basically paid $21.95 a person. For that price not bad, anymore than that it's not worth it (full price definitely not worth it). With the buy one get one free they do require that you buy a beverage and all of the cocktails are nine dollars and up so really they end up getting you for $30 a person either way.",

Found the Groupon when looking for things to do in Vegas. The food was actually good, but you do not get much of it. The bar where you get your own sides was constantly empty, they need a server to watch it so that it could be refilled in a timely manner. That pet was annoying but not the worst because even though it was inconvenient you could go up and check to see if more items were put out. The worst part was the meat selection. While being there for more than a hour and half, I only got 2 pieces of thin meat and a chicken leg. There's no reason $70 should be spent and I leave still hungry. We tried to stay a little longer to see if they would happen to come back, but the servers kept skipping our table on purpose. Got 3 refills of the \"endless mimosa\" only after repeatedly asking. The service was so slow, we had to leave before dessert was brought out. Feel I could have went somewhere else and actually been full for the money. The Groupon is an amazing deal if they actually operated the way other steakhouses operate. This place gets a thumbs down. Too many other food choices nearby to waste time here",

They set the price at $71 per person and tell you at the door that they are offering you a 2-4-1 deal to make you think you're getting a great deal.  This place isn't even worth it at what they say is 1/2 price.  Waiter comes to table with a carafe of water and pours everyone a glass of water but doesn't tell you that they charge $1 per person for the water.  You find that out when they bring you the check.  Ordered a glass of house wine at $8 and it was served in plastic.  Yes they used plasticware to serve the wine in.  Ordered a beer, the beer was in a can, waiter places the beer can inside the glass and puts in front of you and expects you to pour your own beer in the glass.  At least the beer glass was made of glass unlike the plastic wine glass.  Waiter brings the check, not in a check folder, just plops the printed check on the table.  I look at check and the recommended tip amount is based on the overpriced $71 per person plus drinks and water.  Needless to say I didn't leave a tip that large.  Placed my credit card with the check, handed it to the waiter.  Waiter hands it back to me and says you need to add the tip.  So waiter stands there and watched as I add the tip.  Because of that tacky move I reduced the tip even further.  I will never return to this place and do not recommend it.  Food was good but service and ambience was lousy.",

First of all, the \"surf\" portion of the buffet is a plate of 6 grilled, then chilled shrimp (yuck), 6 tiny and tasteless mussels, 2 chunks of over-fried mystery fish, and a 2 inch smidgen of what looked like baked fish. Can't comment on the flavor of either of the fish servings, because if it doesn't look good, I don't eat it.  The meat service was slow; you had to yell at the meat carvers to get them to stop at your table, and there were 10, 15 minutes intervals when they would just not come out at all. The meats were salty and tough, with the exception of the rib eye which was ok.  The restaurant itself had a kind of Latin cafeteria / school lunchroom feel to it. Loud, wide open, zero ambiance if you're looking for anything close to romantic or elegant for the $60 per person tab.  Overall, it was an absolutely horrible experience, and keep in mind I say this after eating there for FREE!!! (We got two free coupons in exchange for a timeshare preview.  So, if you too get offered a FREE buffet dinner at Pampas, we suggest you decline. If you're considering paying to eat here...... HAHAHAHAHA!!!",

After being seated we waited 8min. for anyone to take our drink order. We were told to go get our sides first before the meat comes around. Well, we finished our sides and Nobody came around with meat, so I got up and got more rice & beans. Hubby stayed just I case they came around... Finally somebody did come with 2 little 1.5\" sausages left on their skewer. Then another with what looked like the last of the sirloin. After 20min. of waiting I looked around and there was another couple behind us that hadn't even gotten a piece of meat at all. They were dumbfounded by the Zero service attention they were getting. I finally got up and told the waiter about them and then they got some meat bout 5min. later. So, as we are looking around waiting for anyone to come by, I noticed a blonde ponytail with glasses waitress grab a few cherries from the bar with her bare hand and push them down into the pina coladas with her finger. Then a male waiter dirty blonde hair with beard grab olives with his bare hand and drop them into a couple of martinis. When I asked to speak with the manager Daryl, he didn't seem surprised. He did say he was sorry and that he would talk to his waiters. That was all he said. All in all I think we got about 3 slivers of meat and 1 little plate with bout 8 shrimp . Will not be goin back.",

I've been to Rio so I know what a caipirihna should taste like. Meats just not as tender and of the quality that you can find elsewhere. They are just a tad below par on many details of the food.

We took our friend this year, who does not eat red meat and overall it was a decent experience. Only 4 stars though because 1) we were never offered all the meats - maybe only 5 or 6 types rather than the 10+ they promise - and we saw all the meats, they just intentionally ignored our table even though we had the green side up and 2) service was so poor and slow. We were NEVER checked on by our waiter, we actually had to get up and SEARCH for him to get our bill.

If we paid full price, I would've hated the joint (we got a 50% off voucher).  Oh yeah.  It's pricey.  Plan on about $50-$6- per person.  If you've never done Brazilian style dining, it's a fun way to go.  But we won't be going back for seconds...",

This whole thing started when we went to a tix4tonight booth (not my idea) & bought $3 50% off coupons. Decent restaurants in Vegas don't & won't give 50% off (unless you're a high-roller, then you get lotsa freebies!), so right there you know this was a questionable decision.   Service: we had to wait 15 minutes when we had a reservation. We were seated & told to wait...thank goodness my hangry ass took the initiative to get up & start on the salad bar or who knows how long we would've been just sitting...& waiting. Various meats weren't coming around frequently enough. We told the manager (I assume) & to his credit, he really tried to make us happy by checking on us & sending his men wielding skewered meats our way.   I tried the grilled pineapple & picanha style of steak...great caramelization on the beef. Bf tried all the meats & he would give it 3 stars.   Salad bar had the basics; nothing stood out as exceptional. Mozzarella & tomato salad, cheesy bread, & rice w/ feijoada were all 3-stars.   ~ $25/person & I'm mad about every dollar of it! (I told my bf if we'd pay regular price for this, I would've caused a scene.)",

    "text": "I bought a Groupon deal for Pampas Brazilian Grille while in Las Vegas on vacation with my husband.  The deal was the Surf & Turf Rodizio Lunch for two with two specialty cocktails and one desert for $47 (lunch).   We went shortly after the New Year and Las Vegas was still rather busy with tourists so we didn't expect to be seated right away - however - we only waited 10 to 15 minutes and we were led to our seats by a staff member (we later learned that Heather is the manager and she was just lovely to us).  We've been to restaurants similar to Pampas Churrascaria before, and I really do not know what the negative reviews are all about but our experience was nothing short of brilliant.   The food was amazing. Our Groupon included seafood, and everything on our seafood plate was just delicious. My husband is a huge mussels fan and Heather even brought out a bowl of just that - mussels heaven! Instead of cocktails, we had a beer and a red wine. We're simple like that. The servers kept on coming with the meat, and I think my favorite was the pork while he loved everything beef (other than mussels). Our desert was Tiramisu and it was just the perfect ending to our awesome lunch.   Heather was very apologetic for making us wait, but honestly, we were so relaxed that we didn't know why she had to apologize.  Food? Great. Service? Awesome. Customers (Us)? Happy.   I understand that customers cannot all be 100% happy but our experience couldn't have gone any better.  Maybe we just had a better attitude coming in. We already were having a great day and Pampas Churrascaria made our day in Vegas even better.  Some customers just like to complain and I wouldn't let the bad reviews sway you.  I say go and try this place out; try everything (they even have a great salad bar) and come out fully satisfied. Also, know that Vegas gets busy at certain times of the year and so when it is the busy tourist season there - expect a wait. That's just how it is anywhere that attracts so many people each year. If you don't want to wait, go to a small town and eat. Duh.  We will definitely be coming back to Pampas Churrascaria when we visit Las Vegas again.",

We asked our server if she could substitute the shrimp for something else, she said she could bring out salmon instead but someone else brought us shrimp. We reminded her again we didn't like shrimp so she took the plate and said the salmon would be right out. We never received the salmon at all. The drinks took a very long time to get to out table. For the first 20 minutes no meat showed up either. We were just waiting around. We were not impressed with the meats, the best one was the top sirloin, the other were not very good. The salad bar is little but its good. They charge for tap water and the drinks are over priced. Before we left we asked for a discount because of the horrible service and the fact that we never received any salmon. They said they couldn't offer us any discounts but they could give us a free dessert. We just left. We are locals and will not be returning or recommending. Get it together Pampas. Service is everything.  Don't waste your time here.",

I guess we should have heeded the warning signs: got stuck in traffic, couldn't locate it, was directed to a gentlemen wearing feathers and giving out discounted drink & dinner coupons, then as we were getting near the restaurant another gentlemen trying to convince us to \"stop in & try us out\". We should have realized then they were trying too hard to get clientele into the restaurant.   However, putting that aside we were seated shortly after arriving... and waited. Our server had a dismissive attitude and was more concerned about a dirty table needing to be cleared in his section than introducing himself and taking our order. Then after having to repeat our drink order three times he still managed to bring the wrong drink ...not once but twice. Thereafter he was pretty much absent from our table-- --however, very noticeably impatient with another couple as he kept looking at his watch as they tried to decide what they wanted. Towards the end of the meal he did inquire if there was any item we'd like more of and I mentioned the tri-tip which never again came our way.   In spite of the service I was still hoping to have an enjoyable meal. Not. The food was way over-salted and the quality of meat was very disappointing. We also had the option that included the seafood of which their \"go to\" flavor was obviously teriyaki - teriyaki  salmon, teriyaki mahi mahi...  and the shrimp was soft and soggy. They also brought out crab cakes... deep fried, over charred pucks of shredded mystery seafood. Needless to say I didn't even attempt to sample one. Dessert was also included- we opted for the cheesecake however, between the odd tasting crust & the neon green gel-like stuff swirled on the plate after 2 bites my husband was \"done\".  To say we were disappointed is an understatement--and within 5 minutes of leaving the restaurant my stomach realized it needed to purge everything I had consumed. So, we won't be returning ~even if it was offered to us free. Enough said!",

I had never ate at a Brazilian steak house before so I thought this would be a good chance to try. Given the price tag per person, I wouldn't consider eating at one since it is usually an all-you-can-eat meat and I lost my buffet eating capacity a long time ago.  Since we bought a meal voucher, we were limited to 3 choices of meat and to get the all-you-can-eat option, we had to pay extra. Not having the buffet eating capacity, my husband chose a piece of steak and I had the salmon. We could also get items at the side dishes/salad bar for additional food. I thought the selection was good. I had the rice, kale, grilled plantain and pork ribs. I thought they were good.   When we got our main dishes, I thought that my salmon was pretty average. It also came with sides of mashed potato and green beans. With the plate of side dishes that I got earlier, it was plenty of food for me. My husband agreed as well with the food that he got.  Along with our dinner, we got a lemonade and a strawberry lemonade. The drinks were made fresh and they were good. The service that we received was good as well.",

Meat either needed salt/seasoning or was incredibly salty and tough. Salad bar was mediocre at best. Mostly bland pastas. Every person who drinks Water is charged $1. Never heard of this policy before. They do not serve tap but rather fancy filtered water - this was to justify the $1. Buffet does NOT include any dessert but did include sliced watermelon.  They offered a $20 beverage pkg for one hour but took 20 min to get first drink.  Food is WAY WAY OVERPRICED unless you have a voucher to redeem in which case you can upgrade to meat selections for about $10 per person and then still NOT a good value !   Nice wait staff.",

We ordered an alcoholic beverage and were done with 3/4ths of our meal by the time it finally arrived. So glad we bought a Groupon for this place. Definitely NOT worth full price!",

    "text": "We are regulars at Brazilian restaurants! We've been to Pampas before but a first at this location. We bought the tickets at 1/2 price tix and so the cost per person was about 15 dollars less. If any of you are thinking about dining at any Brazilian restaurant in Lass Vegas it's a MUST to visit the 1/2 price tix booth.   The service at the host desk was extremely slow. We had reservations at 5pm and scoping around the rather small dining hall, there were plenty of empty tables. However, the hosts still made us wait about 30 minutes past our reservation time of 5pm.  The food was just okay. The quality of the meat really lacked flavor and good texture. It probably didn't help that the servers who were serving the meat did not know how to cut the meat properly and butchered it.  I would recommend going to Fogo de Chao or another Brazilian steakhouse in town. The prices may be slightly higher but for sure it wouldn't disappoint.",

They had the basics of a Brazilian steak house down. The meats kept coming and the salad bar while small wasn't lacking. The only thing that is a drawback is that they really pack the people in the dining rooms. It's a tight squeeze. All in all not a bad place. Nothing fancy just good food. Fogo de Chao is still my go to but this would be an acceptable substitute in a pinch.",

My favorite was the cheese ball, it was absolutely delicious! Each meat portion may be small but really, you get full so fast that you won't believe it. I had the beef sirloin, chicken wrapped in bacon (so good), chicken leg (a huge one), sausages and more! At the end, there was pineapple too as well as strawberry mint chocolate dessert. I took a few trips to the salad bar to get more cheese balls, and didn't have to worry about missing out on the meat being served because they came to your table really often. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who hasn't tried Brazilian BBQ yet!",

We got the surf and turf which was advertised to come with prosciutto wrapped scallops.  It didn't.  Instead it had steamed mussels that were so small they were hard to find. The shells were all broken so you had to pick out the broken pieces.  The shrimp were a nice size, but you had to peel them, and when you did you found out they were so overcooked that they were just mush.  The salmon had a nice flavor but was also overcooked as was the tilapia.  What does it say about a restaurant that can't cook fish properly?  The meats were just OK.  The bacon wrapped chicken was so dry we couldn't eat it.  The tri-tip was flavorless.  The sirloin was very good.  The pineapple was the best thing on the skewer.  Over all, not a good dining experience.  We have eaten at many places on the strip, many at the miricle mile and have returned often.  We will not be returning to this one!",

The couple next to us raved about the food and especially the meat skewers; they each having ordered the $55 each meat and seafood options. The menu was rather simple - the options being an unlimited meat-only dinner with salad bar for $40, or a meat and seafood option with salad bar for $55, or simply the salad bar for $19.95 each. Being a vegetarian married to a carnivore, the meat-lover in my husband was actually quite fulfilled by the abundance of fish, clams, and calamari on the salad bar, so we each ordered it. The vegetarian in me was very satisfied and surprised with what the salad bar had to offer (and its cheaper price compared to everything else on the menu!); it actually was very similar to a Whole Foods or Wild Oats salad bar - great selection of couscous', feta cheese and olives, salad, etc, in addition to fish and soups. I ate to my full and then some, as did my husband. Though we can't comment on the meat skewers, the $19.95 salad bar was actually worth it (especially with the discount coupon!). This is one of the most expensive restaurants within the Miracle Mile Mall, but one of the most delicious.  Go to Pampas if: You are a carnivore or a vegetarian; you don't mind paying $20 for a fabulous salad bar or $50 for an entree; you enjoy a clean, classy atmosphere; you want lots of meat! Don't go to Pampas if: You are on a budget!",

I went with my bf at the time and I was very excited to take him there and show him what real brazilian bbq was all about.   BIG MISTAKE!  The service was HORRIBLE! The waiter didn't ask us what we wanted to drink at all. we sat there for about 45 mins before anyone even came to say hi.   The green and red system obviously does not work there because we were starving and anxiously waiting for the waiters carrying juicy meet only to realize that they were serving EVERYONE around us but skipping us!  (YES THE GREEN SIDE WAS UP)  They don't have a good variety, the meat was hard to swallow and it was nothing like the franchises in Brazil!  To top it all off, I was dissappointed with the meal but i insisted on dessert because I really wanted my passionfruit mousse! ( I miss this a lot and eat lost of it when I go to Brazil)  The mousse was so sour I could not eat it without making a face! Worst mousse ever!

    "text": "I truly hate to be one of those downers who is writing about their bad experience, instead of the food. But after my recent experience there, I am compelled to write. Sorry for those of you who are only interested in the food. My only regret is we didn't have as good a time as we expected.  More than 15 friends and I all traveled to Las Vegas to celebrate a friend's birthday on May 24. One of the places the birthday girl was excited to eat at was Pampas. She made reservations and everything was set. So we all get there and they kindly accommodate our very large party (20). Everything is going well, the food is not too bad, but before the waiter leaves, the birthday girl asks if he could separate our checks. Sure, he says. Later, she asks him again. Same response. We get our check (which totaled more than $1,000), and they tell us they can't separate the check. The birthday girl asks to speak to a manager. When it came time to confront the waiter about the whole separate checks issue, he calmly says \"No, she didn't.\" So, when we ask the manager to rectify the matter, she says their policy is to charge 15% extra to do so if there are more than three cards being charged. That's an extra $150 just so they could charge us separately -- AFTER we asked them more than once to separate the check. Before this, there was never any mention of any charge. The manager was quite unforgiving and rude. Once we decided to simply put the whole amount on another friend's card, she nonchalantly asks, \"Would you like dessert?\" It wasn't free, by the way. I'd just like to say thanks, Pampas staff, for ruining what would have been an otherwise pleasurable birthday celebration.  We didn't even receive the red/green stick indicating when we'd like our food. Not even 30 seconds passed from the time we sat down with our buffet plates to the time the meat came out. It gave us a feeling of being rushed -- before we were even given the chance to START eating.  As for the food, it was not too shabby. The filet mignon, though, was bland and dry, even though it was quite pink in the middle. Which shouts, \"I've been lying around for a while!\" It definitely wasn't terrible, but not worth traveling from four different states and $1,000 just to be treated rudely. I'd suggest any of the other thousands of other places to eat in Las Vegas that truly understand what customer service is all about. Very, VERY disappointing.  UPDATE: We received an apology from their corporate offices. My friend was even offered a gift certificate for her troubles.",

The service was a bit too slow as there were many times we had the \"green light\" on, but no one came over.. At Fogo you get attacked with servers when the green light is on.  We waited at the bar and ordered a coke before we got a table.. The bartender insisted that we pay our bar tab before we could be seated.. kinda annoying. but once the food arrived i was happy.  Price was $36 for all you can eat Brazilian bbq and salad bar and for Vegas that is pretty good.  Restaurant on the strip aren't cheap so I highly recommend this place..  One strange thing was this enormous fake wine bottle that had the wine menu on it. Not sure what the point of that.. It takes up half the table when it sits there.  Overall, go there.",

    "text": "This was my first time experiencing a brazilian steakhouse. Unfortunately, I was not blown away. While walking up to the entrance, I noticed the greeter passing out coupons to people passing by. When we came up, she asked us if we had reservations. We did. She tried to discreetly hide the coupons and led us to the table. When I inquired about the coupons, she acted very annoyed and was hesitant to hand one over. So what? Just because we already had plans to eat here meant we weren't allowed to get a discount? I did not like her attitude at all.   The waiter was decent, but was not especially helpful. He did what was required, explaining the menu and keeping our water glasses filled.   We were able to go to their buffet for side dishes, and the meat dishes were brought to the table. The side dishes weren't impressive and they were very slow in bringing the meat rodizio around. There were only two guys walking around at a time, then they would disappear, and it was quite a wait in between until they came out with new meat entrees. The food was ok but nothing spectacular, also a little on the salty side.   My boyfriend ordered the meat rodizio while I ordered the seafood rodizio. They brought out a tiny dish with 3 scallops the size of nickels!!!!!!! The salmon and cod were the size of half a deck of cards each, and 3 shrimps on a skewer. I had to order at least 3 orders. I understand that maybe the Gulf oil spill may be limiting seafood choices, but scallops as small as nickels???? For $45??? That was pathetic.  I was ok with a nice dinner in Vegas and we spent what I expected to spend. But I probably wouldn't return to this specific brazilian steakhouse. I might try ones with better ratings. If anything, maybe one that has nicer people.",

If you're a serious foodie, you might have gripes about the food itself, after all, it's still a buffet. But I happen to love buffets... so... I guess I'm no foodie!  I thought it was a great time, the service at Pampas in LV is superb. I got the all you can eat surf and turf for $50 w/ salad bar. The salad bar is blegh, cold and unmemorable.   The meat was good, the seafood was great! I def. suggest getting the SURF and turf, because if all I had to choose from were the meats I'd prob only have given this 3 stars. Alot of the beet was imo overcooked and nothing really stood out. The seafood was delicious though, great catfish and scallops. And I loved the grilled pineapple.   This would be a great thing to do for a special day, or as a vacation treat. It's pricey for any other reason but where else can you have a good time eating?",

    "text": "The price of Pampas varies depending on what time you go and what you get.  You can order stand alone items off their cart, which I've never done before.  I've always tried their rodizio, specifically the meat rodizio.  If you order the meat rodizio, it's similar to an all-you-can eat, although it's not specified as one.    Essentially, you have unlimited access to the salad bar.  The salad bar has plenty of options including every kind of  Brazilian salad under the sun, it seems.  My favorite is the artichoke heart salad.  They also have many appetizer items like cheese bread and fried bananas.  The fried bananas are definitely worth trying.  At your table, the waiters come around your table w/ cuts of meat cooked on a skewer and slice you as many pieces as you choose.  You get to sample steaks, tri-tips, bbq pork, chicken wrapped in bacon, grilled chicken pieces, and sausages.  The bbq pork is especially well marinated and tasty.    I also love that Pampas purposely serves the steak to you rare to medium rare depending on the cut.  In effect, you can't say how you want your steak done -- they just serve it to you how they think you should have it, how it should be eaten.  As a foodie, I believe steak should be eaten rare to medium rare anyway (so you can discern the quality of the cut of meat), so I'm fine w/ that.  But all you ppl who do not know how to eat steak (i.e. you request it well done), don't select the steak option when it comes around.  Hahaha... sorry if I sound mean, but that's how Pampas does it.   Regarding the price, I think it's significantly cheaper to have lunch there than dinner.  Lunch rodizio was only ~$20 per person but dinner was nearly $50 per person.  Granted, I've only had dinner at the Pampas in Palo Alto, CA and not at this one in Vegas, it is of note.    Also, they have an awesome but limited dessert bar (for lunch at least).  The flan and cheesecake are pretty amazing.",

The atmosphere was fun if you sit outside or near the bar because you can hear the half hour rain storm in the Miracle Mile shops. Speaking of where to sit, the inner area near the buffet is more crowded and lit more brightly. We preferred our spot near the bar as it was more intimate. Some Brazilian music would be a nice addition as it was a little quiet.   The food was very tasty and abundant. We had an 11 year old with us and he still qualified for the child's price which was nice because he's not a big eater and the all you can eat rodizios are expensive. He got his fill of cheese rolls which were a big hit!  The buffet had yummy salads and side dishes. The Rodizio we ordered came with an app. and dessert. We chose the mussels in coconut cream sauce which were very good. The tiramisu was lovely as well.   The service was good even in our less crowded spot in the restaurant. The meat coming around on the skewers doesn't stop! The bacon covered scallops were great and the beef dishes were good too. Only the lamb was pretty over cooked and flavorless. The grilled pineapple is a great touch!   We will return for more Brazilian meat fest!",

The salad bar had cold mashed potatoes and an array of bad tasting food. I've been to many Brazilian rodizios, and this was the worst. The guy next to me was given a plate of sirloin... He said I didn't order this and the waiter insisted it was his and said sternly...ITS YOURS. He said he was afraid and better take it haha. A waitress came by and asked me what the table next to me ordered because she wanted to get rid of her tray of champagne...don't they now? When was it my job to listen to the tables nearby--maybe that's why they are so tightly placed. I did ask them and they were like no, just water. But apparently they ordered a sirloin by esp. DONT GO HERE!",

    "text": "I had a great lunch here.  It's basically the same cost as a good buffet, with less variety - so if you want pasta and sushi go elsewhere.  That said, the parade of meats was fantastic.  I tried everything they were serving at lunchtime on the basic meat menu (i.e. no seafood, and the dinner menu is more extensive) and there wasn't anything I didn't like.    The high proportion of pork products was also welcome, as it was Vegas and I was incredibly hungover.  If you didn't know salty fatty meats are the best thing for a hangover (besides a bloody mary) you're welcome!  The following is what I think I had, though there may have been one or two other items I forgot about:  Roasted Chicken - tasty Sirloin - a bit dry Tri Tip - also a bit dry, but tasty nonetheless Sausage - yumm Bacon-wrapped turkey - more please! Chinese pork - just leave the whole skewer Ham - my hangover demands MORE!!  I ate WAY too much, but I guess that's the point.  If memory serves, I didn't eat again until something like 11 hrs later, and I wasn't even really hungry - just thought I should eat before the drinking started.",

Otherwise, if you have a car you should venture out to the restaurants at Rio or find a Texas de Brazil, or In-N-Out. any of those options would be better than here! This place has a very scant meat selection.  To start, we had to wait 15 minutes to get a table in the near-empty dining room. The gauchos who serve the meat were rude and instead of asking us to move our plates, they put their plates down and shoved ours around with the plate. They also mumbled and half the time I wasn't sure what exactly I was eating. And if you get the surf and turf option, they just plop all the seafood from the spear down on to your plate. And the shrimp is still in the shell, so you get to peel it.  The hostesses were very nice, which was one of the only redeeming things. The other was the cheese bread rolls--always tasty.",

Im not sure why the entire back dining room was empty, but when I walked back there and took a picture of the empty room we were immediately seated in that room then others seated after us. Salad bar was well stocked but the floor back there was so slippery you could barely walk around it. Service was really really slow for lunchtime and every meat we got was well done and overcooked. It was much better first time we were there, couple years ago. Shrimp was overcooked, steak was overcooked, ham was dry and over cooked, just all around bad. We most assuredly wont return!",

    "text": "Tried this place with a groupon, which ended up being a pretty decent deal. I can't say the same for paying full price here, but to each his own I suppose. I've been to a few different brazillian steakhouses so this was by no means a unique experience, but it was a mostly pleasant one.  The interior is fairly well decorated, and the location is convenient-- right in the middle of the M shops. Great if you are planning on shopping afterwords, or if like me, you just like the atmosphere and are too cheap to shop at stores like these. The staff was accommodating and seated us without incident.  The salad items aren't bad but some are better than others. The tortellini is ok, the olives are tasty, the artichoke is a nice touch, but the garbanzo salad had a pretty weird flavor. It was just the end of happy hour so I was happy to have a Stella Artois for 3.50.  Then of course there's the actual meat. The kobe fish was different and well seasoned but a bit dry. The shrimp didn't taste much different from any shrimp I've had elsewhere-- I honestly prefer the stuff you can get at Cajun themed restaurants.   There was some \"spicy chicken\" but it didn't seem particularly spicy to me-- although it was delicate and fell easily off the skewer. Most of the meat servers are pretty friendly and will likely give you a double portion of meat if you let them know you really like what they're serving. The lamb was delicate and cooked to a perfect medium rare. It came with a sweet and tangy balsamic sauce that complimented it well. The garlic sirloin was solid, but the seasoned sirloin came out pretty dry and appeared to have been cooked well done. The tri-tip was delectably juicy ( I happen to be a huge fan of tri-tip) but the top sirloin was rather dry.   When the bill came and it was obvious how much we had saved with the groupon, we had no gripes. However, I don't think I would have been as pleased if we had paid full price for the food. The quality of the cuts seems up to par but too many of their offerings were overcooked, and I just wasn't that blown away by the quality here. This place is no Fogo de Chao, but if you have a groupon or other discount deal, it's not a waste of your time to try them out. You'll be stuffed and fairly satisfied with what you get.",

We ask so got the $20 add on all you can drink in an hour. The add on was worth it because their signature drink was very strong, beer and wine was included with that.

The original host passed us to 2 female hostess that was located at the podium of the restaurant. We were seated within 5 minutes outside the main restaurant, although the restaurant was empty. We ordered the salad bar, meats (5-7 different meat) and seafood (only shrimp) and while ordering the 2 hours of unlimited drinks, the server said, please be patient on the drinks as we do not have a bartender and so he would also be making our drinks. We just ordered a pitcher of mimosas to make is easy on the server. The mimosas was about 3/4 orange juice and very little champagne. The salad bar was a joke, the food was all cold (suppose to be hot). Most plates were dirty and the soup was marked wrong. There were some cheese rolls that was so hard. All of the meat that came around was either under cooked or over cooked. The shrimp was still shelled and awful. The server had to be chased down several times. My wife observed them reheating most of the food. We contacted the manager who really showed no concern. It was as though this was not the first time this had happen.  She took off some items off the bill but charged us for items we didn't order. This restaurant is a very bad attempt to replicate Fogo Da Chao.",

    "text": "First time for everyone in our party at this restaurant, used the Groupon for the surf n turf lunch.  Service Horrible service, unwilling to cater to their customers - We asked for the store manager, and a chef who claimed to be the manager came out and explained to our party that Pampas Churrascaria does not care for their customers and their loyalty. Also, they don't really welcome Groupon users, especially the ones, he stated, that come weekly apparently. The restaurant was nearly empty at the time we went since it was a weekday, yet we were rudely dismissed by one of the passing servers after being seated. Thankfully, our designated server was welcoming and attentive... or maybe it seemed so compared to all the other employees we came across before finally being seated.  Food Lunch meat choices are limited to dry chicken, dry&tough picanha, other dry beef choices, sausages & pork (the last two of which I did not try). Seafood was okay. Seafood unlike the meats is ordered through the server, and surprisingly we did not have any problem at all. It included salmon, shark, scallops, and shrimp. Salad bar had a small, but good variety of salads, pasta salads, soups, bread, etc. The pastas were dried up and looked like they had been sitting there for a good amount of time.  Ambiance When I first stepped into the restaurant, I had a good feeling about the place. It is next to the Todai in the Miracle Mile Shops, good location, and decorated well as all or most restaurants on the strip are. The workers looked professional at first glance, and it looked like a nice dining place. My friend and I actually purchased another Groupon to come again while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive. Mistake! I asked Groupon for a refund right after we left!  At such a reasonable price, we wanted to give the place a try, but what a disappointment. I would've given the place a second chance despite its horrible service; however, the food is just not worth it. You get what you paid for, maybe less with this place. Fogo de Chao all the way!",

For those meat lovers that have not been to a Brazilian barbecue, you would be in for a wonderful surprise. Servers bring you skewers of various meats & shave them onto your plate until you say no more. Pampas flavors are superior to other Brazilian barbecues we have visited. Today's visit we had the most wonderful & helpful waitstaff ever! Our waiter was Rigaberto. So patient & understanding. We had a small issue with 2 small boys being ignored by their adults while they raced between tables. I asked Rigaberto to move us if the children couldn't be contained. While we were at the salad bar he talked to the adults & the boys were better for the rest of the evening. Rigaberto also mentioned it to his manager Manny. Manny was absolutely wonderful. He checked on us & the \"situation\" several times & made sure we had everything we needed. We have dined there before but this was our first time with Manny & Rigaberto! They made us know that we will definitely return again and again and again!  Oh by the way...did I mention that the meat was DELICIOUS!!! Tender, juicy, well seasoned & perfectly cooked. The salad bar is chock full of great choices!",

Food was not exactly bad, but no where near the quality and freshness of Fogo de Chao. The service is definitely incomparable. Servers were impolite and lack sophistication. Employees were unfamiliar with meat temperatures, cuts of meat, and menu items. Not a terrible place to eat, but I don't recommend if you are looking for high service.",

    "text": "My husband and I really enjoyed our dinner @Pampas.  We purchased a Groupon prior to our trip to Vegas and was glad we did as this restaurant is spendy.  I am a bargain shopper, especially when we travel.  We were promptly seated and greeted by our friendly server, Jessica.  She went over how the dinner worked, as we had never been here.  I was pleasantly surprised at the selection on the salad bar; I love vegetables!  They had fresh artichokes, mozzarella, pasta salads, fruit, etc.  My husband was hit and miss on the meat; some was overcooked, but nothing to complain about.   Having been in the restaurant industry for many years, I can see through the BS that most customers on here have complained about.  It seems as though the restaurant has coupons all over the place, which doesn't always bring in the nicest of clientele.  The more discounts and coupons offered, the more picky and complaining guests you are going to have.  The table next to us complained about something and the manager comped their ENTIRE meal!  From what I observed, nothing was that bad.  That is not how to get repeat, quality customers.  Apologize, fix the error, buy them a round, but for the sake of the server, don't give away the house.    The best part of our dinner was our server.  Having grown up in WA, Jessica and ourselves had a lot to talk about. Seahawks, Mariners, the crappy rain in Seattle, awesome concerts at the Gorge, you name it.  It is always nice to run into someone who is where you are from when traveling.      We would purchase a Groupon and return again should our travels take us back to Las Vegas.  We will ask for Jessica, hopefully she will be working at some random time in the future!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying any place that has so many coupon users is trying to compensate for something(Insert joke here)  The concept is great, \"Carvers\" come out with various meats on a kabob for you to try in an all you can eat, bring it to your table buffet. A salad bar is available to fill you up*AHEM* I mean to offer vegetables and there is a cart that you can order a special drink that they will make in front of you by crushing... stuff(?) together.  Let me set the stage. Six of us joined together to dine out and this was chosen due to a coupon that one couple had. The coupon offered 50% off our dining experience!(Two for one to be exact so you need even numbers) So for $33 we could enjoy meat and shrimp or for $39 we could enjoy the full surf and turf experience. Now, I'm not a mathematician, but I do know a thing or two about math but 50% off of the menu price of $50 doesn't not work out to $39...? Wait? The SAME meal is $29 at lunch? But hey listen, this was our friends anniversary after all, let's stay in the mood...   Salad bar - Come on, we all know the rules. Don't fill up on the salad! I read that the salad bar is mediocre in previous posts... they were right. A salad bar with no iceberg lettuce... two choices of salad dressing - Italian and something that looked like a mix of Soy sauce and Miso soup. But no worries, I am waiting for the steaks!  BRING ON THE MEAT! The rules of the game were laid out. You get a wooden thingie with red painted on one side and green on the other. Green means \"Bring on the meat!\" and Red means \"Bugger off, I'm full!\" so you rotate it to your desired position. When we started, green definitely meant GO! We were bombarded with \"carver\" after \"carver\" with shrimp, steaks, lamb, chicken with Bacon, scallops... I had to turn my little \"thingie\"over to red within 5 minutes. For me, the excitement kind of ended their... The meat was hard to cut with the dull knives provided. You either got rare or overcooked depending on what side of the table the carver started on and the food was ok at best. Recognizing that people like meats cooked a different way, you would think a carver would ask what the preference was... but I suppose they are just carvers, we should count on our server to help... Uhm.. Server?  When we sat down, we hadn't decided on our drinks yet so our server said he would be back.... he forgot to mention that it could be anytime that night... We were well into our food before I could finally wave him down. After ordering and waiting another 20 or so minutes I walked to the bar and grabbed the already waiting drinks and brought them to our table of cheering lighthearted friends. We didn't see our waiter again until the end of our meal... maybe he was disguised as a carver?  Good thing for the drink table travelling around! Two polite girls asked us what we wanted for a special Brazilian drink. Not knowing what they were saying I said surprise us! They took 15 minutes to make 5 drinks. It was a good drink though, and they agreed with me, tipping their tip jar towards us so we could show our satisfaction at this concoction. Wait, we didn't get a chance to try it yet... maybe come back for the tip? No? okay... here you go...   We were enjoying each others company when a host came up with a camera and mentioned how happy we looked(Maybe she was surprised?) and offered to take our picture for a \"complimentary\" photo. I had been in Vegas long enough to smell a rat and I wasn't shocked when our pictures came out - $30 for the group shot or $20 for the picture of us as couples. Perhaps they saw us coming a long way... they sold two pictures to our friends... My scottish roots came out as I started to clinch my wallet between one hand and my butt-cheek.   The final bill... okay, I mentioned I wasn't a mathematician right? So I had the surf and turf, My wife had the turf and we shared three drinks between us(We would have drank more had our waiter existed) The other two couples had the same, except add one dessert each. So $39 x 6 plus desert, the added 20% gratuity, drinks maybe $8ea x 9 and two deserts for oh, we'll say $9ea = $435.... wait, what!? Our friends did some math on the other side of the table and decided it best to just pay up and enjpy our night... needless to say, I won't be back.   Although the concept is good, turf service and mediocre food at surf prices earned this place every bit of the rating I gave.",

I became more sad to learn that the meats that followed paled horrible compared to the sirloin.  A close second to it would IMHO be the grilled pineapple.

First of all, the benefit of going to a churrascaria is to be able to sample many many different types of meat. I honestly feel like at Pampas, they only have about 5-- that is including the grilled pineapple. None of the meats were top quality like what I've previously experienced and they have no chicken hearts!! Bleh.   We also ordered the seafood option as well and it's pretty much as bad as the meat. The scallops and shrimp were tasteless, ahi tuna overcooked and the rest of the platter left me feeling unappetized.   The pitcher of sangria we ordered can hardly pass for sangria. With no fruits in it and no fruity taste, it fell short of being just cheap wine.  Lucky for us, our friend had a coupon for $100 off. We all ended up paying short of $50 each which is not bad for a churrascaria but I will never come back to Pampas again.",

Several times we sat with empty plates waiting for them to offer us meats or having to ask our waiter to have some sent to our table, and then still had to wait. Their choices for non-alcoholic drinks is very limited. The meats extremely bland and edible at best.  If you have some other place to eat, please do - what you pay for this meal isn't worth the hassle or lack of taste of the meal.  Oh, and they have a gimmick... they offer you a free desert if you give them a review on Yelp, mentioning the waiter's name.  They then didn't have the desert I wanted.  Either way, the food was not worth a free desert.  I just wanted our bill and something with quick service and food with a taste... even McDonald's would do!",

My reasoning behind this is because they didn't have fresh sides that they bring to your table like Via Brasil Steakhouse that came with the buffet. The plantains here looked mushy and old and there were not a lot of dipping sauces for the meat. The meat was okay but in order to enjoy it I think there has to be exciting side dishes to compliment the meal.The side dishes were okay ...I found myself gravitating towards their bread the most. I think the bread was the best thing out of the whole meal!",

When we asked him how big their appetizers were, he said that they were \"very small\" so some people in our group ordered several appetizers thinking they wouldn't be full with just one order. When the food arrived, we were a little upset because the appetizers were not small at all... they were the size of a regular entree!!! And trust me, we eat a lot so it's not like the serving was small and it overwhelmed us. The food was mediocre at best.... Lots of better dining options in Vegas.",

I couldn't disagree more. Marcio was our server, and he did a fabulous job. We loved the salad bar, and the meat was extraordinary. We always had someone at our table offering us everything from bacon-wrapped filet mignon to  roasted pineapple. It was moist and flavorful, and we got plenty to eat.  My husband enjoyed it as well. He is never overly excited by any food we get at a restaurant, but he was still talking about it several days later.  When we were finished, the manager came over and talked to us about our experience to make sure that we had enjoyed it. I would go back again and pay full price. The food was wonderful!",

We found out that we could ask our regular server or our meat server for what we wanted, and if they didn't have it ready right then, they would make it!  We did that with lamb and sausage.    My favorites were the flank steak (which I asked for rare, and they came back when they had some), the chicken legs, and the sausage.  The lamb wasn't cooked or seasoned as well.  My table mates loved the bacon-wrapped chicken breast. and the pork tenderloin  We asked them to char the sausage on the outside for us, and they did it!  They were so attentive and responsive!    They had a decent, but not-as-good-as-some-Brazilian-places side bar with side dishes.  Texas de Brazil has a much better one, but the meats aren't as delicious, and they aren't as responsive to requests.",

But my husband really wanted to try it and we had a coupon, so we decided to give it a go. Boy was I glad we did!   Firstly, our server David was the epitome of professionalism and attentiveness. Just the right amount of attentiveness, not the clawing, overbearing kind. We got the 2 for 1 Rodizio meat and endless shrimp offer. The food was DELICIOUS!! I am not a fan of beef and was mostly looking forward to the chicken and shrimp, but the beef was so tender and perfectly cooked, as were the lamb and pork, I was pleasantly surprised. I desperately tried not to fill up on the main course because I wanted to leave room for dessert, but that plan soon went out the window.   I withhold one star because a) my cocktail was waaay too sweet (I had the caipirinha with vodka instead of rum) - half the sugar would have been perfect, and b) although our coupon saved us nearly $70, in real terms it is quite pricey for a buffet in Vegas.  I'm not sure which restaurant the nay-sayers on here ate in, but the night we dined here not only was the food and service excellent, but the atmosphere was buzzing. The place was packed and there was a long line outside too (just as well we had booked!) I reckon all those people can't be wrong. We will certainly be back to Pampas the next time we are in Vegas, and we're more than happy to recommend them.",

As soon as we came in, the front desk people were talking to themselves and didn't greet us.  I was not impress at first.  However, our server Felipe was wonderful and very attentive throughout our meal, kinda make it up for rudeness of the hostesses.  We would definitely come back.",

    "text": "The restaurant looks very nice, but the service is terrible!  Food is just ok.  We went here because we had a coupon, and we were excited to go because we love Brazilian steakhouses.  Turned out to be a bad choice.  The salad bar was only half stocked, and a lot of items were totally gone and never replaced.  Then we waited for the guys to come around with the meat, and they just didn't come.  The waitress rarely came back to the table, and when she did she noticed they had been skipping us also.  They skipped our whole side of the restaurant for some reason.  They really need a better system, or more guys delivering the meat.  The waitress said she would get them to stop by, but only the sausage guy kept coming by.  We waited for over 15 min. for any of them to come by, and we had our little thing turned to green.  Its too bad because it was close to where I normally stay, and if it turned out good we would always go back.  Not anymore.  I don't think they will last if it continues like this.  With so many places to go in Vegas, you have to step up your game to compete.  The terrible service just makes it impossible to ever go back.  Too much money even with the coupon for such poor service.  It was very disappointing!!",

The meat was un-eatable, it tasted bad, bacon was undercooked, there was only 4 different types of meat, picahana, well that was not picahana.  I've eaten in plenty of churrasquerias in the US and in Brazil, and they should be ashamed of saying they are a brazilian churrasqueria. The salad bar was a joke, Sizzler has a better salad bar, actually you can have better meat at Sizzler.  This has to be the worst place on the strip, and I also got food poisoning.",

He kept looking then took a scanner out of his pocket and acknowledged it then explained the terms of it.  He definitely didn't seem to happy about it.  He asked if we had been before and I tried to explain that Chicago has one kind of like it.  He cut me off then said ok...salad bar is up there.   We were sitting near the bar and had to weave between other tables, waiters, and other guests to get there.   The plates were dirty and the salad bar was sloppy.  The floor is unbelievably slippery.  When we arrived back to our table, there was a very pretty and obviously pricey bottle of spring water on our table. I awkwardly asked the waiter that I just wanted tap water and he said fine and took it off our table.  The meats were ok...some were great, some not.  Two other tables filled next to us while we were there with similar deals and he acted the same.   The poor lady next to us had no clue how the process worked and was asking us because the waiter didn't explain it.   If you want a relaxing and pleasant experience, don't come here.",

Luckily we had a groupon so it cut the price down, but we sat at our table for almost 20 minutes before our server ever came by to take our order and let us know how it worked. ( We didn't know to just go to the salad bar.) WE then ordered our drinks which took another 15-20 minutes. The meat servers were ok, but we had to ask for Pork, and we never got any of some of the other things. Now mind you it was lunch time, so not super busy. I can't imagine how bad it would be if they were busy. servers would just walk right past you and ignore you. We had servers helping people RIGHT next to us and well as just a few tables away. Even some of them complained about the level or lack of service. After over an hour, we finally had to flag someone down and ask them about our dessert we were supposed to receive with our meal, and told them we would need it to go since they took so long. IF I was the owner or manager, I would be taking a hard look at what is happening in my restaurant. FOr as expensive as this restaurant is, the service should be top notch. I get better help at Mc Donalds. Don't waste your time find another Braziliian steak house.",

    "text": "Yeah, so this is a long review... but you'll understand why.  Came with a friend on a Saturday afternoon.  We each had vouchers for a  lunch, just the basic meats, which was fine by me.  I love me some all you can eat anything!  And Brazilian bbq?  What's not to love?  We were pretty excited when we arrived that there were lots of tables open (pretty sure we just beat the lunch rush as it was almost 1:00 when we arrived) so we thought we'd be seated immediately, if not soon.  We were told 15 minutes to wait.  Why?  More than 75% of the place was free and there were more than enough employees walking around chit chatting.  Several were obviously servers that were standing in the corner talking, hostesses standing at the front with menus but not seating anyone.  So we wait.  Moments later, a small party comes in stating they have reservations for 1:00 for 5 people.  I overhear the hostess tell them that they had to wait 20-25 minutes for their table to be ready.  REALLY?  What was the point of making the reservation?  1:30 rolls around and they finally seat us. (30 minutes later.) The party with reservations gets seated 15 minutes after we do in the same section that hardly had anyone seated.  SUCKS SO FAR.  (For them too, I'm sure.)  As we're seated, the hostess tells us our server will be there in a moment to take our drink orders.  20 minutes later, our server walks by as he's saying \"Hi, I'll be right back to take your drink order\" as his voice fades with him walking away.  We get no chance to say anything.  All we wanted was water.  Come on.  I say screw it, let's start at the salad bar.  (Oh yeah, none of the meat has come to our table yet, 30 minutes seated with no service?) however we see the guys walking out of the kitchen and taking it to another section of the restaurant that seems to be getting much more attention than the side we were on.)  We make it back from the salad bar, and still no water.  Server arrives another 10 minutes later to take our drink order.  2 waters.  Another 10 minutes and the first meat guy comes around.  2 pieces of sirloin (one for my friend, one for me, wasn't bad at all) was all get got until the next guy came around 10 minutes later.  (It took our server another 15 minutes to bring us the waters from taking the order.)  Overall, we arrive before 1:00 and don't leave until about 3:50.  One glass of water (server never refilled) and 6 pcs. of meat for each of us.  Averaged 15-20 minutes to get a piece of meat.  To top it off?  I had a voucher which the server insisted he knew which to take as he does it all the time with these vouchers.  Now, our vouchers were attached to our bus tour vouchers.  I asked him if he was sure he had the right one.  Dude gave me a look of attitude and said \"Look, I do this all the time, don't worry about it.\"  MISTAKE.  I go outside where our tour bus stop is (Thank you lord that is was right there) and as I try to get on, the guide tells me I have the wrong vouchers.  So I go back to the restaurant.  Hostess ignores me as she stands there looking at a piece of paper.  Another hostess walks up and fianlly asks if she can help me.  I let her know that the server took the wrong voucher and I couldn't get on my tour bus.  She says she'll speak with the server and check with him.  She comes back with an attitude, as if I'd accused them of something totally crazy, telling me that the server was sure he took the right one.  Our server never came out and the hostess was about to just brush it off.  I asked to speak to a supervisor who FINALLY came out.  I believe her name was HEATHER, or something close to it.  I gave her the same details, she came back with the same answer.  The server took the right voucher.  I asked to see the voucher he took, and after rolling her eyes and sighing outloud, she said hold on and walked away.  She came out this time with the actual receipt and vouchers the server took.  Low and behold!  SERVER TOOK THE WRONG VOUCHER.  I told her the one she had was the one I needed.  She insisted STILL that she had the correct one.  I had to finally take a stand and get a firm with her and said \"LOOK!\" And pointed to the print, details, etc. to prove that they took the wrong one.  When she finally realized it, she looked at me again, rolled her eyes, then still had the nerve to ask me, \"So this is the one you need?\"  WTF?!?!?!  I tell her yes please, she tears off the voucher off the receipt and as I'm doing to same to give her the correct one for her records, she snatches it out of my had, doesn't say another word, and walks away.  No \"sorry for the mix up\".  No \"sorry for my attitude as well as for the attitude of my employees\".  No \"sorry you missed your tour due to our incompetence\". No \"Thanks from saving us from an issue!\"  JUST DON'T GO HERE UNLESS YOU WANNA BE RIPPED OFF AND TREATED LIKE CRAP.  ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY LOVE TO GIVE ATTITUDE.  I wonder if that's why their service is so bad, their management is terrible!",

I got a groupon so the bill was not as hurtful but it was still astronomically expensive for the poor quality in presentation, taste and preparation of the food. First, the salad bar choices were so poor. Not enough variety and the quality and presentation was lacking (wilted lettuce, fruit platters not pleasing to the eye, etc). Second, the main room arrangement is really uncomfortable, we were very close to the tables next to us and the servers seemed contracted and tight, made the experience tight and rushed. Third, the meats were OK. The picanha was the only worthy meat cut other than that everything tasted like beef shoulder. The seafood was nasty and I was not able to hold my salmon down. Never got the chance to try the mussels or shrimp after I got sick but my mother tasted them and she said it was not pleasing at all and that she did not understand the surf and turf concept with is NOT brazilian. The only positive about this place is location, inside a beautiful created Italian Backalley in Planet Hollywood. However, I would not recommend this place and certainly would not return. Sorry!",

    "text": "Being the carnivore that I am....you would think this place would automatically get at least three stars from me...but there is definitely a problem when I prefer the salad bar over the meat offerings.  I went here for a wedding reception, and we were offered the basic meat menu of chicken, bacon wrapped chicken, sirloin, tri tip, chinese BBQ style pork, pork sausage, ham....and grilled pineapple.  Unfortunately, the pineapple was the highlight of their grilled goods.  The bacon wrapped chicken was moist, but nothing special.  The chicken without the bacon was flavorless, as was the sirloin and tri tip.  The chinese BBQ style pork had a nice sweet flavor with a hint of five spice, but again nothing that special.  Overall, if you are going to pay the regular price for this menu, it's better to take your money over to Fogo de Chao or Texas de Brazil....they have more meat options with more flavor as well.  The salad bar is also much more limited than the other brazilian churrascarias in town....the bananas are lack luster in that they are really just bananas with a crunchy coat on the outside.  The highlight of the salad bar was the chinese broccoli and the roasted mushrooms.  Everything else seemed like cafeteria food to me.  I wouldn't go here even if I did have a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> or groupon coupon....",

    "text": "Man, Pampas sucks. So they started serving breakfast recently, and I got a hold of a coupon for $6.50/person. It seemed like a really good deal at the time, so I talked the fam into going. Which I completely regret doing cos I don't talk the fam into doing many things, and this time that I did completely sucked, and now I feel guilty that I did. =\\  For one, our waiter was whack. My mum and brother had never done rodizio before, so they weren't sure what was going on. But at least they had BF and myself to explain. Any other noobs would've been completely lost. Cos not only were we seated for a pretty long time before our waiter came, when he finally did make it around to us, he did a poor job of explaining everything. Keep in mind this is morning time, with just one other table occupied besides ours. I couldn't help but watch this guy do nonsense stuff while we were just left hanging. Time after time again. I'm a lot more keen on waiter-behavior now, after doing my own time waiting tables.  The meat servers were...okay. They were definitely nice enough. But they just didn't have skills. Remember when I talked about Texas de Brazil meat servers looking unhappy? Well happy or not, I didn't get to appreciate their skills at cutting meat until seeing Pampas guys cutting meat. Watching these guys was so, so awkward. They were going for thin slices but then were only able to cut so much at the width they were cutting... It just seemed like such a process, whereas at Texas, voila--big chunka meat. The tables are also kinda small, so the servers would kind of have to cram in at the corners, and we were asked to move things around for them a few times.... Awkward.  The food itself was blah. It reminded me of what you might find at a cheap hotel's complimentary breakfast. You can def find better breakfast food at any other breakfast buffet in town. And what's up with that top glass that goes so far out, you have to crouch, stick your head in, and reach for inner items? Awkward. The breakfast meats included picanha, or 'beef' as we were told, ham, breakfast sausage, and some other sausage, ranging from substandard to standard. The best thing was definitely the grilled pineapple. Although the first time it came around, it was just normal pineapple. But the second time it came around, it was fresh off the grill, and that was absolutely delicious. It was the one and only good part of this whole experience. Oh, wait. $3 mimosas aren't bad either.  But to top off the bad, I'm pretty sure they overcharged us. And it sucks cos my mum is one of those who just hands over her credit card without looking at the check. I wonder how we're so deep in debt.... I even got reprimanded for being so stingy/skeptical when I mentioned something about the total being more than expected. Hey, I just like to know where my money's going. So I think it might've been that they didn't have a button or whatever to calculate this coupon we had, and they ended up just charging us the full price ($12.95) for three people instead of the $6.50 for four people. That's a difference of $12.85. I blame that waiter of ours. Bastard.",

    "text": "Pampas is a Brazilian steak house located on the South side of Planet Hollywood.  In short, it's a decent alternative for hungry carnivores who are tired of buffets.  If you haven't been to a churrascaria, it's an all you can eat affair where there's a nice salad bar and a few side dishes - but instead of a buffet, the staff bring large skewers of meat around to your table.  Most places have a signal (like a coaster) that says \"more please\" or \"I'm still chewing\".  I guess I'm spoiled by Fogo de Chao.  I have visited the DC location several times and it has become a favorite stop for me and many of my traveling buddies.  Pampas is the same concept, except executed with value in mind.  Said differently, Target and ShopKo are both variety stores, but I'm pretty sure most people would much rather go to Target if given a choice.  Pampas is the ShopKo here - a little less quality, a little cheaper, and a lower atmosphere factor.  The meat is OK - certainly comparable to the stuff served at Outback or any other chain restaurant and is a little over seasoned.  The preparation is good, but not great.  The salad bar was pretty fresh and had a reasonable variety.  We were seated quickly and reasonably well attended to by the friendly staff.  We had to wait a bit on some of the meats, but not enough to complain about it.  The convenient location is nice, as are the short waits.  I'm on the fence with the stars here.  Certainly, I could go 3 in terms of overall quality and experience, but it's the value quotient here that leaves me cold.  If you can score this for $25 - it's an easy 3-star experience.  If you get suckered in for $40, then it's a bust down to two stars.",

Ages to get someone to take a drink order and then serve our drinks.  In addition, they are extremely stingy with the meats and you have to keep requesting service to get someone to bring you more meats. We never saw half the meats the waiter described. The salad bar was OK, nothing to write home about.   You are better off going to Fogo De Chao or Texas De Brazil.  This is a poor imitation.",

I used to recommend this place to everyone as a must go to, and now definitely the opposite. We went there this past weekend while we were in Vegas, and the service was just bad. The whole point of this experience is for the meat cutters to come around offering you a variety of meats throughout your meal that they slice right in front of you. They're supposed to come by often, this has not been the case. We had to complain to the manager because the meat people did not come often and the server ignored our request to send the meat people are way, and the manager failed to do anything to fix the problem. When the meat finally started coming around it was overcooked, dry, and tough. If you're looking to try a Brazilian restaurant avoid this one definitely not the place.",

The restaurant was not properly staffed nor prepared to open for the morning. The food was on par with other Brazilian style restaurants I have been in and the prices were most definitely the same, however I have never had poorer service. Our server was rude. She told us the water, $1 per person did not give us a chance to say whether or not we wanted it and was pouring it. We should have left at that point.   When we got to the food clear across the restaurant condiments such as syrup were not out yet. One in our party asked our server for syrup upon returning to the table and she promptly told her \"it is at the buffet, I do not have time to go get it for you, you will have to go get it yourself.\" Nerver has a server ever refused a request in any high end restaurant I have been in.   The meat coming out was s l o w. Only had 1 person running 3 types of meat. Our table, 1 of 3 at that time only saw him 1 time until we were finished by then they added 2 other people to serve.   Worst experience, we never went back the week we were in Vegas good food but dont waste your time go up the way to the other restaurants they know how to serve, and it will save you some money.",

    "text": "Came here todays brunch with my boyfriend and all I can say is that I was disappointed. Here are the pros and cons of our visit.  Staff: We had a very nice waitress and everyone who brought out food was kind as well.  Wait time: We had a reservation for noon and we were seated writhing 5 mins. Excellent timing.   Salad bar: WAY BETTER THAN TEXAS DE BRAZIL  Surf n Turf: My boyfriend was happy with his seafood. I don't quite like seafood so I stuck to the meats only.  Rodizio: Worst disappointment ever. We had heard excellent things about this restaurant but we did not see anyone bringing meat for an average of 15-25mins at a time. We told the waitress that we wanted to see more of the beef selection come around. She was very nice and put that request in for us. However, I don't think that it was okay for me to wait 2 HOURS to only see the beef come around 3x. This is where Pampas is going to start losing business and customers. For an extra $20-30 we could have gone to Texas De Brazil or another Churrascaria and have our plates loaded with their selections of beef.   I understand if it was a busy day for them, but there were not that many people in the establishment for us to be waiting 2 hours for beef. No excuse.  The beef was good but very rare. Won't complain about that. It was mouth watering! Just wish we could've seen more come around. I understand that there were only 2 beef options for brunch but at least let me see them!!!!! Lol!  Honestly, as much as I enjoyed their meat (the 3x it came around) and salad bar, I will probably not come back again. I am very disappointed.  I wasn't even full when we left..  what's the point of lying $22 for the parade of meats when you only see the meats once almost every half hour??  I'll stick to Texas De Brazil.  Sorry, Pampas. But you guys need to step it up!!  EDIT: It's now 11:12PM and I am feeling sick to my stomach.. I hope I didn't get food poisoning..",

They pour water and then tell you there is a $1 per person water charge 2. The lay-out of the restaurant is awful - if you are in the center of the restaurant you are so crammed in - you might as well be best friends with the person next to you / the walkways to the back (where the salad buffet is) - are so narrow you nearly run into those going to the restroom; others going to/from and even the servers going to the back down a side hallway - we were seated all of 5 feet from the entrance (and we had a reservation) which was laughable because they had us \"wait while they get our table ready\" and there was only one other couple seated in the round rotunda type area 3. they advertise 13 different table side meats (and pineapple) we were offered 8 and we had to ask for the last three (I like to keep a small bite of each meat to reference in case I want to go back - so when the manager came over - I pointed out each one and that we were offered Tri-Tip, Filet, bacon wrapped chicken and sausage multiple times) 4. The meats were BLAND (except the garlic sirloin or whatever red meat it was - and it was all garlic.) One of the ones they brought after we asked was Pork Tenderloin and that one was the ONLY one we actually liked (no ribs, no filet crusted in cheese...). 5. There were many times were sitting there waiting for something to come around however, on the flip side of that, the moment we sat down with our salad (from the very crammed salad bar area) they started coming with the meats even though the paper toggle we had on the table was set to red so they served it onto our salad plate 7. At the end, Our waiter actually said to us - after running our CC to pay - that \"cash tip is preferred as it works out better in my favor\"  They do lots of Groupon/coupon offers, I heard the waiter explaining what the coupon/groupon covered multiple times... and I can see why - no one would want to go back so they need all the business they can drum up.",

From start to finish, Tyler was fully invested in making sure that we were attended to and that we were made fully aware of our different options on the menu. Despite being busy with different tables to serve, Tyler patiently made us feel as if though we were an individual priority. I mean really, this guy's humor and kind spirit is a rarity. After figuring out that we were celebrating my mother's birthday from January, he surprised us all with a small, birthday cake for my mother.  My mother was moved to tears (as you can see in the picture). When we return to this restaurant in the near future, we will request to have this incredible man as our waiter.

    "text": "Don't waste your time or your $30 per person! The greens bar is inadequate compared to similar places like Texas de Brazil or Fogo de Chao; it's more akin to a continental breakfast with no good cheese or meats and zero seafood (you'll have to pay extra for that, naturally!) The plates are dirty and the feijoada and rice wasn't refilled in a full hour. Also, the meat service -- the whole reason you come to a restaurant like this -- is literally nowhere to be found.  In the 15 minutes since we sat down and got salad, the gauchos showed up only once to serve small pieces of pork. Compared to other churrascarias, where you'll practically be bombarded with meat, the dining room is a ghost town!  Other Brazilian steakhouses will wait in line to give YOU meat. Here, you'll easily wait 15+ minutes between cuts of meat. When we asked for faster service, the meat started coming out rare, indicating they were rushing things or maybe low on capacity. Did you come to this steakhouse for steak? Too bad, you won't get any -- much less the CHEAPER sausages, chicken or other cuts that other churrascarias start with to fill you up!  Also, they have a photographer going between tables and promising \"free\" photos. Of course, they're free to take, but cost big, big money to buy! This wasn't very professional and, though Vegas is admittedly a huge tourist destination, you won't find this at a Fogo or TDB.  Ultimately, if you'd like to leave hungrier than if you'd had a $2 box of Special K at home, come here. If you'd like to blow $30 per person for $10 worth of meat max, come here. But if you want to experience a True Brazilian steakhouse, one that rewards your time and money, skip this overpriced tourist trap and head to Fogo de Chao. You won't regret it.",

Like others, we went in because of the coupons they were handing out all over the place and thought it might be fun for our teenage kids.  Service was marginal, took way too long to get drinks.  Salad bar is nothing special.  Of the meats, the sirlon was the only thing that tasted decent - not great, but decent.  The other meats were not that good.  Without the coupon, this place would be significantly overpriced for dinner.  Wish I had read the reviews before we visited,  this is not a spot we would go back to again.",

All I can say is WOW!!  Your meal comes with a delicious brazillian buffet style salad bar which includes things like fried plantaines and other things you do not normally find at buffets. The best part of the meal is yet to come so dont eat to much off of the buffet. The waiters then start to bring around a parade of scwered meat. Parmesean crusted fillet mignon, bacon wrapped turkey, roast beef, spicy chicken, tri tip, Etc. The best part is that they cut it directly off the spit and put it on your plate. This was some of the best meat we had ever eaten. And towards the end of the meal they brought out a fresh grilled pineapple. This was amazing. You just eat until you are done and then flip the top you have at the table over so it is red as to say STOP WITH THE PARADE OF MEAT!!  If you leave the green side up they will continue to offer you more and more and more. If you are coming to vegas i would recommend this if you are a meat eater.",

    "text": "Worst restaurant I have ever been to, the food is mediocre but worse service simply cannot be found anywhere else.  My party of 11 had reservations for Pampas....even so, it took them more than 45 minutes to get us our table.  Most waiters look forward to large parties - lots of potential for tips - however ours avoided us.  The menu has some good offerings on it.  However, because it had taken so long to seat us and our waiter was not being attentive, most of us ordered the salad bar because we were running short on time.  Irritated that the majority of the party was not ordering the most expensive thing on the menu (keep in mind, we were a group of well dressed, well-to-do people), the waiter began collecting up rodizio plates from the table as loud as he possibly could, as if being passive-aggressive would put more time on the clock for us.  We then pointed out that he'd failed to take the meal orders from three of the people in our party, which irritated him further.  He mistakenly collected a rodizio plate from one of the party who ordered the meat rodizio (the all you can eat meat) and when the diner informed him that he shouldn't have taken the plate away, argued with the diner for 5 minutes before checking what he himself had written down for the meal order.  The food at the salad bar was decent - good variety and mostly well done, and does a good job as light fare.  The people who were most disappointed were those who ordered the all-you-can-eat meat.  The menu said it was a \"neverending parade of meats\".  In actuality, they were not served for 20 minutes while the rest of us were eating from the bar, and neither was anybody else in the restaurant.  The manager stopped by to ask if people were getting their meats, to which we told him no, not in the past 20 minutes.  I'm guessing he chewed out the wait staff, because a slow trickle of the rotiserrie spear holding waiters slowly started making their rounds, albeit it was far from being a \"neverending parade\" and all of the servers appeared sour and grouchy that they were being made to work.  Most would come by, cut off one small slice, and walk off leaving my friends sitting there trying to flag them down for more.  As for the meat itself?  Nothing special.  Most of it was overcooked.  The bacon wrapped turkey was good, but how often is bacon-wrapped anything bad?  Overall it was very disappointing for the price tag, and the people who were most satisfied were those who just got the $19 salad bar because they were either not hungry or in a rush to leave.  Funnily enough, they have red and green markers to be put on the table, green to sign servers to bring more meat, red to tell them that you're full.  The diners in my party that ordered the all you can eat meat finished dinner hungry and turning the markers to red just so that we could collect our checks and continue with our night.  As for the rude waiter?  He was delinquent in refilling our drink orders (and 11 people on their way to a club can order a lot of drinks) to the point that on more than one occasion members of my party walked to the bar to order drinks.  When we asked him to split our checks, he became visibly irritated with us.....lets see, a group of 11 people, four couples and some single guys, why would separate checks with the mandatory gratuity added NOT make sense?  Not many 28-30 year olds pay for 10 friends to eat at an expensive restaurant like this...  The waiter then went around the table and argued with every one of us about our drink orders (which wasn't much thanks to him being AWOL).  15 minutes later, he tosses down the drink bill and basically said he made no effort to try to break it up.  In the end, the one thing our waiter did right was not add gratuity to both the food bill and the drink bill.  Everybody in my party of 11 gave him exactly what he earned and deserved for his tip: $0.00 .  If you're looking for all you can eat and quality, go to the buffet at the MGM Grand or the Aria.  If you're looking for bad service, go to Dick's Last Resort - their bad service is at least entertaining and their prices are more reasonable (and quality of food is sadly comparable).  There is no reason for anybody to ever eat at Pampas.",

The best Brazilian grill we have been to is Texas de Brazil on South Las Vegas Blvd. in the Town Square Shopping Center. We should have gone there but we had a coupon and thought why not. Well, this is why not. The quality of the food is sub-par and the service was substandard, too. Our waitress was inexperienced, unprofessional and had quite the bad attitude.  My husband, my son and myself went for a late Father's Day dinner. My son ordered the Seafood Rodizio, my husband the Meat Rodizio and I the salad bar only. The seafood rodizio took at least 25 minutes after we ordered to be brought to the table. What a disappointment, 3 small scallops, 1 fishy-tasting salmon fillet, 1 breaded piece of cod and 4 grilled shrimp. Our waitress informed my son she had put in another order for the seafood and when it came about 30 minutes later it was the exact same thing. No choices you get what you get and not what you would expect for the prices they charge. After my husband was done the servers finally started bringing out the Fillet Mignon, a little too late.  Please learn from our mistake and do not waste your money in this restaurant, even with the coupon we still paid $80 with no dessert and no drinks.",

The service was fantastic and the goucho's were great about asking what specific cuts we wanted and bringing those over and over.  The salad bar is great...while neither of us ate much from it...the Caesar salad was great with a hint of anchovies.

I ordered the smoked salmon platter, which, according to the menu, came with cream cheese and a bagel, along with the normal toppings like capers and onion.  Pretty standard, right? When my meal arrived, however, it actually came with not a bagel, but a MINI bagel.  I'm not exaggerating, the bagel was approximately the same width as the sliced romaine tomato. Considering it was a $10 breakfast, I expected a normal-sized bagel.  Or at the very least, it would have been nice for our server to warn me in advance. Oh, and there was a 20 minute wait to be seated even though the restaurant was not busy at all, and it took us about an hour to get out of there once we were seated because the service was incredibly slow.

More langoustines, more requests for lobster, more langoustines.  More complaints and finally two lobster tails arrived -- 75 minutes after we sat down.  The inedible ahi tuna (overcooked), scallops wrapped in almost uncooked bacon and a dish of muscles where half were unopened was also included. The manager, Bill took the time to speak with us as he remembered us from previous year's, he truly felt that there was no deception involved with the the lobster tails not being True \"lobster\" as had been served the previous 2 New Year's Eves.

The lamb was a little dry, but there is some dressing that was kind of like a chimichurri sauce that really went well with the lamb. There is also a salad bar with some tasty offerings.

We were finally taken to a \"table\" off the bar whose top sat lower than my knees. WTF?!?! Who eats a \"parade of meats\" at a coffee table? Once we got past the troll at the gate and came to terms I was going to be dining with my elbows on my thighs, the service was great and all of the meat I had was incredibly good. The side bar dishes were hit or miss with some being absolutely wretched. It may be a cultural thing, I'm not sure, but if you have \"roasted peppers\" at the bar and I take a lot (because I love me some roasted peppers) I shouldn't be forced to spit them out and leave the rest for the garbage bin because they've been unnecessarily pickled in something weird. All this for a crazy unreasonable price.   Never going again, and neither should you.",

I love their salad bar, the meat has always been wonderful and this last time we did the all you can drink Caiparihnas for $20 for an hour...   trust, me I got my $20 worth and the woman who comes around with the Caiparihna cart and makes them table side is AWESOME in a million ways.  LOVED HER!  I love this style of eating so much that I always wanted to try Fogo de Chao, so last year we went there for my birthday (with the same friends who came to Pampas with us in March) and we were ALL so unimpressed.  People keep telling me how awful Pampas is and how great Fogo is and I think they are crazy.  I will continue coming back to Pampas.  Love this place.    GET A COUPON!!!!",

Had a groupon deal & it included the surf & turf, hot & cold salad bards, 22$ toward drinks and dessert. Everything was delicious & fresh. We ended up putting the 22$ toward a bottle of wine, had the Riesling & it was SO tasty. We told the waiter we didn't want too dry of a white & he suggested the perfect thing. The hot & cold salad bars have plenty of options so everyone will find something they like. Make sure you have the fresh mozz with some kalamata olives to the side! Yum yum!   The reason I knocked one star off is that the guys who brought around the meat seemed to just keep going back to the same areas. They rarely came by our table & our waiter had to keep asking the different guys to come by with stuff for us.   Overall, everything was very tasty & staff is very friendly. I will definitely be returning on my next Vegas trip!",

When we asked what the delay was, we were told that \"someone crossed our names off the list and that we would be seated immediately\"; it was another 15 minutes before we were sat, pushing the time to nearly an hour after our reservation.   The customer service? It was TERRIBLE. We saw our waitress 3 times in an hour and half, waited for water and drinks with empty glasses on multiple occasions, and we're treated with disrespect when asking for the kind of service one would expect when paying  $50+ for a meal.   As for the food, by far worse than anything I would have ever expected. EVERY single meat was tough and overcooked. Even the meats that appeared to be cooked medium rare to medium were as tough as leather. The \"steamed\" shrimp were ice cold, and the oysters were undercooked, salmon was okay, and the spicy sausage was really the only thing I can recommend. Cheesecake was pretty good as well.   We also found a massive black hair (see picture) on one of our plates that did not belong to any of our party members. We then asked 3 different servers to see a manager, and 15 minutes later, the manager said \"oh, sorry\" and walked away and was never to be seen again.   The bathrooms were repulsive and looked as though they hadn't been cleaned in multiple days.   I am not sure if this was a fluke, but I would hands down never recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy.   @PampasLasVegas",

I saw they had an all you can drink for one hour, which was 20.00.  Would have been the price of two drinks, which would have been a good deal. But we were not much in mood for drinking.   One thing the waitress Informed us was that we had to purchase 2 beverages , (does not have to be alcoholic ). I did not see that on the coupon, so that was strange.

    "text": "Let me first just put an asterisk to this review....*The one-star rating is in no way a reflection of the waitstaff of this restaurant!  They were all amazing and obviously have become experts with \"working what they have.\"  The first impression upon checking in for our reservation-utter confusion.  I'm not quite sure what was wrong with their reservation system, but it was definitely not working properly OR it just sucked.  It seemed that there was some confusion of who to seat first, the folks that were on the walk-in waiting list or the folks that had booked a reservation.  My husband and I had a reservation, but still waited 30 minutes to be sat at a table, and then waited another 15 minutes before being approached by a server.  The manager who was very visible just seemed to be busily walking back and forth but didn't appear to really do anything.  For those who have never had the pleasure of dining at a Brazilian Steakhouse, the way it usually works is there's a salad bar full of side dishes and then waiters come around and carve freshly cooked meats at your table.  When our drink orders were finally taken we approached the salad bar.  Most of the items looked extremely thirsty like it had been sitting out for a while, and this place was super busy!  The lettuce for the salad wasn't wilted but still looked extremely dry.  Mashed potatoes had that yellowish \"skin\" formed on it.  The one form of salami that they had tasted borderline bad.  The cheese plate was all poured together with no care what-so-ever.  The Brazilian cheese rolls which most Brazilian Steakhouses are famous for were dry and tasteless.  When the meat (the whole reason, in my opinion, that you pay almost $50 a person for) finally arrived to the table it was a total disappointment.  The first dish was garlic sirloin.  It was so tough I couldn't cut it into pieces small enough to eat.  My husband's piece was horribly rare and also tough.  The next dish was leg of lamb which is the whole reason I took my husband here.  It literally resembled shoe leather, and like the last dish could barely be cut with a steak knife.  I really really hate to complain while dining at a restaurant especially while on vacation, but this was just a horrible experience that I was about to pay top dollar for.  When our waiter came to check on us, we showed him the state of the meat that we received thus far.  He, of course, apologized profusely and set out to make things right for us.  He got us clean plates and called over some waiters with different cuts of meat one of which said that he saw the leg of lamb we complained about, and agreed that there was no excuse for that.  The new meats were still only fair, to be honest, but at that point, I just wanted out of there.  We paid our full bill and left.  The manager at this point was nowhere to be found, so whether or not anyone told him about our complaints is anyone's guess.  My husband and I have been to this type of restaurant several times in several states.  None of them have had meats of such poor quality, in my opinion.  The whole point of going to a Brazilian Steakhouse is because you want well-prepared meats.  Someone needs to tell whoever is in charge of purchasing the meat in this restaurant to aim a little higher.  My cats eat better food than what was served to us tonight.",

When we approached the hostess we asked if we were able to use our total rewards rewards credit towards our meal as we had accumulated a few hundred dollars worth of reward credits.  She politely said yes and say us promptly when we presented our platinum total rewards card.     As we began service we ordered drinks as it was one of the requirements of the coupon and has waters all around.  Food options were okay as there were 12 options of meat along with unlimited shrimp skewers.  Unfortunately the meats were all dry and very bland.  When we asked for some seasoning they failed to deliver us any side seasoning for the meats.  We continued our meal and when our check came the check stated suggested gratuity with 20% calculated but the server stated that there was an auto gratuity added to our check due to our party size.  This did not sit well as the check clearly stated suggested gratuity and not auto gratuity or service charge.  On top of that they charged us for water which was tap water.  I would not recommend this place to anyone and to beware of their False advertisements of the use of total rewards reward credits and malpractice of suggested tips.    In all honesty I could have made better steak meats with much better flavor from my apartment than the meats they served.    Definitely a horrible place to be in the miracle shops of planet Hollywood.",

We told him not yet so he stepped in and took over our table.  Waseem made wonderful recommendations and was on top of everything as far as our order goes.  Our drinks never got half way and the dessert he recommended was amazing! He is by far one of the best waiters I have ever had!!!  Definitely come here and ask for Waseem.",

    "text": "I have worked at planet Hollywood for years but have never been up here. Someone suggested that they had a pretty good variety of meats so we decided to give it a try since there was a groupon. So for 79$ you get all you can eat surf and turf( meat and seafood) the consisted everything from sirloin to lamb. Then the surf part which consist of mussels, shrimp salmon and tilapia? Comes on a separate plate. I can't rave too much on the food because some of the meats were quite dry but I did like the shrimp and sirloin. The salad bar was decent  with a variety of vegetables and hot dishes.   So an alcoholic beverage is included in the deal, I got a chinahuia (sp?) with pineapple, lime and tequila. Not too bad; definitely my  kinda drink. The hunny had a rum runner and it was poured much heavier than my drink.   So overall, it's an okay restaurant but for the same price I would go to texas de brasil. They have much better meat. Marcile was our server tonight and he was running around because his section was split, which I understand because I've worked in restaurants.  I was hesitant coming here because of all the bad reviews that I saw. But it wasn't as bad as anticipated.",

We ordered our drinks and it took 30 mins before I received my Arnold Palmer after complaining to the manager.  When Stephen finally brought it, there was no apology or explanation.  I was charged $2 for water but could never drink any since I had to get 3 different glasses before I finally got a clean on at the end of my meal.  Asked for the manager to complain about water fee but he never showed.  Paid the bill with no tip of course and left feeling annoyed and frustrated.  I was hoping for such a better time on my anniversary.",

Strong :)  The reason for 4 stars this time is most of the meat that came out was more on the medium to well done. I like more rare. One of the servers Fabricio was very nice and said he would make some rare for us. He came out with some rare Filet Mignon he made just for us, it was amazing!!! Thank you Fabricio!  Wonderful service!!  We love the roasted pineapple too that he came around with!!  Ended our meal with a Tiramisu that was so Good!! It was delicious!!! (Got that just for doing this review!

They have one beef based meat to choose from, then lots of cheaper cuts filling in the rest of the rotation. I felt sorry for the \"roasted ham\" guy, going from table to table, begging people to take a slice of ham from him.  The chicken was tasteless, the bacon wrapped turkey had soggy bacon.  The actual steak tasted ok, but the fat in the cut had not been rendered down, resulting in a really chewy mess.  The \"surf\" part of the meal was a disaster.  The salmon was old and fishy. The tilapia was not cooked through.  The shrimp was rubbery.  I do have to say the bacon wrapped scallops weren't terrible. The plate went almost entirely untouched.  It was difficult to get my water refilled.  For lunch, they had us sit in a section of the restaurant as far away from the salad bar as possible, resulting in many pilgrimages across the empty restaurant for the deep fried bananas (the best thing on the salad bar).  I am surprised that such a poorly run restaurant is still operating. I am sure they prey on tourists who they can burn. Las Vegas locals shouldn't be caught dead in the joint.",

What an opportunity to try so many wonderful cuts of meat and only have to try what intrigues you. The buffet in the rear of the restaurant has plenty to offer but the star of the restaurant is definitely the meat. The Tiramisu is also fantastic. One of the best I've had. Very light and flavorful.",

Brittany I believe. I asked for water after she offered her fancy water but I just wanted water for now until I saw the drink list. She then said in a very sarcastic way, \"oh okay, I'll bring you sink water...\" I then told her how wrong it was for her to rudely say that but she kept on with her rude manner. My hubby and I were floored! After waiting an hour, we have to deal with her sarcastic, rude remarks. We asked my other waiters to help but they just also rudely would say to talk to a manager. This place really needs a worker overhaul adjustment. Save your time and go somewhere, where they care more about their customers",

It's a Brazilian steak house where we get our own food and the serve has to bring us drinks and maybe ask about desert! Well we got drinks we didn't order plus got charged for them then we waited for 45 min to see the sever to get dessert. The server wouldn't answer any questions was rude and got automatic 20 percent for doing absolutely nothing on an $800 bill!",

There is a meat plus seafood buffet for something like $50.  I found the best and tastiest meats to be the pork loin and the picanha steak.  The meats weren't overly salty like some lower grade churrascari can be.  Some novelties included grilled pineapple (nice!), bacon wrapped turkey, and Brazilian deep fried chicken.  There's no comparison to say a Fogo de Chao, but it was plenty decent.  Water service by our server was very good and appreciated given the kind of meal we were having.",

Now I actually like the concept, lots of meats, cooked well, full of flavor...And way over priced....  I love meat, beef, pork, chicken, hell give me deep fried budgie (google it Americans) in garlic and I would be happy.  So I am left conflicted, lots of good meat...for a price that's lets face it folks, in Vegas you can get a very good steak for, i'm sorry, but when these restaurants started showing up in Vegas dinner was $25 -$30, now they are $50 and up...Seriously, look long and hard at what you are getting, they just don't make sense...But I let the wife pick dinner...  So, after a quick \"no\", \"But you said I could pick\" conversation she headed of to groupon, where she came across a deal for this place....Plus she had a credit with groupon that covered the cost...  Ok meat plus a meal I had already payed for..Works for me.  Service was good, seated quickly, waiter friendly, diet coke delivered quickly, though the refill took time to come...  But it's the food you want to know about....Well frankly, the meal was \"free\"...And I think we were charged to much.  The meats were dry, the fish were cooked to death, the shrimp tasteless.  The one saving grace was desert (yes we went to an all you can eat meat place and still wanted dessert, that should tell you something)...I had the tiramisu, the wife had the cheesecake, they were both very good.  In the end there are far better Brazilian steak houses in town.",

    "text": "This is a place I was introduced to a couple of years back and have enjoyed once or twice a year since. As far as Brazilian steak houses go this is my one and only experience. My experience is also limited to just the buffet and meat experience. So let's take it from there!  Starting off, the place looks nice. Dimly lit and fits the mood of a relaxed dinner. The dining room is well spaced and even when full you can move around freely. The waiters and waitresses have always been friendly and accommodating. Even joking and being friendly, that's always something I'll consider good customer service. Let's take it away to the food and start with the salad bar which is where I'm knocking off a star. The variety here is nice. You have fruit salads, make your own salad, deep fried bananas to biscuits and soups. Some light pasta salads, everything very light. The problem being is some of the items are hit and miss. Hot items aren't always hot, potatoes can be under seasoned or straight up bland. I've had an item or toe where I can easily say I wouldn't want to try it again. Luckily majority of these items are good with only one or two stinkers.  The meat has always been the rave of the place for me. I've never had an experience with any sort of over salting, over seasoning or over cooking. The meat is always prepared and as a fan of filet mignon I will say theirs is excellent. I was even treated to a personal filet mignon dish after I went there for graduation. They weren't serving the item yet but created some for us. If that's not a great gesture then I don't know what is.  Not having tried much else item wise I can't recommend or sway you from other menu items. I still recommend the place for a nice sit down meal for a special occasion. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Just don't.  To me this is as simple of an explanation that I can give to my thoughts on Pampas Churrascaria.  To an extent, it pains me to say this because the meat was, as advertised, very good.  The rest of the experience, however, was not up to par with, to be honest, my lowest expectation.  The strategy of this business is very simple.  Get people in the door, get them fed, get them out not caring about repeat business because we are all tourists anyways.  They are the classic coupon/gimmick facility mimicking the stores that mark their prices up merely so they can offer a discount and people feel like they are getting a deal.  You won't.  I guarantee that, even by Vegas standards, you will pay more then what it is worth despite your 2-1 coupon that somebody handed you on the strip, or your Groupon, or one of the other discounts that every single person in line seemed to have.    I'll admit that it is tempting.  We fell for it.  After reading several varying accounts we decided to give it a chance but afterwards we were left with this feeling of good meats completely void of any type of atmosphere which is really quite sad.  Now to be fair, Pampas does receive some accolades from me and I'll explain them here.    First, the hostess station was commendable.  Despite being extremely busy they were able to accommodate us earlier then our reservation when we asked.  They also handled a very heavy workload filled with very needy people quite well.  People were jumping the line to ask questions, hovering around them, not an easy work environment for a restaurant employee and I felt they did an excellent job.  The question remains, however, why is the structure set up in this way to allow a line with roughly 20 people in it just to check in.  Secondly, the cuts of meat were delicious and they seemed to come around often enough.  If you are in the food industry and you have good food that should account for a star.  We also had the Tiramisu for dessert which was a great portion and very tasty.  Outside of these two bright spots however, this place could not live up to even the mildest of expectations.  The buffet portion of the restaurant was incredibly lackluster and required a very treacherous journey dodging other patrons, trays and workers.  We ordered the surf and turf which was a complete waste and hardly touched given that fact.  The service was efficient but lacked any sort of outward personality whatsoever.  Actually, that is not True, our server absolutely reeked of \"I'm too good for my job\" which inevitably led to much of the bad experience.  There were no facial expressions, no changing of tone of voice, it was as if it was a very apathetic robot was asking us if we wanted to start with water and then jabbing us with a $6 bottle which is another story.  I would rather deal with a server forgetting our food, screwing up our order, etc if their is a little bit of humanism behind it then deal with some arrogant facade.  Maybe he was having a bad day, I know that happens but for some reason I really doubt that was the case.  All in all, if you are considering this place that means you are in Vegas.  And if you are in Vegas you have virtually an unlimited variety of establishments serving up amazing food.  It's not worth your time and it  is not worth your money, and when they are so many other worthy options all around you make sure you don't waster either of those things here.",

The day of we found out the strip is closed and no vehicles are allowed on New Year's Eve.  So we called and tried change our reservations to another night, and were told we would lose our deposit, which I wasn't worried about because they only needed a $20 deposit but when we were going to cancel they told us it was $20/person!  So we decided to take a taxi rather then lose $80.    Once we arrived I was really irritated because there was hardly anybody there.  I can see charging a deposit when our skipping effect others from eating but we would have had no impact too others ability to eat.  As for the rest the food was OK mostly over cooked.  Service was great.  Be careful thought we had a buy one get one free coupon but the mandatory add ons can make it expensive.  Each adult was required to buy a $20 drink pass whether you drank or not and be careful to look at the bill,  they automatically add a tip to the bill and then circle where you tip again.  Our bill was almost $250 even with our coupon.  In short we will not be going back.",

Their specialty, The Meat Rodizio, $21pp for lunch was very unimpressive.  Every meat was very under seasoned which was quite surprising. The tri-tip was flavorless. The chicken legs were suppose to be marinated in chilies, vinegar, & garlic was bland and burnt. The smoked ham was dry and unimpressive. The side bar which says it features over 50 hot and cold sides and salads had some nice selections, but far less than 50 to choose from.  The only thing I did truly enjoy was the Brazilian Lemonade. Definitely not worth the price you're paying!",

Good parts were the beverages - they were tasty - the margarita and caipirihina tasted like they came straight from baby Jesus' ball sack- very delicious.  The bad was that for a Brazilian steak house with unlimited meat the choices were about as vast as a vegan party, and the surf part was just horrible. the mussels looked like discarded tumors and the idea of peeling back my own shrimp and removing the poop line is absurd. I'm all for fresh but not when you're paying 50 sheckles. The the potatoes were instant, the tiramisu was as soggy and had as much flavor as my son's diaper.  This restaurant only gets 2 stars because of the drinks and waitress being friendly.  Meat servers were slow and looked like something out of a Frankenstein movie.  My favorite part (sarcasm) was when the meat server dropped a piece of chicken on the chair next to me and never got it. It was nice having the extra chicken guest at our table.  stay away and check out another finer Brazilian establishment.  We frequent Texas de Brazil and fogo de chao in the Chicago area and they are much better than this place.",

It was pretty much what you would expect from a Brazilian steakhouse. The food wasn't the best I had ever eaten, but you do get more than you could ever eat. I actually liked that they had $10 bottomless mimosas, bloody maries and sangria more than the food. They have a lady that comes around to take your picture and offers you the picture to buy. I thought it was a little bothersome while we were eating, but we actually paid for the picture because it was the best picture we took in Vegas! I would never have came here and wouldn't have been happy paying for the actual prices for what we got if we hadn't gotten the 2 lunches with the tour though.",

Waiter was extremely attentive and helpful in making selections. Good variety at the hot/cold bars and wine and sangria were pretty good.  The meat selection was decent with about 10 different options from steak, chicken, ham, pork, beef and sausage. Our favorite was definitely the sirloin and bacon wrapped filet minion :)   The servers bringing the meats around were inconsistent in the sense that when we sat down we were bombarded with all the options and couldn't even try them all before they got cold but then took a long time for steak to come back around again.   Only other drawback is that the restaurant is in a mall which lowers the experience a bit but overall a good deal for the discount price paid!",

Apparently they gave our table away so I made one hell of a fuss (It was a $500 ticket for gods sake, give me some damn service, I even set a reservation to avoid this, get your freaking crap together) and they ended up redeeming themselves by placing us in a private room of sorts. Besides the getting in and getting seated which was a nightmare, the rest of the experience was amazing. The food was superb and I left satisfied. This coming from someone who has also eaten at Texas De Brazil. The service there was better and the food had a different flare.

I recommend looking for the showgirl handing out the coupons not too far from the restaurant entrance in Planet Hollywood.  The coupon saves you almost 50% per adult and it is good for your whole party.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because the shrimp we receive was overcooked and the filet mignon was too well done.  However, everything else was excellent.  We travel to Vegas quite often and we will most certainly be back!  The Vegas guides give this restaurant a $$.  However, at $35+ per person with coupon, $60+ without, I would give it a $$$.",

(and if they really do, damn.) shrimp was hell of a tasty treat. seems like the spices and my taste buds were having a party. you might wanna eat the tails as well. lol. the salad bar. not much selections compared to other brazilian steakhouses i have been to. but i was not really into it. just took a little salad and im off to start with the meat. first, i love lamb, and their lamb here, with the balsamic, man it loves me too!!! we have this special bonding, you know. that lamb was really really happy when it met my tongue. or i would rather say, my tongue was happier. or whatever. that chicken wrapped bacon, and sirloin wrapped bacon, was a 5-star. excellent. that filet mignon with parmesan? orgasm is what you get!! juicy ham, match it with their pineapple, and damn, thank me later. dessert. we tried their tiramisu, white chocolate cheesecake, and that chocolate explosion or something. i dont know, but they were goooooooood. the only bad thing is that we did not know that their strawberry lemonade was not unlimited. we ended up ordering about 10 glasses for about $4 each. crybaby. but overall, it was a great visit.",

We are from Louisiana where fresh seafood reigns and this seafood was just plain bad.  I have never eaten crab cakes that tasted like theirs.  The meat and salad were awesome.

The place was certainly not crowded and it was at lunchtime.  After about 15 minutes our drink order was taken and we were given no direction or information.  We finally got up from the table and assumed that we were to go to the salad area.  The selection was not good.  Several of the items were labeled as Oriental. In a Brazilian restaurant.  As we were eating, we noticed we didn't have a red/green card on our table.  We asked someone and the busboy looked around, picked a card up OFF THE FLOOR, rubbed it on his pant leg and put it on our table.  After sitting with our card, the first meat came around and the gaucho put the meat down on the tiny plate that was holding my tongs.  I had to ask for a dinner plate.  We were offered pork, ham, pineapple, chicken, sausage, turkey and one type of sirloin.  None were great in any way.  We sat for long periods of time without meat being offered and had to sit with empty plates for quite some time before flagging down someone to request the check.  The only reason it got 2 stars is that it was reasonably priced as far as this type of restaurant goes, and that we liked the cheese buns.  Would never eat there again",

We had a group of 10, with a reservation, and they tried to give us a very small and cramped bar table.  We could have walked off the street and gotten this table.  Second, they made us wait an hour past our reservation.  Third we were told we had to get a bar table because reservations were going to filled an hour and 1/2 after our reservation time (this is not a typing mistake, does not make any sense, the manager argued it did make sense).  We would have been out of the restaurant by the time of this reservation, if we had been sat on time.  When we finally got our table they were slow to deliver the meat that is supposed to be endless and come at us overwhelmingly fast.  We did not get the barrage of meat they promised. We felt the restaurant wanted us to fill up on their salad bar.   After telling us we were supposed to wait for another reservation, one really large table, in the same room, remained empty all night.  A bad experience all around.  On top of all that we bought a Groupon but they hand better coupons in the mall.  This made the Groupon pointless and a real waste of money.",

Also, I don't know who's adding up the bill, but their tipping percentage doesn't even calculate correctly. Second, the meat rodizio only had a few choice (4-5) type of meats that were all salty.

One good thing to say is the sides were great, they had a large selection to chose from, something the Redondo Beach restaurant lacked. So then the meats start coming and one after another I'd cut a piece and I didn't finish, started just letting my hubby get peices and having a cut from him so I didn't waste food. I found us leaving every piece because all meats were so dry, over cooked. So I decided I'd ask  our waiter who was very cool and he sent over one server with a med-rare meat which still was dry. I can say out of all the sea food that was brought to our table the fish and oysters we're very tasty. Wish I could have had some excellent news to share seeing we were so excited to visit here. For all the people who enjoy well done meat this is the place for you.",

    "text": "Me and my family went for dinner because we got a $100 gift certificate for anything in the restaurant. We came around 4:30pm on a Tuesday and it wasn't crowded and we were seated immediately. The waiter was nice and attentive and helped us with our orders. The menu was very expensive but because of the gift card we decided not to worry about the cost. I got the skirt steak which was $29, my mom got the salmon which was $27 and my grandma got the dinner buffet which was $25. My steak was really good I had no complaints with the taste of the food. My mom however thought the salmon was plain and dry as well as the wine she got. Both me and my mom decided to substitute one of the sides of our entrees with the garlic mashed potatoes. When the food was brought out however, the cooks forgot that we substituted our sides for garlic mashed potatoes so we still got our original sides but the waiter was fast in bringing out little sides of the garlic mashed potatoes instead. My grandma wasn't too happy with the soup selection of the buffet but she liked it overall. They did charge for water which was pretty dumb especially since our waiter brought out a second water that we didn't ask for and didn't drink.  What most annoyed me was how people would come around with cameras asking to take a complimentary picture (which was not complimentary they give you a tiny wallet sized picture and try to upswell you a bigger one for $20) would pester us while we were eating twice! Right when we got our food this lady comes up and rudely interrupts our eating and almost demands that we take a picture because it was \"free\". It was just aggravating that while you're eating a nice dinner with your family you're being badgered by people. People were also walking by constantly through the tables trying to advertise their meat on the sticks which was also mildly annoying.  I get annoyed pretty easily and just want to eat in peace so I give this restaurant 3 stars since my food was good and the waiter was nice. Otherwise, it's overpriced for the quality of the food overall as well as the constant badgering from random people.",

    "text": "This restaurant was fairly mediocre. Nothing special enough to make me feel inclined to go again. The food was good, the service was bad. The prices would have been completely ludicrous if we had not purchased a \"travel zoo\" voucher. They charged a fee for water (which they brought without us requesting) and charged taxes on top of the voucher. Every other groupon or voucher we used on our trip included the taxes so there was no surprises at the end of the meal.   Again, the food was good. However it was very standard Brazilian food and nothing made it stand out as unique. The pineapple (which is always the highlight at a place like this!) was not done well and very disappointing.   As far as service as service goes, this place was terrible. The waiter never returned to refill drinks (I paid for that water!) and they were very slow to remove used plates. The indicator you are supposed to use to let them know if you want more meat brought over was useless. When flipped to red we still had a heavy onslaught of people coming to the table. Other times we waited 5-10 minutes before anyone came around.   The biggest turn off here was the waiter. After not returning to our table for literally 35 minutes, never refilling our waters or asking if we wanted to purchase more sangria, not offering dessert options and leaving us waiting for a final bill for twenty minutes after we asked for it...he had the nerve to say \"please don't forget to tip based on the amount your meal would have cost without the voucher. People always forget that.\" Ummmmm....",

Sausages were just ok. Turkey wrapped in Bacon was probably the best thing they offered me.  The sides/salad bar was pretty small and not a great variety. Which really doesn't matter so much to me because I just get some rice and the powder stuff for dipping the meat in.  Servers were either all robots, or all hungover... no life to them. And they sure took their sweet time coming out from the back... Don't they know to not keep food from me like that? Maybe that is why the knives were duller than a party at Joe Biden's. They didn't want me shankin them for the whole skewer of meat.  Caipirinha was OK, but try the White Wine Sangria here... excellent.  Oh- I almost forgot. My coupon for $3 off per person mysteriously vanished from the table.",

Actually, every other Brazilian barbecue I have been to was better.    Notes: + Bacon-wrapped turkey was soft and flavorful. - Lamb was way overcooked and very tough - Tri-tip was very chewy, wanted to spit it out - Service was weak, my water glass went empty most of the dinner - I asked for the grilled pineapple five times before it came back to my table.  The worst part was they added an 18% ($18!) service charge to my bill because I used a gift certificate that I bought at a discount.  This was unacceptable since there were only two people in my party.",

Red means to stop all incoming food and Green is for all you can eat meat at the slowest pace on the planet.  If you want all you can eat, than hit up the Wynn. Atleast you can eat the main course whenever you want. Service is slow and I would not recommed coming here for that steep price. No desert due to slow service. Oh by the way.. 4 people came out to be 166.98. for 10 lbs of salt in my body. Wow. I am glad I had the chance to walk it off. Like it really mattter.",

    "text": "A bit disappointed with this place. Got a voucher from tix4less for this place. I have had tried the brazilian steak house in NY until their service went bust.  So the girl told us about this place. Give yourself more time to get over here if you are seeing a show. Traffic was hell on a busy Saturday night 9/21/13. We walked from the Mirage to Planet Hollywood where this restaurant is. It took so much time. Our reservations were for 9:30 but they give you a window of 15 minutes either way. By the time we finally got there with all the people walking the strip to the construction it was 9:50pm. We were seated with no problem. I took one look at the menu. The voucher was for the meat rodizio they come and bring around. Instead of paying $43 dollars the voucher would give it to us for $24.95. The menu tells you what kind of meat. Being the only thing I had seen from what they bring is the steak it made no sense to pay that price for just bringing me steak and taking a little bit of rice and pasta from the buffet bar. So I declined eating that. I went and picked the Grilled Peito De frango $27. The waiter talks to me like I am a little kid and tells me that this isn't part of the voucher. I obviously can read my voucher and I tell him I know this, you don't have to tell me twice but I am not paying to eat a round of meat that the will come around and the only thing that catches my eyes are the steak.. Nope.. So I finally get my chicken. While my boyfriend gets his buffet bar fill and waits for the meat. My chicken is so tough to cut through. The mashed potatoes were cold. They obviously just sit out there. We tell them my potatoes are cold. They don't take my plate but give me another wallop of potatoes that are only a tiny bit warmer. Ugh my stomach hurts at this point. Where was the vegetables that the menu states with this. I saw something underneath my chicken. It was not edible. I tried to make the most of the meal so that I could go back to my hotel without being upset. The waiter was ok after that for the most part. He asked if I wanted to take it with me. I should have said no. I left so much uneaten food.. I did take it but I threw it out before I left Planet Hollywood. I won't be back ever to this place. Sorry!",

A little hard to find, it is all the way in the back of the Planet Hollywood casino mall.  $1 well drinks, half price beer and halp price apps and sanwiches for happy hour, one of the best happy hours I have seen. Shannon is a great bartender and I would return to the place just to see her. The only negative was the local regulars who were all cheesy time-share salesmen. They made used car dealers seem classy as they shared their stories of hard selling midwest saps for hours until they gave in. If you are thinking of buying a Vegas time-share, stop by this bar first, there is no way you would buy one afterwards.  Food is ok, but it is no Texas de Brazil. The salad bar was the smallest and plainest of any Brazillian steakhouse I have been to. Nothing spectacular.  The meats were below average and all well past medium rare. The best was the garlic sirloin, the worst was the filet mignon which was way overcooked and almost well done. Pork and turkey were ok.  I will definitely return for the happy hour, but would order off the bar sandwich menu next time.",

The wait was long, even with a reservation.  The hostess was rude and clearly had no idea what she was doing.  The wait was long to get a drink at the bar, even though they were not that crowded.  The bartender was more interested in cleaning up.  When finally seated, the waiter took 15 minutes to take the drink order.  They had just gotten rid of the fresh seafood bar and in it's place would bring out \"seafood\" when asked.  A nice piece of white fish, some scallops wrapped in bacon and shrimps.  The meat was salty, and they only brought the filet around once in a while; while trying to load you up on sausages and chicken.  While both good, I wanted steak.  Of the steak pieces, the sirloin was probably the best cooked, very flavorful.  I would say the same about the filet, but I had it only once.  The Manager was very nice, obviously knew he had a lot of issues with the staff.  I believe he is just there till he finds another job.  He comped the meal for poor service, but I did offer to pay for the bottle of wine I bought.  Overall, this place is dying. They are trying to save money at the cost of food and service.  For a little bit more, Texas de Brazil is by far the better experience.",

    "text": "An occasional Vegas tourist, I am always a bit shocked at the cost of food in the hotels and casinos every time I come back. The girls and I were looking for a quick take out dinner when we stumbled upon Pampas. Although we were offered $5 off for a Saturday night, we had to pass on a buffet out of fear we would not be able to squeeze into our dresses that night. On our last day, however, we returned here for our traditional buffet final vacation meal. At $15, this was significantly cheaper (albeit slightly smaller) than any of the hotel buffets. This was my first Brazilian experience so I have no comparison to others but the meat was delicious though a bit on the salty side. Other delicious items included the cheese biscuits, potato salad, and beef soup. We topped off the meal with a few slices of watermelon to cleanse the palate and went on our merry way. All have agreed this restaurant will be on the list for any future Vegas trips. See you next yr Pampas!",

I've been to about four churrascarias and only two have really left me satisfied. This one was nothing in comparison but was okay. There was not much on the selection of meats.I think the selection was five or six. The salad bar was very weak and was not very appetizing. The feijoada was very thin and runny and should have had more black beans. the meat was also very salty and did not leave a good aftertaste. The food was okay but nothing to rave about.",

    "text": "I bought special discount dinner from Tix4tonight and therefore I spent less than $30 for my dinner. For that price it definitely worth 4 stars.  Salad bar is good (though Fogo de Chao is far better, but given price differences that's acceptable). The BBQ itself is very good: tender meat (we had beef, lamb, chicken, sausage, and pork) and well seasoned. I'd like to call out their lamb: juicy, tender, well seasoned. The missing star is that they didn't cut the meat perfectly so you might have to chew some parts out.  Dessert is on the average side but still good. The downside of this place is actually slow service. I need to wait for 10 minutes to have my server greet me, and another 10 minutes for additional water requested. BTW they charge for water, so diners be aware.",

Yummmm! The salad bar is also amazing. The only thing we pretty much get is their cheese balls and mashed potatoes. Oh my, they are the best!   Bill, the owner, always takes care of us and is one of the nicest people you will meet in the food industry! We come to Pampas's regularly and we prefer it more than the other Brazilian steakhouses in town. Although we've been here several times, there is only one server that has really stood out to us and went above and beyond for us. If you're ever at Pampa's, request Isaac as your server. He's the best and the nicest server we've ever had from all of the restaurants we've been to!",

    "text": "We had reservations at Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse but realized we were closer to Pampas so we canceled and reserved this restaurant (in person) for Christmas dinner for 8 people.  A couple of hours later, called the restaurant to change the reservation time and they don't have my reservation.  What?!!! How can that be when we made it in person and the hostess even repeated the spelling of my last name.  That should've been a red flag.  When we go to dinner had to wait for 20 minutes to be seated, they told us they had to get the table ready.  Wouldn't they know to the get the table ready hence the reservation.  When we were seated the restaurant wasn't even full.  To the point, I had better.  The salad bar was nothing special limited varieties. The lettuce didn't look fresh and the station was littered with food on the counter.  Then we had to wait a long time for the carvers to come by and by the time they got to the next table before us, they ran out.  Flagged down our waiter to ask for the carver for our meats.  Had to wait for 15 minutes before they finally came by. Meat was chewy and/or bland, the sirloin with the garlic was overpowering.  The grilled pineapple was good. After the meal you get a choice of free dessert, either pumpkin or apple pie. Yes, they do charge you for WATER at $2.00 a person and they add a 20% gratuity to your bill.",

    "text": "Probably the worst Brazilian steakhouse I've been to. It is so bad that they need to hand out coupons and advertise for people to eat here. Really? I almost equate this place to a poor man's Churrascaria lol. Service here is mediocre and the food comes out very slow compared to the competition, where food seems to flow out and is carved at tables non-stop. I've only been here a couple times in the last 4 years and it's only usually when I get a comped meal, gift card or coupon. If you don't have any of those then it's not worth it because after visiting the salad bar you'll be waiting all night for the meats to come by. And when one comes, you'll be waiting forever again for the next guy to stop by.  The food itself is ok. I'm not a big salad bar person at these types of places because everything is premade and they usually don't have any regular salads or sides. The quality of the meats are hit or miss because sometimes they are too overcooked. I guess if you like your steaks well done then you won't mind. The meats that aren't overcooked are sometimes too salty which makes them hard to eat as well. I also hate that they don't bring you any fresh sides with your meal because everything is up at the salad bar.  The good news is they have happy hour so if you like wine this may be a good spot to check out since all their glasses of wine are $5, I believe, during happy hour. Don't see myself coming back in the near future. I think I'll stick with my favorite Churrascaria, Texas de Brazil.",

    "text": "Pampa's seems to have gone seriously downhill.  So many things went wrong with our visit today.  While trying to get to the salad/hot food bar the kitchen took this time to change EVERYTHING at the same time! Much was full, they were pulling every food item & breaking up all of the ice. The sauteed kale used to be good, it is so many different levels of being cooked in 1 pan it's rediculous. There was everything to basically fresh non cooked kale to it's been sitting in the warming pan for a good hour all mixed together. If the cooks don't like kale they need to learn that customers do like it & cook it correctly, it tasted like they may have sauteed it ONCE that day then kept adding raw from the bag to the kale that's been sitting in the pan for a while. It sat on my never cleared table the whole dining experience because it is cooked so badly Nobody could get to anything on the salad bar because they are chipping at ice while the salads are being blocked by their bodies. Very unorganized & poorly planned. I went to culinary school & have worked in fine dining, this was a hug no no. The outside tables were changed to these HORRIBLY UNCOMFORTABLE low seating tables we had to croutch over to eat. Our server took at least 10 - 15 mins to get us water & beer & I had to hunt down somebody to get utensils for what salad/hot food we could get to. The meat cutter Rodezio meat cutters were non existent in the patio seating, the potatoes are very yummy but by the time you got meat they were cold. The meat was so bloody we were surprised it wasn't mooing. I don't mean that it was medium-rare or rare. It was a culinary term called blue-rare. The garlic-parmesian steak was so mushy, it was inedible.  I would tell the meat cutters that the meat was too red, only 1 brought me back not bloody meat, the other's were like \"ok, no want meat\" The server went to the kitchen to get us more done meat, he brought back 2 types. One was cooked great, the other was cut thin but still total red inside (high flame, really fast). Since we were on the patio we also didn't get all the meats offered to us that the people sitting inside were offered.. We do not like the seafood addition at all. The cooks put all of the seafood on the same broiler plate which causes every thing, shrimp, scallops, I think they offer swordfish or halibut .. it all tastes like salmon. Salmon is strong, shrimp & scallops are delicate & should NOT be cooked with salmon thus everything tasting like salmon We didn't order this addition & do not recommend it. We were not the only people on the patio complaining about the absence of meat cutters. Hey Pampa's hire a couple more per shift!!! We had to ask 2 different people 3 times if we could get more water, upon my 3rd request I wasn't nice anymore & did mention that this was the 3rd time requesting water ... they do charge for water...fine but get us a refill on our 1st request, took us about 30+ minutes to finally get a water refill. In my opinion having to ask for a water refill is a sign of a bad server. Then let's get to our bill... It took at least 20 minutes of sitting with our dirty, never cleared plates waiting at our super uncomfortable table & chairs to get just the bill, I mentioned that we just want our bill because we are very uncomfortable at these horrible tables/chairs & would like to leave. Another 20mins to get our credit card back. During this time we do not have any water & are very thirsty.  Now, we will return because a visiting family member has a gift card for here... however, the next time wile NOT sit on the patio at uncleared tables & uncomfortable tables/chairs. (Pampa's.. who's stupid idea was it to use these chairs & tables?) We'll be INSIDE, where the chairs & tables are more comfortable, the meat cutters actually come around more frequently inside & we can have a view of when the kitchen staff is finally finished overhauling the whole salad bar at once. We will also request our bill 30 minutes in advance of our wanting to leave & request a few extra waters to begin with. Hopefully we'll have a server who removed dirty plates full of improperly sauteed kale. This was a bad experience, hopefully Pampa's returns to their former selves.",

Meats can be cooked to order as well. They have a full bar and their desserts are delectable! From white chocolate to tiramisu, flan and rich chocolate mousse - great with after dinner coffee.

We never tried a Brazilian style buffet restaurant before, so we were super excited to try it out.    The restaurant is kinda tucked away in the in-door shoppes at the Planet Hollywood casino.  We arrived around 3pm and the place was pretty busy.  The decor and atmosphere was very nice and upbeat.  All the staff appeared to be well dressed and professional.  There was a 15 minute wait to be seated and we were seated near the bar.  Our waiter was very nice and attentive.  Even the manager came around a couple of times to make sure everything was excellent.  We were given this fancy Eco-friendly water from a large chilled bottle...awesome!  Ok, now on to the feast...the kitchen staff came around on a regular basis with ginormous meats on a stick (get your mind out of the gutter), but how fantastic is that!  A great variety of meats that included juicy filet mignons and perfectly cooked lamb.  Huge prawn and steak was brought out on a plate.  The salad bar was really good along with the soups.  The Groupon included 2 cocktails and our waiter said we could choose any drink worth up to $10.  Great, we ordered a pina colada and a house special.  The dessert selection was just ok, but the cheesecake, that we ordered, was scrumdibliumtious.  I would highly recommend buying this Groupon, especially when there is additional 20% code.  We ended up paying close to $40 when Groupon had 25% off deals.  Without this Groupon, you would be paying close to $100 for 2 people at the restaurant.",

    "text": "Okay, okay...So I had read and heard a lot of mixed reviews on this place before going, and my brain was in \"just give em a chance\"' mode. A guy invited me on a lunch date here, so I sighed and went with hopes for the best.  Location is a little weird in the middle of Miracle Mile, and of course pretty dead in the middle of a weekday. We opted for one of the \"patio\" seats on the outer part of the restaurant. Service was ok, but the server kept mentioning that my date had a big coupon and he'd tack on a birthday dessert for us to meet the requirements to use it. Weird. What if I wasn't supposed to know the date was so cheap?! lol  At any rate, we got up to do the salad bar thing and I wasn't disappointed with that part at all. Pretty good options and everything looked fresh. Great olives.  Meats started coming around and a lot of the cuts looked super fatty. Skipped those and went for the top sirloin and chicken wings. Both very good.  Since the \"birthday dessert\" was a must, per our server, I got a tiramisu. Pretty good, but I'm a tiramisu snob, so don't mind me.  Not a bad big meaty lunch for 2 at $16, but not sure if I would've paid much more for it, all things considered. Stick to Fogo or Texas de Brazil for the real fancy experience.",

I was told that the service was slow (which makes it harder to take advantage of the dinner) The drink special was a good deal, you get your drinks worth. They told me they wished they could be consistent with the food they were bringing out. Some meats were delicious and perfect and some were dry and bland. They said the grilled pineapple was delicious as well as the Flan.   Although this was a great deal, I really wish that when people redeem Groupon deals, that they are not given mediocre service. This is why Groupon services are used yah? To bring more people in?   If you are looking for a decent place to go on a regular night maybe a Groupon for this is fine, but I wouldn't recommend it for a special occasion. There are several restaurants out there for that, without spending this much. I can't imagine paying regular price for this place. Based on their feedback I will not be going there to try it out for myself.",

As we waited for our table the manager came out and apologized to everyone for the long wait & would seat us as quickly as possible.  We only waited 5-10 minutes but it was a nice gesture.  Mindy was our server & she was friendly & attentive to whatever we needed.  A weird thing she explained was that they charged a dollar per person for water but was up front with it because she didn't want us to be surprised.    We saw a few reviews saying that the food was so-so & servers weren't that friendly but everyone there was pretty much the opposite & went out of their way to get whatever we needed.  The meats were excellent and came out fast & furious and we were stuffed when we were done.  The salad bar was fresh & tasty & well stocked.  I'd give them a solid 4 stars; the only thing I found a little annoying was the noise level; I think if they added some sound absorbing fabric on the walls & ceilings it would enhance the overall dining experience.",

    "text": "Having tried several different variations of the Brazilian steakhouses across the country; we were excited to try one here, in our own backyard. My wife and I are longtime residents of Las Vegas, and are fully aware of the many options there are here to dine. For my birthday today, my wife treated us to the lunch here. We did take advantage of the Groupon discount, opting for the full blown lunch deal, which included the all you can eat meats, salad bar, seafood (shrimp and mussels), all you can drink for one hour (limited to Sangrias, draft beer, and Bloody Marys), and one desert (cheesecake, Tiaramisu, (my choice) chocolate cake, and one other, can't recall what. ABSOLUTELY take advantage of Groupon!  Using this, our lunch was $70, plus tax and tip. Without this, it would have been about $115. Nice savings.   I'll be honest; having reviewed many of the thousands of reviews about this place, many of which were VERY negative, I was a bit skeptical about what we were going to experience. Here goes: The meats, in my wife's opinion, had too much garlic for her taste. She also felt the shrimp (served cold) were over cooked, making them tougher. Me, I've never met a shrimp I didn't like. But that's just me. She DID enjoy the pineapple, and the ham. The salad bar was average, with not nearly the variety we've experienced elsewhere. As far as our drinks, absolutely no issues there. Taking my time, I was able to enjoy four Bloody Mary's, which were good. The Tiaramisu was good. Of course, we were unable to finish the ample serving, having had plenty to eat at that point.   I'm glad we went for lunch, as I can only imagine how \"crowded\" the restaurant becomes for dinner. One other \"negative\" I should mention. They didn't have any of the red/green cards, used to indicate whether you're ready for more meats, or not. I was told \"we're out of those, sorry,\" which surprised us because, at that point, there really wasn't that many patrons eating, really only a few. Why is that an issue? Here's why:  our first \"offer\" of meat, was only a few minutes of sitting down to eat our salad. Rather annoying. Red card...they know not to bother.   Why then, FOUR stars? The food would have been given maybe a three star rating. But our server, Andrea, made our entire dining experience a pleasure!!!  She was attentive, very friendly. She continually checked on us, hence the aforementioned FOUR Bloody Mary's.  Having mentioned it was my birthday, and the reason we were even there, she and a fellow coworker as promised, came at the end and sang happy birthday to me, with a candle in the desert to blow out. Totally unnecessary, but very much appreciated!    Overall? It was \"ok.\"  Will we be return customers? Probably not. It certainly wasn't horrible (we didn't dislike), like so many of the reviews indicated, but mainly because, there are just so many other decent places to eat in Vegas! On to the next!  Apologies for the long winded review, hope it helps for those deciding whether or not to eat here.  We've had worse experiences.",

Full disclaimer:  We are fans of Brazilian steakhouses so we were looking forward to this lunch.  The service was very friendly but the attention was lacking even though there were only a few tables with customers.    There were several items available at the salad bar.  Most items that I had were ok.    Our lunch came with shrimp and they were horrible.  I have never received shrimp as overcooked as these were.  To the touch they were very pasty and they tasted very dry.  We did not finish the shrimp.  Having visited other Brazillian steak houses in the past, we were disappointed with the selection of meats that were available.  The roasted pineapple was presented multiple times while the steaks only came around once.  They also served ham, which we thought was funny as it didn't seem anything more than what you can buy at the supermarket.    If you were looking for a Brazillian steakhouse, I would recommend one of the other brands available in the area over Pampas.    This restaurant also had an advertisement that if you gave a good yelp review, you would receive a free dessert or food discount.",

It was pretty disappointing from the moment we walked in.  We approached the hostess upon arrival and were brought to a a table outside in the mall area.  We asked for a table inside and were told all other tables were full (the place was empty).  We assumed that the hostess had been told by management to seat everyone outside the place first to make it appear to be busy.  We then went up to another hostess and again requested a table inside.  She was very rude and reluctantly allowed us to take another table.  Needless to say the hostesses were awful.  The waitress was slow and not overly friendly.  The atmosphere was cheap and almost reminded me of a mexican chain.  The salad bar was okay.  I highly recommend NOT ordering the seafood as it was awful.  The crab cakes came directly from the freezer and the shrimp was chewy.  I was also disappointed they didn't have plantains, instead serving fried bananas in their place.  I do not recommend dining here.  There are so many wonderful choices in Vegas, Pampas Churrascaria is not one of them.",

    "text": "My friend was in town and we decided to have dinner on a Monday evening.  Thanks to my indecisiveness when it comes to choosing a dinner spot, I let him pick.  He suggested we check out a Brazilian steakhouse type joint he had seen earlier while walking through the Miracle Mile Shops.  Sure! So we we headed to what turned out to be Pampas Churrascaria.    We were quickly seated by the hostess and began exploring the menu.  Our server came over - his name was Juan and he was awesome :-D We ordered 2 margaritas, and then he told us of a special that he could offer us that would include all the meats as well as unlimited shrimp + the salad bar because we ordered drinks...for less than just the price of unlimited meat on its own! (can't remember the exact amount, but I believe that it was either $33 or $36 - either way, a GREAT deal!).  Obviously we took it.  My strawberry margarita was ok - it was a little sweet for my taste, but I downed it nonetheless.  Off to the salad bar we went! They had a REALLY great assortment that I thoroughly enjoyed - hearts of palm, tomatoes, various pasta salads, different types of fried peppers, cheeses, salami, mozzarella, orzo, green beans, and our favorite - some kind of fried bananas! Honestly, the salad bar was excellent! We returned to our table with our fully loaded plates.  A plate of shrimp was brought out to us with some kind of light teriyaki-like sauce - it was very good!  Then came the meats...I'm a BIG meat eater.  We were given chicken leg, chicken wrapped bacon, pork, ham, flank steak, lamb, and 2 other types of steak meat (can't remember what they were specifically).  Overall, the meat was good, but it wasn't the best I've ever had at this type of Brazilian type of restaurant.  My favorite meat was actually the chicken leg - now that was delicious!  Still, we stuffed ourselves silly! Overall, it was a good dinner and I would definitely return because of the fantastic value for your money, but it's not the most refined or flavorful meat on the planet.  I want to give another shoutout to our waiter Juan for his excellent service!",

When making their rounds, there were THREE instances in which the meat servers skipped us even though out table indicated that we would like have liked meat. 3. As soon as my mother sat down her seat was sticky and later had to walk the the miracle mile with a sticky ass! 4.The food was overpriced and not worth the money.  5.I should never have to pay for water.   Overall, don't even bother with this place, and don't even waste your money on the groupon. Very disappointed.",

This should of been explained to us by Tix4Tonight and the server, but our server did give us a discount. Food was great so I do recommend and will be back. My Server was Dave, he was friendly. My biggest complaint and the reason for the 1 star was because for 2 people including the discount came to $100 because they automatically add a $22 gratuity to my bill. This would be fine if they told us or had a sign at the the front check-in desk. BUT THEY HAD NEITHER. WILL NOT BE BACK.",

And two couples who have came after us was given the plate of seafood within less then 10mins of being seated.   I also didn't mention that when we were seated our waitress walked by our table twice before even saying anything to us. (10mins after being seated) finally a greeting by Ashely.   It took 15mins to get our waters and 20mins to get our cocktails! And to believe we've only been here for the past 30mins.  The service isn't just slow but they are in need of more workers.   They have a groupon offer that comes with 2 cocktails and no bartender making any drinks. I'm starting to wonder if my waitress even bartenders or she's just making our drinks of what she knows is in them.   Overall this visit to this place has not gotten better. This isn't a way we wanted to spend out last lunch in Las Vegas, let alone have anyone spend their time eating at a place like this.  Just when I thought it couldn't get any worst. Ahsley comes to my table and ask if she can clear anything off. I purposely put my fork, knife and tongs on the plate to be cleared off the table....instead of her taking it with her she threw it down in front of me while my fork had ranch on it and my knife has meat and oil all over it to only splash my arm, Thank you Ashley, I wanted a oil bath at lunch.",

The dinner + show combo turned out to be fairly inexpensive so we did not set our expectations too high for a ritzy, fantastic dinner.  Pampas exceeded our expectations. We were impressed by the overall ambiance of the restaurant: it was dimly lit, clean, and not too noisy. The very friendly staff took wonderful care of us and we never were left waiting too long for meat to arrive at our table. The meat selection isn't expansive, but I enjoyed the choices they did offer. Not a huge meat eater by nature, I was impressed with the freshness and variety of salad offerings at their bar. The salad bar is also kept extremely clean, which was very comforting for me.  I'm not sure how much their regular dining options are normally, but from the reviews it looks like many patrons are finding deals. If you can get a good deal to try out this place like we did, it's definitely worth a shot!",

Inside, we usually have pretty good service, but when we were seated in the outside, patio part, we had really bad service. But I will say, everytime I've come the food was great. Last night we went for our anniversary and had a good time. They either took a lot of the cold salad bar out, or they never refilled it because a good amount of it stayed empty the whole time which I was bummed about because all the things I liked, weren't there. The meats and seafood that they walk around with are always delicious. The desserts are too. If you like sangria, the white one is my favorite drink they have. It is pretty pricey to eat here, but they always have a Groupon. That's the only way we can afford it and now they have unlimited alcohol for an hour added to the groupon, which was nice. Just know, they actually time you for an hour for the alcohol so get as many drinks in as you can in those 60 minutes.",

They take a complimentary souvenir photo at the start of your meal and present you with a 10% off your next visit coupon with your photo on it for your next visit.  Had enough of alcohol lately so ordered a fruity mocktail, it was pretty good.  My boyfriend loved his coconut and pineapple drink order, so much that he ordered two.  Besides traditional cuts of meat they also cut pineapple and ham which didn't make too much sense to me.  Also seemed pretty pricey.  Fortunately we had a coupon but had to upgrade from entrees to the brazilian steak buffet.  Overall a decent meal but not sure if I'd be willing to pay full price.  The salad bar wasn't too impressive but I guess that wasn't their main focus.  Ambiance and convenient location in the mall is good enough for the majority of tourists.",

I asked her if she get left closing by herself all the time. She said yes, and that Mike never closes and never works his full shift. He always leaves as soon as the higher up managers leave, he is right behind them. Cindy apologised about the food and asked if there was anything she could do for me. I daid keep up the good work. You work to hard around here.  So tell me why doesn't the General manager Mike close or schedule enough managers to cover a busy night? He should be fired.

Their service for meat was really slow, usually on the more rare side if not still really bloody and the pineapple (usually my favorite part) was awful!

I turned the corner to go in, noticed a bad smell, went into the men's room, saw a major malfunction in a toilet, about gagged, and turned around and left. I doubt i will ever be back.

I wasn't impressed at all with the buffet and neither was my gf.  The endless supply of meat brought to the table was really amazing and the drinks were good.  One of the things that really bothered me was while we were trying to eat we got heckled by s photographer to take pictures of us.  Seems silly to try and sell pics to your customers when they are spending 30 dollars at least for dinner each.  I'm glad we experienced pampas because now we appreciate the Brazilian restaurant here at home.   We won't be returning.",

The cheese cake was freezer burned on one end, but it was so big that we couldn't finish it anyway.  Our mojitos didn't seem to have much alcohol in them and kind of tasted like lemonade.  We thought all of the wait-staff were nice.  I laughed out loud when a server literally reached through some plants to slide a side of house-baked chips onto our table.

Needless to say, I won't be visiting this place the next time I'm in town.  On a positive note, the restaurant was clean, service was good, and the staff was friendly. Lunch prices were decent considering the spread offered.",

It was pretty good, not as good as fugo de chao but we got lucky THAT TIME.   The next night we called ahead and were told that if we showed up in 15 minutes they were not very busy. We were within the casino so we ran right over and were told 15 to 20 minute wait by a liar that claimed her name was lyzette.  She was latin with short  straight hair tied back in a pony tail.   Big smart attitude.  After waiting half an hour and after seeing many people being seated that arrived after us I got up to see how long it would take. Lyzette the liar that probably made up the name said we were next. Then she kept calling more people in front of us so my wife confronted her again. She got a little nasty and argumentative  with my wife. We were then called and they tried to punish us by attempting to seat us in the bar which is a mile from the salad bar. We said we were offered a bar seat when we first arrived but wanted to sit in the restaurant.   That is why we waited to begin with. They made us wait another 10 minutes until I asked to see the manager who tried to seat us in the bar again. We walked out.   These people do not deserve your hard earned money. They are rude jerks. Go to fugo de chao and vote these losers out by not going to their arrogant restaurant. If you want to be dismissed by a lying disrespectful child at the front desk then by all means spend your money with these ungrateful people.  Ill never dine there again and I will email all my friends in vegas to tell them to stay away.",

Amazing selection of any and every kind of meat you ever wanted.  Warning - you might go into a meat coma.  Prepared nicely ... there was not much that I said no to.  The top sirloin is the most amazing meat I had.  Filet was my least favorite...not a fan of how they cook it here.  Again, all pretty much that I stuffed in my mouth was amazing.    Salad bar:  TWO WORDS:  FRIED BANANAS ....... Very good - you can be a veggie and go here and eat more than you should.  so lots of options there -   Service - hands down amazing for the group we had.  112 of us and I never felt like I waited to long.

This place blows them out of the water.   We were met by a couple of very friendly hostesses and we were seated within just a couple minutes after arriving on a Friday evening. The place was very busy. After meeting out waiter we headed over to the salad bar. The salad bar was full of different option. Nothing was lacking and the bar was very clean. We filled out plates and headed back to our table.   After we made it back, the meat started coming. We had the seafood option, as well. The shrimp were nice and buttery and the scallops wrapped in prosciutto were awesome! The meats were fabulous and excellently grilled, marinated, and prepared. We were very pleased with this place.   In the end, we had a very pleasant and enjoyable experience here. It is definitely a place that we would like to come again when we are in Vegas next.",

    "text": "It pains me somewhat to hand out 2 stars to this place because I do like the food and have had two enjoyable meals here, but I feel somewhat scammed, so I don't think I'd want to go back because this makes me uncomfortable.  Will start with the scam, have been to Pampas a couple of years ago, it was great.  So recently a groupon came up for sale and I figured I'd buy it.  $100 for $50 in food, how could I go wrong?  Well I found out.  Pampas artificially inflates their retail prices and then offers discounts through various venues (Ticket for tonight, groupon, people handing out flyers in the mall) to make people think they are getting a good deal.  So in the end you just end up paying about what you'd pay at any other restaurant....as long as you use your coupon (I feel for the poor people that don't utilize some sort of coupon at Pampas).   For example: Seafood buffet - $48 Meat buffet - $44  In Vegas you can find far better values for much less than that, or even splurge and eat somewhere higher end for about the same price.  So I guess with Groupon I expect to get some sort of bargain or deal, and I felt like i didn't here.  So I feel like I've been taken advantage of.  Thus I must rate this place as two stars.  The food is really quite good.  The meat tastes delicious and the salad bar is quite good.  The service is OK, the waiter was actually the same guy for both visits.  He has a very thick accent and is somewhat difficult to understand, but he's very good at his job.  They didn't seem to have much of a clue when it came to helping us with our baby, so if you have a little one you may want to steer clear.",

    "text": "First meal when I arrived to LV last weekend.  I knew of the one in PA and had always wanted to try it.  I didn't even know of this location until I entered the Miracle Mile shops inside Planet Hollywood.  I was primed and ready to go on the meat-fest extravaganza.  $39 for the meat only and $50 for the meat and seafood, both of which included cold salad bar visits.  Feeling adventurous, I super-sized to include the seafood, just out of curiosity.  The salad bar was OK, they had some cold and hot vegetable dishes as well as smoked salmon and salad stuff.  Once the food started arriving, I made sure only to try one piece of each meat and no more.  Unfortunately, when eating that much meat, I realized that it was hard to appreciate and taste them individually flavor wise.  In the interest of saving your stomach, I recommend you avoid the brazilian sausage which came out dry, the lamb which tasted a little too game-ish, and the turkey wrapped in bacon, wasn't too impressive.  The seafood consisted of scallops wrapped in bacon, grilled salmon, tempura battered cod, and shrimps with a butter sauce.  The salamon was dry and the cod's flavor was masked by the deep frying.  I'd only recommend the shrimp out of all the four and better to order them as a skewer than doing the rodizio.  Make sure not to order the coconaut mojito on their cocktail menu.  Coconaut and mint don't go together despite what our server enthusiastic words.  I had the red wine sangria which was okay...it wasn't as fruity as I have had before in Spanish tapas restaurants.  Average cost per diner for dinner is $70.  I'm glad I got to try this once and this place is worth at least a try but I can't imagine coming here regularly.  But if you want to avoid not feeling nine months pregnant afterwards, I highly suggest restraint and small bites throughout the meal.",

The bacon-wrapped chicken was like chicken jerky. I asked to be seated in the restaurant, but was told that would be a wait. The inside was 80 percent empty! We sat in the mall-like outter area. Very disappointing!",

    "text": "This is going to be a pretty extensive review. But here it goes.   Reservations: reservations were easy, and probably the ONLY good thing about this place. Called on Saturday, set for Monday, checked in a couple minutes late, but was still seated within 5 minutes.   Seating: we were seated right at the entrance of the restaurant. That meant every single guest coming in or out of the restaurant passed by our table. Some people were coughing and talking real loud and having conversations in \"our bubble\". Disgusting.   Service: my wife and I sat at our table for nearly 10 minutes before our server came around and greeted us. When he finally came around, he sat down menus, walked away, and didn't come back for another 5 minutes for our drink order. We had the groupon that allowed us unlimited drink for an hour. To paint a picture of how many times he came by our table to check on us, I got two drinks. Two. Drinks. One that I initially ordered, and a second one 40 minutes into our dining. He only stopped over when I had managed to catch eye contact and wave him over.   He was also too busy tending to a larger group seated right near us. This group was loud and obnoxious. Incredibly rude to surrounding guests. And the females walked around barefoot. What happened to sanitation rules in restaurants?  Initial impressions: the restaurant itself is very clean. The buffet area, however, looked like a low budget hole in the wall Chinese buffet. Plates had grease streaks and bits of food on them. I had to shuffle through 3-4 plates before I found one that was clean enough for me.   Food: buffet selection was very lacking. Compared to Texas de Brazil (same price range) was very subpar. Warmers were left open. Tongs were left inside warmers. Food bits were left on the countertops. All not being a problem had the staff that were responsible for that area, were actually doing their job. How do I know they weren't? Because they were standing around chit-chatting with each other, a couple of them were even on their phones while they were \"wiping\" stuff down. By that, I mean, moving a towel in circles while texting. Unsat.   The meat gauchos came around once every 10 minutes. There was literally a point in our dining experience that we sat for 15 minutes and had not seen ONE server. At their competitors restaurants like Texas de Brazil and Fogo de Chao, you can't show down the barrage of servers coming at you all at once.   All of the meats were very dry, chewy, and overly salted. I like salty food, but this was way too much. I also like my beef medium-medium rare. We were served a piece that looked like it could have been picked up at your meat counter at Smith's. There's a huge difference between rare and completely raw.   Overall: won't be visiting ever again. Sadly places like this in the strip will still be frequented by the unknowing tourist. But for locals like myself, we now know better. My wife and I's favorite hands down is Texas de Brazil. Excellent service. Excellent meat. Awesome buffet selection. And we had no problem leaving a $40 tip to I am not ashamed to say I didn't leave a tip for our server. I believe in servers earning their tips. Regardless of what they earn an hour is of no responsibility to the consumer, and all a grudge that needs to be take up with their employer. If you're relying on tips to makeup for what your employer lacks to provide, you better damn we'll be performing as such. Subpar performance begets subpar compensation.   We were trying to be fair to try out a new Brazilian bbq restaurant. Our mistake. But never again.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came to Vegas to celebrate our two-year anniversary and we are so glad we came to Pampas because they certainly helped make it a memorable one!  We purchased the Groupon dinner deal for $82 that included the Surf and Turf meal, one dessert, and one hour of unlimited beers, wines, sangrias, and caipirinhas. If it's still available, I HIGHLY recommend purchasing the deal!  LOCATION Pampas is a restaurant off the beaten path. And what I mean by off the beaten path is that it's located in Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile but you'd have to actively search for it because you won't actually stumble upon it. It's actually hidden behind two table service restaurants whose names I can't remember, but if you know where the Panda Express is then you're near it!  RESERVATIONS / SEATING You can easily make a reservation via phone or by Open Table and I'll always recommend Open Table because it's just another way to rack up rewards points for eating at great restaurants. We made reservations at the last minute (like made a reservation for 2 at 9:30 an hour before the time we requested) and despite us being late we were still accommodated. Granted, it wasn't a very busy night, but I always appreciate when a restaurant can accommodate for us.   We wanted a more secluded dining area so instead of sitting indoors in the main room or bar area we were seated outside in the corner two top.   DINING EXPERIENCE Absolutely phenomenal. Our server Hallie was truly on top of her game and had continuously sent us refills on our alcoholic beverages every time she noticed they were running low/empty.   The meal itself was great. The surf and turf meal includes the churrascaria experience where the runners walk to your tables and offer you different cuts of meat but also includes a family style platter of seafood, which includes mussels, orange glazed tilapia, shrimp, and salmon. If you're on a budget, I'd say skip the surf and turf, but since I bought the Groupon deal it was just a wonderful perk of our meal.   The meats are cooked to medium rare so if you have a sensitive stomach like I do, you can always ask to have the meat cooked medium well or well done and they'll cut a slice for you and cook it inside their kitchen. Keep in mind that it won't come out immediately!  One thing I also liked is that if you have a particular type of meat you're looking for, like top sirloin or filet mignon wrapped bacon, you can always ask your server and he/she can order it for you! Unlike many churrascarias, this was definitely a great option and I like that they use iPads to place your orders.   DRINKS First, water is NOT free! I honestly did not appreciate having to pay $2 for a bottle of water and my server didn't actually tell us that because we assumed it was already included in the meal. Anyways, just a heads up.   Caipirinhas: they have so many different flavors!! The sweetest is the strawberry and of course the best you'll get is lime. These are very strong in alcohol content and after the third drink, I could definitely feel it... so plan ahead and take a cab or uber here!  Sangrias: WHITE SANGRIA ALL THE WAY. I honestly could not even taste the wine in this at all. It just tasted like fruit juice, which to me is always the mark of a truly great sangria.   DESSERT You get to choose between four different types: chocolate mousse, tiramisu cake, flan, and one other dessert I honestly can't remember.  We chose the tiramisu and it was a perfect finish to a very filling dinner! The cake was light, airy, and had the perfect hint of coffee.   -- Overall, I would love to return to Pampas based on the wonderful experience my boyfriend and I had. My only gripe is that their meat is very dry and they don't exactly have sauces for them either. For a churrascaria, I find this a bit problematic as meats as your specialty and they are not cooked to well done either. So I hope in the future they can find a way to make their meats juicier so that when I do return I can confidently give them the 5 star rating they deserve.  (26/100)",

We are both vegetarians so we were unsure what exactly we could order because it is a steakhouse but we gave it a try and thankfully we did.   Our server was extremely helpful when we said that we were never here before but explained that we were vegetarians so we may be ordering odd items. He took the time to explain the menu to us and went over options that would work for our dietary restrictions. We started with a beer and diet coke. For dinner I ordered salmon with mashed potatoes and vegetables and my husband had linguine with mussels, shrimp, crab and a lobster tail. Both meals came with their salad bar. To our surprise the salad bar had MUCH more than just salad. They offered rice and potatoes, different types of quinoa and couscous salads and even fruit. All were extremely delicious.   We were both extremely pleased with our dinners and my husband actually had half of my salmon because it was so delicious. I tried his lobster tail and some pasta and his was also great and he said that the entire meal was amazing and some of his favorite to date. We still had $5 left on the gift card which was pretty amazing since we had eaten so much food already so we had a chocolate mousse for desert which was more filling and large than I had anticipated. The service was amazing, the food was delicious and their salad bar was under rated. All prices were extremely reasonable- especially their prices for their steaks and the full brazilian steakhouse experience. I would definitely return if I came back to Las Vegas.",

They are not looking for repeat business, and I hope for the sake of others, they'll be out of business soon.    They have deals to sucker people in, but they've trained their staff to add additional hidden costs without your prior knowledge.  It's a lot like getting a cheap airline ticket and you think it's a great deal; only to find out that their raping your pocket book for things that should be complimentary.  For example, they charged an $8 mandatory water assigned to every table that DOES NOT include free refills (OF WATER?!) --just to start.  A meal ended up being $300 (for 2 adults) @ 3pm in less than an hour; so needless to say that coupon I bought basically did jack squat.    I'm telling you in all sincerity, this restaurant somehow managed to be a complete SCAM.    For your own peace of mind, please avoid this place.  There are better places with better service where you can walk away feeling good.    ****Absolute WORST PLACE to bring family members or a date.  In fact, if you love mediocre food and over-priced hidden fees, and you're not paying, then yeah, for sure; I would definitely bring my WORST ENEMY if it was on their tab, 100%",

He went and spoke to the manager. After that we had the UNLIMITED MEAT!!!!! Everyone was coming to our table now!! Overall experience I will eat here again. They just need to have a better system so they don't skip over tables....",

I was super skeptical because the fine print said gratitude would be included and taxes so I wasn't sure if we would be getting another surprise in the bill. The waitress did bring water and said they charge a $1 \"water conservation fee\" per person because the water is filtered. Never heard of this but we agreed, water is super necessary especially in Vegas. We weren't checked on very often and our food took an outrageous amount of time to appear. BUT it was really yummy. I've had a few burgers while I've been here and I wasn't to happy. This burger surpassed my expectations. Bill came out no other added fee's.   A photo person comes around taking complementary photos post card size but they will try to sell you bigger prints for like $35",

It's Vegas calm down.   Coming back with less drinks in us allowed us to see it's True self lol. They have two types of pampas one just the meat the other with an addition of seafood. Which is typically tilapia, cocktail shrimp and mussels. It's not worth to me. I think anyone is better off getting the meat pampas and a side of lobster tail.   This go round the meats were not in a great rotation. I understand that they serve once it is cooked to walk around but this needs much better management. I didn't see any pork going around until after I was full and let me tell you it was a long time before I got full. The dishes for your sides were meh. Plantains, which happens to be my favorite, is usually soft and sticking to others. I wish they were freshly fried and didn't stick. The sides table is also poorly placed. In the very back is where you have to walk. I can see someone who has a problem to complain due to them liking to seat everyone need the bar or on the mall patio.  Drinks are so so. Get a shot honestly. Service could have been better. Server was leaving mid time of our dinner. She explained who was coming after her. Before she left the table we ordered another drink. It took forever to come, I guess she didn't relay the message to anyone. Someone who looks like the manager went by the bar and was curious who the drink belong to. Found us and said sorry. By that time a sorry couldn't help.   If you are going to eat here it's best to get a voucher. Please don't spend your money here, it isn't worth it.",

When we saw what it was, we decided to get it next time.   Food was very good and meat was juicy.   Our check took quite a while cause I had a bogo, but whatever.

I mean, don't get me wrong, the place was very classy, the food was good, and the service was impeccable.   However, a couple things were a little heavy on the salt. Sometimes, salt brings out the flavor in dark meat. But salty chicken? Umm . .  no thanks. Am I being a picky bastard? Its possible. I'm actually just comparing them to the Brazilian restaurants I've had here in Los Angeles.   Overall, I really liked the place. I would definitely go back.",

With such a prime location and an okay decor it is a shame that its atmosphere matches its food, very sub par. About the only thing this restaurant gets right is its staff and regrettably its beans, and you don't wanna be known for just your beans but congratulations. To say that you got your bang for your buck at this establishment is as False of a statement as is their \"fresh food.\" I spent about $90 on this so called special that I wish I could've spent at Burger King which has fresher food and more variety in its dollar menu than Pampas does in its whole restaurant; disappointing. The  badly dressed waiter comes around with about 4 options every 10 minutes. Yes that's correct 4 which 2 of them are wrapped in the same ingredient; bacon. Not much left to the taste buds. The average price at this place is $130 for 2 people. Please be advised the absolute disappointment you will feel paying for what should be a $40 meal. If you wanna get ripped off then your 2 options are using a taxi cab on the strip , taking a picture with Donald Duck or going to Pampas Churrascaria.",

Our server was friendly & attentive. We had the ultimate surf and turf rodizio, but the seafood wasn't that impressive & next time I think just the meat rodizio would be sufficient. We had a Groupon which made it more affordable, but I subtracted a star because it still is kinda pricey compared to other more high-end churrascarias I've been to. Nice angle of awarding a free dessert for showing your Yelp review to the server, though ;-)",

I've been to a few if this style of dining in other cities and really enjoyed it however this one missed the mark.   Salad Bar - decent good with some variety   Meats - most were chewy and lacking flavour with the exception of the lamb.   Surf- a seafood mixed grill plate. Salmon was mentioned but wasn't on the plate. Grey meat, limp shelled, cold grab. Ok shrimp.   Pineapple this is what we cave for. It was not the lovely caramelized version I'm used to but charred lukewarm fruit.   Staff - served by Andreas. (sp?) and he was attentive & courteous. The guys that brought the assorted meats were all pleasant. I am writing thus review while still at Pampa. We are seated near the bar. At the bar are some off duty staff including some that did not work today. I know this because they are drunk and speaking so loudly we can hear their entire conversation....including profanity every fourth word. There is a reason that most places don't allow staff to drink on site.  Basically this place survives because people sometimes like us don't make dinner plans early enough and end up here.   If you have another choice go there. I wish we had.",

The way the restaurant is set up is really weird. You have to walk to the other side of the restaurant to get to the buffet.   Every single thing from the buffet was bland. The meats that were brought to your table are mostly medium rare or rare. So if ur not into bloody meats stay away from here. The only meat that was good was the tri-tip.

The salad bar had a large selection to choose from including rice, potatoes, and cheeses. The servers constantly were at my table with more and more meats that were very well seasoned. You definitely want to come here prepared to eat and without being on a diet.   The alcoholic beverages were also delicious, as well as the desserts. I will be back again on my next visit to Vegas.",

    "text": "AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL!!! I regret even looking at the groupon to go here. We literally left and went and ate somewhere else the food was so bad. We sat down and were greeted and got our drinks going and were told a plate of seafood would be out and the meat would be around and to help ourselves to sides. We thought that was okay but then we ate. The sides were about the same as a horrible buffet the only thing edible was the watermelon go figure. The seafood plate arrived with tasteless horribly overlook shrimp that was inedible and mussels that we were pretty convinced were food poisoning waiting to happen and salmon and tilapia that was so awful we spit it out. The meat carvers were often no where to be seen and would come around with the same things. The biggest gross was the bacon wrapped filet. He put it on my plate and I bit in and it was completely raw on the inside, not rare but raw and had a bad taste. My husband who normally eats anything and is not picky even said it was the worst food he'd ever had and he eats fast food.   Our groupon had dessert included and it too was awful. We ordered tiramisu as it is a favorite and it literally tasted like water I didn't even want it. Never never again will we return or recommend. Being Las Vegas there are tons of places to eat that are less expensive and have much much better food. If you like good food don't go here because you won't find it.  You may think this place is good because of the good reviews but you will be shocked. They are good reviews because they will give you a free dessert for writing a review and showing it to them at the table. The people who do that are not going to be honest when they have to show it to the server . . . Think about it.",

The guys who come by to slice meat on your plate or a little rude and pay little attention. There really is no point asking for rare or even medium rare as this establishment seems to only believe in overcooked or burnt and dry. At least there wasn't a wait and we had 8 people with no reservations on a Saturday morning. DO NOT TRY THEIR SANGRIA. It's terrible unless you're into Robitussin on ice. We went with the mimosas, they ran out of Shocktop. With the mimosas it seemed like 90/10 ratio on orange juice/champagne. I can't get over how overyly dry everything was.... no flavor... just dry as hell. Even their salmon! The only thing my party really ate was their shrimp. Clams were practically dehydrated. I used a Groupon and still left soooo dissatisfied. We should have just went to Taco Bell Cantina, lol. Also... who charges for water? Sure, the water is held in a frosty bottle... but you aren't able to take the water bottle home. They  just fill up the water bottle and then charge people $2  per person whether you even want water or not. PASSSSSS.",

Ordered drinks, my margarita tastes like sour limes dipped in sugar so i sent it back. Then our meat comes out, and literally everything was dry and so over cooked. The seafood was the same (the shrimp was so hard and tasteless). And then i discovered a hair in my food. So I obviously stopped eating and got the waitress. She told her manager who came out and was quite possibly the dumbest manager I have ever spoken to. After a few minutes of him staring and mumbling an apology, he brought me a bottle of wine to take home. So that part was nice, but still doesnt make up for the fact that a damn hair was in my food, the service was awful, and the food was disgusting. So, I do not recommend this restaurant at all.",

Just received a text message from my parents that they are unable to use the groupon, as it would be a minimum of an additional $20 for the meal due to \"holiday prices.\"  This was not mentioned on the groupon.  When they spoke to the manager about it, he suggested that we write to groupon and get our money back, if we were not happy with it.  Done and done.  Although my parents are left present-less.  :(  I don't care for the ethics of this place and have had two poor experiences, I wouldn't suggest it to anyone.",

The second time we went, we brought our two kids and it was around 7 pm.  The restaurant was a little crowded and not as enjoyable as our first visit.  I don't think my kids fully appreciated the all you can eat concept and would rather have had pizza or burgers.

    "text": "I think I enjoyed the whole experience of a Brazilian grill more than the actual food itself.  Doesn't make sense, I know...but I liked that the servers brought out huge cuts of meat on these giant spears and sliced it right at your table, and there wasn't too much time inbetween meats.  There was also a big selection of hot side dishes and cold salads to choose from at the salad bar buffet.  The downside  was that the hot sides weren't so hot and the cold salads were about the same temp.  I liked the beans, rice, and the yummy parmesan-crusted moist and flakey rolls (which managed to stay warm).  Those were the only memorable sides.  The memorable meats were the pork loin, moist and well-seasoned, although a bit too salty, the turkey sausage, thick and juicy, the spicy chicken, crisp on the outside, moist inside, the roast beef (deliciously tender) , and the lamb, though not that tender had great flavor.  And the grilled pineapple was the bomb.  That night we had efficient and friendly service.    Of all the choices you have in Vegas, this is a pretty decent one if you get the discount price from the \"1/2 price ticket booth\".  It's a great deal...you pay the ticket booth a $3pp fee, they make the reservations for you (definitely recommended) and give you a voucher for $19.99pp.  The all-u-can-eat meats and salad bar is regularly $36.99pp.  My total bill, including a glass of wine, tax & tip, was $35.  Not bad for a nice restaurant on the Strip.",

Pampas was the first place that I called and I couldn't have gotten luckier.  I spoke with Alysia and she reassured me that whatever I needed she would make sure that we got it.  I had a crew of 60 people to feed and the first location was at Lake Mead about and hour away from Las Vegas.    Alysia drove her own personal vehicle out to where we were shooting and delivered our lunch to us.  We ordered an assortment of box lunches, box salads and soups.  I have had my share of box lunches while working on location and Pampas box lunches were by far the best I have had.  They were fresh and delicious, and the condiments all came on the side (including lettuce and tomato)   The crew couldn't have been happier.    We made sure to get our order in that day for the following shoot day and new location which was The Valley of Fire.  Again, Alysia drove her car out to meet us in the middle of the desert,  and delivered our lunch.    When the crew broke, people were literally running to the table to make sure and get  soup that day.   Again we couldn't have been happier.    They were dependable and the fact that I just worked with one person the whole time really made me feel like she was taking care of us.   Next time that I am in Las Vegas I am making it a priority to go in and have authentic Brazilian food.    Thank you Pampas.  J",

Once seated instead of being greeted by our waitress Angie, she asked \"Do you guys have any coupons of any kind?\" Like really??? No, 'Hi My name is______ & I will be your server tonight. Can I get you started with a cocktail, glass of wine or beer?' Yes! I know all about a good service. My husband & I travel a lot so we like to try different restaurants when traveling and we have NEVER been asked for coupons before they take our drink order. So I guess having a coupon determines their service, we thought. We both went with the 7 types of meat & salad bar (can't remember the actual name) I believe they run for $21. The salad bar had a good selection of items, pretty much a meal of its own. The PASADORES (the guys passing around the meat) were extremely attentive & very polite the entire time, too bad our waitress wasn't. We liked every type of meat we tried, specially the pork! By far one of the best grilled pork we've ever had. Yes, the food is in fact delicious & for the price we think it's worth it BUT a good restaurant with good food is nothing without good service which is why I'm giving this place 3 stars.",

No problem we went and walked out in front entrance for there was no seating inside but stood by the entrance. We had been waiting for about 15 minutes and walked back to check if they had our table. The front desk asked me for my name again and said have a seat. About another 15 min go by and they finally called our name and the host had told me they called my name already and another guest had taken our reservation and was seated. No big deal it happens. We waited almost 10 minutes for a server to come to our table. He just took our drink order and walked away. We sat there not knowing what to do here and how it worked. He finally came back after a long time had passed with our drinks and explained what we were to do. Salad bar was very delicious but I was not too happy about the meat carvers. We only had 4 to 5 different carvers to table and 2 was the same meat. We has one serving of shrimp/salmon and one serving of pineapple. We were there for an hour and a half from time of checking in and eating. I would never pay full price for this place for customer service is terrible. The salmon was absolutely terrible. I would never recommend this place to anyone.",

I'll reserve my judgment because this was my first and so far only BBBQ experience.   Here's how it works: They have a buffet with salad, beans and rice, which is good. Then people come to your table with different types of overcooked meat and put it on your plate. They have a turkey meat that is basically turkey sandwich meat in cube form. At $40 per person, the food was disappointing.   Luckily, our waiter probably sensed we were underwhelmed and put an imaginary $40 off coupon or our bill. However, even at half the price, I wouldn't go back to Pampas. I'd rather get room service and listen to Nancy Grace tell me her opinion of Tiger Woods.",

Fortunately, me and my buddies happened to run into Pampas on the way to one of the buffets. There was a hotess outside, later on I found out she was the manager, Michele Riordan. She was super friendly and even offered to give us a tour of the restaurant before we decide if we wanted to eat there or not.   After the tour, we were nothing but convinced! All you can eat meat and seafood. The salad bar was fresh and food was excellent! We went during lunch, so it wasn't to busy. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. He made sure our drinks were re-filled and plenty of food stayed on our table.   Sidenote: Its making my mouth water just writing this review! =P. lol My favorite item, had to be the scallops wrapped in bacon!   Overall, if you're looking for a nice place to eat and you're a meat eater and especially a seafood lover, this place would be perfect for you spend your buffet money on this place! And if your counting calories don't even waste your time here.           The food was YUMMY! Can't wait to go back!",

Put the green facing up and the meat will keep coming.  the pork was my fav, it was juicy and cooked just nice. however, the service was slow, maybe because it was during the peak hours. overall, i really like this restaurant, and i will come back next time.",

Variety of meats, most were very good, some were tough, but the bacon wrapped chicken was terrific - tender and tasty. The negative that lowered my star rating was that the staff was cold and unfriendly.  Our server was inattentive and could never be found for drink refills or our bill when we needed to leave.  Only one of about a half-dozen meat servers was friendly and eager to please.  He was the only server that was older. The young kid servers were a horrible representation for the establishment.    If they could clean up their act with their staff, I believe they would get 4+. Stars on their overall scores.",

    "text": "Amazing Service, Amazing Food, and Amazing experience.  This was my first trip to vegas and found a groupon to pampas for a really great price .my boyfriend' and i decided to get it.  Flash forward to today 7/30/13: everything at pampas was great. We really recommend this restaurant. The food was very good, except the reason for 4/5 stars instead of 5/5 was that some of the items were a bit to salty in my opinion. But still good!   What really blew me away was their customer service, our waitress was awesome(i think her name is Kelly, long haired brunette)  and the guys serving the meats were super friendly. Even with an unexpected incident during our lunch that Pampas could not prevent they very kindly offered us another lunch for the next day on the house!! That truly says a lot to me about the manager and their staff.   Now on 7/31/13 , we had a different server i think her name was Miranda or something like that. idk if she was new but She never checked up on us or anything it was always a different girl getting us new plates and drinks. So that felt a little weird but again we had a great experience here and definitely recommend it!!   Thank you Pampas! Definitely a to go spot for us on our next Vegas trip  :)",

Over cooked meat, cold sides when they should've been warm, and the most disgusting Sangria that tastes like it was made with a $1 bottle of stale wine. We ordered the white sangria and it tasted like a cup of pure sugar. After sending that back, we got the red sangria. Yuck again. We sat at a table right by where all the servers walk and there were points where the meat guys walked right by without even a glance over even though we had green up. We waited 20 minutes before the first one came and we were almost done with our entire plate of salad and sides. We requested the bacon wrapped filet and the waitress three times said she had directed them over yet no one came. Usually I stay hours at a Brazilian steakhouse; this visit lasted less than 45 minutes. We couldn't wait to get out of there!!!",

The salad bar was medium sized and more like a side bar rather than salad bar. They had a few good sauce options and very nice sauteed mushrooms. The shrimp is not grilled though, it's boiled like in Chinese restaurants. Overall a good experience but not the best.",

We were a little skeptical being this is in a tourist area on how the service and quality of food would compare.  The quality of meats is amazing and top grade.  The side bar has all of the Brazilian favorite including delicious fried plantains, beans, and great selection of olive along with American sides and salads.  Andre our waiter was the best!

    "text": "I came here with my girlfriend on a Tuesday evening and I honestly never even knew this restaurant existed. We had found a groupon which was $65 all you can eat surf and turf + salad bar, plus 2 cocktails and 1 dessert. First off, it says $65, but after tipping (we tipped according to how much it would have been without the deal) it cost us about $95 total. It still isn't a bad deal because I think our total would have been about $140 (not including tax or tip) anyways if we didn't have the groupon.  It was pretty busy when we got there so that was a good sign I guess. The waiter was very attentive and showed us the details of our deal and what we got. I was thinking that we get two free cocktails regardless of what they were, but actually there is a list of 4 to choose from. This includes a mojito, 2 brazilian cocktails, or a margarita. My girlfriend chose the margarita and I chose the mojito. I feel like the mojito barely had any alcohol in it, but the margarita was super strong haha.  The salad bar isn't really that big compared to Via Brasil and Texas De Brazil. Regardless, I enjoyed the roasted mushrooms, pasta salad, beets, and cheese bread (amazing, might I add). I know my girlfriend loved the mashed potatoes and the cheese bread too.  Ok, now the meat and seafood. The shrimp isn't peeled, which really bothers me for some reason. They do taste good though after you peel them and whatnot. The mahi mahi didn't taste right to me, and the salmon was OK - nothing too amazing about it. I think the best of the meats were the bacon wrapped filet mignon, bacon wrapped chicken, beef tenderloin and spicy sausage. My girlfriend really REALLY liked the bacon wrapped chicken though haha.  For dessert we had the Tiramisu which was pretty good.  Last but not least, service was great and our server was on top of everything. He kept our waters filled up and was very attentive, which is a big deal for me.  Overall I think this place was OK....nothing too spectacular or amazing about it. If it were up to me I'd probably just go to Via Brasil especially since it is only 5 min from my house. I don't think we'll come back to Pampas.",

Kept having to ask for creamer for the coffee, & they left the used salad plates on the table till we ask them to take them away (tables are VERY small).  They tables are so crowded together that you could hear the conversation at the table next to you.

At one point I got up and cleared off our own plates and took them to the bar then got new plates myself.

    "text": "Went for two reasons: 1. It was at Planet Hollywood, where there's free parking and the coolest casino, where we were going to play at the tables later; 2. We had a 2-for-1 coupon. We made a reservation, but at 6:00 on Saturday night we would have been ok without it; HOWEVER, when we left at 7:30, there was a lineup of 50 people waiting. Suggestion: reserve by calling, or using OpenTable app. We ordered the Rodizio dinner - endless meats (12 selections) plus endless shrimp plus salad bar. Normally $68 per person, but 2-for-1 made it $34 each. Not a bad price for really good food, and lots of it. Caveat: you also have to order a beverage (didn't see that on the coupon), so we went with the one-hour open bar for $20 (per person).  Wife hit the salad bar; I did not. Why waste tummy room on veggies and cheese. I did check it out, and it looked good; but I was there for the meats. All of them were tasty - especially the sausage and the sirloin options. Grilled shrimps came 8 at a time with a really tasty homemade teriyaki sauce, which was so good that I was putting it on everything I ate - including the grilled pineapple. Our server was Amber. She was awesome. She fully explained the coupon before we ordered (a party sat after we did but weren't aware of the wording and pricing. Amber explained it, and told them to take some time to think about it, enjoy a glass of water and she'd be back to check on them. I tried to convince them to stay and eat, but they ended up leaving). She made drink suggestions, informed us on how the evening would go, and offered to get me a special plate of well done meats. She was jovial and attentive to all her tables. She kept the drinks coming and even introduced us to the manager (we were talking to her about using an iPad and app for seating tables, rather than the white board and dry erase marker the hostess was using. The manager agreed, and informed us that someone dropped the iPad a few days earlier)(for shits and giggles, on the way out, I asked the hostess if I could see the white board so I could check my email. She just smiled.) We left really stuffed, very happy. If you like meat, come with an appetite, and ask to sit in Ambers section. You'll be well taken care of.",

    "text": "We purchased a Living Social deal, $43 for two for the meat rodizio.  Awesome deal!  The salad bar itself is alright, and most of the meats were bland.  The chicken is really good though (especially the bacon wrapped chicken).  Our dirty plates and glasses were never once picked up, so by the end of our dinner, we had a pile of dirty plates and glasses on our small table.  One of the good things was that we made reservations through open table, and we were seated right away when we got there.  I think there's better brazilian restaurants in Vegas.  I won't be coming back.",

They basically just gave us their separate dining room to house our guests and then did their usual service.   The food was amazing and there's no complaints about the service. But I personally didn't like the the layout of the place.   The salad bar area was cumbersome and not very plentiful, but other than that, I'm a fan.   I'd probably return as a normal patron if I were ever in the area and starving, with a hankering for a side of meat... or three.",

Even the rice was gross, really, how u mess up rice,  Im not sure,  pasta was tasteless, the mozzarella tasted weird, The olives were super salty, the only side I liked was the kale, so meat was so so, why did the pineapple and ham not come together? I did not enjoy myself here and would not come back or refer my friends ro eat here.  Service is very very poor! We were a party of 6 and gratuity of $40, for very poor slow service.  Took them 20 minutes to get us water and the manager, useless! One of the staff said they were a little short staffed, but the manager just stood there and didnt even bother to help. Nice job manager!",

After the server explained the process, and invited us to their salad bar, meats just kept coming, non stop until you flip the little indicator that u are done...... GLUTTONY 101 HERE, GUYS...  Good atmosphere in a group of 8, the only reason they didn't get 5 stars from me is 2 fold:  First, the group on was limited to 1 per table and our group all wanted to sit together (they have to realize most parties travel is bigger groups and if we're going out to eat, we want to sit together)... Now, they did end up letting us all sit together, but that led to the 2nd 'issue', which was they tried to give us one bill at the end of the night w/ gratuity charged to the retail value of the meal(s) (not the group on prices), not based on our invidual meal receipts....   Now, after brining up the issue, they did split our bills according, but the gratuity was still being charged based off the full retail price of the Surf and Turf dinner...  I'm an excellent tipper, I didn't need them doing it for me, but again, it's Vegas so I understood.  Overall, good deal, great food, great times!!!!",

    "text": "Went to eat here during a bachelor party weekend in Vegas and got food poisoning/stomach virus. Me and my friends ate here for dinner and believe that the lamb they were served was undercooked. As a result, a lot of us spent the night throwing up, using the restroom, and felt like crap the last night of our weekend.   All of us got home and had fevers, body aches, and the works.   In addition to the sickness, the service was bad here.  We arrived at 7:30, were given some food, and then for 20-30 minutes, no one stopped at our table!  We watched as server by server walked down an aisle towards us then made a sharp right turn and went into a room.  That was our whole experience, watching servers with all the meats just ignore our table and walk to another room.  After one of us got a hold of the manager,  all of a sudden about 6 servers came to our table with all the meats, and including the tainted lamb, which seemed undercooked, like they rushed to bring meat to our table.  What should've been a fairly quick dinner (so we could watch a show later) instead took over two hours because of the slow and lackluster service.  If you like being served meats, then wait another 20-30 minutes with nothing while your stomach gets full, then get bombarded with a bunch of undercooked meats, this is the place for you!",

I know, clearly I have issues and I may or may not have been living under a rock the last few years based on my friends reactions to that confession, but after all the hype I was ready for some disappointment. Unfortunately, the only disappointing thing I found about our visit is that I don't have 4 stomachs like a cow. I'm pretty sure I could have fit in more meat...  Our waiter Alejandro was amazing, he truly truly took care of us and explained everything about the process to me. I was a little nervous about not getting attention from the gauchos because of our location (tucked in the corner by the entrance out of sight), but he totally made sure we were taken care of. And when I mentioned I was sad I'd eaten all my pineapple, he had some brought by lickety split! But to top THAT off - oh man, he hooked us up with the ladies who make the caipirinhas! Those ladies were amazing, Tata made us some fantastic drinks while also training a new girl (whose name I missed, but she was great!). I'd totally go back the next time I'm in Vegas.  All in all, fantastic experience. Get the Tri Tip! Don't turn down the pineapple. Don't eat lunch beforehand...maybe skip breakfast too.

    "text": "We had decided to eat dinner there last night and we were promptly seated, even though our reservation wasn't for another 30 min. Everything was looking great and smelling great... But then after we were seated in the private dinning area in the wine racks, it was like we were forgotton. The waiter came and took our drink orders and my parents bottle of wine. He returned almost 10 minutes later with water glasses and left. We didn't receive our water until we finally were able to grab someone passing by the door to ask for our water. That was over 20 minutes. And finally the water came. It took nearly 30-35minutes. The wine came and the waters too. We were so thirsty from a long day in the sun. The waiter took out order, and returned to check on us once after that. It took nearly another 40 min to recieve the food we had ordered. My father and little brother ordered the meat rodizuo. The all you can meats brought to you on a sword. Well they waited and waiter after three of use recieved our plates but only 2 of the servers came by and served them just chicken. It wasnt till the three out of five were almost done with our food that, I had to ask the manager for service for the meat ridizuo orders. So we had to sit and wait for them to get served and to eat.   The service was bad and so was the timing. You would think that paying 300 for dinner, that the service would be better. What an awefule experince to have when you hungry and hoping for the service that is expected in any restaurant. We would have been better served at dennys.",

I also liked the pineapples! They slice the pineapple at the table and its so warm, sweet, and juicy! I also really loved the salad bar because it came with a lot of different varieties of veggies. :)   They also served turkey wrapped in bacon and some brazillian sausage, but those were just whatever. The ham was not one of my favorites because it was so salty.   I also tried their raspberry mojito and it was so bomb. They actually crush whole raspberries because you can see it in your drink! It was so refreshing and cooling. The perfect compliment to your meat :)",

    "text": "When you walk into this place, your senses will be overwhelmed with meat. Chicken, all cuts of beef, and a pineapple.  Meat lovers should rejoice at this location.  Should.  (more on that later) The wait was incredibly fast, but that's because we had reservations.  The atmosphere is fine. Mood lighting throughout, unless you had \"outdoor\" seating, The restaurant is nicely setup.  They had a buffet tucked in the corner with hot foods and cold salads.  Waiters walked everywhere carrying large slices of meat.  We order the two dishes, their salmon and rib eye.   I have to say their salmon sauce is amazing, it was sweet, tangy and a touch of sour. However, the salmon itself is crap. The meat itself was tasteless and dry.   Its as if their supplier picked the lowest quality fish available and gave it this restaurant.   Sure, Pampas tried (and did a fine job of) masking the tasteless fish with a wonderful sauce.   But that farmed, previously frozen salmon meat is still crap.     Their Rib Eye was overcooked (and a tad crunchy)on the outside. But medium rare on the inside.  The menu may brag about their sea salt rubbed, seasoned beef.  I just taste salt.  As in, they may have overdid the salt.  The salad bar is a free-for-all. Lots of people crowded in, with all kinds of options.  I don't know where the lines started, or ended.   (Or maybe it was just our timing.)   Their soups was fine.  Salads are, well, salads.  Spinach, pastas, artichokes, asparagus.    The salad bar offers a good number of choices.   I really can't say bad things about their selection.  But then again, I can't say good things either.   Overall, the food is only 3 stars(or closer to 2.5 stars.) Would I go back? No, there are so many other choices that exist in Vegas.",

    "text": "If I could give this place a negative digit rating, I would. It seems like everyone only goes to this place cause they have coupons, which a lot of people agreed was a False advertisement and wasn't worth it. If you dont want to read my long dragged out story about my experience at this restaurant, I'll tell it to you straight. This place is a joke. Money hungry jerks wanting to rip you off, and the food and service is terrible. Definitely not worth the money. I have lived in Las Vegas my whole life and have ate at some very prestigious and fantastic restaurants. This was definitely not one, even if it was much cheaper than it is. Point plank, AVOID AT ALL COSTS.   Ok, let my story of this miserable meal begin. I admit I have never eaten at a restaurant with this type of menu or set up. Sort of a buffet, but much more complicated. I was with my good friend, we decided to go to miracle mile to do a bit of shopping. Once we found what we wanted, we decided we wanted to eat. He had eaten at a Brazilian grill similar to this in rio, brazil. He said he liked it when he had it, and all I really wanted was a lobster tail. We went in, got a table, and our waiter came over, I think I recall his name being Eric.  He started explaining the menu to us. I didn't completely comprehend because all I really wanted was lobster with was $17 all la cart. pretty much you can get the unlimited salad bar for $25/person and add meat for an extra amount. Neither of us added the meat, so I don't know what it would have came out to. I just got the lobster, I wasn't that hungry and thought I would have been fine. My friend just did the salad bar for $25, no meat included. So no one came around to us with the skewers of food, so I can't comment on the quality of the meat. So first with the salad bar, it's about the size of kitchen island counter. Nothing really great, some lettuce, veggies, antipasti, and soup. Definitely not worth the $25.  So we ordered, and my friend got right up and went to get some food. I stayed at the table, hoping my lobster would show up soon. My friend came back with a plate full of very low quality food. Right then I remembered my medication, that I need to take with food. No big deal, I picked up my fork and grabbed two small fork fulls of Caesar salad off his plate. Right as I took the second bite, which was all I planned on taking just to get my medication in me, the waiter came over and very rudely said, \"mam, you can't eat off his plate, I have to charge you the $25.\" FOR TWO BITES??!! Ok, first, I am a 5' 3\", 100lbs, 21 year old woman, it wasn't like I mauled his plate, or got up and grabbed my own plate. I freaked. I understand people try to pull stuff like that all the time, but he literally watched me pick up my fork, take two bites, and put my fork back down. What he should have said was \"mam, if you want food from the var, I have to charge you $25. If not you can please put your fork down.\" Nope. He just said charging you $25 and walked away. I was very angry, mumbling cuss words under my breath. My friend was going to pay, and I wasn't going to allow him to pay for it when I didn't need or use the bar.  Then my lobster came, just the tail, a cup of butter, and a lemon wedge. I cut it up, and looked at my plate. I couldn't believe it, I literally took three bites and the food was gone. The taste was good, but the portion was ridiculous, especially for $17. When I was done, I was heated. My friend flagged down the waiter and asked him if he was seriously going to charge me for the two bites and why he couldnt have pretended he didnt see it. The waiter went off, \"sir, this is my job. I could loose my job over that.\" Blah blah blah. While I was thinking, who are you? Why the hell should I care about your job? I care about getting ripped off, not your problems. That's when we told him to bring over the manager. He said ok and went to go get him. He came back and simply said, \"he took the $25 off your bill\", and stormed away. Even the manger knew the whole thing was ridiculous. Needless to say Eric didn't get a tip. Moral of the story? This place is a joke. Food portion and salad bar quality is a joke. Ridiculous prices for not so great food or service. I am very angry with this resurant and I will definitely never go back, let alone acknowledge that it even exists. Avoid this place unless you want to be broke and left hungry and dissatisfied.",

Not too crowded but had to wait about 5 minutes or more just to have someone come and take a drink order or offer water.  This place is not concerned with service at all.   Decor was okay but you are seated really close to other people and there wasn't a lot of room if you are making trips to the salad bar.  We had questions about the menu.  They do a table side sliced meat deal... they call it a \"parade of meats\".  They run between $48.95 to $54.95 including their \"50 item hot and cold salad bar\".  The rest of the menu was priced high too.    Funny thing about the service... when the came to offer my husband his first \"slice of meat\"... he didn't even have a plate... when we asked about getting a plate... they told him he had to go get one at the salad bar.  REALLY... you want to charge someone $48.95 for a meal and you have to go get your own plate.  WHAT???  (okay, so we had a $10 off coupon but still... if I am paying $$$$ for a meal.. I want real service)  I had the boulliabase (small over cooked split lobster tails, about 6 shrimp and a lot of mussels over pasta in a broth) which also came with the all you can eat salad bar ($39.95).  Over all... was only mediocre and I ddin't even take my unfinished pasta back to our place.  Mhusband had the \"meat parade\"  which included pork tenderloin, tri tip which he like, filet (parmesean crusted), a dried out chicken thigh, ham, sirloin, and some bacon wrapped turkey I think.  My kids had the sirloin and the tenderloin (around $35 each as well).    Even with coupons, $150 for 4 people, no desert and only one glass of wine... so not worth it.",

    "text": "Was given a coupon to this place by one of the numerous trolls they pay to pass fliers out on The Strip. The coupon was 'buy one dinner get another free which the coupon says would be 31.95 instead of 60+ dollars so long as you buy 2 soft drinks. That sounded like a pretty good deal. So we schlep on over to the restaurant.   We get seated and looking over the menu notice that  perhaps the advertised deal was not what it seems. Dinner for one is 60+ so the deal now seams to be buy 1 dinner for 51.95 plus drinks to get the other free.  For that price, I could have gone to the Wynn or similar casino and had dinner at the name chef restuarants.... just saying.  I call the waitress over and ask her about the coupon to which she replies '\"a lot of people think that it's 31.95 plus two drinks but it's actually 51.95\". Now, my command of English is pretty good if I may say so myself, and having been to Law School and all that, I think intelligent enough. So it seems to me that they deliberately mislead people as to what the price will be and hope that once you get there you'll be too embarrased or resigned to leave. So I LEFT.  Funny though, that the same restuarant also has a breakfast special of 5.95 for steak, 2 eggs, breakfast potatoes and a pastry, yet want to charge 51.95 for their dinner. Uh, OK. In the Las Vegas magazines, the place is rated $$ which seems a bit inaccurate too.",

Unfortunately, the service was slow and, for a while, there was only one man going around serving.  The \"seafood\" option was simply a plate of fried seafood (that came out cold), it wasn't exactly what was advertised, as we were under the impression it would be served out similarly to the meat.  And, though the meat was above mediocre, the lack of servers definitely put a damper on the meal.  Sadly enough, I was most pleased with the salad bar.  To top it all off, our waitress was fairly rude and made comments under her breath about how our order came out wrong (as if it was our fault).  I'd suggest going elsewhere -- with the amount of money you would spend there, you could go to a lunch buffet at Bellagio!  It is possible I feel this way just because I've been to other Brazilian restaurants, so I know what the experience should be like.  Regardless, I'd say save your money for food the you can count on being delicious.",

It was not the amount but the principal to ask before honestly. So that I would say is the only negative.",

Although the bacon wrapped filet mignon is incredible (INCREDIBLE!!!), it's just not good enough to make me continue as a guest.  Our server was nice, but the people bringing around the meat seem so unhappy with their lives.  I almost felt bad when I say no to the meat they have because they just look so sad.  My mashed potatoes were cold and bland.  I feel like there could be more variety in the buffet part.  It seems as though several of the selections up there don't get chosen often, so maybe they should consider adding new items or rotating items.  We used a Groupon, so I guess I can't complain too much that my sister and I got our dinners for only $65.  However, the regular prices are ridiculous.  What we had would have cost over $150 without a Groupon.   Also, BE CAREFUL: If you ask for water, some waiters will automatically bring you bottled spring water and then make you pay for it.  If you want FREE water, make sure you specify.  Looking back on my reviews, I gave it 4, then 3 and now 2.  They need to really think about stepping up the quality of their employees if they want to continue to have hapy guests that will willingly pay without a coupon.",

    "text": "I've hit every Brazilian \"churrascaria\" in town, even every one in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil...and Pampas, BY FAR...ranks bottom of the barrel in food quality...the 3 other ones in Vegas are far superior.  If you come here and pay full price you are silly...as they have 2 for 1 offerings all over town and on the internet if you search long enough...and THAT is reason enough to try it out and think, well, $20-$25 per person is somewhat reasonable as their competition in town seldom offers deals and you end up paying over $120 for two (tax +tip) but for far better quality and excellent salad bar.  Service: The last time I was here, we sat for over 7 minutes to start out our meal before we had a \"gaucho\" come over ready to carve out some meat...and they aren't that personable like in some other places, kind of robotic.  The salad bar doesn't have much...throw a couple hearts of palm on my plate and I'm done...not going to fill up on fettuccini alfredo.  The best cut of meat for me was the leg of lamb and the balsamic vinegar mix they use to sauce it over, but of course that came around once over the course of an hour and we were sitting in the middle of the room.  The filet mignon is bacon wrapped and too salty and extremely tough for what is supposed to be the most tender cut of meat...and I hope you like it medium-well because that's all they had.  If you can find a coupon, I'd say give it a shot, but if you want quality and really good food try Fogo De Chao, Texas De Brazil and Via Brasil here in Vegas.   The quality of meat at Pampas vs. it's local competition is like night and day.",

I did not enjoy my dinner here at all.  One good thing about this place is the olives at the salad bar.  They were very yummy. I'm not the only one who was annoyed.  There was a couple at the other table for 5+ minutes and no one came and took their drink orders.  When they came up to the waitress she had told them \"oh we're not serving at that table\".     Why would you seat people there if you aren't serving at that table? And mind you, the servers passed by this couple multiple times and didn't tell them anything.  Eventually they moved the couple to a different table.   Anyways, to conclude my thoughts, I will not come here again. Horrible first experience.",

I being picky decided to go with something i haven't tried before and thought would be a fun experience, however i was extremely let down. I already know being in vegas food at nicer places especially the ones in massive casino and hotels would be pricey. I would Never pay for a dinner at this place, Luckily we had a voucher but still a waste. Our server you could tell was annoyed we were eating for \"free\" even tho the meal was technically paid for, we ordered water due to it was 114 degrees out side and we had spend the last two days drinking and were going out that night water was what we needed. Neither of us had been to a place like this and wasnt sure what to expect. although i did expect better. Once our server brought our water we didnt see her again for quite some time she never came to our table only one time as she walked by asking how everything was, she was rude and you could tell she didnt want to be there. The food was okey again like i said i would never pay full price for this place, the side bar that was all you can eat was probably the best part however we went there for the Brazilian experience and what we received was by far from that. After we were done eating we sat there for about 30 minutes waiting on our server so we could pay anything we may have owed or at least tip her. When she finally came back with a very rude and horrible attitude made the comment \" well your food and waters were free, have a great night\" How ever our food was not free it had previously been paid for at a discount price, yet still paid for. she walked away and went to the table next to ours only to find out they had actual coupons that discounted their food as well she also gave them an attitude, we had gotten her attention again hoping we were able to tip her on a card since neither of us had cash, once we asked if there was a way to tip her on a card her whole attitude completely changed toward us and she was nice. Too late. We did leave her still 20% of what our bill would have been even tho she did not deserve that. I get everyone has bad days and or other things going on but dont bring it to work and or take it out on customers behavior like that is completely unacceptable. Neither chris or I would ever recommend this place to anyone food was mediocre and service was horrible.",

    "text": "We ate at this restaurant with a party of 9-had reservations & was promptly seated.The celebration dinner was for a co workers retirement. Our friends ordered a few cocktails-My husband & I were poured water from a glass container into glasses in front of us. The menu was sparse - with very few selections for non meat eaters-or in our case,gastric bypass surgery patients-who eat at best a half of a half of a sandwich (which we usually share) We both have a medical card from our surgeon-explaining what are dietary issues are. Most times we are given the option of buying off the child's menu or half price-this is is first time in 15 years our card wasn't honored. So no big deal, we ordered the lobster tail ( it comes with no sides/salad etc) Again that would of been ideal-price was great. The others in our party ordered the full menu.. Their food started arriving immediately & regularly. 25 minutes in-my husband & I and another friend (who also wanted lobster) still hadn't been served. My husband flagged down our server-who assured our lobster was cooked to order and would be served shortly...another 25 minutes passed. Still no lobster-the guest of honor was also waiting for his 2nd cocktail for over 40 mins. Well, eventually the lobster arrived & my husband's was completely \"raw\"... mine was cooked a little more, with raw portions. My friends was like mine too. We ate the cooked parts, but, my husband at this point was irritated & asked for the manager-as none of his was edible and we didn't want to wait another 45min for another. The manager was very apologetic-said we wouldn't be charged for the lobsters... Asked if she could bring us a drink on the house-dessert.. Me and my friend did take her up on the offer of a glass of wine (my husband doesn't drink)  The kicker was the bill came and we were charged for water that was served-but never drank.    Our bills were all on separate tickets. Our bill was $1.08 ..... Normally we are over the top tippers. Either the waitstaff was extremely new or overwhelmed. But, the restaurant looked fairly busy-but not crazy busy. We paid our $1.08 bill for the un-drank bottled water?? Who charges for  water? ... and left a \"dollar \" tip for the server, who ignored our requests for \" where is our meal\" for 90 minutes... It was a dollar more than he deserved...We are normally not \"complainers@... But, seriously? 90 minutes for a raw lobster tail??? Then the nerve to charge us a buck for water? This restaurant gets minus 100 stars... And as a side note-my Yelp reviews are 99% good...i",

Also, we were there for about an hour and they passed our table with meat only 3xs.

While the food was fresh, tasty and such good quality it was our waitress that really made our experience here stand out. Claudia answered all of our menu related questions, she knew the menu to a T and she was so sweet and very attentive despite the busy night at the restaurant.

We were quite disappointed! Even though we knew our choices were limited to chicken, sirloin, and fish we ordered the chicken and sirloin and the open buffet in the back. As a vegetarian I couldn't eat anything from the free meals we got so I had to find something to eat. The waiter was super nice but told ya they only had one vegetarian options which were literally just vegetables. Not even a vegetarian pasta was here which blew my mind! I ended up having to get the buffet in the back because it had salad and a few other small things I can eat.  The salad didn't taste fresh, the pasta was mushy, and those who ordered the chicken and sirloin said that it wasn't cooked well at all and it tasted wayyyyy too salty. We ended up having a few bites of the food and leaving (yes we tipped Ofcourse because our waiter was nice and it definitely wasn't his fault for the restaurant not having a vegetarian friendly menu)",

That includes salad bar, and multiply varieties of food.   I have tried all there different types of meats which includes sirloin, beef tip, ribs, pork, chicken, and etc. Tbh most of them were not that good. Well just a head up that there are no hidden fees or anything if you used the coupon or any vouchers. The service were friendly, I think his name was Troy's but not sure. He did come back often to ask us \"If everything is alright. Need refills on our drink.\" So that was really satisfying.   Overall I think this place is average nothing special but since your in Las Vegas enjoy the time there and there are still so many great restaurant out there to try!",

You have to be a little careful and make sure you request the correct doneness of meat as skewers will range from rare to well done.   At $40 for meat only, it's a little steep (though somehow cheaper than the Palo Alto location) but still not bad for all-you-can-eat.  My favorites (in order): BBQ Chicken, Top Sirloin, Lamb, Filet Mignon, and the Tri-Tip. Oh, and the BBQ Pineapple is delicious. The side bar is good, but don't fill yourself up!  Boom. Yummy.",

For the quality of food, this place is a little pricy even for Vegas (at least the dinners are).   I can understand if the negatives are small things like ambiance or maybe the service.

The guy at the ticket counter said they sell the most vouchers for Pampas than all their shows combined. Good deal. The dinner was all you can eat of 10 meats. I have to say, my favorite was the roasted herb chicken. Some of the meat was a bit dry and tough to chew through, but I was pretty satisfied with the different flavors. There are some other brazilian bbq places where the meats just all start tasting the same. Another favorite was the bacon wrapped turkey. The turkey was really moist, but I think that's because it was processed. They came out in cubes on those long sticks. If I remember correctly, there were two types of filet mignon. I remember liking the one that wasn't with parmesan . The service here was excellent. We brought our own wine. When we called, they said the corkage fee was $15, but it turned out to be $10. Our waiter and also a manager kept checking in on us and taking away our plates. Additionally, there was a separate buffet with lots of salad choices. I liked the pineapple salad, kale, and the fried bananas. Yummers again!",

    "text": "A carnivore's nightmare!  Perhaps my tastebuds have gotten picky as I've gotten older, but this place was a downer.  I wasn't expecting imported steak or aged meats, but for a Brazilian churrascaria, I'd like some flavor (if you meats don't cut it) please.  We came here the day prior to Ash Wednesday.  For all of you non-Catholics, you may be more familiar with other terms this day goes by, like \"Fat Tuesday and Mardi Gras\" or \"Carnival.\"  So, prior to our 40-days of abstinence, we were expecting a real meal.  This place did not deliver.  Even with the 40% discount that <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tix4tonight.com%2F&s=b6ceade486e293e8736e854457018b6a86e141d4b513e27da2cfd75771c75eed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tix4tonight.com</a> provided, $22 for all-you-can-eat (discounted from $36) plus $15 average drinks is not a deal at all.    Nope, I'm not kidding about $15 cocktails.  And, nope, it's not in a bigger glass.  It comes in your regular, everyday lowball.  I've clubbed in Vegas, LA, NYC, London, etc., $15 is a  total rip-off.  I would have been better off sitting on a slot machine on the casino floor with my $15 (and served a free double shot of whiskey and d.coke) and had a better time.  And, to add to the hysteria, if you opt for wine, they give you this big silly, plastic wine bottle to order off of.  As we all know, every True churrascaria will pass on the chicken and all the other filler crap that they try to feed you in the beginning.  So, I could not honestly critique those items.  However, all the (should have been) good stuff (i.e. beef and lamb) was medium to done because of all the re-cooking.  This was not at all pleasing to me, as I prefer medium-rare for these meats.  The petite fillet was fair, in flavoring and in seasoning.  However, the lamb was not fresh and you could taste it.  The pork was on the dry side.  And, I could have used a little more blood on my ribeye.  With that, I couldn't begin to imagine paying full price.  But if you must experience it, check out <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftix4tonight.com&s=97f456af1795004cabb3151ffb752f6be421dc9b21b643a189724e1f8a3893f0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tix4tonight.com</a> before you go.  The closest one to the restaurant is at the Hawaiian Marketplace, in front of Polo Towers.",

    "text": "We ate here on a Monday night.  We had reservations for five at 9:45 p.m.  We made our reservations through Tix 4 Tonight / Tix 4 Dinner.  This allowed us to pay 1/2 price.    Upon arrival the hostess showed us to our table.  The initial service was a little slow but we expected that from the other reviews.  Our waiter appeared and we gave him our 1/2 price voucher.  He told us how things work, took our drink order and told us we could help ourselves to the salad bar.  I have been to Brazilian Steakhouses in Houston, San Diego, Dallas, Florida and Buenos Aires.  This one follows the typical format.  Large salad bar and then the endless parade of meats.    Standouts at the salad bar included the salmon which was spicy.  I also liked the plaintains.    The meat was very good.  Plenty of it.  Servers that knew rare from well done.  Lamb, steak, chicken.  A particular standout was the spicy chicken.  The serving size was very large, moist and perfectly seasoned.  Diners at the table also enjoyed the turkey wrapped in bacon.  It was different and a nice change of pace from the meat.    The staff was attentive and even brought us additional lamb when requested.  A small complaint was that the filet mignon had a slightly gamey flavor that it shouldn't have had but the picanha was on target.  Also, this style of steakhouse typically uses a lot of salt on their meats and if you are not used to the flavor then it can sometimes get overwhelming.    Remember.  You do not have to have a slice of every meat or item that is brought to your table.  You can and should be selective.    The wine list had reasonable values for a restaurant in a hotel casino.  For example, a Kaiken Malbec by the bottle was $35.00. House wine was $30.  Four stars because of the 1/2 price voucher.  (Total meal cost with two bottles of wine was $48 per person with tip).  Only three if we had to pay full price.",

The place was busy but they offered us a coupon for one of our meals and we were seated in a timely manner. There was some confusion with a couple of the waiters about our order, for some reason they brought over some seafood we didn't ask for? But, that issue was resolved quickly and we left full and happy.  If you are serious about Barbecue and Brazilian food...try this place!   We were shocked when a group of guys who were seated by us did not enjoy the food and were basically letting the waiters continue to bring them food but not eat it...what a waste!",

    "text": "Probably the worst Brazilian BBQ experience I have had. We got a discounted rate through Tix4Tonight for $20 per person so it was reasonably priced but we got what we paid for in this case. I would be mad if I paid full price.   At Pampas, the service was indifferent. We had water refilled once during a 90-minute meal. The reason it was so long was the meat came out so slowly. All of the meat was overcooked. I think I saw one piece of beef that had any pink to it. All the rest of the beef was grey and chewy. The pork was fatty (which I usually appreciate) but in this case even the lumps of fat was not enough to offset the scaly texture of the over cooked pork loin. The only good meat was the bacon wrapped turkey. If all of the meat was as well prepared as the turkey this would have been a much different experience despite the service. The only other skewered item I would recommend is the grilled pineapple. The salad bar was not big nor was the food there mediocre. Finding it was not terribly easy either and certainly not worth the effort.   If you are in Vegas and in the mood for Brazilian BBQ I would recommend Texas de Brazil or Sambas if you want the convenience of a location in a casino.",

She is the bartender that has all of her ingredients on a cart and visits tables to craft drinks! She makes great caipirinia's and even asked us to sample the drink to see if we liked it or if anything else needed to be added. Great personality and a huge asset to the restaurant! I ordered the meat rodizio, it was very good. My parents got the top sirloin entree and they were pleased as well. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "First off, I want to say this place is pretty pricey.  I've heard that the Rodizzio (sp?) is the most recommended.  It's about $46 for all you can eat meats + a fesh bar/buffet with lots of greens, veggies and a few sides such as potatoes and rice.  I decided to order the chicken dinner entree. I paid $38 for this plate. It came with a LOT of chicken which was SO DRY. I couldn't eat it all.  It also came with squash and zucchini which I ate and was tasty and a side of mashed potatoes which was also fine.    My boyfriend got the Rodezzio(sp) which was all you can eat meat.  The servers came around a lot with the meats but I think it was because they were trying to get rid of it all before closing.  We also got our picture taken by a lady who snaps your photo.  You get your picture on a free post card and she also comes out with your photos in a paper frame in case you want to purchase them for $15.   Anyway, for 2 people, 2 soft drinks, a dry chicken plate and all you can eat meat, + tip came out to give or take $90. The meats were very very flavorful and so juicy! I loved it!  If you want to spend the money, fine. Just make sure you're very hungry and stick with the meats (don't get the chicken)  Oh, by the way, I've never had Brazilian BBQ before.",

I've visited Pampas this week and couldn't find one good reason to come back, for less then what they charge you can go to many other Buffet's in the area, enjoy excellent meat, get free non-alcoholic beverages and get desserts. (Check some of my other reviews)  I've spent at \"Pampas\" about an hour and a half, and pretty much tried all their meat's, from over cooked top sirloin to very salty pork, even the roasted pineapple they manage to spoil somehow.  On top of that, their salad buffet is sad, I've got no other way to describe it but sad.  The vegetables looked as if they have been sitting there the whole day, and the side dishes were tasteless. I wouldn't go back there even if they would charge half price!  As I said at the beginning, if you like meat, skip that one..  There are plenty good buffets in the area, that offer much more for much less $.",

The salad bar was actually quite good and fresh. However, the meat is way below average. The variety is little and some of the chicken and pork weren't even cooked. I was worried that they use the same knife which cut the half cooked pork.  The value isn't bad. But food wasn't great. Overall, I probably won't come here again while it was still a decent experience.  For lunch there were only these served sausage, chicken, prime rib?, pork, pineapple and ham, bacon.",

    "text": "The place looks great, food is good, but not worth the money if you paid the normal rate. What kills this place is there service. I have seen people get up & leave. Not just once, twice, but many times at least 5 or 6 times in the past year when I visited the place. I visited this place at least 20 times in the last past year. Only worth it if you have a discount coupon & remember to ask for water & a drink or two waters, they usually do not come around for 20 to 30 mins at a time. The meat servers are usually around, but not as offen as you would want them to be. But hey, you get what you pay for! They have to remember that there is Fogo de Chao is openning down the street off Flamingo/Paradise and of the number 1 Texas de Brazil in Town Center is just down the street!  People that live out here go there. But for out of town vistors, unfortunately if you get to eat out once, hopefuly you won't get dissapointed and stuck here cause they won't see you again. Dinner hours are very busy and service is even worst! If you do get stuck eating here, then it's best to eat around lunch, cheaper, less meat selection but decent service if you get either of the two waitress Nicole or Nicky, these are the only to waitress that know how to service customers. If you get someone else beside these girls, well good luck, order three drinks or a pitcher of water. Like I said before, food is good, service needs big time work.",

They had only 2 ppl going around serving meat. The first time they came around, they had rare steak. The second time they came around they had medium well. The third time, they served well done. The other person served a different kind of meat (sausage, pork lion, chicken wrapped in bacon etc)  We literally had to wait 20 mins for our next round of meat because they had to cover soo many tables! Imagine waiting 20mins for 1 nibble of meat when youre hungry! The food was horribleee! They shouldve paid me for trying it! So upsetting!",

My wife wanted some of the red meats cooked well done and they actually brought her a plate of a couple of well done selections!!  And of course a wonderful selection of \"sides.\"  If you are staring at the Marriott make sure and bring your privileges card as the price of the bill including drinks is drastically reduced... enjoy the bottomless bloody Mary's/Mamosa's for for next to no cost for an hour...",

We joined them and were served immediately as we waited for more of our group. They have a full bar and the drinks were delicious.  The salad and sides bar was situated in the rear of the restaurant which was a little difficult to maneuver but once you were there, was abundant. Soups,  salads, vegetables and the pop overs were never ending.  As hard as it was to get there, we all went more than once! We almost got full on the salad bar but then the meats came. The meats they brought were moist and cooked perfectly.  We might have been full but we finished the meat too.  We really had no room left for dessert but maybe next time.  We will definitely be back.",

If you've ever been to other brazilian steakhouses, you know how expensive it can be given the general \"unlimited meats\" format.  I'm not going to say that the meats and salad bar are the best i've ever had (they are not), but if you scour around this place has so many great discounts, coupons, and promotions, that you can very easily get in and out for a reasonable per person cost including a bottle of wine.",

They give you a card with a red side and a green side. As long as the green side is facing up, the meat keeps coming. You have to flip it to the red side for them to stop.  Some of the cuts were a little more rare than I would eat, but all the meats come to the table cooked at different temperatures. My favorite was the grilled chicken wrapped in bacon. It was juicy and flavorful. They also had grilled pineapples, which was my 2nd favorite item. This restaurant also has a side bar where you can get fruit, salads, pastas, etc. I would definitely return to a restaurant of this caliber. 5 star rating all the way.",

It is a Brazilian steak house where a variety of meats are brought around on skewers and it is carved table side. The experience started off being charged a buck for tap water PER PERSON in your party without any other option. The salad/side bar was disgusting looking and never stocked with fresh food. Then the meat brought to the table was either well done shoe leather or raw. Also disgusting. After having a word with the manager, desert was brought out on the house and it was delicious. Service was also very sub par and when the check was presented we were told, \"cash is king for gratuity.\" Like who says that?? Overall a D+ in my books and will never be back. Good luck!",

It was fairly busy and it was a bit of a slow start. Our first round of drinks took about 20 minutes and the first round of meat servers took a little while to get to us.  Once things got rolling, we couldn't keep up with the amount of meat that was brought to us. Everything, including the salad bar, was well prepared and delicious. Our waiter, Juan, kept up with our drink requests.  While I wouldn't pay full price - about $160 for two including one hour of drinks - I would definitely go back with another Groupon deal which cost us $80 for two.",

The only reason I'm giving two stars is because the first time we came it was awesome all the way around. But this last time was terrible.  I purchased a lunch Groupon for 65$ for two with the unlimited surf and turf + mimosas.   When walked in, there was a 5-10 min wait. No biggie. We were then seated in a crowded room with 2 servers.   The busser that walked by us filled up all four glasses of water on the table when there was only 2 of us and didn't clear away the other place settings. Annoying but I brushed it off.  I asked for our drinks from the server, busser, and finally a manager. 20 mins later we got our mimosas.   The meats that came around were very rare in the middle, unlike last time when they were more well done. That knocked more points off for us, but for others that may be a plus.   I repeatedly asked for the \"surf\" portion of our meal and we finally got it in the end after at least an hour.  The dessert was fantastic... probably the best of everything at least.   I'm upset because for the money we paid,  we should be getting great service.   The restaurant was way way understaffed resulting in us never coming back.",

    "text": "Another bad experience with this place. This time, I've reached my limit. I have given them more than enough time to correct the mistakes. I was even contacted by Bill, the company's owner or the office of the owner. He apologized for my experiences, but still nothing was different.  For starters, the meats came around so slowly still. This time it was much slower. I thought I was crazy until the 2 tables next to me start complaining also. I don't know what their problem is but it's unacceptable. I ended up eating the same 4 meats over and over. We all waited 10 minutes between servings too.  I then noticed, when a table next to me started to order dessert, that not only my favorite but the only dessert I will eat from this place (the Chocolate Mousse Brownie), wasn't on the display. I asked my server about it and he said that they had taken it off of the menu. I posted a tip about it and a rude supporter of this place (the company's fake Yelp account probably) told me to get my facts straight. (I later called and inquired about the change. I was told that it was still on the menu. I'm not sure what he got out of lying but whatever.)  I walked to the hostess and asked to speak with the manager. The manager came over after about 5 minutes. I told her that it was like my 6th time eating there and the experiences and food are both getting worse. She weirdly listened for a couple minutes and then asked if I wanted a free dessert or drink. I declined both. I wanted her to understand that I wasn't complaining to start trouble or get free stuff. I was complaining because I was truly concerned. She finally offered me a BOGO for my next visit. Little does she know, I will never use it, because I will never go back.  I have officially added this place to my \"Never Again\" list.",

This lunch included unlimited meat (sirloin, pork, sausages, chicken, tri-tip, etc), seafood (shrimp, fish, mussels), salad bar, and drinks (mimosas, beer, sangria). The catch is you only have 1 hour to eat and drink. They also charge a $1 per person conservation fee for water; not a big deal for our group but it may be surprising if you don't know ahead of time.   The service was really slow. Our group literally got our first round of drinks 15 minutes into our lunch. Some of the dishes were not appetizing (I.e. The shrimp and fish). They were both forgettable and it made me not want to try the other seafood options. But, some of the meat choices were well-seasoned and tender. I liked the chicken the best. Dessert was good as well; my favorite was the white chocolate cheesecake. Minus one star for service and minus one star for the seafood.",

The food itself was great. Hubby was not too impressed with the sides because they were unfamiliar to him, but I enjoyed what I tried, especially the little cheesy muffins. And once the meats started coming to the table they didn't let up. Every style of cut they describe on their website came by except for the lime marinated pork and one of the sausages.  I like my meat cooked on the rare side while my husband wants everything well-done. No problems with that for either of us. The Brazilian cut of sirloin, bacon wrapped fillet and the chicken were our favorites. I'd probably pass on the ham next time.  All-in-all a very pleasant and delicious experience, we'd definitely recommend and would return.",

Didn't apologize and didn't even come back to reseat us. It was quite embarrassing. We had to handle things ourselves. Then service was ok.  As we waited for the meat to come around there was only one particular guy that was actually really helpful and made sure the meat we requested got to us, the others not so much and missing the entire time.  When we got one certain meat that we were looking forward to which was lamb, it was pretty good on the first round then when we asked for it again, it was way way under cooked (too dangerous for me to ingest considering I'm pregnant)..  The other meat that my fiance had requested ended up being too rubbery to eat and from there, we decided we were done and wanted out.   I understand it was busy and packed but this restaurant should have been more prepared for a day like that. Won't be coming here again, I rather go to Texas de Brazil and rather spend my money there. At least it would have been worth it.  But all in all, I'm just glad I got to spend a night alone with my fiance. It's a lesson learned for us.",

    "text": "Came here with low expectations but came out pleasantly surprised. Pretty decent Brazilian all-you-can-eat buffet with unlimited meats brought to your table ($36.99 pp for dinner) but don't expect as wide of a buffet selection as one of the more established Brazilian BBQ places like Fogo de Chao or Texas de Brazil in other cities.   Overall the meats brought to the table were pretty good: - Pork loin - excellent, perfectly cooked, delicious seasoning - Lamb - very tasty. I HATE LAMB, but loved this one because it tasted great and wasn't gamey. That says a lot. - Chicken - regular and spicy - very moist and tasty - Beef ribs - good but a bit fatty. Ribless. - Sirloin steak - good but wished it had a bit more flavor. - Flank steak - only one I didn't like. Overcooked and lacked any flavor - Filet mignon chunk wrapped in bacon - good flavor w/the bacon but the filet was overcooked - Turkey sausage - was alright - Ham and pineapple - didn't try  Examples of the non-meat buffet offerings: - smoked salmon - some beef stew thing - roasted potatoes - some veggie - salads (caesar and regular) - bread rolls - rice - variety of other sides  The place is very nice and elegant inside with very friendly wait staff who came by to asked us how we were doing different times. It wasn't that crowded so service was overall attentive altho spotty at certain times. Simple but effective system: you have a card that is green on one side and red on the other. When you want meat to come to your table, flip to green. When you are full or want a break, turn it to red.  Apparently you can get a discounted rate for this place by getting ~50% off price tickets (check out Tix4Tonight for $19.99 for the usual $36.99 dinner meat buffet) or free by attending one of those timeshare presentations. Also there are signs in the Planet Hollywood casino that say mention the sign and you'll get $5 off or something like that.  Bottom line: If you love meat, this place should make you pretty happy.  Best deal is finding some of those discounts mentioned. Don't expect this to be as good as one of the other fancy Brazilian churrascaria chains you may have tried in other cities and you'll be fine.",

    "text": "First timer here and to be honest with you it's just for the sake of a Groupon despite all those 2-3 star reviews.  First of all, the manager Terry (or Terri) was super nice, she even told me how groupon worked from merchants' side and let use use it a day before its \"official\" valid date (so keep in mind, you'll need to wait for a day after your groupon purchase to use it per rule).  Anyway, we opted for 19.99 Brazilian bbq lunch for two.  The menu said lunch had 7 meat selection, and dinner would have 10.  Let me count the 7 for you in order of our favorite from most to least: Pork loin; spicy chicken leg, non-spicy chicken leg; beef steak (way too raw); sausage; ham; turkey breast bacon roll.  We saw grilled pineapple too.    Now you can tell how limited the meat selections really are at least for lunch.  I've been to other Brazilian grilles before and always been amazed by how many different stuff we can try, but for this restaurant it's certainly not the case.  The pork loin was tender enough but lack of seasoning in my personal view, the majority of beef chunk should be rated as rare-medium rare at most, I got a bloody plate after having two slices. However you can certainly ask the food servers for more cooked region (very small region though), they are friendly too.  As for the chicken (they did count non-spicy and spicy as TWO selections of meat), well you normally can't go wrong with bbq chicken, and it's just too common/ordinary to judge.  In general, friendly people, nice environment, but mediocre Brazilian grill food, can't say anything about their other menu entrees though.",

    "text": "I ought to give Pampas one star, but the meats occasionally were decent quality. To be perfectly honest and frank, I have been to several Brazillian grilles in the past and this falls to the bottom of the list. The meats were inconsistent in terms of quality, often under or overcooked. My girlfriend and I went for lunch on our last day in vegas, and lunch had 7 meats. We were very dissapointed in those options. We also got to try their filet mignon wrapped on bacon, and it was the cheapest quality filet I ever have had. Hailing from a place near the water, my girlfriend and I are used to quality seafood. The surf and turf option is something to avoid at all costs. Even if you were able to get it half off, still avoid it. My girlfriend and I are feeling horrible right now and we are pretty sure it is from the seafood. The bottom of one of the pieces of fish looked like a piece of moldy trash. The shrimp obviously was older and had been previously frozen. The mussels, I believe, were the cause of our current discomfort, and should be avoided as they may cause food posioning, the jury is still out on that though. Lastly, the buffet bar is small compared the other Brazillian Grilles I have been to, and does not have very many options.   The atmosphere was odd, as the music choices varied from sad and monotomic to hard rock, with little to enhance the authenticity of the establishment and its brazillian heritage. Service was ok, but nothing spectacular. The servers of the various meats often gave poor pieces, rarely giving center cuts. They also came around sparingly at times, as only 2 were working from 3:30 to 4:45 that we could tell. Our waiter, Rigo, was nice so this review is on indicative of his job. Rather, it is indicative of the chefs and management of the establishment.   All in all, unless you can get a discount and eat here for less than 20$ a person, don't  even bother checking this place out. And remember, AVOID THE SEAFOOD.",

I would definitely come back to try their breakfast with steak and eggs!!   Although this is not Agora, it was pretty good all you can eat Churrascaria!  Their sides were a bit disappointing, as I was hoping for more.  We got the surf and turf buffet - The grilled shrimp was just okay.  Knowing what I know now, I would probably just order the meats without paying the extra for the shrimps because it wasn't worth it.  Their meats were nicely favored, but it wasn't amazing.  I have to admit that I really did enjoy their roasted pineapple - it was a nice in between meats!  Service was excellent - our server was a super nice older gentlemen!   Overall, I'm looking forward to returning for their breakfast special!",

My mother immediately said \"yeah, this isn't for me\". I had asked what she meant by that and she meant that it was over priced and it was entirely to tight in that restaurant for that concept. I also told her to not judge by this restaurant alone and maybe Texas De Brazil she might like. To sum it up it tasted like this food was microwaved. The service wasn't as personal as you would expect for the amount of money you pay. My mother asked the next table over as they were leaving did they think it was worth it and they sighed and shrugged \"it was alright\"",

    "text": "To be absolutely clear my earliest review of this restaurant was based solely on service. I hadn't even had the opportunity to try the food.   My first experience here was dreadful and I evaluated it as such but management immediately reached out. They apologized and invited me back for second try -- complimentary of course. It took me about six months to get back to Vegas and simultaneously have enough free time to come into Pampas.   They did a really great job this time! I want to note that I did not feel as though all attention was on me but rather the normal level of service was offered. The meats were very good though not nearly as wide a selection of them as in many other churrascarias I've been to. The buffet was adequate, not stellar. But then I never understood folks who went to town on buffet selections when they've dropped the bulk of their money on the giant skewers of meaty goodness.  The gauchos were professional, polite and they knew about the protein they were weilding. Drinks were solid. Servers and hostesses very nice. It was a good experience all around.   I also appreciated that toward the end of meal the manager on duty came by to see how things had gone and to hear in more detail what had gone wrong the first around. We had a good productive chat without getting anyone in trouble. I've said this before, sometimes recovering from a challenging circumstance is more telling of the substance of a team than seeing that team cruise through an all-systems-are-check kind of day.  Nice job, Team Pampas!",

    "text": "I am glad my first and last visit here was with a Groupon, because I would have been even more disappointed without the dinner date deal.  To start with we made a reservation for two to be seated at a booth.  The hostess was pleasant.  We arrived to a full house with only a half table half booth for two on the outer perimeter of the dinning room next to a wedding party.  We saw two other parties seated next to us assigned a waiter before us so we waived the next person down to be serviced.  The waiter we were assigned was not attentive or detail oriented and apologized for forgetting about us multiple times.  In addition, we had to waive down the meat skewer servers to get food.  By the time they serviced us our side dishes were cold.  The servers that passed us were mostly for the wedding party... I recommend requesting middle dinning area seating because the servers were more attentive there and they received the meat service first.  The meat tri tip was decent, the sirloin was overcooked, the seafood plate (salmon, muscles, shell on shrimp, and halibut was cold by the time it arrived at our table.  The sides are self serve buffet style at the rear of the dinning area.   This didn't feel like a fine dinning experience or even a great introduction to a Brazilian steakhouse. The service was mediocre, the food quality did not reflect the price, and the ambiance was not romantic.  I constantly had my head on the swivel and had to work to flag people down to get fed.  This type if dining was not for me. I prefer a seamless dining experience.  We only saw our waiter 3 times total.  In the beginning and then after we spoke with the manager and again shortly thereafter to deliver and pickup the check.   The majority of the meat delivered to our table was discarded due to being overcooked or cold upon arrival.  My date was sick after the meal and we had to end our date night early.  I will not be dining here again an would not recommend this place to anyone.  The best part was the banter with my date making light of a sh!tty first time Brazilian steakhouse dining experience and oh yeah the cocktails were good.",

    "text": "I've been dying to try a Brazilian steakhouse for awhile so when I noticed that there was a Groupon for Pampas that was valid when we were going to be in Vegas, I jumped on it. I purchased the lunch deal which included two all-you-can-eat meals of meat, seafood and salad bar, plus one alcoholic drink per person and one dessert to share. It ended up being a great deal!  We checked out the salad bar first and I was slightly disappointed by it. I was expecting more of a green salad bar and less of the pre-made pasta salads. The Caesar salad was soggy, which seemed odd considering that the restaurant had just opened less than 30 minutes before. The standouts of the salad bar for me were the garlic mashed potatoes and chicken noodle soup, which I found helped to give me a stomach a relaxing break from all the delicious meats.   And speaking of the meats, those steaks were amazing! Both the tri-tip and the top sirloin were melt-in-your-mouth delicious! As others have mentioned, they're rather salty but I, for one, have a salty tooth so I was in heaven! I loved having the meat carved right at our table and being able to have as much as I could fit in my tiny stomach.   Unfortunately, the other meat was mainly pig-based and I don't eat pig so I skipped the ham, pork loin  and even the bacon-wrapped chicken. I tried a chicken leg but didn't care for it. Besides, the steaks were too good to bother with anything else.   Thanks to Yelp, I read how amazing Pampas' grilled pineapple was and I knew to request some. I think that they usually bring it by your table but after 30 minutes, we had yet to see any. We asked our waitress and she notified the kitchen to bring it out. It was so sweet and delicious and balanced the rest of our meal perfectly.   Our meal ended with a choice of one of four desserts. I'm probably an odd one out here but none of the four choices (cheesecake, chocolate cake, flan and tiramisu) appealed to me. I'm more of a pie or ice cream kind of girl. I would have chosen the chocolate cake, even though I'm not a huge chocolate fan, but my boyfriend wanted to try the flan so I let him have it. I was too stuffed from my meaty meal to have much room for dessert anyway.   All in all, I'd definitely come back with another Groupon next time I'm in Vegas.",

This place had the worst meat quality and flavor of any Brazilian place I've been - and I thought I had eaten some bad Brazilian until I came in here.  The sirloin tri-tip was so tough and completely devoid of any flavor.  The house sirloin looked promising but failed in every way - very tough, very chewy and very bland.  I quickly gave up after a few samples of meats and cut my losses and paid the check.  If you've eaten at any halfway decent Brazilian chain like Fogo de Chao or Texas de Brazil then you will be very disappointed with this place!",

The food was yummy as there are many servers holding the meat stick going around so you can pick whatever you want. I love the grill bacon and grill lamb. No free refill for strawberry lemonade. Everything went well so far until there was a lady coming up to us and asking to take pictures which is complimentary. Later after the meal we come to check if we like those pictures or not then we can decide to pick it up. However, the staffs working for photo station just completely ruined my day as she gave us a cold glance when we decided not to take it. $50 for 3 pictures, wow. She started to make a bargain with us but we still said no. Overall I give this restaurant 4 stars as their food was very good, nice waiters but the manager should take a look at those people who working for pictures inside the restaurant. We will come back for the food!",

Paid $200 for both husband and myself. $55 for a salad bar plate plus unlimited meats (waiters come to your table with spears of meat and offer you a variety such as chicken, beef, pork, etc) plus an additional $45 per person to have unlimited drinks that would include liquor/cocktails. The salad bar was good, a big selection, anything you can think of. As for the meat, unimpressed. Not seasoned st all. Just grilled, roasted or whatnot. I tried a bite of almost all the meat they offered, and most of it was chewy and over cooked. Reason, as soon as they carve the outer layer, they take it back to the grill and sear it again. Maybe I'm being picky but what was with the blandness of everything?!? Does nobody use salt & herbs to season food??? All in all, go when very hungry but definitely NOT worth the price. Oh and did I mention tables are very close one another, 12\", so don't think it can be a romantic quiet evening. It's very very very loud!!! And inside a mall, of all places",

Once seated had to wait for someone to come help us. The meat was very fatty and relied heavily on salt for flavor. We decided to try this place because of the great deal that was offered by the front door staff. We received a coupon for buy 1 get 1 meal free. On the main menu itself the price was $21 dollars but then we were told no the coupon average out to be $21 per person. So why would the main menu have the discounted price listed and nowhere was the price of $42? It was just a bait and switch with less the mediocre food. The location is awful as it is tucked away in a corner of the Miracle Mile, probably on purpose by the Miracle Mile administration.  Monkey suggest swinging on to another of Las Vegas many great Brazilian restaurants.",

We went from waiting outside of the restaurant, to sitting inside and asking when they expected us to get seated. We mustv got asked a dozen times \"what's your name again?\" By the 3 hostesses. I finally asked if they were joking by re asking me. She quickly said she's sorry, and she'd checked in someone else's name. Anyways, finally we got to a table and we're told our waiter would be with us in a few. 20min later, we got up and helped ourselves to the salad bar. We were starving. Had to ask for a waiter to be sent over to us whome, once he arrived finally, was extremely nice so I feel bad leaving a 2 star but it's based on being ignored 90% of our visit.

    "text": "We had a free dinner voucher here, but it didn't include the rodizio....damn. That's pretty much the only reason I'd want to hit up a Brazilian steakhouse. It did include sirloin with mashed potatoes and the salad bar, so we plowed onward, but it was the most underwhelming experience our entire time in Vegas. We left glad that we didn't pay $43 + tax & tip for bad food and slow service.  Our food took an hour to come out. Half hour into the order, we were notified that the computer went down, and our order hadn't been sent back to the kitchen. Ten minutes later, the kitchen was \"working on plating it\", and yet it took another 20 minutes. What the hell were they doing back there? The meat is presumably already cooked since the servers are walking around the restaurant with it, and the plating was nothing special - just sliced meat on a plate - so why did it take 30 more minutes on top of the computer failure? Barely made our show.  The salad bar was odd. There were Caesar salar makings, but no Caesar dressing. There was sweet and sour chicken (at a Brazilian place?) and some pastas, but few enticing veggies. I piled on the potatoes and carbed it up. We grabbed some cheese bread (pao de quiejo), usually heavenly, but it was very over cooked, downright crunchy, and hard. The sirloin was good, but not wait-an-hour good...  Two gentlemen next to us at the bar had the rodizio, but it was served onto tiny plates, and they kept having to flag down servers as they went by.   Crowded interior, greasy floor, expensive for what it is, terrible service . For the best Brazilian steakhouse experience, head to Fogo.",

I was so disappointed and if I could take back my visit I would and took the Visa Card.  I was in Vegas for a Timeshare Deal and was given a choice of $100 Visa or Pampas Voucher ($100) and 2 Tickets for a Show.  Thankfully, at the least the show was decent, as after the Voucher I still owed $22 for Water (Yes) they charge you for H20 in a flashy container which tasted like tap water at best and gratuity.  Trust me, nothing we ate was worth $22, let alone $122.  The salad bar was average at best, with cheese cubes you buy at a grocery store-  I have had much better selections at Golden Corral or Ryans with better cuts of meat available, cooked at other doneness other than Well-Done Only which meant Dry, Tasteless, Tough, make you wonder if it was Steak at all???  which you get to wash down with luke-warm tap water from a stylish glass flask.      I really think that without the 1/2 Off Vouchers, Discount Cards or whatever else is used to entice customers to this establishment that it would be empty- I did not see one table that was not producing some type of paper stating a discount- It is packed, but after my first trip to the salad bar and a couple rounds of the meat waiters it is definitely not the food bringing them in-  My best advice is take the VISA Card !!!",

I was really impressed with the salad/side bar at the back. I loved the mix of hot and cold veggies- my favourite was the caprese salad and the warm kale mixed salad.

I was roped in with an offer for an $25 all you can eat special. I ended up spending $40 including tip for a meal lacking any wow factor or standout flavors. As soon I ordered I was told I would have to buy a drink with my purchase and immediately the meal's value to me was exhausted. At least it was a True all you can eat experience with freshly cooked meats being brought out to each table. The grilled pineapple was a great idea and paired well the the meats. Overall,  I was expecting a lot more flavor or a lot more value. The discounts and menu prices leave this restaurant's identity in a peculiar space between offering a fine dining experience or being. a value based location.  I left disappointed in both aspects.

    "text": "We visited Pampas on Thursday during lunchtime.  The three stars shows that we were dissatisfied with several things that just shouldn't happen in restaurants.   First off, is the strange way seafood is brought to tables when one gets the groupon for 'surf and turf lunch with unlimited alcoholic drinks and a dessert option'. The server brought us a plate of mussels, shrimp, cocktail sauce, and fried or baked fish. I was not interested in neither the fried/baked fish nor the mussels. So, unfortunately, they were left on the plate and thrown out as wasted food. :(   Why dont the waiters just ask what customers would prefer? Rather than assuming and bringing the seafood that will be in the trash within 30 minutes. Why not bring me a small plate of shrimp, after asking what I wanted, and keep replenishing them as needed?   Secondly, the wait staff appeared very busy during lunch and strangely enough a random waitress came over to tell us we were in the the wrong table (after being sat there by the hostess), which was very confusing. We ended up staying at the table, but felt that that is not something to tell the customer - you talk to the staff who potentially made the error or look to correct the situation. After that comment she came back once again to say the same thing until our waiter and her had a conversation around us actually being in the correct table.    Third, the selection of food at the buffet area was pretty good and the meats were all tasty. But we didn't feel our waiter came by enough times to ask how we were doing or if we wanted refills on our alcoholic drinks.  Overall, if we ever go back to Vegas, we probably won't go back to Pampas.",

It was hard to get one extra plastic cup (I mean come on, we waved right at your face for 20 seconds!) to pour our can of beer (???... Oh and a lime gently placed atop the opened can, classy) into.   Oh, and there was a ton of pressure to upcharge on our meal, which we later found out from a different customer at a show was a huge ripoff (and this is a mostly self serve from salad bar kind of place), and at the end the tip amount is based on the huge amount one Would have to spend without our package deal from the hotel. Just a bizzare experience, ended off with unable being to use the toilets as someone had vomited into one of the main sinks and was being plumbed out by a staff.

I figured there were no seats inside; there were many tables inside when we headed toward the starter/salad bar...after we had ordered brazilian to add on top of the voucher. This becomes important throughout the evening because the servers with the diverse meat would take awhile to get to us outside.  I've worked in restaurant business early in my high school and college years; there are places that do this and there are places that don't.

    "text": "First time we came we were super impressed and were looking forward to our second visit.  We were given a seat in the bar area and it a while for our to take out order.  The first gaucho came by about 20 minutes into the meal, and the sausage they gave us was awesome, it went down hill from there. Every meat that came out was burnt or had a weird taste.  We had some grill pineapple that was delicious and so was the water... but when are paying 50+ a person and the best thing on the menu was sausage,pineapple and water.. that is pretty sad.  The gauchos were super friendly and should not be blamed for the poor quality of food.  Our waitress was probably overworked.. but took us over an 1/2 hour to pay and get out.   We asked at one point if someone else can check us out and they hostess said a manager could help us.. but no manager ever showed up.  Sadly this will be our last time here",

I should give it two stars but I'm trying to balance the three stars they have. Tough, gristly, and poorly cooked meat, unmatching and beat up dinnerware and not cheap. They brought the same couple items around for most of our dinner. I thought the point of going to a Brazilian buffet was that they brought different kinds of meats to you. It is in the middle of the strip. It was cheaper and better to go to the Aria buffet with an alcohol drink package or to eat at Buddy V's. I would rather have just gone to Chipotle.  Do what you want to do.  I won't judge.  Just don't tell my wife I wrote this; she picked out the restaurant.",

    "text": "So I would probably say this is the absolute worst restaurant in Las Vegas. The service is horrible. The food is horrible as well. I will start by saying that all of you should spend the extra 10-15 a plate and go to Texas de Brazil. That place is amazing.   Today we went into pampas simply because we had a 100 dollar voucher towards lunch. We got the voucher at a discount show ticket place on the strip. And now I completely understand why they give vouchers here. Because they suck and they can't get business otherwise.   The meats were cold. And tasted horribly. If you have ever been to a Brazilian steakhouse you'll know how they come around to the tables and ask what you want. Flip the card green to get more. The gauchos here acted like they were miserable. Oh and he asked my boyfriend if he wanted top serloin and literally cut it over me in my face. Refused to walk around to his side of the table. And anytime we would say we wanted more he acted like he was appalled.  They didn't serve you the rolls as appetizers. They put them in one of those metal catering heat warmers and had you get them across the restaurant. all of which were rock hard. The only thing good at the salad bar were the mushrooms.   The meat was so rare it was bleeding or it was super well done. no one ever asked us how we wanted the piece to be cooked (typically one part of what they cut off is less rare and some is more so usually the people who serve ask what you want.  Nope. You just got what you got.   The server was only attentive to our drinks. I had to ask her twice to take out plates as we had no room for anything. And to top it off their systems were down so they couldn't get our check right or run credit cards. Took 40 min for them to get it straightened out. And that was after we asked for  the check which we had to sit for 15 min before we got her attention. And then they still tried to charge the card the full amount so luckily we scrambled up enough cash and just left that. Not a single offer or apology from management about this. The least they could have done is tried to rectify the situation the best they could. But they didn't.   I will never go back.",

The vast variety of food was amazing for a restaurant with such a small real estate claim. Flavors and quality of food were definitely worth the full price of payment. This restaurant is easily a $100 meal with drinks. However, while it may seem a luxury for most, this restaurant is highly recommended and revered from a couple residing in Texas. My wife and I left incredibly happy and our appetites quenched from the wide variety and plethora of food. Very recommended and definitely will be referred.",

We had to keep asking the server to ask the gentleman with the meats to come to our table took forever and they only brought 3 meats.

We were very very happy to have a waiter named Jimmy who was very friendly, and very attentive. Last time I came here,   We had a terrible waiter . I was fearing for the worst. But, this time we got lucky. I had the most delicious grilled sirloin that was cooked to perfection. The pork tenderloin was also very moist and delicious. The grilled pineapple was also very sweet & yummy.         The problem I had was going to the ladies room. They only have three stalls and two was taken. I went to the last one which is the handicapped one. There was no toilet paper and there were no towel paper in the stall! I came out the restroom and reported to one of the gentleman that was working there and he said he would report it to the manager. I followed him to the back thinking that the manager would come out with some toilet paper. I stood there waiting for a good six minutes and decided to give up. I saw two ladies coming out of the ladies room and decided to go use a different stall. This is so unacceptable for them to run out of toilet paper and towel paper in the handicapped stall!!       At the end of this lunch we were very happy with the food and the service. Until we got our bill, 3X Vero-water per person!! We were charged $3.00 for water!! What?? Jimmy explained to us that they have to charged one dollar per person for the filter water that we were drinking!! Give me a break!!! The owner does not know how to do business! I know he's got bills to pay like everyone else, but I thought this was a very sneaky way to charge people!! If you're not too thirsty, and you don't want to pay a dollar for filter water, I would order something else.       I would come back here again and asked for Jimmy to be my waiter because he's a wonderful server. And bring some tissue for the ladies room.",

The bathrooms were the most disgusting I'd ever seen. The only difference between it and a gas station bathroom was the smell wasn't as bad. Trash all over the floor, broken bbathroom door locks, marred and leaning stall walls, and there was a nice young lady using one of the sinks to take a hoe bath.  Our waitress was courteous but inattentive. The food was mediocre. Portions were small because of the special menu but they still listed the full price of the meal on our bill...$35!!!! if you don't order a $3.50 soft drink, you'll get charged $1 per person for tap water they've brought out in a pretty bottle.  The salad and sides bar was probably nice earlier in the day but buy the time we arrived around 10pm, it was picked over, spilling over, and neglected.  I brought all of this to the managers attention and I swear I could see the words going in one ear and falling out the other.  Oh and to top it all off, they were kind enough to print the tip calculated on the full amount of our meal. Ha!",

Our waitress was Stephanie and she was the BEST! Very very helpful and attentive, and she really made our lunch that much better.  The meat is TOP NOTCH, and so are the drinks! I usually have to doctor up my Bloody Mary's once they get to the table, but I drank my Bloody Mary with no additions at all! I would definitely recommend doing the AYCE because there are so many flavorful meats, and the seafood is great too. If you have any room left for dessert, the tiramisu is so delicious, and not too sweet which was the best part! Overall, I would definitely come back and I recommend anyone looking for good food to come here.",

It was outrageous to learn you charge $1.00 p/p for tap water.   Waited about 12-15 min to get served by the waiter. The soup (both chilly and vegetable) were very salty.   In the menu it mentioned few types of beef.  However, we had chicken and pork passing more frequently than beef.  The picanha was very good though!   Comparing with all the other buffets out there in Las Vegas, this one is expensive.",

Usually I think lamb is greasy and fatty. However, Pampas chose a nice cut and cooked it perfectly. It was tender and had hardly any fat on it.  The only thing they didn't have were chicken hearts. I don't know if they were out or if they even offer that normally. (I know their menu changes) I would recommend Pampas to travelers looking for a fun restaurant and in the mood to over indulge a bit. Honestly, everything was delicious. I could hardly move after my meal. I think I'm still full actually.",

Being a Brazilian type steakhouse, we wanted to try all. We were offered an upgrade for $10. Not bad. Or so I thought.  Being from Chicago (foodies), disappointed in the selection of meats, as well as the quality of the meats. The meat was either RAW or so tough my knife wouldn't cut through it. To be fair, the manager did offer us different meats trying to please us. It was STILL awful.  The salad bar did NOT offer all of these glorious offerings as stated. I do not consider olives a \"side dish\".  Water is \"bottled\" and $1 per person. However, the bottle is simple a refilled bottle of tap water.  This Yelp review is for a free dessert- here's hoping that's the best part of the night. Cheesecake was pretty good. Worth putting this review up.  If you get the voucher and you want something \"free\" this is the place to go. I'm regretful I paid $20 for my husband and I to eat here.  And now, typing from the bathroom...it's as disappointing as was the food.",

We're told 35 to 40 minutes for a party of 4, an 30 minutes after that we're still waiting. My wife wisely says if we leave they'll call our name right afterwards and we'll have another 40 plus minute wait somewhere else. Another half an hour passes and I've already been to the host stand 3 time by now. Upset guest are all around us facing the same problems. Finally after waiting to talk to the manager for 20 minutes, she's been fielding similar issues with other upset guest. To make it more irksome they have the Open Table app which first tells us our wait time and after that countdown it pops up and says 4 parties ahead of you, that's after the first 40 minutes. The folks at the host station not knowing we can see this keeps changing their story, there's 10 ahead of you. There's 15 ahead of you. I am pretty understanding but if they could had been honest with the time up front we would had understood, now we're just ticked off. At home it's now past 9pm and I have a hungry family and a child with special needs starved.  Manager finally arranged a table, the food was delicious and she did check back and apologized. We were well fed, but in the end no offers to make it right. We realize Brazilian dinning is a bit more leisurely than some, just wish they would had been straight with us in the 1st or even the 2nd or 3rd times and we would had gladly moved on.",

    "text": "Ok, so I guess I'm just used to Fogo De Chao. But, how does one call themselves a Brazilian steak house and only have 2 cuts of beef. I mean 2 really. Tri-tip beef that was so cooked it was grey. Picanha, saving grace, only reason for the 2nd star. Wasn't because of the service or the salad bar or the ambiance. Why not just call yourself a salad bar with select meat. Also, I count 21 table around me with 2-5 people per table. They keep sending out one skewer of meat, which doesn't even make it fully around the \"lunch rush.\" Considering that Fogo is $35 for lunch and this was $21, I'd rather have just gone to fogo and not wasted a meal. I mean pineapple isn't a cut of meat, it's a fruit. Why would you bill that as cut of meat? I mean that is just silly. Save your money, go elsewhere. Also, having the bartender as a server is stupid during a lunch rush considering you sat every table in the bar. There were waiters for all table but 5, I was one of the 5, which he had plus the bar. Getting up to ask for another cocktail or having to get up to ask for anything is ridiculous. One this is Vegas. Two this is a restaurant. Why should I get up to get things like water, a clean plate, or another knife- since you took mine. How do I tip, when I'm having to ask for things that should be on the table? Also, avoid the ultimate \"steak\" burger, just because it comes from a cow doesn't make it steak worthy. This tasted and looked like a frozen hamburger patty from Costco or restaurant depot. I walked past Panda Express coming here, would've been a better choice! What a waste.",

I recommended this place to my out of town friend so we came a 2nd time and brought 6 people. Service was a complete 180 from our first time. We gave it another shot on Valentine's yesterday. Service was the complete worst iv experienced anywhere. Our waitress Alessandra was terrible and it's nothing personal I think that she was overwhelmed within her own capacity as when we got there the restaurant was only half full. It took the first round of meat 20 minutes to arrive and about 30 min into our dinner our server asked us if we were ready for dessert. Very frustrating because you could clearly tell our plate were near clean still. Next was the issues with the food in an hour long sink experience only 3 of the 20 plus meats came by and at one point we asked our server if she could send over the serloin guy she asked us how we wants it cooks and said she would send him over. 15 minutes later the guy came by with the last couple slices of meat and they were well done. We asked for our dessert finally and she be out us our check before our dessert. Right when we got the dessert she asked if she could take our check. Me and my girlfriend felt as though she was trying to rush is out of the place. This place needs a serious overhaul in service if they expect to keep customers. I used to say this was one of my favorite places but in 12 months it has become one of my least favorites",

    "text": "The place: Located in the Planet Hollywood \"Miracle Mile\" shops it didn't look like much from the outside.  We actually sat outside in the mall, but went through the restaurant to get the food.  The interior decorating is what should be described as Brazilian?  The food: We sampled just about everything. Ham, top sirloin (pixhaca?), spicy and sweet chicken, pineapple, pork tenderloin, sausage, and bacon wrapped turkey.  The standouts were the pork tenderloin and the bacon wrapped turkey.  All of the buffet stuff inside was seriously depleted when we first tried to sample it, but was restocked quickly and was tasty.  The buffet included; stewed meat, cheeses, salad, fried plantains, rolls, lentils, pineapple salsa, squid salad, cheesy potatoes, Caprese salad, Swiss chard.   The bottom line: Great experience, started a bit slow, but once the skewers started coming they were paced just fine. Gilbert was great waiter as were all of the guys wielding the skewers.",

Our server, David, was very courteous, well spoken and showed up with drink refills as soon as your glass even looked like it was getting empty.  The salad bar was one of the best I've ever had and when the food started coming out we were blown away at the amazing variety and flavors of all the meats they had to offer.  We ordered the surf and turf rodizio and I highly recommend this to anyone visiting Pampas.  They even take your photo after dinner and give you a complementary postcard with an option to buy other photos.  One of the best I've ever had, I wish we had one at home.",

After more research turns out they always do that.  Not much of a discount eh? It's about $33 for an all you can eat Brazilian bbq.  You can get the all you can eat surf and turf for about $10 more.  We just went with the standard selection. Their buffet bar was decent, lots of Mediterranean style sides, tons of olives, cheese, pasta, etc., they definitely are confused. The meat was OK, I've definitely had better.  The thing about Brazilian BBQ's is that you get what you pay for, so if you want high quality all you can eat meats, you're gonna have to fork over at least $50/person. Overall, highly mediocre experience, lots of food though.",

We sat at the bar for 20 minutes and NEVER got asked for our order.  No one else was sitting there except for a young couple dining.  The restaurant was ok (all you can eat Brazilian steak, chicken, lamb....) but the dining set up was odd. It was like fine dining in a food court. Meh.  As I mentioned the food service was friendly and prompt but I was turned off by the lazy bartender and the 'airport food court' ambiance of the dining room.  Some redesign and staff changes might make for a better experience.",

    "text": "We went to Pampas Brazilian Steakhouse for Mother's day this year.  My family and I have been to several Brazilian steakhouses so we were looking forward to eating here.  This is probably my least favorite so far.  Only reason I say this is because it feels more like a buffet versus a Brazilian steakhouse.  If I had to grade the entire experience: Atmosphere: C When I first walked by the patio seating and saw the bar, I thought this looked like an attractive restaurant.  However, we were sat in this large room with at ton of tables and other patrons.  Everyone is going to the salad area to get food so it feels really busy.  This made it feel even more like we had gone to a buffet/cafeteria.  It was definitely lacking in intimacy.   Wait Staff: B- The men who came with the meat swords were all very attentive.  However, our main waitress seemed bored when she came to our table.  It was like she was disinterested with us. Food: A-  The food was all really good.  I enjoyed everything I tried from the buffet salad area.  My favorite meat had to be the top sirloin.    Price: Average (in comparision to other Brazilian steakhouses) Will we go back?  All of us agreed it was fun to come to Planet Hollywood and try a new place.  It's one of those places you enjoyed having a meal at but won't run back to eat there again.",

The salad bar selections are 10 times better at a golden coral and fresher too. The servers bring around the beef, chicken and pineapple etc on skewers from which they slice onto your plate. The meat was so salty my wife and I couldn't eat it . There was no organization or timing as to when they came around. Initially they came all at once then they were nowhere to be seen. The food is horrible tasting. Service is better at McDonalds. Dining out should be enjoyable in Vegas. Save yourself the pain. Pay a little more - go to Mon Ami Gabi at Paris or east on Flamingo a few blocks to Roy's. It's worth it.",

    "text": "My husband and I discovered Pampas through Groupon as we enjoy Brazilian BBQ.  What we discovered is one of our new favorite restaurants that we recommend often.  We also go every chance we get.   The restaurant itself is comfortable but still retains the atmosphere of a better restaurant.  The service has always been above par, the staff goes above and beyond to ensure their guests (not customers) have everything they could possibly need.  Their salad bar is fresh and has a great selection.  Actually, I could eat my entire meal from there but their meats are so good I have to remind myself save room for the main course.Although I have been to other Brazilian places that have a wider selection of meats that come to your table, their selection is still vast enough that you don't feel deprived.  If you leave this restaurant hungry, there is something wrong with you because the choices cater to all eaters.  Now it may be on the pricier side, I don't mind paying for quality and service and that is exactly what you get there.  Also, if you have Groupon or Living Social, they have deals that really make this place a steal.  We have been back several times and never once have we been disappointed.  I think my hubby would go every week if we could.  If you are ever in the Miracle Mile shopping mall and feel major hunger pains, I would easily recommend this place to satisfy your tummies!",

Instead, we were only given a discount.  (We presented the coupon when we arrived and specifically stated that we only wanted the free lunch.  We did not receive anything other than what was supposed to be free.)  There were two of us and we waited 35 minutes to be seated, even though the restaurant was about 65% empty.  The server was VERY slow.  The meat arrived about every 15 minutes.  That is far too long to wait when you are only given pieces that are about two bites in size.  The taste of the food was mediocre at best.  All in all, our dining experience was about 3 hours.  This place suffers from VERY poor management.  Our free lunch ended up costing over $18 because the server charged us for things like water and she added a large gratuity for herself.  I will never, ever return.  (By the way, the Big Bus Tour was awesome.)",

Be sure to cut bites so you get the seasoning otherwise the meats pretty normal. The grilled pineapple was something sweet to breakup all the meat.    We also liked the \"salad\" bar. Not much average salad stuff, but lots of yummy pasta salads, heart of palm, artichoke, smoked salmon. Even the ice tea was amazing!   If you like to try new things, this is the place to go.

They has scallops wrapped in proscuitto, grilled shrimp, grilled/glazed salmon and when we were there the catch of the day was grilled shark. Everything was fresh and tasty. I have been to some that are overly salty and everything tastes the same. This is not the case here. I tried the meats and they were fabulous as well. The caipharaina (not sure on spelling?) drinks were outstanding! The salad bar is pretty good but if you're just looking for salad, I actually prefer Texas de Brazil.

The happy hour specials where fine but we ordered Wings and Taquitos and the taquitos were weird. They are not your normal mexican taquito. Too fat, with mascerated, dry chicken and a thin flour skin on the outside. I thought the wings were kind of dry too. We paid $16 for two appetizers and drinks, so it was worth it, but barely.",

If you can snag a Groupon with a promotional discount for $36, as we did, you can get out for a little over $50 with tip.  LOL - your food will taste a lot better if you're not overpaying!. We were served grilled shrimp, mussels, salmon, and on the skewers:  Grilled or roasted pork, chicken, trip-tip, sirloin steak, sausage, ham and grilled pineapple.  They were all very good to succulently delicious - when you could get them. Various waiters serve the meats by carving skewers tableside - we had to wait a long time between servings/variety, etc.  If they thought we would get full by making us wait - WRONG.  We stayed over an hour just to make sure we would get ALL of the entrees that cost so much money.  Tip:  Skip the hot buffet items unless you really need to eat rice, pasta and mashed potatoes.  You will need the \"room\" to try all of these various entrees.",

I had a Groupon for lunch for two at Pampas that I purchased for Vegas vacation for my first-time experience at a Brazilian restaurant and filing up for the rest of the day; saving money on the cost of dinner.  Bottom line, Pampas was the worse place we went and place we ate. The service was horrible.  Either the food was overcooked (shrimp skin was stuck to the shrimp)or undercooked. Chicken and most of the beef items were undercooked or rare.  I was very sick after eating at the restaurant and instead going shopping on the strip, I ended up going to Walgreen's to get Pepto Bismol and then back to the hotel to sleep, after hurling up the food that I had eaten at Pampas. Shortly after I was hungry! Horrible Shortly after I was hungry! Horrible! Cold and loud where seated (inside mall patio area) too. Was near exit/entrance of mall doors and during Dec. visit it was too cold.  It was also loud because near DB pool hall. Never again!!!!",

What is the point of making a reservation then? So, this is consistent with what other reviewer said.  It should be a warning signal but we were in LAV for a vacation and don't want to ruin our evening so we wait patiently.   After 30 min or so, we got a table. It was a busy night so we waited patiently for the waiter for a while and the manager shown up and shown us the menu and took our drink order. Look like they were short on staffs or something but the service was terrible. During the entire time, we see our waiter once and the second time when we grapped him to get the check.  The food was a big disappointment. The salad is below average and you can get better salad at any other places A LOT CHEAPER than the 25.00 they charged.The meat was so so, filet mignon a pretty chewy, lamp is undercooked, etc  we have eaten at Fogo de Chaos, and Texas Brazil so we think  the foods are definitely better there.  We have a groupon we bought for 50.00 and suppose to worth 100.00, but the waiter charged us an extra 25 for using groupon and gave us a 75.00 credit instead of 100.00 like on the groupon.  I am not going to argue with them, they just sold there reputation for 25.00 as far as I concerned and we will never go back here,  Watch out!",

All the beef we got was too tough or oversalted.  Maybe they oversalt the food so you order more drinks... Soft and hard drinks are pricey. They don't include drink prices on the menu, so ask before you order or just go with water. For the out the door price with drinks, its not a good value.",

My boyfriend and I saw a promo via RetailMeNot offer that says buy one get one free on the Surf & Turf. Sounds like a great deal right?  I mean, RetailMeNot is a reputable discounted place to get good discount.  We go there and show the offer to the waiter...he says he doesn't know anything about it.  Fine. Not a problem while he go ask his manager.  The Manager came over and basically told us they cannot honor it.  Hmmm, I'm thinking why not? while my boyfriend is talking to the Mgr.  Long story short. They refused to honor the offer via RetailMeNot.  Fine.  We were there...we ate and left. Our bill total was about $82.  I added tips and rounded up to exactly $100. A few days later, I was paying my credit bill online and just happens to gland over my most recent charges.  I'm glad I did. Saw that PAMPAS charged my account $190.  I called the restaurant and was told they are busy and the Mgr will call me back before they close at 10:30 pm. Waited waited waited no call. Next day no one even bother to call either.  Finally, my boyfriend call them.  Instead of a call back because that's what they will do...which we already knew they probably wouldn't.  He insisted on being on hold until a Mgr comes.  The Mgr told  him they found the error and will be crediting back the OVER CHARGE to us after he waited while they do the research.  No apology.  No NOTHING from them.   IF you're a local, don't ever go here.  If you're a TOURIST, go to TEXAS de Brazil..,it's not even that far from the STRIP. If you decided to eat here...please double check your posted transaction.  Hope they don't over charge you like they did on us.  The place has mediocre food.  Nothing to rave about. Totally over priced even if you get a discount.",

So besides the price of the rodizio, which is fair, and the service, which is also fair for the price you are paying, this place lacks good management. The meats are served cold sometimes, dry, and the Caipirinha is overpriced. I am writing this to everyone who knows what a real Brazilian Churrascaria should be like (especially in Vegas). You will be better off going to Texas de Brazil, Fogo de Chao and Via Brazil (my favorite). Trust me, those restaurants I cited are a little bit more expansive, but a million times better. In addition, where is the manager in this place? Asking me how the service and food is doing on my table??? This place is a joke :/  I am a Brazilian foodie dude from Sao Paulo - SP. I know what is good... I should had trusted the reviews on Yelp, which rated this place kind of low and then gone to Via Brazil. But my gf had a Groupon so that's why we tried...  Go to Via Brazil! That's a real Churrascaria that meets my standards of quality food/service in Las Vegas.   For Brazilians now: Essa Churrascaria ta de brincadeira, ja fui em churrascarias de 15 reais na zona Leste de Sao Paulo que tinham um salad bar 20 maior e melhor, Carnes frescas. Nao eh isso que vc vai encontrar aqui.   Food from the rodizio is VERY LIMITED. Some of meats served had no salt nor flavor, some were cold, and no Garlic picanha? ??? This place is a joke, it's burning the good reputation of brazilian food. Sorry, but I hope the owned reads it and decide to put a decent manager there........  Two starts because the place looks nice, but the food and management is a joke as I explained above.   Chef Gordon should visit this place.......",

My company promote Pampas so I decided to give it another chance and see what it's all about. The service was not great, our server was not friendly, meat is NOTHING compare to Texas de Brazil. You think the salad bar at Pampas has a huge selection...GO TO Texas de Brazil and compare for yourself. I haven't had lunch at Texas de Brazil but the dinner prices for both restaurant are similar.

Dupree told us where it was and gave us a coupon for Pampas if we wanted to return.  After sampling the ice cream, we decided to go back.  But the coupon was only for the seafood portion, which we weren't interested in.  I explained that my son and I could eat our weight in meat but the daughter and wife had small appetites.  I also told him our budget was $100 for 4 people.  Dupree went into the restaurant, got his GM, Jonathan, and explained what I told him.  Jonathan approved the deal, saving us over $70 on the dinner, and my son and I ate like kings while the ladies pecked at the bountiful salad bar.  David, our English waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable.  Of everything they served, I liked the red chimichurri sauce and also the grilled pineapple.    Highly recommended for when you're hungry for non-stop meat!",

We went to the one at the Fashion Show mall. It gives you around half off or something from their full price. I think I paid $25 instead of $40 or whatever their price is at the restaurant.  The meats were decent, but I've had better. Some of their cuts were way too salty for my taste. But for Vegas, I guess it's not a bad place to go. Something different from your normal buffets.   I wasn't happy with their service though. They were really slow in coming by with each meat. The servers seemed too lazy to walk around our table to serve, instead, they had us clumsily pass each other each slices, which was annoying. It doesn't take that much effort to take a few extra steps to serve us. They were really slow in filling our drinks, left all of our glasses empty most of the time. And even more slow in bringing our check.",

By one, there were seven or eight tables dining and our server was everywhere. He was nice and treated us well, but managing his tables and training took a toll on the level of service.  The food was decent. Not the best rodizio, but the AYCE basic meat came with 6 different proteins and the salad bar. With fifty different cold and hot items at the bar, you are bound to find something to eat. Unlike other places I have tried, the offerings are cheaper in quality and it showed. The fried bananas were just breaded bananas that were fried not the plantains I was hoping for. Pastas and bean dishes are offered to fill up diners.   The six meats that were offered consisted of bacon wrapped turkey, sausage, ham with pineapple, spicy chicken, BBQ chicken, pork, and sirloin. The latter were the best items. The beef was cooked to a nice medium rare and juicy. The pork was flavorful and possessed a nice spice rub. The pineapple was something my friend and I wished came around more frequently then once. The chicken didn't have much going for them. Not spicy or bold, so throwing chimichurri on them was the only way to spruce them up. The meats took a while to first come around, but once it started it was a blitzkrieg.",

They've got an outside section that sits in the mall area under some cute stringed lightbulbs and exterior decor. The buffet included with the meat rodizio that we all got, was nice. The choices of meats for the lunch were very nice as well. We particularly enjoyed the top sirloin, the bacon wrapped chicken, and bacon wrapped filet mignon. Our server Marco was extremely attentive and friendly- always making sure we had servers bringing meats to our table. One server in particular also stood out as very friendly and likable. His name is Rynerth, aka \"Rusty\". He had a very nice smile, and was very professional each time he came to our table. Overall, we had a very nice experience and will definitely come back again soon. Yum!",

The salad bar is generous, I highly recommend the little cheese breads as well as the mashed potatoes- they were delicious.  There is a lot of meat to review so I will note the standouts:  The bacon wrapped chicken- it was juicy and flavorful and tasty overall . The sirloin- you can select how rare you went it right off the sword- it was tender and the seasonings were great.  The barbequed pork- Okay, I'm am genuinely not a fan of pork (with the exception of the occasional bacon added or wrapped item or holiday ham) but this was probably the best thing there. It was DELICIOUS- savory, sweet and juicy, I couldn't believe it. Even if you do not like pork or ham you have to try it!  The service was attentive and quick, my glass was rarely empty and there was always someone ready to serve up some meat. Good place for lunch and groups.",

As opposed to some groupon establishments, they really attended to us like we were full paying customers.  We made reservations and were promptly seated within 10 minutes. The salad bar is amazing. Theres so much selection, but just the right amount. Theres a little something for everyone ! Soup, mashed potatoes, grilled veggies, salads, breads, and even some pasta and rice.   Onto the meats, the bbq pork was sensational. Well done, yet moist and tender, just the right amount of seasoning and glaze. It was amazing. Prime rib and scallops were also amazing. Could not get enough of the shrimp ! The chicken and ham were okay, not bad but forgetable.   The service was great. The cooks slicing the meats were very kind and had great sense of humor. Our waitress was amazing. She came at all the right times, and came by just enough.   As we were leaving , I asked for the bill, and to my suprise ir was $1.40 , I waved our waitress over thinking this was an error, but it wasnt ! She decided to not charge us for 2 beers and an iced tea because our table was not ready at exactly oue reservation time !  I was in shock. And left a very generous tip.  All in all, it is on the pricier side, but the food and great service really justify it. I would come again , but next time go easy on the salad bar.",

    "text": "We had to ask twice to have meat brought to us (once when a hostess walked by, another time by walking up to the hostess station when we couldn't find a waitress). Prior to asking, in our first 45 minutes there, we had been only been offered chorizo and ham. When we did finally start getting food, most of it was dry and/or unseasoned. The only cuts either of us actually liked were the chorizo and the bacon-wrapped chicken. When my wife wanted another drink, we once again had to seek out the hostess and ask to get one. And when it was time for dessert, we ordered flan, which isn't a dessert they make on the spot (unless it's a box mix, I guess). It should have just been a matter of picking up the dish from the fridge and bringing it out, but it took so long that we gave up  and went to the hostess to ask for our check for the one drink we had that wasn't covered by our Groupon. Maybe our experience was a result of having a Groupon?  Again, we waited as the hostess consulted with two servers, neither of which were our server. I had to walk over to them again and this time asked for the manager. We waited several minutes for the manager, as the hostess asked to to \"hold on\" while she seated other guests. I got so tired of the waiting that I actually just told the hostess, \"nevermind, we're leaving\" when she turned around and said \"there's the manager\".  The manager was apologetic (nobody else was), but despite our experience and my request that she just comp us the $7 or whatever for the drink, since we didn't even have the dessert that was supposed to be included, she still insisted that I needed to pay \"the tax\". It was only $2.49, so I paid and left. But I'm not sure what was taxed. Sales tax is 8%, so to have $2.49 in sales tax would require a bill of over $30. And, again, we had a Groupon that covered everything except for one sangria, so I'm not sure what I was being taxed on.  AVOID THIS PLACE. The worst restaurant experience I've ever had, hands down.",

He made reservations but trying to find parking in the Miracle Miles garage was rough and the Hotel valet was full. So we ended up being 20 mins late. There was a long line out the doorway and even after checking in we had to wait. I don't think our reservation mattered to the hostesses though because they still went in order. A couple that was waiting when we came left without being seated because they had been waiting too long. We stayed and was patient after all we were late. After about a half hour we were seated. Our Server Renan was great, not too much personality just professional and did his job. The salad bar was very minimal and could've had a lot more sides but the Cous Cous and mushrooms were amazing! The Cous Cous had a Brazilian sauce in it that tasted so good. I've never had Cous Cous like that before. The cocktails were nice not too much liquor but great flavor. Can't remember the names but we had the ones with Acai berries and gaurana in them. Some of the medium rare meats were already cold when they got to our tables but all the meats had flavor and were juicy. We chose the cheesecake for dessert and it was creamy and soft. So good!   We go out every week to try a new restaurant and overall in terms of food Miami's restaurants beat Las Vegas' hands down and we have been disappointed a lot when we dine out in Vegas. So I can't say this was my favorite Rodizio/Brazilian Steakhouse that I've ever been to but it was good enough. I would come again!",
