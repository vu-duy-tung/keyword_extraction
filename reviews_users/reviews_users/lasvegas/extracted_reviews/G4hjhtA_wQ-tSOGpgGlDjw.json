First off, the owner and his partner (the chef) run the place and take great pride in their company. They're friendly and happy to serve their amazing and unique dishes. The Lucas Taco is my favorite, but the Pulpo Taco (octopus) is my husband's favorite! Their homemade cheesecake is also fantastic, we often take it to go! Everything about this place is authentic and the food is delicious. Save your time and money at those overrated restaurants in the casinos! Bajamar is IT!",

We got horchata which is served in a big mug and was amazing on a warm day. Then we had 2 fish and 2 octopus tacos and both were incredible as well as rice and beans on the side. Make sure you're ready for a little heat if you order the octopus taco! The total bill for 2 people was $22 which is a steal for the quality of food you receive here. Our server was very genuine and the whole experience makes me want to go back tomorrow.  I wish this restaurant was down the street from my house.",

Because Manny and his chef put together some of the most interesting Baja Style Seafood Fusion tacos you will ever wrap your lips around. I ordered the first two tacos on the menu and they were amazing! When they asked if I was ready for the check I asked for the menu and ordered more tacos.! If you are real foodie you cannot leave Vegas without going to this place at least once. The quality and flavor of the food is top-notch. And Manny the owner makes it a pleasure to eat in his restaurant by making everyone feel special",

Located on Las Vegas Blvd (The strip) heading towards Downtown, you'll find a quaint, brightly colored, turquoise building. As you enter, the bar is at the main entrance, to your left is the seating arrangement. The owner is there to greet you, super nice and approachable. He walks you through the menu, and explains each item. They are known for their seafood tacos! And let me tell you, they have exceeded my expectations! My fiance recommended that I try the Marlin taco a las brasas and I also wanted to try the fish ceviche tostada. The white fish for the tostada was unbelievably fresh! I am a huge hot sauce girl and this didn't need any extra kick or flavor, it was so delicious! My mouth literally waters talking about it. Great size to share as well. The Marlin was unlike any other taco I've ever had. The taco was crispy and the sauce had a tomato base sauce, fish was super fresh! A bit messy to eat but TOTALLY worth it! I will definitely be coming back! Well done, Bajamar!  Now open more locations! Preferably in the Southwest part of town",

It's so tender and juicy and it reminds me of the skin and fat of buffalo wings (none of that pesky chicken meat) but octopus is actually very low in fat! How do they cook it like that?  My friend invited to for lunch, and she got two pulpo tacos and one fish. I got one pulpo, one fish, and one shrimp. I should have just gotten all three pulpo. The fish and shrimp was good, but not mind blowingly better than other places I've had. But the octopus! Not only have I not seen it on menus as a hot dish or taco, but it was also prepared so well, with a crispy, yet not hard shell tortilla, and fresh cabbage/tomato/chipotle cream. Everything about it was perfect.  The chef/owner? was extremely nice and remembered my friend. She spilled some sauce on her white pants and asked for some soda water to try to clean it up. He didn't have any, so he went to the Super Burrito place across the lot and got some for her there. What service!  The only thing is it's a little pricey, but it is in the normal part of downtown and not the ghetto. It's across from Viva Las Arepas. Parking is easy, and more parking in the back as well. The inside is very bright and clean. Doesn't look or feel like a dive, though I'm not at all against going to those places either. Def gonna be back!",

There are tacos, tostadas, and more here, but they all come topped with creatures from the sea. This little gem is snuggled into a vagrant-friendly section of Las Vegas Blvd by the OG stripclub, but it's bright and colorful with friendly staff and fabulously fresh food.   Grab a trio of tacos or a couple of tostadas and share with a friend- or don't, I won't judge you. The namesake Bajamar fish taco is a solid and tasty go-to but if you like spicy, the pulpo (octopus) enchilado version is even better. The Marlin and Lucas tacos are also recommended, with the cocktails being best for groups. Belly up to the bar and ask Manny what's best!",

I walked in and no one greeted me or said anything and when I asked to sit at a table I was refused because I was by myself. I had to take the one last cramped seat at the bar even though two tables were open. When I ordered grilled fish tacos, they came fried. No one checked on me so I could not even express that it was wrong. The one guy by the register kept walking around to hit on a young hot girl which her bike helmet waiting for take out. My tacos were completely out of the tortilla and looked like they were thrown together in haste. Oh and the waitress came by and took my fork before i was done :( . Safe to say worst service I ever experienced (and I've been to some pretty sketchy establishments) and small portions. You've been warned stay away!",

I'll probably make this a new spot for Saturday lunch from now on. The service was great and attentive. If you like tacos at all, just go. you won't regret it.

    "text": "Best seafood tacos this side of the border. I've traveled to fishing villages through Mexico and never tasted anything as amazing as this place. This place gives Baja style seafood tacos a whole different meaning. The service is quick and the quality of their product is unsurpassed. The first few times I went the only disappointing thing was that they didn't sell beer, but now they have various ice cold beers on tap. All things in the menu are great but my 2 favorite items have to be the pulpo enchilado taco, and the marlin a las brasas taco. I guarantee that once you try it , you'll be hooked. I am anxiously awaiting the launch of their new menu since it will include the marlin al pastor taco that I had the privilege of tasting while they were testing it out. I can't wait.",

With the recommendation from my coworker, I decided to stop in and see what he was \"taco\"ing about. :)  We both had a specialty drink, a shrimp tostada as well as two tacos each and we split the last one. For under I believe 30? Which is steal for the quality of food and detail they put out of that kitchen! Considering they are on LV blvd you should not complain about the prices. especially with how BIG the tacos are and the generous amount of fish given.  Manny is I believe the owner/general manager, but he was also our server! He was pleasant and always had a smile, and welcoming guests everytime they walked in. A couple who would be considered a \"regular\" who has visited the past couple of days while on vacation... walked in and he greeted them and seem to know what they were gonna order before they order it! How sweet! Manny and my boyfriend got to talking about various things, and how they started and where they are from. He is just an overall wonderful person to talk with. He even walked food over to there rival super burrito... EVEN THEY liked his food! :)   Boyfriend loved the authenticity of the horchata, the sauces, the fish batter, and the tostada. I loved it all. :)  I will be def coming back, and I will continue to tell people about this spot. They have only been open 4 months, and I hope they are there for the next forty years.   Come try them out, give a small business a chance to grow, they are hard working just trying to bring good food to vegas!",

The food was prepared immediately and was outstanding. I highly recommend this location and look forward to returning here during my next business trip.",

    "text": "Wow! This place is killing it on the taco front. My fave thing is the tortilla texture. It is not simply heated and filled. These tortillas are lightly fried and provide great chew and a little crunch. Not to mention the filling is abundant so you cannot roll this taco into your mouth.  Lucas taco was a great mash up of a shrimp chike relleno and a taco. Shrimp cooked perfectly, melts cheese inside the cooked pepper. Had to use a fork and I am not complaining! Surf n turf taco was a perfect marriage of their perfectly cooked shrimp and beef. Topped with guacamole but the fried onion crown was the cherry on top! A great departure from standard taco toppings. Had to try an octopus taco. I chose the Octopus Chicharron taco. I have never had octopus prepared this way and I am a fan! Texturally octopus is not my favorite but by deep frying the octopus it became a crunchy but still chewy marvel. This place makes me wish I had a Bajamar in my town! Until we meet again tacos of my dreams! Manny is super friendly, works hard and has this place humming! He makes it look easy. Food came out fast, hot and delish! Hope I get the chance to visit again and try more things on the menu. Hats off to chef!",

I also got a ceviche (cant remember the name) but it's the one with sesame oil. It was amazing. A different flavor profile then traditional ceviche but worth trying something new. Everyone I was with had nothing but good things to sat about what they ordered. You get a lot of food for the price.  Like I said this will be a go to for me whenever I'm in Vegas.

The best of the bunch being the lightly crisp tilapia. Worth it? Hardly. 2 stars - for service and cleanliness. Sharky's Mexican has a great example of what a fish taco role model is. Go there.",

    "text": "If tacos are a game, then we have a winner. The winner.  Bajamar Seafood & Tacos is one of the newest establishments to grace the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Wyoming. This intersection has surprisingly been a destination hosting many foodstuffs over the year. It was the birthplace of the Goodwich, the first home of Desyree's gelato, and a brief incubator for Chef Justin Kingsley Hall (now of the Kitchen at Atomic). It's still home to the institution known as Luv-It Frozen Custard, although I may have started to visit it beyond those years.  And now we have Bajamar, the pinnacle of Mexican seafood tacos as far as I've witnessed. Maybe I haven't been to Mexico, but I've had a few delightful tacos in San Diego (as recently as eight days ago), both of which are the previous stops of the gentlemen who are running this place. Compared to those experiences they're doing everything better (aside from one killer smoked fish taco).  I happened to show up on Tuesday. This and Monday are when they offer the namesake Bajamar fish tacos ($3.50) for a dollar discount (down to $2.50, making them a steal). These are the best fish tacos I've had, with white fish battered and fried to crispy and tender perfection. These golden-brown morsels are layered along with salsa, red cabbage, and a delicious chipotle cream sauce inside an oiled and heated corn tortilla (the same single tortilla prep as in all of the other tacos which I enjoyed). A squeeze of lime is nice but not necessary. There isn't really any heat unless you wanna use the bottled hot sauces which the server provides you even if you don't ask.  You can get by on the fish tacos alone, but then you'd be missing out on other taco treats. The Pulpo Enchilado ($4) comes with chile de arbol, packing some heat but not that much (even for relatively heat-sensitive palates like mine), some Monterey cheese, and more of that salsa fresca and red cabbage. Amazingly tender octopus, which you might almost forget is present unless you get the pieces with the suction cups. I think it was in one of those food shows on TV where I heard that leaving those on adds texture, and now I see what they meant.  Last up for lunch was the Lucas taco ($5). I wanted to try their sauteed shrimp, and it was cooked to the right texture. Although it has the standard orange-ish and white appearance if you clean it off - suggesting that it's not that special on its own - you'll get so much flavor from the gooey Monterey cheese, the chipotle cream sauce, and the intact longitudinally cut (aka sliced lengthwise) half of a California pepper (aka Anaheim pepper). No regrets with trying this one either.  (UPDATE 4/16/18: The $4 Marlin taco a las Bresas is also quite something. It's the kinda fish flesh that cooks up to resemble terrestrial meat in all the best ways. But it's still pescatarian-friendly. The $4 Gobernador is another great shrimp taco.)  I'd also read that the horchata ($1.50) is a steal of a deal, and CM Taylor was right. This mason-jar version is rich but never seems too sweet. Get these if you like the cinnamon-y, creamy Mexican drink.   Bajamar left me with only one question in the end: do I clean only my fingers of the heavenly mess, or do I lick the plate too? Since there were other people around, I avoided the latter. Maybe next time I won't. And by next time, I mean next week.  Drive, don't run, to experience some of the best seafood tacos by far in town or anywhere else.  (P.S. Shout-out to beer buddy Justin, if you're reading this. You put this restaurant on my list.)",

    "text": "Im a True Local Favorite Fan! They got me out of bed today with their post on Instagram, showcasing my favorite fish taco! And its 'Taco Tuesday' which means this delicious fish taco is only $2.50!  The 'Bajamar Fish Taco' has the perfect consistency and juiciness. The sauce is out of this world! I also tried the 'Gobernador' which is sauteed shrimp, with red cabbage, cilantro, monterey cheese, tomatoes and their special sauce. Its spectacular!  I always ask for my taco to be lightly crispy on the outside as it gives it the most amazing texture.  Im super full after one taco, but I always have to have one more.  My opinion, this is the best place for fresh seafood tacos in Las Vegas.. directly from Baja, Calif!  Get yourself downtown and grab a few, you will be happy you did, and hopefully will become a regular like me! And you can check out the welcome to downtown showgirl sign while you're at it!",

You walk into a beach vibe playing raggae music and you instatly relax and unwind, the employees are great and upbeat and service is second to none! They make you feel right at home when you walk in, sort of like visiting your favorite uncle's house, clean establishment and very inviting, bathrooms are well taken care of. And the food!! To die for, try their octopus taco and marlin taco and you'll be hooked! Nice selection of beer as well. I don't think i have anything bad to say about this place but the fact that this place will for sure make you gain the extra weight, trust me its worth the extra calories!!",

    "text": "Ah..the near religious experience of the perfect taco! And to add to the wonderfulness (is that a word?, well it fits) they specialize in seafood.    The place is small, but clean, open, and airy. The turnover is quick so there's not a wait even when they're busy. Our server/host/busboy was quick, efficient, friendly, and responsive.  We had the Bajamar shrimp tacos, the pulpo enchilado, and the Lucas taco. The shrimp taco had perfectly battered talapia, red cabbage, salsa fresca, and a wonderful cream salsa which all combined to make a tortilla envelope of goodness. The pulpo enchilado consists of sauteed octopus in a chili de arbol sauce, Monterrey cheese, salsa fresca, and a tasty and smooth chipotle cream sauce. The taco was incredible but the octopus kind of gets lost in everything, so I might have to sample this taco many many times to make up my mind. The Lucas taco is the specialty here and once you sample one you'll see why. Sauteed shrimp combined with grilled bell pepper, Monterrey cheese, and chipotle cream sauce make a scrumptious titanic taco. These are not huge tacos, pictures don't do them justice, but they are dense and tightly packed with amazing flavor and are highly satisfying.",

And the shrimp tostada, so full of flavor until the very last bite. And I ate it ALL. Talked to the owner and he shared with us that they're straight out of San Diego. And they buy all their food locally and share it with the small businesses in the neighborhood! Not only are they delicious but they are making a difference in downtown LV. Will DEFINITELY be back!",

The food was appropriately sized, the flavors were delicious, and I wanted more after my 3 tacos.  Not because I was hungry but because it tasted so good.  The Lucas is extremely filling!

He also provided a taste of background with the meal, which is a bonus. Overall the hospitality was outstanding.  The food was remarkably fresh and delicious! Also very affordable. From the handmade tortillas to the creamy sauce on the seafood tacos, the effort on plating was present and not forced. The combination of flavors were perfectly synchronized. There beverages are homemade as well. I can go on for a couple more paragraphs, but you definitely need to try this place if you have a taste for seafood! Or just love food!

    "text": "I came in here after reading the great reviews of the tacos, but I have to say I was a bit disappointed. i really wanted to get a feel for this place so I got the marlin tacos , the tacos gobernador, shrimp ceviche tostada, and red aguachile tostada. I love and eat mariscos, marlin and shrimp tacos regularly. So having said that I believe the Marin tacos were ok not great. I usually enjoy the tortilla on the crunchier side, these were not. Also the tacos gobernador had too much veggies, and it kind of over powered the shrimp. I also do not like my ceviche sweet. It seemed like their ceviche had ketchup or something so I did not enjoy the shrimp ceviche . On the other hand I think the red aguachile was great!",

I have had octopus before that is real tough and chewy, but Manny's is so tender with so much flavor. I did not want to stop eating it was that delicious! You won't be disappointed and I can't wait to get back!!",

I sat at the bar (no liquor license quite yet for this place, so I opted for a bottle of water), was treated with warmth and kindness from the manager who clearly was grateful for my business and served up really fantastic tacos.   The taste of the two tacos I consumed were really fantastic and an explosion of flavors is something I will not soon forget.  The presentation was top notch and the quality was spectacular.  I am certain I would feel the same with whatever I consumed off their menu.    The establishment is not large and the parking is limited in the front, but opens up on the back (near Luv-It Frozen Custard).  I was advised a liquor license for beer and wine are on the horizon.  Go have drinks someplace else and do yourself a favor and go eat here!",

This place came as a strong recommendation from an old friend so I knew I had to try it.   Cuisine: My Top 3 tacos are the Spicy shrimp, Octopus and Chile Relleno tacos. The spicy shrimp and Octopus being the top two. They each have a nice creamy sauce topped to them which I love. I've had the fish taco while it was good I wasn't crazy about it since the fish was deep fried but maybe that's for you. Now as far as a drink you MUST have the Hibiscus lemonade, the dark one. It is wonderfully tart and a nice addition to the tacos. I can't get enough of this drink and I guarantee you'll love it.  Customer service: It seems the same man is always working there every time I go and I certainly have nothing to complain about as he is attentive and friendly as well as his knowledge of the menu he can recommend anything to you that you may be in the mood for.  Location: Located in a very small parking lot which probably holds about five or six cars facing Las Vegas Blvd near Lovett's custard.  Ambiance: I really can't complain, they keep the place clean and have good music. Also plenty of paper towels at your disposal at the table!",

The place feels like one of those great little stands you walk into off the beach in Baja.   Lets start with the fish taco - the staple of any good joint in Baja - it came perfectly stacked and tasted amazing - fresh as can be - no oil flavor, just crunchy fish on a bed of cabbage with a slice of avocado and two amazing sauces slathered on top of a perfect size corn tortilla. And Mondays and Tuesdays they are a dollar off - at $2.50 they are a steal.   The cocktail was amazing and fresh. With octopus and shrimp a plenty. The best thing though was the AGUACHILE VERDE - oh my god - soooooo bomb.   Please check these guys out if you get a chance and love seafood.",

The tortillas are good, the shrimp, octopus, and carne asada have great flavors. Their house sauce is delicious!

It has 6 or 7 different Mexican and local Las Vegas beers on tap. The food, is no doubt the star. Ingredients are fresh and tasty. I chowed down the tacos, savoring the bright and powerful flavors.

I always get the green aguachile which is pretty spicy, if you don't like spicy food, STAY AWAY from both of the aguachile dishes they offer. I enjoy it so much, I could literally drink the juice from the dish.  I've also tried the Spicy Octopus taco & it was good but not as good as the Octopus Chicharron Taco. Their quesadilla is simple but really good as well because they serve it with some type of ranch sauce. The Surf N Turf fries (like carne asada fries but with shrimp and carne asada) are amazing! It's a very large portion so it's totally worth the money. The carne asada and shrimp aren't dried out unlike other places that serve carne asada.  They serve the BEST Michelada I have ever had. Love the amount of Tajin they add on the rim of the glass. It's amazing ! Their prices are very reasonable and I will continue to indulge in their yummy food! I really hope they expand because it is a little small inside although, if staying small ensures freshness, then I'll take it! Everything is made to order and I suggest you try this spot out whenever you have time!",

Given that I opted out of anything aquatic at a restaurant that solely focuses on seafood, take my review with a grain of salt.  There are very, very few options for someone who does not eat seafood. I really would not recommend coming here, if someone does not enjoy fish or shrimp.   I ordered the carne asada taco, and it was not enjoyable. The meat was tough and lacked flavor. The tortilla tasted stale. It wasn't hard, and it wasn't soft.   With incredible arepas right across the street, I could not imagine coming back.   With that said, my fish-eating companions loved it. You can be the seafood judge.",

Bajamar definitely is Awesome and then some. Very clean place - even the bathrooms, very fresh ingredients which is huge to me but even more so when we ware talking about fish.  Most incredible spicy Pulpo taco I've ever had and I've been all over both coasts of Mexico, so I feel qualified to be all judgey pants of the spicy octopus.  Can't really go wrong here, if shrimp is your thing then go for the Gobernador  or Lucas Taco but you'll only need two unless you're starving.  Just wish I was in this part of town more often so it would be easier to visit.",

I wasn't sure how it'd be but I'm sure glad we found this gem!   We ordered the Bajamar, the Marlin, the Lucas, and the Pulpo Enchilado tacos. My favorites were definitely the last two :) We also ordered the Mixed seafood soup since it was cold out. I can honestly say that this is the best Mexican seafood taco place I've been to in Vegas! I could probably eat those tacos all day!! Yummo for real! The soup was also very good; my spoon was literally loaded with seafood in each bite. They definitely don't skimp out on the portions and the prices are definitely reasonable. The micheladas are pretty tasty as well.  Aside from the food, the atmosphere is cool and the service provided by Manny is stellar! This is the real deal, Mexican mariscos...the owners, chef, and staff are from Tijuana so it's definitely authentic. They also order smaller shipments from Cali so the seafood tastes very fresh and doesn't sit in the freezer for too long. Can't wait to go back, especially when it starts warming up!",

The restaurant is extremely clean, staff very hospitable and the bar is massive. I didn't have a huge appetite when I stopped by a few days ago; therefore after a short debate I ordered one Baja Fish Taco $2.50 (perhaps a special) one Lucas Shrimp Taco $5.00 and a Side order of rice and beans $2.00 each. The fish taco was okay probably my least favorite. The Lucas taco was definitely better although it fell apart super fast and the rice was pretty bland.

    "text": "Dare I say it...the best fish tacos in Vegas! Yes, I know, Vegas isn't exactly a fish taco destination, but still! These tacos are on point!  My love and I first came in needing a quick bite to eat in the area. Bajamar had been referred to me by a couple different people at this point, and I knew there were a few items I wanted to try. Needless to say, they did not disappoint. You know it's good when on your first visit, you're already thinking of coming back and bringing other people that will enjoy the experience as well.  After two visits now, we've had the opportunity to try the Raw Shrimp Ceviche Tostada, Mixed Seafood Soup, as well as ALL of the fish and seafood tacos, which include: Pulpo Enchilado Taco Marlin Taco a Las Brasas Bajamar Fish Taco Camaron Enchilado Taco Gobernador Taco Carne Asada Taco Lucas Taco  The seafood soup was certainly good, but I think I'd stick to tacos as my main meal. What did stand out was the Pulpo Enchilado Taco, where wonderfully tender octopus finds a rightful home. The tacos tend to be dressed in a few similar fashions. A closer look reveals that there are 4 shrimp options, one octopus, one battered fish, and one grilled fish option. They are all really good, and there isn't one I'd shy away from ordering. I'm interested in trying some of the appetizers as well next time to see how far the excellence extends. If a cool lager is not your idea of a perfect taco pairing then you could explore one of the Aqua Frescas they offer: Hibiscus Lemonade and Horchata.  It's as if the whole building was plucked up from Baja California and transplanted right here in Vegas, with bright colors and aesthetics that take you ocean-side right away. Inside you'll find a bar with a few beers on tap. Sitting here allows you to engage with Manny, a proud and friendly owner. There are also a handful of tables and a few high-tops in the long, skinny space. A code to get in the bathroom reminds you of your actual setting in Vegas, but also ensures a much cleaner facility to use while at Bajamar.  Return visits will certainly happen for us...we even have some more friends in mind that need to experience Bajamar Seafood & Tacos.",

If you do...or if you're ready to begin, then this is the place for you, with Baja-Mexican flavor at a great price!  When you walk in, you are greeted by the welcoming smile of Manny, the owner. You can sit at the bar or at one of the tables and begin to peruse the delicious menu. The menu is straight forward, one side is in English, and the other in Spanish. On it you will find several Baja-style seafood options, including some amazing seafood tacos!  When my love first brought me here, we knew right away we would be coming back. All-in-all, we have ordered:  - Pulpo Enchilado Taco - Shrimp (raw) Tostada - Marlin Taco a Las Brasas - Seafood Soup - Bajamar Fish Taco - Camaron Enchilado Taco - Gobernador Taco - Carne Asada Taco  My favorite was the Pulpo Enchilado Taco but everything was made fresh and tasty. Chef makes a \"Chipotle Mayo Sauce\" that is spread on top of several of the tacos. If your friend is not in the mood for seafood?...not a problem. Chef can make Carne Asada Tacos as well. They are not on the menu, but Bajamar Seafood & Tacos will accommodate the request.   Their Tacos are not small, street tacos. They are big enough to just have two for lunch, but you'll probably want to have a third, just because it's that good. They have a few beers on tap, and offer a couple of Mexican drinks, like Hibiscus Lemonade Aqua Frescas, to quench your thirst...so refreshing!    Make a point to try Bajamar...who knows...we might even see you there.  -2018 review #9-",

    "text": "I wanted to give it 4 stars. I mean, how many 5 star reviews can a place have? All those 5-stars make me highly suspicious, especially after reading an article about fake reviews recently. It can't really be all 5 stars, right?!  Well....   It's 5 stars. It's 5 stars of delicious awesomeness.  We arrived at 5 pm on a Friday based on Yelp reviews. There were only two other people eating and I wondered if Yelp had failed us.   Manny, the owner, has a knack for creating tasty masterpieces and excellent customer service.   I asked for a recommendation and quickly ordered his first suggestion, the pulpo taco and a horchata. My friend, who is less familiar with seafood tacos, decided on  the fish. As we hesitated with our second choices, Manny suggested he put in the order and then order more if we want.   He was very accommodating, even when my friend ambiguously declared she didn't like \"something\" on her first taco. He made her next taco with no crema, but then obligingly gave her two sides of it to try. She then fell in love with the chipotle crema and he won her over.  Overall, a great experience. I'd love to  try the rest of the menu. A few recipes may need some tweaking, but they clearly know what they're doing when it comes to cooking the seafood. Since I'm just passing through town, I'd love to see their clientele grow so it's here when I return!  THE FOOD  Lucas Taco (shrimp and california chile) Absolute favorite for both of us! Think Chile Rellano with perfectly flavored shrimp. My biggest disappointment was that it fell apart and I was forced to eat it with a fork.   Pulpo (octopus) The meat was tender and not tough. I've rarely had such well-cooked octopus in the US. Delicious, but be warned - the tortilla is lightly grilled in a LOT of oil / butter. It was dripping.  Gobernador Taco (shrimp and cheese) More of the perfect shrimp! With cheese!  Bajamar Fish Taco  Sadly, this was the least favorite for both of us. The batter on the fish was a bit soggy, but I suspect that wasn't the norm. Even assuming it's usually better, it would still be just above mediocre.   Horchata This might have been an amazing 5-star horchata, but I was so busy with my tacos I hardly paid attention. Overall, a very solid, classic recipe - well balanced sweet, cinnamon, and creamy.",

We had almost every item in the menu and loved every single dish.  It's been two weeks and I still think about how good the food is on a daily basis.  Does anyone know what kind of cuisine this is specifically?",

Bar seating for 6-8, and tables for maybe another 20.  The staff is friendly, attentive, and speedy.  You have to love a staff that smiles.    For a first visit, I went with the basics - a battered fish taco, and a shrimp taco.  Both came quickly and were well presented.  Very fresh ingredients, with a nice contrast between the cabbage, fish (or shrimp), and sauces.  I'm intrigued by the octopus taco, so I'll branch out the next time I visit.",

I went with the Cabo tostada, a cold, spicy ceviche that was packed with so much lime I wanted to lick the plate like a crazed maniac. The spice is heavy though so be prepared. My eyes watered the whole time, and it was glorious. If the owner added a different dessert that was as authentic as the food, I promise I would be here EVERY.SINGLE.WEEK. I'm sure the cheesecake is good too, but it just didn't match the menu IMO. I'm on standby!",

The pulpo was great, I loved the texture of the octopus and the flavor is mild and doesn't take away from everything else happening in the taco. By comparison I didn't like the taste of the shrimp in the Lucas taco as much. I probably could have eaten that taco without the shrimp and been just fine. It has a giant pepper stuffed with cheese inside which is awesome but also super messy. The tortilla for this one is soft and gets soggy quick. The pulpo came in a hard shell which was much easier to handle. They did serve the tacos with an entire roll of paper towel which was fitting and much needed. Overall I did really like the tacos and experience. I'm going to have to come back when I don't feel as rushed and try more of the menu!",

Clean bathrooms. As a designer I'm really impressed by how well done this place is for a low budget location. Definitely worth the walk from Stratosphere.  For drinks, we ordered the Horchata and Hibiscus Lemonade, both drinks which are made here in the restaurant. 100% would recommend. For food, we got the fish taco, octopus taco, battered shrimp taco and the appetiser that was second from the top on the menu (forgot the name). 100% would recommend the tacos. The potato fries dish was tasty, but a little too heavy for me because of the cheese and sour cream.",

Try all of the tacos here. You will not be disappointed. Pro tip: there's a hot sauce you have to ask for that they make in house. Get it. I will definitely be back soon!

Aguachiles is one of my favorite things to eat and I have a go-to spot in SD, but if I had to choose between my spot and this place, I'd choose Bajamar. The aguachiles are so good you don't even need to add anything to it! I would've been down to try every taco on the menu, but I was too hungover to.

Nothing great, nothing bad.  I ordered a Baja fish taco  and so did wifey, a carne asada taco and we shared a shrimp with beets dish.  Son got the chicken fingers/fries.   Baja tacos- mine, the fish was dry and didn't have much flavor but they were a decent size. My wife's taco was cold.  Not really great for $4.50  Carne asada taco- it was good size with a good amount of guac on it but it didn't have much of anything else going for it. No salsa, no onions, no cilantro.  Asked for salsa or something to give it some more spice and they brought over some vinegary thing that wasn't spicy. Just tasted like vinegar/water.  $5 taco  The shrimp dish was raw shrimp and there was plenty of them. They hadn't sat in the marinade long enough to \"cook\" like you do with ceviche, so it was literally raw shrimp. Maybe that's how it's done and not let to cook but wasn't our thing. It had good flavor and boy was it Spicy!!! Like numb my mouth eye crying spicy. Wife couldn't handle it and I was just glad I had my horchata. It was a unique dish but wouldn't order it again. I think it made wife and I sick from the raw shrimp. $twenty something.   Chicken fingers. Two really thin strips of chicken tenders with some cold fries.  The tenders did look house made so that's a plus but it was two tiny little tenders. For $5!  The batter was almost as thick as the chicken was. Lol.    We got two horchatas, one for me and one for my kid. She asked if we wanted a kids size which we did. Son got it in the little small plastic cups that kids drinks come in which was cool but when we ask for a refill there wasn't any.  We paid the same for a regular cup and the kids size! Not a big deal if we would have known we would have just had them put his drink in a regular cup that's twice the size for the same price.     Overall not the best experience and the food didn't make up for it either.",

I've eaten at a lot of taco joints before but they seem to offer a very unique flavor and spin on their tacos that I can't place my fingers on but can certainly taste.  First off, they have parking so that was already a plus. When we walked in, we opted for the bar area and it was great because we got to see the cook and staff full in action.   Ended up ordering four items on their menu. Their raw Shrimp Tostada, which is a definite must if you enjoy raw shrimp like I do. The raw shrimp was creamy and fresh with a good lime kick. As for their Camaron (Shirmp) Enchilado, Octopus Enchilado and Bajamar Fish Taco was also very tasty too. With the combination of their thinly shredded cabbage, mayo and other fresh ingredients, it just brought everything together and made it work.   Lastly, we also ordered their Horchata  and it tasted great and certainly hit the spot. Overall, just please that we choose this spot to enjoy a great lunch and their customer service is outstanding.",

Not checking reviews prior,  we were a little concerned about the location...OMG! Freshest seafood tacos, BEST flavor combinations, and I woke up thinking about how amazing the food was. The Surf and Turf fries were phenomenal. The green Aguachile was truly one of the best dishes I have EVER had, and the Tsunami Tostada was absolutely delicious. My husband and I talked about going back today to try more items (easily a 45-minute drive), but then we found out about location #2 on Blue Diamond, which is a 15-minute drive from my house and a 5-minute drive from my work. To say that we are THRILLED is an understatement. I guarantee that we will become regulars! This place is freaking AWESOME!",

I've had both grilled and fried shrimp tacos, and some of their fish tacos which were all equally amazing. Their horchata is a bit too sweet for my liking, but don't let that stop you from ordering it. The sauce they put on the tacos isn't too heavy and overpowering and lets the rest of the flavors come through. I'm so excited to have this gem in Downtown Las Vegas!",

Food is absolutely amazing!!! Started with one taco and ended up ordering a bunch of other things. Everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned, came out hot and tickled the tastebuds! Definitely coming here again. Oh and definitely try the octopus tacos.",

I had the Gobernador, he had the Cameron Enchilado. Mine had sauteed shrimp with bell pepper, cilantro and Monterey Jack cheese. His had sauteed shrimp with Cole de arbol, Monterey Jack, red cabbage, and salsa fresca. We tried something really new for us in the Aguachile Bajamar with marinated shrimp in lime juice with bets, habanero and jicama. I had an issue with the texture of the rest shrimp but Greg loved it. The service was great. The manager wanted to take the aguachile off our bill because we didn't like it, we told him no. How sweet of him to offer.  The atmosphere is chill with Reggae music in the background. The base is beautiful. We will be coming back and bringing friends",

True story: I was in an Uber on my way to another restaurant. We were driving by and it seemed like a fun and unique place. I asked the Uber driver to drop me off. I was 2 blocks away and walked to the restaurant. Best decision ever!! The food was amazing and best seafood tacos I've had in all of Vegas. Highly recommend it and will be coming back to eat here this weekend. Thanks again Manny and staff!!",

I ordered the fish tacos, grilled and the chipotle sauce is mouth watering. There was no guacamole on the menu but they whipped some up for me on the spot the way I like it with lots of cilantro, fresh avocados and easy on the onions. Service was top notch. I love the decor of surfboards and Baja California beach art, like a Baja seaside food shack had been uprooted and transplanted on the Las Vegas Strip.",

At first I thought I liked the Octopus taco the most but the truth is everything was done really well. From perfectly crisped tortillas on the flattop to the fish and even the limes were super juicy (Nothing I hate more then someone give me a three day old dried up lime with my taco or tequila).  This is an owner operated establishment and the owner we met cares. Love that. If you are in the mood for a fish taco I suggest you find your way over here. -",

But I'm certain everything else is excellent too.  And if you like draft beer...ask them to line the rim with Tahin'.   You'll love it!",

I was greeted by Manny the owner and he took care of me!  I got a side of beans and rice and he made me some super duper yummy tacos.  Avocado tacos with alllll the fixings. Packed with veggies and creamy fresh avocado. Wow! Make sure you get a side of his hot sauce YUM!!!!   The beans were packed full of flavor and the rice was nice with corn throughout.   I took my food to go but I'll have to come back a sit up at the bar area. I bet it's a great place to people watch lol. Manny is a doll and is passionate about food and this nice place.   Super cute place, go there and support local businesses!",

Fortunately, I can just buy sinfully delicious tacos at Bajamar and forgo selling myself for tacos.  I've had some good and highly rated tacos in my life. Including seafood tacos on beaches in San Diego and Mexico. I have never eaten a taco that made my mouth dance like the octopus tacos at Bajamar. The briney, succulent, tender octopus with Just the right amount of spice in a freshly fried tortilla with the perfect sauces and cabbage on top.  Every bite was an ever-changing barrage of flavor. I got two other tacos, but honestly I could eat the octopus tacos all day every day from now until I die.  The Lucas was very unique. A grilled Anaheim Chile stuffed with cheese and shrimp topped like a taco and in a tortilla vessel. It was like a shrimp Chile relleno but instead of being fried bring stuffed in a taco shell. Their standard fish taco was also yummy but not life altering like the octopus taco.   There are only two other bites of food I've had my entire life that I will never forget. I will always remember my first time with their octopus taco. I feel like I just spent the night with a dream girl, but now I'm waiting in bed trying to plot a way to see her again without seeming desperate.",

It comes on a tostada shell with a seafood mix on top mixed in a tomato based sauce. That sauce is legit.  If you come on Monday or Tuesdays the fish tacos are only 2.50 and you can ask for it either battered or grilled. The size of tacos are decently sized too, not those small 2 bite tacos.  People that like spicy stuff you can also ask for the homemade habanero sauce, it's not really spicy but it taste so good on the tacos.",

    "text": "I had just flown in from the East Coast and as soon as I checked into my hotel room, I did a Yelp search for seafood. Bajamar came up, but not really what I had in mind. I was looking for an all-you-can-eat seafood buffet, however the 5-star reviews of Bajamar quickly dashed my buffet idea out the window.   The location is north of the strip with plenty of free parking right in front of the restaurant. As soon as I opened the door, this super friendly man (Manny was his name) greeted me. I knew what I wanted, but I also wanted Manny's opinion. I was curious about this Horchata drink, and he said I would love it. It's made with rice that's been soaked overnight, then blended, then strained, then added with evaporated milk, vanilla, and cinnamon.....and Voila! You get this refreshing non-alcoholic drink! So good I had 2 jars.   Then I asked him what his favorite taco was: Pulpo Enchilado. Great!! That's what I wanted to get anyway, Manny! It's this taco filled with huge chunks of sauteed octopus, red cabbage, salsa, Monterey Jack cheese, then sprinkled with this potent Mexican chili pepper. I greedily ordered 3 of these tacos, as Manny's eyes widened. So I asked him, \"Do you think that's enough? Should I order an appetizer too?\" He said, \"No that should be more than enough for you.\" :-) Okay then.  Food came. Wow. Never had I enjoyed tacos as much as I did that day. Every bite was Mmm Mmm good. I was a total mess! But most Mmm Mmm moments are usually messy. I managed to eat all 3 with the same gusto as that first initial bite. All wonderfully filled with tender octopus, seasoned just right.   After my over indulgence, I chatted a bit with Manny. Come to find out, he is the co-owner of this restaurant. No wonder he takes such great care & appreciation toward his customers. The other owner is the man who makes all of these delicious food in the kitchen. The pair are originally from Tijuana, then moved to San Diego, and have now settled in Las Vegas. It's not the best neighborhood in Vegas, but sometimes you find hidden gems in places like this. Bajamar won 2018 Best Tacos From The Sea by the Las Vegas Weekly. I can't help but think that this is really what makes America great, isn't it? Achieving a lifetime dream and working hard to maintain that dream, no matter where you come from. Manny, thank you so much for your hospitality. Wishing you and your partner much success!",

This would have been just fine if the food was delicious, but unfortunately, it wasn't. I ordered two tacos: Bajamar Fish Taco and Carne Asada. The carne asade taco had very little flavor. Hoping I had saved the best for last, I dug into the fish taco, but alas, it was soggy and had little flavor as well. I was disappointed, as I am usually super stoked about these little dives in the downtown area. Based on the other reviews of Bajamar, my opinion seems to be in the minority, so maybe I just caught them on a bad day. Sadly, I probably won't be going back to find out.",

I ordered a Bajamar grilled fish taco and a spicy shrimp taco and both were so flavorful and delicious.  The seafood is super fresh and the sauces I tried complemented the seafood so well.  I can't wait to come back now to try their ceviche tostadas!  Come check them out if you're craving some legit fish tacos!!!",

I was a little thrown off by the prices because I'm not used to seeing $4-6 PER taco but they were huge!!! Definitely worth the price, plus you're getting good seafood and meat quality. I had the fried spicy octopus taco and I loved it.?The surf and turf fries were also delicious. I also had something interesting called the \"tsunami tostada\" which was composed of shrimp ceviche, sashimi style fish, octopus in a soy sauce based lime juice with some green garnishes and it was good!!  Definitely a nice local place to try when you're in Vegas and craving Mexican seafood tacos !",

    "text": "I was visiting my sister in Vegas and she was looking on Yelp for a taco joint nearby after we had our spa day and she ran into this Bajamar Seafood & Tacos. She saw that it was rated 5 stars. Since it was taco tuesdays we wanted to check this place out.   As we pulled up to a small corner area it is a little bar close to the kitchen. It was blue inside and most of the sitting is by the window which is pretty nice. When we went in it was not that busy since it was the end of the lunch rush hour for most people.   We were greeted with the menu and two mason jar waters. The tacos were cheap as they had the special for $2.50 on fish tacos. We ordered the Raw Shrimp Ceviche Tostada, fish tacos and seafood tacos. They came out pretty fast even though it was made to order. Some places take awhile but this was fast!  The tacos were delish!!! I would definitely recommend anyone to try and check this place out if you're visiting Vegas or even a local Vegas resident who wants awesome tacos! I would definitely come back here again for sure!",

The chips and guacamole where a no go, the chips were cold and not fresh, the guacamole had zero flavor and the about was a bout a table spoon of guacamole with about half a handful of chips and this was what you get for $7.99 totally not worth it. I ordered a kids meal And the kids meal was bigger than everything I ordered lol nothing special just a quesadilla and fries $5 not bad. The food is good kind of like rubios good but way overpriced.",

While staying in the hotel I jumped on Yelp to see what restaurants were close. I only like to pick ones that are 4 stars or higher for the reviews. Bajamar got high reviews and it was close and the pictures of the food looked amazing. It did not disappoint. DELICIOUS food and friendly and efficient staff. We plan on going back here again before leaving Vegas.",

When walking in, the restaurant is modern and clean. ZERO fish smell which is incredible given the entire menu is seafood. We were greeted immediately, and food and drinks came out very quickly.   I had a shrimp taco and pulpo taco and shared a shrimp cocktail as well. When I ordered it I had no idea pulpo was octopus but let me tell you it was the most tender octopus I've ever had and was a flavor explosion! The tortillas were cooked perfectly so they actually held up against the yummy sauces on the tacos and were soft and crispy at the same time.   I can't wait until I'm back in the neighborhood to visit again!",

I got the Lucas taco and all I can say is that the reviews at this place are not misleading ....if you're into seafood and tacos then don't hesitate.  The refried beans here are so freakin good I couldn't tell what they put in there but I'm a man who eats beans alot of beans in fact they account for about 50% of my protein and the beans here are EASILY the best beans I've ever had in my life they are AMAZING! The wife and I couldn't believe that we had never heard of this place until recently and were so happy to find out they are opening a second location right down the street from our house in the Blue Diamond/Durango area.  The server lady was cool af and even recommended a few places in San Diego for us to try since that's where their family was from. Great job to the staff and we will be back for sure!",

There's a little bit of heat to them but the octopus is cooked perfectly every time--none of that chewy overcooked mumbo-jumbo.   I usually order the house-made hibiscus lemonade to help balance out the intense flavors of the pulpo. The beverage is refreshing, delicious and just the right touch of sweetness.  To sum it up, this place is awesome. The service is on point and the food is what the kids call nowadays, FIREEEEE!!!",

It took me a bit to find this place but it was worth the stupid turns google maps gave me.  Made me drive in circles.  But mannn ohh mannnn.... so worth it.  I would do it all over again actually.   My favorite was the Lucas Taco.  That sucker is heaven.  A cheesy Chile with shrimp and cabbage with some bomb sauce, oh my my myyyyy.   I also ordered a battered fish taco, well, because you must always order one when you're at a seafood taco spot.  Annnddd, andddd.... it was just as delicious but still my favorite ... was the Lucas Taco.  I ordered a Chelada to wash all that yumminess down and  It was a perfect fit.  So refreshing and it complimented the dishes perfectly.  Now, we also ordered 2 tostadas.  A shrimp ceviche and and the fish in aqua Chile.  If you like spice with some major mouth watering lemon action.... I say go for it.  You will not regret it.  We asked for extra tostada because they place a mountain of all that goodness in one perfectly toasted tortilla.  Ask for extra to scoop up all the extra goodness.     Stop by, order yourself some bomb food and leave with a huge smile on your face and you'll probably be back later for more because it's that good.  Thank me later.   Salud!",

    "text": "Sadly our follow up visit was a flop. The carne Asada taco was unrecognizable. It was over cooked, stew like and grey with a dollop of guacamole. Where is the sear on the meat? Where is the bold seasoning? Fresh avocado slices? Pico? I have literally told everyone that this was hands down the best carne taco I've ever had and this was not that. Kinda of gross to be honest. I hope everyone I've told to go there got the good version because what we got was not ok.   On this occasion, everything was served very fast which differed from before. It all seemed thrown together. Flavors were just ok and not developed. Seafood did get the full acid cooked textures. The raw shrimp in the Tsunami was slimy, mushy and grey. Not edible.  Bajamar fish taco was ok. Aquachile green was the best thing today and still average at best. The fried piece fish was cold but at least the flavor was ok.   The whole visit was disappointing and not worth the uber drive to and from our hotel on this particular day. This Definitely was a different staff and cook then before. Consistency is key and they did not meet up with our expectations. We haven't given up hope though . We plan to revisit Bajamar for a redemption visit. You were our number 1 vegas choice and we need you to get it together!!!",

The inside is pretty tiny, maybe 4 tables and a bar area so I'd imagine the weekends get packed.   On my first visit we asked the waitress for her favorite and she recommended the octopus taco. I had one of those along with a spicy shrimp taco. Both were AMAZING! The spicy mayo sauce was the best part & the seafood was very fresh. I could literally eat this every day. The tacos are a bit better than street taco size so 2-3 is plenty.   Their menu also features tostadas and seafood soups. I can't wait to come back and try more. A must visit for any seafood lover!",

I ordered the spicy shrimp tacos (server recommendation) and a shrimp tostada (because I saw an amazing looking pic of it on here). I specifically  ordered the shrimp tostada because a picture of it on here showed that it is loaded with avocado on top.   1st, unfortunately the bottom of the spicy shrimp taco was literally dripping & pooling in grease. The menu description did not say that the tortilla is deep fried or whatever it was, so I was not expecting that. Other then that it tasted a bit chewy but otherwise good though.   2nd, the shrimp tostada did not have any avocado on it (see pic). I asked the server & she spoke to a guy behind the counter. A few minutes later she brought over a small little sauce cup with two little pieces of avocado in it. Total bummer. The shrimp was a cold, also unexpected.  And the sauce tasted like watery ketchup. I basically just picked out the little shrimp pieces and ate the avocado.    The interior is cutely decorated with a surfer vibe.",

    "text": "The 4 and a half star rating is a lot to live up to and charging $4+ per taco makes me grade that much harder but this place exceeded my expectations.   First, best supporting actor goes to the tortillas.   If you've eaten enough tacos (phrasing, boom), you know how a tortilla can get in the way of your enjoyment. Generally, you almost have to move the taco around in your mouth to enjoy it properly (phrasing, boom). But these tortillas were close to perfect. You bite into it and you taste *taco*, you don't taste a dry, mealy tortilla that happens to be holding some tasty veggies and protein. Also I dunno if it's fried or what but it's a soft \"shell\" taco that approaches crispy. It's not quite crispy, but it's right in the edge in a good way.  Back to taco tasting ;)  The surf N Turf taco is a prime example of a lot of ingredients working well together.   I don't tend to enjoy consuming multiple proteins in one bite because it has a tendency to turn into a mush with no distinct flavor. This is not the case here.   I tasted the fried onions, the guac, the juicy carne asada (I was super impressed by how good the meat was. This menu is basically all seafood and I kinda expected meh asada but this was pretty great. Some buddies got the asada by itself and seemed very happy with their choice), and the shrimp.   The skrimp. In a word. Succulent  Plump? Fresh? Flavorful?  Yeah, it's all those things but I think the word Succulent would be written on the trophy I'd award the shrimp in these tacos.   I did surf N Turf and my buddies indicated you can't go wrong with the spicy shrimp.   Random Tip: if you're used to spicy, the spicy won't bother you at all, but don't reach for the hot sauce right away. It's not spicy, but there's a bunch of flavor on it already. The hot sauce in the bottles at the table doesn't make it any spicier and it kinda ruins the taco imo. So at least take a bite before deciding to lay your sauce down (are we still doing phrasing?). For non spicy tacos you're probably good throw some hot sauce on right away.   Breaded v grilled fish taco isn't about health for me. If you actually like the taste of fish, grilled is the way to go. For me, the breading gets in the way of the flavor. I didn't have room to try the marlin or tuna but I heard rave reviews from the ppl in my party who did.   Also...if I may be so bold, spicy octopus is for ppl who actually like octopus. I'm a thin tentacle sort of guy (self-own) meaning calamari is my cephalapod of choice. I saw a lot of positive reviews for the spicy octopus and tried it. It wasn't for me but I've never really liked enjoyed octopus. Once the tentacles get to a certain thickness, I'm out. Next time I'll go for the calamari.   Aqua Fresca limeade is dope if you like lemonade. I do, so three cheers for that.   Now onto the service. I asked way too many ppl to come to dinner. And because these ppl don't quite hate me, a lot showed up. This is a small restaurant. Not a knock. Just fax. In spite of my party being way too large and everybody wanting their own check, the service was fast and they only seemed *kinda* mad at me for bringing way too many ppl to a place that can seat 35 at most.   If your group is down to do a one check per actual table thing, then maybe, Maybe, bring 16 ppl max. But this isn't a bar where you can come in with a huge group and float from table to table blessing your friends and acquaintances with your effervescence.   This is a place ideal for sitting down in one spot, eating food, drinking drink, and, at most, if you have an aisle seat and a voice that carries, talking to a diner in the table next to yours. If you want to bring a Group-group, you're probably better off trying to rent out the place, Mizz* Moneybags (*because I'm suuuuper woke). Keyword: small restaurant.   I probably forgot to say something. I'm tired of writing. I should proofread this.   PARKING! You're better off putting luv it custard in the GPS and parking in that parking lot and walking to Bajamar. They're literally right next to each other. The thing is, if you put bajamar in the GPS, you'll think there's only, like, 3 parking spots but there's actually plenty of parking right behind it.   I'm coming for you, Review of the day.  Also, $1 off the bajamar taco on Tuesdays.",

The calamari chicharron was also very good - calamari battered with chicharron, which I've never had before. The shrimp and surf and turf tacos were great as well.  My only criticisms are: they only have canned/bottled drinks (no fountain) and the location is a little sketchy (I wouldn't feel safe going there alone at night).

Service was good, but a little slow since there was only 2 people working.  We placed our drink and food order at the same time.  I ordered the Shrimp Taco and the Spicy Shrimp Taco.  The tacos were slightly bigger than a street taco so it was filling.  Both tacos were very flavorful, so yummy!  I definitely like the spicy flavor more, it had a nice kick.  The shrimps tasted fresh and the vegetables were crunchy.  I'll definitely try the octopus taco next time.    My boyfriend ordered the Carne Asada Taco and the Surf N Turf Taco.

Those were some big words to live up to, but after finally getting to try, I can confirm the rumors were better than True!  The place is small so expect some kind of wait, but the speed which everyone is running at, everything was done fairly quick. My group of friends ordered an assortment of tacos, and with every first bite followed an exclamation of joy. Every taco was amazing and offered different flavors. My table voted the spicy octopus as top taco, but only after a heated debate and a second round of ordering to confirm.  For the price, speed, and definitely the flavor, Bajamar should be on everyones radar for their lunch break taco fix!",

Delicious food.   Surf and turf lived up to our dreams, but you better believe I'm going to have to run that fish off tomorrow. The quesadilla was simple and great. Julia R was a fan.    The winner at this place is easily the Bajamar grilled fish tacos. Holy fish. You can choose between grilled or fried. Grilled for me. They were perfectly cooked with the secret sauce and fresh diced tomatoes and cabbage like lettuce. They were perfect. I know I'll be dreaming about them for a while.   This place doesn't feel touristy at all, but it's close enough to the strip. It's a great place to kick start your night we ate for under $50 including tip, and we didn't hold back.   I hate to Yelp about best kept secrets. Oh well!",

Some of the best, most tender octopus \"pulpo\" I've ever had. I'll be coming back for that!   Also got the bajamar fish taco and camaron enchilado taco, which had amazing flavor and homemade tortillas.  Horchata $1.50 and delicious.

You have an option to have ayour shrimp raw or cooked. W chose to cooked, and might I say it was amazing!

I couldn't even tell I was eating octopus it all just blended perfectly. Katie enjoyed her flounder tacos too but please try the pulpo tacos you won't regret it. The tortillas are warmed and crisped. The cabbage and mix tastes fresh too. These tacos were so good I recommended them to our Lyft driver. I wish they had a business in NJ.",

But Manny is such a good host, I can't keep quiet anymore. And to see how so many others love this place I have to give the credit. I'm here at least once a week. I love the pulpo( octopus) and marlin (marinated tuna) taco. The only thing is I wish the tacos were served in taco holders because the fillings can make the taco shell a little softer than what I like. And I wish they were open on Sundays!!!!

I order 2 camaron enchilados and I even specify spiciest possible well it wasn't spicy at all. NOTHING!!! The taste was meh I was looking for salt they didnt put on my order and 1 taco look poor with only 3 small shrimps. The pulpo taco was really good in taste but still was missing the spicy salsa. Personally I didnt like the marlin and gobernador taco I wont comment on those since I havent found any marlin tacos that I like here in the US. Cinnamon taste on the horchata was too much. I think they can improve on the flavors and salsas since they have a fresh \"salsa\" that is only tomato, cilantro and onion they should add serrano. I will be going to taste the food over there not delivered. Overall I was really excited since I was hungover I thought it was going to be awesome for that but since nothing was spicy the food didn't help and was a huge disappointing.   The delivery and packing of the food was awesome !",

Great find with great food that is incredibly priced, a great vibe to the joint, and a friendly staff. Manny is the head honcho and is just a really nice guy.   The food is beautiful and tastes as good as it looks, at least what I tried. And sadly, I was flying solo and couldn't try a ton of stuff, but I'll be back to stretch my legs on their menu. There's just too many things that sound too good not to!",

Finished the tacos off with a vanilla-esque Horchata that was also divine and delicious. Truly a hidden gem with a nice chill ambience. Definitely will be coming back!!",

But the owner and server were very polite and didn't seem to mind at all to serve us. We had the surf and turf, the shrimp taco, the fish taco, and the Lucas taco! Omg the fries are to die for! Shrimp is cooked to perfection! Flavors were amazing! All the tacos were great! Excellent portions! So flavorful, and fresh! The horchata is also great! Not overly sweet. Side note, a little weird but the bathroom was extremely clean! Loved the place and to have a bathroom in such clean condition says a lot. Spoke to manny for a little bit and he is super friendly! Please go here! You will not regret it. Little hard to find, but worth it! Would give this place more stars if I could! They're doing it right!",

I walk in and the set up is a little strange the door is by the bar where the kitchen is and then there are tables off to the side but if you sit at the tables the waiter cannot see you so I opted for the bar. They don't sell any form of alcohol but I believe they are going to change that soon.  The menu is one sided but has a good amount of stuff mostly seafood. I got 3 fish tacos ($2.50)and 1 octopus taco ($4)and a side of rice and beans ($2 each) the food came out fast and it tasted very fresh. The fish itself was crisp and very light. The slaw was also crisp and cooling against the chipotle crema. The octopus taco was the bomb tho. It had crispy cheese and spicy octopus with the same vibrant slaw from the fish taco. Just delicious. The rice and beans were a perfect companion for the tacos. The rice was nicely seasoned and the beans were hearty and covered in cheese.  Overall a pleasant place to spend an evening and if you have a craving for seafood tacos this is the place to go.",

My only suggestion is that they should get a couple of different fish varieties instead of  tilapia . Like ono or mahi mahi. A little more variety and this place would 5 Star  !",

I'd rank this little place as one of the best fish taco places we've eaten at...anywhere.  Even the pulpo (octopus) taco I had, normally chewy, was tender and packed with a lot of flavor.  My wife hates cilantro, so we asked Manny if we can order without, no problem, everything they serve is made to order.  Manny was friendly and his service wonderful.  Even switched the TV channel for me so I could watch the Boston/Houston baseball game (he offered).  One thing we'd recommend is to order the tacos lightly toasted so they hold the contents better.  Yes, it's a small place and seating is limited, but it' worth a visit - pretty sure it won't be your only meal there.",

It's very quaint, less than a dozen tables, but not at all crowded or too close. We shared the tsunami tostada and five tacos: Bajamar, lucas, spicy shrimp, gobernador, and surf n turf. It's impossible to have a favorite here. The meats, veggies, sauces, and perfect tortillas were all amazing on everything!! We noted how wonderful the service was and later found out he was an owner! The most friendly, informed, pleasant man- this coming from two people in aspects of the F&B industry for nearly a decade!! Truly a great experience, can't wait for our next visit!!",

    "text": "Bajamar Seafood & Tacos is located at the intersection of E Wyoming Ave (X) S Las Vegas Blvd. If you're travelling north along Las Vegas Blvd and go past the old \"Olympic Gardens\" (aka OG) building, you've gone too far.  The lot has two buildings serving Mexican food. Bajamar is the \"blue building\". The floor plan is like a small diner. The decor is like a lot of Mexican fish taco restaurants, nowadays. However, unlike other fish tacos (which have a really bland taste), Bajamar has chipotle and aioli sauces which give their food a really distinctive taste profile. It's a bold flavor--but not so spicy that it's overwhelming. And I would recommend that you eat your meal on site. The combination of seafood, cabbage, pico de gallo, and sauces create a \"juicy\" taco which can be a bit messy.   Bajamar does have carne asada--but most of the menu is based on seafood. During my visit, I sampled these tacos: spicy octopus; shrimp; \"Gobernador\"; \"marlin\"; and carne asada. All of the tacos that I had were very good. Here a few notes:   Octopus Taco: When overcooked, octopus becomes tough. In this case, the meat was tender.  Shrimp Taco: When ordering the shrimp taco, you have the choice of whole shrimp, grilled or battered. If you order this item, do so because you want fried shrimp. Otherwise, you might as well order the \"Gobernador\" Taco.  Gobernado Taco: This is a shrimp taco--grilled and minced. I prefer this to the \"shrimp taco\" because you're more likely to get shrimp in each bite.  Marlin Taco:  It isn't \"marlin\". Its smoked tuna. But the (lightly) smoked fish provides a unique taste that I haven't found outside of Florida.  Carne Asada Taco: The meat was moist and tender, but still firm enough to allow a little \"chew\". It also wasn't too heavily spiced or salted.   The restaurant has a nice selection of beers in bottles, and on tap; Mexican soft drinks; and blended beverages--such as horchata.  I dropped by for lunch on a Friday, and the place was full. There were tradesmen in their work gear, and people in business attire. Most were locals, but there were tourist as well. I mention this because this section of Las Vegas Blvd is outside of the tourist strip, and is a little rough. It is fine during the day, but I admit the area can feel scary a night. However, if you like fish tacos, you really should give this place a try.  (And if you have room for desert, check out \"Luv-It Frozen Custard\" next door.)",

Head in with my 3 kids. Small quaint place. Not really great for kids who can't sit still( like mine) Hubby ordered tostada mixta, taco de baja mar ( his favorite) pulpo enchilado. Mine taco gobernador and taco se pulpo enchilado.   We both loved our food but my hubby said he's favorite was Baja mar. We also ordered agua de Jamaica or hibiscus. loved it. Great place , fresh food. Owner seems nice but I think my kids were making him nervous. They were tired.  I like the decor was really cute and very pro surferos! Definitely coming back.

I got one grilled .... the staff was friendly with helping me make choices on what else to try I got a pulpo taco and a goberndor taco (not sure if I spelled it correctly) I took mine to go I didn't eat there I also ordered a horchata which was very yummy they make it fresh there which is always nice   My food was made and I was about my way All for under 15$ heyyyyyy   I got home quickly sat down and took a bite of each one each one were so delicious with there own flavors and spices :)   The governdo was probably my favorite one but all of them are equally yummy if your  havnt been to this place you are missing out completely skip the chains and support your local businesses",

Like shrimp wings. It was surprisingly good! Also the Surf & Turf Taco which may be my favorite item there, as well as the Tsunami. You really can't go wrong with any items here and the ambiance gives you a San Diego vibe. I could probably eat here every week, can't wait till they open one on my side of town.",

    "text": "I'm playing catch up with my reviews and really wanted to knock this one off my list first.  Bajamar occupies the old Chinese spot by OG's and Viva las Arepas. I had always wondered who or what was going to take up residency here and I'm glad it's this place!   We came in on a random afternoon during lunch time. There's not a ton of table, but there is a very long, shiny wood bar to sit at too. The place is beautifully redone. We opted for the bar and were immediately greeted by the owner and were given menus and some ice waters. I ordered the shrimp tostada and the tostada mixta, which has shrimp, octopus and fish. My forever partner in crime ordered the fish taco special. We made small talk and found out that the owner is originally from the SD area and that there's only 3 people running the show there.   Our food arrived shortly after and I actually had the restraint to stop and take a few photos beforehand, which is a miracle because I wanted to dive right in. The tostadas were crisp underneath the giant piles of shrimp, octopus and fish. The seafood was incredibly fresh, light and super chunky! Perfect. There's hot sauce available on the table caddy, along with a paper towel roll, s & p. I didn't try the fish tacos, but they looked fantastic and were reported to be delicious as well. Nicely sized pieces of golden fried fish atop corn tortillas and a fresh slaw to finish it off.   We left super satisfied and are looking forward to our next visit in!",

I enjoyed their hibiscus lemonade and 3 of 4 tacos. I loved the shrimp taco, spicy shrimp taco, crispy fish tacos. One of my tacos was wrong, I ordered the smoked marlin (tuna) and received a Smokey pork taco in a red sauce in stead. I'm pescatarian so it wasn't fun biting into this expecting tuna but getting pork. Sadly the sauce was so good I picked out the meat and ate the rest. Wish I hard the tuna  because from the sauce I know it would have been another amazing taco. The corn tortillas are grilled perfectly and served with lime wedges and good hot sauce. We ordered to go for our trip to valley of fire (go here) and I was wishing we had more they were that good!",

There is a small parking lot right in front of Bajamar off Las Vegas Blvd. It can be a bit tight, and a few transients have been sighted, but it makes for a great show when you're having lunch or dinner. I was greeted immediately when I walked in and sat at the bar. I thought about getting food to-go, but a few regulars (yes, they already have them) enticed me to stay and dine. I'm so very glad I did.  I was walked through the menu, which is in English on one side - Spanish on the other, and wanted to try everything. The service was top-notch. Very attentive and I could tell that he sincerely wanted me to have a great experience. I went with the Bajamar Fish Taco and Lucas Taco. Pause here as I take a moment of silence for these tacos.  The Bajamar taco was fresh, battered just enough, and packed with flavor. The Lucas Taco blew my mind. The gentleman sitting next to me recommended it because he has ordered it everyday since they opened. That's commitment!! It did not disappoint. I want to make a baby with that chipotle sauce. They make their own horchata and it was amazing. I'm not an expert, but it was creamy, not too sweet. I loved it.   I took a chance and ordered the cheesecake to go. This was more of a 3-star cheesecake and wasn't decorated with fruit or any type of sauce like I was expecting based on other photos. I had one bite at home, tossed the rest. I might give it one more chance during my next trip, but only because I love cheesecake so much. It will be better for my belly if I don't like it anyway. Plus, more room for Lucas Tacos!!!",

The food is beautiful to look at, scratch made, and very fresh. The Lucas is basically a chile relleno in a tortilla with grilled shrimp on top. The horchata takes two days to make and is very tasty.",

    "text": "This place is fantastic. I usually go to this restaurant about once month to have their amazing tacos and I gotta say that it's definitely the best taco restaurant in Las Vegas. The tacos may seem a bit expensive but they are every bit worth it. They also have special deals on Monday where they have their fish taco half off which is great.   I think the best part of this restaurant is the service. Every time I come here I am always greeted by Manny who is one of the waiters. He is extremely friendly and always recognizes us when we walk through the door. If you go to Bajamar you will most likely see this guy working his butt while talking with multiple customers. One time I was eating at Bajamar when Manny noticed an single unfinished taco on my plate. Knowing that I usually finish my tacos without an issues, he asks there was any wrong. This being the first time I tried that particular taco, I told him that I didn't like that taco. Manny, being the cool guy that he is, asks me why and then offers to take that taco off of my check. He is a very cool guy. When you come to Bajamar you are guaranteed the best service!  Pulpo taco 10/10. This place is bliss!",

I've tried them all here but my favorites are the \"Camaron Enchilado\" and the \"Pulpo\".  Sports on the TV and draft beer on tap.   Manny is the owner, he's great!

We've been here twice and everything tastes fresh and just like the first time we been there.  Not only is the food amazing but the service is 120%.

They'll pretty do whatever they can to modify and make you happy and it's delicious.

Next we had the Chicharron de Pulpo - I would say don't bother ordering this.  Next we had Camaron Enchilado Taco- Sauteed shrimp with chile de arbol, Monterey cheese, red cabbage and salsa fresca. These were very good and a must when eating here. Also has the Pulpo Enchilado  which were good, but the pulpo  was not as great.  The Marlin Taco was good, but again nothing out of this world  and the Lucas taco has potential as the grilled California pepper added some good texture and flavor but it need a little more flavor. All in all this place is good and worth checking out.  They don't serve beer as of now or any other alcohol.",

I was wary to try at first, but after some friends recommended I had to try. I'm glad I did. I didn't try a thing that I didn't like. And the hibiscus lemonade is delicious. I'll be sure to try the horchata next time.   The decor in here is nice. The spot is small but packs a mighty punch. This needs to be in your taco rotation. And the prices are excellent.

Limited to fish tacos, tostada's, and seafood entrees, Bajamar distinguishes itself from other local establishments with fresh, well prepared fish and ingredients.   I have been there twice and will work this into my lunch routine. The tacos are reasonably priced between 4-6 dollars each and two will fill most people up.",

    "text": "Manny and his crew are super friendly and accommodating.  My boys and I were visiting from CA this past weekend and we ran across this place and decided to try.  We asked Manny what was the best menu item and he recommended the Pulpo or Octopus.  We didn't go for it and ordered everything from shrimp to carne asada.  We also ordered a few appetizers and were pleasantly surprised.  When the rest of our tacos came we quickly devoured them and they were fresh, crisp and delicious.  We then knew if the rest of the tacos were that good, we should try the octopus.  4 of us ordered the octopus and they were so good.  The octopus was tender and the accompanying sauce and trimmings just melt in your mouth.  These are the best seafood tacos in Vegas.  We ended up eating here everyday of our trip and making good friends with Manny and his crew.",

After a lovely celebration at the Graceland Chapel where we celebrated renewal of our friends vows we toasted with amazing micheldas, fresh guacamole and mouthwatering tacos. If you haven't stopped by it's a must. Not a ton of seating, but wait staff is attentive, has great customer service and is kid friendly. We even tried to go two days in a row but weren't able to get a seat in time with our travel plans!",

    "text": "Fish tacos are PERFECTION! Best fish tacos I have ever had. All of the ingredients are fresh and the fish, although battered, is not super oily.   The octopus tacos were delicious as well. The sauce they marinade them in is really tasty, however it does make the tortillas a little messy and soggy.   Marlin tacos (a la brasa) were our least favorite. They cook it in a tomato sauce that was just a little overwhelming. Not terrible, but not great either.",
