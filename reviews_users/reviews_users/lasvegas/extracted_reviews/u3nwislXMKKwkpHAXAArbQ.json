The service here is OK, typical asian resaurant lolz  but the food is yummmmmmmy!!         I was here last week with the family, I Ordered the mandarin pork chop for the kids, geez they killed it haha it was that good! For myself I had cold jellyfish with hot sauce on top( yummy) and fried pork intestine for appetizer, it was very delicious. And for themain course I ordered half roast duck, salt n pepper crab, steam red rock cod fish  and west lake soup. Every item we ordered was cook perfectly in fact there was no left over to take home haha. I've been following kj kitchen for over a decade when the owner use to own a similar restaurant call FOOD EXPRESS in north las vegas until he branch out and open KJ in chinatown. I prefer coming to kj during the weekday cause weekends can be very hectic here and especially holidays, I hate waiting no matter how great the food are.",

In fact, I even remember when it first opened, it was a small dim sum restaurant! That didn't work out so well, so then it changed owners and/or management and became the KJ Kitchen we all know and love today.  It's authentic Hong Kong cuisine at great prices, especially their lunch specials. I've never had a dish i didn't like at KJ, but here's a list of my favorites:  -Salted fish and diced chicken fried rice -Pan fried noodle with shredded pork -Seafood with bean curd clay-pot -Salt and pepper pork chops -Salt and pepper squid -Deep fried flounder  Great for lunch and dinner, the only downside is the size of the place. During the lunch and dinner rush, every table is full so you might have to wait, especially large groups. And don't even get me started on the parking lot, it's tiny!",

My family does routine family outings to our favorite spots depending on whose birthday it is and usually Kjs is picked by 2 or 3 members of our family. So we start off with my dad's favorite soup. Sizzling rice soup. Octopus, fish filet, shrimps and scallops in a light broth with crisped rice added on top. Pretty good. Then we get the crispy noodle chow mein with shrimp. Salt and pepper pork chops are amazing. My brother gets a half fried chicken, combo fried rice. I try to get the xo green beans and beef with American broccoli. The shrimps with candied walnuts are my wife and dad's favorite. And my son loves everything we put on his plate. Great authentic Chinese and the people who work there know us and treat us really nicely. Be nice people, tip well and people will treat you nice back.",

But if I can get preferential treatment without having to speak in Cantonese I'm happy.  Based on first impression the attentiveness already seemed better than at HK Star.   How can I forget the smell the grease on the walls.  Agh!  This may not be a fair review since we didn't order any entrees.  Seafood dishes are usually how I measure great cantonese/hk style food.  Me and Andy T. had a late night snack and shared the Salted Fish and Chicken Fried Rice which was good.  I've had this served casserole style and the traditional way and some chinese restaurants don't even have this on their regular menu.  I suppose it's the in-n-out secret menu of fried rice at certain places.  Overall, 3 stars for now.  I would come back again because I think if you ordered the right things here, there's room for improvement.",

I grew up in LA and that's just how it is- sometimes the ruder the service the better the food. They just want to turnover the tables. That being said, my parents are the pickiest Chinese parents and they give this place their stamp of approval. They have tried many different Chinese restaurants here in Vegas and we always come back to KJ because their food is the best in town. Hands down! It's consistent for me, when I feel homesick and want some good Chinese food, KJ is my go to! Make sure to come with at least 4 people so you can get the free (yummy!) half chicken when you order 4 dishes. Also comes with free soup. Can't go wrong!",

Doesn't a restaurant want their customers to order one of the market price entrees? I guess not.   While I was ordering, he seemed annoyed, snooty (lol, ok Mr. waiter) and rushed me while taking my order. I know I shouldn't expect much from a Chinese restaurant but there are other Chinese restaurants with decent service. The food was average. I'm glad I didn't get impressed with their food. Yup.

We arrived at 7 PM and were seated pretty quickly within 10 minutes. Our server came by promptly and took our order of about 10 dishes, including appetizer soup and entrees. And then we waited.....  I checked with the server on our order at 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 40 minutes, and 50 minutes. We were getting the \"it's coming\" and \"they know\" run-around answer. He even dared to say \"it's the new computer system we have, you just have to wait.\" At over one hour since we ordered, I finally asked for the supervisor. She actually went to the kitchen (unlike the server) and had our rushed. At 8:15 PM, we finally received our appetizer. We were never given an explanation or even a simple apology. Unfortunately, the good food and cheap prices does not compensate for the horrible staff at this restaurant. I will never go to this restaurant again.",

The service - I know I was in a real cantonese place because of the service. I would have to classify it as indifferent efficiency.  However, that being said, I wanted to order something not on the menu and worked with them and they had it and they asked me if it was the way I liked it. Also it was not too busy.  c.  The FOOD -  - You know you are in the right place when at the front door is a large fish tank with dozens of rock cod in the tank and also another tank with huge geoduck in it.  Yeah baby.  Let's get ready to rock it.  - Rock Cod steamed - This s essentially a key fish in cantonese cuisine, at least in my book.  The rock cod themselves have rather large bones and is perfect to steam. The meat is just the right texture and when you add the scallion, oil and soy sauce, the smell, the taste, the natural sauce, it is absolutely the best.  - Bitter Melon with spare ribs in black bean sauce - Now listen here all, you know you are in a great place if they serve bitter melon. How many people would normally order bitter melon.  If this was served at Panda, it would never be sold. but here, my goodness, it was great. The melon was just right, firm, not crunchy. The black bean sauce was just the right amount ant the ribs were cut to about an inch or so and was perfect!  When I first moved to LV, I could not find this at any Chinese restaurant so I learned how to make it and at KJ, I love it!  - Steamed Chicken with Scallion and Ginger - Now I did not see this on their menu, and they had similar items that were fried, but I needed mine the authentic steamed method. I asked the waitress if they had this after I attempted to describe it and she knew exactly what I wanted and they brought it out.  The half chicken order was perfect. Tons of shredded scallion on top of the chicken that had a very thin layer of skin which means, awesome tasting proper chicken baby!  Yep, the best chicken for this is the not so thick and meaty chicken, but the bony rather emaciated chicken that have a wonderful taste. This dish was just perfect and I had to have extra ginger sauce as it was so good.   d.  Overall - You know you are in a really authentic Cantonese restaurant when you see the following:  - The Shovel Method - Yep, that is right.  You shovel the rice from a bowl into your mouth with chopsticks. You do NOT try to pick the rice up, you are NOT dainty, you are NOT polite.  You SHOVEL the morsels of rice into your mouth.  By the way, no soy sauce on the rice.  When you are eating Cantonese style, you are putting the food in your plate or your rice bowl and the fragrant and tasty juices of the dishes are absorbed by your rice. Much tastier than soy sauce.  - The Boney Plates.  Yeah, not \"china\" plates but BONEY plates. Yep, True Cantonese people love their meats on the bone.  The bonier the better.  You will hear some sucking and some crunching, gnawing and jawing, however, the best visual is a plate piled with bones stripped clean like a piranha attacked it!  - Oh yeah, no silverware.  Come on.  How can anyone eat Cantonese with a fork and knife is beyond me.  BTW, isn't it funny to see so many people at other restaurants eating Chinese food on an american style plate trying to use a chopstick?   I use silverware when eating in Chinese restaurants that do not have bowls.  Shovel method.  That is the way to go!  GK says, check this place out. If you see someone making a ton of noise and gushing all over the bones on his plate.  Check him out. That could be ME!",

    "text": "I had lunch with my BFF Lily L. and her mother a couple weeks ago. I was really excited to hear that this was her family's favorite Chinese restaurant, not knowing that she makes it a point to dine here every time she's in Vegas!  Of course, I left all the ordering to Lily and her mom and they picked their favorites. We had Steamed Fish, Tofu with Bamboo Fungus and Chinese Broccoli, Salt and Pepper Squid, and Steamed Fish in Black Bean Sauce. Everything was really delicious!  I'm not sure what type of fish was used in our dishes (the menus are not very descriptive in English and there was a lot of Mandarin flying around), but it may have been catfish and sole according to Lily's mom. They were both tasty and picked up the sauces really well. The S&P squid was not my favorite rendition of this favorite dish, but still tasty. Now, the tofu dish really surprised me. I normally dislike fried tofu because it's dry and just gross, however, this tofu was perfectly fried with an insanely creamy texture inside! That paired with the sauce, Chinese broccoli, and bamboo fungus, major YUM! **Side note: the menu says bamboo, but that's deceiving. It's actually a type of mushroom called Bamboo Fungus. Rich in protein, dietary fiber, and carbohydrates; also used in Chinese medicine (thank you Wikipedia). Very interesting specimen!**  During lunch, prices are very, very reasonable. A bargain. Also, if you dine with 4+ people for dinner, you're given a complimentary roasted chicken! If that isn't incentive enough to dine here! The service was just okay. We finished all our food before we received our final dish that was ordered at the same time as the others and forget water refills. They were really overwhelmed and apparently there was only 1-2 cooks with an almost full dining room. Fortunately, the food and prices will bring me back and hopefully they aren't as busy.",

Their vegetables are delicious and don't even get me started with their whole duck! It is so yummy, it is good for multiple meals or for a family of four and even then you are still left with leftovers! The sauce the duck comes with is nice, it is spicy and sweet. For a whole duck it is $23 which is such a reasonable price for me and definitely worth it, because it so delicious! It is a must try!   All their other entrees are great as well, their sweet and sour chicken, orange chicken, Kung pao chicken, and house special beef are the ones I have tried so far.  The egg drop soup and fried rice are good as well and they are all at a very reasonable price!  The staff is always in a rush because they are so busy and packed with customers all the time, but they always tend to your needs. Some of the times I order to go and it's always ready on time and the flavor of their food is always consistent. This place is definitely my go-to place for authentic American-Chinese food.",

    "text": "This is a local's favorite Chinese seafood restaurant located in the outskirts of Vegas Chinatown.  It's in a strip mall close to McDonald's and KFC about a mile past Decatur on Spring Mountain Road (which was how we were told by the Chinese dealer who recommended it).  The decor is no nonsense, with crowded tables placed next to each other and a fish tank full of lobster, crab, and some fish.  We noticed they do offer bbq duck as well but none were out on display so they're either hanging in the kitchen or from somewhere else.  We were quickly seated but weren't given menus for another 5 minutes and had to flag down someone and ask.  Not sure if this was an oversight or if they didn't have enough menus, but we didn't notice anywhere to pick them up ourselves except for the takeout ones.    We ordered the house crab (per the dealer recommendation), the fried flounder for $5.95, and the pepper beef.  Wait, let me reiterate that - a whole fresh fried or steamed, meaty delicious flounder for $6 in the middle of the desert for under $6.  Win!!!!  The crab was excellent and inexpensive (I think it was about $15), similar to anything you'd find in Alhambra. It came out fast and was surprisingly moist and very crunchy.  The food turned out to be right on the mark, just as the dealer said.  The only thing was that we didn't get any soup, which was posted on the lunch menu that we ordered from.  It wasn't a big deal, though, and we never asked about it.  The place was clean and somewhat busy especially for a late afternoon and so far away from the main Chinatown area.  I would definitely come back next time, it's a great find!  Service, however, was a little slow to refill out water and get us our menus.  There was only about 2 waiters working and 1 busboy I think for the whole place during lunch so it's understandable.",

This is a pretty big restaurant and a lot of people frequent this establishment. I saw a lot of Chinese patrons eating here which is definitely a good sign.  Our party ordered the following: -Shrimp with Lobster Sauce ($12) -Sweet and Sour Pork ($8) -Lo-Mein House Special ($9) -Beef with Chinese Broccoli ($8)  The food was descent for the prices. I did find the food to be super greasy. I needed to drink a lot of water and green tea to coat the stomach. The portions were generous and we had leftovers, which we couldn't bring with us.   Service was good and attentive, and by the time we left, there was a line out the door.   This place was far from the strip. So if you feel like local Asian food, come to Chinatown.",

Promptly at 11 am we tried going in but the door was locked. They finally opened at 11:10 am. The Chinese waitress provided menus and hot tea. You could hear the scurrying of staff trying to prep in the kitchen. It was not until 11:30 am did the waitress approach us to take our order. I ordered my two favorites: Beef rib & Bitter Melon w Black Bean Sauce; Fried Bean Curd Sichuan Style and steamed rice.  The food arrived and compared to past lunches it was absolutely minuscule in amount. What's worse it was almost tasteless and lacking in typical KJ seasoning. So for the first time ever at KJ I asked for soy sauce & chili sauce to make my food palatable... When we got there I noticed three Chinese servers and two non-Chinese staff go into the kitchen two cook...So sad. I won't be back.",

And, think about it, who better to know the best Chinese food? =)  I eat here way too often. LOL I almost always do take-out, and the portions are large. Everything is always cooked to perfection. I've never once been disappointed with the quality of any dish I ordered which can be rare at any restaurants. I love everything from the Chinese Broccoli w/ garlic, (try Ong Choy w/ garlic \"Chinese spinach\" when in season!!!), green beans w/ garlic and pork, salt and pepper shrimp without shell, hong kong style chow mein with extra crispy noodles(you have to specify that), Singapore noodles, salt and pepper pork chops, house fried rice, fried tofu, and the list could go on.   My ultimate favorite restaurant PERIOD! The only complaints I would ever have is the fishtank at the entrance which houses some freaky, dead looking fish wigs me out every time. But, it's a culture difference. Also, I'm such a regular, but I am always treated as if I were a stranger. I see the same two fellows. But there's not an ounce of recognition which makes me feel a little disheartened. It could be language barrier, but a smile would be nice, or a \"Welcome back.\" Not the freindliest guys for sure. The service is standard. But who cares about that sensitive crud when the food is like heaven on Earth, right?! Cuz seriously I'm there at least 3 times a month for the past few years. I wish they stayed open later than 2am as well. I get off work at 1am, and sometimes have to settle for the \"lessers\" like Cathay House and Joyful House which are second to KJ!",

However, their service is not what they are known for. Also, their portions are a bit on the stingy side.  My family recently ordered their black bean fish filet.  The flavoring was good, but the fish was not fresh and there was very little fish/ there was more onions and green bellpepper then fish.  We were dissapointed with the garlic snow pea shoot, which was about $12/ plate because the snow peas shoots were too old. A month ago, we wanted to order two types of tofu.  The waiter didn't even bother to tell us that what we ordered will look exactly the same - fried tofu on a glass plate with pumpkin on top & fried tofu with ChoiSum vege.  The tofu was dissapointing (if you like tofu, try the homemade tofu at the Cathyhouse instead). Anyway, I don't think management really cares about the quality of their dishes since they business is so good. YK",

So my expectation may be different from a lot of Las Vegas locals.   Average 4 stars? Where did that come from? The food here is mediocre at best  - in fact it would be considered bad quality if you are one who's used to San Francisco area restaurants, but I assume there's just not much reasonable Chinese food there in Vegas - though I have to say I am disappointed as there seem to be a lot of Chinese restaurants as I drive around so I would think that there's some competition - it really got me wonder if the other Chinese restaurants are even edible.  For example, the boiled chicken we got was a disaster. I have never seen boiled chicken that stale, and it's obviously microwaved, with a 'pool' of yellowish oily water on the plate. Never, ever, had I seen that in any Chinese restaurant in my life.   Fried string bean - boy, did they use oil from 10 years old to cook it?  Or perhaps we were just unlucky that day.   Service is attentive though - the waitress in there really did try her best.",

Crispy fried chicken -- fried fresh as it did take a while but alas they overcooked it so it was a bit dry  Crispy fried salt and pepper shrimp -- OK, pretty standard  Stir fried (no, didn't have all deep fried dishes) pea pod chutes with garlic  -- OK, could use a bit more salt and less oil  These 3 dishes = ~$35  Service was slow, especially considering the fact the restaurant was rather empty.  Decor is very basic - slightly better than your hole in the wall Chinese place.  Unfortunately the fish tanks were most empty except for lobster (which the table next to us had and it looked fine at least -- $8 a pound said the waiter).  It's open late which is great, but overall just average.  Caveat -- I am a bit picky when it comes to Hong Kong style Chinese food",

We come here almost once a week since my mom loves the garlic salt and pepper (Bei Fung Tong) crab not to be mistaken for the salt and pepper crab (which is also good). The ginger and scallions lobster is good too! As of course is the fresh steamed fish with soy sauce.  If you like fish, for less than approximately 1/7 of the price of the fresh (swimming) fish, order the sea bass tofu clay pot. The fish is lightly fried and stewed in clay pot. This is my favorite dish. My other new discovery thanks to my less adventurous nephew is the fried chicken. Mmmm...fried chicken.  They offer a lot of specials known only to locals, like cheaper lobster between 3-5pm and late night happy hour on food. You also get a free steamed chicken if you order the crab and have more than 4 people eating.",

I believe the owner was counting money at the cashier, and the waiter still had the balls to threw anything at a customer.   In this economy, any restaurant should be bending over backward to make the dining a nice experience so they'll return for more. Not this mother f&*(r, sorry excuse for a waiter.

But for those like me who visit Las Vegas from time to time, this is a hidden gem in the heart of Las Vegas. The one thing, they might need to work on is a bigger bathroom and maybe a little re-model inside. But, the food is mamma-mia good! Another few things that might need to be worked on is dessert options, and maybe have Thai Ice Tea or Milk Ice Tea? That would give options for us who just want to drink something other than tea? Yet, this restaurant hasn't steered us wrong yet. I think the favorite dish of mine is the frog legs. My dad loves the beef with bitter melon. All this restaurant needs is to re-vamp itself with some renovations or remodeling. Otherwise, food is great. I would definitely order the frog legs, sweet and sour pork, and steamed rice. Don't order water, order tea! the best thing about a chinese restaurant is its tea. Although they do not serve dim sum, this is definitely a great place if you need some really good Chinese Food. Keep up the good work you guys!",

The place isn't a 5 star decor like the celebrity TV chefs that populate the strip &  and most strip hotel restaurants but defiantly a clean inviting practical casual HK dining with a friendly staff & chef  that opens up a can of whips ass on LV strip hotel chefs let alone ones where I live.... I must say I have had lost of HK food in past 8 years at many places in SF area (see Yelp) but this is undoubtedly the best dinner ever!  Wish we had one by home......  We had....House soup, Lobster Green Onion Ginger dish, Salt & Pepper Pork & Prawns. Eggplant Clay pot, Deep-fried Flounder (filleted and presented brilliantly) Beef Noodle w/beef, Peas Sprouts and white rice....  Wow... Yum Yum....  Don't be late line can get long......",

If you are ever in The City, try Canton on Folsom for my lowest acceptable standard on the Greasy spoon, great food! Or Tong Kiang for quality and clean class on the authentic tip. Would go back to KJ only if somebody took me there, late at night.",

    "text": "I ordered the fried marinated chicken, which is basically crispy chicken and a shrimp hong kong style chow mien.    Both were great and tasty.  The chicken was perfectly fried and wasn't too oily.  The chow mein was also very good.  The noodles were crispy, but softened with the gravy.  The gravy was lighter tasting than I usually find but was still great.    The only complaint I have is that they only have 1 type of hong kong style/pan fried chow mein on their menu; shrimp.  It was 7.50 which is a reasonable price.  However, when I asked if they would do house instead of only shrimp the price shot up to 10 dollars. =/  I won't pay 10 dollars for chow mein.    They did redeem themselves when I opened up my bag and found a half pint of white rice thrown in.  Thank you for thinking about my chicken needing rice and thank you for not charging me like most other places do.  The next time I'm in Vegas I'm heading here to get yummy, authentic Chinese food.",

I do like the green beans, salty fish fried rice and some lettuce wrap thing I ate. This time around they forgot my chicken wings but I ate so much it didn't matter.

Everyone had a delicious lunch. The wait staff was great. The manager gave our table of 8 the soup special on the house which was unexpected but a great way to sample the soup. Parking is a little dicey since the lot is shared with so many other businesses. We all said that we would return for lunch or dinner. The place to go for the best Chinese food.",

    "text": "So this KJ on Spring Mountain Rd is owned by the same peeps from KJ at Rio.  The place is about the same as med-size restaurant, not suited for Chinese parties.  They have a variety of seafood in their seafood tanks near the entrance.  We got here late at night, I guess they do not have any late night specials here either.  The price seems cheaper than their Rio location.  We got some Crab Fish Belly Soup, Egg Tofu, Egg White Bean Sprout, Oyster Pot, Roasted Duck, and Bean Sauce Sea Bass.  The duck was a bit old, probably due to late at night.  Sea Bass tasted excellent and Oyster was delicious.  The Egg Tofu came from a store and they do not claim to be homemade like many places.  Everything else was above average for Vegas.  Service was provided by the typical Asian poker face servers, always seems to be mad about something.  Overall, food is about the same as KJ at Rio, price seems to be better here, but location is less convenience if you are staying at the Strip.",

We had to asked  for water, we had to asked for white rice & hot tea.       For about 10 to 11 people per one table the portions were very small!! And they have the audacity to charged us 18% gratuity!! At the time we made the reservations they said they were going to hire extra help. We had to wait for Water, we had to wait for white rice, I don't know why I had to wait for a long, long time!! My suggestion is order off the menu do not order off the banquet at $238.       I think I would have gotten more food from ordering off the menu. I'm still very mad at this Restaurant's lousy service and they wanted 18% gratuity!!       I hope and pray they'll improved their services!!      I'm just so disappointed with this restaurant after spending over $1200!!  My tips for four tables were over $172.00!! It's insane amount of money for lousy service & small portions!!",

This is my husband's go to place for Chinese food (he is the foreigner, and I am Chinese). Dinner time complimentary starter soup is different daily and the best. Not because it is free, it is nutritious and medicinal as Cantonese people really emphasizes utilizing food materials to accommodate your body to different environmental toxins. Not only that, they also have a complimentary desert/congee after dinner. Free is bonus.  Recommendations from the menu: the husband (Jewish ) chooses Salt and Pepper Pork Chops, Pork Intestine Clay Pot and String Bean XO Sauce. Me being Chinese but not Cantonese, I would recommend the goose intestine, any ginger scallion steamed whole fish or sea bass in black bean sauce. Snow pea sprouts with garlic and empresses' chicken are also light and delicious.",

We were renting a place near here and I'm so glad we went with KJ Kitchen -- the food was delicious, really well priced, and they were super patient while I ordered like fifty things off the menu even with customizations (\"no onions plz\", \"make sure this is vegetarian\", etc -- bonus, they got all of it correct!!).  My favs were definitely the honey walnut shrimp, the roast duck, string beans in XO sauce, and clams in black bean sauce. Also, I splurged (it was a birthday trip!) and got the egg yolk golden crab... holy crap so worth it. Omg just thinking about it I wish I could go back and order this again. (Lucky for me, the others in the group didn't want to deal with shelling a crab soaked in egg sauce so I basically ate the entire dish!!)  Anyway, five stars fo sho, thanks for the great service and for sating the angry mob of hungry climbers!!",

Service is not the most attentive but genuine and polite, food is fresh and great.  Menu is extensive and a bit more expensive than you might expect- but the quality is the reason why. Also, portions are enormous. Many seafood dishes including sea cucumber, lobster, and crab. Some dim sum-like items on the appetizer menu, including my favorite fried shrimp balls, but here they go for larger portions with a justifiably higher price tag (order of 8 for $13).  Getting a few dishes to share family-style is the way to go here: Szechuan scallops are stir fried with onions, bell pepper, and bamboo, and is a great dish here. Another favorite is the barbeque duck, which is available at a well-priced $9 for the half order and is served with an amazing sauce.",

    "text": "KJK on Spring Mountain is an excellent Chinese restaurant, very popular among Asians and smart, well-informed westerners, for its tasty Cantonese cuisine!  - NO dimsum at this location,  however, for that you can go to its NEW, sister branch in Rio.  We had our local Chinese friends to thank for telling us about this nice little restaurant a few years back.  We like it a lot and have been going there for a number of years, for its quite authentic Cantonese cuisine. Although it has changed chefs and management a couple of times, and its prices have gone up a little - the quality of food remains high! Do not expect fancy decor, nor great services at this location, which are adequate - just go there for their tasty, reasonably priced dishes. Oh, it does have table clothes at dinner time. KJK is actually a lot like those \"regular\" restaurants in Hong Kong, where local people frequent - for their high quality of food , and NOT for the fancy decor or service typical of \"high-end\" restaurants.  Yes, KJK is well-known to visitors from Los Angeles and local Asians and their westerner friends in Vegas.  Quick TIP: - Best way to enjoy your dinner is to go with a party of 2 or more, and try out several dishes, e.g., Scallion Chinese Fried Chicken; Lightly fried, Sea Bass; Egg Plants Pot; Mixed Seafood Pot...  A dinner dish runs between $8 to $15+, NOT cheap, but reasonable. - For dinner, get there before 6pm to avoid long waiting time.  Peterskis Mar 2012",

We ordered the Flounder in a pan fried style for $6.95, braised bean curd with yui choi $6.95, house special fried noodle $5.95 and string beans in xo sauce $6.95. I thought the dishes would be half sized orders but was surprised with full size portions.  The food is a hit in my books a great option to if you want to venture away from the strip.",

    "text": "One of my many goals moving to Vegas include finding the best places in the area to eat Asian food...next stop Cantonese cuisine!  Briefing through the trusty <a href=\"http://yelp.com\">yelp.com</a>, I simply typed \"chinese\" and the one that caught my eye was KJ Kitchen.    As I read reviews, certain phrases caught my attention like \"authentic\" or \"Best Cantonese\" and even \"coming from socal, it's as good as it gets,\" I was keen on driving 20 minutes to dine here.    As we entered the restaurant, it really is your typical chinese restaurant, waiter/waitresses were all chinese, and a few other ethnicities, and we were quickly seated and given menus.    Now you may read on some other reviews that the SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE...oh please....they just don't understand CHINESE CULTURE! lol.  I'm being serious.  The people here aren't being rude, it is just a way we, the Chinese peeps, do things and run a business.  If you feel that service was bad at KJ, try dining in China....haha.    Personally, I felt the service was great! Well then again, my family and I speak the language. =P  The waitress that helped us was informative and took our order down and the food came out fast...now THAT'S considered good service at a Chinese restaurant! ;-)    Food was delicious and flavorful.  It really was authentic like all the other positive reviews said!  Some of my favorite dishes that I enjoyed were:  ***Salt and Pepper Pork Chops*** * Black Pepper Steak * Scallop and Egg White Fried Rice * House Style Pan Fried Noodles  There were many other dishes to try, but I am saving that for another family feast here!    On a side note, you KNOW it is a good restaurant when the place is packed with it's own people! haha.    Check it out!  It will be worth it. =)",

My good food staples are the clams with black bean sauce, salt and pepper shrimp or porkchop, whichever you are in the mood for, beef chow fun (the fat noodles made dry style), Green beans with XO sauce which gives a nice little spice, chinese beef stew with turnip, and the tofu stuffed with shrimp paste. No charge for white rice, unlike on the strip! For dinner, they give house soup and house dessert with your meal.  There are other items on the menu that are more adventurous such as frog leg clay pot, lamb stew, and other items that I can't read and wouldn't ever dream of ordering, but I'm glad I tried them when I went with the boyfriend's relatives.   Typical chinese restaurant where the service does not discriminate and therefore kinda sucks whether you are chinese or not.",

The honey walnut shrimp was passable, not great... but I probably still could've used another order of it because it went quickly with so many people at the table. The BBQ duck was excellent. Mongolian beef was pretty good, and so was that pickled dish of cold cuts and gelatinous stuff (sorry, wasn't there when they ordered it, didn't catch the name). Chicken was a little dry but otherwise okay.  I really would have liked good honey walnut shrimp and decent chicken, so I'm bringing the rating down the bit. Still, you can bring people here safely. Just watch out for the $30 minimum per credit card when splitting the bill.",

I recommend go during lunch before 3pm and specifically ask for lunch menu because it is way cheaper than the dinner menu they will give you. We got chow fun, orange chicken, deep fried whole fish, saute string beans, salt and pepper pork, deep fried shrimps, combo fried rice, a saute squid dish. I remember the total number of dishes we order were 10, and the bill was only around $70!!! I was quite surprised. It fed the entire hungry family 8. Food was really good and consistent with the taste. Place always crowded and even more at night. Good service really nice servers. The food came to the table quite fast we barely waited for next dishes. There were flies in the restaurant though.. But it was fine in general.",

We were seated right away and this was around 615. People just started to pile in after that and we were lucky that we got the last big table as there seemed to be a wait. We ordered the usual Chinese items. peking duck, salt and pepper porkchops, veggies, chow fun, chow mein, shrimp with scramble eggs, etc. Food was  pretty good and you can pay by credit card not this CASH only thing. I hated how they really tried to rush us out. We weren't even really done with our meal and they were trying to clear out our table. If it wasn't for that then this place would have gotten 4 stars. Overall, its a decent Chinese restaurant but their service needs some help. I know we will be back.",

I read how this place is authentic and how it was comparable to SGV's (in socal) Chinese food... and we were not feelin' burgers or steak, so Chinese food for us.  So, again, I had low expectations.  I come in, and the tanks are full of half dead or totally dead fish.  Uh oh... what have I walked into...?  We were seated, and great, 12pm, lunch specials!  Yay.  Fried flounder.  F* ya!  Reading certain Yelp reviews, we also got the roasted pork chops.  We ordered the shrimp with scrambled eggs, the spare ribs with honey and squid with black bean sauce.  The fried flounder was bomb.  Crispy and perfectly fried so the outter bone lining is edible like a chip.  The sauce that came with it was great.  Light and not overly salty.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/u3nwislXMKKwkpHAXAArbQ?select=mWe7Et6gUzFNusdATZ30VA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/u3nw...</a>  The roasted salt and pepper pork chops did not disappoint.  Albeit small chunks of pork chops, but incredibly tasty and juicy.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/u3nwislXMKKwkpHAXAArbQ?select=1owGBowQhKOePJVkTu9urA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/u3nw...</a>  The squid with black bean sauce... good.  Squid was not overcooked... but a bit greasy.  A tad salty as well.  Great to spoon over your rice!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/u3nwislXMKKwkpHAXAArbQ?select=SQH6DCZEwUGbgVNoKWDrbA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/u3nw...</a>  The scrambled eggs with shrimp... pretty much what you'd expect lol.  I don't really need to say much about it.  It was cooked fine.  All in all, a perfectly acceptable Chinese restaurant to go to in Las Vegas...  If you're craving Chinese, come here.  Why not.",

Will definitely be back, pretty soon actually.   I liked how there was not too much advertisement outside. Straight up, Chinese Cuisine. I think is what it said anyways. Always a good sign to see the Chinese people eating the food when you walk in. The restrooms were clean, that was really nice. They are by the kitchen, but they are nice and kempt.

    "text": "My family and I've been coming here since 2010. KJ Kitchen offers tasty Chinese food for a more reasonable price. Further, the portions are much larger and cheaper for almost the same quality taste as harbor palace or joyful. I wouldn't say it's the BEST in town. However, it's okay. It's tasty. You come and get what you pay for w/ okay services, which is why I give this place 3-stars.   What we always eat:   1. Walnut shrimp (lately they've been skimping on the amount of shrimp they give)  2. Dried scallop and egg white fried rice - always a great item on the menu  3. Steamed fish - huge portions and great for sharing  4. Duck - this is a hit or miss. Sometimes the duck is big and juicy and other times it's dry and thin.  5. Sweet and Sour Pork - a nice meaty dish that goes well w/ fried rice, regular white rice or chow mein  6. Fried tofu w/ bamboo shoots and vegetables - I LOVE THIS DISH! But Food Express makes it better   SERVICE   What you'd expect at a Chinese restaurant. They'll serve you what you need, sometimes ignore you if they don't want to help you and be very short w/ you. :-) Also, the service is always very fast. Even on a busy day the staff is quick, which we can all appreciate.   PRICE   Reasonable. If you go to the KJ kitchen at the RIO it will be more expensive than this location.   Overall, 3-star experience for me. Thanks KJ Kitchen for always serving yummy food for a reasonable price. :-D",

Mind you, we had arrived half an hour before parties after us, and those later parties received their entire entrees BEFORE we were even served soup.  After about half an hour and noticing that everyone else who arrived 30 minutes after us had been served, we asked but were basically ignored. Everyone else in the restaurant was obviously Chinese. We are too, yet I guess if you don't LOOK the part your last on the list.  When we finally did get our food nearly one hour after being seated, it was literally thrown at us on the table.  The food is sub par, and I wish I knew that before coming here. There are better Chinese restaurants that would have definitely been worth the wait. This, I wouldn't even wait five minutes for.  Overly salted pork and soup.  Will never return",

The man who took my order was very rude and every time I would ask a question about the menu he would either not answer it or just tell me that the menu is very specific; which by the way, it wasn't. The situation got so bad that I ended up ordering takeout, simply because I didn't want to be served by a rude man. Food wise I would  recommend this place but the only thing that doesn't make them good enough is their service.",

We flagged down the server 3 times and were given a nod or a hand gesture to wait.  People who were seated even after my entire had arrived were helped before us so finally we all got up and walked out.    We ended up at a restaurant down the street who was twice as busy, took our order, served us quickly, wipe friendly and received a 25% tip.",

KJ Kitchen closed late and the star ratings weren't too bad. So I ordered a few dishes and brought it home. We had the orange beef, Mandarin pork ribs (aka Peking pork chops) and braised yee noodles. Let's start with the orange beef. We've had orange beef plenty of times from other restaurants including our own families previous restaurant years back. The strips beef was shaved so thin that it was practically non existent and translucent. Deep fried too long with so much batter it was like eating leather. Where we come from, you can actually see the 1/4 inch of tender beef not including the light crispy batter. Next is the Mandarin pork ribs aka Peking pork chops. This dish is completely opposite the orange beef.  The pork chops were tenderized so much that the meat turned gelatinous. They put too much baking soda to tenderize it. The jellified meat was then drenched with a thick batter and deep fried. I couldn't distinguish the meat from the pork fat and batter because they all had the same mushy texture. The noodles were ok. Thank goodness one out of three was edible.",

We made a reservation for 10 people, so they had set up a round table in the back for us when we arrived. We could tell that they were very busy, but the service was fast and the waitresses were not quick or short with us.   The prices of the dishes are a little more expensive than the usual Chinese restaurant. But, the portions of the dishes are bigger. So I would recommend coming here if you are with a large group of people who is craving Chinese food. That way you can order more dishes and share among everyone.",

Some things we ordered were great and some things were not so great - I'm certain we didn't order all of the right things. It happens...  Honey walnut shrimp - it was crispy and smothered in mayo sauce making it ultra creamy. Yet, I think it was missing something. It felt very one noted in the flavor department and I felt overall that it needed more seasoning to bring it all together. It's certainly not the best honey walnut shrimp I've ever had, but it passes as good. 4/5  Vegetable egg-rolls - don't try ordering these! I ate one and it tasted like dish water. The filling was extremely sad and there was nothing stuffed inside the rolls except for cabbage and maybe carrots? Whatever it was, it disintegrated from the deep frying, making it barely noticeable and mush. Also the sweet and sour sauce to dip was watery and tasted off. Very disappointing and not worth getting. 1/5  The hot and sour soup was excellent! It was the favorite thing we ordered. It came out piping hot and the presentation was lovely - Nice color, texture, and most importantly flavor. It was one of the better hot and sour soups I've had. Comforting and addicting 5/5",

I also loved the black pepper beef (I think that's what it was) and the cod with soy sauce.    Service wasn't too bad, and there was a celebrity sighting there: one of the waiters looked like Bruce Lee.",

    "text": "Thank you, Yelp, (once again) for bringing me to KJ.  When my man and I first moved to Vegas, we had heard that there was a place with the best Chinese food in town from one of our favorite servers... only, she said this place was \"KL,\" not \"KJ.\"  We had given up our search for the mysterious KL some time ago (and were close to giving up our search for another resto that had brought us so far down Spring Mountain on this particular night)... and Yelp came to our rescue!! We searched for Chinese nearby and, with the help of the Yelp Iphone app, came across KJ!!! After reading the reviews, we knew KL was not KL but KJ.  Sigh... now do you know why I heart Yelp??! But I digress....  The second indicator that this place was going to be the BOMB (the first, of course, being the number of folks that gave this place 5 stars on Yelp) was the line of cabbies dropping people off outside this resto.... on a WEEKNIGHT... at 10 PM!  We walked inside to find the place was fully packed... so packed, in fact, we waited 20 min for table! Once we did finally sit, lovely jasmine tea was bought to our table.  We opted for the XO beans (DELISH!), the Eggplant Hotpot (DELISH times 2), and the Sizzling Mixed Seafood in Garlic Sauce (SO-SO).  Overall, the food scored a 5 (the Eggplant more than made up for the MEH-Seafood).  The only reason this place is a 4 is because of the service.  While the service was fast, it was far from efficient and not friendly. The waiter had little to no patience for any questions and made us feel like we were bothering him when we asked for a water refill. Oh well... I will still go back to KJ.... hopefully I get a nicer server next time.",

    "text": "I started off my Vegas adventure by stopping at KJ Kitchen.  What a great way to start off the trip.  The food tastes like what I can get around home.  In fact, it made me feel like I didn't leave home at all.   This place opens until 2 AM 7 days a week.  Prices are very reasonable.  Food tastes great.  It is located away from the strip so there is no waiting in line or large crowds.  They offer a 20% off the entire bill late night discount if you dine there 10 PM - 2 AM.  I know because I was there at midnight.  This place kicks Sam Woo's booty (located down the street) in terms of quality of service, taste of the food, and price.  One last and important thing about this place, it has one of the most cleanest restroom that I have ever been to.  It is so clean, they can set up a table and have people eat in there!  Go to KJ Kitchen if you are looking for great tasting chinese food in the Vegas area.    Bon Appetit!",

It was a nice night, it was a convertible, so it asked for a drive. This just caught our eye and we rolled in.   BF and I shared a Stir Fryed Deer and some seafood chowfun.  So the \"deer\" was good, but I really don't think it was deer. LOL it tasted like I was having Mongolian Beef for $4 more. Shoot...I was excited that they had odd meats but I couldn't tell the damned difference. Tasty- but that wasn't deer..Chowfun was tasty and we had quite a bit to take home for lunch.   I think it's a good late night option and I'm very curious about some of the odd offerings on the menu...sometimes I just feel like some exotic down home Chinese foods. One in particular is the Ox Tail with Red Wine. I had this in Hong Kong and been dying to have some again but I don't ever see it on menus. To be continued....that dish is on my want list.",

    "text": "Came here because fellow elite Emmagelle B. and Ryan M. are regulars here claiming it's their favorite place to get their Chinese food fix. Myself +2 came on a Monday around 2pm. Upon walking in I immediately notice it is a tad smaller compared to the other popular joints in town.  It wasn't busy at all because there were 2 tables with customers, which worked in our favor because our food came out within 10-15 minutes. We ordered batchoy, some type of crispy house special noodle, sauteed shrimp, fried flounder, and salt and pepper pork chop. The batchoy was kind of whatever wish we would of ordered a tastier vegetable dish, the noodles were good, but I was not in awe, sauteed shrimp was accompanied with onions and green peppers, but the onions made up 75% of the dish and the dish overall was okay. Fried flounder was crisp, but another \"okay\" taste as well. And most places don't mess up salt and pepper pork chop. Food was between okay and good, but I have definitely had better. On the plus side the service was good for a Chinese place because our server Jing gave us all our needs. I hate to mention their competitor on here, but HK Star will still be my spot for getting my Chinese fix on. Thank you!",

Therefore, when I leave Austin Texas I'm on a mission for Chinese food. Not beef and broccoli but REAL Chinese food. Therefore, when my buddy asked where I wanted to go my only answer was an authentic Chinese restaurant and KJ Kitchen was PERFECT.   We ordered 4 items because...well.. I didn't know the next time I would be able to eat authentic Chinese food and quite frankly, I CAN put away enough food for 2 1/2 people. I'm not skeered. We ordered fried sea bass which was served with a dipping sauce that was not the slightest bit greasy and incredibly tasty. We also ordered sauteed Chinese broccoli which was as good as one would expect. I don't think you can really have spectacular Chinese broccoli. Whatever. Also we had a noodle dish and the steamed chicken both of which were VERY good.   The service was very prompt and courteous and I never felt rushed. The owner also came over to say hello which was a nice touch.   The atmosphere was as to be expected in an authentic Chinese restaurant: lobster tank, the usual art, nothing spectacular.. overall nice.",

    "text": "I just had one of those meals that I'll remember forever here.  Now I have to confess, it might have been much different had we gone alone -- but we went with some serious foodie Chinese friends who are regulars and wow -- we were seriously blown away.    Here's how my Chinese host puts it:  You know a Chinese place is good when it meets 3 criteria:  1)  The line outside the door is all Chinese.   2) The bathroom is dirty   3)  There are flies.   We had a ten course tasting menu -- family style.  Started with a pot of pork and winter melon soup -- simple, light -- and as our host said -- free, so don't complain.  Who would?    Next came the \"free chicken\" -- all tables of 7 or more get the whole chicken -- that's Chinese poached chicken, served cold, hacked, bone in -- with a remarkable cold ginger sauce that I'm still thinking about.  Then our server came out with our fish and lobster for our host to inspect -- and the reason he invited us to join him.  He wanted to teach my husband the difference in \"fresh fish\" and \"live fish\" -- there really aren't that many places in town -- or anywhere actually, that serve their fish from flipping, to flat in a matter of minutes.   And this was one of those mind-blowingly red rockfish -- that if you swam up to in the ocean, you'd definitely avoid.  The lobster was at least 5 pounds and gorgeous and pissed.   Soon, they would be our dinner -- and honestly I felt guilty and unworthy.  Next, they brought out a platter of the most phenomenal looking prawns -- I'm talking 6 inches long, brilliant pink, heads and tails on -- for us to peel and eat, and dip into ponzu.   These were so fresh, I'm blown away -- packed with roe.  Truly a life changing dish for me.  Then jellyfish -- with daikon and cucumber -- great acidity, sweetness, crunch -- and the slippery-ness of the jellyfish -- texture, flavor -- and we loved it.  Had thirds.  Then there was tofu, that creamy, slippery kind that defy my Anglo chopstick skills.  Imagine, my horror and shame, when they presented me with a fork.   Yep, that bad.  Then string beans -- the twice fried kind.  Shivers...they were so good.  Oh, we did a quick check of the door -- we arrived at 7 -- and the line was  about 15 deep and super cranky that the two of us slipped past them (all clearly regulars) to our host and his wife and other guests who were already seated... we were the only white folk in the place -- and I don't think it went over well...   Now it wasn't even 8:30 and the line was still as long, and the room packed... I'm talking big parties, too.   Back to the food...after that brief respite, they brought sauteed oysters and green onions,  stir fried rice with dried scallops and egg, the magnificent lobster, stirfried.  Then the rockfish -- Hong Kong style -- over more tofu, with more scallions and more ponzu -- nature's True art -- and a tribute to the chef that he served it so simply -- whole in all its beauty.  Then, tada...crispy frog with jalapeno, fried garlic and green onions.   Yep -- frog -- apparently not such a rarity on menus in Vegas, as one would think.  Our host explained that frog is a big deal in China -- a very common ingredient -- rice paddies... I had never thought about that before.  His other guest also lauded frog's excellent medicinal benefits...since my husband is Alsatian, and frog is popular there, I guess I'm going to have to rethink things... it was definitely good enough to have again -- just for the batter it was in -- and yes, it tasted like chicken...  The chef came out as dessert was served to visit with our host and meet my husband.  He is fascinating, the dessert, not so much...it was a red bean tapioca soupy sort of thing -- ok, it was the only miss for me -- but again, no complaints since it was complimentary...   Seriously, for those of you looking for a truly authentic Chinese meal -- I implore you to try this restaurant -- now mind you, this was a simple Tuesday night -- and it was slammed.   This is a completely hidden, local Chinese only secret, which probably explains the reason there is only one mediocre review... and btw, the fish aren't in a tank by the door...  But I truly believe that it would be best to begin asking your Chinese friends to come with you -- my guess is they're sworn to secrecy.    And I'll send you this wish, that your meal is as wonderful as ours was.  Oh, and this place is open late -- I think 2am.  Try to come with friends in one car, too -- the parking lot is small, and in classic Spring Mt style, shared with a host of other businesses, but all are taken up by KJ Kitchen customers.  So there may be a wait for a parking spot, too.",

I am super picky when it comes to Chinese food because 1) I am Chinese and 2) I'm from the Bay Area where they have the best Chinese Food.  KJ isn't a 5 star restaurant but almost never will a \"real\" Chinese restaurant be.  Don't expect to be waited on hand and food because that's just not how it works.  However, the restaurant is comfortable and the food is extremely good.  The food is authentic (No orange chicken here!), and it's really what Chinese people eat.  Everything is always the perfect temperature and flavor is on par.      Some things to try: Manila clams with basil, salt and peppered pork chops, stir fried vegetable (of the day) with garlic, and black peppered steak on a sizzling plate.  If you really want authentic Chinese, this is the place to go.  KJ is the only place we go for our \"family dinner\" since they've opened.    P.S.  If you're of a part of 6 (or maybe 8), they offer a complementary half-chicken.  I will say that I have had better, but it's free so who can really complain.",

They give you hot tea as the default drink so you should ask for water if you want.  The rice is good and has a good consistency.  Also, they give this red bean soup that's pretty good as a complimentary dessert.  Either that or fortune cookies.  Hopefully next time we go there, they give both.

Its pretty much as good as it gets for chinese food in Vegas, but it compares to the places that are well known, such as places in LA and such.. From what I hear the cook was originally from a popular restaurant in LA and he moved here to cook for KJ kitchen, and for asian cuisine its not really about how presentation, but how the food tastes, and chinese cuisine is very hard to master where there is a general agreement that it is good.. This place is usally always packed, if youre not in by 7pm and do not have a reservation try on a different day because this place fills up quick.  Suggestions,  -Walnut Shrimp -Lobster -Fried Crab -Fried Oysters -Roasted Duck -And some white sea bass..  mmm so go try some real chinese sea food!! its the best in town. Its a bit pricey but you get what you pay for.. and thats the damn truth",

The three of us ordered:  - Sea bass and tofu hot/clay pot : Bubbling cauldron with pieces of fish coated in a breading and well-marinated tofu. This was highly recommended and while tasty, became soggy fast and the textures didn't do it for me. There were also random pieces of char siu that struck me as incongruous.  - Salt and pepper pork : Kind of like pork nuggets. Juicy, crispy and easy to eat a whole piece in one bite, these disappeared but would've been more memorable with the right sauce.  - Scrambled eggs with char siu : One of my favorites from the meal. The eggs were well cooked and had nice little bits of char siu- some of the pieces of pork were burnt, which ruined the creaminess from the eggs - Half roast duck : Lots of bony pieces, but the meat was juicy and the skin had a nice crackle to it. The dipping sauce was great! - Steamed dumplings : Just ok.   Our whole meal, including a large bowl of free soup and a huge bowl of rice, came out to $46 or so. Awesome!  Overall the food was better than the average americanized chinese, but I wasn't magically transported to Hong Kong or anything. It came out fast but we were the only people there.  There was a lone, sad looking geoduck in a tank near the door. Some of their other seafood looked nice but the prices aren't listed.",

I can't name all the dishes we ate, but it doesn't matter because I'm sure anything you order from here will be delicious! Their crab fried rice was, hands down, the best fried rice I've ever eaten. Sorry mom :p And their lobster was also very tasty and they have forks ready for people like me who are chopstick challenged.

Until my friends showed up, there were no white people in this restaurant, which says a lot. ;) We ordered a ton of dishes and they were all exceptional. The usual suspects, like Kung Pao Chicken, were amazing, but so was the lobster, the sweet 'n sour pork chops, shrimp fried rice and spicy, fried soy bean.  Like one reviewer noted before, this restaurant is on a par with those of Singapore, which is high praise indeed. Real, authentic Chinese in Las Vegas, your better believe it! :P",

    "text": "So this place ALWAYS pops up whenever I do a \"Best Match\" search on Yelp from work.  Enough that I could no longer ignore it, though I have a crazy admission to make, something I just realized over the last several weeks....  I dont know if I really LIKE Chinese food.  This is especially shocking when you consider my mom is Taiwanese which makes me half and that I grew up on eating a lot of it *and love, and still eat to this day, but there's something about the majority of Chinese restaurants I go to that I rarely find myself enjoying the food.  Meanwhile I'm obsessed with Thai and Indian restaurants, which makes me think it's all about the spices for me at the moment, and ultimately the flavors at Chinese restaurants I've been to as of late just haven't been matching up.  So there I was in the Zia Records parking lot, finally deciding to take the plunge on KJ Kitchen and do some take out.  When I try a new place like this, and particularly when they have relatively cheap prices like KJs lunch specials, I like to experiment a bit (plus let's be honest, too much food is never a problem).  I went with the oft mentioned steamed flounder lunch special and the salt and pepper pork chops lunch special.   I was told 15 minutes and showed up maybe 12 minutes after.   The process for picking up the food was a little disorganized.  The man at the counter asked me to repeat my order, and if I didn't know any better I don't think the food had been put in to be prepared yet.   Also I asked for an Iced Tea over the phone and he said \"okay\" and when I got there I was asked if I wanted coke, sprite, or something else.   Iced tea wasnt an option?   I saw some Nestle bottled water and said I'll take one of those, and he told me I couldnt have one?   At this point I'm not sure if even he knew what was happening.   So I told them forget the drink, and I sat down and waited for the food which seemed like it took about 10 minutes from the time I entered.   Nothing too major, but definitely not the efficient machine I've come to expect from some of my favorite take out joints.  By the way, after I tipped $3 after paying, he did eventually hand me a bottle of water.  Not sure if the tip had anything to do with it or if he went against some sort of unwritten rule about giving out bottled water for takeout.   (shrug)  The flounder was interesting to take back to the office for takeout, which is something I honestly didn't consider when ordering.  I will say it was all packaged up professionally and I had no incidents which was appreciated.  The flounder and pork chops were in their own separate containers naturally, and there was a third container PILED with white rice.  They must have figured that this was going to a small family or something with the amount that was provided.  Nope, just the big white guy.  I was a little disappointed that there was no soup, egg roll or fried rice that was mentioned in the menu as coming with the lunch specials.  Perhaps it says dine in only or maybe the logistics aren't reasonable for this, but the fact of the matter is:  NONE of it was provided with my takeout.    The flounder was definitely a steal at 6.95 for the amount you get, but flavor-wise I thought it was a bit bland.  I don't think I'd order it again.   The Salt and Pepper Pork chops were really nice.  A little greasy but not too much, and I thought they were perfectly seasoned.  Much better than say the version from Food Express I tried several weeks ago.    With the food I'd say KJ earned a 2.5/3, but with the oddness surrounding the takeout experience I round down to a 2.  I will say that while I sat and waited I saw several really nice plates of food passing me by that have me considering that with the right order you can get some really amazing meals here.   Or perhaps dining in is the way to go and not take-out.  OR perhaps I'm forever cursed with the idea that no one can top my mom's chinese fare.",

But I usually go at regular hours with my husband   This chinese restaurant is probably the only chinese restaurant in Vegas that has the closest dining experience to the chinese restaurants that I enjoy in San Francisco.  I normally order the green beans with ground pork  cause it's just really good. Try the roasted chicken with scallions and make sure you wanna order the one with crispy skin. I always order these usual two.   The menu is pretty good too. I love how they have a chinese version menu also and you just might have to ask which is what sometimes.  Most of all, I always look forward to the free dessert they give you in the end. It's a different dessert everyday and its usually served as a hot dessert soup. My favorite is the red bean soup with the tiny glutinous rice balls, ( like tiny clear boba bubbles ) swimming in my soup. Tastes fabulously delicious.  I almost left out the service. These waiters keep an eye on you and they're fast, prompt, and friendly, and constantly checking on you. Just how I like my service in a restaurant. It's probably because of the fact my husband and I been there so much and they remember us being good tippers too. haa =X",

    "text": "This place was recommended by an uncle who frequents Vegas and likes finding culinary gems off the beaten bath.  Four stars to KJ Kitchen for getting Cantonese cuisine (almost) right.  We visited a bit before 7pm and were lucky enough to get a table (quick set up in 1 minute; felt like I was in Restaurant Wars or something).  The clientele is mostly Asian, always a sure sign that the food is good because it passes muster with the people familiar with the cuisine.  Traditional Chinese decor greets you on entry:  the mandatory red altar by the door, the aquariums at the entrance to signify the flow of water (heck, they even house live fish too sometimes), three chinese gods feng shui(cally) placed on the corner diagonally from the entrance, golden buddha on the cashier's counter.    We were out of luck as the rockfish was not available.  Other items on the menu that caught our eye included Deer with Black Mushrooms, Duck Toungue with XO and Maggie Sauce, Salted Fish Maw with Shrimp, and Frog Legs in Clay Pot.  Not feeling that adventurous, we decided on going for the familiar and got the Salted Pepper Pork (3 stars; HKG BBQ and Dimsum does it better), Honey Walnut Shrimp (3 stars; Sam Woo does it better), and Roasted Duck (4 stars; perfectly crisped skin and delicious sauce!).  Tea and white rice are free.  Priced so it won't break your wallet.  Late night dining is available from 10pm to 2am (perfect after a night of clubbing).  And make sure you ask for the special (chinese) menu that we found out about AFTER we placed our order!  Bummer.",

The sauce was good and the fish was meaty. It also tasted fresh because there wasn't any funky flavors.   Beef with vegetable: this was my favorite dish!! The beef was sliced thinly and was very tender. The greens were a little crunchy and cooked the way I like them (not too soft). The sauce was great too.  Braised beancurd: this one was good too, the tofu was a little thick so it wasn't as flavored, but it was still tasty. There was also a lot of mushrooms in the  dish too which was fantastic.   Shrimp rice noodle (chow fun): wonderful dish as well! The chow fun was cooked well (none of them were not cooked or stuck together) and were all covered in a tasty sauce. There were a lot of shrimp and they were all tender and fresh.   Rice is free during lunch. The only thing is that the portions are a little small during lunch, but the quality is still great so I think it's worth it.",

    "text": "Food: authentic Cantonese style chinese food. Great lunch specials and for dinner with family. The lunch specials I like are the salt and pepper pork (fried with just the right hint of spicy), beef with vegetables and hong kong style pan fried noodles (combination) is always a winner. We've had large family dinners here and everything we ordered was delicious. Everything tastes fresh and authentic.  Ambiance: decent sized restaurant with large round tables to accommodate a large family meal.  Service: for a chinese restaurant, I think the service is actually really great. The owner is really nice and friendly, their english is great and they'll box your leftovers for you. Can't get better than that!!! Same owner as the dim sum in the Rio, but under different management.  Location: Easy parking in a plaza.",

The waiter apologized and brought us napkins and another bowl of dessert but I feel like part of our meal should have been comped... Oh wells it's an Asian restaurant.  As for the food we ordered the braised tofu with veggies, spicy sausage stir fry, yang chow fried rice, and the honey garlic spareribs. So nothing was that great or flavorful. It was decent... But missing either some spice, salt etc. the tofu definitely needed some flavor. The honey garlic ribs were very sweet. I like sweet meats but my friend didn't. The spicy stir fry was not spicy at all and the fried rice was not salty enough. Things were pretty bland.  The saving grace.. Free soup and dessert with meals!  Hopefully they won't spill it on you. I also like the vibe of this restaurant because it reminds me of places my parents and I would go eat at... Kind of gritty, hole in the wall chinese restaurant.",

    "text": "3.5 stars, but I'm rounding down because of the service (yes I know it's a Chinese restaurant :P )  So we came into Vegas and decided we needs some food. We decided to hit up Chinatown because we had so much to explore, and we were going to be on the Strip for a lot of the time, so time for exploration! Plus I had Kung Fu Tea bookmarked :P  The restaurant was mostly full (wow) and there were a lot of people inside. That's a good sign =D  Seafood Pan Fried Egg Noodle- Yay the egg noodles were crunchy so that you could chew on them and they crunched in your teeth hehee. There were a lot of noodles and seafood in there :3 (fish, squid, shrimp). The thing with this was that it was justttt missing a little bit of salt/sodium in the sauce 3/5  Steak cantonese style- Again, not enough sauce/it was missing that little bit in there. The beef was good and tender. I think ordering the beef sizzling plate with black pepper would have been better and tons tastier. 3/5  Honey spare ribs- This would be the star of the show. Yay. Flavor there YES. There was a bit more fat in here than I would have liked, but the honey/sauce that surrounded the ribs was good :) This is the thing that I would recommend y'all to get! 4.5/5  The service- Nope nope nope. It took about 35 minutes from ordering everything to when the last dish came out. That's a pretty long wait, especially for only 3 items. I remember being able to finish each dish and having to wait for the next dish to come out. And some of us take our time to eat- and even they finished before the next meal came out. So make sure you have plenty of time in between your meal, because you'll spend some time here!  A decent place to get Chinese food, would probably come back again next time we hit up Vegas!",

    "text": "Authentic Chinese  food, but I have some issues.   It's a little challenging to accommodate a group of 18 for dinner. My mom always wants Chinese cuisine, so we usually will head to the Chinatown in each city we visit. Thankfully, Las Vegas has a big Chinatown and a lot of restaurants to choose from.   The place was busy, but we only waited 30 minutes to get 2 tables  Here's the Rundown:  *Crab Meat, Corn & Fish Maw Soup - good, a little light on the crab meat though.  *Fried Chicken - solid dish  *Crispy Deep Fried Bean Curd - Good *Fish Filet w/ Black Bean Sauce - okay *Clam w/ Ginger & Scallion - Very Good *Mongolian Beef - okay *Spicy Salt Squid - good *Braised Yee Noodles - our favorite dish of the night. It was very simple and only had shiitake mushrooms. Highly recommend this dish.  *Yang Chow Fried Rice - very bland, not a lot of meat.   Service was fast, but they forgot the fried rice and had to be reminded.   My issues: *Serving size was small. Aside from the noodles and fried rice, everything was like a lunch serving at a local place we frequent. Dinner portions should be double what they served.   *No free dessert (which is usually included with the meal in this type of restaurant). Their excuse was they ran out. How does that happen with 3 more hours before closing time.   Price: was high considering the size portion.   Solid Chinese food, typical Asian service (wants you in & out fast), questionable portion size and high price is what you get here.   Go try them out for yourself and decide.",

Maybe I'm spoiled from being from SoCal and having our own chinatown or even just towns where asians have naturally gravitated to have built their own unofficial chinatowns.  Either way it's not their fault but you can easily drive past this place without even knowing you just went through chinatown.  Either way I ordered my normal choices of food and the food was barely edible.  I normally can dust off just about anything and never really leave left over especially when it comes to chinese food.  There is something about chinese food where all it takes is a couple sips of hot tea and you are ready to stuff your face still.  I really don't want to go on a laundry list of bad things but really nothing tasted like chinese food.  Even the batter used on the fried items is nothing like I've had before and was more like something you would put on fried chicken.  When you walk in the door it's not like you have the highest hopes initially anyways since the fish are dead in the tank when you walk in.  Those that think this is authentic chinese food, you've been stuck in vegas too long.",

We got  it in the past and between a dozen and a dozen and a half big plump ones but this time 6-7 pissant tiny.

Only would have been better if she said \"you go now, cow eye sum bitch!\"    Lobsters are cut up with meat cleaver and spread out and covered with sauce so it looks impressive but overpriced and over rated.  Customer service to adjust bill doesn't exist.   \"you go now, cow eye sum bitch!\"    Seinfeld, party of 4!!!!!  If it comes to the table and doesn't match looks  for price,,send it back and check your bill so they don't charge you anyway!!",

Never had a dish like this before, so I liked it. Mixed Seafood w/ Vegetables - Good amount of seafood.  Good! Sauteed Green Beans w/ Minced Pork - Good also.  First dish to be eaten up completely clean. Roast Duck - Not bad.  For a restaurant that doesn't have ducks hanging in the window, it was decent.  A bit fatty, but still good flavor and not too salty. Fish Stomach Soup - Good also.  We started out with this.  Good amount of fish. Sweet n Sour Pork Chops - I love this dish, I always get it everywhere I go.  It's such an ABC americanized dish, but it brings back my childhood memories.  This place made it good.  Not too bready, not too fatty.  Not too sweet.  Desert was FREE! - Green bean w/ tapioca.  Good.  Thank you!",

Just went there last weekend and ask the wait staff how's the roast duck because that's usually our gage as to how good a Chinese restaurant is most places just awful on the duck, usually a reheat and according to the wait staff she said it's good and we took her word and ordered it. It was a totally reheated duck probably microwave then gone thru a hot oiled wok to crisp up the skin. Also asked her what fresh vegetable they have for the day, and order the hollow Chinese vegetable with garlic but instead we got baby back choi. Didn't bother sending it back! Crispy fried noodle with seafood was bland. Husband ordered the fried intestine and usually any thing fried would be good but he said it wasn't the freshest and I can tell what he meant when I can smell the stinkyness of it.

    "text": "I was brought here by my Chinese friend and his parents for an impromptu dinner. There were a lot of Chinese families and couples in there and it appeared at one point I was the only non-Chinese in the restaurant excluding the Mexican waiter. This is a good thing to see -  along with waitstaff wearing bow ties.  Eventually, other diners arrived who were non-Chinese so they must have received the memo.  This is by far one of my favorite Chinese restaurants and I've eaten Chinese in Hong Kong and San Francisco. With a very extensive menu, KJs has something to delight everyone on your party.  I asked my friend's mother about a few signs written in Chinese characters that were posted in the dinning area. She told me it said 20% off between the hours of 10pm and 2am. So next time you are in Vegas, forgo the steak dinner with the boys and hit up KJs in the Chinatown section of LV. You will feast on some of the most authentic Chinese fare and save a ton of money for the slots.  Cheap, authentic and great portions.",

    "text": "Late night dining is a great value at KJ. When I was working swing shift, my friend from work and I would come here for a bite after getting out. The 20% discount might not seem like that big of a deal since most Asian restaurants run the $4-$5 plates at this time of night. The quality of the dishes are not compromised here. Instead of hacking down the price drastically, they just make their existing plates more reasonable.  We got the soft tofu, bitter greens, and egg soup. It was good. I wasn't much into soup that night and only had a bowl. The vegetables in it was my favorite part, yet the strong flavor is not for everyone. The yellow skinned chicken is what they are known for. It is delicious. Between that and the intestine hot pot with preserved vegetables were my favorite items of the night. The chicken was a nice contrast in temperature compared to the hot pot. It was nice to change between bites to cool down or warm up. Dipping it in the ginger sauce or their house made XO was the way to go. I try not to eat too much late at night, but even I could not stop myself from picking out the slightly sour vegetables and pig intestines. The broth was delicious as well and there was nothing left by the end of the meal. We had also got the salt and pepper shrimp with the heads still attached. They were piping hot and came out crispy on the outside while the meat stayed tender. My friend ate up most of that dish.   It might not be dirt cheap eats, but at least it was quality.",

Very average Chinese food if you ask me. The portion control kind of sucked on some dishes, too little meat and too much fillers like veggies. A few dishes were good but nothing stellar. My favorite by far was the deep fried pork chops. Not too bready or fatty, nice portions and great authentic taste. The beef chow fun while tasted good again had way too many sprouts and onions. The place again was packed and very cramped so get ready to be bumped and pushed while you're eating. Las Vegas Chinatown has some really fantastic Asian food, I have yet to have a bad meal there. But KJ Kitchen being the best as people claim? Not even close.",

You're going to need to change your perspective.  This place is the real deal for Chinese food.  I'm from the LA area, and this place seriously reminded me of countless places on Valley blvd or Atlantic (LA ppl, you know what I'm talking about).    So once you've reset your attitude and expectations, then you can really enjoy this place.  Good food at good prices!    The bigger the group the better.  Eat family style and order one thing from each category on the menu: stone pot, sizzling, soup, tofu, etc.  A side of rice and you're set!!  Oh, and one last thing, the service is supposed to be that way, it really is.  You should be worried if it's not!  It's just part of the package deal, not good, not bad...it is what it is.",

They serve all the Chinese dishes from chicken, fish, pork, lobster, noodles, and much more. Every time when me and my family dine in during lunch, dinner, or get take out, the staff knows our faces and treats us like family. The dishes we usually order are: - Orange Chicken - Salt and Pepper Pork Chop - Mandarin Pork Chop - Salt and Pepper Fish Fillet - Seafood Hotpot - Seafood Crispy Noodle - Stringbean with XO sauce and scallops - Roasted Duck with Chinese Steamed Buns  I like eating here because the food is always made fresh to order. The portion here is reasonable and you can get some of the leftovers to go eat the next day. I have gone to this restaurant for over 10 years now not because it's delicious and convenient but also the friendliness of the staff. If you are looking for a new Chinese restaurant that is authentic and serves real Chinese cuisine, try here!",

During the dinner hours, I believe it begins at 4PM, KJ will give you a sort of complementary appetizer and desert, the appetizer being some form of beef broth with other condiments that tastes a lot like oxtail soup. The dessert is usually mung bean dessert soup. I love both of those things a lot and they make it really well here, so that always makes me very happy.   Some of the food here can get expensive, but from what I have seen, the portions are pretty generous. I really love the beef chow fun and crispy egg noodles here! I have a slight aversion to ordering seafood from restaurants because the portion they give you is never worth the amount of money you pay, so I usually order dry noodles with beef or chicken.   I've also ordered duck with rice here before, but that's also a hit or miss in most restaurants and it was the same here; so I haven't ordered it again. The duck meat here is really dry. I personally didn't enjoy it.",

    "text": "After several more dines here, I've been more and more pleased with KJ's.  Allow me to preface this though.  Dining here is the antithesis of elegant fine dining.  In fact, the loud Chinese spoken among the staff clearly reminds you that you're miles away from upscale dining, but rather it adds to the homey and casual ambiance that is embodied by the authentic Cantonese food they serve up.    I've had consistent, authentic, and well prepared food at very inexpensive prices here, both for lunch and dinner.  Service is typical of many Chinese restaurants in this informal caliber.  Efficient, but perfunctory would be suitable adjectives.  One of my favorite and most economical item on the lunch menu is the whole flounder, which can be prepared steamed or fried.  It is frozen, but for the price, can't be beat!  The steamed version certainly isn't as silky and smooth as you'd get from a live whole fish, but it wasn't at all bad for $8.00.  I also enjoyed the deep fried version, since I love the crunchiness of the tail and fins when they're fried.    Lots of traditional home-style dishes, exactly like the ones I grew up with. They are prepared authentically, and at prices that seem like a throw back in time, particularly compared to prices today in comparable San Francisco restaurants. Included is a generous serving of complimentary rice and tea, and for dinner, even a large tureen of a simple complimentary soup.  You may be wondering how they have been able to sustain this profitable and popular venture for so many years.  I think the significantly lower cost of rent in Las Vegas, in conjunction with the lower cost of labor, makes this fiscally feasible.  Well, no point in turning this into a Harvard Business School case study. Just enjoy it while it lasts!",

There was no service. So originally I have this place 4 stars. Loss of the majority of perks means 1 less star. Here comes the other knock down. Their food tasted awful. The fish stomach and egg was watery and it tasted more like salt water. Their pork hock claypot had like 2 chopped up pork hocks with taro. I understand your prices went up but at least keep your quality and portions fair. I would probably not come back because it was a disgrace to Chinese food.",

Of all the Chinese food I have had in Las Vegas, I would say KJ is the closest to where my family and I used to go in Hawaii.  They have the best beef chow fun (dry) in Las Vegas.  I've tried a bunch of places, but this place does it the best.  Here is a list of what I've tried:  Beef chow fun (dry) - excellent.  It is my favorite thing to order! Mongolian beef - really good, has a slight kick, and not sweet like other places. XO string beans w/ scallops - very flavorful XO sauce.  Tons of green beans and a good amount of scallops. Beef with ginger and scallion - the beef that was used is ok, not my favorite cut of meat, but the flavor of the ginger and scallion sauce was tasty. Chicken with black bean sauce - pretty disappointed with this one.  Too much bell peppers and onions for me.  It is the same everywhere, no one does it how I like it. Sizzling tender beef with black pepper sauce - this wasn't too bad.  I think other places do it better, but overall I was satisfied with it.  The dinner menu prices are higher than most other places, but the lunch specials look pretty cheap.  The food here is good, so I don't mind paying more.  I will keep exploring and looking for other good Chinese food in Las Vegas.",

We got the steamed chicken, pea tips with garlic and crab and fish maw soup. They are all good, but for the price which was $15-$20 per plates, it was on par with many other restaurants.  I docked one star because their clam with black bean sauce, the clam was not clean properly, a lot of sand in it and the clams are smaller compared to other Chinese restaurant around.  I docked another star because their fish maw soups were too small in size for $18 per bowl, I was expecting good portions for 6 people, but we are forced to get the second portion because it barely fed 4 people.   Good food, but my suggestion come in for lunch, not dinner.",

The service was great too. Our waiter was very engaged in taking our order and was extremely helpful. He wasn't awkward when coming by to pick up our plates but made conversation which was nice. He even gave us chicken on the house :)  I'd have to say my favorite dish was the beef chow fun with black bean sauce. You can't go wrong with that. The complimentary dessert (sweet red bean soup) was very good and I would come back just for the soup haha.",

I highly recommend the lunch specials.  $6.99 platters that are packed.  They give you a container filled with white rice.  The dinners have exotic meats like duck tongue, venison, and even frog.  I would definitely love to try them.  A little bit on the pricey side but the food is clean and pretty good.  The place gets packed at certain  times.  A lot of people come here eat the fish fillet with Chinese broccoli.  I would also recommend the fish maw soup!   Location is CLEAN, NICE, NEW Staff VERY STRAIGHT FORWARD! MAY SEEM MEAN BUT IT'S THEIR CULTURE. Parking lot is SHARED and SMALL Restrooms CLEAN and FUNNY Seating is Nice and Clean Pricing is PRICEY  * Boomsauce scale. BW = Dis $@% is BASURA! (Garbage). Not recommended. BS = it's just O.K. (experience) BS+ = Yo! I like this place. BS++= That's Whoa! This place good. BS+++= Dayumm! This place is fkn DOPE!",

I'm glad I went to lunch here and found the flounder! Service is great here, very attentive to guests. The wonton soup is also something to rave about! KJ kitchen is definitely not lacking in flavor.

You can get the lunch special to go too.  Suggestions: Pan Fried Whole Flounder Salt and Pepper Pork Chop  Braised String Beans  Salt & Pepper Shrimps   And not on the lunch special but still good : must try Sea Bass Clay Pot.

The outside was too oily and the inside has no taste. The red bean soup they provided after the dinner were not fresh with some sour taste, even the too much sugar cannot hide it. We just tasted a little and left them there. I really don't really understand why such bad restaurant can get four stars.

We ended up ordering drinks from the bus boy, and then again from another waitress.  The restaurant is clean, and there is plenty of room to sit, but that's about it.  There isn't much decor, or music.  The restaurant wasn't busy when we were there, so all we heard was the fish tank filters, and the traffic outside.  The fact that they have a lot of shark fin on the menu is a little unsettling for me as well.  Catching sharks for their fins is cruel, so seeing it on the menu definitely put a damper on my appetite.  I'm not sure how I feel supporting a business that serves shark fin.  It I do return, I will probably just take my order to go.",

    "text": "Alright fellow gamblers, I think i've finally found one of the best Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas. This hidden gem is about a mile or 2 west of Chinatown in a small shopping center.   We started with the Egg Flower soup with crab meat. Yumalicious! I'm not a big vegetable guy, but I loved their garlic spinach. If you like tofu, order the clay pot cooked tofu. It's a great mix with your rice.    Now you gotta get the honey walnut shrimp because it was perfectly glazed and not overly mayo'd out. The walnuts tasted fresh and were well glazed too. For our meat dish, we got the sweet and sour pork which wasn't that great. I would probably order a beef or chicken dish next time.   Finally, these last two items are what you MUST get here. The pan fried crab and the pan fried lobster. I loved the seasoning used in both dishes. You'll be sucking the poor critters shells dry. Don't forget about the egg in the crab shell!    Now for the warning. This place gets packed. The servers and waiters get your food out quick, but your wait will still be from 30 minutes to 1hr. The overall service was good, but they do get extremely busy so you'll have to waive them down a few times.  I suggest getting there a little early. They do open till 2am and they start serving hot pot after 10pm.  So after the casinos give you a nice butt pounding, head for KJ Kitchen for some healing.",

We stopped by for a late lunch on a weekend with our party of four.  * Crispy Deep Fried Bean Curd with Three Ingredients ($9.95) - The three ingredients being shrimp, fish, and scallops.  There were only a few scallops though because I didn't get any.  But the real treat was hot they fried up the tofu.  It was so good.  There's only been one or two other places (in SF) that fry it up that way and it's  yum with a delicate outside crust.  * Ox-Tail with Red Wine ($12.95) - It looked more like pig's feet (which I love anyway) and the best part was the fermented beancurd spread they serve with it.  (I've only seen it in cubes, in a jar, so having it as a spread was just yummy goodness!)  * Beef and Bitter Melon Chow Fun (Wet style) - I'm not a fan of the bitter melon, but my aunts were and they chowed on it.  It was a hearty portion and the chow fun noodles were good enough to eat the next day (without the bitter melon taste on it).  * Lamb Clay Pot ($16.95) - This dish looked more like oxtail stew than lamb, but supposedly it was.  There were also carrots too in it.  It was good, but not my favorite of the dishes.  Those four orders were more than enough for four people, we had plenty of leftovers for sure!   Service was standard, water and tea arrived promptly and we had to wave to get refills.  But overall, everything was fine.  My aunts said the food tasted pretty authentic in their opinion, and it was decent for the most part.  3.5 stars  On another note, when you do walk in, you do see the fish tanks with their live seafood available for sale.  The tanks looked pretty clean to me!  I didn't really notice it until our way out though.",

Decent waiter service for an authenic asian restaurant.  A little bit of a dirty, used feel inside...but the food and price structure for lunch definitely makes it worth the visit.",

The other 5 Asians that work there were setting at a table by the kitchen.  I am not exaggerating when I say they STARED at us the entire time.  It was uncomfortable to say the least.  We were all very nicely dressed and polite.  We ordered three appetizers and three drinks.  The spring rolls were brought out to us burned.  I asked them to please bring us some that was not burned.  The waiter was not rude but when he came back he said the kitchen would not remake them and he would take them off of the bill.  The staring continued!   The food was good that wasn't burned which is the only good thing I can say.  The appearance of the restaurant is questionable and the dead fish in the dirty tanks at the entrance should have made us turn around and leave!  After we left we found out the from 10:00 pm - 2:00 am you get 20% off of your bill.....guess what.....we didn't receive that either!  This was the most uncomfortable eating experience I have ever had.  I don't understand the staring for the entire 45 minutes we were there!  We will never go back to this place!",

We came in a little later in the night, but it still used to be packed all the time.  I also noticed they stopped posting up the menu and specials on the walls...  Anyways, this is still very solid authentic Chinese food.  My friend that does not eat chinese food at all, asked for Orange Chicken since it wasn't on the menu lol.  The waiter replied that they could make something for her, and it came out pretty well....she was a fan.  I always go with salt and pepper shrimp or crab when I am here, and it was still good.  Went with a few other dishes like a sizzling eggplant and beef, pork fried rice, eggplant, and a few others.  A bonus though, we got there right at 10pm and was surprised to see a discount on the tab...20% I believe  One of the best authentic chinese places you will find IMO...give it a shot if you are nearby",

And sometimes my relatives will have a little family gathering in here too. The food is always good, most of them that i have tried are great, and I certainly want to come back here if I'm taking my friends out for Chinese food. One little thing is that, the eggplant hot pot, it tasted like maggi sauce. I like maggi, but not when it's that strong. however... the service wasn't too good... I know I  shouldn't expect much from a Chinese place, especially a Cantonese place(Cantonese is not really a 'polite' language), but I do expect the waiter to be a little bit more polite than usual... He was really rude... I have never have any problem with service when I came here before, but only that one visit, and it made me not wanna go back again. I'm sorry, but if I have a choice, I won't come back here, ever since that visit. Other than that, food is great :) just make sure that waiter doesn't take your order.",

We ordered most of the stuff that other people said were outstanding dishes. Unfortunately, the dishes were not up to par compared to Food Express nor HK Star.  The green beans were wilted, fried food tasted like the oil had been reused for several days(aftertaste and stale), the crispy noodles were soggy(like wet top ramen), the fried rice lacked seasoning, the soup was a little bland, watery, and lacked flavor, etc.  The chef that switched over from Food Express must not have been there that night because we didn't have the best cooking like the others experienced.  The only dishes that came out well were the shrimp chowmein soft noodles and the deep fried tofu with three ingredients.  As for the service, we received good service so we tipped well. Sorry KJ Kitchen but we were not won over.",

    "text": "In the last couple of years, as some family members have moved to Vegas, I've been exploring more of the west side of Vegas, away from the strip, and KJ Kitchen is one of those gems hidden in Chinatown.   I had tried a number of restaurants in the Vegas Chinatown area and wasn't really impressed, but KJ Kitchen was an exception, and by far the best Chinese food I've had in the area.   There's a bit of a wait usually if you come for dinner, but the food is worth it. I've come here a couple of times with big parties and we're always left satisfied. Mainly Chinese customers, and the portions are big and prices reasonable. One of the best things on the menu is the roasted duck. The skin is always crispy and the meat isn't dry at all. In fact, my local friend comes here almost every week and orders the duck. The salt and pepper pork chops, mu shu pork, sitr fried noodles, sichuan style green beans, and a lot of the seafood dishes are always money. I haven't tried everything on the menu but it seems like it's hard to go wrong with anything here.  KJ Kitchen isn't the best food I've ever had, and I'm not a local, but it's the best Chinese food I've had in Vegas!",

I had a yen for wonton soup after driving six hours from Tehachapi; looking for soothing comfort food. The Wor Won Ton was filled with beef, & satisfied but I wish they added some chestnuts (for crispness) and some shrimp & pork. As an Asian kid I remember fondly how great this combo tasted in LA Chinatown. Still, for a restaurant that stays open until 2 am the quality of my soup tasted wonderful. Previously I ate at The Rio & both serve dim sum. The Rio serves dim sum into the evening, KJ Kitchen stops in the afternoon. There is always a higher ratio of Asians to mainstream America. This is my visual test for good Chinese food. Sort of seeing lots of trucks parked in parking lot along I -5 in the boonies. My night waiter was very friendly. His name is \"Long\" an older gentleman, crew cut. I took an appetizer of salted chicken wings back to my Best Western room. The honey walnut shrimp looked great, FYI.

If you want authentic cantonese food this is the spot.  Me being the seasoned white girl in any asian situation, I was intimidated but went forth.  As I looked around I saw more and more ethnicities.  This is authentic Chinese food and service, if you want the nice smiling waitress at your beck and call don't come here but if you want great food fast service and hold your glass up for water you go t the right place!  I have been to China and if they are to nice you usually leave because that means the food sucks!  Oxymoron in that one huh?!  So the food is great and in large portions the menu is easy to maneuver with pictures and descriptions.  The menu is expansive so I will not waste your time I do however suggest the seasonal veggie no matter what it is, it is always a winner!  They also have the really hard to maneuver menu if you would like to try.  Everything on it is hard core Cantonese and even my father inlaw couldn't remember some... LOL   Highly recommend, if you haven't been just study the menu for a bit let it speak to you.  I think you will be happy :)",

    "text": "The indisputable place to go in Vegas in order to get your Cantonese cravings (excluding dim sum) fulfilled.  Went here on a Sunday evening and there was a line of Chinese folks filed outside the door both when our group arrived and as we were leaving.   This is always a good sign since discriminating palates of Cantonese cuisine are very much attuned to a dish's \"wok hay\", which is a transient flavor that a dish can only encapsulate for the first few minutes after the dish leaves the hot scalding wok and arrives at your table.  With the constant turnover, dishes are constantly being plated and are forced to be rushed over to the tables to keep the lines moving.    My first trip here we ordered the following.  Clams with mint- kind of a misnomer since the mint is actually Thai basil, but this was a definite home run.  Clams were large and fresh, perfectly cooked, and seasonings well-balanced with Thai basil, soy, ginger, and garlic.  Another clear sign of a good dish is when one is almost tempted to take home the sauce after all the clams have been consumed just to top over leftover rice (someone in our group seriously thought long and hard about this but ultimately felt too shameful in the end)  Salt and pepper squid-  a Canton staple (I've heard the pork and shrimp variations are also exquisite), don't let the name fool you since this is more like crack-salt and crack-pepper squid.  Calimari is a poor man's version of this dish as far as I am concerned, since the tempura-like batter just barely drapes around the tender pieces of squid, and one can regulate added bursts of flavor by picking up pieces of jalapeno peppers and garlic with each wondrous bite.     Seafood clay pot with tofu-  not particularly mindblowing, but a solid dish that provides flavorful pieces of fish, and pan-fried soft tofu, along with some napa cabbage, shrimp, and squid in a flavorful gravy.  The pieces are a bit large and not evenly distributed, and I have definitely had better renditions of this dish, so will likely not be placing this one on future rotations.    Will likely try to mix it up with some non-seafood offerings next trip (including salt-pepper pork, cantonese fried noodles, and perhaps one of the beef dishes served on a fajita-like plate tableside).  Prices are definitely reasonable for quantity of food, unless you are choosing a seafood dish at \"market price\" (what insanely expensive market are they shopping at?!)  Definitely a place to pacify Asian parents and snobby Chinese foodies from San Fran or LA, so if you don't fall under either category, you know it's going to be pretty damn good.   Have to warn you that the service can be a little apathetic and inconsistent, but as long as the food is consistently delivered with wok hay, I'm willing to let some things slide!",

Everything was very tasty and the portion size was reasonable.  When we ate here this time the restaurant was still busy, but the service wasn't as speedy as the first time.  The portion size have been reduced significantly and the dishes weren't as tasty this time around.     Salt and pepper pork chops  The batter on the pork chops were a little on the soggy side and the pork itself was chewy.  Not a good combination, although the taste was okay.   Stir fried Chinese broccoli The broccoli was a little too firm for my liking.   Stewed Oxtail in red wine sauce The oxtail could have been cooked a little longer.  Taste was okay.   Crispy Fried Chicken The chicken was not as juicy as it could be, but not a bad attempt at this dish.     Overall 3 stars, one star taken away from the smaller portions and another star taken away for the overall taste of the dishes.",

This would be a good place to go with a group of friends and order a bunch of different items.  The fish tanks with the pathetic sea creatures was interesting.  Do they prepare the dead fish just floating there??? I don't think I would feature this in the front of a restaurant.  It is far from appetizing.  Anyways - I like this place.

With all the competitions and big names out in sin city, this classic gem is the place to go for Chinese food. First of all They close at 2 am, perfect for my coworkers and I to get a late night meal after work. They have a wide variety of  food, from the run of the mill to very exotic bites.  The prices are fantastic and the service is quick and easy.  Last week I took my friends there and we ordered Mongolian beef, jelly fish, salt and pepper squid, kung poq chicken, hong kong style noodles, pork chow mein, half of a bbq duck and walnut shrimp.  Everything came out quickly and nice and hot.  Hands down the best Chinese food you will get in vegas.",

    "text": "I came here on Chinese New Year Day, the whole restaurant was fully packed. That's one way to prove how good and authentic the food is ! Luckily we made a reservation so the table is ready as soon as we were there. One thing I do have to point out in regard of the service is that there is no hostess stand by the entrance so in order to get a table, I pretty much walked inside the restaurant and got someone's attention to look up the reservation for me. But again this is not a restaurant in a casino on the strip so customer service might be a little bit off , plus it is Chinese New Year, everybody working was super busy.   A server came to the table within minutes after we all sat down and handed us menus. Each of us ordered an entree and we shared just like the way it is in traditional chinese dinner. Everybody's favourite is marinated pork belly which was actually recommended by the server. Homemade chicken in Claypot is everybody's least favourite as the chicken has too many bones. Chinese broccoli is yummy as well as the string beans and beef stir fry.   The dinner comes with complimentary seasonal Cantonese Soup and White Rice so unless you are ordering any shark fin or chicken corn soup, they will give you a big bowl of soup and you can refill as many times as you want. At the end of the dinner, the server also gives us complimentary sweet red bean soup as desert. I am not sure if you get desert if it is not a holiday but it is surely yummy !   After all we enjoyed the meal and had a good time. Being someone came straight from Guangzhou, China, I will say this is one of the most authentic chinese restaurant off the strip (cantonese style) with moderate pricing. We will definitely come back !",

    "text": "Man it is hard to give a Chinese restaurant 5 stars. It really is. But then again this is probably THE best in Las Vegas. So when talking about price, service, taste, and quality, and the cleanliness of the restroom, I have to give these guys 5 stars since I have been going to them in one form or another since they were the dinky hole in the wall next to Fantastik Swap Meet, which used to be Fantastik Furniture for the longest time. The service is not bad although sometimes they suck. But then again it's a Chinese restaurant. It's in their culture. Yup I am solely planted in this culture too by birth. They are rude as heck to me in some of these places too so don't think they are being racist. They are equally bad to people. I even cough up a few Chinese words to make it look legit at least. But to no avail most of the time. Anyway, the food is the tastiest, and if people ask me who the best Chinese is I always say them. The door used to be lined with people out the door around 7pm every day and twice on Friday and Saturday (whatever that means). The fancy schmancy restaurants on the Strip like Hakasan and Winglei will send you to the poor house but their food is not tastier. I think you just tell yourself that it is, because of the ridiculous prices that they charge. You walk in with a BMW (no, I am not one of those who drives one, just a figure of speech) and will leave in a tricycle with your better half straddling the 2 wheels in the back and you won't feel any fuller. I promise. You know it's bad when the cooks tell you not to eat there and that it's no better than the best ones in Chinatown. (But hey, maybe you are a cyclist and wouldnt mind.)  Some favorites here that I like are ginger scallion oysters (please don't accidentally get the fried one that I have gotten once, it's bland as heck. All they did was throw it into the deep fryer), clams with onions & black bean sauce, beef broccoli, and their hot pots. I like their jellyfish too (appetizer). They have things like duck tongue and chicken feet but even I am not that adventurous to try it more than once so you may want to refrain. If you never had it order it. The jellyfish is a crunchy affair but tasty(I don't know why the literal translation is ocean sperm). It is usually served with a little bit of hot pepper. Believe me there's no hot flavors here. It's Cantonese cuisine. Their definition of hot is less than the Taco Bell hot sauce. Prawns, shrimp in salt and pepper, roast duck, chow fun, and Hong Kong style dry noodle are very tasty. All their veggies, aka choys, are very good too. I usually like the yu choy, ong choy, broccoli (I think other non-Chinese call them Chinese broccoli but it's just broccoli in my family), and the snow pea leaf (actually, I cant remember the proper name for the life of me, I think it's called yam leaves maybe? it's seasonal but tasty as heck). The old reliable ma po tofu is good but the other one that's cooked in cubes and has some shrimp or something in the middle is pretty bland. You have been warned.  I used to love the flounder that is steamed. But I never seem to order it correctly now. Since my Chinese is terrible I always end up with the wrong one now. When I ask my mom to order since she can talk and read, it is of no help either because she is ignorant about cuisine unfortunately. They used to have this boiled shrimp which seems bland but it was actually good. It's tasty because of the natural flavor of fresh shrimp that was recently boiled. But it is bland if you do not care for the actual shrimpy taste. I'd stay away from the red snapper or whatever that fish with the giant head is. It's pricey but there is no meat and it really is just a hunk of fish meat that lacks any flavor compared to the flounder.  And if you ask my dad to order he gets the pork chops and shrimp in lobster sauce. The lobster sauce isn't lobster either BTW (why is it called lobster sauce? In no way does it taste any thing like a lobster). Sorry. However, the lobsters here are cooked very well. It's got the nice little corn starch gravy and cooked in giner, scallions, and heaping chunks of green onion. It's good and not overpriced. Yes Gringo food. Then again what do you expect a Gringo from Glendale to order? So, as you can see, I solely give these guys 5 stars because I like their food and their service is not bad MOST of the time. As far as smiles are concerned, yeah don't press your luck. We used to have an old timer guy who was the host here who we fondly referred to as \"sourpuss\" when we came in. That should be an indication.",

Scallops in black bean sauce on a sizzling plate were a bit salty but we enjoyed.  Their Kung Pao chicken might be the best I have ever had. I don't like dishes that are spicy just for the sake of being spicy. In this case the spice enhanced the flavor.  We had a leafy green vegetable (can't remember what specifically it was) with garlic. Also excellent.   I have read reviews that kill the service here. We had no issues. But I can speak a very lityle bit of Chinese and I think that helped. They knew I was not just a tourist who doesn't know Chinese food.   Don't go for the ambiance. But definitely go for the foid.",

When we got here, there was a long line outside waiting to be seated. I was told they gave free soup and half a chicken with your dinner. Along with complimentary dessert soup. Could by why they are pretty popular with the asian crowd. We also ordered 5 other items.  Jelly fish & squid with XO sauce: this dish was interesting. My mom's friend ordered this because she wanted to know what jellyfish tasted like stir fried. I would probably not order this again. It tasted okay, but it has some weird textures.  Clam with chinese basil: this dish was pretty good. I've never had clams cooked with basil before but basil goes very well with this dish. Recommended =]  Honey Walnut Shrimp: this is usually my all time favorite dish at chinese restaurants, so I had to order it. I'm glad I did, I loved it. There was enough of the mayo sauce on the shrimp and it tasted great. The walnuts on the plate were also very good. Also recommend this dish! =] Probably my favorite plate of the night.  Sweet and Sour Pork Chop: this was okay. The sauce was good but I didn't really like how meat was really fatty.   I don't really remember what the last dish was called but it was some sort of cucumber stir fry with crab meat. Which ever it was, I would not recommend. It was very forgettable since I can't even remember what the dish was.   Service was pretty fast for a chinese restaurant. They came to refill our teapots very quickly. I would probably come back again when I'm in vegas =]",

This is contrary to American waiters that are generally more cordial. Believe me, you get treated better at McDonald's.

Mind you we are doing this in different cars coming from opposite directions and I only sort of know the area.  So I drove right by the place looking on the wrong side of the street.  We ended up meeting and leaving both cars at Walgreens as were were only 2 doors away.  There is a reason Asian restaurants are open on Christmas, Asians want to go out to eat.  The lobby was full but because there were only two of us instead of a family of 6 or more like most of the groups we were seated in less than 15 minutes.  We ordered potstickers, Kung Pao chicken and crispy noodles with shrimp.  The portions were large and with the exception of not much spicy heat in the Kung Pao they were very well prepared. After we were done eating Angela took home at least half of what was served.  Understandably it took the kitchen a while to get our orders up.  In spite of the place being packed with a waiting line most of the time we were there we never felt rushed.  And after all the food the bill was very reasonable.    Overall one of the better Chinese restaurants I have been to.",

Even though the restaurant was full, the waitresses and busboy was very fast and efficient.  The food came fast with decent proportions.  The salt and pepper chicken wings and pan fried flounder were crispy and delicious.  The other dishes were also very good.  This restaurant has good quality Cantonese food and is above average compared to other Cantonese restaurants in Las Vegas Chinatown.  I would definitely try it again when we go back to Las Vegas.",

Lucky for us KJ Kitchen popped up on the search list and gave us everything that we were looking for last night.   When we arrived to the restaurant at 8:30 we were seated right away and given a very large and extensive menu.  The prices usually fell into the range of $10-$16 and the service was solid.  All dinners seem come tea, an appetizer soup, and a yellow bean dessert.  We ordered a variety of dishes: oyster clay pot, roast duck, gai-lan (Chinese broccoli), and Singapore style noodles.  The dishes had ample portions (needless to say we definitely had leftovers) and everything tasted great.    I have no doubt that I will be back in the future.",

When we finally flagged someone down to take our order (I'm guessing the owner), the first thing he said to us was \"HURRY UP!  HURRY UP!\" before we even ordered.   Our first dish came with a LONG HAIR chilling on the side of the plate. It was so noticeable that I saw the hair when they were bringing our dish over.  That is just RUDE that they were too lazy to wipe it off. The server watched me pick out the hair and didnt say anything. I was contemplating about taking a picture of the hair but I was afraid they would spit in my food. Nice first impression.    Food was okay but the fried fish was the best deal for $7! This is the only reason it got two stars. Not sure if I will go back yet, but I'm not craving the hair and snow peas combo right now.",

    "text": "Upon reading the reviews on Yelp, I decided to bring my parents here for lunch when we arrived in Vegas the first day - my parents are the type that only likes to eat Asian food - actually Chinese food to be exact and so I was obliged to find a good Chinese place in Vegas. It was about 2pm when I got here and they were still busy so I took it as a good sign.  However, it didn't quite live up to what I expected.. I didn't have that high of expectations to begin with since I know we are in Vegas and it's not like they are known for Chinese food...but I didn't expect that poor of quality either.  To begin with - the service was okay - I mean I didn't expect much from an Asian place - and they only had like two waitress/waiter and it was busy - so you can imagine that they would forget to bring you things you asked for until you asked about 7-8 times.   The food was ehhh - I was kind of disappointed because on their online menu they offered Deer meat but they didn't have that on their menu when we got there - only the ordinary stuff - I really did wanted to try Deer meat with mushroom and sacha sauce but they didn't have any dish that offered deer meat so not sure what that's about.  So instead we order three dishes: Salt and pepper fried shrimp, clay pot chicken and pork crispy chow mein noodles.   The salt and pepper fried shrimp was small and over-fried. The clay pot chicken - didn't have a lot of chicken and the chicken was chopped up in very little pieces it was difficult to eat - there was more mushrooms than chicken. The only dish I thought was fairly decent was the pork crispy chow mein noodles - but then again it wasn't very crispy - they slathered the sauce all over it so it became soggy instead but at least the flavor was okay.  Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.",

I've tried different items including the lobster, salt and pepper squid, bitter melon with pork, sizzling satay beef platter, fish... etc.  The stuff here is authentic.  This place even has my dad's seal of approval, and trust me, that says a lot.  My dad is from Hong Kong and he loves to complain at every Chinese restaurant he eats at because it does not measure up to the food back in Hong Kong.   Well, he surprisingly did not complain at KJ when I took him there.   The service here can be crap though, so if you have a hard time dealing with subpar service, proceed with caution.  Especially if you are not Asian.  I've been here a few times with Caucasian friends and noticed differential treatment.  They don't give non-Asians at the table chopsticks; you have to ask for them. Also, the servers sometimes seem angry when you ask them for something.  Example:   Me: Excuse me, can I have some water?  (in a very polite manner) Waiter: *Gives a dirty look and walks away.  Comes back a few minutes later with the water*  It may sound kind of awful, but I'm used to rudeness at Chinese restaurants and can overlook it if the food is good.",

The XOXO Green Beans were bomb; the Hong Kong Style Noodles were great;  gravylicious just like I like and the Salt and Pepper Pork Chops were juicy and crispy and not too oily .

However, the waitress that waited on us at this restaurant tops the list for the worst service ever. It was ok when we first walked in at 2:45.  The restaurant was not busy at all and we were greeted promptly by a waiter who seated us.  Then it started going downhill.  First, the waiter brought us the dinner menu instead of the lunch special menu. So I asked the waiter if the lunch specials were still available.  He initially replied no but changed his mind and brought us the lunch menu a minute later and said we had to order by 3.  We decided what to order in a few minutes but the  waiter was no where to be seen by then. We waited patiently and finally a waitress emerged from the kitchen and we waved her down to take our order.  She was very cold and unwelcoming and never once smiled at us during the rest of our meal. She seemed to be angry when she was taking our orders so I thought she had a bad day.  However, she seemed to be in a good mood when she was chatting and giggling away at the table next to us with another employee the rest of our meal. Needless to say, our ice waters were never refilled and empty plates were not cleared away as we finished them and she never came over to see if we needed anything else. She seemed more interested in chatting with her coworker than waiting on us.  The food on the other side was pretty good and that's the reason I am giving them 2 stars.  It was better than the 2 other Chinese restaurants we've tried the previously 2 nights. Personally, I would not come back here again.",

We started out with some free house soup.  Was very good.    Then we had a fried quail.  Pretty tasty.  It needed to be just a tad more crispy, then it would have been perfect.  Next up was some string beans stir fried with minced pork.  Flavor was wonderful, homey and not very salty.  After that we had some stirfried veggies.  That was good too.  There was actually asparagus in there too!  Rarely do you find that in a chinese restaurant.  We didn't order any meat dishes, but we did get some seabass.  They cut it in chunks, lightly battered and fried.  Then it's cooked together with some tofu and veggies in the clay pot.  Very tasty!  They also gave us free house dessert.  It was green bean with tapioca sweet soup.  Yes, sounds nasty but it's pretty good!    Will definitely go back with friends & family the next time we're back in Vegas.",

Only after I showed them a newspaper advertisement they finally gave me the lunch special menu. Later I saw some local people come in and they got the lunch menu right away. I think they tried to trick me because I was a tourist. The food was good though.",

Tables of 4 and 9 dominate the scene with an army of waiters constantly bringing out freshly prepared authentic Chinese Cuisine. My personal favorite is the Whole Crispy Garlic Chicken. It is chopped to perfection and served with fresh blanched scallions (my mouth is watering as I write this review). Yet another lesson learned by \"don't judge a book by its cover.\"",
