Our server, Camille, didn't seem like she knew the menu fully, despite the fact that they only have few items on their menu. We had to repeat our orders several times, but without us having to actually point at the menu, she didn't seem to understand us. However, since it's a newly opened restaurant, that was not a big deal.   The stars are for their food. Their broth is full of oil and fat. There is rarely any flavor a ramen eater would expect from it. Just refer to most of the other reviews, and trust me, they are not exaggerating.   There are so many other choices in Vegas for ramen. I am just disappointed that the only ramen location in Southwest area is a place that I will probably never return to.",

The ramen is decent, but it is nowhere near the level of quality I expect from the Monta family. The worst offense is the broth.  Whether it's tonkotsu, shoyu, or miso, they all have little floating bits of pork/chicken fat swimming in the bowl that are nauseating to say the least.  At Monta, you can tell they take the time to prepare the broth by boiling the bone marrow, which results in a creamy and consistent texture and flavor.  I feel like Ramen Kobo is simply cutting corners by adding extra fat to an otherwise unexceptional broth. I give it two stars because the noodles and toppings were all great, but the broth ruined it for me and my girlfriend.  tl;dr Go to Monta or Monta Chaya instead!  They're much better!",

This is the only place that has the word \"spicy\" done right. We are always in search for really spicy ramen, but the other ramen places that claim their noodles are spicy just have like chili flakes for you to add on. Not ramen kobo; their \"fire\" spicy level is no joke, especially for the shoyu ramen. I like that although it is extremely spicy, the spiciness is not too overwhelming that you can't taste the flavor! Beware when you order the spicy level! If you're unsure whether you can handle the spiciness, you can always ask them to have the spice on the side so you can slowly add it in. All in all, my bf and I have been coming here at least once a week for the past half year and we will continue to go here to get our weekly fix of authentic spicy ramen!",

This was to avoid having to wait longer and the hostess was kind enough to ask first if it would be ok (2 adults 3 kids). With that being said, the menu is very straight forward and service is fairly quick which helps minimize the wait time for other parties.   As for the food, I've tried the Tonkotsu and the Miso. Both were flavorful and in my opinion, was served with a good ratio of broth to noodles. The noodles are made fresh of which you have the opportunity to watch as they are being made while you wait to be seated. The meat portion is rather small and have to pay more if you would like to add extra toppings. This will bump up the base price of the ramen another $1.50 to $2.50 for each item you add on.  Overall Ramen KoBo is very good with friendly and fast service. I will definitely return especially now that winter is right around the corner.",

    "text": "Convenient location with ample parking space! Definitely a plus when compared to Monta on Spring Mountain. :)  I went around lunch on opening day, so there was no wait and we were seated right away. The place is nice and small, like a lot of ramen places in town. You are greeted by everyone once you walk in, and to the right, you can see the workers making fresh noodles! Since this restaurant faces West, I'd hate to be making noodles with the sun blazing in my eyes.  We were asked what we wanted to drink shortly after sitting down (Got our usual water with lemon). The waiter had to check if they had lemon slices. xD I don't blame them, since it IS their opening day, and still pretty early on, so I'm guessing they are still trying to figure things out. They didn't have any :( But hopefully they will in the future.  We had a party of 4, and I had the original shoyu ramen (no spicy) with nitamago. Each both of ramen (minus the vege ramen) comes with chashu pork, fried garlic, kikurage black mushrooms, bamboo shoots, fresh green chives, ground pork, sesame oil, and shredded red pepper. The broth was fatty and flavorful; a perfect five stars. The fresh homemade ramen - that's what makes this review a 4 star. It's not that the ramen was bad, it's just not really to my liking. I'm more of a fan of the thick noodles from Monta, which has a completely different texture. Also, even after soaking the noodles in the broth for a while, it still tasted a bit bland. On the other hand, the chashu pork had a great fat to meat ratio, and they actually had a whole clove of fried garlic in my broth. Yum. =] Also, the nitamago was cooked to soft-boiled perfection. Gotta love that runny yolk! The black mushrooms, bamboo shoots, fresh green chives, ground pork, etc are as expected. No complaints there.  I also got to try the broth of the Miso ramen with Hot spicy (level three spicy of four). There was a kick to it, but it faded quickly and didn't linger like a lot of other spicy foods. So even if you can't handle spicy like me, you should be okay with a level one or two spicy.  I'll be back to try the other broths as well as the rice. Keep it up!",

    "text": "This was my first ramen experience here in Las Vegas. It's pretty close spaced inside with a single walk through between a row of table seatings on the left and bar seating on the right. The menu is simple. Service is brief & straightforward yet accommodating. Not the friendliest crew I've seen yet not hostile either. Our server was attentive despite the busy hours.   Itadakimasu!! (..did i spell that right?!) My tonkatsu ramen on medium spice which I ordered with corn, egg, and butter was delicious. Reasonably spicy. Their kimchi fried rice wasn't that spicy and it had a dried fish flavor to it rather than kimchi. I did like it. At the end we all left with satisfied stomachs. I recommend.   Just don't be offended if the servers don't smile at you.",

Basic Tonkatsu extra noodles is simple yet satisfying enough to make you want more the next week.  We still enjoy other places (Jinya, Sora, Fukumimi, Tatsu, Monta, Kokoro, Moko) but this is the one I would recommend to anyone wanting or even craving a solid bowl of tasty Ramen being their first or hundred time. Service is second to non, food and sides come out like there's no tomorrow, fast and hot! Very courteous and a sense of urgency every time we come here.  Workers set the standard for service for me and the only drawback is the hit and miss waiting time, but that's always a good thing because everyone knows this is the Best Ramen on the whole west side of Vegas.",

I've ordered those on both times I went and I have nothing but praise for it. It's very fresh and the rice isn't hard or too sticky, just perfect. It's a little unfortunate that I didn't care much for their ramen because their customer service here is fantastic.",

Tried miso spicy with spinach and soy soy cured egg add-on's and a vegetable ramen with black garlic oil. Both were very flavorful and the medium spicy was just enough to get your nose running by the end of it. Service was very fast and courteous. For $8.95 a medium sized bowl of tasty ramen is a great deal. Definitely coming back.",

    "text": "Went here two days back-to-back. The first time was for a late-night dinner and the second time was right before dinner rush. Both times had excellent flavor of ramen. Well-seasoned, miso and tonkatsu broth soups was extremely flavorful! Noodles were thin and it was the perfect portion.   Service was attentive. Food came out fairly quick. The only couple things that stops me giving this 4 stars is the fact that my bowl came out lukewarm to barely warm. My extra chashu was also cold in my soup. I'm talking like freshly sliced and pulled from the fridge type of cold. I figured whatever, it's still freaking delicious, it's also really, really busy on a weekend an hour before closing.   The next day, I'm still craving ramen, so my friend and I go in and we order. I get a miso broth with mild spiciness, extra chashu, and nori. Same thing happens, chashu is less cold (still feels it was refrigerated) this time and ramen broth is still just warm, not hot. Like it's been sitting out for a while.   Both times, the pork chashu was just so-so, kind of flavorless. I'm not going to get a third time. Soft boiled eggs I had in my ramen both times were good, flavorful, perfectly made.   I know I could have said something, but I didn't want to be known as \"that person\". I'm not a picky eater by any means either. The ramen is still amazing, service was fantastic, but I can't really overlook the  barely warm ramen. I don't need it scalding hot, just maybe a bit hotter like ramen should be. I'm still definitely coming back, and maybe I caught them on another off night. Or maybe a customer complained that the ramen was too hot before? I still recommend this place as a good casual eat, but I don't know about taking someone that's a bit more pickier than I am.  EDIT: Glad I'm not the only one that thinks the same thing about the cold chashu and broth.",

Fortunately, my two person party was seated immediately as a two person table had just opened up. The menu is simple, much like other ramen restaurants. The only options are shoyu, miso, tonkotsu, and veggie. The thing this ramen-ya prioritizes is spice, and the spice range goes from none to extreme. I got the least spicy of the spicy ramens, but it was still plenty hot. Also, the ramen bowls come with some toppings, but things some people consider commonplace like nori and egg are add-ons. The service is quick and prompt, as they have lots of people to feed. Once you get your food, you chow down immediately so all the people waiting can eat too. The noodles, which were made there, were  (exquisite). The spice that they added was obviously oily, as it separated from the miso broth I got. This meant you had to stir a lot. Still, this place gave some very tasty, spicy, and addictive ramen. I will probably be back when it isn't as crowded.",

    "text": "Most Vegas residents aren't familiar with the Japanese chain known as Tenkaippin Ramen, but if you are, Ramen Kobo's tonkotsu broth is practically a dead ringer.  They totally nailed the unique, thick, gravy-like pork broth that made me feel I could've been at one.  There are a ton of people that love this, but I am not one of them.  Despite the noodles being decent and that one meager slice of pork chashu (don't bother with the chashu chicken) tasting good, this simply did not give me the \"kimochi\" I was looking for.      For those that dislike the amount of sodium usually associated with Japanese ramen, both the tonkotsu and the light shoyu broth should please.  That 5000 mg aftertaste many experience often won't happen here.  I felt obligated to add spice, since it was something they push here, but it didn't improve much for me.  Order it on the side and do what your heart tells you.  Mine told me not to use it.    It was strange that gyoza wasn't on the menu.  I asked and also overheard two of the neighboring tables ask as well.  Why not just give the people what they want?  In the end, it's better than Omoide, but not as good as Sora or Jinya.  One and done.      2.984743874 stars",

They have levels of spice to their broth starting from no spicy to FIRE. I stick with the \"medium\" level and that is already pretty spicy to me. From hearing other people order and hearing my friends order, a lot of people get \"mild\" spice so I would start with that level first. Their broth is so tasty and their noodles are good as well. They actually hand make their noodles so maybe that plays a role as to why it's so good haha. Their service is also good, the waiters are always so nice and on top of that it's quick. It's also not too expensive, it's probably around the same price as other ramen places so if you want good quality ramen, please try this place!",

It has bar seating and also a good amount of tables. I have never had to wait for seating so far. It has all the basic broths; miso, shoyu, tonkatsu and vegetarian. Then you are able to pick your spice levels and extra toppings. I always order the miso ramen anywhere I go and add the boiled egg. So good!  Now the miso ramen here comes with charsu pork slices AND some form of ground meat. Not sure if it's ground chicken or pork. Either way it's good lol. The broth has been a little too watery for my taste so I find myself adding A LOT of that orange ramen seasoning (which I still don't know the name of) and sesame seeds.   Although I still like Monta just a taaad bit more, I like how this is super close to me and I can get my ramen fix without having to suffer going all the way to Chinatown :D",

To enhance the flavor adding chili to the dashi is not the way to go but they do it a lot and they only have four (4) different types of ramen.  We call this type of soup in Hawaii saimin which means noodle dish and this place doesn't even compare.  They need more variety in their dishes and cut out the chili by making the dashi (soup base) more presentable.  Will I go back...don't think so.",

Nice flavorful broth. Spicy level was just right, and could taste the food (unlike some, where it's so spicy, that's all you notice). Some people might think the shoyu ramen looks a bit oily, but I thought it was ok. (Maybe if you let it go cold, you could see the grease more - no chance of that for me - my bowl was gone like that!) I was a bit disappointed with the lack of hot tea (warming up canned tea doesn't count). I would recommend this place though, and am looking forward to trying some of the other ramen dishes.",

This is not traditional but I don't  think this was their intention. They make their noodles in house. The noodles taste good but is again not traditional ramen noodle..it is starchy. If anyone has tried Korean Chinese food, the noodles most resembles that.   One can choose from a variety of broth and they come with a little bit of toppings. I wouldn't suggest adding extras unless you want an egg. I like spicy so I had spicy miso (medium spicyness). It was good and tasted like jampong. I ordered miso broth for my kids. This is where they miss the mark. Because the noodles were starchy,  their soup became thick and starchy. This least resembles Japnese ramen broth which is light in texture and flavorful.   I also ordered a small wgg roe rice (see pic) which I enjoyed but also not traditionally Japanese. The egg roe they use is is a Korean egg roe which is salty. I still liked it. The rice with pork was a good optiom for kids.  The place is small. They had to split us.",

It's been awhile since I've been to Monta, but the noodles here are fresh made and are definitely al dente when they arrive.  The noodles remind me of a compromise between the thin and wavy noodles at Monta.  Broth is similar to Monta tonkatsu broth and very thick and rich.  The pork seems the same, extremely fatty and tender.  The unfortunate part is this place is just as tiny as the Chinatown Monta =(  I think they should expand, so the customers don't have to wait forever for a table on cold wintery nights =)",

Let me at least tell you the good things:  1) Noodles - Handmade right there and quite delicious. Great texture.  2) Ground Pork - Flavorful and tasty.  3) Mushrooms - Good texture.   Now, this all sounds great to start but we are missing one vital component to ramen: THE BROTH. The broth had absolutely ZERO flavor. There was no salt on the table for me to add. As I started looking around I could see that everyone was adding everything they could to this broth. You need chili paste, garlic, soy sauce, etc. It is simply not worth it. It was very disappointing and turned me off to the ramen craze everyone is so gung ho about these days. I will try another place and see if I can be swayed in a more positive direction. I see a lot of people giving this place a positive review so maybe I am crazy but neither myself or the people I was with enjoyed it.",

Although the place was small, I was quite impressed with how well the staff was at handling the seating situation. I've never seen anyone wait longer than ten minutes!  Right when you walk in and get seated, the server says something in Japanese... not sure what, I'm assuming it's along the lines of \"New meat coming thru..\" lol or more like \"Welcome our guests..\" and then the entire staff responds back in Japanese with a welcome! I'm not sure, but it's pretty cool. So you order a ramen bowl by the broth & all the bowls come with the same things. You can take things out & then add things for an additional price. They also have a spiciness level... so if you're not into spice at all I would stick to original.  Our friends ordered their favorite shoyu ramen bowl & added a few things. My husband & wanted to stay close to home just ordered a pork tonkotsu (pork broth) ramen & I got the miso (pork & chicken broth) ramen. They also got their own pork belly bowls, but hubby & I decided to share.  I have to say the broth was rich, the noodles were fresh (they make them in-house), & it was pretty delicious. I loved the pork belly bowl though because it was super fatty & the taste was light but extremely yummy.... the fatty goodness from the fried pork belly soaked thru the rice & mmmm, it was delicious.  Not a ramen person, more of a pho lover but I would come back here every so often just for something different.",

    "text": "Probably more of a 3.5 star rating, I'm a fan of Kobo's noodles and broths, but the sometimes cold (and stingy) chashu and nitamago can really dampen the experience.  My understanding is that Ramen Kobo is somehow affiliated with Monta Ramen, being opened by the same team of people.  Although Monta was one of the original ramen spots in Vegas, I stopped going because I wasn't a fan of their thin noodles or their super salty broths.  Both of those things are fixed for me at Ramen Kobo, where you can see them make their thick, chewy noodles and add in some spice to your tonkotsu, shoyu, miso, or vege broths.  My favorite has been the miso ramen with mild spicyness, which seems to prove that I'm a big wuss when it comes to spice...anything higher than mild and I'm quite sure I won't be enjoying my ramen.  The few things that I'm not a fan of are sort of big things when it comes to a good bowl of ramen.  By default, a bowl only comes with one slice of chashu.  You can add more for $2.50, but then that turns your $8.95 bowl of ramen into an $11.45 bowl of ramen.  Also by default, your bowl does not come with any egg, but you can add one nitamago for $1.50, turning your already $11.45 bowl of ramen into a $12.95 bowl of ramen.  These things might seem nitpicky because I'm choosing to add these ingredients, but other shops in town offer these things for $7-$10 by default, no need to add them.  There have also been several times where the added chashu and egg are cold, as if they came straight from the refrigerator and were tossed on top of my ramen right before being served; no bueno.  Overall an upgrade from the original Monta Ramen, as well as a decent ramen spot in a part of town that didn't have any ramen spots before.",

    "text": "i'm not usually one to write bad reviews however, this experience left a bad taste in my mouth and a damper on my evening. my boyfriend & i had been planning to get ramen here because it's always amazing. we haven't been here for a while so we assumed it would be business as usual. we get there and it seemed pretty busy, which was understandable. we had gotten a seat at the bar because it was the first available. we ordered with the server a veggie ramen, tonkatsu ramen bowl, and 2 chasu pork bowls with mild spice. we got our ramen pretty fast, before our chasu bowls. we tasted the ramen first and it was definitely not mild. it may have just been us but every time we get mild spice it's super flavorful without bringing too much heat... this wasn't the case for that. however the biggest qualm i have is when we received 2 chasu pork buns from our server, Marielos. we had to get her attention before she left and advise that we did not order the buns but the bowls instead. Marielos gave us a stale look and stated \"i thought you said buns.\" we advised again that we said bowls and she had the rudest attitude in getting our order correct. she quickly, without much table manners and even giving us an annoyed look (she probably didn't think we saw it), grabbed the chasu buns and proceeded to tell the chef it wasn't the correct order. she was very offsetting about the whole ordeal which left my boyfriend and i thinking it was somehow a bigger issue than we had thought. after the chef was able to get our order, Marielos again quickly placed the plates onto our table... and by quickly, i mean not nicely. it was very very rude. Marielos only checked on us once during our whole meal and we were already finished. yet would go around to our other bar mates and tables behind us and constantly interact with them. The other server, with pink hair, had asked if we were doing okay and wanted boxes before our actual server asked us. We don't like to not tip, as my boyfriend and i have had our fair share in the food industry, but her attitude and customer service was very unsatisfactory. we simply got an order wrong, which we were fine with waiting, yet her attitude ruined the entire experience for us. My boyfriend and I were so upset and disappointed in the service, we advise to beware of the customer service.",

It is just a small restaurant so the wait time could go over 20 minutes depending on how busy they are, but it is worth it, they serve you freshly cooked dishes and they are full of flavors. Tried the fried rice with no pork and it came out just perfect!!! Very fast at serving your food, so you'll be out of there in less than an hour!! I will definitely go back there for more noodles",

They make their own noodles here and you can watch the noodles being made (see photo) 4. Various broths to choose from: shio, miso, shoyu (see menu photo)  Ambiance: 1. Small, a little cramped (in the spirit of traditional Tokyo style ramen houses) 2. Wait time may add up depending on peak times, don't forget to write your name on the waiting list/seating when you go in 3. Half booths and chairs 4. I like that you can watch the noodles being made, you know they are not using some freeze dried noodles etc.  Service 1. Efficient and friendly 2. I have been here twice, I have never had a problem 3. Server is also cashier  Mojo: 1. Ramen is pretty good here, I do think I prefer ramen elsewhere.  Spice level goes nothing to mild, medium, hot.  I'd say mild can be pretty spicy, they were very friendly and offered to include it on the side which is nice. 2. Cha-Han, fried rice, was good.  Very umami.",

She had the pork belly rice and kimchee fried rice and I was blown away.  We both agreed that jinya ramen has their ramen beat just by a little but I will say that it is still a five.  The ramen was nice and hot and with the extra ramen noodles I was still able to make a small bowl for her too.  Kimchee fried rice was almost on par as Komex kimchee fried rice but it was still really good.  The porkbelly bowl with rice was the best i have tasted in the valley.  If you are in the area I suggest to stop by.",

I get the Miso ramen and the mild option which is the perfect spice for me! Not a vegetarian but their veggie ramen is also really good and a vegetarian option! Chasu bowl & kimchi fried rice are a hit for me as well. Good customer service and always leaves me satisfied!",

I wish it showed the Bonito flakes on the menu instead of a separate advertisement or I would have added that too.   My friend and I were a bit confused from the placement of the bean sprouts. It took us almost the entire meal to figure out that the bean sprouts are actually placed beneath the noodles. The spice levels are indeed True to their description. We were here in the late afternoon for an early dinner. We were attended to quickly and we had a very kind server. When asked to split the check, even though I forgot to ask at the beginning, he helped us very quickly. I believe we were in and out in half an hour. This is a great fast casual establishment. I would definitely come here again!",

It's not the kitchen staff messing up, it's the server not entering it in right.  They always always repeat right after each order, just not enter it in.

The step by step process takes the guessing out of the equation and ultimately leads to you getting your food faster and their tables turning. Win-win.   I dragged my guy over from cafe rio and into Kobo because a little birdie told me that they make their own noodles! The quality really shines.  We started with chicken steam buns, I could eat 10 of them they were so tasty! Perfect bun, crispy chicken light dressing.  For the ramen I opted for the vegetarian option while hubby went with pork and added ground chicken. Even at opposite ends of the spectrum these bowls were equally balanced, savory and most importantly everything was fresh. Next time I think I'll add black garlic.   Mild is medium here so start at a lower level- you can always add more spice!   5 stars for quality, freshness, ambience and customer service. I'll be back.",

Not sure if my expectations are high as I am comparing them to neighboring ramen restaurants. We felt rush. Server kept reaching over then asking if we were done.

I also like that that there is ground pork and not just the fatty pork slices. Adding spice is definitely another plus...but you know this girl can't handle too spicy anyways. Most of my friends are able to handle the spicy though and it definitely looks spicy! I definitely think the pork belly is a dish to get though.

I love that they are open a little later than other restaurants in the area and honestly being down the street from me helps. If this place was 10 minutes further away would I have gone so often? Honestly no. The noodles and broth are above average but not amazing. I love spicy food, but \"fire\" varies each time I go. For example, I've had it where I would rate it a medium all the way to fire. I thought that it was just me, but another party asked the same thing one night. They were told that it depends on the peppers. All of the staff is very friendly. I love the concentrated menu, but not serving gyoza is odd to me. (Not that I'm a ramen expert, but it seems to be standard at most other places.)  My biggest concern right now is that they don't seem to balance to go orders and in house orders well. Today, I got there during a to go rush, so I waited 25 minutes for my soup. Most of the time it is around 10-15 minutes. My guest said that it may have been the time of day, but I watched 13 to go soups go in a row before ours was made. After I heard to go orders asking if theirs was done yet because it was past their quoted time. They had been working on in house orders to catch up. Now, they are much busier. I am curious if they will keep up with the demand.",

    "text": "Finally got to check out Ramen Kobo. The service is excellent, they're friendly and quick. Was a little surprised that they didn't have any appetizers on their menu. Usually Gyoza is a staple at ramen restaurants even in Japan. It's always nice to munch on Gyoza while you wait for your ramen. Luckily, the wait for ramen was really short. The ramen came out quickly and piping hot. I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen with soft boiled egg. The broth in itself was very flavorful though a little too thick in consistency for my liking. They only give one piece of chashu which was a little odd because most ramen restaurants give you a couple slices at least. The noodles were very good. They weren't too soft nor too hard. Love that they make them fresh in house. I also ordered a side of kimchi and it's the kind of Japanese style kimchi that I love so I gobbled that all up. They put on their menu that they include bamboo shoots in their ramen but they're very thinly sliced and sparse. I usually like the thick slices bamboo shoots in my ramen.   Overall, Ramen Kobo wasn't bad. The service was very good and it's a good place to grab a quick bite to eat. Was the ramen my favorite? No, but I will bring my mom in when she comes to town to give it a try and see what she thinks. I just like the fact that they make the noodles in house, can't find that everywhere.",

I have a few spots I go to but this one is definitely on my list as a go to spot!  The noodles are made fresh and typically you will see them making them in the front.  The staff is always friendly and happy to help you.  This place is a very traditional Ramen house, small, small menu and inviting. If you are looking for a large menu traditional Ramen houses aren't for you. The default bowl you get comes with just about everything you want, I myself like egg and nori which are extra here and its no big deal.  The portion sizes are generous and typically I don't finish the whole bowl. I will also spend the extra 1.00 to get extra noodles for my left over broth and have another meal later.  The flavors are well put together and I like this place because they give you a choice in spice level where some places don't...I love there medium but I like spicy and I have tried their hot once and yes...its hot.    Check them out great food great staff and great atmosphere!",

One bowl of ramen was perfect for me and my friend to split and be full.   The inside is super small, kind of like monta ramen. The staff are extremely friendly and attentive. They also kept my water full constantly which is a plus.  Great service and great ramen! :)",

    "text": "Introducing a brand new west side ramen house are the creators of Monta Ramen. Monta being the last review I wrote I was a bit excited, sort of, to see if this would be any different. To my satisfaction it truly was a delightful experience. It's in a plaza off of Durango not very far from the brand new Ikea store that was built. True to form , it was busy with people waiting, and a list for you to put your name on, but that's pretty standard in every Ramen House; at least any worth dining at.  An Original side note from anywhere else; they are also a noodle-making factory. As you wait in the front when you sign in, you can look through the glass and watch the gentleman/his machine and lots of fresh noodles. The restaurant was very clean, with everything open on display, so you'd be able to tell exactly how organized and clean they really are. Even the bathrooms, that's right,  it gets five stars across the board. As always I ordered a medium Spicy Miso Ramen with nothing extra so I could give you a review on exactly how it tasted as it came. All I can tell you in one word is DELICIOUS!!!! I enjoyed the broth much more than I did before and the fusion of flavors was very palatable. Just like Monta I love their Kimchi Fried Rice , but it was much milder than I expected.   My boyfriend and I shared the pork bowl which is always a favorite for us. Kobo's pork belly was lighter is color, just like if you were to prepare it at home. Where as what I'm used to, it is darker brown like a barbecue type pork, regardless it was very very good. Ramen Kobo is definitely not bland in flavor, as all of their spices mesh into a delightful symphony in your mouth. Begging you to sing another song. It's a very Quaint restaurant, though I've never been to a large one. Size didn't take away from their character, as all of their friendly staff, made it so pleasant to dine there. I truly enjoyed the food and they experience and I would definitely rate it higher than Monta Ramen.  I vote five stars for Ramen Kobo and thank them for such a wonderful dining experience. It's my pleasure to recommend Kobo's to anyone on the west side and even if you're not, you won't be disappointed....",

The place is newer and more modern looking than what I'm used to at Monta and there was even a noodle flattening and cutting machine in operation.  Kinda cool!  Like a field eating trip all in one!    In taking to the waiter, the place is a totally different ramen style than Monta.  Not sure why he was emphasizing it is so different but it was tasty.  Had the \"standard\" and \"mild\" tonkotsu pork broth.  Really rich flavor but there is a difference between the standard and \"mild-medium-hot-fiery\".  For one, the taste is not just spicier but the flavor is different too.  Also the broth is a red color not the dark eggshell color.    I liked them both and the fried rice is the same goodness.  Kind of a lot of starch for one sitting but hard to pick which bite to take next!  The other thing that was pretty cool was their electronic menu at the front counter.  Cool gadget and would be cooler if you could place your orders that way too.  Mostly locals here and prices were reasonable.  And lastly, in the dead heat of summer, this place dies have waiting room seats for six and ample room for another four comfortably near the noodle factory room window area :)  It's worth checking out for something new and different!",

As you walk in to the right is a glass room where fresh ramen is being made, though that was pretty awesome. This is one of the best ramen spots around town, I love the flavors they offer and you don't have to add extra flavors. I like to get the miso and medium. As an appetizer they offer a small and regular sized pork belly bowl which is my favorite thing on the menu. The size of the pork belly is perfect on top of a bed of rice and topped off with chopped green onions. I always fall in my order because it's always busy!",

    "text": "\"Why didn't you stop me?\" pants Midwest poker bud.  \"You said, when it's hot outside, you need to eat hot, spicy food so you sweat and...\" I trail off poorly holding back smug laughter.  Ramen KoBo, the newest offshoot of Monta Ramen.  Same great broths, same great noodles, same great toppings.  The  key difference, spicing up your ramen is encouraged.  Oh and noodles are made by machine, on site.  It has no bearing on the quality of the finished product.  Note:  this location is small owing to the walled off \"fish bowl\" where you can watch ramen being made.  Expect a wait.  Ordering is simple: choose a broth, pick a spice level, add extra toppings (bowls already have a single piece of chashu, seasoned mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and chives).  As with all Monta's, solid broths.  The tonkotsu stands out for their excellent extraction of in your pork flavor balanced with dashi and garlic, finishing with umame notes.  Gelatinous and palate coating.  Seriously, leave this alone.  The miso on the other hand is perfect for spicing up.  All broths contain MSG.    Heat is achieved through chili oil and ground chilies.  The spice, even at fire, doesn't drown but compliments the flavor of the broth by adding a chili sweetness and aroma.  Thai food lovers, fire = level three of five.   As already mentioned, solid noodles, cooked toothsome (unless you specify otherwise).  Tender and flavorful chashu with minimal fat.  Though pricier than Monta, a basic bowl is $9, with added chashu and nitamago (soft boiled seasoned egg), $13.  Still a good value.",

Even the pork was good and I feel like I'm picky when it comes to liking any kind of pork found in ramen.  I just feel like the temperature of the food could have been a tad bit hotter upon first taste. I would much rather have my food burning hot and wait for it to cool down than to receive it luke warm.  I'm willing to give this place another shot since it's so close to my house and I have an obsession with noodles and soup.",

    "text": "Being a sister shop to Monta Ramen, I honestly came here with low expectations the first time I visited. Boy, was I so glad to be wrong!  Location: This is located in the southwest part of town next to Cafe Rio. When entering, you are able to see workers making fresh batches of noodles. However, the shop is very small. Aside from around 10 seats at the bar, there are only around 5 other tables in the rest of the shop. It is very tight with not much room to move around. They only seat full parties so be wary if you are bringing a big group. It will take a while to finally be seated. There is almost always a wait during peak hours, but I have never waited more than 20 minutes for a party of 2-3 because of how fast everything is.  Menu: The menu is short and sweet. You just choose your broth, spice level, and extra toppings you may want to add. All bowls of ramen come with Chashu pork, Kikurage black mushrooms, bamboo shoots, green chives, ground pork, sesame oil, and shredded red pepper. There are also other dishes to eat like the pork belly bowl and kimchi fried rice.  Food: Be careful about the spice! The mild spice already has some kick to it, so be wary of the spice level you choose. Broth is rich and has a lot of flavor, but is not nauseatingly fatty. The noodles are very thick and capture the taste of the broth very well. There is also a decent amount of ground pork and a huge slab of chashu. There is enough where you have some with almost every bite, but does not overpower the dish itself. The portions are very big for a price of around $10 without any add-ins. Thankfully, adding additional ingredients are for a reasonable price & I always leave the shop feeling very satisfied and full. I've been dying to try their non-ramen dishes, but I always end up opting for ramen last minute. Hopefully soon, I could break this curse and finally give them a try!  Service: Workers are very nice, prompt and accommodating. Food comes out fast and I don't think they have ever gotten my order wrong from the many times I've visited. I never felt rushed or pressured to leave, though they do a great job at ensuring wait times are not horrendous.  The quality of the ramen and the genuinely kind workers are what convince me to frequently make the 30 minute drive from where I live to eat at Ramen Kobo. This establishment deserves more attention than it is currently getting. I truly believe this is one of the best ramen shops in town!",

Its this one server that everybody is complaining about who has the worst costumer service of all  the entire staff here. Shes loud and doesnt let you finish when ordering your food. Its like she will finish your order for you. What happen to listening to costumer 1st before you open your mouth. We love their ramen but we just have to deal with her everytime. Well i just hope that the management will sit down and talk to her or train her the proper way of serving costumers.",

    "text": "I'm a total fan of this place. We came here on a Tuesday night before watching a movie. The restaurant is a bit small so make sure you don't come during peak hours. There wasn't a wait when we got there right when it opened at 5 pm, but when we left there were people outside patiently waiting for their table. The food here was delicious, which is what I expected since they're part of the Monta Ramen group! I would definitely come back for the Ramen.   FOOD: We had the Tonkatsu Ramen, which was phenomenal! The noodles were perfect. The soup was tasty and not too salty. I picked a medium spice level, so make The Chashu Pork was soft, tender and fatty.   We also got the Kim Chi fried rice that was also yummy. I read other reviews saying it was a must-try, but I wouldn't consider this the highlight of the restaurant. I believe this place deserves a bravo for their Ramen!   PRICE: Everything was less than $10. The bill for three of us was $40. It's a great value for delicious food.   SERVICE: The service was great. Everyone was efficient and fast! When we asked the server for her opinion of the food, she recommended yummy dishes and was honest about the items she didn't recommend. The food arrived within a timely manner as well.   Overall, it was a great experience and I rate this place 4 out of 5 stars. I would come back here to try the other ramen soups!   Happy Dining,   J Tran",

The basic toppings consist of chashu pork, 1 whole clove fried garlic, kikurage black mushrooms, bamboo shoots, green chives, moyashi (bean sprouts), ground pork and shredded red pepper (thats where the chili flakes came from). Other choices are Tonkatsu Ramen (pork broth), Miso Ramen (pork & chicken broth) and Vege Ramen in vegetable broth/toppings.   The toppings, ramen noodle and the reddish colored soup all tasted awesome. Full of flavor but not salty. The noodle is how I expected a homemade noddle would be. I would definitely come back and try the other toppings and soup types.   After looking at the photo of the menu more carefully, it looks like there are 5 choices (original, mild, medium, hot & fire) not 4 as I originally thought  I should've ordered the original.",

    "text": "Before this I used to go to Monta Ramen when visiting family in LV.  The only type of ramen I eat is Tonkotsu broth based. This place now ranks right under my #1 ramen spot which is tied between the Ajisen Ramen chain (because of the Ajisen Special ramen with spice bow) and Tampopo Ramen in Tempe, AZ.  First of all, they make their noodles in-house just like at Tampopo, and have one of the limited number of noodle making machines in the USA as well, I have only seen 3, Tampopo in Tempe AZ, Underground Ramen in SF, and this one, so it's always exciting. As expected, the noodles were top notch, and the broth was only below the best by the slightest of margins.  The thing that put this place at 5 stars for me was the fried pork belly that I ordered with my side of fried rice, O.M.G!!! That was soooooo good.  I requested that it's be crispy and it did not disappoint. Order fried rice with a  side of crispy pork belly when you go.  In conclusion, I love this place and will not be going back to Monta when I am in LV, just because Ramen KoBo is now on my list of not only faves in LV but top in my list overall.",

Similar to Monta, it's fairly small without a ton of seating (4-5 tables to sit families of 4, and bar seating), and I've only had to wait at most maybe 30 minutes.   Friendly customer service. 4 different soup bases: shoyu (chicken), tonkotsu (pork), miso (chicken + pork), and a vegetarian bowl. They all come with a decent amount of toppings, and you can also ask for extra toppings. You can pick how spicy you want your broth: not spicy, mild, medium, and hot. As for their extra dishes, I've only had their Pork Belly Bowl so far, and it was amazing! Delicious, salty pork belly on top of garlic rice.   I've come here twice already, and I'm glad to have a good ramen spot so close to my house.",

    "text": "I returned to my quest to find the greatest ramen in Las Vegas this week. The specialty that I noticed at Ramen KoBo was the spice level. I love spicy so I naturally had to go fire for the level. I then went with my go to tonkatsu and added some spicy roe as I'd never seen that as a topping option.   Price is the same as anywhere else in Vegas. I feel that the chefs have all just called each other up and set a price to $9 with additional topping prices varying.   The soup itself was the spiciest broth I have ever had - fantastic. My eyes and nose were running which is what I hope for when ordering top spice level. The noodles weren't that great compared to other ramen spots and the chasu, though good, was portioned very small. The roe were quite a nice addition so I'm glad I added that in. It gave the dish a nice extra layer. This ramen also included some ground prom which I didn't notice at first but was good since it made me feel less ripped off meatwise by the lack of chasu. This ramen was smaller than most with less noodles as your typical Vegas ramen front. I actually like that better because it seems that most places waste the entire bowl on noodles and less on extras whereas KoBo puts more spirit into the variety of toppings.   KoBo is the best spot in town for a spicy broth. It will fill you up but won't get you bloated. They have salmon roe which I liked but the noodles weren't the greatest. Overall it filled my ramen craving and would be my #1 destination if I'm looking to burn my stomach on tonkatsu ramen.",

I don't think you can make reservations, or at least you can't through Open Table, I didn't call and ask but I'm assuming not. So get there early or at least be prepared to wait a bit.   While your waiting you do get to watch the noodles being made which is really cool.   It didn't take long to get a spot at the bar since there were just two of us. The ramen was amazing, we both ordered Veggie Ramen and added egg, mushroom & bean sprouts. Our order came very quickly & it was soooo good! Perfect for a chilly windy Vegas night.   The ambiance is exactly what you would expect from a ramen spot, clean, light & minimal decor. It was super busy so it was a bit noisy, but not annoyingly so. Our server was great & super friendly.   Can't wait to go back",

Though the soup of my original Tonkatsu Ramen was a bit salty for my taste buds, I still finished my bowl, while hubby enjoyed his Tonkatsu Ramen Mild Spice level. As for the Pork Belly Bowl, hubby and I enjoyed the pork belly meat, but the kids didn't seem to like the rice. Perhaps next time we'll ask for the sesame oil sauce on the side (if that's possible).",

Did I mention they make their own noodles?! The portions are big! We had plenty of left overs which tasted great the next day! The price is fair and I will definitely be returning again... especially on the bone chilling days of the coming winter :)",

If they could add more items to their menu, such as dessert items, I think that would be interesting! Sometimes after eating, I'm craving something sweet, but they don't really have any dessert. Other than that, the fact that it's also close to home is a plus!",

No, there isn't gyoza but the fresh noodles, variety in soup bases and the rice bowls make up for it. The pork belly buns are great too.   I'm a big fan of the tonkatsu ramen and it's a plus to be able to have them put the spice on the side if you aren't sure about what your belly can handle. I always get a side of either kimchi fried rice or a pork belly bowl. They are must haves and also great if you're too lazy to pack a lunch for work the next day.  Everything is extremely reasonably priced and yes, sometimes you have to wait but it's totally worth every minute.  The service is great and the food is always delicious. I have turned many friends onto KoBo and many have turned it into their go-to ramen spot. Definitely a big fan of KoBo and they never disappoint!",

Anyway, the night we went, we called ahead to check what time they closed, and they said they would be closing at 11 PM. It was around 9 PM when we had called. However, when we got there, they said they were about to close! They still decided to seat us, but just barely after we ordered, they were already shoving the bill at us, saying they needed to close the register. Why bother seating us then? Meanwhile, other customers that came in after us were also very confused that the staff were closing the place really early, and were given abrupt responses as well.   As for the food, they have four different broths you can choose from, which include certain toppings depending on which broth you pick. Then you can pick how spicy you want your broth, and any additional toppings you want to add.The ramen we had ordered was good, but I cannot get over the rude staff. I don't think I'll be coming here again.",

It is such a treat if you get to see them being made.  -Their pork chashu is so good, both in the broth and in the chashu buns.  -I absolutely love the fact that I can choose how spicy you want your ramen.  Although I love the original tonkatsu, my boyfriend likes his food a little spicy so he always goes with fire. -The service is always great! I've never had a bad experience with anyone. -The only down side is it can definitely get busy, and I understand why.  I can honestly say, it is worth the wait!

Maybe I need to try the non-spicy ramen but this ramen didn't do it for me.   The ramen was good. It was a little thin and light for me. I like heavy milky ramen but that's a personal preference. I did do spicy with the ramen and it made it taste like a Coconut curry soup dish that is Thai and Laotian. The pork belly was okay and the broth itself was good.  The appetizers they offer are good to me though. My assumption with KoBo is that they are greeted towards an eat and leave type of establishment. They have a simple menu with a handful of appetizers and you just order, eat, and leave.  I give them kudos for staying open late for late diners. If I'm in the area I'll stop in for a ramen craving, but not driving across town. Solid place.",

I got double  order of noodles and meat. I was stuffed with the noodle portion that it came with but I definitely took it with me and ate it later.  This broth had a creamy red look to it depending how spicy. It was a little thick for me. I got hot and it was fine.   I was not too crazy about the meat (pork). I like my pork crispy/pork bellish. This was round cut slices that had a weird texture. Don't get me wrong I ate all of it.  Did I mention noodles made from scratch!  Definitely a place to try if you are in town.

I wasn't trying to obtain something for free but thought it would have been a compromise at least with a piece of chicken and still charge me $2.50 even if I declined the pork items ?!

At first glance, the bowl was aesthetically pleasing, and looking at it will make you hungry. The first thing I tasted was the stock. This stock was light and on the creamier side of pork bone soup. My only gripe with this is that the stock was a bit too light. All the toppings overpowered the broth and stood out too much. Any addition of the black garlic oil along with my second round of noodles overpowered the bowl completely. The noodles, however, were great: excellent bite out of the bowl, not too tough, not too soft. The noodles made much of the ramen eating experience.  Service was pretty nice. The lady at the front guided us to our seats and a young man took our orders. Our waters were refilled at a reasonable pace, food came out quick, and the staff was friendly.  If there was a half star option I'd give this a 3.5.",

Maybe they can have the customer choose the level of grease besides the level of spiciness too. Price: a bit pricey for the portion size. Overall, it's an okay place",

Everything was to the perfection level. I've been to Jinya, Monta and Sora, which are the 3 popular places for ramen, none of them was this good. I finished everything including the broth, noodles and toppings. And on top of that I finished the fried rice as well. I'm so glad I made the decision to drive 25 miles to try this place out. So worth it!",

I used to go to Ramen Kobo since they have the best ramen in town (in my opinion). And their service was not so bad. But when I went to Kobo last time with my friend and my baby son, I was very upset. My son has some severe food allergies, so I need to pack his food whenever we go out to eat. He even reacts to some of the restaurants' rice bowl.  On that day, we had great food and were all ready to leave, the manager asked us if we were Korean. We were like um yes? And she said you can't bring any food for him here except baby food. I was so shocked. Dude, the airlines don't even charge babies under 2. I was like um okay? And when I got to my car, I was SO MAD! We went to the ER twice for my son's food allergic reaction. Was she gonna pay for the ER if he reacts to their food? She wasn't even nice and didn't smile when she talked to us. I was extremely angry I swore that I would NEVER go back to Kobo.",

We were seated right away which I know it's probably golden because the restaurant is pretty small and narrow. I know the wait time could take a while if the line was long. Luckily, when we were seated, the place filled up not to long after.  Down to the food...I ordered the chicken broth ramen, mild with an extra egg. The broth is so delicious! I never had ramen like this! Everything about the bowl was heavenly. From the daily made scratch noodles, the meat, the bamboo shoots, just everything together gave the soup the perfect bite and flavor. I never cleaned my bowl like that, not even when I eat pho! Even my 5 year old who is a picky eater had a small bowl of the soup and dived right into it.  As far as the service....they are fast, friendly and attentive. They are quick to refill drinks and not to mention, we barely had any wait time waiting for our food to arrive.  I love everything about this place: The prices are affordable, food is exquisite and service is excellent! Great experience trying this Ramen place. I'll will be back AGAIN for sure!",

You really can't go wrong here whether you get miso, veg or tonkatsu. Make sure to add an egg cause that's the best part. You pick your spice level or leave it plain. If you're unsure of what spice you can handle you can always ask for it on the side and adjust the spice to your liking. This isn't really a long sit-down spot, more of an on-the-go lunch spot or somewhere to stop for a quick dinner. They serve canned teas, sodas, as well as draft and I believe bottled beer. No happy hour, but prices are so reasonable there doesn't need to be.",

The consistency of the ramen leaves much to be desired. I usually go with spicy but depending on the day the amount of spice will wildly fluctuate as will the amount of sliced pork you get. I really do love this place but it is a bit expensive for ramen. Other places will give you a few add-ons as part of the price of ramen but at Kobo you pay for anything extra. A bowl of ramen with 2-4 extras will run you $14-$16. If you order your food togo its usually done in 3-5 minutes depending on how busy they are.",

They won't seat you unless you have the whole party present, but it's due to very limited sitting.  Highly recommend it!",

The soup and noodles were on point like always. The broth was super flavorful and the noodles were yummy. I don't know if this is becoming a trend with noodle places but the soft boiled egg is cold and precooked before hand. Am I the only one turned off by this? I dunno, I just like how it used to be freshly made in most places. They have red ginger and garlic you can add to the ramen which makes it more flavorful.   Definitely will come back since it's so close to home. Try the ramen spicy! It tastes great both ways depending on what you're feeling.",

We didn't have to wait too long for our food, maybe 15 minutes before it came out. The broth was quite creamy, and since I enjoy spicy, the Hot level had a nice kick but not anything crazy for me. My favorite part were the noodles! They were nice and thin, and I could tell they were handmade.  Overall I really enjoyed the ramen here.

This was my second trip to this location and I was happy to be back. We managed to hit it during a low time and got seated at the bar right away. I ordered the pork belly fried rice appetizer and my co-worker ordered the pork belly over rice. As other people have stated, the chow readily flows from the kitchen with great haste. Both appetizers were excellent. I could eat the fried rice everyday if given the chance. Now on to the star of the show.  My co-worker and I both ordered the medium spicy tonkatsu ramen with extra pork, extra egg, and a various assortment of veggies. The broth was the perfect level of spice and amazing creaminess. It was hot but not scorching, temperature wise. Another popular place in Vegas disappointed me with mildly tepid broth the day before. I will save that for another review. The noodles were the perfect level of chewiness and absorbed just a bit of the broth. Kobo makes their own noodles and I love them. I wish they could dry them and sell them, so I could have them at home.   We both left fat and happy. Upon my return to Vegas, this will be the first stop.",

One of the unique quirks about this place is that you can see the ramen noodles being made right in front of you in the waiting area. Love that set up!  Yep, the ramen here is on point. I haven't had anything but ramen so I can't comment on the rest of the menu but I do enjoy all the ramen here. My favorite is the tonkotsu. Unlike some other ramen places, the broth is flavorful yet not too strong or heavy in the sodium taste.   Service has been great from my experiences. The restaurant is pretty small so don't feel odd if you sit close to the table next to you - it may happen especially when the place gets busy. They have a bar area available along with some tables.  One thing I do dislike about this place: add-ons prices. Most other ramen places I've been to include an egg free of charge. Here it is $1 or something. It's also $1 to add seaweed they provide one piece.   Still not too bad for a bowl of ramen. It's about $8 and change for a bowl without any additional items. I do come here frequently, mostly because of its convenient location though.",

    "text": "One of my go to places for ramen.  Their broths are a nice blend of flavors without being overly salty - feel like they really play up the garlic and even have additional garlic you can add as a condiment. Watch your spice level - their mild is probably closer to medium at other place, but I feel you need at least a little spice to really enjoy it.  Noodle to soup ratio is perfect in my opinion though I wish that nitamago wasn't extra.  My ramen just isn't complete without the egg. Nice simple selection of other rice dishes, but ramen is really the Star here. Another highlight here is their recent addition of dipping noodles - Tsukemen.  Hot soup broth served as a dipping sauce for the cold noodles.  Give it a try for something different esp when the temperatures are rising outside.",

Of course at the time of my visit it was during the craze of its anniversary. They offered $3 fresh ramen bowls, something that enticed me and absolutely enticed the crowd that filled the place. I can't fault the place for that, honestly I expected that to happen. As such I had myself their ramen, the Shoyu Mild Ramen to be exact. Shoyu being the type of course and Mild the spice level they offer. The waitress was very kind to let me know that even Mild had a bit of a kick. And it sure did! The rest of the bowl was a lovingly crafted dish. The noodles, being house-made that you can actually observe were fresh and tasted fresh. The Shoyu broth was perfectly balanced with the spice. And thanks for adding corn! All in all, minus the large crowd at the time, Ramen Kobo is a great tasting little ramen shop!",

It's the sliced meat they put in the soup with some lettuce and mayo I believe.   The employees all welcome you when you enter the restaurant. Service is fast and friendly.

I found the chashu pork to also be super fatty and the flavor was very porky (not fresh). There was barely any meat and that wasn't flavorful at all.

When they opened (exactly at 11:30), the 8 of us waiting were seated promptly and efficiently.  Water was served, orders were taken, and everyone had food at 11:45.  Talk about fast!   I also really liked their pork chashu - it was really delicious.   That's about all that I liked.   So the pork chashu must have been sliced by a skilled chef, it is surprisingly thin and you only get one slice with your order.  I had the miso ramen with mild (lowest) level spicy.  My order was doused in red pepper and was very spicy.  I didn't taste much of the broth because the heat overwhelmed all other flavors.  The toppings were also sparse, so it was like having noodles in a spicy soup and not much else.  I can't say I enjoyed the ramen here, which is like 90% of the entire menu.",

Just be careful trying to take a picture of them running the noodles through the machine - it can get a little awkward when they see you taking photos of the employees.  I got the miso ramen. The broth was very flavorful and full bodied, the noodles were perfectly chewy and al dente, and all the toppings were delicious. One thing that I missed though was a lack of vegetables and more toppings. You can add extra toppings, but they were a little pricey and I expected a little more to come with my bowl, especially for the price.   I ended up getting the original spice level because I can't take spicy food, but my friends got medium-hot level and they were all suffering greatly. If you're a spicy noodle lover, this is a good place for you, but be careful of what level you choose as they can make it really hot!",

There are bar seating and table seating. Bar is good as you can watch the chef cook. We ordered a chicken soup based and a pork soup based Ramen, with a medium spice level to both and a Pork belly rice bowl. All were very delicious and everything comes out super hot!

As someone who loves spicy food, I eat my ramen with the level fire all the time. If you can handle really spicy food then fire will be nothing to you. I also love how flavorful and fresh their ramen is. Every time it comes out, it's always super hot and fresh, never lukewarm or anything like that.   Service is also very nice. The place can get busy but even then, the servers try their best to check up on you, refill your water, etc.  The only problem with this place is that you can not substitute what you take out from your ramen for more of something else. You can only add extra which will cost about an extra $2 for each topping. I don't like bean sprouts or ground beef in my ramen so I always sub it for an egg and more chashu since you only get one piece. My bowl ends up being around $14.   However, since their ramen is so delicious and their wait time is never over 15 min or so, I will always come back to this place. Especially in winter!",

    "text": "My first time here with a group of seven and we came in about an hour and a half before they closed. I felt like one of the waitresses were rushing us while she was taking our order, which might've caused her to switch some orders and get orders completely wrong.  The presentation of the food was great, but the broth was pretty salty and my pork was very fatty. Just thinking of my order as I write this review makes me sick.  The service wasn't great either. They can't keep track of what everyone ordered. And when they brought out the check they kept pestering my boyfriend about how many Cokes we had ordered, which was only one. They still kept asking like we were hiding another can of Coke somewhere.  I would not bring my business back to this place. If i'm ever on that side of town again with an empty stomach, I'll just go to IKEA and get some Swedish meatballs.",

    "text": "Like every local, I was ecstatic to hear that Monta Ramen would be opening another location in the Southwest which is rapidly growing with great restaurants. When Omoide opened, they lived up to the hype. After all, it was one of the first ramen spots to open in Southwest. And so when word came on the street that Monta (who made it on Travel Channel) decided to expand its location, it was over. My life was complete.  And how disappointed I was. Came here twice, about 3 weeks apart which was enough to say that I would not be coming back. Actually, should not have even come the second time.  On a non-busy weekday, I stood by the seating area for 10 minutes. Tables and bar area non filled. Host/Server did not actually even acknowledge me and had her head working on some check by the computer. It was not until 2 guys walked in that she looked up and saw us and thought we were together as one party.   I ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen. This time, I thought, I would be smart and just order extra Chashu since the first time there was only one fatty piece. Kobo is smart. Since they want you to pay for additional toppings, my logic was that if I paid for extra chashu- perhaps there would be more chance of better chashu. I paid $2.50 for 4 pieces of fat, essentially.  How is it that the SAME ramen restaurant can have two completely different chashus? Did not particularly favor the tiny portion of ground beef inside either.  Given, the noodles are made freshly in-house. Other than that, the ramen is terrible.   I will make that drive to Jinya or Monta Ramen on the other side of town.  But Ramen Kobo, I will pass.",

What bothers me though is the cook making the fried rice and other food, which I did not orders, he was kinda heavy guys so he was sweating inside the kitchen of course because of boiling water and broth etc... He was wearing gloves but he kept Touching his face and hat with sweat then continue on cooking food. I just don't think that was very appetizing for me... I left after I ate the nitamago (eggs) lol... But no space as well... There's probably just 25-30 people capacity. So if there's a line or waiting to be seated I would leave and go somewhere not worth it for ur 2 mins waiting for a bowl of not so good ramen",

The broth is very thick and rich, exactly how it should be. Noodles are the skinny kind which they don't give you an option to choose though. Doesn't come with eggs if you don't pay for the extra topping which is $1.50. A little on the expensive side but totally worth it. Been to so many ramen places, even its sister place - monta, this place by far is the best.",

The soup itself is amazing and the add-ons that come free include: chashu pork, garlic, black mushrooms, chives, fresh chives, bamboo shoots, and red pepper.  The noodle is a perfect mix of chewy and soft, leaving your taste buds in heaven.  Here's a tip, if you're sensitive to spice start with mild and work your way up to a different spice level.  Sometimes their medium is a bit too much.  Also, add some spinach for a fresh greens twist.  One last tidbit, free of charge they will let you swap ground pork and chashu for chicken! You can thank me later!",

I ordered the chicken broth. It comes with all this stuff. Of course, step 3 is to add other stuff which I added soft boiled egg and nori. Mild spiciness. The soup looked oily when it got to me but I think that's where most of the flavor is. I had to REACH OVER this lady beside me to get chopticks and people kept bumping my back as they walked by the bar. So that was awkward. This was while I was eating. I don't think the people realized it because the space was so tight, but I definitely apologized to the lady beside me for having to reach over her for chopticks. The broth was mild, just like I had ordered, but I don't like it this oily. The FRESHLY made noodles are absolutely delicious. The oil kinda bugged me and I was wearing all white, so I was scared it would get all over my shirt. I also received my drink in a can, which I don't like. All restaurants should have their drinks on taThen at 2:25, they told me that they were doing last call. I guess they are only open til 2:30 on Wednesdays. Then reopen at 5pm to 11pm. Overall, ok service, great noodles, oily broth, but flavorful. Very squished and cramped inside. I would MAYBE go back.",

    "text": "A friend recommended this place and it did not disappoint. There was practically no wait when we came here a little after they opened. The menu is very straight forward, you pick your broth, level of spiciness and toppings. I went for the shoyu, hot with no toppings. All the bowls are $8.95 unless you add toppings. The ramen comes out pretty quick so that's a good thing.   My friends mostly got either the mild or medium which I should have done. I can normally tolerate spicy foods but getting this ramen hot was for sure a mistake. It burns the heck out of my lips and I need at least 3 glasses of water to soothe the pain. As from the burn, I liked how light the ramen is. Most ramen places I've been too the broth is often fatty and bit more dense but this broth was quite light. I don't know if it's because I chose the shoyu where they use a chicken broth instead of the pork but it's a much cleaner tasting ramen and I like that. That way I can enjoy the whole dish instead of just the noodles and chashu. I really enjoyed the chashu, it was a nice thick cut compared to other places I've been to. I like the flavor a good deal, not a fan of the super thin slices. You can hardly taste the flavor of the pork when it's cut so thin. It doesn't retain much of the texture or fatty goodness. I thought the noodles were okay, I prefer thick noodles so I'm sad they don't have that option here.  Regardless of the noodle size, this is still a great spot for ramen. Not too crowded so you can get your food relatively quick and it's delicious.",

We get these cravings for Ramen Kobo, specifically because of a few of their items.   You HAVE to try their fried rice! I don't know exactly what it is that makes it addicting, but it's such a perfect side to have before, during, or after your bowl of ramen. I once tried to make my own fried rice and it wasn't nearly as great as Ramen Kobo's. If you want a little spice to your fried rice, you can try their kimchi fried rice, which is equally as good.  Now, their ramen is to die for. They hand make their noodles. And the fact that you get to choose your own spicy level and add other items into your bowl gives it that personal touch! I just can't get over their bowls. My favorite spice level is mild and my fiance's is hot. There's something about the hot spicy level that looks aesthetically pleasing. It's a beautiful orange!  I enjoy their customer service because of every visit I have had, their service has always been keen. It's rare for me to finish my glass of water because there's always a server refilling my drink! They're coming to our table at prompt times and it's not too overbearing. I love it here! This is my #1 ramen place!",

It's been years of travelling and hundreds of ramens, but Ramen Kobo still holds first place on my personal list of favourites.  The broth is robust and rich yet not fatty, it's delicate yet bursting with flavour. And the noodles are the perfect chewy texture.   Another aspect which I find amazing about this place is consistency. Every time (and, oh boy, we've been here so many times) the broth has exactly the same flavour profile, the meat is as tender as always and the noodles are exactly the same chewiness.   I also like Kobo's compact menus (it's better to do fewer things right than more things in an average way).   My usual order is Tonkotsu ramen (mild and medium spice depending on the temperature of weather) and fried rice, which has this amazing smoky taste and aroma.  Grab the seat at the bar, it's the best one as you will be able to see how's everything done.",

Since I was dining by myself I was seated quickly at the bar. I love sitting at the bar as I can see what's going on in the kitchen and how they orchestrate things. I ordered the tonkatsu in medium spicy and added egg and nori. I really enjoyed the homemade ramen and the broth was delicious! It was creamy and the medium spice was perfect for me. Spicy enough to make my nose run but not spicy to a point where I hated life. The pork was perfectly tender and was a great addition to the dish. My only complaint is that I wish the broth was hotter. It was more on the warm side to me and I'm that person who likes my soup to be screaming hot. I'm looking forward to trying their miso next time as I do have a favorite spot for my miso ramen so it'll be interesting to compare.",

The fact that they have this straight chicken option (broth, \"belly\", and ground chicken) sets them apart from the competition in my book. As you can tell, the broth is a big pull for me!  The spice is just right and you can tell it's been cooked long and slow, and the NOODLES honey. They make them right there and they're the perfect thickness.   I found this place on a whim when I lived in the area. Now? I'm willing to make a drive even if there's another option along the way. Me and my mom just busted a mission at 10pm to get there and eat before they closed. It's THAT deep.   Service can be hit or miss but you never have to wait too long for your ramen. Yeah, it's small but I love it. It's this hidden gem you wouldn't expect to be smack dab in the middle of a sandwich shop and clinic.

    "text": "I love me some good Japanese Ramen. It was my second visit here and it was packed so it had to be a good sign... but sometimes looks can be deceiving. Upon arrival with my friend and I we wrote down our names and proceeded to wait outside in the cold since the waiting area was full. As people were leaving my friend and I as well as others waiting saw open seats yet none of the employees tried to seat others. Finally after 30 minutes of waiting we get seated at a table that has been available for at least 10 minutes. Before I even got to sit down I was immediately asked if I was ready to order. After getting seated and asking what drinks we wanted I asked if I could get water for now with lemon on the side, but sadly they don't have lemon, no big deal. After being given some time to order I decided to go for the spicy miso ramen which has 4 spice levels: mild, medium, hot, and fire. As someone that can easily handle 8-10 Thai spice level and 6-8 Japanese spice I was very tempted to go for hot but the server suggested medium considering I haven't been to this place in ages and don't want to overwhelm myself. Safe to say, medium is a good balance for the bowl of ramen. If you enjoy thicker style ramen you will most definitely enjoy this place. Service was very lackluster but the ramen was delicious until I saw that one of my char-siu (Pork) was nearly raw and lukewarm. I always give places a second chance and this place definitely has potential, but with the lack of structure with the employees, poor service, and lukewarm meat, I know they can do better especially with such a nice location and their competitive pricing.   Pros: +Food is good +Price is cheaper than other ramen places  Cons: -If the waiting room is packed be prepared to wait outside in the cold / heat -Lack of items on the menu, would like to see more -Lack of structure -Service needs to be heavily improved on  I love ramen and definitely can see potential in this place. The pricing is very attractive and the ramen is very good aside from my lukewarm pork. If the service can get fixed and the food can remain consistent (everything in my bowl was good aside from the lukewarm pork) then they'll have a regular. It was really hard to rate this place considering the service was bad, but the ramen was the saving grace until I bit into my pork. I'll definitely be back in the future to see if things improve but for now I see this place as a solid 3 stars. Better customer service would bring it to 3.5 stars and if my bowl of ramen didn't have lukewarm pork it would've been a solid 4 stars. I'm a tough one to get 5 stars from but if this place heavily enhances their service and creates a better structure and more menu items, I can definitely see this place earning a 5 star from me.",

    "text": "Located in Henderson, Ramen Kobo, a popular Ramen shop. offers the lovable flavors Shoyu, Tonkotsu, Tonkotsu-Shoyu, and Miso Broth.  They also have the option for a Veggie Ramen.  Instead of a normal Chashu (Pork) you receive Beansprouts, Spinach, and etc in your Ramen.  I ordered Tonkotsu Ramen and added my usual Nitamago (2 egg/which is just an egg cut in half) and Nori (Seaweed).  The first time I went, the Noodles was nice and soft, the broth goes nicely with the noodles; but, it was thick almost like watery gravy. The second time I went, which is most recent; the broth was a nice flavor and wasn't thick, but just right.   The first time I went, they had ground meat as one of the toppings on my Ramen.  The second time I went, they had the usual piece of meat like other Ramen shops. Also at Ramen Kobo, you can choose the level of spiciness for your ramen.  The room was quite small, so if you go in a large group it might take a while to be seated, but it was a fun experience.  There's a window near the entrance where you can watch them make the noodles, they call it the Noodle Factory.  The staff was really nice and helpful when I went.  It had a nice atmosphere to visit with friends and family.",

Then I have another women come over and tell me I can't have it and grabbed at it, and said she'll put it in the refrigerator. I told her I know the other women told me I couldn't but it was ok to leave on the table. So she said she was wrong and kept going back and fourth, and then the other server came over and said I can't have it because the manager said and the rule just changed. I went to put it in my car and they all continued to stare, I heard them in the kitchen speaking about it. After the rude and awkward stares I left, and as I was leaving they were still talking about my drink in the kitchen. Mind you, I ordered a Diet Coke. I come pretty often, 3 times this last month actually. I'm extremely disappointed in the customer service and how they treated me over a Starbucks drink. They'd rather lose my continuous service over a $3 drink.",

I carried out so I can't comment on the service that much. I felt they were polite to me on the phone and when I went to pick up my order. Everything was cooked well, it just needed more flavor.

All the flavors together, including the fresh ramen noodles was excellent.  My boyfriend ordered his with mild spice and be prepared, It was spicy.

I ordered the medium spicy miso ramen (should have gotten hot/fire). I didn't add any other toppings because I thought they were on the pricey side. Most of them are $1+. I thought the broth and the stuff it came with is comparable to the spicy ramen from Ramen Sora (ground meat, bamboo, etc). The broth is super thick and heavy, but delicious.  The staff was really friendly but once they brought out our check, I felt really rushed. The lady was about to take my bowl away before I even answered her question as to whether I was finished or not.

I'm forever eating Vietnamese, Japanese, and Thai food, but I've never been to a ramen specific restaurant until today.  Since I'm currently doing this whole plant-based lifestyle, I opted for the vegetarian bowl with vegetable broth and added black mushroom ($1) and mustard greens ($1.50). Seems a little excessive to charge $1.50 for 8 leaves of greens, but whatever, it was my choice.  My bowl came out and the first thing I noticed is that it was very oily broth. Again, I've never been to a ramen place so I have no idea if that's normal or not...but I wasn't stoked about it. The dish was delicious, I ordered level 3/4 for spiciness and that was perfect for me. The noodles were excellent, the flavors were fantastic, but I wish it had been less oily. I went from feeling healthy about my choice to feeling like I need to do some extra cardio this afternoon.   One other note - the vegetable bowl was the only option for vegetarians/vegans. All the rice dishes have meat and/or egg in them. This isn't a huge deal because the main dishes are the ramen, but just a heads up if you are a plant-based eater.",

Other than the basic ramen and fried rice, I haven't explored the menu too much because I'm usually here for a post workout meal or a quick bite before work.

Fortunately, It is well seen but the road to enter the shopping center it is located in, is in all honesty, awful due to the proximity being so close to the freeway; cars are running fast and the roads are large and difficult to cross.  The interior is very modern with wooden paneling and matching tables and chairs. The lights are chain hung and include a line of studio bulbs which keep the venue well lit but with a warm tone. The bar area can seat quite a few patrons and is spacious despite the small size of the restaurant itself. It's very pleasing to the eye, with the black framing very clean. The decor is classic to that of most Japanese restaurants, with banners hung above the bar area.   FOOD: 4.8/5 The noodles here are fresh made, with a large glass window to see the process. There is a machine that essentially flattens the dough and slices it up into portions. Because of this, the noodles are chewy and have a great buoyant texture.   The way the menu is situated makes it very easy to read and pick the type of broth you would like, how spicy, and any extra toppings that you would want with your ramen which includes adding a portion of noodles.   I ordered the shoyu (chicken broth) which tends to be hotter. In the case of soup, it keeps the ramen at a nice temperature without cooking through the vegetables. The ramen comes with bamboo shoots, chaysu pork, ground meat, chili slices, and other typical vegetable ingredients. They were all fresh and still contained a light crunch which was pleasant. I also added a soft boiled egg. The extra toppings can cost anywhere from .50 to 2.50.   I also ordered the chaise fried rice. Ramen KoBo generally has some of the best made chaysu I have come across in Las Vegas, very tender and not try at all. The marinade is delicious but not overpowering that it would ruin the quality taste of meat. The fried rice's presentation was a bit scattered, but tasted good with the chopped ingredients still intact enough to have a variety of texture with the rice.  SERVICE: 5/5 The service was excellent, with the waiters and waitresses attentive to our table. I overheard the servers actually helping out certain individuals when menu items were questioned as well. Overall, everyone was friendly, well adjusted to their surroundings in the case that the restaurant is small and can be hard to maneuver around in, and attentive to the customers.  OVERALL EXPERIENCE: 4.9/5 Honestly, I have been to this location before and was disappointed in how salty the broth was. However today the taste was perfect, not too salty or bland and I was very pleased with the overall taste, service, and of course, the cute Halloween decorations. Ramen restaurants have become abundant in Las Vegas, and with that, competitive advantage is important. This location is supposed to be a sister of Monta, and I was not fond of that location's ramen. However, KoBo has impressed me with today's service. I will definitely be back soon.",

The menu is very much \"Build-your-own\"  You can choose the broth, spice level and and extra ingredients.   I felt it was slightly expensive as I added a soft boiled egg and extra pork and my total was over $13. My gf did the same and added shaved green onion so hers came out over $14.   I ordered the pork broth, chashu pork and egg and medium spice and it was very good. They handmake their own noodles which you can see through a window as you walk through the entrance.   Only reason it doesn't get 4 stars is the price. I could get close to the same thing for $5 cheaper.",

I really like two other Monta locations a lot, I prefer them over every other ramen place in the city. This place was just dissapointing. They only have fried rice as side dishes and use one type of noodle verses thin/thick.    It's more expensive than other two Monta locations (sister stores) as well!!! There are better options than this place!",

    "text": "I love trying new ramen places and this one hit the spot. Despite craving ramen in the Vegas summer heat, this one here has a simple make your own ramen menu along with ready to order dishes. The flavors are more to my liking than I would say maybe Monta and Jinya combined. It's definitely a running up to Ramen Sora but it might just win for me since the miso with mild flavoring opened up the taste buds really well. You could add more if you want but it was the amount of flavors I needed. On the side I had chasu pork buns I believe which needed more flavor and chasu but the main idea of this review is definitely the ramen. I love the environment, it has the feel of what a ramen should should be and you can watch them make handmade noodles so you know the quality of the noodles are always fresh. It is a little far for me since I'm centered in the spring mountain area but the drive is worth it if you want a good ramen fix.",

I don't know if its because it was a to-go ordered but all the noodles stuck together when I placed them with everything in the bowl. I had to break them into short noodles since they didn't unwind. Also since it was my first time I was expecting the egg in the ramen, should of read the menu closer. Overall good flavor but I just prefer Ohjah a few doors down if I'm going to pick up food on this side of town.

The biggest problem was the broth, the heart of ramen is the broth, it was more like miso soup, it definitely lacked a real broth taste. The broth contained very little meat and was not prepared properly. Our eggs were cold, our pork slices were cold, and the fact that they add ground pork (cheapest meat you could add) which makes the dish completely undesirable. There is a ramen joint not too far from Ramen KoBo that offers 2 slices of beef, 2 slices of pork, one huge ox tail, an egg, and two seaweed wraps for less than the price we paid for at KoBo. The straw that broke the camels back was paying $3 for both of us to enjoy a cold egg (smh). This should already be included in our ramen bowls. We both definitely do not plan on ever returning. We gave it a shot and it definitely did not meet our expectations.",

However I knocked off a star for the actual broth. I was pretty stoked to have a spiciness option for the ramen; however, the spice seems to be just an chili oil or some sort and made the broth super oily to which I couldn't really savor the flavor of it since the broth itself was no longer as creamy or thick like it should be.

I prefer this over monta because it's not as rich as the monta broth that hurts my stomach after I'm done, also monta is always packed from start to finish and is in the middle of chinatown. My only problem with this place is that its more expensive then monta. Montas ramen is about 6 or 7 dollars, this place charges 9 dollars for ramen and that's not including your extras. But it's right down the street from my job so I can't complain too much. Also you can choose your spicy level. All in all I definitely will be coming here like once a week.",

The resturant is very small and we had to wait about 20 minutes but it was worth it. The service was fast and friendly. Also, I liked the fact that you could choose the level of spiciness which for me was mild and my wife hot. I can assure you there was a difference. Next time we are in Vegas which is one or twice a year we will return.",

    "text": "Just walked out of this \"four-star\" ramen place with my friend and are we glad we have a place to vent and will explain why here: First, the broth was okay. Noodle (whatever and however you have going on behind the window near the entrance) was nothing special. Servants are very polite to some degree some might get annoyed and call them fake. Funny to see the cooks were Hispanics and tried to greet customers in Japanese with a heavy accent (this does not factor into our rating). Hear this: our ramen soups had no eggs and only one thin piece of pork. Are you kidding us!? This is America where we are not as tiny as some of you and we don't pay adult prices to be served tiny kids meals!!! They served just about everything from chashu pork, fried garlic, black mushrooms, chives, ground pork, bamboo shoots, sesame oil, and shredded red pepper ultra small so you don't get enough and have to  pay more (close to $20 per bowl) to get more. Maybe we should be as STINGY as them but one star is the CHEAPEST I can give so there you have it. We don't see the value here at all. In fact, not even close. We have paid less and received a lot more (four ultra-thick porks and realistically maybe 20 times more than here) before. If you want the name of that restaurant, contact us and we'll gladly inform you which one it is). This restaurant is just way too STINGY and we will NO DOUBT NEVER BE BACK! Moving forward, we better turn off our phones now to save power (and money) as the lesson I learned eating at such a STINGY dining establishment. Actually, to be honest, this got to be one of the cheapest restaurants we have ever experienced.",

This last visit I went for miso broth (pork and chicken) and I also added an egg and corn. My noodles were a little under cooked on top so I just mixed them to the bottom and that finished them off. They were fairly busy so I think that's why the noodles were ready all the way through but it wasn't really a problem. Service was good when we sat but we did have to wait a while for the check even with our dishes having been cleared already.  Overall a good place for ramen on the southwest side of town.",

They seemed more concerned that their wi-fi went out and the music was off than anything else. I know it hasn't been open for long but we will probably not take a chance on a second visit.

Normally I don't care to write a review even though I'm quite the noodle aficionado, but I was certainly compelled to as I was quite disappointed to find out your restaurant was closed when I made it a point to take time out of my day and to drive over to your location specifically to try you folks out at 3pm - just to find out you were closed. You most certainly should post your hours on Yelp so other reviewers are aware of your gap in hours, closing at 2:30pm just to reopen at 5pm. Or post it on the web since everyone has access to the Internet nowadays and that info would have been most helpful. Even though you have Monta Ramen and Monta Chaya under your belt, I would rethink the financial strength of this new business venture and the ingredients compromised if saving 2.5 hours out of your day helps your bottom line NOI. And hopefully I won't see this facility show up on Dirty Dining as well like Monta in the past. And so considering you are promoting the grand opening of your restaurant, this is certainly a easy way to lose business and to lose a client like myself.",

In my opinion two major components in ramen make it work... Noodles and soup. Noodles here are thinner than the other two Monta shops and in my opinion not as good.  They were soft and had no texture imho. It may have been an off day but the other two Monta shops don't have off days with their noodles. Soup was decent but much less flavorful and had lots of floating fat chunks which the other two shops don't. I don't think it's a flavor thing, instead maybe rushing the process of the broth.   My mild miso came with bean sprouts which I never ordered, and after taking them out my server noticed and made a comment about me not liking them... Sorry but I didn't order bean sprouts, but was definitely charged for it. Weird. Minor mistake but left a bad taste in my mouth...could've been the chunks of fat   If you're going to mention you're a part of the Monta family, understand you'll be held to high standards. Those standards have not been met at this location just yet.",

The broth was creamy, but not too thick and was delish. I ordered one non spicy for the kids and they shared a bowl (being 5 and 8) and it was perfect.  The noodles are made fresh in house and that was the next best part. They were chewy and had great texture.  Will definitely be back.

Walked in and got seated within 5 minutes.  We all ordered the same thing the tonkatsu ramen. When it came mine had no pork in it. I kindly asked the waiter named Rachel and she then proceeded to the kitchen. She then told her other coworker which he rolled his eyes. Hey not my mistake it was theirs. She brings it and I was kind of surprised because it was only a single thin slice. I guess I'm use to other ramen places where they put 2. My sister made a remark \" oh so small\". The waitress over heard and came to our table saying  \" only comes with 1 piece\" weird because she was eavesdropping. I also forgot to tell them no veggies in mine or my sister's. But that was my mistake. No problem so I picked them out. The same waitress proceeded to our table once again and said \" next time order no veggies so you're not picking everything out\" in a very rude manner.  Is she out of her mind? Talking to a customer like that. I work in customer and food. I wouldn't dare talk like that. We were all pretty taken back by her rude comments. Her and her coworker would not stop dogging our table and talking about us. Clearly In a different language (Chinese)  The whole time my family felt uncomfortable. Not to mention they never checked up on us once.  She was also arguing with the chefs in the kitchen. Not only could we hear her but other customers turned their attention to them.  Sigh, this place has really good ramen. Not sure if we'll be back though. To sum everything up  Great food, shitty service!",

The noodles are made fresh in-house. You can actually see this in action right before you walk into the main entrance. The broth was not salty. This was very appetizing since all of the ramen spots I've tried in town are too salty to the point where I am unable to finish the soup. You can easily distinguish the fresh tasting noodles. It was very smooth and the texture was perfect. This bowl was the first ramen bowl that I have ever finished. I only got the half bowl of the pork belly. It was served over rice. The belly was sliced very thin with just the right amount of seasoning. The rice used is the sushi grade quality. Tender with a hint of sweetness. All the condiments were neatly arranged. I also like that they still have napkin dispensers at arm's reach. Prices are very reasonable. I highly recommend this place and I will definitely return when I am craving authentic Japanese ramen.",

The space is small but cute, kind of reminds me of a restaurant you'd see in New York. I don't know how to explain why it's good other than it just tastes better . My only complaint is I wish it was open later.",

The menu isn't massive, but what they do have, they do WELL.  The Ramen is fresh, and made ON SITE. You can't go wrong with that. Broths are tasty (I've had the Miso and Shoyu) and you can get a ton of add ins for a fairly reasonable price. Definitely hope this place stays open for a long time!",

Fast forward a few weeks and apparently \"they can't do that\". Now what they CAN do is Shoyu Ramen with no toppings, which is the same price as with ALL the toppings, which is $8.95.  It's still yummy, I just don't like the trend of price hiking once a restaurant becomes established.. Don't get me wrong, I'm not cheap, I add about $6-7 worth of upgrades to my ramen alone but come on.",

Sat down to eat a few times before and was helped to find a good ramen that suited my tastes. Not much options for beverages, but good enough. Easy enough to take out order too, just a little unfortunate this is the closest ramen place to me. Sadly, nothing special, overpriced a bit and you don't really get your money's worth half the time.

    "text": "Mhm! This place is definitely a great addition to the Monta family. We decided to check out this restaurant based off a recommendation and were happy we did!   I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen with medium spicy and a soft-boiled egg. The appetizer menu was fairly limited, but they did offer four different ramen broths, a huge variety of toppings ($$) and the standard pork belly and chasu bowls.  Advice: If you're a huge meat eater, order additional chasu. If you want an egg, get it. Need extra carbs? Get it! Your ramen bowl, even with the additional toppings, will still cost you less than a Bay Area ramen restaurant ;)  Pros: - Spice! Mhm. If you're looking to add a kick to your ramen, this place delivers. - Ground Pork was super flavorful. - Noodles were chewy!  - Clean restaurant  Cons: - Service was slow for a non-busy time. - Broth was a little too light for me. If I'm getting Tonkotsu, I sort of expect a super creamy and rich soup. - Only one chasu slice offered, but maybe that was a good thing. It's delicious, but super fatty!  Overall, this place was decent and I'd come again. I still prefer Monta Chaya or Monta Ramen over this place. For about two people, we paid $25ish with tip and tax.",

They make their noodles in house which are nice and thick and they also offer you a spice level which you don't get that option at Monta. From the broth to the meat and fixens, it was a really good meal. Place is small but they do a great job of getting people in and out, no complaints.",

We came on Saturday right when they opened and we were surprised that people were already outside the door waiting in line and thought this place must have some tasty ramen! We were seated right away and liked the design of the place - there was a ramen bar and the tables are pretty close to one another so heads up that you'll be getting comfy with other parties next to you lol.   The menu also include fried rice bowls and the various toppings you can add to your ramen. The vegan ramen sounded so promising, especially after all the great reviews but now I'm thinking maybe it's cause they just opened for the day that the broth didn't get to settle? I'm not sure but it was SO watered down, to the point that I honestly thought I was just eating ramen in hot water. I had to add more salt and some soy sauce and even hot sauce to try to make the meal more enjoyable, but nothing worked. Our friend ordered the chicken ramen and also wasn't satisfied; there was just something about our broths that made the experience an unsatisfying one.   We did enjoy the small bowl of fried rice but believe me when I say, it was definitely small lol.   Overall, I'm not sure if it was just our visit but I really wanted to like this place and sadly, that just didn't happen.",

I came in here one night about an hour before closing. The place was still banging and full of patrons. From the looks at the podium there was a mad wait list at one point. I was Flying solo I took a seat at the countertop. I actually enjoy sitting at the countertop as you can watch the \"magic\" happen. I was a little perturbed that the wait staff was more concerned about taking care of their closing tasks vs waiting on guests. I had to watch the wait staff team walk past me several times before I was able to get my order in.   The noodle making stuff had been shut down for the day so that bummed me out.. I guess it's bad luck to make noddles in the dark.   The ramen was a bit on the small side however proportionate for the price. I did feel that my original order was a little on this light side compared to my kaedama order. The first set of noodles were perfect. Just the right firmness and texture. The kaedama on the other hand was a bit overcooked and on the soggy side.   The broth was nothing fancy decent but nothing to wow about.   My visit here was a miss .. maybe it was the timing or maybe this is how it is here.. not sure.. the jury is still out..   Till then the choice is yours..",

This is my go to spot since it's just across the street from my house and there's no complaints here. The staff is probably the sweetest,   most accommodating people I've encounter in an Asian restaurant ever.   I always order the original shoyu ramen (which is chicken broth) with chashu chicken, ground chicken (I opt out of anything pork in soups), mushrooms, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, corn, nori, soft boiled egg and kimchi. The broth is the best part of it all. The right amount of saltiness with tons of chicken flavor. The noodles are a perfect mixture of firm and soft all at once. And all the fixings just make their ramen my favorite.   My son orders the chashu pork bowl with rice and shredded nori and he can put it away (like any growing boy).   Our favorite appetizer is the chashu pork baos. A little pork sandwich with mayo lettuce and chashu pork.   There are so many ramen spots to choose from in Las Vegas, but be sure to stop here when you're in the area.  They never disappoint.",

The menu options are very straightforward. Which I don't mind because the more options I have, the more indecisive I become.   The ramen itself was pretty good. I got the Tonkatsu with medium spice level and black garlic oil. At first it looked like a crap ton of oil, but it actually wasn't. Flavors were well balanced. I can handle my fair share of heat, but even the medium seemed to have a stronger kick than I imagined (no complaints!) so I started white girl sweating",

It's a small place with limited seating. You can either sit on the table or in the bar. We enjoyed watching the man making ramen noodles in front of us in the waiting area. My favorite here is Miso Ramen mild (sometimes medium) with Nitamago and its a perfect meal for a cold or snowy night indeed! Eggs are cooked in perfection. Ramen noodles are fresh and broth is so flavorful. $1 if you want to add extra broth. Quick and friendly service. Oh! Don't forget to try their chasu buns, they were great too.",

    "text": "The ramen here is good if you're in the area. I use to go here a lot after I gymmed at EOS, but now that I don't I wouldn't go out of my way to go to ramen kobo. Even though it still tastes good, I think there are better options out there. First off, the menu is pretty limited. I really do love how the noodles here are handmade and they let you see that. However, I prefer thick noodles and I don't have the option to do that here. I hope to see more items on the menu in the future - maybe then I'll come back! As for the broth, they don't have very much flavor if you get it no spicy, and the broth is the most important part of any soup! Not the spice. Adding the spice covers up the bland soup in my opinion. Whenever I get ramen here without spice I always have to add butter or soy sauce, especially to the veggie broth. I understand how a veggie broth is naturally more bland, but the veggie broths at Jinya taste perfectly fine by themselves. I really don't have this problem at other ramen shops. If you're a spice lover though, this place is definitely for you since a majority of the flavor is in the spice!!! I personally just don't handle spice very well but my sibling that does loves this place. The inside is very small, and there can be a long wait. It gets pretty loud inside too, so it's a little difficult to talk to the people you're with. Overall it's not a bad place though! I'll stop by if I'm in the area if I'm craving ramen, but not my first choice!",

I like the heat of the \"mild\"as it's not too hot to cover the flavor of this yummy broth. The pork is nicely fatty, which I love.  I actually add extra pork and soft boiled egg Overall this ramen is flavorful and filling.  This time I had takeout and the pork was cold, so I microwaved the broth so it was extra hot to compensate and heat through the pork.  I do wish there was more broth.   The pork belly bowl is also really tasty. I usually get the small as a side dish for sharing or if I'm feeling particularly ravenous.",

I love how small and quaint this restaurant is, although that leads to long wait times, the experience and food is always worth it. They make their ramen there, and there is a window for you to see while you are waiting for your table!  The menu is limited, but you will not be disappointed with whatever you get. Their kimchi fried rice is so good, you must get it along with your ramen. I have never had better fried rice! You can customize your ramen bowl with many different options, I typically tend to get shoyu ramen (chick broth) with chashu chicken, nitamago (soft boiled egg... YUM), and corn. I am not big on super spicy, but my boyfriend gets the fire spice level and says it adds so much to flavor and is not so spicy that it's not enjoyable.  If you sit at the bar, you get to watch everyone make your meal. The chefs are fun and very friendly. I love this ramen spot and recommend that you give it a try! Just be prepared for a wait.",

    "text": "Decided to finally try this place after three years here in Las Vegas. I have a couple of go to spots but I heard a lot of the locals raving about this place and I had to totally try it.  I guess The big Lord is the front area where you can see them spinning or making their fresh noodles. Come during the day because I guess that's when they do it. At night not so much. Place is tiny like most of the Ramen places here in Vegas. Long narrow I'll away with about 12 seats at the counter and about six or seven tables. The menu is very traditional and very limited. If you're used to some of the tourist places in Chinatown this won't be for you. Handful of selections are very limited.  Started off with an order of the traditional fried rice. Decided to get it vegetarian with no meat. Decent serving size for the price. Not over cooked and well seasoned. Give this one a very hefty 4/5. Flavor profile really did it for me. Ask for extra pickle ginger.  After that decided to go with the veggie Ramen and the shoyu ramen. Both of the broths seem kind of bland. Not chock-full of flavors. You could definitely taste the freshness of the noodles but once again they were just OK. Definitely had to ask for seasoning and spices on the side. You think the prices are decent but once you chalk up some of the extras that you might get for cheap or for free at other places each ball comes out to about $20.  Portion sizes are decent. We had left over from both soups. Not sure if it was because we were full or because it just wasn't that great. Like I said, then going to a couple of the other places for a few years and noticed flavor profiles were way different. And the price point was a little disappointing. In all fairness I think before you pass judgment or you pick a favorite, try at least 3 to 5 different Ramen places to really know what you like and want. I did notice this was more of an after work style place where people came in alone sat at the counter ordered some soup eat really quickly then left. Not really a fun atmosphere to come out and hang with friends.  Staff was pretty friendly and eager to help. Place was clean. Just not my favorite.",

    "text": "Tiny restaurant but like that you can watch the fresh noodle-making while you wait. The menu is simple, with 4 ramen soup base types for $8.95 all with the same ingredients to which you can add more for $1-1.50 each. There are a handful of additional menu items - handmade dumplings, chasu pork baos, fried rice etc. but you really come here for the ramen. Having tried original and mild, I'd recommend mild which is a little spicy and has more of a kick than the original non-spicy soup base, but it's all good. Draft beer is only $2.95. The service is good and food comes out fast so for a tiny restaurant they turn over tables quickly.   They have a second location on Spring Mountain, maybe that one is bigger.  Nothing fancy but can totally see this becoming a regular stop.",

At times medium will be super spicy & sometimes hot will not be that spicy. This doesn't really bother me that much. Also, seating can be a little bit small.",

The wait can be a bit long depending on when you go, but I say it's worth it.  I always get the Tonkotsu Ramen original just because by itself is delicious and doesn't need to be altered unless you want it spicy, I usually like adding garlic paste.  I like the noodles cause it's not too soft or too firm, it's just right.  They also have red ginger and vinegar you can add to your broth.  Also the Pork Belly Bowl is to die for, they have other appetizers but we always ALWAYS get this one!  Lol.  And Rachel never ceases to amaze me with her outstanding service to us and all the customers that come in.  Her sweet charm and smile is always a pleasure to see!  I pretty much recommend anyone to come here for well-worth ramen.  If you're looking for a place to have some, this is it. =)",

I think that is their selling point but I didn't taste any different except that the noodles don't stick together.  The broth is salty. The meat is thin. Compare to other ramen place, they are missing the usual toppings such as marinated bamboo and egg. To add one egg, it is $1.50 extra which bring one bowl of simple noodle to over $10. The place is small but with not too long of a wait.  This place is very average and the value is not good. I guess it is good for locals who don't like to drive far or wait too long. I will not come again because the food is very average and not competitive.",

    "text": "First off.. I really wanted to like this place. I was happy there was another ramen shop in our area of town, and couldnt wait for this place to open when I saw it was coming a few months back. When I called in I had to repeat myself about 4 times to the person taking the order. I understood though, as it was around the 6pm dinner rush. When I got there to pick up the food, there was no parking, so I had to drive around 3 times to actually get a spot. When I walked in there was no one at the hostess stand, except for a lady placing an order on an ipad. A sever came over and asked me \" If I needed anything?\", and I said yes, Im here to pick up an order. She walked away towards the kitchen for what I thought was my food, Even though there were 2 bags of orders on the counter directly behind her. Instead of looking for my food, she went to grab orders for people that were sat down. Someone came out of the back to the hostess stand about 2-3 minutes later and asked me what I needed... Again. I tell her, the first server came back and started to try and help me but ended up giving my food to another customer that walked in. Then she took it back and gave it to me and I paid.. The guy got upset.. even though I was there first.. and called me an a-hole as I walked out. To summarize, they are disorganized.   The food was not what I had expected. I ordered the tonkotsu Spice level 4.. broth was like salted creamy water. The chashu I ordered was almost all fat, and you have to pay extra for sprouts and egg. My wife and son ordered the shoyu ramen, they were not impressed. We also got a small order of the fried rice that everyone has reviewed so much, and spoke so highly about... It had a distinct fishy taste to it. My son is sort of a 4 year old ramen aficionado. The kid loves it and is very vocal about what he likes and doesnt like about it. I have to go with his instincts and agree this is not some place I would recommend. Maybe if we all ordered something different, or we ate there it might be better. After the first time I dont know if I care to try that out.",

I wanted beer but they didn't have the beers yet. Why would you open without having all of the products that are on the menu? Whatever so I had a Coke. Let's be realistic here, a can of Coke does not cost $1.25. At Monta (same owner) it's only $1. It's .25 cents more but that .25 shows a lot. Very easy menu to me so I love that. Not too many options so you're not stuck for 20 minutes trying to pick what you want which is awesome because you turn over tables faster. They don't have gyoza. This is the first ramen place that doesn't have gyoza on the menu. I got the chashu bowl and asked for it with extra sauce. The server said okay and my man ordered the pork belly bowl with extra sauce. They came back without sauce and were so dry. The pork was dry and my chashu was really delicious. Just too try. Apparently they don't come with sauce. Then don't say okay? I understand that it's their second day but that's so obnoxious. Learn the menu before opening. When he told the manager and server about the dryness, no apology, didn't comp it off, and nothing. All she said was that it's their second day. Congrats. It's a restaurant. I had eggs in my ramen but they came on the side even before the ramen???? You could've waited to put it in? I don't know. The food was fine but not to my standards.",

The place is small and thin, with the small bar counter up against the kitchen like a ramen house should be. Best ramen houses are holes in the wall. This is just a nicely interior decorated hole in the wall. Greeted at the door by multiple people. Served our drinks and waited on very quickly. It is close to closing and not packed, so I'd hope for that. But it's never guaranteed. Everybody was very nice. I started typing this review after we put in our order, and we just got the order. Fast. Ordered tonkatsu ramen with egg, medium heat. Let's see how it tastes...  Delicious. Broth is nice and thick, slightly fatty--like it should be. Pork melts in your mouth. Noodles--since they're freshly made here, they're springy and delicious. Egg is done perfectly. Everything about it is great. They use garlic chives, and didn't skimp with just green onion. The medium is quite spicy. And my husband and I both love spicy. So for the person who had mild and felt it wasn't spicy, there must be a large jump between mild and medium. But that's normal for most Asian cuisine. Portion is great.  Rachel and Maru came around multiple times to give us more of our drinks, and make sure we were happy. Highly recommend this place. First great ramen place outside of Chinatown. And it's near my house!!! Score!!!!",

Another disappointment was the taste of the broth.  We ordered miso and tonkasu and it both fell short. Not to mention we also asked for spicy and it wasn't as spicy as we imagined 3 pepper signs to be.  First time having chives in Ramen rather than scallions??? Cha Shui was sliced super thin. Also add ons toppings were around $1-1.50, more than average ramen joints around town.  All in all, pretty disappointed.  For around the same price I prefer Monta, Sora, or Ramen Tatsu",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try this ramen shop since it opened in my neighbourhood. Finally, I had a chance to stop by for lunch on a weekday.  I arrived around 12:30 pm and it wasn't busy inside. There were only about 10 customers inside.  The interior was nice and I took a seat at their bar.  I like to see the cook's skill in preparing the ramen.  But to my surprise all the cooks and waiter were Hispanics with the exception of the hostess who was Asian female.  Stepping into a Japanese ramen joint, I expected that the cook(s) would be Japanese.  Maybe I am just too traditional.  So, even though I was skeptical, I was interested to see how authentic they could prepare the ramen bowl.  I only order their Tonkotsu ramen as I wasn't all that hungry.  I must say that I wasn't impressed.  For $8.95 + tax, you get one small piece of char siu in the bowl and no ajitsuku tamago (egg). The broth was nothing special as it was not rich and creamy. The presentation was just meh.    I wasn't too happy that I could not pay with a credit card as I had to spend over $10 to use a credit card.  When I left, no one said one word to me.  No bye, no thank you!?! This place is so not typical of a Japanese ramen joint, where their staff are usually very polite and thankful.  My verdict, I definitely will not be going back to this place.     Click here to Reply or Forward",

    "text": "Ramen Kobo is one of our go to restaurants when my family is craving for ramen.  There are not many tables like a typical ramen house.  We try to go before 6 to avoid waiting for a table as we are a family of 5.  They make the noodles fresh in-house.  The kids enjoy watching the noodles being made as we wait for out table.  I usually order the miso ramen.  I like tonkatsu ramen at Monta but I prefer the miso at Ramen Kobo.  The fried rice is good but we like the fried rice at Monta slightly better.  It's in the southwest side of town where there are not many choices when it comes to ramen houses.    If you do not want to drive to spring mountain Chinatown area and live in the southwest side of town I recommend Ramen Kobo.",

Unlike the other ones you have to pick one and edit it to what you really want.   Their broth(soup) is flavorful and the spice levels are actually actuate. Would be cool if they had a thicker noodle. But hey, at least it's made fresh and you can see it being made as you walk in to the right. Seating is kinda limited but it's still a fun place to go to get your ramen fix.   One thing keeping me from giving them a five star is the skimpy portion of the ground pork.   If you haven't been to the restaurant, you should give them a try!",

    "text": "I moved out to Vegas a few months ago and have been trying different ramen restaurants. Ramen KoBo is by far the tastiest one I've been to.   FOOD:  Any place that makes their own noodles fresh in the restaurant is already ahead of the game but the broth is what actually matters. I ordered the spicy tonkatsu ramen which comes with one slice of cha shu, ground pork, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and bean sprouts. For an extra $1.50, I added an egg, which still blows my mind that ramen places will charge extra for that (minus 1 start for that). I'm used to the egg being included. Anyway, for spicy lovers who like the kick of chili but still want their taste buds, medium is perfect. Not only did I eat all the noodles, but also drank all the broth.   QUALITY: You can't beat homemade noodles. And the broth was exactly what it needed to be. I can see how some people might complain about the saltiness but flavor of the broth is still delicious.   PRICE: It's about $9 for a bowl of ramen and extra ingredients range from $1.50 to $3.00. They also have sides for about $5-6, and beer within the $2 range (pretty affordable)!  CUSTOMER SERVICE:  Friendly staff. Two girls came to check on me periodically and refilled my water.   ENVIRONMENT: This place is somewhat tiny so I can see it getting packed during dinner hours. There is a ramen bar and dining table area.   Overall, I will come here again whenever I'm craving ramen!",

    "text": "Ramen KoBo executes ramen very well, but the lack of toppings on the preset ramen combinations prevent this place from reaching 5 stars.  The restaurant is fairly small, so don't bring giant groups to this place or else you'll have to wait awhile. Also, just a note: they only seat full parties and the waiting area is always pretty cramped. But my wait was actually fairly quick, considering we had a party of 8. Our waiter was friendly; he was also efficient as he got our waters right away and he took our orders without hesitation.   I ended up getting a mild Miso Ramen. I'll let you know right now, this was not mild. I'm usually good with spice/spices, but this place was a little too much for me. I would recommend choosing a spiciness level one below you think if you're like me and THINK you can handle spiciness. Even though the ramen was a bit too spicy, I could still taste the depth and flavor of the ramen. It was salty, smooth, and everything I could ask for in a ramen broth.   The noodles were the best part of the dish though. Handmade right in the restaurant, the noodles were long and cooked to perfection. Other places tend to overcook the noodles, making them limp and soggy, but not this place. Since they were cut bigger than usual, they had a good bite to it, and they absorbed the flavors of the broth very well.   The preset combination disappointed me though. It had the typical ingredients: chashu pork, fried garlic, black mushrooms, chives, ground pork, bamboo shoots, sesame oil, and shredded red pepper. But my problem was that it wasn't enough. And if you want to add extra ingredients, go for it! But expect to pay upwards of $15 to $20 for your ramen. That's a little steep for ramen if you ask me.  Overall, this place is great. From the fresh handmade noodles to the flavorful broth, Ramen Kobo knows ramen and knows it well. Just be warned that the ramen is SPICY and the extra ingredients will definitely rack up your bill!",

They have a vegan ramen that the daughter states is out of this world.  I also tasted it and the broth was fantastic. I find it hard to get a really good broth for a vegan or vegetarian style ramen, however, this was excellent.  2.  Besides the vegan choice, we had a Shoyu Ramen and a tonkatsu ramen.  I had extra mustard greens with my Shoyu Ramen and also had it original.  3.  The noodles were excellent and homemade and fresh.  The broth, was very delicate with bits of oil floating from the bone broth and from the chashu pork that was in the ramen.  The pork was very tender and fall apart moist.  Loved it.  The noodles themselves were firm and had a great texture.  Perfect amount of vegetables to round out this tasty ramen.  I will be back to try more spicier versions of their dishes.  I wanted to be able to taste the broth without be hidden by the spices.  Good quick service, hot soup and tasty food.  GK says, check it out. Just be careful, it is a fairly small restaurant.",

The best ramen I've ever had was in Japan and no other ramen shop in Vegas has come close to it except for Ramen Kobo!   First, Ramen Kobo is five minutes away from my house which is so convenient for me. Their parking space in the complex is a bit small so at times it can be annoying to find a parking spot when it's busy.  Upon walking in, you're immediately welcomed by the hostess and even the cooks with a smile!   There are so many options to chose from their menu when it comes to the toppings and special dishes. I personally do not order extra dishes just because their ramen fills me up so I had never tried any until today. My boyfriend ordered their Pork Belly Bowl and it tasted so savory with the right amount of salt and sesame oil. Perhaps, I'll order it for myself on my next visit.   My usual order is their Shoyu Ramen (the chicken broth) because it's simplicity at its best! I keep it original and add in chicken, corn, and butter. All together it tastes perfectly balanced. Their noodles are especially soft and I love how it's house-made!   I believe that Ramen Kobo was made by the same creator as Ramen Monta down at Spring Mountain. Both are similar in my opinion but Ramen Kobo offers more selections in toppings. The price of the ramen is just a couple of dollars extra than Monta. I love both ramen shops equally but bonus points for Ramen Kobo just because it's close to me!   Some do not like how small the restaurant is but I love it because in Japan that's how small ramen shops usually are. Overall, Ramen Kobo is delicious and I recommend it to anyone looking for a quick heartily meal. The service is typically fast and always friendly!",

    "text": "Yummy tasting ramen spot down the street from my place! Their house made noodles keep me coming back!   I usually get the same thing, Spicy Tonkatsu Ramen w/ extra pork! If I'm feeling a bit hungrier than usual, I get some pan fried potstickers! Food comes out very quick, within minutes almost! I really enjoy how the pork melts in your mouth after letting it sit in the broth.   One of the cheaper ramen spots I've seen, that is very yummy at the same time, which is always a good thing! Waits can be quick or long depending on how many people are in front of you. It is fairly quick because usually most customers when they finish, they leave right away.   Docked a star because the actual restaurant itself as far as size could be bigger, I feel like I have to walk like a pancake in between the aisle of the bar and the tables due to being so crammed together. The tables are very close together so trying to have a conversation may not be too easy for your own ears, but nonetheless, the food will always be worth it to me.   Will definitely comeback!!",

The flavors and options are outstanding and the prices are decent. The service is fast and friendly and the restaurant is clean and comfortable. If you are obsessed with ramen or Asian soup in general, this should be on your go-to list. It doesn't hurt a bit that it's pretty near my home",

    "text": "I'm a big fan of ramen, so when I saw this place made their own noodles in house, I had to go!  The place is small and was busy from the time we arrived to the time we left. The service was really good, but the check in made feel like I was at a Dr.'s Office. The window into the noodle making room was a nice touch.   The prices are reasonable ramen prices. What I really liked was the many add ins that were available. For example: I added black garlic oil to mine, while my brother added butter to his, and his girlfriend added corn. Another plus was the ability to select a heat level. I got medium, which was fine not too spicy, but I think the heat took away from the broth. If I went again I'd try the not spicy version. My crazy brother got the hottest they could make it and he really enjoyed it (*note: he goes out of his way to try the spiciest foods he can find. I could smell his from across the table and it knew I couldn't handle it.)  We also got the Gyoza and fried rice appetizers to share. I LOVED the steamed gyoza. Super delicious. The fried rice was also good. But the real star was the ramen. Their broth was well balanced and not too salty. The pork was cooked perfectly. I always felt like ramen could be heartier and they achieve that by doing sliced and ground pork. The smaller bits of ground pork would stick to the noodle and add these little hints of meaty goodness. Speaking of noodles, the noodles were perfect. Light and delicate, they fell apart in my mouth. It's like they were just tight enough to stand up to the broth.  I can't wait to go back!",

They have a decent menu of different ramen choices. Strangely, though, some of the traditional ramen inclusions like soft boiled eggs are an extra charge.   We tried the kimchi fried rice which was pretty good. Not too greasy and with a pleasant flavor. Slightly salty.   The ramen was overall decent with a flavorful broth and tender pork. The broth had an odd red color which might be related to the spices and seasonings they use.   Staff were friendly but seemed scripted with what seemed like memorized statements rather than genuine appreciation.   This was overall a decent ramen choice, but there are definitely better ramen choices in Vegas.",

Firstly, the place is pretty small like other ramen places, only a few tables and seats in the bar, so if you're a big party, expect a wait. Second, the menu has many options like the usual shoyu and miso but I like that there was a veggie option, so definitely vegan friendly. Their add ins are also pretty diverse so definitely a lot of options for anyone. They also have bao bun sandwiches which looked interesting but I was pretty full so I couldn't order it. I got the miso ramen with corn and soft boiled egg add ins, and the flavors were on point, well balanced and meaty and hearty. The server recommended to have the spice on the side so I can control how spicy I want it, which I thought was an amazing recommendation so it should the servers know their menu well. Definitely coming back here to try that bao bun and other things in the menu.",

The menu is very limited there are not a lot of options. The broth is good and had some flavor, but it was not extraordinary either.

Food: I always order Tonkutsu ramen (medium spice with 2x corn). It has the right amount of spice and creaminess, goes so well with the freshly made noodles. My wife gets the same ramen but with mild level of spice. Mild is still spicy, so if you don't like spicy food, you can get it with no spice.   Service: We always get great customer service here. They got friendly staff, and even if they're always busy, they never fail to check in on you and make sure everything is good. Service is quick too, so you get your order right away.

The negative was that the chasu pork was basically tossed in at the end such that half of each piece was still cold. I rectified that but I'd have preferred if it came fully immersed. Service is your usual, fairly fast ramen experience. Prices are reasonable for what you get, and I brought home half of my dinner for a second meal. So, a good experience. Misc: You can see the preparation of the noodles while you're waiting to be seated. So, you know you're getting something fresh. That's good because you're probably going to have a wait, particularly if you are set on having a table.",

Ramen Kobo has very limited seating, a couple tables and bar seating. I wouldn't reccomend for large parties but for smaller parties yes. The wait time can be awhile. As you walk in they have on the right a window to watch the fresh noodles being made. Yummy!  The menu is limited and doesn't offer a lot but covers the basics of a ramen joint. I always like gyoza with my ramen but unfortunately this place doesn't have any. They do have fried rice, chashu bowl, pork belly bowl and some chashu buns also. The chashu and pork belly bowl come highly recommended but i have honestly had better elsewhere. The meat is more on the undercooked, rubbery side. I just prefer mines cooked more and more sauce. Not my favorite. Even the chashu in the ramen wasn't the greatest.  The staff are nice but seemed in such a rush to get orders in and orders out, as we were sat they asked if we were ready to order. I said no we just sat down and haven't looked at the menu yet. Ha!  This is not my favorite place and it was our first time as customers here but we probably won't be back. I have had better ramen and chashu elsewhere. The best thing here probably was the noodles being made fresh here but everything else was mediocre.",

Service was quick and efficient. A tad rushed toward the end, but I understand. Thankfully, we did not have to wait at all upon arriving.  The menu was very basic. 3 broth options with custom spice levels. There were also a several add-on options. I opted for the Tonkatsu Ramen with a spice level 1 and added nitamago (soft-boiled egg). Ramen Kobo is the first establishment that I have been to that does not include nitamago in the basic toppings. The tonkatsu broth was not overwhelming with flavor. I think adding a slight spice level made it a lot better. However, it was decent and overall still enjoyable.  The chashu buns were good. I wish the pieces of chashu were a little more abundant but the flavor was definitely there.  Ramen Kobo may not be my absolute favorite but for the convenience and closeness to home, I will definitely be back.",

People just running around.  Im a big ramen fan, but for $8-$9 for basic ramen there is almost nothing in it.  I rather them charge me more and at least throw in an extra piece of lettuce or something. Everything you add is an extra dollar, even for some extra hot paste and scallions.  Although broth is not bad.  Seating is pretty cramped and hot as well.  Not a great experience.",

I usually went to 'monta' near china town which is the first ramen restaurant of the company, also known as 'Mon restaurant group' to enjoy my favorite shoyu ramen. It's another version of their ramen restaurant. Soup had very deep flavor, and the 'home made noodle' was very tasty. For this time, it seems like they are pursuing even high quality ramen. Much more outstanding than any other ramen store in town!",

Yeah, every time one of my friends hears this, they insist that I just haven't tried THEIR favorite spot. Ugh...five attempts later, I still don't like it. I was hesitant to try ramen, thinking it was just another name for pho. Besides, when I think of ramen, I think of the messy $.29 packets my kids love. However, I wasn't feeling good one day and decided I needed some soup. I looked at the menu, and it seemed like there was a chance I wouldn't hate it. Well, I found that not only do I not hate, but I actually LOVE it, and I love Ramen KoBo. I've tried the chicken and the pork and just prefer the chicken. I add egg to mine, and I love it spicy. I discovered this place a month ago, and I've been known to eat here twice a week or more. It is a small place and can get busy, so you might have to wait. However, it's really worth it! Also, they're open late, which works for me when I forget to eat dinner and suddenly find that it is after 9pm.",

    "text": "Pretty good ramen.  I wish I left my order all original to give it a more equal comparison to other Vegas ramen. Instead I got too excited and ordered the tonkatsu with black garlic oil and spice level hot. This ramen joint is about the spice level so be a bit adventurous with your spice level. It isn't as spicy as I thought it would be but I have been told that my level of spicy is pretty much lava. Next time I will get spice level fire. Mind this, you can ask for chili on the side if you want to be cautious. The chili they use has a good kick that hits you in the back of the throat but it does go away fairly quickly. It's not smokey the way some dried chili oils are. Kobo's chili is a ground dried chili with oil rather than an oil with dried chili bits in it. This allows the chili oil to not overpower or sit on top of the broth. Normally the oil will add extra fat/heaviness to the already rich tonkatsu broth but it doesn't. I would recommend people to add on extra chashu. You only get one slice in the regular order but the extra comes with 4 slices. The noodles are a little thicker since they are homemade. It's good and you can taste the freshness BUT I am a thin ramen noodle kind of girl.  Let's compare Kobo to two other ramen places: Moko and Monta. Kobo is definitely way better than Moko. It's plain and simple that Kobo's flavor is just taste better. I have tried Moko on many occasions and it's not bad. Kobo's broth surpasses Moko's broth. Now compared to Monta, Kobo is just a step behind. Yes Kobo is the product of Monta, but the only reason for my opinion is the noodles. Like I said before, I am a thin noodle person. I prefer the snap of the thin noodles rather than the softer homemade noodles. Both broths are fantastic. The chashu is fantastic. Service is great. Just because I prefer Monta's noodles does not mean I hate Kobo. This was my first visit but not the last. Definitely my new ramen place.   Added note: the parking is soooooooooooo much better than Monta's parking lot. I have changed dinner plans before when Monta didn't have any parking in the parking lot or side streets.",

    "text": "I recently discovered this place which is only 3 minutes away from me. Their pictures looks great, actual food not so much. Especially spicy level HOT is nothing but super greasy. My favorite ramen places are near China town, so I don't like driving there all the time. I ate at this place for 4 times. The last time I ate there, I could sense they aren't happy with me most probably because I only tip around 18% up to over 20%. If you guys eat at Japanese restaurants, you'll know they are very welcoming, and everyone greets when customers are leaving, unless it's not an open kitchen. In this case, they have open kitchen. They greet people leaving the restaurant. I was not greeted at all last time, when I was walking out, two people was at the counter, only a waiter behind me greeted me. I went there earlier tonight, I already walked up near the kitchen where all the tables are at, they aren't busy, restaurant was more than half vacant. No one greeted me and the chefs were all standing there watching me, one fat guy looked pissed off at me the entire time, one lady was emotionless, one guy kind of smiled a little bit when I did. I've been standing there like an idiot, looking back and forth at these guys made me felt very uncomfortable, especially the fat guy, like dude, seriously?! That's how a 7 years old girl would act like if you get her mad. It was too uncomfortable for the way they were judging me, so I left. On the check, it lists how much to tip for 15%, 18%, and 20%. If you give the option to tipping, and I have been tipping within the tipping range, why have to be an jerk? I never tipped under 15%, even if I have, it is an acceptable tip. I like to leave changes so my bill adds up to full dollar. Looks like to me, the servers gossips to everyone there. Most of the Japanese people I met or seen are extremely polite, however all the chefs at ramen kobo are not Japanese, not all servers are Japanese either. I've never had this kind of uncomfortable experience in my life. I wonder if any customers have watched their reactions, WOW.... I would feel embarrassed for them. All the other Japanese restaurants I go to, the service are always consistent and super friendly. I was surprised with these people. I will never ever go there again. BTW, one of their server's breath is so disgusting! When he's standing next to me, I could smell his breath! I read a three star review few comments below me, looks like this place's really got real shitty people, they are extremely rude. It's very uncommon in Japanese restaurants, it's jaw dropping for me. Very shitty place, most likely cheaper labor. What's your most expensive item? $10? LOL ramen kobo, you guys win on every level.",

Way bigger than monta which is great. Love how there's a section where u can see them make fresh noodles. I was skeptical about the broth and taste since I would compare it to monta which is by far the best ramen in town, but actually, ramen kobo is almost at their level. Broth was good. The spicy hot broth was super good, if u like spicy. We order the tonkotsu with nori and egg like usual. We also order the pork belly bowl to share and I was also skeptical because at monta, their pork belly bowl looks different and is super bomb but kobos bowl was good too. I think it needs a little more flavor or sauce to mix with the rice though to make it . Other than that, they were able to accommodate 7 of us and the wait wasn't bad at all unlike monta where u gotta wait for a while for a big group like that.",

The ramen here is made fresh daily so there's definitely a difference compared to packet ramen (duh). I also love how this location is so close to home compared to the other ramen places in Las Vegas.

The only reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars is because the place is very small and the seating pretty tight. Luckily we had no wait but I imagine at peak times there's going to be long waits. Also, 8.95 is not a bad price but after the add ons, it quickly doubles in price. I will definitely be back but those are the only 2 things I would change if I could.",

This place is located on Durango and warm springs infront of EOS, which is convenient because it is close to a big residential area. The shop is pretty small and I would assume on a busy night during the weekend there might be a wait. I came here pretty late on a week day, so I was seated immediately. I couldn't remember the server's name, but she was friendly and made sure we were okay throughout the entire experience. I ordered the Spicy shoyu ramen and my girlfriend got the tonkatsu ramen. The Spicy ramen had a nice kick to it and would surely get your nose running! The soup was good and I liked how the noodles were chewy. I got to try the tonkatsu ramen as well and I liked the soup base. It was thicker than the soup you get at sora, but it definitely had good flavor. Portions were good and we both left full! If you're in the area definitely try this place out.",

    "text": "First time there today. I've been waiting for a \"perfect\" weather to pair with ramen so I waited for our long summer to be over. First impression was nice, clean and modern as this is a new joint but the smell was off. The smell was overwhelmingly stale and oily. My culinary \"red-flag\" went up right away from that point. Lunch was fairly busy but luckily we sat at the bar right away. Before I sat tho, I went to the bathroom to wash my hands. Both men and women bathroom had signs that said the bathroom is closed for some work or something. WHAT?! This is a brand new place practically. But I saw that the women's bathroom was open and no one was nearby so I quickly washed my hands (of course, with door opened with my foot propping it open. Didn't want to \"scare\" any female patrons there you know!) Anyway, the hallway floor was sticky which is a good sign that they don't have a good sanitary protocols. C'mon, they just opened the door like 30 mins before we were there. It shouldn't be that way. As I sat at the bar, the dirty hoods caught my eyes. Once again, this place being as new as it is, the hoods shouldn't be that dirty with oil and filth. Another sign...lack of proper sanitation and maintenance protocols.   Next thing I noticed are the workers in the kitchen making the food doesn't seem to have much culinary training.I'm accustomed to and expect to see people behind the kitchen who knows about the food and have appreciation for the food they are making. I highly doubt any of the workers have any prior training in making ramen before they start working there. Their lack of professionalism and respect for the food they are making truly showed with the body language and filthy stuffs they were saying. Especially the heavy set guy was pretty vocal and non-stop talking fairly loud while making the noodle, I so wish he stopped talking to minimize spitting into the food. For that reason alone, I would not return to this place again since I felt the food isn't being made with proper sanitary standard.   Our ramen took little longer than expected but not too bad. I ordered a medium miso and I thought it was quite spicy. My staffs agreed as one ordered hot (she normally order 8-9/10 at Thai restaurants) and the other ordered a medium miso too. Taste wise, I'd give 3 stars. The noodle, which they boast about making in-house with their own machine is nothing more than a show. Can we say Krispy Kreme??? It really didn't deliver anything extra. Portion is on the smaller size so I ordered a side of white rice. Sorry I ordered \"white\" rice, not stale \"yellow\" rice. Another let down!  The waitress was poorly trained or just don't know how to serve properly. I'd accept \"unfriendly\" but this older lady was on the \"rude\" side!   Ramen is something I appreciate quite a bit. While being a rather simple dish, it's one of those things that's not only filling but emotionally \"hitting the spot\" type of food. Kobo is a prime example where a business person with no culinary training and no culinary appreciation for the food they deliver turns it into a \"factory\" to make money, not food! Their name is quite fitting...a FACTORY! Simply a place where they make things. No thanks kobo, I'll look for a place where they take pride in food they make, not just the $$$ they make!",

There are better options, in my opinion, like Ramen Sora, but it's really close to home when I don't feel like driving to Chinatown.  It's a little disappointing that they don't have gyoza as an option. I ate the tonkotsu ramen medium spicy. The first time I went it was almost too spicy to finish, but the other times was just enough spice. The broth has good flavor, not too light, but almost creamy. You have to add things that come already at other places, like the egg, and it only comes with one small piece of chashu pork. The noodles are made in house, and they are probably the best thing about this place. I don't recommend taking it Togo though, it doesn't hold up as well as you'd think.  Also, on the weekdays, they have a weird break in their hours where they are closed from 2:30-5.",

From the sound of it, this is owned by the same people as Monta and that's definitely a good thing.  Anyway, the service was great and everyone was very friendly. The menu, while small, is still good as they at least offer fried rice in place of more traditional appetizers. Usually ramen fills me up so I don't always go for appetizers anyway so its not a big deal to me. That said, I think it would be greatly appreciated if they expanded their menu a bit. Not going to knock it for lack of gyoza.  The food was great! I got the shoyu ramen as I like lighter ramen in the summer months and it really hits the spot. Very similar to Monta's style of ramen. And you can even see the noodle machine working. Freshly made noodles are always a good sign.  Not sure why so many people are complaining about the size of this place, its an average sized ramen shop, why would you bring a large party? All the decent shops in Chinatown are similar size as well.  I'm a fan and I'll definitely be coming back!",

    "text": "I have been a avid ramen-consumer around town and I love the old Monta (before the taste starting to change in recent years) and knew I had to try this place out.   The menu is pretty similar to Monta except for optional levels of spiciness, 1 piece of pork Chasu instead of 2 but we get ground pork as the other protein instead, comes with bean sprouts, and a higher price tag.   I went there the second day it opened and ordered my go-to ramen, the Tonkatsu Ramen, original level of spiciness, and I added an egg with an additional charge. The ramen turned out bland so I was disappointed and the egg was just like a tasteless hard-boiled egg. The soup base had pieces of the Tonkatsu oil-like ingredients floating around --- it looked it they did not boiled the broth enough for the ingredients to blend in.   However, I gave this place another try the week after. I ordered a Shoyu Ramen with no options added as well as the Kimchi Fried Rice. The Kimchi Fried Rice is just as good as the one in Monta and the Shoyo Ramen was delicious! I don't know if it's because they heard feedback from customers about the broth being too bland and fixed it or it's simply because it's a different ramen but it was very well done.   This is not the end of the review --- the third week, I did try the Miso Ramen and thought it didn't taste bland but it wasn't groundbreaking neither. I would go to this place just for the Shoyo Ramen and the fried rice.",

I've ordered this dish about 3-4 times now and let me tell you it was nothing short of amazing. I enjoyed it so much that I even had to get one to go to eat later. Keep in mind this was made by what I think is the owner? I ordered my regular today and I didn't recognize any of the staff. I regret coming here today. It was absolutely terrible. The first taste of the sauce reminded me of spicy charcoal. Complete garbage. I am not hard to please when it comes to food but the dish was so horrendous that I had to stop eating it. I told the server how bad the dish was and all he said was \"oh.. sorry..\" with a smile and walked away. I hate to say it but just based off of this experience, I may not come back here.",

Our wait time was based on my party needing a high chair. There was an open table when we got there so our 20 minute wait time was for nothing. My two year old doesn't eat ramen, so I brought him some macaroni, which the restaurant doesn't allow. I wasn't going to sit there and eat while my two year old watched us. I understand not being able to bring outside food in to their restaurant, but we were getting 5 meals plus drinks. You'd think they could make an exception for a two year old. Either way, we left and took our business elsewhere. The 2 stars were for the 20 minutes of my time that was completely wasted.",

This location has you choose your level of spiciness from original, to fire. It does not have the option to choose thin or thick noodles like the Spring Mountain location which is fine. They add ground beef, green onion, and a clove of garlic in their soups which the other locations do not do, I think it is a nice touch. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is due to the broth, it doesn't have as much flavor as their other locations, and there is fatty grease floating in it like the other reviewer said. I went twice since they opened first time I got the Miso ramen original, and the second time I got the Shoyu ramen mild. The shoyu ramen had a little more flavor then the miso and I think it was due to the spicy flavoring they use. I will be back and be a frequent customer. Server Ryan was very nice and introduced himself and was very welcoming, great service.",

The portions were good and the taste was there but the chili kinda too spicy for me but I still ate it. I will be  back again.",

Pretty pricy for just adding on type of topping. It came with chives & pork chashu already. There was barely any meat, but I personally like the broth. I can see why people think it's oily. It had some flavor, hence me sipping it out of my spoon more than chowing down the noodles. The in house noodles had a nice soft & perfectly cooked texture. Service was decent & the tight atmosphere made it all the more Japan-like feeling. Might be back!",

The place is simply decorated which is good when it's small. They can maybe fit about 25 people MAX!!  . The service is always fast & quick. This place is probably not like the most romantic place, more of like a quick meal & out. . -PORK BELLY BOWL $5.95 - it's simple & plain & I love it. Thin slices of PORK just cooked & topped onto a bowl of rice w/ salt & pepper & sesame oil. Topped off w/ scallions   -SHOYU SPICY RAMEN $8.95 - there has to be a bunch of MSG in this soup base because I freaken can't stop craving the damn soup! I'm not much of a ramen person since I prefer to just make ramen at home for convenience but the soup here I just love.  -MINI MENTAIKO BOWL $3.95 - I love MENTAIKO w/ some warm rice & a whole bunch of scallions w/ thinly sliced nor I. There's also some sesame oil on the side for you to add for yourself.  -KIMCHI FRIED RICE $3.95 - I would say this is like most mild kimchi fried rice I have had yet. . All in all I love the soup & the mini bowls... nothing super exciting but it's convenient for a quick bite when you just want something simple. Plus I work close by.",

He asked for a side of kimchi and although it would have cost extra he decided to get it, but it never came.  I opted for the tonkotsu ramen. The broth was pretty good. It had a good consistency. With all the other ramen places, I'd probably just opt for one with some better service.",

I love that the ramen noodle are made fresh. You can actually watch them make the noodles through a glass window towards the front door. The bowls are huge & under $10, unless you want extra toppings but the original bowls come with a lot in them. From original to hot, the flavors are exceptional & you have to order their pork chashu buns...to die for!   Definitely try this restaurant! You won't be disappointed.

We were lucky and got a seated right away, a few minutes later people were waiting in line.   We tried the kimchi fried rice with pork belly on top and this was delicious! The fried rice was better than the ramen.   I tried the Miso ramen spicy level mild and it had a nice kick to it. What I don't like is that it does not come with egg while places like Sora include egg with the ramen. The broth was ok, I have had better broth. Another thing I don't like is that our ramen came with 1 tiny piece of Chasu, they want to charge for egg and extra Chasu while other places give you decent portion of Chasu without having to order extra! They also don't have any appetizers like gyoza, you can only get ramen and fried rice.   The restaurant is small and tight, people bumped into me while I was seated at the bar area. The parking is also pretty small, cars were waiting in line and fighting for spots. I would not mind all this if the ramen was amazing but it was not. Will go elsewhere for ramen without all the hassle.   Definitely not good for large parties, parties larger than 4 are not recommended! If you want to check out the hype then go, but if you just want good ramen so somewhere else.",

    "text": "I would say I go into this southwest feeding ground about once (more like twice) a week. It's a small location, that usually takes awhile to be seated but is always worth the wait. Typically, there's no upside to sitting in a cramped corner, watching others get seated before you; but here they have set-up a large window to allow you to watch an adorable older woman hand make the noodles that go into every dish. They take, \"The way mom use to make it.\" seriously here, because mom is STILL making it and you can taste her love in every bowl.  This girl version of a bachelor, really enjoys her take-out food and this place tastes just as good when you're dining in as it does in a huge bowl being eaten on my couch. My only issue is time and time again we have a disconnect in ordering and some extra topping I added is typically missing. When I'm there they are really good about bringing it out to me quickly, but when I get home there is nothing sadder than adding all your fixings and you realize that your Nitamago (soft boiled egg) is missing. The eggs aren't the only things that are extra when you go there though... Yes, I am referring to myself as extra.  Extra (definition found on Urban Dictionary)  Doing the absolute damn most, for no reason.  My order in order: 1.) Broth -Miso Ramen (pork & chicken broth) 2.) Spicy Level -Medium, even though sometimes medium feels a bit more on the hot side 3.) Extra Toppings -Nitamago (soft boil egg), for something soft in texture -Bamboo Shoots, for something crunchy in texture -Spinach, for something green -Corn, because I love corn in everything -Butter, because carbs  The real secret to amazing ramen is you MUST add the Black Garlic Oil, because my ramen can never have too much sodium. I'd get it on the side though, so you can add to your liking.",

    "text": "(2.5 star) Came here on Wednesday at around 11:45 am, right after they opened. There were already about 10 people eating (wow!). I was exited to try their gravy like thick creamy Tonkotsu broth ramen. I ordered it mild. With extra chicken chashu(char siu), green onion and seaweed paper. When it came out, I saw red spicy oil floating in my soup. I specifically told the waitress I wanted it mild... so I told her I ordered it mild. She tells me \"Oh, we have spicy oil right next to our soup pot, so we usually put a little in. I can bring you plain broth on the side so you can put it in your bowl.\" WTH!! If I was sensitive to spicy, I would've sent it back. (Luckily I was a spicy food lover) Tip... If you are sensitive to spicy food, tell them you want it \"plain\" instead of \"mild\". Their mild is like spice level 3 out of 10.  Usually Tonkotsu ramen comes with straight al dente noodles in decent ramen shops but theirs come with freshly made non straight noodles. I could tell their noodles were very fresh. I enjoyed it.  Though the soup was a little spicy, it was tasty and flavorful. I was expecting the soup to be much thicker but they probably over diluted my soup with hot water.  For some reason, my chicken chachu was ice cold like they just took it out from the fridge. I don't know if it was supposed to be cold?? but would've been better if it was warm or hot.  Location is convenient right off 215 but if I want Tonkotsu ramen, I would go to Monta.  Will not come back.",

I used to love this place all due to their delicious pork chashu, which was creamy, full of flavor, and would fall apart at the attempt of picking it up with the chopsticks.   However, during my last 2 visits this month, the pork chashu was served cold, as if they just pulled it out of their fridge. The broth is hot and the meat is cold? (Wut?) Not only that, but it is now very tough and flavorless as well, almost to the point of needing other utensils to cut it.  I asked the servers what changed and they said nothing but I've been here enough to recognize the difference. I probably won't return.",

My husband and my 3 kids ordered shoyu original, tonkotchu hot, pork belly bowl, and fried rice. I was a little skeptical about this place because of the yelp review I read before we went. However,  surprisingly they were very tasty and not even fatty at all unlike the review said. The portion was good and the freshly made noodles were cooked just right. The broth had plenty of flavors and clean taste.  I thought they were as tasty or even better than the ramen I had in San Francisco Japan town. My kids loved the noodles and fried rice and asked me to come every day... :P",

The ramen in general was good. The broth was a bit salty and too rich for my liking. I would skip the butter next time. The chashu was soft. I wish they added more bamboo shoots and bean sprouts   I was with 6 other people and 3 orders were messed up. Hence the star I'm knocking off.  There's room for improvement but this place is still new.  Edit: I was typing this last night while we were waiting for our check and I'm knocking another star off because two of the waitresses kept asking my friend about his one can of coke. One waitress kept asking if it was just \"one coke\" on his receipt about 3 times, arguing with the waitress about it. We were all so confused and annourf because we were all talking and getting interrupted by the SAME question. It's like they didn't believe us about only getting one can of coke.   So 3 stars for decent ramen but if you can't even keep track of one can of coke, there's some more training to be done.",

    "text": "Came to Kobo on their opening day for dinner. The restaurant was clean, and nicely decorated. When you walk in, there is a glass room where you can see the homemade noodles being made. A plus!  My boyfriend and I ordered the same Tonkotsu ramen with egg and corn. One of the bowls came out with the wrong broth, but they were happy to fix the order quickly.   I would get a medium spice for next time (we could barely taste the mild). The broth was a little creamier than expected, but non the less delicious.  The restaurant was fairly busy with a 15-20 minute wait. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Would come again :)  Great job on your opening day.. And welcome to the neighborhood!!!",

    "text": "Came here for lunch for the first time on a Monday afternoon. Located in the new center next to subway near Starbucks and EOS fitness, this is the new location by the highly known Monta Ramen/Sushi Mon group on the Southwest side of Vegas !   We met up at 1230 and instantly got a table. The store itself is small, length wise, similar to Monta in seating capacity. Decor is nice and simple, with long wooden boards oriented vertically  lined up the wall for a nice high feeling. Different from the usual Monta decor. Also, they make their own ramen, in house, in the glass room, facing the exterior of the restaurant ! Mmm love fresh noodles ! I dont care if its pasta or la mien or ramen or udon. So good ! This is the main reason why i came to try this place !   Service was quick and friendly. We were asked our drink orders as soon as we sat down, by 2 different people, in a spread of like 10 seconds. Lol   We had waited for our late friend before we had ordered our food.   ----------------------------------------------------  Their menu is very simple. If anything, its identical to Monta's except with the choice of a spicy level.   1. Pick Your Broth - Shoyu Ramen (Chicken Broth), Tonkotsu Ramen (Pork Broth), Miso Ramen (Pork & Chicken Broth), and Vege Ramen (Vegetable Broth). All priced at $8.95.   Shoyu, Tonkotsu, and Miso Ramen comes with 1 slice of Chashu Pork, Fried Garlic, Kikurage Black mushrooms, Bamboo Shoots, Fresh Green Chives, Ground Pork, Sesame Oil, and Shredded Red Pepper.   Vege Ramen comes with Fried Onion, Shredded Green Onion, Tofu, Spinach, Corn, Ginger, and Fresh Green Chives.   2. Pick Your Spicy Level. Original, Mild, Medium, Hot, Fire.   3. Pick Your EXTRA Topping (Prices Vary) - Chashu pork/chicken, Ground pork/chicken, Spicy Fish Roe (Mentaiko), Kikurage Black Mushroom, Shredded Green Onion, Soft Boiled Egg (Nitamago), Mustard Green (Takana), Spinach, Kimchi, Bamboo Shoots, Nira Chive, Roasted Seaweed (Nori), Black Garlic Oil, Bean Sprouts (Moyashi), Corn, Butter, and EXTRA NOODLE.   Also the usual side dishes available. Fried Rice, Kimchi Fried Rice, Pork Belly Bowl, Chashu Bowl, and Mini Mentaiko Bowl.   ----------------------------------------------------  I had ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen, FIRE, with a soft boiled egg. Normally if this was for dinner or something, id probably get extra noodles too, but i just woke up maybe an hour or so prior to this, so my stomach is like meh xD haha can't eat that much.   Fairly quick to deliver the food, after the table next too us got theirs.   Noodles are unique to this location. If you had ever had Monta previously, its more towards thick than thin. But not too thick. So in between the two. Noodles cooked very well. Al dente. Perfect chewiness. Best part of the meal ! I want more ! but i was full. xD   Broth is flavorful but still pretty heavy, like the usual tonkotsu. FIRE spicy level adds a pretty good kick to it all.   Fried garlic is something new. Though its more like a roasted garlic vs a fried garlic. But i cant complain since i LOVE garlic. Had to throw in another spoonful of garlic anyway hehe :P   At Monta, you'd normally receive i believe 2-3 slices of chashu pork. But at Kobo, you get 1 slice of chashu pork, but in return, you get a small mound of ground pork. Not too bad. Their chashu pork seems pretty similar to their sister locations. Fatty xD Ground pork not overcooked and rough. Fairly decent.   Nitamago was cooked nicely. Maybe a little over a perfect soft boiled. Still has a nice golden, rich, and creamy yolk.   Aside from the normal toppings, the chives was a nice touch. I am a HUGE fan of chives and love anything with them.   Overall, not bad. Close convenient location for the people who live in the SW or a teasing/torture style for those who walk out of the EOS gym. Nice to have more options now in the area. Would be nice to pick up some food after work from the hospital if i work late.",

    "text": "Oh wow. I'm in tears and my face is red. I had the Miso Ramen with Fire heat, and they are not lying. I've been to many ramen joints all of town who claim that they have spicy noodles, some even offer you a scale. But the highest portion of the scale is never actually spicy. I don't even have the highest spice tolerance, but most places just don't it. The next time I come here, I'll probably just order it hot. Unless I'm hungover and miserable of course because fire at this place would be the perfect cure.  The noodles were pretty damn awesome. They make them in house, and you can even watch them make them in a machine that's windowed off at the front. Sadly, our set of noodles in our ramen were overlooked, but the batch of extra noodles were al dente and had a great spongy quality. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt on the original set. Hopefully, it was a fluke.  The broth was fantastic. Along with the aforementioned spice, it was packed with flavor and all around excellent.  My partner even had the vegetable broth, and I usually dislike those greatly. Jinya has been the only place in town with decent vegetable broth. However, this wasn't just decent. It was actually excellent. I would not mind eating it at all.  One small gripe, besides the first batch of over cooked noodles, the Asahi mugs are tiny. They're worth the price, but they just feel tiny like I'm not actually getting a full beer. The ounces might be there, but they seem and feel small.  Can't wait to come back.",

First, their ramen is mediocre at best, truthfully, the broth was very bland to me. Also the claim that they hand make their noodles is nice, but it definitely doesn't taste as good as places that don't hand make their noodles. I enjoyed their chashu fried rice and their service though. Ramen isn't really their strong suit in my opinion",

The miso broth is great! And I like how they have the option of how spicy you can make your ramen. The mild to medium is how I enjoy mine while my husband goes for the spicy. One thing I thought odd was that the egg was an additional topping. All the other ramen place I've gone to had it in their ramen naturally and this place will add an additional 1.50$. However since this is the cheapest place I can't complain too much.  Service is good and friendly and my water is never empty. Probably because it's such a small place.",

Ramen Kobo offers a few levels of spicy for those that love and dislike spicy food. Be warned though, I ordered medium and it was pretty spicy. Ramen at Kobo offers a nice experience because you get to see how the noodles are freshly made when you enter the restaurant. If you haven't had ramen, I would highly suggest trying out this place.   The location is small, so big parties be warned. Further, the whole party must be there in order to get seated. If you're looking for to-go they offer an easy way to order by yourself at the entrance, and are often very quick with getting your order completed.",

    "text": "Who would have thought this would be a neighbor  spot walking distance from my home. It's small & cozy and reminds me of a type of restaurant you would see in San Francisco. It offers an open kitchen layout and clean, contemporary feel with wood & metal material throughout. There is a small room upfront where the noodles are made. Unfortunately I have yet to experience this but hopefully one day soon.  Now onto the good stuff...the food! Reminder: I was never a True fan of ramen until I came here. I have now dined in twice and take out once. 2/3 times I have tried something different; the basic shoyu and today consisted of the miso. Their spice level has a little more kick than what you may be use to. I recommend sticking with mild and kicking it up yourself with the chili oil & powder they have. I am not a fan of the ground meat that is standard in the ramen. It's definitely a consistency thing but so much better without it. The noodles are indescribable and cooked al dente and have yet to experience anything other.   The only problem I have...they do not deliver nor on post mates or uber eats! But then again ramen should be enjoyed at the restaurant. It's not the same experience when at home.   For any newbies, give yourself some time. Typically there is a slight wait but turnover is quick. Don't get impatient. You will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "I'd be pressed to say that the ramen here is even better than ramen you eat in Japan. Seriously!  Ramen KoBo is by the same makers of Monta Ramen and you can really see the similarities from the dinky dining area to the limited but extremely well executed options on the menu. Fancy seeing the noodles made in person? The kitchen area is open alongside an end which is divided by glass and you can see the chefs and cooks spinning up flour with their hands to make the noodles.  I love this place for two reasons: first reason. EDM all day, everyday. And I'm not just talking about the generic big room stuff. No, this place was blasting oldies but goodies like Tritonal's Now or Never and new tunes (as of 12/7) like Illenium, Borgeous and more. Whoever decided to play edm, GOOD edm here, kudos to you.  Ok for my second reason, the menu items like I mentioned is limited but it is very good. I had the miso ramen with extra pork and an order of the boiled eggs. But one little thing that made a WORLD of a difference for me here...you can adjust the spiciness here. If you're a spicy food lover like me, this is a game changer. Seriously, I never knew miso ramen tasted this good when you make it spicy (going for the hottest one next time).  Not only that, but the broth is not so fattening and you can clearly see how smooth it is once you are nearly done with your bowl. When all your noodles and veggies and things have been eaten away, your broth will either have fat bubbles floating around or it'll be clear. All clear here.  I absolutely love this place and the best part is that it's literally three minutes away from my new office now. Win win win.",

The customer service here has been consistently great the three times that I have eaten here. It is a smaller restaurant so there usually is a wait; however, we have never waited more than fifteen minutes (each time has been a party of three).   There are five levels of spices: original, mild, medium, hot, and fire. I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to spices so medium was too hot for me the first time; however, mild has always been just right.   I don't eat red meat so it is always a struggle finding a ramen place that offers poultry or vegetable based broth; however, Ramen KoBo offers both! In addition, I like to add the extra topping of ground chicken with nori (roasted seaweed) with a seasoned egg.  Customer Service: 5/5 Environment: 5/5 Food: 5/5  Definitely a great place if you're craving ramen and don't feel the desire to drive out to Spring Mountain!",

The service was great and friendly, so let's cut right to the ramen. We had the tonkatsu and miso ramen plus a small rice bowl with salmon roe. Everything was delicious. The tonkatsu broth is on point! I added black garlic oil for an additional $1.00 which made the broth a lot more earthy and savory. It is an intense flavor so I wouldn't recommend for those who prefer a lighter broth. You can add extra toppings for additional cost to what they already provide. The noodles had a great texture. BEWARE the spice level - I asked for mild and it felt like medium to me - if unsure you should just ask for the hot sauce on the side.  The only suggestion I would make is to give one more slice of meat for the standard ramen bowl. One thin slice is a bit stingy. But the rest of the food is great and if you like noodles (and don't care too much about meat) you will enjoy this place.",

    "text": "Location: The place is located one block from Rhodes Ranch, in the same plaza with the EOS gym, right next to Cafe Rio. There are plenty of parking spaces in the back if you happen to come on a busy day.   Decor: the restaurant is on the smaller size side. They have about 8 tables and bar. If you are in a hurry and don't have to sit at a large table,'I'd recommend to sit at the bar since you will have a better chance to sit on a busy day. All around is Japanese style ramen like in Tokyo. It's an open cooking space where you can see how they prep your meal. This is one of a good thing, you know they will be clean when someone is watching, haha.  Simple artistic decor and oh, the bathroom is clean.   Menu/ ingredients: once you walked into the restaurant, there is a noodle maker machine on side. All of their noodles are handmade at the location. With the exception of Tsukeme style ramen (soup on the side) which what I usually order since I believe those are ready to cook ones. It's probably due to different process required when it comes to yellow noodle. Tsukemen is more chewy compared to regular ramen noodle. I also ordered their house fried rice, very tasty and has pork belly in it! Yummm. Must try!   Service: Their service is always good and fast. They always make sure the have enough employees to cover all tables. But I can see the space is a challenge especially when it's super busy and they are trying to bus table and then deliver soups in that small hallway.   Price: a little higher compared to Monta in Chinatown. Portion is bigger though. And only mushroom, bamboo shoot, 2 slices of pork and green onion are included. Everything else are extras.   RecommendAtion: Tsukemen is my favorite! Love hpw you can adjust your spicy level and add extra toppings. I would recommend to include some of the extras. Eggs should be included in the price since one bowl is already $9-10.   Overall, I am satisfied and will be back. If they include more extra items in the price, then I will be back more often.",

    "text": "Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied. I mean, it wasn't bad but it just wasn't what I remember.   But, what really stood out to me this time was something different... I'm not sure why I felt a little unsettled but the line cooks and servers were talking in Spanish and telling jokes. I speak fluent Spanish and they would not be saying the things they were out loud if people could hear them. I think most of the people there only speak English or Japanese so they might have assumed that no one else could understand but I've been a chef for 12 years and although my Spanish isn't perfect, I can usually get the jist of the conversation. The prep cooks in the back seemed to also understand because when they noticed me paying attention, they shook their head in disgust. Then, the main line cook (short, older woman) ran back to say something to them. At that moment, the jokes and laughing also ended so I'm assuming it was related. Even if it wasn't, it was unsettling to see as a customer. The prep cooks didn't seem to like what they were joking about but the short older woman didn't think anyone else would notice... I guess  Where I usually get a feeling of being content and satisfied after a hot bowl of Tonkotsu, I was left with an uneasy feeling so actually, I guess, it was not good. What is even worse is that I was now full from the meal. Which sucks because it was like I ate a bowl of rice but found out later it was actually maggots. It's already in your stomach so there isn't much you can do but throw it up. My stomach started turning after seeing and hearing the servers and front line cooks joking around like that.   Not only that but I find it very unprofessional to see the servers and cooks directly in front of customers telling jokes and snickering like that. It may be innocent but costumers don't know when they are speaking a foreign language and their body language during the jokes speak volumes from it. This is one thing that managers and owners would most likely be very upset with if they saw it going on. Jokes and personal things should not be shown to guests like that. It's just very unprofessional and this is the reason why. (Unless, it's something universally accepted,obviously) But, I felt like my stomach was turning after seeing that.   The food was good (even though it was plated very sloppy. Where the toppings are usually very precisely placed and neat, they were just thrown on top. Not exactly a reflection of the flavor but a reflection of the quality and attention put into the dish). So, it still gets 2 stars but if the flavor was anything less, it would be an easy 1 star.   I probably won't be back to let that happen though.",

I got seated really quick too even thought it was on a Friday night. Even though everything was great but the background music was really bothering me. The restaurant played Hardcore EDM which made me feel rushing to finish my food and leave. However, definitely a good place to try and you will like it.",

We got there around noon, and the restaurant was halfway full and getting fuller. I was starving so we ordered right away. The waitress took our order wrong and we ended up with an extra noodle which we gave back. I ordered a tonkotsu ramen extra spicy with a soft boiled egg, and we split a small fried rice.   The tonkotsu ramen was super tasty !!! The soft boiled egg was plain but it was nice and soft, I was hoping for an ajitsuke tamago egg. Ordering extra spicy was a good choice, it was pretty spicy and made my mouth tingle. The fried rice here is bomb!!!! It's super flavorful, next time I would order a large so I could have extra to go.  Food is decently priced as well, I would come here again if I was craving ramen.",

Compared to Monta Ramen off of spring mountain, this one has way more options to chose from. You have the option to make your broth spicy or not (I kept it the original) but the spicy one is good as well (from what my boyfriend told me). You can add multiple things in your ramen as well. I added the boiled egg and it was OK. I really didn't notice a difference. The ramen was still good! Very different from what I'm used to because the noodles are slightly thicker! The only thing is once our waitress dropped off our food she disappeared. Causing all of us to need refills with no one to be found. We had to wave someone down to get a refill, which is annoying. Other than that I will most likely be back to this ramen place !",

Out of all the spots that are close by this is the only place that has solid bowl of ramen.   They make their noodles fresh. I like thicker chewy noodles but theirs are not bad at all. I like how you can pick your spice level. I always get the miso ramen with egg at medium spice. Perfect for a cold day.   Also, their pork belly bowl is a must if you have the room. They have a small bowl that you can get. It's also another alternative to the the pork belly bowl you can get at monta. It's not the same but just as good.",

I normally like chives, but it was a little too much, since they weren't finely chopped. The Kim chi fried rice was amazing. The garlic oil would have been great with just a few drops, but was a bit heavy handed. Otherwise it was amazing. I typically like my food spicy and medium wasn't too bad, but I'd suggest going mild to really taste the other flavors. Also had chashu buns, which we were too hungry to wait to take a picture of.

I didn't care for the noodles, they didn't stand out for me. The broth was delicious. The pork chashu was too thin and not as flavorful as I like.  The service was good.

You build your own bowl - pick your broth, spicy level, and add any extras toppings if you want.   Had the shoyu ramen with medium spicy level and added the egg. Broth was light and flavorful but not spicy enough. Should've gotten hot spicy level. I think they might've mixed my bowl with my friend's, who had mild (but they were both the same red color).",

I also really like the pork belly with rice, which is just pork belly with salt, oil, and rice and it's so bad for my health but so so tasty.  The only downside is that I've had some inconsistency with my chashu. At times it's delicious and melty and fatty, and other times it's been a bit lacking whether in flavor or just feeling like it was pulled out of a refrigerator like 2 seconds ago.  Overall, a really tasty and reliable place.",

When I read that this was created by the Monta team, I expected the same delicious food and had high expectations. Unfortunately, this was absolutely nothing like Monta.  The restaurant is super tiny and I felt uncomfortable being very close to the table next to us. I ordered the original Shoyu Ramen without any extra toppings. It's cool that they make their own noodles, but honestly there was nothing special about it. They were too thick for my liking and would definitely prefer the noodles that are served at Monta. The Shoyu broth was disgusting! There was no flavor at all and I honestly felt like I was eating noodles in a bowl of plain hot water. The one piece of Chasu was 100% fat and most of the ground pork sank to the bottom of the bowl, making it hard to eat. Just Eww. I hate to say this, but I think a $0.25 instant ramen from the grocery store would have been better than this!! They also screwed up on the spice levels for others at our table. My husband ordered mild, but he said it was pretty spicy. Our friend ordered hot, but it turned out to be on the mild side.   I am giving two stars because the staff was attentive, refilled our drinks quickly and took empty plates away as needed. I understand that they are new and still getting their act together, but I will not be back. The drive to Chinatown is worth it for good tasting ramen!",

    "text": "Ramen KoBo (Translated to Ramen Factory) is a new ramen shop that recently opened in the Southwest of Vegas near Ikea. Ramen Kobo being owned by Mon Restaurant Group, I had expected a higher quality considering their other successful shops like Monta and Monzo.  Ramen Kobo is a small shop with mainly bar seating to overlook their open kitchen, then 5-6 tables along the wall. Servers were extremely attentive but there was one cook in particular who looked pissed off and didn't want to be there. I would look up and see him giving me an ice-cold glare and I had noticed he was eavesdropping to our conversation the entire time which I did not feel comfortable. My personal suggestion is to avoid their bar seating.   I got to try their tonkotsu ramen and veggie ramen. Both were subpar in my opinion. Ramen were on the al dente side.   Tonkotsu: Extremely light, flavorless broth. If you took a sip of their broth blindfolded, you might guess that their broth is hot water with salt. Chashu was just one paper-thin slice of fat with no meat on it. Bean sprouts were under-cooked and made me feel icky. 2/5  Veggie: Broth was still bland but better than tonkotsu. Two slices of fried tofu to substitute the chashu but these tofu will make you feel like you are biting into a dish washing sponge. I would still recommend veggie ramen over tonkotsu. 2.5/5  Overall a very disappointing experience. They just opened so I'm sure they are still working out their kinks but I don't see myself coming back here again.",

Had the miso ramen & a side of fried rice.    The Miso Ramen was OK.  It lacked depth in the flavor.  The house made noodles were the straight variety, so it wasn't able to pick up lots of the broth like a wavy noodle would.  Overall, was just OK.  Not as expected.  Was able to taste the Tonkatsu Ramen.  The broth had more depth, but didn't knock my socks off.  Just OK.  The fried rice lacked pizzazz. Was just content.  Another OK vote.  This location is very small.  Maybe 7 tables (2 to 4 people) and about 10 bar spaces.",

I really like that their ramen is made in house and cooked perfectly to a right biting texture. They recently added tsukemen ramen which i got to try and it was delicious. the soup base was flavorful and not too salty.  Their miso broth (pork and Chicken) for their standard ramen is also very tasty and that is what i usually get here and i would add corn to it. The service here is great and fast. I will for sure be back here whenever I am craving ramen.",

They make it onsite. They have a variety of other ingredients that you can add for extra $$$ which if you're eyes are bigger than your stomach you may just end up spending $15+ on a bowl- but really- even without the extras- it is write home about good! Staff is always so welcoming and on top of it! This place is tiny, so just know you may experience somewhat of a wait. No worries- watch them make Ramen. Well worth it!

    "text": "There's this plethora of happiness inside of me knowing that such a solid ramen shop is (somewhat) close to me. Well at least, closer than all the ones at Spring Mountain.   Here lies Ramen KoBo, sister to Monta Ramen, and a small, petite, homemade ramen noodle shop. As others have already mentioned, their noodles are always made in fresh batches, so you don't have to worry about that funky, stiff chewiness you get at some ramen places when you know they don't serve their ingredients fresh.   The ramen itself is solid. I personally like my miso with a lot of sodium, as it's already unhealthful in the first place. I think if that's what you are looking for, a heavy broth similar to that of Ramen Sora, then you will find that here. One thing in particular that I found unique was that they added ground pork to the ramen bowl. Never seen that before, but that's just me.   I do believe that the toppings are more on the overpriced side. Every topping is a dollar or more, and I'm used to seeing it and 75 cents or less. I'd also be much more pleased with my time here if they had a larger appetizer menu to choose from. I usually like to start off with some takoyaki or gyoza, and it was a shame to see that they didn't have either of the two. Although, I did like their kimchi fried rice; it was very flavorful in comparison to what I get sometimes at Monta.   I know that seating is very limited at this location. I'll be bold to suggest that seating should be even more limited. When you walk inside, you know that of course, the establishment is very small itself. However, it doesn't mean that one should cram as many tables inside as one possibly can. I would've enjoyed my meal much more, without having to hear every single word of the conversation next to me, and feeling as if the couples in my vicinity were breathing right beside my neck. I had to move to the bar area in order to feel relaxed once again.   Albeit this place has its downsides, the ramen itself, I feel, is a good enough reason to come back here, especially when I'm too lazy to drive all the way to Chinatown.",

You can also ask for whatever spicy level on the side so you can add it yourself. I always get mine with Tamago (egg) & sometimes butter",

The broth had an intense pork flavor that was rich and buttery. The freshly made noodles were perfectly cooked. The cha-siu pork was so tender it literally melted in my mouth! I have frequented a lot of ramen places in LA, OC and now Las Vegas and Ramen KoBo is easily one of my top ramen restaurants.   P.S. My fiance who is not a ramen fan at all ended up loving this place. It's just that good!",

This place has the best ramen and their noodles are sooooo good.  I would highly recommend getting the black garlic oil with any bowl of ramen you order.  Service was good but had to keep asking for refills of water.  Overall, great experience and I'll definitely be back",

    "text": "My family and I came here to eat for the first time and it was extremely crowded with little to no space inside, very small restaurant so I recommend not going during peak hours unless you have the patience to wait (dining in or to go). We decided to order to go and the process was really simple submitting the order on the iPad they have at the counter and took about 20 minutes for us to receive our food due to how busy they were. Everything was packaged very well.  Be careful with how hot you go. I warned my Grandma to get medium instead of hot just to be safe but she insisted and even though she really enjoyed it, it was a little too spicy for her. I was super excited to try this place because of the good reviews and with how crowded it was made me think I was going to love it. I ordered the shoyu (chicken) ramen and unfortunately wasn't thrilled at all. I didn't enjoy the flavor the only reason I think about giving it a second chance is because of how much my family enjoyed it.",

The food and service is fast so you don't have to wait long. I would say it's comparable to Monta Ramen and Jinya. Love that it's on the Southwest side of town and fairly close to my house.
