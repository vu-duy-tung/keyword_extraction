I had the BBQ Cheddar burger and it was terrific. The burger was full of flavor and seasoned to perfection.   The scenery and the service was very good. They have a huge selection of craft beer and even though I could care less about that, my buddy was very pleased with his choice.   For being in such a highly populated area we only had to wait for about ten minutes, which we were perfectly okay with.",

As a lifetime user of one, I can assure you that they have gone far beyond what I have seen in other establishments in regards to accessibility. Other restaurants should follow their example. I love the way the tables are adjustable to suit a person in a wheelchair. I don't know how many they have in each franchise but if they have one available they will do their best to make sure a person who is best served by sitting at this table does so.  The food is awesome and affordable, especially for the location. I look forward to going here again during my next LV trip in a few weeks. I am really only writing this review to mention that it is DEFINITELY wheelchair accessible, contrary to what the Yelp page says.",

    "text": "Yard House has always been one of those staple restaurants that's been around for years and have maintained a consistency with the food they serve.   This YH is located along the walkway at the Linq and has an express bar outside that allows you to order your alcoholic beverage and enjoy the night without having to be a patron inside the restaurant.   We showed up and was told that there was a 35 minute wait. We decided to walk to the bar in hopes to find an open stool.  We were wrong, it was jammed pack. Fortunately, our number was called before the given time and was lead into the bar/patio part.   It took a great while before we received any type of service. By the time our waiter served us, we had already picked out everything that we wanted. And once he came by, we placed our entire order. For starters, we chose the calamari and fries. Chris ordered the sear ahi tuna with brown rice and I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich with organic tomato soup.  The food took an even greater while. We were very annoyed and at that point, wanted to walk off the premise. It was obvious that the food runner was running to drop off meals to other tables as he was sweating quit a bit when he got to our table. YH is obviously lacking the correct number of staff to the amount of people that dines inside.   The annoying part is the appetizers were given simultaneously with our meal!! Really YH? You've been serving food for so long and for your staff to give us food like that is a complete let down. Especially for an established chain restaurant with standards. The food as usual, was good but we were not impressed with their calamari. Number one, it was cold. The breading was not crunchy and was coming off the calamari. This is an easily passable order. The fries were good and flavorful. Our meals were good and we enjoyed it.  But the food just wasn't as enjoyable as it usually does due to their lack of service, staff, and coordination. The fact that they served the meal and the appetizer at the same time, is a big no-no. The waiter did offered to \"keep it warm\" while we ate the appetizers but seeing how slow their service was, we decided against it.   YH is in a great spot and we hope they improve on their quality of service.",

This seemed like a good location for us to meet....  Parking is easy, if you park in the large lot near the High Roller. There was lots of seating, both in the bar and restaurant. We sat at the bar, which was crowded, but not packed (surprisingly crowded on a Wednesday).  The service was friendly and they (of course) had a lot of beers. I have never really been much of a fan of the selection at Yard House - it's always seemed like more quantity than quality, but it seems they've made some adjustments. There were some local beers available, and I was also able to try a few IPA's I'd never had before.  Prices are high, which is to be expected. I didn't even notice if they offer happy hour like other locations, and we didn't have any food, so I can't comment on that.....  Overall, a good experience and if I am in the area, I will stop by again!",

The concierge directed us there for a quality happy hour. I'm happy to say he was correct.   We ordered a round of beers and three appetizers: calamari, nachos, and margarita pizza. Nachos were definitely worth it. It was a huge portion with tons of toppings. This was enough food to call it dinner. We continued to enjoy the beer specials until 7 p.m. They have LOTS of beer on tap - TOO many choices! That's a good problem to have.   The waitress was exceedingly helpful and super upbeat/friendly. She gave us plenty of time to sit and enjoy without feeling rushed. We watched two football games during our visit. Essentially, we were table hogs.   Anyway, I'd definitely recommend this place for happy hour, sports viewing, or beer in general. It's pretty much a classy sports bar.",

My husband and I split the wedge salad, fried chicken with their homemade buttermilk biscuits with honey butter/strawberry jam.  I just have to say it was probably the best fried chicken I have ever had in my life. The coating and flavor was so dang good!!! It's makes Ng me drool just thinking about it.  My cousins had the ribs and the bourbon ham on buttermilk biscuits.  You could see the ribs were moist and easy to get off the bone, and the homemade BBQ sauce.  His friend Dean had the fried green tomatoes with a good cut of bacon on top, and omg they were so yummy!!!    I wanted the deviled eggs, but just couldn't order them as we had been eating so much these past few days.  No dessert for us either, but I would definitely try the peach cobbler next time.",

    "text": "The Yard House on the Linq promenade is an excellent happy hour gem! They have over 100 draft beers available on discount during happy hour Monday-Friday from 3-6pm. The happy hour appetizers are what brought me back a second time while on vacation in Las Vegas because most of the happy hour menu was nearly half off! We ordered a wide variety for the table to share including the margherita pizza, spicy chicken pizza, chicken lettuce wraps, and spinach and cheese dip with crispy pita bread. We loved each and every dish, especially the pizzas.   The restaurant is large and has a patio, but filled very quickly for happy hour. It would likely be helpful to call in advance for a table due to the high foot traffic of tourists in the area.   Our server was excellent. My friend couldn't bear the taste of the sour beer she ordered- she said it was like straight cough syrup. We notified the waitress and she kindly brought her a different type of beer and even comped the drink.   If you're in the area and looking for a fun atmosphere to hang with friends and enjoy quality food and drinks this is your place!",

The tuna roll came out first, but had the regular spicy tuna in it. Once I pointed it out to the bartender, he quickly whisked it away and had the kitchen fix it. After finishing that dish, I inquired about the salad (having seen that it was not on the printed ticket in front of me). He went to the kitchen to check on it, and came back to say it had been sitting in the window, so he was having them make a fresh one for me. When the chopped salad finally came out, it had romaine lettuce in it...which, if you've never had their chopped salad, is very out of place. It normally has no lettuce (and is spelled out on the menu without lettuce). When I asked the manager (who was apologetic about the tuna roll) about it he said they got so many people asking to add lettuce, that they decided to just add it to all the chopped salads, but it could be ordered without it. I told him that was a bad move, gat lettuce messed up the salad. Won't be going back to this location.",

    "text": "On a cold night, prior to seeing a show at the Brooklyn Bowl, my wife and I decided to pop into Yard House for some dinner.  Despite being pretty busy, we were able to get seated in a reasonable amount of time.  We got seated out on the patio area, with a heater lamp providing ample warmth.  The view was amazing.  Unfortunately, the patio hovers right above the sidewalk where everyone ducks outside to smoke.  So your meal has a tendency to be accompanied with a fair amount of second hand smoke as it all wafts up into an otherwise beautiful spot.  Yard House would be wise to ban smoking within 25 feet of their establishment.   The prices are also outrageous, of course, because it is on the strip.  The service was awful.  We saw our server briefly as she dropped off our menus and took our drink order.  And then she disappeared.  We didn't get our drinks or see the server for close to 15 minutes after that.  This was not looking good, especially because we were trying to catch a show shortly after dinner.  When she finally returned, we were able to put in our dinner order.  I was feeling adventurous, so I decided to go with the lamb burger, despite generally not liking lamb.  I would not truly understand the depth of my folly until much later in the evening.  The food itself tasted pretty good, at the moment I ate it.  The waitress continued to disappear, so by the time we were able to get our check and get out of there, we barely made it to the show, despite having left plenty of time.  It wasn't until a couple of hours later, when we arrived home, that my stomach began its revolt.  I had made it through nearly 3 decades of existence without getting food poisoning and I had been done in by a lamb burger.  As good as that burger tasted when I ate it, it didn't taste good at all when I vomited it up several times throughout the night.  The destruction of my body lasted nearly a full day and a half, with very little sleep and whole lot of bodily functions.  The paranoia it left me with, however, didn't quite leave me.  Moral of the story?  Go to the Tilted Kilt instead.  Or literally anywhere else at the LINQ.  Because Yard House's food prep, accompanied by their prices and service, makes for one unforgettably terrible experience.",

The items we ordered were \"RIB EYE & SHRIMP* (12oz) spinach-corn-mashed potatoes, grilled tomato, broccolini, house made steak sauce\" for $32.65 and \"PENNE WITH CHICKEN mushrooms, asparagus, sun-dried tomatoes, marsala cream sauce, parmesan\" for $11.95; all tasty. Stake was tender, shrimp were nicely done as well, and penne had creamy but not heavy sauce.  Was this food something we'll crave to come back for - no; but, it tasted good.",

    "text": "I've always been a fan of the Yard House, and was happy to see that one had opened up in the new Linq area in Vegas.  If you haven't been to one before, it's a great place to have a drink and watch a game.  As a bonus, they have really good food as well.  The staple of most Yard House restaurants seems to be a large bar in the center of the restaurant, with what appears to be a zillion beers on tap.    Most Yard House locations are huge, and this one is no exception.  My wife and I decided to come here on a weekday for lunch since she had some gift cards.  The restaurant wasn't too busy, but more and more people seemed to be coming in throughout our meal.  They have a big menu, so you shouldn't have any trouble finding something you want.  They have anything from a burger to a steak or nice piece of fish.  I ordered a BBQ Chicken Pizza, while my wife ordered a fancy version of mac-n-cheese.  We both agreed that our meals were very good, and that we would definitely come here again.  We received good service throughout our meal, despite our server taking a break and passing us to a different server for part of our meal.  I know there are a lot of choices when it comes to eating out in Vegas, but don't hesitate to give Yard House a shot if you're looking for a casual, more affordable meal.",

    "text": "As a Yard House apologist, I really love that they have this location in The LINQ Promenade as it saves me a trip to the retail and shopping development a couple miles down Las Vegas Blvd.  The inside is classic Yard House and a nice escape from the normal sights and sounds of the Las Vegas Strip.  There's even a patio that is totally glassed in right off the Promendade walkway to offer a different and quieter vibe.  Happy Hour at all Yard Houses are the way to go and I took advantage of a couple of appetizers after a long day of golf.  The selection, taste and portion size of their sliders on Happy Hour is always good, but their queso dip may have been some of the worst I've had anywhere.   Also, my service was lacking what I have come to expect from Yard House regardless of whether I'm in Las Vegas, Scottsdale, Chicago or Orlando. I turned down a beer when I was first greeted simply because I was really hungry and wanted to get in a food order, then was never asked again and felt kind of ignored.  And, for the first time at ANY Yard House, a manager never visited me the entire time.  That just gave me an excuse to walk over to the Brooklyn Bowl and have a beer there as their Happy Hour runs an extra hour until 7pm.  This is what I love about Vegas. If you don't get the service you want in one place, there's always another option almost literally a few feet away.",

    "text": "The last time the hubby and I were in Vegas we did the High Roller ride, and after we got done I noticed all of the new restaurants, shops, and Linq hotel down in this area. The Yard House particularly caught my eye and I said on our next visit this was a place that we would eat! Almost a year later, we were back and I was ready to give this place a try! We came to this location on a Saturday, after spending all day in the pool. We arrived around 3pm and there were very few people in here(guess we missed the lunch traffic). We were immediately greeted and taken to our table. For some reason we were seated with the waiter that was doing the most that day. One gentleman came by to get our drink order because our waiter was at another table. Finally, our waiter came and gave us the initial greeting. After he gave us time to look over the menu, another waitress came with our drinks. After a few more minutes our waiter finally returned to take our order. Let me tell you the menu here is EXTENSIVE! There is something here for everyone! They also have a full bar and over 100 different beers. My husband ordered a salad, I ordered a taco (I believe it was the Baja fish taco) and artichoke crab and lobster dip, and my brother ordered calamari and a burger with fries. The crab dip and calamari came out first---with a different waiter. Let me start with the artichoke dip-- how you do you say WONDERFUL!! This is some of the best artichoke, crab, and lobster dips I have ever had-- we finished this in minutes of it reaching the table. The calamari was pretty good the only issue was the restaurant fries pieces of lemon peels and mixed it in  with the fried calamari and I ate a lemon peel and wasn't happy with the tart taste. My taco was delicious! Everything on the taco was fresh and it was well put together. My brother's burger was massive. I didn't care to taste it but I took a piece of his yummy bacon from the burger and some of his fries. My husband opted to be healthy and eat a salad. His salad was actually pretty tasty along with one of the house dressings and chicken that was on it. I also ordered the House Tropic cocktail. It was ok, didn't find it to really peak my taste buds. At the end it was hard for us to find our waiter--they really over booked him--- so we tracked down another waiter and asked for our check. The price of food is decent in my opinion and the atmosphere in here makes you feel like you're in cool local bar and no longer in Vegas. Really enjoyed our meal here!",

    "text": "While I am not typically a fan of trying out commercial restaurants while visiting another city, this location of Yard House provided excellent service and food. We started off ordering a couple drinks. I told the waitress I was craving something grapefruit and she brought me a beer that was delicious but I am not exactly sure what it was called. My boyfriend ordered a sour beer that was excellent as well if that is your fancy.  We ordered the \"Poke Stack\" which is poke served with crispy wonton sheets with avocado on the side.  I ordered the Mac and Cheese Squared which comes with chicken, bacon, mushrooms, cheddar, Parmesan, and truffle oil. Do yourself a favor and order the small because even that portion is huge!  I mostly did this because there was no fridge for leftovers back at our room.  My boyfriend ordered the Maui Pineapple chicken with vegetable fried rice. I didn't manage to get a good picture of this but I loved the taste of this.  If you get a good seat at this restaurant then you can see the Linq High Roller Ferris wheel and the rail pass by.",

I was surprised this place wasn't busier considering the location. The only gripe I have is how the waiter went about telling the other person in my party her meal was comped, he actually didn't say anything. Only handed my self & another person in our party our checks & walked away. No thanks for coming nothing. She actually was wondering where her check was. Idk if he was upset she complained about her food or what but nonetheless a little courtesy would've been nice.",

    "text": "Just a few points about why this yard house is the best, from the 9 (my brothers, our sons and a son in-law to boot) of us who make our way from the Flamingo every time we pop into Vegas. The last paragraph is for all the guys who read these reviews.  First of all, this place is some what low key and pretty much draws the crowd who likes to drink a few really great brews (sorry gang, no 3' Eiffel Tower frozen slurppies here). The tap list is huge with over a hundred different beers of almost any style to choose. If by chance you would happen to be hungover (I'm not saying you would be but if) and not in the mood for a beer, you can get a fantastic bloody mary with a nice fat slab of candied bacon besides all the other garnish.  Then, the food. We've always had great food here! The menu is huge. The onion tower, cheese curds, queso dip for starters are all delicious! We've only eaten sandwiches and burgers here but have never had anything that wasn't delicious. Make sure you get the truffle fries as a side.  All of the bartenders and severs here are also friendly and know their beer. But, if you happen to get Chris, you've hit the jackpot! He's a great dude and he readily puts up with our crew of 9 and this has been for multiple trips! Always a pleasure Chris! Thanks from all of us.  Okay, lastly, and ladies you need to go no further unless you want to pass this to your significant other. The urinals in this place are the best!!! Let me explain. Firstly, there are like 8. The have high walls to keep the peepers at bay. You stand on a rubber mat! Who does that!? Then, inside the bowl itself, there is a mat, like a golf tee off mat. This is the genius part. There is no blow back!  No splashed knees, ankles, or shins! And, the whole time you're doing what you need to do, there is this minty fresh smell wafting through the air.Trust me guys. This will stick in your head if you stop!  So, if I could give this place an 6th star I would!",

It was a little tough to find because there's no big signs, but we found it and the hosts greeted us right away and sat us as soon as we walked in the door. We sat in Mauri's section and she was the best server ever! She's so attentive and knowledgeable about the entire menu! She raved about the brussels sprouts, which Im glad she did because they were the best! I will get them everytime I come now. We also tried the poke bowl, the gardien buffalo chicken, and margherita pizza. All were delicious and came out very quickly! Mauri totally made the experience that much better! Thanks again Mauri, we will be back for sure the next time we visit Vegas!",

Wine had to be returned, because it was so sour, but our waitress quickly replaced with a great one.  Everything was going great until dinner.  We ordered three salads, one with corn, two without, got two with one without. The BBQ Bacon Burger was overly greasy, but had a great flavour.  The french Dip tasted like canned meat, and it was cold.  When asked if they could heat it up, they delayed then said they would remake it.  when asking the manager, if it was real beef, you could tell by the look on his face he was unsure as to how to respond.  He stated it was prime cut, and would happily remake the sandwich; in which they did, but even the  remake wasn't edible. Should have gotten 3 steak sandwiches.  Overall just disappointing.",

My friend has already gotten her pizza about 30 minutes ago, but I haven't gotten anything. The manager walks to my table and says that they cooks made a mistake and accidentally made my nachos with sour cream so they it was going to take a bit longer because they had to start all over. BUT he was incredibly nice about it. He immediately told me my meal was covered, and offered me a little snack while I waited. It happens, we are all humans so it's fine. I finally get my nachos after a little while. Now, I will give anyone that has vegan options 5 stars, but these nachos were like heaven in my mouth.",

    "text": "We loved it. Late hours, cool vibe, HUGE menu, and great service. Oh yeah - fairly reasonable prices for LV and the Strip. Walked right in this Sunday night at 10pm. Had the summer salad as a starter; we both liked it. Our mains were the Sweet & Spicy Chicken Sandwich & the Ginger Crusted Salmon.    The sandwich was good, not great, avg size and with a little kick. Nice helping of fresh skinny fries. The star was the salmon. Nice ginger crust, topped with shaved sweet potato and shredded carrots all on a huge mound of mashed potatoes. The peanut vinagraitte rocked though. Ask for extra.  And a bonus: You can actually get a mixed drink for less than $18-20 on the strip!  Great food and value. We'll go back.",

    "text": "Seriously the worst restaurant experience I have ever had.  Came here with 3 friends: 2 omnivores, 1 gluten-free, and myself a vegan. I've been to yard house a few times before, never been hugely impressed with the food, but they have some vegan/vegetarian options without limiting the rest of the group.  So as we're ordering, I ask for the vegan burger with fries, to which our waiter, Adrian, replies that the fries are NOT vegan because they are fried in the same oil as the meat and other animal products... WHAT??? I was perplexed as was the rest of my group. Out of curiously, inquired about the vegan buffalo wings, and other vegetarian items on their menu that are fried. He informed me that they are not vegetarian either. I was really concerned about the fact that they list these items as \"vegetarian\" or name them \"vegan burger\" on their menu, but they actually aren't? Frying things in the same oil is unacceptable, people have allergies and dietary restrictions.  My options for a vegan side according to Adrian were steamed vegetables or veggie sticks. Lame. Disappointing. I got the steamed vegetables and they were literally cold in a pool of water, clearly frozen then microwaved, pretty nasty. My friend also ordered them and was equally disappointed. My vegan burger tasted pretty iffy.   I asked to speak with the manager and relayed all that had happened to him, and he was shocked that the waiter had said those things were not vegetarian, because they are. They have a designated fryer for the fries and other vegetarian items. HOWEVER, he said that sometimes the cooks are lazy and will get the fryers mixed up, so they do sometimes fry animal products in the vegetarian oil. Again... What??? Isn't it your responsibility as a manager to  MANAGE your cooks and teach them NOT to cross contaminate the oil? Unacceptable excuse, in my opinion. My whole group was frustrated for me, and I just felt so defeated and uncomfortable, after expecting a pleasant restaurant experience since they have \"vegan\" options, or so I thought.  AND to top it all off, guess who got food poisoning and was throwing up all night after their meal? THAT'S right, I did. The rest of my group also had stomach aches the rest of the evening.  Truly. Disgusted.  Don't go here. Lame excuses, terrible service, our food took forever, and I got sick from a \"vegan\" burger which is pretty hard to do, since there aren't any animal products to spoil.  I would give it zero stars if I could. I will never return to another yard house again after this experience.",

    "text": "This was my second time at a Yard House, and I guess I'm just not a fan. I just find the food completely underwhelming.   We started out with the grilled artichoke appetizer, and it was practically raw. It was nearly impossible to scrape the meat off the leaves, and even the heart was tough. This also came with chips and ranch dipping sauce. Kind of an odd combo now that I think of it.   For my meal I had the pastrami sandwich. It was okay, but I wouldn't go back to order it. The meat was a little tough, and the pickled jalapenos were pretty scarce. It was supposed to be served on a garlic bread, but the bread didn't taste garlicky at all. The fries were probably the best part of this meal. They were thinly cut, and perfectly crispy.   If this was purely based off the food, I'd give it 2 stars, but the beer menu boosts the rating for me. There's a crazy number of beers on tap, so there's really something for every taste! This is a nice location in the Linq, so if I'm in the area I'll probably stop by for a drink.",

Let's statt with we get put at a tiny 2-seat table against a window to the inside of the restaurant smack at the aisle leading in so everyone walking by us to leave and to arrive.  Couldn't even hear each other so either we didn't talk or we had to really talk loud just below a scream - music was so freaking loud!  So all there had to be loud too so whole patio yelling at each other.  Skip the blue cheese and the ranch salad dressings, they only taste like sour cream with no flavor.  The balsamic was good though.  Food...Had the Stack Carnitas Enchiladas and absolutely no flavor, bland & tasteless.  Wife had the Nashville Hot Chicken which was a small & flat pretty over cooked breaded chicken (the hot sauce with the ranch sauce was the only saving grace to it), hard to cut through sweet potatoe pancakes and that was it.  Server was great though and even commented on how loud it was as he was having a hard time taking our order.  So bad experience to say the least for $110 for 2 people with 2 side salads, 2 dinners & 2 beers.",

    "text": "There are two parts to this review. One for the restaurant and our meal itself and the other for our server.   We came here while walking the strip before our scheduled show. It's an awesome location by the high roller observer wheel and a pedestrian walkway that isn't too overly crowded. We were pleasantly surprised to go in and have it have tons of space and nice big booths. Our food was amazing. We all started with the add on ranch salad. Not only was the portion very generous the taste was amazing. We got the vodka shrimp pasta, California roll and orange chicken. Everything came out hot, delicious and again great portions. This was a definite hit and we walked out very happy with our choice.   Our server (Felipe) receives a 2 stars at most. He seemed nice at first meet. But once he explained the drink menu very excited only to have none of us order alcohol his mood quickly switched. As ladies who don't drink especially one of which being pregnant our excellent service shouldn't depend on if we do or do not order alcohol. From this point on we were minimally checked on, he would barely make eye connect and seemed in a rush to get to any other table but our own. The final scratch on our tally for him was when we tried to help by clearing our plates and placing them at the end of the table. He came to collect and rolled his eyes and gave us a good lesson on how \"servers don't appreciate stacking your plates because it looks like they aren't doing their job.\" Truthfully he wasn't doing his job to the best of his ability and we simply wanted more space on our table. But thanks for the lesson and not the refill on our drinks.",

We ordered a grilled artichoke, truffle fries, flatbread, egg rolls, and turkey burger sliders. The truffle fries were fabulous, and when they say shoestring fries, think baby shoelaces because that's how thin they are.  The turkey burger sliders were good, and the egg rolls never disappoint. The other two items however, yuck.  The grilled artichoke was not cooked long enough, so it was tough pulling leaves off. The flatbread was the dough itself, cheese, and some veggies. It was dry and tasteless...no sauce or anything on it. At least throw some garlic oil on it maybe? Our server called the manager over and he did handle the situation by taking the flatbread and artichoke off the bill.  Overall, I'd definitely come back here for their vast selection of beer, but sorry Yardhouse, your food has disappointed me one too many times.",

This restaurant is located at \"The Linq\" A chic, hip strip full of shops, eateries, and the \"High Roller\" the worlds largest \"observation Tower\" (Ferris wheel).   We have a Yard House in San Diego, but we've never been. We'll have to visit soon,  'cause this place was pretty good. Simple yet fancy menu items. I had the truffle cheeseburger. Simple burger on a plate with some fries and sliced pickles. It was really, really good!   Good happy hour menu. The wife recommends any beer cocktail, and she tried most of them! Not to mention the many beers they have on tap. I'm not a big drinker so I kept ordering 5oz. \"shorties\" of whatever beer I felt like trying. I tricked myself, it felt like I wasn't drinking as much, but after 2 or 5 of those, I was feel in REALLY good.   Service was good and the atmosphere was chill. We'll have to try the one back home in S.D. soon!",

On top of that, everything was fresh and crisp, and so goddamn refreshing!  Short review, but hell, I only had a house salad!  The customer service was fine, but a little slow. Waited about 15 minutes for the check, hence the 4 star.   I'll be coming back to the Yard House next time I'm in Vegas!",

    "text": "I had stopped going to the Yard House's across the valley after one particularly bad encounter with a rude waiter at the Red Rock location, but cruising the new Linq area (which my hermit ass had yet to explore) I gave this place another try. Mostly because it was the only place open and decent enough to eat at.  It wasn't very crowded, probably because it was later in the evening, so service was quick and attentive. My favorite thing about the Yard House is their extensive vegan/vegetarian section. Compared to most places that either leave you with just a house salad or some shitty microwaved Boca burger, the Yard House actually uses some tasty meat substitute and incorporates it into their existing dishes.   The selection is vast, anything from pizzas, orange chick'n, and penne pasta with chik'n. (chik'n as in not real chicken, not as in I can't spell mmk) This is one of the main reasons I even agreed to give this place another shot, most places don't give a shit about vegans/vegetarians/or anyone with food restrictions and it's one of the few places I've been to that have had a wide variety of vegetarian options without actually being a named vegetarian restaurant.   And what is a Las Vegas restaurant without a vast selection of beers to choose from? My favorite mix to get is the Black Velvet, because if you don't like Guinness you're wrong. But if you don't, worry not, there are many selections of dark, red, brown, pale, ciders, and other beers to choose from, as well as an extensive wine list, and of course, spirits for the super lonely.  Prices are relatively the same here as their other locations, reasonable but not exactly under the definition of cheap.  The service was great here, and I hope it's a trend at this location, I definately want to come back more often.",

The vampire tacos were life altering. You HAVE to tey these.  Dinner was much busier tham lunch, however we ate at bar and were super impressed with the way service was managed. Everyone on staff seemed to enjoy being there and each other- speaks.volume of the operation. Talked to manager who told us they had a location in Chicago, so hoping it is just as great. Seriously, vampire tacos and any beer you can dream of....definitely recommend.",

This is probably my favorite one out of all the ones in Vegas. I didn't have to wait at all for a table and the service was incredibly fast. I got the sliders and lobster crab artichoke dip from the appetizers and it was really good. The dip is amazing! I could just eat a huge bucket of it with my bare hands. If you come here, be sure to sit on the patio. It's the best spot to people watch and enjoy your beer with some great food!",

They don't take reservations but we were able to get seated right away upstairs. It was Monday, so maybe that's why.   They gave us two servers, who were both really nice.  The food at Yard House is always great, so no complaints there. They even let us bring our own cake and they brought it out for us. The only issue I had was that we bought a bunch of candles to put on the cake, and they brought it out with 3 candles.   They were also kind enough to split all our checks, but somehow there was a mistake at the end and they gave someone the wrong bill, but she paid it. We never figured out if the other girl paid her own bill as well, or paid hers. Either way, it wasn't a big deal especially since we had a large group.   We had a great view of the observation wheel from upstairs as well.",

He brought over his replacement and introduced her.  When he was back from break, she told us that he was back and would be taking care of us the rest of the time.  It was so incredibly thoughtful and smooth, when most restaurants just kind of throw someone new at you and you don't know what's going on.  I told the server that I had a nut allergy and the manager came over.  She double checked my order and said she would alert the kitchen staff so that they could take extra care in making our food to avoid contamination.  THAT is how you are supposed to deal with guests who have severe allergies.  it was so great.    Also, as everyone else has mentioned, they have a ton of drinks to chose from.  I, personally, was more taken with the feta cream cheese.  It was delicious and unlike anything I had ever eaten before.    I definitely recommend this place.  Great service and really good food.

There's an incredibly large selection of draft beers, which takes center stage in the restaurant with comfortable booth seating circling around the exterior. While the copious number of tap handles was impressive, the food wasn't anything special.   We ordered a few dishes from the House Favorites section of the menu, including the penne with chicken and the orange peel chicken. The pasta was smothered in a lukewarm mushroom cream sauce, lacking flavor or interest. The orange peel chicken was a better choice. Our server was friendly, but it took forever for us to get our food and later to get our check. The restaurant wasn't packed so I was surprised it took so long.  If you're a beer enthusiast, I'm sure you'd enjoy it, but I wouldn't go again just for the food.",

I have never eaten or drank anything horrible from Yard House at any location so this chain has my Yelp Love.  I have been to this Yard House located in The Linq Promenade many times sipping drinks at the bar. It has been my standard location if I am hovering around this part of the Strip. My reason is not for the beer as I know that is a main focus of the Yard House but for their delicious cocktails and full bar. Give me a yummy cocktail and I give you my heart. I also love the vibe and the mixologist who are always so attentive and super friendly.  My favorite cocktail here has to be the Black Orchid Martini. It is a fine concoction of Svedka Rasberery Vodka, Blue Curacao, watermelon pucker and cran juice. It looks as delicious as it tastes. The sexy dark blue liquid poured into a classic martini glass looks mighty pretty in a cocktail selfie, for those who do things like that. ;) It is a nice sweet cocktail that is pretty potent as well. Do it!  Unlike other Yard Houses, I have yet to sit down and eat. I will do that one day because I am so into their Miso Cod with Brown Rice... one day. Until then I will be saddled up at the Bar with a dark blue martini in my hand, followed by a Grey Goose and tonic whilst chatting with a friend or two. See you soon, Yard House!",

I was stoked to see that they have the new Angry Orchard Rose on tap so I went ahead and ordered myself two of those. Our server, Eric, was a lot of fun and took care of four grown women and five kiddos with ease. As a former server I know that this can be a daunting task and he was rad. We were a handful and he was a True gentleman. One small snag was lipstick on my water glass but he swapped it out for me quickly once I brought it to his attention.  Their happy hour menu really is legit. We pretty much ordered the entire menu. A few highlights for me were the sliders, because I'm sucker for a tiny burger, and the onion rings. I wasn't a fan of the poke nachos like the rest of my crew and the poke stack was overkill.  I would go back for the rose cider alone, in fact, I just might.",

Onion ring tower is always a good layer for the beer to try and penetrate. Jessica started as our server, seemed distracted, who knows? However, Frank was super nice and chatted about the college football games. The best location so far has been out at Red Rock Casino.   Location Rant Everything here is pricey; it's the strip. But the oddest thing about the place is that if you sit at the bar, they'll automatically ask for a credit card to start a tab. This is the only location that has asked this. Is it a sign of the patronage drinking and dashing at this location? There was no explanation. All we could get out of them was that it's company policy. They didn't do that in Rancho Mirage, Red Rock Casino, San Jose, or Tucson. Anyway, rant over.",

I have been to Yard House at various venues and they keep it consistent. I will say that it has never been a bad experience to be at Yard House. So if you are looking to have a good meal and a place to chill or watch a game, Yard House is a great option. In addition, I will say that this venue specifically gets busy because it is in Las Vegas. So do expect a little slower service. Overall, good place if you do not have to pay for expensive food. Also, come during happy hour. Definitely, reasonable and worth it.",

So we walked the \"street\" to the High Roller Ferris wheel.  The second visit was so another family member could eat.  Atmosphere - .Modern.  Basically a long bar to handle all their beer taps.  Then along the walls they had their booths.  They had a few high top tables.  Food   Drinks - Beer of course.  The beer menu is very large, but nothing special.  But the second time we sat near the bar.  I saw a TV that had beers listed.  I saw some that I did not see in the menu.  Instantly I knew I had to find out more about it.  I found out they have a \"chalk\" board list.  These beer are more of the seasonal beers and/or they only received one keg.  My third beer was off this menu.    Dinner -I had the pepper jack burger.  Yes there is pepper jack cheese but this is not what gives it the heat.  It was the poblano pepper sitting on top of that medium cooked burger.  They do ask you how you want it cooked.  That burger and beer hit the spot.  Service - Nailed it.  When I ordered my wife gluten free beer it set of a series of questions which included if she needed the gluten free menu and follow up questions to make sure things were handled correctly by the staff.  Substitutions in the meal were made.  Our waiter instilled a lot of confidence in skills.  Future - Yes as I went twice in the same night.",

It was my boyfriends first time at Yard House, but I have dined here before - just at a different location.   It was rather slow, and we were seated in a large booth right away. The host was very friendly. Our server came by after a few minutes and went over the beer list, which neither of us drink, so we just had water and a soda. It took awhile to place our order, but when we did we got the BBQ Bacon Cheddar Burger and the Roasted Turkey Club.   Food took a little while, and came out missing the side of dressing we ordered. Everything else came out correctly. The Turkey Club was a large portion, served with fries. I'm pretty sure they just cut up one slice of bacon and put one tiny crumble on each piece of the sandwich, there wasn't very much. My boyfriend said the burger was cooked great, but lacked in flavor. When our server finally came by to check on us, we asked for the dressing again, and it took about 5 minutes to get it, as she stopped and refilled drinks and brought bar drinks out to all of her other tables, before looking over and suddenly remembering she forgot our side. She never asked how the food was or offered if we needed anything else, but she was very consistent with all of her other tables - that happened to be having alcohol. I understand most people in Vegas are there to drink, but that doesn't mean you forget about your other paying customers as well.   Overall, it was just okay. We will probably not return and will go elsewhere on the strip for lunch.",

The music was audible but not overbearing like it's a nightclub or something. Service was prompt and the menu was pretty diverse. We had the crab cake and jambalaya. The crab cake was flaky and moist, plus the peach chutney took it to another level. The potatoes we tasty and the asparagus had some snap to it. All in all, we had a respectable dining experience and although I doubt we'll return, it's only because this is the type of restaurant you go to with some coworkers after work, not necessarily a place I'd choose when on vacation.",

They have TONS of awesome food starting from $5-$8. $1 off domestic pints & well drinks. $2,$3, & $4 off specialty drinks, martinis and premium spirits. They have two different happy hours from 3pm-6pm & 10pm - close.  I always have to order four of my favorite appetizers; Poki nachos, chicken lettuce wraps, crab cakes, & the margarita pizza!! If you don't want any of those items the options go on and on.  The only down fall or thing you need to be aware of is that this place gets EXTREMELY busy during the happy hour times, so if you're hungry come knowing that you will probably wait at least 15 mins to be seated.  A tip would be just come a bit before the happy hour begins so you can be seated and a little ahead of the crowd.",

Ordered poke nachos which were incredible but coulda been been a few more pieces of fish but concept and flavor was amazing (for a chain spot) This spot had a chill vibe for being on the strip definitely a place to grab lunch or a couple of mid-day drinks",

The onion rings looked like they came frozen from a supermarket. Really sad, not to mention we both threw up that night. Still love their selection of beer, really sad we will never eat here again.",

Tonight sealed the low rating that I was hesitant to give, hoping the quality would improve. It seems that as prices have increased (and they have substantially since opening 5 years ago), the quality of the food has diminished. I ordered a bowl of clam chowder tonight and at $8.95, I was hoping for something better than a thin, salty cream broth with a few potatoes and clams thrown in. This used to be one of my favorite items on the menu, but after tonight, I would not waste my money again.",

I highly recommend the crispy duck wings - they were so good that I ordered them both times I went. Other items on the menu that we tried included the fried calamari, the lobster, crab & artichoke dip, the blue crab cakes, the onion ring tower, the moo shu egg rolls and the coconut shrimp.   I did not really like the crab cakes, as the flavour of the crab was overpowered by other ingredients that I didn't enjoy. I found the coconut prawns to be too sweet and greasy, but the calamari was quite good - we actually had both types, the regular and the spicy (Kung Pao) version. Both were tasty, but I prefer the original one.   Service was good, and they have a huge beer selection. I would definitely return if I go back to Vegas. Their Bloody Mary was almost as good as a Caesar - it was spicy and served with a piece of bacon - yum!",

I was little disappointed that my Gin and Ginger didn't have a garnish (I have had it before in Phoenix), but my drink was delicious!  My brother ordered a vampire taco, which was one the more delectable things I have ever had there. I ordered the Mac+Cheese, always amazing. They have great burgers, my husband went simple and got the bacon cheeseburger. My brother got the truffle burger. He said it was super good.   Overall, I love the atmosphere there. It's casual, but still has a elegant feel to it.",

    "text": "Stumbled upon the YardHouse last week.  We were attempting to find a suitable (acceptable to all) dining place for a late-night meal, having not had dinner.   The food options are varied- there is something on the menu for everyone, and the beer/cider/wine listing is one of the most extensive I've seen. One can try two beverage samples before ordering. Most importantly, given the touristy nature of the area, prices are reasonable.  I chose a turkey burger with a tangerine wheat brew. One friend ordered a small pasta dish-  but their \"small\" portion is not all that small. In my humble opinion, the food here is better than at most casual dining chains.  Service was very good but I am deducting one star because we were not advised that sweet potato fries incur a $1 surcharge (we were only told that onion rings are $2 additional).  My friends stayed in Vegas longer than I and they returned to YardHouse for a seond meal. Would I return? Yes. Will I attempt to find a YardHouse when I visit other touristy areas (hello Orlando...)?...Absolutely.",

WE ordered drinks and had the chicken strips and fries as an app, delicious.    My boyfriend ordered the BBQ buger and I ordered the Cajun Chicken Penne pasta.  His burger came out cold and burnt, he ordered it med well.  My past came out....with NO pasta!  They took back both of our orders and when they returned, the burger was in no better shape and my pasta was disgusting.    I would be giving them a one star, but the manager comped our entire meal, it was such a mess!  Don't think I will be going back to Yardhouse anymore.",

The portion was extremely filling and delicious! It was also interesting that our food came out all at once. It wasn't that one person got their food first and we had to wait for the others. I thought this was great because we could all sit and enjoy our food at the same time. For dessert I had the mango sorbet which was so creamy and light all at once.

The Brussel sprouts were crispy on the outside and perfect inside. We also had the garlic noodles with asparagus, muchrooms, and tufu. It was just the right pre race meal. I've been to this place a few times and never tried the snack meals or appetizers. They were big servings and no main dish needed.

The server was very nice and sweet. I ordered a side salad which was very good. It was big and could be shared. My friend ordered clam chowder and said it was excellent. I ordered a ham and pineapple pizza. It was very good. I love brick oven pizza. I was a little disappointed at the fact it was my birthday and they didn't give me as much as a cookie. The view from you table is awesome. You are right under the High Roller. I would recommend this restaurant. Just don't expect anything for your birthday.",

    "text": "Darden employees have done it once again! They never fail me in showing excellent service with their customer loyalty that Darden dearly values. The customer and employee relationship that starts, as soon as you are seated, is absolutely phenomenal! This Yardhouse at the LINQ is a must visit! The unique parts of this restaurant are the floating kegs on the second floor, Most but not all employees in here is your friend and EAGER to make your first and every experience the best you've ever had. I never feel hesitant to speak to an employee for specific concerns or needs in food on the menu. Whether it is having an allergy to an ingredient or just simply not liking a particular part of the food you want to order. These employees are very willing to make you a happy customer by always going out of their way to accommodate you!  One advice I can leave you with is, be patient with this location for another year because they are fairly new, if some employees don't give superb customer service, the right information, or don't know every question, you could let a restaurant manager know to train them better. Communication is what makes the world go round! It solves many issues or concerns. I would love mention specific employees who give BEYOND excellent service each time, Martin, Jason, Ryan, and Sky.",

Large portions so just the starter portion of the salad was great! Definitely recommend the truffle fries, but I'm not sure it's real truffle oil- possibly just fake flavoring.

The ceviche had almost no shrimp, the  tinga taco was not good, and the pork belly taco was flavorless. We also had a Gorgonzola and pear flatbread ... Again flavorless. Not sure how that happens with something having Gorgonzola. Bottom line, there are much better places for overly prices tourist food!",

On the way he let us know about their very special location. For instance The Linq location is the largest Yard House location in the company! AND the only 2 story location. I've been to a few different Yard Houses and always marvel at the room next to the entrance FULL of beautiful kegs. Well this location does it waaaaay better. The kegs are above the bar! The layout is simply beautiful!   After we were seated our AMAZING server James came and said hi. We knew we wanted to try some beer but had no idea which kind. We told him we needed more time. After he left we needed to get the kiddos situated(I have a very energetic 2 year old) and when he came back we still weren't ready(our fault!) he was SUPER patient. We decided on a watermelon beer and a tangerine beer(this ones better.) we stared with shrimp ceviche and shrimp lettuce wraps and both were tasty. I love the sauces with the lettuce wraps!! For the main courses hubby had the surf and turf burger while I had my go to Mac n cheese, large so I could have leftovers lol. I never had seen their kids menu and it's pretty impressive lots of mains, lots of sides, comes with a drink and choice of dessert. Choices! My kids shared the pizza with edamame as the side and fresh fruit for dessert. Everything put on our table was fantastic   Now back to the service. As a yelper in the food service industry I tend to nit pick over service. I never make a fuss to anyone save my husband.  And presumably we eat out....too much. Service is rarely great, let alone damn near flawless. So when I enter a chain restaurant I don't have high expectations. James was PHENOMENAL he was kind, attentive, patient, and conversed the perfect amount and at the perfect times. I will always ask for him and I recommend you do the same!!!",

I frequent the Chino Hills location when visiting my sister, and the Marina del Rey location is a recent favorite due to their proximity to my job. On my recent trip to Las Vegas, I got to check out this location, which is in the new Linq complex on the strip. I didn't get to eat at this location, but we visited the walk-up bar our first night in town (7/1/14) to try what has become my favorite Vegas drink: FROZEN. MOSCOW. MULE. I don't usually go for frozen drinks and was going to order mine on the rocks, but watched the bartender make one for the folks ahead of us in line. It looked so good and it was about 100 degrees at 10 pm so I decided to go for it. Oh my....the best $10.50 plus tip I spent in Vegas! So good that my sister and I returned to the Linq our second night in town (7/2/14) specifically for this drink! I wish I could remember the names of the bartenders because they were both awesome - there was a male bartender 7/1 and a female bartender 7/2.   This was a short trip, if we didn't return home yesterday we would have returned for a third night. It was THAT good, and I'm not even a big drinker.",

My friend said the Mac and cheese was only alright- nothing spectacular. But the rest of the food was very delicious! All of the staff were super friendly, welcoming, attentive, and accommodating.

We each got a sandwich, they forgot the avocado on my coworkers sandwich, and the cheese on mine.  She got a little cup of avocado when she asked, but I just did without the cheese for time sake.  The food is very good, and the french fries that come with the sandwiches are awesome! They are skinny little shoe string french fries that almost have a texture of batter dipped fries...I don't know but they were very good.  The turkey on my  sandwich was difficult to eat in sandwich form, but had great flavor(thick cut, and then warmed up on the grill top I think based on the marks on it). They gave me a soda in a  to go cup when asked since we rushed through eating.    My main complaint is just that it took so long for our food to come out. We ordered what we thought was quick food because we knew we were on a short time constraint. It was pretty empty inside so we thought that would help also, but it didn't.  I would  eat here again, but when I have more than an hour.",

They have quite a few discount food items and drink specials but, I was just here to partake in some food.  I took a seat at the bar and was quickly greeted by a bartender.  The menu is huge in addition to the happy hour deals.  Another bartender came up to take my order and I ordered calamari, egg rolls and the shitake mushroom garlic noodles.  The bartender looked at me and said you do know that they are full size orders for happy hour?  I said yes I do, um I like food and we both laughed.  Some nice tourists from Utah sat next to me and we had some great conversation before my food arrived.  The shitake mushroom garlic noodles were my favorite part of the order.  They were light with a hearty full flavor sauce that stuck to the noodles well.  This was probably enough to fill me up in hindsight.  The calamari was a 4 star dish but, the egg rolls were just ok in my book.  This is one of the better happy hours on the strip for pricing vs. food quality.  The bartenders were spot on with their service and I would definitely stop back by the next time I am in town.",

I had ordered a salad and not gonna lie it did take a little longer than usual to come out but I didn't say anything yet she still noticed the error and took care of it immediately no questions asked. She was super attentive, knowledgeable  and hustled the whole bar it seemed! When we come back we will definitely ask for Brandi and suggest anyone ask for her as well. Took a mediocre experience to a five star level. Thanks again!",

I did notice that they had a Brooklyn bowl nearby and was tempted being that the original is from where we are from. Too tired though. So we walked in say 9ish pm and were promptly seated. I am a tapas or pintxos kind of guy being half spanish so small is more. We decided on the poke nachos and the traditional korean wings. I was infatuated with those wings! Maybe it was the fact that I was super hungry but i stand by this review. I am not a fan of franchise restaurants but I loved my experience here. The waiters were on point and friendly. Good atmosphere and ambiance. We also took a black truffle burger back to the room for breakfast in the morning lol!",

For meals, we ordered a BBQ chicken salad and an Ahi Tuna Sandwich.  They have two size portions for the salads. I thought the smaller size was the perfect amount of food. It wasn't overly dresses either which is hard to find. The Ahi tuna sandwich was pretty dang good. The tuna was thick and well prepared. It came with fries which were soooo good. And they came out HOT! which is something so simple but something that rarely happens which dining out.   I also thought the menu items were fairly priced. The interior of the restaurant was also pleasing as it is very open and still lets you see the hustle and bustle on the strip. Recommend!",

The guacamole we had to send back as it was brown and not tasty. The second one we got was fresh but still bland, we had to add lots of salt and pepper to get some flavor.

We were seated after a few minutes cause we came a little early in the day when they just opened, but WOW. Service was consistently great. Food was great. We got all sorts of food. Pizza, Tacos, Nachos, Chicken, Burgers, etc. we shared almost everything so I couldn't tell you specifically what IS good but I don't think you'd be disappointed! Our dining experience was 5/5! We all left full of good food and happy smiles.

The happy hour here is a 10. By far one of the better happy hours on the strip. Not to mention they have the largest selection of cocktails and beers.I recommend coming here any time and they're open until 1 am. Will definitely be dining here again.",

    "text": "Great restaurant in the awesome LINQ Promenade. Dark comfortable atmosphere, great service, great food - by far the best restaurant in the area (skips the overrated casino restaurants!)   Very extensive menu - something for everyone here including vegan/vegetarians - they have a whole section (12 items!) of Gardein entrees. Prices are in the reasonable range for being so close to the strip. Also have a huge selection for the craft beer drinkers too.  Started with a Classic Ranch salad, BF had the mixed greens - both were lovely side salads. Ordered a Margherita pizza - it was very large (I thought it was going to be an individual flatbread style - nope, it's a medium size traditional pizza - excellent too). BF ordered the Cuban Roast Pork Dip and it was phenomenal - the mystical mojo dip had us wowed ;)   Definitely would revisit in LV and checking their website for locations near me!",

The music playlist was the best, not to mention is was audio and video. The food was well done as well. I am not the biggest fan of Air Conditioned restaurants, because you have a time limit to eat your food before it is cold. But i still enjoyed every single bite. The drinks are well made, and well made drinks don't come with loads of alcohol, definitely not the place to drink in Vegas, unless you want beer.

The place is much bigger than it looks from the outside and we were seated right away. With a large menu selection we ordered a few appetizers to share to so we can taste a few items.  -Poke Stack  marinated raw ahi, crispy wontons, avocado, wasabi soy sauce. I nice lite dish but very flavorful. I wanted to order a second one, maybe a return trip instead - Lobster, Crab and artichoke dip. Served with pita slices and chips. Another decent option. Too much bread and chips, wish the portion of dip was larger. -French Onion Soup. Suprisingly good. Most places that offer this soup have it swimming in salt or overloaded with onions, This was seasoned perfectly and kept the onions minimal per our request.",

    "text": "Las Vegas Yard House: Great idea, poor execution We sought out Yardhouse by their reputation for loads of beer choices and sports on TV.  Our waitress was great, but she was working with a flawed system.  Literally 50% + of the beers we asked to taste from the menu were unavailable:(  As a work-around my wife walked to the bar to taste then\"available\" beers, but alas she was never waited on in her 10 minutes at the bar.  We persisted... We successfully ate appetizers and watched the TV basketball game of our choice on the closest TV, and drank the beer that was available.    Overall great wait staff, poor mgmt and design of printing the beer menu.  One solution would be to adopt a set of chalkboards or beer screens behind the bar to show customers what beer is grueling available at any time, and avoid the False hopes of asking for some great beer only to be told it was out... a second time... a third time... a fourth time... and so on... and sooo on.. and so on.",

We've seen this place in another city, so figured it was just a gimmicky chain and really didn't expect much.  The hef beer we ordered was good and what we'd expect from a standard pub, but the apps were exceptional.    We ordered lettuce wraps and deep fried mac n cheese.  The presentation of both was deceiving.  Lettuce wraps came only with meat, lettuce, wontons and 3 sauces, but the flavor combined with succulent chicken and butter lettuce left us wanting more.   The fried mac n cheese looked liked mozzarella cheeses sticks, but we were equally surprised at the fine taste, especially with the gourmet porcini mushroom sauce.  Our only regret is that we ate dinner earlier in the evening and probably missed out on some amazing entrees.  We bookmarked this place and plan to come back on our next visit.",

    "text": "Las Vegas, man. Every now and then, a guy has to go hang out in one of these mafia money warehouses and roll the bones a few times. Vegas has changed a bit over the decades. Where it used to be that a guy went there for unspeakable indulgences, now he might take a family. Whatever. The deal is that, today, Las Vegas doesn't just jack your billfold at the ol' one-armed bandit, they take a chunk outta your backside with everything, everywhere.   But, I ain't here to disrespect ol' Sin City. I'm just here to throw out a hint for some of the folk who want to get a little more bang for the buck. Listen. We all know The Lord threw the yoke on us and tasked us to plow the dirt outside the garden gates, right? When we earn a dollar, it takes a lot more than a dollar's effort. That's why you gotta be smart when you got a handful of lettuce.   I know what your thinkin'... If a guy has money issues, why ever visit Vegas? Well, sometimes a guy is asked to do some work that puts him in expensive places. What can I tell you? Simmer down and keep reading.  This is where the Yard House, just off the Strip, can help your wallet out. Yard House is one of those chain restaurants. It's owned by the same dudes that own Olive Garden. But, hey! This ain't no Olive Garden. I won't even review an Olive Garden.   Yard House Vegas is a pretty nice joint. It is a nice, big dining room with air conditioning, full bar, and decent food. One big detail about Yard House is that they typically have very good service. In fact, I have never had anything other than excellent attention at YH. Yard House Vegas has standard menu pricing, so it is about the same here as it is in any other town. That's a welcome relief from the casino concourse restaurants that hand you a wallet whoopin' like 30 minutes at the Texas Hold 'Em.   Just look for the High Roller, the giant Ferris wheel on the strip. The Yard House is in the shadow.    And, listen. I just saved you one Andrew Jackson, here. Be cool with the wait staff. Imagine the freak show they gotta deal with every day. I can assure you they ain't livin' the dream out there in the desert. Make it worth their while. Slide your spinach over to the sure bet, and help another human being out. Maybe your dollar will let 'em win big and get that ticket out of Sin City and into God's Country. Be a saint!  \"Vegas is the most extreme and allegorical of American settlements, bizarre and beautiful in its venality and in its devotion to immediate gratification.\"     - Joan Didion",

The bathrooms are located at the front and the hostess pointed them out when we passed them on our way to our table, which I thought was nice. Everyone seemed very well trained there.  Our waiter was friendly and quick and even let us know that he was going on a break and introduced us to another waitress who would take care of us on his break. Overall, it was the most professional experience I've ever had at a restaurant.   The food was great, as always! My s/o said the burger was incredible. Its nice that they ask you how you'd like it cooked, and then use a toothpick labelled with how it was cooked.  My \"vampire quesadilla\" was amazing!! I definitely recommend it.",

I came with a party of 14, which they seated on a booth area. Pretty good that they were able to accommodate us all, with only a 30 minute wait on a Friday night.   The service was super slow though. Every step of the process - ordering, getting our food, getting the checks, took ages. I ordered the Korean Short Rib Kalbi street tacos and heavily regretted my decision.   For $15+, you get two quite pitiful and tiny tacos. Literally so small - they fit easily in the palm of my hand. And the filling...to call it Korean Short Rib Kalbi is a bald faced lie. This was some random cut of beef, stir fried to oblivion, and drizzled with some strange sweet sauce. It was dry and crispy in a bad way. To add insult to injury, there's like two small morsels of beef to each taco, which can be eaten in 2-3 bites. The tortilla came cold and brittle. They try to supplement the meal with a small cup of beans (which were fine) and rice (which was cold), but I was actually starving after this. I ate off my friend's plates, who ordered much better dishes (like the Lobster Garlic Pasta or the Shrimp Scampi).",

Our waiter was attentive, the food was good, but our beers we're a little sad and took awhile to get (we only ordered 3 beers).   The reason why I am giving 1 star is because of what I noticed about the front desk staff. Before leaving I went to use the ladies room and there was a distinct smell coming from the one of the stalls. I was washing my hands, and the tall blonde hostess that greeted us came out reeking of weed, and stuffing her pen in her pocket. Now I know that cannabis is legalized here in Las Vegas, but seriously while you're working, and in the guest bathroom??? Go outside or use the employee bathroom.    We went there with our family, and imagine if my 8 year old niece had to use the bathroom and encountered this. I get that it was late, and maybe she needed to get through her shift, but be a little professional. I don't know what Yard House employee policies and procedures are, but they need to get it together.",

Staff was very friendly and seated us within 5 minutes of arrival without reservations.   Food (ahi tuna and sashimi plate) was delicious and my guest ordered a beer (purple haze) which she seem to really enjoy.   Our server was friendly and came by every few minutes to see if we needed anything else.   All in all I highly recommend this restaurant if you're staying at the Linq.",

The calamari was pretty good, but the poke nachos were amazing. As our entrees we got the [Mac + Cheese]^2 along with the vampire taco and the blackened white fish taco. The mac and cheese was very disappointing. The tacos on the other hand were very good.   Everyone else loved their meals. I was impressed overall by this restaurant and would come back again.",

They have the same midday happy hour as the one at Town Square but do not have the late night Mon-Fri one which was a shock and a bummer when I was there the other night.   I like their outside bar but the prices seem a bit higher than the inside prices.  I could be completely wrong, it just seems pricier to me.  I love the convenience though and the bartender the other night in particular was quite a joy and very accommodating.",

Located right on the strip in the Linq shoppes heading toward the highroller, we stumbled into the Yard House curious to see the menu.   Wow. The bar area is huge with plenty of seating as well as plenty of high top tables. We chose to sit at the bar. It took us a little while to figure out what to get because the choices were beyond overwhelming- but this is not a complaint! Everything on this menu looked incredible. We finally decided on poke nachos, california roll (which is like a california roll style tartare rather than a sushi roll), spinach cheese dip and fried mac and cheese. We also ordered a margherita pizza which we took to go for our midnight snack!   Everything was out of this world, but the fried mac and cheese. AMAZING! I could have ate here every single day that we were in Las Vegas. I also ordered a pineapple cocktail which was delicious as well! If you are in LV- this happy hour is an absolute must!!! Really great service as well. I highly recommend and this was by far the best happy hour we had attended out of our 7 days in town.",

Temperature was super. Drink orders placed and our waiter Derek was trying hard despite probably oversubscribed on tables to attend to. Service was slowish; but we weren't in a hurry. Lemon drop came without the requested and standard sugar rim for my wife, but Derek took the drink back to make it right. They don't remake the drink. They just pour it into a rimmed glass. Second round- same mistake. But this time \"Tiffany\", a waitress with serious attitude and a mouth on her turns the day downward. Smart mouth, bad training. I left the table to talk to the manager (Beau) and simply request Tiffany serve others and not rain on our parade. Get this- the manager sends her AND her attitude back with the second failed drink; because that's \"her job.\"   Long story short. Beau and Tiffany need retraining. It's all about choices. We went two doors down and continued our celebration.  FYI- one of our guests oversees casino experience and says she'll never recommend this Yard House, ever.  Bottom line - this Yard House came up two and a half feet short of a yard. Pass!",

I haven't been to this location yet and if I had to based it off my conversation with the manager, it doesn't sound like I'll have the pleasure to visit. I called today to make reservations for my party of 20 for September 1st at 1700 (5pm). I was politely told that YHL could not make reservations past 12N for that holiday Friday, and that they may not even be able to accommodate us at all. The manager did mention if it was a chance they had the space the day of we probably wouldn't be seated together. I explained that we're celebrating our birthdays together and scattered seating wouldn't work to well. I offered to pay a deposit and was denied, bc YHL doesn't accept deposits. I know minus 20 people won't have any impact on your business that Friday. This was just the only restaurant we all could agree to. Great food!! People come and celebrate with large groups/parties in Vegas all the time at all times of the year right? Should patrons of large parties on high traffic times of the year not even consider Yard House LINQ for dinner?",

I had the house IPA, which I really liked, and my parents had a watermelon beer and a tangerine beer, both unusual but good. For dinner, I had carnitas street tacos and my dad had the Baja fish tacos. We both liked the tacos a lot, but I didn't care for the rice on the side. It tasted like overly spicy Rice A Roni. However, my dad liked his. My mom got the lamb burger. She really liked it and said it was one of the best burgers ever. I really like lamb burgers but didn't try it due to the feta.  For sure I will go back again, to any of their locations. I always have a good time and leave generally happy with the food and service.

It's like the menu at a NYC diner, only with some class (and fresh((er)) food). There's a sweet patio, a 2nd floor and even a take-out drink spot, in case the shite beers at O'Sheas aren't your cup of tea. With big TV's around and a HUGE center bar, it's a comfy spot to hang and watch a game. Two thumbs up from this guy for YH!",

I don't eat a lot of meat, but I really wanted a filet mignon for dinner - pretty much the only meat I order if I'm going to have dinner at a nice restaurant. For the price of around $22 for a petite filet mignon I wasn't expecting much, as I've had more than my share of filet throughout the years.  I'm a weirdo though liking my meat well done, but after hearing a million people say you can't do that to a filet, I've been ordering it medium-well for close to 10 years. Appetizers & salads were great, service was prompt & my friend had her water glass refilled about 5 times haha. They were very accommodating with substitutions for sides and bringing us extra lemons for our water.  The first time my filet came out it was barely medium, so it was sent back & when it came out the 2nd time it was very well done. Although I was disappointed in this, they took it off my tab & I ate it. I could tell it was a very high quality piece of meat, even though it was well done. Definitely much better than I was expecting, & rivaled meat quality at places I'd paid twice as much for.  I barely had room for dessert, but if there's one thing I love for dessert it's creme brulee, which they had. It was different with chocolate on the bottom & candied bananas on the top, but very delicious. Everything else about the food & experience was wonderful and I will definitely plan on coming back & trying again the next time I visit the area. :)",

The hostess offered to take out a piece of flooring at a booth so I could pull up to the table, but the table would have been chest height.  This would not be a comfortable way to enjoy my meal.  I was very disappointed as Yard House is one of my favorite places to eat when I go out of town.",

    "text": "I nearly lost my $#% when I found out there was a Yard House open in Vegas! This one is a perfect addition to the Linq area sandwiched between the Quad and Casino.  If you've never been to a Yard House, it's a bar/restaurant known for having a lot on tap, a pretty extensive food menu and providing plentiful options for vegans and vegetarians.  Their menu is reasonably priced (along with some happy hour specials), especially for Vegas. My favorite thing to do is order 2-3 appetizers and get to try a bunch of different things! My boyfriend and I came here a couple times while visiting Vegas so we got a pretty good read on this location.  It looks like the wait for tables can be a little lengthy. We sat at the bar to bypass it all. The service was quick and c'mon, there is SO MUCH on tap here. It's awesome.  Not sure where to start? My food recommendations are: -Truffle fries: You really can't go wrong with these. Savory and great for sharing. -Guac and chips: They actually do a pretty solid guac here! Save the excess for smothering on your main course. -Ahi poke bowl: I would definitely ask for soy sauce to go with this, since it's a little bland otherwise. They'll bring you chopsticks if you want, but I basically inhaled this, it was so good! -French onion soup: Yes, I ordered a soup with a straight face at the bar. Twice. This was some of the best French onion soup I've ever had...perfectly flavored and boiling hot, crusted at the top with soup-absorbed bread and bubbling cheese. Yum. (PS- if you or someone in your group is getting an entree, you save about a $1.50 by adding the soup as a side instead of ordering a la carte.) -Gardein wings: One of the reasons I really enjoy Yard House is that it's vegan and vegetarian friendly. It's just friendly in general, as they also point out low calorie options on the menu, but I digress. Hands down, my favorite Gardein dish is the wings. They are perfect, from bite sized goodness to having a meaty texture that will satisfy and possibly fool some carnivores. -BBQ chicken pizza: Who doesn't love pizza in a bar? This one is top notch.",

    "text": "I've always been a fan of Yard House mainly for their exceptional beer selection on tap. If you want to step out of your regular beer bubble, this is the place to venture out of it. This restaurant is more open and spacious compared to the Town Square location. If the weather is right, I would recommend sitting upstairs on the patio with excellent views of the promenade and the High Roller.  Food from the large and diverse menu, consisting of some Asian inspired selections, while not mind blowing, has been consistent with every visit. I had the pan seared ahi on my last visit. The Chinese black bean sauce was heavy and overwhelmed the perfectly seared tuna. As far as the rest of the menu, I would not recommend the mediocre steaks or average pizza. I was pleased with the street tacos and maybe having a sampling of the appetizers with your beers is the way to go.  The beer is what I come to Yard House for and I was satisfied with my tasty lineup of four pints of darks: Brooklyn Brown, Anderson Valley Wild Turkey Stout, Deschutes Black Butte, and the Boulder Nitro Shake Chocolate Porter. If you like bourbon and stout, the Wild Turkey stout is an interesting combo that I've never had.  There have been no complaints with service on any of our visits. Expect a price point of $$ to $$$ depending on how much you drink. There's no doubt I'll be back if hanging out around the LINQ.",

I took our assistant branch manager to lunch at the yard house today and they did an excellent job the manager Alfredo Montero came to our table and greeted us and supplied us with impeccable service. I would like to give a big shout out to the Yard House for doing a great job and listening to their customers concerns. My motto is if you're going to bitch you better praise. Thank you Rick Hewitt",

You can order a YARD of beer which = 3 beers hence this being Yard House.  I just ordered a pint.  Many things looked great on the menu but my friends and I split three appetizers - spinach & cheese dip, wings, and lettuce wraps.  It was plenty to hold us over for the time being and very good.  We got seated quick, our service was very great as well.  I can't speak for full meals here but it's a great drinks & appetizers place, and I do believe they have a happy hour during the week as well.",

I recommend the pineapple Moscow mule (pineapple vodka, ginger beer and lime with a pineapple mint garnish). It was very refreshing. Aside from their rather large selection of beer and full bar, they have several items on their food menu (mainly American - a variety of sandwiches, pizza, tacos, wings, fries, salad, soup, fish and chips, salmon, chicken and much more). I like their truffle fries and sweet potato fries. The staff was nice and very attentive. I like that they provided the condiments before our meal came so we didn't have to ask. They also were generous with the limes after I had ordered a vodka tonic with extra limes.",

But my review is mostly in respects to the management and staff that night. At the table behind us was a very balligerant and drunk woman who was quickly identified by the waiter, who brought it to the attention of the manager, who in turn cut her off from buying more drinks. She obviously didn't like this, claiming \"This has never happened to me... I want to see your manager... I'm gonna report this as high as I can possibly take it...\" obviously so drunk she didn't realize she was already talking to the manager, who informed her multiple times as she kept talking in circles with him, then yelling in the restaurant trying to tear down their image in typical drunk snowflake fashion, with her inability to control her outrageous behavior. After a short time, security arrived as she and her group (who were feeding her their drinks after she was cut off) were escorted out. I was genuinely impressed with how they very patiently and calmly handled the situation, maintaining a calm and cool presence both in front of her and all the other guests. If it were me in their shoes, I'd be out of a job. She tested their patience far beyond any acceptable limit.",

This was ten dollars.  The sandwich was the disaster of the night. Very little chicken, and guac, and a whole lot of bread. The fries were tiny cut which I absolutely abhor! I tasted very little truffle sauce, and no parmasan. Go to Gordan Ramsey's Burger to get the best truffle parmesan fries in las vegas!  Moo Shu Egg Rolls were the highlight of the night. Perfectly fried, and seasoned, and came garnished with a bed of cabbage, and some nest of crisps?  Verdict: Stick with the appetizers like The moo shu egg rolls and the artichoke dip, their salads, and skip the rest including their overpriced sandwich and drinks (unless its happy hour)",

Also,  if you love pizza and other treats well you have to check this place out.   They have a wide selection of beer and the food menu during happy hour is excellent.    Pizza, union rings,  sushi and other delicious foods and nice staff not to mention that!    When in Vegas,  we always go there!",

Brittany was our fantastic upbeat waitress and always had a genuine smile on her face. No wait on a Tuesday night! Service was attentive, waters were never empty, and our main courses were quick to reach the table. I ordered the usual Mac & cheese. The full size portion was too much for me though since I tried some of my sis' roasted turkey Cobb salad with delicious ranch dressing. Dad's halibut was satisfactory; it came with asparagus, bok choy, and mashed potatoes underneath everything. Mom's two baja fried fish tacos with sriracha were to her liking and I'm surprised at how large the side classic ranch salad is.   Good thing we didn't dine here on a weekend otherwise it would've been packed with possibly a 45 minute wait. Haven't had it at this location, but I recommend the Pineapple Express mixed drink with fresh pineapple and lots of mint!",

On top of the great service he made the dinner even better with his humor. Chatted with us throughout the meal and made sure we were taken care of.   You can eat inside or out. They have heaters outside. It's on a balcony. You take an elevator up. Bathrooms however are on the first floor. Portions are big. You can share 2-3 people. The tortilla soup is to die for. Best I ever had!   Must try this place! Will be back the next Time i come out here! So good!",

We decided on the Yard House because they are a chain which normally breeds consistency and it was not far from our hotel.  We always enjoy the Yard House near us in Palm Springs.  Sad to say, this meal was awful.  We ordered two sandwiches--the pork dip and turkey club.  Fries and onion rings.  After waiting close to 25 minutes after our orders were placed the food finally arrived, totally cold.  When our waitress came by to check we told her our food was cold but we were so hungry we just tried to keep eating.  The manager came by later and said she had hot fries on the way.  She then had onion rings also remade.  However, the bottom line was we basically didn't finish either cold sandwich, the onion rings were terrible.  The only hot decent food were the new fries.  Bottom line?  We ended up basically eating one of the two bowls of hot fries for dinner.  Very disappointed in total lack of consistency in what should be a \"you-know-what-you'll-get\" chain.  Won't return here.",

We were seated immediately.  The restaurant was busy but not overwhelmed. We ordered an appetizer, Poke nachos and they were great! Once our main meals arrived all but one arrived  COLD. Chicken wings,  tacos, seafood pasta, Korean beef, mac and cheese. All dishes were cold with the exception  of the Nashville chicken.  It actually came out hot. When the meals went back the wings still came out a bit warmer than the 1st time. I then asked for chicken tortilla soup... that has to be hot right! Nope. Cold. I was disappointed in this place and the person of our group that chose it.",

We ordered a turkey club with fries and a new brunch item with rice, burger patty, egg, a sauce and more. The turkey club was good, clean and pretty standard. The brunch menu choice was better. Good sauce, loved the over easy egg added in and good flavor. The portions were a good amount on ours and everyone's we saw.

He informed me that I could not have the original rice that came with them and gave me choices of white or brown rice.  I was seriously impressed with this waiter.  He then let me know that he personally talked to the cook and the floor manager so that everyone was aware that my plate was gluten free so there would be no cross contamination.  Wow!

They have samplers available as well and a well-organized menu to help you find something you are sure to like.  The menu is also spectacular. My colleagues and I split the spinach dip appetizer. I then decided to order the poke nachos as my main course and my colleagues each ordered a slider plate for their main dishes. Each of them could be their own meal so we were each pleasantly full afterwards. The poke was not as good as Hawaiian poke but still quite tasty. The slider plate comes with 4 mini sandwiches and fries.",

Great Atmosphere & Service.  So many things on the creative menu that I want to try ~ I must return again & again!",

However, it wasn't as flavorful and exciting as expected. It ended up being our most expensive dinner in Vegas with only ordering one burger, one sandwich, and a pint of pineapple cider. The price doesn't quite match quality. Biggest plus was the garlic fries (shoestring) and cider, otherwise it was okay. Our server James was very nice.",

I called the Yardhouse at the Linq, in complete awareness that they don't do reservations after 5, in hopes that I can get good advice from a manager on how to get a table of twenty in there after 5. The manager I talked to said to come in early, about hour early, at they could hold it for 8PM.   When I got there at 7 I had a frantic manager tell me it would be at least 3 1/2 hours. I told her we didn't want to go to Chayo's because of the horrible reviews, and that we're only going there because they take reservations after 5. I also told her I called and talked to management notifying them I was coming. She still was relentless in telling us it would be a three and half hour wait. If that was TRUE, they would be closing by the time they called us. That's insane and just not possible. I understand an hour/ hour and a half wait, but three and half hours?! The woman I talked to on the phone was so nice, but the woman I talked to when I got there had a SERIOUS attitude problem. Shame on the management.",

    "text": "So I had some friends come to stay in Vegas for the Rock N' Roll Marathon and I decided to take them to Yard House.   Always a great go-to place since they have everything, 145 beers on tap, and service is always impeccable.  Carnitas Enchilada Stack?   To die for.  That stuff is fantastic!  Even with the fried egg on top, and I probably would have never thought to throw an egg on top of an enchilada.  The one thing I was kind of annoyed with was that a friend ordered a Cuban roast dip sandwich.  It's supposed to be a hot sandwich.   The first time it came out it was barely warm.   Sent it back, and the manager came over to apologize and comp'd a drink which was actually amazing (and expected of Yard House's impeccable service).  However, when the replacement sandwich came out, it actually was only a tad warmer than before.  My friend was so hungry (they flew in from the East Coast) and it was 10PM here that she said she loved it (and it is a fantastic sandwich) but I was a little miffed about it.  YH never let me down, and that was a bit of a total bummer when I have guests.  Granted, my friends said that they'll still be back to try more Yard House, but I did wish that they figured out a way to get the cuban roast HOT before serving.  Especially in Vegas with no humidity, any hot items cool down super quickly and they need to be aware of that in the food prep business.  Anyways, impeccable service!  The food (sans the temperature piece) and beers were amazing.   Will definitely continue to be a patron of YH, but I was slightly disappointed with that experience.",

At the end of dinner service our server came to take our card. While waiting, another waitress (not our server) said we had to leave because \"I was sleeping\" at the table. (I was not sleeping at the table.) Seriously out of  four of us, only 3 of us had drinks (one each) in 1.5 hours time; she accused us of being drunk.  It was extremely insulting. We won't be back.",

Everything, especially the duck wings, tasted incredible and filled with flavor. I really enjoyed the Hot Chicken with cinnamon pancakes. This was a great play on chicken and waffles.   Let me start by saying we only waited 15 minutes for a table of 7 on Saturday night. This was awesome. We could also get drinks from an outside bar as we waited.They do limit you to one drink per person at a time to ensure that you do not over do it. I think this is a great business practice especially on the strip.   Once seated, our waiter (a tall friendly gentleman named James) quickly provided us with water. He then routinely came by to take our orders as we would make up our minds. No glasses were ever empty. The food he brought us was incredible and he truly seemed interested in ensuring we had a good experience.   I don't know what could be done to make this experience better other than asking other loud guests to quiet down lol. I'll be back!",

She added their prices are also very reasonable. We entered gave our party information and went to order a drink from the bar. The bar was nice, clean and the lighting was good. We were seated in12 minutes. That's fast. And there were 5 parties ahead of ours. We ordered appetizers and entrees. The food was great. The steak was prepared to my picky specification. I like my filet mignon just a bit over medium well.  It was served above a nice serving of mashed potatoes and a delicious cream sauce. There were sliced carrots on the plate decoratively placed. It was plenty of food for me. And the filet melted in my mouth. My friend had a seafood Bisque. She said it also was delicious. The service was great. From entering the door til well after our meal and conversation were over, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. And yes the price was very reasonable. Overall it was the best filet mignon I've ever had. And I've tried alot.",

We ordered a whole bunch of dishes and while none of them stood out, it was fine since we were here to watch the World Series. That's where this place kind of falls down. Yes, there are screens everywhere. But the angle on a lot of the screens makes watching uncomfortable in a bunch of the booths or even at the bar. Given that it's one of the primary sells of this place, I feel like that's an issue with the restaurant. In some booths, the screens are also really far away. It was kind of a disappointment but at least we were able to get a table during a really crowded time.",

It is easily going to become one of the most popular spots in Las Vegas. I can best describe it as a shopping/dining/nightlife area. It's really cool, classy, and unique~!!!   Yardhouse is definitely in that same area of classiness! I attended the Grand Opening event where they offered people with an invitation free food samples and 2 drink tickets (21+). It is a huge, two-story restaurant with a ton of workers. WOW it was so much fun! The waiters and waitresses were funny, attentive, and really wanted you to taste the entire menu that they had going around.   My favorite dishes were: the Southern Fried Chicken, Margherita Pizza, Chicken Tinga Tacos, & SUMMER SALAD!! (Best Salad Ever)  My absolute favorite \"girly\" cocktail is the House Tropic. I used both my drink tickets for 2 of those ;)   At the end, they even served out a banana and chocolate creme brulee!! It was an amazing night with great service, and I just cannot wait until they really open. Watch out, Vegas! YardHouse is coming out, bigger and BETTER than ever before!!!",

I was shocked that the sausage and shrimp were seasoned,but was underwhelmed with how bland the pasta was. The dish was \"missing something\". It was not great. Just okay.

When an employee remembers a patron from one day to the next despite how many people come and go, that goes a long way with me. Great customer service!  We are going to start visiting Vegas twice a year and will definitely visit the Yardhouse again and again!  One of our favorite places with a great atmosphere!  Thanks for the sweetener Josh!",

( The restaurant at the new Linq opens at the end of February! =))  WHO: For past present, and future Yardhouse lovers, this one's for you!  WHEN: The official Grand Opening is the end of February 2014, =)  WHERE: Located at the new Linq next to the new Quad Hotel & Casino.  WHAT: I am absolutely excited about this new Yardhouse! IT IS THE LARGEST YARDHOUSE WORLDWIDE, and am proud to say it is at home in LAS VEGAS! What makes it the largest? It is 2 stories and double your regular Yardhouse!  My brother from another set of parents invited us to try the place out before their actual grand opening, and I'm glad that he did! It is absolutely amazing in there, and they sure chose the right set of staff (Derrick & Rosie are the best!! Yup, I have my favorite servers already! =)) I loved the atmosphere and the customer service. I noticed everyone working as a team that night! So, kudos to teamwork!  As for the food, my brother and I ordered the Lobster, spinach & artichoke dip as an appetizer. For our entrees, I ordered the surf & turf burger, which never disappoints, and my brother had the seared ahi sandwich, which also didn't disappoint. In a nutshell, I've always loved the flavorful menu, so they can't go wrong there!  VIVA LAS VEGAS!!",

Yard House is one of them! I have been here a dozen times and everything has been 10/10.   The venue is great! I love how it's located right off of the strip so you can get away from the loud scene but it's also close enough to the strip.   The service is great, quick, and very helpful! They are very knowledgable with their menu and food!   Everyone needs Yard House in their lives.",

In reality, this visit was a one-star experience. The waiter brought us water and menus, then literally forgot about us. About 20 minutes later I finally caught his attention. His response was lliterally, \"Oh, shit. I always forget about this table. I thought I already took your order\". Now, I'm fine with some foul language, but my teen daughter was also accompanying us. Though she also was not offended, it was completely inappropriate to swear. Back to forgetting about the table- this table was by no means out of the way. It was right in the front looking out the open-air window. I could literally touch two other tables without getting up from my seat. Now to the food. My Ahi salad was okay. A little more Ahi would have been nice. I left still hungry. The burger was probably a 4 out of 5. No complaints. However, it came out 5-10 minutes before the other meals. My wife got one of the Gardien vegetarian salads which was also not bad. We eat Gardien products at home, so we knew what to expect. The menu is HUGE, as is the beer menu. Probably 100 beers. Our service somewhat ruined the meal, but I can't hold a restaurant 100% accountable for one bad visit. We'd probably go back.",

I had a client that wanted to grab lunch here after a meeting and decided to take him up on the offer. When we arrived it was busy which was to be expected during lunch hour however we were opted for the bar area which was more suitable for the time frame.   The bartender was very attentive and great with answering any questions we had while dining. I started with the Lobster, Crab & Artichoke Dip for an appetizer and my client had the Poke Nachos. Both dishes were fairly decent no complaints on either one. For the actual lunch items I decided to do the Fish & Chips instead of my normal Spicy Jambalaya which was way too heavy for lunch lol. Client ordered the Turkey burger which he enjoyed. Overall the experience was good and I will be back if I'm in the area, the parking is kind of crazy so I'll stick to my Downtown Summerlin location and even Town Square. This location is great for anybody staying at the Linq",

Mexican, Japanese, Chinese, and Thai are among some of the cuisines the Yard is trying to incorporate but it all has a heavy handed taste bud drowning American over-tone to it. Everything on the menu is trying to bomb you out with flavor and it doesn't even work.   The only thing I really enjoyed was my guacamole. The poke nachos are a grotesque joke. Chunks of raw fish are unevenly tossed onto some nachos, with the whole monstrosity drizzled with aioli and dried seaweed. This was inedible, the fish did not taste fresh and was room temperature, but the entire concept just seems flawed to me anyway. \"Vampire Style\" is a street taco wrapped in a grilled, crispy cheese-crusted flour tortilla shell. Just no. The texture was all wrong, it makes the shell gummy with cheese, the mishmash of stuff in the taco not coming together.  I wasn't even a fan of the beer that was recommended to me.   They also turned off the music and TV's, and turned up the lights while we were still eating. The friends we were visiting who actually live in the area said, \"You don't understand, this doesn't happen in Vegas, they must REALLY want to go home\". Funny, me too!",

For vegans, a portion of the menu contains large and filling gardein-based dishes (Get the gardein chicken fried rice!) and a bomb vegan burger in addition to very filling salads loaded with avocado, beans and more than just lettuce and tomatoes. They also have personal pizzas, noodle-based dishes, burgers and typical bar food for meat lovers.   The location is right between Harrah's and the Linq, so it is right off the strip but down a bit of a calmer alleyway that doesn't have that constant buzz of people shuffling along at all hours of the day. I've been a few times and there is always a 30 minute wait to be seated, so come prepared for that. Service is average but food is top notch!",

I asked the girl at the front desk to please check with somebody she told me that the manager would've had it,  and he does not ,so that's that. I ended up canceling the card immediately. Of course right after that they found it and brought it over to a business that I was at across the way. This is going to be a huge pain in the a$$ because now my card will have to be changed in everything. I just wish somebody would've took the initiative to ask somebody besides the manager if they had my card. Will I be going back there? Probably not.",

To eat, we had chips and guacamole before we could finish there was already a fresh plate of new chips already at the table. We also ordered the buffalo cauliflower. I've never had it before but give it a try, it is different, and the buffalo sauce is excellent!   If you're in the area give this place a try, recommended!",

This could be because we were seated far away from the kitchen (a good thing) and the place was packed for the football game.   My friend ordered the nachos which she enjoyed. That is a huge order -- I would definitely split it.   I had the barbecue bacon burger. For $15, I expect a REALLY GOOD burger. It was okay. There was a very ordinary bun -- McDonald's does better -- the meat was good quality but way overcooked. It was well done, not medium rare that I ordered. And there was no lettuce, tomato, onions, which make your burger more than just bread and meat. The fries were ordinary. Lots of them, but again lukewarm. By the time I was halfway through, the food had gone cold and the fries were not worth eating. I was disappointed.   I've been to 2 of their other locations in LV and have been happy with them. I'm sorry this was not as good as I'd hoped.",

Yard House is located in a prime spot with plenty of shops and tourists - right under the High Roller. There's outdoor and indoor seating, and they give you a buzzer that lets you walk around (with boundaries) while you wait to be seated. We didn't wait long.   The menu has an array of items in each category, leaving me indecisive. I finally ordered the Nashville Fried Chicken Sandwich with sweet potato fries, and a Bahama Breeze to drink. Girly? Yes. Intriguing because it had banana flavors that were potent and delicious? Also yes.   Anyways, I inhaled what was on my plate. And it was glorious.   My boyfriend ordered the salmon entree, and loved it despite having an upper respiratory infection. He wanted to enjoy himself but the only thing he could muster up to drink was a Hot Toddy, which we were luckily able to order!!   All in all it was a wonderful dining experience, and I would absolutely recommend eating here if you're in the area.",

There are plenty of drafts and cocktails offered and specials are ever running.  The menu is diverse and has something for everyone.  Stopping in late night while on the strip was a good choice as we were able to get good food with decent portions at a reasonable price.  Service was also quick and friendly.  Can't wait to try it out again once its opens closer to home.",

I took the vegetarian option, Gardein chicken wings and chose a sauce with no dairy.   Also Julius is a great server. He double checked with me about possible allergies to cheese after my table ordered fries with cheese on the side. He didn't have to come back to check with me concerning their buffalo sauce but he did, and I am super thankful for that!  This is a great little spot and Yard House has much to offer!",

    "text": "I would love to give this a five, but the food. It stopped me. To start my partner and I had guacamole with tortilla chips, tip, if you make guacamole never forget the Lime/lemon; the plate was very bland due to sodium in the chips and guacamole. My partner ordered the vampire tacos, the beans weren't prepared well (they tasted like Bush's baked canned beans), and the rice was not zesty and flavorful as you would expect assuming it's a \"mexican\" dish, little seasoning would have made a big difference. The vampire tacos, I'm not sure where putting Bacon with Guacamole in one bite sounded appetizing but it wasn't, the plate was not finished but put aside instead, but then again who orders tacos from a Yard House?!! I had the Pene With Chicken, I originally wanted Chicken parm but they did not serve it so I got the pene instead. My chicken was dry, the Pene was very brittle, my chicken too over cooked and the plate had very little sauce which made my plate bland. I instantly had to bring my imagination to the plate and asked for Marinara with cilantro and pour it over my Chicken Pene and INSTANTLY my plate came to life, it was just flavorful and made the plate a house classic, I wish I could have recommended for it to be on the menu. But before I finish, I must say what made our experience so great was Justin, he was our server and he made sure we were taken care of when it came to our needs and that's what matters when you leave a restaurant. Came for a late night dinner and couldn't have left more fulfilled. Thank you Justin and tip to the cooks, sit the chicken on low fire, cheers.",

    "text": "It's always a hit or miss! Usually the food is typically on point it's the service that is in consistent. Rachell was our server this time around. Surprisingly they weren't busy, no wait to be seated or anything. As soon as we sat we waited about 12 mins for someone to even take our drink order. Finally when Rachell asked us what we wanted to drink it wasn't till about another 10 mins till we received our waters.   When she returned she seemed like she was in a rush. We quickly ordered, then the waiting game began again. The amount of wait time is really unacceptable for what we ordered. I LOVE the food here which is why we constantly come back but it's the service and wait time that has me taking other options at times.   This time around the Poke Stack which I love wasn't fresh, the chicken fingers had no flavor neither did the fries. Other then that the food is really a bang for your buck. I don't know why the service is so inconsistent. Rachell was not friendly not approachable and gave the vibe that she was to busy to attend.   The manager on duty walked past us and we requested to change the chicken finger order he was very friendly and served us efficiently. Everytime we come across management they are beyond helpful it's the servers that need some costumer service training. Don't look so upset when your serving your customers it gives an unapproachable vibe. Then again that almost half the staff of YardHouse. The food is what keeps us coming back it's definitely not the customer service.",

There was a small wait but my wife and I opted to sit at the bar. The bar staff is extremely knowledgeable of the beers which is quite impressive given the variety. I ended up getting a dogfish head 90 minute (a terrific IPA) and my wife ordered a mojito, which was made perfectly.   Now to the food. We started with the Lobster Spinach dip and it was ok. Nothing bad, but I didnt completely love the flavor... but afterwards, I still cannot get over how amazing the Mac n Chz squared is! A mouthwatering portion of applewood smoked bacon, chicken and mushrooms cooked together beautifully makes me never want kraft ever again. I will definitely be faced with a difficult decision when I come back whether to try something else or indulge in this masterpiece again. All around great dining experience. The room is a little loud and kind of difficult to keep a conversation, but the service was great, food was spectacular, and cant beat the beer selection. Also being right next to the highroller was ideal as we rode it after dinner.",

I suggest the skirt steak salad or the ahi tuna sandwich.  Both were great. The wine list was thorough, but not huge.  The prices were great; plus, like Maggiano's and the Capital Grille (but unlike Morton's), you can taste almost anything before ordering -- a great way to sell a bottle of wine.

I happened to be there on the night of St. Patrick's day, and the atmosphere was super fun, especially because of the moveable glass wall panels that opened up the restaurant allowing everyone inside to feel like they were a part of the party happening outside! Our server, Rachel, was great - as was the food. According to the meat eaters in my party, the turkey burgers were out of this world. As a vegetarian foodie myself, I was pleased with the number of vegetarian friendly options. With the super extensive food and drink menus, Yard House seemed like a place that would have an option to please every palate - although if you like lots of different types of food, all the options can be overwhelming, so I would recommend checking out the menu online first to start narrowing down all the choices!",

Made some pleasant small talk with George, and a beer sampler arrived, confirming our choice for the first half yard. Well played, George... . Decided on Wisconsin cheese curds (deep fried, of course), a few tacos, and an absolutely epic turkey pot pie! The cheese curds could be a meal by themselves. The turkey pot pie could be 3! . Wish we could stay in town longer, to try some of the other offerings... If our small sampling tonight is any indication of the overall quality, then it's impossible to go wrong.

My coworker and I sat at the bar for our dinner and with over 100 draft beers available we asked our bartender for recommendations based on the type of beers we liked, we were also given samples of the beers that we were interested in trying.  Since the bartender had been so helpful with the beer selection I asked him for food recommendations as well.  Without thinking twice he suggested the ginger crusted salmon with wasabi mashed potatoes.  I started my meal out with a small salad which was a good size and had an array of vegetables, cheese and some croutons for crunch.  I then moved onto my salmon and was so happy I ordered it.  The salmon had a delicious ginger crust on it and was cooled perfectly.  The wasabi mashed potatoes were good as well but the salmon stole the show! My coworker had a burger and he really enjoyed that as well.  This place is a chain so I will definitely be looking for a location to go to near me!",

I love the ranch dressing. The French fries are super crispy and delicious. We also ordered the nachos.they are so tasty. The chicken tenders are really good. The Mac and cheese was OK. It had a odd taste. But still edible. The server was really Nice. However the hostess was kind of rude.",

    "text": "I went here for my birthday with my boyfriend and sad to say, we weren't all that impressed with the service. The food was great, don't get me wrong! But the service was terrible. We came here on a Friday a little before noon, and got seated immediately. Our waitress, Emmie, came to greet us as we were seated and took our drink orders. However, it took about 10 minutes before our drinks came to us. 10 minutes to get our drinks! How ridiculous is that? We eventually got our orders placed, which was the Lobster, Crab & Artichoke dip for our appetizer to share, the Grilled Korean Pork Belly Street Tacos for me and the Asada Street Tacos for my boyfriend.   It took a good 30-45 minutes before our food came out, and by that time, my drink was running low. I had placed my empty glass at the end of the table in hopes somebody would come up and offer to give me a refill, but that didn't happen. We were seated in a booth close to the kitchen, numerous employees had passed by our table, so it's not like we were hidden. But they just passed by our table, overlooking my empty glass. Emmie finally took notice (she seemed very oblivious, not good work ethic!) and gave me a refill, apologizing that their computers were down and the food orders were backed up. We could understand that our food might take a while, but getting a drink refilled? Again, absolutely ridiculous. Eventually, all our food came out...including the appetizer that we specifically asked to be brought out first before our main dishes. Thankfully, the food looked delicious to make up slightly for this.  The Lobster, Crab & Artichoke dip was DELICIOUS. It came with pieces of pita bread and chips, and I really liked it with the pita bread. We both really enjoyed the dip, we just wished it came out before the main dishes did. The tacos were phenomenal. My boyfriend enjoyed his Asada tacos (I had a bite and they were quite tasty!) and my Grilled Korean Pork Belly tacos were nothing short of awesome. Each taco dish came with 2 tacos, a scoop of their spicy rice, and a small bowl of beans. The meat in both tacos were cooked to perfection, not too much that it had a charred taste. The rice was alright, the beans could have been better.   By the end of our meal, we both had empty glasses (received no offer on refills, what is up with this place and getting drinks??) and we waited about 10 minutes to get the check. Overall, I'd say the food rocked more than the service did!!",

He bypassed the question and we just paid the bill. As I was sitting there the manager came over twice to talk to the person who set up the party, and who's birthday it was. I could not believe how rude he was with his comment's.  Costumer service was horrendous.  The food was great but that was it. I will not be going back to that Yard house again.  The only reason I gave 2 stars was due to waitress.  If it was not for her one star ar best.",

We went here on our last day of a 4 day trip to Vegas for lunch since it was recommended by one of my friends who lives in LA and frequents there.  I checked out the menu and was immediately hooked since they had a whole section with Veggie Meat products!  We ended up getting the Spicy Thai Veggie Chicken Pizza (as Thai and Pizza lover - I have always wanted to try this!), side of fries, and garlic noodles.  My friend got the regular Spicy Thai Chicken Pizza.  We didn't order any beer but were highly tempted with their amazing vast collection.  The service was fast and friendly and the prices were reasonable with great serving portions.  We were stuffed with the delicious food! The only problem I see is that there isn't a Yard House near us in NJ!!!!!! If there was, I can guarantee I would be there on a twice weekly basis!",

I ordered the cheese curds which are crispy with a smooth cheese filling; perfect with the hourse radish sauce which gives them a kick.  I tried one of my mother's coconut shrimp which was crispy & suculent with the perfect amount of coconut.  Weather you dine inside or on the padio, you cannot go wrong.

The pasta is great as well believe it or not, BUT I always revert to my favorite Seared Ahi steak sandwich, I'm hooked! I mean what's not to love, it's seared perfectly on the outside and raw inside, with the addition of the caramelized onion and peppercorn aioli? It's the perfect marriage. Try it, you wont be disappointed. Their menu is extensive so it'll take several visits to try most of them. It's a cool and fun place to hang out, chill vibe. They have something for everyone, be it beers on tap or girly cocktails, whatever floats your boat basically. As far as desserts, I love the chocolate souffle and macadamia nut cheesecake. The smores brownie was pretty good, decadent even but it's a tad too sweet for me.",

I had a great time there so when I saw that there are Yard House locations here (Linq and Red Rock, maybe somewhere else as well?) the beer enthusiast within got excited!  Their beer list is ridiculously extensive and organized pretty much every way you can organize them. Our server seemed pretty knowledgeable about the beers and was really helpful when I was searching for a particular beer. They didn't have the beer but she was willing to bring me a sample of another beer and search for a comparable beer. Keep that in mind when visiting Yard House, don't be afraid to ask for a sample.   Their food list is also extensive and if I could describe it - I would say it is a fusion of many foods. I ended up going with a burger because we were headed to a show... but the burger was GOOD and huge and a very good price! For the strip, I'd say this is probably some of the lowest pricing for the types of food offered. It's no fancy place but they have plenty of TVs, seating, windows with views of the Linq Promenade and High Roller, and friendly servers (service) to go and enjoy yourself and fill your belly.",

I was able to get the jerk chicken wings, and those were definitely on hit. I would've gotten more, but I was already full off the ribeye steak, yummy yummy. I like medium well, so it was cooked to perfection. I honestly think this is the first place we should have ate, instead of the last. Definitely worth going too, if you're in town. My party that I was with also enjoyed their food, and we all left more than satisfied with our Bellies full. Service was on point, as thy kept the water coming(which was necessary) and we didn't have to keep calling for them, As we were constantly being checked on. I recommend",

The highlight of the meal was the cocktail! I ordered the citrus crush which my friend strongly recommended. It was so good! Perfectly sweetened mojito and the lemon and mint bring a refreshing taste! Perfect for a hot day!  Service: I would say service is pretty good. The waitress for our table was very helpful especially since there were people in our party who wanted to try their draft beers.   Tip: They give free samples of beer, I believe before you order a half yard. My friend and I got to try a red and brown beer. Moose drool was our favorite of the two! Safe choice and refreshing!",

    "text": "Okay experience, food was mostly decent, service was meh.    Three of us went.  I ordered a caesar salad with my steak, and when it was delivered, the runner asked, \"would you like some pepper on your salad?\" to which I replied, \"Heck yeah!\"  He never came back.  I started eating anyways, and when our waiter finally came by, I asked for pepper... To which he brought me salt and pepper shakers.  Hate to be a snob, but I know YardHouse, and I know they have fresh cracked pepper!  He was just too lazy to go get it.  Anyways.  I had a steak that was cooked perfectly to my taste (and as I had requested).  The side was some broccolini stuff that was not seasoned at all, and at best steamed for just a quick few seconds.  I left that behind on the plate, but the steak was the hero here.  One of the others ordered the same steak but with the shrimp add-on.  When I looked over, I asked him if he was going to eat that...  Because there's no way I would have.  The shrimp was almost completely raw on one side still!  Once our waiter finally made his 10-minute interval rounds again, my friend told him of the issue and said, \"please just take it off the bill, I don't want to wait.\"  Instead, the waiter grabbed a side plate, had him put the shrimp on it to \"go show my manager.\"  So then the manager comes by and says \"Sorry about that, we're making a fresh one for you right now that is properly cooked.\"  That eventually showed up as we were all more or less finished eating.    Super slow and inattentive service, the food (aside from raw shrimp) was decent...  Unfortunately, not up to par with all of the other YardHouse locations I've been to in AZ.  But that steak...  Mmmmm good.",

It's the usual restaurant-with-bar atmosphere -- loud chatter and big screen TVs everywhere.  Two of the people in my party ordered the HUGE turkey pot pie, one ordered a salad, and I ordered chicken tenders with fries. The shoestring fries were delightfully well-seasoned and crispy! And, the chicken was moist and cooked just right. The breading seemed airy and light, so it gave me the impression that it wasn't as cholesterol-laden as normal chicken tenders. I'm sure I'm wrong. The pot pies and the salad were devoured, so I'm guessing my friends really enjoyed their meals as well.  Our server was friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. Near the end of the meal, she had to take a short break, so she introduced us to another server who would take her place. Our replacement server was nice as well. Overall, it was a great experience and I would definitely come here again.",

Oh man, I am still thinking about how good they were! Crispy, salty, savory slices of potato with two dip options - one creamy, one ketchup-based. This is not to be missed! For drinks I had a refreshing pineapple cider and my husband had an IPA sampler. For dinner I had the summer salad and he had tacos. The future bride and groom in our group were given a free dessert that said \"congrats\" on the plate, which was really sweet of Yard House. I highly recommend checking out Yard House if you're near the LINQ!",

    "text": "Yard House is s great place to go for drinks and food. They have over 50 beers on tap and their cocktails are amazing. The restaurant is a place for fun. You're right next to the High Roller. The best seats are on the patio upstairs. You're surrounded by locals and tourists enjoying a night out on the town. You can hear loud music being played directly in front of the restaurant and I haven't heard a bad performer yet. The restaurant does tend to be loud however this matches the atmosphere of the restaurant. The waitstaff have always been pleasant and helpful. The menu is long and broad: from jambalaya to pizza you'll never leave hungry. The menu is so long that it does take quite some time to decide. The portions are huge. The food isn't the greatest however it matches the atmosphere. I definitely recommend giving this a try!",

    "text": "A few hours after I arrived in Vegas on July 9, 2015, I went to the Yard House with a few friends and my boyfriend for dinner. The monorail station was pretty close, so it only took five minutes to get here. Since my friends were able to get a table before everyone arrived, there wasn't any need to wait in line that slithered out the front entrance. The atmosphere was lively with loud music. We sat in a booth and our server was definitely as energetic and jolly as the atmosphere.  I ordered the Korean Pork Belly taco plate with beans and rice. Two friends ordered a salmon dish with Wasabi mashed potatoes and a side of vegetables. Another friend ordered a burger and the other ordered a taco plate similar to mine. My boyfriend ordered the jambalaya. We also had some appetizers, which were just as flavorful.  When our food arrived, everyone enjoyed their meals and we had the time of our life. The Korean Pork Belly Tacos were crispy, juicy, and slightly spicy. I'm salivating just thinking about it. Two friends that ordered the salmon dish with Wasabi mashed potatoes did not finish their meals, so I decided to try one of the mashed potatoes. Who has ever had Wasabi mashed potatoes anyway? I haven't, so I tried it and loved how the Wasabi wasn't overpowering at all. I basically finished it and didn't have room for dessert.  Overall, service was beyond excellent. Prices were decent. I spent less than $25 on my meal plus a drink. The food was incredibly delicious. Wasabi mashed potatoes? Korean tacos? YES PLEASE!",

The location is newer and seats a good amount of people, so the wait was only about 5 minutes.  I started out with a bottle of rose, which is quite perfect (only one on the menu).  I tried the pastrami benedict burger (omg a fried egg on top... yes, please), and my friend ordered the BBQ chicken salad.  Both were amazing.  As a complimentary birthday dessert, my friend received the mini chocolate souffle cake and vanilla ice cream with specialty cocoa to dip it in.  YUM.  In my eyes, YH can do no wrong.  Keep on keepin' on.",

I ended up LOVING what she suggested (Alaskan Amber) & her attitude was so refreshing because all the bars we wandered in our hotel (the Delano) were HIGH priced drinks, I'm taking PBR tall boys for $9, with unfriendly bartenders who were not genuine to me at all.

I remember mom got fried chicken, and the server was very accommodating to her likes and dislikes (with no eye rolling or impatience).

I spoke to the manager and I was told that the chefs have not been trained on how to cook different temperature eggs. Yep, instead I ordered sea bass. That my friends they can cook, but eggs over easy... Well... That's an entirely different advanced coarse at the culinary school. The management staff informed me that eggs with the steak is new and they are still fine tuning on how to properly cook the eggs. This is why the only option was scrambled. I informed the manager I will be more than willing to hold an advanced class in the kitchen right now free of charge on how to cook an egg over easy. I was not taken up on this offer. I then informed her if more than one chef would like to sit in, again... Free of charge. No go.  Go for the beer, not the food.",

The menu is varied and when I'm in Vegas again, I will probably go back and try something else.",

    "text": "The food was amazing, absolutely no complaint there.  But here is how my rating went down:       When my friends and I arrived, they were not busy.  It was really nice, tables clean, etc.  I'm pretty sure we had 2 waitresses but they looked pretty similar so it's hard to tell.  One of their names was Magdalene (according to the receipt).  As far as keeping our drinks filled they did great, which we needed because......it was an hour before we saw our entrees (and this is being generous.)       Once we noticed, without a doubt, that people who arrived after us were receiving their food before us, my friend asked about our orders.  Our waitress replied that \"it should only be another 3 to 5 minutes,\" but she would go check.  (How she would know 3-5 minutes before she went to look is beyond me, but I digress.)  She comes back and says they're plating it now, it will be out soon. Our  food did come at this point, and like I said, we all loved our food.         The waitress brought our check without us having to ask for it - that was good.  There were 4 of us, and we were all paying for our own meal, so it was split payment between cash and credit.  There was more than enough to cover the bill, because like I said, we were each paying our own meal.  I told her to charge my card first and for how much, and to use the cash after.  She walks away and we see her go to the computer for a while, then she disappears for another 5 minutes (again, generous).  When she returns, I open the folder and the only thing in there is my card and the slip for me to sign.  I'm clearly puzzled, because I knew we had change coming back.  She probably notices because she says...... wait for it......  \"You guys didn't want change did you?\"       Ex-cah-use me?   She seriously tipped herself.  I've heard of (and experienced) automatically billed tips for large parties, but a) we were a party of four, b) this was not on the bill, and c) none of us have ever had a waiter or waitress just keep the change unless we said to.  Is this what gets done to tourist?          She starts to walk away before any of us even reply, so I say \"Hold on.\"  My friend asks her how much change there was and she says \"Oh I'm not sure let me look\"  What?  Yes, you are sure - or maybe this is something you do all the time so it's hard for you to keep track.         Just so you know Magdalene, since apparently you are not aware, it is up to the patron to decide how much and IF they tip you, not for you to decide based on how you think you did.  We would have tipped you, but based on principle - you do not make the choice to keep someone's money and ask questions later.  What you did was extremely rude.  We probably would have tipped you even more than you took,  so thanks for taking it upon yourself to reward yourself.  It saved us some money.",

I was greeted by many pleasant hosts and was sat with my party right away. Our server took great care of us. We ordered Moscow Mules, beer flights, queso, salads, steak, Parmesan crusted chicken and orange chicken. The items were all delicious! Everything was served in great time and full of flavor. We were very happy with the service, drinks and food and even as locals it was worth the drive to visit this Yardhouse on the Strip.",

The BBQ Burger didn't disappoint either. Prices were the best: $15-18 per plate (less for the burgers), staff were professional and fun...what a combo! Did I mention their beer/cider list? I was torn between a few ciders, and our server graciously brought me some free samples. $7.00 for a pint of delicious cider.

The service is pretty fast and the space is big, so we've never had to wait too long for a smaller party.",

So, we went to Margaritaville around the corner, which was only serving apps, and were told to check out the new places nearby The LinQ.  Wow, this place was brand new (only open three days at the time), had outrageously delicious food, had an amazing view of the gigantic Ferris wheel from the patio...I could really just go on and on.   If you go, sit on the upstairs patio.   If you like cider, try the pineapple!  My bf had a great steak and I ordered the Thai Noodle Salad. It was amazing and I wish the nearest Yard House was closer than Orlando (I live in Tampa, FL). I'd probably go once a week for sure.",

    "text": "I can't believe I waited so long to write a review (it's been a month since I was there). We stayed at the Linq  and was looking for a place to eat.  I researched beforehand because my bf is Vegetarian. Heard that Yard House serves Gardein dishes. A little skeptical because my boyfriend doesn't like a lot of food and sticks to the basics. Also, I will say I was being a little selfish...I wanted to try their Truffle Burger (me no vegetarian).   Our server was really bright and cheerful (I'm not great at remembering names). She took our drink orders and kept them coming throughout the whole meal. So, my boyfriend ordered the Gardein Grilled Chicken and Avocado Sandwich with fries (I was still skeptical). And, I did order the Black Truffle Cheeseburger with tomato bacon jam & fries.  Oh my gosh!!!  They were both mouthwatering!!!  So scrumptious.  My bf said I found a winner. And, he does not enjoy a lot of different foods.  You do not know what this means.   Of course we came back the next day to check out some other dishes on the menu. Our server was a guy today (still did not remember names, sorry). Same thing, bright & cheerful and kept our drinks coming.   This time I ordered the Sweet Potato Fries with Maple Bacon Cream Dip (ask for more if you run out of dip). Oh my gosh, these were the best tasting fries ever and I could eat the dip all day long!!!  Phenomenal. Also ordered the Pear and Gorgonzola Flatbread. Said it was in the Snack section. Was bigger than snack portions. And it was amazing. My bf ordered the Chopped Salad, Tomato Bisque and the Mini Peach Apple Cobbler. He loved, loved, loved his order as well. So much so that he called the Manager over and told him how much we loved both visits, complimented both servers for both days and explained how much he loved the meal. I mean...this is big with him because with him being Vegetarian, not a lot of great choices out there.  Coupled with the fact that he is finicky. But, he was so impressed with this restaurant. The manager asked us where we are from (L.A.) and let us know there's some here as well. WE WILL BE FREQUENTING THEM. And, also will be coming back to this location as he is a Poker Tournament player and we visit Vegas often.   So happy to have found this place. Thank you all at Yard House.",

I chose the shrimp rice bowl, kind of simple but when traveling and getting up for early I don't like too many heavy meals. Oh. My. Goodness it was perfect! Also fairly fast.

The food was quick and the tasty.  The atmosphere was casually sophisticated (aside from the cackling chics down the bar from us).  I'll certainly return when for table seating when I have time to take my time and enjoy this restaurant.  Although, the gentlemen next to me received his burger incorrectly made twice... they were prompt to replace it and genuinely apologetic, comping his meal and offering him an appetizer to hold him over.

The food wasn't anything spectacular but it was good and did the trick. For the price though, it was fantastic. If you're here for lunch, definitely get the lunch special.   At the end of our meal, Frank brought out a birthday dessert for my boyfriend. We were pleasantly surprised and it was nice that he remembered that little fact from the beginning of our conversations, even though it was a few days away.

It is a haven for beer lovers in the \"Bud Light\" death zone that is the strip. As a craft beer fan, this is exactly what the doctor ordered.   The food is just ok, but but the prices are reasonable and the variety is staggering. There seems to be a different item for every taste. The are executed well enough, but let's face it, you don't go here for the menu.   Cheers!",

I had the bbq chicken pizza and my wife had jambalaya. The kids had Mac and cheese. The bbq sauce was too ketchupy for my taste and the chicken was dry. The sauce would have been better if it was sweeter. My wife and I both are from Louisiana and we both felt that the jambalaya was too rich. The kids macaroni was bland and under cooked. The wait staff was friendly but a little slow. We were expecting a nice restaurant unfortunately we found an expensive tourist attraction.",

    "text": "Normally, Yard House is a sure thing. We came to this location as we had family staying on The Strip and they have never been to The Linq. At first, we were going to Brooklyn Bowl, but because it was a nice night, we wanted to sit out on the patio for dinner.  Food and drinks are always good at YH. I had the surf and turf burger. However it didn't have the buttery goodness as how it's served at the Irvine Spectrum location. My husband had the lobster and crab omlette. The small bite I had, the egg seemed over cooked. My brother-in-law had the seared ahi that he enjoyed very much.  Dinner and family conversation was going well until the alley singer came back from \"lunch\" to finish her gig. The music playing in YH was already loud so adding the high pitch alley singer, who also had her sound louder than YH, started to give us a headache. Unfortunately, because the alley singer has a performers permit, they couldn't shut her down.   On top of that, the tourist sitting at the table next to us had too much to drink that he didn't make it to the restroom and barfed against the restaurant wall behind me. I wouldn't have noticed because it was so loud, but it was at my brother-in-law side view that he saw it all. The servers were quick to clean up after the incident.  I have to say that our server was absolutely fabulous.  So despite all that was unpleasant with this location, I still love YH, just won't be returning to this location anytime soon.",

    "text": "So, I went to Yard house at the LINQ & I was flabbergasted by how the manager handle my situation. I ordered the gardein version of their wings and my friend also ordered the gardein wings with sweet potato fries. When our orders were brought to our table, I put one of the boneless wings in my mouth. I didn't like it and I noticed the consistency didn't seem like gardein; so, I spit it out. My friend saw the look on my face and asked what was wrong. Initially, I was confused. I thought that I maybe didn't like the new barbecue sauce, but when I looked closer I realized that it wasn't gardein wings at all. I was hoping that I was incorrect in assuming it was chicken! However, when I brought the waitress over she said that they were indeed chicken wings. She told us that she thought that the button she selected when placing the order was for the gardein option. The kicker here is that this particular waitress had a shirt on that said she was a staff TRAINER! So, if the staff trainer doesn't know how to put in a order appropriately how is she training the other staff on what they're supposed to be doing? The manager comes over and says that he was sorry that they mixed up the order, and asked \"...but did I inform the waitress that I was vegan or that my friend was vegetarian?\" I told him that I did not inform her that I was vegan because I don't feel like I should have to announce that I'm vegan to everyone that I talk to. I ordered buffalo gardein wings, and that is what should have been served to my table. He said they have specific protocol that the waitress didn't follow which is obvious because she didn't even know how to correctly put in an order, but yet and still she is a trainer. *face-palm* So the manager tells us \"we're all human and people make mistakes.\" I find this answer unacceptable from a manager period. When someone has either an allergic or dietary restrictions, there is very little room for error. So his response, saying that everyone makes mistakes was just completely irresponsible and inappropriate. At the very basic level of customer service you should make your consumers feel like you understand the problem that YOU caused. The waitress repeated our orders back to us correctly. She did not accidentally hit the wrong button; she did not seem to UNDERSTAND HOW to correctly input the information. The manager then says, \"I'm sorry. I understand, but you guys can leave right now and take your drinks to go if you want.\" What? I'm sure I could leave if I want. The manager, Andrew, needs to go to some additional training about conflict resolution because the way he came over to our table was completely nonchalant and had an air of arrogance and was very condescending showing little to no remorse. Just an \"Oh...well. We're all humans\", \"It is what it is\" type of attitude. he didn't say it in a vile way, but everything that came out his mouth was just so laissez-faire like the fact that his staff served chicken to a vegan and a vegetarian because she didn't know how to input the order was commonplace. There after, I ordered gardein wings, my same order once again in hopes that maybe this \"professional establishment\" could get it together since I was speaking to the manager. He then comes over to tell me that there's a possibility for cross-contamination with my gardein wings. I asked whether or not Yard House uses a separate fryer for the gardein, vegan, and vegetarian options. He said yes they do. Here's kicker number 2, Andrew says that when the restaurant gets busy he cannot guarantee that they will use the designated fryers because they're trying to get the orders out in a timely manner. To me that makes no sense. Either you have a set of procedures that you follow or you have no control over your employees. I really loathed that he came over just to make excuses for what happened instead of just apologizing and trying to sympathize with the fact that they screwed up and leaving it at that. The only saving grace from this trip was that the front desk was pleasant and the replacement server Brandi was excellent. Brandi had a great attitude when she spoke to us and apologized for something that she was no way responsible for AND proceeded to take care of us for the rest of the meal with empathy. I will say that the manager did end up comping our food at the end, but his initial attitude like we as customers had something to do with their errors as an establishment was a complete turn off for me. Brandi actually said I'm so sorry, and the fact that you put the chicken in your mouth makes it 10 times worse. She seemed sincere and was just very pleasant all around. Her conflict resolution skills were exemplary. It came down to her taking responsibility for the establishment's shortcomings without making excuses that shows her True leadership. Brandi should keep up the work, and maybe be a trainer for this staff! She could also teach her manager a thing or two.",

There was a 30 minute wait so we went to the bar to hang out while we waited. The bar has a great selection of beer, had trouble choosing what is get. Bartender let me  try out a couple beers before making a decision, I always like that.  Unfortunately the service took a bit of a bad turn once we got a seat at the bar to eat dinner. We waited a good amount of time for the guy who was previously serving us to take notice, not to mention anyone else. Had to call out to someone to finally get noticed. Got some chips and guacamole, it was delicious, as well as the fish and chips. No complaints about the food, I must mention the fries are pretty good, thinly cut and crispy.  I'd come back, but I won't be having dinner at the bar again.",

I tried the gardein Orange peel meal instead of chicken and I was pretty impressed. The only thing is the entree could have been a little warmer. It was not hot. The gardein did not have that processed taste. The sauce was flavorful. I also had the spicy edamame and mixed greens. I would reccommend trying if you like orange peel chicken but do not eat meat like me.",

The buffalo \"chicken\" tenders were amazing and I enjoyed the chopped salad with the bloody mary vinaigrette. I love salads that have an equal ratio of vegetables - including lettuce.  The service was great as well. One weird thing: they ask everyone that comes in if they have been there before. If you say no then there is just a welcome, the same as if you had said yes. You expect something \"special\" after a question like that so it is very awkward. We sat near the door so witnessed it over and over.",

He never asked us how our food was, did we want refills, would we care for dessert!!!! I honestly don't know if he was high or just a terrible server. I of course didn't get a name, but he was about 5'9\" with dark hair and a full beard. We had tickets for the high roller, so we were too short on time for me to request a manager.

The Pros: friendly staff, not a super long wait, menu for everyone, yes even a kids menu (rare on the strip) The 9 year old had the hamburger and fries..he cleaned up the plate. The 32 year old had salad and Mac and cheese which she said \"was to die for\"...it was creamy and had truffle oil? She loved it. We old folks...well he had the pepper crusted filet and salad. He was very content..he didn't rave but he said was flavorful. It came with masked potatoes, asparagus and a house gravy that was good. He wasn't blown away but felt he got his money's worth. I had the southern fried chicken breast..it came with mash potatoes, BBQ beans, cream corn and gravy. Mine was off the chain. Delicious. Apparently they have an enormous beer menu..we did not partake but daughter says it was impressive list. The only real cons: LOUD..not just the music it's the clanging of dishes, scooting chairs...TVs it was not a place to try and have a conversation. Lol Service was a wee slow but seems that was a common theme in Vegas this particular week. I Highly recommend this restaurant for the food and it does have a lively atmosphere and a great view of the Linq and High Roller. It's a short walk down the Linq from Las Vegas Blvd.",

I had 4 different 9oz beers to sample.  The roll was a modern twist but they pulled it off.  The waitress warned us first.  The pizza was one of the best I ever had , thin crispy crust and very fresh and flavorful.  The sandwich just seemed ok from the one bit I had.  The fries came out cold but the waitress took care of that no problem. We enjoyed the place so much we went back for lunch the next day.  Both wait staff were very good.

We got a very friendly server of Asian decent (i forgot his name) he was quick to get us drinks and was so nice! We started with jerk chicken wings around $10.00 and got lots of big wings with yummy jerk seasoning and side of jerk bbq sauce and it was amazing. For entree, I got the porcini crusted halibut that comes with Parmesan mashed potatoes and porcini cream sauce with white truffle oil with asparagus and bok Choy. The fish was melt in your mouth delicious. It was so tender but firm and seasoned perfectly. The mashed potatoes accompanied the fish great, so did the asparagus. The bok Choy was ok but I'm not really a huge fan of bok Choy in the first place. It was around $25 and very worth it considering the quality of the food. The portions are pretty on point even though it was sooooo good I wanted it more lol. Boyfriend got the two tacos (you can mix and match two taco combo at a fixed price) he chose the Korean bbq short rib taco and jerk swordfish taco and it came with Mexican rice and refried beans. He loved the Korean bbq taco and the rice. The tacos were pretty small which was the only con through the mean and He didn't really like the fish tacos because it was too bitter and too strong flavored. Overall, it was a great experience and will be back again. I also love how variety the menu is. Everyone can find something they will like at a great price. I love how you can get $10 burgers to $40 steak. Drinks looked great too.",

Lower patio is great. The upper patio at night offers one of the best views of the Linq promenade at night amazing space to enjoy beautiful weather.    Avoid the long waits at the host stand if your a party of two or less and just head right for the bar.  With so many different tap choices the friendly staff will let you sample different beer styles to find that perfect one to accompany your meal.  FYI they do not take reservations for large parties on Fridays and Saturdays.",

There are tons of seating options- Booths Tables Humongous bar I think there's an upstairs  We got -  Lobster dip - it was tasty and creamy but almost had no lobster in it.  It appeared to be served in a large crock but it was barely a quarter inch deep. It was the first time I've ever ordered a dip in a restaurant that had more chips/ bread than dip.  Salad - I recall the salad being a large and tasty but nothing too memorable.   With so many options of places to eat in Vegas, I'm not sure that I'd be back unless somebody highly recommends what needs to be ordered on my next visit.",

Pros: - Ability to accommodates large parties (we had about 20 people) - Good selection of alcoholic drinks and brews for beer lovers - Tasty assortment of finger foods and small plates for sharing - Opens late so great place for hanging out  - Centrally-located off the Las Vegas strip opposite to Caesars Palace on the Flamingo-LinQ-Harrah's side - Good service, attentive staff and reasonably-priced fare  Cons: - Extremely noisy and lively environment (could be a Pro) - Expect long wait time (We waited for about 40 min before being seated)  All in all, a good place to come when in Vegas.",

But if you're only going to get one thing, get the cheese curds, you won't regret it. They are delicious with the honey and ranch dipping sauces.",

First, it was right next to the LINQ Ferris wheel that mimics the London Eye and I had no clue there was an entire boardwalk and shopping area right there. SO cute and might be my new favorite part of Vegas.  The restaurant is at the end of the boardwalk and you can see everyone loading and unloading onto the LINQ. So it's pretty close. They have outside seating which is my first choice in a sit down, but majority rules and we sat inside. But the balcony was so nice and has a great view.  I ordered the Tacos which came with a side of rice and refrigerate beans. I devoured my Baja Fish Taco. It was SO good and I recommend everyone tries it. I also got the pork Taco with grilled pineapple and it was also very delicious. He portions were big and I was completely full from my platter. The refried beans were in a small soup dish and were baked with a layer of cheese on top. I've never had them this way and now I will be sad if I don't in the future.   Highly recommend for parties and lots of different opinions. They have a large menu and can accommodate any appetite.",

So many of their appetizers are a meal in itself.   Yard House is one of those restaurants that you can always count on for good food and good service at reasonable prices and they don't skimp on the portions.   Whether you eat inside or out on the patio, Yard House has a great vibe & a cool atmosphere especially here in Vegas as it's located off the cobbles stones parlor style streets in the Linq Promenade. They've got a varied menu that's sure to please anyone's palate.   Service was top notch! There were no complaints in our party of 5, just struggled to get through the large plated portions! Worth a visit for something a little more affordable in Las Vegas.  In our group we had a Cheese Burger, a lettuce wrapped burger which both were outstanding- juicy and delicious. Margarita Pizza with fresh while roasted garlic, a Poke Bowl & Shrimp & Calamari Diablo. Everything was superb!   Stop by any time, you won't be disappointed. Plus you can walk off your meal by browsing all the shops in the amazing promenade; even experience the high roller or enjoy the fun featured zip line.",

The hockey game was on when we walked in 20 min before kickoff but the bartender assured us football would be on with sound once the game started.   They had a list of half price apps and drink specials.   The drink specials were a few dollars off mixed drinks and although they sell doubles it's a better deal to just get two singles, because the discount is on the total drink price so a double costs more somehow (a flaw we noticed ordering doubles).   We tried the fried mac and cheese and I loved it.  It came with a tomato bisque dipping sauce and it was delicious. We also got the chips & guac which was average.   Overall, HUGE beer selection and great Happy Hour/Football specials. The bartenders we had were great as well. I will definitely be coming back next time I'm in town.",

We ordered the lamb burger which was cooked to order. They did an excellent job of preparing the meat with a touch of pink. The peppers and cream cheese gave the burger a delicious balance of spicy and savory. Overall two thumbs up for yard house at the link.",

    "text": "This restaurant is one of my favorites, I frequently visit during my lunch break, as I work near by. I have a few reasons I like this place. The variety of menu items, I particularly like the tuna options.  I usually order: ahi sashimi, I add masago and Serrano peppers for spicy spicy tuna roll - which was is actually a cake like culinary presentation.  Poke nachos, which I also add Serrano's too  I find them to usually be accommodating, with a few odd reactions or mix ups of what it is I'm adding and if they have any, which they typically do on other plates.  I also particularly like their drinks, I love the el picante w the jalapeno pepper, so good!  Also that they offer a huge variety of beer on tap, though I've yet to actually try a yard, I want to!  I also have tried the cauliflower buffalo bites, Mac n cheese, truffle fries - bomb with their creamy Aoli garlic sauce, they have a lot of good sauces too!  Another frequent side is the tortilla soup, creamy cheesy w a scoop of guacamole and tortilla chips sprinkled. One of the best recipes, not overly tomato flavored.  Also enjoy the fact they have indoor and outdoor shaded patio seating. Upstairs has a balcony too in the linq location, which does make for a more touristy scenic view. Overall this place is a chain I do favor.",

We weren't gonna come here initially because it seemed like the location was hard to access. I wanted to check out the promenade too so we showed up to have lunch and shop.  To get here, simply drive to the back of Flamingo, behind it you will see a parking lot for Link and Promenade. You park there, walk out of the parking lot to the right and up the path to the stairs. There you will find promenade and Yard House, etc. They validate parking so don't forget to bring your parking stub with you. Now to the food..I ordered the enchilada stack. It's probably one of the best things I've ever eaten.. it's is as described, only better. Stacks of chicken, tortillas, both red and green sauce and beans on the bottom. It was beautiful, I didn't wanna mess it up but I was dying to dig in. My daughter got a pizza..absolutely amazing! Our server Stephanie was pleasant and very nice! Great service  will definitely be back ;)",

I've only ever been to one other one in White Plains, New York, and I fell in love with it then and there and haven't stopped wanting to go to Yard Houses ever since. The beer selections are outstanding and obviously I love drinking it out of a faux yard stick or whatever that long thing is supposed to be (I'm going to assume a yard stick.)  I went with some cherry beer, and unlike a lot of beers that claim to be flavored but actually just taste like beer, this beer straight up tasted like cherries. That's what I love about Yard House (the last time I went to one, I got strawberry beer. Haven't been able to find that anywhere else since.)  The bartenders weren't very nice, but this met my high Yard House expectations. I didn't get food so I can't speak to that. Also if you're wondering why I haven't been to the new-ish one in DC yet, I HAVE NO IDEA. I probably will be shortly.",

Mixed drinks, I understand but to order a beer before appetizers and not get it until my entree on 2 separate occasions is pretty annoying. So, get that aspect together and it would be just as good as all the other locations around the valley.",

Hence you'll find sandwiches, burgers, pizza, Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese,  Korean, and Mexican dishes, heck ya, I'm just waiting for the arrival of Bratwurst and Sauerkraut. While that combination of items might sound strange, the chefs do mostly a more than decent job on putting your dish together.  Good selection of beer on tap, and happy hour.",

It's never going to be my first choice when going out to eat, but this one deserves five stars alone based on the level of service we received.  I was in town for a bachelorette weekend with a group of seven other girls and we decided to grab dinner at Yard House because it was right outside our hotel. Also, several of us had been to the location in Houston and we knew there would be something for everyone on their huge menu.  I wish I could remember our server's name but you know, Vegas is always kind of a blur. He was great - very friendly, attentive and got everyone's order right despite being busy. Our food came out quickly, especially for a large party. Like I mentioned earlier, the menu is vast. There is SO much to choose from and they list calories for every single option. I'm really glad they do this since not many places do - I actually think it should be a requirement for most restaurants but I digress. Anyway, I had the small ahi tuna salad and it was surprisingly delicious, and also really big. My friend got their Korean rib appetizer and really liked it, so it's worth mentioning that they can do fusion well. Everyone enjoyed their meals.",

The decor is very chic, they have great music playing and the staff are all very cheerful and polite. We all loved what we ordered too. I got the yardbird sandwich and we ordered Brussels sprouts and Mac & cheese for the table. Everything was delicious! My only criticisms would be that my coworker must have asked for straws 3 times before they showed up and the fries were pretty poorly crisped. Other than that, the sides were fantastic and the chicken on my sandwich was tender and juicy. Just don't expect the hot sauce to be even remotely spicy and you're good. Solid place in a convenient spot to the convention center.",

They have a large selection of beers to choose from and the night we went they also were doing craft cocktails. My friend ordered a whiskey sour which was delicious.   As far as the food goes, well it's a Yard House. The food is good, but basic. We mostly did appetizers. I think the cheese curds were very good. We also had the moo shu egg rolls. They were ok. The firecracker wings were also pretty good, but nothing spectacular. We had the vampire tacos which others in my party thought were amazing, but I was not impressed. I didn't finish mine.   I'm not saying it was bad...and if I was at home in California it might be somewhere I would eat lunch or go watch the game. In Vegas though you have tons of choices.... a little too average for me. If you are looking for an affordable meal in Vegas though, this place is reasonably priced and it's not bad.",

I had a half turkey club sandwich and a cup of French onion soup.  (Chris D. don't go out of your way for this soup).  The club was huge even for one half, but the soup was lacking flavor, and topped with a soggy piece of wonder bread.  My husband got the chicken avocado sandwich with truffle fries.  He was quite happy with his meal.  The bloody Mary's that we both had were amazing.  We came back the next day for a pre concert dinner.  We had the chicken egg rolls with a spicy peanut dipping sauce, and I had to go for my favorite ahi crunchy salad.  It was as good as ever.  That is one thing I like about Yard House, it is usually very consistent.    Our servers were very attentive, and well trained.  If I only had one thing to offer, it would be to kill the speakers on the outside patio.  The music from YH competes with the music coming from the Linq entertainment center. It can be very annoying to constantly be hearing two songs playing at the same time.",

Happy hour menu with almost 1/2 price appetizers are available Monday through Friday from 3:00p.m to 6:00p.m. The price is excellent where you can get a whole pizza for approximately $6.00 or $7.00.

Every single one of us had great food cooked to perfection.  We ended the meal with a blueberry banana crumble and peach apple crisp.  The desserts were unbelievably delicious!

After a turn on the High Roller, my husband and I decided to stop in at the Yard House located near the Linq for a glass of wine and some appetizers.  At the hostess station, we asked if we could have a seat by the window.  Gleefully the hostess said yes and guided us to a seat in the middle of the restaurant by a glass wall.  Hey bimbo!  A glass wall is NOT  a window!  I asked again to be seated by a window and she said they were all taken.  I asked about the upstairs patio....;.it was closed until six she said.  Okay - It is a BEAUTIFUL day in Vegas in the middle of winter (72 degrees)....OPEN THE PATIO!  So, we waited and waited at our table.......FINALLY a waitress came and took our order.  We had ample time to look at the menu while waiting, so we gave her our drink and food order.  Waiting, waiting, waiting.....twelve minutes later, we get the wine.  Waiting, waiting, waiting......32 minutes later, we get our food.  We ordered the Korean BBQ and Crab Cakes.  COLD.  COLD. COLD.    So disgusted, we just packed it up and left.    Great location, terrible staff, terrible service, bad management and cold food.  Don't think I will visit this location again.  So sad because all of the other Yard Houses' I have eaten at were just fine and dandy.    Eat somewhere else on the mall - skip this one.",

I arrived at the door and it was already filled to the brim in the restaurant and lots of people waiting at the door already. I was advised there would be about a 30 minute wait on a table but I could get a seat at the bar which I could still have a full meal without any wait at all. That sounded like a fantastic idea as it was already getting late and my stomach was grumbling.  Service by the bartenders was excellent and making sure myself and other patrons were taken care of. I came here specifically for the cobbler as read on many a review that it was one of places to visit for it. After eyeing off a few items off the menu there was another thing that stood out for me and it was the Lobster Mac N Cheese. If there was one way to make a mac n cheese more indulgent it was to add some lobster to it! It tasted wonderful and creamy. It had the right ratio of pasta to the cheese sauce. There were enough chunks of lobster to keep you happy. There was also asparagus, mushrooms, and sundries tomatoes in it. To drink I had a Passion Fruit Iced Tea. It wasn't too sweet and was constantly topped up for me. To finish I had Mini Peach Apple Cobbler. I couldn't think of anything better to finish off my meal. It was very fruity and had a great crumble topping. It was served with caramel ice cream. Yum!",

The food was delicious and I can't wait to go back again!  ************************************************************************************************ Okay went to the Yard House at Red Rock Casino and Hotel and just like the one by the strip it was AMAZING!!!!! This time we had a party well over 20 people and somehow our waiter was able to take all of our order, bring our drinks and food out in a timely manner, AND separate our checks accordingly. I've never had service like that before. I would definitely recommend both locations.",

It was cold and rock hard. Sent it back and we did get a new one. Waitress was great and very apologetic.  A group of 10 wanted to eat here, Wednesday 5/2. My steak was cold. I let the same manager know of the issue and now he gives me an attitude. Instead of cooking the steak over all they did was put the steak in the microwave to reheat it. I didnt send it back because I was hungry and everyone else had their meals and I didnt want everyone waiting for me. Some other plates in the group were cold but noone said anything else. When I brought it up to my server, they spoke with the manager. All he wanted to do was give us a dessert. For a party party of 10 with drinks all he could do was a dessert. I guess since it's on the strip THEY don't care about their CUSTOMERS!!!",

The food is so-so depending on what you order.  The service is so slow I could have driven home and cooked it myself.  It takes forever to get a drink and the music is so loud you can't hear each other.  Like I said the servers are friendly and nice.  My second visit I ordered a pastrami sandwich, it was by far the worst sandwich I've ever tried to eat. I sent it back and ordered something else which of course took another 1/2 hour. They definitely need to up their game.  Sorry, there are much better places to eat on the strip. M",

The service was very attentive, knowledgable, and were actually out to ensure you have a good experience. You can tell they're wonderful because the management is as well. I informed the host I had food allergies and the manager came right out to discuss all of my options. He even double checked with the kitchen on any small question I had. The server was just as careful, and had an entire conversation to learn more about food allergies. I ended up ordering a burger on a lettuce wrap and the meat itself was phenomenal. I am very picky with burgers, so that is saying a lot. The drinks are also amazing and 100% worth the price. I wish I could travel back to Vegas just to eat another meal!!",

The cool thing about this place is you can get a lot of options at a lot of price ranges. I had the shiitake garlic noodles, which were incredibly flavorful. My wife had the barbecue chicken pizza and French onion soup. The crust had a little essence of that beer flavor, which tasted great with the barbecue pizza sauce. They also had mini deserts that were just the right size after the meal. Service was very friendly and attentive. The location is nice as it has a good view of the high roller wheel from the second floor. They had lots of beer choices as you would expect, but we didn't get a chance to try them.

    "text": "There's pros and cons with this Yardhouse vs, Yardhouse in Townsquare (I've never been to the Yardhouse on the redrock side of town.)  Yardhouse at the Linq does not have a happy hour, I'm not sure if they have a reverse happy hour but didn't notice it on the menu.  The Pros: they have more beers on tap and the \"blackboard specials\" this is where we tried the Pugachev's cobra...man that was good stuff..strong, but good, one glass did the job.  Although there isn't any happy hour, there is plenty of seating, inside/outside/upstairs. This is listed as the world's largest Yardhouse.  I've been to this Yardhouse for dinner twice now, both on Friday nights and there was never a wait.  I've been to the Townsquare location and there has always been a wait.  Another con is the parking, of course I wouldn't recommend going to this Yardhouse unless you were already on the strip or planning to hang out at the Linq/Strip.  Having a group try to meet up on a Friday night on the strip was a hassle, I guess this would've been about the same if you were looking for parking at Townsquare also though.  Overall, I love Yardhouse! Great menu options for everyone, appetizers, small bites, vegan and vegetarian options available for all! *great for people watching and close to the High Roller",

It was very busy when we got there, but our server was great. She was helpful and answered all of our questions. We ordered our food and it arrived about 25 mins later, as I said it was very busy. All I have to say is that the wait was definitely worth it, the food was divine, as in I wanted to keep on eating, but I was just too full, ( why can't I have two stomachs !?! ) their portion sizes are big here, so you can share the main courses with your significant other and get a snack or appetizer and try something new along with your main meal. I would definitely come back here as they have a meat substitute section on the menu- so to all of my vegetarian friends out there, you too can have your very own soy chicken wings, should you so choose, I did not have them, but will be giving them a try when I come back. Give this place a try and you will not be disappointed, I know I wasn't!",

    "text": "We dined with friends and their children.  It's large, dark, and I can see how it would be loud--given the large screen TVs that are likely used during sports events. There were more families there while we were.  Our server was attentive.  Our friends' child did receive apple juice instead of orange juice (the waitress did repeat \"orange juice\" when it was ordered, so I know she took that order correctly), but the kiddo was a good sport about it and drank it because it was taking forever to flag the server down (we never did).  The menu itself has way too many choices that it's overwhelming when you first look at it.  I'd recommend not opening it if you are indecisive, because it will only give you a full blown panic attack. My husband was ecstatic with the beer selection and enjoyed his mac n' cheese because bacon.  He wasn't overly excited about the French Onion Soup--which is one of his favorite dishes and he frequently gets this at other restaurants, too.  I had asked the server about the street tacos.  I wasn't really interested in the entire meal, and asked if the \"ala carte\" designation meant the tacos (plural, quantity with the meal is 2 tacos) and just NOT the beans/rice, to which she agreed it was. Our conversation went like this when I asked for clarification after she recommended ala carte as a way to \"mix n match\" tacos since I wasn't sure which one I wanted: \"So ala carte is the taco portion without the rice and beans?\" \"Exactly!\" She didn't tell me it was really priced PER taco, and the menu isn't exactly clear.  I got the carnitas and fish tacos after asking for her recommendation and she listed all of them but two.  Unexpectedly, two tacos came (one of each), and were $8.40ish for BOTH.  Street tacos should never, EVER be this expensive.  And our server never returned so I could ask her for clarification  I just wrote it off and figured I'd Yelp about it, and hopefully warn others that the \"ala carte\" price of $4-$6 is PER taco.  Still ridiculous.  I will be fair and say they were OK tacos, but certainly not worth $4 each.  In all honesty, I can't review the other food.",

Though there are plenty of lunch specials to choose from, we each chose items off the regular menu instead. I had a large serving of the chicken and bacon mac & cheese and my hubby got a bbq chicken pizza. My pasta was delicious... plenty of chicken, bacon, and mushrooms mixed into the creamy and cheesy spiral macaroni noodles. My husband stated that his pizza had a great flavor and the perfect amount of sauce.   We had a $45 gift card, and after tax and tip, we used the entire balance plus gave another $2. This may sound a bit expensive for two lunches with iced tea, but had we ordered the lunch specials it would have been much less. I think this is a fair price to pay if we actually had our same meal at dinner time.   I will definitely return to Yard House whether it be in Vegas or another city... until St. Louis finally gets on board. (hint, hint)",

It started upon entrance when we told one of the 3 hosts we wanted a table at the bar and she said animals weren't allowed in the restaurant,  reluctantly she pointed us toward the bar which was around the corner and down the hall.  We sat down at a booth and a bitchy waitress came over and told us we needed to see the hostess and couldn't sit there, and animals weren't allowed in the restaurant.  We explained we just talked to the hostess and she told us it was open seating, the bitchy waitress rolled her eyes and walked away.  Then the manager came over and told me my service animal which is a 3.8 pound dog couldn't sit in the booth with me and had to be on the floor.  The same bitchy waitress then came back to take our drink order, 10 minutes after she took the order we still hadn't received our drinks.  We got up and left, won't be coming back.  It seems like the biggest issue was my service animal I guess yard house doesn't want people with disabilities dining in their restaurants.",

It comes with fries but I upgraded to sweet potato fries. You can also get truffle fries. Yumm!   The service was excellent. Our waitress, Lisa, was personable and attentive.

Yard House usually does a good job of mixing standard craft beer offerings with harder to find, local stuff.   Well... I was a big fan until I came here.  Unfortunately, the beer selection at this location was lacking. They only had one or two local IPAs on tap and most beer on offer was from companies purchased by In Bev. True shame but what are you going to do? Yard House still offers a solid selection of beer for the strip.. AND you can bring the beer to go. This in itself is awesome and makes the place worthy of a visit.   The menu was the same as all the other Yard Houses across the country. The food wasn't overpriced for being on the strip but it certainly isn't worth a trek either. I would come here to get a beer to go, but nothing more.",

The location is great for some good old people watching and also reasonably priced food and drinks for being on the strip.   On my most recent visit my boo and I shared the lobster, crab & artichoke dip along with the truffle burger. The dip was good, but definitely not proportionate to the chips and flatbread provided. As for the burger I loved it. It was cooked perfectly and I loved the unique flavor. It was just the right amount for both of us to share too. Oh and of course I can't forget their beer selection, tons on tap and three sizing options. My personal favorite was their grapefruit sandy, great for any citrus fans like me.",

We had the bar menu appetizer of a spring roll St. Patrick's style, it was basically a cheese egg roll with corned beef essence since there was next to no meat and to make even more saddening the Manager came out and said they took so long because they ran out of ingredients to make them, so in basic terms we got what they could throw together. One of us has the roasted turkey sandwich, can't mess that up right? Wrong, I felt bad as I just watched my friend attempt to eat it to appease me. Another had the Reuben sandwich and did better at convincing me they liked it by eating only the fries and asking for a box for the Reuben. My other guest has the carne asada tacos with beans and rice, which would be better named gristle and fat tacos with bland crunchy rice & almost redeemingly good beans. Lastly, my meal was the Vegan burger and I had high hopes that they could deliver because it contains no meat which they had no problem doing with the other meals but I was wrong. The Vegan burger had no flavor to be found anywhere and the only thing good about it was the salad with balsamic dressing it came with. The desserts were great though, the bread pudding and dessert trio were tasty and warm & fresh and to the eye pleasing. But for over $100 I feel ripped off and don't recommend eating here. Better odds at In n Out Burger across the way.",

    "text": "The last night I was in Vegas my friends and I spent several hours shopping. By about 9:00pm it had been a long time since any of us had eaten, and we were getting very hangry. We were struggling to decide on a restaurant, and ended up going to Yard House by default: there was no line or wait, and it was right in front of us. I don't think I would have chosen it otherwise as I try to avoid chains. It's basically a slightly more upscale bar. They carry about a million (okay, honestly like 50?) beers on tap, and their bar is basically the whole centerpiece of the space. The food style is pretty much your basic American, maybe leaning a bit toward comfort food/(not fancy) steakhouse.  When we entered we were immediately greeted by the hostess, and brought to a pub table. Not my favorite, but we weren't going to complain, we just needed to eat. They were also surprisingly super busy, and there weren't any booths (my preference) open anyways. Within a few minutes a waiter came by and took our drink order, returning shortly thereafter for our food choices. We went with the following:  Cheeseburger and truffle fries-I didn't try the cheeseburger (my friend loved it), but they were very generous with the fries, which were thin, crispy, hot, and DELICIOUS. Steak Salad-My friend ordered this and did not care for it. She felt like the steak was chewy, not a quality cut or cooked well, and that the salad was very oily. It did seem like it was drenched in dressing. The various vegetables and toppings were colorful and appealing, so if you are interested in trying this maybe dressing on the side is the way to go? Blue Crab Cakes-Featured two small-ish crab cakes, the cakes themselves almost completely crab, but then breaded and fried. I've never had crab cakes this way, but I was into it. The passionfruit sauce and tropical fruit salsa both complimented the crab perfectly. Kale Caesar Salad-They offer a plain Caesar, and this one, which is maybe a dollar more. I expected it to consist of kale entirely, but it was maybe 2/3 romaine and 1/3 kale. Still, a nice basic salad. Not too much dressing, and I really liked the larger shavings of parmesan. I ordered the smaller size, and along with the crab cakes it was a well portioned dinner.  Prices, especially for Vegas, were decent at around $12-$20ish for entrees. Our server was a bit odd, but not unfriendly. He checked on us often, so no complaints. This wasn't the best meal ever, but it was surprisingly good, and I'd visit again, although probably wouldn't go out of my way for it.",

The one I will say is that the customer service is great. The servers are very attentive and accommodating. The food comes out pretty quick and the drinks are really good. I ate outside on the balcony and it was pretty cool to people watch and eat. The temp was around 75 so it wasn't crazy hot.   I have not had a bad item on the menu at all. I recommend if you are with a group to order many dishes and share.   This is the perfect combination of great service, great pricing, and great food.   Pros -  Location, price, drinks, food choices, atmosphere, staff  Cons -  Parking",

Add a star if you're being reimbursed... it's great for business lunches/dinners since it has vegetarian and vegan options, and the prices help ensure people don't come in just to get wasted.   (And the food is decent enough and the venue while not silent is quiet enough that if someone doesn't drink they will still have a decent time)   Overall, a solid known good choice, but the prices on food are a little high.",

Tuna roll was with fresh raw tuna, crispy soja beans, a bit of coriander etc , home made soy sauce .  All in in all Yardhouse is a very  place to go to  Last but not least pricing is low Las Vegas so reasonable/affordable and a very nice ambiance",

    "text": "OK, this was one of those nights where we had no idea where we were going to eat.  So we were walking up and down Linq Place ... with one restaurant after another ... checking out the menus.  We decided on Yard House.  It was packed and we had to wait about 10 minutes.  When our table was ready we didn't realize how big this place is.  It's huge.  While it calls itself an American Restaurant (sports Pub) it's menu is across the board.  They had Hamburgers, Regular Dinners and Asian items on the menu.  My daughter wrote in her Yelp review that she would not come back to this place ... she was not satisfied with the Lobster dip.  I read that while we were waiting for our table.  But also read reviews from a couple of other people I actually know and they seemed to enjoy it.  So we gave it a try.  While it looks like a Beer/Pub kinda of place, it had a specialty drink menu ... I opted for the Pomegranite Martini ... a little on the sweet side .. but it was good.  I also stepped out of the box and order the Poke Bowl ... and was I surprised.  It was one of the best I every had.  It was served on a flat plate and instead of a bowl full of rice, they had a formed rice patty under the tuna.  The tuna ... the key ingredient ... was good.  Also on the plate was cucumbers, tomatoes, seaweed salad and I asked that they not add nori .  I'd definitely order it again.  Someone ordered Hawaiian Chicken she said was delicious as well.  Definitely would go again ... as long as it's not a \"game night.\"  LOL   I'm not a sports enthusiast of any kind.",

    "text": "A few years back we came here for dinner while exploring the Linq Promenade for the first time and it was one of those perfect experiences that you want every meal to be like. We had great service on their outdoor, rooftop patio while a guy played acoustic guitar down at street level. Every year when we go to Vegas we hope to replicate that wonderful evening but it's yet to happen.  Don't get me wrong, we still love Yard House. The menu has options for everyone and I appreciate the calorie counts prominently listed to steer me away from all of those items that exceed your daily recommended intake of calories. But the patio is open sparingly (lame) and the inside of the restaurant can be so much more difficult to have a conversation unless you use your New Jersey voice and ain't nobody got time for that!  If you find yourself here, ask for the rooftop patio (maybe if enough people complain, they'll open it more often) and try the pizzas, they are one of the best values in both calories and price.",

We ordered speciality cocktails, beer and some appetizers.  Highlights- the magic margarita is such a fun table-activity -- it really does change color. It's also potent! Very tequilla forward. The large size beers are fun! The queso was served with both chips and soft taco shells. Very good. The lettuce wraps were a huge hit. We also enjoyed a plate of the moo shu egg rolls.   Our server kept our water full and had the checks to us, separated, quickly so that we could enjoy our drinks and food then run to our next destination.",

For appetizer you can order al a carte or entree I think comes with (3) and then rice/beans. We did 1 taco each and had the boneless wings. They were crispy and had a nice kick to them.   For my entree I had a burger which I could barely finish. It was also cooked to order which was great. My boyfriend did the Cuban roast prok dip and LOVED it. He said it was one of the best ones he's had. Both came with a side that I chose to do garlic fries and he did truffle fries. Both were sooo addicting lol.   Definitely suggest to stop by here! It's in the LINQ Promenade so it's a little strip of bars/restaurants which is fun. Right next door is the entrance to the High Roller (approx $47 for the 30min ferris wheel with open bar!)",

I got the poke bowl, it was spinach based which I wasn't ready for, so I got a side of rice with it. I did throw up a few hours after eating it. Could've been from drinking beers at the pool, or my stomach not liking the food. I don't think the stomach upset was from the food though. I do have some weird allergies and the servers were on top of it immediately, checking every source to make sure I wouldn't have a reaction. Which was great service if you ask me. They went above and beyond.  I'd go here again, and recommend it to a friend. My only suggestions are don't go after drinking all day, it's not cheap and you won't enjoy the food as much.",

    "text": "I have eaten here a few times (The Linq location) and have never had a bad experience. The food is good and the drinks were strong which is just how I like them.   Today I ordered the Skirt Steak Arrachera (Sorry about the rice, I was starving and took a bite before taking a pic) and added the Mixed Greens salad on the side. The steak was prepared correctly and was medium as requested. The sides that come with it were tasty as well and were fitting for the overall meal. It is rice and then the steak is laid on street corn with some tortillas on the side. The salad is really good for a basic side. It's refreshing and is quite large for a side salad.   I've also tried the Jambalaya which was delicious, but kind of spicy so if you don't like heat don't get it. I've also had the Lobster and Shrimp Agnolotti which is great if you want a seafood fix and not a huge amount of food.   The reason I am not giving 5 stars is for atmosphere. The restaurant itself is nice and I was seated in a patio like area which is surrounded by glass. It's like you're outside without actually being outside and can people watch which is cool. The problem is that it was freezing in there to the point where I had goosebumps all over my arms and was rubbing them trying to get warm. I'm not sure if the air conditioning was up really high because they were expecting it to be warmer outside because it's March but they should have adjusted it to a more comfortable temperature because I was cold the entire time.",

I am  not usually a big fan of sports bars but I see myself coming back again to this location.   Food Highlight for me was the Appetizer: Wisconsin Fried Cheese Curd. I am not a cheese person but it was surprisingly good.  For my entree I ordered the Miso Glazed Sea Bass. It was pretty good as well for being an American Sports bar. Dessert Highlight was the Mini Trio Sampler which you can try the Cheesecake brulee, peach apple cobbler, and chocolate souffle cake. Now I am a fan of their dessert. Everything was amazing. If you cannot make up your mind on what to try for dessert then just get the mini trio sampler.  I would come back here again and try their happy hour.",

There are a ton of tables, a huge bar area, and a fantastic craft beer menu. If you are a craft beer fan, you won't beat the selection here anywhere else in Vegas. They also have a great bar food menu with a variety of options. I will say that I felt that the food at the Miami and Chicago locations was a bit better than here. Perhaps a quality control issue but I was less impressed with the food here. Steak sandwich and fries were very greasy and the nachos were just ok. Certainly better food in Vegas BUT if it's beer and sports viewing you are after, this is your place.",

We got here a little after opening on a Tuesday and were given the choice of indoor seating or outdoors either on their downstairs covered patio or uncovered patio upstairs. We almost chose the covered patio but the tables there looked better suited for having drinks rather than full meals. Sitting upstairs was out of the question since it was over 100 degrees that day! So inside we sat which was fine as most of their seating is booth seating, which I prefer. Very spacious booths at that :)  Our server if I recall correctly was Rosa. She provided awesome customer service - friendly, courteous, and attentive. I got my usual - small (but filling) portion of Mac and cheese without chicken. Delicious! I had a couple bites of my dining companion's ahi tuna salad and it was quite good! We had to end our meal with their salted caramel butterscotch pudding. It's soooo good we each got our own this time. Very reminiscent of the shakes at Gordon Ramsay Burgr which are topped with the most delicious butterscotch pudding.  Excellent meal, awesome service, comfy booth seating, nice ambiance - quiet since it was just after opening on a Tuesday but plenty to keep myself entertained. They've got plenty of tv's of course, and we were seated by windows looking out to The Linq so there was people-watching for my entertainment. I really like the layout of this location too - booth seating surrounding a long bar in the middle of the restaurant.  To sum it up, Yard House, you're (more than) all right with me :)",

But the Vegas location was such a treat! The restaurant is casual attire but it had a sophisticated, classy feel. We took an elevator to get to the top floor and passed by the outdoor patio and peep-through kitchen.  Our server Ron was sweet and attentive.  For food, I had the calamari, clam chowder and a cesar salad...all very good and made my initial thoughts of Yard House having bad food go away. But no matter the location, Yard House has great drinks in addition to their extensive beer menu.  My favorites were the moscow mule and the sparkling raspberry cocktail made with my favorite beer: framboise.  We enjoyed it so much that not only did we eat there a second time on our trip, we have decided to make it a tradition on all of our Vegas trips from then on. My only complaint was that there were no restrooms at all upstairs.",

It came with spicy rice and beans.  It liked small but  to be honest, it was a perfect sized portion for that late in the evening.  It was fresh and very tasty.  My partner had a burger with shoestring fries.  He liked it but he only ate half because he was not too hungry.  He asked for the burger with cheese and pickles only, and they mistakenly added garlic aioli.  He tries it and he say it was fine.    At the end of the meal, the extremely nice waiter said he will buy us dessert because if the mistake.  It was but necessary but very nice.   The meal was very good and we recommend it to anyone because of  the large menu, delicious food and the great service.",

The bartender working the bar on August 14, 2016 at about 9:05pm was completely rude. Our whole trip here in Las Vegas was amazing. We definitely regret stopping by the yard house outside bar in the alley between the linq and flamingo.  If you, as a worker have no tolerance for people visiting the strip or a certain amount of people you do not need to be working with people directly. The manager came out and automatically came off rude just like her employee. Never have we ever felt disrespected by any bar before and the employee at the yard was the first EVER. She made the mistake and miscounted the amount of people drinking and asked us once again for our ID's. Twice. Then she gets on the walky talky to call the manager, who didn't even help the situation. We decided to walk away because we will not tolerate being mistreated in any way. Instead we walked right over to the AMERICAN. The gentleman there was great.",

Here we had the artichoke (2 stars), homemade potato chips (3 stars, which is good cuz I usually don't like those things), and wings (3.5 stars).  Beer selection is very good, if a little predictable.  Atmosphere is cool. It's in the Linq. We had 3 tvs devoted to our football game, which was definitely not a top 25 matchup.  Service sucks. Slow. Never checked in for refills/new beers. Literally scowled at our 3 year old for standing within 2 feet of the servers bar. Honestly, I would excuse all this if they were busy, but the whole place was only about 1/3 full! You're professional servers on Las Vegas Blvd! Get it together! Did I mention prices are a lil high (avg for the Linq)? Overall, I'll avoid this place.",

    "text": "Now, this is a chain and we typically avoid chains when we are visiting somewhere new. That said, Vegas can get exhausting and going to a place like this was just the break we needed. It's on this little \"strip off of the strip\" area behind the Linq which has some other nice places (check out my review of Sprinkles). I loved this little area because it was much calmer than the main strip but still active. Apparently it is just out of the way enough that the obnoxious drunks wander past.  We had the grilled cheese and tomato bisque combo and the street tacos.  All of the street tacos are great. Very fresh and light and they hit the spot. My girlfriend was making a face while she ate the grilled cheese that I wish she made when we did \"other things\" together. Moving on...  We sat at the bar which we tend to do in most places. If you're visiting Vegas or anywhere that is busy, make sure you check the bar if you have a small party (no kids). We skipped a pretty big line by going to the bar here and the same thing at the Hash House a Go Go.  You also have your server right there whenever you need something. In the case of the Yard House, we had three very attentive and pleasant bartenders that took great care of us.   The beer list is expansive, great atmosphere which is just \"clubby\" enough to keep the Vegas momentum but it wasn't annoying.  All in all, a good choice.",

There were lots of inebriated people around too which didn't help the overall noise pollution up in this place.  It's a typical Yard House chain as far as food and drinks.  Think slightly upscale sports bar and that's what you get.  We had the fried cheese curds and they were OK.  My man and I wanted to split a salad and the salmon dish, but it was so loud the waitress thought we said salmon salad, so that was a bit disappointing.  She did however apologize and offer to make us the dish; but it was getting late and I was hangry - so we just ate what we had.  No one else was blown away by their food either.  Don't get me wrong, it was OK, but felt like I could get it anywhere in town.  It's just a bar with a bit better than bar food.  The service overall was really good however and this is the reason I'll give it 3 stars instead of 2.  Would I go back if I was in town? Probably not, since I know of much better spots to go",

The burger was packed full (overstuffed) with goodness, possibly if they had less ingredients it would be just as good I'm sure. The onion rings blew me away, probably the best I've ever had, definitely try those. For dessert I had the apple and peach cobbler and it was scrumptious! It was like a smaller version of the Blue Martini's apple tart a la mode. I will definitely visit Yard house again! Our waiter was quite courteous as well, the customer service was certainly an A+. I recommend trying out the apple and peach cobbler here first then on another day getting the apple tart a la mode at BM. Prepare yourself, the apple tart a la mode is the best dessert that exists ever! Oh and it is pretty big!",

We like the eat at the bar and ordered what we consider to be pretty easy items to make. 1. Chicken Nachos- the chicken was not warm . Not appetizing biting into cold chicken with melted cheese and warm chips. We asked to have warmed  but it still came back cool.   Next day we ordered pizza and a salad. The pizza was lacking toppings-  cheese and sauce along with the mushroom and pepperoni.   The Ranch Salad was a very nice portion size for sharing however it didn't taste like any ranch salad dressing I have ever tasted. It literally had no taste.   Both instances the managers did not seem to be too concerned with our issues.   I gave 2 stars because the beer selection is great and the service on one visit was pretty good. The other visit the service was so so.",

I ordered the Grilled Cheese and Tomato Bisque and added avocado!   The drink selection was impressive. Everyone in your group is bound to find something they like. They had a ton of beer selections and they offered smaller sizes so you could try a beer before ordering a full pint.",

According to him, the korean tacos were nothing short of amazing.    I begrudgingly ordered the margarita pizza knowing they didn't have buffalo mozz, but their combination of roma tomatoes, basil and garlic made for a surprisingly good pie at an excellent price.  I know it's a chain, and there are 'better' places to eat in Vegas, but I wouldn't be mad if I ended up at yardhouse again!",

    "text": "Beer Mecca & Food Oasis - GO NOW!!  I could spend my entire dining and drinking experience here at this restaurant.  Las Vegas is not a place you go for beer. The usual taps consist of your traditional watered down american beers. EXCEPT Yard House. The selection of beer here is so massive, it's almost overwhelming, but the bartenders are extremely friendly. I easily struck up a conversation with several of them and they walked me through all of what I was looking for in a beer choice.   Their menu is equally impressive with a little bit of everything for everyone. The selection spans across several cuisines from around the world with a good helping of traditional american fare. Because it was a hot day at the end of our trip, we both ended up getting a salad, but it was hearty enough to feel like a real meal.   The price is right, the food is great, the taps are expansive. There's no reason not to go. Highly recommended.",

Highly recommend the Poke Nachos and Parmesan Crusted Pork Loin.  Lobster Mac N Cheese was good too with a whole lobster tail of meat.  It just wasn't my style of cooking mac and cheese.  Had enough leftover for another meal.",

I love the location of the Yardhouse at the end of the Linc street mall.  You can wait for a table here but I have either come in slightly off of peak or eaten at the bar.  They have a superior beer and cocktail selection.  They have TVs everywhere tuned to different games. They have a great menu with good options for carnivores to vegans.  They have nice entrees (had the salmon this time) lots of burger and sandwich selections (had those in the past) and plenty of appetizers to choose from.  Did I mention they have great beer and cocktails and TVs with sports on everywhere??!  Prices are typical, service is solid and value is delivered.  Want a sports bar ... there are two in this area, Yardhouse and Tilted Kilt, and I give the nod to Yardhouse for the food and drink.  I think my hotel location will change for the trade show visit I make every year...  If so, it wont be in this area ...but I may still find myself on the Linc street mall and in the Yardhouse one night.  Thanks for being so reliable Yardhouse.  See you soon.",

However the gluten free menu is pretty small, I got the chicken sandwich as a lettuce wrap and they let me sub veggies for the fries. I wish they offered gf buns. The steamed veggies didn't seem steamed at all, they were very crunchy and almost raw...not flavorful, didn't seem fresh at all. I did enjoy my cocktail jingerber something...it was strawberry and cucumber infused gin! On point The restaurant is very dark and loud and our booth was so big we couldn't really talk to the people across from us. Our waitress was good but service was on the slow side, had to wait along time for our check. Overall this is definitely a good place for a drink but I would try somewhere else for dinner.",

What made it extra nice was that across from the patio, some guy sang while playing the guitar, and he wasn't bad either! It's located at the strip of The Linq hotel, where the High Roller is. It's a nice little strip when you're there at night, very lively!                                                                                  We ordered:  Ceviche - loved it but I feel the portions are too small for the price  Traditional chicken wings - asked for all the sauces on the side so I can try and they were, the jerk one was the best  Albacore Tuna Steak - loved this! Wish they gave a little more lol  And some black bean pasta from the apps category - it was bland.   And entrees were:  Penne Chicken Pasta - this was a \"house favorite\"..it was alright. Wasn't too flavor. The portion was big, I couldn't finish, but then again we ordered a lot of apps  16oz? Steak - I tried some of this and it was super good! The meat was tender and juicy mmmmm!  Total bill came out to about $86.   I like the Yard House, just wish it wasn't too expensive. It's like the Nordstrom while BJ's is the Macy's, hahah!",

Everyone at the table loved their food (except my brother who is 11 and was sick, so he hardly counts)  We started off with the truffle fries which were to die for and then were gone in a few seconds. :) For dinner I got the coconut shrimp and the spicy tuna roll because they were on the appetizer menu and I assumed that they would be small portions. Instead they were massive and I couldn't even finish them all. They were amazing and I would suggest them to anyone. It was classic flashy Vegas food :) I loved every bite.   It was a little bit loud, but it's Vegas so it wasn't like I didn't expect it and there was a slightly long wait to get in which was just frustrating.   The staff were nice for the most part and very accommodating. Overall it was a positive experience.  Make time for the Yard House!",

They will also bring you a tasting sample if you want to try something. We all had or tasted the pineapple, pear, and raspberry ciders and agreed the raspberry was probably the best of the three.   Quite a few people got the fish tacos and liked them. I ordered the Korean taco and a carna asada taco. The Korean one was very good. I would not recommend the steak one it was merely okay.   The highlight of my meal was the side of Brussels sprouts and potatoes. If you like Brussels sprouts this is a must try. I will go back just for this dish.",

    "text": "Sadly, I think we should have read more of the reviews before we chose to eat here tonight. The main good point about this place is the view onto the Linq (High Roller) promenade. The food is just average and that's being polite. My husband ordered a craft beer and at $9.25,  for 6 ounces, it came with too much of a head. My husband mentioned this to the waitstaff and one of the bartenders came by and my husband explained that a similar beer in Ireland has the head removed and then topped off again. My husband ordered the lobster garlic noodles with a French onion soup as a starter. He said the soup was OK. The noodle dish was tasty but the plate it was served on was cold. I ordered a Margherita  pizza and a classic Caesar salad. The salad was fine, just average, and met expectations. The pizza Arrived on it's metal pan barely lukewarm. When the waitress arrived to check on us I showed that to her and she took it back and said that they would make a totally new one for us. It came in about 10 minutes. It was, speaking charitably, just adequate.   The waitstaff was continually friendly and frequently checked on us -- so they get kudos for that. What we really enjoyed was sitting right on a covered patio adjacent to the Linq promenade. It was fun to watch the parade of people. That's the best part of this Yard House. And I would say it's the only reason to go. Well, we did it once but we would not go back nor would I recommend it.",

    "text": "This was my first time at the Yardhouse.  Woke up in the morning and didn't get any breakfast, but opted for an earlier lunch.  We took a look at the menu outside and noticed the place wasn't too busy yet so we decided to take a seat. (P.S. they have specialty beers)  MENU:  AWESOME!  The Menu had such a great selection for my pallette.  So many choices, but I went for one of my favorites, the BBQ Cheddar Burger.  Dude, this was the BEST burger I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  There was NOTHING wrong.  Flavors were perfectly balanced!  So good!  PRICE:  Good.  The prices were right where I expected.  Lunch for two was around $45, with a specialty beer.    SERVICE:  GREAT!  This was a HUGE winner for us.  We were greeted by a manager in training and the lady training.  She did a great job at letting the trainee have full control.  The trainee was honest and had been in the industry before, which was totally fine!  We asked him questions that, in my opinion, most trainees would stutter around.  We also had him make the choice of which meal my wife was going to eat, and which beer I was going to drink.  PERFECT CHOICES!  The guy did a GREAT job and I think him becoming a manager is an EXCELLENT business choice!  BOTTOM LINE:  Incredible.  Personally, I was blown away by this experience.  It was simply incredible and we will be eating there next time we are in town!",

Well, maybe they do but when I called an hour before arrival they were unable to put our name in for the quoted 30-40 minute wait. But luckily when we arrived we didn't have to wait for a table when coming in for a late dinner. I had a delicious turkey burger with sweet potato fries and they both really hit the spot. I washed that down with a couple pints of Guinness and it was a great meal! Our server Zachary was excellent, super knowledgeable and friendly. Another great experience at Yard House.",

The Vampire Taco lit up my world. My Lobster Noodles were so good I couldn't decide if I liked the noodles better or the shrimp and lobster. Absolutely wonderful meal.

I recently decided to take my boyfriend to lunch here as I remember the food being really good. Unfortunately, it went horribly wrong. When we sat down I noticed the menu was completely different. Also the table was sticky like it hadn't been cleaned. We were both starving so we decided to get something simple. I got the chicken tacos, and he ordered the turkey club and a Cesar salad. There were some red flags and we should have left, but again, we were starving and needed to eat. When the food came there was a hair on his plate and the salad was wilted. Also, my chicken was dry like it might have been sitting out. We decided to eat what we could but half way through the meal we looked at the turkey sandwich and noticed it looked almost raw on the inside or like some of the fat was still on it. It was clear, jelly consistency and disgusting. After that we completely lost our appetites and were ready to leave. Long story short, we both had FOOD POISONING. Throwing up and all the other stuff that comes with it all night long. So yes, this place sucks!",

I ended up here to have late night dinner after drinking and walking around with friends. Anyways their menu has a huge selection and I went in for the \"late night menu\" starts from 10pm till 2. To start as an appetizer I ordered onion ring tower (these were soo good you must try them!) for my entree I ordered the Black truffle cheeseburger (7.95) medium well, & it was delicious! Super flavorful meat well seasoned and juicy!  Along with that I ordered a side of truffle fries (4.25) the fries I'll give it 3 stars it was too salty! :( other than that everything else was bomb.

    "text": "GREAT happy hour, for locals and tourists alike!   If you are on the Strip near The Linq, I suggest you make your way to the Yard House. Good food, good beer, and great prices. Although this is a chain restaurant, it's one of the better ones. And this location should be on the top of their national list.  Our friend Betty was visiting from Texas, and we all took a ride on the High Roller. (Great deal if you get a pre-6 p.m. rate w/drink on Living Social.) Next up was happy hour at the Yard House, in the shadow of the mighty Roller. They have drink specials and half-price appetizers from 3 to 6. Timing was great (although I planned this attack in advance, because I knew what they had to offer...).  We split three apps -- Hawaiian poke stack, spinach cheese dip, and pepperoni & mushroom pizza -- and we each had a few craft beers (mostly white ales and IPAs). Food was good -- not great -- but you can't beat that quality at half-price. And if you like beer and can't find one you like on this extensive menu, that's on you. (They offer samples in case you're curious, but don't treat it as a free for all, or we'll all suffer!)  I have to mention the exceptional service we had. We sat on the upper patio amid a shift change, which could have been disastrous. Instead, we had three waitresses who were friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about their menu -- which, sadly, should be a prerequisite to being a server but usually isn't. Kudos to the staff here!  I've been to other Yard House restaurants, but this has to be my favorite. What a fantastic location! And while it can be pricey during \"normal\" hours, the happy-hour rate is hard to beat. Overall, I can't think of a better place for happy hour on the Strip than the Yard House. (If you know of something better, let me know!)",

My husband loved the quinoa salad and I gobbled up the ahi tuna sandwich. I wish I could remember our server's name because I would love to give him a shout out! Took photos of us like a pro and I can't imagine how many he has to take every day. Warm, attentive and knowledgeable- what more could you want?

    "text": "A FIVE STAR REVIEW WITH ISSUES*  Requested a patio seat for one. Host quoted 15-25 minutes. Totally cool with that, they are always slammed and this was no exception. Got my buzzer, I anticipated a long wait as the patio is an extremely popular spot. The temperature and atmosphere makes the wait always worth it. 50 minutes go by and no buzzing on my Yard House hockey puck (I'm always forgiving on wait times). I ask the host, \"Hey, just wanted to make sure I'm still on the list... after flipping through 3 full pages of check ins.. \"oh, I called you (buzzed you) awhile ago...! Ok, I guess my ass is numb I'm thinking to myself. Fortunately, a bad ass manager is nearby (Jeff) who curiously and politely interrupts the host and gets me seated immediately! Thanks Jeff!  I feel bad as I'm seated at a 4 top, but business levels are slowing down and there only a few 2 tops on the lower patio, soooo my guilt fades.   Had my beer ready to order as I had about an hour to think about it. Server Kathryn took care of me promptly with water to start and my beer quick to follow. Order the shitake mushroom and garlic noodles to start under the \"snack\" portion of the menu. I get these almost every time I come here. Large enough portion to fill up on if you're enjoying beer, no jokes. After the noodle heaven I order the Beer Batter Fish and Chips for the first time. Again, promptly delivered with beer battered fries and a jalapeno tarter and an aoli (I forget the name, but it's delicious). The sauce sides are small so I immediately knew I would need additional tarter. The food runner (Kevin) asked if there was anything additional he could provide me. I quickly asked him if could get an additional tarter sauce from him and he politely ablidged! Thanks young man!   After my first bite of fries I noticed they were cold and slightly stale. It also looked like I received the bottom of the barrel with most of the handful of fries being less than 2 inches long. Tough to grab, eat or dip. All good though, Server Kathryn checked in immediately and got me some fresh fries right away (although not beer bettered). No worries. They were hot and delicious!  Although they were some issues this evening (out of the norm) you completely redeemed yourself.   Every place makes mistakes or errors. It's the genuine service recovery and effort that makes the biggest difference. You turned what could have been an abisimal , uncharacteristic experience into a phenomenal one. You deserve to be appriciated!!  SO...THANK YOU!!!!- JEFF, KATHRYN, AND KEVIN.  I'll be back....  Jacob-Out",

I had no idea it was a franchise but this restaurant is so delicious. Everything was amazing and the staff was super friendly.   Food: There are SO MANY OPTIONS. The menu is huge so it was hard to choose but luckily there were 5 of us so we got to try a variety of dishes.   Chicken Tortilla Soup: super flavorful!   Shiitake Mushroom Garlic Noodles: There was no meat on the dish but it didn't lack anything! It's on the snacks menu but for my small appetite it was perfectly. It was buttery and delicious!   Pineapple Chicken: There was so much chicken on this dish so I was expecting it to be dry but it was decently moist and the pineapple sauce it came with was very complementary. But the fried rice it came with was OMG so good. It looked like a normal fried rice but it was seriously the highlight.   Miso Glazed Sea Bass: The fish was so flaky and it came with a bunch of brown rice and vegetables.   Overall, it was such a good experience. I'm salivating just thinking about how good this meal was.",

The food menu has a ton of options but we kept it simple & went with sandwiches. I had the grilled cheese with truffle fries instead of the tomato soup it comes with. The sandwich was perfectly melted and had some tomato on it. Good but nothing special. The truffle fries were fabulous!! A lot of truffle flavor....didn't want to quit eating them. My husband had the turkey & bacon melt 2.0. He really loved it. It had nice thick carved slices of turkey, cheese, bacon, roasted tomatoes, & jalapeno spread. Not very spicy. Delicious.   The beer list is extensive. A paradise for beer lovers. We would definitely go back.",

Sat at the bar and was ignored by 6 different bartenders. The mostly male bartenders were making lots of inappropriate comments about female patrons. Gross! A few female waitresses were complaining about customers...one even said, \"I fucking hate that bitch.\" Nothing says \"comfortable\" or \"a good time\" like sexual harassment and complaining. Nothing could save this visit...poke nachos were all nachos and no poke. We order this all the time, and this location skimped on the portion of tuna.   I gave this place 2 stars because we love our local Yard House and liked our experience other times we have come to this location. We might give this one more chance. I don't want this location to sully my typical fun time at Yard House. With so many options in Vegas, this location needs to step up their game and retrain their wait staff. It is inexcusable for bartenders to walk by and ignore guests. One guy in particular is awful. My husband asked to close out our bill, and the guy grabs the receipt from a glass and waves it in front of his face. Maybe we were supposed to hop over the bar and process our credit cards ourselves.",

It's a nice big open restaurant surrounding a bar. Our server quickly greeted us and got our drinks. I ordered a single Bloody Mary(they do have unlimited for $15)--it was decent, not the best, very thick and tomatoey which I like, not the strongest alcohol wise but it was 10am. I ordered the skirt steak and my friend ordered the French toast. His was really good, mine was pretty good, steak was a little fatty but didn't ruin the dish. Once we got our food, our server went MIA. He never came back to ask how our food was or if we needed anything. He did refill our waters which was nice. I'm not sure if he was just really busy or what, but I ended up going up to the bar to get ketchup for my potatoes because everything else on my plate was gone. It was also my friends birthday and they gave him a free chocolate souffle which he loved. Overall decent food, awesome atmosphere, and alright service.",

You're right next to the High Roller. The best seats are on the patio upstairs. You're surrounded by locals and tourists enjoying a night out on the town. You can hear loud music being played directly in front of the restaurant and I haven't heard a bad performer yet. The restaurant does tend to be loud however this matches the atmosphere of the restaurant.   On this visit I was at the bar and I was served by Kelsee T, who was on it!  The wait staff have always been pleasant and helpful. The menu is long and broad: from jambalaya to pizza you'll never leave hungry. The menu is so long that it does take quite some time to decide. The portions are huge. The food isn't amazing, but it's good, I had the Ahi Poke Nachos (B), and the Boneless Buffalo Wings (B).  However, the beer selection is amazing.  Cheers.",

The burger itself was decent, and I like that there was an effort to make an interesting vegan burger. There were lots of components to the burger (rather than just a vegan patty on buns); there was kale, vegan cheese, tomatoes, avocado, etc. When ordering the vegan burger, make sure your side is a SALAD with vegan balsamic dressing. The fries are not vegan!!   I wanted to try their other gardien items, but I was wary about what was and wasn't vegan so I just went with the vegan burger.",

After a few minutes they found a booth for us to all sit together and were really nice and accommodating at the host stand. Our waitress danielle was also so nice and took all our orders quickly. I asked her if she could bring us the bill and boxes before the food came out so we wouldn't be scrambling at the end to pay and just take the food with us, I expected her to bring one big bill but she even separated ALL the checks without us having to ask. That was really really nice of her and everything went so smoothly that we managed to finish eating and settle our checks before our ride got back. It was such a relief and the whole staff was great. And the food is always good so there's also that",

It def wasn't his fault. Another server had asked if we wanted something else and we should have stuck w the same bartender to begin with.orher than that, next time we go Vegas well def be stopping by to visit Brandon again",

    "text": "We came here because it was open later than a lot of places and has a nice vegetarian section on the menu. The only thing is we arrived forty minutes before they closed and were treated as though we'd walked in at the very last minute. We were told we'd need to sit at the bar if we wanted to order food, and then the staff were all so busy prematurely breaking everything down to close up for the night that it took me forever to be able to ask someone to bring me silverware since my food was hastily set down in front of me without any silverware. It really kills the ambience when you're just wondering if you'll ever be able to get a fork or if you'll ever be able to order a drink despite that you're sitting at the bar all the while the manager is going around barking at everyone to get everything closed up. I've never been to a place that was so intent on having everything all pulled apart and cleaned up so the staff could leave at the same time as the diners, but the experience was rather unpleasant. I also got the sense that they must mostly deal with drunk jerks, because the attitude of the staff seemed relatively unfriendly and bizarrely condescending, apart from the one bartender guy who seemed to be trying. To be honest, based on my experience working in restaurants while I was in college, I got the impression that this place was hampered by poor management. That said, the service was similarly unfriendly at the Honolulu location so perhaps it's a corporate problem.  I still gave the place 3 stars because the Gardein menu is wonderful, and the food was generally quite good.",

When the appetizer arrived it was like it was recently removed from a refrigerator. When we asked for another, there was no problem. However, my dinner salad came and then the meal came, and then the appetizer came. I ordered the fish and chips, they were cold, my friend got the steak, it was cold as well. His fries were also way overcooked.  I don't know where they hire their cooks from but it was very embarrassing for our waitress to go through trying to explain to us why this all happened. She did a very good gob. I would suggest to future patrons that they ask if the food is cooked the day of instead of from breakfast the day before. I would've fired each one of those cooks responsible for making a somewhat nice experience into the fiasco they put us through. I can now compare our experience like it was a drive thru at McDonalds",

The \"hostess\" took us up to the deck as we requested and was going to sit us near a table of kids, I said no we want to sit over there away from kids, she asked if I liked kids and I said no and I don't want to sit next to them while in Vegas...anyways we were seated a few tables away from them and were pleased.  Almost immediately the same hostess was back up on the deck with guess what, a family with kids, she went straight for the table next to us (there were about 15 tables empty on the deck) and seated them, then smiled at me as to say f*ck you...well f*ck her..!  Anyways our waiter was pretty decent, he did disappear a couple of times but at least got our order right, the food at Yardhouse is usually good and this time was no exception...would have been a higher rating but hostess really was a b*tch so two stars is all they get....",

The food was good, burgers, sandwiches and fries were all cooked well and quite tasty. And our server, Pricilla I believe her name was, was beyond great! She was attentive even though she had a number of tables to attend to and when carding my boyfriend noticed that we were in town celebrating his birthday and had a surprise treat for him at the end of our meal.

Another 20 minutes. So we sat there for 40 minutes without a drink. Ironically the appetizer showed up before the beer. This was on a sunday night with less than 40 people there. Would have been a much bigger tab if service was reasonable, just an fyi for management.",

    "text": "So my son was getting married at Caesars Palace.  I needed a place to have his rehearsal dinner.  I called Yard House, and set up a beautiful menu with Megan Knoch in Miami.  She was the easiest person to deal with, and very accommodating.  Any questions I had, she would get back to me right away.  When the time came, Yard House @ The Linq took such good care of us.  They had plenty of staff waiting on our guests.  They were all so friendly, and happy to get whatever anyone wanted.  All of our guests raved about the food!  We were all extremely happy!!  For the day of the wedding I had ordered platters of food for the bride, and grooms rooms for the wedding party to eat while getting ready.  Dominick the manager called me to assure me they would have the food ready when the groomsmen came to pick it up.  He wanted to make sure our order would be at the maximum best for us, and it was.  Dominick was so amazing to work with, and when the groomsmen brought the food to our room.  They raved about the incredible service Yard House provided for us!!!  I highly recommend this location!!!  I will definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas!!!  Outstanding!!!!",

The view was gorgeous from the upper deck. The atmosphere was very comfortable even slightly romantic. The service was great with friendly attentive waiters. The price was really good I thought. I had the Ginger Salmon, my husband had an excellent sandwich (I forget which one sorry) we both had drinks and two appetizers all totaling only 82 dollars!! Normally we would spend 200 dollars on a dinner with excellent food so this was a pleasant surprise! I don't really think you could go wrong with any dish on the menu. We would highly recommend going here and we will be back!",

Love the location in the newly renovated LINQ area between Flamingo and LINQ.  The menu is very versatile and suits many types of diets.  We are pescatarian so it was great to have many seafood and vegetarian options.  They have a place on their menu dedicated to vegatians that also uses meat alternatives.  The macaroni and cheese with truffle oil was incredible.  Everything we've eaten here was worth writing about.  Upstairs is a great seating option.  Our only complaint was the hostess wasn't very accommodating to us having a child, we felt like we had to find a seat ourselves that worked.",

Prior to this past Friday the food had always been sub par and the service so-so.   That all changed when I ordered their chicken nachos and the other three people in my party all had burgers. Everything was absolutely spot on. The nachos were gigante (hee-gaunt-a)! The chicken was super moist, almost like it came from a rotisserie. That's pretty key because the chicken on nachos is usually dry and stringy. Not this time. The red salsa they put on it was really good too. Enough cheese and guac as well as sour cream really led this to be the dish I had been waiting all week for and didn't know it. Super good. Everyones burgers appeared to be solid as well - I think all 4 members of the group were honorary members of the \"Clean Plate Club.\" The service was good enough - dont' recall the servers name, but he kept the drinks full for the most part, gave us enough time to look at their gigantic menu. The only thing that I didn't care for was that I asked him if he could put on the UNLV basketball game. I don't know if it was on TV or not, but he never was able to get the game on and he never mentioned it again. I would have appreciated some sort of acknowledgment - that said, it was crazy busy and I can totally excuse the oversight.   After a few bad experiences I'm happy to report out a good one. I definitely won't avoid this place as openly as I had in the past. Great turnaround and Yard House always has a lively atmosphere which I like.",

A free drink does not save you a 1 star review. A $200 bill with a food allergy mistake solved with a $2 product cost comp? Ugly ugly ugly.... There are way too many options on the strip to have this. Now, Scottsdale, San Diego and the rest of the Yard Houses will not be seeing me again.

Got me and my lil family into a booth with close to the patio view. James our server was super patient and checked in with us regularly refilling my water, God knows I'm thirsty, and making sure everything was kosher. We ordered the chicken nachos and holy guacamole. Literally. unless there is 5 or 6 of you prepare to share your next meal, the nachos are huge and I wasn't lying there is guacamole, a good ol' scoop right in the center. My man got the Cali rueben which he had to take to go lol. The nachos were so huge. And I had the lamb burger which was amazing. I only ate half and I'm actually eating the other half now.

What is even cooler if they have their own brewery in house, literally right above the bar (make sure to look up when you walk in).  We didn't really eat much when we were here but did get a chance to try chips and guacamole, which hit the spot! The food menu was a bit pricey. Will definitely keep this as a regular spot stop next time we are in Vegas!  Cheers!",

It took me forever to peruse the menu, and then there were 140 beers on tap to choose between.  Phew!    I feel like everything we ordered was just OK.  Nothing really wow'ed me, which I feel might not be the case if they had a smaller menu where they could focus on making a few great dishes.  Drew ordered the regular mac & cheese which was nothing special.  I ordered the lunch duo with a margarita pizza and their ranch salad.  I really enjoyed the salad, not so much the pizza.  The salad was filled with the most random stuff!  It had sliced brussels sprouts, corn, pistachios, sunflower seeds, croutons, and was topped (of course) with ranch.  My colleague ordered the chicken enchilada stack and it is beautifully plated.  She let me try a bit and I had food envy the rest of the meal.    Overall, it was a nice place to eat and sit outside for lunch, but I wouldn't expect to be blown away by what you order.",

Even the young man who sat us at our tables started a conversation about our trip to Vegas. Our waitress, Kristen P was the nicest waitress on this trip to Vegas and I overheard her talking to the folks at the table next to us about being a transplant from the East Coast.    It's a very good place for beer lovers - with over a 100 variety, she told us they have up to 300 varieties.  I liked the fried calamari which was crispy, good amt. tentacles and not too oily, $11.25.  The Youngs Chocolate Stout had a delightful chocolate scent.  Hubby thought his small Jambalaya, $12.95 was good. I thought the Nashville boneless Hot fried chicken $16.65 was OK but not sure I'd try it again.  I have a preference for buttermilk fried chicken.  The entire meal with tip came to $62+.  They treat you well here as a customer and that alone would bring me back in the future to try other courses.  There are lots of TVs mounted on the walls to watch your favorite teams.",

Beer list was top notch and the specials during happy hour were pretty good for a place on/near the strip. Tried the moo shu egg rolls, vampire tacos, and traditional firecracker wings. All were very good except the moo shu egg rolls. Crispy on the outside but mushy and not the flavor we were expecting. Recommend trying the vampire tacos and the wings were large and only $6.  We enjoyed our experience except the wait staff made us feel like we needed to rush out. I wasn't ever asked if I wanted a second beer and after the waiter gave us the check and said no rush he came back 5 times in about 15 minutes to see if we were ready to pay. What if I was going to stay for the Monday night game? I was ready to but took the rest of my business to another establishment.",

If you enjoy wings their portion for the appetizer is really good for the price and the quality of the chicken makes it even better. I do also find the onion ring tower and good appetizer to share with a groups of friends and it comes with 2 dipping sauces which makes it even better.   The best part of all was how knowledgable their staff was when it came to questions about the menu. There are times when I cannot make up my mind between a couple of items and I asked my waiter his suggestion. He was able to go into so much detail as well as include his favorite item as well. This place has it all, oh and multiple TVs for all the sporting events. This place is a must for anyone visiting Vegas",

The only reason I didn't give them 4 stars was because I went there on a Sunday to watch my team play, and there were maybe 2 people in the huge bar when I got there at 10am and my game wasn't on one of the bar tv's so I asked if they would change one of them so I could sit up at the bar (since it was just me) and the manager absolutely refused.  So I had to ask to sit at one of their booths that actually seat 6 - 8 people so I could watch my game.  They told me \"that's fine\" - but to me that was definitely a waste for one person to sit at this huge booth. That is a big red flag with regards to the overall management of the place.  Management needs to do a better job of accommodating NFL Sunday ticket game watchers.",

Things like wings, sandwiches, a whole bunch of things made with the veggie product.  It was great.  We ordered the veggie \"wings\" and fries. The fries were very average - but the gardein wings were good - firecracker sauce - VERY spicy though.. I paid for it the next morning  ( if you know what I mean).   The place was staffed with young folks, and our waiter was enthusiastic and friendly although not really too polished, but all in all his service was ok.

But we were highly impressed! Lobster garlic pasta was succulent and filled with shiitake mushrooms. Southern fried chicken breast was perfectly fried crispy on the outside but moist inside!  Have to mention our server Tre was superb. Listened. Offered good options. Super helpful and attentive. Price was even reasonable for the area.",

Although it is on the strip, the restaurant is huge and a wait is very minimal. Maybe it's because I came on a Thursday night but everyone knows that any restaurant on the strip is always busy. I will definitely come back here and all other yard house locations",

It was a beautiful day and we were seated on their amazing rooftop patio.  We ordered some ciders (PINEAPPLE cider!), and a few appetizers to share.  We got the Moo Shu Egg Rolls, Hawaiian Poke Stack and Coconut Shrimp.  Everything was super fresh and tasty.  We had never been to a Yard House before and this is definitely not our last time.  We were actually wishing we had just a little more time in Vegas so we could go back for one more meal.  There were so many tasty sounding things on the menu, it was hard to decide.",

The space is huge -- is it the largest YH in the country? -- and the beer list is impressively thorough.  Food is generally well done and satisfies most cravings anyone would have.  I have noticed in the past year that service is hit-or-miss, regardless of which location I've visited.  I frequent the Red Rock Casino location a lot and some days, the servers are fantastic: observant, personable, and very knowledgeable about the menu.  Other times, it's difficult to get the person's attention.  Each time I've dropped by the Linq YH, I've been underwhelmed by my service.  I don't believe that I'm a demanding diner, but I do expect to be acknowledged within 5-10 minutes of being seated and to receive a smile or two.  However, working in the service industry can be trying at the best of times, so I'm willing to give people some slack.",

    "text": "I'm a bit torn as to how to review Yard House. The food was delicious, the atmosphere upbeat, and the staff was really friendly. We came on a Thursday evening (730-ish) and there was no wait for a table inside (nice!). We were seated and we requested to watch a specific channel (NBA playoffs were on) and they were very accommodating (even changed the channel for us). We placed our appetizer order and got our food fairly quickly. The poke bowl and the garlic noodles from the snack menu were divine!!! We ordered our meal and waited almost an hour... Still no food. The waiter came by and apologized and said he would check on it. Took another 15 minutes for the food to come. Given we were there to watch the playoff game, it really wasn't that big of a deal. The manager came by (very nice) and apologized and said she would give us dessert on the house (awesome!). So we placed our dessert order and waited. Another 30 minutes passed and still no dessert! To sum it up, there was a glitch in the system and the kitchen wasn't receiving orders coming in from our table! Oddly enough, it was only our table that was falling through the cracks in the system (although it was weird that we got our snacks in a timely manner).  The food was delicious though and the prices were just right (especially for being on the strip). The staff was very nice and did apologize profusely. The manager comped a few more items off our bill in addition to the desserts we ordered. But I can tell you, if it wasn't for the playoff game, I would have raised more of a stink. I guess it worked out... We saw the entire game (yes we were there for three full hours) and we got some other items off our bill comped. Although if I was the manager, I would have comped the entire meal (it's all about customer service) and who knows what will end up on Yelp, right? :)  As for the food, the onion rings were great, sweet potato fries cooked just right, although a nice aioli sauce would have been a nice accompaniment. Steak sandwich was delish... The dessert looks good, but was a bit disappointing. We ordered the s'mores brownie and the trio. None were impressive so I would probably save room for dessert and head outside for Ghiradelli or Sprinkles.",

I still had a full marguerita left from my HH which they gave me in a to go cup. I'm not a big drinker so I was drinking slowly. Once we were seated at the bar, my husband was asking the bartender questions about the beers on tap. It was at this point the bartender advised me that I couldn't have my drink. I had to \"chug it or take it outside\"! Rude. Yardhouse won't see ANY of my money. I know the bartender is just the messenger but this is a STUPID POLICY.

The Penne with chicken was good nothing special. And the Roaster turkey pot pie was huge and very good.",

Others had the onion ring tower and the sweet potato fries, all good.  For dinner we had a wide selection of dishes that all came back with positive reviews. I had the grilled pastrami sandwich with fries, which was good but could have used a mustard as it was a bit dry and lacked a kick. Wife had the coconut shrimp which she enjoyed. Others had the BBQ chicken pizza, fish and chips, blu cheese burger and the pastrami hot dog.  The real draw to the place is the beer selection, unbelievable. Ever selection of beer (except my favorite, sours) was well represented.   Overall the food was really good, location was awesome, patio was great even on a chilly windy night. The food is really good for the price.",

    "text": "Pros: Great service, friendly staff, beer selection Cons: Bland food TL; DR: Don't orde the Lamb Burger  The review is solely based on having ordered the Lamb Burger, which is probably my mistake as Yard House seems like the kind of fun place to get drink, chat with stranger, and consume a ridiculous amount of sodium rich foods... not the kind of place to find well prepared non-traditional burgers.   First off, I love lamb. It's flavor, when seasoned and cooked correctly, can transport you to food nirvana. When cooked like a generic piece of meat picked from a nondescript discount heap, is one of the saddest food experiences imaginable... and Yard House's Lamb Burger falls somewhere closer to that kind of sad experience.   Maybe the executive chefs like bland gamey meat; or maybe the menu designer mistyped Lamb instead of Bland; who knows... the result was a seriously unimaginative experience. It literally just tasted like ground lamb meat between two pieces of bread with a minuscule amount of feta to inadequately create a mediterranean facade.  The shoestring fries were bomb.   The beer selection is strong.   The service was phenomenal.",

The recommendation was to try Yardhouse, recently opened but with a great selection.  We certainly weren't disappointed when seated at the bar, able to observe the many many draught taps and presented with the fat menu containing the details of that vast selection.  We started by selecting something we hadn't tried before and applied that selection criteria a few more times. The staff member who attended to us was knowledgable and let me try samples before committing to a decision as to what would be my next glass. We only had some basic chips but the food being brought out to other patrons around looked good.  Would definitely recommend you check this place if you like craft beer!",

I also got the French Onion Soup and a Blackened Swordfish taco with no pico de gallo Vampire Style. The French Onion soup is the best ive ever had as well. Nice hearty broth with the crouton on top still fresh and crispy with nicely melted/crisped cheese. Every bit of it was delicious but i did get a bit too much of a spice on the taco since i have a very sensitive tummy, had to make that note for my plain palate peeps! My boyfriend had the Poke Stack and just inhaled it because it was so tasty. The raw marinated fish was very tender and seasoned spot on. Was plated beautifully as well!   We also had a few special drinks, i really really really enjoyed the Pineapple Express! It was the perfect balance of sweet and tang with the pineapple, combining it with the mint just made it so fresh and light. Made my boyfriend wish he would have ordered my drink, it was so good! He has ordered the Hawaiian Sunset martini and it was good but not my favorite. Had undertones of what reminded me of a fruity vitamin or a gummy worm lol. All in all it was really delicious and worth every penny. We left very happy customers!",

As we were there at happy hour, we ordered some of the reduced price appetisers rather than going for entrees. All were delicious and very generously portioned. 4 appetisers between us was more than enough.  Sierra Nevada on draft in the UK is a rarity so I ordered up a half yard of Sierra Nevada.  After I'd finished that, I asked for another pint of Sierra Nevada and an Old 43 cocktail (woodford reserve bourbon, licor 43, house citrus agave, orange bitters). I was told that I couldn't have both at the same time and would need to finish at least half my pint! What? But, if I ordered a half yard, I could have both at the same time. A crazy rule which makes no sense and the reason for 4 stars.  Service was good and my wife had a free souffle and ice cream as it was her birthday.",

I can't figure for the life of me why they call them \"vampire tacos\"; another ingredient is roasted garlic, and from my childhood education of vampires, I know they don't jive. In any event, they could have called them \"Ultra Space Supernova Mega-Spectacular Grand Finale Tacos\" and it would have the same result: AWESOME.  There is a nice patio section perfect for people watching and catching a breeze.  But perhaps the Yard House's biggest claim to fame is having over one hundred beers on tap.  A HUNDRED!  Move over 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall, Yard House has got you covered with taps!  What could possible go awry with 100 beers on tap and blood sucking, reflection-less tacos?",

Red quinoa kale, shiitakes, daiya mozzarella, avocado, tomato arugula, onion, miso, onion bun and mixed greens - it tasted as good as it sounded!! The patty was grilled fantastically, well formed, great flavors, and some smokey taste to it too.  I went with the truffle fries and they were really well done. You definitely could taste the truffle flavor that's so rich. I also tried the blueberry ketchup as my dip, and that was okay. They did it well, where you can taste the ketchup but also the sweetness of the blueberry, but I didn't really enjoy it, at least not with fries. One bite would taste like ketchup, another would taste like blueberry jam.  They also have a great selection of beers and a wide variety, from light lagers, to sours, to stouts, whatever you like they have at least a couple beers for it.  The server was attentive and helpful in deciding on our choices, but also was just a tiny bit off-putting with his hate of vegetarian dishes. Not too big of an issue, but if I was a vegetarian or a vegan, I could easily be offended.",

Vegan burger was tasty, salad was fine.  Here is the good stuff - the menu is such that basically anyone could find something that is suitable.  The beer and drinks are plentiful.

I on the other hand, had to go the non-alcoholic route and had the passion fruit iced tea. It was delicious and very refreshing! Highly recommend!   As for food, we arrived during their \"Happy Hour\" which ran from 3-6pm. We shared the $5 Onion Ring Tower and the $6 chicken strips. I wasn't too hungry to begin with and there was SOOOO MUCH FOOD. I don't know if it's my heightened sense of smell and taste but the food, although was pretty good (my husband loved it), tasted too much like grease to me.   Service was superb!!

    "text": "Don't know how many times I passed this restaurant by as a (relatively new) local, but no more!  I went here with a friend recently, and the experience was - for the most part - great.  Being a vegetarian, it's always awesome to find an entire portion of a menu devoted to vegan- or vegetarian-friendly items; but Gardein??  Love love love.  I got a Gardein chicken sandwich, and it was delicious.  The only problem with our order was with my friend's sandwich.  She has a sulfur allergy, and requested one of the toppings be held from her order; though the waiter Did, in fact, input the order correctly, there was a miscommunication somewhere and the offending ingredient wasn't removed.  She realized it as soon as she bit into it, so not much harm done, but if it were a life or death allergy, this would've been serious.  They remade the sandwich for her, and both our waiter and the manager came by to personally apologize for the incorrect (and in this case, hazardous) order.  Though, of course, we would've preferred the order be correct to start with, we're just glad the situation was rectified.  The service we received made up for the error.  I definitely plan on returning to try more of the wondrous vegetarian and vegan options.  If you're on the Strip looking for good options as a healthy eater, this is the place!",

    "text": "Before riding The High Roller at LINQ we stopped for dinner at Yard House.  The menu was huge and a bit overwhelming.  Their beer selection is insane & they have a ton of signature cocktails as well.  We ordered the Spicy Tuna Roll for a starter and it was great.  It isn't the traditional roll in that there is no rice used.  I would call it more of a Spicy Tuna Tower.  The tuna is layered above a green onion, cucumber, and edamame mixture with avocado & cabbage on top with a sauce surrounding it on the plate.  It was beautiful to look at and the tuna was super fresh!  I wasn't super hungry for dinner, so I appreciated the \"Snacks\" options they had.  I ended up ordering their guacamole & chips and crispy brussels sprouts with ripped potatoes. Both were amazing.  My only criticism would be that the brussels sprouts have a super tasty dipping sauce that you don't see until you've eaten the top layer.  They have it on the bottom, so once you are full you realize there was amazing dipping sauce that you could've been using the entire time.  I was disappointed in that, because it was hardly used due to plating.  My husband ordered the Southern Fried Chicken Breast that comes with creamed corn, bbq baked beans, mashed potatoes, and bourbon gravy.  It was really filling, but he had no complaints.  He loved it all.  We would definitely go back.",

The place is nice! The decor is rustic and had a chill vibe. Our server greeted and took our drink orders with great local beer recommendations! We ordered multiplied appetizers and when they started to arrive that's when the disappointment started. The buffalo cauliflower was skimpy and had a splash (literally) of sauce, it almost looked accidental. The calamari was over cooked and had a big lump of garnish at the top and the sliders were cold. The only good thing was the truffle French fries! Those were fresh and so delicious! Everything in Vegas is expensive so it sucks to have even simple appetizers that should be fool proof come out terrible. Maybe it was just an off night? But we wouldn't take a chance again.",

When I called Yard House to report the discrepancy the manager was unapologetic and refused to take responsibility. He instead went on to blame Postmates for the discrepancies. Postmates had kept in contact with us throughout the duration of the order (unlike Yard House) and reported to us that the food was not ready upon arrival.   Even if it was Postmate's fault for the delayed delivery, Yard House still did not take responsibility for the missing items. The manager went on to tell me how the Postmate's menu is sometimes different than what the Yard House menu includes. I read straight off the Postmates menu and told him of the items that were not found in the order, but were included in the description. He still would not take responsibility.   This was all highly disappointing as my company looks forward to our weekly lunches. There were many sad faces in the office today due to Yard House's poor service. Highly unfortunate.",

I stopped in late Sunday night after doing the happy half hour at the High Roller. We had to finish our drinks before we could get a table per their policy. The place was rather empty. We ordered the steak Cobb salad and chicken enchilada soup. The salad was ok but similar to very other Cobb salad I've had. The steak was overdone in some places and chewy in others. The soup tasted great. I really wanted to try the beer or the frozen mule but I'll go back another time for that",

    "text": "Great restaurant in the Linq outside strip with prices that were reasonable. We stopped by after a work trade show on a Tuesday. The atmosphere is nice. It's situated by the Linq high roller wheel. Nice outdoor space with a view.   The place was packed and there was a wait of about 30 mins but we were able to marry up 4 chairs at the bar.  If you love beers and beers on tap as well as bottles this is your spot. Everything from wheat beers to pilsners to sours. The have it all and are knowledgeable enough to walk you through what you are looking for or give you a taste. Highly recommend.   As far food. I ordered the ahi tuna with jasmine rice and asparagus. In a city that is so pricy and filled with food options it's nice to get s great meal at a price your used to. The tuna was cooked perfectly and the whole dish worked.  All in all after a few beers and dinner we were set. If we are ever back in this part of Vegas I would come back. Keep it up Yard House.   Cheers Justin",

    "text": "I was really excited to try the Yard House after seeing it on various trips I've been on. It worked out that we were starving after hours of walking the strip and Yard House was open later than most places on the strip on Sunday nights. The kitchen closed at 12:30am and we made it at 12:05am. Our waiter was absolutely fantastic. He checked on us multiple times, was prompt with drinks/food/ticket, and was really friendly and helpful!  This place has an insane amount of beers and ciders on tap, so that is a huge appeal. The food selection was enticing but a little overpriced. We were just hungry and didn't care, plus is was a nice modern restaraunt so sort of expected. However, the one thing I can't get behind and the reason my rating stands at only 3 stars is because the food was SO bland and disappointing. I got a bacon cheeseburger. It tasted like nothingness. My boyfriend got a chicken sandwich. No flavor. The garlic fries were barely garlicky. It was all edible but so boring for my palette, and at that price I was hoping for some flavor or higher quality. Based on that, I don't think I would come back here for anything but the beer variety in the future, unfortunately.",

On this occasion my parents were visiting from out of town and we decided to have a small birthday lunch for my dad here. Before coming here, I called to see if it was okay if we brought a cake- they were like of course, no problem. I had a custom cake made for my dad at a bakery he loves to watch on the food channel.   Gave the hostess my cake and candles, she told me she would let the server know and take care of everything. Great!   Why the three stars? Well service is always slow when I come to this location, this time was not different. But the biggest bummer was the server had no idea about the cake, once I mentioned it to him on my way to the bathroom, he brought it out, still in the bag, handed me my candles, put the boxed cake in front of me and handed me a lighter- ummm okay?   It was pretty confusing why this was handled this way considering yard house does a whole birthday celebration thing of their own with a plated dessert and candle? I worked in food and beverage for 10 years, I've served a lot of cakes that families have brought it- this incident truly left a horrible taste in everyone at the tables mouth.  I offered the server a slice of cake and he was like hmm okay... he didn't have to take it if it was such an inconvenience... jerk!",

I can understand that they would have a separate bunch/ lunch menu but they should put some gardein options on that menu. My husband got bottomless mimosa/ beer/ bloody marry, very reasonably priced. However, the waiter did not come back and refill right away. It took over 5 minutes to get a fresh mimosa. It wasn't even busy in the restaurant.  My husband ordered the loco moco. He said it was really good, the patty had good caramelization and was not dry.   I ordered the avocado toast, it was good but the bread was not toasted. It was just served as bread with Avocado spread, arugula and tomatoes. It had good flavors and the smoked salt was tasty. I also ordered a side of crispy ripped potatoes. They were very good. Our waiter was nice, and helpful.  Overall okay experience. I think the food was just basic. There are so many options and places to eat on the strip, I wouldn't come back. I would had liked to try the Gardein options.  .",

Luckily for Yard House, I really like white ales and the house white ale was smooth and refreshing - I also got a half-yard so I was happily buzzed for the rest of my meal. I got the Nashville Hot Chicken and was actually blown away by how flavorful and juicy the chicken was. The waffle was a 5/10 but I could eat that chicken every day for the rest of my life. Highly recommend getting this dish if you like fried chicken.",

It is in the \"LINQ\" area and if not familiar with this area, it is an area off Flamingo Blvd right where the High Roller is (Google it).  It is a chance to get away from slot machines and gambling for a bit because it is a pedestrian walkway area with mostly shops and restaurants like you would see at any outdoor mall area.   Positive;  They were able to seat about 20 of us on a long high top table with virtually no wait.  Some of us had \"adult beverages\" and for those who may not know you can walk around with alcohol on the streets in LV.  The food was good, service was awesome and the craft beer (+1) was some of the best.  Negative: When came in they require us to dump out or drink what we have before they would seat us.  THIS IS LV and I have NEVER had to do that.  There were 20 + of us and guess what management, we will be buying another round I am sure.  I HATE Nitpicky stuff like this and NEVER had this problem at any other establishment.  I give it a 3+",

To eat I started with a cup or chicken tortilla soup and it was delicious it's served with guacamole,tortilla strips and chicken, for a lil kick I highly recommend this one. Garden salad was of good portion and good. My honey got the buffalo wings dry sauce on the side he said they are very good n could eat without the sauce. I myself got the Cheeseburger sliders with fries. I would not recommend this unless you get extra sauce. The plating of my sliders in itself was very unappetizing, looks like they were thrown on my plate. After being served our food our waitress didn't come to see if we needed anything for 12 mins unacceptable for sure. My sliders would have been great had I seem anyone who worked here to get some special sauce on the side our even ketchup or ranch. .",

My wife loves Brussels sprouts but she couldn't even eat the ones they brought out. They were called crispy Brussels sprouts under the snack section of the menu. They deep fried them whole with potato chunks and served them on top of a spicy aioli. The cooking method led the Brussels sprouts to become chewy and tough as they cooled down. And it was just too much mayo for me.   I got the chopped salad and had them add iceberg lettuce. It came out with an avocado half sliced paper thin and spread out on top of the salad. It was gorgeous and I couldn't wait to dig in. The dressing ended up being awful. It tasted like thousand island, but was pink, maybe from ketchup? It was basically pickly mayonnaise but was sweet. It ruined the salad for me.   On the bright side the hummus did come in a huge portion. Plenty for 4 people to split as long as you order extra pita.   I'm not anxious to go back, but since they are open until late and have a super diverse menu I probably will give them a second try.",

Six of our party of nine were teen girls celebrating my daughter's bday and they wanted their own table. I get it, that's cool. Yard House was great at accommodating 2 separate tables, ours was across the restaurant and yet the servers were cool about taking care of both tables and giving my hubby the bill.  Total bill for 9 people, minus tip, $160, not too bad! The food was great and service was awesome!",

The food is delicious and the flavor is mouth watering. The Asian dishes are our favorites, mushy egg rolls being at the top of the list. Highly recommend. We visited one in San Antonio Texas also and it was just as good. Both loications had great friendly service. Not to mention a huge cocktail and draught beer selection.",

For a chain this is about as good as it gets, lunch was tasty and served fast even though the place was packed and were a pretty large group. The BBQ chicken salad is worth a try and even the small size was plenty of food. I didn't try any this visit but they have a huge beer selection and happy hour specials that seem worth checking out.",

Today:  1- our food took forever! When it finally got there, my husband's Gardein burger was cold. Not warm... Cold! All fries on all plates were not even warm.   2- we ordered our little one a grilled cheese and it was nothing but grease. I get it that we order a sandwich like that but I can make a better and healthier option for my child.   3- our server took a break during our time there which is totally understandable but communication seemed to be lacking as when the other server dropped the check they charged my husband for two portions because they had to make him a new one. Then we had to get a manager to adjust it.   4- we ordered a kids meal for our daughter which came with a choice of drink, choice of side and choice of dessert. We never got anything more then fries for her. No drink and no fruit.   It wasn't even busy! In a location like this they should be better equipped to handle small mishaps like this one. Thank God the beer was cold.   It definitely left a bad taste in my mouth with as many managers that were standing around.   I'll stick to my regular location at Town Square.",

The food and service were also great...the place felt far more polished than its recent opening would suggest.   Considering how much good food there is in Vegas, it surprises me that there are not more beer centric bars and restaurants. This Yard House is really a savior, and the slightly off strip location creates a calm atmosphere that is a welcome relief from the mayhem elsewhere.",

Trying very hard not to use foul-language to express my disgust and frustration towards the staff, and the way they handled a mistake that was made on their part. After explaining my low-maintenance dietary needs (because I am allergic to dairy), I was assured it was safe to eat the food. NOT. The waiter was NOT educated about the menu, and when the manager came by to....I dunno, blame ME for the misunderstanding, there was no apology, and no remorse. Plenty of attitude though.  On the upside, she decided not to charge me for the meal I only took one bite of (which made me extremely sick from my allergy), and thought she did me a favor.   I will NEVER come back to this place, and I will NEVER recommend it. This review doesn't even begin to illustrate how nasty the service was. Is this how Yard House treats their guests??

Even if they don't have a happy hour menu like other their restaurants, they do have a Black Truffle Cheeseburger that is amazing when paired with the truffle friends all for about $10. Also, having to pay $7 for a shot of Hennessy is a diamond in the rough compared to these other clubs and bars that charge anywhere between $10-$17 for a shot.   If you're in the mood for some normalcy in Vegas at a decent price, this yard house will hit the spot. Also the Linq alley is a very nice place to just stroll, shop, eat, and drink. Highly recommend coming to see the glamorous Ferris wheel here!!",

The sweet potatoes fries came with a side of maple bacon dip, it was delicious and the perfect condiment to the fries. I didn't know how the tuna would turn out, since yard house isn't known for its seafood, but it was amazing! Came with a side of asparagus and brown rice, the only thing that could have been improved was that the sauce was a bit too salty for my liking.   And the entire time it was entertaining for us because our server kept looking at him funny, batting his eyes, like he was trying to hit on him. It was hilarious.",

My girlfriend ordered a pastrami dip and tomato bisque soup and sandwich I had the turkey club with French onion. The sandwiches were ample for a half sandwich special and very tasty. The avocado in the turkey club was a nice addition and the meat was ample. The French onion soup was covered with bread and cheesed sufficiently, not overly salty that can happen with French onion. The Pastrami was plentiful and the dark dipping sauce added a nice flavor. The Tomato bisque also had a nice texture and taste as well. The abundant draft choice drew me in but the food was a pleasant surprise. Compare restaurants in a similar price range and this one should rate highly. In fact we also ate at Carnegies Deli and paid more for a less impressive sandwich. Don't hesitate to try the food here. Will definitely come back here to try all of the beers.",

For appetizers, we had the poke stack and blue crab cakes. Both were good, but the sweetness of the mango sauce served with the crab cakes was too overpowering for the dish. We had the Kurobuta pork burger and lamb burger for entrees. The pork burger has spicy candied bacon, white cheddar cheese, and blueberry ketchup (!!) on it. Wow. This has to be the best pork burger anywhere. This is a great choice. The lamb burger was good also but not as great as that pork burger. They are served with shoestring fries which are very average. Give me a crinkle cut fry any day. Now the cocktails. Woah! I had the Southern Belle and Tahitian Moonshine. Both were so good that they warrant a second glass, but be aware. I was done after two drinks. That moonshine is no joke. I even tasted the Timmerman's strawberry beer which was very good, and I'm not a beer drinker at all.",

There are some excellent finds here with styles to suit any taste. The food is pretty good as well.

It was beautiful to the eyes but could have been more flavorful. The Baja taco was good. My greatest disappointment of the meal was my margarita. At a cost of $10 plus it was mostly ice with a little bit of margarita. Not worth the 10 bucks as there really was nothing special about it and it was gone after I took three drinks . I do give high marks on the service . It was a busy night. We were told a 10 minute wait but it was more five.  Very friendly staff  and the food came out quickly.",

We waited about 30 minutes, but during the wait, I meandered over to the street side bar and had a cold one. Very convenient, but that too can get a little backed up.  The menu had a variety food options. I had a craving for fried chicken, so I ordered it. The plate presented well, but I was on the fence on the chicken. When I see fried chicken on a menu, I anticipate a crunchy outside and tender inside...and a bone. Dang this chicken was boneless. Totally ruined my salivation. But oh well. I gave this place a 4 only because it's an awesome place to visit. The atmosphere is typical of a bar/restaurant scene. The beer, OMG so many taps of so many kinds of barley. Perfect place for beer drinkers. I would definitely come back though.",

We sit at the bar so I can't comment on the wait staff but the bartenders here are awesome - especially George! Even if we don't sit in his section, he'll usually walk over to us to make sure we're good on drinks or make us cocktails to go (I highly recommend the Sunkissed Sangria and the Tahitian Moonshine).   The food here is great - several vegan/vegetarian and gluten free options on the menu. I enjoy the summer salad and the mushroom lettuce wraps while my boyfriend loves the chicken lettuce wraps and the nachos. My bf is a big guy and couldn't finish the nachos on two occasions - it's a huge plate so he asked for it to go and gave it to a homeless person on the Strip.   Dan and I will definitely be back next time we're in Vegas :)",

It was a party of 5 and the customer service was horrendous! Apart from the service being really bad the food was served very sloppy! I'm so disappointed! I'm a regular at the yard house in the town square location and the servers are always up beat, happy, and make sure your taken care of. I ordered vampire tacos here at this yard house and they were nothing like the ones they served at town square and they were really cold. We told the manager and she didn't even apologize she just said oh ok and took them off our table and just brought new ones. My husband ordered his favorite which was lobster garlic noodle and the shrimp AND lobster were cold but we were already irritated that he just ate it because we didn't eat anything all day waiting to eat at yard house. We weren't getting refills on our drinks. We had to ask for refills every time. I'm just confused on everything that happened tonight because it was literally 11:30pm, the place was completely dead and the server was never to be found. I love yard house! I go like 3 times a week and this was the first time I came here to celebrate my friends birthday and it became a big disaster! I will NEVER be coming back to this yard house ever again!",

I love the appetizers: Hummus/pita, Edamame/spicy, Garlic noodles and new to try this time- Kale Salad full of so many yummy additions.

Very tasty and reasonably priced. My mom had no complaints with her fish and chips.   The best part of Yard House is, of course, the beer. What a selection!! The drink menu is very descriptive so you know exactly what you're getting when you order- where it's brewed, alcohol content, etc.   I ordered a watermelon beer which was meh but hey, I'm not big on watermelon unless it's the actual fruit.   The restaurant is quite large. Restrooms are on the main level.  There's an elevator as well as a staircase to the upper level.",

It was the last day of our trip and they made it amazing.  They made us feel right at home, suggested local brews, and kept us happy and engaged.  It may seem silly that a lunch can make your day but truly, they made ours.  With all the selections in vegas often with rude and disinterested wait staff this Yardhouse blows them all away.

Our server Christian was super friendly and efficient... will definitely be back!!!",

The environment inside was really nice and trendy. Lol I ordered a fried chicken breast with mash potatoes. It came with cream corn and it was good. We also ordered the lobster crab and artichoke dip and that was really good. I highlight recommend this place. Prices are affordable and it's really good.",

My entire table complained about it, but oh well, we just put our jackets on. They served our appetizers before the meal, which was good considering how hungry we all were! The food came out timely and nice and hot! Our orders were correct the first time around which is great because we had about 18 people in our group, so no one was left without. Great place for large groups!",
