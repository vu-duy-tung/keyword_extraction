I had the Irish Nachos (which is an appetizers and it came out with everyone else's dinner).  They were swimming in grease, the potatoes were soft and really lacked flavor.  My friends weren't too happy with their meals either.",

I have to admit after a few pints of beer the food does taste better and the dim lights make everybody look more attractive.  The onions rings were so good we actually fought over the last remaing pieces.  Not a bad house band.  We sat in a booth in between the band and the bathrooms so it was pretty loud once the music got going.  A good place to chow down and hang out in between hitting the tables at the nearby casinos.",

Come-on how about throwing me a quarters worth of vegetables on my $14 dinner plate? The Garlic bread was two peices which at one time were one, sliced in half to add to the illusion you are being fed.  Beer was over-priced and not even really cold. $6 for a 12oz beer is, well, a rip-off.  Waitress did not know what the Specials were. Apparently the 5 items a week, one per day was too difficult for her to memorize. She had to hunt down a laminated card spelling out what the specials were.  Place stinks, is dark, service is weak and the portions are small.",

She really was quick, fast, and friendly. She really knew what she was doing. So this review has nothing to do with her, she's awesome!  Unfortunately, when we came back for brunch, we got another server and our service was completely subpar. It took forever to even be greeted at a table. The drinks came slowly. The food time took forever. On the plus side, when the food finally came out it was actually pretty good. But it also took forever to receive our check. The service was super slow.   Being servers ourselves, we gave the place another chance and came back on our last day in Vegas... that was big mistake. We sat down and was NEVER greeted. I politely asked surrounding servers and asked them to bring our server over when they have a chance. We sat there for more than 15 minutes and no one ever came out to greet us. We ended up leaving the place and going elsewhere because we were tired of waiting longer even after asking.   All in all, there is an awesome server here. But unfortunately, the not so great ones overshadowed her. I REAAALLLY wanted to like this place, but was super let down.",

Since it was suggested by someone who happens to be a waitress here, my view of the excellent service we got may be a bit skewed.  But judging by the number of wait staff attending to diners on the patio, which was packed by the time we left, I don't think so.  We sat inside, at the back pub tables in the blissful air conditioning.  My drinking buddies were taking advantage of the happy hour prices and imbibing freely, while I was content to nurse my two glasses of wine, one more than my usual.  We were lucky to be at Hennessey's on Tuesday, when burgers are 2x1, so hubby and I eschewed the appetizers and chewed instead on some tasty burgers.  Good quality.  We'll go back again (this was, I think, our second visit), especially after learning about the good deal to be had with the pub dinners for $10.95.  The burger was excellent, so I expect we'll be happy the next time, too.",

We've always enjoyed our visits and look forward to a delicious bloody mary while playing video poker at the bar. We aren't there for free drinks - we are there to get out of a smokey casino and play poker, while enjoying a cocktail.  This last visit will likely be our last... there were two bartenders on duty on Sunday morning. The female was friendly but appeared to be going on break to visit with her puppy that her friends had brought in - the gentleman bartender was not so friendly. He took our orders and then ignored us. If I hadn't assertively asked for another drink, I wouldn't have gotten it. When it was time for us to leave (because lets face it, we were not having any fun) my mom asked to be cashed out of her machine. His response \"Oh, I thought you were leaving that for me.\"  Well, nope, you didn't earn it!   He then asked if we wanted to close our out check which we were surprised about since we were gambling... we asked him if our drinks were comp'd and he then asked how much we gambled, which was over $75 btw. He double checked their computers and told us we were fine to go.  Ultimately, it was a crappy experience. He wasn't funny and he certainly didn't care about providing good service. The place wasn't busy and all the employees were talking about how hungover they were from Halloween the night before.   Thanks for nothing, Hennessy's. We'll have more fun a couple doors down.",

It's a nice locals hang out that lets you see a glimpse into the real behind the scenes Vegas.  The food and drinks were good, but this place is all about the atmosphere. It's a bit far away from the glitz and glamor of Vegas but depending on the type of person you are, it is a perfect place to get away from all of that.   As for the food get the homemade chips! Do it! You're in Vegas indulge! The pancakes were pretty phenomenal too!   The drinks were pretty reasonable and we got to enjoy a live band while slugging them back.   Overall a really awesome place to get back to normality! Oh and the staff is pretty awesome too, but not as cool as the costumers!   Thanks for some of the best memories I have of Vegas!",

And the Vegas one -- at the sketchy end of Fremont Street -- turns out to be the smarter, happier, better adjusted, sibling of the two.  The Vegas Hennesey's was kind enough or naive enough to host the Las Vegas Hash House Harrier's annual Red Dress Run.  The beer was fine, the food was even better, and the staff had nary a twig up their ass as 120 revererls clad in their sweaty red finest danced to the band and entertained the other customers.  The next day, I saw that  the menu looked vaguely familiar... and yep,  Carlsbad's craptacular Hennessey's was listed on it.  But what's Vegas' secret ingredient that makes their food so much better?  A touch of cigarette smoke?  A hint of despair?  How did their staff get so damn friendly?  And where are all the \"security\" guys?  Viva, Las Vegas Hennessey's.  BTW, your Carlsbad sister can still kiss my butt.",

All of the servers walked by us and not a single one said anything to us. Heard the waitresses talking about who was going to take the table and still no one came over to us. Not a good look for a restaurant at all. Being a server myself there is no excuse for that. It wasn't even that busy so I don't see why that happened. To me that's poor staffing and poor communication between host and servers. Also servers should be aware of their sections and know when they got sat. I can see waiting a couple min but not 20. Had 3 different serves make eye contact with us and all they did was smoke and walk by. When they went to the table next to us they snuck by to try and make it so we didn't see them. Hope this doesn't happen to anyone else. Really unfortunate because I was looking forward to the mac and cheese burger they have.",

I ordered the margarita and hubby ordered the blue moon.  For food we got the hummus and chicken tenders with buffalo sauce and ranch.  The drinks came back pretty quick along with the food.  My margarita was good, but why not in a margarita glass?  It was in a regular glass, which I thought was wierd.  We then ordered the crab cake sliders, which were not good at all.  My hubby is not a picky eater and he didn't even like them...way too salty!  Don't order these!   The decor is nice and the music was good.  I liked the live guitar player/singer.  He had a great voice and provided good entertainment for the night.  Oh yea, the server did come over to chat with us and was really nice.  It just took a while to come around when we first arrived, but the rest of the night service was good.",

    "text": "Oh dear, I certainly hope my next visit to Hennessey's will be bumped up to the normal 4-Star Rating I expect.   I went to HT last night to partake of their 2-4-1 burger night (it's on Tuesdays). *sigh* I was disappointed. First off I ordered the Normal run-o-the-mill burger while my friend ordered one of the corn-beef hash burgers. My burger was NOT GOOD. I ordered it medium well, it came out WELL DONE, like super well done. Who wants to eat a dried up, over cooked burger? Not me. I asked for the Irish cheese, well when the burger came out the cheese was practically non-existent and it was just seared into the burger. I suspect a chef was not paying attention to this burger and just let it cook forever. I suspect this especially because it took quite awhile for our food to come out and the place was NOT busy.   Another complaint: the burger came with ONE measly lettuce leaf and ONE slice of thin tomato! Well I guess they're trying to save money on the burgers because they're doing a 2-4-1 special? Guess what Hennessey's? It's not cool to offer a special deal and then skimp on the burger and turn it into a piece-o-crap that no one wants to eat!   It is a good thing I got the Truffle Fries as an appetizer with the 50% off deal you can get by checking in on Yelp, otherwise I would have been really unhappy. But even the truffle fries were not my favorite as they were just covered in garlic. However, I enjoyed them over the burger.  The bartender here was nice and congenial, but the food ruined it for me. I will be back, but not for burger night and I definitely will not be ordering a burger from here ever again. Burger blacklisted!",

    "text": "If it weren't for the food, I would give Hennessey's 1 star. Not worth it.  My visiting friend and I were looking to eat somewhere downtown where we could enjoy the weather and sit outside. They have open seating, if you can call it that, so we ordered a drink at the bar (8$ for a miller light..what??) and waited for a table to open up outside. As a couple nearby was on their way out, we asked the waitress if it were okay for us to go ahead and take the table. She cleared off the table and didn't give us an answer for a significant amount of time until she replied \"well are you going to be eating?\" I understand serving people who order food will generally give you a greater tip, but regardless if we were planning on eating or not, that question probably isn't the best way to increase those dollars.  While waiting for our food to come we saw another strange interaction occur with the open seating. We noticed a group of five or six looking for an outdoor seat, exchange words with the waitress, and head to the bar to pick up drinks. In the mean time, the group at the table next to us had paid and left the restaurant, and two young women saw the open table and sat down. They sat for a few minutes before the waitress came over and told them she promised the table to a group that had been waiting over thirty minutes (False, ten max). The girls obliged, and the group claimed the table. I don't think open seating is the best option for this place. Holy confusion. Besides the odd seating issues, our table was not clean, nor stable. This restaurant needs a serious face lift!  As for the food, we split the crispy calamari and mesquite turkey sandwich. The calamari was cooked well, not chewy, and nice and crisp! It was a hefty portion and  served with three different sauces. The sandwich was awesome! It was served on a warm  pretzel bun with a mass amount of turkey, tomato, lettuce, swiss cheese, and dijon aioli. Yum!   Again, with refinement of the service and logistics it would have the potential to be a much better establishment!",

Wanting to enjoy peoplewatching, we sat out on the patio. Our group, as one might guess, consisted of a boxer (me), a bee, a knight, a greek goddess, a beer frau, a Mormon missionary, Smurfette, a pirate wench, a gypsy woman, and a cowboy. Obviously.  We sat down, waiting for our server.  And waited.  And waited.  And double-checked inside, considering for Halloween it was pretty slow and the cover band wasn't that good.  And waited.  Finally coming out was our zombie waitress, who for her part was quite apologetic, saying floor plans had been changed and she had not been notified. We gave our drink orders, and BEE-lite Emily split a basket of fries with me.  And we waited.  And waited.  Then another waitress came out and tried to take our drink order. We were quizzical. If this is a Halloween prank I don't enjoy it! I put my drink order in again, but then Good Sir Hector said that we had already put in our orders and were waiting for them.  And we continued waiting.  Then my drink order came out from the pirate waitress, separate from everyone else. I settled the tab, puzzled.  Then our full drink order came out with my order repeated. I sure as hell am not going to pay for them again! Our fries were pretty blah too.  From all the reviews I've been reading this is a pretty good place on Fremont Street, but it wasn't a very good first impression from me.",

We walked up and down Fremont Street to see what was hoppin and nothing was really what we were looking for.  There was the piano bar \"Dont tell Mama\" that we had been thinking about trying and a comedy show at \"Beauty Bar\", the chill vibe with Juke tunes at the \"Griffin\" but nothing that really struck our mood.  We completely missed this place on our first round as bar next door had their music (journey and the like) pumpin' out into the street.    We stopped right in front of Hennessy's to debate what we were going to do and then we SAW the band inside and realized that we were standing right in front of an Irish Pub.  Can't go to wrong with that, right?  So we decided to go on in and check it out.  We took a seat at a table by the stage and each ordered a Guinness.  The band \"Darby O'Gill and the Little People\" were playing and bantering back and forth.  SO MUCH FUN!  They made the evening. Great musicianship, great vocals, fun banter and a great mix of music... everything from Flogging Molly and Dropkick Murphy's to Jeff Buckley, Neil Diamond and Fleetwood Mac.  The service was decent, prices were decent, the place was clean but there were no hand towels in the restroom all night long.  That was kind of a bummer.  All in all I will definitely go back and on a Friday night as I hear that same band has a regular gig there. Great way to spend a low key Friday Night.",

And it doesn't seem to matter if it's early evening outside on a 1/2 empty patio or inside at the bar on St. Patrick's Day.    The last time we were outside on the patio, which was about 3/4 full after work, happy hour-ish, and it took 20 minutes before a waitress even acknowledged us, another 5 before she came back to take our order (3 beers and 2 shots), and a good 15 or so before the drinks came out.  We contemplated getting the order in for the second round when she delivered the first one but thought \"nah, how bad could it be?\".  Well, the drinks were drained and we sat for another 10 minutes after that before she came back by to see if we wanted more, and then it was seriously 10 after that before they were delivered.  So, we had been there an hour and hadn't even had the opportunity to get two rounds of drinks consumed.  (And they were just not that busy and not that understaffed.  The entire indoors was empty and there were hosts/hostesses/waitstaff standing around chatting in the doorway.)  There are so many better options out there.",

I expressed my desire for the free burger.  One would expect they would at least go ahead and make that second burger once you let them know you are interested.  Better yet they should offer and make it since it is advertised openly.  When my food came out I thought okay maybe they are making it and will bring it out when I'm done.  I really want to go ahead and give it to one of the less fortunate out here.  To my surprise when I asked for it 20min after my food came and I had finished eating, the waitress says oh what burger would you like we didn't make it yet.  Keep in mind it already took forever for them to make the first burger.  Save your money and go somewhere else.",

My meal was the prime rib dip which again, super bland. My wife had a burger that was ok. Our waitress was nice enough but had a very strange demeanor to her. To be expected for Fremont St I suppose",

Environment: located right at the entrance of the Fremont street experience, it is pretty wild and exciting with some very unique individuals just outside. The restaurant itself is a little loud, it looks old but is still family friendly and probably open to mostly tourist.  Service: the staff are all friendly and quick to serve, although I was at the bar mostly.   Drinks: I didn't have any food. But I really liked the Moscow mule and Bloody Mary. The drinks are cheap and they almost have a deal daily.   This place does appear a bit old, and do to its touristy nature, it is not super clean. The drinks are good, but nothing particularly stood out to me. I can see this spot as a fun place to drink a lot with friend and have a good social time, but nothing extravagant.",

    "text": "I came into Hennessey's Tavern with a few out-of-towners on Sunday night and was shocked to see only us in the entire place. In the past I've avoided this bar because it was always so busy.  Not that I am complaining.  I'd rather be in a (relatively) quiet place any how.  The music was a little loud but it was some good rock music so I didn't mind the volume.  It got more quiet when the one man band, a guy with an acoustic guitar, started playing to the mostly empty house.  He played mostly 90s era alternative music.  He wasn't half bad.  He even took requests.  Well, kind of. One member of my group asked him to play some Five For Fighting.  He did his best but admitted he did not know all the words.  I couldn't tell, honestly.  Then we started messing with him and my friends 11 year old son.  We told the kid to request \"Safety Dance.\"  We got the best response from the singer when he said \"No. What? No. No.\"  Oh, the laughs we had.  He got the joke and said he liked us.  That we were funny.  It was awesome.  On to the most important part, the food and drink.  Two of us ordered a pint of Guiness Blonde. Not a bad beer.  I would have preferred a darker beer but did not want to go so far as a stout. The blonde was refreshing regardless of the light color.  Also ordered was a root beer, a Sprite and a lemonade.  As for the food, two shepherds pies, a mushroom burger (mine of course), a regular burger with all the filler and a western burger minus most of the filler.  The food was good.  A lot of flavor.  Hot and fresh.  A fair price too.  About $12-13 for the burgers which on Fremont and Las Vegas Blvd isn't that bad.  The beer price shocked me.  $10 for a pint! That was a bit much but as I mentioned, Fremont and Las vegas Blvd.  I guess that is to be expected.  Service was neither good nor bad.  Our server wasn't overly attentive nor was she a ghost.  She took our order.  She brought our order.  She brought our check.  And she even split it for us. I can't really complain about her since our needs were met.  Though another glass of water would have been appreciated.",

It's conveniently located near the hotels where most of us stayed, and the large, nicely decorated room was very comfortable for our gathering of 50 adults and 8 children.  It was an afternoon event, so we had a selection of appetizers and an open bar. Jennie, Sandy, and Diana, who tended the buffet table and bar, were efficient, friendly, polite, and responded to our every request. Jim Hensley, the General Manager, was there if we needed him, and he and staff member Andrew worked with me the previous afternoon to make sure the AV equipment played our HD video properly on their big screen.  The appetizers were very good; the private bar, which included Guinness and Magner's on tap, was great. This was a Celebration of Life for my \"very Irish\" late husband. The Claddath Room at Hennessey's was perfect for our event; it could not have been better.",

The place was dead for starters, then it took forever for the waitress to even come and acknowledge us.   When we were ordering drinks, the waitress didn't even know the drink that we ordered. She was like \"What's that\"???   Obviously management don't teach their employees the drink menu, or anything about taking care of customers for that matter. We ordered waters as well and those never came. We had to ask again. All the while, all of the waitresses and staff were goofing off and dancing over by the bar. Not serving their customers. (The Only time she was attentive was when she was leaving for the night, and wanted to let us know, and asked if we wanted to cash out now) We ordered the Irish Nachos, and French Onion soup appetizers. TOTALLY GROSS!! The cheese on the French Onion soup wasn't even broiled or melted on top. It was as if they threw it on after the fact. The Irish potato nachos were so soggy and greasy. They were practically raw, and so disgusting!  I would never recommend this place to anyone. Service - CRAP Food-CRAP Knowledge - CRAP Prices - CRAP Atmosphere - CRAP  Go elsewhere...

No Full Irish, although they had plenty of other breakfast options. But I decided to skip the oh-so-Irish huevos rancheros, spinach scramble, and breakfast burrito and get a salad instead.  The Thai sesame ahi was pretty good, although the tuna was overcooked and the chef needs to practice his knife skills. (BIG chunks of cucumbers and peppers that could have used a little more finesse.) At $15 for the salad and $3.75 for an iced tea, this was a pretty pricey lunch and not worth the expense.  Yeah, I didn't get Irish food or even have a beer, so this review might be different if I had stuck with the standard fare. But all the signs for their special reuben burger had \"Guinness\" spelled wrong (\"Guiness cheese sauce,\" anyone?), so I figured they probably didn't put much care into that either.",

The staff here is friendly, the drinks are good, and the menu is simple but of all the places to eat in Downtown Fremont, i find these burgers stand out more than the rest in the area.  [Special shout out to Flippin Good Burgers - you're neck and neck in my book with these guys!]  The restaurant is indoors and outdoors, so whether you want to stay or eat out on the lanai and watch the people and street entertainment - it's great to have those options.  The Blue Cheese Burger is a favorite of mine - I love the gooey-ness of the cheese!  The slider sampler is great as well and the Hawaiian burger is another delicious option!  Now, there are a few different choice of French Fries to choose from also! My favorite is the garlic parmesan fries - be forewarned though, it's really really garlicky!  I would recommend breath mints after! lol  Also, please know it's 2 for one burgers every Tuesday! Bring your friends or family and enjoy this burger special!  i don't have a review for any of the other menu items....it's about that Burger life....  Enjoy!  :]",

After tearing it up all afternoon at the Great Vegas Beer Festival I needed something to soak up all the IPA in my belly. What better way to accomplish that without sharing when it comes up than a big ole greasy burger.    My friends recommendation to come to Hennessy's Tavern and now I am glad we stopped.  After being seated rather quickly surprising.... after beer fest ended at 7 pm on a Saturday and the 1000's were released to their own devices to make it somewhere to continue the party or safely make it home.  The service was quick and attentive by our server who we had rush right to ordering beverage and food at the same time because we came hungry and did not require the other formalities of a traditional dining experience.    We were simple and order cheese burgers and fries which came out really quickly. What made this a five star burger was that it was cooked to perfection Medium and was so flavorful and juicy.  This honestly was one of the best burgers I have had in Vegas.  Everything from the meat to the bun and veggies was delicious and that was not the booze talking.  Both my friend and I concurred that this was a really good burger.  The fires were not outstanding but were a decent thick cut fry. Another thing about this was experience was that the prices were not ridiculous. Many times on the strip you expect to pay 15+ for a decent patty, here they were like $11 which was fair.   The bus person was really attentive during our service and continued to make the rounds to clear what he could from the tables very kindly and efficiently.  I had a great first experience at Hennessy's Tavern and if they keep cooking great flavorful burgers like that I will happy to refer others.  Great Job!",

He said the bartender must have not seen the drink ticket. I told him to get a new bartender who was attentive. Manager didn't care and made up excuses for the poor service. The only reason why this place can survive is the location for tourists. I wonder how much money they consistently loose due to its poor service and a manager who doesn't care. The owner needs to be involved to stop the madness. I'm sure there is tons of product being wasted and expenses out of control only to be made up through volume because no one understands cost structure, customer service, and activity based costing.....Nitwits!",

So we did, as soon as we walked in there we got yelled at from the bartenders they specifically said TAKE A HIKE!! WERE CLOSED!! GET OUT OF HERE! as he was saying that, the other female bartenders chimed in to say the same thing at this point I'm mortified. we were just trying to let them know someone gave us the okay to come in and JUST USE THE RESTROOM. I've never felt so embarrassed in all my life. I get it, you're closed but don't treat your customers like that we're locals and you didn't even let us explain.

    "text": "This week I'm going to skip covering some of the newly-opened restaurants in town to deal with another place that boldly advertises its burger as \"voted best burger in Las Vegas\" on a colorful banner right on the corner of Fremont St and Las Vegas Blvd. I'm definitely not aware of everything going on in town burger-wise, but by being the self-titled 'burger guy' for Vegas I'm fairly aware of most contests that would elect such a title. So when my coworker pointed out one day that Hennessey's had such a banner on their patio, I just had to look into this. I've had a couple folks suggest their burgers over the years, but it just hasn't been a priority with so many more popular and generally accepted places to try. But being a glutton for punishment and fulfilling my self-induced duties, I headed over to see if they could offer a contender for the best burger in town.  For those unfamiliar with the Fremont St area, Hennessey's is your typical generic 'Irish' pub with cheap drinks, cheap food, and the average sub-Strip tourist crowd. The interior is dark, dirty, smoky, and undoubtedly loud on weekends when they're packed and a band is playing. During the day you will have a mix of locals on their lunch breaks along with some tourists, during the evenings you can expect a slightly louder, less refined crowd. There is also a patio for you to dine on while you take in all the lovely sights and characters walking by. Their extensive menu features just about any type of food you can mention, and I won't even bother listing it all here.  As for their burger offerings, they do have quite a selection on their menu, and maybe even more than most dedicated burger joints in town. With 15 pre-designed burgers and even more options, this is certainly a substantial group, yet I still went with a simple favorite of mine: the mushroom burger. The bun was ok; fresh, not too dry and well-proportioned to the patty. The patty had slight char flavor, but it was super generic and overcooked with no seasoning or good beefy flavor. The mushrooms were just ok too, and didn't have much flavor. The cheese was there but I didn't taste it. This was definitely not the best in Vegas, and not even the best on Fremont Street.  The fries were oily and generic, although most of them were cooked well. While I usually eat almost all of my fries with a burger meal, these weren't quite good enough for me to do so this time. They do offer a decent deal on Tuesdays with two-for-one burgers, but I'm still not sure this is really worth it. Our two burgers came to $13.30 which I guess isn't a bad deal when there are definitely more expensive and worse burgers around the area, but I'd really like to know who exactly voted in this contest.",

Booze soaked maws, whiskey samplers, and the sonic reverberation of live music come out. And don't forget the ridiculous shot specials that pulverize your liver with the power of a liquid gavel. Sometimes it's difficult to understand your what your friend is saying over the symbol crashing and the glass clacking, but that's why necks were built to nod.   They also make bastardized grub that was meant for hangovers. Captain Crunch French toast is an actual menu item waiting to enrobe your taste buds. And if you're not in the mood to consume some starch, there's always the chance of seeing two girls fight over some swarthy dude at the bar. People really channel the Irish when they're here.  If you're downtown, you owe it to yourself to check out some of these amazing drink deals and general mayhem.",

Drink orders were mixed up and our large order of french fries took about 45 minutes to come out.   Great location and typically when I come the service is much better, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that the Halloween crowd slowed them down a bit.

This was the second time I've eaten at this place - the first time was better, but over five years later - I'd forgotten my previous disappointing experience. 3/4 empty on busy Freemont Street should have been a clue. Wake up Jeffy!!  Poor service. Warm \"iced tea\" after I requested a refill....killed any remaining ice. Ordered the fish & chips with the fries made like one of their appetizers - Garlic/Parmesan. Sounded great, but the garlic was visible on the fries and the cheese was clumped like it wasn't grated fresh. The fish was overcooked and was not fresh, but frozen planks! Yuk, reminded me of mom's attempt to do fish-sticks for a quick meal when I was 8 or a replication of the junior high lunchroom. Overall, I'm more disappointed in myself for staying after it took 10+ minutes to place my order, but more so, \"How could they still be open?\" I want to be more positive in my Yelps, but this was a horrible meal and overpriced. McDonalds would have been better.",

No thanks to this Irish run I've had this year (Irish food, Irish men, the little stout of Guinness at the Irish Bank, Irish leprechauns) stopping at Hennessey's Tavern was a must.

We were there on a lunch hour lull, so we were able to get the seats right up back to the wall, with stools and a nice comfortable bench.  Looks like on an evening, they have live bands performing.   I had been craving a salad since my eating habits here were so horrid.  I ordered the Cobb Salad and it was huge.  A huge platter of chopped romaine lettuce decorated with large strips of cheese, turkey, blue cheese, tomatoes, and avocado with ranch dressing.  While I was busy with this order, I managed to sneak a few of my friend's onion rings.  Mmmmm.  Now this was True beer batter.  Typical pub food served by cheery waitstaff in tartan check skirts.

So overall, I feel this is a great little spot to hang out with friends and enjoy some cold beer and Jameson shots. It really feels like a real local bar trapped in a tourist trap.

    "text": "Just got back from this place and it was mediocre at best.  While we were greeted quickly and our drink orders were taken in a reasonable amount of time, it took almost 15 minutes to get our two draft beers.  We should have taken that as a sign and left then but decided to order.  Over 20 minutes later we finally had our burger and sandwich.  The kicker was they were not even busy on this Sunday night and no explanation was ever offered as to why things were taking so long.  To top it off, the food was simply OK.  We should have bypassed this place and gone down to the Triple 7 for some good food.",

    "text": "I want to give this place a better rating, I really do - but it seems like they just don't want one.  This Irish-themed pub seems packed full of potential, but seems to fall short on speed and service.  My fiance and I went here this past Tuesday for their 2-4-1 Burger special after he got off work.  Good deal?  For Downtown, I guess it is - the burgers start at $10.40 but average $11.35.  Honestly, I cannot imagine paying this for EACH burger any other night.  The service was extraordinarily slow, and from talking with a friend we didn't experience something out of the norm.  I guess if you don't mind waiting for your food for half an hour or so, then this might be the place for you.  As far as the burger goes, I would honestly prefer Red Robin or even Chili's.  They are definitely not special, and not of any abnormally large size.  The side of fries that it comes with is pretty meager, and they are probably a bit tastier than the actual burger.  My pickle that came with it was sweetish.  That's just awkward.  Even after finishing our meal, it took a long time to get boxes and the check, then even MORE time for our waitress to take said check.  There's a lot of other places Downtown - don't be afraid to pass this place or use it as a back-up choice.",

    "text": "Just got back from Vegas and my experience at Hennessey's  Tavern was still on my mind.   I had eaten there 2 years ago and had a pretty decent meal so why not return right?  I also asked 4 friends who were visiting Vegas from NY to join me.  Good idea, right?  Not so much.   I arrived with my party of 3 and informed the wait staff  that another 4 people would be arriving shortly .  I told the \"hostess\" that I wanted to sit on the patio so I needed two tables set up with flatware to ensure that people arriving would not help themselves to our tables. They dismissively told me to just find two tables.  I waited, and waited and WAITED and no one came out to set up.  I got up again, went inside where servers were conglomerated  & happily chatting away. (There was ample staff considering that the place was nearly empty on a Monday night. )  A few minutes later, a female server with a brace on her hand put 7 sets of silverware on the table.  I asked her to bring out the menus so that we could browse them while we waited for the others to arrive.  We WAITED AND WAITED... no menus.  I asked a person in my party to go inside and ask for menus again.  My guest returned with the menus in hand and commented that the servers were just hanging out and chatting and could not understand why the menus had not been brought out.  I struggled with touching the menus  which were so sticky and dirty that I opened them by touching a teeny-tiny corner.  I immediately thought that if the menus were  this  dirty, I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like.  Couldn't those lingering servers wipe down the menus?  I've seen it done in restaurants all the time---but clearly not in this one!   After our party  of 4 arrived, we ordered our food and waited and waited and waited for our food to arrive. Each time we asked the server about the food, her answer was the same---It'll be right out!  .....Yeah, right.   Here are the highlights of our 7 orders:   Turkey burger & Fries, Bacon Burger & fries:  Fries so salty that they could not be eaten.  I tasted the fries and could not believe that this could be the work of a chef.  I dreaded the possibility that these fries had been salted by a prior customer and that they were recycled fries.  Ugh!!!   Everyone who had a burger said it was just OK, but definitely would not come back for one.  Fish & Chips:  A little steep at $15 but it included 3 filets of cod.  Fries were not cooked well done as I explicitly requested.  I mentioned it  to  the waitress and was told that she would have new fries for me -- this promise was accompanied by a doe-eyed apology.  This french fry saga would continue throughout the evening.   One of my guests asked for a beer before ordering dinner but she had almost finished her meal and still no beer.  Of course, the waitress apologized once again.  Apologies seemed to be the theme of the evening.    25 minutes later my well done fries had not arrived.  When I told my server I still didn't have my fries , she seems surprised & shocked by it.--\"You didn't get your fries??\"   So who else, pray tell, should have known if my fries had been brought out to my table???  So then she asks me if I want the re done fries to which I answered, Yes! Yes! I want fries with my fish filets!!   I don't get it.  I ordered fish & CHIIPS. CHIPS meaning french fries. So she says \"OK, I'll be back in 5 minutes\"  20 minutes later my party is ready to pay their bill and she shows up with my tab and NO FRIES.  She opted for giving us a discount on our tab rather than giving me the fries which I had been waiting all evening long.   And then, unbeknownst to me, the evening's entertainment was about to begin.  Wow,  a bonus.  Free entertainment.           Two drunks came flying out of the bar and land on the deck where we were seated.  Yelling, pummeling, more yelling, more pummeling.  Wait, wait, do I see my server who weighs about 80 pounds with a brace on her hand joining in on the pummeling?  How brave... how stupid!   She yelled at one of the drunks accusing him that he had thrown a drink at her.  So let me see, you over-serve drinks to your patrons  to make money and you are surprised by the results??  My guests were scrambling  to get out before the drunks included them in their MMA bout.  I for one was practically cowering in a corner like a scared rabbit.   So, nice going Hennessey's Tavern.  You managed to screw up what started as a perfectly good evening in Vegas.  The sad part is for the owner who will probably be out of business before you know it because the totally incompetent, lackadaisical servers and a kitchen gone wrong.",

I already got a plastic cup from them with a splash of water in it.  So when I asked for my vodka & soda, I requested that it be put into the same plastic cup and specifically said \"I really just hate wasting plastic, so if you could just use the same cup,  that'd be awesome \" I wasn't rude or demanding,  I was just an average eco-friendly customer.  Well, the reaction from the bartenders to my request was extremely rude,  to say the least.  They threw the cup away and then continued to take out new plastic cups (at least 10 but probably more like 20) and kick them toward each other and the trash and said stuff like \"the folks at the plastic factory are working overtime tonight.\" It was COMPLETELY uncalled for.  Not only was it environmentally appalling but if I ran a business that had employees disrespecting my customers and my merchandise that way,  I would probably reconsider my staff. The whole experience was disgusting and I will never forget how disappointing it was.",

The server came and told me it would be a few minutes for the kitchen to \"remake the order\".  I said not a problem.  Nachos were brought seemingly without sour cream.  Halfway through my mouth started tingling and  I noticed several underlying chips had sour cream.  Someone called the waitress for me and I pointed out the sour cream.  She got the manager.  He came with no apologies.  I told him I was going to take a Benedetto in case I needed to go to the doctor.  He said it was my responsibility to inform them if there's an allergy.  I disagreed and said my medical history is private and it's their responsibility to fulfill an order correctly.  He raised his voice at me and said actually it's your job to let us know if you have an allergy.  I then told him HIPPA protects my privacy and I was simply letting him know the situation.  He continued to raise his voice at me in front of customers and I asked for the owners information.  He then said you're the one coming at me threatening a lawsuit which was totally unTrue.  I tried to restate what I'd said about taking a Benadryl and he turned his back and walked away.  He returned with his name and the contact info and said not a problem the owner loves me tell him whatever.  I again restated about the allergy medicine and suggested he study the laws under HIPPA.  He left me with a handwritten paper with his info (picture attached since he obviously doesn't concern himself with privacy) and walked away yelling he did not need to study anything.  Sad this business will continue regardless of public health, safety, or management simply due to their location.  I hope they don't continue these unhealthy practices as someone with more severe reactions to allergens may not walk away on Benadryl alone!",

This was my first time eating there and I asked one of the guest that attended how the food was and was told the Irish food is awful.   Anyway I ordered the fish and chips my wife the salmon, the fish and chips were burned to a crisp and the salmon dry very bad and expensive.  I hate to say this but long john silvers has better fish and chips for a fraction of the price.  The waitress was so so more interested in getting a tip then being a server the only thing reasonable there was the smithwicks beer I drank very sad for a downtown bar, but to each his own for me there are more local places to go to better and cheaper.  no I wont be back thanks",

The hostess told us to find a table \"wherever\" so we did, and after waiting 20 minutes a waitress finally stopped by to hand us a menu and inform us that our \"real waitress\" would be there shortly. Another 10 minutes and she appeared. Drinks came fast but they never wiped our table from the previous diners like they said they would, and when my food (a patty melt - medium) came, it was burned to a crisp. I couldn't even complain about it because it was dropped off too quickly and the waitress never reappeared until we flagged her down to get our check.

    "text": "March 14&15, 2014 Probably the worst experience I've ever had in my lifetime.  You would think because of St. Patrick's Day weekend that they would have been a little more prepared for the crowds considering they are an Irish pub.      Lunch on the 14th (2 adults), service was horrible.  They were out of things and the tables outside were dirty. They seemed to just be completely unorganized and unprepared.     Unwanting by me after the lunch we had, we ate dinner on the 15th (8 adults), service was the worst I have ever experienced in my lifetime.  We sat outside and ordered our food on what was a very busy night.  Everyone was very hungry from a long day of bar hopping at a beer crawl in which this bar was on the list.  I understand it was busy, but no one should ever have to wait for over an hour for food anywhere anytime with no explanation.  When questioning the management why it was taking so long, they had no idea and they were very rude.  They were completely unorganized and their lack of leadership and communication with their staff was non existent.  One of the people in my party got very upset and went inside to talk to Mgmt.  I have no idea what happend as it still isn't clear to me from either side.  Unfortunately after this, management decided we all needed to be kicked out due to their behavior.  I calmly went back to ask what was going on and if our food could be sent out.  I asked if it would be ok if that one person could just be asked to leave.  They said they would send out our food in \"to go\" boxes and that we all had to leave with no explanation.  My order did not show up and really only 2 things came out in \"to go\" boxes.  I went back again to ask where my order was and they proceeded to tell me my order was sent to the wrong table to begin with and they couldn't do anything for me.  After much anger on my part for how we'd been treated and lack of service on their part, they tried to offer coupons for a later date.  I proceeded to tell them that I have no need for that because I am from out of town and I would never be eating there again.  In no way did they ever offer me something else to eat or offer to correct their horrible behavior and lack of service. Nor did they appologize for anything.  If the food wouldn't have taken over an hour and if it was sent to our table correctly none of this would have occured.   Get your shit together Hennesy's!!!!  Never ever ever will I eat at this place again.",

We came here during our most recent vacation and were very excited to try the \"World's Largest Pint Glass.\" (Turns out it's half the price on Monday happy hour so we decided to grab lunch and come back later).   Looking for something simple because we were going to be walking around, I ordered the Grilled Cheese and Soup. My boyfriend ordered the French Dip. When it arrived, he took one bite and immediately sent it back. (Keep in mind, we have been dating over a YEAR and he has never sent a meal back.)    Because we were on a schedule, we decided just to split my meal and get something later. After we had paid, the manager came by and asked if there was anything they could do about the sandwich. (Having worked in a restaurant, I know if he sincerely wanted to help us, he would have come by during the half hour we shared a small sandwich and cup of soup.)   A FEW HOURS LATER BOTH MY BOYFRIEND AND I WERE VIOLENTLY ILL for the remainder of the evening.  We miss the show we bought tickets for, took turns taking over the bathroom and miss out on an entire night in Vegas.   Don't make our mistake. Hennessey's is a disaster and the only thing I'll ever want from them again is a refund on my trip.",

I'm still sure that the burger meat is coming from a frozen patty, but they've been adding a little spice and flavor to the burger options.  I had the Southwest burger last time and they put some kick into the burger.  Some nice jalapenos and pepper jack cheese as toppings.  I'm absolutely a fan of that burger.    And they've chosen tastier buns--they've stepped up and are using a nice, fresh sourdough.  The chips that come standard with the burgers are also a little more rustic and flavorful.  Not bad.  The pub food's becoming downright worthwhile.",

Because of Hennessey's was open and one of the first stops after the finish line, this place became the post-run hang out.  At least 75% of the guest were covered with orange, blue, yellow, and green.  This tavern is fairly big, but today's seating was limited with the amount of runners/walkers from the Color Run. Service today was just okay, not like the the great service that they usually have.   I didn't drink on this visit but got something to eat. My meal was just chicken tenders and fries. I wasn't in the mood for anything heavy and the chicken tenders hit the spot.  Taste is just average. In fact, I think I could have gotten the same thing at Carl's Jr.  However, I'm not complaining. As long as I can eat, I'm a happy camper.    Today was just one of those off days for Hennessey's because of Color Run. I've been here before and the ambiance/service has always been top notch.",

Day 2, we came in at a reasonable time the cool thing was the server remembered us from the night before and met us with a friendly \"Hi, you guys came in last night!\"   This bar has a cool atmosphere and charm. My boyfriend got the pub club; I got the Dublin Burger, and garlic fries. Normally, I take pics of my food but my phone died shortly after my check-in. Our food was amazing, cooked well, and flavorful. I think that I am in danger of becoming a regular now that I live out here,  but that's not a bad thing-I'm a fan",

    "text": "Hungover and starving, we decided to hit up this popular watering hole for some comfort pub food. We walked in to find the place to be pretty empty, with just another couple sitting at the bar.  It didn't feel or look anything like an Irish pub. There was even hip hip music playing in the background.   Since we didn't learn our lesson from the night before, we both decided that the best way to cure our hangovers was to drink more. LOL!   ***my apologies for the poor pic qualities*** MIMOSA ($6.25, $4 until 1pm every Sat & Sun): Didn't taste much alcohol in this at all. Fail. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eSLwC2iFJOU4UWXyuPiTpg?select=NvBVhAvB7Lr_RNJPIOzQ-Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eSLw...</a>  BLOODY MARY ($6.25, $4 until 1pm every Sat & Sun):  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eSLwC2iFJOU4UWXyuPiTpg?select=dhUPZM9k1Q7eeWigSyWE7w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eSLw...</a>  Rather disappointing since this was suppose to be rated as being one of the best Bloody Mary in town (and at their other California locations). It's listed on the menu as \"HENNESSEY'S FAMOUS BLOODY MARY\".  Yeah. I didn't taste any vodka in this one either. The tomato juice seemed old and flat.  I had to request (and pay an additional $8.25) for another shot of Ketal Vodka to be mixed into my drink.   GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH & TOMATO BISQUE ($10): <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eSLwC2iFJOU4UWXyuPiTpg?select=Q8DqufYMSQKeG6Bgp2qw1g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eSLw...</a> I got a bite of Bud's sammie and thought it was pretty tasty. There was a good amt of Irish cheddar, swiss & jack cheese in the sandwich. The bowl of tomato bisque was just okay. I was missing the familiar tang that is expected in a good bowl of tomato soup, also a touch of salt would've helped.  CARNE ASADA BENEDICT ($9.95): <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eSLwC2iFJOU4UWXyuPiTpg?select=LI7NsJFdbsqH3BB9-4Egmw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eSLw...</a> The grilled steak was nicely seasoned and cooked to the right med rare doneness.  The bad part about this dish was that it was overall dry due to the eggs being overcooked, it sucks not having enough egg yolk or salsa to help soften up the dish.   The home fries were nice and crispy though.  Overall, it was just okay for us. The menu looked great but failed on execution and flavors for the most part. Maybe we weren't the only ones hungover that day.",

On a Monday night , which is a very slow night for Freemont . But we were a big party . Which I took into consideration, but there seemed to be an awful amount of waiting around .   we waited at least 15 minutes for our table to be cleared off for us to sit down(it was already empty when my half of the party showed up while the other half had already been waiting , so it's not like the people before us just left) . Then we sat down && it was at least another 15 minutes before anyone even talked to us . The entire night was basically waiting around for our waitress . When we got our food we asked for napkins& my grandpa asked for a Diet Pepsi , I waited 25 minutes & went and got some from the bar , because In that 25 minutes , we hadn't seen our waitress once && he finally got his drink about 35 minutes after asking .   Other than the ridiculous amount of waiting around . The bartender was great ( we even came back later in the night just to order some more drinks from her ) and the food was pretty good .",

The bartenders are on point and know how to pour a proper pint. You can get a 32 oz. Guinness here which is great!  Very cool private room in the back for special events if you are so inclined. My only gripe is that you can't get a Half and Half on draft (no Harp on draft). Also, why is it so hard to find Murphy's on draft (or even available) in Irish themed bars? I personally find Murphy's to be much tastier than Guinness, but that is just this one girl's opinion.",

First clue of how our dining experience would turn out should have been the awful service we were receiving so far.   I ended up ordering their prime rib sliders and everyone else ordered sandwiches, wraps, and burgers.  The food arrived and my disappointment continued.   The sliders looked as if someone angry in the kitchen was handling these smashed up buns. These were not by far a prime rib sliders but more like thinly sliced roast beef things.   The live entertainment was incredibly loud for just the few of us dining here tonight, the services was awful and the food did not make up for any of it tonight.",

My boyfriend, myself, and our two teens were exploring Freemont Street during the early afternoon and we were absolutely starving. There wasn't much around for food so we decided to try Hennessey's. After being told to find our own seats we waited at least 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. When our server finally decided to get our drink order, she walked away before my boyfriend had a chance to tell her what he wanted. It took 15 minutes for 3 sodas and a water! Our food (when it FINALLY arrived) was cold, bland, and over cooked. All of our fries were cold and soggy, the burgers were dried out and the pretzel bun was stale. We asked for a side of ranch for our daughter's fries and it arrived when we were halfway done. Our server was curt and indifferent to us: as evidence by the fact that we received no drink refills and had to ask a passing bus boy for our bill. The fastest part of our visit was cashing out. The server could've cared less about us and obviously had better things to be doing than her job.",

I'm sure they probably don't, but it tasted like freshly made in-house bread. It came with some homemade chips (which were honestly too hard to eat) but they gave me a huge pile of them. The waitress was super friendly, as was the additional staff that walked by and checked on us. My only complaint is that they don't have misters and I was sweating on my seat. I know it was my choice to sit outside (great spot for people watching) but misters should be something all restaurants have in this town.",

Major thanks to Q for introducing me to Grey Goose Pear, with soda and a splash of 7 up.      The Irish band was good as well, lots of Irish spin on some well known songs.  The only reason I give it 4 and not 5 was the food was kinda meh.  We had the frings and Irish nachos and they were your run of the mill midnight bar food.

We found a surprising dearth of the latter, unless you count the places that are hidden in the casinos and advertise $8.99 rib dinners. So, we went into Hennessey's. We are Irish pub fans so it seemed like a good deal.   I ordered a glass of wine, and, for the first time in about twenty years, I was carded! [Ok. It's not like the waitress pretended my forty-something self might be less than twenty-one. She apologized and said she knows it's silly, but she has to card everyone. Still, I thought it was kinda fun.]   My husband ordered a lemonade. The waitress immediately told him it did not come with free refills. He said that was fine. When he took his first sip, he found out why. He said it was homemade and very, very yum. Her ordered a second glass.   My husband ordered the potato-crusted salmon, which he reported to be quite tasty. I ordered the chicken pasta (with mushrooms in a cream sauce), which was also very tasty and the serving was so large, I could not finish.   Prices were a tad high in the real world, but very reasonable for Vegas. Atmosphere was friendly and relaxed. Well worth the stop-in.",

It was awesome, they put their Irish Roots into the covers with fiddles and tambourines, very cool. Everyone in the pub was in good spirits. Only downfall was the drinks were a little pricey for shots and beers, compared to the specials down the strip.

I found myself taking advantage of the nice Samuel Adams Oktoberfest mug deal (more beer for same price I guess) but Guinness and others were a premium price.  I don't think I'm being stingy - Fremont is normally known for better bargains, for thrifty vacationers like myself.  As I noticed the huge Bass Ale light sign outside when leaving I really felt like a tourist who got suckered.  Oh well.  At least my server was pleasant.",

A different waitress introduced herself and confirmed our order about five minutes after that but she had the order backwards.  A few minutes later our drinks were poured and set up at the waiters station to be delivered.  That's as far as the got.  We watched our beers get warm and flat for easily ten minutes and no one brought them to us.  I felt that we became invisible.  Our food order was never taken.  We saw another couple sit and leave because no one even talked to them.  The restaurant was not crowded and there were several employees there. Our drinks didn't come so we left.",

We spent a good portion over at the Arcade further down and decided to stop here for a meal.  The beer list was nice, they had baby Guinness shots which were fun, especially if girls do not like beer.  The food was sub par for me.  We tried a variety of menu items.  You are in Vegas so there are A LOT of places to eat. If you want a quick, somewhat cheap bite and some beers this is a fun place to come.  The waitress was awesome. She was very energetic and helped with the drink selections.  The best part was that they had trivia night when we were there. It is free to play which is a plus. It definitely keeps you at the bar for a couple hours to spend some more on drinks.  We sat outside so it was nice to people watch, talk, and try our hand at trivia.  Not sure if I would come back ONLY because we do not spend time at Freemont anymore. All in all it was a good time.",

I was visiting Vegas with my Mom and we found ourselves starving and having to tinkle after our long bus ride.  Hennessey's was the first place we hit so we used the bathroom and grabbed a table.  It took a while to get a server but she was friendly enough when she showed up.  We ordered drinks and we each ordered a burger.  She asked if we wanted to share a burger because they are so big.  We decided to share upon her recommendation. We didn't want to spoil our dinner plans for later.  No lie- It took over an hour for our med. burger.  I think the server forgot to put it in because she came up and apologized for the long wait 45mins or so in.  When our food came, the half/burger was not only tiny but way over cooked. It was dry!  We were emergency starving so we ate the nasty burger and asked for our check.  I would have sent it back but was afraid on how much longer it would take and we wanted to enjoy our Fremont Street experience.",

Food used to be okay and is garbage now. Beer prices are steep and selection sucks. Live entertainment is always average at best and way too loud.

Good people watching from the patio when you step outside to get out of the heat. At least they had a good beer selection.  Would I go back?  Maybe, but I wouldn't walk more than 100 yards for it.

I asked her and explained we had been sitting for a while instead of saying \"let me check on your food\" she started arguing with me saying it had only been 33min since she put in our order and said she had a full restaurant. I completely understand but that's not my problem. Her job is to take care of customers not argue with them. We received our food shortly after and it was cold the cheese was hard I approached her again and she insisted that it was not cold so I told her she can take a bite and try it her self once again she argued and stated I was being \"rude\". I asked to speak to a manager so he came out I explained the situation he took my food didn't offer to replace it with anything else and left me with no plate (at this point I was okay as I was turned off by the behavior) my other friend said the same he took her food threw it in the oven to melt the cheese on her nachos and it came back completely burnt. As all this was happening the lady's were sitting behind the counter calling us \"b***\" in front of everyone. Terrible service. Took them an extra 30min to bring our check the lady kept walking past us we had to ask her to bring it even though it was clear we no longer wanted to be there.  Now this is the kicker, my friend posted her review yesterday the lady who called me a b*** went and responded to her review thinking it was mine. And shortly after deleted it but we took a screenshot so will add here. This is how terrible the service is that they are allowing their own workers to come on yelp and argue with customers.   By the way I did not tell the lady to \"take a bite of my f** sandwich\" && of course that worker wouldn't know because she was not the one standing there.    They are not 5 stars for a reason I should have definitely read the reviews prior as multiple people have stated it's terrible service.",

As soon as we started eating, an acoustic guitarist started playing. He was SOOOO  loud, we could not hear each other. Even the waitress had to ask us several times for our entree order.  Calamari was cold. Not at all crunchy. Chewy like a rubber band. The dips were: nasty jarred tartar sauce, nasty jarred sweet and  sour sauce and a decent spicy aioli. Left most of it on the plate.  The Dublin burger had no flavor. Cooked med. rare as I wanted so that was good. But it was just blah. The fries looked really crunchy. Really brown. But no, cold and soft.

    "text": "Ventured downtown for two for Tuesday's (two for one burgers and two for one breakfast). As someone who was born and raised in the California beach cities I was excited to visit an old favorite from my hometown.  My husband and I went on a Tuesday at lunchtime, obviously a very slow time of day/week for Fremont street. The outdoor patio had a few guests enjoying the beautiful weather but my husband and I opted to sit right inside as the dining room was completely empty.  I started by ordering one of their famous lemonades (without the vodka ) that I had loved so much back in California. I'm not sure if it was because it was just lemonade and not a cocktail but, it just wasn't as delicious as I had remembered. The lemonade was still clearly unique and not from a soda fountain, however I'm not sure it was fresh squeezed. My husband got a draft beer and said it was sub-par. Definitely not worth $10.  We each ordered burgers and were very happy with them. I ordered the Hennessey's Famous Giant burger (a classic style burger) And while very delicious, was no where near giant. My husband ordered the Frisco burger, (served with jack cheese on sourdough) which he enjoyed and seemed to actually be a bit larger than my \"giant\" burger.  The fries were ok, they seemed a little stale but not the worst. Overall the food was good, especially for bar food. I would highly recommend.  This is where our experience went sour, The service was absolutely terrible!!! The patio had a few tables occupied, we were the only guests inside and there had to be about 6 waitresses on staff. (As well as a bartender or two servicing a to- go window and drink orders for tables, the bar top was empty) The waitresses sat at their hostess booth and chatted/gossiped the whole duration of our visit. Which would have been fine given the time of day and week (very slow) however, we were hardly tended to. We were never asked about refills, how our food came out, or even about to-go boxes or the check. One of the bus boys caught on that we were ready to leave after we had sat with empty cups/ dishes for about 15 minutes. In an empty restaurant at that! He brought a box for our leftovers and cleared our table. He even brought a to-go glass of water upon request. Our waitress came over to deliver the check (several minutes later) and made sure to mark/circle on the receipt the tip percentages... HOW TACKY!!! I understand these waitresses probably deal with the worst of the worst when it comes to customers on Fremont Street but that is no excuse for the treatment we received.  I would like to give a special thank you to the bus boy who really tried to help but, I don't believe I'll be back.",

No matter how hard we tried getting them to join us on the fun, they stayed professional. A real big bummer, but also so much respect for them. Thank you for providing us with such great memories and doing such a wonderful job in hospitality. I would definitely recommend  anyone planning a party to have one here. Jeremiah was phenomenal as usual with his performance. He has such a beautiful voice and always makes the hubster happy with his singing and guitar playing. Thank you so so so much Hennessey's!",

    "text": "My friend & I stumbled across Hennessey's Tavern during our exploration on Fremont Street a few weeks back. We came around lunch time on a Sunday & the restaurant was pretty dead with the exception of a few people sitting at the bar.   We were told we could sit anywhere, so after examining the menu we started out with a few brews and ordered our food a few minutes later.   I ordered the The Spicy Lass which is ghost pepper jack cheese, chipotle sauce, lettuce, tomato & avocado. I do enjoy the occasional spicy food but this was absolutely unbearable. It was so spicy I had to drench it in ketchup just to take some of the spice away. I also asked for the burger to be cooked medium and it was practically burnt with absolutely no pink in the center. It basically tasted like flaming hot charcoal. I was extremely disappointed. The fries and my beer were the only reason for the 2 stars.   Service was sub-par with less than an enthusiastic personality. I would not recommend this place and I wouldn't come back.",

Instead I got the grilled chicken club which is a grilled cutlet, applewood smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, avocado & Swiss cheese on sourdough bread.  It was very good, a bit messy, but delicious.  The Irish coffee was also really good.  The waitress was great, attentive and got everything right.  The place was nice.  I'd absolutely go back.",

    "text": "Ok, it was Sunday, Valentines day and the Triple George was not going to be open till 4:00 in the afternoon...  I toyed briefly with the Heart Attack Grill, but we ended up making a hard right and decided to try Hennessey's.  My bad.  I have never seen a place fail so hard and often as this joint. My wife ordered one of their \"special\" Valentines day drinks, the \"Love on the rocks\" (Cherry coolaid or cherry 7-Up with vodka).  It arrived in a cracked glass with a chip out of the rim.  I spotted the crack in the glass from 20 feet away.  How do you miss this, Ms. waitress?  FAIL..  I sent it back.  It arrived back 45 seconds later---meaning the bartender tipped the contents into a fresh glass.  (I watched but didn't see the actual pour as he did the \"new drink\"  below the bar)  Bad practice and a health code violation to boot.  FAIL again.   My drink was an Irish whiskey on the rocks.  The one lonely ice cube they put in the drink cost me an extra buck and a half.  The ice in my glass of water on the table was free.  Go figure.  FAIL again. Guess what, Hennessey's--you are now officially on a roll! The three of us ordered burgers--2 medium rare and one medium.  Meduim means juicy & a hint of pink in the center and med. rare means a band of pink in the center.  All arrived seared black on both sides and brown and completely dry straight thru.  I toyed with the idea of sending all back,  but the wife never sends stuff back unless it is inedible, so we chowed down.  Wife thought the better of her decision a bit later and left half of her burger uneaten on the plate.  FAIL again. The final item for review is the french fries.  They arrived hot and I looked forward to chowing down.  The first bite revealed they were undercooked and mushy. (all 3 orders)  You were all over the place this day, Mr. cook. Overall, this was one of the hardest restaurant fails I have experienced and earns a rare one star from me.  It is kind of irrelevant, but the 6 top in front of us was ordering when we arrived and didn't get their food till 20 minutes after we did.  They noticed, cuz they kept glancing my way till their food arrived.",

I told one of the waitresses and she was like okay.. I waited 5 mins or so to see if she was going to refill it. She didnt. When my food was delivered to me, I told the waitress that I cant eat my food (it was spinach dip and chips) unless I can wash my hands. She said you can go in the middle one it is for employees. So I did and I was able to wash my hands. But seriously it's f**king disgusting when there is no soap in a restroom at an establishment that serves food. Eeeek. They did have live music playing and the band was good. They were from Brooklyn I believe. I would consider coming back in the future but only if they refill their soap dispensers.",

We only had a few drinks, but it looked like they had a decent happy hour on food, which looked to be mostly bar food.  It has a cool vibe, especially since its in a giant glass of Bass.  It's nice that there is a balcony where you can people watch the street, the lights, the zip liners and the crazy people eating at Heart Attack Grill.  Service was decent.  The place is a little dingy and service wasn't spectacular.  However, if you want a dive bar, that's not at all pretentious to grab a few drinks, this fits the bill perfectly.",

Besides you don't need them since the food portions for lunch (burger or sandwich with fries) is so huge. I should also say that if you want nachos, don't get them here. Like I said earlier, mostly just a pile of chips. A waste of money.  Two of us got the burger and fries, cooked just how we ordered them. One got the reuben which was large and full of meat.

First visit was for dinner during Punk Rock Bowling last weekend, the fiancee and I both had the fish and chips which were perfect. The price was right, the portions were satisfying, and the fish was delicious. Not too much batter, but enough to provide the heavy crisp you expect in solid fish and chips. Cole slaw was fresh and not too sweet, tartare sauce was light and lemony. We both decided to indulge on desserts, he had the bread pudding which was hot and topped with ice cream and chocolate sauce. Very delicious. I had the best root beer float I have had since childhood, complete with IBC in a bottle and some pretty amazing ice cream. Today we met for breakfast, I had the Dublin Benedict (corned beef hash subbed for Canadian bacon), and my fella had the Highlander (a southwest inspired plate served with warm tortillas). My breakfast arrived hot and was exactly as good as I wanted it to be. My man said the same. The coffee and juices were equally fresh and delicious and always kept full. Best part of breakfast? When the bill came and we were given BOGO breakfast! I don't know why hat place wasn't packed with people when we both had beverages, full meals, and table s service for about $20! Get it while he getting is good!",

The only time I go there to eat is on Tuesday when they have a 2 for 1 breakfast and burger special. The burgers are nothing great, so I usually opt for the breakfast instead. Their breakfast entrees have a bigger portion, which mean more left over and are more filling.   The service is decent but nothing amazing. They used to have trivia night, but that got discontinued. If you are on Fremont and want to visit, I say go on Tuesday.",

    "text": "So I will review Hennessey's for what a chain is, but this is still well below expectations.  We were a party of 6 on a Sunday evening, place isn't very busy but service was not great.  The food was the biggest disappointment however, with what should be Irish specialties, being the worst.  I had the fish and chips, one of the more expensive dishes on the menu at $16, and when it (finally) got there, 3 really small pieces of fish with cold fries.  Hoping I was the exception, the Reuben was borderline OK, and the salmon one of us ordered was undercooked to the point of being inedible.  The French dips and the mushroom burger were better options, but the food overall was well below what should be served for the price and nobody at the table was happy.  The Black and Tan came out and it was obviously made with a light beer instead of a Harp or Bass. To their credit, we asked them to remake it and it came out better, definitely with the right combo this time.  If you want a quick drink, Hennessey's may be an option but if you're hungry, keep walking down Fremont for other options.  Disappointing start to a Sunday evening we hope will get better!",

The food was nothing special, the only thing I had an issue with about the food is that I ordered the burger with BBQ sauce and it came completely dry and I didn't even have a chance to ask for them to bring me BBQ sauce to add to it because the waitress was never around.

    "text": "This place ranks #4 on my List of Best Irish Pubs in Las Vegas, beaten out by the Nine Fine Irishmen in the New York New York, Ri Ra in the Mandalay Bay, and McMullan's Irish Pub (which is a freestanding pub next to the Orleans Hotel and Casino, a bit west of the strip on Tropicana). This isn't to say that the place isn't a great place to grab a pint (and my favorite spot for Guinness on Fremont Street), though since the whole place is intentionally built to resemble a pint of Bass Pale Ale (which is an English beer, not an Irish one), it naturally ranks lower on the list. The service is pretty good for Fremont Street, a place where more often than not you'll interact with Gene Simmons and Michael Jackson lookalikes for longer amounts of time than you will with your average restaurant server. We never found ourselves without a fresh pint when we needed one, and there was always a smile connected to the hand that brought our beer. The decor is nice and feels moderately Irish, in the same way that the mock-up of the Eiffel Tower in the Paris Hotel and Casino feels moderately Parisian. You know what it's supposed to look like and it does the job. It's not as authentic as my other picks, but if you want the Irish feel instead of the tiki bar nearby, well, this is your spot. The prices are a bit lower than those on the Strip, as is often the deal with Downtown, and though we didn't try the food, what I saw told me that you get a pretty fair deal for what you're paying. If you're looking to go out for some really authentic Irish food, hit up Ri Ra or McMullan's, but if you're just looking for a nice pint of Guinness to complete your day in Downtown, look no further than Hennessey's.",

We got some brews and shots and sat in the back to unwind while a band was doing cover songs (as per my check-in comment, they were covering \"Secret\" by Madonna, which was both unusual but interesting).

Yes, seriously.  Finally, I had an opportunity to make use of it since we had the parents with us (darn those must spend $50 ones!).  We were doing a late lunch downtown after our visit to the Mob Museum and so we wandered in to the World's Largest Pint Glass in the afternoon.  The place was completely dead.  I'm pretty sure we were the only ones in there with exception of the bartenders and waitress.  SCARY!  We picked out a giant booth and started checking out the menus.  Our waitress came over right away to get our drink order and answer questions.  Once the drinks were in hand, we ordered our lunch.  Dad got fish and chips and mom got a club sandwich.  The husband, as usual, got buffalo chicken wings and I ordered the mushroom swiss burger.  The food came out quickly and everything was tasting great.  The only exception was that my mom said the club sandwich was boring.  I loved my burger and that it came with house made kettle chips.  Much better than french fries!  Yea!    Our server was very attentive and kept our drinks refilled.  Even my dad, who is very picky about service was really happy with the waitress.  He even complimented her personally.  The ambiance was Irish pub, kind of dark and Irish music playing.  It was okay.  Overall the food was good, prices were okay, and service was good.  The diet coke was weird tasting.  It was a decent place to eat and I would eat there again, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat there or recommend it.  WHAT CAN THEY DO TO GET FIVE STARS? Tough one.   ~It's kind of dark and old in there, so updates, of course. ~Elevate the food to the prices or maybe bring the prices down just a bit. ~Overall ambiance just wasn't there.  The Irish music was okay, but since nothing was really going on, it was a little weird.  Maybe it would be different at night? ~The husband suggests a stall door that latches closed in the men's room.  haha",

    "text": "This is my spot downtown. I've come here every time I'm in Vegas the past couple of years. The bands are always good and last night the food was spectacular. I judge a place on their calamari, and theirs was great. Not rubbery at all or fishy, but flavorful and perfectly cooked with 3 choices of dipping sauce! I had their simple green salad which came with plenty of feta cheese and a delightful vinaigrette. I nearly licked the plate clean. Our barmaid, Summer was cheerful and efficient! She was the only one behind the bar. Not only did she bring us everything we needed and anticipate our wants and desires, she suffered our indecisiveness, and accommodated our multiple seat changes, and split our tab up with grace and kindness. I'll be back.",

It's pretty solid food, it's not crowded and the staff is on top of orders, checking on the table and keeping drinks refilled.  On this particular visit I ordered the sliders.  Basic sliders so nothing to complain about there.   The couple I was with ordered drinks.  I know it's a tourist spot but $10 for an Irish coffee and $9 for beer seems a bit much.  This isn't the Strip after all. I have a feeling the prices for drinks aren't on the menu because they increase for the holidays and people would think twice about ordering multiple drinks at those prices.  My main complaint is the music.  I don't mind live bands and the band was actually pretty good but this venue and space is not set up for it.  It's just too loud and there is not enough space between the stage and the tables.  You can't even have a conversation at your table because of the music.",

And if we come in just for beer, we usually finish and have to flag someone down for 10 minutes to get a refill or a check. Never mind the fact that a round of beers for three of us is over $30!

    "text": "Sketchy place. Unrolled my napkin to find it had been bundled with a knife, fork and a long hair. Our table was lopsided. Also a little advice to the bartender at Hennessys',  two marachino cherries with ice does not a sangria make. A steak sandwich served with canned mushrooms?Wow. Really? Canned mushrooms? I would have preferred to be told that was all they had - given the option I would have said, no mushrooms. Vegas can get fresh seafood but Hennessys' can't get fresh mushrooms? The fact that the steak was already cut up is shady too. Did I not get the whole steak? The rootbeer float arrived sans rootbeer...ummm ok...The girl who brought it out said she would be right back with it - 10 min later the ice cream had melted in 108 degree weather on the patio. Our waitress took it away and brought us another glass of ice cream with the rootbeer the 2nd time. Our table had a discussion about whether they tried to \"pull a fast one on the tourists\" It was 2 for 1 Tuesday on the burgers. We got our check and noticed we were charged for both burgers. Before we could say anything, our waitress instantly knew she'd charged us for both burgers. She said she'd be right back. When she came back almost instantly  we wondered if she could have printed another ticket in that time or had a backup ticket ready to go in case we noticed. Just seemed pretty sheisty. We thought about how many times Hennessy successfully pulls that one off on folks that are on vacation and not paying attention to their bill. Besides ALL that the food was just meh.  With all the other issues we had, we probably won't be back on our next trip. This place needs a complete overhaul. It feels like being in an episode of Bar Rescue or Kitchen Nightmares. It's a dingy place with an identity crisis. They serve some irish food along with tacos, burgers, nachos, ahi salad, poke bowls....sorry but an \"Irish Pub\" should serve Irish food. To stand out from all the other places on Fremont Street you need to specialize in  something different (ie. Irish food) and do it well otherwise the other small eateries popping up around you are gonna be your downfall. We only chose you out of pure convenience and exhaustion, otherwise we could have (and should have) kept walking.",

    "text": "HUGE disappointment!   We are locals. My brother-in-law and his wife came into town for Valentine's weekend and we decided we'd spend Friday evening checking out the Mob Museum and then walk over to Fremont and find a place to eat.   My husband and I love Irish pubs and had never tried Hennessy's and everyone agreed it sounded like the perfect place to check out. We were SO wrong.  Anyone who thinks this is a good representative of Irish pubs has never been to a good Irish pub.   I was excited to get an Irish coffee. I make them at home on occasion and I'm not to shabby at it. But getting one at a restaurant is usually better. I rarely drink when out and about because I have a metabolic condition that makes me very sensitive to alcohol. But I decided I was treating myself. What the waitress brought me was....coffee. It was plain coffee. There was zero alcohol and a tiny almost invisible layer of cream on top. There should have been an ounce of Irish whiskey in the coffee and if there had been, I'd have felt it...or ya know, tasted it. Nothing.  Believe it or not, one of the best Irish pubs we've ever been to was in Japan. Their Irish coffee was amazing! They served it with a thick layer of cream that was actually stamped with a clover. I don't know what the heck Hennessey's thinks they're serving but it isn't an Irish coffee.   So--we ordered some appetizers and those were all decent. My entree, however....wtf?   So, I ordered the California Citrus Salad. It is described as spinach & romaine tossed with feta, artichoke hearts, cucumber, olive, tomatoes, red onions avocado & a citrus vinaigrette. I splurged and asked to have the salmon added.   My salad arrives and I'm completely crushed. There is no spinach, no tomatoes, not red onions, two small avocado slices, one artichoke and one small feta crumble. I'm not kidding--just one sad, lonely little feta crumble. I decide to console myself with the gorgeous looking salmon fillet on top of the salad. Only as I am eating it, and getting closer to the center, I realize it isn't actually cooked all the way through. Ugh!   I could have sent it back but I'm afraid of trouser food so I never send stuff back. But seriously, how did they get this so wrong?? I mean, it's salad. How do you get that wrong?   My brother-in-law ordered a steak medium well and was served a steak that was still bleeding. It formed a puddle on his plate.   This place is definitely a tourist trap and not a quality place for locals.",

With that said, I loved Hennessey's.  We had the event catered by them, and surprisingly, the food was extremely high in quality, even though it was sliders (not dry and tender), chicken tenders, tacos, veggies, and other appetizers.  I usually expect those staple foods to be average, but they were exceptional.  The bar service was great, too.  Their main bartender Mike, would continually come up with new drinks based on flavors and/or adjectives you gave him.  Well done Hennessy's!",

Wait staff was super awesome, they have quite a delicious variety of Irish food and beer.  We decided to share a chicken club sandwich and the spinach artichoke dip appetizer. The spinach and artichoke appetizer was creamy and delicious served with tortilla chips. The club sandwich was good I would've preferred the bread not to be so buttery. It came with lettuce tomato avocado mayo and a grilled chicken breast.   They were offering several drinks specials on a Wednesday night, many of them were only five dollars apiece which is a great deal!  If you're down on Fremont Street and you're looking for some great food this is definitely a place you would want to check out. Prices are definitely reasonable!",

The interior is huge with plenty of seating so there was no wait. We walked in and seated ourselves.   Our sever quickly greeted us and explained the menu a bit. She was very nice and attentive throughout our visit. For food I had the Frisco burger which came on sour dough bread and had an in and out type sauce. The burger was good, but nothing great or spectacular. I did like that they had options to substitute a veggie or turkey patty for non red meat eaters though.  Overall it was a pretty average spot. They have a good amount of menu items and the prices are reasonable, but I wouldn't call it a \"must visit\" spot.",

Fish and chips is in my Aussie blood and I would have expected so much more from an Irish  Establishment.   Walking in around 11:30 on a Friday afternoon it was pretty chill and relaxed and we snagged a table on the porch overlooking the main walkway and were able to people watch.   Service was slow, it took the staff about 10mins to even notice us before we put in our drink orders.  We both got the Oktoberfest special by Samuel Adams... kinda warm beer...   The food was average.   I ordered the fish and chips and hubby got the Smash burger.   He ate his but I was a little hesitant.  Let me just say the battered fish could have been thrown against the wall and probably would not have a dent in it. It was hard...& the weird looking ripple like effect made me think the oil or batter was totally off!   I ate one and finished the chips. The coleslaw was blah.  $50 lunch was not worth it... maybe we should have tried Heart Attack Grill across the way instead!!",

I'm sure the food was good, although I was unable to try it. If I could rate just off of conversation and service I'd give it more.   The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars was because of the prices of drinks. We bought two mixed cocktails (which barely had any alcohol from the tastes of it) and it was about $20 with well liquor.   I understand it's Vegas but there are way more places to get *cheaper* drinks.   If you want to have a good time with good people and don't mind spending a bit of cash of drinks, go here. Otherwise I would avoid it just for the prices alone!",

Man handing out cards that showed their body parts.  But what can I say, its Vegas. LoL  I highly recommend this restaurant!",

We were able to walk right up and sit on the patio, so that's always fun for people watching.  Our server was definitely stressed and you could see it all over her face and in her interactions with us. She was rushed and frustrated and just wanted to get out of there! Aside from that, everything else was just fine. The food was good- we had the spinach and artichoke dip as an app and split the BBQ turkey burger. Everything was cooked well and tasted good.   The best part of my meal, aside from the people watching out on the patio, was the Moscow Mule I got to drink! It was really tasty, and served in an authentic copper mug. I'd like to return and try some of the other offerings on the menu.",

It came with 4 differently topped mini burgers.  It might have been okay, if they were cooked well done like I requested.  They had a very large menu selection that was overwhelming.    The view off the main patio was awful due to current construction.  There was scaffolding everywhere and you really couldn't see down the Fremont strip.    The worst part of this experience had to do with service.  It was not very busy on the Wednesday night we arrived.  We sat ourselves outside on the patio and waited forever to even put in a drink order or get a menu.  The server was actually inside taking selfies and chatting with the bar customers.  We knew that she was going not going to be good, since our neighboring table gave us the low down on their horrible experience.  They were just trying to get their check to head out as fast as possible, rather than wait for their meals finally arrive.  I wish I could remember her name, but it appeared to us that she preferred waiting on regulars or males.    We let our tip reflect how we interpreted our experience, especially since she never came back to give us change.  Do not recommend this place, since there are so many other restaurants in this area to try.",

The alcohol is reasonable priced, the food is quite good, too.  My favs being Guiness (24oz) and the Bananas Foster to drink and burgers & the truffles fries for nomming.  Some exceptional items are:  - Truffles Fries: \"...tossed with white truffle oil, Parmesan cheese & fresh parsley.\" Contains no truffle, though still quite good.  (Google \"white truffle oil\" and you'll be a bit shocked)  - Prime Rib Sliders served with blue cheese & horseradish sauce.  Cooked to your temp & generally great beefy flavor with just enough bite that you don't eat the entire beef slice in your first bite.   I typically go late on weekends which can be quite busy, so service does degrade a bit.  Lunch service has been good so far.   Go for 2 Timin' Tuesdays for 2for1 burgers.  Eat one there & get the other to go, even!  I am a repeat customer due to my preference for music, but would easily go there for the food & semi-Irish atmosphere, too.",

I was starving, so we stopped off at this place (since Heart Attack Grill made you wear a ridiculous patients gown! and this was right down the way.) To my surprise, everything was pretty cheap, and tasted delicious! I coincidentally went on a Tuesday, and they had a special going on \"Two for Tuesday\", which I didn't know about until I got the low-low bill! I'm surprised the waitress didn't take advantage of tourist. For that, this place gets my thumbs up!

They are basically thinly sliced potatoes covered in cheese, bacon and sour cream.  I asked for jalapenos too!   Then I ordered the Avocado BLT, which was even better than a regular BLT.  The avocado added an extra creaminess and the toast was grilled like a grilled cheese sandwich.  Would definitely order this again.

Myself and my foodie +1 date were running kinda late for EDC this past weekend and saw that this place was the closest nearby our hotel. Boy, did we sure make quite the great choice coming here!  Let me first say that due to the fact that my phone was near death in battery life, I was not able to take any pics of the eats we had to enjoy. I will just describe the experience instead! Inside it is very roomy with plenty of ample seating, as well as outdoor patio seating. This place does have live bands coming to play. Sweet! They do have a fully stocked open bar as well as some of the most courteous staff! Our waitress was very prompt in making sure our needs were fulfilled. I think her name was Shannon or Sharon. Either way, she was very professional and sweet!  For the eats, I ordered their Irish nachos, which came with a scoop of sour cream, which added to the already awesome taste. My foodie date had their amazing spinach and artichoke dip. Whoa. Some of the best we have ever had! For drinks, she had the lemonade with vodka. I had to opt for their iced tea(I was the DD that night!) The food came out rather quickly, which we was able to enjoy nicely.  As I stated before, there are such a variety of places to eat on Fremont Street in Las Vegas. This is one place that I highly recommend. The service was impeccable, the eats were just amazing and the overall experience was a memorable one. Next time I am in the area, I will definitely be making a pit stop here. That is how much this place impressed me.",

Nothing original but nothing bad; prices are nothing to were home about or complain about. Nothing remarkable about the decor, the seating, the atmosphere - seriously - it's just the most typical chain of an Irish pub that has ever existed.",

When we sat down 3 other couples sat down at the other 3 tables next to us at the same time. Naturally I thought we werent going to get good service because our server Stephanie was so busy. But I was absolutely wrong, she was amazing. She handled all of these tables wonderfully. I ordered the Citrus salad with Ahi tuna and it was delicious. The pither of Sangria was the best I've ever had. I definitely would recommend Hennessey's Tavern to my family and friends. We had such a great night. All the staff we encountered last night were super nice and very attentive !!",

Given it is perhaps the only stand alone restaurant to grab some traditional beer food, i.e. hamburgers and items covered in cheese, I would definitely keep it on my go-to spots when I am planning an evening of bar hopping on Fremont. And, it isn't everywhere that you can find a portabella. The other tasty item here are their tater chips. I am pretty sure they are homemade, and you can get a basket of them all by their delicious selves for the perfect beer accompaniment. Service was all smiles and happy to accommodate special requests. All in all a very solid first impression!",

    "text": "Came here with a buddy (Kyle) to fuel up for some 10x odds craps at Binion's... I had the Sirloin and a Guinness... Kyle had the Corned Beef and Cabbage and a Black & Tan...   First off... good looking girls as waitresses... Guinness came quick (but not too quick, leading me to believe that they know what they are doing) and the Black & Tan was heavy on the tan...  Good start.  My steak looked delicious and like it came out of a photo shoot.  Kyle's C-B&C looked equally cool.  So far this is a solid 4 star joint.  I ordered my steak medium-rare because the only gravy I like on my mashed potatoes is the blood from my steak.  Obviously, there are better places for steak (this is Vegas for crissakes), but steak is on the menu so I'm going to hold them accountable for knowing how to cook one.    As I mentioned, the steak looked beautiful, and I cut into it and I got a good amount of juice action, but it tasted like it was over cooked... I kept thinking to myself... Their grill must be like on something as hot as the surface of the sun and incinerated the grill marks into this chunk of meat.  I continue to eat it and it tastes well done but looks medium rare...  then towards the end of the steak, when you have cut enough off and it is now taller that it is wide (it was a nice thick steak) and if falls over... I spotted it.  Bottom side was blacker than Wesley Snipes.    To quote Randal from Clerks:  \"I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am...\"  \"You're cunning attempt to trick me\"  It was a good steak, but someone set fire to one side of it and it wasn't even busy in the restaurant... no excuse... Kyle totally dug the corned beef, but then again he isn't on Yelp.  Despite my steak complaints I actually would go back to this place because everything else was solid, but I would ask for a bloody ass steak and then check the plate side before eating it... Maybe they do the whol hot ass skillet thing and that was the cause... Maybe this is how you like a steak, but not how I do, and again... it is my review.",

It looked cool and Yelp stars helped.  My friend, husband, and I all ordered our drinks and then decided on Irish Nachos just a quick bite. Man were we surprised! First...my Bloody Mary was DELISH!!!! My husband and friend ordered the Seasonal brew of Sam Adams and they were pleased. My friend got the HUGE GLASS of beer with the take home glass which was pretty awesome! She was feeling good after that. Then our nachos came out and they were so yummy on homemade chips which were perfect! It was such a great snack for three people set out on there Vegas drinking adventure. I had 2 Bloody Marys and then we ordered some more fried food - the truffle fries and they were really good! Since this was our first stop we decided to just stop there, but we LOVED all of it. The waitress was super nice and cute too. :) And the Atmosphere was chill. We will be back to visit when in the neighborhood.",

We started out next door at Mickie Finnz where we sat for 15 minutes without being acknowledged by any of the staff. So admittedly we were miffed when we got up and went over to Hennesseys. We got a seat outside on the deck, which is a pleasant spot for a burger and beer right on revitalized Fremont East.   Unfortunately, we sat there for another 10 minutes before anyone bothered to stop at our table. WTF ... the wait staff there repeatedly walked past our table without stopping, just like the other place! The joint was not busy and I was pissed. But eventually I was able to sip on a Guinness draft as I tried to chill my ass out. The Guinness helped for the most part, though I was not pleased with the level of service we received throughout the meal. Our waitress simply was not personable and provided only minimal service. I am confused because of all of the positive reviews posted here on the personable service. Perhaps it was a bad night for our waitress. Anyway I only tipped 10% that night. I do not remember ever tipping anyone less than 15%.   However, the food was pretty good. My wife enjoyed the fish-n-chips, which had a decent fish to batter ratio, though we both agreed the bluecheese burger was great. Probably the best bluecheese burger I've had.   We might go back, but we might not either. There are many other choices out there.",

She was beautiful, sure, but she was SUPER witty... which was a relief after the rather dull service we had gotten throughout Vegas earlier in the week.  I'm telling you, if you go to Hennessey's and you get Nikki as your waitress (whether you're a boy or a girl), your experience will be elevated!  I had a veggie burger and fries... not bad.  Food and drinks were quite inexpensive.  The meal was followed by a shot with our waitress.  My only criticism of the place is the surprise I had to see a bathroom attendant in the bathroom.  I've dealt with restroom attendants a few dozen times but it just seemed strange to have one in a Irish bar in Vegas.",

Despite the crowd on the street, it was not really busy - which is a shame, because the places in the casinos are either much more expensive or not as good food.

And the California Citrus Salad was seriously amazing.

Took the chicken & olives off, cost the same, but at least our server was cool enough to let us know and ask if we wanted it on the side so anyone else could munch on it.  I love little things like that.  What a great experience.  Can't wait to go to a nearby Hennessey's Tavern & check on the bloody marys and order myself a cal. citrus salad.  YUM!",

Vegas tourism (and even the locals) bring out some colorful characters, and with the outdoor seating, you get a front row view of the best (or worst) humanity has to offer.  The beers are good, the mixed drinks are good, and even their food is good (they make a mean corned beef on St. Patty's).  They sometimes have Irish bands play, and the enthusiasm makes a night of drinking with friends all the more merry.  They even have a mechanical bull, for crying out loud.  Is that \"hardcore bar\", or what?  But the real highlight is Sandra, a server that I always see every time I go these.  That girl is super cool, funny as everything, and greets me with a hug every time I see her.  She's always busy, but never so much so that she doesn't do top notch service or joke around.  She's a class act.  Even though Freemont Street is more the touristy fare, they have some great bars and service down there, and Hennessey's is one of them.  Check it out for some non-pretentious fun and weird people watching.",

My theory worked out as my eye brow raising \"rare' request was rewarded with a burger that was no where close to being rare.  Ipso facto= Hennesey's is mediocre.

I ordered it medium and it showed up beyond well done... the \"toast\" was crouton dry, I even tried to slather it with mayonnaise and 1000 island to make it edible but no amount of sauce could bring that burger back to life. The server asked if I wanted something else to eat but at that point I simply did not have another hour to wait to try something else. I asked for the check and 15-20 minutes later still had no bill so I left some cash and I hope that covered the tab. I really couldn't wait around and let my ears bleed more listening to the awful woman they had performing live.",

    "text": "I've been here a few times thanks to the relative convenience of just being a short walk away from work.  The food here is decent, the portobello burger is actually interesting, the mini burgers are not bad, and the regular burger doesn't have much flavor to it.    The issue here is of course the service.  It just takes way too long to receive your drinks, receive your appetizer, receive your entree, to receive your check and even to get your card back.  It would be understandable if it was during a busy night where the tables were full and the servers were running everywhere, the only problem is every time I've been here it's usually nearly empty and somehow the employees still seem to disappear.  The one thing it does have going for it however is its location right at the edge of the Freemont Street Experience.  So if you want to sit on the outside area and just relax and people watch, it can be enjoyable.  Avoid eating here though if you're any sort of time constraint though.  Although I'll admit, I kind of want to have that portobello burger again.",

I love visiting places I haven't been to before and so I jumped on this opportunity to enjoy the company of others at work.    This place was your typical Irish looking pub.  Two toned walls, lots of dark wooden panels.  Not really a hip place.  More traditional and older looking but in a great location on Fremont!    For lunch, I got the Hermosa Chicken Salad.  It's a salad filled with mixed greens, tomatoes, feta cheese, shaved carrots, cucumber, fresh strawberries, avocado & toasted pecans, tossed in balsamic vinaigrette.  The chicken was a little dry but everywhere in the salad so I appreciated it better.  I LOVED the fact that this salad had avocados and strawberries.  That flavor combination and the texture combination with the crunchy pecans really made a great salad.  I \"slurped\" that salad right up and really enjoyed it at the end of the day.    The best part: it was expensed!  Loved it.  I can't complain when the company is great and this lunch was no exception.  I will definitely try to check this place out in a different setting like a late night drink to see how the vibe changes but for now, I'm a fan.",

So, why the one star rating?  The wait staff were just absolutely horrible.  Okay, we did have a large group (11) walking in twos and threes.  But, here's what bugged the crap out of me.  As soon as we were done eating, they brought us the bill.  I told them we'd like to stay and watch the game (another two hours) so leave the bill open.  Well, they bring the bill (now separately) in another ten minutes by a different waitress.  Again, I told them we'll close the bill when we're done.  And, I asked them to just combine everything and we'll settle when we're done with the game.  They bring the bill out again in about another ten minutes.  I asked, 'do you want us to leave?' (we were not being disruptive, arrogant or obnoxious).  The waitress said they're having a shift change so they're trying to clear the bill (they wanted their tip).  I said, 'if its, okay with you guys, we'd like to finish the game and we'll settle at the end'.  She said okay and walked off (but, I can see that she was a bit disappointed).  Well, another gal comes with our bill once again.  We finally just let the bill sit and continued until the game finished.  The management needs to tell their teeny bopping waitress about being customer focused instead of worrying about their own dammed tip.  Or, just don't ever go to this place to watch sports.",

It's the perfect time of year, combining March Madness and a general acceptance to be a goofy lush in public.    The decor is very Irish-pub-esque, with lots of dark greens, brass, and wood.    I came here with a friend for some beers, and was happy to see Smithwicks (pronounced smith-ix) on tap.  It's a wonderful, amber colored beer with much lighter flavor notes than its color would suggest.    We sat outside near the heaters, enjoyed the scenery, as downtown is THE spot to people watch, and sipped our beers with style.  The waitresses were friendly, tattooed, and pretty.    This is a solid spot to grab a pint, and get in touch with your Irish side.   Slainte!",

    "text": "A group of 7 of us girls came here to grab a little lunch before going going zip lining on Freemont Street. Moray of us have been in the bar and restaurant industry and fully understand how they work (just a side note). We were told to just seat ourselves and since the place was fairly empty with most patrons at the bar we sat in a little area next to the bar to fit our group. Our server came over in right away told us the specials and we ordered the champagne bucket special that came with orange and cranberry juice; the bucket came and our server begins to pour our champagne and filed every glass with o.j in them without asking. We chalked it up to it was a nice gesture but we ordered this bucket so we could control our own mixtures. Not a big deal, so we order a few apps while we all figure out what to eat for lunch. Before the apps came out we placed or lunch order, just a lot of salads and split BLT. Simple items. Right after placing our lunch order the apps came out,  every app came out cold....cold calamari is disgusting. It was fine we had lunch coming out at any moment, we waited, and waited, and waited.  Finally at the 47 minute mark we needed to start going to catch our zipline time. Our server that we have only seen very few times at this point was nowhere to be found, then we see her run across the bar into the back before approaching the table. By the time we found her we had to go, all she could say was that our food was coming, we insisted that we had to go as she stared at us with her deer in the headlights look. We asked for a manager who came over and stated the same as the server \"the food was almost done\". I explained we only only ordered 3 salads, a BLT, and soup and is been almost an hour. As a manager you never make excuses but not for this one....his attitude raised and he told us there were 12 other offers ahead of us and we needed to wait. THERE WASN'T EVEN 12 PEOPLE IN THE RESTAURANT!!!! He was trying to make us pay for the food we never received within our hour wait by this point. I explained to him that we were done here and we needed to go. It was bad news bears all over this place. Horrible service. I hope they get better cause the place was really cute but with a manager like this not being a leader and inspiring his staff to do their best he will being down this restaurant.",

Day 1: Great server, good drinks (the mimosa is laughable small, get a bloody mary), that never emptied and REALLY great breakfast food. I couldn't have asked for more (except, a larger mimosa).  Day 2: Different server. Took 15 min at least to get our order. No water refills. No coffee refills. Would have gotten an alcoholic beverage, but was so annoyed I didn't order one. It took over an hour to get our food (was kinda busy, I could have let that go IF I had a beverage of any sort). Our server would say, \"I'll be right back to refill your coffee and water,\" but she didn't come back until it was time to drop off the bill. We were not pleased. All that being said though, the breakfast food was still awesome (though luke warm before she could be bothered to bring it to us). No hot sauce. As it was 1.5 hours into our bite to eat, I wasn't going to wait to flag down the invisible woman.",

    "text": "I REALLY wanted to like this place; it was going to be my light at the end of the Fremont proverbial tunnel. After St. Patty's Day and many hours of watching college basketball, I was having trouble picking a drink that sounded good to me.  I decided Guinness was just what I needed. We walked down to the end of Fremont Street and sat down on the patio at Hennessey's.    It was about 4:00 on a Friday afternoon.  We had a few more people joining us so we asked a server if we could move some tables together.  She said yes, walked inside and never came back.  After about 5-7 minutes of chatting, we walked to the door and asked another server if there was anyone helping the patio or if we should go to the bar.  She replied that someone would help us.  After another few minutes, we went to the bar.  Even there, the service was pretty slow. Bummer.  The patio was nice, but that had more to do with the weather than the restaurant. Jameson tasters were fun for the boy as he loves his Irish Whiskey.  Didn't get to try the food, we didn't want to wait any longer for a server or deal with the bartender.  That, and our friend dropped his new phone in the huge cup of Guinness, so we had to go back to our hotel to bust out the hair dryer.  Double Bummer.  Such potential.   This review should really be two stars based on this one experience, however I'm not giving up yet.  I will go back again to give it another try and I consider myself an optimistic realist, so I'll give it three stars.",

I told him I was in the mood for a burger and he said that his restaurant has some good ones.  So we walked on over for some dinner. We ordered some onion rings that came with Spicy BBQ sauce. I don't know what level of spiciness they were talking about... but it just seemed like plain ol BBQ sauce to us. We would have liked to have a side of Ranch, but the waitress didn't arrive till after we finished them.  We put in our main order and it took about 15 minutes to get our food. I asked the waitress what her favorite burger was and she said \"The Frisco burger\" and my mom ordered \" Hennessey's famous burger\".  When the food came, my burger which was sourdough bread toasted with cheese, was kind of cold and hard. The actual met was hot... it seemed as if the bread was sitting there for awhile. My moms burger came and it was average. I ended up ordering a coke, when she brought it, it was flat. I asked if she could replace it, and she never came back. She ended up apologizing 20 minutes later when she brought the bill that she forgot.  All in all this place had decent customer service, and the food was subpar. Go elsewhere.",

Last night (11/4/17) around 8:00, we decided to try the place because there was a band scheduled.  There was no hostess to seat us so we chose a seat from the many empty tables available.  There was a mix of several large groups as well as parties of four and two but by no means was the place slammed.  We sat for twenty minutes without a single person acknowledging us.  Three times a person appeared at the hostess station for less than a minute and then disappeared.  I did not observe any other customers come in while we waited.  Since the band was no where near playing at that point and we had zero acknowledgement from the staff, my party of two decided to leave.  We walked down to Atomic and spent our dollars there.",

It's a group of people who post on an internet discussion board about Las Vegas.  I have known some of these people for over 10 years.  When the leader of the discussion board was trying to find a place that would accommodate that large a group of people, she gave Hennessey's a call and they offered us the Claddagh Room for three hours at no charge and they supplied a bartender for our group.  I've been to Hennessey's for two shows in the past few years and they were in the Claddagh Room.  It's a pleasant place with wood tables and chairs.  We were able to mingle or sit and talk.  I got a diet Coke that came in a small Mason jar with a handle.  The drink was $3.50 but there were unlimited refills.  The bartender was a very outgoing young lady and she was a pleasure!  Hennessey's Claddagh Room was the perfect place for our meet.",

IT WAS HORRIBLE - burnt chicken & burnt waffles. it's not on the menu yet and the hostess conveniently left out that there was Tabasco sauce in the syrup. I asked the server if I could have regular syrup to which she acted like I was dumb for not knowing there was tabasco in the syrup. The chicken and 2 mini waffles were TINY & once again burnt. If it hadn't been \"free\" I would have sent it back. Service was awful; our server had one table & there were 2 total in the entire restaurant because it was around 9:30/10am...

Between the street performers, people soaring across the street on wire cables, lights and weird people (i.e. people dressed as topless nuns), there was a lot to smile about.  It was great to do a lot of that smiling on the outdoor patio of Hennessey's Tavern.  The night I stopped by had a live band playing inside.  I never caught the name but they were pretty good.  They did some Pearl Jam & The Cure covers that they sounded great inside the bar.  On the outside of the bar, Hennessey's is directly across from that notorious Heart Attack Grill, where jumbo-sized guests that tip the scale at over 350 pounds eat for free.  It was sure funny to sit on the patio of Hennessey's and watch people get on the outdoor scale and check to see if Heart Attack Grill would fit the bill for them (presuming they could fit in the door).  The service was great, and the food was fine.  I had a Spicy Lass, which is a hamburger with pepper-jack, chipotle sauce lettuce, tomato and avocado.  It did its job, but don't think for a second I wasn't looking at those giant decals of the \"Octuple Bypass Burgers\" they had across the street on the side windows and wonder if I made the right decision of where to eat at (you can add 40 slices of bacon for $7.40...what?!).",

Cool, we never been, so let's try it out shall we?  The menu seems like there's something for everyone, and when it came down to it, I ordered their Slider Sampler which came with four types of burger-Avocado, BBQ, Bacon, and Cheeseburger. Our waitress asks me how I want my burgers done, and I specifically say MEDIUM RARE as those who know me, know I like my meat nice and pink...Steaks, Lamb,Prime Rib, BURGERS, etc. anything more, you would be doing the meat a very huge injustice IMO.  This is where it got worse. My order arrives, and as small as slider buns are already, they weren't even toasted and you barely could see the meat. Now I don't know if the cook in charge was trained by Chef Boyardee or The Hamburger Helper, but the juices had been cooked out of that meat and the inside wasn't even pink like I requested. Who knows? Maybe our waitress on top of being rude, had a hearing problem and heard well instead of rare? At least my Truffle Parmesan Fries were good and I had my root beer to help wash my burger down. I'd avoid this place at all costs and walk down further to Du Par's instead.  ALOHA!!!

This visit, it was a little on the bad service and a whole lot of crap food. It blew my mind.  This visit is during a Sunday, at lunch time, and it's not that busy.  We decided to order their \"greatest\" Irish nachos. We were left sorely unimpressed as the potatoes were limp/soggy and skint on toppings. Definitely far from anything \"great\".  My wife ordered a chicken sandwich for lunch. About a 1/4 of the way through she stopped mid bite and looked at it, then proceeded to cut it open in the middle. It had a near raw center. How on earth do you mess that up?  We alerted our server and it was taken away, and off our bill. That last bit we didn't expect as we were more concerned that if our food was undercooked, it could very easily be happening to others around us.  My one and only joy in this experience is drinking their World's Largest Pint (essentially a 60oz plastic drinking glass).   Sadly, that beer alone can't save the disaster that was our experience.  I hope others will find this review helpful in deciding whether or not to gamble on eating here. I'm sure no one will go wrong with drinking here, but try the food at your own risk.",

    "text": "Came into hennesseys around 5:30 tonight we sat on the patio to people watch and get some food quick. My husband and I were exhausted and annoyed from the trip. At first glance it looked unwelcoming and the girls looked at us funny so we were going to turn around and head across the street. But we were kindly and pleasantly surprised by this short blonde that came up to us and said to sit wherever we felt comfortable. She gave us a rundown of the specials that they were featuring at that time, to which we did because of her hospitality hard to come across in this bustling city. Happy hour has a bunch of $5 food and drinks and buy one get one free burgers on tuesdays that was a plus since... hey it's Tuesday lol and it's expensive to even step foot in Vegas. I believe her name was autumn at the hostess stand and then we got the pleasure to have her as our waitress. I am celiac and couldn't have a few of the items. She went to a manager and asked for us, I was feeling some nachos and to my surprise I could have them but decided to go a different route. She knew the menu like the back of her hand, that was so refreshing that her response to my difficult order seemed like a breeze. The food was amazing, her recommendation for my husband was also perfect, we honestly were expecting something to be missing or wrong. Best experience we've had hands down at a restaurant even better than the strip. We have been to Vegas numerous times and I had never felt so grateful to have found this little gem on Fremont street. We will be coming back to eat and for her for many trips to come.  God bless you autumn and always stay humble. Much love From Canada",

    "text": "Decent experience here. We stopped in after wandering Fremont street. Was hoping for Le Thai, but they had just closed. Overall, prices were very reasonable, for this being close to the touristy hub of the Fremont street experience. The only issue was that service was choppy. We opted to sit outside on the patio and had a group of five. They had good drink specials ($5 for a shot and a beer) when we stopped in (late on a Monday night). I got the Reuben, without sauerkraut, and substituted a side salad with ranch. I was debating the French onion soup, but after asking the waitress, it seemed as though you couldn't substitute it and I wasn't going to pay $5 extra for it. Her comments may not have been completely clear but we were starving so I just went with the salad. My husband got the token shepherds pie dish, and I think everyone else at the table ordered burgers of some sort. I'd say the wait was a bit for our food, maybe over 30 minutes. It is hard to tell how busy they were since we never went inside. I enjoyed the food. My Reuben was plentiful with several slices of corned beef and the rye bread was a nice marbled blend, served toasted. The salad was legit good spring lettuce, topped with cheese, carrots, diced tomatoes, and enough ranch. My husband also enjoyed his shepherd pie and gave the leftovers to our friend that lives in town. Server was nice, but definitely towards the end she appeared to forget about us. It took her awhile to bring the bill and then even longer to return to run my husbands card (our other friends paid in cash). I would say just running and getting the card back took easily over five minutes, and I would assume by that time they were less busy (food-wise) than when we had arrived.",

Although my girlfriend and I were only 17 at the time (1971), we went to the Buena Vista Cafe in San Francisco and ordered a couple of Irish Coffees. I was pretty tall with lots of hair (my Jew-fro), a mustache and a beard...she was really built and 6' tall. This was before places were carding people...and we looked like we were in our mid-20's.  The Buena Vista is where Irish Coffee got their start and is the benchmark for all Irish Coffees everywhere. Seriously...one sip and you hear angels sing.  Hennessey's is equally as good as the Buena Vista's.  Plus, the waitstaff is friendly and attentive and their outdoor seating is a great place to people-watch.",

My boyfriend and I were thrown off when we first entered because we were not aware that we were supposed to seat ourselves where ever we would like. Luckily, a waitress came out from the back after a minute and let us know. Our server was very friendly and although she seemed to be in the weeds, you were not able to tell. I had the pretzel burger with fries and my partner had the shepherd's pie, which came with vegetables. The food was delicious. My boyfriend's entree was so large he didn't have room for the vegetables! The only complaint I have was that our waitress did not refill our sodas and it took her a long time to retrieve our check after we put our credit card in the check book. This can be overlooked because she was so friendly and we understood that she had a lot of tables to take care of. We will be back!",

The drinks are generally good here the Irish mules are really good here when they are served in mule cups. When they are busy or the bartender is being lazy they serve it in plastic. Service is extremely hit and miss if your lucky to get one of the two good servers your drink will always be full other wise you will go thirsty and get One round per band set and be sober.

    "text": "Some of the worst service I have EVER received at an establishment. 11/18 around 7 pm with my family of 10. Walked in the door where a lady walking passed said \"seat yourself people\" okay got it! Moved a couple of tables around to accommodate all of us. The place wasn't that busy, one other table with a party about the same size and the rest of people at the bar. With 3 waitresses.   8 minutes later our waitress shows up at our table to take our drink orders, average height lady with long brown hair, and goes off to retrieve all of the drinks. Comes back in a timely fashion with all of our drinks, perfect! Off to a great start.  Then it came to ordering food. She wasn't the least friendly and her approach was somewhat like \"what did you want\" so I responded with the mushroom burger ! Right after I finished saying mushroom burger she goes to hurry off to take the next order, as if she was rushing because she was busy or something even though she wasn't, so I sort of grabbed her attention quick to request my fries crispy with a side of mayo where she then looked at me sort of nodded said okay and kept taking the next persons order.  While We waited for food we also waited for our drinks to be refilled and When she did come by to refill she sort of just reached in rudely to grab the cups.   Our food was delivered, with some assistance of the other waitresses I'm guessing, everyone's food was dropped off and our waitress just disappeared, no \"is there anything else you guys need? Are your orders correct?\" Because as I looked at my burger and fries I realized there was no mayo and the fries were some of the soggiest fries I've had in a long time, disgusting. But I get it nobody is perfect. I'll suck it up and eat the fries while waiting for her to come back so I can ask for the mayo for my burger. My cousin was also waiting for another beer at this point as well but nobody could find her. I finished my fries a good 10 mins later and then here comes our waitress walking out of the back with another waitress GOSSIPING like high schoolers right past our table, my mom waved her down trying to get her attention while saying ma'am and at that point our waitress had the audacity to give eye contact (that we ALL saw) and then continued on walking towards the bar and called her little buddy waitress to continue on to the bar as well where they finished their important conversation. After about another 7 minutes she finally returns to the table with my cousins beer and I then request a side of mayonnaise and she responded with a rude  \"WHAT?\" And I tell her that I never received the mayo that I had requested with my mayo, which I then Finally received.   The burger was sub par, & it would be nice if you noted that you cook your burgers well done, so that those of us who like any sort of juiciness to our burger would be able to ask for such accommodations since it was extremely dry.   We wanted a cool but different place to eat dinner when we bring family from out of town to Fremont and this place fell extremely short.",

Early in the day made stop after the 5K color run with fellow yelpers for some lunch. I just stuck with pint of beer fuel back up. Not the best idea. I earned it run my first 5K no stopping just slow and steady pace. Other yelpers order some sandwiches and chicken strips looked ok nothing too special. I can't speak of the food except it looked plain no wow factor just your basic pub food. The downstairs part had little outdoor seating area which is where our group of yelpers had lunch after the race. Thankfully we were able too find seats because obvious reasons have event downtown any seats are going too be premium. It great spot especially on great day sun out kick back have meal some beers good times with friends.   Later that night went back as second stop on the pub crawl for iceacholic birthday party. We went upstairs section. I never knew they even had from earlier in the day. I not sure it was open during the day but then again never knew it was there. Might be only on weekends. They had girls passed out two for one drink tickets for Hennessey. So it made second spot on the pub crawl even better! Only too find only the cheap beers that you could choose from buy one get the second one free. Not the premium beers so never believe the hype that anything FREE in life. One of the best things about the upstairs is it over looks the revamped bar scene in downtown Vegas. You can see Insert Coins and that whole block of downtown. They also have little outdoor area overlooks freemount street. It has nice couch like you would see in any club have small group kick back drinking, talking stories, and good times. Once again I never ordered food so not sure about the food. Just have too trust my fellow yelpers. Sure pub crawling one of the bars make stop at along the way.",

I've tried the Bama Burger, which comes with chicken strips and cole slaw on top, and the Roast Beef Burger.  Both are ok.  Extremely messy, though.  I usually eat these burgers with a fork and knife.  One of my pet peeves is that they serve the burgers with potato chips instead of fries.  You need to pay extra to get fries.  I'm not a big fan of potato chips, so I usually don't touch them.    Last time I asked about the fries and the server confirmed I would have to buy them separately.  Since no one else in my party wanted fries, I passed.  When I got my burger, there were two french fries on top.  Cute and creepy at the same time.  No one else got two token fries on their burger.   Service is good in my experience.  They keep up with the drink refills and the food comes out pretty quick.  There are just better food options downtown for me.",

    "text": "Ok people.  Why would you have bands there that do not play Irish Music? First time we went was on a Sunday evening.  Fun Irish band.  Service sucked. So many servers only a few customers and I had to get my drinks at the bar after waiting 29 minutes of being looked at and ignored.    Ok so we try again this past Saturday evening at 11pm. Live band playing random music and we asked for something Irish.  Lead singer said don't let the red beard full you.  They don't know any Irish music.  WTF? People come to Irish Pubs for Irish food, drinks and music.  This isn't rocket science people.   Well we started out at Nine Fine Irishman in New York New York.  A country band really?  Left to try McMullins on Trop.  Dive bar with no live music on a Saturday evening so we braved up and headed here.    What a disappointment.  Fiancee had a horrible birthday evening out.  I had to apologize and maybe Ri Ra at Mandalay could save me from the dog house.",

    "text": "Came here with a few friends after walking up and down Fremont Street.  It did not look too crowded (which we like) so we ventured inside.  After our experience...we know why it was not crowded! There were six of us and only three were drinking (which the server did not seem happy about).  We started with some Jameson/Gingers and then their house drink the Dublin Donkey.  We were asked by our server, Erin, if we wanted doubles.  We said yes.  After the first sip, we all commented on the lack of whiskey in the drinks, but our server was not to be found so we decided to deal with it.  Now, I've worked in the restaurant business most of my life and have drank at many high end bars across the country, so I know a double should cost more.  Usually it has been anywhere from $2-$6 added to the initial price of the drink.  So imagine our surprise here when we discovered that a double was actually 2x the price of the drink.  Translate this to $15 jameson/gingers and $18 Dublin Donkeys!!   We were appalled!  7 drinks, 3 shots... $125!!!  We confronted the server about it and she rudely told me how thats the policy because its double the alcohol and refused to change the check (despite our insisting that those drinks were in no way \"doubles\").   While the price was outrageous I would have been able to get over it if the environment was outstanding (our drinks were served in plastic cups) or the service (Erin was no where to be found half the time, and acted as if she hated her job).  The day after I called to ask the manager if this was really the policy.  With a rude tone, I was again told that that those drinks were indeed that expensive!  No attempt to right this obvious scam was given!  Moral of the story- avoid!  This place is a scam!",

Next night we know where we're ending up! We walk in for dinner and our waitress is actually from Moorhead, MN! Small world. So we chat it up for a while, Crown Ave. is back and just as good as the night before. This is the place to go for sure if you're looking for a low-key night in Vegas.",

The service here was friendly but I think that's where the service ended. The food came out quite slow and my water glass was constantly empty. I think in a bar atmosphere like this it would be appropriate to leave a pitcher of water at the table (if service can't keep up).  I ordered the bacon blue burger which was not good at all. Probably one of the worst burgers I've ever had. It was overcooked and burned even though I ordered it medium well. It had white \"sauce\" cheese with bacon in it which was quite disgusting. I ate about half of it and then felt pretty terrible afterward.  The only thing saving this place is that the calamari was some of the better I've ever had. That's the only reason why it gets 2 stars instead of 1.  Unless you're here just for drinks I would advise to stay away.",

Walked in after a disappointing dinner elsewhere being  excited to have  great Irish Pub so close. Walked in just after 9:30pm place was a ghost house and not in the it's nearly Halloween kinda way! Sat down at the bar looked over the pitiful selection of draft brews... Even sadder selection of Irish liquors (I'm Irish trust me the only Irish beer is NOT Guiness!) The bartender wanders by and simply says\"what are you having\" no hey how are you? What can I get you? (remember bar is DEAD) he wants a beer, I am happy to stay because I know he wants a beer (we've just gotten off a cruise, driven 5 hours, had a bad dinner, seriously want a beer and some friendly service, we are both smiling and happy I kinda expect the same) We order 2 guiness pints. she asks if we want to keep the tab open, he tells her no we will close it out for now (can always pay for a second round right??) Drops the card back, hands off two beers and off she goes, another bartender comes up, does not say a word reaches over the bar next to me to play the slot machine, I smile he again says nothing and keeps playing the machine. Beers are empty, initial bartender walks by says nothing second bartender still gambling says nothing...... Guess we are not staying for another beer. I understand why your bar is empty when every other bar we walked by was jam packed with people, your staff is inattentive and well rude. I hope you actually read the reveiws because apparently I am not the only one who feels this way. Hire people who actually WANT to work around people, otherwise close your doors!",

    "text": "Ok people this is my very first time to write any review. IT WAS THAT BAD!!! Sorry it's kind of long but you will understand.  We drove out to Vegas from So Cal for about 5 hours and after we checked in the hotel we were pretty hungry.  We looked into the restaurant and it didn't look too busy so we decided to go in.  Four of us sat down without any hostess to a large table inside the restaurant. The server came pretty quick and gave us the menus. When she returned we ordered some beers to start off. After we got our beers we ordered right away since by then we were really hungry.  We ordered; chicken wings, fried calamari, 2 hamburgers. Pretty standard stuff.  So we waited for our food. Looking forward to finally eat!  15-20 min went by, the server came and we ordered another beers.  Another 15-20 min went by, and now we were really confused by why our food wasn't coming out. Not even the appetizers.  As far as we can see we saw 2 other tables that sat down and ordered after us and they got their food. And some of them were almost done eating!!  So I went up to the server to ask what's going on (since she was trying to avoid us, pretty sure) and she said, \"Sorry we are really busy tonight! Your food is coming out pretty soon!!\" with a annoyed attitude. But the restaurant WAS NOT busy. Ya, there were people, but not busy for sure.   So finally 45-55 min after we ordered, the fried calamari came out. We looked at it with disbelief! It was SOOOOOOO DRY!! It was gross. You bite into it and you get nothing. They deep fried it too much that it shrunk. We always get calamari whenever we see it on the menu and this is the worst one that I ever got!! So we asked to take it back and take it off the tab.  Few min later the chicken wings came out. But same thing, too dry. And you know when you eat chicken wings you get the sauce all over your finger?? Ya, not this one, just really bad fried food. We didn't finish it.   BTW, even though they said it was \"just made\" it was hard cold, not hot/warm at all!!!!  Then after another 5-10 min later the hamburgers came out. It came out cold. And didn't even have fries, just some old chips.   I work at a restaurant and I know how long each food comes out. Nothing we ordered would take over 30 min. Specially fried food.   We should of gone to In-N-Out instead. :(:(:(:(  We got the manager to talk to and he gave us the same crap about how \"busy\" they were. They offered to take 10% off and nothing else to compensate on our worst night ever. Don't lie to your customer, if you forgot to put in the order or the chefs forgot to make the order or you forgot to pick it up to take it out to the customers, just tell them you messed up and do a better job than 10% off to make the customers happier.  We were really disappointed and hungry after all.",
