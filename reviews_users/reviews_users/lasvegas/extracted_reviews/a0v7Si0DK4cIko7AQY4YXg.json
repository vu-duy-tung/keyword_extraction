I can usually find a coupon for a buy-one-get-one-free meal (up to 8 dollar value) in the weekly View newspaper.  GREAT value.    They have a huge menu with lots of choices, including lunch options (burgers, sandwiches, etc.).  The omelets and a few other meals have the option of either toast or a homemade banana nut muffin and I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't emphasize how freakin' awesome the muffin is!  It's served warm and fresh before your meal comes so if you're starving going into the place choose the muffin to get you started.  Also, the potatoes are perfectly seasoned and totally addicting.  I couldn't leave one tiny morsel behind, even if I wanted to.   The decor is cute and has a country feel.  There is a condiment tray on your table that has a little egg on it to signify if you're OK and don't need your server (black egg that smiles) or if you need something from your server (yellow egg that frowns lol).  Cute touch!   The service was decent - no complaints there.    If you have a coupon and are around for breakfast or lunch then you just can't lose coming here!",

We came for late breakfast on his birthday. They sat us at a table that I immediately wasn't thrilled about but bit my tongue and was excited to eat. We were greeted a couple minutes after being sat but after we got our drinks we hardly saw our waiter. The food was yummy but the service was mediocre. Also sat without a drink for most of my meal waiting for a refill. It definitely wasn't busy enough for the quality of service we had. It was comparable to dining at Denny's. Doubt we will dine here again.",

You can't really go wrong with anything you'll order, one think you have to make sure is to order the diablo potato instead of hash browns. It's really super good...I can have them for snacks.",

The food was delicious. 3 of my friends ordered country fried steak with eggs. I ordered a chili skillet with eggs and cheese. Girlfriend got a breakfast sandwich on ciabatta bread. Most of the plates here have these seasoned breakfast potatoes which were amazing and full of flavor. There is a reason the LV Review Journal gave this place an excellent rating because it's a great place to eat. Get a mimosa and a banana nut muffin as well. Lastly the value you get here is pretty dam good. For 6 of us we paid about $115 including tip. I think that's pretty good and we still had leftovers. We will definitely be back.",

Every item on the menu is pretty much home style comfort food but the warm banana nut muffins that most of the time you need to ask for is so freakin GOOD!  Anyhow if you haven't been here come. Foods great, people are friendly, sometime service can be a tiny bit slow but for the most part they are on it and super nice, so that makes up for it.

The food is great (my favorite is the homemade corned beef hash and eggs), and the service is superb.    The only thing that has been bothering me lately is that every time I go (for the last 2 years), the only music that is played is country.  I like some country music a lot, but much of it I find boring, repetitive and depressing, the same sounds, rhythms and melodies coming out of barely different mouths.  When I asked a manager if they could mix up the music I was told that upper management wants only country music playing at all their restaurants.  I find this pretty ridiculous. . . Even if I lived in Texas, I wouldn't want to hear only country music every time I went out to eat.  Life and eating out shouldn't be that monotonous.  If this doesn't change soon, I will be forced to drive further to go to another breakfast/lunch restaurant just to give my ears a break.",

My main complaint is the price. I couldn't believe the bill. My two small kids ordered from the kid's menu. I ordered an omelet. We all had beverages. And our bill was OVER $50! I would have expected that at a pricey place on the strip, but not at a breakfast restaurant across from a Wal-Mart. The prices are just too high. We walked out $57 poorer. We won't be back.",

They have a great selection of breakfast and lunch dishes, along with some pizza specialities because of their brick oven. The service is the best part. They clearly have a well oiled machine, especially when handling the huge crowds that accumulate for that breakfast/brunch rush. I still can't find a breakfast spot that handles the morning rush the way this place does. Don't come here without having one of their skillets. They're delish.",

There are several rooms to be seated in. There are tables with armless chairs and some 1/2 bench seating with armless chairs. When it's busy it would be difficult for a scooter to get around. You pay at the front counter. It is a very noisy place. There are several tv on but they are on mute with closed caption running. It seems all the tv are set to sports channels.

The food was delicious and our server was attentive that we didn't have to wait long for our check. The pizzas were a little bigger than a personal size so we were all able to have a taste. The French toast was amazing! This was my order and I didn't have to use the syrup because it was already sweet - nothing like dessert for breakfast!

It's now become one of my favorite places to go if I'm with someone who wants an early morning meal.  I don't usually eat breakfast and I don't even like any breakfast items (I hate eggs, pancakes, etc.), and that's why I never go to a breakfast place. I was dreading my meal and I figured I was going to be resigned to sipping on a coffee and watching while he ate. Imagine my surprise and how thrilled I was to find that Egg Works also has lunch / brunch food on their menu! It's not just a sea of pancakes and omelettes!   As you'd expect, there are a TON of egg dishes. You can get eggs just about any way you can imagine. If you're a fan of eggs, you will adore this place. Ditto for other breakfast items like french toast, hash browns, and more. I was tickled to find a large section of non-breakfast items that didn't just seem like an afterthought. They have a great selection of salads, sandwiches, burgers and chili.   My friend ordered a waffle with strawberries and whipped cream and it was huge, fluffy, fresh and delicious. I got a bowl of their supposedly \"famous\" Cincinnati chili. I'm a big chili fan and theirs is good but not great. They cheerfully loaded it with shredded cheese for me and as we all know, cheese makes everything better!  They have great beverages too, including alcoholic options, soda (Coke products), freshly squeezed juices, fancy coffees, and plain old watery American coffee. Service was super fast and efficient, and the atmosphere relaxing.   This is the perfect spot if you're looking for a hearty breakfast and you have non-breakfast eaters in tow. I'll be back!",

Through all of these meals being prepared to different tables & types of people, I didn't see one person lose their cool, instead buttered the toast for another person's order, helped run the food out and seemed to care about getting everything right for each person.  I totally respect that.  I highly recommend sitting up there & watch how hard they work to do what they do.  Awesome Eggs Works team!    I had a friendly & very personable server named Heather who was wonderful!  I never had to look for her, she had perfect timing.  Honestly, when I'm not w/ my folks who like to sit at the table, I'm always going to sit at the bar.    Today I had the Mexican crepe, next time I'll say no onion, cheese or chiles.  I forgot cause last time it was perfect w/o all of that.  Also the guy next to me had the Works scramble.  He said that's the only thing he gets so I'll try that next time.  Hope you all are having a great morning cause Egg Works made my day.",

The corned beef and the potatoes should come with a health warning because of the amount salt they put in it. His poached eggs were over cooked and covered in a ridiculous amount of cold salty hollandaise sauce. When we brought it to our servers attention she asked if it was our first time and then informed us that we can ask for easy seasoning and that she should've let us know. It was a very disappointing experience",

My wife and I eat out alot and have never experienced this kind of treatment before. The ladies working that day were I believe Hispanic, and seems like they were probably racist of my type of people. A few friends of mine have also recieved this kind  service at this specific location on rainbow blvd.

I found a recipe online that I want to try, but I'd never had it before, and had no idea what a hollandaise sauce was supposed to taste like.   I ordered the Spinach Benny, which is the traditional EB dish, with spinach leaves.  I DEVOURED it.  It was so tasty!  The English Muffin was delicious, the Canadian Bacon was flavorful, and the eggs were poached to perfection.  I just love when the yolk oozes out nice and slowly...I love poached eggs.  So much.  The hollandaise was light, delicate and YUMMY!  I can only hope that my own turns out this good.  The works potatoes served on the side were delicious too, and were seasoned very well.  I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Just looking at the menu it is so cute. The menu is like reading the morning news paper. However HUGE TIP- give yourselves at least 20 min to read the ENORMOUS menu. To tell you the truth it is a little overwhelming. I'm not even an egg person but I love the selection and variety they have here: to start off- classic eggs served any style, 5 types of egg Benny's, tons of specials with eggs served with the whole bandit of muffins, toast, crossionts- along with the savory toppings and sides of cheese, grilled onions with a side a bacon, ham or sausage, or steak. 20 different types of omelettes with every topping you can think of including the works or the sun dance special- spinach, sliced mushrooms, artichoke hearts, Swiss cheese? Topped with feta and fresh tomatoes. And to keep going (just onto page 2)- 5 different kinds of scrambled, 9 skillet breakfasts, 6 crepes and even my favorite the Hawaiian breakfast section with 2 types of loco moco and the island favorite of spam or Portuguese sausage and eggs plus rice. On top of all of this I didn't even mention the totasta eggs along with the 20 different burritos (ok may not have been 20) but a lot of burritos with eggs included of course. And of course they have a no eggs section of pancakes, waffles, and French toast/ parfaits options; also soups, salads, wraps, and sandwiches and lastly chilli (Cincinnati style-not sure what that even means!)  Also if u wanna get your drink on (I mean it is Vegas) they have vodka red bull, mimosa, greyhounds, screwdrivers, and classic vodka cranberry. As well as beers. Too bad they didn't offer an unlimited drink options! That would make this place amazing for brunch!  This place is average on price; 10-13$ for breakfast/brunch. But from what it seems the portions are large! Also I forgot to add they have a brick oven menu with an array of stombolis, brick over sandwiches and of course pizza.  We ordered the corn beef hash with white toast and 2 scrambled eggs, the omelette chili reyenos, and enchilada burrito",

I my go to brunch dish is the Loco Moco, first time here and so I am open to try anything new. It's basically country (white) gravy. It was a nice change and overall tasted very good. Definitely recommend. The Michelada hat their house spices which gave it a nice kick. Size was decent, lasted the entire brunch. No additional order needed. Total with tip came out to $18-nod bad for the size brunch.  My party had the stuffed French toast, loco Moco and the works skillet. Everyone was happy. Coffee tastes ok and come with free refill. Mimosa come in a mix-your-own set. Personal bottle and cup of OG. You can decide how heavy or light you want it.   Will come back here again, hopefully with Veronica again.",

My brother had the Bennie - loved it!  The server (can't remember his name but he was awesome too)  was all over it and really worked his tail off!  Awesome experience - better than the other Egg Works in Vegas that I've visited - largely because of the hostess (Jenny) and our server.  I'll definitely be back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

Eggs were done perfectly (I'm a freak about eggs being well scrambled - no runny stuff) and my husband had the excellent corned beef hash.  And yes, the banana nut muffin was delicious.  :)  Will definitely visit again next time we're in town.",

    "text": "I'm always looking for new breakfast places and have never been to Egg Works so don't know if they are all the same but really enjoyed our breakfast here. The restaurant was very roomy with plenty of flatscreens with different sports channels or the news on. The menu was pretty extensive and styled after a newspaper( very cute!) The problem with me and new places is I love to read menus and if you give me a large one..could be a while before you get my order( plus i start to panic somewhat with the overwhelming amount of choices) so i buckled under the pressure and just got a basic 2 eggs over with bacon and potatoes with the banana muffin. Love love love the muffin! Came out warm with slightly toasty edges with great banana flavor! So yum. Hubby got a breakfast skillet with ham, mushrooms and cheese with 2 eggs over easy. Eggs were done perfectly and he seemed to enjoy it and said he would order it again. My eggs were also cooked perfectly and bacon was yummy (when is bacon not yummy?) the big surprise was the potatoes..diced very small and crispy with some seasoning i couldn't place right away. Then my husband said it tasted like bbq potato chips! Bingo thats what they tasted like! So so good. The service was also awesome ..very attentive. They have a cute little egg sign u flip over if you need anything and someone is over at your table in like 5 seconds! Love that! A neat feature to this place is they have a small arcade in the back with 3 pinball machines and a few video games. They had Addams Family pinball which happened to be one of my husbands favorites! Of course the challenge was on! its 50 cents for 1 game and only 75 cents for 2 players (bargain) . What do you guys think happened? Of course I let him win! ( men and their fragile egos you know! haha :)",

The owners clearly dont have an ounce of designer in them and basically massacred what should have been a warm inviting interior by painting the walls bright white and ruining the beamed tray ceiling by adding stark ceiling tiles and fluorescents everywhere. If you want an ounce of ambience with your dining experience skip this place. We had a two for one coupon which actually only had a value of $8 which was a buck or two less than the cost of their breakfasts offered so not really two for one. i got the country benny and my hubby got the chicken fried steak. He liked his real well, my eggs were runny and the whites undercooked even though i ordered them over medium. The works potatoes were a disappointment too as the name implies loaded goodness but the actual side was deemed \" the chicklet potatoes\" as they were tiny square hard fried dry potatoes covered in paprika and seasoning salt. The one bright thing was the waitress who was cheerful and quick. I would stick to mimis or cracked egg both around the corner.",

After she left in just a few minutes she returned slightly flustered and very honestly told us she had accidentally thrown our ticket away. After retaking our order she left and returned with two muffins. My wife asked why the muffin as she was not to get one. She smiled and reminded us it was for her gaffe regarding our ticket. She left and we chuckled about her being so concerned for forgetting knowing we'd probably forget where we parked our car until we left. Anyway breakfast was awesome and actually the order wasn't any longer to our table than normal. No thanks to Ashley. She also comped our drinks which she didn't need to do but again I think for the error. Its nice she had both the courage and obvious pride in her work to simply be honest. Taking full responsibility for anything today especially in a restaurant is rare. We'll return again for sure no doubt because of food but mostly because of service! Well done Ashley!

We went on Tues afternoon and were seated immediately in the middle of the restaurant, this is significant because no one took our order for over 20 min, tho many people walked by us. With our egg flipped a bus boy finally came to see what we needed and then sent a server over. The server informed us that we were not in his station but he would help us. Our food came promptly after that. As we were finishing our meal the hostess went around to all the children giving them balloons, but of course skipped our 3 yo. He started pointing and saying balloon, the hostess heard him, looked at him and ignored him. So I got up with him to get a balloon, as she was about to get him one someone walked up to pay and she made us wait to take care of the man paying, then FINALLY got my son a balloon. Just unexcepatable service. We will never go back to this location!   As a side note: I ordered the tostada salad without the meat or sour cream, so it is essentially $10.25 for iceberg, cheese and olives. I asked for ranch on the side and was charged .75. Just another irritation, as I would think they could consider ranch a substitute for the chicken it comes with.",

When he told our server, the server just said, \"oh sorry, I thought you wanted it inside the omelette,\" and never brought a side! LOL. I ordered a Works Skillet and was disappointed.  It was all potatoes and barely any bacon or sausage. I ate the eggs and as much of the sausage and bacon as I could find and when I was done, it looked like I had barely made a dent because there was so much of the potatoes.

The staff is friendly and inviting, and our waitress anticipated our needs very well.  The strawberry cream-cheese french toast is an absolute must. I would get all the dressings on the side that way you can add it to your own liking. Also the portions are gigantic! Either come with an empty tummy and big appetite, or share with your friend.",

No wait, and if you enjoy watching a well choreography establishment, those are the seats. Impressive team work between kitchen staff and servers.    Their paper menu reads like a news paper so their menu variety is huge. I should've asked for more time to mull over the menu...They offer from just eggs to oven baked pizza to jambalaya bowl.....but we had the loco moco and the country fried steak. Both were delicious and are big portions.  Their famous banana muffin was tasty but was very sticky to the fingers, a bus person saw me struggling to wipe my sticky fingers and give me extra napkins without me needing to ask.    Overall, we felt Egg Works has a comfortable atmosphere, great food and service....no surprise it's a local favorite.  We will be back",

My fiance and I shared the stuffed French toast with fruit and the country fried steak with their Habla diablo potatoes. We also got free banana nut muffins for checking in on yelp! The banana muffin was very good- moist and full of flavor. Then our entrees came... the potatoes were SO good! And they give you tons. I liked my stuffed French toast... if you're looking for something savory and sweet, this is a great option! The French toast was stuffed full of scrambled eggs and sausage links, and topped with powder sugar. Tastes great with the maple syrup too! My fiance's country fried steak was also delicious. The gravy was so good with the country fried steak!   This place is delicious, super affordable ($10 -$12 dishes) and has generous portions. What more can you ask for? I'll definitely be back when I come back to Vegas!",

I witnessed first-hand at how serious these employees are in ensuring our positive dining experience. It was amazing to watch these people work together as a team.  I heard this for the next 40-minutes while dining, \"I need a runner!\" \"I'll take it, what table does it need to go to.\"  The employees checking to make sure that the orders are correctly filled so the dish doesn't come back.  In a call center, we call this \"first call resolution\",  at Egg Works, this would mean that if the order is sent out correct the first time, then the server doesn't have to continue to go back and forth with getting the order correct.  And you know the food is good here. Efficient and productive.  It was refreshing to see that high-level of service. And because of that, I can easily give this place 5-stars!  Keep up the great work!",

If you are a coffee seinker they offer flavor creamer BTW.  The crazy chicken at this location is more cheesy than the other locations. Mine was loaded with cheese and even had cheese falling odd the omelette. What I also noticed was they put probably half an advocado in there. I'm not complaining because it was so good.  They do offer an egf white version for an extra $0.95.  Note' the omelette is huge. Definitely a shareable dish. The crazy chicken has adovcado, cheese, chicken, and mushrooms and a dap of sour cream. Take each bite with sour cream and it'll taste even better than ketchup.  My husband got the Brad's scramble. He stated that it was also too cheesy. Although he took off most of the cheese he really liked it. The brans scramble has no meat. Very vegetarian friendly.   Both dishses came with a side of potatoes and banana bread. Get the BANANA bread. And eat it with their soft butter. If you had to get one thing, just get the banana bread. If you check in, you'll get a free one. The potatoes has its own seasoning. It kinda taste like seasoning salt bit better. If you like it, they also sell it.   This location is located next to a McDonald's and a large shopping cennter. Good luck trying to find parking in front or on side of the restaurant. The complex connected to it has plenty of parking and it's a short walk.   Pricing here is decent for the amount of food you get. But it's cheaper with the Groupon.",

Sometimes we will have the most friendly servers and times we will get the basic of the bunch.  That's the only reason I didn't give it a solid 5 stars because there's no consistency.  Also this is not a con, but more of a caution there's a wait on weekends so be prepared.  At least 30 minutes or more depending on the number in your party.

I ordered the eggs on the side (over medium),so I could get the right ratio of egg to pizza.   When my food arrived (in flights, not all at once), I sliced the white part... egg snot and yolk ran everywhere.   They were barely over easy. I decided to send them back. I tried finding our server, but she was nowhere to be found.   I flagged down someone else. She took the eggs.   Then I waited. They never come.   When Mike finished eating, I decided that I'd waited long enough.   Our server walked by, and I said I was done. She asked, \"it wasn't good?\"  I said I was still waiting for my eggs. She had no idea they'd been sent back.   The manager came over.  I told him, this is the second time this has happened.   We won't be back.  Seriously, If you have \"EGG\" in your title, you should be able to cook an egg.   Fear not though, there's a McDonalds next door, and they know how to cook an egg.",

There is sufficient parking in the strip mall lot.  The varieties of eggs benedict are interesting but might have too many simultaneous flavors.  The basic eggs are nicely done and served along side potatoes or pancakes, depending on the dish ordered.  Waffles, interestingly, are ala carte and don't have a combination offering on the menu.  Pricing is average: not dirt cheap but not a wallet buster either.  Recommended for a nice, casual, relaxing breakfast/brunch.",

We wanted coffee and read our minds got us coffee and water right away. She should be on server olympics because it looks like she was serving the whole restaurant. She got our breakfast orders and was on top of everything. I don't know how she did it. She always checked on us and always asked us if we needed anything. Food was bomb!

    "text": "I eat at this location at least once a week. I sit at the counter and that has allowed me to become very friendly with the very outgoing and equally as friendly staff.  So besides a great and attentive staff, the menu has a huge selection of just about any which way you can order eggs. Then add in all the pancakes, burritos, burgers, pizza and it's insanely good, fresh and large portions. Their eggs works breakfast potatoes are awesome and I usually have to add ketchup to any type of potatoes except for theirs. All in all the food I've never had a dish I have not liked very much. If you don't like your dish they will replace it with anything else you do want and you will likely get a free muffin for your troubles. I also can't say enough about the laid back staff, great attitudes and very eager to help make you happy. That is a good enough reason for me to go at least once a week.",

    "text": "Came by here for a second time while the car was being worked on are server was Twila (as marked on the receipt) her service was good even though she had to come back to us 3 times because we were so indecisive about what to order and also wrangling a 7 month old and a 6 year old. She remained patient and friendly.  Overall food is okay nothing worth raging about had the Classic, the mouse pancake, the kids pizza, and the banana French toast. The kids pizza would probably feed 2 6 year olds and is a really good size for what you get. Good food is you aren't looking for any frills or surprises.  Hostess left more to be desired as I asked for a both and she ignored me the first time and when I repeated my self she pushed together a dirty table and a clean one.  Best part of the experience was Twila noticing our daughter was sucking on a piece of cantaloupe and noticed she was tearing it to pieces and brought us another one. Even though she forgot to bring the toast we asked for id give her a solid 4 stars good service attentive and patient everything I want in a server, also she did not charge us extra as many servers would to go half and half on fruit and potatoes on the classic which was definitely appreciated and will be reflected in her tip.  All in all a better hostess would have made this a bit better but as a no frills breakfast place it delivers and doesn't disappoint or wow.",

The interior is reminiscent of a greasy spoon with dark and uninspiring bland colors. The ambience doesn't do much to perk one's appetite and mood during breakfast.   On the condiment tray, there's a smiley egg and a frowny egg graphic that indicates whether or not you require more service. A.k.a, get their attention. The service can be friendly or you can also end up with a snooty waitress that tells you they don't do the frowning egg anymore. Well, why do you put it on the table then?  Can't give an opinion on their lunch items but their omelettes are pretty good. Overall, the food is decent and the banana muffin that comes with some meals will be bringing you back.",

The hash was a nice serving but it's fresh corner beef not canned....I actually prefer the canned and like when it's done crispy but this was still good! Haole loco looked good (but didn't try).  The banana muffin as always was very moist...yummy! We were overall very satisfied for about $20 and change. I'd recommend take out because their servers aren't very friendly and also not very friendly to kids (under age 5).  Both times we went there they just stuck us in a corner like we were an annoyance.  I must say that there are adults who are just as annoying of not more annoying that kids...so that's that.

We sit down, she comes up to the table \"drinks?\" -- my boyfriend then takes it upon himself to be polite and says \"hi\". She then says \"hi. Can I get you guys something to drink?\" .. Again, my polite boyfriend \"how are you?\" .. She responds \"good. Anything I can get you two to drink?\". Sure Marianne, because polite conversation with your guests is obviously like pulling teeth to you. We order two ice teas, she comes back, \"you guys ready?\" .. No, a few minutes please.. Comes back, \"good now?\" .. Sure. The service continued on like this until (without informing us) she left to go home and gave us to another server. Do not get Marianne. Politely ask for another server. Maybe she had an off day but I'd rather not start my day off with her bad attitude.",

Right as we were seated the server, Travis, came to make sure we were okay and gave us time to look over the menu. Once we decided what we were having, he got our order in right away and even checked on us before our food even got to us. Once we got our food, he checked on us a total of three times before we were ready to go. It was like he could sense if we needed something! The food was amazing and got to us in a timely matter! Definitely my favorite Egg Works in town!!",

Another couple walked in and started smoking - they were the only ones smoking and we were not the only ones it was bothering.  We asked about it being allowed and the server said she wasn't sure the situation when it was bothering other patrons so she got a manager.  Manager said she would move us inside.  So we were sitting there finishing our meal, they had just walked in and WE were the ones inconvenienced and given the \"opportunity\" to move?  Thanks, just the check please.  No apology, nothing.  I don't enjoy my morning coffee with someone else's secondhand smoke.",

It was nice because we were the last party to sit in that room so we had it all to ourselves. Our server Travis was very nice and attentive to our orders. Very accommodating and checked on us regularly. We ordered a variety things on the menu and let me just tell you, the dishes are HUGE. I ordered the corn beef hash and I barely made a dent on my plate. It came with eggs and toast and I ordered a side of white rice. The dish was very good. My kids ordered the Mickey chocolate chip pancakes which i thought was pretty cute. Even the kids portions were very generous. I will remember next time tho to just order 1 meal to split with my kids because the food was too much for us. So I would recommend have a very big appetite if you plan to come hear.

I got a traditional breakfast -- eggs with sausage and potatoes. All was good, BUT my plate was swimming in grease. Really. There was no reason for this. Yes, they were very busy, but can't the cook take another moment to lift the sausage (three large sausages) out of the pan and drain them -- put them on a paper towel  or something -- for a moment before plating them? It was really off-putting.  If you are a construction worker and need a huge pile of food to start the day, this is the place for you. Ridiculously gargantuan portions.",

    "text": "Living in North Vegas, it's a drive out of our way to eat here for breakfast, but we've done it more than once, as we prefer it to Egg & I on Sahara.  There's a bit more room to breathe in this location -- people aren't bumping their asses into you while you're trying to eat your bacon and the staff is ultra friendly and FAST!  We went this past Saturday, ordering an omelette and a classic breakfast. Before we even finished checking in online, our meals were in front of us -- almost TOO fast, actually. I hardly had time to enjoy my coffee. But we couldn't blame them for being efficient.   We usually end up taking half of our breakfast home and making breakfast tacos for dinner with the leftovers, so it's a great deal at roughly $24 (considering we get two meals out of it).   I do take issue with the frozen cubed season-salt \"homestyle\" potatoes they server (just like Egg & I). I wish they would make fresh hashbrowns.   The parking can be a little tricky, but there's plenty of places to park if you're willing to walk more than 10 feet.  This is part of the regular rotation of breakfast joints now, for sure.",

I asked for my eggs to be prepared medium, but unfortunately they arrived runny. The yolks were running out of my eggs before I even took my first bite.  The ciabatta bread was good and came nice and warm. It was moist with a bit of a chew and slight crust. The two fried eggs, like I said, were under cooked for my taste and under seasoned as well. I added some black pepper, but I only ate one half because I could not get over the runny yolk. The bacon was pretty good. It had good flavor and was well cooked. I took it out of the second half of the sandwich I did not eat and ate it. You can choose bacon, turkey bacon, or sausage for the sandwich. In addition to under cooked yolk, the sandwich was very basic and needed something to spruce it up, perhaps a sauce or sliced avocados would suffice.  The potatoes were little rectangular prism and were fried well to a golden brown. They were seasoned well enough and with a red pepper spice here and there. The tasted pretty good. Service was good and quite friendly and enthusiastic.",

    "text": "Omg did I just find my new go to breakfast spot! Sunday morning,  the parking lot was packed and we figured this place must have some good food.  Gave them my name and requested a table for 4. They asked for my phone number to text when the table is ready.  10 mins later, it's ready.  We were taken to to a dining area that had that AC blasting.  Ummmm oh no . I can't eat on an igloo boo. Sat in a different area and got to ordering. Coffee was very good. My veggie skillet was so amazing. The seasoning on the potatoes had a great taste. It made all of us keep talking about those potatoes.  The portions were so filling.  You could ask for smaller portions but why? I usually go to hash house because i do like their portions but the menu is boring now.  Here,  they have such a large selection of food to choose from, you'll say forget there and come here",

The variety of breakfast is important to me because I am not usually a fan of breakfast food. There is something for everyone here. My favorites are the Greek scramble and veggie Benny. This time I got the Huevos Rancheros with pork carnitas and tomatillo salsa. Absolutely delicious! Their side potatoes are so good and they always give generous portions. My absolute favorite thing to get every time I come here is their warm banana nut muffin! I could eat those all day. If you are ever looking for a great breakfast spot, this is a place to check out!",

Upon arrival, the staff was super attentive from start to finish. The menu is printed to look like you're reading a newspaper. SO CUTE! I ordered a coffee along with the Classic. My favorite thing about this dish was the habla diablo potatoes...so crispy mmmm. I will definitely be back to try their other breakfast dishes soon hehe. Also, don't forget to check-in to take advantage of that free banana nut muffin!",

This place has a good country home feel.  The first thing I noticed as I walked through the doors was the country music coming from the speakers, that's the way to my heart.  As soon as I sat down, our server, Nic came to greet us happily.  And brought my banana nut muffin upon check in, super quick. Along with my coffee.  The perfect pair.  I ordered the country Benny, I was feeling for something with smoked salmon, but couldn't find anything on the menu with it. So I went the completely unhealthy route of country gravy covered everything.  I'm not opposed to this choice.  It was great!",

The wife and I have been coming to Egg Works for years. The Brad's scramble is usually my go to meal but today I tried the carrot cake French toast and the wife had an Eggs-ceptional fresh veggie omelette. The omelettes are prepared with four large eggs, sand come with Hablo Diablo seasoned potatoes and toast or the mouth watering divine banana nut muffin. The veggie omelette is made with diced onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, green bell peppers and fresh spinach, topped with cheddar and jack cheeses.   Gotta love the cute egg decorations and the metal egg flipper on each table to let your server know if you are happy or need service.  Sprinkle some hot sauce on the omelette and a little ketchup for the potatoes and prepare yourself for meal you won't soon forget 5/5!  The carrot cake French toast was good but very dense, it was served with warm apple compote and maple syrup 3.5/5. Personally I prefer more fluffy French toast but I did see many people trying it. Will be back next time for an omelette for sure.  Enjoy the pics and give an omelette a try with the best seasoned fried potatoes ever!  **PS Yelp check in offer: Free Banana Nut Muffin! Take it to go and enjoy it later.",

We order two classic Benedict's it came with pork bacon.I don't eat pork but I don't like to throw food so I had to eat it. Btw it was too thick and it's not classic thin bacon. Yikes....Beside that everything was good, hollandaise sauce was best of the best!!! I got free muffin as a yelper which was really good add to my coffee haha.  I have only one tip for this place: please guys add to your menu lox (salmon) Benedict. You have all type egg Benedict's even with turkey but my favorite is only lox.",

It's right next to a McDonald's and a few other stores, so while there's ample parking we did have to circle around once before we found a spot. We arrived on a Saturday around 10AM and our group of 6 only had to wait ~15 minutes.  Service was wonderful. Our server found out it was our first time at Egg Works, so she gave us each a free banana nut muffin, which was mouth watering, especially when enhanced with a little butter. I ordered stuffed french toast (two pieces of french toast with scrambled eggs, cheese, and bacon in between). It was just the right amount of sweet and savory. Many of their plates come with their habla diablo potatoes, which are deliciously seasoned and cut so that each piece is enjoyably crispy.   If you're tired of the overpriced and overhyped food on the strip, come to Egg Works for a satisfying meal.",

I visited the establishment on a rather busy weekend, right before brunch was over, and I ordered the carrot cake French toast. I'm usually a HUGE fan of anything carrot cake, but this just wasn't doing it for me, and I thought it needed a little something extra (perhaps cream cheese icing?) I mentioned it to my boyfriend while we were eating our meal, and I didn't even notice our server was walking right behind me as I was saying it. He apologized for my disappointment and asked if I could do anything that could make it better. Of course, me, being embarrassed said no no, and kept eating it. Then the manager came by and offered to comp the meal and recommended to give me a side of whipped cream to go improve the taste of \"something missing\"...unfortunately it did not.  On the other hand, my boyfriend absolutely loved his meal, and our shared side of their infamous potatoes was great!  The only reason why I gave this establishment 4 stars instead of 5 was because of how bland my own meal was, but I was floored by the fantastic customer service at the establishment. I definitely want to visit again, just based off of that experience with the employees alone. Thank you!",

Portion sizes are big and I couldn't finish it all so I suggest you bring a good appetite. If you check in on yelp you get a free muffin (well I got one)!  The muffin tasted like a banana nut bread cake. For brunch they have all the alcoholic drinks that are considered socially acceptable before 5 pm.  Place is casual. Staff was friendly and helpful.  Conclusion : grab some friends/family and meet up for brunch.",

Then the manager gives me some complete BS sounding excuse of \"the owner has been busy putting together a gluten free menu and it's hard to get a calorie menu.\" Then Shyra, the manager says \"I don't know how calories work.\" When I  asked if she knew how many calories were in a specific item. Just unacceptable.",

The place is very cozy and a welcoming environment its our second time being here and we came back because the good feeling that the waitress gave us. This time we had the pleasure to have veronica as our server and she was the best of all.. I really wish that i would get this good feeling every where i go to eat.. She made the food experience much better and like i said before the food is all ready good so it just made it to perfect.. I really cant remember the last time i sat in a place while smiling throughout the whole meal!",

    "text": "Egg works isn't my go to restaurant for breakfast but they do have great customer service everything I go there. I love love LOVEEEEEE their banana nut muffins. Every time I go, I always have to get it. I find a entree that comes with banana nut muffin so I can get some banana nut muffin. LOL! Their muffins are really moist which probably means A LOT of butter so if you're on a diet BEWARE. These little devils are delicious!!! I would say not to order the simple dishes. I was trying to eat a little healthier the other day.. so I went with a simple eggs, turkey sausage and asked for hash browns. I love hash browns so I was pretty disappointment in my meal this time. I got two hash browns with two eggs and two turkey sausage patties. First off, the hash browns looked like they were from McDonald's and I wasn't even sure if the turkey sausages were actually made out of turkey. I guess that's the risk you take when you go out to eat though. I expect more from Egg Works I guess you can say. Another sad thing is my friend thought the hash browns at McDonald's were better! Hahah which I thought was a little funny but in a way it made me hate my meal a little more. The work potatoes taste a little hollow too and you can tell they're from the freezer. Each mean is around $10-$15 I would say. If I actually got fresh food, I wouldn't mind paying 10 bucks for it (Just saying).   They have a bunch of other great options but not for if you're trying to eat healthy and out with your friends. At least I haven't found any I guess.   I love their stuffed french toast and their waffles with ham and eggs (drools). They have a bunch of other options as well on their cool newspaper menu.   I say the customer service is amazing because one time we waited for I would say a little over 20 minutes. The waiter for our table gave our party each a free muffin - there were four people at my table. We were pretty happy campers. I mean.. a little after he gave us those muffins, we got our food. I even remember the manger getting me water all the time. I must say that water is really what I use to determine if a place has good customer service because I drink A LOT of water.   The parking isn't too bad since you can usually go on the other side of 7-11 and park. It gets really packed over the weekend but during the week you can find a spot behind the restaurant.  Also if it is over the weekend expect to wait a good 20 minutes or so.",

This location is seemingly better in popularity than the one on Sunset, and I've heard that the one on sunset road has more grease, and does not look/deem too tasty to others.  I was with my friends and we had Blade serve us--she was great! Really chill and laid back, but willing to always be alert to everything and anything that we needed. She was courteous, and made sure our orders were all placed and correctly written down.  Our food took a maximum of only about ten to fifteen minutes to come out.",

I was a little worried with the wait time, because there was absolutely no parking.  We parked all the way in the back behind McDonald's.  I checked in and we received banana walnut muffin as a thank you for coming in.  Great recommendation to eat it with butter.  My husband loved it, I'm allergic to nuts, so he saved me from the calories.   He ordered the prime rib egg benedict with potatoes.  It was delicious!  I'm surprised with the potatoes side was so tasty. The egg was cooked perfectly. The steak wasn't tough or chewy.  Definitely a winner!  I ordered their Stromboli The Club.  We did have a few issues with this one.  First they dropped it on the floor after it was ready to go.  They had to remake it.  Then they delievered the wrong Stromboli - The Classic, I was confused for a second when I asked our waitress for ranch, because my order was supposed to have ranch as a side.  She came back with ranch and said she doesn't think it's the right order.  Good thing I didn't eat it yet.  I was trying to remember what I ordered.  Lol, It's ok, I wasn't in a rush to eat since I'm pregnant and ate before we got there.  We really appreciate it with the communication that was given for the mess up.  I wasn't upset or anything.  We're very thankful, she took care of my order for the Stromboli drama.  So for the Stromboli - The Club, it was surprisingly tasty too!  I really liked the garlic buttery crust.  It was filled with great amount of meat and cheese and a touch of diced tomatoes.  The ranch gave it a nice touch, making it less salty and heavy.  I would order it again.   We'll definitely be back!  Thank you for taking care of us!",

I ordered the Santa Cruz skillet and it was awesome the eggs where perfect I got them over easy and I know that it can be hard for some places to get that right, and instead of the toast or banana bread I asked if I can get the biscuits with gravy which was an extra $2.50 but it was good and my boyfriend ordered the chicken fried steak skillet and it was bomb as well, we both really enjoyed our food the potatoes are seasoned so good that you won't wanna stop eating even when your already full and the portions size was really big and filling. Our server was Haley I believe and she was awesome, very friendly and constantly checking on us. The food did take a bit to get to us but totally worth the wait, overall great place and great food definitely recommend",

They did not have good staffing there that day like at the other locations, they were understaffed, our food took forever to come out and it came out messed up: I asked for light cheese and they smothered it in cheese and also asked for avocado and yet the still charged it on the bill. I couldn't wait and send back my order for them to fix it because I was already starving and the server was too busy, so I ate it, but I let the server know about the mess up so she can address it with the manager. She was understanding but the manager didn't even come talk to us and she just told our server that she doesn't believe us and wouldn't take it off. It 1000% did not come with the avocado I ordered so I went and confronted the manager and tried to explain it to her but she was not having it. Extremely rude and lazy manager! She should've been helping her stressed out server instead of just standing around at the front reception... Bad work ethic.",

One of the must-gets is the Banana nut muffin! Usually it's included as an option with many of the entrees, but if not, be sure to check into yelp, and get one for FREE!!   Recently, it was my first time at this location and I've been to other locations though. All have had good, friendly service. For warned, expect to wait, on average, 20-40min minutes on peak breakfast and lunch times as well as weekends*. But it's so worth it. It gives you time to look over the extensive menu anyway.

Next time we go I'm eager to try the pizzas! My girlfriend ordered the Hawaiian plate and I ordered my usual haole loco which was pretty good. I have noticed everywhere makes it different, it's not always that bad.   Service was fantastic and the food came out in a timely matter!",

A group of friends and I were visiting Vegas from Boston for a bachelor party and she was the best part of our breakfast. Which is saying A LOT since the food is delicious and inexpensive, and the portions are huge! Five of us ate and had drinks for $100, had food leftover, and were full for hours after.  Tina was super attentive, incredibly friendly, and made us all want to hang out with her later. If we could have come back here during our short trip we would have - both for the food and for Tina!",

We had a group of 20 and we were seated within an hour. Our server was Raul. He was extraordinary! I've never been served food that well! He took our orders and the food was out in minutes. Depending on what you order, the food can be great. Honestly, I couldn't remember what I ordered, everyone else's food around me was way better! My sister's husband got this gumbolaya that blew my mind. The blackened prime rib eggs were delicious. The Michilada was ginormous. The waffle wasn't crispy and that is generally how I like my Belgium waffles. My other sister complained the fruits were not that fresh but I really didn't mind them. My other brother in-law got the country fried steak which was great too! The food is really up to your preference. The house potatoes which resembles hashbrowns were amazing and so were the free banana nut muffin when you check in with yelp. My sisters ordered extra to take home. Great place! I highly recommend it :)",

My favorite dish here is the chile relleno omelet. It's enough food for an entire week and a guaranteed hangover cure. I usually drink 10 cups of really good black coffee while dining here. The food and karma is infinitely better than the Cracked Egg and Nancy is a great server. :)",

We stumbled across Egg Works and thought we'd give it a shot, and I'm SO glad we did!   Our server was Nancy and she was a rockstar. There's nothing I love more than a friendly server who keeps my drink refilled. Nancy was also awesome in that she flawlessly nailed all four of our orders. (We all had breakfast burritos modified differently.)   Speaking of the breakfast burrito... SO GOOD! I subtracted bacon from mine and added avocado, and it was the best burrito I've ever had. The works potatoes that came with it were great too. The salsa served with it was so good I probably could've eaten it by itself. I also had a side of hollandaise sauce that was awesome too.   I'm so happy we stumbled on this place and will definitely be back next time we're in town!!",

The menu is extensive, but I had no problem finding something I would love. I ended up at the banana pancakes, eggs over easy, bacon and a side of sourdough toast. My friend ordered one of the many skillets offered. Her breakfast must've been perfect because she annihilated that skillet and didn't talk to me for the entire time we sat for breakfast. My breakfast, too, was excellent. The pancakes were light and fluffy. My eggs were cooked perfectly. And because they leave the carafe at the table, we were never without coffee.  Don't let the line to get in deter you. There were tons of people waiting to get in, but it only took us 15 minutes to get a table. The wait staff was friendly and attentive.

Once we were seated are very attentive waitress Mary came and it was like 'BANG BANG BANG' Seriously. She was good! She got our drinks, took our orders, got a banana nut muffins and about 10 minutes or less later, our food was out at our table. How awesome was that? They are really organized or the cooks are secretly Superman or have some sort of secret powers.     The food was awesome as always! I had the California Crepe and it came with their special potatoes. I call it special because its the bomb.   My husband had the corn beef. I think it's called hashed something. That was actually really good. It was perfectly seasoned. It came with your choice of scrambled or sunny side up eggs. Oh and special potatoes.  My son had the sliced bacon and avocado omelette (well that's what my son thought he ordered. he couldn't remember the name) and I know it was good because he demolished it within 5 minutes. Not to mention those servings are HUGE!!!  My daughter had the Mickey Mouse pancakes which came with a child size drink. Their buttermilk pancakes are also as good as everything else on the menu.   Overall the good is A+ and to too it off the customer service is on point. They make it point to take care if their customers. Their was a nice lady that came by our table and asked us how everything was going. Told her that our server Mary was awesome. I like that they do that. It shows that they do care.  Kuddos guys! Keep up the great work. We will be coming by again!   BTW I thought about taking pictures but the food look so good and was so hungry that skipped it LOL",

The workers all wore shirts/jerseys representing their favorite football teams, which was awesome.  Server was super friendly, and the atmosphere was very family friendly.  I ordered the chicken fried steak skillet. The menu says skillets come with two over easy eggs, but she said all the menu items can be done with any preparation of eggs, so I subbed in poached eggs. The bottom had delicious potatoes, topped with chicken fried steak, country gravy, and two poached eggs. DELICIOUS!  My boyfriend ordered the prime rib benny. We were honestly expecting slices of prime rib, but they were just small pieces. It was good, regardless.  We could not finish our food though! The server told us that all of the menu items can be ordered as a half-size, so I'll have to do that next time I come!  Overall a great brunch place with great food and great people!",

While I've lived close to this location for the good part of a year, I haven't stopped in until now, because I know that they're a little on the pricy side.  I had the California Crepe: \"Diced bacon, sliced mushrooms, diced tomatoes, guacomole and Swiss cheese. It is served with a side of Hollandaise sauce.\" Hollandaise sauce was great, the crepe was REALLY stuffed full and I enjoyed it. It came with a banana muffin and home fries.  My sister had The Classic: \"Two eggs cooked any style with Works potatoes\" with toast. She ate about half of the plate and had the rest to go.  My brother had the blueberry pancake and our waitress, Nancy, upsold us on adding eggs and bacon so his meal came out to more than $9. My brother said his pancake tasted rubbery and that the eggs made his stomach hurt. Once he got home he said his head was hurting and ended up going to be bed early. I think he had a reaction to the blueberry sauce - I'm assuming it has corn syrup in it, which bothers him.   My youngest sister had the kid's meal mouse pancake and she ate about half.  While it seems like my meal was by far the best and our waitress was great, our breakfast for 2 kids and 2 adults came out to $46 with tip. Yikes! Not sure it was worth that price.",

The variety and selection of breakfast dishes is extensive and printed on a Sunday New York Times sized menu.  My wife selected the chicken fried steak skillet...it was yummy and came with skillet potatoes, sliced chicken fried steak, your choice of eggs, and a delicious pork white gravy.    I opted for the blackened Prime Rib Skillet, which came with skillet potatoes, poached eggs, spinach on a croissant (I substituted english muffins), and smothered with hollandaise sauce.  I was however,  very disappointed with the prime rib as the meat was dried up and the size of bacon bits...certainly not like the slices of prime rib that I had envisioned.  Service was prompt however and I think we will be back to try other selections (I mean they had sooooo many breakfast selections that I am sure there are ones to please us both).  I may have to try the stuffed chili relleno, or the stuffed french toast next time.    All in all...huge selection, prompt service and a great place to go when you are hungry for a HUGE breakfast!",

Never again.   This time I decided to try something...classic,  chicken fried steak it iz.  Of course nothing beats Rise and Shine's CFS and that Country Cafe place in Mountain's Edge ain't half bad as well.  Mr. Mama's was aight or shop I thought, it's actually leaps and bounds over Egg Works sadly.  Again wroth the damn niblets!  Not only that, it was way over cooked and got me thinking that it was not made to order and most likely pre-prepped, boo!    The wifey had the Works Crepe which was way better than what I got,  had we paid full price and not used the Groupon, I just might be cussing as you read this.  I love me some breakfast around the clock,  especially the simple dishes.  I think from here on I will stick to what I know and only go worth the fail safe items here from now on.   Unlimited poor your own coffee simplified things without having to hunt anyone down and can't go wrong with marmalade on toast, otherwise,  pretty mediocre of you ask me and can make something better at the casa.",

If you've been to Egg & I  then this place will be very familiar.  We went New Years Eve for brunch.  I think we got there at the right time because the line to pay was LONG and the line to be seated was practically non existent.  We were seated right away.  Our server came quickly and was quite friendly.  We ordered our food and in less than 10 mins our food came out, just like at Egg & I.    We'll be back!",

But I must say there food was good. I do not like any type of muffins or food with banana in it unless its just a plain banana on its own but their muffins were Delicious with a capital D!    I had the chicken fried steak breakfast plate was very yummy, love the potatoes they had some type of seasoning on them... I thought that they were so good. The portion sizes are huge. The kids portion sizes were huge as well my kids really enjoyed their pancakes. Great selection and a wide selection at that. Service was a little slow but very polite and they did apologize for that. Would like to try a few more things from the menu.",

    "text": "Wow! I'm so impressed! The food is great...but more impressed by our most awesome server Raul! :)   Let's start off first by saying that the wait for a table wasn't bad at all for a Sunday morning Brunch. About 15 minutes. We wanted to try something not so Denny's or IHOP....we actually were on our way to The Cracked Egg but ended up here by accident...a pure mistaken identity for the other egg place (???...don't ask I just told him to turn in here...) It gets crowded and kind of cold in that little waiting area just inside the doorway but they do seat you as promptly as possible. LOOK and READ all of the specials they have on the chalkboard at the entrance before you go in! They have a pretty good spread for an egg restaurant lol!   The ambience is a very cozy warm family friendly atmosphere. We sat down and was a little unsure of the menu...as we had no idea it was a menu at first glance...Lots of reading...so bring your reading glasses!...The Awesome Raul took our order...He was kind enough to run back to the front to tell me exactly what the firecracker(somethin...somethin...) was. I don't remember what it's called...but it's pretty much chili cheese breakfast nachos with potatoes on the side and choice of toast or muffin...yummy!   The food came out and was all delicious and well worth the dollar amount...Raul was very attentive to all the patrons he served and what impressed us so much was his genuinity...he shows he cares about every patrons experience and doesn't stress under pressure. He is definitely management material! Hubs and I rave about this restaurant mostly because of the service and not just from Raul but from all the servers there as well! His name is the only one that stuck because we interacted with him most.  So here is the score: Restaurant cleanliness - Four Star  Menu - Four.Five Star (lots of reading little time before ordering lol)  Service - Five Star  Food - Five Star  Parking - Three Star (lot is kinda small)  Total score:...Five Star (yes my math is wrong...but it's soooooo right)   Would I come back again...absolutely! Would I refer to a friend...HYFR! Would I go back to Denny's?...only if I'm not in Las Vegas and craving breakfast.",

They are big - offers variety of menu items. Something for everyone~ Maybe my expectations were too high.  They seemed to be the local favorite and many come for their breakfast . Morning we visited, they were packed. Ordered the country benny and hubs had their smoked chicken chorizo platter. Only strong flavor we tasted was salt. I couldn't really taste the home style, hearty, & tasty breakfast I was expecting. Yeah, since they serve many - they have to cook fast and it shows. The only saving grace was the free banana nut muffin that you receive when you check in. It was moist and you can definitely taste the banana, a very tasty muffin!  Maybe their sweet breakfast menu items are better?  Their savory dishes we ordered did not impress me at all. I liked that we were given the insulated carafe of coffee so we can top off our coffees. Not too memorable or worth driving out there from the strip in my opinion.",

My grief was actually with my meal itself, not the preparation but the actual recipe. I flat out didn't like it all all and neither did my wife.   We ordered the Biscuits and Gravy with a side of sausage, no eggs and with the potatoes.  The gravy was thick, jiggly and tasted like it was seasoned with ham (rather than a country sausage). Biscuit itself was warm and fluffy, so no complaints there.  The potatoes I think were my absolute least favorite. They were like the grocery freezer section \"home fries\" heavily tossed in seasoning salt. The side of sausage was plain and bland and I thought the price for the side was excessive (4$ per side order). Bottom line for me was that everything was extremely salty and just plain didn't sit well.   Again, service was great, checkout was good, menu was large, item appeared to be prepared to spec. I just plain did not like my meal.   Compared to Black Bear Diner or Metro Diner, this was very disappointing.",

I ordered this on my first trip and thought is was good. They use more cheese on top than I prefer but overall is was a decent first impression. This time , I order it and took it home instead of dinning in.  When I cut in the omelette, I immediately ran into something almost rock hard. An omelette should never be rock hard for any reason; maybe some resistance depending on what's in it but NEVER hard. I manage to work around it and when I looked, it was a piece of avocado.  I set it aside and continue eating.....until I ran into the same thing. At this point I peeled the omelette open and ALL of my avocado slices looked like the image below. EVERY SINCE PIECE ALMOST AS HARD AS A ROCK!! Don't you have quality control?! Doesn't SOMEONE in the back feel the avocados to make sure they're ripe?! I felt the resistance trying to cut into the omelette so I know the person who made it felt the EXACT same thing......and they still used it. What's the point in ordering that specific omelette if I can't even eat the avocado?! At that point, I threw my meal away. I won't be back to that location or probably any for that matter. All it takes is one bad avocado to ruin it for the rest.",

But let me tell you that the wait would have been worth it.  Since we sat at the counter we saw how everything goes down! From placing the order to hearing that little bell ring. We saw how the ladies and gentleman worked together to get all the plates nice and ready with all the appropriate sides and hits of powdered sugar. It was actually very interesting and it made me appreciate everything that they were doing because sometimes when it's busy in restaurants everyone thinks the chefs and waiters are moving slow but boy there is so much more to it.  With many of the breakfast items it comes with a banana nut muffin or a piece of toast, I highly recommend the muffin. It is absolutely superb! Especially when it's nice and warm.  Our waitress Marianne was excellent. Great customer service and she was just on top of making sure we were ok through out our meal. I strongly recommend this breakfast spot and if this one is too far the other locations are just as great!",

Once inside I was greeted by a couples of friendly ladies in the front.  Talk about world class service!  I told her it was my first time here and she welcomed me and asked me where I would like to sit so I choose to sit in the booth area.  Marianne was my server and I must say she had the most friendliest vibe about her and so upbeat!  She was so nice and make sure I was taken care of.  She knew it was my birthday and gave me a complimentary warm banana nut muffin!  It was sooooo good!  I had the mashed potato omelette with turkey bacon that came with hash browns and toast which was recommended and let me tell you...DE-LI-CIOUS!  Def I recommend this too!  If you want great service and food, please go see them, you will not be disappointed!  Tip:  I bought a Groupon/Living Social voucher and it includes the alcoholic drinks as well!  I will def go back to them again when I'm back in the area again!",

In a nutshell---  Pros- Great comfort food with large portions, casual atmosphere that is great for the kids, typically you get friendly service from the staff, you can call ahead and order to go if you don't want to deal with the crowds.  Cons- It's usually busy and there's a wait. Also, the parking absolutely sucks. It's hard to find a spot....  For this visit, I ordered an egg salad salad sandwich. The bread was toasted to perfection and the egg salad was delicious. My daughters French Toast was wonderful as well as our groups other two orders. I love the fries here! They're really skinny fries loaded with salty seasoning!! YUM!   My tip for this place is to just call ahead your order and get it to go. Then you don't have to deal with the crowds. :)",

There's something refreshing about a non-hipster breakfast joint that is not trying too hard.  From the country chic decor to the consistently good breakfast food and strong coffee, this place earns a regular spot in my breakfast rotation.    I've had a number of good dishes, but my go to is the South of the Border skillet, half size, because the regular portion is humongous.  It's off menu but worth the hassle of asking for it, because it's just that good.  Chicken, potatoes, jalapenos, onions, green peppers cooked together and topped with tons of cheese and an egg any style.  With food this good, there is no need to \"deconstruct\" it, give it a fancy name and slap a $19 price tag on it.",

I lucked out by mentioning that I wanted eggs and sausage with my pancakes and it turned out they actually have that breakfast combo, but it's just not listed on the menu. If you like sausage, I suggest the links over the patty.  And if you're a coffee drinker like me, you'll appreciate the carafe of coffee they leave for you on the table and the flavored creamers in addition to just the regular creamer! And they have plenty of healthy choice options you too.  It turns out that our waitress Rachelle was new and was still being trained. She was awesome! Very friendly and attentive! She did a great job!! We actually thought she was training the guy who was helping her .  We'll definitely be back the next time we're in town!",

Last Saturday was the day we finally decided to check it out. I was still apprehensive thinking that we most likely would have a long wait as this place appeals to locals and tourists alike. Surprisingly though, at around 11:30 there was no wait at all, probably because the morning rush had passed. Though the place was packed it didn't feel over crowded, the restaurant has a nice lay out. We were given a corner booth that was just perfectly sized and was kinda like your own private area.  Their menu is extensive and is creatively in a form of a newspaper. So cute! lol. I was glad I had my mind set on what to get as I perused the menu online ahead of time, or else I probably would've spent a good minute deciding as my husband did.   I got the Spinach benny ($10.55), coffee ($2.75), hubby opted for Corned beef hash ($11.25), hot chocolate ($2.75), kids each got a kids meal: Mickey mouse pancake with added blueberries and comes with a strip of bacon and a drink ($6.25) and Buckaroo which is toast, egg, bacon and a drink ($4.50) All meals except for the Mickey mouse pancake came with a side of their famous Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes which judging by the name I thought was gonna be painfully spicy but thankfully wasn't, they were actually quite delicious! The food was very filling and satisfying, everyone was happy with their respective orders. Although for me, the hollandaise sauce on the benny was a tad rich and thick. I could only eat one. I can't wait to come back and try their omelets though.  Service was very commendable, Sandra was attentive but not overbearing. She brought everything we needed before we could even ask for it. We only had to turn our sign once and that was to ask for a to go box when we were ready to leave. Prices are reasonable for portions you get and comparable to most breakfast joints. All in all this place has what it takes for continued success and worthy of all the positive reviews it's garnered.   Don't forget to check in with Yelp to claim your free Banana nut muffin you can take home for dessert ;)",

There is a wide opening in the wall there between the bench and our table. One customer who was waiting kept coughing without covering her mouth, right into my bf face. So we asked to move. We told the hostess and just waited a minute to find an open table. They didn't make a big deal about it and were nice about it.....except for our server.   He wanted us to move to a table nearby but we waited on the hostess to tell us where to go since we didn't wanna mess up any seating arrangement with the other people waiting.  He seemed mad we moved and we even saw him talking to our new server Natalia about us and shaking his head.   Look, no one likes some random stranger coughing near their face right before they eat. Either get a glass partitioner or some kind of divider at the wall or don't seat people there so close to people waiting. As for the server he should of had some kind of understanding why we moved. Nothing personal.",

Girlfriend got an eggs Benny as usual and enjoyed it, nothing crazy special, but it tasted good. Overall good experience",

I had a half serving of French toast and a half serving of the omelet with toast and hashbrowns! MY GOODNESS! Wayyyyy too much food! Hubby had the parfait and he said it was too sweet, so, I would not suggest that. All items seem to be over the top.. Super buttery toast, which was nice..

Haha, good thing it is so easy to navigate Vegas.   Cute breakfast spot, reminds me of those local joints in SD, and SB. Not a diner but a place focused on eggs, pancakes, and all things breakfast.   Worth a visit, good service and it's where the locals are! My favorite part was the \"happy face\" egg sign that you flip over if you need something. it turns into a sad face. Awwwwww.   The kids breakfast menu has spaghetti for breakfast. How amazing.   Would love a calm quiet place like this to sit and read over coffee and breakfast (that isn't ihop! ) cuz millbrae pancake house, stacks, and the like are not the place to lounge over breakfast. Somehow I think we'd be kicked out of stacks if we sat there w ipads and newspapers on a Sunday morning....",

But since we sat at the bar, we didn't have to wait. I ordered the chicken and spinach skillet, and my wife ordered the corned beef hash. Both of us found our dishes to be extremely salty. The potatoes in my skillet made it really salty, and my wife's corned beef was salty...as well as her potatoes. The service was fine, but other than that, I don't find anything special about this place...I most likely won't come back.  I would rather go to the pancake house on ft apache or babystacks cafe.",

Ordered our drinks from the busser and then had three different waitresses try to take our order in the next several minutes. They seemed a bit confused, but were all very nice.     Ordered a corona from the busser.  We had no menus yet, so I asked how much it would be. He said $3.50. Menu said $4.50.   Ordered the cabo breakfast burrito and the eggs benedict pizza.  Both were barely edible.   The chorizo in the burrito was so overcooked that is was like ground beef left out overnight and tasted nothing like chorizo, salsa was out of a jar or can, there was maybe a tablespoon of sour cream on top, eggs were wet and rubbery, tortilla was old and the red sauce on top was like the stuff you get with the dollar frozen enchilada meals at the grocery store.  $10  Pizza dough was not cooked through before the hollandaise sauce was put on so it was wet and rubbery. The sauce was lacking flavor and too salty. The eggs were cooked perfectly. Should have ordered three eggs. $13  Breakfast potatoes were cubed and rolled in seasoned salt. More dry than crispy.  NO HASH BROWNS!  They did however have those potato pucks that McDonalds serves.   Tab was just at $30 plus tip  when we were done. Waste of money.",

The wait might seem long but they always get us in faster than expected, like magic. Parking is a little tough so go before the rush.",

We will be coming here more often! Thank you for being great to us Ky!",

They have outside and inside seating. The service sitting outside was not so great, but it's worth it if it's a nice sunny day :D   Excellent breakfast spot. And great if your trying to eat light and healthy as well. The menu has a variety of options, eggs (durr) waffles, pancakes, breakfast meats, potatoes, fruit, yogurt, and the absolute best part MIMOSAS AND SCREWDRIVERS. I wasn't impressed with the mimosas but holy moly the screwdriver was served in a mason jar and deceptively strong :D  I had two eggs, WHEAT Banana pancakes, and a fruit granola parfait. The eggs were de-lish, especially when I sprinkled some of the provided greensauce on them. I admired how they made the pancakes with real cut banana slices cooked inside them. And I think the menu description \"short-stack\" is somewhat of an understatement, try HUGE ROUND STACK of three pancakes. Also, try sharing them with someone else, too much for one in my opinion- unless you're a beast. The fruit parfait was disappointing- too much yogurt, not enough granola or fruit.   Of course this chain of restaurants is most famous for their banana nut muffin- and yes- have one, you won't regret it. Overall, great spot for an early breakfast with friends and fam.",

The carnitas was really tasty and my eggs were prepared perfectly over medium. I'm not a fan of the potatoes here for some reason. I think it might be the shape and seasoning they use. Just give me some crispy hash browns and I'm a happy dude. The sliced pineapple was super sweet and the quantity of my dish was huge. Couldn't even get close to finishing the entree.

You get seated fairly quickly - the longest I've had to wait was 10 minutes.   I've never, ever had a bad meal here. My favorite is the veggie Benny. I love poached eggs. The omelets are always great, and I am also a fan of their huevos rancheros. I usually get a side of hash brown patties in place of the Works potatoes, only because I'm tired of them. My boyfriend likes their pancakes with blueberries. He often orders the skillet breakfasts too. I usually get one of their delicious Bloody Marys, yum. It is served in a mason jar with celery and garlic-stuffed olives.   I was pleasantly surprised to see they are the only Egg Works who are open for dinner. Their pizza is quite tasty. Yes, the bright fluorescent lighting is a little harsh any time of day - BUT - if you sit in the room to the right when you first walk in (has a fake fireplace) the lighting is dimmer and more homey. They even have a good selection of wine, which I was impressed.   The service is always friendly and fast. They have outdoor seating as well, and plenty of big flat screen TVs that are usually on the news or ESPN (yay!)",

Hostess and waitstaff covered in tattoos and greasy hair highlighted every color of the rainbow. Sat at a freezing cold table in the middle of this mess and when asked for a booth, was told it was all they had (I counted 3 empty booths). Really??? Then the hostess said \"pretty much\". Yeah, I don't think so. Decided we wanted a better dining experience, so we left. Not paying for dirty chaos. Sorry.   Came to the Cracked Egg a very short distance down the road and VERY happy with the service and ambiance.",

    "text": "Holy supermarket lighting Batman!  Yowza it's bright in here!  I know, I know, silly that this is my first thought on this delectable dining establishment, but my guest and I turned to each other at the same time upon entering to comment simultaneously on how bright this joint is.   Make no mistake about it, you will not have trouble reading the menu in here.  Moving right along, our famished selves were seated in a prompt fashion and our friendly waitress came to greet us moments after our post butt-in-seats maneuvers.    Our beverage order was taken and filled with a quickness, heaven forbid we wait long for our pot-o-coffee.  My mouth and I were quite pleased with the fresh squeezed OJ, and though the coffee was nothing special at all, just the fact that it was caffeine made me happy at that moment.  A mushroom and Swiss omelet and veggie eggs Benedict order later, we enjoyed discussing the decor while our breakfast orders were prepared.  Farmland murals as far as the eyes could see; hey, it's hard to miss anything in that joint with the light as bright as they are.   I also quite enjoyed their happy or sad faced egg option on the table. What the #$% am I talking about you say? Well, instead of doing that whole pesky walking by to ask if everything is OK you can flip your egg to a happy or sad face based on whether or not you need anything! My antisocial self enjoys that, in fact, I think clothing stores should implement this idea. The days of being asked a million times by every sales associate in the store, \"are you finding everything OK?\" would be over!  Back to Egg Works: the food.  My omelet was covered in cheese, in fact, I'm pretty certain there was more cheese on my omelet than egg. Have no fear, I merely peeled back the cheese layer and enjoyed my eggy/mushroomy omelet underneath. The breakfast potatoes were tasty, a little heavy on the seasoning but a great balance of crisp and softness.  All in all, is Egg Works the most mind-blowing breakfast experience I've ever had, not really. I enjoyed the Cracked Egg a little better, but should I find myself on the West Side of town and craving a tasty breakfast eatery, I would most certainly dine at Egg Works again.  Good eats, great service, those two things all by themselves are 4-stars alone these days!",

    "text": "So, I have lived in Las Vegas for almost 7 years and had never been to Egg Works. Why? Mainly because I don't eat eggs, or sweet stuff, so that crosses out a lot of breakfast type spots. BUT a friend was coming in town, and he wanted breakfast so after looking at the menu, we decided on this spot and I will be back for sure!   Because we went later morning, mid week, we were able to grab a seat at the counter where Heather waited on us. She is super friendly, made some recommendations off of the massive menu and checked back on us enough to feel tended too, but not too much. As my friend and I had tons to catch up on and some times, there is such a thing as too much service. But Heather was perfect!   Our food came up quickly, I had the carnitas crepe and my friend had an omelette. The carnitas were tender and flavorful. The only thing that was missing was that they weren't crispy which would have been a nice balance of textures since the rest of the crepe was soft. The Habla Diablo potatoes were yummy & I got extra fruit since I didn't want a muffin.   My friend's omelette was perfect, he was really happy with his meal too. Coffee was always hot, we never felt rushed. All in all, I will be back!",

I love their season potatoes & banana nut muffins. But been getting wheat toast instead for a healthier choice.   Also another thing I noticed is that every time I come here I notice that the manager is always checking on every table and is friendly.   As far as the atmosphere. It was pretty comfortable despite it being very busy. It's always very busy in here.   They also serve lunch & really good bloody Mary's.",

Our server saw that we we're tourists and brought free banana but muffins for us to try. We were so excited because the service alone was impressive.

One waitress informed us of a woodfire oven they had installed in the kitchen and gave us some samples to try of the Margherita pizza.  I was kind of skeptical.  But the pizza, I must admit, was pretty darn good.  The crust was thin and crisp and I especially loved the moderate chunks of sweet garlic throughout the slice.  She said they were still experimenting, so I wonder if they changed it.  I sure hope not though!  So come here to get your usual breakfast fav or to try out their new pizzas.",

Ordered 1 water and 2 coffee's, we got 2 waters and 1 coffee, Heather decided she needed to give us an explanation, stating she is trying to take care of 3 tables. Looking at the tables, 2 people each, a whopping 6 adults. I asked her for creemer and she stated policy is not to leave it on the table. She brought me a plate with all flavors of cream and walked away. When she passed back by, I had to ask her for just plain cream or milk. She brought my waffle breakfast to me a few minutes before my husband received his french toast, again stating it's policy with waffles. I had to wait until she brought his food to him to ask her for butter for my now cool waffle. She came back with about 20 little butter cups, enough that she had both hands cupped around them and proceeded to toss them on the table, again stating it's policy. I very seldom leave a poor tip but if Heather would have owned up to her mistakes or her incompetence it would have much more profitable for her than to blame everything on policy. No problems with the food, but on her name tag it stated Key Manager, we laughed and discussed how maybe she wanted to add us to her \"key\" ring. Will not go back",

Since I went for lunch on a weekday the place was not busy at all and we were seated immediately.  I have to say the hostess was not pleasant at all.    Our waitress however, was fantastic.  All smiles and super helpful.  As others mentioned they have that little eggy thing that you can flip over for help, but I honestly forgot it was there because there was a constant stream of employees in the area always ready to grab whatever you needed.  And smiling, friendly employees, something I haven't seen in this city in years.  We both ordered the stuffed french toast which is really just a french toast sandwich.  It had scrambled eggs and cheese in the middle.  I got mine with the Works potatoes which were fantastic - just the right seasoning.  My friend got hers with fruit instead.  The food was served super quick also.  5 stars all the way for me!",

    "text": "In general, the food is well prepared here. I have a couple issues. #1 - They need to have place-mats on the tables and at the bar. I ordered coffee and needed the spoon to stir in the cream. I didn't have anywhere to set my wet spoon, nor the fork and knife except on the bare surface of the bar. I don't like doing this because of germs and what not. The bar was wiped down with a rag, but how clean is that rag? I don't set my silverware on a surface like that. So now I have to do a little balancing act by propping the fork and spoon on the edge of my knife. I could have set it on the napkin, but I don't feel okay with that either considering that I will be wiping my lips with it. A place-mat solves the issue. They could charge local businesses money for advertising space on the place-mat. It wouldn't cost them anything. #2 - The breakfast potatoes are not cooked to order. In fact, them come frozen. They aren't dicing any potatoes in that kitchen. They come straight out of a plastic bag and right into a fryer. They might even be pre-seasoned. These potatoes are kind of like little fried children's snacks. A traditional, diced, breakfast potato with onion and peppers would be much better. These little frozen potato nuggets are not good. I don't know why people seem to like them.",

I REALLY couldn't drink the coffee, it's free refills on coffee so I thought I would at least enjoy a cup o' java that morning. It was so horrible we had to as for the manager, Rochelle, she took care of it. She came back with a fresh pot of coffee, we tried it the second time with International Delight Flavored Coffee Creamer.  I hope they decide to get a different blend of coffee. I won't ever get it again.",

To start, we got complimentary zucchini muffins with chocolate, if I'm remembering the zucchini part correctly. Then, I had the veggie eggs Benedict. It came completely drenched in hollandaise. So much so I could not stand to eat it and sent it back. They happily brought me another with hollandaise on the side this time. It was ok. Not bad but not great still. Tim had eggs and waffle combo.

Can't be upset about that tho, it's a breakfast place, it should be that way. We were seated in a tiny table in the corner waited for 10-15 before they came over and took our order. The waitress we had wasn't very knowledgeable about the menu. I knew that egg and I had booze just didn't know how much, after asking I was only shown half the menu and didn't find out til after my meal they had butterscotch schnapps. I order the huevos rancheros and didn't get any salsa. It usually comes with it so I just used the kind that was on the table.. Also was never asked if I wanted a refill on my milk or if I wanted anything else to drink. My friend order the cheese omelet and was pretty satisfied, just should have all the reviews first. She wanted to get the corn need hash but only likes canned, which they have but the waitress told us they didn't.. Maybe the gal was new but why not ask the chef or something. Just wasn't the best experience.",

There is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating to accommodate the crowds.   The menu is extensive and, even with that, the restaurant is happy to make adjustments to your orders when requested. I had the vegetable omelet and added avocado. It was light, fluffy and delicious. I thought that they forgot the avocado at first since it wasn't on top but there was plenty on the inside!  The seasoned potatoes were quite good as well. I didn't have the muffin that I read all the raves about.

We sat on the patio and were dive-bombed and swarmed with pigeons for the length of our meal. Secondly, we had a party of six however when the food came out only two people were served. After several minutes we asked on the status of the other meals and the waitress advised us that she could only place 4 orders at a time when the kitchen is busy. The two people who had food were half way done by the time the rest of us got our food ...while waiting surrounded by pigeons. Needless to say we will not be back.",

I got the breakfast burrito, which is smothered in an enchilada like sauce, and it was fantastic. It comes served with their famous potatoes, which also hit the spot.  The coffee and the service were also great. The only negative is that the lines can be long so it can be a brutal 40 minute wait in the Vegas sun, but it was worth it.",

The pros - Service was outstanding.  We were quickly seated and our server (young man on Saturday dayshift) was attentive and funny.  The food - On the first visit I tried the Cincy Chili.  It just wasn't good.  On this visit, I went with eggs, biscuits, and gravy.  It wasn't good either.  You can't really screw up eggs, but the gravy and biscuits had all the thrill of cardboard.   To my server's credit, he noticed I wasn't eating much and did offer to replace it with something else, but I didn't have time as I had an appointment.  My dining companions got the egg skillets and also commented that they felt it was just average food.",

My wife had an avocado and mushroom omelette which she enjoyed. Our waitress was Marianne who, because we had a problem with my wife's initial order being too salty, went above and beyond in solving our problems and making recommendations. Dolly the manager even went so far as giving us a free loaf of their muffin bread to compensate for the inconvenience with my wife's first order.     I highly recommend Egg Works as a breakfast spot and if you can get Marianne as your waitress, all the better.",

My daughter really liked her food.  Restaurant was clean and orderly, not overly crowded, generally a nice place. Only improvement I would recommend maple syrup with blueberry pancakes is nasty... invest in a couple of bottles of blueberry syrup.",

    "text": "If you're into ginormous breakfasts, Eggworks is the place to go to. On first glance, the prices for the items on the menu may seem a little high, considering how the main ingredient of most dishes are eggs, but the portion sizes here are big enough for me to stay full until dinner time. That is well worth the money.   The service was flawless. Each table has an egg sign that customers can flip over to be smiling contently or frowning in need of service, making for efficient communication between the customers and the servers.   Another thing I appreciate in this place is how casually welcoming the atmosphere is. As someone who positively despises having to wake up early to get ready, I love how this is one of the places I can walk into wearing sweats and a t-shirt without being judged.  I ordered the Chicken Enchilada Omelet, which comes with potatoes and either a banana nut muffin or a piece of toast. The muffin came out almost immediately after I placed the order. Although it wasn't warm anymore, it was still fluffy and delicious, which is all that counts. The tables are stocked with anything that one could need for breakfast: jam, ketchup, sugar, salt, and pepper packets are all readily available. My omelet did not take longer than ten minutes to arrive and was the most fulfilling breakfast I have had in a while. There was plenty of chicken in the omelet, and the sour cream added a nice touch to it.  Customers pay the bill right at the cash register, where a friendly cashier quickly cashes them out and wishes them a nice day. Definitely an egg-celent place to start the day out with!",

When I explained to her what a crepe should be, she called a woman over, who I am assuming was a manager!  I explained to her, also that I ordered the crepe and said it was a thin pancake, she became very defensive and said, \"well, that is not how we make it; this is how we make it!\"  No offer to rectify the matter.  I took two bites and it tasted worse than it looked....very heavy, and doughy.  Needless to say, I didn't eat it.  As mentioned, there was no offer to correct the matter.  I was paying full price, no coupon or Groupon like most of the other diners.   The was no offer to take off my meal or discount the bill, even though I never ate their version of a crepe.  Due to terrible food and bad at tide, we will never return.  There are too many breakfast venues that serve good,food and have better service.",

Kat was our waitress and she was amazing. She was both friendly and to the point, never failing to make us smile or to fill up our almost empty cups even though she had so many other people she was helping! Never even had to flip to a sad egg, but it was so cute and silly I woulda loved to.   We were brought the banana nut muffins when we where waiting for our food and they we so good! Soft and moist. I had the omlette and it was to much to eat and the extra avacado was pricy but the best omlette I've ever eaten. Very impressed! My whole family loved there food too but no one finished there monster sized plates!  When we were leaving the blond cashier was very nice and I couldn't believe how fast and organised she was! She even had time to say good morning and goodbye to everyone when they came in or left and still ask everyone if they enjoyed there meal and smile!  Over all I would recommend this restaraunt to my friends if they want good food and don't care about all the people!",

I can't complain.  Naomi one of the cashiers is always nice to me with her beautiful smile and all the servers are so nice to me too.  I used to go to starbucks all the time but now I come here.  Unless they come up with an organic breakfast place exactly in the same location for convenience, I'll always come here.  Nobody's forcing me to come here.  It's not for everybody.  It's either you like it or you don't.  If you don't, then don't come here.  If you do, then I'll see you here.  Don't forget to say hi!",

    "text": "Egg Works is notorious for a wait, but if you're a party that's three or less, this location can get you in and out. One of the more ideal places to go on the west side of town if you're looking for a full breakfast that has an over-abundance of sides, because for the price they offer, you get more than what you expect out of the portions (I would even go as far to say maybe even too much!)  Ordered the vegetable crepe without the swiss cheese, and got sides of wheat bread and seasoned potatoes. The vegetable crepe is HUGE and delicious, and they give you more seasoned potatoes than you can need! If you're a bread lover, they'll give you five slices in this meal! As delicious as it was, I could only finish half of the entire plate. Service was fast and friendly, and is even more so when you sit at the bar top when it's just for two (another reason why I enjoyed it... in and out in no time!)  I can understand how the unusual bright lighting could be a problem with enjoying your breakfast in that atmosphere (maybe they don't want hungover people enjoying too much time grubbing out in the mornings?), but the bright lighting didn't bother me whatsoever (and I appreciated it for waking me up some!) If the bright lights bother you, they have an outdoor porch area to enjoy the beautiful morning!  One of the better Egg Works locations in Vegas, I was very satisfied!",

I went to the Egg Works following the Yelp reviews and don't get me wrong, I wasn't disapointed by the place. The food was good and overall experience was satisficing.   Atmosphere 0/5: That's a Killer, I don't know if all the Egg Works looks like this but it's just terrible to have Neon as lighting, even more when you're hangover on a Sunday morning! From outside, the place looks nice and I believe it's a new joint they just opened, but inside, it's a different story unfortunately. Food 4/5: Breakfast is good actually. I like the potatoes, I think it's mixed with Paprika! Awesome experience and the Banana Walnut Muffin as a starter is awesome! I used the Foursquare Check-In Special! My friend had the fried-chicken steak and it looked really good! I had the Breakfast burrito, a killer! Service 5/5: Great service by our waiter always aware of his tables and making sure we were ok. A+  I am still reticent to go or no because of the atmosphere. As I usually say, the atmosphere of the restaurant count as much as the food for me so I hoped they could work on that aspect.

I couldn't finish my meal because I was too full and debating about Kony 2012 with my friends, but if it weren't for Kony, I probably would have tried to finish it. Effing Kony, dude....   Our service was kind of slow, but it seemed like our waitress was just having one of those days where her mind was in a jumble. She was nice, so I don't count it against her. She made sure to bring me OJ to-go in a cup.   Oh! The menu is a newspaper! I wanted to keep it but our waitress asked for it back. It is pretty unique and also fulfills the pun quota you would \"eggs-pect\" from a restaurant called \"Egg Works.\"   The bill came out to be around $16/person before tip. I think it was worth it for a lazy weekend breakfast. Definitely recommend!",

So it should come as no surprise that the server got my order wrong. My guest got his food before me which was already bad enough. Then the server brought my food and it was wrong. I waited till I got the servers attention. The server came and asked if everything was ok. I said no actually it's wrong. She brought me a sandwich of all veggies when I ordered a chicken pesto sandwich and ranch on the side. She then brought me a sandwich 15 minutes later and the bread was burnt and I never did get my ranch. At this point, I gave up and I just asked for a Togo box. I felt bad so I actually ended up giving my food away to a homeless person down the road. I guess I ended up paying full price for my meal to give away. I guess I won't be ever going there again. :-(",

This isn't an extremely big restaurant but I would say it is worth the wait (20 minutes or so?) staff was very nice and service was great!

John our server was quick, attentive, personable and came back several times to check on us. The food was pretty good and the menu was extensive. We have dined at the location by Summerlin library and everything is consistent in what Egg Works offers.

It's awesome!   Today's visit, I ordered the Mexican Omelette with their signature potatoes and muffin.  If you've never tried it, you're missing out.  Everyone I've ever talked to LOVES their muffin. It's so moist and soft with great flavor.  Their omelette was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of fillings and topping.  Another thing I absolutely love about dining here is that when you order coffee, they leave the whole pitcher of coffee so you can refill as much as you like! I love being able to top off my own cup without waiting for a busy server to notice.  Speaking of the server, I have never visited this restaurant and encountered anyone that wasn't super friendly and helpful. They always treat you like such a valued guest, and boy oh boy is that refreshing compared to most places.  Egg Works is a MUST try! You'll be hooked.",

The potatoes had a wonderful spice to them and the banana nut muffin which was moist and fluffy added a special touch.   My husband had the chicken fried steak which he said was one of the most flavorful chicken fried steaks he's ever had. I also love the fact that they carry a variety of flavored creamers for their coffee. Make sure you try out their bloody marys and mimosas as well.   I can't wait to come back!",

It seems like the Groupon for Egg Works is pretty popular since 3 other parties in line also redeemed the same one.   I ordered the Haole Loco Moco and it was DELICIOUS. I couldn't believe how flavorful the gravy was. The burger patty was cooked very well. I chose the muffin rather than the toast and I'm glad I did because it is one of the most moist muffins I've ever had. This was a very satisfying meal!   The service was so helpful and quick for the duration of our meal, but there was a mistake with our bill. When we brought it up to the cashier, she left to fix it right away, which we appreciated. Overall, it was a great meal and although there was a problem, the employees' accommodating and quick service made up for it.",

It can get a little crowded here but they do a good job of not being seated too close to another party. It's a kid friendly place also and their kids menu is has great options.   I had a breakfast style cheeseburger and a chili rellano skillet! Both a fam favorite !",

It was quite busy mid-morning but I was quickly able to get a seat at the counter and service was very attentive.  I took a few minutes to peruse the menu and found that they had some good options.  For people from Hawaii, they have a 'Hawaiian Style' breakfasts which is something I took mental note of.  I opted for the Waffle Combo with a large Belgian waffle, 2 eggs, and bacon.  The waffle was pretty good, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside and the eggs were done nicely over easy as requested.  Overall, Egg Works is a good option for good food, quick pleasant service at a decent price.",

The omelete lacked flavor, don't ask how that is possible but this place did it. My corned beef hash was very salty, it was made in house but they should probably revert back to the canned kind.   They have buckwheat pancakes which can be gluten free, when I asked the waitress about it she had no idea. I didn't want to take a chance so I let it lie.   Food came out quick and it was decent priced. I am sure if you have their hispanic oriented breakfast it may be better. They do have a large menu, lot's of options to choose from.",

    "text": "This Egg Works has been a breakfast go-to for the gf and I for sometime.  We usually go at least once a month.  This latest visit has us thinking they will no longer be part of the rotation.  The gf went with one of her usual favs - the chicken enchilada omelet ( about $9.)  Instead of toast she opted for the banana muffin ( the star of the show - moist, dense, warm, nice flavor .)  The omelet was ....boring ( i think it's simply played out )  And the one issue we always have with the savory breakfasts - the seasoned potatoes - presumably diced potatoes thrown in the fryer then throw on some seasoned salt - no thanks !  A first for me - i bought into the menu BS that the burgers were the best in town- i went with the patty melt - simply put, it sucked.  Small over-cooked burger, the smallest piece of cheese i've ever seen on a burger and no FLAVOR.  note to self, if i ever eat at egg works again - pass on the burgers !  We do like the flavored creamers for the coffee .... that and the banana nut muffin are insufficient for a return visit.  The SW breakfast choice are limited !  pics added",

Make sure you walk inside to check it out before driving to the next spot because I know we almost made that mistake. We walked in and were seated right away *bonus points when you're hungry* lol the food was good and the mimosa was AWESOME! He best part of our entire experience though was our server heather! I really enjoyed her personality, guidance with the menu and attentiveness! We will be back to visit her!",

They get an A+ in all respects - atmosphere, price, service, and of course, food.  The restaurant is easy to access and find. It is near Rainbow and 215 across from Arroyo Crossing Shopping Center. The restaurant is a good size and we've never had to wait too long even on a Sunday morning. A huge plus in my book is they are very kid friendly! They provided a car seat sling at our table, and we didn't even have to request it.  Service has been consistent every time. We've had different servers and all of them have been friendly and efficient. When I order coffee, they leave a coffee pot at the table so I don't have to wait for refills. Their coffee is always fresh and tastes so good. I like they provide different flavors of creamer too.  I'm not a banana fan but I love, love, love their Banana Nut Muffin! It is so moist and the banana taste is not overpowering. I have tried several items on their menu and have been happy with my order most of the time. The last time I ordered the Prime Rib Benedict and the hollandaise had way too much lemon. My husband ordered the Country Fried Steak Skillet and that was to die for! Their potatoes are seasoned very well. Their serving portions are generous.  Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day, and the fact that Egg Works gets five stars in my book, is not to be taken lightly.",

I am much happier at this location because the wait is not as long as other locations and no more than 30 minutes from what I have experienced so far.  2 stars = wait staff.  They are always accomodating even for large groups.  They are always super friendly, courteous, and quick to answer to your egg of problems once you change your egg sign from happy to sad on your table.  It amazes me how they see it so quickly.  3 stars = food.  They have a wide selection of breakfast and brunch items.  A couple of my favorites are the California Crepe, the Chicken Fried Steak, and the entire Aloha menu; especially the sausage.  Yum!  I always have a good experience for breakfast here and always leave fulfilled.  4 stars = for their hazelnut coffee and banana nut muffin; when paired together with butter of course, it's breakfast in heaven.  Sometimes I get full from just this muffin.  An entree to share w/ a friend would suffice if you have this to start.  5 stars = because they have a new schedule and are open past 3pm to serve brunch all day to 8pm! Yaye!",

    "text": "CRACK POTATOES!  So I was beyond excited to find that an Egg Works was going up near my house. I have frequented the other locations around town and have been a fan of the crack potatoes for quite some time. This location is perfect. It's got a couple of fireplaces and is much more cozy (in my opinion) than the other locations. Side note: this place was supposed to be the location of the Italian restaurant chain Carinos but apparently it failed to open. Thus, the building is brick on the outside and looks much different than the other locations.   That being said, the food is delicious and consistent with other locations. I always order the Sausage patty, egg, crack potatoes and toast or banana muffin (depends on how I feel that day). The hubby always orders a skillet which is always way too much food. The service here is stupendous and everyone is very accommodating. The coffee is top-notch!",

Two eggs over medium, potatoes with ham and a muffin. I later added coffee and tried the coffee and nearly choked. It had an after taste that stuck in the back of my throat. I had added the non dairy creamer into the coffee and perhaps something was wrong with it. I sent the coffee back. (Out of character for me) I am not a coffee snob. I have always been able to choke down any coffee to satisfy my addiction. I drank down my water to clear my throat, but it never cleared. I ate my runny not medium eggs and ham, but left the potatoes because they were seasoned heavily. I never received the muffin until I caught the waitress and she apologized. She brought two in a box as a take out since my meal was finished. Go Figure! She was pleasant, but did not check on us after someone else delivered the food. I could not wait to pay my bill and leave. I raced home only to get sick as soon as I arrived. I wish I knew what triggered my sickness. Perhaps the coffee creamer? I hope it was only me today. Not a good experience!  I just added a star because the muffins were good.",

Today our group waited about 15 minutes to be seated, it was a busy Sunday morning. Our selections ranged from country fried steak to pork chops, chili omelets and fresh waffles. I chose the strawberry cream cheese filled French toast. It was tasty, but SUPER sweet. If you want to crossover dessert into breakfast, this is for you. Overall though it was berry good (sorry- had to.) Though it was busy, the staff worked together and made sure nothing was missing during our entire meal. The friendly atmosphere and creative breakfast menu make it a great place for anyone to enjoy.  The negative: it was really busy, and there was a rush to get people seated. That resulted in our table not being as clean as we would have preferred (there were used creamers and butter packets left at the table, and it could have used a wipe down. ) Other than that it was a good morning meal for my family.",

We came here for breakfast after doing some shopping in the area and saw we had a free banana muffin coupon available so we decided to give it a shot.   The ambiance is so homey and very much reminded me of some of my favorite spots back in northern cali.   My friend decided on the Santa Fe wrap, while i decided on biscuits and gravy with a side of toast (because it came with eggs and you can't eat eggs without toast!). Our portions were HUGE. I think we were a little shocked when our plates came out. I had one of 2 eggs, 1 of 2 biscuits, 2/4 pieces of toast and 1 of 2 pieces of bacon. Just writing this review is making my mouth water because the biscuits and gravy were so delightful.   My friend didn't get breakfast, but his wrap was amazing! I don't even remember what was inside of it but it was like a caesar salad with additional seasoning. It was perfectly savory, but since it was a cold wrap it almost felt refreshing to be eating.   It was pretty busy when we arrived and we ended up parking in the lot next to this place, but the walk was nothing. There's parking all around and it's busy during obvious peak breakfast hours, but the food was worth it and the service was quick. Definitely glad we came here!",

    "text": "Amazing breakfast!  We started off with a banana nut muffin...best muffin ever.  If you go here, get one.  Do it.  We also ordered the country fried steak skillet.  Just writing this review is making me salivate.  The potatoes that come with it are tasty and really add to the whole.   I ordered the maple bacon french toast and loved it.  Often, when you order something with bacon, they just chop up some bacon and throw it in the batter, but the bacon flavor was infused in this dish.  Every bite was a smokey bacony (totally a word) goodness.    The staff was also great.  We had to wait a little extra long on our second trip there so they gave us a free loaf of their banana nut bread.  Does it get any better?  We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Egg Works is one of those classic American brunch/breakfast spots for the whole family. I ordered my go-to veggie skillet. It wasn't bad tasting, BUT it was pretty much swimming in cheese. So much so that I scraped off the majority of it and threw away the excess in the leftovers. The skillet was otherwise good, but unfortunately is nowhere near the level of veggie skillet that I've been spoiled by at a previous favorite restaurant.   However, that said, our experience was so that I would be back again to try a different dish. They offered a kids coloring menu for our son and we got to sit outside in beautiful weather. The servers were attentive and speedy, and the menu is pretty extensive.",

We literally ordered everything yet they never let me take pics because they dont understand the importance lol.   Customer service was amazing. Food was amazing.   I take it to go ONLY because it's a tight spot to eat in and it's just not my thing .... considering the lengthiness of the order they did not get one thing wrong!    In fact, I have jelly, powder sugar, salt and pepper and syrup for months!   My well done steak was amazing and it was well done, no pink, and tender. AMAZING!",

True it is another breakfast, place but with different style with variety of dishes and very very delicious food. It took me ten minutes just to decide on what to get. Their menu is like newspaper, many different choices. I decided with bacon, ham and scrambled eggs skillet. Yummy just good old breakfast that has everything in it. As for my side I had banana bread. Everything tasted to perfection and definitely I am coming back for some more.",

Our server told us that it had been busy but had just died down, so we must have arrived at the perfect time! I had a champagne and ordered the Cesar's Scramble, which reminded me of my favorite breakfast dish Chilaquiles, except this one had shredded chicken which is my favorite! I tried to make it a bit healthier by choosing cottage cheese and dry wheat toast on the side, rather than the potatoes and tortillas it comes with. They actually have a whole section of healthy substitutes which I appreciate very much. They also give you a free muffin with Yelp check-in, I didn't take advantage this time but saved it for my next visit. The main room is super bright which I don't care for, so I was happy when they seated us in a side room that was more dim. Overall this was a great experience and I will definitely come back.",

So in the end everybody was happy, but it wasn't much different from the breakfast joints near your home. I'll bet it's a franchise. Either way, I would come back when I come back to Vegas.

Egg Works is located directly off of the 215/Rainbow exit. If you take a right (going South to the i15), it will be one block away. The parking is relatively spacious, but shares parking next to the Mcdonalds.  Upon entering the Egg Works, the walk-way and surrounding area was clean.We were immediately seated and was able to pick a table of our liking since it wasn't too busy.  We sat down and reviewed their Menu at Egg Works. WOW!! There is a lot of selections! You could probably go to this restaurant for every day for 2 months and select a new option each time!  The customer service was awesome! We constantly had our drinks refilled and asked if we needed anything.   I had ordered the Bacon, Ham, Sausage Skillet. My friend ordered the Breakfast Pizza. Our order was delivered to our table after placing within 15 minutes! Super quick!  The skillet was very large. I was able to have it for left overs! The skillet had potatoes at the bottom, and on top, scrambled eggs with bacon, ham, sausage, and melted cheeses. It was very good, but filling. The Sour-dough toast was also toasted well, but not burnt.  If you're looking for a quick breakfast/brunch location, you should check Egg Works out!",

The decor inside is very rustic wood cabin vibe and so it actually was a pretty dark inside. My husband decided on the classic, eggs, sausage, hablo diablo potatoes, banana nut muffin, and an extra side of hash brown patties, and a cinnamon roll. I decided on the pork carnitas crepe with hablo diablo potatoes and sourdough toast. We also got an extra banana nut muffin with the Yelp check-in. The cinnamon roll and banana nut muffin came out rather quickly. Both were moist and soft. The banana nut muffin had subtle banana flavor without it being overpowering and honestly not sure that I actually tasted nut at all. The cinnamon roll had a nice balance of icing just the way I like it. Our main entrees came out and the portions were ginormous! I knew we were leaving with a box of food for later! The potatoes were nicely seasoned and not spicy at all (despite the way the name sounds). Eggs were fluffy; sausage was a little on the greasy side but tasty. The crepe had amazing flavor and I actually thought I was eating a pork carnitas burrito, rather than a crepe. It was served with sour cream and a mildly spicy green sauce which was a sensational addition to each bite. To wrap it all up, we left with a plate full of potatoes, half a pork carnitas crepe, two pieces of sourdough toast, a banana nut muffin, and satisfied stomachs...not to mention we were able to get $8 off thanks to the 2for1 app. We would happily be back and/or bring others, even without the extras, although those always make the meal even better",

The experience we had with the people that work there which was excellent and the food which was outstanding really came as a surprise. I would highly suggest that you visit because it will become one of your regulars as it is one of mine",

This is a popular breakfast spot, so if you don't want to wait long, get here early for breakfast (you can tell, right away, by the parking lot situation). Get the Epoxy App and you can earn rewards right away.  We split the country benny (eggs over sausage-topped biscuits with sausage and gravy) and the egg benny pizza- seriously, you gotta try this one!!! (cue: Angels singing)- this was the 1st visit. Oh my gosh. It is a large, generous size on both dishes (\"personal\" size is really sharing size); which comes with the seasoned potatoes. Everything is so yummy. We went back the following weekend, but earlier. We split two different breakfast pizzas: this time, had the quiche pizza (a little salty, but delicious nonetheless). We had leftovers on both of our visits. Our picky eater son loved everything too, BTW.     We had the same, nice and attentive, server and the same booth table, (off to the side) and both visits were excellent. I like the setup of the restaurant, there are several parts to this location. There is the main dining area (which is pretty big and open), which faces the kitchen. Then there are three or four \"rooms\". Not including the outside seating area. The bathroom is really nice (country music is playing). The same flooring is used throughout the restaurant. Everything is clean, overall.   OK, this might be my favorite location, for many reasons...yes, we will definitely be back.",

We also ordered the prime rib benedict which Egg Works definitely does a fantastic job adding a twist to your traditional eggs benedict. You also can't go wrong with their recommended sunrise morning which is a traditional egg scramble with a side of their famous potatoes.   On top of delicious food, their service was exceptional. Our waitress, Nayela, was attentive and super kind. We were the only table seated outside (we had our little puppy) and were concerned that they were going to forget about us but she never did! Always checked in on us and made sure we were above satisfied. Would definitely come again!",

I never stepped foot inside of the restaurant because I was meeting a small group of friends and they were already seated outside when I showed up. This has nothing to do with anything, but I really wish I hadn't worn jeans and worn my hair down without bringing something to tie my hair away from my neck...it was only 9am and I was sweating...but at least our kids could run and play without disturbing anyone because we were the only ones with the \"bright\" idea to sit outdoors. SO ANYWAY, I have no idea what the inside of the restaurant looks like...nope, didn't even use their restroom while I was there.   Although I had a good time being there because I was with my friends and it's always a pleasure to be in good company, I'm not a fan of this place because I wasn't impressed with the food. The prices were pretty standard and the portion size was fair but the presentation was sloppy. I ordered 'The Classic': two eggs cooked how you want them, breakfast potatoes, bacon or sausage, toast or a banana nut muffin, I chose scrambled hard, turkey sausage and the muffin. My eggs were definitely scrambled hard...overcooked for everyone else, but for me it was fine...my potatoes were over salted and a bit dry, I was given turkey bacon instead of the sausage I asked for but I didn't ask to fix the order because I like turkey bacon but it was overcooked and my muffin was kind of strange looking but that didn't bother me. None of my food came out hot...or even kind of warm for that matter. Not much to boast about this place.",

    "text": "I've been here several times and while the food is nothing to write home about, it's a decent source of consistent, generously-portioned breakfast food. The potatoes can be a real salt bomb but that isn't exactly surprising.  I usually get the classic (eggs, potatoes, meat, side of bread/muffin), which I did once again on my most recent visit. I asked to substitute the bread/muffin for a pancake and was told that there would be a \"small upcharge.\" Cool, I figured, imagining an extra $2-3 on my bill since hey, it's a couple pancakes, I'm getting them in lieu of the toast/muffin I'd already be paying for, and the upcharge would be \"small.\"  I was charged the full amount for a short stack pancake meal ($6.10 approximately). The manager would not budge on this, and I never received toast or a muffin to take home. This ticked me off because I'd effectively paid the full price for The Classic, didn't receive 1/4th of the components of the meal, and paid additionally for what was regarded as a full second meal on my bill.   I won't be coming back. The full cost of another meal item is not a \"small upcharge\" and I absolutely should have been warned by my server after she'd spoken to the manager and found out about the immutable billing for as bizarre a request as a substituted pancake. I would have opted for something different or simply asked for the toast or muffin that should have already been included with my meal had I been sufficiently warned.  TLDR; Visit Egg Works if you want mediocre-to-passable quality food, but don't you dare ask for a modification to your meal. What's that customer service thing again?",

    "text": "We came here on a busy Saturday for brunch but the hostess told us there was no wait at the bar so we decided to sit ourselves. I thought being in the dining area was hectic but I thought wrong. Sitting right in front of where the servers get their food from the cooks was so stressful to watch. We sat down to absolute chaos.  There were no utensils and only one menu on the counter where we were sitting. As we shared and read the menu together, many servers kept returning the food because things were wrong on them. We couldn't help but watch them stress over the food they erroneously brought to their customers and now they have to return to the cooks to re-do them or fix them.  After 10 or so minutes of watching this, we were finally greeted by one of them. She get our orders and told us, \"It might take a while, as you can see behind me.\" Yeah, no kidding. Food kept getting returned one after another. It wasn't too encouraging and I hoped our food would be delicious & not messed up.  The wait for the food wasn't too long even with how busy it was. We had to ask for utensils and for a few minutes, the server couldn't find any to give to us. How odd.   That banana muffin was to die for! I ordered Chicken Fried Steak & it was delicious! The seasoned potatoes were so good, not salty. My eggs were cooked well. Unfortunately, my boyfriend got the short end of the stick. He ordered Loco Moco because his Hawaiian bum was craving it but it was a miss. The server asked how he'd like the burger steak and he said medium, which is his usual. The gravy was delicious but cutting into the meat was a disaster. The outside was cooked but the inside was simply uncooked, cold, mushy and pink goo. We've always ordered medium & this was definitely not medium.  We left disappointed & my boyfriend hungry. Eating cold, raw meat is not the biz. Maybe next time.. maybe.",

    "text": "My hubs and I frequent this location rather often.  Breakfast is our favorite meal and we often cook it ourselves at home, but when we are feeling a bit lazy, we hit up some breakfast spots.  We have only gone to one other egg works and this one is definitely busy.  So if you have a big party, expect to wait awhile.  Luckily, turnaround is rather quick.    I usually like to get some type of Benedict, but on this trip I got the Works crepe.  I ordered the full order, as opposed to half order which is 2 eggs, because I needed my protein that morning.  It wasn't what I expected, however, since it was different, I could see myself ordering it again.  A comparison, its served omelette style, you just get your \"eggs\" served differently.    One thing that never fails is the banana nut bread, its yummy and compliments your overflowing protein.  One thing I have noticed is that a lot of their menu items are pretty much the same thing served either separate, on a hot plate, or everything is cooked together.    Their country fried steak is cut, not served as a whole piece, and so is their prime rib too.  That unfortunately is disappointing.  I will have to try something different and out of the ordinary next time.  I'm still on the hunt to find my go to plate here at Egg Works.",

The ambiance is unique; lots of people chattering, yet cozy and comfortable. There are several seating areas: the main/center area, booths along the walls, darker and more private areas, as well as an outdoor area. There are also multiple TVs mounted on the walls. On each table, they also have the Bubba Gump style service where you flip the black/yellow egg and someone will quickly come and help you.  First off, their dishes are really big. Each dish can easily feed two people. If you are a smaller person, I would recommend getting a half order of something. My favorite dish on the menu comes from their small Hawaiian menu: Portuguese sausage, eggs, and rice. They also have perfectly made loco moco as well as the haole loco moco. My second favorite would be the Spinach Benny (eggs benedict, served with spinach plus hash browns, which is also very tasty). They have a variety of dishes: omelets, waffles, toast, scrambled eggs, crepes, parfaits... and that's just from their breakfast menu!  Overall, I give this place 5 stars, based on their menu, their staff, and their location.",

    "text": "I'm not a huge breakfast food foodie, but Egg Works has the best chicken fried steak I have tasted to date.   Yesterday was my second visit to an Egg Works establishment and my first visit to this location on south Rainbow. This restaurant was very busy at 1pm on Sunday - for breakfast. It was nice to be able to sleep in on a Sunday and still go out to breakfast during lunchtime.   When I entered the restaurant, it was packed. The hostess, who looked and acted like she'd seen a full shift already, took our name and told us to wait five minutes. She managed to do/say all that without once looking at me. The thought occurred to me to turn and run, but Yelping has kind of made me stick things out for the sake of the review! Within five minutes, we were seated in the middle section of this open restaurant at the end of the row at a small table for two. Since I knew what I wanted, I didn't need to look through a menu. My son, however, took about five minutes to settle on which omelet he wanted. Our menus closed up to signal someone that we were ready to order. Nope, we waited for another five minutes as we watched servers race by us one by one. We even experienced some servers' toss their tray by their side and drench the floor and our feet with the water that had rested on their trays from beverages. I forewarned one server who was carrying several heavy plates as he passed over this puddle next to our table. This gentleman did clean the floor by my ankles after returning with empty hands. Still no server for us to take our order!   Suddenly, Bridgette approached our table. She asked if someone had taken our beverage order. I told her \"No!\" so she took our beverage order and then told us she would let our server, Lisa, know that our table belonged to her. Upon bringing back out beverage order, there was still no sign, apology, or eye contact from Lisa. I actually watched Lisa maneuver around our table numerous times. So, Bridgette took our food order. I ordered the chicken fried steak and my son ordered the chili rellenos omelet. After this order was taken, I saw Bridgette patiently waiting for Lisa to finish an order as she held a ticket in her hand. I had a funny feeling that she was planning to give our ticket to Lisa. So, I motioned Bridgette over to our table. Upon confirmation of her intention, I told her she took our order and would remain our server or we would leave. End of story!  Bridgette was wonderful and the food was excellent. The restaurant was a zoo, however. I understand busy, but patrons also deserve to enjoy their meals. I found myself protecting my belongings (e.g., purse, iPhone) from possible water damage. Honestly, I felt like I was watching an Indy 500 race and betting on who would fall on the newly forming puddle of water collecting in front of my table again! There was also something rather unprofessional looking about the Egg Work apparel in general - tight jeans even on hostesses and management.  I continued to watch as staff cleared tables clanking dishes into bus tubs that were placed on chairs and hostesses that dropped menus at tables without so much as a \"enjoy your meal\" before turning and walking away.   Somewhere towards the end of our meal, I noticed a sign explaining how to obtain service. Seriously, it was a sign that educated me on the yellow sad face or the black happy face. If I was unhappy and needed service I was to flip and reveal the egg shaped sad face attached as an ornament to my condiment tray. If I was happy or everything was fine, I was to have the black egg shaped happy face on top. Really? Can I take a minute to rant about service? Too bad, I am going to do it anyway! What is wrong with looking at people? Is it really that hard to see that your customer is aimlessly staring at you for assistance? Is it that hard to ask your customers how they are doing? Would it be too much for servers to prepare a table for the upcoming meal (e.g., ketchup, sugar, silverware, napkins)?  Is this why I couldn't get Lisa to notice my table? Good thing Bridgette used her brain and wasn't self reliant on a yellow/black symbol to denote my need for service.   Come-on guys, this has to be done better. You have a good produce for a fair price but poor customer relation skills. I may visit another location and see if this is an Egg Works philosophical way of doing business or a single establishment problem.",

There are two locations for Egg Works. Here goes, the cliffs notes. For breakfast I ordered the Italian skillet with a banana nut muffin, skipped the toast. The skillet was huge! I had my eggs scrambled hard. The were perfect. I can't stand runny eggs. It had potatoes, onions, peppers and sliced Italian sausage with a marinara sauce on the bottom. I would give it a strong 9/10. See the pics.The nut muffin a strong 8.5.  My wife had the corn beef hash. She like it but would like a bark on the hash. She also felt the potatoes were a little large. She loved the muffin. All in all, she gave it a strong 9/10. See Pics.  On our second visit, for lunch, I had the chicken steak sub with onions, peppers an provolone cheese and seasoned fries. The roll was toasted on the grill and buttered. Once again it was a lot of food. My wife had a burger with bacon, mushrooms, onions, cheddar cheese and lettuce. She too, had the seasoned fries. Both would receive a solid 9/10.  The service was great on both visits. They have a system when you require service. You will have no problem finding parking. Just a note, it gets busy very busy on the weekends. We will be back!",

    "text": "Two things I uphold above all in my reviews:  Customer service & food (quality, taste, veg options)  When I first walk in to order food to-go door girl or Naomi from what I spotted greets me with a scowl on her face and asks if I want a table. No, ordering out. can I have a menu please? she says \"Order at the counter\" ... Can-I-have-a-menu-PLEASE? \"Oh, u want a menu.... here. \" she hands me a stack. I put the overflow back. She's still scowling.   Finally, I decide what I want and approach the counter/cooking area. Sunny takes my order with a cheerful smile on her face and was extremely helpful in putting together a combo option for what I was ordering and directing me that when I was ready I could pay and pick up my food at the front where I originally was. I thanked her and went back to pissy pants.   Door girl doesn't even smile, says \"You ready to pay?\"... then as I take a seat in the waiting area, I wasn't sure if Sunny knew where I was sitting but I noticed her maybe 10 minutes later with an order looking around.   I ask door girl if my order is ready and she literally rolls her eyes and says \"She'll bring it over when it's ready lady\"  ..... (these dots represent the angered pause in my head)  Finally, a different waitress approaches me and asks what I ordered and subsequently brought me the order as Sunny was held up with another guest.   As I leave, Sunny had run outside to find me still in my car and politely said \"You forgot your strawberries!\" I thanked her and the 3rd waitress for their polite and prompt customer service.   Sunny should be appreciated or promoted to show her level of excellent customer interaction. it was very pleasant!  Naomi \"door girl\" should be fired. In a customer facing role as the first person that guests see and that first impression that is crucial for return business, she is seriously offering a lack of enthusiasm and disservice.   I am a return guest because I do love the quality of food here, and this location is close to my home and the hours offered for late breakfast! but customer service is about 50/50 currently with her as the \"face\" of Egg Works.",

Every single time I go in, the place is packed but the wait is never more than 20 minutes. For a lady with my appetite, waiting is a tough game.   What is great is that even while packed, they do a fantastic job of turning tables while not making you feel rushed. As always, the food is on point and their specials are always DE-LISH! Always GET THE BANANA MUFFIN! Don't ask. Just do it.  This location is also great because of it's close proximity to the 215 AND all that fab shopping across the street. Egg Works really does have their stuff together. Love this place!",

Two things that brought my rate down from 5: At around noon on Easter, filled to about two thirds capacity, it was really loud. A lot of the sound was from fairly loud music. It made it hard for the server to hear my order correctly, he brought \"fries\" instead of \"fruit\". The noise also hindered our table talk. Yelp said \"average\" noise, but I thought it was louder than that.    Also, I ordered a chicken-salad sandwich that tasted fine but was a challenge to eat as a sandwich. It was a full 4 inches thick when served, and as soon as I picked it up almost all of the chicken salad fell out of the sandwich. I ate it with a fork, and was left with a lettuce and tomato sandwich.  Maybe the chicken chunks (nearly 1\" squares) need to be cut smaller to make it more of a spread.  Nevertheless, it's a good place to eat.",

Location is great located near the 215 kinda far from me but a perfect meeting point for people that live on opposite sides of town.  The place looks great everything is clean that's what i normally look for before i enter an establishment. Place smells great, smells like breakfast, a great aroma.  The place is a little bit loud but, you are still able to hold a conversation with your party without screaming your lungs out.  I normally have the eggs benedict but decided to try something different. the Loco Moco. To be honest i was a bit disappointed. For the price i paid for the Local breakfast plate which included spam and eggs the serving was small. The plate cost me around $9+ and i was seriously disappointed! Well at least i know now not to order that plate, I hope someone from that restaurant reads this and makes changes to their Hawaiian plates.   If someone from hawaii ordered that dish they will be starving after eat it.  Overall the service was great., The staff knew when our table needed attention, because they have those EGG markers , which indicate if we needed something. They were on top of that.  I still give this place a 4 star because aside from their terrible hawaiian local plate dish their other dish the eggs benedict was the bomb! and their racheros potato is really good too.  This is by far one of my favorite breakfast places and i still highly recommend this place if you are craving a good breakfast!   Just remember if you are going to order the hawaiian plates it will be small!",

Shouldn't they have hair nets on, I can't stand finding hair in my food, especially when it's not mine!!! For this reason, we will never, ever, go here again. I'm nauseous as I'm typing this review.

My fav is the pork carnitas rancheros, but the veggie Benny is a close second, but so is the stuffed French toast, it's a egg and bacon delight sandwiched between two thick pieces of French Toast. It really is quite amazing. From hence forth all sandwiches will be used with French toast. It will end wars and develop peace around the world.",

Food is always awesome but lately the service have been ok to ehhh... I wouldn't say terrible but going to the fort apache location eventhough we live closer to this one, now their service is fantastic! From the greet to the server, and even the cashier. Just awesome!  Our server today was Bridgette... She was ok but not very welcoming. She made us feel like we were asking her to do too much from the start. We asked her for some French vanilla creamers for our coffee when she came back to take our order and her response was \"ok do u wana order first\"?? And when I told her that we had been waiting awhile and the coffee was kind of getting cold, she gave me an annoyed look and just walked away without saying anything. She then came back and gave them to me and even with the attitude she had I still said thank you only to get no response from her. That's one example and there were more. The only time she actually lightened up like she actually liked her job was towards the end she came to check up on us and handed us the check. Even with that kind of service we still added 20% gratuity since my father is a firm believer of tipping the right amount but I myself had second thoughts not to. My parents and I share our traditional Monday brunch from egg n I to other egg works location and some other breakfast places also. We were not as happy to say the least but we will still be coming back since the food is great!",

    "text": "My husband ordered New York Steak and Egg and I ordered Prime Rib Bene. I heard about the Prime Rib Bene and wanna try it and that's the only item I wanted that night off the menu.  So the food came...... my husband found a hair on the steak when cutting it. He got grossed out and I got grossed out. I wanna throw up after seeing that hair though the hair wasn't on my plate. So I went out to grab the manager and told her about it. The manager felt bad and took away the steak and asked the kitchen to remake it for him.   Then I am not sure if I was simply grossed out by that hair or my dish was really having problem. There were couple bites that felt very sandy on my mouth. At one point I couldn't tolerate the sandy feeling anymore so I told the manager about it. But I guess she was questioning in her head whether I was making it up after seeing her comping my husband's dish. She didn't look very nice when I was telling her about my concern of the sandy feeling. (I told her it was so grainy and asked if this dish was supposed to be like that, maybe I didn't state the problem clear enough making her wondering) But I really didn't make it up. Just too bad that the feeling was in my mouth, I couldn't really pick out anything that seemed sandy for her to see visually. But she did offer to remake it and at the end comped my dish too. (I hope they didn't spit on my food when they remake mine)  It was a mix feeling. I felt bad for her needing to comp our meals, but I really couldn't tolerate that sandy feeling in my mouth when chewing my food, and my husband definitely couldn't tolerate eating a steak that had someone's hair on it. So we felt bad for the trouble they had to go through but at the same time it's really not our fault. The situation was a bit uncomfortable so we probably just won't go back, because we would just be worried if we would find anything again in the food if we go back there, and worry about if it will end up in an uncomfortable situation again....so might as well not to go back then.",

The first time I came here I sat at the counter and asked my server, Kelli, for some unsweet tea and the sausage gray biscuits (which were fantastic). On my second trip, five weeks later, I again sat at the counter. Kelli walks up and says \"Unsweet tea again?\". When I replied \"Yes\" she asks, \"You want to try something new or go with the sausage gravy and biscuits again?\". That is absolutely crazy that she could remember an order from a single customer five weeks later, especially after only one visit. Since then I've been going with my girlfriend, so we sit at a table. Our waitress has always been Randi and she is absolutely amazing. Do yourself a favor and ask for her by name.       As for the food, outside of the Cincy chilli, everything I've had has been outstanding. Fresh, hot and large portions; what's not to love. To me, the food at Egg Works is pretty much the gold standard by which other breakfast places are measured. In terms of service, Egg Works is the gold standard by which ALL places are measured.",

A restaurant specializing in breakfast serving me something that looks and tastes like a frozen product is a bit of a pet peeve for me. Our toast was burnt, refills took too long, I was left wanting for a straw but our server disappeared. We got more service from the guy busing tables. We had the sad face egg up and finished our meal before anyone paid attention to us.  It'll be a while before I return.",

As a Paleo eater, it can be difficult to eat at restaurants but you can't go wrong with some eggs, sausage, veggies, and they'll always give you a side of avocado if you ask.   I usually get a skillet, which is eggs, meat, veggies, some cheese and fried potatoes. It's delicious. I have a friend who tried their pizza and declared it absolutely horrible. Surprise! It's called Egg Works, not Pizza Works. Don't come here expecting mastery of baked goods unless those goods are dedicated breakfast items. Since most of their dishes revolve around the same ingredients as my skillet combined in new and interesting ways, I feel safe in presuming that since my skillet is good all the other things will be relatively good as well.  My biggest complaint against this place is that when you ask for an egg over-medium, you're going to get over-hard. It boggles my mind that a place that specializes in EGGS can't properly cook an egg. C'est la vie.",

They place was pretty packed ! But we were able to have a seat without a long wait.   The menu was overwhelming, well for me since I don't know what I want half the time. Our server was nice, BUT I hate how I couldn't order the way I wanted. I wanted to substitute my \"house special\" potatoes for regular hash browns & she made it VERY DIFFICULT for me. So I COULDN'T order the way I wanted to and gave up. Honestly, that a big no-no in my book since I am the customer. She kept making excuses for me to not change it and I gave up trying to tell this ignorant server girl. Def didn't even want to leave here a tip !!!! But she was somewhat accommodating, but I waited a VERY long time to get her attention.  The food was brought out and it was pretty yummy. My food was just okay since I got a simple meal and it really wasn't as described on the menu. But ohwells ! The pancakes were good and my meal filled me up ! So that was good.  Everything was fair priced, food was food. Didn't find anything too special particularly and if only my server kept her mouth shut, then I guess they would have redeemed a few more stars. Haven't been back since.",

    "text": "Today was our first trip to Egg Works, and we went to the location on Rainbow.  I can't say how great this place was and how impressed we were with the service.  Our server, Amy, was enthusiastic, on top of things for our party of four and was great at recommending options.  Typically at places like this that serve cafe style breakfast I usually get a basic breakfast burrito, but in this instance Amy recommended the Santa Cruz Burrito.  The burrito had eggs, chicken, chorizo, cheese, green chile and was topped with a homemade \"Santa Cruz sauce\" which Amy described as a \"eggs Benedict style sauce with a Spanish twist\" and that's exactly what it was.  The burrito was sided with a bit of sour cream as well as potatoes and I finished every bite and was not disappointed at all. In fact, this was one of the best burritos I have had for breakfast and that's saying a lot considering I was previously a thirty year Southern California resident.    Their prices are more than fair here, and another great touch is they have these little hanging wooden eggs on the table, one with a smiley face and one with a sad face. If you need service, flip the egg to the sad face and one of the staff will come over, basically eliminating the long waits for a server to bring you something that typically plagues most restaurants.  On a final note, we decided to stop by and see manager Maggie before leaving to let her know what a fantastic and above the norm job Amy did, and she was very pleasant and glad to hear about her workers great job. If you're in town, stop in and ask for Amy!",

    "text": "One of the better Egg Works locations. The restaurant is more roomy and less crowded than others and I enjoy the ambiance quite a bit more. Even better, on a Sunday morning they were airing quite a few football games so my fella didn't feel like he was missing out too much by helping me satiate my breakfast food craving.   There was a bit of a wait, but once seated we were asked by three separate servers in a 2 minute period for our drink orders, so I was already optimistic on the service. My fella and I both went with iced teas which they were refilled regularly. I ordered the sundance omelet and my fella went with the quiche pizza. The quiche pizza was tasty, although I probably wouldn't recommend it simply because I would prefer more egg and less dough in my breakfast. My sundance omelet was really good. Cooked exactly as I requested and had lots of veggies and cheese in it. I also got cottage cheese in place of the potatoes. I've never been a fan of their potato spices, so this was a great decision on my part.   Overall, our meal was excellent and we both left full and happy. Service bordered on over-attentive, but I dare not complain about that as I would prefer that to servers who are completely inattentive. I don't see myself becoming a regular here, but with a coupon for Groupon, I'm always happy to come out for breakfast.",

I then discovered their Huevos Rancheros, its a tortilla on the bottom the skillet, topped with beans, two eggs any style, salsa, delicious melted cheese and a dollop of sour cream. Usually it'll come with homestyle potatoes but i choose to substitute it with seasoned fries, my favorite.   My friend ordered the Stuffed French Toast, which is basically a sandwich made out of two pieces of french toast and stuffed with fluffy scrambled eggs, also a side of the works potatoes.  If you ever need anything from your server, the easiest way to get their attention is to flip over the egg on the table. Its that metal container that holds all the sugars, jellies, and hot sauces, and it has a metal egg you can flip over to the yellow side and it will let your server know you need them.",

When greeted at the door it was more of an afterthought by the three hostess standing there.  I had to repeat twice that it was a table for one bc they were too busy talking to each other. I knew what I wanted when I came in (banana French toast) and found it on the menu and flipped my egg to yellow that I was ready for service.  The first girl came over and asked if she could help. I told her I was ready to order. She said she could take me drink order and disappeared to get me a hot tea. Two more gentlemen came over to ask if they could help me. Again I repeated I was ready to order. They said she was coming. The tea girl meanwhile brings back my tea and flips my egg back to black. I flip it back to yellow bc I STILL need to order. The waitress finally comes over to take my order. No apology that sge was busy or anything. I give her my order and she flips my egg back to black so hard the table shakes. Very disappointed. Will be some time before I am back again",

The portions are very fair for what you pay. And that's why we've eaten there 4 times...... but.... here comes the bad....  Here's what we hate: The location stinks for parking (remember to bring your walking shoes!). The stupid black/yellow egg thing is a cop-out excuse for lazy servers (flip it if you need anything - Here's my first 'why are we tipping you?'). If you like more than one drink, forget about ever getting that refill. It ain't comin. Actually, when you order a diet coke, expect that not to come either (\"oops, I forgot\" - Seriously breakfast ain't that hard, honey). You might as well forget your food too. Your dining partner may get theirs, but you'll have to wait 10 more minutes for yours without any type of acknowledgement; I suspect its normal because of the lack of reaction. The hostess' 2 out of our 4 visits acted as server assistants. The other 2, other servers brought our food. (Why are we tipping you, our server, when everyone else does your work?).  The cash register and hostess stand situation can make even the most non-claustrophobic person want to scream out 'stop touching me!' Crowded is an understatement.  The last time we were in the server ignored us the entire meal, never said a word to us (with the exception of 'what can I get for you?' to take our order), but as she dropped the check tried to start some half-hearted dialogue about 'our plans for the rest of the day' (woman, I don't know you. And after ignoring us, this isn't going to save your tip).  We'd love to talk to a manager..... but one never seems to hold any presence on the floor. (Is there even one?)",

I SPECIFICALLY asked the waitress about the VEGGIE burger. I am a vegetarian. She told me if was really good, lots of customers order it. So, I did too. It comes to me and I take a bite and I start getting worried. The end is PINK, and I've NEVER EVER had a veggie burger PINK before. I am staring at it and I see red and green specks, so I ASSUME it's red and green peppers. I take another SMALL bite. It tastes like meat. I call waitress over and ask, is this the veggie burger?? She says yes. I said, I've never ever had a veggie burger that tasted so much like meat. She once again tells me, yes, it's a veggie burger. I am STARING at it. I can't eat it. Something is wrong and I know it. About 2 seconds later the manager comes over and says \"I'm sorry. We made a mistake. That is a TURKEY burger. The waitress got confused. Lots of people order veggie burgers but they mean turkey burgers\". I almost PUKED. I haven't eaten chicken or poultry in TWELVE years!!! It makes me SICK TO MY STOMACH. I would have rather them give me beef than turkey. The manager comped the whole meal and gave me a 50% off coupon to come back. YEAH FREAKIN RIGHT! They are lucky I dont sue them. I am NOT kidding when I say I suffered mental anguish. The thought of turkey in my mouth made me vomit. I puked several times that night. I went home and was SICK TO MY STOMACH. LITERALLY. It was the attic and the basement (I hope you know what I mean). This was truly traumatizing. I still shudder when I think about it. I will NEVER EVER recommend them. I have been told to sue them, and believe me I'VE CONSIDERED it. I was mouth r*ped by a turkey burger. (Sorry to be so graphic.) But it's True and how I feel. Please stay away from here. NEVER EVER go. It's a BAAAAAD BAAAAAD place.",

The atmosphere is comforting and the decor gives me a welcoming feeling. Now the only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because of the staff. Let me start off by saying I always ask for Veronica. Her service is flawless, whenever my friends and I come here we need her to serve us or it just won't feel right. Nicole was also one of my favorites, it's too bad she moved locations. I will have to visit her sometime! But for the few other servers I got while eating at egg works. Their service was not so flawless, I remember a young man with glasses. We had to wait a while to even be greeted by him. Did not refill our drinks till the very end. Also only checked on us once to drop the check. The other server I had was not very welcoming. She seemed to be rushing us the whole time but, when I saw her taking care of her other tables. She took the time to make sure they were okay but not us so much. Don't know why but that bugged me. Overall Egg Works is a great place to grab some breakfast. I highly recommend it!",

I think the other breakfast-lunch places have lost my business. I haven't found anything else that even comes close.  Portions are filling, but not ridiculously overdone. If you order fruit as a side, you get actual large slices of a mixed variety of fruits. The banana nut muffins are good as homemade. (I won't say \"better than\", because I make great muffins.)  I've ordered the eggs and pancake combination, and the Eggs Benedict today. Both very good, although surprisingly, I liked the platter better.   Service is both efficient and friendly. The wait staff acts like they enjoy their jobs, and their customers. Nice to get smiles and helpfulness!  Highly recommended!",

I can't wait to make this place a regular stop. My only advice would be to ask for light butter on your toast if you don't like it drowning. I do, so I was happy about it, by I could see some people thinking it's too much. Oh and their sweet tea is legit!",

Cons: Everything tastes like it has been sitting under a hotlamp for several hours.  The food is--at best--bland and highly processed and the prevailing \"taste\" is salt.

They always talk to me and recognize me, which is a huge plus in my book. There is one man specifically who seems to be always there when I am and he is one of the best servers I have ever had. I wish I could remember his name, he's told me several times, but I'm the worst with names! The food here is always great and comes out very quickly. I am usually in and out of here within 30 minutes, which is perfect for someone who is always on the go like me! Another great thing is they offer half sizes.

    "text": "What an eggs-ceptional experience!!   See what I did there?? Huh?? See that??  Everybody who knows me know I love breakfast foods and love eggs especially!  A coworker of mine kept telling me that I had to check this place out. \"You can't go wrong here, Mike.\" \" You'll love it, Mike.\" \" This has you name written all over it, Mike.\"  Damn, they were so right!  Egg Works is located right next to a McDonald's on the east side of Rainbow just south of the 215 freeway. As we pull into the parking lot this morning, first thing we take note of is that it is crowded as hell! There were no spaces actually at Egg Works, so we actually had to park behind McDonald's. Good news is that speaks volumes as to their reputation. On the flip side, how long is it going to take to get seated and how long until we actually get to devour some grub! We parked and figured we'd give it a shot.  We literally did not have to wait at all! A couple entered right before us and no sooner did they enter the door, a hostess was escorting them to a table. Just as soon as they took off before us another hostess appeared and walked us to our table. Wow! That was seamless!   Sitting at our table, we noticed the healthy portions of food at the other diners tables. This was starting to look promising! Our waitress appeared and took our drink order. We had our drinks within maybe 3 minutes of walking through the door!   After giving us a few minutes to make a selection, our waitress took our order and was off again. We noticed this place had a ton of people taking to-go orders with them. This place is wildly popular and I can't believe I'm just discovering this now!  When our waitress returned with our food, she actually apologized for the wait! We just looked at each other and laughed since it was literally less than 10 minutes from the time we ordered.   Wasn't exactly what to try first, but I love me a good cheese omelette, so I figured that was a safe bet. The cheese was so much tastier here than at some other breakfast places I frequent. The dish came with 4 slices of buttered toast and seasoned hash brown nuggets. Very tasty! My friend opted for the Denver omelette and raved about his, as well.  On our next visit(which is a foregone conclusion), we agreed to try one of those skillets. Those things looked powerful good!  I'm also digging the little system they have set up with the happy egg/sad egg. If you are pleased with everything and want to be left to enjoy your food, just keep the happy egg up. If you need something or need to speak to somebody, just flip it to the sad egg. We only used this once to get a drink refil, and it only took about 15 seconds for someone to take care of the issue. This was impressive considering how packed the place was at the time!  This place is freaking awesome and we will be back. A lot. And often. And again. And you get the point.  Spoiler Alert: Mike F. will be checking in to this place a lot!  5 stars.",

She said the wait would be 20 minutes. 45 minutes later is when we actually got a table out on the pigeon infested patio. After we ordered, two meals came out first and the other four came put 15 minutes later. The server told us that the kitchen only allows a max of 5 orders for one table at a time.... so I'm guessing this is why we waited 45 minutes and not 20.  I gave it two stars because while this experience at this location was completely unsatisfactory and just uncomfortable with the nasty pigeons landing on my table, my food, although I couldn't sit out there long enough to finish it, was good.",

She had a great personality and she took care of my family and I.   My Husband and I ordered chicken fried steak. My all time favorite! The chicken was lightly battered and crispy! So yummy!  Their banana nut muffin is soooo delicious! Btw, check in on Yelp and receive it for free which is even better! Yay! It's so moist and flavorful. It's definitely a must have when going here!  I also love their diablo potatoes! So good! Well seasoned and crispy outside yet soft inside.",

We were celebrating my mom's 60th birthday and we were extremely satisfied!The service was awesome, restaurant looked great and the food was even better!   Egg Works is my new/only breakfast spot. And, for the record, the steak, as well as the Habla Diablo seasoning used, was the best I've ever had. I'm one of the most pickiest people on the planet; you won't be disappointed  I won't elaborate, but it could've gone left. However, the fantastic management (Cheri) and the support staff (Reina and Raul), made it an awesome experience. Thank You, Egg Works!",

We got seated and were offered the menu. Everything looked just friggen awesome. I really wanted the salmon benedict, but I ended up going with the regular. The only thing I sort of was disappointed about is that they didn't have hashbrown. They had homestyle potatoes and the McDonald's style hashbrown, but not regular ol' hashbrown. Server was very friendly while taking our orders and our drinks came out not much after. When our food came out, it was just mesmerizing. The benedict covered in hollandaise sauce was just a sight to see. It wasn't just the view though, it tasted great as well. Hollandaise sauce was on point. At most restaurants I have been to, the hollandaise sauce is overpowered by vinegar, but this one was arguably the best I had. Although it was a bit out of the way to come here, I'd be more than willing to stop by again.",

As soon as we are seated our server  came over to take our drink order. By the time she comes back we are ready to order!      They have a Black and yellow egg sign on the table if the egg is black you are good if you need something flip the egg over to show the yellow side and they come over to your table...    Being from Hawaii I am partial to the Hawaiian food part of the menu. Like the island favorite or the local moco and don't forget the Hawaiian sweet  bread French toast... I always get the banana muffin as my side. ( or you can get toast) Don't forget to check in on yelp they give you a free banana muffin.   The island favorite comes with sticky rice, eggs and a whole Portuguese's sausage and a slice of pineapple. The loco moco is pretty good not the best that I've had, the gravy could use some work. They always bring out the banana muffin first and they warm it up so grab some butter which is already on the table and go to work!!! Lol I really recommend getting this as your side choice!   They have a front counter area with a tv which is nice, it was on sports center while I was there sometimes it's in the local news channel.    This place is always clean and the servers are really friendly, fast service and good food... The menu is pretty extensive and long so check it out and see what excites your stomach.......

I like that there are so many choices and that you can pretty much get whatever you want depending on your mood.   I will say that the flavor of stuff is usually a little lackluster but I don't expect fine dining here.  Just know you might have to add salt or hot sauce and ketchup to stuff.    I usually looove the banana nut muffin.  Warm with butter is the best.   This time we went the muffin tasted a little metallic and it was not warm.   Maybe because I got the free yelp one?   Not sure.  Also the potatoes were a little off.   Like there was too much flavor but they tasted like nothing.   Hard to explain.   We had ok service.   Very attentive at first but then very hard to get toward the end.   Overall I'm not going to stop coming to egg works but it definitely isn't my first choice.",

They also had chili loco moco, but will have to try that another time. The gravy was thick and satisfying. My egg was a little overcooked (I asked for over medium, it got kind of well done). But the flavor and silky texture of the gravy over the rice.. heaven. It's like biscuits and gravy - but better!  The other dish we got was the chicken fried steak skillet. Unfortunately, it was a salt bomb. The chicken fried steak itself was tasty and fried nicely while still being juicy. However, those diablo potatoes were way too salty. Could have just been an accidental over-salting - but it was almost inedible.   I'm giving 4 stars though because my loco moco was on point, -1 for the extremely salty potatoes. Their banana nut muffin, however deserves 5 stars. It was warm, crispy edges, right amount of banana without being overwhelmed in the nut department. So weighing all of that together - solid 4/5. Would come again to try their works/cincy chili.",

I had Bandito Scramble on one day and Brad's scramble on the other. Both of them were great. Liked the steel cut oatmeal as a side with Raisins. Patient and attentive service both times.  If I had to pick a short coming, it is that they do not accept AMEX. My corporate card is AMEX and it will make my expensing easier if they accepted AMEX.  Highly recommend it!",

I was scared we were going to have to wait like most brunch places around the area, but it's a big restaurant with lots of seats.   I'm usually not a big fan of banana, but decided to try their banana nut muffin because it was free with a yelp check-in and oh my god it is so good!! It's a soft texture, more like banana nut cake in a muffin shape.   They have these egg shaped cards on the side of your table for you to change to let servers know if you need service or not.   They're known for their habla diablo seasoning, which is more like a seasoned salt mixture. There's not much kick to it, but still makes tasty potatoes. It's also available at the cashier to purchase (along with loaves of their banana nut/carrot cake!)",

It took almost an hour to order and receive our food. The wait wasn't bad because it was empty and our table had lots of room, but i don't think the food should've taken that long. I got the New York steak and for $14, I should've gone to south point for $4 steak. The steak was NOT cooked medium rare. It was rare in some parts, well done in some and burnt in many parts. Very unevenly cooked. Also, they burnt our toast and we had to wait even longer than that. Their staff however was friendly, but the food just didn't cut It. Overall very average food with no unique flavors.",

If you're from Long Beach and you've eaten tommy fries, it's that exact seasoning. We got the gumbolyaya with the cheese garlic bread. My husband was in love. It was such a big portion too. He couldn't finish it. Another dish was the blackened prime rib eggs Benedict. It was perfect with the croissant instead of an English muffin. The country fried steak was a little salty but good. The waffles were good! Just wish it was a little more crispier.",

I typically order a veggie omelette (no mushrooms) with bacon and toast, but I have had lunch here too.    The decor is typical for a breakfast joint. I personally like the Egg people etchings in the glass panels inside of the restaurant. They crack me up (no pun intended)!  The location is good and the staff is great. The food comes out fast, tasty and hot. What more can you ask for?   There's one thing this place doesn't have and that's ample parking on Sunday mornings.

He came by everytime making sure we were taken care of. He made sure our kids were taken care of even pouring water for them, even with a water pitcher on the table. The banana muffin was complimentary thanks to yelp and it tasted so good with the table butter. The wait for the table was long, but Raul made it worthwhile. I ordered huevos rancheros and it was just ok in my opinion. My cousins loved there food, not sure what they ordered. Overall everyone was hungry and the food was large portion, so there was a lot of take out boxes. We literally all had leftover brunch for dinner. I would only come back to this place because of Raul! I wish every waiter we come across was just like him. Also, its doggie friendly also for outdoor patio. I would not suggest sitting on the patio in the summertime. Like its vegas! It gets 100 degrees!",

I enjoyed my meal, but I could not eat hear to often without gaining a crazy amount of weight. Everything is tasty, but not great for you.  I ordered the Mexican Crepe. I can assure you this is not what the French have in mind for crepes. That being said it was good and very filling. The crepe is filled with homemade chorizo, onions, green chilies and cheddar jack cheese. It is served with their Habla Diablo potatoes and toast. The flavors combined for a very good overall product. The potatoes were pretty good too.  This is a great place for breakfast food. Which as we all know is great for any meal.",

    "text": "Dropped in for breakfast before leaving Las Vegas to head home for LA. Plenty of parking, clean yet well loved interior, friendly and attentive staff, impressive menu, and loved the free banana nut muffin we got with yelp check - in! Freshly warm, super moist and fluffy. We woke up a bit late so had to wait 20 minutes to be seated on a Sunday, 1130am, for group of 4. Crazy busy so food took a while to come out, but we were fed well with hearty portions. One of our orders' eggs were wrong, but servers were efficient and quick to fix all our needs.  One of my reason for 4 stars: water tasted like tap, just a bit of personal pet peeve. Yuck. Encourages ordering drinks from menu, yes, but I don't like anything else, so I guess I'm just picky. Easy fix: perhaps get one of their juices by carafe, or get their bottled water (noticed this on menu after we left)   1. Omelet stuffed French toast with their signature potatoes: for those who want both sweet and savory, dry crunch and moist fluff. French toast was dipped in maple syrup with one bite, hot sauce with next bite. Well done, egg works!!  2. Chicken mushroom spinach skillet, eggs over easy, with banana nut muffin: no complaints when melted cheese stretches 8 inches long! Nom nom all around, banana nut muffin was preciously kept intact to take home (since we gobbled up the freebie muffin)   3. Works veggie Benny, ordered spinach sauteed, side of fresh fruits : average but solid hollandaise sauce. Beautifully complimentary flavors of grilled tomatoes, cooked spinach, avocado, poached eggs, and creamy sauce. Full and rich, this is a hidden gem that may be  overlooked because it's a veggie dish. Fruits were edible and sweet, unlike most places where they seem to just be hard plastic  decorations. Nice variety of watermelon, orange, pineapple, two melons and grapefruit. You won my heart!   4. Corn beef hash on skillet, eggs scrambled with toast and their signature potatoes: good flavors, we expected a portion of the hash grilled so a bit disappointed it was all moist. Enjoyed with their variety of hot sauces.",

I sat there for over 10-15 minutes trying to figure it what to get.... Lol  The menu covers everything from pancakes to crepes to French toast to omelets to sandwiches to wraps to pizzas to etc.... Yeah in other words lots and lots of choices!   Ambiance is a no frills kinda place. Totally laid back with condiments already at the table so that you don't really need to ask for anything once u make up your mind. Use the egg on the table. Black with a smiley face if u are happy to yellow with a frowny face if u need something. (4/5) just a warning in the morning there are alot of families there so if screaming crying kids bother you... U might want to come a tad bit later in the day. :D  I've been here I don't know how many times.... But the service that I have received has been very very good. Is it perfect? No.... But for the style of restaurant that this is... Pretty good. (4/5)  I've had omelets.... I have had salads.... I have had sandwiches.... I've had the pizzas.... And etc.... They have all been consistently good! Nothing stands out as a signature dish for me nor does anything stand out as down right disgusting. Overall I have been very pleased with everything that I've ordered. (4/5)  Will I be back... Of course.... Will I recommend... Of course. :)  Tip #1 - if u are a Tabasco fan like me.... Ask... They have it but only if u ask. :)  Tip #2 - if u are in a hurry and don't wanna wait.... U can sit at the counter without a wait.... Well that is as long as there is room at the counter. :)",

But it wasn't. We got seated right away.  They have sandwiches, pancakes, waffles, omelets, etc. We got 2 different kinds of omelet and a loco moco.  Crazy Chicken Omelet: Julienned chicken, mushrooms, guacamole and cheese. I had mine with egg whites only since I hate egg yolks. Comes with fruit/potatoes, toast/banana nut muffin. I got the yummy banana nut muffin. With a few drops of hot sauce, I was all set. 3.5/5  Loco Moco: This was so messy. Gravy everywhere! Thick beef patty, sunny side egg, gravy and rice.

    "text": "Our Waitress was great, she deserves 5 stars, but the food and the manager was just ok.   I ordered the breakfast pizza. it was soggy dough and runny eggs. I have had breakfast pizzas at other places and there is a way to prepare it where it wont be runny eggs on top of almost uncooked soggy dough. I ended up just helping my sister finish her strawberry waffles and leaving the pizza with a few bites out of it.   I wasn't planning on complaining about it, but when the waitress returned she asked why i wasn't eating my food and i told her why, she said \"oh there has got to be something we can do\". She went to the manager and this is where it got quite interesting. He came over to me with an attitude as if I was bothering him with a complaint. First off, I didn't even need him to come over, I was fine paying for the crappy food and just leaving. The waitress was just being nice enough to try to make sure her table was happy. Second, he then proceeded to explain that the food was prepared perfectly and that is how its supposed to be since it is eggs, I said \"runny?\" he said yes since there is a lot of moisture in eggs. Which we all know is quite unTrue because a quiche is made of eggs and it is firm if cooked right. He said that there was nothing he could do and that I would have to pay for it since I ordered it and took a few bites from it.  The most hilarious part of it all, he asked if he could bring a box so i could take it home... WHAT THE? I didn't eat it here why would I eat it at home. No I don't want a box so i can take it home thank you. The waitress seemed shocked and embarrassed by his response, but at that point there was nothing she could do.  I really appreciate her service and her attentiveness. I probably wont ever go to Egg Works again just because that manager was so completely unaware of how eggs are supposed to be prepared. The place is called Egg Works dude! The waffles were good. =)",

It was excellent and my wife loved her waffle. The whole party was impressed all around. Score 1 for Yelp!",

She was verry attentive and all smiles even though it was obvious she was swamped. If you've never been, it's a must.",

I don't know if she likes what she does but it sure felt like she loves her job. The service was by far some of the best I've had. Both of us are servers so we are pretty observant about the hustle and bustle of a restaurant. She's a Rockstar.",

Not only is the food always flawless, and we order a variety of different items from the menu, but the management down to the bussing staff always bend over backwards to make sure our food is prepared the way we like it and that we are well taken care of.  We have enjoyed everything from eggs, to pancakes (the pumpkin are a particular favorite) to salads to their delicious pizzas.  We are so happy that the restaurant is now serving in the evening hours and will continue to frequent this establishment.",

    "text": "Tried this place after reading the Yelp reviews of others and wasn't disappointed. They have a small outdoor seating area that I figured I'd take advantage of because in from Seattle and eating outdoors is very rare because of the rain. The waitress was very friendly and attentive. The food arrived quickly and the milk I ordered came nice and very cold. I tried the Chicken Fried Steak Skillet based on one of the pictures I saw on Yelp. The food arrived very quickly and was well presented. Eggs were cooked perfectly for my taste. The meal was very good and was fair for the pricing. The only small complaint I might add was the country potatoes in the skillet were seasoned with some type of seasoning that really overpowered the taste of the meal. For my taste, I would have preferred them without the seasoning and that way you could taste the gravy and chicken fried steak better. However, be that as it may, it was still very good, just not to my taste buds. I will try something different next time. They have a pretty diverse menu selection and there are many other breakfasts and lunch combinations that sound really good from reading the menu. I'd definitely go back and eat here again. Oh!!! Make sure you get one of their Banana Nut Muffins!!!! They are amazing as other Yelpers have mentioned. I'm going to order a second they are so good.",

Takes me back to a place when momma use to make banana bread. Oh right, the restaurant....could this be True? We were sited within 3 minutes of walking in on an early Saturday morning! What!!! When you walk in, you are taken back to maybe when you were a kid and your parents sent you to summer camps. It almost has a dining hall atmosphere with the exception of an arcade and tvs!   Vettles - the potatoes are similar to the ones you find at Cracked Egg. Actually it's almost exactly like the Cracked Egg. Glad I live close to both of them! Their Greek Scramble was incredible, I don't mind that my tongue goes numb eating the spinach but the artichoke, chicken, feta make it that much better.  As a breakfast fan, I highly recommend this place. We had to test the service by flipping the egg to the yellow side and the staff attended to us pretty quickly.",

I've been here and waited an obscene amount of time, and I've been here and seated right away. The menu isn't impressive. I swear it takes me longer to decide on what to eat than it does for them to prepare it. I've tried the Eggs Benedict and don't think anything of them. I am not a fan of breakfast potatoes, I prefer hash browns. That's a big negative on this place. I was craving banana walnut pancakes one time and I asked if they could make them, so I receive my pancakes with bananas and walnuts on top off the pancakes. What the heck? Shouldn't they be mixed in with the pancake batter? I know I had a perplexed look on my face and the waitress wasn't interested in asking me what the problem was.  I feel the food here is comparable to IHOP or Denny's, no quality. I also dislike that you have to go up to the counter to pay. Why can't I leave my check and the tip on the table and leave when I'm done! I can only hope I can talk Amy C. into Cracked Egg instead.",

For me, it's the best waffle in comparison to other breakfast places. I also like their skillets here best. You can never go wrong with any skillet you choose.

I ordered the eggs Benedict with turkey bacon and breakfast potatoes with country gravy on the side, along with a cup of coffee..  I was give a fresh hot pot of coffee which was a plus for me being a coffee lover.. My eggs Benedict I would have it say was alright on a scale 1-10 I would say a 5. My potatoes where cooked the way I asked but however It seemed as if they where extremely salty to much for my liking..  After its all said and done I can say I've came I've ate and I don't think I would be in a hurry to return for a second round.. Nothing bad, it's not a first choice either..",

I tried to get the cashiers attention and let her know how it was a great meal, but she did not acknowledge, she was a heavyset brunette with glasses.  I then asked if they had the local fire firefighter discount as my father was a fire chief, she smirked and said only while on duty, quite sarcastically.  We paid and made the best of her rude gestures while leaving, but besides the food this experience had left a horrible taste in my mouth.",

I got the country fried chicken skillet and it was so delicious.  I was disappointed that I had to ask for cream and when I \"flipped the egg\" it did take several minutes for anyone to come by. With that said, the place was packed and our waitress, Jennifer, had really a lot of big tables.  Overall, it a yummy stop. I think it was a little overpriced, but the food was good and the service was not horrible.  If you're looking for a good place for kids, or a nice place to meet the family for brunch or something, this might be just the ticket.",

Once she found out it was out first visit she promptly brought us a complimentary banana nut muffin.  I have never met anyone from Nebraska who says \"groovy\".   She took great care of us and the overall service was as Victoria would say \"GROOVY\"!      I had the crazy chicken omelet which was cooked to perfection.  Being a large omelet I thought that was quite impressive.  Lots of chicken and other goodies inside made it a welcome morning treat.  It came with potatoes which were also very good but I decided to focus my attention on the omelet and conquer it.  I took home corned beef breakfast and potato omelet for my girls which were thoroughly enjoyed when they woke up.  The banana nut muffins were awesome.  Great place for breakfast whether you live here in Vegas or are visiting and making the trek back home.",

We were waited on quickly. We were both in the mood for a Mexican type breakfast so Doug got the Bandito Scramble and I got the Breakfast Tostada with Chicken. We got our free Banana Nut Muffin which was moist and delicious. We didn't have to wait long for food. Doug loved his, devoured it, I didn't taste it but it looked good. Mine was huge, and was more like a breakfast bowl. They used a Crispy tortilla salad bowl, stuck it to the plate with refried beans and stuffed it full of potatoes, eggs, and chicken. The chicken was rather bland so I wish I would've gotten the carnitas instead, otherwise it was good, but I wouldn't get it again.  The menu is huge, so many options, it's hard to decide. I want to go back and try more, plus they have a pet friendly patio!!",

If you do not have a huge appetite, I recommend splitting the meal if you come with someone else, which will lower the price significantly.  The reason why I did not give egg works a 5 star was because of the price, which unfortunately is consistent with all the other good breakfast establishments. If you don't mind taking a break from usual toast, please please please try out the banana nut muffin.  It is amazing.  Overall I recommend egg works but if you can split it with someone.

The GFs Egg Benedict was bland and just not satisfying. That may of been my fault for not building up the breakfast here and her craving Egg Benedict for over a week.    My Omelet was good but it seemed like it was missing something; I think it needed salsa or refried beans it was a Mexican omelette after all.  It was the first time I remember having to pay at the door on the way out. I definitely didn't like having to get up after eating a big breakfast and stand in line at a crowded entrance to be allowed to leave. What if I didn't have cash to leave a Tip at the table and didn't want to put it on one of my cards? I'd have to go back to tip and fight my way out the restaurant... It was very inconvenient.   Inconvenient is an understatement for the shard parking lot with a busy McDonalds and a fairly busy shopping plaza. Get there before the rush times and parking shouldn't be an issue.",

Considering it was morning and we were barely beginning our day, the mellow and chill mood was very much appreciated. The food was amazing, I made my own omelette whilst my boyfriend order steak and eggs. I highly recommend their muffin as well, really scrumptious. Overall, the wait was to a minimum, their service was consistent, food didn't take too long to arrive at our table, and the prices were fair. Overall a good experience :)",

    "text": "Hello to all Yelpers!  We showed up an hr before close and our waitress forgot to put in our food order. We were pretty upset and on a time crunch but couldn't do anything about it. We flipped the unhappy face on the table and made it known that we were not happy.   Marc, came to us to ask if things were ok.. so we told him our issue. He was very sorry, comped our whole meal, had the waitress come by to give us a genuine apology and also gave us muffins while we waited for our food. The food came after 5-7 min and he always surprised us with a carrot cake that was wrapped all pretty in a blue shear wrap.  My reaction was, \"wow!\" I've never had a person redeem themselves and represented the the quality of this restaurant as much as he did. I was floored by how he handled the situation. He smiled the whole time and was a True professional.   We left a fat tip for the waitress and appreciated the the special treatment. We love Egg works always enjoyed our time at this location. We have been known to stop going to diners because of bad service and such.   Egg Works kept my business and I wanted to share my great experience with others just to show that even in this busy diner, you can still get 5 star service and smiles from all the staff..   Thank you Marc for your amazing super service! Because you made a difference. People like you bring success to any service driven industry. If we owned that type of business, we'd have to steal you away from Egg Works.. You are a True asset to the company and i hope they know how lucky they are to have you!  Greatly appreciated customers,   Sami and Scott",

I ordered the Biscuits and Gravy with eggs and bacon. It was freakin' amazing. It's possible that I could have been hungover and anything hearty tasted good. That said, I'd still come back to try out their other options.  Anyhow, there's no wait on a Monday, and the waitresses were very attentive and kind. Food arrived promptly and we were on away shortly after we scarfed down our breakfast.",

The gravy is so flavorful and it goes perfect with the fluffy biscuits! I practically closed my eyes while biting into this. It was a very generous portion, I couldn't even finish it. I ordered it with the potatoes but the seasoning didn't really go well with the biscuits and gravy so I gave the rest to my boyfriend but the eggs and link sausages were perfect.  I also love that they gave a pot of coffee so that I could refill myself.  Customer service was great, our waitress kept checking up on us and making sure we were doing okay. Can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "I am so happy that this location is on the south side of town!! I can come in for a banana nut muffin whenever my heart desires now:)  This location strives in all aspects of a breakfast spot in my opinion... -Friendly staff -Quick service -Delicious food  I understand that I am pretty understanding when it comes to service since I am in the industry...  BUT... That doesn't change the fact that Egg Works is great. They impressed me in my grumpiest state...which is in the mornings ...when I have to wake up and start my day ...*sighs*   I've ordered pretty much something from every part of their menu over the years but my favorite has to be their eggs benedict...SO DELICIOUS...they serve their seasoned racheros potatoes with most of their dishes which is another highlight of the place.  All of their omelets are amazing but beware...their portions are HUGE. Which is probably the only reason I don't order an omelet every time I come. They will also do all egg white omelets upon request for a few dollars extra.   A MUST HAVE... Do not skip out on their banana nut muffins...I don't care if you're on a diet or you just don't like muffins...you HAVE TO get one...They are served warm,fresh, and delicious.  Egg Works is just adorable. The layout of the restaurant is great and the atmosphere is family oriented and kid friendly. One of my favorite parts is their egg sign on every table to notify servers that they need service. One side is an egg with a happy face if you are doing great and the other side is a sad face if you need something.",
