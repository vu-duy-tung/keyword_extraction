The interior seemed very authentic and even the dishes. The food and presentation was absolutely amazingggggg. I got the flautas (taquitos) and you only receive four but let me tell you..it is filling! The only con I have for this restaurant is that the service was extremely mediocre. Both times I went (during the day), it was fairly empty and the servers disappeared in the back or ignored my table. Other than that, I definitely recommend trying the place out! I walked past at night and it looked hype. Do it!",

Our group of six had a leisurely meal. The chips were warm, crisp, and fresh. The guacamole ($8) was delicious. The grilled fish tacos ($12) were excellent! The Chicken Enchilada ($14) was just the right level of spicy. The Beef Fajita ($17) was very good, too. We also had an Ensalada Organica ($10). All the servings were generous. Beans and rice were served separately on two large platters so that our individual plates were not crowded and heaped with food.   Our waiter Frank was efficient and friendly.  He made us feel very welcome. The noise level was low. La Comida was one of the best Mexican Restaurants we have experienced.",

This restaurant is not authentic, and the food just isn't good.   We ordered queso fundido. It's basically melted cheese and extremely hard to mess up. I've eaten this appetizer a million times at a million restaurants. The only way you can ruin this is by buying the cheapest cheese that probably isn't meant to be melted. There was a think layer of grease over the cheese, and it tasted like rubber.  My tacos were okay. My margarita, which I take very seriously, was a joke and completely overpriced. That's the problem with this place. The food is mediocre and way overpriced.",

And the rest of the staff was as well. She made our drinks and let us sample a tequila she really liked. We didn't have dinner so the only food I can review is the free chips/salsa. I like hot flavors. I usually order the hottest wings available when I go out for wings. But there was something about the salsa that didn't agree with me. It tasted good, but my mouth was on fire and my tongue hurt for about 2 days. No idea why lol. But if you're looking to get off the strip / Freemont wander down here, at least for a drink. It's a good time.",

Listen, Vegas..I love you, I live in you, you are  my soulmate, you make me great food, you're cheap, you're hot, and you're pretty.....That being said, STOP trying to change into something you're not!!  I get it.. Downtown is cleaning up, getting trendy..I am all on board with it.. I am even embracing the hipsters , or are they still the regular DT homeless?  I can't tell, they both dress in ripped clothing and don't shower..   I have even grown to love Commonwealth and their over priced drinks made by *cringe* mixologists.. I'm trying, but I usually just hangout at The Griffin or Insert Coins until the terrible DJs show up.   but La Comida, has no excuse to be pretentious and grossly over priced. It is a Mexican Restaurant off Fremont.   It's great to makeover downtown to a cool artsy, hip town..but does that mean I have to pay $10 for a beer and a million dollars for tasteless ceviche?  My friends and I went here for the restaurants first brunch,  they ordered what was a sad attempt at a breakfast burrito, which looked suspiciously like the ones from McDonalds, and I had some dry tasteless French Toast that cost me $15..  Sighhh..    I will stick to one of the other dozen AUTHENTIC Downtown Mexican restaurants.. I will gladly substitute the trendy atmosphere and crappy over priced food for a hole in the wall, cheap delicious experience.      My darling Vegas, being trendy doesn't mean you have to be lazy,expensive, and pretentious. If I wanted that,  I wouldn't have left that bitch L.A. to be with you.",

If I'm going to order a $19 margarita I want gold flecked tequila slowly dribbled into my mouth by a libation slave.  I was pretty convinced that that was not going to happen, since I couldn't even get a glass of water, so I insulted my palate with a Boone's Farmish tasting sangria that had a few slices of orange floating in it like a dead goldfish.  My third thought, WTF!!!   I could have gotten a better meal at a Del Taco drive thru without the maybe I should refinance my house prices!!!    Pollo al Horno - dry and bland  Chicken Burrito - dry with a undefinable overabundance of a spice that made it close to inedible 2 Chicken Enchiladas with Mole - more dry chicken, the mole sauce tasted like a cinnamon paste, dreadful! Communal rice & beans - Meh  We were ironically glad about the kid sized portions, because all our meals ranged from poor to fair at best.  My fourth thought, Really!!!  Haphazard, inconsistent and totally inattentive service, no water, no chips, no follow up.  My final thoughts, get me the heck outta here and never ever again.

Also a big negative with me is an enchilada with a flour tortilla. There's something so very wrong with this, it reminds me of something you'd find in a 5-minute microwavable dinner cookbook.

We went ahead and ordered guacamole and shrimp ceviche. Both were excellent. My second drink was blood orange margarita, another stellar drink. This was brought out with the red snapper tacos we ordered. The tacos were very good, not the best I've had but pretty good. Service was a bit slow considering it was not busy. No napkins or sharing plated provided, I grabbed some from the closest table. I will definitely be back for happy hour!",

The busser did bring us chips and waters first thing though which was nice to have something while waiting for the server.   The manager noticed we had been waiting awhile and apologized.  He sent a server over and the night went from mediocre to fantastic!  The server apologized and was very attentive from there on.  Although he was busy, he made sure to explain the food items and make suggestions.  To our surprise, the manager comped us our first round of drinks and their house made guacamole! Which was awesome!!   I won't make this long and drawn out but besides waiting for a bit in the beginning, our first experience at La Comida was a good one.  The pozole was fanastic (especially with the guacamole in it,) as was the street corn appetizer!   The vibe was fun and energetic.  They put a lot of effort into the aesthetics so it was fun to glance around and see all the details around the restaurant.  We will definitely be going back!",

It definitely felt like this place was old and well-established in the area.  For dinner I went with a chicken burrito.  It was a pretty good size and tasty, with a little taste of sweetness (onion perhaps?).  It wasn't amazing but it kept me satisfied through my evening at Commonwealth.    I was excited to hear that they serve rice and beans as a side for the table as well.  The rice was standard, but the beans didn't taste that good.

It is actually MEAN to serve food this dull and charge this much for it. The carnita tacos were dry, flavorless, and lazy. The mole was a one-note paste over dry chicken enchiladas.

We made the mistake of going in the next day for lunch. Awful service and high prices and the music was a little loud. I was in with a large party that got seated fairly promptly and just as promptly ignored. No contact past the door. The restaurant was barely half full and there were clearly wait staff that weren't really all that busy.   The food I saw around the room was tiny portions, especially for the high prices.

I had one each of the fish tacos, which came with rice and beans; they were both ridiculously good ($13).  My husband had the queso, which he said was just okay.

The food was delicious and surprising, more than just authentic Mexican, it was new, fresh and original.  I loved every bite.  BEST guacamole I have ever had.. We will come back again and again.  Cool casual vibe, super friendly staff, and fun atmosphere.",

I had the burrito con pollo and the burrito with steak the two times we went and it was so delicious plus I loved the ranchero salsa they topped the burrito with. My husband had the torta the first time we went and it was amazing. Maybe a little more Cuban than Mexican because of the jam but still one of the best I have ever had and came with homemade potato chips absolutely to die for. The second time we went he had the nachos linkable and the chips were thick and baked to perfection so they did not get soggy. The cheese and sauce the chicken. Was cooked in was also fabulous. We did not have any of the drinks however what we saw they looked amazing and I definitely will have to.go try a prickly pear margarita before we head back home. The restaurant was very cute hole in the wall like something you would see in Austin. Loved every bite of it!",

The prices are on the high end but the portions and quality are better than most posting below suggest. The real draw, for me, is the vast selection of tequila they offer. It can get expensive if you want to go huge, but a few beers and a shot of something unique is worth it to me - and not going to break the bank. There are definitely kinks in the server set up, but it is to be expected at most new restaurants and should be ironed out soon enough. The service from the staff was excellent. My first visit was a sit down dinner and our waiter was awesome. Second trip was a quick bite at the bar and a few drinks and the bartenders were very friendly, fast, and funny. I will make it a regular stop on the East Freemont bar tour.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place and the new breed of downtown restaurants like EAT and  Le Thai had me feeling sure that I would.  I liked the look of the place and the idea of resurrecting the the old El Cortez laundry space.  Unfortunately after eating at La Comida I feel like this place was born of a corporate calculation to take quick advantage of the good feelings created by the other more thoughtful efforts to bring good food to downtown.  Our experience wasn't all bad.  The staff was friendly, helpful and were doing their best.  The food, however, was very disappointing.  As several previous posters have mentioned the prices were high but the real problem is what you get for your hard earned money.  I don't mind paying the price for good ingredients and skillful preparations but this food was mediocre at best.  The shrimp ceviche was rubbery and dry, the pork shoulder was tough and lacked flavor, and the Mole was too sweet and covered dry bland chicken enchiladas.   There is also something cynical about places that work hard to give off a cool hole in the wall vibe but charge top dollar.  My rear still hurts from sitting in a recovered folding metal chair and I don't find cheap paper napkins charming when wiping my $7 dollar salsa off my fingers.  Yes the salsa trio was $7 and  surprisingly bland.  Although the restaurant was half full they kept seating the two top that was pretty much touching our table in that always uncomfortable attempt to foster the communal experience that I guess they hope will distract from the food.  I may be a sucker but I am still hopeful that the owners of this place can experience it as their customers do and realize changes must be made.  I really do want to like it.",

    "text": "Overpriced. $11-12 tiny street tacos aren't worth it; you can get several better ones from Tacos el Gordo for that price. We got the carne asada; it was way overcooked/tough, and the house salsa was about as inspiring as Pace. The trio of salsas app is $7 and includes a \"hot\" one (which really isn't, but regardless, the flavor isn't that impressive either and doesn't differ much from the house salsa), a tomatillo (which is a bit unnecessarily sweet), and one made with avocado which was really quite nice. We also ordered the pozole, which was unlike (and fell short of pretending to be) any pozole that either of us have had in Mexico or New Mexico. The broth was decently tasty at the end once we'd already added in enough salt from all of the chips we dunked in it in the beginning, trying to improve the flavor. Then you need to take into account the ~$13-15 tiny margaritas and $7 XX beer (even the PBR is $5), which then convinces you that you definitely should have gone elsewhere. Well, unless you really like being jostled by people's asses brushing against your dome every few mins; then definitely go and ask to be seated at the one doesn't-belong table nearest both the door and the bar, where everyone is trying to get by. On the plus side, the waitress was very nice, but took forever to come back each time, which, to be fair, is probably because this place just opened and is still working out the kinks. I'd give them another chance in a month or two, but the prices just aren't worth it. Oh, it's also way too loud to be able to talk easily with your dining companions, if you like that sort of thing, FYI. I'd give it a 2.5 if I could; we'll go with 2. Meh.",

Excellent food overall chips and salsa were fresh. Guac was tasty & paired well with the chips. We had 3 dishes perfect for sharing. Mexican street corn nicely spiced a bit messy but worth it.

It was just such a disappointment! I am very easy to please and rarely complain but goddamn I HATED this place. First of all, the atmosphere looks really cute until you get all the way in, lol! The chairs suck ass. lawn chairs!? REALLY?! The bathroom is not properly marked and I walked in the mens bathroom only to find urinals so obviously I was in the wrong one!  They serve you water in a mason jar and offered no straw until I asked for one. I am not picky about sink water at all but their water tasted like it came straight from the toilet. Their menu is not descriptive at all which makes it really hard to figure out what you are ordering. The prices are just plain ridiculous! I am not cheap when it comes to food but they are really crazy trying to sell their version of mexican food that is not worth the money at all. They told us that the tacos has cabbage and all this other stuff on them but then when we got our food, their was nothing but chicken. Half of us had green sauce on our tacos and the other half did not. We all ordered the same thing with no special request and yet we all received different things. And somebody please tell me who the hell told them that their rice is even worthy of serving to people!!!??? My god, that waS THE WORST rice ever!!! UGGHH I am just so upset that I did not like this place! I had such high hopes and was looking forward to finding a diamond in the rough! NOT! On a positive note, the servers were very nice and the margaritas were yummy! Other than that, HELL NO, NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!",

    "text": "Piecing together the stories that I've heard about La Comida, I imagined that it was the type of establishment where the food is fine, and you don't hold back the tequila shots. Can't say much for the latter, but the food certainly is good.   RESTAURANT  Even during the daytime, it's difficult to miss their skeleton monkey sign that entices your curiosity and draws you into the restaurant. The wooden tables with their long benches and the folding chairs give it a homey vibe. Day of the Dead elements and rosaries that hang on the walls add touches of Mexican culture throughout the dining room.   FOOD  Complimentary bowls of tortilla chips with salsa are presented as a light appetizer. I say order the guacamole, too.  Appetizer - Queso Fundido: Cheesy, gooey goodness served on a hot plate.   Entree - Sea Bass A La Baja: When our server explained how these are the only tacos on the menu that use flour tortillas instead of corn, I had doubts. After my meal, I can't imagine corn being used for these tacos. The tempura battered sea bass was crunchy, and the chipotle mayo added a tolerable spiciness. I would never have thought that pickled radishes to complement the other flavors. This didn't disappoint.  Dessert - Flan: This is one of the best flans that I've had. It's solid and doesn't jiggle much. Smooth, creamy, and not super sweet.  Dessert - Fried Plantains with ice cream: Sweeter than the flan, the fried plantains retained their crunchiness even as the ice cream started to melt and created a pool in the bowl. Decent, but I prefer the flan.   SERVICE  No complaints. Everything ran smoothly.  OTHER  The futbol channel was on during my visit. That's a plus!  OVERALL  I would make the trek back here, especially to try their shrimp tacos and watch more futbol. Lunchtime seems like the ideal hour to make a visit. I wouldn't be surprised if this place becomes packed around dinnertime. Make reservations if possible.",

    "text": "HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!   I came to La Comida on the evening of Thursday the 24th for a round of drinks with my fiance. We were waiting for a table at another restaurant but wanted to enjoy some delicious drinks like we've had on previous occasions, except after this evening I feel like NEVER returning. Correction. NEVER returning when there's a certain manager but most importantly a bartender.   My fiance and I walked in and headed straight to the bar, we let the hostess know we didn't need to be seated. After sitting at the bar our bartender (John) came up and just stood in front of us, he didn't greet us or ask us if we were ready to order or if we needed a menu. After an awkward moment I told him I wanted a drink menu. He returned with the menu and left without saying anything. I had just been at this establishment 2 weeks ago and ordered the same tamarind margarita and this time my fiance ordered the margarita with squirt. When he brought the drinks I noticed that my drink was not rimmed how it usually is (with this sugary chili spicy rim) and the drink tasted just like tamarind. Once again, I state that i've dined at this establishment many times and there has always been a high level of consistency with food and drinks.  Anyway, I was hoping that he would stop by and check on our drinks or even ask us if we wanted to order food (you know to increase their ticket price) but NOPE, during the 45 minutes we were there he kept talking to a party of 3 that was sitting next to us. He ignored us and didn't check in on us at all. Also, he took a break and his manager took over during that time. She, just like him ignored us and spent all her time talking to that party of three, in fact she paid so much attention to them that she was even pouring their bottle water in a glass for them while they ate.   I hope to return one day because this manager and bartender didn't demonstrate the level of customer service i've had before but will not be going if they're there! I'm so glad we have this forum to express our experiences, so BEWARE!!!  BTW, just to let you know how upset I was, I left him a $0.01 tip. That's how bad of service it was.",

The good: Friendliness of service Atmosphere in general Pricing Nachos Poblanos and Flautas de Pollo Chips and salsa Guacamole  The OK: Portion size Location  The bad: Fajitas (no flavor and not sizzling fire-grilled) Service was a little slow Noise level (ok for a small group)  It was mostly an under 50 crowd with quite a few \"hipster millennials\".",

La Comida has an amazing look from the bar to the dining room, which are all in the same area. I met up with my family here after dinner as they had suggested La Comida for a few drinks before heading out into downtown. I bellied up to the bar and took a look at the margarita menu. I'm not a huge tequila fan so I asked the bartender what her favorite drink was on the menu? \"El Corral\", she replied. Well saddle up partner...let's do this.   The \"El Corral\"  margarita comes with Anejo Tequila, sour mix & Grand Marnier. The drink was refreshing at first and not over powering with the tequila, however, with every sip the drink got sweeter and sweeter. I actually didn't even finish the whole drink, I passed the rest to my GF and ordered a whiskey based margarita. Mmmm, this was super tasty and very interesting. A little Jameson, soda water and a splash of sweet & sour mix. Not on the menu, but if you sweet talk Tanya she might make one for ya. I did try my cousin's drink, the Tamarind margarita, and I liked this one a little bit than my original drink. More salty than sweet.  I'll get you next Tamarind...next time. Muahahahah  I did eat chips and salsa while I was here and I looovvveee me some chips and salsa. The offerings at La Comida are above and beyond. I ordered the Roma Tomato and Habanero salsa which definitely had a kick, but nothing too strong for the palate. I loved this and could have possibly eaten the whole bowl by myself.   My time in La Comida was brief, but delightful. The younger local ambience was a nice department from the touristy Strip area and sometimes sterile surroundings of Henderson. To quote the Terminator, \"I'll be back!\"",

Queso fundido is quite good - it's a really rich dish. I think it would be better with more people so can share and be satisfied with only a small taste. We shall return!

Ok so I was heading to Le Thai but they were closed and I remembered around the corner this place so strolled into in. Checked Yelp photos for an ideas and then placed our order consisting of guacamole & chips ( amazing guac BTW ) chicken burrito , Mexican corn & steak fajitas.  So the guac comes and we're excited cause it's extremely tasty but then the entrees show up and the place sank faster than the titanic. The mexi corn was horrible, it was cold and sour. My burrito was not so bad and the green sauce was fantastic but it was a below average burrito. It consisted of rice and chicken but lacked the taste bud punch needed to put a smile on my face. Now the photo of fajitas may look amazing but looks are deceiving. #1 it didn't show up on a sizzling metal plate as 99.9% serve it. Meat tasted like it had been microwaved ( I tried and spit out into napkin cause it was so bad) so it was tough and lacked that fajita taste. The veggies and meat were kinda cold so this give you an idea of why It wasn't a winner. Overall huge disappointment for Frank & guest , bummed out !",

It's a little pricier than the average Mexican food joint - as expected of anything downtown - but it's definitely worth it.   I'd recommend trying the shrimp tacos! They've been the staple of each of my visits here, which has to count for something. The entree comes with 3 tacos that are overflowing with flavor: succulent, lightly-breaded shrimp tucked into a bed of purple cabbage & diced mango, which are tied together with a delicious jalepeno cream sauce & salsa.  My only critique is with the appetizers... The complimentary chips & salsa are perfect, but I've tried both the corn & the queso now and they both fell flat in my opinion. The corn tasted soggy or cooked in a pot of water for too long, while the queso was extremely hard to eat. The cheese it was made of wasn't nearly melty enough to easily scoop up with a chip or bit of tortilla. Kinda disappointing to me, but the other entrees make it easy to overlook.",

I've been to this restaurant as a guest but had the curiosity to look into the menu to check the prices and formulate my opinion for price/quality. Overall I would say that the price and food quality is within the Vegas standards,however the cocktails are clearly pricey for what they are.  The food is overall nice and feels fresh.The presentation is also very acceptable. The decoration is interesting and different which is a bonus for a restaurant in Vegas considering the competition is very high.  The reason why I'm only giving 3 stars it's because although everything is very acceptable nothing is very special and we are in Las Vegas were the offer is massive! The staff was ok but .... only ok.  Be careful with the temperature inside. However Vegas is frequently hot and we like to cool out with some AC, this place was freezing inside. We all had to put our jackets on eat and leave before getting a cold!",

The service on weeknights can certainly leave something to be desired. Our server was...strange. But we she took our orders, brought our food, and checked on us. So main tasks were accomplished. But she did screw up our bill.   The food was great, though. The trio of salsas were well worth it. You get red salsa and chips complimentary. But add the $5 trio of salsas and you get habanero salsa and two green salsas. All were tasty. I opted for the pulled chicken enchiladas with mole sauce. They were yummy. Not anywhere near the best I've ever had, but they got the job done. And bonus, the sangria was tasty too.  All in all, this was a good dining experience and I'd go again (and hopefully have a different server).",

Growing up in Los Angeles where there is good, authentic Mexican food everywhere, I've moved to Las Vegas and discovered that all of the Mexican food I've had here in Las Vegas so far is much like by butt.....very, very white.   La Comida is not really any different. It's rather white-washed and toned down. It's got great flavour, don't get me wrong, but it just seems to lack depth. We ordered their street corn as an appetizer, and let me tell you, it wasn't \"street corn\". It was \"let's slap some stuff on this corn and call it street corn\" street corn.  I will definitely, though, hand it to their bar tender. Their drinks here are PHENOMENAL! But, I don't go to Mexican restaurants for mixed cocktails. I go for Mexican food. Lol.   If you are downtown and want some light \"Mexican inspired\" food, try La Comida. And get a few of their cocktails. They're delicious. But if you're looking for some Mexican food that tastes just like abuela used to make, don't get your hopes up too high.  Would I come back here myself? Absolutely. The food is great, just not Mexican enough. Lol.  Would I recommend this place to others? You bet.",

The food was alright and the typical Anglified Mexican you'll find in any restaurant. Drinks were reasonably priced and the blood orange margarita was terrific. Overall, this is a good place to throw back some drinks and have some light food to sop up the liquor but not anyplace I'd go back to for dinner.   That said, the bartender could afford to lose the attitude. I ordered my first marg on the rocks and she made a point to tell me with a bit of a sneer that ALL the margaritas are served on the rocks. Presumably, blenders are just too bourgeois. Then, when my friend joined us, he ordered a blood-orange marg and a passion fruit one. When the same bartender set them down, he asked which was which. She sneered again and said, \"The orange one is the blood orange one. D'uh.\" My friend apologized for HIS COLOR BLINDNESS. No apology was forthcoming from the bartender, who simply went back to her friends.  Maybe the service would've been better if we had remembered our mustache wax.",

Anyway - he fills the mason jars on the table with water and asks if we need anything.  Looking at the mason jars, we all ask for straws.  They were cloudy, kind of dirty.  Honestly? Of course I want a straw - have you looked at these things?  I ordered the shrimp salad, which came with jicama, mango and mandarin oranges.  It came with three shrimp sitting on top.  Visually it was pretty.  However, overall I feel like there was too much spice for the sake of spice.  And at the price? I should have gotten more than 3 pieces of shrimp.  It was $12!!    Overall, I probably won't be back.  I'm glad I experienced it, but nothing about my experience will make me walk back in the door.",

Our server, Frank, was so fantastic we ended up staying for nearly there hours eating, drinking and goofing off.  The other staff are fun as well but, if you can, ask for Frank!  The atmosphere was busy but not frantic.  The decor was fun and playful, making you feel very comfortable.  The guacamole was outstanding (we ate the entire thing) along with their tortilla soup and salsa verde.  The shrimp enchiladas were enjoyed on my second visit, those too were phenomenal.  Their food has a balance of spice and flavor without being overly salty.  Their tequila selection is killer.  If you enjoy good tequila this is your spot, they have just about everything you want and a few you may not have heard of yet.    You have to be sure to get a picture on the swing next to the bar.  It's a fun photo op and a great way to remember the place.  La Comida makes a great first date spot, especially if you want to see how your date holds their alcohol.  It's also fun with a group of people, their bench seating easily accommodates large parties.  If you like Mexican food, a relaxed environment, and great tequila - I dare you to try this place.  You won't be sorry!",

I have, at this point, tried almost everything on the menu.. but tonight I went for the Enchiladas de Mariscos, which were tender and flavorful shrimps with queso fresco and sour cream rolled in two soft flour tortillas and drenched in a delicious tomatillo sauce. The sauce tasted like what my Grandmother's marinara would if she were from Mexico instead of Italy- I could eat that shit on white rice. It was like heaven, if heaven were a sauce. Long story short, it made the dish. The shrimps were super moist and tender, like they had been poached instead of grilled like most places do. Fiancee had the Chilean sea bass tacos again, and as per previous review, they were exceptional.  The service is always great, and multiple servers checked in on us and were playful.  If you haven't been yet, you must soon!",

    "text": "Love love love this place!  I have had dinner there twice now with the most recent being this past Thursday and both times were fantastic.  On both visits, my man and I sat at the bar with Johnny taking care of us.  Johnny is a great bartender (one of the best in Vegas in my opinion) and is always good for a funny or interesting story.  He makes everyone at his bar feel at home, whether he has known them for years or has just met them.  Who goes to a Mexican restaurant without ordering a margarita?  Definitely not this girl!  My favorite is the prickly pear and my man loves the guava, but we still have several that we haven't tried yet, just one of many reasons we will be back again soon.  Now on to the food, the obligatory chips and salsa are a great start to the meal, the chips not too greasy, the salsa not too chunky or too runny.  Personally, I would prefer a bit more heat, but the flavor is good.  The shrimp ceviche is served in a green chile sauce that has quite the kick to it.  It comes with crispy plantain chips that are beyond addicting.  My man and I loved this dish so much the first time that we had to order it again on our second visit, and it definitely did not disappoint.  Covering both visits, for entrees we had the shrimp tacos, carnitas tacos, skirt steak, and red snapper.  Everything I had was absolutely delicious, although I did not get a chance to try the carnitas tacos.  My boyfriend loved them so much he had already inhaled them before I had a chance to ask for a taste haha!  Lastly, I cannot end this review without talking about the tres leches cake.  This is one of my favorite desserts and La Comida's was absolutely to die for!  It was moist and creamy (but not soggy) with flavors of vanilla bean, cinnamon, maybe nutmeg, just all around delicious.  We will definitely be back for more, and soon!",

The party I was with loved it but I am extremely over-critical of restaurant version Mexican food.  The great thing about this place is the decor, the staff and the excellent service. Tequilas, Mezcal, Whiskey and really cool Muerte-style decor make this place stand out. The Blood Orange Margarita pitchers were $$ but were delicious. Regular Margaritas almost instantly gave me heartburn, too tart. I would definitely check this place out again, overall it was a great experience.",

When we let her know we were there for both she let us know based on business, they were closing early and dinner was not an option.  So an hour and 15 minutes before their posted closing time was too late for them to serve us...got it! We won't try again and we will stick to eating at the other local places in the area that care about our business. Sorry to bother you La Comida! Stay lazy my friend!

I would throw an extra star on here if their servers were more attentive and not standing around chatting at the bar. With food service you shouldn't have to ask for a water refill or ask where your ordered drink is especially when you aren't slammed in a small restaurant.

    "text": "I met some friends here for a birthday party and the staff had no problem putting tables together to accommodate our large party. Drink orders were taken right away and we were checked on often. The chips and salsa (salsas are $2 each) were hit and miss with the chips being very good, but the salsa was just eh. My margaritas came in mason jars and tasted pretty good. Priced at $11 the Prickly Pear Margarita was my favorite of the ones I had.  Queso Fundito ($12) - Oaxaca melted cheese, chorizo, roasted poblano peppers make up this cheesy delicious appetizer. Served with tortillas and big enough to share even if you don't want to, this is a winner and was a big hit with myself and group.   Flautas De Pollo ($9) - Chicken, Oaxaca cheese, queso fresco, sour cream and tomatillo Salsa. Priced well and plated pretty, however these were more like rolled tacos and had a funky flavor. I'd personally pass in the future.   Chicken Fajitas ($17) - You can choose chicken or steak. I had chicken and it comes with guacamole, pico de gallo, sauted corn, bell peppers and onions. The chicken was full of flavor and everything complimented each other nicely.   They have dessert, but I was too full to try any. Maybe next time! They also have seating on the patio and there's a bar. Metered parking nearby.",

    "text": "This place came recommended to us by friends who live in Vegas. It did not disappoint. The entrance is tucked away on the side of a building. But not what you would expect from a Mexican restaurant. Not decorated in what I would consider to be traditional Mexican decor, the restaurant was actually super rustic trendy inside. Weathered white, distressed woods, mismatched frames, but still cohesive and cute.   The food is superb too. They offer a chorizo sausage queso, so amazing. Their carne asada tacos, flavorful, tender meat. The staff was also very generous with chips and salsa.   Gabe, the bartender, was amazing. He was friendly, nice, and made easy conversation with our group. Exactly how a good bartender should be. And their selection was good, we (of course) stuck mostly to tequila....namely Don Julio. And they have a wooden swing at the bar. Think \"swing from a big tree\" type swing. It was fun for a few minutes.   The recommendation definitely paid off. If you are looking for friendly atmosphere and good food for a decent price away from the strip, I would here.",

The Devore is on point and follows very traditional Mexican culture. The service is very attentive and work quickly to deliver an experience to remember. It's a hole in the wall place so there's not to much traffic and noice around here, but if you happen to pass by, please give it a chance. 100% recommend",

He was a disgusting creep and when I inquired if he treated all of his guest this way, his gross smile reappeared and he said \"no just special ones\" so you nasty gringos stay away basically. You don't matter. Thank god for many amazing restaurants in the vicinity that will drive this dirt bag out of business. STAY AWAY",

As I read through these reviews (I wish we had done so before hand!) - I am struck by how many people complain about the bad service.   With so many people complaining about bad service, night after night, I would think the management would have to take a look in the mirror and figure out what's going on. This problem has to start from the top, and trickle down.   My best advice to them - clean house and get rid of your horrible staff.",

Our food was pretty good too.... I asked for vegetarian options and he brought me a separate menu. He recommended the Queso Fresco tacos for me and I'm not a huge cheese person at all but I really enjoyed these tacos, added avocado of course-- our meals came with family style rice + refried beans too, which were prob not vegetarian haha.   We had to take off because of our show but I want to come back and do dessert! I saw they have plantains I think? I'm a sucker for some goooood platanos so I hope so! He was great, we hooked him up, we'll have to come back! They USED TO be on Open Table, wish they still were so I can get me some points!!!!!!!",

    "text": "La Comida's comida is not fantastic and its service is far below that.   Went here with a few friends on a Tuesday night. It wasn't busy but we had trouble being served. It took forever to get someone around to help us. Chips and salsa were empty for a while before we were served new ones. We waited and looked around for our server when we wanted to order. He just hung around in the back. The place wasn't busy either.  The food wasn't anything to write home about. It should be more memorable. I just remember the rice being bland. This is partly due to the blood orange margaritas. Those are delicious without being too sweet. If you want to enjoy yourself, get a pitcher of that.   Overall, it's a very underwhelming experience where the service takes it down a notch. They lack any enthusiasm. They don't even pretend to care that you are there. It's all going through the motions. With plenty of places that offer better Mexican food (and some even downtown like El Sombrero), this place should definitely place more emphasis on their service.",

My friends and I just came here for some margaritas and some snacks and to just really talk and hang out.  I had gotten the blood orange margarita and my friends got the prickly pear margarita.   Totally worth it.  My margarita wasn't as blood orange-y as I would've liked, but it was still fruity and full of tequila. The prickly pear margaritas were great! They were sweet and very refreshing.   Other than that, we just got chips and salsa and queso fundido. Chips were seasoned well and the salsa had just enough heat. The queso fundido was hot and the chorizo gave it a nice heat.   Overall, this was nice place to hang out and grab a few drinks and snacks. I would love to come back here for more margaritas.",

They asked us if we wanted to order some margaritas and I said of course, I asked for a \"strawberry margarita\" and they said they don't make those. Are you freaking kidding me? A 'so called' Mexican restaurant that doesn't serve strawberry margaritas?           I'm a Mexican-American, so I know what Mexican food taste like, this was certainly not it. Perhaps a step up from taco bell, but hardly any flavor. If you don't care for True mexican food then this place is probably for you, but if you know what that real stuff taste like, the you probably want to skip this place. The waiter was just terrible, never came by our table too see how we were doing. Additionally we had to flag him down and ask for water, and he simply never came back. We had to get the host to ask for the bill and it had to take me getting up to ask her again to get it. The food took 20 minutes to get out to us with hardly anyone in the restaurant. It's too bad because the place looks nice, they just need to get the owner to take do something about it, I don't see this place being a long term establishing in Vegas.",

During the Yelp event, we were served delicious small plates of different items, and we were able to taste several different margaritas that were all really good. I couldn't wait to come back again, I was talking this place up non stop to my friend, so finally we made here one night for dinner. Wow, what an entirely different experience.   We stood at the bar while waiting for a table, the female bartender didn't even acknowledge us. We were then seated, at my least favorite area, the pass. So as we watched servers go back and forth with food, not once did anyone acknowledge us again. For a good 10 minutes. Finally we place a cocktail order, I get a Paloma and my friend a margarita. I take one sip of my drink and all I taste is Squirt. Who puts Squirt in a Paloma? I didn't even know they stilll had that soda around. So then we order a couple items. The elote was dry and the queso fundido wasn't as good as the first time I had it. We finished up the chip & salsa because we were starving and couldn't wrangle a server back around to place an entree order. We both left disappointed.   Michael Morton fail.",

    "text": "After having such a stellar time at the YEE awhile back, I had been wanting to go back to La Comida for dinner.  I was early to meeting some friends downtown and decided to pop in (on a Saturday night) for a quick beer and food.  I sat at the bar, and although it wasn't busy, the bartender was running around like a chicken with her head cut off.  She seemed put off when I wanted to see a menu, and once I received it, it took another 15 minutes to order.  I just decided to have a beer and order some guacamole, since I wasn't sure when my friends would arrive and knew it would be quick.  I was never offered chips and salsa, although there were 2 order sitting on the bar near me.  When I asked if I may have some, the bartender said \"oh, sure. These people never touched them, they sat at a table right away.\"  Now, that is kind of gross - how do I know if they touched them?  And she was so \"busy,\" I am not certain she knew either.  The guacamole came out fairly quickly, and I asked for extra chips as well (fresh).  Everything was fine.  The decor is cute and it is a small place.  For as high as their prices are, you'd think they would focus on providing stellar service so diners feel like they are getting their monies worth.  I mean, the margaritas are the smallest things I've ever seen (I honestly thought we received a mini version at the event, but that is the True size!).  At $15 or so, that is crazy!!  The next morning, I believe I had some \"Montezuma's Revenge,\" for lack of better terms.  It had to be something in that guac, because that was the ONLY thing I had eaten all day on Saturday.  I just don't spend a lot of time Downtown, but was looking forward to liking this place.  Unfortunately, I left disappointed and definitely would never go out of my way to return.",

House salsa is bland, slightly sweet and near the consistency of tomato paste. * chips are obviously not house made.   Food is bland and needed salt. Service was slow. Waiter seemed grumpy to refill water glass - the 1 time. A different, younger waiter was snagged for napkins and refills. Disappointing to be utterly forgotten.   TIP: house made hot sauce is good. Have to ask for it.   Beans look house made- with good flavor. Rice is standard. Fajita veggies were sweated, but not grilled or caramelized. Nachos were laded , but too few chips for toppings.

It looks like it's been there far longer with its antique tiles, reclaimed wood and stained glass salvaged from an old church, and let's not forget its day of the dead charm. This quaint cantina serves up elevated Mexican cuisine from all over the map. Think, Mundo with less fuss and more character.   Walking down the narrow entry, I felt like I was whisked off to Play del Carmen or some other Mexican coastal town. Suddenly, Fremont Street was a distant memory. I was taken with the striking bar that serves up more than 100 tequilas and an extensive list of margaritas made with fresh fruit puree. I was unable to resist the prickly pear ($9).   While seated I loved how sunlight filled the space from the patio doors being perched open, and I enjoyed the warm breeze wafting in. It was a pleasant way to enjoy my refreshing prickly pear margarita served on the rocks; the perfect blend of sweet and tart. It was a great choice to wash down the house chips and salsa. The salsa had a smoky flavor with a slight hint of heat.   Next, came the carnitas ($11). Three tacos topped with pickled onions and cilantro, served with a side of rice and beans. The carnitas were flavorful and tender. I had no complaints. Everything was tasty and well executed.  Overall, the restaurant lends itself to meals shared with friends and family. It's a great place to get an evening started or relaxing place to enjoy a leisurely lunch or weekend brunch.",

Ignore the bad reviews,  so they don't like the lighting,  they don't wanna put quarters in the meter,  they don't like the deco,  they hate coming downtown,  they want to order cheese tacos,  people please,  don't be a Steve.  This place is authentic southern Mexican food!!",

    "text": "I came here with my friend on a friday night and the place was busy but we were seated quickley. The decor inside is really cool! But that maybe the only good thing about this place.  The fish and shrimp tacos were good but way over priced. They brought out one plate of beans and rice for my friend and I to share. If Im gonna pay this much for three little tacos I should get my own damn plate of beans and rice, but then again they were extremley bland and tasteless, so on second thought no thanks,  I had the jalisco margarita which was very good, but also really expensive. My friend asked the waiter if she could just get a beer with a glass of lime juice, (like a michelada) but with out the clamato, and he basically said no because there was a \"lime shortage\" hmmm.....I dont know about that but ok.   The place seemed to be filled with tourists, and im sure for them this place was great, a little funky mexican restaurant off of downtown. But this local girl knows a million better less expensive mexican spots to go to.",

    "text": "We arrived at ~8pm with a party of 5 on a Friday evening. Got seated immediately and lucking it was one of the places that was still open to under 21 guests, which FYI is hard to find downtown after 9pm.  What I liked: The mason jar cups, patterned wallpaper, and hipster servers really gave it that downtown feel with a cool modern Hispanic flavor. Our server was pretty great as well, and I really enjoyed the energy and fun all of the server shared with one another.  What I ordered: The Ceviche de Camaron - Worst ceviche I've ever had... It was caked with some kind of cilantro sauce. Also the shrimp was very small, something you'd find in a cheap buffet. But the plantain chips were a nice spin, it was the first time I had them with ceviche.  Mexican Burger - *Beware* if your server recommends the Mexican burger don't get it. Three of us ordered it and none of us finished it... came out very rare. Wish my server asked me how I wanted it cooked. The sweet potato fries were very mushy and got cold quick as well.  They gave us unlimited family style rice and beans for FREE with our entrees which was great, but they taste pretty average. Don't be impressed, but heck at least they were free!  The service: Server was terrific and very knowledgeable of the menu and it's offerings. All of their servers seemed like hipsters and did a great job taking care of one another's tables.  Overall, I was not very impressed by this place and I can see why they have a 3 1/2 star rating on yelp.   Imho, La Comida was an exceptional experience for it's atmosphere but the food quality and taste really disappointed. I would highly recommend this place for the atmosphere and vibe, the food not so much. If you're feeling mediocre Mexican food and want to experience the new downtown feel give it a shot.   Atmosphere 5/5 Service 3/5 Food 2/5",

And where have you last seen a swing at a bar?  I started with the Siempre Caliente margarita ($12), which included passion fruit and hot sauce. It was tasty, and I liked the kick.  My husband got the Camaron Al Maya tacos, which had shrimp, cabbage, mango, jalapeno cream, and hot salsa ($13). It was definitely my favorite thing at the table; the sweet and salty were nicely balanced, and the shrimp was cooked well. I got the sea bass frito a la baja tacos. They just weren't as flavorful or balanced.   This spot definitely seems like a good place for a group and chill gathering.",

    "text": "Dear Frank,  Above & beyond awesome service dude!  He knew the drinks & menu, made recommendations after getting a feel for what we were in the mood for.  They have a creative mouthwatering Margarita list & everything looks good on it so after my fav the 'Verasco de Jalisco,' he asked if I felt like refreshing or smokey.  The Verasco de Jalisco is refreshing to me so the smokey w/ a tangy tamarind sounded unique & tasty.  I wish it was on the menu cause it was delicious.    We read some reviews of La Comida & decided to try the Chicken Mole.  Wow.  Love the mole & shredded chicken.  I need to ask for extra mole next time cause the chocolate was right on point.  Once I had the Taquitos which were not good, but my friend got the Chicken Enchiladas & they were very good.  I was coming back for them or their most popular dish w/ the pork.  Left this time very satisfied & craving the Mole.  The Mexican theme, as soon as you walk in a short corridor on the left, is funky, spooky & Mexican eclectic  such as a wall of rosary's, plastic flowers, graffiti, bar swing, outdoor hanging lights, variety of chairs & china plates w/ that ol' grandma style.  Very cool.  I also love how the front opens to the outside.  The booths are also very comfortable & there's a chalkboard w/ future events coming up such as a Tequila Dinner on the 28th.   Frank was right there w/ our check & did it all so fast cause our meter was almost up!  Next time, we'll stay for at least 2 hours, cause one hour is only enough to eat, enjoy one drink & gulp the other.    I have been here three times now, once they were closed so I was really disappointed & we found a parking right in front that day.  Consistent after the two visits w/ fast service, great atmosphere & excellent margaritas.    Note to self:   Closed on Mondays. No beans or rice cause I never eat them & am too full. Never order taquitos, no where gets 'em right.",

I finally made it in with a friend on Cinco de Mayo.  Surprisingly there was no wait for a table.  We were bar hopping and trying to pace ourselves so only ordered 2 margaritas and some nachos.  Service wasn't great but it was Cinco de Mayo.  Our server may have been spread a little thin.  That is understandable.  The drinks were ok.  We got a guava and prickly pear.  Prickly pear was the better out of the two.  We were not impressed with the nachos.  They were smaller then we expected was ok because we didn't finish them.  The nachos are 6 chips, they are large chips I'll give em that, with steak and chicken but its in some kind of sauce where you really can't tell the difference.  Needless to say but the nachos were a miss for us.  I'd come back again but try something different next time.",

The server suggested the carnitas tacos... so I got that with a side to guacatillo salsa... both were disappointing... no flavor at all... pork was tough and the salsa needs some serious tlc...  couldn't bring myself to eat anymore than one...

The food was delicious and authentic, the restaurant was clean, great playlist, drinks that actually tasted like an alcoholic beverage, and the ambience was warm and inviting.The all day everyday (yes...ALL DAY, EVERYDAY) bottomless mimosas are a MUST! The first time I've come across guava and prickly pear flavored mimosas. They were delicious! Christian and Monse were exceptional servers and were beyond friendly. They provided the service you hope you have when dining at any high end restaurant. When Anthony Bourdain talked about elevated Mexican food, this is what he was talking about! Please give La Comida a visit, you won't regret it.",

The atmosphere is dark so I searched for some and didn't see any.  First couple bites were fine and Bam potato. Told the chef about it and he said it's pretty mixed. I advised him that I was allergic to potato and treated like shit. The executive chef, Mario Garcia , got extremely defensive . He was extremely rude because I'm allergic to potato and the menu says it has potato . I asked my server if I stated no potato. He admitted I did and he requested it without . The chef Mario asked me if I expected him to make me my meal fresh . I advised yes. He said well he won't . I responded with why then even offer . He advised me he was the executive chef. I said well I'm the customer and would prefer it if they would offer me an alternative instead of attitude . Chef walked away and said \" pudrate puto, chinga su puta madre.\" The funny part is even though I look Caucasian I'm actually Brazilian and raised Puerto Rican. So my Spanish is on point . I sure won't come back here ever again. The manager came out and said he was sorry. And left it at that. The server was ultra nice and apologized 8000 times for their behavior . Asked for the chefs contact information they gave me a his card.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, I tried this place out for the first time for my birthday yesterday and I'm sorry I did. Christian was our server around 7pm (4/15/18) and we were about the 4th table to be sat in there.   Christian wasn't the most enthused to be working or even to be talking to us. I've been a server before though and I understand that feeling sometimes. However, when you're working for tips... whatever.   We ordered the elote (corn) for appetizers and those were good, but I'd have to stay away from the \"Ceviche\" (shrimp cocktail). Me and my guests (2 others) took a shrimp each and just made a face to each other and decided we didn't want that.   My guests ordered a torta, chile relleno, and I ordered the \"steak\" tacos. The chile was just alright (hardly any flavor), the \"steak\" tacos were ground beef tacos that were so overcooked that it was more like crunchy oil crisps. (wish I would have taken a photo).  When the food runner dropped off our food it was JUST THAT. More like a \"hi... here... bye.\" Didn't ask if we needed anything before we started our meal, and Christian didn't come back to check on us, refill our waters, or make sure we had everything we needed, so one of my guests didn't get her watered filled once, and had an empty cup for her whole meal.   This whole experience was such a joke, and I just kept trying to keep my mouth shut so not to make anyone uncomfortable. But once I noticed my friends water hadn't been filled the whole time, I had to speak up.   Upon letting Christian know that I wasn't a fan of the Ceviche and that we had it taken away, his response was \"Well, I told you it wasn't like a traditional ceviche.\" I also let him know that the taco meat was overcooked and not steak like I had hoped but what seemed to be left at the bottom of the grease, and his face was as if I was wasting his time and insulting him personally. Christian said he couldn't take the ceviche off but he'd take the tacos off of the bill, because I literally looked at them after receiving them and put them at the edge of the table in hopes to order something else. So when he didn't come back except to end our \"service\" and give us a check, everyone else was done with their meals and I was PISSED OFF because the birthday girl didn't even get to eat dinner.   Upon my friend paying the bill, he came back to offer the change and said oh yeah, and I accidentally took the wrong thing off your bill (meaning to be the tacos) but they're like the same price\" WOW LOL   I WILL NEVER be back here again AND I'll do everything in my power to make sure I tell all of my friends not to even try this joke of a place.   Christian, I don't know if you were having a bad day or if you just didn't care but I hope you find something more suitable for your personality to do for a living.   Food wise- This is NOT authentic anything. PS- you don't use Jasmine rice for Spanish rice. WTF?! Gross Gross Gross.   Food is horrible quality Service is horrible quality Employee attitudes made it all WORSE  Please save yourself the time and definitely your money!!! BEWARE!!! Don't Come Here! What a laughable situation. Such a joke of a place.",

Instead of the typical slaw and tartar combo you see elsewhere, they infused sweet and spicy all while keeping the fish adamantly known amongst the flavors. Love the ambience, the setting, all of it.  Only critique - just a tad more attention to the drinks (or lack thereof).   Thanks for having us, guys.

I'll give them that the chips were good while they were warm and the bucket they come in is cute and just the right size.

    "text": "So I am very picky with Mexican food. Especially if its supposed to be authentic.  This place is located on Fremont Street right next to Common Wealth. The inside is nice and very old school. Kinda like day of the dead. There is also a swing located by the bar. Which I didn't see anybody ride. LOL   We started our dinner with a passion fruit margarita, which was actually really yummy and I just had me a regular modelo beer.I ordered the ceviche which came with plantain chips, I thought it was kind of different. I preferred the ceviche with the tortilla chips that they served when you get there. I also thought it would be a big portion of ceviche but obviously with my picture it wasn't. But enough to get me full. My partner ordered the nachos, served with steak, cheese, guacamole, and jalapenos. They also served the nachos not with tortilla chips. Im not sure what kind of chips they were but they were thick. The nachos were OK. Wasn't a really big fan and the portion was OK as well. I know that when I go to a Mexican restaurant they always serve a big portion of their food. We ended our dinner with the tres leches cake which was really yummy and I guess you could say I would order that cake again.  Im not sure if I would come back to this restaurant, but if I do I think I would have to be really drunk.   Ohh and their servers, they talk to each other too much. I shouldn't have to yell for them to fill both my cups of water and ask for more tortilla chips.Just sayin.",

The last time I went I ordered a mojito which was really watered down and the nachos which sounded amazing but were sorely lacking when they showed up. For the price you pay you'd expect crisp chips and large juicy chunks of white tender chicken breast. Topped with melted cheese and fresh jalapenos. The chips were soggy, and the meat was dark meat and fatty. The jalapenos were soggy and canned. So disappointing. I'll be back for drinks but not for food.",

About 5 employees looked at me but no one acknowledged or even voiced someone would be right with me.  The two bartenders looked at me, then turned around & continued their personal conversation.  There was no sign indicating seat yourself.  I was about to leave when a server finally came over.  The staff seemed indifferent.  I'm a local and I was checking the place out to possible take visitors/co-workers there but the chances are slim that I'll return.",

Chicken was maybe slightly undercooked, and I'm not a fan of biting into a part of a chicken tendon. Corn in the fajitas mix was different and enjoyable. I also commend them for offering up corn tortillas instead of flour (not sure if this is an option). Rice was OK. Beans were OK. Overall, just kind of a bland experience.",

This place would fit right in our city.  decor was distressed/modern with a hip vibe.  we shared a huge pork sandwich and got an egg with it, as our server sugessted. unfortunately the egg was a bit overcooked. the sandwich still tasted excellent, but could have been even better with a runny yoked egg. the potato chips were great and made on site.  free chips and salsa. excellent quality.  price was about what we paid in Seattle. beer $6, margarita $15 & $18 (for high end tequilla).  I would definately go back here. great service, food and vibe.  Love the monkey neon.",

I have been there multiple times, but I have never had to wait more than 15 min.  Food - The menu is short and sweet. They have lots of Mexican favorites. My favorite are the street tacos. The chicken and steak are perfectly seasoned and grilled to perfection. The tortillas are fluffy, and the guacamole is fresh. They also bring out a large plate of rice and beans to share family style for the table.   Drinks - They have the most fun and exotic margarita flavors. I have a strong liking for the paseo fruit and guava flavors. They are the perfect blend of fruit and tequila, and the tequila is hidden. They will hit you after 2-3.",

It was late on a Monday night, so it wasn't even close to crowded. However, the service was some of the worst that I have ever experienced. Getting water refills and the check was painfully slow.  The food was overpriced and uninspired. You expect fajitas to come out sizzling on a hot cast iron, but there was just a small hunk of meat and a lot of veggies on a plate. The carnitas tacos were dry and underwhelming, and did not come in the pulled pork form that I am accustomed to eating. My margarita was not much better.   I feel like this place spends more energy trying to look impressive with the decor and fancy names for menu items than it does on its food and service.",

    "text": "I've been to La Comida twice, both in very opposite environments. My first time was during off hours. Only two parties (including mine) were present in the restaurant. The second time was during Cinco de Mayo -- very busy!   Service 4.5/5 -- Although both experiences were very different, I experienced positive customer service. There's a server there who is extremely helpful who served us the first time... He's the guy who also works at Firefly!   My second time I sat at the bar to eat and had a bartender on our side who was busy. He was an older gentleman with white hair. He was quite inattentive with us and I understand how busy it was (I work in the restaurant business as well) but I really found it hard to capture his attention, especially when I was ready to order things. I personally felt like he skipped over us and couldn't even give us a \"okay, be right there\" type of response. He did end up noticing that I was probably slightly irritated and offered us free shots and a drink. The fact that he acknowledged it made me feel better about the service and the free things just made my experience way better!  Price 4/5 -- it's like $11-14 for three tacos. They're pretty delicious, though, and the food comes with delicious rice and beans and chips and salsa. It was $10ish for the Blood Orange Magarita.   Food 4.5/5 -- the tacos are delicious! I had the pollo and carne asada tacos. I am a huge fan with how fresh it tasted! The meat wasn't dry like some other places and the tacos had the right flavors. The Spanish rice that comes with your meal was also sooooooo delicious. I sometimes crave it! The guacamole is delicious as well! Yummy yummy. The salsa is free and yummy as well!  I ordered the blood orange margarita and it was so delicious! Does it even have any alcohol?! I could drink it like juice. The tequila shots we ordered were in the cutest cups too.   Overall, positive experiences despite the little hiccups in the beginning. Food and drinks are yummy but a little on the pricy side. I would come back here every now and then and definitely recommend their margaritas!",

When we arrived the place looked nice and welcoming but the service is horrible. The waiter took over 10 mins to come to our table and it wasn't even busy. He also never checked our table until we called him. The food was decent but way overpriced and so were the drinks. In the end for the 4 of us we ended up paying $185 for literally 2 appetizers, the chicken enchiladas and the carnitas tacos. Each one of us had 2 drinks. It sucked!!!

Here is what was good: atmosphere - old Mexico meets funky, eclectic downtown bar; location - between Fremont and The Container Park, where old school cool meets new hipster; margarita - the passion fruit margarita tasted fresh not a mix and good amount for the price; queso - cheese, pepitas, chorizo and drizzle of honey served with fresh corn tortillas (excellent); chips/salsa - best chips in Vegas; sea bass tacos - simple, fresh and tasty. Here is what was not good: service - all four of our meals were wrong or very late. It took a long time to get drinks, then apps, then food. The server was friendly and apologetic but still the food took a long time and was not what we ordered. The other three thought the food was just okay. Menu was small but different and authentic. We went on a Tuesday in March and it was not busy so I can't justify the service. Foodies might like it a bit more for the menu options and fresh taste. I liked it but the rest of my party was under impressed. I hope this helps you decide.",

My dad ordered the carnitas tacos and they were chunks of meat rather than shredded. My dads cup of water and coke were both dirty. We asked for a spicier salsa which we got and when we got the bill, we were charged for it! I swallowed my pride, left a minimal tip and went on my way knowing I'll never eat here again.  Again, this is my opinion and others may like it.  I must say though, the margaritas here are one of the best!",

Sea Bass entree was great, wife enjoyed her fish tacos.  Service was excellent.  Ceviche needed much more lime juice, barely tasted any lime.  Salsa was a waste of time, no spice and blah texture.",

Really yummy. The complimentary salsa was okay, nothing special. The ambiance of the room was really nice, very day of the dead and eclectic. I ordered the Pollo Al Horno. The server said that was great dish served in banana leafs. So I was pretty excited but he came back and told me it wasn't prepped and it would take 45 mins. He asked me if I like pork, I said no I don't eat any pork products. So he suggested a shrimp dish. Great. I love seafood. Food comes out. They also give us a family style plate of beans and rice to share. My seafood dish he picked for me has chorizo, pork product. My friend debates whether to eat his Camaron al maya tacos. After a bit of encouragement he eats and likes it.  Finally the sever comes back, apologizes. I ask just for carne asada tacos. The carne asada tacos are okay, it needed a bit of salt and some more heat. Nothing I would come back for. I would probably come back for just for drinks and atmosphere but never for food.",

Weighing only 110 pounds I'll probably lose 3 writing a review on La Comida, but I love YELP. Being that I wouldn't want anyone else to waste their hard earned money after dining at this establishment, I decided to do the good deed anyway! First of all the ambiance is really nice, I won't knock that at all. I will however dive right on in to say that the service stunk to high heaven. The waitress was combative and had more attitude than the law should allow, and this place couldn't get an order right to save their lives. What's more, they jacked up the billing transactions and overcharged my parties debit cards after we told them 3 times how we wanted the pricing broke down. (Screaming: LORD HAVE MERCY KELLY CLARKSON EDDIE MURPHY!!!) Needless to say, my visit here to celebrate a small bachelorette gathering left me livid by the end of the night. Of course I brought it to the manager's attention, and he in return threw in some extra desserts. Though, I would have preferred to have a much sweeter waitress than under-sweetened flan and tres leches cake. I say don't waste the time or energy on this place.  Just keep walking....and go on to Casa Don Juan, their authentic Mexican Cuisine is the truth baby!",

Unprofessional and childish. He didn't even attempt to understand what I was saying,  he didn't want to fix it. The food was ok, I wanted a vegan burrito and I asked the waiter if I could choose the ingredients (the menu didn't offer a vegetarian or vegan burrito already). He basically told me that they made a veggie burrito but it wasn't on the menu,  and that the cooks were going to make it their way.  After that he offered me the vegetarian menu,  from which I decided to order the meatless chicken tacos and the organic salad.  He never brought the salad and he brought a vegetarian burrito instead,  that pretty much was pure red and green bell peppers,  very watery and covered in salsa...weird! I'm not going back.",

    "text": "Went here for lunch.  Was a little confused where the entrance was.  The entire restaurant is open so you can see out onto the street and people walking or driving by can see in.  It's sort of roped off and you walk around the side of the building to get in.  I like the fact that you can see the cooks preparing the food but I hated the dinning area.  It is very small and they cram as many tables as possible into a tiny area.  It was 2 of us and they sat us at a 2 person table next to a table of four.  The tables were so close together we might as well have been siting with them.  If I stuck my elbow out it would have touched the person sitting at the next table.  To me that is ridiculous.  Thankfully they were wrapping up so we asked to be moved over after they left.  Now the menu, first thing I noticed was that the food is EXTREMELY over priced and there are no lunch specials.  I specifically asked the waiter did the meals come with sides and he said beans and rice.  The fish tacos were good but tiny.  We also ordered chicken enchiladas and asked for double rice, no beans with that dish. When the meals came the server only brought 1 small plate of beans and rice which were cold.  The other side of rice never came, I know they didn't expect us to share!  I called the waiter over and told him the beans and rice were cold and he was like \"Really\" and told him the double rice never came.  The chicken enchiladas were good besides the sauce on top, it was a very sweet sauce.  The service was a little slow but okay and the waiter did eventually bring out more beans and rice but by that time we were practically done with our main dish.   The music is loud and the place really busy.  Don't think I'll be back.  The food and ambiance is not worth the price.",

    "text": "I love happy endings, so when I heard the story about some old abandoned building that was turned into a cool Mexican restaurant in downtown I felt the urge to give it my support by letting then run my card through their reader, and of course enjoy some of their wonderful comida. To start we had the tortilla soup and some guacamole and both were decent. We ordered enchiladas de camaron, they were good with plenty of shrimp filling and cheese, it comes with two enchiladas and rice and beans to share. Also ordered the pollo al horno which it was very flavorful and juicy, it came wrapped on banana leaves and in a paper bag. Authentic? Who knows, it all depends from what area of Mexicos food you're accustomed to, all I was hoping for is some good food and I was not disappointed. Service was great. We were greeted by almost everyone in the building, we were served in a timely manner and glasses (mason jars) refilled constantly, no problems there. I love what they did with the place. Modern industrial look with exposed ducts and brick and imported Mexican tile. The cool bar with some gothic touches and saints, giving it a feel of a religious altar where I could just pray all night to the agave gods.  I do have a little problem with the rest rooms. Saloon swinging doors don't really work in bathrooms, I really believe that bathrooms doors should completely seal all bathroom activities from the rest of the restaurant, and also using Jesus and the Virgin Mary as marking signs for men and women is going to far, a bit insulting.  Prices are a little high, but the experience is worth it, I doubt I'll be a regular since this place is far from where I live and parking is not abundant but if I find myself in downtown again I'll make sure to stop by and try other items on the menu. I hope by then I find Jesus in the dining room or by the spirits. I pray to that.",

I tasted their Jalapeno passion fruit margarita and it tasted refreshing and not like most margaritas with that premixed generic flavor. Very good food and I really enjoy the style, ambiance and music. Service was great too. Will keep coming back:) 4 stars only because of the prices being a little steep for portion size and parking is always annoying downtown, not the restaurants fault but it does add a bit of frustration paying to park at the restaurant you're paying to eat at. Perhaps someday we'll be able to validate our parking if we're paying customers at these places downtown? Wishful thinking I'm sure",

It LOOKED like an overpriced, annoyingly pretentious place...but I'm trying not to be so judgy, so I finally went in to see what was up.  Honestly, I feel like there's no excuse to charge these prices for Mexican food. I mean, wtf. It's guacamole and corn chips and tequila, for pete's sake! It wasn't reCOCKulously expensive -- not as bad as I'd feared -- but was still pricey for what it was.  Food-wise, everything was ok. The free chips & salsa are fine, nothing out of the ordinary, but they did replenish our basket without even asking, so I give them points for that. I ordered the cheapest margarita on the list, which at $9 was OK... not bad by Strip standards, but this isn't the Strip!! Then I had the street corn appetizer, which was good, but...any better than real street corn at Valley View & Sahara for a fraction of the price? Then the snapper tacos, which were ok, but again...two smallish tacos for $12 or whatever it was? Really?   Ambiance-wise, the place was not NEARLY as annoying as I'd expected. It was actually kinda low-key, and I give them points for having plentiful outdoor seating.  Overall, the place was OK, but... too expensive for me to consider going back there.",

(Pescatarian options somewhat limited but not as bad as vegetarian - what is with Vegas and the limited Veggie options?) The Flan is a little stodgy on top but really yummy near the bottom. I had two passion fruit margaritas, the first of which was light on tequila and filled with this heavenly tart fresh passion fruit, which of course, prompted me to order a second, which arrived lacking in passion fruit and seriously tequila heavy, aah well.",

    "text": "Wow. So bad! We were here 4 years ago and the food was good and the drinks were really good! This time the food was awful and the drinks were not made fresh.   Our drinks came out and all you could taste was cloying sugar syrup. Folks, a Margarita is simple. You use fresh limes and no sweet/sour mix. Terrible!   I ordered the Camaron Del Golfo. This was shrimp, corn, squash, chorizo, cherry tomatoes, and a crema. The dish came with 3 shrimp! WTF? The corn was not roasted as stated in the menu. The squash and corn were both microwaved from frozen. The \"chorizo\" was frozen breakfast sausage. Do you really think we don't know what chorizo is?   My wife ordered the chicken enchilada. Waterlogged and gummy tortilla, piss-poor chicken and a flavorless sauce.   You could just tell they were doing everything on the cheap and lazy. A True sign that a restaurant is in trouble. Whether just by management or financial straits, this restaurant has taken a deep slide in 4 years. Avoid!",

    "text": "In town for vacation and always stay downtown on Fremont Street. Family members found this place and the reviews said it was \"really good\", so we decided to try it. My niece had a blood orange margarita and said it was really good as was the traditional margarita my sis-in-law ordered. The fellas ordered a PBR each and I had sprite--not much into margaritas!  Chips and salsa were delivered to the table and while the salsa had a wonderful flavor, there was not much heat to the salsa. We ordered the queso fundido which came out hot and steaming in a little iron skillet. I must say it was very tasty, but for the price it was overpriced ($13).   I ordered the fajitas, other family members ordered the torta grande, enchilada de pollo (chicken enchiladas), chili rellienos (sorry if it is misspelled), and lastly the nachos. The fajitas were cooked well and to order, but they were not sizzling when it came to the table (as I am used to having). The onions and bell peppers (both red and green) were not caramelized and still very crunchy. I even had the core of the onion where it was not cut off. Yuck!  Everyone else enjoyed their food, the grande torte was as the name suggested. My husband said it could feed 2 people. My niece's nachos-\"nothing to write home about\". The enchilada de pollo was very good according to the eater of the green sauce! And lastly, the chili rellienos was said to be \"ok\".   Would I come back, not for the price (about $150) for 5 people including drinks, not including the tip to the waiter. And speaking of service, it was slightly slow, but decent.",

But it was 7:00 on a Tuesday in Vegas which is on the early side. It was more than halfway full by the time we left.  It was so good! My husband had the smoked pork shoulder, I had the sea bass tacos. Both were excellent! The guacamole was amazing, and I would have been perfectly happy with just that and the house made chips. We split a pitcher of their blood orange margaritas--my first taste of tequila since a bad tequila experience my freshman year of college (30 years ago!). They were worth breaking my \"no tequila\" rule!  The pleasant, laid back vibe was exactly what I needed after the excessive lights/noise/smoke that permeates much of this city.  Definitely eat here if you're in the Fremont area, and it's worth the $25 taxi fare if you're staying on the strip.",

I know that birthdays aren't something that is mandatory to honor to guests, but I feel like the thought of it counts and guests really appreciate it.  The food was okay. The salsa is is served in really little bowls, had to ask for extra ones because they were finished quickly. The server recommended the pork shoulder, and I was not really a fan.  The margaritas that we ordered tasted awesome. However, they came in nice mason jars but it felt like there wasn't enough alcohol inside of them.",

My other half and I rolled in here shortly after 6:00 PM, the Saturday of Labor Day weekend. We were told, our only option is the right side of the bar, so we took it. It was clear they were setting up for an event, while still trying to accept walk ins.  First, let's talk about the positives. I love the decor. The hidden front walkway entrance. The swing. (yes a real swing at the bar) And of course the huge wall of tequila is pretty breathtaking. Maybe the authentic look set my expectations too high.  Between the two of us, we ordered fajitas, potato tacos, ceviche, a salsa trio, and a guava margarita. The fajitas were bland. Not bad, just boring. What fajitas don't come out sizzling? These ones.  Potato taco, I would give these a C+ or even B-. Not bad, but not amazing. The best part was the jalapeno crema. (Not what I expect the best part to be on a taco) Ceviche, PASS! I was so excited because it came with mango and jalapeno. Nope. Way too sweet, not nearly enough lime, cilantro, or cucumber to even out the flavors.  Salsa trio, 2 outta 3 were great. The \"attempt at being spicy\" one, try again folks.  However, my margarita was great. Fresh juice, tons of options. Not too sweet or strong. I would return for drinks. And maybe chips and salsa. But if I want good Mexican food, I am looking elsewhere.",

Our server was attentive and really friendly.  We really knew the menu.  The vibe in the place is super cool too!  Love the old church windows in the bar.  Starting with chips and fantastic salsa, everything was delicious! Perfect amount of heat in the salsa.  We shared the nachos which tasted like home made with chucks of meat and generous amounts if toppings.    We also shared the chicken burrito which was amazing.  My hubby would have licked the plate to get all the tomatillo sauce.  Yummm.  We finished with the Tres Leche cake. Oh yaaaaa! Perfect sweet treat!  Really amazing food!",

    "text": "THEY STOLE FROM ME! DOUBLE CHARGE!!! I used to come here minimum 1 a week . Not ever again. We came in we sat down and this quirky girl came to take our order. We just wanted water and she just wouldn't have it she kept trying to force things down our throat. She said \"you come just for water?\" Then when we would get a drink she would say, \" oh that one isn't good, try this one.\" Obviously she would pick the most expensive things to shove down our throats. I know upsale-ing is part of the job but not when she insults our choices.   She finally uncomfortably made some of us go with her choice just so she can leave us alone.  She forgot some of the drinks, we wanted regular cheese dip and brought us a weird type of cheese mixture when she said it was normal cheese. Again to trick us.   She brought our check.  I was almost tricked into leaving double tip!!!!.  I saw my bill and there was a large tip sum added without my consent. I asked her what this charge was she said it was that way because it was a group.  But no where were we told she said she couldn't tell me how they came up with this number.  Then she said it was automatic 15%. I was upset at this point. She kept trying to bully everyone into buying things, insulted our choices, forgot some of our order and was tricking us into leaving extra tip.   I asked to speak to the manager  she came, very rudely said that she would remove the tip. But after confirming the tip was not 15% but 18 and that the other waitress was new and didn't know.   Saying if I don't want to leave tip it's fine but that it's always added when it's a group as a curtesy , but that she would take it off because I don't want to leave a tip. What kind of manager is this?! So damn rude. Kept repeating and saying it out loud that I didn't want to leave a tip.   Which was not True, I always leave a tip but not when they are tricking me in to giving 18% and extra.   So my bill was 38 she said she was going to refund and charge me only that not the 18%   So she did, we went home and saw my bank account and only 1 charge of....$83.20 !!!!! Where did this 83 come from?  I was charged a little over double. !!!!   I immediately called her. As supposedly the manager reversed the first payment and not charged again so I should have two payments on there but I only have one.   She assured me there was only one charge and that the bank hasn't released it back to me. She also said that she would send me an email receipt. This all happened this past Sunday . It is now Tuesday and I am still waiting for that email. And my money back.   I I'll never be coming back and neither will any one I know. So disappointed .   Give me my money back you guys stole!!!!",

For my entree, I never stray away from the pollo al horno. It is sooooooooo good. Other people that I go there with have had different items on the menu and everyone always loves the food. I don't think it is pricey at all. The food isn't exactly your typical Mexican food experience, but is my \"go to place\" when someone suggests Mexican food. I love it.",

Street parking only. It was on a weekday and fairly empty, so we had no problems with changing our reservation multiple times.  Right away we jumped on some chips and guac. Their guacamole is very good, I was a fan of that. I wasn't too hungry so I ordered some tacos, their carnitas to be exact. Every Mexican restaurant has their own version of carnitas and these ones weren't too bad. I just felt they were missing something, it didn't have that oomph.  Check out the awesome sink in their bathroom! It's unique. Service was pretty good, but it wasn't busy so that's predictable. Seems like a fun place to drink and good for large parties with the outdoor patio area. But the food can be improved upon.",

The decor really interesting with Rosary's on part of one wall, and wrought iron in front of the kitchen it is a really artistic space.   The staff is very attentive and makes sure you have plenty of chips and salsa, and that your drinks are refilled when needed.  The chips were fresh and warm, the salsa was spicy and flavorful. Our group had a nice selection from the menu and all of them were tasty and flavorful. Chicken Tortilla soup, nice and creamy with large chunks of shredded chicken, good spice level with a very rich taste, good size bowl with more than enough for two to share.  Carnitas Tacos, were small but filling, 3 per plate with nice little chunks of pork goodness. Chicken Enchiladas, two large  enchiladas per plate, very large and filling, red sauce was a bit too sweet for my taste but adding some of the salsa made them very tasty. Fajitas, enough for two to share, very tasty and filling. Mexican corn, rice and beans are all served family style but there was more than enough to go around for our party of 7 Finished it off with tres-leeches cake which was very good.  Service was outstanding, food was very good, location was very convenient to where we were at the time and we would go back",

The drinks are about the only things I can say are consistently good - that is if you can get one, cause the service here is consistently bad!  To the food.... I have tried the tostada de atun and the beef fajitas, the food is alright, nothing that I could recommend as a must try.  I would love to see this place succeed, I think the decoration and concept are great, but each time I have been here the service has been awfully bad, the wait staff has an overall attitude as though you are a bother to them, and they do not hesitate to say it and show it. As mentioned the food is mediocre, and could use some flavor and flare improvements.  I do have many well wishes for this restaurant as the downtown area is flourishing with many great new and upcoming places and continuing to grow.",

For dinner at night in November, we couldn't sit outside which was a shame, because when I went for lunch it was a beautiful day and seems like such a fun place to grab a margarita and some chips with friends. I've tried the fish tacos which were just alright, but I was actually blown away by the chicken burrito with green salsa. (Forgive my complete lack of Spanish speaking and translation ability). I've never ordered a chicken burrito in my life, carne asada all the way. But this was huge, the chicken was tender, and I was most impressed by the salsa on top. It was super tangy and fresh, and had tons of lime and herbs.   Free chips and salsa, yummy guac, and the guava margarita is pretty good. Prices are a bit above average.",

    "text": "The best way I can describe this place is hip, trendy, and overpriced. I've had lunch here several times. I won't come back again unless the boss is paying; that's a fact. The only parking is public, and you have to pay, so bring your quarters! Let's just break today's experience down step by step:  - Decor. The dining and bar are in one big room with very artsy decor and clever furnishings. The music is a bit loud for business lunches, but adds to the artsy entertainment factor. One of the main attractions used to be the very fit and attractive female bartenders and hostess. It appears they were off today.   - Service. Standard. Nothing above par. I had to ask for a water refill.   - Chips and Salsa. One more day, and the store-bought chips will be stale. The salsa was thick and smoky, if you're into that, and I swear they put molasses in it. Not a fan. I like good ol' fashioned salsa picante!  - Passionfruit Margarita. Great flavor, one of many. It was $10. A couple of pitfalls, though. It seemed like a small serving (small mason jar), couldn't taste the alcohol. Also, they fill the glass half full with ice. I get that it's Las Vegas, but c'mon. That is not standard procedure for blended margaritas, muchachos.  - Shrimp Ceviche. This was $12. The shrimp tasted fresh and the side of plantain chips was nice, but again, I felt the portion was small and something was off about the sauce. It tasted too watery and sweet. Needed more cilantro, lemon, and salt.  - Grilled Fish Tacos. This was the highlight of the meal. The yellow tortillas for the street tacos were the perfect consistency, and the fish was very moist and good. With a nice relish garnish.   - Beans and Rice. Came with the fish tacos. Nothing to brag about. Just standard flavors. Beans were a little bland and the rice a little dry.  That's it. All in with tip and tax, I paid $42 for just lil ol' me. I think if they had lower prices, I wouldn't have an issue about recommending this place. It really is a nice hangout downtown and seems like it has great potential for nightlife, but not on my dime.",

It's almost 1 am this place is going off, hard to believe it's after midnight with the crowd here.   Very open space & lots of fresh air which is cool bc its 70 degrees & patio doors are wide open. Everything was too spicy for me, I only go to Mexican because the boyfriend enjoys it so much. I feel stupid asking ... is it mild? Like not hot or peppery or spicy? Just know that if you can't do spicy then it will be a difficult place for you to order from. The fajitas were very seasoned and too hot for me so I really didn't get to have a dinner, just ate some chips.",

My group made it quite clear that we were there to eat and drink and the server didn't come to us even though our first round was empty for at least 20 minutes. After we got our food, I got the burger and all I wanted was some ketchup. The server did not come and ask us once whether we needed anything or how our food was after it was dropped. He dropped the check without even asking if we wanted another round or if we wanted dessert. I could understand if they were at least busy but it was super quiet while we there so he had the time to give us better service. All that being said, the queso is amazing. I just wish we had a better server.",

    "text": "The ONLY reason this place earned 2 stars was for the service.    We were greeted by John, the bartender after sitting for a few minutes, I can only assume that was his name as this is the name that appeared on my receipt.   I will say John was extremely attentive to a group to my left and a group to my right, but somehow we were missed. The couple to my left were complaining about something because not only did the chef come out to speak with them but the manager as well. I guess that might be what it takes to get service in this place. Another thing I didnt like is that John was drinking ont he job, he had a shot of something with the group of men to my right. BAD!!!  As for the decor the lighting was bad, I had to use the flashlight on my phone to read the menu. The menus lacked description of how the item is prepared but did list all the ingredients. The feel of the place was very casual and relaxed. Although VERY loud, your typically Mexican home during dinner time.   The food was different than anything I have experienced. Not your typical Mexican food. I would not even call it Mexican, more like a mexi-fusion of some sort.   The chips and salsa were were given, were heavenly. The chips were light, not too oily but not too thin that they crumble while dipping. The salsa was a blend of roasted tomatoes and green chili. Not too spicy but could have used a little salt, Overall very good.   My husband had a shrimp dish that he was over the moon about, the shrimp was cooked to perfection and sat atop a bed of sausage, potato and other veggies.   I ordered the pollo de horno, as the menu did not give a detailed description I was not sure what I was getting other than chicken. when it arrived, I have to say, I was taken aback by the presentation, it was served in a paper package, wrapped with banana leaves. The chicken was 2 pieces, a leg and a thigh, in a  poblano sauce with squash and onion, The chicken was so tender and flavorful, my mouth is watering as i write this review.   The down side to the meal was that the sides are served family style. The small, and I do me small platter of rice and beans was not enough for 2 people, I seriously thought a 2nd platter would be brought since we ordered 2 entrees. the rice had great texture and flavor. I would say almost as good as my own. The beans were tasty too and I am quite picky with my bean, If they are not my Tia Jenny's forget it. These were pretty good, Sorry Tia.   I might try this place again, maybe sit at a table and not the bar. this place is rather small and the lay out looked like it catered to larger crowds, so I thought sitting at the bar would be easier and they could serve more customers. Boy was I wrong.",

I think this is a much better pub than restaurant, overall. I love the decor, and the service is usually very friendly. The margaritas are terrific, and the atmosphere makes it a nice place to meet with friends, so I am glad it is a part of the downtown scene. That said, the food either needs to be a little more affordable or be prepared with more care and attention.   Parking is a general nightmare.",

This was the best meal we had on our 4-day Vegas vacation and the service there was absolutely outstanding.  We sat at the bar because the tables were all full.  Our bartender was awesome - super friendly and on top of everything.  She offered us chips and salsa right off the bat - the chips were thick, crunchy and delicious.  The salsa was pretty good.  I had the carnitas tacos which were yummy.  The meat was tender and juicy which I'm actually not used to getting (usually it's fried so it's drier).  My hubs got a smoked beef  dish that he really liked.  I also ordered a Paloma which was light and refreshing.  And for my hubby's b-day they gave us a free shot which was really tasty.  I really have no complaints.  I knew this wasn't a low-rent, low-quality restaurant before we walked in the door and it exceeded my expectations.  I wish them much success.",

First off it's soo loud in there you can't even hear what anyone is saying. Then there food is disgusting. Defiantly not Mexican that's for sure. They really should change the name of this restaurant because it doesn't fit there food. I had the carne Asada salad and let me say this . They didn't serve me carne Asada . It was more like steak saturated in soy sauce BARF!!! It was gross ! I didn't even finish my food I was soo disgusted . And then there beans were hard not cooked right at all and had a weird after taste . Even the ice tea was nasty. Seriously don't waste your money and your better off going to a fast food Mexican restaurant than here. It's like they made up all there food . No authentic Mexican restaurant would serve ANY of the food they serve . Ok rant over.",

There were 4 of us in our group - and we all had the same opinion...it was OK - wouldn't run to go there again.  The menu is unclear...I thought I was ordering a sea bass dinner - turned out it was tacos.  Two of our group got different types of tacos - they said they were \"meh\"...and that they've had as good or better for $5 off a food truck.  One other person got a pork dish, which I tasted and thought it was pretty good...however she said a lot of the meat was dry, like it was overcooked.  I wanted something other than slaw as my side, but they don't have just regular veggies.  I could have onions, or jalapenos, but that was about it.  They serve the rice and beans family style, which I've never heard of or seen before - pretty small plate for four people to have to eat from.  I had a prickly pear margarita which was excellent.    The music was way too loud. Nothing \"background\" about it -  we had to practically scream to be heard.  Yeah maybe I'm geting old, but dining is usually a social activity and background music is best!  The overall appearance of the place is rustic/retro/south of the border kind of feel.  So overall, I'd have to say that the food was marginal at best.  Not likely I'll go there again.",

I said nothing until my wife noticed it too.  All food seemed overpriced and portions were very small.  All the food seemed unseasoned.  When I told the waiter were were all wanting tacos he recommended the sea bass tacos.  They seemed very overpriced for only three tacos but he did recommend them so my wife ordered them.  I got the carne asada tacos. When the fish tacos arrived, we were overcome by a strong fishy smell.  We began to doubt if it was sea bass at all.  Also, the menu claimed that they were tempura battered.  They were beer battered.  Any taco cart in town serves carne asada tacos with more flavor.   The torta that my daughter ordered had the worst meat patty I have ever seen in any dining establishment.  Not only that, but the ham smelled terrible.  I took it out of the half my daughter gave me to tsate.  It smelled off and was clearly from a can (it had the telltale rounded corners of canned ham). Do not eat here.",

On top of that the rice and beans were ice cold as if they just pulled the out of the fridge and then served them. Come on guys! Really! At least have some respect for yourselves, if not for your customers. The only thing that was enjoyable was the margaritas. But seriously this is Las Vegas you can get a margarita anywhere. Don't support this disgrace to Mexican cuisine. Go somewhere else. If your downtown and crave Mexican food venture off a little bit and try one of the many taco carts.

This was really great. Our party had the Enchillada De Pollo which is Pulled Chicken, Queso Fresco, Onions, Mole Poblano Sauce Service was great and the ambience relaxing amidst the craziness of Fremont street.  It's fairly easy to spot off of Fremont Street since there is a 7-foot tall pink neon monkey clinging to the rooftop.",

I've been waiting for this place to work out some quirks since I have heard bad things and they have bad reviews on yelp.  I thought they are new and are just trying to find the groove.  My boyfriend and I went last night for date night. We saw all the bad reviews, then a couple good reviews showed up and we thought let's give this place a shot, maybe the other reviewers are just not used to this style of Mexican food.  The price is what I would expect at a this kind of place but the food was not.  The chips and salsa were great but the two entrees we got were sooooo bland.  Where is the flavor, it seems to be non-existent.  Our server was great, she even offered to take one of the entrees off the bill.  Which I think is super cool because I assumed we would just pay for them and be unhappy.  Bottom line, I will not come back for food!  I did see they have happy hour and I have heard the margaritas are good, so I will come back and try the discounted margaritas some time. Maybe if we drink a couple margaritas we won't care that the food is bland.",

    "text": "Very solid restaurant worth checking out in downtown. Hopefully this will help lead to a resurgence of downtown dining and business outside of the Fremont Street hotels and casinos. The points people make about the cost are somewhat valid, but this isn't a taqueria, this is much more of a chef driven better quality restaurant. Puerco ahumado was $15, but for a huge portion of smoked pork in a mole`. Great taste. At $11 for 2 the tacos are overpriced, but are high quality so you are getting what you pay for. My usual taqueria has all tacos for $1.30, so I feel the price point issue like everyone else. These are modern/upscale versions of Mexican food, so don't come here and expect it to be \"authentic\" (see my comment about $1.30 tacos above for my idea of Mexican American food, but there are lots of variations on Mexican cuisine, including fine dining in Mexico so what really is \"authentic\"?). Nice place, communal seating, very nice looking antique-ish back bar, and very good service make this place worth checking out. The drinks are interesting, and they have a massive selection of tequilas (up to $100) to try if you're interested in something other than Jose Cuervo. Taqueria or Taco Bell vs. upscale Mexican, the choice is up to you. If you want better than the former 2 this place is worth visiting.",

    "text": "I am going to start off by just stating that this place is hit-or-miss.  I've been here before for events and had a great time.  Everyone loves the cocktails and the bartender KNOWS his tequilas.  I've never really sat down for serious eating here until two days ago.  I waited 48 hours to write this and I still can't shake feeling ripped off.    I generally shrug off service issues.  La Comida is a hip place in a currently hip part of town.  I'm not there for Zagat rated service.  But in a restaurant a quarter full, we shouldn't have had to wait 10 minutes for a server. This set the stage. We asked about any specials, but the server told us they are listed on the menu. I then pointed out those were SPECIALTIES, do they have any daily specials? I then told him in Spanish. He got it, laughed and said no.  Pretty matter of fact, but on top of a ten minute wait, not appreciated.   I ordered the shrimp ceviche. My date the chicken burrito.  My \"dinner\" came back a little cup of miniature shrimp, no bigger than a dime, on top of some diced fruits and avocado. It looked and tasted like half of the serving you get in a 99 cent shrimp cocktail in sundae glass up the block the California Hotel on Fremont Street.  Worse? It tasted like it! I couldn't believe it. The way it was described by the waiter, it seemed it would at least be in league with similar restaurants.  This couldn't even hold a candle to Applebee's.  This dish was $12 and it couldn't have cost them more than a quarter to make.  I was livid, but on a date, so just smiled....and drank my warm Modelo.  My date fared better. The chicken burrito had a chewy tortilla wrap, but the chicken was good and somewhat ample.  It was also kind of pricy at 12 bucks, but could tolerate it because was more than a cup of miniature brine shrimp at the same price. My date's Modelo was also warm (but we were told they were supposed to be like that by the waiter. OLE')  Bottom line...this is a destination restaurant more for taking selfies with drinks in hand than actually eating food.  I don't think the owners, Jenna and Michael Morton, who are renowned for creating dining experiences, are probably even privy to this kind of spotty food and service going on.  I'm hoping they are not.  But if it's really good food you want for the money, I'd say have a drink here first and move on.",

    "text": "Really good entrees. I would have given 5 stars, but the service was pretty slow and the chips were crappy. On the other hand, had it been faster I probably would have drank way too much! So they probably did me a favor. We had the skirt steak and shrimp and the 3-pack of salsas. The entrees were FANTASTIC. The corn / squash hash with the shrimp was amazing! They were a tiny bit stingy with the shrimp (only 4!) but I would order again, anyway. The chips seemed like they came out of a bag, which was disappointing, and 2 of the 3 salsas (tomatillo and avocado) were way too sweet (like tasted artificially sweetened, honestly). But the hot one was great and the chipotle salsa that comes with your meal is pretty good. The steak was good, too, but awkward to eat with a butter knife. Ha. Maybe a service issue. The very best thing about the place, in my opinion, is that you can sit on the patio and watch the never ending shit-show of Fremont Street flow past like a river. Best and most entertaining Friday night view for dinner EVER. Can't wait to go back.",

The Manager, Suda was also great. She recognized us as the Curly Girls from another downtown establishment and came over an gave us a hug and everything. So sweet when people take the time to engage with you! They even sent us some yummy guacamole. The food was tasty and flavorful. I had a shrimp quesadilla and a prickly pear margarita.

Just happened into La Comida and had one of our best meals in Vegas.  The Pork Shoulder was outstanding as was the rest of the meal.  Our waiter was terrific, took time with us, and talked about the recipies and the different items on the menu.  Since we were so curious, the Chef also stopped by to explain the food came from the Gulf area of Mexico.  Salsa smokey, drinks were excellent, and the flan was different from what we get in LA.    If we were not leaving the next day, we would have gone back.  If you are heading down to Freemont Street, or if you are looking for an excellent meal, go to La Comida.  I think you will enjoy it.  Spend a few minutes and talk with the waiter about the different items and what is unique about the seasonings. Go for sometime special.    Cheers.",

I still think it is a nice concept, and with some tinkering it can be successful...as for me, I'll probably make the short drive down to Los Tacos or Tacos el Gordo to satisfy my lunchtime Mexican cravings.",

    "text": "Went here for lunch, cute place, I liked the decor.  The chips were good, light, crispy and hot and I liked their salsa, a little bit of smoke to it. I ordered the cameron al maya -fried shrimp taco with mango and habanero salsa. The shrimp had a bit of a fishy taste to me, and yes I know they are shrimp so they are supposed to be fishy (duh...), but this was the scrunch your nose up not so good fishy taste. Still holding strong though and not sick so that's a good sign! The shrimp were pretty small. The tacos had a kick to them with the habanero salsa.  They came with beans and rice but it was sent over on a small plate to be \"family style\" with my friend - the \"family style\" portion is about the size each person would get on their own plate in a normal sit down mexican restaurant.  You received three tacos with any of the taco plates. It was $12, and the tacos were equivalent to a standard street taco as to size. I think they price was a bit expensive for what you get. The drinks sounded good, but I did not imbibe. Overall cute place, decent food, a bit pricey for what you get, nothing memorable as to the flavor profile. Also, I asked the waitress what she recommended she immediately steered me to the most expensive item on the menu ($22) - I am always skeptical when this happens but maybe she gets to eat for free and that just happens to be her favorite, she recommended a few other of the higher priced items too. Ultimately, I just got what I wanted in the first place. With so many other places in town, and for being a pricier mexican establishment, I don't think I will be back.",

    "text": "Well holy shit - my first Vegas review!  I have recently relocated to the city of Vegas for work, from the beautiful Derby City of Louisville, KY, and I am having a blast exploring the city and everything it has to offer, so let's get down to it!  To me, the beauty of Mexican food is that it is very communal and down-to-earth.  Its flavors are brought to life through the simple preparation of simple ingredients, mixed just right.  It's just good, homely food, free of pretentiousness, generous in quantity, and best enjoyed in a laid-back, unassuming environment.  And that's precisely where La Comida, with its cool, bohemian, ironically hip vibe collides with the heart and soul of traditional Mexican food.  It strips away the real idiosyncrasies of authentic Mexican dining in order to offer a distant, mutated version of it, conveniently prepackaged for the haughty, trend-seeking crowd.  Let's face it, no Mexican restaurant touting any kind of authenticity would charge so damn much for such modest portions, nor would it pepper its ambiance with a faux Latin cover of \"Sweet Dreams\" by Eurhythmics and dubstep remixes of Ace of Base, which I caught playing over the PA.  To be fair, the food was not bad.  My Pollo al Horno was actually tasty (though a bit on the dry side) and the chips and salsa were also quite good and obviously homemade.  The service was also pretty good; prompt and very courteous, so basically the root of my dissatisfaction comes down to price.  Look, if you're going to charge me $20 for a margarita, I expect a commemorative pair of booty shorts, or a kitschy container I get to take home or something.  There is also no way I'm shelling out $5 for a can of PBR, unless that can is a barrel and I also feel if I'm going to pay $16 for a chicken entree, I should get my own rice and beans.  Having to share such a tiny portion with my entire table didn't feel like a courtesy but more of a peeve.  I'm not sure I want to back to La Comida.  I get the sense that they're trying to elevate and experiment with Mexican cuisine which is all fine and good but the food was just okay, which considering the prices and the ambiance to me it means they're way off the mark.  A cool vibe will never replace a satisfactory dining experience, so I echo the sentiments of those who've said they much rather eat a cheap, seedy joint offering better food at reasonable prices.  On that note, who's got recommendations for a GOOD Mexican place?  Sorry LV, this is one area where I still remain far from impressed!",

So a table of 9 just got up and left.  But  terrible service aside, no small bowl of guacamole is worth $11. It's just not. And their drinks are the same story. for what they were offering it was way too much. I can (and did) go around the corner for some delicious thai food and a beer for what it would have cost me to have just 1 of their \"premium\" (read mid-level) margaritas.   And if you're thinking I'm just a cheap-skate you're woefully mistaken. Go hunt down the Laundry room. I was drinking there the night before and the cocktails were worth every penny.",

Everyone was really friendly and the service was excellent, but I wasn't impressed with the food at all. I ordered the Red Snapper for $22 and it over cooked on the outside and covered in salt and pepper. One of my friends said it best: \"if you think it's salty, it must have been really salty\". I eventually scraped all the salt and pepper off the fish and managed to choke it down with help from my iced tea. I thought the Cheese Fundido was a bit flavorless so I asked my friends what they thought about the meal before I wrote this review. It sounds like I'm not the only one in the group that didn't think the food was note worthy so I decided to write an honest review. The chips and salsa were \"meh\" and the Guacamole dip was even more \"meh\".    I don't feel the food is worthy of what they charge so I think you should leave it for the tourist and hit Tacos El Gordo or Don Jaun.",

Which is usually comped, dropped a $250 tab, which is fine.....except the service was horrible and it took 45 min for ceviche, which came out hot because I assume someone left it under the headlamp? Fast forward 2 days, they had a glitch with the POS system and I got charged 12 times! Totally well over $2,000 which prompted chase fraud alert to lock out my account, 2 days later la comida finally put the money back in my account, but still retained the $250. I called to complain, not even a apology ? Ok so that was a while ago, I was over it! Until today! Lunch? Never going back.....ever! Which sucks because I live downtown and it's walking distance to my building.   Service: deplorable, took 45 min. For 3 tacos, and got the wrong tacos.  Food: wrong tacos......sent them back and waited another 15 min. For new ones....they might have been good but i wasn't in the mood at that point.   Same as before, did the employee even apologize? No did a manager stop by? No   I know this is not how the owner runs his business! La cave and crush are on point! 5 stars in all areas! What's up with la Comida?",

Bottom line is \"I've had better.\" - I've definitely had better Mexican food and better drinks, BUT this is a fun place downtown to hang out and grab some food, (I've yet to try Le Thai).  The outdoor seating and on a nice day with a couple of beverages, is definitely worth it.   I got the Shrimp Salad with large shrimp, mandarin oranges, some walnuts, and a sweet dressing. I really liked this salad when paired with my Prickly Pear cocktail.   My friend got the chicken enchiladas with red sauce. It wasn't spicy but lacked flavor and spices that I know that chicken enchiladas usually have. The sides were rice and beans.   The service- I think they are still working out the kinks, our server brought us a copy of our receipt with no place to sign or tip..? We had to get this matter resolved with the hostesses up front.  If I was downtown hanging out and bar hopping, would I hop over to La Comida? Probably not.   Would I come here for Mexican food? Most likely not. There are better places in the valley for Mexican food.  Oh, and BTW they are one of the few Mexican food restaurants that don't give chips and salsa to start with..",

The drinks here aren't cheap either...7+ for a beer and something like 15-45 for margaritas! The service we received from our waiter and his assistants was excellent.

We followed the crowd and from the cute alleyway entrance to the comfy booths, were really impressed with the character of the place.    The cocktails were delicious, the service was attentive and knowledgeable and the food was great.  The chips were homemade and warm, and the salsa was some of the best I've ever tasted - and I've tasted lots.  The guac was fresh.  I had the fajitas and ended up not even needing the tacos and just ate the platter of meat and veggies because it was fresh and well cooked.    We moved on to Arizona from Vegas where you naturally get tons of Mexican choices and we found ourselves referring back to La Comida as the best authentic cuisine we've experienced the whole trip.  Great find off the beaten path.",

As the expert tour guide that I am, I quick pull a 180 and see out of the corner of my eye this little joint called, \"La Comida\". Surely, the best restaurants are the ones that look a little sketch on the outside. She becomes a little concerned but agrees none the less. We turned the corner down the long walkway to the entrance and it becomes cuter and cuter. As we enter, the inside has an authentic type feel and is surprisingly really awesome! The decor has a theme and the place is pretty hopping.  So we order drinks, the house margarita and a prickly pear margarita (when in the southwest, do as the tourists do). They come out in mason jars and that adds to the ambiance. The staff was super friendly and got really excited when our guy friend followed the sign above the bar that read \"For a good time call Kat (insert restaurant phone number)\". The man who waited on our table was really fun and kept calling us \"family.\"  We ordered the Red Snapper Tacos and the guy friend got the red snapper entree. Both were good. They tasted fresh and the flavors blended well, but the tortillas felt a bit slimy. However, the best part of the culinary experience was the salsa--hands down! The salsa was a blend of spicy and smooth, and was probably one of the best salsas I have had in a really long time!   Mid-way through our meal, the guy friend comments that this would be a great date place. He is totally right, fun ambiance, good (and slightly messy) food, and the volume is great for conversation.",

The restaurant was decorated and the staff had on costumes so it made for a good festive atmosphere.  We were on the verge of leaving when the server showed up.  It took awhile to be acknowledged after being seated and they were not busy at all considering we were there on Halloween.  The chips and salsa are complimentary. They serve a red salsa that was flavorful and had a little bit of heat.  Pretty good.  The burrito was mediocre. It was smothered in green sauce that was pretty good but the inside looked and tasted like I was at Chipotle.  It needed more flavor.   The steak fajitas were delicious. The meat was tender and cooked just right. They were served with corn tortillas.  The corn was absolutely amazing. It was cooked perfectly and had a little bit of crunch and not too mushy. The flavors blended well with the butter, lime, and cheese.  I'll try it again but I'm not too confident the service will be any different.",

I rarely eat twice at the same place but during this short three-day trip, I had to hit this one twice.   The food is excellent. I went with something called the Torta Grande, with egg added. This is a HUGE sandwich and, although I have a large appetite, could not finish it all. Took half out in a to go bag and gave it to a guy on the street.   The Torta Grande was outstanding, as were the chips & salsa that came with it. Went back for the Pozole and it was outstanding as well.   There is a lot of indoor and some outdoor seating, as well as a spacious bar. Staff is awesome. Professional and helpful if, like me, you're having trouble deciding what to get.   First class act all around.   And bonus points for playing Depeche Mode in the background.   Looking forward to a return visit here.",

    "text": "Weird, thought I'd written a review about La Comida, but it appears no. So, here we go.  Located in the Fremont East area, a block or so from Container Park, the outside is inviting just by the shear whimsical flair of the neon monkey sign and brightly colored flowerpots lining the walls as you enter and finally the traditional Virgin Mary of Guadalupe statue.   Inside is equally thoughtful in the Mexican design.  The bar area, stocked full of different tequilas  (and other liquors and beers) is adorned with rustic wooden and stained glass cathedral pieces. The walls with weathered wallpaper and tons of rosaries surround wooden tables with a mish-mash of Mexican style chairs and benches. A+ in decor.  Food, it's good, but not fantastic. The chips and salsa they provide are very good, the guac is also very good. However, the other dishes we've ordered are not so fabulous. The pozole was decent in flavor, and quite a bit of chili was added to bring more flavor. The burrito was commented to be good, but nothing spellbinding. The chicken fajitas were definitely tasty, but I was disappointed that they seemed warmed and served on a regular plate. Traditionally, Tex-Mex fajitas are usually served sizzling and steaming hot. The chicken tacos have some strange green guac-salsa verde that is not very appetizing. If we go again I will ask for no green salsa on top of the tacos. The house margarita was very tasty, though! I like how they serve it in a mason jar, keeping with the artsy-rustic feel.  Service is awesome, both times we've been to La Comida, Frank with the cool mustache has been our waiter. Nice guy, very friendly.",

The atmosphere's really neat-- cool Latin decor, intimate lighting, and hip music. The staff was super friendly, too. Shout out to Frank! You definitely helped make the night!  We ordered an array of things, but we probably could have been gotten away with just eating the complimentary chips and salsa. My friends all ordered different margaritas, and they were raving about the variety of options and the unique flavors that were offered. The food hit the spot, too, and was a reasonable price. It was nice getting away from the ritzy (new) Vegas strip. If I ever found myself back in Las Vegas, I would definitely go again.",

    "text": "Since Minh plans our anniversary trips, I get to plan our anniversary dinner wherever we go.  After doing some research and asking some of our Vegas friends about this place, (the other reviews really do not do it justice) I was told that this would be the perfect spot of us.  Called the week of and made reservations, the girl who answered the phone was pleasant. I was asked if we were celebrating anything that night. Said we were it was our anniversary. Was told that there would be something special for us after our dinner. I do not ever except a restaurant to do anything nice like that (half the time they are busy and forget).   We arrived sort of late due to the fact we were staying about 30 minutes from DTLV. No, problem as I called to let them know we were running late. The guy who answered the phone said he would move our reservation to an hour later just in case we hit traffic. Parking is by street only, which is not a huge deal as this place is located right in the heart of all the awesome bars and Fremont Street!  Walking into this place is just how the photos are, super dark and full of amazing vintage lights, a neon pink monkey sits high above on the side of the building, potted plants and flowers line the side of the wall, Mexican artwork and religious figures greet you as you walk inside.  **Note: You enter in on the side of the building. It looks confusing but trust me as we stood outside after taking photos looking like to dumb idiots trying to figure out how to get inside**   Entering into the actual restaurant was even more beautiful! It was still dark with candles on the table, Dia de Muertos stuff was displayed all over, and they were playing The Cure and other likes of music. I am in LOVE!  The hostess showed us to our table, and then our server came promptly after to take our drink order while another server brought us fresh chips and salsa. We decided to order some guacamole to go a long with our crunchy snack. For $8.00, you get a huge bowl of freshly prepared guacamole mixed with pico de gallo, jalapeno, and zesty lime juice. Muy delicioso!!  Ordered one more appetizer to try Elotes Asados $8.00 Mexican Street Corn, queso fresco and chile lime butter. It is off the cob, which makes it a lot easier to share. They give you a huge plate of this too!  Our server gave us more than enough time to enjoy our conversation and appetizers. When we were ready she came back to take out order.  Enchilada De Pollo- $14.00 -Pulled Chicken, queso fresco, onions and mole poblano sauce. I was not expecting this enchilada dish to be giant but it was staring right back at me. The smell from the mole sauce started to make me drool (and kind of miss my nana she made the best mole) Well here goes nothing, I sank my fork and knife into the hot mole and tortilla out came a huge cloud of steam followed by the aroma of marinated pollo and onion. First bite was delicious!  The mole sauce was sweet but not over baring like some of them can be!   I tried my hardest to finish the whole thing but with a night of partying after, I decided it probably would not be a good idea to be Enchilada wasted!  Service was great, they did not do anything for our anniversary like promised, but as I said, I do not ever expect!   Would we return yes! Their happy hour I heard is awesome, as I would like to try their sangria and some more of their appetizers.",

As a vegetarian, I really didn't see anything on the menu that I could eat, though my 50 year old eyes & the dim lighting made the menu a little hard for me to read.

With the option of several sauces -- red, green or mole, I chose mole.  Expecting rice & beans to come with it, I asked for black beans (since refried beans are normally cooked in lard) & was informed that the meals come with rice & pinto beans.  During the 15 minutes or so between our order being taken & being served, we ate about half of the chips, and all of the salsa.      There was never an effort on the staff's part to see if we'd like more of either (& yes, I would have), or if we'd liked a spicier salsa (which I would have -- what they served was good, but sweet).  Eating at a variety of Mexican restaurants pretty regularly, I was immediately surprised by the small portion of food on my plate & that of my friend.    A small quantity of Mexican rice & pinto beans were brought to us on one separate plate -- I guess we were supposed to share it, though the quantity was really just enough for one normal person.  The flavor of my food was good, and my friend loved his meal (living in the mid-west, he admitted that he can't find decent Mexican food near his home). However I left the place hungry.     I don't know how much the bill was as my friend paid it as a business expense, but the quantity of food was poor and I will avoid this place in the future, going to numerous other Mexican places in the area that are better deals.",

Unfortunately, I just wasn't that impressed.    First, nothing stood out or looked good to me on the menu.  Second, the tamarind margarita I got was cloyingly sweet where I expected it to be more sour and taste like tamarind.    Third, I didn't like the chips and salsa.  What?  I want to be buried with tortilla chips, that's how much I love them.  I mean I even like bad ones.  How could these ones not make me want to eat the whole basket?  Not sure they just were... eh.  And the salsa wasn't anything to write home about either.    All these things made me not get anything from the menu.  I just didn't want to be even more disappointed.    The service was good even though the bartender seemed a little surly.",

La Comida is it!! It's slightly off to the side in Old Downtown and you enter through what feels like a cool alley. Once in there, it was reminiscent of every Spanish speaking country I've been to- they really nailed the decor.   I'm from Texas and always appreciate good Mexican food. La Comida has great stuff for sharing, the salads are light, fresh, filling and the margaritas get the job done.   Come here for an experience that will leave you feeling relaxed and happy amidst the Vegas chaos.",

The restaurant has an authentic Mexican style and multiple depictions of santa maria de guadalupe and the saints.  Chips and salsa were brought to the table immediately as we sat down and ordered some drinks. I decided to order the al pastor tacos and the person I ate with chose the burrito con pollo. The food was quick to arrive even with the restaurant being full of festival goers.  The al pastor was tender and well marinated. The pineapple salsa on the tacos paired perfectly with the pork and every bit was delicious. The burrito con pollo was much larger than anticipated, but it was tasty as well. The burrito is covered in ranchero salsa (think tomatillo style green sauce) and was well balanced with spice and tenderness.   Service was fast and friendly which was an extra bonus for the experience during the festival. Portions are large and you definitely get what you pay for in the quality of food and the restaurant environment.",

They are all very well behaved, and no I'm not just saying that. I will say though that I felt from the get go given that we were so kid-deep, it was not a welcomed feeling from the start. Now I will mention that when I looked at Yelp, you do tout yourself as a \"kid-friendly\" place, so if you don't want them there, maybe you should amend that. Just sayin...   The ambiance is great, LOVE the look of the place overall, very funky, very cool. When we arrived there were maybe 3 people in the whole restaurant, so its not like it was so busy they didn't have room for us. The attitude of the server was just blah, didn't really make an effort to explain the menu or ask if we had questions etc. They were accommodating in making \"kid\" food, but $16 for kids enchilada plate is a bit steep IMO. The food overall was very bland and nothing exceptional. Had the chili relleno with carne asada and was so excited to try it. The relleno was ok, the carne asada had zero seasoning and added nothing to the dish. I was excited to try the guava margarita only to find out they were out of it, the passion fruit one wasn't bad. The lack luster service certainly didn't help. Again it was a Tuesday night in a not full restaurant, I would have expected at least the service to be on point.   Overall a disappointing, just meh meal and I don't think we will return.",

Very cool, laid back vibe; love the skeleton monkey neon sign out front. The bar has a cool swing chair you can sit in.  The drinks are amazing, I had the Spicy Cucumber and my friend had the Passion Fruit.  We tried the Flautas De Pollo, Carne Asada Tacos and the Fajitas. Nothing disappointed and it all tasted delicious.   Definitely a nice, quiet place right off Fremont St. to enjoy a great meal.",

    "text": "Came after visiting the container park to have a family lunch. Before we even walked in I was surprised with REALLY loud music causing our 18 month old to wake up from his nap. We were seated at a table tight by the kitchen,  I don't mind it, I don't feel like we were being picked on but the restaurant only had like 2 other tables inside and I just think we could've been seated not right by the kitchen. I had the prickly pear margarita I thought it was good, not too sweet, but yet again not great. My husband had some beer, can't recall which one. To start off we ordered a queso fundido to share.  I ordered the shrimp enchiladas, and my husband ordered a Mexican street burger. When our queso fundido arrived I got excited I love queso fundido. Love chorizo and cheese! But...NOPE. I started eating it with tortilla and I noticed that the cheese wasn't even melted. It was still not cooked. I got pretty grossed out. It didn't have that melt effect that it's supposed to have. I waited for our server to come by to inform them of this. By that time the food runner had dropped off our entrees. My enchiladas were good, not great just okay. The tomatillo sauce was a little over acidic. My husband's burger was good, but not really authentic to Mexican street burgers.. we asked the food runner to call the server. We told her about the queso fundido and how it wasn't done cooking yet. And she made it seem like we were being inconvenient. Like we were doing it on purpose. She said she would let her manager know, and SIMPLY left the dish on the table.  **I  work on the strip in the f & b industry and we all know this is the number 1 no-no, if a guest doesn't like something or its not right you take it away immediately not let it sit there in front of their faces.  And you offer to replace it with something else..   Our server did not do this. I got pretty annoyed, seriously?   So we ignored the fact that we had an uncooked dish at our table and kept eating.. by the time the manager came back to check on us we had finished our entrees,  she asked if we wanted a different appetizer.. NO I finished my entree already I don't think I want to start my dinner all over again. She then let us know she would take it off the check. She could have done so without putting it in our face.  We didn't have more than 2 bites of the dish and we are not one of those people to eat more than half of the food and then complain. -This was the first time I have ever sent any food back, EVER.   To wrap it up, food was okay.. No great customer service. Also speciality margarita prices were a little pricey, strip prices to top shelf are equal or else for a specialty drink.   I also did not appreciate the goofy food runner, acting like a 12 year old eating snacks by the side of the kitchen where we could clearly see him. Not professional at all! Not sure if the health department would appreciate this either.   Would probably not come back to dine here again with so many choices in Las Vegas, try MUNDO! That place is amazing.",

We sat down at the bar, so excited, thinking we may have found our new go to place for food & drinks. After ordering 2 different margaritas, the drinks proved themself to be \"meh\"..nothing special, on the weak side. As we were watching the female bartender pour other patrons drinks, we noticed that she not once measured the ammount of alcohol she was putting into the drinks. She just screwed the cap off, poured some in (and no not with the little silver measuring things). For the price, and the appearance of the resturant, we expected better.  Next, we ordered an appetizer. We asked the female bartender what the most common & best one was..she suggested the creamed corn. She claimed it was \"As good as crack cocaine...I just can't get enough..I eat it everyday!\"...We thought this was a weird comment to make to a customer, but whatever, its Vegas. BTW, the corn sucked.  We left after this. We might go back in a few months and see if they have replaced that bartender..haha. Like I said earlier, we really wanted to like the place.",

Maybe things have changed...I don't know.  Without reading the reviews and looking at the star factor, I committed to taking my partners out to luck on this particular visit.  This decision was solidified after talking to another buddy who states he was the first paying customer (at a discount) and said the chow was decent.  First, beware of the parking.  Meters are all around and make sure you have plenty of quarters because you during lunch you never know how long it might take to get your meal. LC was heated up during lunch time.  One of my partners said he would take care of the parking situation and little did he know just how much a task it would be.  It was quite the challenge to find change for anyone in LC during the start of lunch.  Not even the bar had change!  I will say this, it was pretty damn cool when the bartender reached into his own pocket and gave my partner seventy-five cents of his own money to assist with parking after not being able to break a twenty.  Our waiter was very nice as I think most everyone else was.. except the hostesses.    The menu looked awesome but it was configured at \"foodie\" prices.  Hoping the sizes of the chips, salsa, apps, and meals would make the pain of paying so much bearable, I was sadly mistaken.  The app was a queso dip with it's size being only large enough to satisfy a smaller person let alone three guerrillas.  The Sea Bass Tacos I ordered, though tasty were the size of those one would get from a taco street vendor in TJ.  Only those on the other side of the border were like five for a dollar.  Between the quarter/parking fiasco and the absolute \"foodie\" portions at \"foodie\" prices one might expect this type of meal further south of the strip, say past Sahara where the tourists are.  $70 dollar meal (lunch) with no booze just plain sucks.",

It was well worth the trip!  The blood orange margaritas were amazing.  The salsa had great flavor with just the right level of spice.  We also got the guacamole.  It was obvious it was freshly made. Quite yummy.  The whole menu looked great so we asked our waiter, Frank, what he recommended. He asked if we were looking for a full meal or something a bit smaller.  We said we wanted something smaller and he recommended sharing the Puerco Ahumado.  It did not disappoint. The pork shoulder came in a smokey red sauce with two plantain chips as garnish. In this way I think the menu was a bit deceptive since you could infer the plantain chips were an integral part of the entre' (maybe for dipping); they were merely garnish.  That didn't matter to us though.  The pork shoulder was served with warm tortillas (clearly made fresh).  The pork fell off the fork it was so tender and the flavor was amazing!  The service was quick and attentive.  We appreciated Frank asking what type of meal we were looking for so we didn't get too much or too little.  The decor was authentic with a Catholic bend.  They have a wall of rosaries.  Finally, my husband grew up in San Antonio, moving to the Dallas/Fort Worth area 26 years ago - he says it is the best Mexican food he has had since he left San Antonio.  If you get a chance - GO!",

    "text": "As a native Texan, I have a hard time even bringing myself to go to Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas - my palate is honed to Tex Mex, powerful salsas, reasonable prices...  I saw La Comida pop up and decided it would great to try a new place downtown that had what seemed like a relatively authentic menu and great location.  We made reservations for Saturday night and met our friends there - both of us securing rockstar parking (it was early for Saturday dinner) and a half-moon booth inside but right by the open patio.  One of our friends is Mexican and saw huarache on the menu, a childhood favorite.  We were given a mini galvanized tub of warm chips and salsa, which was plain - our friend asked the server in Spanish for the non-gringo salsa which got us a chile de arbol salsa, which was not much better.  Waters were served in mason jars which is cute.  The server did ask before we opened our menus if we wanted guacamole with our chips - my friend immediately agreed - to which we experienced dismay upon opening the menu and seeing it for $11 - and the $11 did not include a tableside guac in molcajete show - but instead a small side bowl that was not much bigger than the mini salsa container.  That was a disappointment - at least do it tableside to charge that much - what I can make for $2 with 2 avocados!  Our table's order was our friends' getting huarache and queso fundido, I ordered the ceviche trio, and Eric R. got the chicken enchiladas with mole.  He was pleased to hear it came with rice and beans.  When the food was delivered, the queso came with tortillas, and Eric got a small plate with his 2 enchiladas (topped with pickled onions), and I got a small plate (see pic) with 3 divided sections with ceviche.  My husband's sad face was attributed to the \"communal\" rice and beans, which he thought was bizarre since he was not sharing his with anyone.  The huarache had cheap meat, not like the kind our friend expected.  He was a bit disappointed.  Eric R.'s meal was cold - he had an enchilada then sent his plate and the communal beans and rice back to be reheated.  The kitchen was nice enough to give him 2 new enchiladas hot.  Of my 3 ceviches, the snapper one was tasteless (dry fish, pepper, and sliced green and red bell peppers) but the shrimp in a green sauce and the bay scallop with tropical fruit were very tasty.  Overall, it seemed just too expensive for small portions and food that was not memorable.  The only thing memorable is the rip-off guacamole that we were somewhat conned into ordering.  Our server was nice but it took awhile to get our check taken care of though it was not terribly busy at the early hour.  This place will definitely stay popular, so enjoy those $20 margaritas (not kidding) and $7 bottles of XX - no beers on tap.",

    "text": "Looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant in downtown Las Vegas? Look no further.  La Comida has arrived.    New restaurants are opening left and right in Las Vegas, especially in the downtown area.  One things for sure, La Comida is a refreshing change from your usual bar food, appetizers, and fried food.  Here at La Comida, you get authentic tasting Mexican dishes.  When you think of Morton's, their steakhouse, N9NE, Ghostbar, and Rain comes to mind.  And because this is a Morton's establishment, expect no less than quality, upscale, and great service.   My first thought upon arriving here was \"Wow\".  Although this place was packed on their very first night, we were greeted by almost every staff member.  Smiles are free and we got them.  My second thought, another \"Wow\".  Las Vegas' who's who was here tonight.  I'm not going to mention names, but the energy was surely in the air tonight.    There's seating indoors, at the bar, and at the patio outside.  The ambiance includes an attentive staff, wide open restaurant, and a ton of people watching.  Can you imagine this place on the weekend? This restaurant was extremely busy, but there's no rush once you're in and no one seems to be rushing you out.  In other words, this restaurant has a chill feel to it.  As for the food, you really can't go wrong.  Everything made here is authentic. The food was so authentic that I even had a tough time reading the menu.  But our lovely server, Camila, took the time to give us her recommendations and even gave me a short Spanish lesson. My main dish was their Carne de res a la Parrilla (beef skirt steak).  The steak is prepared to your liking on top of a bed of mushrooms and peppers.  The wild mushrooms were so good that I could eat a bowl of this stuff ala carte.  As for the steak itself, I wish I had seconds it was that juicy. Terri R had their Camaron de Golfo (buttered shrimp dish) and for dessert their Platanos Fritos (banana w/ice cream).  It's obvious that Terri loved her dish since she finished the whole thing.  Plus, she told me numerous times \"I love my food\".    It's awesome when new restaurants open in Las Vegas, specifically Downtown Las Vegas. Owners Jenna and Michael Morton open it's doors today on an invite only with an expectation to open officially mid-week.  Jenna and Michael didn't miss a beat with their soft opening.  The restaurant was fully staffed, the talent at the bar kept patrons drinks full, and the ambiance matches what us locals expect at DTLV.  Even better, they took the time to meet, greet, and take photos with everyone.  My suggestion...visit or bookmark this place for a fun and happening dining experience.

    "text": "Downtown Las Vegas has another addition with the opening of La Comida, located off of Fremont and Sixth Street.  Mel C. and I were lucky enough to attend the invite-only/soft opening with our amigo Cisco, so I will preface this review by stating that it was definitely not the typical dining experience.  It was a first for me to meet Jenna and Michael Morton, the owners of La Comida, and part of the Morton dynasty - not typical.  I think every employee of La Comida was working last night and the place was bustling with all the excitement and, most likely, nerves that accompany opening a new and much-anticipated hot spot.  There were many Las Vegas celebs and higher-ups there, but I only recognized a few.  What stood out for me was the food and the ambiance.  I had: La Catrina margarita:  \"Cabrito tequila infused with strawberries, Combier, guava and limes\"--so tasty and sweet, but not overly sweet, just the way I like my alcohol when I do drink.  I don't want to taste the alcohol. Chips and salsa:  The salsa had a little kick, but not too spicy. Guacamole:  Fresh! Camaron del Golfo:  \"Gulf shrimp, butternut squash, chorizo, cherry tomatoes, roasted corn, crema de Guajillo\"- 3 big grilled shrimp with the other ingredients as a side medley--it was delicious. Platanos Fritos:  3 fried plantains with vanilla ice cream--a sweet ending to a big meal.  It's exciting to have La Comida in DTLV, making Fremont East an even cooler place to hang out.  Word is that official opening is Thursday, April 25th, so check it out for yourselves--I will definitely be back, too.    PS - I give the neon monkey sign 5 stars alone--I want one.",

Its understandable(they were under drinking age), but they could have handled it better, I mean the place was dead no need to have a fit.  We ordered a few beers and beverages while we decided on some small things to nibble on. HE seemed really annoyed that we didnt order any food at first.

Overall, nothing about my rating changes (still 4-stars), but a quick update to my previous review:  my last visit for lunch was last week with co-workers.  Five of us went in and before any orders were placed we told our waiter we wanted separate checks (one couple, plus three individual checks).  We were told \"we're not allowed to do separate checks anymore\".  I've been to restaurants that won't allow separate checks for parties over a certain size, but we were a group of five asking for four checks.  Separate checks were never a problem in the past.  Not allowing a small group to have separate checks suggests a willingness to inconvenience the customer for the convenience of the restaurant.  I still love La Comida, but be prepared to divide the bill yourself if you go with a group.",

Being a type of food that is done often, I don't know if it was necessarily standout, but I think everything was up to expectations. I'm not a regular in the Vegas restaurant scene, but it seemed like prices were a little higher than I would have expected for what we got. Maybe that just comes along with the territory.  The menu had a lot of options without being overwhelming. They did have some things that strayed outside of what I would consider just run-of-the-mill Mexican offerings, which was nice. The place had a decent ambiance, and we were lucky to get there at a time when they could accommodate our slightly larger group without a reservation by pushing some tables together.   Our service was great, but it was a huge pain in the butt that they refused to split up the checks at the end of the night. I consider that to be a minimum expectation of what restaurants will do to accommodate guests as this point. Our server was apologetic about that being their policy, but it will definitely keep me from returning again with any sort of larger group because nothing ruins a nice dinner faster than trying to split up a bill after the meal and transfer money around.",

    "text": "I hadn't heard much about this place despite walking by it multiple times which is never really a good sign.  One day; however, my friend suggested we go there and I decided today is the day.  Let me start by saying that this place isn't bad, hence the 3 stars, it is average in my opinion.  I liked the decor on the inside and the outside and the food was also tasty.  Portions and prices could easy be raised and lowered respectively but I guess location may also factor in to that.    $39 for a Milagro flight seemed pretty ridiculous and the shots seemed rather small despite how large they look in my picture.  The three shots came with their sangrita (picture a bloody mary type shot).  Some people would love it but personally I very much disliked it and would have rather had another shot of tequila.  The elote and the al pastor tacos were quite good.  The tacos, typical street style, were small but full of flavor.  I really think these should be larger though for the price ($13).  To be fair, all of the food came with communal AYCE rice and pinto beans, although I've had far better.  I only had one bite of flan and that tasted pretty good.  La Comida isn't a bad choice and I am glad I tried it but there are better Mexican restaurants around the valley and certainly better places to eat while in the Downtown area.",

    "text": "A prickly pear margarita to take the edge off a 108 degree day was the goal! For $12, it's a solid margarita, full of flavor and served in a mason jar.  They don't have a lunch menu, which is very disappointing. It's full price all the way except for happy hour and the all day, every day $19 mimosas! I had the $10 ensalada botanica, with baby greens, avocado and queso fresco. It was a very good salad. Our table also received complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa was not very impressive, it lacked a great flavor and I expected it to be at least a little spicy.   I've had their guac, which is very tasty! The variety of margarita flavors they have is excellent! I like the guava and prickly pear the best and also tried the blood orange, which was also good but not impressive like guava!  The decor is nice for Downtown, and it's sort of upscale too. The bar area is nice, there's a cool wooden swing also by the bar.  It can be difficult to park nearby, as is to be expected Downtown, and so close to Fremont Street!",

La Comida ambiance & service:   Dining ambiance is cool as it looks like a resto straight out of the movie from Dusk til Dawn without the vampires thank goodness.  The fully stocked bar is cathedral like and there's a tree swing there for a cool social media moment. The whole resto is a cool social media moment.  Our server was very friendly and helpful with the menu.  He was excellent with keeping our unlimited mimosas going that night, yep you heard that right.  The kitchen got our dishes to us timely, with that..  La Comida cuisine:  You get free chips & salsa and we turned it up by ordering the tasty queso fundido.  The chorizo and peppers enhanced the flavor.   My hamburguesa mexicana beef was cooked (medium) perfectly as I requested. The oaxaca cheese, jalapeno bacon and avocado all worked so well together.  This is a very tasty dish and highly recommended.  The sweet potato fries were prepped perfectly and complimented the burger. The crew enjoyed their massive chicken burrito and the smoked pork shoulder.  Overall the dishes were pretty good.  They have $19 bottomless mimosas 'all day every day' and here we are firing away on a Friday night, great value.  The prices are a little on the pricier side but the ambiance and service makes up for it imo.   It's a fun dining experience and I won't probably won't wait so long until I visit again.  Cheers!",

    "text": "If I could, I'd give this spot 3.5 stars. We stopped here for a quick pre-dinner (Linner? Dunch? You decide) bite.  We were seated quickly and delighted to learn that it was happy hour! Naturally, that's a deal that can't be passed up. While settling in, we were given chips and salsa. The chips were warm--always a plus--and the salsa was pretty tasty.  I indulged in a guava margarita for the fair price of $5. It was served with a salt rim in a cute mason jar (visibly smaller than the mason jar that water is served in). The drink itself was somewhere between \"meh..\" and \"good.\" Good enough to finish, but not good enough to want another. Holding True to the happy hour menu, we ordered the nachos which were also $5. Due to the price, I didn't expect a generous portion, but I did expect more than six (literally, we counted) chips. Sure, they're well-topped, but three chips per person doesn't suffice as an appetizer. Imagine if someone else was in our party! Oh the horror!  Underwhelmed by the nachos, we ordered the queso fundido. It was the star of the meal. It was served bubbly and gooey and perfect. It's served with some mini corn tortillas, but I preferred consuming it via chip. My only gripe about this dish would be just that...the dish. It's served in a square cast iron pan, so naturally it's quite hot. There's no handle or oven mitt to help anchor it, so it slides around the plate it's served on. A bit painful on the hands, but beauty--errr, queso--is pain.",

All different kind of texture mixed together made it fun to eat. The chili cream sauce tied all the ingredients together.    -Warm tortilla chips -Spanish rice- nice and fluffy and well seasoned. -Guacamole - fresh and with a nice hint of lime. -Service was fine; refilled water and chips promptly.

The service was great. They didn't skip a beat. The food breakdown:-  ~Sangria - really good ~Guacamole - a bit too heavy on the onion, but really good consistency ~Roasted corn - delish. They cut it off the cob to make it easier for us to share ~The queso fundido - really good and soooo rich ~I had the Camaron del Golfo for my dinner. It was a bit heavy on the chili powder. I like spice, but it just was completely overpowering. Otherwise, the shrimp were cooked perfectly, though the squash was a bit underdone.

Come to find out they have a Vegan menu here too! Just ask!  Our server was not even offended when we asked for it. We did not come here for happy hour or anything, but there drink offers here are unbelievable. The food is spectacular; and healthy. That is the way to lunch!  As you take the long twist to the entrance around the side of the building finally the door to Mexican food. We were seated by a lovely waiter who took our drink order we went with Iced T and Water since we are not drinking today.  Our food order was taken by another server (did not catch her name); but she was amazing. We were not content with the menu since were looking for Vegan , mentioned to the server and brought these other \"secret menus\" so was glad for that.    The Vegan offerings are just as amazing as the regular menu; but with no alcohol. We decided to order two different plates and just share. So we had the Queso Fundido and Queso Fresno Tacos.  For our food being Vegan it sure did not taste that way. The chefs here bring the talent with the spice and presentation of their food. When the server brought it too the table it was still sizzling; plus it looked like art on a plate. Love when my food is presented in such a fashion.  The Queso Fundido was amazing the cheese sizzling as you stick the fork into the pan to put on the plate. And the taste we ordered another if that states how well this tasted! Enough said huh!  The Queso Fresno Tacos were amazing too but not the same as the cheese plate. Cheese in my book solves a lot of life issues. Let just be happy and eat cheese. It works for the French! Onto the tacos then. They came in a pair; perfect for sharing among friends. And we both enjoyed the coleslaw on top of the tacos. The rice and beans that came on the side with the tacos was spiced properly and something we enjoyed at home.  After paying the check we took the rest of lunch back to her office and did the spa thing; with left over Mexican food. I will return here real soon; and you should too! Mexican food with beautiful art presentation. One does not need a reason to eat Mexican food it's good all the time!",

Not authentic. The bar on the other hand is cute and there is a swing. Not coming back here. Shame too cause my friend said it was great a few years ago. Must have changed owners. The beans and rice taste just like the ones you buy at Cardenas. The bill came and they charged for the salsa they brought to the table with the chips that they place in front of you when you sit down. I hat a waste of time.",

The queso fondue basically went back to a solid pile of cheese in less then 2 minutes. The shrimp tacos were very small.

    "text": "La Comida is located in the El Cortez' old laundry facility space on 6th Street, just around the corner from a majority of the foot traffic in the area, so those that don't know of its presence may miss it altogether. But if you happen to venture around the corner, you'll quickly see their funky neon skeleton monkey sign hanging from the top of the parapet. There's a small patio outside with a handful of tables, a rustic bar with maybe 14 seats, and a number of different sized tables offering the combination of various dining groups. The space is open to the wood framed roof above, with lots of reclaimed wood decorative items, stained glass, and a huge tequila selection behind the bar. It's a pretty cool interior, and definitely fits with the theme of the menu. And speaking of the menu, it doesn't seem to be available anywhere online yet but features some great sounding items like mesquite-smoked pork shoulder with avocado sauce and plantain chips, beef skirt steak with wild mushroom and oven-roasted poblano peppers, tacos and plenty more. There is also quite the list of specialty margaritas to work your way through.  As usual I'm here for one thing; in this case it is called the Hamburguesa Mexicana and comes with ancho chiles, avocado, Oaxaca cheese and sweet potato fries. Upon first bite I instantly noticed how fantastic the bun was, and it instantly made me think of Bachi's. Could it be the same supplier? The next thing I noticed was the great chorizo flavor mixed in with the ancho chiles that I wasn't expecting based on the description, but it was a very welcome surprise. The patty meat had good flavor, but I question its quality based on your only two options for cooking temperature: medium or well. Without hesitation I went with medium, but it was cooked a bit beyond that in this case. Still, it wasn't too dry, and the combination of guac, chorizo and ancho chiles made for some really great flavors. The Oaxaca cheese was flavorful, melted well and even had some nice brown to it from the cooking temps. Overall this burger was a surprising success.  The sweet potato fries were also great; sweet and cooked very well. They came out seasoned with just a bit of salt and were a nice companion to the flavors of the burger. At $14 I wish it was a tiny bit cheaper, but if you compare it to another burger in close proximity that wasn't nearly as good at $12, this isn't so bad. I think the prices of everything on the menu are a few dollars too high and portions a bit small, as I've been back a couple more times to try some of their other signature dishes. The food is really good, although they should look into alternates for their soft taco shells as theirs have fallen apart on me a bit too easily on both visits. Either way this is a really fun restaurant, and a great addition to the East Fremont area. The entire staff is very attentive and has treated us well every time we've gone in there so far; definitely check this place out if you're in the area looking for a good burger, good Mexican meal or just a fun scene.",

Hi, let me preface this by saying there are a lot of things I truly enjoy about your restaurant. The margaritas are divine, the chips and salsa are incredible and the service exquisite. I had eaten here once already and couldn't wait to come back. A friend of mine had informed me of a certain hairy situation that occurred while she was eating here. Despite this, I wanted more of your delicious tacos. I came in Saturday night and had the carnitas tacos with rice and beans on the side. Everything tasted great and there was no incident, until a few hours later when I got home. That's when the fever, chills and vomiting began. The next 24 hours was basically the worst ever. I deducted I became ill as a result of your food, simply by the fact that I ate no where else in the hours leading up to or following my visit. I am not writing on your wall to receive anything for free or to cause a stir, there just isn't any other form of contact I can find. I only ask that you and your team review your cleanliness, preparation and food safety procedures so this does not happen to other diners. I will most likely return for drinks, but definitely won't be eating here again.",

The portions aren't out of control and I always feel like I got an excellent value for what I've paid. Every single thing I've had here was well prepared and excellent. I hope that people support this business because its so difficult to find a decent neighborhood restaurant in Vegas and the staff is phenomenal. The only thing I didn't like was the folding chairs. Even though they are pretty I don't like sitting in them. Lucky for me I haven't had to yet. I always get a booth. Can't wait until I can sit outside!",

Drinks: I didn't have a margarita, so I can't speak for them myself, but the bartenders definitely seemed to know what they're doing and they come in an adorable mason jar.  Downsides: Make a reservation! We didn't and it was packed. We had to belly-up at the bar. Also, I don't know if they have AC or not. Fans were going, but it was still really warm. Otherwise, great atmosphere.",

    "text": "La Comida is the New Las Vegas on Fremont Street East!    Top notch service and a modern, urban huntsman design meets Mexico City's \"La Condesa/La Roma\" district decor greet the hungry diner upon entering this oasis of cool.  Buttery green tufted leather Chesterfield style banquettes line one section of La Comida, allowing patrons VIP people watching privileges while tailored rough hewn wooden dining tables dot the center of the dining hall.  Every detail in the design of La Comida has been considered and will not disappoint, including the stained glass cathedral windows that make up the presentation of the bar.  The service, starting with the reception desk and all of the restaurant team that we encountered, were La Comida's biggest and most impressive asset, what an incredible crew that has been assembled for this venture.  While decor and service are important, we had come in to enjoy a nice Cinco de Mayo Mexican food feast and for the most part, we were not disappointed.  While there were some dishes that were spot on, we found others that needed a little more refinement.  The chicken burrito, while chock full of tender pieces of shredded chicken, was overwhelmed by a spicy green chili sauce.  Others in our party of three enjoyed their tacos, guacamole, cocktails, real Mexican Coke and other specialties.  There has been some mention of the costs at La Comida, however, as an overall package - the food, fun, service and decor, it was well worth the expense.   Thank you to the owners, management and the overall team for bringing the fiesta back to downtown.",

    "text": "Geez... I will most likely never return to La Comida. Food was ok, drinks were alright but the lack of service is what really ruined the experience. We've only been here once before during their early months of opening and it was an ok experience. We went for a Sunday brunch, so the menu was smaller. I thought the food was good, but nothing that stood out making me want to return.   It was a Friday night and I wanted to try a new restaurant that had just opened around the corner, Carson Kitchen, but seeing as it was a Friday night around 8pm, there was an hour and a half wait, so we decided to try Carson Kitchen another night and eat somewhere else near that, leading us to La Comida.   My party of 4 were sat at a table next to the bar, squeezed between other large parties. Servers bringing the complimentary chips and salsa came shortly after while we decided on drinks. We all ordered margaritas, which took a bit to arrive but whatev, it was Friday and the bar was busy. We had finished both baskets of chips and salsa before the waiter had returned to take our dinner order. Luckily I ordered the elotes asados (mexican street corn) to start (which was pretty darn delicious) so that held us over until our entrees came. When they finally did come, I had ordered the Sea Bass Frito a la Baja (primarily cabbage stuffed tacos with a little fried fish inside), my boyfriend got the Fajitas (pretty much a plate of steak on top of peppers and onions with tortillas, no toppings! wtf?). My mom had ordered the Enchilada de Pollo dish that was a mole enchilada, which she enjoyed, and my dad the Camaron del Golfo. He said that it was good, but a small portion. I will say though, he's a big guy so almost every dish is a small portion. We had finished everything.  We thought about possibly getting dessert since we were still hungry, but our waiter had not returned through the entire corse of the meal. No check up, no asking for another drink order, nothing. We had waited, irritated, for so long, that our dessert appetite was lost and I was ready to walk out without paying the bill, but we didn't. I had kept an eye out for our server, but he seemed to always walk on the other side of the restaurant and not even look in the direction of us. I finally had to ask a bus boy to grab our check so we could get the heck out of there.  After the bill was paid, we left, and I decided that I will most likely not return. In a town full of great Mexican food and attentive service, this place needs to take a few lessons. I think the only good things they've got going for them is being Downtown and having trendy decor.",

I had fajita's as that's a norm for me at a lot of Mexican restaurants and they were ok, I forgot to ask for my meat well done but they had no issue taking it back when it was way to red for me to eat.  Don't know that we'll be back, but the bar area or a place to come hang out with some friends might lure us back in.

If the plantains were sweeter it would have balanced out the  saltiness of the ceviche. Maybe they were going for a sweet and salty kind of a thing but they definitely missed the mark. My husband ordered the fajitas. I tried a bite so I could taste them, and it was very good. The chicken had a very smokey flavor to it and the vegetables were not over sauteed and still retained their crispness. The tortillas were corn or a mixture of corn and flour.  I would have preferred all flour. And for dessert we got the Tres Leches cake which was one of the better Tres Leches cake I have had.  It wasn't too soggy and just dusted with a light layer of cinnamon.",

Being noticed by a server wasn't as quick though.  After almost 10 minutes we were noticed and asked what we wanted to drink.  I asked for one of their specialty drinks that was supposed to have blueberries in it, but was given a mojito.  My husband asked for a Corona Light, but was given a Corona. No big deal, I like mojitos too.  Next we ordered chicken enchiladas and a chicken burrito.  The enchiladas were under-temp and the mole was a little too sweet.  The burrito was spicy and good, but looked exactly like one you can get from Chipotle.  As for the beans and rice, they don't come close to authentic Mexican rice and beans... they were almost insulting.  Overall, we had fun and it's in a nice location and it has a fun atmosphere.  Just don't expect to be impressed with the food.  Pros: Chips and salsa, not overpriced, bartender was making free mini margaritas.  Cons: Food was just OK, waitstaff is nice and professional just not very attentive.  Music: loud rock music blaring from overhead speakers",

    "text": "I absolutely love this restaurant. I have been to this restaurant on many occasions and I absolutely loved the service because of the waiters and waitresses that waited on me. The atmosphere is great the music is great the food is great. However, this particular waiter waited on my friend and myself on a Sunday afternoon. We were in a fantastic mood until we laid eyes on him.  We suddenly was not hungry anymore due to the fact that he had an utterly disgustingly  look on his face  as if he was disgusted that he did not want to be at work. It appeared to us that he obviously hated his job and did not want to be there. This waiter name is Frank. Whatever you do Frank is not the person you want to wait on you at La Comida restaurant. As a customer I did not feel as if this is somewhere I wanted to  have Sunday evening dinner with my friend. His attitude was despicable and abnoctious. Even though the environment and the music was great this was not somewhere we needed to sit and allow someone to wait on us who will be serving us our food. Overall this was a really bad experience I will go back to this restaurant but if I see this face again I will turn right back around and go home or go to another restaurant. My one star is not for the restaurant overall my one star is for the waiter and the reason why there is a star is because I could not post unless I have a star.",

When I told him we were not ready to order yet and if we could get some more chips, he scuffed and grabbed the basket and said I will get you chips, then brings back a basket full of broken up little pieces of chips not one solid chip.  Then I get the nachos and it's 4 chips with beans, cheese, gauc. And chicken($14).  My daughters ordered the Mexican burger and it was so salty my kids wouldn't even finish it.  I ordered the chicken enchiladas they were very good and the guacamole was fresh.  I enjoyed the atmosphere and the decorations, but turned off by the waiters attitude from the get go.

    "text": "Cool decor/vibe. Like all restaurants in this area, they've renovated an old building downtown. It has been made to feel like a seedy Mexican cantina where you might hire someone to kill your boss, while at the same time being a cozy little bar you would feel comfortable taking your mother to. We tried the mole chicken enchiladas, and the shrimp tacos. I typically find mole to be too sweet and rich, but the chicken was so flavorful that the mole wasn't overpowering and created a nice balance. The shrimp is VERY lightly battered and served in small corn tortillas with small pieces of mango and a jalapeno crema. Typically mango served in tacos is huge chunks and creates too much juice, and/or they just fall out. These are more like mango \"shavings\", which made the tacos much more enjoyable. I'll come back for sure. Good, upscale Mexican food.",

    "text": "Called and made reservations for a large group so they knew what to expect. And by large I mean only 14 people. Apparently any more than two people in a group and the waiters don't know what to do with themselves. The food was extremely over priced for the small portions that you get and I've tasted better meals at Taco Bell then what they were serving. All the food was either over cooked or under cooked. My wife got the fajitas and it ended up making her sick, and when we told the waiter and tried to send it back we got the biggest attitude from him and the staff. Never one apology. Also make sure you know exactly what you order in a group because they refuse to split bills, and will give you an attitude of inconvenience if you ask. Also make sure you stay away from the guy with the ridiculous mustache. If you decide to rock an idiotic mustache on your face that you normally don't see every day then you'd expect to get some comments, however if you tell this waiter \"hey cool mustache!\" Prepare for the worst service! He rolls his eyes and you get a sarcastic, arrogant, as*ho** the rest of the night. Another issue is outside seating. Be prepared to be hounded by the endless homeless people asking you for money while you eat. If I could give negative stars I would. It was a very cool hipster vibe but if you want better Mexican food there are better options for your time and money downtown.",

For those complaining about the gentrification of the area, I guess they'd be happier with another empty lot or weekly rent apartment complex? Aside from that, I thought the food, service, and atmosphere at La Comida were all top-notch. The owner (same owner/chef/developer as the restaurants in the Palms) obviously put a lot of thought and time into the design of the space, with some exposed brick/wallpaper walls, rustic-y furniture, a marquee over the bar, and a small patio. It's a livelier atmosphere, even at lunch, with fairly loud music playing throughout.  Our waiter was friendly, prompt, and helpful, explaining to us that the menu item 'huarache' is actually a tostada of some sort in the shape of a huarache. Weird, but cute. We ate the pork tacos and the red snapper tacos. Both were very good.  Chips and salsa were good, but nothing special. The margarita/tequila list looked great, but we weren't imbibing on this day, so we'll have to return to check out the nightlife. Minus one star for high prices ($12-13 for 3 street tacos...extra $3 for special salsa!)",

The food was delicious and best of all it tasted authentic Mexican food. And to put the icing on the cake, Chef Mario Garcia came out and introduce himself and asked how was the food. He started to talk to us like a friend. You can tell he loves what he does and he wants to make sure everyone knows. We talked to the Chef for quite a bit and to add more wonderfulness he had one of the Cook's prepared us a delicious Flan . It was to die for. The flan was very creamy, rich and delicious. Now that's what you call exceptional, excellent customer service. Restaurants of Las Vegas you could learn from Chef Mario. He was humble, passionate and dedicated to what he believes in giving excellent customer service and only making exceptional food. Everyone should definitely try this place.",

I asked the wife if she would like to try the restaurant, and off we went. That was the best damn food choice we made, we went back two more times before we came back to SD. Jonny was our bartender, very friendly and attentive to our drink needs. Every drink we ordered was made and mixed to perfection, I was impressed, and that is not easily done since I am in the food and drink industry.  Now about the food, first time we ordered we played it safe, (we are a long way from home if you know what I mean) we had the carne asada salad and the carnitas tacos, lets just say \"WOW!!!\" the flavors were amazing and worked very well together' the meats were tender and moist and every bite was better then the last. about that time the manager (Rafael) came over to check on us, I said everything was awesome. he asked what we had and then suggested next time be more adventurous, and asked if next time we come in if he could order for us. I told him tomorrow he would have that opportunity. the next evening we were back, greeted by a very friendly hostess and Rafael, who asked if we like pork and chicken. We were seated in about 30 sec. drink orders taken, chips and salsa on the table. don't get me started on the chips... (3 bowls).  soon after that our food arrived, WTF??? I never got a menu, Rafael said he ordered for us. we had the Puerco Ahumado and Chicken Al Horno. This was truly Mexican food at it's best. I could not believe the flavors that these dishes had. Everything was above excellent, all the staff awesome, the chefs are amazing and talented. Thank you La Comida for being part of our awesome vacation. We will be back again and again.",

Looked interesting, great ambience, outside dining, cool bar.. we thought we'd give it a try.. The waiter was really unfriendly. I don't think he smiled once. He always seemed to be in a rush when he came by, but the place only had 3 tables sat. hardly a rush. After ordering drinks, we ordered our meals.. we all had different types of tacos and one had a skirt steak type of dish. All of the food was flavorful, the nachos were a little disappointing, as there were only four in an order..Hardly the nachos I had hoped for. The prices are very reasonable and the music they played was awesome.. I would say that outside of the unfriendly wait staff, I would probably go back.. if the second visit the waiter or waitress is the same, unfriendly, and no smile, I would not return. There are too many good restaurants in Las Vegas to put up with unfriendly employees..",

I really loved everything about this place but the food. The interior has an old world feel about it. One of my partners in crime said \" boy, they sure spent a lot of money to make this place look old\". The feel of the room is well appointed with oldish Mexican decorations and art. Nice job on the leather covered plastic lawn furniture I suppose. The music mix crosses musical genres, it's hip without being trendy even mashing some Hispanic influenced sounds with more predominately English sounds. I see mixed reviews with the service, we were very well taken care of on that front. Servers were excellent! Chips were decent and plentiful, salsa, while offering some complexity, sorely lacked heat. I was there with 2 other friends, got to sample their dishes as well as mine. Everything, and I mean everything was just OK. 8 bucks for an ear of street corn, kind of left me with the feeling of being corn cob fucked in the culo...and that was my favorite item of the day. $5+ dollars for a street taco..a bland one at that.  REALLY? One friend got some kind of (1/2 or 1/4 chicken dish that was nice...AND bland.  Listen, I don't mind dropping mas pesos for a meal, but if your not rockin' my world, then I won't be returning to yours.  At this price point, and only 1 short mile away, lies the delectable Mexican delights that is Mundo. A mile away in distance, but a world a part in flavor. Yes the name of this place is La Comida...and yes they DO have that--food. There are Wayyyyy too many REALLY GOOD Mexican mom and pop choices close by for me to waste my time here. I suspect La Comida will be a success. Plenty of folks are perfectly happy with dumbed downed Mexican fare in a well done atmosphere with $20 Margaritas. If just wanting food, I would rather walk 7 minutes to grab the excellent $1.50 pork on a spit street tacos from the little stand at LVB and Bonanza. See ya La Comida.",

    "text": "If I could give 4.2 stars I would. Why? The food has always been good when I've paid La Comida a visit. The first time I went I had the fajitas. They give you a lot - you'll definitely leave full with leftovers. Extremely flavorful as well. The second time I got the carnitas tacos. You get 3, they're kinda small but surprisingly filling. Very simple - just meet, salsa fresca and onions, but again, extremely flavorful.   The aesthetics of the restaurant is on point if you're into that \"mix-match\", sugar skull, mason jar kinda look. Personally, I love it. Its got a very warm feeling to it.  The only downfall? The service is HORRIBLE. Ironically, I was reading reviews of this place before my boyfriend and I went last night and once we were seated I brought up how surprised I was regarding the reviews. Well, they kept True. Took us about 15 minutes to get our drinks, about 15 after that for someone to come take our order. You can imagine how the rest of the night went. The waitress was not the friendliest gal around either.  Bottom line, love the aesthetics. Love the food. I'll go back but they need to hire new staff.",

We ordered 2 chicken faitias and while the food was very tasty the portions were a joke for $17 You get 3 tortillas and you could barely make 2 tiny ones.  Then they give you one smallish plate of rice and beans to split. So If I ordered one faitia dish I would get one plate of rice and beans but you still only get one small plate when you order two faitia dishes. Come on... give people what they paid for. Each dish should have it's own plate of rice and beans. Especially for $17.  Seriously it must have cost them no more than $2 for my $17 dish.   My niece ordered a salad for $10 and chicken with it for an additional $3 and her plate had at least 3 times the amount of chicken than one faitia dish.  I left hungry. Not cool. Sorry LA Comida your food tastes good and the place has a nice atmosphere but get your act together with the portions. Can't say I'll be back to over pay for my dinner and still be hungry.",

Not much meat for what you pay for. One person ordered the enchilada de pollo. He was kind of thrown off by the sweetness from the mole on top of it but really enjoyed it.   The server was just okay. He did his job but just wasn't very personable. I loved the decor and the vibe of the restaurant.",

Maybe my prayers for good food and good service were answered because the carnitas tacos ($11) were surprisingly good. Using diced up morsels of pork instead of pulled pork, the flavors were excellent and I loved the crispy edges that gave it some textural contrast. Margaritas were as good as expected and the flan de caramelo ($6) was a little too firm, but still smooth and velvety with a crystallized sugary top like a creme brulee.",

I am Mexican and I know what great Mexican food taste like from Growing up in Los Angeles, CA and traveling to Mexico.   This restaurant, I don't know honestly. It didn't meet my expectations. I was actually expecting more and it was a disappointment. First, my date and I ordered the Albondigas and the waiter wasn't paying attention and spilled the sauce on the table (annoying). It got on my shoes and my dates wallet and phone.   My date ordered this chicken dish that had chipotle sauce and it came in a nice presentation. After he had a taste, he asked me to try it and ask if it was suppose to taste like that. The taste of the dish was so flavorless. Think of it as the sauce and the chicken having no flavor. The chicken was over cooked and dry.   We did ask the manager to try something different because we were dissatisfied and he recommended a pork dish that had plantain chips. He brought us samples of the pork to taste and it was very good.  I ordered some street tacos Al Pastor and they were okay. It didn't make me want to have more after the first taco (3 come with the order).    I would say the service was great. They did go above and beyond to ensure we were happy. The food in the other hand was a 4 from a scale  from 1-10 (10 being amazing).   The drinks are good. I had a Paloma and it was delish!   I would recommend this place is you don't care if Mexican food should taste like Mexican food and you just want to eat. I do want to give credit that the service was great.",

And the freshest margaritas with the most intense flavors you're sure to taste in this town, and food. It has glorious food.   Stopped in on my way to somewhere else, was actually taking advantage of the valet parking that is oh so convenient, when I decided to stop in here to not seem like a cheater (valet requires you to eat here). I'm glad I'm honest.   Sat down and was greeted by a pretty girl in a cute outfit who really knows her way around a bar. Inquired about all the tasty margaritas and she explained which was tart, which was sweet, mellow, etc. Super helpful stuff there. Also threw some chips and salsa in front of me that alerted the tasted buds that delicious stuff was on the way. Thanks for the heads up, sexy, salty chips!  I ended up with two different margaritas. The first was a passion fruit margarita, which was fine, don't get me wrong, but it was nothing like the next one I had. Whew. Was talking to Michelle, I think that was her name, and she recommended I try the verano de jalisco. I am a huge fan of cilantro and added to this drink it made it fresh and delicious. The unusual salt (can't remember the name) around the rim just made it all the better. Do these!  I then had a side of elotes asados and it was sooooo freaking good. The plate was piled so high I couldn't eat it all. I should have eaten it all because now I want some and I realized how much I wasted. Regret.  But, the great news is, I can go and get some more anytime I want!  So, that's all I had there, but just what I had left me drooling for more. The ambiance, the drinks, the food, they all make for one of the best, most happening places to hit Fremont in awhile!",

Chef Mario Garcia knows his stuff! Everything had a depth of flavor, no one note dishes here. This food is marinated, cooked slowly and prepared with love. We also had the Prickly Pear Margaritas and they were equally as amazing as our first one. To end or dining experience, Chef Garcia served us his Tres Leches cake. Phenomenal!

The ham in my boyfriends torta was the only thing we found that was off.",

My major critique here is that the focus seems to be on making the food 'interesting' instead of simply 'good'.   Don't get me wrong, I applaud culinary creativity, and some of the fixings offered a nice touch to some of the dishes, but it's just not what you think of when imagine \"going out for Mexican food\". And worse, you have to eat all your chips and salsa to get full because the plates are a little small-ish.  The tequila menu is very nice. As I mentioned, this a great spot for drinks, but the food is not the highlight of La Comida.",

    "text": "Finally a good decent Mexican spot near East Fremont!  We decided to stop by La Comida as it was one of the few places that allow underage diners after 8pm on East Fremont. SMH @ The Park on Fremont!  I had a great experience here at one of the Yelp Elite events earlier this year and wanted to see what the place was like without the VIP treatment.   To begin the restaurant is pretty unique in it's design and decor. What used to previously be a laundromat has been transformed into a chic cantina style Mexican eatery with plenty of Catholic influences. The bathrooms are gender separated by pictures of Mary and Jesus while rosaries hang from the light fixtures. I wonder if anyone ever gets offended by it?  The menu is little different than most Mexican restaurants. No combo plates or nachos here, instead you find an eclectic spin on some of your south of the border dishes. The menu isn't huge but everyone should find something that they like. I ordered the Mexican burger with sweet potato fries. The fries were delicious and the burger, complete with ancho chilies and jalapeno bacon, was pretty unique. Word of caution: all of our burgers were served very rare - specify to your server if you want it cooked longer. My cousin ordered the enchiladas which would have been great if not ruined by the heavy serving of mole sauce all over them. La Comida serves unlimited family style rice and beans with their entrees for everyone at the table to share.   Service was great. Our server was very friendly, on top of refills, and very knowledgeable about the menu. It was nice to see the manager out on the dining floor interacting with diners as well.   You can tell La Comida specializes in margaritas from their massive tequila selection. Extra props for serving up these concoctions in a mason jar!  The walk-up window by the outdoor porch and the giant wooden swing by the bar are a nice touch,  If you are looking for some good Mexican fare give this place a shot. You at least get free chips and salsa!",

    "text": "Went here on a friday night after a very bad experience at a previous spot so are expectations wernt hi just based on the night this place had the opportunity to knock are sox off. We came in got sat rite away host was kind. Busser brought us water and chips and salsa didn't say much but could tell he did his job well he also prebussed the table for us. Are server came got our drinks I asked for recommendations he gave a few me and my wife went for two of the four he offered. Food runner brought our food said he would be back with the tortillas I ordered and was told they were extra by the server and then told they came with the meal by the runner.. The food was not bad but not rememberable you know that food that you say im comeing back for this tortillas are out of a bag just nothing special to me maybe it just wasn't authentic enough for me my opinion yours may be different. I asked next what they had for dessert and me and my wife decided on the trece leches cake that was a good moist piece of cake like it should be. Now for the bill well I understand confusion and this may have been the case we we're charged for the tortillas that we were told we were going to be charged for and thats fine however after I was told they came with the meal by the runner I asked the server he said oh I forgot that meal does come with them. Ok perfect he fixed the bill and this is why you get four stars because no matter how many times you fix the issue there are other times where you just simply dont get caught doing things like this and thats unsettling as a patron hopefully I get the opportunity to give this spot a second chance and feel better about what happened any how good luck",

We came around 8:15 on a Saturday night and were told it would be about 1 hour and 20 min wait, so we left. About 15 min later I called back and was told it would be about 30 min so I put my name down and went for a drink with my bf and mom. Upon arriving we were sat and our server was friendly but a little too flirty for my liking. I get it, you're a server and want a good tip but she should learn to talk to the rest of the table. It's disrespectful and unprofessional to focus your attention on the hot guy of the table, which happened to be MY BOYFRIEND! Anyway, the food was good and different but I loved my shrimp tacos! The manager was very nice and he actually looked like he enjoyed his job, not like many managers you see on the strip. I would definitely come back. :)",

    "text": "The only good things about La Comida were our amazing server and the cozy atmosphere.   La Comida is the quintessential tourist trap that's ironically located in a not-so-touristy, local hot spot area of downtown Vegas.  I had been dying to try this place, even after reading all of the crappy reviews, because I'm optimistic and I'm not overly critical of new restaurants. I know what it's like to be on the other side, have an \"off\" day, etc.   I don't want to get into all of the things that are wrong with La Comida because other Yelpers have done a good job of summing it up. My experience can be pinned down to the same experience everyone else seems to have - extremely small servings, high prices, watered down drinks and lack of flavor.  I love Mexican food. LOVE. And it's really hard to disappoint me. I've had great meals and average meals at so many different Mexican restaurants in Vegas.  So, I am not expecting 5 star quality food or the best meal of my life.  But, I am expecting decent flavor - especially if I'm paying $15 for two tiny tacos and the smallest plate of rice and beans brought to a table of 4 to SHARE.   La Comida has a lot of potential - if management would pay attention to the reviews and make some changes in the kitchen -  I think it could be very successful.",

Our friends who had been there before had different experiences, so we weren't quite sure what to expect. Luckily, it turned out to be a great idea to visit La Comida.   First of all the interior is really cool, with the big bar and the high ceilings and open room. The booths next to the end walls are nice to sit in, but the tables in the middle are fine too.   As per usual the chips and salsa was complimentary, and it was very mouthwatering. Since it was our first time at La Comida, we asked our friendly waiter (sporting an awesome beard) what he recommended. He suggested the Puerco Ahumado (mesquite smoked pork shoulder) and Camaron Del Golfo (Gulf shrimp and butternut squash), and neither of them disappointed us.  La Comida also has a great selection of tequilas, and a wide range of different Margaritas. In other words a great place to start the night if you're planning on going out Downtown - or for a nice date night.",

They are definitely proud of their mediocre food, judging by the over inflated prices and small portions....VERY small portions for the price.  Service took forever to come take our order. Actually we were on the verge of leaving when she actually showed up. It was fairly busy, but not that busy! This place probably falls apart when it's really crowded, I imagine. The waitress was cute and nice but really wanted to be elsewhere and it showed. Her infrequent visits just screamed for a measly tip! We accommodated!  I would not recommend this place...maybe for the drinks?! Just like most places in and around Freemont Street a tourist trap! Welcome to the Freemont Experience!",

Ask for their habanero salsa which tastes great and lights you the F up. I had the carne asada tacos and they were fantastic. The shrimp tacos looked amazing as well. I would whole-heartedly recommend this place to anyone who is alive and likes food.",

The corn had this sour cream , mayo, lime that didn't taste like the traditional Mexican  street corn I've had before. It was sour and inedible. We sent it back. Our server was great and attentive. My rating is mainly based on the food taste. I'm from California so I just have high expectations for  Mexican food. FYI.. Pinches Tacos is Wayy better in terms of authentic taste.",

I am surprised by the fact that it only gets 3 1/2 stars because it is a really good restaurant. To begin with, the service is very friendly and very fast. The margaritas, especially the guava margaritas, are incredible. The shrimp tacos are definitely my favorite item on the menu. The flautas are very good. The guacamole here is made fresh and is absolutely delicious. What I really like about this place is that not only is the food really good, but it is served in small portion sizes that actually fill you up pretty quickly. This allows you to only order one or two plates per person and be able to share it with the table. If you are looking for a laid-back place, with lots of fun and great food to eat, this is the place to come to. Easily five stars all around and I will definitely be going back.",

    "text": "My friend and I went in here on a Sunday afternoon to get some margaritas, which did not disappoint.  Unfortunately, they were only serving food off of the brunch menu and they closed at 5pm. I ordered a tamarind margarita because I don't like to stray too far from just a plain old cadillac and most of the other margaritas seemed fruity.  The tamarind margarita was so good!  It had just a little hint of spice but was very refreshing.  After two of those, I was good to go.  My friend ordered the pomegranite margarita, which I found too sweet, but it wasn't bad.    We also ordered the shrimp ceviche.  When it came out, it looked questionable as it was completely green.  Like ninja turtle green. There was not one other color in that dish.  Anyway, upon my first bite, I realized its appearance was deceiving as it was bursting with flavor.  The green had to have been cilantro, and it surprisingly wasn't overpowering at all.  There was a wonderful balance of spiciness, cilantro, lime and extremely fresh-tasting shrimp.  I was very pleased.  The service was good too.  We sat at the bar so we got to chat with the bartender and barback a little bit.  They were both very friendly and helpful.  Can't wait to go back and try food off the real menu.  Be warned though, it is VERY expensive.  4 margaritas (okay, I admit!! They were double-shot margaritas!!!) and an order of shrimp ceviche came to about $80.",

    "text": "Food was alright I would go back just get something maybe it'll change my mind. It was my server that made my experience not great. I've been there before with my family and it great. Reason why I went back. This time I was disappointed.   I have IndiCard which is a discounted app for people in Vegas who work in the industry. For this particular restaurant the deal was \"50% of margaritas and $5 beer bottle or draft.\"  After we finished eating we wanted drinks. We tell Sergio which drinks we want (Sergio my waiter) and he walked away before I could even tell him about my IndiCard. He comes back with my drinks, again walks away before I could even say \"I have a question.\" He comes back and asks if we were done and I say yes and I finally asked him about my IndiCard.   He says I was suppose to say I have IndiCard before I order drinks. I've used IndiCard before and I've never had a problem with showing it last before I pay. This time it was a problem. He said there was nothing he can do to add my discount that if I would of showed he would type in some key that would automatically add the discount.  I'm assuming the manager or owner was there that night and I wanted to speak with him but I didn't wanna be a total ass crying about $7 worth of a discount really. But then again if he would of stopped walking away every time I tried speaking to him this situation would of never happened.   Working in the industry I know you can void things out and do it all over again. I also know it's a hassle but if a customer is unhappy or has a way of saving money you help them. Even if it's a pain. Because if you don't you get Yelp reviews like this. Sorry Sergio.",

A couple Vegas residents proposed this place in between nights of meals at Carnevino and Raku and my skepticism at a downtown Vegas Mexican joint began melting away right as we entered the first courtyard leading in.    The building/decor is spot on.  Perfect.  Ambience is top notch.  Outdoor seating, casual yet sophisticated take on traditional Mexican flavors.  Good drink list heavy on tequila and the jefe margarita was the best I've ever had.  Ordered the guacamole, which was chunky, flavorful and one of the best iterations I've had.  Queso fundido was a winner as well although if you're torn between the two - go guac.  Had the gambas (shrimp) on an intensely flavorful bed of squash, chorizo and tomatoes which had everything I want in a dish.  Shrimp were perfectly cooked.  Also sampled the tuna tostada which, while quite good, could have stood for a little more seasoning.  Service was friendly but slow.  All told, I felt a strong connection with downtown Vegas in general (check out the container park - hours of drinking fun) and this is a fantastic alternative to the glitz and glamour of the strip, with relatively subdued pricing to match.",

The interior is actually pretty spacious and it looks like they might have patio dining on nice days. They have a dia de los muertos theme, culmanating in a large dia de los muerto displace above the restaurant.   I ordered the fish tacos and my friend ordered the pork shoulder. The fish tacos were good, but it didn't stand out as being particularly memorable. They were really generous with the pork shoulder serving. It was enough for a meal and then some, or for a very hungry person. The pork was fork-tender, but the sauce wasn't as flavorful as we had hoped...My friend also ordered a blood-orange margarita. It was a bit on the sweeter side, and didn't feel very strong at all.   The servers were pretty friendly. My friend wanted an extra tortilla for the pork shoulder (it came with 3 tortillas, which was definitely not enough for the large amounts of pork shoulder it came with). My friend only wanted ONE tortilla -- there was only enough pork shoulder to fill one tortilla, and he didn't want to waste if they brought out the standard 3 tortillas. The server completely understood and brought out a single tortilla.",

I appreciate the cleanliness, the environment and I have always had a good experience with the staff.   To be perfectly honest, the last time we went, we chose La Comida because our first choice for dinner had too long of a wait time. You can look at it as though we settled or you can look at it as us choosing it because we knew it was a safe bet that it would be a solid meal.  Our waiter was hilarious and engaging and the food was very timely. I chose the breaded shrimp tacos (Camaron Al Maya) and didn't regret it. I'm a wuss when it comes to spice, so the jalapeno cream was just the right amount of \"kick\" - any more and it would have been too much (for me). Their appetizer, queso fundido is a group favorite of ours, alongside the guacamole and the street corn.   Overall a solid experience and a safe bet when choosing a place to eat.",

They have a beautiful bar and a spacious indoor seating area that floods with light and opens into a outdoor seating area.  Food was good, margaritas hit the spot, and service was on point. I recommend the enchiladas with mole sauce and the grilled corn smothered in mayo, lime, butter, and chili powder.",

Place was empty but were told we would have a 30 minute wait. We agreed to wait at the bar for 15 minutes (and have a drink) then decide how long we would be able to wait. Well, 10 minutes after hitting the bar we were told our table was ready.  Now, the food. Our worst experience. I ordered a shrimp, chorizo, yellow squash dish with other mixed veggies.  It would of been a good dish expect the squash was not cooked (i think it was still raw and left nothing to be desired).  Husband ordered the vegetarian taco's which were barely eaten. He's not picky but they just weren't good.  The hi-light of the dinner was the guacamole. Small cup for $10 bucks but a least is was good.  Not likely to return.  Unfortunately, after 3+ meals we couldn't even get a single great meal.  Also, pretty proud pricing!  ***Servers were good. Pleasant and efficient....",

Tomato sauce with garlic; it belonged in an Italian restaurant on top of pasta, not as a salsa.  I asked the server about it and she said you could BUY spicy salsa.  The chips were all broken.  The tables looked like they were second hand from a 1950's cafeteria.  Several were long tables where multiple groups of four were seated in different sections of the table.  The enchiladas and the tacos were good but not great.  Won't be returning.  BTW there is no parking lot so you park on the street in downtown Las Vegas and take your chances.",

We looked around and people were mid dinner and we had to leave. This is not great customer service as we only wanted Margaritas and end our night well!!

    "text": "As a Mexican, I am highly disappointed in this place. I walked in and the dude must have not seen the nopal (cactus) on my forehead, and proceeded to speak to me in English, which may not mean anything to someone who is not of our culture, but for me, you should at least say Buenos Dias or Hola as a salutation if you claim to be a Mexican or Mexican inspired restaurant, (unless you are just ripping off of our food and culture, *sigh*).  First problem their salsa for their chips, is nothing but tomato sauce with hardly anything to make it a \"salsa\" which was unfortunate. I ended up ordering the shrimp enchiladas in tomatillo sauce.  Here's where the second issue comes up. They made their shrimp in a salsa roja first prior to making the enchilada and then added the tomatillo sauce on the top which completely clashed. Tasted more like a sweet and sour enchilada, which might mean they are going for an Asian-Mexi fusion? The arroz and frijoles were just okay. I had a piece of their Tres Leches cake for dessert because I couldn't make my mind up between that and the flan, so I took the waiter's advice. While it looked pretty, it was just a piece of a thick cornbread doused in a la Lechera/milk mix.   The only thing authentic about this place was the Mexican Coca Cola that I had, the Mexicans working in the back, oh and the decor was nice. Bye Felipe!!!  2nd part of this rant, because I stewed in angryface as I walked back to the office, which could have been a combination of the amount I paid them, the fact that they are called \"La Comida\" when I left wanting real Mexican food, and because esta mas caliente que el culo del diablo outside. (translation: it's so hot outside it's hotter than Satan's a**hole... pardon my language but it was like 106 degrees outside)  Seriously they should change their name to THE FOOD, because they don't deserve to sell anything remotely to even be considered Mexican.",

BTW, it is 2 to an order, so, $11 for an order.  I did the math. -o- Salsa, a little too Old El Paso, heavy on the tomato, light on the, well, everything else.  -o- Chips were decent, but not sure if from a bag or fried in store.  Not very salted which could be good if your blood pressure is high, or bad if you like flavor. -o- Shot, a perfect Don Julio Anejo, but for $19, it had better be perfect.  I like the cantina look of the place, but not the mason glasses or plastic chairs.  Also, no draft beer. I did take a picture of my food, which had fairly decent presentation.  I typically am not harsh with my ratings, but $30 for 2 tacos & a shot while sitting in plastic patio chairs does not seem like smart restaurant-ing.  I suppose the truth hurts; it hurt my wallet for sure.",

It was pretty slow for a Tuesday night so we were greeted & seated right away. Our Server Frank came right over and got the process going with chips & salsa and water in the cool little mason jars that everyone seems to be doing these days. He answered questions, explained the menu, etc.  I ordered whatever Server Frank suggested and he didn't disappoint. Like mojitos & margaritas? Then get the Verano de Jalisco it was THE best drink I had during my whole time in Vegas. I'm not a salt girl, but I couldn't get enough of the salt/Mexican spice mixture on the rim of the glass.  Start out with ceviche Frank said. Absolutely. The shrimp were juicy and plump and the plantains added just the right amount of sweetness.  Get the shrimp tacos (Camaron al maya) Frank told me. Done and done. Once again the shrimp were plump and filled the tortilla, there was the perfect amount of cabbage and queso fresco to make it taste just right.  My friend got the shrimp enchiladas and besides sharing the chips, salsa & ceviche we didn't offer each other to try our dishes because they were that good we didn't want to give them up.  The only thing I turned Frank down on was dessert. I didn't want to press my luck and have dessert disappoint, though I'm sure it wouldn't. Or maybe I just didn't want to get rid of that Verano drink taste that I polished off my meal with.   Try this place out! Really have no complaints. I do agree with people who say its pricey. My 2 shrimp tacos were $13 but I was on vacation and it was Vegas so I felt ok to splurge!",

We were ready to go and asked for check took forever to get Check and server was not able to split the check our table had too many people to try to work out the bill and it took too long just to get it situated so he went to talk to his manager to see if she could split the check and they made it seem like it's a policy to not be able to split the checks they are just lazy!!! The manager split the check into two checks and still couldn't get it right I got fed up I just went up to them and said I just want to pay for my part and leave. The server just rang my check up and I paid and left. Never coming back again and not recommending anyone to come here.",

    "text": "So here it goes... The ambiance of this place is great! Very hip, eclectic, day of the dead decor which I love for its quirkiness with a pinch of darkness. Only down side is the entrance is no where near the hostess station. My friend and I had a reservation on a packed Friday night and I was expecting chaos but I was pleasantly surprised! The wait for our table was not long and once seated the waiter came over to get our drink order within reasonable time.   The waiter was very nice and explained things on the menu to me because it was my first time there. Ultimately my friend and I ordered three dishes and the avocado based salsa. Now here is were things went downhill for me. First of all the food took quite a awhile to come out (which I can let them slide on because they were extremely busy that night) but it also came out in spurts which was somewhat disruptive to the flow of our meal. Then the food...   Of everything we ordered I only liked one dish. We had the chicken enchiladas, the elote asado, and the queso fundido. The only dish I like was the elote asado because it had great taste and was literally addicting. It reminded me of being in LA and getting the corn-on-the-cob version from the little cart... Lol! Ijs! The fundido was okay but not enough meat for me. The enchiladas was the worst of all. It had a mole sauce which he said would be kind of sweet but it wasn't. The taste of the sauce was awful to me and the chicken was tasteless.  I have had great mole sauces and this was not one of them... Deeply disappointed! As for the salsas... To thin for my taste and not flavorful enough for my taste!   Overall, cute business cute concept but the food is not good enough to keep me coming back. However, I feel it is a good place to have pre-dinner drinks and appetizers. So for that purpose I would go back but I would not refer people here for a great tex-mex meal!",

Love the ambiance and decor but the food is simply meh.  Think Chevy's meets Vanguard Lounge...except I can at least think of a couple dishes at Chevy's I like.  I came here with several friends and one asked the server for nachos. The entertainment went as follows: Her: Can I please have nachos? Server: We don't have nachos Her: Do you have chicken, tortilla chips, salsa, cheese, beans, guacamole, and sour cream. Server: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, and yes. Her: Then you have nachos. Server: Sorry we do not serve nachos, this restaurant is authentic mexican. Her: [pout face]  She then proceeded to order each individual item as a side and dumped them on her plate and made...yup nachos. So yeeeahhh, if it's not considered \"authentic\" I get if it's not on the menu but if you have the ingredients what's so hard about accommodating a guests request? She didn't ask someone to go slice up some beef stomach and make menudo. I guarantee it took more energy to individually prepare and serve those items, then to just dump them on a pile of chips. I don't get it, anyway, rant over.   The food is subpar and considering that there are multiple \"authentic\" Mexican restaurants within a two mile radius, this place would only be good for a quick drink.",

Really tastes like tomato paste with salt and pepper in it. Sea bass tacos were mediocre and COLD. And for $14 for three street tacos (which is all you get) it's too steep for the quality you receive. The service was lackluster and I had to ask for my water to be refilled three times while there.   Upon asking for the check, I waited for 20 minutes for the waiter to bring it. They also forgot (completely) the chile verde tacos to go. So I waited an additional 30 minutes for them to make the tacos - again, 2 VERY SMALL street tacos for approximately $10.  Summary: mediocre food, mediocre service, and not worth the price or the headache!",

It was dinner time, but we came specifically for margaritas. There was some chips and salsa brought out to us that were whatever. The chips were not very crispy and overly thick. The salsa was more chile based and thick like marinara, which in theory is ok but this missed the mark. There is really great selection of margaritas made with fresh juices. We ordered the blood orange, guava and passion fruit. The guava was my favorite. It didn't pack a huge punch, which for me means they were being stingy with the tequila. They were mostly sweet except for the passion fruit which was actually overly sour for my taste. If I wanted fresh juice they would have been fine.   Over all you are paying for the downtown experience and the trendy little neighborhood they are nestled into. I would come back here and remind them to kick it up a little with the tequila. I really enjoyed sitting in their airy dining room on my last night in Vegas.",

It  should be called NO COMIDA AND CRAPPY SERVICE. my friend ordered the enchiladas and it looked like slob on a tortilla, According to our server, she said someone was passing by every second to check on us( only passed twice) so when our bill came she said she couldnt do anything about her SLOB ON A PLATE. Also, It seemed like some sort of big shot from the restaurant came to greet the people sitting in front of us and ignored what was going on at our table. I say BIG SHOT because the chefs and kitchen staff kept coming to him about things but he was oblivious. Im pretty sure he was a manager or owner,  to my surprise he was LATIN and didnt care much to what was going on around him. ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS PLACE ARE THE MARGARITAS AND CHIPS AND SALSA.

Friend asked for avocado for her salad three times and it never arrived.  Carne asada salad was lots of lettuce with a few strips of steak.  Friend was underwhelmed.  I have a personal mission to sample carnitas around Southwestern U.S.  These carnitas tacos were underwheleming.  Carnitas were bland; almost tasted frozen and then reheated.  More fat than meat. Tortillas were soggy.  Salsa that came with chips did not taste freshly made-- almost tasted like it came from a jar. Rice and beans were average.  Do not plan on returning again.",

When arranging my company party here, the manager, Rafael, was very communicative  and quick with his email response.  Planning our event was a breeze thanks to him.  La Comida has a fantastic menu.  The food is mouthwatering!  I highly recommend the ceviche, and the tacos are great.  Sure, you could go down the street and find a taco stand with good tacos for less, but the ingredients won't be as fresh and high quality as La Comida.  You certainly get what you pay for.  While the food is delicious, the drinks are even better!  The Prickly Pear Margarita is by far the best margarita I have ever had.  Not too sweet, no tangy sour mix flavor... You can tell that it is a quality margarita.  The sangria is also superb.  Definitely give those two a try when you go. Finally, La Comida's ambiance is fun, clean and casual.  It is the perfect place to start your night downtown, or just grab drinks after work.  You should check this place out.",

The margaritas are decent during happy hour but don't plan on feeling a buzz because the alcohol content is so low u feel like your drinking a virgin fruit drink. During Happy hour theres no food items available for the happy hour price and the food and drink prices aren't worth ordering anything unless it's happy hour,what poor marketing! The manager seems uptight an had no personality which may have been due to the fact the place was basically like a ghost town. The bartender seems friendly but beware his job is to hustle you with their extremely pricey guacamole. I believe it was $8 which was more then the drink at happy hour. The salsa was a joke and since your forced to eat tortillas due to their pricey menu at happy hour guacamole sounds better then what it taste. This place has potential due to it's location but management needs to take a marketing class and a hustling bartender at least needs to be pretty. What a rip off, I will not return!!!",

    "text": "It is funny that most of the knocks against this joint are the price, with something like \"...for Mexican food...\" accompanying the gripe. Yes, there is dirt cheap Mexican food out there - some of it is even decent. But if you are getting an elevated experience with high quality ingredients, then expect a higher price. Hell, Italian food is largely based in pasta and sauce, yet they can charge whatever they want and there is little fuss over the price. With that said, does La Comida's food (MEXICAN even!) deserve a (slightly) higher price tag. Well... maybe. The decor and atmosphere are superb, there is no doubt about that. It sports a retro-chic (to pair two horribly over-used words together) look, and it is done with much love and care. The space is nice and open, and it seamlessly flows right into the street. As for the food - that is a bit difficult to judge from my one experience. My date and I stopped here for something light - only splitting an app and an entree. Oh yeah, and there were some chips and salsa going on, which were fresh and tasty. The app was a shrimp ceviche that was overly limey. The entree was the Camaron del Golfo - a dish with large shrimp, veggies, and sauce. It was solid and light, but seemed to be missing something. If nothing else, I plan on visiting Comida again for its cool, casual vibe. Hopefully, it will be with more people, so I can get more of the flavors going on here.",

    "text": "\"Meh\" just about sums it up. The menu looks good but the food is below average. We ordered the queso fundido- the cheese wasn't the kind usually used in queso fundido and the chorizo tasted sweet rather than spicy. The street corn was OK- the corn was a little overcooked. The rice and beans were not good at all and the shrimp and butternut squash had only 4 small shrimp but was priced at a whopping $18.00! One would think that for that price, the tortillas would be made in house, but no, they're the same crap you get at the grocery store. The red snapper tacos were the most well received item at the table. As far as decor, the building itself is great, but the overdone Mexican kitsch is just annoying. The fake flowers in the pots on the wall in the entry could be replaced with real aloe and other succulents- that would be beautiful and actually more authentically Mexican. I did like the leather wrapped plastic chairs and the tables were nice too. And finally, it's too loud in there.",

    "text": "This review is based on experience at the bar. Unfortunately we didn't have time to eat more than just chips and salsa, which by the way may have been the best chips and salsa I've ever eaten. A group of 6 of us wandered in looking for a quick drink. Everyone at the bar was very nice and the drinks came fast. Oh, and there's a swing! Like right at the bar! So fun and creative, but not in the cheesy seedy way that many of the Vegas bars are. You will not find flashy foot long glasses and servers in bikinis here!! We were so impressed with the service and the style of the place that my husband and I stopped in again 2 nights later, and to my surprise the whole staff remembered and welcomed us back like family! The margaritas were Delicious. One of the friendliest places we visited in Vegas. A trip to La Comida will most definitely be on our agenda on our next Vegas vacation.",

I recommend the tuna appetizer, the corn-cotija side dish and the chicken cooked in parchment. The pork is delicious- very spicy. Save room for dessert- the tres leches cake is fantastic.",

The environment is cool, can't speak for the drinks, but the food was GOD AWFULLLLLLLLLL - I got the carne asada and it was honestly the most disgusting thing I have ever had in quite some time.  The guy I was with was paying for it so I didn't want to complain but I could honestly barely stomach it and am still disgusted thinking about it right now.",

The atmosphere is nice, the prices are on the upper end for Mexican food but I'll forgive them that because the food is high quality and prices in the area are high in general. However, the service was poor. The restaurant was slow, and it looked like there were plenty of staff, but we felt like we waited too long to place our order and get our receipt. While the food is good, overall I'd rather eat at Casa Don Juan or Los Tacos.",

The prices are reasonable and the portion you get is more than enough to eliminate your appetite. I'm from Denver and I'm always looking for great Mexican food. This is the first time I deciced to stay at a hotel downtown (The D) and new places like this are going to make it easier to stay downtown again.",

I will say the salsa was fairly good but that's where it ends. Rice and beans, bland, bland bland. Have they never heard of salt??? I had chicken tacos, bland chicken, bland sour guacamole. My spouse had the chicken enchilada with poblano cream mole, horrible. when the server asked how it was my spouse said very bland. Server right away got an attitude and said \"have you ever had mole?\" Yes good authentic mole that has flavor. He suggested replacing it with their shrimp enchiladas, ok why not. Oh my gosh, all tortilla and some scrawny chopped up shrimp, again no flavor at all. If you like bland food with no flavor then this place is for you. I predict it will be closed in 6 months so you better hurry if you want to give it a try.",

    "text": "The only reason this place gets two stars is the service and somewhat decent food. Location is in the \"revitalization\" part of downtown Las Vegas so it's loud, sketchy and when we saw police cars patrolling the block multiple times, we should have taken the clue and left. I'm writing this review to encourage management and guests to NOT patronize the valet service, which was being managed by ABC Valet, when we went a little over a month ago. They returned my car, and when I pointed out that my hood emblem had been pried off, the valets immediately threw up their hands to say \"not my fault\". Their policy says you can file a claim with their management but ONLY IF YOU STAY ON SITE TO DO SO. We ended up waiting over an hour for them to find claim forms, get their manager on the phone, and were treated like we were the criminals for trying to pull something over on them. If one of them had just nicely said, we're really sorry but you know emblems are only $30 or so to replace, I would have been ok. The La Comida manager was great about sending his apologies and offering us drinks, but honestly, I hope he understands that his valet service takes away from his restaurant's overall experience to guests.",
