The restaurant was not crowded but it took a half hour to get an order of pasta, a salad, and a panini. They had very strong candles lit all over the restaurant which is unusual to have a perfume scent in an eating establishment. I did catch a scent or sewer gas upon entering so maybe the candles were covering that up. No Candles in a restaurant please.",

    "text": "Wow, my wife and I decided to try something off the strip and boy were we glad that we did.  Some of the best Italian food that i've had.  I'm Italian so i know what the best choices are, but my wife is not, and our waiter Ryan was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and the flavors of almost everything. He is a young looking man and he recommended us a certain wine which my wife LOVED........and now i have to go buy a bottle of it and its not cheap -_-.  Per our waiters recommendations my wife got Spaghetti Amatriciana and I got my go to Italian dish of Gnocchi Alla Bolognese.  Both were very good and we cleaned our plates.  If you are visiting Las Vegas and want really good Italian food and don't want to pay the inflated strip prices, then you need to go here.  Ask to be sat at Ryans table cause he was one of the best waiters/waitresses that i have had.  Hands down my new favorite place to go when i visit Las Vegas.",

( low end strip mall quality at best)  had a few pasta's which were bland and not at all memorable, they completely forgot to order our entrees, even after the server repeated the order back to us.  Not a single apology or anything just defended himself to the end.  at the least have a manager come over.  Rethink it guys!!",

I was greeted by the owner, sat by the hostess, and my drink order was taken immediately.  The bartender made some super martini's for my entire family.  Each of us tried a different appetizer, an entree, and we all had espresso and desert.  I had the pork chop and my father had the chef make him chicken picatta.  We also had meatballs for an appetizer.  I see the previous issue with the toilet was repaired as I visited the female toilet with my Mom.  Large comfortable area.  It is worth mentioning that the wait staff was very attentive to our wants and needs.  Piano player made the ambience relaxed and enjoyable.  My Mom wanted to try their authentic pizza and the Chef made is special as she is a vegetarian.  They also offered us a Bolognese that was made for my vegetarian mother.  I will be back again.  The restaurant also offers a happy hour from 3PM - 6PM where I can try everything that I wanted for $7.00.  I will be returning with my girlfriends during that time.",

    "text": "We decided to try this place for dinner based on reviews here. On the waiters suggestion, my husband and I each decided to try one of the specials. After waiting for quite awhile, the manager finally came over and let us know that what my husband had ordered was out. He offered two suggestions that were similar and my husband chose one. After what was a ridiculous wait for an empty restaurant, the food finally came. My husband said his food was delicious. Mine was a disaster. I had ordered the risotto  with chicken and asparagus. The chicken was so over cooked it was rubbery. The asparagus was just stem pieces that were over an inch and a half thick. They were woody and gross. The risotto was supposed to have a \"touch of pesto\" and my dish was swimming in a green soup. I'm guessing they were out of my special as well and just decided to scrape something together the best they could to not have to come over again. In fairness, they did take my meal off the bill. But the offered substitution for my husband's meal was almost TWICE THE PRICE of what he had originally ordered. At the end of the day, we paid more for one meal than what we would have for the two meals we ordered. I ended up having crackers for dinner because we couldn't find a place still open by the time we left.  Huge disappointment. If you have time and money to waste, it seems there's a chance you could have a good experience here. We, however, will not be giving them a second chance.",

The beans seemed dry and gritty and it wasn't even an authentic minestrone soup! It seemed very much like a can of Campbell's minestrone soup! I ordered the chicken parmesan and it was definitely not chicken that I was eating! The chicken seemed very stringy and rubbery and I could not even eat 3 bytes of the chicken parmesan! And the marinara sauce seemed very sweet and the noodles were very al Dante!! My waitress done a great job and was very attentive but I have to say you are way better off going to Olive Garden and eating there! I urge you to stay far away from this restaurant especially for the price you would pay! And when the manager came over to apologize for the food you could definitely tell that his apology was not sincere! The guy couldn't even look me in the eyes and give me a sincere apology! Stay away don't waste your money",

They had bowls that were too tall to mix oil and balsamic in. You either got too much oil, or by the time you ate all the oil all that was left was the balsamic. Tasty bread even though it was cold.  We ordered a bottle of water for the table. When we finished it the waitress brought over another and opened it without asking us if we wanted it. She's got some balls, I'll give her that. When they brought over both the salads and our pasta dishes they did not set it in front of the right person both times, even with our waitress standing at the table with us.  The pasta portions were fair for my parents but my ravioli was not enough. I had 9 little raviolis, the filling portion being no bigger than a nickel. My mother complained that her carbonara dish was too salty.  I ended up leaving hungry, dissatisfied and disappointed after my dad paid $90. If you're looking for good, authentic pasta, go to Pasta Ristorante on Horizon Ridge.",

    "text": "So you need a car or transportation.  This is in a shopping area called The District neighboring the Green Valley Ranch hotel, about 12 miles from the Tropicana end of strip.  If you're in the area, give it a try.  The shops were empty.  The only thing busy on a Tuesday night was this restaurant.  On this night it was a bit too busy.  It seems a company decided to have dinner for at least 50 employees who took up a good portion of the place, which is fine, except it made it impossible to talk.  The acoustics were not good.  So loud.  Seems like this wasn't a good mix of regular diners and a company party.  I would have suggested they book the whole place for the evening.  The bread to start was yummy.  The house cabernet delicious, nice and dry.  The margarita pizza was good.  Pasta is house made and delicious.  Sauces good.  Family run.  Decent portion of food.  But a couple of issues that really shouldn't happen here.  The waiter seemed very rushed and that we had arrived before the company employees were seated.  Waiter did his best to check on us but he was always flying by the table.  I felt like if I asked a question it would interrupt him.  He must have had too much to do to serve his customers more attentively.  In part because he was in a hurry he took my order incorrectly.  I usually order chicken picatta, one of my favorite dishes and I've eaten it in many restaurants.  When it arrived it was chewy and looked light brown instead of white. Definitely not the tender chicken that comes with picatta.  But I was hungry and it took quite awhile to get the food so I didn't question it, just figured I'd ordered a dish that wasn't good.  A bit of a disappointment.  When the bill came I noticed it said veal picatta, not chicken picatta.  As it turns out he took down the wrong order.  Normally I would have said something about it tasting bland and not tender but again, he was in a big hurry and I was hungry.  This kind of ruined the rest of the meal because I don't like veal picatta, haven't ordered in years and normally don't eat meat.  I wish I would have had an opportunity to taste the chicken picatta.  When I pointed out the discrepancy on the bill he apologized and took the dinner off the check, which was very nice.  But my stomach felt a bit queasy the rest of the evening.  Honestly all the times I've ordered chicken picatta I've never had a waiter bring me the wrong thing.  They need to slow down a bit here and listen more closely.  I think the dishes are probably pretty good here.  And the owner is right on site.  He was really busy too or I would have said something.  Just don't order the veal.  I'd stick to pasta and happy hour...",

    "text": "Overall a good experience.  The server grew on us but initially he seemed a little put out by doing his job.  As the meal continued, he seemed to straighten up a bit, I don't know if that is because I checked in on Yelp;  because he knew I was looking at Yelp for advice; or he just had a change of attitude.  The only bad thing about this is...this is what foreshadowed my experience.   I remember the meal, but I particularly remember the service...and it shouldn't be that way.     When we arrived, we were seated on the patio.  I like the patio, BUT the misting fans were distracting because they were not maintained, so they leaked large drops of water instead of mist, and that then would get blown onto us and our table.  So, we asked to have the misting part shut off, so we were not getting sprayed with water.  The issue here is that apparently, they are so broken that even when they shut the misting off, the fan in front of us had a stream of water spraying our still(For our entire meal), so they HAD to shut the fan off too or we would just have been sprayed the whole meal.   Then it became a little too warm to sit on the patio.  We didn't complain about it, we just tried to enjoy our meal, knowing at this point the misting was not fixable.     Meal wise, we had a number of items, my mom had the chicken parm sandwich and said it was good, my older kids each had pasta al vodka and i tried this and it was good.   My younger kids split the margarita pizza and it was ok.  Crust was good.    My wife and I split two items, the Porchetta sandwich and a pizza with Prosciutto and greens.  I had them bring me Balsamic Glaze for the pizza and WITH that, it was good.  Without it, it was just bland and missing something.   The Porchetta sandwich was lacking IMO.  I am a huge Porchetta fan and this was just not Porchetta in my opinion.  It lacked all the seasoning and flavor of a good porchetta, and they put a roasted pepper on it, which I felt was just masking the lack of flavor in the porchetta with an overly strong peppers flavor.  So, I won't order that again.  I saw a number of things on the menu that I wanted to try, so I will probably try here again, but what I had didn't live up to expectations.  Last observation...LOVE the idea of tables on the patio with padded seating, BUT...the table prevented you from being able to put your legs under the table, so you just can't sit close enough to the table to the point where it is uncomfortable to sit there.  I wanted to be able to lounge back in the \"couch\" but then slide up to sit at the table and eat and i pretty much had to sit back the whole time and even take my food off the table to sit and eat.",

All of the menu is delicious I praise the \"real Italian\" restaurants that make their own pasta and more importantly make the food to order the way YOU want it! I don't like red sauce (yes it's a shocker) and most dishes are primarily made this way. I love that every time I've been here if I see something I would love but it's prepared red they automatically say we will make it with ANY sauce you like, yes thank you!!! So needless to say I am always more then happy with my dishes here. From starters, to main dishes, to dessert \"cannolis\", to cocktails and house made Limoncello \"sooooo yummy\" it's a great place with really good prices.",

Even arrived little late, a lot of people are still dining in. Food came about 15-20 mins after seating.  I hate to be critical, but the food temperature is not even. Some part too hot and smoking and some part was cold. Some part taste raw and rubbery. Obviously microwaved because they don't want to make fresh because they're closing. No one even came to ask how's the food because they know what they did. We have to call the waiter to order carry out pizza for my son but they said the grill is close for tonight. Sorry, but it's our first and last on this restaurant. Back to my favorite restaurant Brio, always fresh even if I arrived at closing time.",

    "text": "Had a horrible experience here Friday night. Took a date for dinner and we sat on the patio to try and enjoy the music. The table next to us had a big group of people that were all standing and visiting and the blatantly in our personal space. I tried not to focus on that in anticipation of a delicious meal. My date ordered the Tagliatelle Bolognese and I ordered the featured Steak. Our server either awkwardly approached the table or avoided us altogether because his path was being blocked by the big group that was standing and visiting around us.  When the food finally arrived it was delivered by a food runner not our server. Usually it is common practice for the server to check on and see how the first couple of bites taste. The mashed potatoes that were part of my steak were ice cold. After about 5 minutes of still no server I flagged someone else down and asked them to send over our server. I told him the potatoes were cold and he said he would \"take care of it\". I could see the kitchen from our table and he handed the plate back to one of the cooks.  Now I have worked in kitchens before and anytime a plate is returned you do your best to make sure it is perfect the second time around. After a minute or two I saw my plate sitting on the counter and the server was standing back near a drink station. No one from the kitchen flagged him down and he was not alert and staying on top of the situation eventually the plate came back and again the potatoes were cold. I was not happy. By this time my date only had a few bites left so I wasn't about to send it back twice. The server never stayed and asked me to check the potatoes and no manager or anyone else came by to apologize or ask us how everything went. When the check came there was nothing taken off of the bill or any offering of a free dessert. The way I see it there were many opportunities to salvage my experience and get my business back. I left feeling disappointed and annoyed.",

    "text": "I do like this place.  My first experience was great!!  Second experience, not so great.  First time we had a lovely waiter who was super attentive.  My kids always want to come here now.  Our second experience was Mother's Day weekend.  We were a party of 10, 6pm reservation.  To our lovely (not) surprise there was a limited menu.  Super disappointing because we were not told that when we made our reservation, and if we had known this we probably wouldn't have come here (could've gone to Pizza Rock). They didn't even have meatballs or lasagna. Why a limited menu anyways- all the restaurants around this area are larger and just as busy and they don't limit their menu?   Our waiter had this certain heir about him, like he couldn't be bothered with us.  He left us for over 10 minutes to look at the menu, all the time I just watched him socialize and look at the hockey game.  Eventually I had to ask one of the ladies bringing our bread \"where is our waiter\"?  Then he just seemed annoyed when we didn't know the menu- nothing had descriptions like the normal menu does.  At one point my mom had asked him for a refill, when he brought it back he looked right at my brothers empty soda glass and just walked away- like let me get out of here as fast as I can before he asks for a refill.  The rest of the staff was friendly!!    My husband and I decided to share chicken parmesan w/pasta, a salad and a side of green beans because I get full quick (eating all the yummy bread) and I'd rather not take home a ton of leftovers.  Chicken parmesan was $27.  Ok, fine with me, but the portion size was laughable.  It was literally no more then 4oz of chicken breast pounded out thin. When they brought our food out we thought the waiter had separated ours out on 2 plates because he knew we were sharing. It was that small that this would've been totally believable.  Turns out that second plate was my brothers order.  My husband and I literally laughed out loud. I don't know if they raised their prices for this weekend? But it was way overpriced- I paid $5 more for a larger and more delicious chicken dish at Olives @ Bellagio.  My father ordered sausage ravioli and said he couldn't even taste sausage.  We also had dessert.  I love Tiramisu and I really enjoyed the one here.  I'm pretty easy to please when it come to Tiramisu though.  I pray for you if your waiter's name rhymes with Larry, Harry, or Gary.  We will most likely return because we live close by.  I generally don't eat a lot of carbs and I love eating salads and meatballs.  My kids also like their kids menu.  My husband never wants to return.  If it wasn't for the limited menu and our snooty waiter, I know our experience would have be a lot better.",

Second- why would you give a reservation at 930pm and make me drive from who knows were if you already know that you're closing at 9pm, that doesn't make any sense... she was smiling in our faces keep on saying sorry for that, like really? I wouldn't give this place not even 0 if that was possible..... there is hundreds places around you where I could go but I choose your place ... and i left disappointed... i will never come back",

At the beginning, everything seemed fine, we seemed to have waited a while to order, we continued to wait and still nothing. So when we ordered we still waited for a long time, I honestly don't mind waiting if it's something worth waiting for but when nobody tells you anything and your just there waiting? For example, ordered my kids juices at the same time all drinks ordered and when an hour passed and no kids juices,  we asked for them and they said that they must have been brought to the wrong table. Anyways, continued to wait and I kid you not, the kids drinks came 15 min after the food, and this was initiated with a comment from the waiter that they ran out and had to go borrow some apple juice from Lucille's. I mean why lie about the kids drinks in the first place, people need to speak up and communicate here and maybe people would nit be so upset. Again, the food was tasty especially the gnocchi and raviolis.",

We decided to share the antipasti dish, described as meats, cheeses,olives. When the server brought to table, he said he made sure the tomatoes did not touch anything. How could that be when a lot of the mozzarella was on top of the tomatoes. I could not eat the mozzarella and should have sent the whole dish back, but did not want to get into it. My husband ordered the shrimp frances described by waiter as very lightly floured shrimp in a lemon and white wine sauce. There was no sauce and the breading was thick. The shrimp still had the tails on which was also breaded, so a lot of it ended up in his mouth. Very disappointed. On the up side, the bread was great as was my salmon dish",

The appetizers were horrible, 5 rings of raw calamari & basically a tasteless watery bowl of shrimp scampi . Our entrees were just as bad & my brother & I were having a skin reaction to the not so fresh sea food. On top of that the server came around non stop trying to take the plates when it was obvious we were still in the middle of trying to eat the meal.

We stopped at the very friendly bar on the way out for a last drink before we left and the weather was so nice and the bartenders and other patrons so fun that we went outside to the patio bar and spent a few hours having just the best time with complete strangers and made some new friends. What a nice crowd Bella Vita draws. The bartenders and servers and the manager have a lot to do with this, that I am sure. They treat you like you are their guest. We will be back on a regular basis. For the fabulous food as well as the great service and the atmosphere they have created! Wonderful evening! Thank you!",

I sat inside the first time but the weather was nice on the second visit we sat on the patio. The fans they have to cool the air are WAY TOO STRONG! Besides from only being 85 degrees outside (didn't see why fans at this time were really necessary) they are loud, blew right down on us as we sat there, and they cooled the food instantly as soon as we were served. Ugh. It was a less than desirable experience. I also saw they have misters on the fans for the hot summer. I can't even imagine sitting out there being wet and blown!! Food is okay but again, it was ice cold in 2 minutes so the flavor was gone. I was ask to be sat away from the fans if you sit on the patio.",

    "text": "Never in my life have I been treated this poorly in a restaurant much less \"fine dining\". I went there Saturday night with my boyfriend for date night. We brought our own bottle of wine ($20 corkage fee which is a great price) and sat outside on the patio. I ordered the special of the day which was a seafood medley with risotto and my date ordered the gnocchi bolognese. We decided we'd split both entrees in which we asked for extra plates. Once the meals got to our table we started with the risotto, finished our first meal and then proceeded to the gnocchi.   To start, the risotto was fantastic. It was flavorful, the seafood was well prepared and very delicious. However, the first bite into the gnocchi tasted off. The sauce simply didn't taste good and the meat had a strange unappetizing flavor to it. I told our server promptly. When he asked us what was wrong, I told him. I felt like he didn't believe me and we were making up excuses to return the plate. So upon feeling like he was searching for more of a reason, I was perfectly honest and said it tasted like Chef Boyardee (which it did). Granted, maybe I shouldn't have said that, but he asked me. He immediately got offended and with a snarky smile told me he would tell the chef what I said.   He takes our plates and everything else off our table aggressively, slamming dish-ware onto his tray and did not make any eye contact. At this point I feel extremely uncomfortable. So I ask him if I offended him by telling him we didn't like the food. He says \"I just told the chef who I have been friends with for over 10 years what you said and he wasn't happy about that\". I immediately told him, \"why you didn't have to do that?\" He did not ask us if we wanted anything else. Did not apologize. But insisted on being rude and making us feel like we did something wrong by not liking the dish.   We were prepared to order deserts or possibly another entree but felt incredible awkward. You're telling customers the chef is pissed at you? You're going to disengage and treat them like they're wrong because of that?  We left feeling disappointed and upset. This service should never be tolerated. Listen here, Donacilano (our server). Not everyone is going to like their entree. It is OK.  You work in a customer service industry (just like myself) that means that you SERVE us, your guests.   Upon arriving we told each other this would be a great regular date spot, but not anymore.",

We were seated immediately, but then a good fifteen minutes passed before anyone came over to take drink orders. Finally our waiter arrived, took our orders, he did delivered them promptly, but said he'd be right back to take our orders, and never returned. About fifteen more minutes pass, my husband flags down someone and asks if we can place an order. Our flustered waiter arrives a few minutes later, quickly takes our orders. At least thirty more minutes pass, no food, our waiter walks by, smiles and says, \"oh, you got your food and done already? How about dessert?\" My husband tells him we haven't received our food, he looks shocked, apologized and runs away. He returns ten minutes later with our food. Not sure if he forgot to put in our order or what. The food was okay, my fish was really dry. Our waiter comes by, takes our plates, tells us quickly which desserts he likes, we decline and he looks peeved, but it's been over an hour and a half, most just waiting, we just want to go home. Prices were steep for the quality and customer service. I hate leaving sour reviews, but my money and time are also valuable. I probably won't return.",

Not a long wait, as there was only one other table seated and no one else waiting.  We were sold.     Walked in Friday afternoon at 230.   Greeted immediately and sat by the hostess.   Waiter came out and got our drink orders and was super friendly.    Drinks came out soon after.   We put in our order for our appetizer and food.  15 minutes goes by and no bread at our table.  No caprese salad. (Strike 1) Mind you, there is nobody in the restaurant except another table and us.  We are now at the 20 minute mark and here comes our food.    But, where is the caprese salad????    Waiter completely forgot, so we said no worries and moved on.  Except, there still was no bread on our table, so we asked for bread and oil and vinegar. He looked down and said their is some on the table and realized he never gave us any (strike 2).   Looked at my plate and realized they gave me a side salad and I asked for fries.  So they messed up on that as well.   (Strike 3).     1 star for service.  Everyone was nice.  But how do you forget our appetizer, bread AND order of fries.   When the place is completely empty???    Here's how the food tasted.    Appetizer  Caprese salad-never came to the table.   (I do have to point out that he packed one to go since he forgot it on our order).  But, we never ate it.    Meatball panini -   Good.   Best thing we ate there   Chicken parm panini - bland.  Dry and flavorless.  Chicken was super thin and no sauce on it. It was disappointing to say the least bc the waiter is the one who suggested it.    Pasta with tomato sauce.  -  meh.  Nothing fancy.  Just pasta and tomato sauce lol.     Tiramisu - gave it to us complimentary bc of the mishaps.  It was ok.  Way too much cream.  Not enough ladyfingers.    1 star for the food  I know everyone makes mistakes.  And so happy to see a new establishment but, need to step up their game.  Especially for the price you are paying for the meal.   If staff can't remember the order, perhaps write it down?",

We ordered the Beef Carpaccio as an appetizer and were served bread with oil and balsamic, as you might expect from an Italian restaurant. The bread was super fresh and tasty. The Beef Carrasco was a little bland, but with the arugula and Parmesan cheese, it added quite a bit of flavor.  I ordered the Chicken Marsala and the wife ordered the Apple & Pear Salad. My Chicken Marsala had a pretty good taste to it and so did the salad. Mashed potatoes with the Chicken dish were fluffy, but needed a little more flavor and the veggies were tasty.  Service was excellent, although it took us a bit of work to get the check at the end of the meal. They offered to allow us to use the current Yelp coupon, even though they usually only honor it during the week (as stayed on the digital coupon), so that was nice!",

    "text": "I've been coming here regularly for the last year so a review is long overdue. Let's start with the fact that this is located in the district in a primo location that offers happy hour specials and great food.  The service is prompt and usually on point with casual Italian accents drifting through the restaurant bustle. Definitely make reservations for the weekend nights.  My fave is the  Tagliatelle Bolognese - house made al dente pasta with a hearty, yet light meat sauce.   My wife likes the Linguini & Clams - house pasta with a light and savory brothy sauce that coats every noodle and a generous amount of fresh clams.  We've also tried the  Zuca Ravioli -  it can be a hit or miss. When it's good, the browned butter sage sauce is as delicate as the butternut squash ravioli. When it's bad, the sauce looks watered down and sage is undercooked leaving an unpleasant taste.  Burrata - whether in the salad or anti pasta, it looks and tastes house-made fresh.  Penna Cotta - perfect consistency, not too firm. The accompanying wine poached pears are a unique treat.  Tiramisu - Perfect and can convert any non-tiramisu lovers.  It's one of our favorite spots that I hope will be around for a long time.   Bon appetite!",

We had to ask fo our check from the hostess. The manager comped us a piece of cake, but it wasn't enough to come back after spending $75 on a meal.",

We perused the wine menu and decided upon a red Cabernet and a white Riesling. For dinner ordered the chicken piccata and the tagliatelle bolognese. Both were very good and tasted exceptionally well 5/5. The wine sauce on the chicken piccata and flavor was delicious 5/5. Sitting outside on the patio was nice in the evening and they even had live music.   All in all a good dinner with friends and nice atmosphere.  2017 review #1",

This is the best Italian restaurant in Henderson, and easily rivals those in Las Vegas. The staff is professional, friendly, and attentive. The food is outstanding. It has delicious flavor, and at the end of the meal, will not make you feel like you are ready to go into a food coma. The wine list is fantastic, and can accommodate customers with specific wine palettes. Make sure you try the tiramisu! Very highly recommended!",

    "text": "Overpriced and not quality food for the price. Our main issue with the restaurant is the price of it. A tiny platter of calamari was $12 and wasn't the quality we hoped for. There was hardly any flavor and the only flavor given to it was the very delicious marinara dipping sauce provided with the calamari. For the chicken fettuccine alfredo, the chicken was completely unseasoned, dry, and incredibly hard to chew and swallow. The spaghetti provided with the chicken parmesan wasn't very enjoyable and personally I found boxed spaghetti to have better texture and flavor than the restaurants spaghetti. The service was excellent, the servers were very professional and were very attentive to our needs. The atmosphere of the restaurant was uncomfortable, it was a very small area filled with many people and so much noise you could hardly hear the person next to you. The lighting was uncomfortable as well, as there was sunshine in your eyes constantly from reflections on the cars on the street. Overall, we were disappointed by the quality of the food when compared to the pricing. The presentation of the food was lovely, but the taste did not match the beauty. If you would like high quality Italian food for a much cheaper price I suggest Maggiano's, where the chicken parmesan is $5 cheaper and of much higher quality. Would not suggest this to anyone attempting to find enjoyable cuisine at a reasonable price.",

The waitress offered to dim the lights a bit, but nothing actually happened.   An easy improvement would be to reduce the lighting. The place is lit up like a theater stage. Turn down the lights and use those little candles on the tables!  The appetizers were outstanding, but the entree was mediocre. Especially for the steep price, you can expect some culinary extravagance. The portion size, however, was perfect: just enough to be full without feeling stuffed. Moreover, compared to the other so-called Italian restaurants in town, the food here is pretty close to genuine Italian food (similar to what you would get in Europe).  Unfortunately, this place is not suited for vegans! There are hardly any options for vegetarians which is very disappointing in this day and age!",

First, the good which was definitely the food. I ordered the calamari and a Caesar salad. My husband had another salad and gnocchi. The food was great. The server forgot to put the pepperoni on my sons pizza and had to fix that, but overall the food was delicious.  Now for the bad which unfortunately overshadowed the food. When we were sat, our waiter came out, took our drink order and we ordered waters and two kids apple juices. The juices were brought out immediately but were only 1/3 full.  The water never came.  We finally had to ask a busser for water. By that point the 1/3 apple juice were gone, waiter was nowhere around, and we had to give the kids our water. Not once during our meal did he refill our waters. We had to ask other waiters to do so each time.  He forgot our calamari and gnocchi which we then had to ask for.  My favorite part was he cleared the dishes and didn't ask if he could take mine, which still had calamari on it, and walked off.  Finally when we got the bill, we were charged for the 1/3 apple juice ($3 each) even though the meal was supposed to come with the drink.   Honestly, if it were just the food, the location, and the bus staff, they would get 4 stars. But this one waiter was so inattentive and terrible that I don't know that I could go back.",

Our bartender was not very skilled in making cocktails and gave me a drink I didnt actually order. The antipasto misto was still good. Also had the caesar salad which was pretty good. The Panna cotta though..  So disappointing. It was nothing like our first experience with it. This time is came on a plate and it was a layer of a weird raspberry gelatin, Panna cotta and then a raspberry glaze. It all tasted so fake and weird. The raspberry gelatin was not good at all.   Overall, it feels like the first time we went, Bella Vita was new and they were trying really hard to have great service, food and presentation. But, now its almost like they've realized they'll get steady traffic even without trying hard. It's all fine but nothing like I experienced before.",

We were greeted at the door by Sophia, seated immediately, and then handed off to Michelle who brought us water, bread, and oil vinegar. Within a couple of minutes Ryan arrived, gave us the lowdown on the specials and answered all our questions. We arrived during happy hour (3-6) so we decided to try the happy hour calimari, a smaller portion than the regular menu with a price discount. Delicious! Crisp and clean. My GF ordered the linguine and clams, and I ordered the lasagna. One of these days I am going to leave my comfort zone and try something other than lasagna, but since it was our first time here, I had to try it. We both hit home runs. The number of clams (15-18), and the home made linguine in the garlic white wine sauce was amazing. I was very impressed with my lasagna as well, and I am not easily impressed. So many places tend to over do it but this was perfect. The perfect amount of meat, cheese, sauce and noodles! We finished it off with a dish of  panna cotta topped with pears soaked in a Pinot Noir and raspberry syrup. The whole experience was awesome and I can hardly wait to come back.",

We ordered a bottle of champagne, and had to serve our own... can we get a forth glass??? There is four at the table not three... arggg...Our server was not very good at all. Our food finally came....Over an hour and 20 minutes later from our 6:15 reservation.  Waiter recommended the salmon over my Italian selections.... Salmon at a 'Italian' restaurant, OK (?) and it was just that... just 'Ok' nothing special. Can we get some pepper? Had to ask 2 times (again) can we get some lemon for water? Asking again 2 times... would you  please remove these bread plates as we needed the room... nothing done. I moved them myself to a table close by. Well there you have it. Not going back.... No reason to return....",

Then I asked a guy in a suit if he was the manager, so I could give Kelly kudos... Well, turns out is was Sergio the Owner! He spent time with us going over all this amazing place has to offer, including sensational music and outdoor seating. All in all, this is a must try.

Another group our size was already seated on the patio. -several mistakes on the order like dressed salads that weren't supposed to have dressing and pasta with shrimp arriving without shrimp. A drink was spilled on our table and several members of the waitstaff noticed but no one helped. We used all of our napkins to clean up the spill ourselves and eventually our waitress took them away by request.   -when the bill arrived 18% gratuity was included. No surprise because the service was minimal, no refills on water, no extra napkins, no parmesan cheese offered for salad or pasta dishes, and minimal concern for our orders.",

    "text": "I've seen and passed by Bella Vita so many times whenever I'd go to the District but never tried them until very recently.  What caught my eye was the \"Best of Vegas\" stickers so instead of going to Pizza Rock at the Green Valley Ranch, we decided to see if those stickers hold water.  The place was packed for a Thursday night.  All the seats at the bar area/counter were occupied.  There was a singer that night yet the crowd's noise easily overshadowed and won over his voice/singing.  Yes, the place was unusually loud/noisy.    We were seated right away and served with the complimentary bread and olive oil/balsamic vinegar.  Our server was quick to offer their specials for the evening but we opted for fettuccini alfredo, penne a la vodka, ceasar salad and pizza.    The complimentary bread was good so I asked for seconds.  The ceasar salad was a bit too creamy for my liking.  Didn't get the garlicky undertone and the subtlety and added umami of mashed anchovies.  The pizza was very good.  The crust was neither thick nor thin and had a good bite to it.  The pizza sauce gave a good balance to the slight bitterness of arugula, the saltiness of the prosciutto ham and the creaminess of the parmesan shavings.  The pasta dishes were pretty standard though. ..nothing to rave about.  I didn't finish my penne (I guess due to me overstuffing myself with pizza and the complimentary bread).  And oh...they were not skimpy with cheese :).    Food was decent and reasonably priced.  Staff was quick and very responsive. I personally just found the ambience a bit loud, stuffy and crowded.   If you're in or around The District, you may want to support a local joint and give them a try.",

Some of the meats were good, some were not up to par in quality.  We also wanted to try their meatballs.  This I would definitely pass on in the future.  The meatballs were very soggy with a bland flavor.  Very disappointing.    They had a special on the board for the Bay Shrimp Risotto.  I am a huge lover of risotto.  This one missed the mark.  It wasn't as creamy as most risotto's I've enjoyed.  There was a different flavor that really didn't compliment the dish.    I was really hoping for more from this restaurant.  Like the service, everything was underwhelming.",

My friend and I arrived on a perfect day, sun shining, slight breeze, low 70's weather and lucky for us they have a beautiful patio which we could sit on and enjoy this blessing of a day.  It was happy hour and little did we know it but we were in for a treat.  My friend and I tried almost every food item (as they were each $7 and actually a good size, even though they were half portion) on their happy hour menu and each had a cocktail as well.  The food and drinks were all as beautiful as the setting.  Bright, full of both color and flavor, everything was quite satisfying.   Our waiters were very attentive and informative and even asked our opinions which was very nice.  You can tell they want to make everything as pleasing as they can.  Near the end of our meal a musician came onto the patio and began playing live which was a treat.   I will definitely come back here to eat, heck even to just grab a drink and sit on their patio and people watch.  This is a good place and I can't wait to see what it becomes after it establishes itself a bit longer and I can assure you I will be along for the ride.",

My wife, my mother, my grandma, and my aunt with all of their significant others all ordered from the Mother's Day print out they offered with the menu. First we we're brought two dishes that were not for our table and they insisted to individually ask everyone anyways. Then they delivered our food and no one knew who's food belonged to who. 3rd time is the charm I said when I got mine. It was chaos.  My dish was chicken served over warmed tomato sauce with a large side helping of yolk noodles with a dollop of marinara on top. Yeah I didn't read that either when I ordered. All said and done we are a fun family and we can laugh at things. The server known as Erich \"with a ch\" saw my 89 yr grandmother spill a drink on table and we all jump to clean up. Not only did he ignore it he did not send anyone with more napkins or help at all. I was never so displeased with a Mother's Day brunch than I was today.",

The atmosphere at this place is awesome. I love the lighting and the music. And sitting outside was perfect. The restaurant was bustling but not too busy. It was nice.   The bartender Shay was great. We ordered several things to try. The beef carpaccio had mushrooms, we thought it was different and delicious. The meatballs were big and I loved the flavor. We also ordered the Zucca Ravioli which was perfect for autumn. It caught my eye on the menu: butternut squash ravioli with a brown butter sauce with sage. I could have eaten 5 orders it was so good.   We also ordered a hand tossed pizza togo. We decided on the prosciutto, arugula, truffle oil pizza. I really liked the flavor of the crust.   Nothing we tried here was unsatisfactory. In fact it was worth every penny. Our food came out promptly and hot. And the staff and manager were friendly and welcoming. We will be back for sure.",

He was a little snooty and seemed like he was annoyed that he had a late table. He was not engaging at all. When we asked for more bread, the busser ( we asked for our waiter but he was nowhere to be found) told us they had no more bread ---- Seriously??! We asked how come and since he spoke very little English, we had to wait for someone else for an explanation. Food was mediocre at best. I ordered linguini and clams, which consisted of some linguini tossed with oil and garlic and a few clams placed around the plate. The gnocchi was meh at best ......  It felt as though they were not happy about a late reservation and pour their frustration into the servicing of our table. Don't take late reservations if you're going to treat your customer badly. Not sure we'll ever go back. Way better restaurants to choose from.",

Others have commented on her ability to make incredible drinks, and I will add on to those positive comments!  Whether you ask for something on the menu, or something not on the menu, it will be one of the best drinks you get in all of Vegas.  I've lived here a little while, and I can testify!

The service was outstanding (thank you Marcos!).   Some of the best Tiramisu I have ever tasted.  The manager stopped by and checked in, just a really nice evening.  A really lovely evening after a long week.",

I ended up getting a Margarita pizza and it was delicious ! Only think I would change is that there was a lot of mozzarella on the pizza where a True Margarita pizza has a less but either way it was to die for! My boyfriend ended up getting there Lasagna and he loved it! The whole atmosphere of this place was great we ended up sitting outside and got to people watch which is always a plus! Even though we were stuffed the server recommended that we get there house cannolis and we did which was delicious as well! I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a taste of Italian for dinner!",

They offer tastes of the wines if you're not sure what to order and couldn't be nicer about it. The pastas I've had have all been cooked perfectly and the standout was prepared with cured pork cheeks, loved it. The caesar salad is excellent. The frita mista perfectly cooked with a nice crunch but moist inside, think perfect tempura served with a spicy marinara. I recent tried a veal oso bucco and it was one of the best I've had, tender, juicy, well seasoned, perfect. It was served on a bed of risotto  that was delicious. Lobster ravioli was generous and tasty but I think the sauce was a bit too creamy but I'm splitting hairs here. The room is open and airy, very comfortable with a nice balance of casual but classy decor. From bread to dessert, everything I've had I'd gladly have again.",

I have to say we were a little disappointed with our experience. When I first booked the reservation I stated it was our anniversary. That being said, I was expecting special treatment for my wife and I. When we checked in we were told that we could not sit outside although there were plenty of tables. The outside seating had a guitarist and would have set the night in motion. The hostess explained this area was for a large party. Regardless, we decided to give the restaurant a shot. We waited at our table for 15 minutes before our waiter arrived. He was very polite but we were starting on the wrong foot. So we ordered wine and food as we had plenty of time to decide. The wine came out and it was good. The food came out and it was so so. I was expecting something much more for the price we paid. A little a disappointed but I was with my love and we were able to laugh it off. Happy 5 Years! Probably won't come back. Nice waiter though...",

It was actually too cheesy and not the melted kind of cheese, more like a soft cheese.  We had a salad that was mediocre and calamari for appetizer.. that was just ok..  Bread was good wine prices not horrible for a bottle.  I really enjoyed the service though so I think I'd try it again..",

We were seated as soon as we arrived as there were many open tables.   We started with a glass of house wine which was $10 glass. It was drinkable but not great. We both ordered panini sandwiches with house salads, both $14. The bread that was brought out was good, a mix of focaccia and italian. They put way too much balsamic with the olive oil though making it quite bitter and strong.   My panino parma was good but not great. The bread was soft and the thick slices of mozzarella tasted home made and very fresh. They could have put more prosciutto however. My mom said her meatball panini was also good. The house salad was fine as well, again, average or slightly above.   We ordered the cannoli for dessert and since we were told they were small we ordered two. Small was an understatement. They were about 2 bites each and the filling had an odd flavor I didn't care for. They were not sweet at all and at $8 per order way way overpriced. A really expensive lunch for very average food.",

There was a small wait & he was quick to get us a table and apologetic for the wait. We asked for his recommendations. I had the braised short rib special that wasn't on the menu that Sergo suggested & it was AMAZING. We also had the the seafood dish everyone loves and it was great and my other friends sausage ravioli was to die for as well!

Their hours for Saturday say 11-10pm Friday and Saturday I explained. She then told us that they stop seating at 9:15. When I told we've been sat before after 9:30pm on a Saturday, she then said let me ask if a server wants to take you. There was another couple who had just been sat shortly before us with menus in front of them and still no drinks. She then came back to us and told us a server will take you but you have to know what you already want. We looked at her and said that fine we already know. The servers then walked up to the host looking a bit upset. Came and took our order, and was pleasant but you can tell he was trying to rush our service. They still had a full table of ladies drinking bottles of wine and having a party. So my friend and I couldn't understand why we were being treated the way we were. We are both a server and bartender and were very disappointed on how we were treated. We ordered our food and were paid out before 9:50pm. I will be back to eat there, cause the food is great. But never turn away a paying guest when you still have a full Resturant and 45 mins before your stated closing time.",

Then again it's Henderson / the district at green valley so they all dress alike hahaha, so semi casual as well. Seems clean from what I can see again the place is packed so it's hard to tell. Hey have a full on bar although I do not drinks it is there for those who do. They have several tv screens with the sports channel. The decoration is very alive and catchy makes for a good scene. Wooden floors , dual gender restrooms for convenience.  Large staff on the floor so I'm assuming service is great. But it's kind of warm inside i hope its cooler in the dining area.  But other than that I have nothing else to say about the menu or the food I'm currently waiting to be seated....",

    "text": "Took my little sister here the other night for dinner.. I have been here once before and absolutely loved it and thought it would be a good time to try it again. She ordered the veal piccata and I had ordered the seafood risotto which was a special for the night.  Let me start off by saying that the service was phenomenal really good all-around But she didn't really like her veal which I understand was something new for her I really liked it but she just kind of powered through it and ate it because I was paying for dinner and she wanted to be polite.  My meal was a seafood risotto. The small shell fish was cooked fine and the risotto is cooked beautifully,.. however the lobster was not ok. I was really disappointed that the lobster was complete rubber on top of the food. I didn't even eat the lobster. I tried cutting through it and it just wasn't working so I just dumped it in the empty plate that they had where I was supposed to put the shells from the mussels and scallops.  The atmosphere was great...but if you have an introvert in your group like I did don't bring them here because it's going to be a little too loud for them. Next time I'm going to take her to Bottiglia and see if she likes that better.",

Not surprised that they didn't offer crayons. I had a pen in my purse. - Surprised they had a booster seat. - Not surprised that they didn't know what was actually on their kids menu - at the top it says 'all kids meals include a drink'. We ordered a milk... they charged us $3 for the milk as they said it wasn't included. Even McDonalds includes this.  When I showed them the menu, they just said 'sorry' and still charged us $3. Really bad service. They then told us ice cream was included - which wasn't in their menu.   They might serve adults well here, but with children, they're a hot mess. Their management is terrible as they should have removed the milk from the tab based on their menu and courtesy, but were rude about it.",

Couple items ordered didn't make it to the table, one salad and one drink. I asked about 5-6 items on the menu and if they contained any dairy and ended up ordering the spaghetti pomodoro. It arrived covered in cheese, and when i told the waiter he told me that the cheese on top wasn't cheese. He then took it back and had it replaced.

The ambience was lovely, the server, Kenny, was fantastic, and the appetizers (octopus, misto) were decent. The entrees, however, were lackluster. Perhaps we ordered the wrong items. I was told the tagliatelle bolognese was the hottest dish, and it happens to be one of my favorite pastas. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. It was rather dry, over cooked,  and needed a pinch more of salt. My father had the pork chop, and he said it wasn't anything special. My sister did think her cabonara was okay. She said the pancetta was salty, but it complimented the pasta. We had a party of six, but the consensus was underwhelmed. Go for the apps, the bartender was great, Kenny was super accommodating, and the location is just right. Perhaps it could use a little tweaking.",

Only negative, which is minor, is it can get loud because it's a very open dining area and so you will have to sit close to your friends to hear conversation. Some of my favorite dishes include the misto appetizer with the shrimp, calamari and rapini. It's breaded with a red sauce that had a bit of a kick. I love this appetizer the best. I've had the gnocchi bolognese (excellent), osso bucco (also excellent and huge), seafood pasta (excellent), linguini with clams (excellent, nice use of garlic), and even french fries as a side (hot, fresh, crispy and plentiful). My favorite desserts include their cheesecake and of course, tiramisu, both of which were very good. I will definitely go back and recommend this place to others.",

Slow service, bland food, and a chaotic atmosphere make for a restaurant best left to others.  I came here on a Saturday evening. The place was packed, a generally good sign. We were promptly seated, and waited....and waited....and waited. Our server finally showed up and read off a laundry list of specials. Translation: the chef has a lot of food items he needs to get rid of quickly before they spoil.  Our food was served in a reasonable timeframe. While the food itself tastes good, it's nothing memorable nor special. There's nothing that makes the food worthy of the $25-$30 per plate. Save yourself $10 a plate and head over to Olive Garden.  Now, onto the ambience, or rather, the lack thereof. Bella Vita tries very hard to pack as many customers as possible inside. That together with the turnt housewives throwing napkins between tables and live music creates an atmosphere closer to what I'd expect in a 711 in North Las Vegas, not an Italian restaurant in Henderson.  With all the amazing restaurants in Las Vegas, there just is no reason to try Bella Vita. Olive Garden and Applebee's, please STOP HAVING CHILDREN.",

    "text": "Enjoyed Happy Hour at Bella Vita last night with a girlfriend. I made an OpenTable reservation, though it wasn't necessary. I arrived and was told they prefer we sit at the bar for HH which happened to open up just as I arrived. There are three cocktails on the HH menu, I ordered the elderflower one and my friend ordered the blood orange one. We ordered the penne alla vodka and gnocchi alla pesto. The bartender asked if we wanted bread alongside our meal to which we replied yes.   My drink had a freshness to it while my friend's was just sour with nothing to bite the tart. The penne pasta was cooked to less than al dente and we found it to be very dry and lacking flavor. The bread was never brought out and I had to ask for it. The best part of the meal was the gnocchi. The pesto sauce was done beautifully and there was plenty to be able to dip into with the bread. The bartender was very cold and awkward. When I arrived there was a couple seated whom she may have known and she chatted with them the entire time. Each time we asked her for something her lack of facial expression came off as we were inconveniencing her. When I asked if we would still be getting our bread she barely responded let alone said sorry and walked off to grab it.   Happy Hour is really short - only until 6. Would be nice if it was extended to 7. The live music in the back is a nice touch. Ambiance is nice though you don't get to enjoy it sitting at the bar. The outdoor seating area is very inviting for warmer weather.",

Homemade pasta as stated on the menu, voted 2017 for best something, so how bad could this be?  My lasagna came out over a bed of what appears to be non-doctored tomato sauce and leaning like the tower of pisa with layers of pasta exposed.  First impression, first bite not impressed with the flavor and nothing to run home to.  After my third bite I could tell my pasta was under heated and undercooked.  The last layer of pasta was inedible, tough pieces of chewy dough and at last cold meat in the center.  Naturally, I asked for it to be heated up and ate whatever I could that was not chewy dough and left unhappy.  My husband had the tagliatelle meat sauce and added chicken for extra protein.  The pasta was good, but the quality of meat left him unimpressed.    On a brighter note, our water was constantly topped off and the bread was good, but our waiter was just so-so.  Maybe the stars are for the drinks and semi-pleasant ambiance, but definitely not for service and the food.  We came, we tried and we don't think it merits another visit.",

    "text": "Bella Vita is one of those places that could have been something. I came here with my mother and some of her workmates last weekend for early dinner -- and we'd seen this place. Four time winner of Best of Las Vegas, always full of people, and we thought this would be good. Our expectations were high.  To its merit, the restaurant benefits from its location in the District and its open-air patio. Performers often come to serenade diners during the evening, but we arrived too early -- and they were setting up when we left. The service here was also great -- our servers were close by and would be very good at catering to our whims.  That's where it ends, though -- I ordered chicken Marsala, my mother and her friend got linguini with clams, and the other work friend ordered the fritto misto and the caprese. The food only looked good, and not much else -- my Marsala was tasteless, the linguini with clams was too soupy, the fritto was more batter than actual shrimp, and the caprese was not at all fresh. None of us particularly cared for our food -- I tried the work friend's caprese and I retched because it was that bad.  We got a panna cotta to split, and that was decent, but it wasn't enough to really redeem this restaurant. How did it win Best of Las Vegas again? I wanted to love it, but I was left disappointed and still hungry. Others may like this place, but it's not for me.",

I ordered two of their cocktails. The Arancia Rossa (Tito's handmade vodka, cointreau, fresh blood orange) and the Elderflower Bloom (Prairie cucumber vodka, elderflower liquor and prosecco). During happy hour the cocktails are $7. My favorite of the two was the Arancia Rossa because of its fruity flavor.   I visited a Wednesday around 5:00pm and the place was already full. By the time I left (about 7:00pm) the restaurant was still very busy. I suggest making a reservation because there will be a wait time if you visit during this time.",

Unfortunately, the service during my last two visits here was by the same waiter, and it wasn't good. My receipt says his name is \"Barry,\" but I don't know that for a fact. Barry doesn't seem to notice tables with one customer. I've had the same level of (non) service twice now when I've stopped in for a late lunch. Today, there were two tables of four behind me, so I guess that made me invisible. I waited ten minutes after the busboy brought my water and bread before the waiter came to take my order. My food came quickly, and it was good. I wanted to order dessert, but no matter how many times I made eye contact with the waiter, he walked past me like I wasn't there. Another ten minutes of waiting, then I decided I'd just pay my check and get a frozen custard at Shake Shack, next door. I asked for my check when he finally came back, and again, I waited. And waited. I finally asked the busboy to tell my waiter I still needed my check. Still nothing. So I walked to the front desk and told them I didn't have my check. The hostess stopped the waiter as he walked by, and he said, \"Oh!\" Like he was surprised. I paid my check and left. As I mentioned earlier, this was the second time I've had poor service from the same waiter. I don't believe it was personal; I think parties of one just aren't a priority for him. At all. My busboy (whose name I didn't get, but he was young and had a unique haircut), was super friendly and very personable. It's too bad he wasn't my waiter.",

Our waiter came back and just asked what I had found. I told him and he said \"oh my god, I'm sorry.\"  Came back a few minutes later and asked if i wanted it remade or removed from the bill. I told him to just remove it. Still charged gratuity and our other dish.   No supervisor or manager came to apologize. That was it. Disappointed. Saw all the \"Best of Las Vegas\" signs everywhere. We are never coming back here.  Overpriced for the portion sizes. Our Margherita pizza was soggy. The calamari was extremely small.

And it seemed really busy for only one waiter to be working that after one other table was sat, they put up a sign that the restaurant was closed. I'm assuming it's to prep for the dinner crowd though and not because it was really busy.  They give you some warm bread, which was really good.   My husband ordered the meatball panini which he said was \"good\" but doesn't beat the Cappriotti's meatball sub. He also said that for 14 dollars, it seemed a bit on the smaller size.  I had the chicken ravioli with pesto which was really good! The pesto sauce was superb! Although, the color of the chicken looked as though it was from canned chicken. Either way, it tasted good. It's a dinner option but they served it to me during lunch. I didn't even check out the price.  Thurs-Sunday night I believe it says there is live music. I had been at the district before strolling and heard it, and the band seemed good. Don't know if it's the same one every time. This place is definitely worth a try if you're in the area.",

We had beef carpaccio, seafood risotto with lobster, mussels, clams, scallops.   Risotto was perfectly cooked.  The hidden gem was the side of brussel sprouts though.   Really really good.  Dessert was a rich chocolate mousse cake.  Well worth the visit.",

From the beverage selection, appetizers, entrees to dessert, my entire team was amazed at the service, quality and presentation of the food. Many of my team have traveled throughout the world and we all live in different towns across the US so we were amazed to find such a great \"hometown\" place nestled off the Las Vegas strip. Great service, menu, value and staff. GM Nicola Linzi made sure my reservation, table and server were perfect. Thank you and I can't wait to come back!",

She told us she would have a table for us in about 45 minutes. Gave her my cell and she said they would call when the table was ready.  I got the call exactly 45 minutes later. Good so far right?? Got to the restaurant (we were next door shopping while we waited for our table). She proceeds to inform us that we \"could only have the table for an hour because there's a reservation later\".... wait what??? How in the world do you tell me you can get us in and then tell me we have to leave in an hour so you can accommodate someone else??? Why in the world would I sit down and give you my money so you can kick me out an hour later.  So disappointed. We live near the district and have eaten at Bella Vita several times.  No more. I can take my business elsewhere and not be rushed to get out...",

That's good because they had one Chardonnay by the glass, Poppy. Light to medium body - they were out of what I wanted, Sonoma-Cutrer. So had to have a second Martini. I had the Salmon, which was Great. Hubby had the Lasagna. Way TOO cheesy with a layer of fat skimming the surface. Won't get that again. Hubby also had a side of Brussel Sprouts with Pancetta. Good thing, they were fabulous . Waiter & buss staff were excellent . Hostess needs to get a personality or stay home.",

We ordered, and my boyfriend ordered the pork chop, and it was raw. He sent it back and they returned it to the table. Two more bites into it, and it was still raw. He called the waiter over. The server was apologetic and tried to get the manager who was too busy to look at the plate. The waiter did not offer another option or even to give us dessert. They did take the raw pork off the bill. As we walked to the car we felt we owed the owner the courtesy of letting him know that we were served raw pork twice. We went back in spoke to the hostess and waiter, but the owner was still too busy to address the concern. It is a shame as we like to frequent local places, but certainly won't be going back there.",

The staff - both bar staff, and waitstaff, were incredibly friendly, helpful and attentive.  The portions of the food were very large - my wife got the Osso Bucco, and I got the Tagliatelle with Bolognese sauce.  We could have shared the Osso Bucco, it was such a large filling portion.  The food was delicious.  I just came from West Hollywood, and the food here is every bit as good as top Italian restaurants in LA.  I think that people get offended when they are charged a lot of money for dinner, and this place is certainly not cheap.  They serve great food, and great drinks, and they charge a lot of money to eat here.  I understand that if you cannot afford to eat here, it might offend you.  My pasta dish (which was wonderful) was $18 dollars.  Cocktails were $11 - $13 dollars.  Everything was great.  If that is outrageously expensive for you, perhaps you should find a place that meets your budget.",

I chose to have their Belavita salad which is on the small side for the price. It came with hearts of palm but they were few and far between. About a quarter of an avocado should've had at least been half of one. Not something I would order again. My friend ordered a glass of wine that was $8.00 but the server told her she could bring her something that she would like much better. My friend did enjoy the wine but when she got her check she noticed The price of the wine had gone from $8.00 to $14. When it was brought to the servers attention she said she could adjust the check to reflect the original $8.00 glass. Then when it was time for the server to bring her change she brought the correct amount in bills but she neglected to bring her $.69 in coins. We thought it was very presumptuous of her to assume she wouldn't want ALL her change. I've never been to a restaurant where they only gave you part of your change back. So she made it part of her tip. Doubt I'll be going back there again.",

The bolognese was referred to as hamburger helper and really it was an accurate description.  The lasagna special was similarly flavored.  Both were delivered cold to our table and had to be sent back.  They have an open kitchen and we could see the cook's offended reaction when our server presented the food back to him. We shared a pizza for an appetizer and it was good; not great...also not very hot; but we didn't complain.  It was a cold night and the door wasn't closing properly so we dined with our coats on. The owner came by and was disgruntled about the door; but we had to request him to turn up the heat...why didn't he think of that?  Nor did he ask us about our food or dining experience...missed opportunity sir.  The place has a nice vibe and a great little bar...I'd go back for a drink and maybe an appetizer or pizza; but not going to pay for another disappointing dinner.  Hope they can improve; we'd like to have a new restaurant in the neighborhood.",

I asked my meal to be prepared without onions or peppers, which they did and was very accommodating.   The dishes were delicious and prepared perfectly.   My complements to Bella Vista. We will definitely be back many times!!",

The hostess said she would fix it, but forgot & didn't take care of it until the end of our meal.  Drinks were empty for some time.  Our meals also took almost 40 minutes to come out.  I ordered salmon, which was forgettable.  The salmon I season & bake from Smith's is better.  Meals were a little on the pricey side; came out to about $40 per person.  I don't mind paying more if the quality is there, but it was average.  We will head back to Bottiglia at GVR for date nights.",

Nicola is the only wonderful of the restaurant that remains the same.  And the Penne alla Vodka.   No longer friendly bartender service.  One word:  Attitude.  A friend of mine ordered the Prosciutto Flatbread for us on HH menu.  It came out dry, no mushroom or cheese.  I have had it twice before.  It usually comes with the long strand of Prosciutto, like you get in the grocery, SLICED along the flat bread.  Not today.  They sliced the flatbread & laid the Prosciutto acrossed.  Uncut.  No mushrooms or cheese.    Melissa who's our usual favorite bartender says that's how it's always been served & is served that way in Italy.  I've never had it served in this ridiculous way.  Even Mario who is from Sicily couldn't believe it & sent it back.  Too many excellent restaurants in Vegas for this inconsistency & rudeness.    HH is usually great such as my previous reviews here.  Regulars & referrals make your business so no reason for this kind of attitude even before we sent back the flatbread. However, after this many tries, you won't see me again.",

The small bar and other tables were packed but they ended up finding a spot for us in just a couple of minutes.   The food is underwhelming. It's fine, but not for the prices. It seems like they are charging higher prices because they can get away with it, but the quality of the food isn't really there. It made me feel like I was in a random cafe or a cheesecake factory in a casino on the strip that gauges prices because of location. Like I said - every other restaurant was packed that Friday night. I'd probably be willing to try the happy hour but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back.   3.5 stars is probably a more accurate review, but I'm going to round up. The happy hour seems decent. They got us in and out pretty quickly during a busy time even though we had to wave down our waiter a couple of times and the food came quickly.",

I had the Frutti Di Mare but I couldn't even finish my pasta as the noodles were waaaay too chewy & underdone. Also, a lot of the clams & muscles had grit in them. I wanted to love this dish but was disappointed. My friend had the linguine with clams & her noodles were right at al dente.   Serivce was so-so. Our server was not so attentive & took forever to not only get us the check but to pick it back up as well.   On the bright side, they had an amazing blood orange Bellini on the menu. So I would only recommend for them their cocktails!",

We were immediately greeted by one of the servers, Barry and we were treated instantly like VIP's. The veal piccata and osso bucco were exceptional, homemade and fresh, nicely prepared. The Brunello wine was excellent and the complimentary dessert, panna cota was creamy and delicious.   I really appreciate not only excellent food but also excellent service. Barry even brought by Sergio, the owner to introduce us to him. Returning 5 days later, we just wanted cocktails and an appetizer. Barry immediately greeted us again and remembered my name. He then brought Nicola, the general manager over to meet ya. The gnocchi appetizer was so fresh it melts in your mouth. Paired with the bolognese sauce was so delicious!  The live band was excellent and played great music from 80's tKudos to this local Italian restaurant!",

There was music playing, people talking, and the smells were flowing. It was very beautiful and they still had their tree up from the holidays. My friend and I got out and walked in wile my partner parked the car. I walked up to the smiling hostess and put my name in for a table of 3. The wait was an estimated 25 minutes. We didn't mind waiting so we sat down and enjoyed the live music.   My partner came in and informed them that we had a reservation (which I had no idea about) and they set up a table and had us seated in less than 3 minutes. (I counted)  Food came out quickly and everything was spectacular, Hell, the bread they started us off with was soft and delicious!  We ordered the Calamari, the Tartufata Pizza, the Chicken Parmigiana, and the Eggplant Parmigiana.   We all enjoyed our entrees and made sure everyone had tasted each other's dishes. They were beautiful plated and tasted just as good! We were stuffed but we couldn't turn down the Tiramisu!   I ended up taking home 3/4 of my pizza and plenty of pasta!    My favorite thing was easily the Alfredo sauce on the noodles my partner got. Not only was it delicious, but the texture wasn't runny and it held on to the noodles in a loving embrace that could only be understood with the tastebuds.",

I woke up in the middle of the night with severe stomach pains and so nauseated I thought I was going to throw up... While someone else was violently sick the next day! Another gluten intolerant person actually had a gluten test with her which determined the fish contained gluten. This restaurant needs to be reminded WTF gluten is, that's for sure.

A little disappointed on that aspect considering I didn't know any better, nor would the next customer.   Anyways, I decided on the chicken Marsala, and my mom ordered the margherita pizza. My Marsala was lovely, very flavorful, however a tad too garlicky. The vegetables were perfect, and the demiglaze on the chicken offered a very robust flavor. The pizza was delicious, very hearty. We brought the leftover pizza home and put it in the oven for a few minutes, and that made it taste even better!   Very cozy atmosphere inside and outside. There are outdoor heaters if you prefer to sit outside. I do not have any complaints other than to reflect your current menu items.   Will return!",

Their HH menu includes discounted wines and a large variety of $7 small plates.  Their house cab was a solid pick, and according to their social media, you can get a free glass of wine with an entree purchase- so come on a day when you can imbibe. My friend prefers the Duck Horn Merlot, which was very good.  We shared about half of their small plates menu, 5 of their 12 offered dishes. While the portion sizes for the pasta dishes were a good value, some of the others didn't seem like a great deal. The bolognese pasta and the shrimp scampi were the best of what we tried, while the calamari, meatballs, and burrata were average to underwhelming.   I would come back to try more of their HH specials or for a dinner date. I especially want to try their special star-shaped pizza that I've heard good things about. They have a shaded outdoor patio with live music, perfect for warmer weather.",

So it caught my eye that I should try this place next time... 1 week later, our anniversary.. we're walking around green valley/thedistrict and decided to eat here. It was not what I expected at all. I could've made pasta at home for cheaper the price and felt satisfied.  We order chicken alfredo and bolognese.  The easiest things you can make off the menu. Chicken alfredo, didnt taste good. The sauce wasnt creamy and the chicken was like little pieces that wouldve been in a ceasar salad. And my bolognese, though the sauce was ok. The noodles were so disappointing!! I've been on a keto diet. So if im gonna eat the noodles.. It better be good. It was over cooked, broken easily. texture was so soft that it didnt feel like I was eating noodles at all.. just super disappointed.  I ate some carbs for nothing. And for that price I should've just went to Bottiglia Enoteca inside green valley casino.",

An ltalian restaurant that toasts sliced Wonder bread and serves it with good OO & vinegar, what?  We ordered several of their small plates.  The pasta with Sauce was good, so was bruschetta.  The antipasto was tasteless, even the olives, as was the Caesar's salad.  Service was spotty, our waiter could hardly be bothered with us.  The busboy and l'd guess manager were more helpful.  We also ordered a pizza, which was tasteless.    Please, go to Settebellos which is just across GVP and has much better food and service for a lot less $$.",

The salad was lovely, the chicken parmesan very good and the seafood risotto was okay. The lobster tail was so small it was exceedingly difficult to get the meat out and very messy. However the flavor was excellent. We shared the tiramisu for dessert which was very good. This time the coffee was not as bitter and the cappuccino perfect. This time the only issues are: as the manager who gave us this meal on the house was in fact in the restaurant it would have been appropriate to stop by our table. The server once he realized the meal was on the house drop the plates commenting to us that the meal was free and suddenly had an attitude. The server should realize One tips on service and as much as I wanted to leave nothing as he deserved after that snide comment nothing there were enough other servers who assisted him that I wanted to make sure at least they got something. So the second time the food was definitely better but where they still need work is on their staff.",

She had been having a tough time eating out because she doesn't get to enjoy all of the offerings like her brothers and sister.  However, Barry made this lunch exceptional and made her feel special.  We come in there often and enjoy the staff.  We will keep coming back and highly recommend this place to our friends.  I run a resort in town and understand exceptional service.

The Bella Vita salad is very tasty, even a meat lover would like it. I love it because of the hearts of palm,  avocado and the dressing brings it all together. I wish they sold the dressing to take home. The meatballs are PERFECTION. The are very soft and fluffy. I'm a meatball lover, so I know a good meatball.   The service is good, and most of the waiters have an Italian or foreign accent. I actually love that because it makes me feel like I'm dining in an authentic Italian restaurant. Adds to the dining experience.   The prices are reasonable for the amazing quality of dishes prepared. It's not cheap (nor is it cheap food) but it's not over the top expensive either (even though it tastes like it could be).   The reason I knocked off a star is because it is so very loud in the restaurant. It's a big room, with high ceiling and hard floors, that the acoustics really make everyone talking at once very loud. It's very hard to hear the person dining across from you that basically you have to yell to have a conversation. I can see on the ceiling they put some padding to help with quieting down the restaurant, but it is still very loud. And the music is pumped loud too. Even my 4 year old daughter said that she did not enjoy eating there because it was so loud. I'm not sure if there is a fix for it, kinda is what it is, so it's just something to be aware of. Especially if you have someone in your group that may be hard of hearing.   Nonetheless, we absolutely love the food and will continue to order frequently from Bella Vita using UberEats.",

    "text": "It's been a few years since I wrote my original review based on lunch and now I've been back for dinner and Happy Hour. Bella Vita is a solid option for either at The District.  My favorite part of this restaurant is the patio. It's perfect for outdoor dining on a nice day or evening. It's situated mostly down the side of the restaurant so it's protected from most traffic noise. The restaurant has had live music on a few of my visits that created a lovely ambiance.  Dinner in the dining room was a nice experience. They are often busy for weekend dinner so I'd definitely recommend a reservation. We received excellent service for dinner. The Antipasto Misto was delicious with a great variety of meats, cheeses, and other cheese plate goodies. I enjoyed my Chicken Puttanesca and my husband enjoyed his Veal Parmesan.   On my most recent visit I came in for Happy Hour and absolutely loved it. It was a beautiful day so the patio was the perfect place to relax with good food. The Happy Hour Menu offers an impressive selection of dishes that can definitely be put together for a full meal. The drink side of the menu offers half a dozen different wines, some cocktails, and several beers. The $5 Peroni was shockingly generous.   From the Happy Hour Menu here's what we enjoyed. Our favorites were the Gnocchi al Pesto (perfectly cooked), Caprese Salad (that balsamic glaze!), and Meat Balls (well seasoned with plenty of delicious red sauce to dip bread into). The Penne Alla Vodka was missing something in the flavor profile, but I couldn't put my finger on specifically why it lacked flavor. The Shrimp Scampi had perfectly prepared shrimp with a decent sauce, but with only three shrimp it wasn't worth $7 like the rest of the dishes. Not on the Happy Hour menu, but an excellent choice was the Spumoni for dessert. The gelatos, chocolate shell, and sauces were so good!",

We start off with a black ink pasta with shrimp then had the Belavida salad and finished off with the braised short rib and pasta it was really next level a must try. It offers a full-service bar and live music to add more to the enchanting atmosphere",

I will say my red wine was at correct temperature. Also, angel hair was al dente.   Personal note.. WHY does every restaurant put too much dressing on the salad??!!! Just a quick note to back of house and management... you can always add more, you cannot take away dressing. Start small, add as you go.. put on side... etc etc. (I did ask for lite dressing, in case you were wondering )   Still, had a great time. Loved the patio and live music. I will try it again.",

    "text": "I really wanted to leave five stars but there was only one thing that made it so I couldn't. I ordered the zucca ravioli which was butternut ravioli in a butter sauce. My main complaint with it was, the last ravioli I ate was cold and very undercooked. I figured it was the last ravioli so there's no point in saying anything at that point.   Now on to the reasons this restaurant should be five stars! It's a very cozy, smallish restaurant at the green valley district. The service was top notch. I couldn't believe how swift they were to fill our drinks, bring out bread and food and take our orders. We never had to wait for anything or try to flag them down. Loved it! I've actually never been to a restaurant that was so on top of everything.   The bread and oil was good and just the right amount. The food was very authentic and a lot of it made from scratch. The veal Parmesan was super tasty and the spaghetti with it was perfect, the sauce was delicious. Aside from my little complaint about the ravioli, it was good. It was almost like a dessert it was so sweet. Speaking of dessert, we wanted to try one that was actually made by the restaurant so we went with the tiramisu. Oh so amazing!!! It was definitely worth ordering and savoring every yummy bite.   Since I checked in on yelp we received 20% off one entree. Sweet!",

    "text": "Had a delicious meal here the other night.  Would definitely come back, but there were a few missteps along the way.  The good.  The food.  All of the food our table ordered was delicious.  I had the chicken ravioli which tasted so fresh and light.  Others at in my group had butternut squash ravioli, veal parm, and squid ink pasta with shrimp.  Everyone loved their dish!    The meh.  My husband and I shared the meat and cheese platter for an appetizer.  The meats were good, the only cheese was a delicious mozzarella, some artichokes, olives and peppers.  It also came with two, ONLY TWO small crostinis.   Definitely need more bread and cheeses to make this expensive appetizer worth it.  The bad.  The restaurant is LOUD.  Not just a little, a lot.  Could not hear my friend across the 4-person table.  To make it worse, they had live music.  The music was outside, but they were also playing it inside.  The singer was like a bad Vegas lounge singer, and did not contribute to the environment.  Maybe have the live music outside, and not heard inside?  The odd.  We were at this beautiful restaurant with all these amazing hand made pastas and sauces, and when we were offered Parmesan cheese.. they brought us a shaker with what seemed like Kraft Parmesan Cheese in it.  This may be just a little nit-picky, and I understand they have pizza on the menu, but when I am paying $30 for a pasta dish, I expect a the little details to be elevated.  If I wanted Kraft Parmesan in a shaker, I would go to Pizza Hut.    Overall, we enjoyed our meal.  I would definitely go back.  They had some damn tasty pasta.",

    "text": "Dined with a group of 10 on a busy Friday night. Make sure to get reservations, it's a bustling restaurant! Arriving a few minutes early, they had a table all ready for us. We requested patio seating with this lovely weather, and it did not disappoint, between the nice evening air and the live singer/acoustic guitarist. A+ for ambiance.  Started with some wines for the table; would recommend the Tobin James cabernet. Our server did a good job splitting our salads and getting everyone's orders correct, but lacked a je n'ais se quoi. He seemed put-off by our group for whatever reason, so that was a bummer. However, the assistants were very gracious about our needs (extra salad dressing, water/soda refills, etc...)  Food- the arugula/apple/blue cheese salad on the special menu was delicious. Arugula with crisped slab bacon, apples, blue cheese, hearts of palm and a sweet/tangy dressing, it hit all the notes. The house bread was also good and delivered with EVOO/Balsamic to dip. I tried both the gnocchi and the tagliatelle in the bolognese, and would order either again. The gnocchi were pillowy; the tagliatelle noodles were my favorite, though. Can't pass up a homemade pasta noodle!  I did have to send my Cioppino soup back. This dish is a scrap, as it was. The \"broth\" was more of a thicker tomato sauce and the bowl had hot spots, as though reheated. The fish was rubbery, off-tasting and tough to get through, also, as if nuked. They assured us that wasn't the case, and took the plate back but seemed perturbed and argued over my observation. I apologized profusely, as I typically don't send my dishes back. As a diner, I felt the server could have handled it a lot more graciously, as it was embarrassing.  Finally, I left my phone at the table, and realized just down the street, turned around and sure enough they host stand had it ready-in-waiting. I really appreciated that. Overall there were some high-high's and low-low's so I'll meet you in the middle. ;)",

We felt like the server was too busy serving other tables around us and mingling with them.  He stayed maximum of 3 minutes to \"chit chat\" with us, but you can see him paying more attention to the other tables.  Were all for great service, and we didn't get it from here.  I guess we got used to other servers who take their time to greet us, make sure our waters were filled, make sure we don't need anything else..etc.",

    "text": "I went to a restaurant in the district one evening & wanted to hit up GVR after so my friend & I was walking thru the district & we passed by this place & we noticed that they do happy hour on the weekend so we decided to hit this place up the following Saturday. (HH 2pm-5pm). Great thing is HH is served in the dinning room area (which is an open area inside the restaurant), bar & outside patio. LOVE that option!! Gives you more room if you want to go with a small group of people.   It was actually a nice day out the day my friend & I hit this place up on Saturday @ 2pm. Wasn't busy yet & we grabbed seats at the bar. At this time there was only one bartender who had to serve the whole place which kinda made getting drinks a little slow. But he knew how to make them! Once a couple more friends showed up we inquired about moving outside. My friend went up to the hostess & asked for a table on the patio & was told they didn't have any @ the time so then I went up to get us on a wait list & a man tells me they have a table. I mentioned that my friend was just up here & was told there wasn't any. He said she didn't see it cause it was in the back. The outside area isn't that big so not sure why she didn't see the table in the back? So anyways we got that, there was 4 of us & I had a few more friends coming & the table next to us became empty & I asked if we could have that one too & the hostess had asked if the others were here yet & I said \"no, they're in route.\" She looked @ me like she was lost & told me I couldn't because they weren't here. Then one of the girls walked in so then I told her that one person was here & if we could have the table now & she said \"yes.\" Then another friend showed up so those two waited at the bar for the table to be cleaned then we put the two tables together & 2 more of my female friends showed up so we had a nice little group of 8 ladies.   Once the first 4 of us sat down outside our waitress came right over. Service was good outside, was quick & we didn't have to wait too long & the waitress was patient with us considering a few other girls came shortly after.   They have a great HH menu (see posted pic of it). Prices are great, lots of options & food portions are a great size! I had the meatballs & they were yummy & tasted homemade. The salads my friend's got looked delicious & they were not disappointed. Everyone enjoyed their food & drinks.   I'm so happy I happened to walk by this place cause I had never heard of it before & I definitely will be back for HH & HIGHLY recommend you go & check this place out too!!!! While the weather is nice & not too hot you should head on down on a nice day & sit outside. Eventually another bartender came on duty so the drinks coming out weren't so slow anymore!",

We ordered the special of the short ribs at $36, the chicken parmigiana at $26, and the avocado salad $14.  Sadly, the food was very bland.  We did not enjoy our meal at all.  I was really looking forward to this dinner out and was pretty disappointed.  I left feeling like it was overpriced and I could find better.  Not only that but once I produced my coupon for buy one entree get the 2nd for 50% off, the waiter's whole attitude changed towards me.  He took my coupon and said he needed to speak with management and left me waiting for nearly 15 minutes.  Once he returned, he said very annoyed,  that I could use it (which I knew)  I still gave a good tip as the other men working were great filling our glasses and checking in.  Sadly, we won't be returning.",

I like that about any place- but the food and cocktails in this place put it above the other restaurants around this area of town.   Some suggestions:  The meatballs, the salmon, the sangria...I haven't had anything bad.  Its the perfect time of year right now to gather some friends and sit out on the patio for happy hour.",

Check pricing on wine here, my glass was $20, bottled water $8. I'm not picky and I've eaten here once before with no issues but this was beyond disappointing.",

Service was great and while they didn't have a ton of allergy friendly options, even for the happy hour menu I was able to get the vegetarian salad which came without cheese naturally I believe. They did know that the salad dressing had gluten so I just asked them to bring it without and then that I would just use olive oil and vinegar.  I haven't read their regular menu but pretty sure everything they have is great and my family had the vodka pasta and arrabiata the spicy one and there was no leftovers everyone finished everything they ordered.",

The bartender , first l, forgot my glass of wine ( I got halfway into my dinner) then she messed up my order , (it was served to another table, )then  they tried to Serve half of it to me, I send it back bc I didn't want something that was served else where.  Nobody checked on us as far as how did the food tasted. Being in the restaurant industry for over 10 years let me tell you. This is not a place I would recommend . As far as service.  Go down to Me Gusta Tacos ...your meal will be half the price and more enjoyable, at least the staff is happy to be there !",

We ordered Linguini with Clams (White Sauce) and a Gnocchi Alla Bolognese. My linguini was fairly mediocre. The clams were there, but barely. I'm not sure if I'd ever seen clams that small before. The gnocchi was bad. The dish was cool and the gnocchi itself was soggy and squishy.  The servers very accommodatingly replaced the gnocchi with another dish that was okay.  Overall, an unfortunate experience at a very nice location. We don't mind higher prices if the quality is there, it just doesn't feel like it here.",

I could have had 20 of them. The service was great - the girl at the bar was very attentive and friendly. AND they have those hooks at the bottom of the bar table!

The noise level was like a cacophony of sounds from plates and glasses clanking, strange folk music playing at the front and children crying. It was so loud we could not hear each other speak and we rushed through our meal just to get out. Being next to the kitchen was very hot and the people passing to use the restroom was distracting. We will never return. Our special evening was ruined.",

    "text": "Made reservations to sit on the patio.  When I arrived, the hostess told me they did not accept reservations on the patio.  I noticed that half the tables were empty so I inquired about sitting there.  She said they were reserved.  But, \"you said that you didn't take reservations on the patio\"  \"Well, those are reserved\".  I should have left at that point.  I waited at the bar and had a happy hour scotch on the rocks.  It was the smallest pour I have ever received (basically flavored ice).  My group was finally seated (at a table that had been empty the whole time).  We ordered the calamari appetizer off the happy hour menu.  It amounted to approx. 5 pieces of calamari that looked like it was left over from the previous customers.  I told the waiter it was unacceptable and he apologized and offered me a larger portion off the regular menu.  When he brought it back (in approx. 30 seconds), it was clear they had put the same portion on a bigger plate!..I ordered the lasagna which looked really good when it arrived.  The only problem was, they forgot to cook it!  When I say it was cold I am not exaggerating.  It was straight from the fridge.  Again, I sent it back and when it returned it was barely warm.  Again, more apologies.  At this point I knew it was a lost cause.  Basically, it's a pretty restaurant with nice service.  Other than that the kitchen is a disaster, the food is mediocre, the hostess is clueless.",

It was my moms birthday and Sergio (I think he's the manager...not sure) treated her as if she was his own mom. Great service.   We ordered one of the specials which was the Seafood Risotto. Amazing! Nothing overpowering about this dish. Then fish was perfect, not chewy, and the sauce with Risotto was seasoned just right. The next dish was the Lobster Ravioli. It was very tasty, however there were only 6 or 7 on the dish. Next was the linguini with calms (white sauce). Again, cooked just right and not over bearing. Good amount of calms as well.   The only negative thing I have to say was after dinner we decided to head outside to the bar area. I approached the bar to get a few drinks and the bartender working there ( didn't get his name) was a complete ass. He was rude and obviously couldn't handle the bar was, even though it's a very small bar with about 8 people actually sitting there. He may have been new. Even the restaurant was not super busy. I guess he didn't realize we spent over $200 on dinner. The outside wasn't managed very well. We finally got service and got our drinks.   I would definitely return but not sit at the bar unless it's a different bartender.",

    "text": "Meh. Best thing about this place was the price point compared to the Strip. Husband and I came here after touring the GVR area. I wanted to go to the other pizza place across the street, but he convinced me it was a long walk and we should try this place. The ambiance is nice. Place was pretty empty, but it was off hours on a Thursday, so understandable. Ordered the Zingara pizza with salami, onions, red peppers. It was seriously lacking in the red pepper department...I think I saw 2 on the whole pie. It was also DRIPPING with oil, literally. I held up each slice to drain the oil off the top before I ate it. Ew.   Husband had the spaghetti and meatballs...meatballs were an extra $7! Sauce was watery and I didn't think it was anything special. So much for a $22 dish.   My pizza was only $12 I think for lunch, so that was a decent deal. It was overall fine, but not anywhere we'd come back to.   They do have HH 3-6pm I believe, and a nice outdoor patio area. Maybe that would have been the way to go?",

It is also a small step from my front door,  then an expensive flight to my moms house.   There is really no big difference between lunch or dinner, The food is just that good; however one does get entertainment from a guitar player at night.   Short Ribs  -simply to die for.  Lasagna. -nature's most perfect food.   Taglioni - fresh! naturally!  made right there from the hands of the brilliant chefs.    Tiramisu , Cheesecake, dolce tutti.

Moreover, the food is excellent, scratch made and served a the perfect temp. The food is presented  very well ( see pictures) but most importantly it  is simply delicious. As a side note - it's rare that I score any one place 5 stars but this place earned every star.   Well I returned once again, and the food was just as good as I remember it- interestingly one new development. As the food came out I found myself enjoying the smell of the pasta as much as the taste. It's something that we sometimes forget but it's still significant - how often do you enjoy the aroma of fine food.... think about?",

We noticed there were two managers (one of them named Sergio, which \"kudos\" to him for understanding what the food & beverage industry is all about, he's great but his staff definitely needs more training...) the two managers on duty kept checking on all the tables which was a nice but maybe they shoulda been checking on their servers more to ensure they provided a better customer experience to their guest.

Service was indeed great. That was probably the best part. Food and drink offerings, just meh.  As we walked up, there was live music on the patio, but the little band was playing \"Macarena\". Weird. lol  I dined with a certified sommelier who of course wanted to order a nice bottle of wine. We were informed that the sparkling rose only came in twist-top splits. Fair enough, I guess. Let's just say I've had way better from the bottom shelf at WalMart.  The warm bread was nice and fresh, but I wish they'd mix the oil and balsamic in a shallower dish/plate, because I kept getting just oil & ruining the lovely bread. *sad face*  I ordered the chicken ravioli. Kinda mushy and lacking in flavor. I think the pesto sauce was a little too creamy, drowning out everything else. My date had the gnocchi bolognese. Looked pretty good, but he said it was just okay.  Now for the main event: Tiramisu!!! I absolutely love tiramisu, so I had to try. It finally got to the table and looked delicious. So pretty and promising...Then first bite. Just okay (running theme here). Very heavy on the custard and not enough alcohol/espresso/ladyfinger lavishness. A much lighter version than what I'm used to.  Bae ordered the creamy limoncello, which was interesting, as neither of us had ever had a creamy version, so we wouldn't know what to compare it to.  At the end of the day, I'd probably come back for happy hour to try the blood orange cocktail, but no rush.",

The loud, bright, open air seating wasn't what we expected, but were still game to try some good food.   Upon checking in, I informed the host we had 5:15pm reservations. They didn't bother checking and just seated us. I later got an email that they canceled our reservations, for not showing up?   My date ordered a nice Pinot. The waiter stated another wine was much much more popular and she should try it instead, which she did. I ordered a house Chianti. He stated in that case I should try the 'house' favorite. Little did I know the waiter upsold us to double the price of what we'd requested. He then pressured us to add appetizers. We declined...several times.   I was hoping the food would be good, but was average at best. Pasta was dry and bland. I couldn't track the waiter down for more bread. But that didn't matter as my plate was taken away before I was finished eating.   Upon paying, I used a coupon for a free entree. Instead of taking the lesser $18 entree off the bill, he deducted $9. Frustrated, we ended up leaving early. I wanted to rate this establishment high, but felt conned and candidly, an evening I'd like to forget.",

They have an indoor/outdoor bar that is a very cool feature (at least maybe until the vegas summers arrive). In the spring, the outdoor patio provides for great people watching and a little bit of a European feel.   The service was great as well, and it seemed staffed with real Italians! Or at least they had me fooled. I hope the guy that set my plate down didnt judge be when I replied \"bueno\" to his \"como sta?\" And  \"gracias\" to his \"bon appetit\"... so sue me, I didnt brush up on my Italian first.  As for the food, I started with calamari: small portions here and nothing too special. For entree moved to  the linguine with clams, which was very good. Came with clams in shell which also confirmed they didn't get them from a can whixh  is always nice (but certainly to be expected if you are paying $21 for it). All in all a good sauce, good amount but nothing fancy.  Overall a memorable meal, if a little overpriced for what it is. A OK food and a nice ambiance and great service makes it a 4 star for me.",

I have not been in a place with so much inattentiveness for an \"Italian\" restaurant in my life.  But it doesn't get better. I ordered chicken Marsala and my wife ordered ravioli.  The Marsala wasn't bad. My wife ordered ravioli. What she got were the flattest ravioli ever. I had never even heard of flat ravioli before. They were like flat pasta disks swimming in some type of cream sauce.  The waiter removed it from the bill thankfully when we complained but I'm thinking if you can't do ravioli, you can't really be an Italian restaurant.  She got a steak instead and it was over cooked.    To salvage what I could, I ordered desert. They called it, New York Style cheese cake to share. After two bites we left it on the table. Not sure what that was but all I could envision was a Duncan Hines box. No fresh graded cheese and no water refill. Yep, Bella Vita is all hat and no cattle.  I payed the 106 bucks on the check and left. Totally disillusioned and unsatisfied.",

We had a bit of a wait for our table, the place was packed so that tells me, the dinner will not disappoint. Our waitress was great! She told us about the specials and immediately took our drink orders. We ordered an app of shrimp scampi, served different than what I have had before, but was delish. We also order the special apple salad, which had arugula, hearts of palm, apples and more. My husband ordered the salmon which was cooked perfect. I ordered the beef carpaccio which is always a favorite of mine, and it was just as good as others served around town. They have an outdoor patio with lots of seating. Looking forward to returning this spring and dine al fresco.",

I just did pick up and take out because it's so close to where I live but if you do go I think you would want to try to make a reservation because both times I've been there the place looks extremely packed. But again the food is delicious so that makes sense. Price is a little high for takeout but if you're craving some good Italian I would highly recommend this place.",

    "text": "I'm surprised I haven't been to this place earlier given how often I pass by it. I would call it upscale casual Italian dining. The hosts are quick to welcome you and generally you do not need a reservation. Although I do recommend calling ahead if you do have a specific date/time in mind because the place can fill up quickly.  Food is traditional Italian fare and they execute it quite well. I recommend the fettuccine alfredo as it is creamy and rich as it's supposed to be. The pizza is classic Neapolitan style. Thin crust, robust Mariana sauce and slices of mozzarella for the topping. The calamari comes to a close second to the best of my calamari experiences. Not chewy, light battered crust and served with lemon. The antipasti is ok. Good to go with wine as it has sliced meats, cheeses and olives.   Ambiance is intimate and would be a good place for a date. Pricing is just a tad high, but I think befitting considering the service is attentive and live music is available on weekends. Highly recommend.",

We asked to be seated outside because it has a nice little patio.  The hostess seated us right next to the exit gate where everyone comes in and out from. Also within 10 mins the band sets up right next to our table as well. And when I say next to I really me so close that I can reach out and touch his keyboard. The band kept apologizing to us for bumping into our table. Also the server that we had was pretty awful. He never checked in on us to refill our drinks and only came to give us our check. Now I will give this place a 3 star due to the food actually tasting pretty delicious and the nice design of the place. I hope that if I ever decide to come back that the service will be better",

When we arrived the staff was so friendly and knowledgeable. When I told them I didn't want pasta they suggested several great options. I went with the filet mignon, the meat was so tender and seasoning was perfect, it melted like butter in my mouth. For dessert I had thier pennacotta, and it was delicious. The live music was a special touch and overall had a great experience. This will definitely be among my top threes.",

David, our server, came by almost immediately to take the drink orders and go over the specials. He strongly rec'd the seafood risotto special. I'm not a fan of scallops. No problem says David, they will pull out the scallops and add in extra shrimp. And so they did. The focal point of the dish was the lobster tail in an opened shell in the middle of the dish. Perfect!!! Presentation with a perimeter of mussels and clams. All of a bed of risotto with a very tasty sauce. David did not lie. This is truly an outstanding dish. My wife went with the veal marsala. Also excellent. Service throughout the meal was close to perfect. At the end of the meal, David brought by a small glass of Lemoncello for each of us courtesy of the manager. Nice touch!! So why not 5 stars? My buddy ordered the lasagna. He was very disappointed - mediocre at best. They do have a Yelp check in offer. A little strange - 20% off your first order. They explained it to be 20% off the second most expensive entree ordered. Also a nice touch. An excellent addition to Green Valley Village Walk. We will definitely be back again.",

The server was not knowledgeable also. I asked what was in their pasta primavera  and he named off veggies like I asked a weird question. In the list of veggies he mentioned green beans and broccoli. Sounded really odd but I ordered the Pasta Primavera anyway to give their version a try. I'm aware I am picky when it comes to Italian food being that I am Italian and grew up eating great Italian food in NY. But first thing I noticed was the large amount of oil in the light tomato sauce. Ordering Pasta Primavera I'm expecting a light dish. This was super heavy. Rich tasting in olive oil overpowering the taste of tomatoes. Not what I expected at all. Also, there was no broccoli or green beans like the server mentioned. The only good part of the visit was the busser/runner. She was quick to refill drinks and take empty plates. Server in the other hand, we barely saw him.",

Unfortunately, after eating at Belle Vita he is still recovering from food poisoning this Sunday morning. Classic food poisoning started a few hours after we got home from dinner. The only thing we didn't share was his chicken marsala. Bad chicken? Mushrooms? I called the restaurant to let them know yesterday, and was told there wasn't a manager or anyone I could speak to. I hope the hostess who answered the phone passed the info to the cooks and no one else had their weekend ruined. It just goes to show you, even if a place is trendy, busy, and in a good location doesn't mean they necessarily have safe food handling procedures.

We were completely underwhelmed with all of the food, to include a pizza, a pasta dish, an appetizer,  and a salad.  The food was not awful, it just wasn't special or something like what a professional chef might make--I'm not a stellar cook and I could have fixed all of these dishes at home.   I should also mention, those items plus two drinks, cost $63 for lunch, not including tip.    Our waiter, while nice, was terrible.  He would leave and not return for 10, 15 minutes.  He brought our food and was about to leave, we had to point out we needed refills on our drinks and silverware.  He did not know what was supposed to be in my salad when I asked. We had to track him down to get our bill, as he apparently started setting up new tables inside.  I'm not sure if it was short-attention-span-theater or what, as they appeared to have plenty of staff and only a few occupied tables.  A real let down on several fronts.",
