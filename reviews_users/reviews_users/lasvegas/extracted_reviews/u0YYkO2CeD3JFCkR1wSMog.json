I have been in Vegas for about a week now for a convention and out of all the restaurants, this place by far had the best service. I came with 3 people and we did a tapas style dinner. We ordered a bunch of appetizers: calamari, meatballs, and mozzarella, which were all delicious! Our favorite was the calamari, which is perfect for anyone who loves spice. I was also really impressed by our server who came by and split the appetizers evenly for us. It was the right balance of quality and service.",

    "text": "My wife and I ate here on a Wednesday evening. We made reservations for 5:00 PM and were seated immediately. Even if we did not have reservations getting  a seat wouldn't have been an issue as there were plenty of empty tables. 5:00 PM dinner is kinda early for Las Vegas, so an empty restaurant was not a worry to us. I don't remember the music being overly loud when we were there so I can't comment more on it. We had normal menus and then our server gave us an iPad with all the menus on it. We selected a couple drinks on the iPad and then our server wrote down what we had selected and then took our order. It seemed a little redundant. Give us a regular menu and a drink menu and call it good. They brought us 4 slices of bread and some olive oil, chili oil, and cheese. After finishing the 4 slices they brought us more. Our drinks arrived very quickly as well. I had the Linguine in White Clam Sauce and I thought it was good. I don't ever eat fresh clams so I cannot comment on if they were cleaned properly, I can say I don't remember eating any sand. The dish overall was good, but did have a LOT of sauce. The bread we had left was a good way to savor every last drop. My wife had the Spaghetti D.O.P. and it was amazing. I can say I probably enjoyed it more than I did my own meal. I would say it was probably the best spaghetti dish I have ever had.",

We ordered drinks and waited over 10 minutes to receive them. We ordered another round and waited even longer. When our meal was served, the entrees came out at different times and my 'salad and meatball' appetizer came out several minutes after everyone else causing their entrees to be cold by the time we ate. After speaking to the manager, twice, he told us that they serve the food as it comes out and that was the way it came out...not my problem! And the restaurant wasn't even 25% occupied. The food wasn't great, just passable, so all in all, won't be going back there again...ever!",

    "text": "Here is the bottom line, if you like your pasta cooked Al Dente, then you will probably like the food. But if you don't like pasta cooked Al Dente, then your out of luck, because they will not cook it any other way. I am not fond of Al Dente, or not being able to have my food cooked the way I want it, so 3 stars is the best I can rate this restaurant. I had the rigatoni in Sunday Gravy (sauce) with pork, and the gravy is very good. I also ordered a side of meatballs (which they give you one large meatball for $12). It was OK, but I have had a lot better and it was certainly not worth the money. The bread served with the meal is authentic delicious Italian bread, served with sides of oil, hot pepper sauce, and grated cheese (although I wish they also included butter as a choice as well). The decor is very sleek and ultra modern, and although it hardly fits the theme of an Italian resturuant, it is a nice looking place. The prices are high for an italian resturuant, but when you take into consideration your eating at a celebrity chef's restaurant, right on the strip, the prices are fairly reasonable. There are certainly many better Italian restaurants in Vegas, but if your staying at the Paris, and don't feel like leaving the hotel, you can get a decent meal here (as long as you like Al Dente pasta!).",

    "text": "First off, the service was good and the appetizers were decent.  We had the mozzarella (good) and the rice balls.  Before I continue I just want to share my qualifications for even giving a review - I can cook a wide array of foods; from Peking duck, to rib roast with bearnaise, to what has been said is lasagna as good as anything that can be found in northern Italy (with homemade sauce).   My wife had penne ala vodka, and while the flavor was good, the plated portion was at most worth $18-20, even by Las Vegas Strip standards, not the $28 they were asking for.  I had the Veal ala Martorano.  The \"sauce\" was basically some stewed tomatoes, chunks of garlic and chunks of Chile peppers (Serrano's), some salt and pepper over fried veal.   Now for those of you who enjoy heat for the sake of heat then you might very well enjoy the \"sauce\".  However, I find that spices-heat should not appear out of nowhere like a left jab to the face, depending on which fork full of food you happen to take a bite of.  They should be infused in the dish and add to the flavor, not fight with the other flavors.  That was not the case with this dish.  If you think you might like the dish then I would suggest trying it this way -go buy a Serrano chile and get a slice of pizza.  Then take a bite of each at the same time.  This will save you the $32 cost of trying the \"veal ala martorano\" to see if you like it, although it may be an insult to your favorite pizza.",

Overall, the look has a very modern/trendy feel to it, though admittedly a little confusing with the random mob/action movies playing on all the TV's periodically turning up over the sound system for certain scenes, only to fade back into the dj's mix.  Food wise---I enjoyed the meatball over fried mozzarella. The meatball was sizable, tender, delicious and of course fried mozzarella---what more need be said.  My entree was the lasagna which is better than average, but not necessarily anything to get too excited about.  What I did quite enjoy, however, was the wife's risotto with shrimp and scallops.  Quite possibly one of the best things I've ever tasted.  The risotto was so buttery and rich with each bite--completely flavorful, and the seafood cooked perfectly.  If I were to go back, I would certainly order that.  The price point was a little high, but as expected for this sort of restaurant on the strip in Vegas and certainly not outrageous.  Waiters were attentive and food brought promptly.  Overall good experience.",

The menu is right in front and you can scroll through it to see what goodies you would like to eat. When you get seated they have an electronic presentation the waiter does with wine etc... They bring out the fresh baked house bread and several dips for it. We had the big Meatball, which was excellent. Ordered Linguine & the fried Lobster tail. The risotto was the best so far I have eaten. The experience was the BEST! I will be back for more of that. Dessert & everything was the ALL Delicious!! The flat screen tvs were all over, no sound. I heard there is a DJ on the weekend and the floor turns in to dancing which was not the night we were there. It was a good experience. Lots of food that it is ridiculous. But we ordered a lot of food!! I wish they had sample platters for sale!! Guess I will have to eat here again to try the other dishes. Very upscale in price so please see the menu. Ambiance, presentation, food display, employees on top of their game were all Excellent!!",

    "text": "Now aside from homemade spaghetti and meat balls at home and a pizza from our favorite pizza parlor,  I'm not much for Italian cuisine. That being said, while staying at the hotel my wife and I decided to give Martorano's a try as an alternative to our usual steak house, seafood, and buffet dining. We had a bad experience, first they gave us probably the worst table in the house, right at the restaurant entrance so parties waiting for their table were standing right over our table. Ok we didn't let that bother us to much. Now the food. My wife ordered the Linguine in white clam sauce, what she got was Linguine soaking in olive oil that taste a little rancid. Neither of us could eat the Linguine but she did eat the clams they were ok..  I ordered the Rigatoni with Sunday gravy recommended by the server. A big chunk of roast pork that was fairly tasty but there was not enough gravy to satisfy my taste so I asked for a little more gravy, the server said he could do that for a  5 dollar cup of gravy as a side dish. ( WHAT ) I did not pay the 5 dollars simply out of principal. I could not finish my plate.   I'm not someone that makes a big deal about bad food or service ( service was ok ) in a restaurant because it makes for an uncomfortable situation for all. I just do not return.(  later that night I picked up a couple slices of pizza at JJ Boulangerie )",

We went anyway because we were staying at the Paris hotel and needed an early meal before the show.  The atmosphere was very pretentious and awkward.  Almost every server that poured water or wine was a nervous wreck and shook like leaves.  We asked for butter with our bread and they brought one pat on a little dish for 4 people!  The wine was very overpriced ($19 for 4 oz.).  The meal was mediocre, especially for the price.  I'm used to high prices for fine meals, but this one really was a disappointment.  I've been to Italy many times and no place treated us like this one did.  My sister asked for salt when they brought her meal and the waiter insisted that she taste it first and stood there while she did it (she still wanted salt!)!!  They made you feel like they were so superior in their knowledge.  I would never recommend anyone go there!!",

To top off your experience, you will wait 1.5 hours for your course to make its way to your table and your dessert will be unavailable at the end of your meal. We came in with a party of 8 people and not one of us had a single positive thing to say about this place.

The noodles had a nice chew to them and the pancetta is really good. It's a rather heavy dish though... I could barely finish half. Needless to say, I didn't have room for dessert.....

The ambiance of this restaurant is FIRST CLASS! The decor, the service, the music, the menus that light up, everything is NEXT LEVEL. We had a wonderful server who came over and seated us immediately. We started off with the Famous Meatball & Salad and Fried Calamari Martorano. One word: AMAZING!!!! The meat ball had SO MUCH flavor. It was very tender and rich but not overcooked at all. It spread apart with a slight push of the fork. The gravy, very flavorful and rich. The salad was fresh and very flavorful as well. The Calamari....seasoned and cooked to PERFECTION along with the sauce and green peppers, hands down the best calamari I've ever eaten, PERIOD! I had actually stopped eating calamari the past 8-10 years because it simply wasn't prepared right the past few times I had eaten it(restaurants should take notes from Steve). These were our appetizers.  Next up, entrees! The kids kept it very basic, spaghetti with sauce(no gravy, sauce) and salad. My wife ordered Linguine in White Clam Sauce and I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak. I didn't try any of my wife's but she said it was fabulous. I was nervous about the cheesesteak because I don't like a lot of bread, especially if it's hard and firm. My plate came out and the sandwich was PIPING hot. So hot I had to allow it to cool down. I finally took my first bite and the flavors oozed inside of my mouth. The cheese, the steak(SO tender and juicy) and the bread roll was not too big and it was beyond soft. The meat and cheese seemed like it sank into the inside of the bread and it made a perfect fit! The peppers on the side were spicy(exactly like I like them), juicy and fresh! I only ate half of the sandwich and I was stuffed! The kids finished their meal off with cake that I didn't try ONLY because I was too full. Steve and Marsha treated us like family! Steve is one of the most humble, authentic people I have ever met in my life. What you pay for when dining at Cafe Martorano is a EXPERIENCE, period! Its truly entertainment: the music, the movies on the big screens, the decor, the service, the food; it's simply on another level. When we visit Vegas again in a couple of months I know exactly what I'm ordering and I can't wait! Hands down the best Italian food in Vegas, no questions asked!  Yo Cuz!!!!!",

Neither one of us had ever tasted anything like it. Needless to say he cleaned his plate and thoroughly enjoyed this meal. I had the Fusilli Pollo this was delisious. It does have a strong bell pepper flavor something im not used to in my pasta. Our waiter took on the style of the resturant making small tall with us. It was nice to enjoy a different dinning experience with different dishes. We eat out alot and it can get boring. So this was a refreshing fun evening. Oh you must top it ofc with the carrot cake, it is out of this world.",

I was very disappointed with the food this time had the Rigatoni with Red gravy the pork was very fat and it seemed like they skipped the gravy sauce as the noodles were very dry.  Should have asked for more sauce but by the time it showed up more than an hour after ordering I was very 'Hangry' and ate it anyway.   The old location felt very old school Italian and the dining experience was made better by the attention of the wait staff. I miss that",

The only areas that could use a little improvement was the time it took for the order t come out and the presentation of the veal. Other than that this is the place to go for real \" Sunday Gravy\" and good food. It is a bit unassuming when you walk by. However, you need to stop! go in and try the food. I reco the cheesesteak sandwich and the meatball salad. A very generous and flavorful salad accompanies a gigantic meatball and plenty of ricotta cheese. The gravy is flavorful and good.   On the veal, i would have dressed it up with some gravy over the top of it and some fresh basil and oregano to give it some depth and color. The taste was good. It was tender and not chewy.   Will i be back, ABSOLUTELY!!!  Already booked a party there.   PS they have tis all around the rest. We were having a terrific meal whilst watching the God Father.  Cannot get better than that!!",

The preparation of our food was perfection.  Loved the mozzarella...best cheese stick we have ever had! Both entrees (sea bass and bucatini carbonara) set the bar for other Italian restaurants.  Every staff person we encountered was top notch but especially enjoyed our waiter, Brandon.  An absolute must if dining in Las Vegas!",

The music was interesting, not what i would expect, but since I was a child of the 80s, i enjoyed it a lot.  I guess they have a dance floor as well, since they were playing a lot of 80s and 90s hip hop and dance music.  I liked it, but we did not dance...  I thought the food was good.  We shared the Fusilli Pollo and it was enough for two of us, with an appetizer.  We had good service and the price was good as well  It's not a chain that you see in every town, and that's what we were going for.  And it was close to the hotel...",

We had the worse server ( The blond lady) with attitude and over 'I work by the book'.  Just to mention we are Diamond guest who spend 10-20K a night in the casino.   First she said on what ever we ask to change or add or remove from a dish ( My wife is pregnant)  ' No! I can't. You can see in the menus no changes at all' and after I asked a few times to ask the kitchen and begging , She came back and said 'oh it's ok the will do it for you'. It happened a few times.   Then one of the pasta dish wasn't cooked, And we know more than her one or two things about pasta, She said it should be like that. 'If you wanna change and make a new one it will take you 40 min for a new pasta'. Are you serious !?! She didn't want us to order a new one.  And so we said yes, And guess what? It took 20 min, half of the time she said.  When we said we don't want it because of her bad service, She was  laughing on front of our face with the manager.  One more thing, The pasta is not fresh, and costs 35$ and up for a poor basic marinara pasta. SHAME on Paris hotel that they let this restaurant to be opened there!  Don't go there. Poor menu, WORSE SERVICE.  Super expensive, You better go eat with this prices at Gordon Ramzi restaurant or Mom ami Gabi, X10 times better value for your money , 10X better menu and food quality and the most important you get an excellent service there.",

    "text": "Martorano's couldn't care less about you - it's all about the 'thug' attitude of Steve Martorano who believes the food is better than reality. The staff has nothing good to say about him.  At the Paris hotel, I had a diabetic blood sugar crash. After starting to recover, I was escorted by the EMS of Paris Hotel to the nearest restaurant with the desire of getting simple carbs into my system. Slumped in a chair and sweating profusely, I had to deal with extensive discussions until the manager finally stated that he refused to let me order anything except exactly what was on the menu. It went so far that I requested a pasta dish from the menu and asked that no \"gravy\" be put on the pasta . . . but charge me full price. \"Absolutely Not\" was the response. It was stated many times that Mr. Martorano does not care about my issues and refuses to make any alterations to any of their dishes - regardless of circumstance. Period.  Aside from this inhumane treatment and outrageous behavior, I was forced to eat Martorano's pasta dish prepared according to 'Steve's' menu requirement. I'm an Italian from New York, my grand parents were from Italy and operated a successful catering business after immigrating to the United States. I know Italian food. I cook and have spent 33 years in the food industry myself, and let me tell you, this food is not authentic Italian. Bread is the most basic aspect of an Italian meal and it should be outstanding. Martorano's bread was absolutely horrible: dry, tasteless and without texture. No kidding, the best part of my meal was the water.    Even if the food had been good, which it was not, how can people tolerate supporting an individual who is so egocentric that he would rather see a patron in distress suffer than serve a pasta dish without his precious \"gravy\" slathered on top. The tone of everything Martorano is negative, offensive, insulting and stinks of a pompous individual who would rather intimidate his customers and staff than be a beloved restaurateur. Steve Martorano needs to grow up and respect the people that spend their hard-earned money on his over-priced, mediocre food served with an attitude.  \"YO CUZ\"!!!!!",

We when back this trip in sept and unfortunately had the dinner. Horrible and over priced.   The pasta dishes we over salted and just bad. We asked if we could have one of the dishes without hot pepper and were told NO, the chef and owner refuses to accommodate. Well this chef can go F himself. I'll never go back and I would tell everyone else much better places to go in Vega.",

Welp, no problem here because the menu is digital! Fancy!   I dare say that you will not go wrong with anything you order. Everyone in my party was ecstatic with their meal and raved about it. I had the most divine braised short rib pasta! I still dream about it. The drinks are great as well.   It's well worth it. I paid for my date and I believe for the two of us ,it was only $200 with drinks. The dirty martini is excellent and I got some sort of pear basil drink that was delicious. Next time wine for sure because the gentleman sitting across from me said it was delicious with his steak. I tried both and he was absolutely right. Can't wait to go back!!",

We didn't order anything to eat, but we came in for a drink at the bar and were pleasantly surprised. The bartenders were super nice, attentive, and knowledgable about their selections. It was nice being able to chat a bit about the different wines they carried and they offered me a few to try based on my preferences. We were impressed.  The decor is interesting with blue lighting and very modern. Not exactly what I'd expect from an Italian restaurant. We came in on a Sunday evening and it wasn't too busy. We were greeted right away when we stepped up and got a seat at the bar. The bartender came over right away to help us.  Although I don't see us ever staying at the Paris Hotel again, if we were in the area and wanted to grab a drink, we would totally come back here. I'd even be open to trying it out for dinner.",

After a few escalations, we haggled it for 45 minutes, and only if my party agreed to do things \"family style\" - that is, order a bunch of stuff from the menu, and everyone shares. No problem! This was a great compromise, and I was so grateful they let us do this. Awesome service, both in that regard and once we were all seated. All of our servers were attentive, kept the wine flowing, and were able to talk in an educated way about the food that was being served to us.  There were a couple of pain points though. First, while they wanted us to do family style, they didn't have a policy in place for it. We actually just had to order 3-5 of each menu item, and pay the same price. Not quite what we expected (the manager led me to believe there was a specific family style menu). Second, the food is just fine, but some of it just isn't worth the cost. $30+ spaghetti? It's good, but not quite that good. No one at all in our party liked the  Linguine in White Clam Sauce.  I'd recommend the veal, meatballs, and calamari bibzy. And making a reservation for large parties ;)",

    "text": "The food here was disappointing. The service was good but I would probably not come back for the food. Maybe, I'm just not the right type of customer. There were there for dinner before going to see the new Inferno magic show.  We ordered, the fried calamari, spaghetti with meatball, carbonara, and cheese steak, and a salad.  First of all, when I order calamari, I expect it to be crispy and temperature hot. The sauce that they put on the calamari made all the pieces soggy. Have you had soggy calamari at a restaurant before? I haven't. This was the first time.  The spaghetti was fine. Nothing special with a giant meatball. For $25 or so for an average bowl of spaghetti wasn't worth it. If the sauce was more flavorful, then sure, but really, I could have made that spaghetti. The carbonara was okay, but I think they must have used swiss cheese, or the combination of cheese they used wasn't as good. It was very strong. I love parmessan, gruyere, asiago, etc. but whatever the combination was - was something that I personally didn't like. The Philly was okay, as well, but nothing special.  Usually price isn't a factor, but when the food isn't great, then it becomes an issue, because it wasn't worth it.  If I had known, I probably would have gone to Maggiano's instead. Oh, finally, the salad. It was swimming in dressing. I ordered the Maggiano's salad for $14. It was just that - lettuce and some tomatoes. I am being critical in that the world of restaurants has made so many innovations in salad that a $14 salad shouldn't be a small plate of greens with dressing that I could have bought at the grocery store.   I love great food and expect it when it is billed as a fine dining restaurant. Mediocre is right. I make better pasta at home than this restaurant. I don't think the chefs understand that people's palate's have changed. We're used to eating at so many great pasta restaurants - Nora's, Buddy Vs, Maggioni's, Wolfgang Puck, and a few more - gosh even California Pizza Kitchen, and I'll say Buca Di Beppo have some solid dishes, so this place is a great disappointment.",

We got seated fairly quickly because my wife made reservations ahead of time. The ambiance was great. Romantic and classy yet hip. Our server was great. Very knowledgeable of the menu and personable. His assistant and the GM were great. Everyone who waited on us was amazing.   I took off a star because the bread wasn't all the great and my chicken parmigiana was kind of boring on the plate. As for the taste it was pretty good, but I don't think it met my expectations for how much each dish was.   I would still recommend though. It was a great date night place.",

    "text": "A warning to picky eaters or anyone with allergies or dietary restrictions- this is not the place for you!  I am a very picky eater who does not eat tomatoes or even tomato based products. This can make it hard at Italian restaurants, but I normally just ask the server to hold the sauce. I decided to order chicken Parmesan for $28 dollars when dining at Martorano's with my friends tonight. I asked the server if I could have the dish without tomatoes, and she told me no. She said the chef refused to change his dishes (his grandmother's recipes), so I could get a plain piece of breaded chicken OR order the dish as is. I said I would take the plain piece of chicken with cheese on top- NOPE! No cheese allowed. Well, I decided I wasn't about to pay $28 for plain chicken (not even pasta or veggies on the side). Also, since plain chicken wasn't on the menu, I'm not sure why that was acceptable, but putting cheese on top was not.   I then asked for a special appetizer for the evening, fried mozzarella. This dish came with sauce on top, so I simply asked for the sauce on the side. NOPE! They wouldn't do it. I'm sorry- you can't serve the MADE TO ORDER DISH with the exact same ingredients, just on the side, rather than on top?   The server tried to offer alternatives, but 1) I'm very picky and couldn't find anything else without asking for no sauce, and 2) this interaction left a bad taste in my mouth. The server did point out the menu said \"no alterations,\" and I accept it was written there, but what a ridiculous rule! I asked if it would be different if I had allergies, and she said no! Unbelievable! I decided to not order anything at all, and went to eat at a different restaurant later (they held my ingredients for me, no problem!).   In addition to this, when being seated, my friend (who had a reservation) asked for a table inside. We were told there weren't any available, even though it was empty inside. Furthermore, after the meal, the server didn't even offer dessert- she just tried to bring the check. My friend had to ask to see a dessert menu.  When all was said and done, my friends enjoyed their food... but the no change policy was enough to ruin my meal, and it really put a damper on the evening for the rest of my group. If you are going to charge outrageous LV Strip prices, at least let the customer order his/her way. Will not be back at this establishment!",

    "text": "An hour long wait, despite having made reservations more than a month in advance - we were originally seated on the \"sidewalk\" outside the restaurant, with casino guests stumbling past mere inches from our table. Make sure you ask for a table inside the restaurant, but not under the house speakers - it was so loud, we couldn't even hear our waitress, who immediately screamed over the noise, \"Yeah, people complain about the music all the time!\" Do they, now?  We started with the Fried Calamari Bibzy ($20), which was a conflict of textures - some of the larger pieces of squid were completely melt-in-your-mouth tender, while other pieces were crazy rubbery - even the waitress quipped about the half-eaten portion when she finally arrived with our drink orders.  The place has a fantastic wine selection, featuring some really nice and inexpensive offerings, including several of our favorites from the Conundrum Winery by the glass - and we received some awesome suggestions from the sommelier, who had to scream his selections over the music.   My wife's Linguine with White Clam Sauce ($32) arrived under a thick layer of Italian parsley - so much so you would have thought someone dumped a lawnmower bag over the plate. And while the pasta was perfectly cooked, many of the clam pieces were gritty with sand. By the time my wife called it quits, there was such a pile of parsley \"clippings\" floating in the remaining broth, you couldn't see the bottom of the plate.   The Veal Piccata ($34) was tender and the lemon butter sauce was excellent. Just don't forget to order a side of pasta, because everything is a'la carte - an important fact that was either not shared with us, or we simply missed the detail while the waitress attempted to scream over the music.  Oh, and don't ask for salt or pepper - \"The chef seasons everything to perfection.\" Maybe for his pallet, but the veal would have certainly benefitted from a tiny sprinkling of salt.",

Its prices are high and its quality of food is middle at best.   Steve Martorano is painted as a South Philly goon (Posters of him with \"Yo Cuz!!\" in large print are plastered everywhere\") who somehow learned how to cook despite no formal training. You will see his book, his image, and videos of him talking about cooking during your time there. It's like walking into someone's ego. They are really selling this guy's image along with the food.  The Ego would be fine if the food matched it. Or, at the very least, justified the prices.   None of the food was bad, but it wasn't very good either and, at about $50 a person, I'm hard pressed to recommend this place when there are SO many better Italian options on the strip in the immediate vicinity.",

    "text": "The extremely poor service outweighed the delicious food. My daughter had just turned 21 and we were in the mood for some fine Italian food so we made our reservations and arrived right on time. We were seated, but no server was to be found for about 10 minutes. We had no drinks, or water. Finally our server Raymond came over and introduced himself, he was pleasant but dismissive, not even apologizing for the wait. We understand the restaurant may be busy, but maybe more waitstaff should be hired because one server can not handle 12 tables at once. We were looking into getting a bottle of wine and he asked us if we were staying at The Paris Hotel. We said no, but staying at The Cosmopolitan across the street. He kept trying to sell us something we did not want but insisted and made us try it anyway, still not liking it we ordered what we originally wanted. Took another 15 minutes for our bottle of wine to come and be served.  The whole time we noticed the table next to us was a bunch of high rollers, and got anything they wanted. There was every server, bus boy, sommelier helping them the entire service. Our server was barely present the whole time, and was mainly focused on the table next to us. A sommelier did not even show us the bottle of wine that we ordered. Then it came time to order our food, and we were excited because we heard the food was amazing and it certainly did not disappoint. Our first course came, we got the meatball salad and it was divine. I noticed though that every other table that got salad got it served to them by their server, in which we did not. Not a big deal, but bad front of house service for sure. Our main entrees were fantastic as well, we got the chicken parmigiana and veal parmigiana. Excellent food, kudos to the kitchen. Overall it was extremely poor service, which is very upsetting due to how good the food was.   Will not be returning due to the service.",

Our server advertised it as the best pasta on the menu and his description was right on the money.  The environment, however, was extremely odd. In the light up iPad menu, there's an excerpt somewhat warning of the restaurant's unique style of operation. White tablecloths and embroidered napkins suggest fine dining however TV screens playing movies with explicit content, an obscene amount of disco balls and gaudy neon blue lights complete the interior decorations. Very loud music bounces from current hip-hop to 80s pop to 90s r&b, with the occasional pause and dimming of lights to focus in on 90 seconds of the most vulgar scenes of whatever feature film is playing.  All in all, an extremely strange yet delicious experience.",

    "text": "I have waited two weeks after eating at Martorano's to write this review, in order to take some of the emotion out of my review.  I left there disappointed, because I like Paris Las Vegas so much.  But if you're looking for Italian in Las Vegas, you can do so much better.  It was fairly simple to get a reservation the same day.  People on walk-up at 8PM were told about a 45-minute wait which, on a holiday weekend in Vegas, still seemed reasonable.  Greeter staff was nice.    Our server was polite, but was very busy in another part of the restaurant.  We waited almost 10 minutes after ordering drinks to get them, and it was only because our assistant waiter (the busboy) saw us looking around, and was alert enough to ask if there was a problem.  Martorano's boasts about their meatballs.  The meatballs get lots of hype.  And the meatball appetizer is OK, but not life-changing.  If you've ever eaten in Little Italy in any city, or at a decent Italian restaurant anywhere that makes its own meatballs as opposed to using those from their foodservice, you'll think the same.  The presentation is nice, but for $20, I expected more from a meatball.    The food was very good.  Please don't mistake the tone of my review, accentuated by what happened when ordering, for putting down their food.  It's pricey, but it's The Strip.  I had Veal Parmigiana which came with NOTHING for $42.   My problem came when I tried to order a side dish.  I wanted a side of pasta, but too much tomato is a very bad thing for me, and I was already having it in the veal. The waiter knew this, because I asked for very light sauce with the veal.    I asked if they could do the pasta with just butter or oil and garlic - very simple, staple ingredients in any restaurant kitchen, let alone an Italian kitchen.  I was told NO, right away.  No discussion.  The restaurant has a firm \"no substitutions\" policy.  I explained to the waiter that it was something akin to a food allergy, and he told me there was nothing he could do.  The answer was NO.  So I asked just for some plain spaghetti, no sauce.  I was going to be sneaky and just take the butter from the bread and put it on the pasta.  Guess they were two steps ahead of me, because that wasn't allowed either.  I was going to take the spaghetti with marinara and LIKE IT!  OK - no side dish.  And, it's not as though Tomato was going to kill me.  I wasn't going into shock...just some discomfort.  But, no dice.  The waiter sensed my displeasure, and the GM appeared later.  He apologized for not being able to accommodate my wishes.  He told me that the chef had full control over the kitchen, and he was adamant about there being no changes and no substitutions for anything on the menu.  I asked to speak to the chef, but was told \"Oh, he's not here, he's in Dallas...but he reads feedback comments you leave when you sign your check\".  For the record, as polite as my comments were, he never responded.  It was simply the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of.  Celebrity Chefs everywhere make accommodations for guest requests that aren't outrageous. I mean, I wasn't asking them to make me gluten-free pasta.    We ate our entrees - which were good.  Nothing memorable, but good.  We skipped dessert and coffee.  The heavy word:  There are WAY TOO MANY CHOICES for great Italian in Las Vegas - and within a 10 minute walk of this place - for any restaurant to be less-than-accommodating.  I'm not saying you won't have a good meal here; but you can do better.",

He told the waiter we would start with appetizers and then decide on the main course. The waiter said that he could not take a partial order - we had to order the entire meal at the beginning. I said - I may want dessert... he said we had to decide then. If I had been in my hometown I would have asked for the manager and had a discussion with him about how ridiculous this was. Instead we just ate our appetizers and left - we went elsewhere for our dessert. What a shame.",

Server Paul went absolutely above and beyond our expectations. My wife and I chose to share an app, entree, and two sides. Paul did us the favor of splitting our order tableside and even served us for an extra personal touch. He couldn't have been more personable, attentive, helpful, and funny.   The food we orders was incredible. The fresh mozzarella and cherry tomatoes with evoo, sea salt, and a 25yr balsamic reduction came out first, and let me tell you, coming from someone who use to sell fine cheese, this mozz was top notch. The 16oz NY Strip was a perfect medium rare, and the blistered shishito peppers were the perfect compliment. The sauteed greens were cooked perfectly as well, and the risotto may be one of the best I've had.   Note to potential diners, on Friday and Saturday they have a DJ performing in house. Great mix, but can be loud in the main dining hall if that's not your thing.   Bonus points for Rocky playing on the tv's in the dining room :-)",

They have several tvs which play old movies and at some point they dim the lights and play loud music. It's a pretty fun place if you are in the mood to party. However, if you are not it can be very dark and too loud for dinner.   They have a large variety of dishes. I highly recommend the homemade mozzarella. There are a few dishes with it, so you have several opportunities to try it. For my main entree I ordered the tailgate pasta which comes with ground beef, veal and pork. The dish is super meaty and the pasta was perfectly cooked.   For my dessert I ordered the carrot cake. This dish was good, but easy to forget. Unfortunately they do not have a lot of options for desserts. I felt the five options available were very mediocre.  The service was also ok. The staff was friendly but it took about 45 minutes to get our main entree. Overall, a good option if you are feeling like having Italian food with a great atmosphere.",

The balsamic on the plate is for looks only, unfortunately added no flavor. The carbonara was under seasoned and muddled, a great disappointment. Will not return.",

They have a weird policy not to bring out any bread until the food has been ordered.  Maybe many have left after filling up on their bread and then decided not to order.   So once we ordered our food they brought out some of the bread served with romano cheese, olive oil and a spicy oil to dip the bread in.  We started off with the bibzy fried calamari.  Tender and delicious with a sweet n spicy sauce sprinkled with sesame seeds.    I opted for the protein side of the entrees and ordered the veal piccata.  A generous portion of veal that was ohhhh so tender and delicious.  I could easily cut it with a fork, no knife needed.  The veal was sitting in a delicious sauce of wine, butter, lemon, olive oil and surrounded by tasty capers.  The meal was very filling and by the time dessert was offered I was too full to partake.  I'll definitely have to save room for some tiramisu the next time around.",

Their meatball is spectacular, my only issue is; why the heck they charge extra for a tablespoon of ricotta.  That kind of stingy-ness as well as the inconsistency with service is the only reason I cannot give them a 5/5.       Overall, I have never not been happy with their food.

I had the spaghetti which was fantastic. Great wine list too. Bread and flavored olive oils are unique and tasty. The deal breaker is the service. It started out good and the server was nice enough but then after we got our food and ate, she just ignored our table for 20 minutes. Unfortunately, we were in a hurry and spent 20 minutes waiting for the check. We asked two bus boys to let the waitress know we wanted to go but to no avail. Might have been an isolated incident but disappointing. It could have been a great experience.",

It is the most tender bite of calamari you can imagine. The flavor profiles boasts a slightly spicy and sweet Kung poa style  taste leaving you wanting more.  Next time I come to Vegas I will be back for the appetizer alone. I ordered the veal Parmesan for an entree.  My companion ordered  the chicken parm. Both met and exceeded expectations, the chicken outweighing the the veal in tenderness and flavor. I will make an effort to return here next time I come to Las Vegas. The service was above par.  The waiter was helpful and the delivery/bussing service staff was borderline entertainment for the evening.  I can't stress enough to get the calamari Bisby even jf that is all you come for.",

Of course started the meal the world's best tasting meatball.  The server Mike, the manager John and the cook was the most professional and beyond approach when it comes to service. The chef made my dinner twice cause he didn't like how the first one came out and you don't find that commitment to quality and detail like that anymore.

Carbonara had the white Parmesan sauce which was my favorite, other one was pretty solid with one good sized delicious meatball..good but $28 at lunch time good???not sure..Truffle fries were flavorful slash a.little salty..$80tab for lunch seems to make me not like it as much as I hoped..Maybe I'll return for dinner to give a fair review..Cool and friendly waiter was a plus..#yocuz Lower ur lunch prices..haha..",

The menu lacks selection and customizability. I asked if the spicy sauce on a dish could be substituted and he said \"no we don't customize orders.\" I then asked if their was another dish that included paste, with chicken, that is not spicy. He replied \"no\". I can't believe that they can't customize an order that costs upwards of $30 a dish. This establishment lacks quality and versatility that many younger individuals desire, due to this I would highly recommend overlooking this place and finding a more \"family\" oriented restaurant (save your money and time).",

Who wants to hear about a $52 piece of pork from an iPad picture. The place has sports playing on the flatscreens and disco balls hanging from the ceiling with waiters dressed as paper boys from the 40's. I have no idea what this restaurant is trying to be. Our waiter never came over to check on our meal and we were never asked if we wanted another drink. Our dessert was presented on an iPad. There's nothing 5 Star about this restaurant but the food.",

    "text": "Our server Paul is the man. He took the restaurant experience to the next level. When you get details about the history, about the mozzarella being made fresh daily, the can't miss meatballs, and his favorites...you are set up for success.   The caprese salad is bomb. Fresh mozzarella, tomato, crispy basil and aged balsamic. Yes. Get it. That was probably my favorite.   The meatball is 1 big meatball with a side of a tasty salad. Paul split the meatball for us and some salad, awaited our joy, and we let him know he was right - it's tasty. I wouldn't say the hype is THAT accurate, but it is a nice app. The salad it comes with is a little higher on vinegar which is a nice cut to the meatiness of the dish.   We also split the spaghetti pescatore - aka seafood spaghetti in a tomato sauce. The pasta here is cooked al dente (firm) and this is how I'm used to eating pasta so I was super happy about it. If you're used to a more cooked pasta, don't be shocked.   It was too much food. We were both like a package of crescent rolls - a second away from popping. If you're sharing, I'd recommend 1 app and 1 entree. Or 3 apps.   It's vegas, so somehow this wasn't weird, but they have a dj and disco ball scenario going on in the restaurant. It threw me off because the food quality and service is more upscale, and then you have club music in the background. It didn't detract for us just a talking point. Another, don't be surprised, thing.   I know I already preached about Paul, but I can't say enough good things about him. He's full of fun facts, is super likeable, and at the end you want to invite him to join your table.   Good food, great service, dinner for two around $120 (2 apps, 1 entree, 2 glasses of wine).",

The atmosphere is nice, the service great, and the food is incredible.  Yo Cuz Steve was there in person watching his crew cook up the food.  I lucked out at the seating because I could watch the events of the staff as I enjoyed the Company in my party.  The eggplant stack appetizer was pretty darn good.  The speghetti pescatori was outstanding.    The prices were not cheap but not out of this world like some of the other nearby places.  If you pay decent money, you want decent food and this was the case here.  Steve was especially busy during our time here because NFL Quarterback, Joe Montana was dining a few tables over.  But he took the time to come over and talk to us.  This was really special to one of us in our party as he is a frequent diner at his Atlantic City location.  He is one huge dude and takes his craft seriously.  It was nice meeting him.  I would highly recommend this place.  I will be back!",

You can absolutely taste the difference in these dishes compared to any other Italian food you're used to. We started with the shrimp scampi appetizer that out server plated for the two of us to split. The scampi sauce was awesome. I got the bucatini and meatballs and enjoyed every aspect of the dish. The \"gravy\" was simple and delicious, perfect al dents pasta, extremely flavorful meatball, and the final perfect element: that dollop of ricotta.  Aside from the food, the service and atmosphere were also worth the 5 stars! Our server was super attentive, excited to tell us about the food, answer any questions and made a great wine recommendation. (It was their brand that they sell at the restaurants and online which we'll be ordering very soon!). We loved the fun super club atmosphere and you go in looking forward to enjoying this unique fun experience.  My only tip for them would be to make sure the hours are advertised consistently. I went to check out some other yelp reviews while we were dining and noticed it said the location was closed. Spread the word that it's open late & has awesome late night full dinner service!  Will recommend to friends that visit Vegas and return to this spot when I'm back!",

That is all part of the atmosphere we were told.  They do a great job of pulling off a Philly-style place, but we did not enjoy that. The food-ourparty split the meatball and salad, and the eggplant salad.  Both were wonderful, along with the warm bread.  I could have stopped there and been satisfied, but order a special for the night entree-a short rib dish-disappointed,  the flavor was not good, pasta was bland, and all was too salty.  My husband had a special-seafood dish, loved it. Others liked their choices.  My monitor was great. Service seemed good because when the staff was at our table they were attentive, but when we wanted the check and when my food came a couple minutes after the others the service was slow.  Sorry to say the music level ruined it all.",

Service was top notch and food was delicious. Had the meatball to start and shared the rigatoni and the chicken parmigiana. The chicken was huge and tender but a bit too much cheese on top. Everything was going great until approx 9:15pm the music went from Sinatra style dinner music to blaring R&B and disco. It was quite strange and took away from the ambiance and the meal. The music was loud and awkward and with poor transitions. Great food and great service - just go before the 9pm discotheque starts!",

There is not a single thing here that I was impressed with except the meatball salad. It is enough for two people to share and has great taste! Had the chicken parmesan and was definitely not impressed. They brought out the wrong order at first and they made it right but by the time they came back I was so full on bread it did not matter that they brought me new food period was not able to eat it anyways. Had a few bites and it was okay period then packed it and gave it away to the homeless. Martorano's you guys really need to step it up. The appetizers came out at the same time as the entrees. They sat us very quickly but the waiter took 20 minutes to come say hello. Once we started eating we realized something was not right and it took them an additional 20 minutes to come but that was only because we waved them down. I think you guys have a great place on your hands, a few tweaks would bake it so fantastic",

When we didn't order food right away the waiter obviously got upset.  Suddenly the manager was there asking if we were going to be eating.  We said we just wanted a drink we thought.  He told us the tables were reserved for people who were going to eat.  I looked around and there was maybe 2 or 3 other tables with people at them.  One of my friends began to protest but I was just in such shock I said let's go.  The manager said he was sorry.  No he wasn't.  Don't be rude AND lie to me.  We went to the French restaurant in the Paris and had a wonderful meal and spent over $200.  The service was wonderful.  Martorano's is not friendly.  The food may be good but I'll never get to find out because I was asked to leave.",

I took a client here for dinner on a Thursday night before a night out. We ordered a bottle of wine and the calamari to start. The service was excellent, the wine was presented well, and the calamari was out of this world (I'm a bit of a calamari snob). I then ordered the Chicken Sicilian. I'll make this short...this is probably the best Italian food I have ever had and I used to manage an Italian restaurant. My client was also very satisfied as we were talking about how good dinner was for the rest of the night.  Again, I didn't experience the atmosphere of the main dining room which, from reading other reviews I could see as being kind of cheesy. But if you are just looking for great food, go here and sit out in the \"patio\" area, which is in front of the restaurant out in the main hallways of the Paris Casino.",

He quickly went through the menu and gave us some great recommendations. He was very attentive the whole time and kept us on schedule. My friend ordered the pork chop with a side of angel hair pasta and I had the braised short rib bolognese. Oh my...my short rib was divine!! The meat was tender and you could tell it was simmered for a while in the sauce, because it was juicy every bite. The pasta was perfectly cooked and the wine was delicious. My friend enjoyed her pork chop. I had a small bite and it was too spicy for me. The waiter was right, it's perfect for those that like their meals with a spicy kick. It was tender and very flavorful! Served on a bed of spinach and peppers. By far one of the shortest and best meals I have had in Vegas. Staff is great and the food was delish!",

The eggplant stack melted in my mouth! The calamari was the best I have ever had. Not too sweet and wasn't chewy at all! Like the best!  My husband got philly and it was very hardy and meaty. Everything was hot and we really enjoyed the food. The bartender Andrew made great drinks and had us to-go cups and our check without even asking. It literally shifted our entire night! Special shout out to Ben, the manager on duty who made this experience 5 Star. We will eat here again!",

What!!??  Also no salt and pepper on the tables or even offered with a pepper mill . No cheese offered with our pasta entrees . And overall the waiter was was not attentive.  Also based on Florida location we expected a fun music experience. NO !!! Music only on Friday and Saturday. !!!  Next time in Vegas we will not be returning ..",

Everything about this restaurant is top notch.  From the moment we walked in and were greeted by the friendly hostess, we began our incredible dining experience.  We ordered the mozzarella and tomato stack to start and it was perfect.  The mozzarella had a lovely consistency and the tomatoes were delicious. Each bite just melted in my mouth.  We both ordered the linguine in white  clam sauce and we were so glad we did.  The dish was unbelievable.  The best linguine and clams we have ever had.  Lastly, we ordered the key lime cheesecake baked by Marsha Martorano.  It was absolutely exquisite and we savored every bite.  The best part of the evening was that we were able to meet Steve and Marsha Martorano in person as they were in the restaurant.  They are an amazing couple with incredible energy.   We loved every minute of our dining experience and wished we lived closer so we could visit more often.",

Hubs had the Pigs Feet and said it was good, but I ordered the Caesar salad ($14) and it was soggy and drowning in Parmesan cheese. Now, don't get me wrong, I ordered the Parmesan chicken, I do like Parmesan- but the salad was DROWNING in it.  To their credit, the waiter was incredibly gracious and immediately took it off the bill and offered me an alternative option, but it was disappointing.  The Chicken Parm is just chicken parm -not fancy or special ($28) and you have to pay extra for a side of pasta pomadoro to accompany it.  We loved the location- in the walk way between Paris and Bally, great view and people watching, and the DJ played fantastic music. So atmosphere is a big plus. But overall, just MEH! Not somewhere I would enthusiastically recommend and not somewhere I am eager to bother with again.",

    "text": "Ohhhhh man, I don't even know where to start with this delicious experience! My best friend and her family make it a tradition to come to Martorano's every time they are in Vegas and this time, I was the lucky guest that got to learn WHY they love this place so much! I'm not sure why they only have 3.5 stars because I thought it was absolutely incredible from beginning to end and left the most full that i've ever been. HIGHLIGHT: The menus LIGHT UP so that you can see what you're reading! I've never seen this before and it is such a cool concept! :)   We ordered a delicious bottle of Malbec to start, and enjoyed it along with their family-style apps {that they dish up for you!} and soft and airy bread with parm and dipping oils. For the appetizers, we ordered their famous Meatball & Salad {a MUST! I could probably eat this for my meal}, the Eggplant Stacked made with house made mozzarella {ANOTHER MUST}, and the calamari. We were honestly full after these apps but then the REAL meal came! I ordered the Chicken Sicilian and it was so delicious. Chicken tenders, mushrooms, capers, and hot cherry peppers. Warning, it does have a kick but I love that! The entrees do not come with a side but I ordered a side of spaghetti so that I could taste their famous marinara sauce. The entrees are HUGE and if you order apps, I highly recommend splitting them. I also tried my friend's Veal Piccata and that was delish too!   All in all, a VERY great experience. Pro Tips: Order an app or two, share entrees and a few sides. This place is pricey and you don't want to be left with a ton of extra food like we were because when you're on vacation, leftovers go to waste! :)",

    "text": "Unfortunately, I went in to Martorano's with high expectations and left underwhelmed. Aesthetically, it's a beautiful restaurant in a good location. The menu lighting up once you open it is a cool feature, the ipad with drink menu was interesting and unexpected, but the food was mediocre and not what I was expecting.  My friend ordered the Fusilli Pollo, and I got the Penne (w/out meat), with a cocktail and mule. The drinks were basic, and the food lacked flavor. With an upscale restaurant, I wasn't expecting large portions, but I was expecting a tasty meal but it was nowhere to be found. Music was loud (which was fine, that honestly didn't bother me but if you're going on a weekend night and are sound sensitive or want to hear your date, give this place a pass) and service seemed a bit hard to come by.  Our waiter was friendly, and polite when he came by. We did watch 2 different people with to go orders, and 1 lady who wanted to place an order, go to the bar and have to wait an excruciatingly long time before someone noticed them or said something to them. It was made even more excruciatingly long since there was a man in a suit directly in front of them (behind the bar) who was serving up 4 different glasses of wine to another member of staff (waiter, by what they were wearing.) Like at least tell the people 'hold on, someone will be right with you' but they were too absorbed in trying out these wines to even bother. It looked bad, and tainted the experience more. (Also, I'm not sure what the standard here is for drinking while working or while in your work attire, but maybe take it somewhere that *isn't* the dining room? In direct site of literally everyone in the restaurant? It looks tacky.)   All in all, it was very expensive (which we were expecting, and were okay with) but the dinner did not meet our expectations, nor did the experience.",

You would think they would help me out since the lasagna was already out.So when the dish came it was not penne alla vodka wasn't even close wasn't even edible the waiter was more than accommodating to exchange it but by this time I lost my appetite I managed to call the manager over and and  asked him what restaurant at your caliber runs out of lasagna on a Saturday night at 7:30 he said he only makes 15 pieces of lasagna per night the restaurant holds 125 and if you have two or three turnovers that's a lot of people I asked him why he cannot do substitutes on pasta he said that's their policy .At the end of our meal the waiter said he took my dish off the bill like he was doing ME a favor that is horrible customer service every time I go there I have a fantastic time but this time it left a bad taste in my mouth probably the alla vodka hard to say if I will return",

One it was not packed and hostess sat us near the outside of the restaurant as if the place was packed inside and that was the only choice. Mind you they knew my husband is a Diamond member. After sitting there and no one offering us any drinks or anything. Finally after 15mins the waiter saw I was upset and I asked him to move us so we can enjoy the restaurant vibe. Then after being moved inside. 3 mgrs standing there doing nothing bug chatting and waiters as well. Just as we were about to leave waiter finally comes over and offers us a drink menu.  So faster forwarding to our meal.  We ordered the meatball salad. It was decent. Wasn't dry but nothing great. I ordered penne vodka and husband ordered the chicken parm. My husband is italian from Brooklyn NY. He judges any italian resturant by your chicken parm. We get our food. Husband looks at his plate and asked the waiter where is the gravy(sauce). Waiter says its under the mozzarella. Husband looks under was like what italian eats dry chicken parm. Waiter brings over a tiny side of gravy and husband again says. Chicken parm is suppose to have alot of gravy. Waiter says we can give you a side of gravy but have to charge you. At this point husband just wanted to eat. So he agreed. Get to my penne vodka. TERRIBLE! Penne vodka is my all time fav and growing up with italians back home in NY. This place should be ashamed to call themselves a authentic italian resturant. My pasta was hard the sauce was filled with onions and garlic.  After a while. The manager comes over and asks how's it going. Husnand states about the Chicken parm. Manager says we serve chicken parm dry like that, just a little sauce under the mozzarella. Husband looked at him and couldn't believe that came out his mouth!  After all said and done. I left very hungry and with an upset stomach just for eating some of the hard pasta. So if you really want a good italian resturant. I suggest Pasta Mia across from the Palms, it's not on the strip per say but if you want some good italian good this is your place. Its authentic and delicious! Oh and very afforable!",

This is an example of a Las Vegas vanity restaurant with an 'experience' I would avoid at all costs but food that begs me to come back for more.  We were seated inside of the restaurant late in the evening, exactly at the time we reserved our table.  The staff were friendly, attentive and professional.  The service staff had spot on recommendations for drinks and appetizers. Stars all around for everyone.  Inside the restaurant was clouded with vanity pictures of chef Martorano in poses that show him as the 'Boss' he apparently is.  Music from the 90s was being pumped through speakers so loud the servers had to shout the specials and signature drinks, and even that was not good enough to hear anything they said.   Much worse, a string of scenes from Martorano's favorite films were loudly played on TV screens throughout.  Scarface, Rocky 3 & 4, and an old Steve Martin film were forced down our throats as we tried to enjoy delicious cocktails.  Why the TV's?  I felt like we were at home watching bad cable.  The food, however, oh the food!  Are you kidding me?  We ordered four items from the regular menu and specials, and everything was just amazing.  Super fresh, top of the line meat, seafood and pasta.  The standout was a sea bass special, absolutely melt in your mouth perfection.  The pasta was perfectly prepared, just as promised on the menu.  Martorano's is loud, loud, loud, so go for great dining with somebody you don't want to talk with.",

    "text": "We ate here while showing a friend around the Paris Hotel and we thought we'd be in for some incredible food after hearing all the waiter had to tell us. We were prepared to be blown away by amazing food. It fell short. I like my pasta al dente but this was just too undercooked almost to the point of being crunchy. The sauce was just ok and so was the meatball. The ricotta was really good. The guys that ordered the veal and chicken parm didn't have any gripes but weren't blown away either. I think if you set people up for greatness as the staff does, then you should deliver. That didn't happen. The mozzarella appetizer was good but not over the top delicious as promised. It was just eh....  I come from a long line of great Italian cooks, especially my Dad, and this stuff just can't touch any of their stuff.",

I ordered the lasagna and I can honestly say I've had much better lasagna frozen from Costco. In addition the risotto we ordered was way over salted. Overall way overpriced for the quality and taste of the food. Save your money and go elsewhere.",

What we experienced instead was fast food fine dinning at it's best. It took more than a few minutes for our waiter to introduce himself and serve water.   We ordered philly steak sandwich and Shrimp spaghetti. As expected from menu we were asked to be patient for food, as it was \"made to order\".  We received what I felt was market prepared bread everyone boasts about.    After more than 20min when the food finally arrived I was pissed!!!  The philly sandwhich ($18.00) looked like a complete mess.  I felt that it was purchased from Costco frozen food sandwhich.  The spaghetti was warm-cold not hot as I expected from a freshly prepared entree.  Shrimp was prepared perfectly, wild caught.  The calamari was a F'n JOKE!  It was frozen.....Yo Cuz!  You fed me a frozen entree??????  When it came time to pay this establishment inquired about my experience.  I gave them a \"D\" rating simple fact that it was terrible!  I gave this establishment 2 stars for two reasons; Incredible ambiance & MGR inquiring about our experience prior to completion of our meal.  I will not be returning.....",

    "text": "I gave it two stars for the food. When we got seated, we got the iPad with the drinks. The waiter then gives us a spiel about the owner, food served family style, so if one dish is ready and the others are not, you must serve that dish and wait for the other dish to come out. If your other party doesn't want the dish you ordered, they sit and wait...and wait. They brought the appetizer, after yet another bus boy had brought the wrong dish, and we said we were splitting it. The assistant said he would be back to serve it to us. We waited   and waited while he went to get plates. Then waited some more. Finally he came with some plates.  THREE times the \"assistants/bus boys\" brought us the wrong meal to the table. They gave our food to the table next to us. They did let us keep one misplaced dish, but only after our waiter finally showed up and I told him we didn't order this. He said \"yeah, the other table got your food\" so we had to wait again for the food that we ordered. Since there was only two of us, the waiter was doting on the other table with four people. Bigger tip, I assumed. I ordered ice tea, and got a bottle of Chinese tea and a glass of ice. I guess they have various favors of bottled Chinese tea. Once the correct food finally arrived, it was ok. I've had better, but it was adequate. Will I go back? NO. No excuse for a restaurant that has been open for 6 months for the service. If this chef is so great, I suggest he hire a manager who knows how to staff a restaurant. The service was absolutely terrible and totally disorganized, and we were there on a night that it wasn't busy at all. I shudder to think what happens when that restaurant gets busy. My suggestion, go to Buddy V's at the Palazzo for good service and good food and walk past Martoranos at the Paris Hotel.",

The music is so loud it could make a Slipknot fan complain about auditory pain after dining there.  The server tries to force you to order your entree at the same time as your appetizers and when confronted as to why you need to order our entree right away they smugly answer like mindless buffoons \"Cuz that's the way we do it here\".  By far the worse dining experience we have ever had in Vegas.  We didn't even get past the drinks before leaving that abortion of a restaurant. If you want a comparable dining experience for a lot less money, then do yourself a favor and go to the Double Down on Paradise and scrape the dried sputum off the floor and put it on a plate.  You won't even be able to tell the difference between that and  Martorano's complimentary bread with ground rat meat they place on the table prior to cattle prodding you into ordering.

Our party of 8 had reservations and the restaurant was not all that busy for a Saturday night...now I understand why.

We went to the bar to have a drink, but it took so long to navigate the cute little iPad menu that all of our party arrived before we could order a drink. At least we were able to sit at our reserved table. We then sat and waited 15 minutes for a server...did I mention it wasn't that busy? When he did arrive, he impressed us again with an iPad drink menu...for 8 people? Really? I asked for a paper menu and was told that it was not updated. Strike two. Good news, we did get water after 25 minutes! The server was pressuring us along after he made US wait?!? Strike three. I haven't even tried the food yet, and honestly don't care if I do. It's like a nightclub more than a restaurant. I would have asked my fellow diners if they felt it was loud too, but you can't hear each other at all. The noise level is LOUD!

The food in my neighborhood was what we referred to as \"red sauce\" or \"italian-american\". Martorano's took his east coast-italian american food that we all grew up on and brought it to Vegas- and good for him. There is an entire population in Vegas who never had this. I should know, I was there Saturday night with 2 very \"American\" friends from California. They LOVED it. Their review would be 5 stars all the way. I just have had this food so much that it is not unique. Strictly local red sauce grub. I had to explain what \"gravy\" was to my friends - which was pretty funny. I also had to hold my tongue at the \"mark-up\" of Proseco ($15 I pay at the market - $40 at Martorano's) - They gave us a nice tasting of mortadella mouse- it was very tasty. I had the linguine vongoli. I thought it was really good. They are very generous with the clams. Usually, you get such a small amount. Very good meal. My friends got the pasta with fish and liked it and my other friend LOVED the eggplant stack and satueed spinach. Good restaurant for Las Vegas",

I had a very nice time at the Martorano's bar last night. Very friendly, knowledgable service. Nice lighting and not too Crowded (Wednesday evening after ten).   I had a house-specialty cocktail called \"Angel\" -an upscale twist on a margarita. Sweet, but I knew that going into it. Followed by a glass of Pinot -Grigio.   And here's the thing: I was so distracted by the wine glasses, that I almost forgot about the beverage. Rarely have I heard a wine glass ring so beautifully. It was like an alcoholic Tibetan singing bowl. Truly marvelous.   But the wine: eh..the selection was pretty average -same with beers and whiskys.  The house cocktails are pretty standard for the Strip - as were the prices. Three beverages came to $42 +tip.  And here's the other thing: I love Italian food, and spent many years in Boston's North End - the traditionally Italian part of town. Even the best pasta dish is inexpensive to make, and should not be flamboyant. Simple good food made from fresh ingredient is what it is all about.   Martorano's is \"production Italian\". More emphasis on presentation than is necessary for such a simple cuisine - with prices to match. The gullible are easy to impress. But again, pretty normal for The Strip. I'll go back for the hang, and the singing wine glasses. Probably go light  on the food.",

Everytime I am in Vegas I eat at Martoranos because the food is excellent the service is EXCELLENT the atmosphere is excellent and if you the type that believes you get what you pay for then you will see and taste the quality you paid for! The warm Mozzarella is to die for and basically everything else on the menu. Its obvious that Mr Martorano prides himself in running a class act of a restaurant because I will NOT eat anywhere else because Chef Martorano and his staff at this location care and it shows big time!! Give it a try you wont be disappointed! All these negative reviews I think are incorrect or fraudulent regarding service and times for food delivery because NOT ONCE  in the over 20 times Ive been here have I waited more than 30 min max.",

    "text": "I wanted to dislike this place.  The life-sized wall posters of the giant tattooed Italian American Cook with his catchphrase \"Yo, Cuz\" along with omnipresent clips of HIS favorite movies and HIS favorite cooking show (himself) should be all the warning you need that you are dealing with a massive ego here.  Oh, if that weren't enough, the entrance to Paris on the Arc has one giant image of Gordon Ramsay and one of this guy.  So, at first glance, I'm thinking, \"Ego, pure and simple, and nothing more.\"  I'm happy to say I was impressed by the outcome, though.  Ego or not, this food is good.  Now, disclosure, I'm not Italian, so I'm probably not as harsh a critic as others.  But, I've eaten at a fair share of Italian places, and I know some authentic Brooklynites of Sicilian heritage who know a thing or two about cooking.  This place nails it.  The fried mozz, best I've ever had.  A giant ball of fresh, in-house made mozzarella, thick sauce with spicy peppers, perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The bolognese (special of the day while we were there) was literally the best I'd ever had.  I mean, just melt-in-your-mouth amazing.  Cocktails were great, no complaints here either.    I'd definitely come back here again if I'm ever in Vegas and craving good Italian.  This was well worth the visit.  For Vegas, the prices were actually pretty decent, too.    It does get a bit loud there, though, especially after 9pm.  They warn you about this, but it's still hard to hold a decent conversation, even with someone right next to you.  Part of the kitsch, I guess.",

The atmosphere was nice and was not too noisy which I have grown used to in Vegas. We ordered our drinks and I had the Black Beauty (at least I think that is what it was called) which was fantastic. For dinner my boyfriend ordered the lasagna and I ordered the bolognese. They were both delicious and very good portion sizes (I usually have trouble finishing a pasta plate but I was able to here). We really enjoyed the televisions playing old school Vegas movies like the original Ocean's 11 movie. For dessert we had their homemade ice cream and that was also a wonderful addition to our meal. Will be returning on our next visit!",

He kept coming toward table and bringing us food that we didn't order There were other tables in the restaurant that were two tops but it was so strange because I didn't think that we were the first actual people to be seated I think that maybe we were there first party of six It was my girlfriend Sheridan's birthday that we were celebrating I didn't get the bill if there even was one but my friend had said that the chef had hoped it up somehow it was crazy I'm sorry but I thought the food was good and I will never forget how this big jumbo macho Italian guy with the muscles came up to us and were so friendly and was talking to us I'm not sure that even realised it was Chef Martorano at that point until we had left  I don't know about these other experiences but I had a nice time plus the booze always helps",

It was a good experience overall, however the 4 stars are mainly for the service and the calamari appetizer.  I know some people complained about it being soggy because of the sauce but I think it's the sauce that *made* the dish!  It's different from any other typical calamari appetizer I've ever had at most restaurants.  It's lightly breaded and fried, but they put a slightly sweet and tangy sauce on it that made it completely different in a good way.  I ordered the seafood pasta with red sauce (I forget the fancy dish name) and the seafood was obviously very fresh.  I would pick this place over some of the other \"celebrity\" Italian restaurants in the area.",

The customer service from the hostess to the waiter were all top notch.  THE FOOD WAS DIVINE!  I tried the caesar salad, linguine in white clam sauce and the homemade mozzarella with olive oil.  I don't suggest this place for a romantic date night but for a fun night out it fits the bill with fun music and stellar food.  For the cost it would have been nice to not have all the buzz and noise from the casino and for Martorano's to have it's only restroom which is why I deducted a star.",

    "text": "I joined two friends from out of town who were staying at Paris Las Vegas to try this restaurant.  I've walked by it many times and was always curious as to the food.  My friends like Italian, so this was our choice.  We had a 5:15 PM reservation and got to the podium just about 5 PM.  We were asked to wait because there were others ahead of us.  But, there really wasn't and she motioned us to come over.  We took seats on the patio that's on the walkway along the shops, buffet, and other dining venues in the Bally's/Paris connector.  We were promptly greeted by our server, given menus that light when opened, and brought water and iced tea quickly.  We were then brought a basket of bread and three toppings for the bread--one a spicy oil, some grated cheese, and regular olive oil.  We were cautioned about the spicy one but it really wasn't spicy.  One of my friends requested butter and that was brought for her.  We started with Bibzy calamari that is described on the menu as \"fresh never frozen calamari tossed in a sweet & spicy chili sauce finished with sesame seeds.\"  There was another kind also, but this was described as their most popular so we went with that.  I usually can't get calamari because it's almost always a dish to be shared and I have yet to find a place that will do a half order for solo diners.  The calamari was good and the sweet and spicy chili sauce was something quite different for calamari.  I expected it to be deep fried and was surprised when it wasn't.  For the main course, I got the bucatini carbonara.  The server broke the egg and mixed it into the sauce at the table.  The sauce was tasty but a little heavy for carbonara.  I asked about the pasta and it's not house made.  The staff took pains to explain it was imported from Italy.  Service was good although there was an error with the order.  Besides the regular menu, the server had a tablet with photos of some other dishes they were highlighting.  In taking the order, one of our party wanted one dish but evidently it was taken as pointing to another.  When the error was pointed out, they were willing to make the dish he wanted, but he opted not to wait and go with what they brought.  The three of us agreed on our rating for the restaurant.  As a local, I can go to many neighborhood Italian restaurants with food as good or better and with prices that don't carry the \"Strip\" premium.  $12 for a side of spaghetti?  Live and learn.",

I again ordered their Fried Calamari Bibzy and it was a nice spicy glazed version of fried calamari with thin slices of jalapenos to add an extra kick.   Their great service was very consistent too from my last experience. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left, great customer service especially from Raymond and Francisco. They made sure we were taken care of the whole way through.   Highly recommend to order the following entree: Lobster Francaise  Spaghetti Pescatore   For dessert, try their amazing carrot cake along with their double expresso. Delicioso!   NOTE this place says it opens at 430 but it's only the bar that is open at that time. The dining area opens at 5p",

The service was mediocre at best... it felt like we our waiter was trying to up-sell us on everything.  Their menus are also completely overkill - they're backlit and make you feel as if you're getting a tan! Unnecessary as the front section of the restaurant is completely lit from the Paris walkway.  The two things to look out for:  the calamari (especially the one with peppers... not good), the salad (it comes swimming in dressing and completely soggy).  Don't waste your money on these!  Additionally, the price point here was completely ridiculous.  I know it's Vegas, but the food needs to at least be decent to charge this much money!  It was $200 for our party with some of the dishes over $30. Completely not worth it.",

My husband and I like to be adventurous so we started off with the pigs feet. This was a little too fatty for me but the sauce was adequate and it was interesting to try.   Afterwards, we weren't sure what pasta to get so we thought we'd split the bolognese of the day. The picture on the menu made it look big but when it arrived there was not a whole lot there. I thought the pasta was extremely underwhelming for supposedly \"fresh pasta\".   Because I'm a glutton for punishment, I decided to order the carbonara which I thought would be better. It wasn't. Pasta still tasted stale to me and the sauce was underwhelming as well.   Overall we felt that the price for everything just wasn't worth it. Yes it's the strip and you're gonna pay more but for this price we expected top notch pasta. I felt like the meal was comparable to any run of the mill pasta place on the strip that would be cheaper.",

The menus have a light that's helpful since the ambiance calls for lower lighting.   Our waiter was Yuri and he was fantastic! Super knowledgeable and friendly. We had the meatball salad and it was so good. We also had the shrimp appetizer which was great though a bit spicy. For main course I had the pork chop which was cooked perfectly and the even the spinach (which I really don't care for)  was tasty. My husband had the veal and that was cooked to perfection, crispy though so tender you could cut it with the fork.   All in all it was a great experience and we will definitely be going back.",

Secondly, they brought me the wrong salad but they fixed that and brought me the Caesar salad I ordered. The problem is it was bad.  The lettuce had many wilted pieces in it and the croutons were mostly stale.  I usually love their Caesar salad.  I quit eating it and showed it to the servers assistant who was helping our table.

The menu items sounded delicious, but the actual food served to me proved to fall short of that. While I have never personally met the chef, I can tell you the ladies in my neighborhood church have better gravy and better meatballs then this place.   To make matters worse, the management was completely uncompromising and pretty much ruined my best friend's birthday.   We had a moderately sized party with a special request to order two meals and appetizers separately from the rest of the group. The waiter informed us that they could not do that and that they WOULD NOT DO anything to assist. He sent a manager over and he said he could do nothing for our request, and due to the owner, appetizers could not be ordered separately from our meals. We explained to two different managers our situation and they regretfully informed us that the owner refuses to make any exceptions in how his restaurant is run. Management did nothing to accommodate, even when the situation was explained to them over and over again.   If you want good Italian food I can recommend several other places that severely beat this place. Picasso, Sinatra, Andiamo, Nove, Casa di Amore, MAGGIANOS, PIZZA ROCK, BUCA DI BEPPO...literally pick any other Italian restaurant and you will be happier.    Furthermore, if you have any business colleagues, clients, friends or family that you plan to recommend here, don't.  Steve Martorano and his restaurants will never have my business again.",

With blue lighting along the bar and the kitchen, which is open (about a 1/3 wall) at the back of the restaurant.  The environment is odd. From the outside it looks like a typical classy restaurant, but once you're in it's a different story. \"Yo cuz\" is plastered all over the place, I'm guessing that's the chef's catchphrase. Several tv's around the room were playing Mystic River (a great movie but would not be my first choice for a dinner - the concept of having a distracting t.v. while in an \" elegant\" restaurant was off-putting) while funk and disco music played a little too loud.  They try to be trendy and modern, the menus are backlit and the server brings over and iPad that he uses to go over the specials and which serves as a cocktail menu/shop/dessert menu, but doesn't actually serve to order.  The servers were very professional and friendly, and provided their recommendations when we asked.  The fried mozzarella stack was very good, but a bit pricey. $22 seemed a bit much.  The main courses were not very good particularly when factoring in their cost. $28 for what amounted to 6 chicken fingers in marsala was a bit steep, and the carbonara, although a generous portion, was not very good either. The risotto was a little too al dente for my taste, although the portion was generous.  There are a lot of better dining options in Vegas.",

We were promptly greeted at check in, as was every party arriving.  We were lucky to have Paul as our server.  What more can I say than \"wow\" about his professionalism, knowledge and hospitality.  He spoke about the menu with a sincere passion for his role as ambassador to our table.  With items I would never order (vegetarian) he spoke about the menu with such confidence and intimate knowledge that he was sharing an insiders look more than just suggestive selling.  The menu was amazing.  Paul prepped us for a fabulous ride and it did not let us down once.  The freshly made mozzarella made it a necessity to have it to start.  We had their version of caprese and fried mozzarella that was evident that everything was made fresh and with love.  Indeed Paul's presentation of the menu was a love story and homage of the chefs vision and passion.   Portlons were abundant and full of flavor where you savored each bite.  Penne a la vodka was exceptional and chicken dish huge.  While the menu consisted of fresh and simple ingredients, it was the symphony of flavors and presentation that made it perfect.  Overall, a great experience from Start to finish and I would not hesitate in recommending it!  I can't wait to return!",

On this visit we sat at the bar and had the terrific Nate for our server - we started off with the meatball & salad (even to share between 2 people) - you get chef's famous big meatball and nicely seasoned Italian salad, for main course we had one of the evenings specials - the You Cuz Linguini with fresh shellfish and one of our regular favorites the Penne al Vodka. We finished off with a slice of decadent cheesecake. The entrees are served family style so definitely suitable for sharing - there's not too many side offerings but I've had the sauteed greens before. They have daily specials so be sure to check on in the Ipad. Entrees range from about $28 - $50 for most. Convenient location at the Paris and since the one at the Rio has been closed - this is the spot! They are only open for dinner. Don't miss out - check it out and you'll leave happy and full! ;-)",

    "text": "I'm half Italian. My Nana raised me on homemade and handmade pasta, delicious meatballs, incredible gravy, sumptuous salad. She was a spectacular cook. Although she passed on to the great kitchen in the sky, I keep her alive by cooking her recipes and enjoying many of the dishes she would make for me.  So why do I begin my review of Martoranos with that introduction?   Two words - the meatball. Italians do not order meatballs out. Your family's meatball is part of your heritage. No one else's can come close. Or that's how it is supposed to go.   Sadly, the meatball that Chef Martorano cooks puts my Nanas to shame. That is almost sacrilegious to say but there - I've said it. There's a reason this restaurant is famous for its meatball. It's AMAZING!   But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's start with the cool decor of the blue lit bar and the plasma TVs all around the restaurant showing Classic movies or the DJ playing tunes to dine by.   We ordered the meatball and salad appetizer and were blown away by it. Our waiter also suggested the made-fresh-that-morning fried mozzarella in gravy which was out of this world.   For our main course my lady had fresh fish over risotto. Loved it. I had veal parm with peppers, onions and gravy that was phenomenal. The side of ricotta gnocchi was light and spectacular.   This was one of the best Italian meals I ever experienced. Hands down the best meal I had in Vegas in years.   Service was 5 star. The meal was 5 star. A MUST for lovers of great Italian food!",

I don't care how loud the movie playing is, I don't care how loud the music is... When I am eating this meal, nothing else matters. I'm in heaven.  I have told friends about this and they say \" I don't even like meatballs and if I did, I would want them with spaghetti\"  I just order for them and when it gets to the table and they start eating it.... They convert right away. So even if having a meatball with a salad sounds terrible to you... Try it. You will love it.  Just a note... If not all then 99% of the 1 star reviews are from jack-off people that are upset the restaurant won't make changes to dishes to make them happy. Go to Olive Garden people ... They will do anything to accommodate you. More pepper, less salt, more sauce, no sauce, this on the side, blah blah blah. This place makes it CRYSTAL CLEAR that they will make NO CHANGES TO ANYTHING. PERIOD. I love that. Finally a place that doesn't fold to these idiots that want to have everything adjusted to them. If you want something made a certain way.. Make it at home. If you don't like MARTORANO'S policy.. AWESOME! Don't go.",

Like I'm sorry since when is the chefs ego more important than the customers prefrence. Like get over yourself. Also while the decor is aesthetically pleasing the music is way too loud you can not have dinner conversation. It's a restaurant not a club.

Especially at $44 an entree.    I certainly could've been a prick and sent my food back but from my perspective shouldn't a chef at a celebrity chef restaurant be tasting his/her own stuff and know whether or not it needs salt?

I was able to make a same day reservation. They are located inside of the Paris Casino.   We were sat on time and given beautiful menus that light up. I do not know why but I love light up menus! We were greeted right away and asked for our drink order. I went with a nice glass of red wine. I really liked that you could sit down, relax & take your time to enjoy your meal/atmosphere. Our server and bus boy were amazing. I loved their old school Italian Mob-ish uniforms. I realised the owner had to be from the South Philly area after looking at the entrees. I probably am a little biased being born and raised in Philly but any food prepared by someone in South Philly is usually amazing.   For an appetiser we ordered the fresh homemade baked mozzarella and added a side salad. When it came out the server even split it in two and plated it for my brother & myself. It was so delicious, I could have ate the whole thing myself.   For our main meals, he got veal parm with a side of fresh homemade gnocchi. I ordered Fusilli Pollo. Our meals were delicious!  The portions were just right.   I was so excited to hear there was another location at Harrahs in Atlantic City. I will def be going there soon!   I really loved the attention and personal touches our server took the time out for us. We had a great conversation and even recommended a great second glass of wine to accompany my meal with.   If you were get the chance to eat here, I promise you will not be dissapointed.",

    "text": "First, I want to really focus on the quality of service. Friends and family were enjoying a late night meal and dessert, and a waiter came up and dropped off a pizza to the table. The waiter said it's Complementary of the owner, Steve. The waiter stated, \"Steve wanted you all to have the pizza he just made.\" To me I really appreciated that on many levels. Why? Because the restaurant had many other patrons, and he gave us the pizza. We were extremely grateful for that gesture.   My good friend ordered pasta with Sunday gravy. That dish had to be some of the best I have experienced. Also, the chocolate cake was amazing. It was rich, moist, and the texture was eventful if I must say. Overall, the experience reeked of good times, and we were satisfied with our choices. Oh yea, they kept our glasses full. That is one thing I like to observe at establishments.",

    "text": "Ugh...what is a guy to do?  With so many great and interesting eateries scattered up and down The Strip, I would've thought I'd have a problem narrowing down my pick of where to go for my last expense-able meal for work.  Sadly, instead, I was left to pick from whatever was still open in Paris and Bally's.  Not a terrible lineup, but not exactly the best Vegas has to offer either.  Which led me to Martorano's - a place I knew nothing about, but with a menu of pastas that was all too alluring!  While it was Martorano's flashy, Miami Beach-esque looks that initially caught my attention (which makes sense, given its Miami origins), it was actually their menu that sold me.  Their starters, salads, meat/entree specialties, pizzas, and sandwiches looked pretty interesting, but it was said pasta dishes that I was set on trying.  I was originally eyeing either their Bucatini Carbonara or Fusilli Pollo, but I opted at the last second to go with their TAGLIATELLE with a Beef, Veal, and Pork Bolognese ($36) from their list of featured dishes.  Now, when the dish first came out, I was a little disappointed.  For one, the bolognese looked a little watery/wet to me, but more significantly, it felt light on pasta.  As I ate through the dish, the former turned out to be a little True, but I was wrong on the latter.  Though it didn't seem like there was a lot, there was plenty of tagliatelle (which was perfectly al dente, by the way).  I just wish the bolognese was a bit tighter; as flavorful as it was, it would've felt more hearty/robust if it didn't seem so diluted.  Beyond the food (BTW, their bread with their chili oil is awesome), I thought the service was pretty solid.  My server (bartender?) was friendly and checked on me several times, which I appreciated.  Unfortunately though, it's hard to get too excited about Martorano's thanks to their prices.  I hate saying a place is \"overpriced\" since there's no way to know the economics of a business, but I don't think it's unfair to say that I wouldn't have ordered my $36 pasta (or come here entirely) if I was paying out of my own pocket.  Not bad, just not sure it's worth the prices.  THREE AND A HALF STARS rounded down.",

When ordering, talked uss off the three-course meal.  Why have a poster outside with specials if your waiter talks you off of it?  Saw him twice more after ordering, once before drinks came, and then when the bill came.  Will I go again?  Yes, food is fucking amazing.  Service?  Maybe dont expect too much.

    "text": "Imagine a tattooed tough guy posing as a a makeup-wearing Chef. This, apparently is the man responsible for the classic food served at Martorano's. This peculiar mix delivers a mixed bag at hefty prices.  We started with the calamari and Tomato Mozzarella.  Both were excellent. The Calamari featured a touch of spice and the ringlets were tender and flavorful. The tomato was meaty and held up to the equally dense cheese. The Veal Picatta was tender and not cloying with lemon.  So, why the 3 Stars? Two reasons. Try to find the cost of a meal at Martorano's. Yes, photos are on Yelp, but on no official website. What are they trying to hide?  Clearly they know this is an overpriced restaurant. Secondly, over $42 for Veal Picatta? Enough said.   I'm not sure why the Marketing Department behind this place felt a makeup encrusted tough guy was the right \"face\" behind a brand. The image caused my wife to laugh on previous visits to the city, hence the reason we never visited this place. I finally tried because I was part of a group. I'm glad I tried it, but it is doubtful I will ever return. Like the guy in the photo and the hidden prices, it just seems sleazy. After a visit, I know that to be right.",

Addition to that I ordered the Martorano's salad and it was drenched in dressing to the point that it was too acidic and unbearable to eat. Not only was the salad distasteful, so was the attitude from their manager who you think would help with the situation.

So I had to order an entree in order to get that as a side. Turns out gnocchi is only a side not an entree. No you cannot order it alone. The gnocchi was big enough for a meal.

I thought they were feeding mice. The entrees were nothing special. We had the chicken permigliano (however you spell it). It comes with no sides!!! And it wasn't even good. It was a fried piece of chicken with cheese on top. Seriously don't waste your money. This place sucks. Overpriced and they are greedy with their portions.

We have dined most locations more than once; and this was by far the worst experience that we have ever had. Being from Philadelphia and fairly familiar with the cuisine and the restaurant itself. I will have to say that our waitress (Jessica) was excellent and none of it was her fault. We had reservations at 8:30PM and were not seated until 8:40 PM; everyone was crowding the hostess stand. We were finally seated and looking at our menu I order Veal Parmigiana with Gnocchi which I do every location. I was told at first that veal parm is not on the menu but it was on the menu outside the restaurant and every other restaurant that I have been to; but then I was told that they will make an \"exception\". Then moments later I was told that they were out of Gnocchi (I was the 24th order and they only had 23 orders). How do you run out of Gnocchi on a Sunday night when you have it on your menu and you are still open for another 2-3 hours minimum? This is not acceptable for a place that has reservations and is accepting walk-ins. I got my Veal Parmigiana and it was the size of my fist (which isn't that large) and it was very thick and had bones in it (not usual for Veal Parmigiana)  Martorano's was so much better atmosphere, presentation, and family like at the Rio;  at Paris I feel like its get in and get out not enjoyable.",

They had no personality, just not friendly.  Waited for service a long time then no interaction at all, very different from Rio.   Food. I ordered exactly the same items as last time. Meatball and salad. It was the same, delicious. Bread with oil very good. Spaghetti Dob also very good.   Atmosphere....none there were tons of empty tables inside the restaurant where the theme and atmosphere are yet they sat us on top of a huge party outside in the walkway to hear and see all the drunks walk by, so no atmosphere on the patio....again way different than the cool setting at the Rio with Rocky movies and music.",

First of all if you are staying or gambling at Paris or Bally's, good Italian, real good. Can I get better in Utica, NY or Philly or Brooklyn or Jersey or....mom's kitchen, yeah, yeah, maybe, but you are in Vegas. If you like veal, you gotta try the house Veal Cutlet Martorano. It is spicy with peppers and really sharp tasty cheese. I get veal all over and am a pretty good cook myself, I'm gonna figure this recipe out (steal it)!  I had it with the sauteed greens (spinach) crisp, fresh & tasty. Why not escarole? I was drinking bourbon, so the food review ends there.  Now if you want a little privacy, stay off the rail with all the casino pedestrian traffic. Interior is ok. I don't get the movies or music, give me Italian music, Martorano!  Wait & bus were attentive and personable. I don't get the lit up menus, but then again I'm old fashioned.  My food was 4 star, I'd give the place 3.5 overall, and yeah I'll be back for the veal & greens.",

    "text": "What started out as a sub-par experience turned into a fun night.  We had reservations for 7:15, and the restaurant was absolutely packed when we arrived.  We waited about 45 minutes to an hour after our reservation time before being seated.  We actually had decided to leave because we had tickets to a show and were afraid we'd miss it.  Upon discussing the situation with the manager (or perhaps owner?), he promised to make it work.  We were assigned a manager or some type of higher-up as our waiter, and he was wonderful.  Bread with oil and vinegar was served (one of the things I miss most about Italy!) as an appetizer.  I ordered the tagliatelle alla bolognese and a red wine that the waiter suggested (which paired nicely).  Our food arrived promptly, and was flavorful and authentic.  The other two people in my party enjoyed the meal as well.  We had a great time and made it to the show.  They even gave us our meals on the house!   I deducted one star mostly because of the hostess.  She kept quoting huge parties a 20 minute wait time when it was clearly going to be over an hour.  She seemed quite inexperienced.  That aside, I would definitely go back next time I'm in town, but maybe on a night I don't have other plans.",

    "text": "This is not authentic Italian. But it's authentic NYC Italian. There's a difference. You don't want to go here for an authentic Tuscan dish, but if you want some spaghetti and meatballs, or what I had - the rigatoni with short ribs in \"Sunday gravy,\" was amazing. There's a barrier between comfort food and high-end cuisine in Vegas. But sometimes you don't want a $100 steak...some home-style pasta and sauce hits the spot. And at $28 for my entree, it actually was a very affordable place with n upscale feel. My meal at Martorano's was exceptional. Filling and delicious.  My only complaint is that the drinks are ridiculously priced. I paid $28 for my entree and $26 for 2 Jim Beam drinks (their house bourbon). Sorry, but Jim Beam is not a $13 per drink bourbon. Especially when drinks are measured exactly in jiggers and the bartender doesn't have the option of making it a bit stronger to please the guest. I'm not so upset about the booze content except that they weren't able to make a drink to my liking because it was 75% mixer.  Next time, I'll do beer. Safer and cheaper. But overall, love this place. Affordable but still pretty upscale. Down to earth with the food, but the drinks are outrageous. I'm basing this review solely on the food - not the drinks. Five stars all the way for food, and this is a restaurant after all, so I'll let the drink prices slide.",

I'm still drooling over my dinner last night.   Let me begin by saying the this restaurant has a modern, club like feel. Blue lights, disco balls, sleek bar....and REALLY loud music (I could have done without the last part. The music was so loud I could not hear own waiter and make it difficult to sustain conversation. On the upside, they were playing my jams so I spent most of the time lip singing in my seat as I waiting for my food).   They provided us with a small complimentary portion of pate on toasted sliced bread. I couldn't hear the waiter, so I can't tell you what is was exactly...whatever it was, it was delicious. Complimentary bread was left on the table with olive oil, cheese and some kind of oil based chili sauce for dipping. I live a gluten free life style and unfortunately they do not offer gluten free bread. (They do however offer gluten free pasta.)  As for my meal, I started with an EXTRA dirty martini which was on point. Props to the bartender. For dinner I ordered the pork chop which was one of the chef specials for the evening. I highly recommend, it was HUGE, perfectly seared and seasoned sitting upon a bed of cooked greens with the most delicious peppers which added the perfect amount of a kick.   I definitely recommend this place, I left stuffed and oh so satisfied.",

It was surrounded by a delicious italian dressing topped salad. For entree i got the carbonara. The serving size was more than enough and it tasted so good with the cream sauce and egg yoke. I have no complaints. None. Next time i'm in Vegas i will be a repeat customer. This place lived up to all expectations.",

The food was good, although it took a really, really long time to arrive. The service was good in a awkward, trying to hard kind of way.   My mom did not lover her entree, unfortunately. So we asked for it to be boxed up, because she only ate 2 bites. Both the waiter and manager knew she did not like it, and after the long wait, If I was the manager, I would have probably comped it.

    "text": "A relatively new restaurant in between Bally's and Paris, which replaced another Italian restaurant. I will say this place is much better than the previous restaurant, but that's about it. The decor is very nice, modern with a classic touch, very inviting. It's a restaurant slash sort of night club with a DJ slash bar. When we were in there happened to be a Jazzercise convention in town and all of a sudden 30 women from outside and inside the restaurant went to the dance floor and danced their shoes off. It was a nice touch to the evening.  5 of us sat at the bar, which ended up be very nice, since we got a corner.  I will say the whole Yo Cuz thing and life size posters of Steve and him on TV over the bar in a loop cooking just doesn't cut it for me. It was almost a turn off. Seeing a tattooed jacked guy in a tight shirt and cooking with no audio over and over got old very fast. I would rather see a logo spinning or a game on TV.  To start with the menus illuminate! Very classy touch. How many times is it too dark and you can't read the menu, this is the first time seeing anything like this. Their main menu opens up and it has a easy on the eyes white glow. In addition they have an iPad for drink specials AND food specials. We weren't told about this until after we ordered appetizers as it wasn't clear that there was more to the iPad menu. For drinks I had an amazingly smooth vodka martini, highly recommend it.  For appetizers we shared the meatball salad, the eggplant stack and the fried calamari martorano. The meatball salad is a great idea, haven't seen that too much however you need to have a good meatball. Not the worst meatball but frankly it was not good. Way too dry and I believe too much pork. They say it was voted one of the best meatballs around, they probably didn't have real Italians try them. Do not get it, you will be disappointed.  The eggplant stack was good, nice crust on the eggplant again nothing special. Now the Calamari Martorano, that's no normal fried calamari, and this time I mean that it a good way. The sweet and spicy pepper tomato sauce with balsamic vinegar was delicious. The calamari were tender and the plate was full of flavor. For an extra spice drizzle the spicy oil they bring it with the bread! One thing I don't understand is they have a second fried calamari dish, why have two? I would rather see a different dish.  For the main dish I ordered off the specials (see the iPad). I had the double cut pork chop in a vinegar pepper sauce. The pork was cooked through and through, but more importantly the meat was very moist and full of flavor. It's tough to cook pork all the way and keep it moist and tender, these guys know how. In addition it was a very large portion, as we noticed on a lot of there dishes.  Have to give credit to the bar back, not only did she clean up and help the bartenders, she served our appetizers family-style and was on top of anything we needed. Made the experience at the bar feel like we had a waitress, nice job.  You get a lot for the money, big portions and big flavor at Martorano's!",

We don't particularly do steakhouses, but wanted a substantial meal to share after a long day of travel.  The lasagna was recommended by an employee; it was not on the menu.  There seems to be an \"off the menu\" menu which you have to know to ask for.  They were out of the lasagna so we chose shrimp over spaghetti with a lemon butter sauce and the \"famous\" meatball salad.  The meatball was dense and just ok; the salad was drowning in dressing and basically inedible.  The pasta dish was again just ok.  Mind you, we had no alcohol, one salad, and one entree.  The bill was in the vicinity of $88!  For that kind of money, I expect much, much more. Mediocre, at best.",

His assistant, Juan, was spot on with all of the service. Get the eggplant stack and the meatball salad. If you have room, get the Philly Cheesesteak. You wont regret it.

I enjoyed the modern touches such as the music played and the movie that could be watched on the TVs during our meal. The light up menus were neat and I enjoyed the overall atmosphere. Waiter was nice and the \"drink man\" was very attentive. It's Vegas and by now I had come to expect it but the prices were $$$$. Two people could easily spend $100; more if cocktails are had. As mentioned though, it was expected. However, the food was just okay. It was tasty and a nice mix of authentic flavors but my $40 dinner didn't taste like a $40 dinner but more a $20 dinner. I think my biggest \"issues\" were employees eating \"on breaks\" right next to our table and it seemed like the owner had a \"This is my restaurant and I don't care what you want or what you think\" attitude. And while it is, and he's allowed, I just didn't feel it creates a friendly atmosphere to start. All-in-all, a nice time but unless someone else catches the bill next time I don't think we'll be back.",

However, I am happy to announce that I was wrong & anyone that doesn't try this place at least once is missing out. LOL! I had been craving a good beef carpaccio for a long time and that was the 1st thing I saw on their menu. Their service is awesome(we sat at the bar,) their pours are heavy, & their food is top notch. My husband and I shared the fried mozzarella that was topped with a delicious marinara, and their creamy penne pasta that had peas, mushrooms, and chicken. YUMMMMM!! Their pastas and the rest of their dishes are all homemade. No frozen stuff here! The atmosphere was superb as well. I love the lighting. Perfect quiet spot for a cozy dinner date. We will definitely be back!",

He saw I was looking at yelp and asked if i was going to do a review.  i said yes, and he asked if he was going to get 5 stars.  To be polite, I said yes.  The push of a good review was a turn off.

We ordered three appetizers to sample and when they arrived at the table, to people came right over and plated the food for us. The knowledge, recommendations, and courtesy extended to us throughout the meal was astounding. Now on to the food:  We first came here about three years ago and we've been talking about it ever since. When we talk to people about Martorano's we say, \"It's not only the best Italian food we've ever had, it's the best food we've ever had, period.\"  When coming back this time, we were afraid that we \"talked it up too much\" but Steve Martorano's place lived up to and exceeded our expectations! Bravo!  We are particularly impressed with the attention to detail paid to seemingly ordinary dishes. We had three appetizers: a Caesar Salad, a meatball, and some fried mozzarella. Each of the three dishes made us chew our food more slowly to savor every bite. For our meals, we had the Chicken Parmigiana and the Fusilli Pollo. Both were amazing as well. We weren't going to have dessert, but Brandon sold us on the Cannoli. Now, I come from an Italian family from Boston, so we know our Cannolis. We've had Wholly Cannoli from Worcester and Mike's Pastries Cannolis from Boston and this Cannoli blew them both out of the water. Even the coffee was the best I've had in Vegas.   10 out of 10. A must. Totally worth the price. Spread the word!",

The food there is made to order and tastes just like grandma used to make, I couldn't hardly contain myself from ordering more food just to try it. This place has an amazing menu and great quality food, not to mention a very home feel to it, even though its upscsle.  The wait staff is professional, curious, knowledgeable and also very concerned with making you feel like your home. ( as for Paul, our entire menu from drinks to entree were of his choosing and we couldn't have been more satisfied)  To start: the bread and dipping sauces are just amazing. We ordered a homemade mozzarella and tomatoes antipasto, this was to die for! 4 layers of handmade cheese with thick, fresh and ripened tomatoes between them, fresh basil and a 20 year aged balsamic vinaigrette.  I cannot say enough about it.  We also ordered the chicken parmesan that was on special with a side of pasta and their famous meatball....OMG it was amazing! The chicken was perfect, topped with fresh ricotta and mozzarella, not to mention the fresh tomatoe to round it all out. The pasta, always served (al dente) has changed my view on how pasta should taste and that meatball... was worth every stretched out millimeter in my stomach.  All in all, this place was worth the money and time spent, we will be visiting here again on our next Vegas trip.",

It came with olive oil or cheese or spicy olive oil and none of that helped it. Just gross. For my main meal I got the veal piccata and risotto. There was two big pieces of veal and plentiful sauce but just not much flavor. And by the time I was halfway through the sauce was cold and it was congealed into a jelly like sticky glue. Risotto had zero flavor. It was supposed to have fresh veggies and cheese but veggies looked and tasted canned and it was just blah.  I did have chocolate cake for dessert and it was very moist and good. I saved more than half for next day but unfortunately got very sick to my stomach about 30 minutes after this meal so I ended up throwing it away because I don't know what I ate here that did not agree with me.

The ambiance looks like a lower class Italian restaurant whereas the prices match something more elegant. I feel like they couldn't decide which direction they wanted to go in.   I ordered the three course meal paired with wine. For the first course the wine was paired with the food but for the next two courses our food came before the wine. I feel that the wine should have been brought out first so I could enjoy it throughout the whole meal instead of having to wait for it.   I also wanted to order a coke but our waiter was never in sight. I probably saw every other server but him. He was nice but I just felt he was absent when we needed him. (Side note: I never ended up ordering the coke.)  The food was good though. I started with the meatball which was tender and paired with red sauce and peppers. For the second course I ordered bucatini with red sauce. That was also good and I was lucky enough to have leftovers to take to work the next day. For dessert I ordered their cannoli. I loved it and paired with the sweet dessert wine it tasted really good.   Good food, just ok service and ambiance.   I enjoyed it here but just sub par.",

The restaurant is a relocation or spin off of Cafe Martorano's which was at the Rio for many years. I think this is an excellent restaurant with one severe drawback. At night (weekends?) they turn up the music obnoxiously loud as if it's a night club. It's not a night club, it's a restaurant that becomes impossible to have a conversation in. I have never seen the restaurant packed when they do this, as it clearly drives away more traffic than it attracts.",

The hand stretched mozzarella cheese was delicious until they brought our calamari dish out. I ordered a white sauce clam dish and well I guess I'm not a clam sauce type of girl. I couldn't swallow it down. It was too \"fishy-scented\" for me or whatever that even means to me. I did nibble off someone else pollo chicken pasta dish but honestly with appetizers that good it was hard to compare. The service was great and the bill was great too aka expensive. I wouldn't return because the birthday boy raved about a pork pasta dish that I can't eat. Never say never though maybe appetizer pit stop? Only time will tell.

All extremely friendly and knowledgable.  Our food was fantastic -- although we over ordered.  We started with a meatball appetizer -- two huge meatballs with yummy red sauce and two lumps of delicious ricotta.  There were four of us at dinner and we scarfed that down because it was so good.  We ordered two caesar salads to split -- they brought us out a huge family style caesar salad that was enough for 8 people!  We each ordered a pasta entree and I truly think after the app and the salad we could have split one!  No where to bring leftovers to so we were sad to leave so much behind!  The bolognese was amazing...the carbonara fresh and tasty...the penne ala vodka was the only disappointing thing we ordered...very dry and kinda just tasted like red sauce on some yummy pasta.  We were celebrating a birthday and they came to our table and sang and brought the most delicious vanilla ice cream or gelato.  The place turns into a \"disco\" or dance place after hours -- kinda odd for an Italian place -- but the music they were playing throughout the evening (all fun 80's type of dance music) was super fun as well.  Enjoy!  Tell our friends hello.",

Thought I would give it another try this week when I was back for another restaurant related convention. this time, the meal was terrible and the service was indifferent.   The bartender raved about how great the Philly Cheese Steak was and basically told me to order it. when it arrived it was so salty it was not edible. don't misunderstand, I love Philly Steaks and I like salty food as well, but this was disgusting. After he saw I couldn't eat it, he asked if I wanted something else. I ordered a salad and decided to call it a day and chalk it up to a bad meal. However when I received the check, I was amazed to find that the overpriced $18 sandwich  (of which I ate less than half) was on the bill along with the salad.  Bottom line I will never go back. Bad food and Bad service is a lethal injection in our business.",

Actually not that bad. Pretty decent meatballs, sauce that apparently is called \"gravy.\" (Dear Steve Martorano: it's called sauce. Gravy is what you put on turkey on Thanksgiving. It's made from the juices and drippings of the bird. Look it up, cuz.)  So yeah, food was alright. That's as far as this review goes for positive feedback. Go to Martorano's if you enjoy the following:  - LED backlit menus - an iPad drink menu that gets taken away as soon as you order your first drink (want to peruse the drink menu? Good luck tracking down your waiter to get it.)  - Disco lights that rotate over your table constantly, changing the color of your food from pink to yellow to green to bright white.  - the same 10 loud songs that totally don't fit the meal playing over and over again because apparently whoever is in charge of the music found a mix CD from 1997 in the trash outside of Bally's (Hope you like Doo Doo Brown and Jock Jams vol. 3 while you eat!).  - American Hustle playing on the TV's all around the place. Now listen, I'm into film, I'm a grown ass man, but I don't really appreciate watching permed-up Bradley Cooper mount Amy Adams while I dip my bread in olive oil, ya dig? But apparently they have also been known to play The Godfather pt. 2, which totally fits in with the music. NOT.  This place is what I'd expect from a guy with \"Yo Cuz\" tattooed on his arm. It's like a 14 year old kid tried DJing for 3 years, had no talent, stole his grandmother's sauce recipe (not gravy. SAUCE.), and opened a bunch of restaurants with shallow decor, a limited menu, and ZERO imagination. This is a perfect example of good food with piss poor execution. Slow it down, Steve, ditch all of the flashy crap, and dedicate the place to serving good food. Because the food isn't worth shit when the dining experience is akin to root canal.   I'm looking forward to heading back next year, when this place is out of business and is replaced by a decent Italian restaurant, just like the one it replaced.  Final Verdict: +1 Decent Food -1 Music -1 Lights, TV's, General Atmosphere -1 Service (Wait staff is alright. But ordering from an ipad that you share with other tables? Not so much. Oh and be sure to fill out the survey on the ipod touch when you get the bill! It's SO hip!)  I won't say avoid at all costs - but get the food to go. Do not eat in the dining room.",

Service slow (Sunday night in December) we ordered the Calamari as an appetizer (which was OK) and literally a minute after another waiter showed up with our Entrees! The look on his face when I asked him to come back later was priceless!   We both had the Veal as Entrees, when It came back the second time, I was very unimpressed. It was just a piece of Breaded Veal with a thick sauce and sliced Parmesan cheese.  No Veg, no sides, nothing.   The sauce had huge pieces of a very spicy pepper, I love hot and spicy food, but this didn't go with the dish at all.   It's an expensive place, my wife works for Caesars ent, so we got a discount. To be honest.... There's far better Italian restaurants in Las Vegas for the same prices.",

    "text": "This restaurant was a complete disappointment. Disappointed because it wasn't very good. Disappointed because so many people told me that they HEARD it was good. AND most of all. Disappointed because we did not go to Carmines in Caesars Palace.    This is Vegas. This restaurant should be good for a few basic reasons.   1. It's Vegas and it's a restaurant in a hotel on the strip.  2. It's in the Paris hotel. This is a nice hotel (for the most part) and to have an Italian restaurant of this nature in this hotel is a shame.   3.  This restaurant is not to far from Gordon Ramsey's steak house. Have you been there?  It's amazing. If I were Gordon Ramsey I would not want to be in the same building as this so called Italian restaurant.     OK. Enough rant. Now the facts. Here's my review.   This restaurant su*ked!!  Plain and simple. I ordered a Cesar salad. If I order a Cesar salad at the Olive Garden I know what I am going to get. I am going to get a mediocre salad with bottled Cesar dressing. Oh.......and not only will I not get anchovies in my Cesar salad, I think most olive gardens do not have anchovies anywhere in the restaurant. But this is not the Olive Garden. This is a fancy Italian restaurant in Vegas on the Strip in the Paris hotel surly they will do a Cesar salad right?  Won't they? .............well......the answer is no. And not only do they do it wrong. They do not even realize it. The Cesar salad at this Italian restaurant doesn't come with anchovies. That is the standard Cesar salad. (I should have left at that point). But.....unlike the Olive Garden you can request them. ....  yea........When my Cesar salad came out, it came with a side of anchovies. ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME. That is not how you do it. You do not add the anchovies that way. Even I know that. What a joke.   OK. One more food item. I know I have rambled on.   I love nochie. It is my very favorite Italian food. Being Italian my self....(well, mostly anyway) I fell in love with this dish when I was a kid and my friends mom in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania would make it from scratch when I would go to his house on the weekends. WOW!!! It was amazing. This was not the same experience. This nochie tasted like chef Boy-Ar-De  make it last March and was kind enough to put it in a can for the Cuz that runs this restaurant. It was hard. It wasn't dumpling like and tasted blan. Yuk!!   A lot of words in this review I know. But in Vegas at a hotel like the Paris the food should be better. I have had a better Italian meal at the Olive Garden.   Stay  away!!!!",

One the menu, everything seemed in line with the pricing you would expect with added sides. But  everything is ala-cart ($10 for side of spinach and $12 for side of spaghetti) and served in plates that are their own separate full plates so you are reaching three plates over to get your vegetable or pasta.  For the price and service the food greatness does not make up for the other ineptness!  I would not recommend  this restaurant with so many others in the vicinity...if I could have, 2.5 stars and a pass! Never again.",

    "text": "Simply stated, everyone should be aware that this establishment refuses to accommodate any food allergies or food related diseases.   While I have a number of food allergies, I am definitely not one of those individuals who asks for outrageous customizations to the menu in order to be accommodated and I have never had to walk out of a restaurant due to a refusal to be served - not even in France, where I had to ask (in English!) to have my meal prepared without butter. So, imagine my surprise when I sat down with my extended family, for a birthday dinner for my aunt, and the waiter flat out refused to serve me one of the salads on the menu without dressing and a side of olive oil and vinegar. I did not ask for a dish to be prepared differently, only to not have salad dressing. I explained to the waiter it was a severe allergy and that I would only be ordering wine and the salad and he was so rude and obnoxious in his refusal that he reduced me to tears in front of 8 family members.   Needless to say, my fiance and I left the restaurant and my aunt's celebration and will never return to this establishment. From what I understand from those that stayed, the salads were all prepared with far too much dressing, their version of \"al dente\" pasta is literally a workout to chew and is really nothing more than under-cooked and the service and attitude of the staff never improved. With so many options available in Las Vegas and even just within the Paris, I would be surprised to see this place still in business when I next return.",

We had the salad and meatball, penne alla vodka, and chicken parm. The meatball was dry and hard. The salad was fresh and crisp, but we didn't enjoy the meatball sauce in the lettuce. The penne alla vodka was a good size serving, but lacked flavor.   Atmosphere - Don't get me wrong I'm a millennial and we're attached to our phones, but the light up menus and ordering cocktails through an iPad was tacky and unproductive. The Disco Balls hanging from the ceiling and the large Virgin Mary statue was confusing and made me uncomfortable. If you're looking for good Italian food on the strip try LAVO or take a hike to Summerlin for Parma by Chef Marc",

I love Italian food and if you do too, do yourself a favor and check this place out.   This was my first visit to the Paris Las Vegas location, and it did not disappoint.  We started with the Homemade Mozzarella with olive oil and sea salt and it just melts in your mouth.  Then I had the Martorano Salad which was popping with veggies, something I love.  For dinner, I went with the Veal Cutlet Martorano which is topped with San Marzano tomatoes and this dish has an amazing combination of sweet and hot that balances your taste buds perfectly.  The table also split the Bucatini Carbonara, which is full of creamy goodness and the pasta is amazingly fresh.    This guy knows Italian food and he is a big guy so the portions are quite large.  I see a lot of people on this site reviewing this place as too pricey and that could not be further from the truth.  Each dish contains large portions, even the salads, so pack an appetite.  If you're looking for a $10 Chicken Parmesan, go to Olive Garden, this place is not for you.",

Spaghetti noodles were thick and very good as well. The meatball was average. Gnocchi - a waste, I've had much better.   First, decor was nice but really doesn't match the Paris Hotel feel.   Our waiter Mark...ugh...the only time he became somewhat \"attentive/friendly\" was when he realized we started questioning the bill and asked for his name. He was nowhere near friendly right from the start. When I asked if there was a kids menu he said no in a condescending tone, like I was asking a foolish question.  A more professional response would be \"I'm so sorry, no we do not.\" He asked if we wanted wine.  When a few  (but not all) of us said no, he walked away while my father was still deciding what to get. When my mom said it was my birthday he dismissed it right away but then said a brief (\"I really dont care\" tone) \"happy birthday\" when she repeated it. Also, it was disheartening to see what I think was the manager (heavier set older caucasian man) check on everyone's table except for ours. The only pleasant person was our busser. The host at the entrance wasn't as friendly too.  For their HIGH prices (27-62 per plate) and \"fancier/upscale\" dining we expected more. Shame on you for having worse service than the Applebees down the street from my home. We eat at a lot of classy restaurants but this was truly one of the most disappointing places.

    "text": "Martoranos.  This was the toughest review to write from my last trip, and not sure I'll convey what happened in this review but I'll try.  We visited the new location in the Paris Las Vegas hotel on 10/21/14.  We had walked by it during the day, thought it looked cool...liked the menu...so researched it a bit while sitting at the pool and decided that we had to go, seeing how SO MANY celebs and notable people ranked Chef Martorano's food SO high!  So we were pretty excited to check it all out and enjoy a great meal.  We were seated on time at a table on the 'outside' of the restaurant, so we didn't get that movies on the wall, disco ball in the center kind of experience...but did enjoy the al fresco style dining and people watching in the Paris shops area.  Right next to us was a group of 8 conventioneers, who were a bit loud from time to time and seemed to dominate the service as you will see below.  We were greeted by Georgio (hope I spelled that right) after a good 5-10 minutes of perusing the menu on our own.  He dropped off an iPad with the drink menu, took our \"flat or sparkling\" water order, and explained the specials for the night, which I took note of a seafood selection that he described as a \"seafood party in your mouth\"...something about that was both comical and odd...not sure why though.  We quickly found out that the iPad was malfunctioning, if you pressed on anything it would just freeze.  So we were unable to check out any kind of special drink selection (we were thinking martini style special followed by some wine with dinner).  Georgio then became a bit occupied with pouring wine for the conventioneers so we were able to flag down his 'assistant' Jason (I think he was an assistant, or in training or something) who quickly brought us a new iPad.  Georgio then came back and took our order...not asking if we'd like to start with an appetizer, not asking if we'd like a drink, but simply saying \"are you ready to order\"...which led to her saying \"yeah I want the martini, the seafood special...\" him looking at me so i had to say \"I want a Manhattan up with Makers, we're splitting the eggplant parm and I'll take the Buitoni Meatball\"...just not how you serve a couple in a high end establishment.  So then another 10 minutes passed.  The restaurant was about 70% full and the bar was not busy.  We had no drinks and had been sitting there for a total of 25 minutes.  Jason kept looking and then came over to say \"didn't you guys order drinks?\" to which he promptly went to the bar and resolved..bringing us our drinks moments later.  Our eggplant parm arrived shortly thereafter and I have to say it was AWESOME!!  Probably the best I've had..and was a perfect size to split with a date.  After clearing the plates and then taking a wine order (glasses, not a full bottle) the night seemed to be moving more smoothly....until the entrees.  My entree came out but her food did not.  Jason was kind enough to explain that the food was all cooked fresh to order and sent as soon as it was ready, that they didn't hold anything in the kitchen.  Ok, I'm cool with that.  But who knew a buitoni (think thick linguini) and meatball cooked 5-10 minutes quicker than some seafood (clams, shrimp, etc..seafood party) over linguni?  Throughout this whole process, Jason was super attentive to our needs and seemed to really try and keep things going...while Georgio was busy trying to be cool, pouring drinks for the big convention table, and coming up with cheezy Italian style lines to say to everyone.  The manager actually came over and apologized, and first offered another glass of wine (which we both had a full glass) so we declined..then said \"well, just pick out a desert and we'll take care of it for you\"...seemed to me a nice gesture and the right thing to do.  Her food finally came out and I do have to say we both LOVED our meals.  I had the best friggin' meatball ever and she had an awesome seafood dish.  The food at this place is worth every penny of the price.  Jason continued to check in on us, making sure things were going smooth...while Georgio continued posturing for everyone.  Ever see a person who thinks he's a special gift to everyone, and has no clue he is actually really cheesy and borderline annoying?  Anyway...  We went on to split a desert (thinking this was on the house)...tiramisu.  Now, I'm not even a fan of tiramisu but holy smokes..it was AWESOME!!  We were then brought the bill...which of course did not have the desert or anything comped...but at that point we didn't really want to make a big deal and just settled up.    Funny that on our way out, we asked to have our photo taken and who stepped up?  Yep, Jason!  We thanked him for taking care of us all night and actually tipped him separate, fearful that the tip on the bill would all go to Georgio.  My hope is that if anyone from the restaurant reads this, GIVE JASON A PROMOTION!  He was outstanding!!  Food: 5  Georgio: 2  Jason: 5  Mgr: 1",

Was deemed good. As well as pasta marinira. My father and i both ordered the clams in white sauce, we couldn't eat more than 3 bites as it was way too salty and spicy from the chilis..  We sent both entrees back and didn't order anything else.    Unfortunately we will not be ordering any pasta dishes from this resturaunt again...",

They  advertise having the best chicken parmigiana in Las Vegas and I think they are right! The lasagna was also great. Mark, our server did an outstanding job and made the night that much better. Unfortunately, we never made it to desert, we were way to full. I will definitely return on my next visit.",

Better places to go for italian.  oh yeah, bread was good but time to prepare courses meant we ate too much of it.",

Don't even ask for salt!  They will not even put the sauce in the side!!!! Eggplant stack was delicious, so was the mozzarella appetizer.   The pasta bolognese was over priced and was not worthy of a fine dining restaurant.  Yo cuz!  Get with the times,  people make changes to the food based on allergies and so that they can enjoy your food, you need to understand that and give a little on this harsh policy!.",
