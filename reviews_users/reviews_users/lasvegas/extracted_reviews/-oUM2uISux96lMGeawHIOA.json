His name tag did NOT have his real name it said \"fast...\" something but he was anything but fast! I went there for my 21st birthday thinking it would be a great idea. He asked us what we ordered 3 times. Forgot my food. We had to get the manager to do something for my birthday bc they forgot. He gave me a goblet that wasn't mine to keep. Screamed at his coworker Kaleb in front of the whole restaurant like an asshole. I don't know how this guy is still employed or how management puts up with this druggie. Thank god this location has Kaleb on staff, he was the all star employee. He was so kind fixed every problem this druggie caused, he was the only one we saw working the whole restaurant. I hope this review gives Kaleb the recognition he deserves!",

They checked on us every 45 min we were there 2 hours and 30 minutes and only ate for 20 min. Also rude and the manager in the red shirt saw it and acted like nothing happened. Go to literally any other restaurant. Maggianos at fashion show is 10 times better. Next time I'll eat from the trash cans outside my house..lol 0/10",

So that very night we decided to stop in to check it out and have dinner before our show. What a delight! Our server was very kind, our food was delicious, and the goblets are super fun. The manager even brought us out a giant rubber duck to take home! (although I have no clue where to put it)   In the end thank you for a wonderful night.

Very open yet intimate. Diners have the option to sit on the patio, in restaurant or at the bar.  We ordered artichoke dip for appetizer, a steak and salmon salad for lunch and shared a milkshake for dessert. Dip- it's a generous portion but you're going to need more crustini. Ask for more! Steak- order your cooked preference 1 degree higher. We typically like our meats at medium- rare, but it will cone out bleeding. Their medium-rare is a True rare. Comes with a huge bowl of potatoes and asparagus.  Salmon salad- Salmon is cooked deliciously and Romain is tossed in a sherry dressing. Nice and light for a warm day. Milkshake- amazing! Rich and large enough to share. There are so many options but we ordered the very berry.",

I went last night at 11 maybe 1115 . REMIND YOU ITS FRIDAY PEOPLE ARE OUT LATE. we get there and they sit us and give us the menus and not even 5 mins in they ask us what we want to eat the kitchen is about to close. they gave us ZERO time to even look at what we want. so to buy time we ask for drinks! CUPS OF WATER and COKE. after rushing us to order 10 15 mins pass and noone came by with water noones said a word to us!. we ask the waiter again for the drinks after he already took our order because he rushed us! he comes back with 3 dr pepers and limon aid saying they turned the taps off we wont get charged for the soda but well get charged for the limon aid. thats one issue.. THEN IT JUST GETS WORSE after a while of being thirsty AGAIN  we ask a gentle man who I believe was just walking by think he was the bartender he just of seen our faces that we were thirsty!!! he thankfully asked if he can grab us drinks HE WAS VERY NICE. thanks to him we got our drinks. the  we get the food and the waiter slams the plate on the table IM NOT EVEN EXADERATING I wish ..

    "text": "Sugar Factory is an ok experience. The food lacked flavor. The service started out great but gets noticeably bad the last 75% of your time there. The music is really loud. The tables are small while the plates are huge- my friend had to put her plate in her lap because there was no where else on the dinky table. The prices for the Goblets are high so look for check in deals on Yelp and other voucher websites or skip them altogether. I'd go back with the realization that their Happy Hour sucks.   We went after reading about the happy hour and what a rip-off. I'd have been more pleased if the Goblets were 50% off- end of story. Inside the server said buy one Goblet and get select apps for $3. I figured it was a great deal and thought you could choose 2 or 3 apps for $3 each, I mean the Goblet is the price of an entree at dinner for goodness sake. Well you could only choose ONE app at that price PER Goblet. I chose the burger thinking I was getting a great deal. Not so much. The burger came out and it was honest to goodness the size of a slider! It was not as others have posted pictures of who went earlier when the restaurant first opened. They honestly thought I was going to pay $3 for that little thing. The server, while nice and all smiles, failed to mention that. I'm not a greedy person but these servers should learn how to describe what they are selling their patrons.   I sent the slider back and ordered a burger. The table next to us suffered the same fate and they sent their little slider back too and asked for a traditional sized sandwich which is $13. That burger didn't arrive for 20 minutes. Three people walked by and kept saying \"itll be right out\". I wasn't in a hurry, but at a certain point you start to notice. The burger arrived and it was cooked medium (noticeably pink in the middle) so I'm not sure what took so long to cook it. lt looked great and juicy but it lacked ANY and ALL seasoning. It was bland as shit and there was no salt in sight. Even with the crispy onions strings they didn't help.  The Goblet was great but you'd get sticker shock if they listed the price of them on the menu in fact they don't list the price for ANY of their drinks. I despise sneaky restaurants that do that. You have to ask the server and it becomes a talking point when it shouldn't be. $39 for a drink is not chump change for any time of the day. On top of that they ran out of all citrus fruits at the bar- no lemons for the water, no limes for the vodka soda and no lemons for my $39 Iced Tea Vodka drink. The server had the audacity to bring over 1 (One) sad lemon slice from the end of a lemon with all the white pith on a big plate. It wasn't enough juice in that thing to squeeze a drop in a thimble. During dinner a server walks in from the back with bags of citrus fruits from the local grocery store. Who is running this operation? Get it together.  Towards the end of the meal, as usual, the server disappears and we have to ask random people and managers to bring us our check.This has become an annoying part of dining out lately. You'll get great service at the start and then it tapers off dramatically to no service at all- then they hoover over you to leave a 20% tip, but were absent the last 75% of the meal. Oddly they don't even have check presenters here. Everything is ordered and check is presented on a ipad style device. Its quick, but we never were presented with a itemized bill when they swiped our credit card or after the charge was processed. Its best to ask for a bill BEFORE paying and keep a tally of the charges.",

When we arrived it was a bit confusing there's not really a \"host\" you see while inside but eventually someone approached us and seated us. The cool big drinks are all $40. We ordered \"The Drake\" which tasted really good but was missing the candy peaches that was suppose to be inside. We ended up having to go to the bartender to ask for them. There is a ton of ice in the big drinks so you basically are there just for the experience which is nice but for $40 a big drink I'd like a little less ice for what I'm paying for. Our waiter was a bit rude and never checked on us. At the end the hype of this place is more for a cool snap or insta video, but it was cool how the dry ice is with the drinks. Our total experience was a 3/5.",

The waiter seemed too preoccupied and not vested in his job.  Over the past decade, I have enjoyed eating at the Sugar Factory due to the vast menu and creative presentation but tonight I left sad and disappointed.  I made a reservation about two months in advance on opentable and checked in at the front but I received an email about an hour later suggesting that I missed the reservation.  Service tonight was slow and not personable.  We celebrated a 21st birthday here tonight and she was carded but her birthday was not acknowledged.  Moreover I noted her 21st birthday when I made the reservation yet no one came by to say \"happy birthday.\"  The food and beverages were mediocre and nothing to rave about for the price.  I give two stars for atmosphere and presentation but nothing more.",

The big drinks that are really popular here are about $38. We got the Berry Bliss and my boyfriend and I couldn't finish it. Only half way. So I would say the portion is good for at least 2-3 people. I didn't think it was worth the price. It's just a really carbonated drink with some jelly inside. And there were only a few pieces of the jelly... it was probably that particular one but idk. The other drinks looked good as well but it's just carbonated drink with jelly. Some with candy! They're available with or without alcohol. Then we got the banana split (sundae for 2)! That was $16 and totally worth the price. The size portion is perfect and so good!!! I totally recommend that sundae. It's so good. I would come back just for it haha.",

Tried the South Beach Flair Burger which looked good but sounded weird on the menu but the taste was spot on. My wife tried the eggs Benedict and the Hollandaise was delicious. The kiddos had the banana split crepes and berries/cream waffles of which they devoured. Topped it off with the Cookie Jar Sundae which was gigantic and tasty. Probably wouldn't have tried it without the groupon but glad we went.",

Their goblet drinks are super delicious and picture worthy. We tried the cheese board to start, a monster cheesy burger (comes with mac & cheese on it!) and fetttucine Alfredo. Everything was delicious and I wish I could remember our server's name because he was so great, even put our drinks in to go cups with extra gummy worms before we left. I highly recommend this spot for a delicious and memorable meal.",

Tried the mai tai goblet and was pretty tipsy by the end of it. Didn't feel it creeping up cause it was very delicious. Sydney was amazing!!! Her service was probably one of the best we had on the strip. Made up for the price and I'd probably come back just to get that service again. Wings were good but ask for them to be well done the skin wasn't crispy enough for my liking. They have a good portion, 8... the pic I attached looked less because I had eaten some already and didn't want to show the bones. The spinach dip sucked. Don't order it if your a fan  of spinach dips. Overall, I would definitely come back. And certainly recommend it if it's your first time.",

For a drink, I got a red velvet Martini (I actually went to the Sugar Factory in NYC last year for my 21st Birthday and got it without alcohol because it was 5 days before I turned 21.) We started off with onion rings as an appetizer, with a chipotle ranch dressing. For my lunch, I had the sugar factory signature burger. However, I couldn't eat all of it because it was a big portion. Overall, everything else was delicious.",

Great for tourists and locals to experience wildly unusual tasty desserts that are definitely photo worthy.",

    "text": "Very disappointed with the presentation. Would have been told before my drink was brought out I would have definitely have a substitution. Anything to make up for the let down. One thing that sets most vendors apart is there keenness to detail. Last time I ever purchase or look at sugar factory. One experience can impact he consumer as much as the business. Would not recommend sugar factory to anyone . Definitely need to find a better place for a sugary drink . Sugar factory don has made you get half a star more concerned with the the register then the two customers. Very unhappy and will not be returning.",

I went here on a Saturday night and it wasn't too busy, and I was pleasantly surprised my boyfriend and I got seated right away. It's very fun atmosphere for a great group of friends or a cute birthday dinner! My boyfriend and I split the steak (which was amazing) so we could have room for dessert and it was well worth it of course. My only two problems I had was that the music was waaayyyy too loud. I could barely hear our waitress, I felt like I had to yell for her to hear me, let alone my boyfriend who was only right across from me. My other problem was that the restaurant felt very cramped, I felt like I was sitting at the same table with the people next to me when we first got seated and that's just too close for me personally, but they reseated us very quickly so I'm happy for that.",

The fries were nice and crispy. Their bruschetta was very yummy, but only came with 4 small pieces and was very expensive. Overall, the taste did not justify the prices.",

We stayed in the Trump Hotel so it was a very short walking distance for us. We went around 11 because the the crowd packed in shortly after so I was grateful we went early. We decided to try the Sugar Factory Club with Fries. We were also supposed to have an order of onion rings but our server either forgot to add it or the kitchen just forgot to deliver them to the table because we inquired about then twice before just saying screw it. Now on to the sandwich.... It was delicious with the avacado and herb mayo and the fries were very warm... They not piping how like I imagined them. Now on to our drink... We shared a Mai Tai with 3-4 different rums and it was simply fruity and delicious. A very wonderful experience. My hubby was very disappointed that he was not able to get a Couture Pop (his main reason for going to the Sugar Factory) but he just kept it kicking. Overall good experience.",

I would definitely come back to try the food as I only came for the drinks. Friendly staff and GREAT music. They played some early 2000's R&B. Keep up the good work!",

We came in on a Sunday afternoon and we must have picked a really bad time because I guess they were having a shift change and we didn't get to order for almost 25 minutes after looking through our menu. Our server walked past our table multiple times and didn't even make eye contact, and then when he finally came back he brought a female server with him and told us they're having a shift change and she will be our server now. It didn't make sense because even after we finally ordered our food and drinks and started on them after everything arrived, we saw him walking around within the restaurant and serving other tables and still working??  Anyways.. the food is mediocre. I'd only come back for the drinks. Things are overpriced for the quality but it is Vegas and it is a spot right on the strip so its expected. Their chocolate shake, I forgot the exact name, was really good. The Buffalo Chicken sandwich and Turkey Club we ordered was prepared fresh and a good sized serving, but we didn't find it to be anything spectacular. It was good but not as good as what some others hyped it up to be. Like I said, only come here for drinks and you'll have a good time. They have a lot of cool, interesting drinks with lots of candy and chocolate options and you can even make your own.",

    "text": "First off let me start by saying I have dined here twice before and had great service but the service that I received on 10/6/18 was ATROCIOUS.   We can in around 6pm, asked for a table for 3 inside and that we wouldn't mind waiting because it was FREEZING outside, weather showed around 60 degrees. At first the hostess said okay, and proceeded to take us inside. She then said the wait was 20 mins and \"can't you just sit outside?\" Taken aback, my group just agreed to sit outside since it was immediate seating.  Our waitress comes over right away and asks if we need any drinks, we just ask for water. About 10 mins later she came back with the water and asks if we were ready to order. We order 3 entrees and an appetizer. We then proceed to wait approximately 30 mins until we see our waitress again. Water glasses empty. All the while my party is FREEZING, there were no outside heaters expect for one that was located near the hostess stand. She says our food should be right out...but what about the appetizer.  Finally, 45 mins after ordering our food, a bus boy brings us our food along with the appetizer that should have came out before the meals. Our waitress then shows up to help with placing one meal down, I ask for silverware since we only had two setting at the table for a party of 3.....10 mins later I finally got my silverware. Obviously at this point my entire group is peeved that we've waited almost an HOUR to get our meals.  We finish eating around 7:20-7:30pm.....we wait.....and wait.... and wait.... finally around 7:50 we ask the hostess to find our waitress because we are cold, and ready to leave. We literally saw the hostess walk to our waitress, who was inside the nice warm restaurant and point to our table... our waitress walks to the back room. About 10 mins pass and I am FURIOUS its been 30 mins since we finished our meals, we want to leave and get out of the freezing cold!  My party gets up from the table to go inside and wait since at least it was warm in there. We then hear the hostess yell over their walkie talkie \"YOU BETTER GET OUT HERE, THEY'RE GOING TO LEAVE WITHOUT PAYING!!!!\"   Then, and ONLY then does out waitress magically appear with our check in hand. No apologies for the wait, no \"how was the meal\", nothing. In fact she hovered over us until we signed our check. Finally we can leave at 8:15pm, over 2 HOURS from when we got there. 2 HOURS in the cold outside. Also I would like to note that there were barely any other parties getting sat outside.  In all honesty, we SHOULD have just walked up and left considering this was the worst service I have EVER experienced in my LIFE. But I have dignity and will pay for my meal, hey I'll even leave our horrible waitress a small tip (I should have left her a big fat $0).  After this experience I know I won't be back here. Its unfortunate because I really enjoyed the atmosphere and service in the past. But I refuse to go back to a place that treated me so poorly. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice? Not going to happen.",

    "text": "No Split!  Sugar Factory will forever remain one of the cutest places to celebrate special occasions with your best girlfriends and for that I'm grateful they've re-opened. Spending over $500 after tipping on top of gratuity for a \"mediocre\" dining experience is extremely disappointing (definitely not the hip-trendy-exceptional service they're known for)!    PROS: The Chocolate Lounge was extremely patient and sat majority of my squad while the remainder of the crew (8 total) were \"tardy for the party\" on a Saturday evening! (The restaurant was very slow upstairs to be honest)  CONS: We started off with hair in one of the 8 glasses of water. Small service failure but still unacceptable.   The Pacific Salmon $29 was very over cooked; not by request.   The spinach dip $15 was terrible. I wish I could compare it to something but I'd rather not. Just skip it and thank me later!  My friends salad didn't have one drop of dressing which was completely strange. (Of course we \"found\" the waiter to make it right).  I purchased The Drake $40 for obvious reasons! Y-O-L-O  Regrettably, it looked like swamp water? Total opposite of the photo! If Drake didn't change his number so frequent, I'd call him and get his thoughts on the situation! Of course I didn't drink it. The not so souvenir cup became a filthy looking photo opp for my out of town snap chat peeps! It's an additional $15 to keep the plastic \"souvenir\" cup can you believe that?! Total rip!  The icing is the new \"no split\" check policy that our server failed to share until the end. Everyone paying towards one bill with the option to receive separate receipts of payment is so backwards and took the server way more time to settle 8 payments.   Overall I'm uncertain if I'd return which is disheartening because I've been a SF fanatic since couture pops were on trend (that's a long damn time in Kardashian years)!   Totally five star worthy but not worth it this evening!!!",

We got here at 7:30pm and it wasn't packed at all. We walked right in. You can make a reservation but you probably won't need it through the week. On the weekend, it's probably packed! Our server Manny was AMAZING! He was funny and he was very attentive! The service was perfect!  I order the caesar salad with shrimp and my boyfriend had a chicken sandwich and fries. Everything was delicious. But the thing to write about...the GOBLETS! I had the fuzzy peach mango and he had the gummy bear one. They are HUGE! It's about 2 1/2 drinks in just one goblet. They are very sweet with all the candy that's in them and they weren't very strong but they were still great. However, they are expensive! One goblet is $38 and you can't keep the goblet! That's kinda crazy if you ask me. The food isn't too bad price wise. My salad was $19. It can get loud in here...especially with the staff yelling when it's someone birthday and they deliver a dessert to the tables. Go and ask to sit in Manny's section!",

The menu don't list how much the drinks are... which is a little weird.  Well goblets are $39. The other regular cocktails are $8  But be aware at this location YOU DONT GET TO KEEP the goblet!!!!!!!!!!! You have to pay an extra $15!!!! If you however go to the their other location you pay $39 and you get to keep the cup! But at the other location don't have have dry ice! At this location they gave dry ice and they make your drink all smoky and cool!!!   Other that that, the drinks are good. Sweet! But good! I got the watermelon mojito, it was delish!!! It had a ton of candy which is cute but really not necessary because we ended up throwing most away since we can't drink a lb of candy in one sitting. Good presentation tho!",

The staff was really nice but they seemed to be having some sort of meeting behind the bar so instead of taking our drink order (we were the only ones at the bar) the bartenders were reviewing some type of policy changes and safety regulations with the managers as we awkwardly sat there waiting for them to finish discussing what they could and couldn't do.   After we ordered the bartender we making our drinks as the manager was going thru all their supplies asking questions and telling them they couldn't do this or put that there, made me a little nervous as to what exactly I was drinking and how clean it was. Definitely not a discussion you should be having in front of paying patrons",

Knowing the music was so loud why would you try to talk to me from across the table.  After ordering our food it had taken a good 35-40 for appetizers.  It wasn't busy.  Even for a house salad!  Come on now.  Everyone food didn't come out at the same time.  3 hours later and 20 minutes for the bill.  I was over it not worth $761.  We all wanted desserts but didn't want to wait another hour.    Making the reservations was hard enough to get through.  With one person telling me I had to go through a group with a set menu.  And another telling me we didn't.  Where is the communication?  For being on the Las Vegas strip you would think service would be on point.",

The waitress took a while to get to us, but no biggie - it's Vegas and it's on the strip. The food came out quickly but we were disappointed. The spaghetti and meatballs were overly salty, as were the fries, my tomato bisque was room temperature (at best) and by the time our milkshake and hot cocoa got to us we were about done with dinner. The small things we had asked for - extra parm cheese, and an extra cup took nearly 15 minutes to get after having a hard time flagging down our waitress and having to ask multiple times. The manager eventually came over and we said we needed more cheese and he said he'd take care of it. Either way, it was a long wait for those small items and I was trying not to make s big fuss. Giving them the benefit of the doubt, they were probably busy and doing their best. I still tipped $20 on a $110 bill but feel like I it wasn't worth it.... I even had a Groupon for $80 of it and still left disappointed...",

We ordered their lollipop passion goblet which is described on the menu as \"a wonderful mix of melon, coconut and pineapple blended together to create a taste sensation no one will be able to resist! Garnished with lollipops\" Our goblet came to the table and it is huge, I am glad the husband and I decided to share this drink. It had two huge rainbow lollipops and a candy necklace inside. The server pours our drink and we were surprised it had some kind of dry ice or something in it to make the drink bubble and smoke. (It was super neat) We had great service, the woman who took care of us was very attentive even though we only came in to order a drink to share. The drinks are expensive though and I wish I knew beforehand that yelp has a special. If you check in on yelp you get 50% off your goblet drink, which would have saved us at least $25, but you live and you learn! Next time I would for sure use the check in offer if it is still available.  Overall the drink was super refreshing and not too sweet. We will return. The decor of the restaurant is super cute, they have awesome looking food and great service.",

Lots of chairs and tables for big groups or even smaller intimate party sizes. The menu is super huge with lots of choices so dont get too overwhelmed. Lots of colorful and fruity drinks for the overwhelming goblet sizes. We opted to share the Raspberry Watermelon Mojito ( it was okay wish i chose something else) if you check into Yelp you get any goblet drink for half off. Steal!!!!  Besides the food and drinks i would have given it more stars but the service and the surrounding activites with the other staff was challenging. For example the buss boy was mopping right in our area where ourselves and other guests were eating and drinking as well as a walkway for patrons and servers moving back and forth with the aroma of clorox on the side very unappetizing. I dont see why the mopping was needed at that very moment when there were no spills that needed to clean up. As soon as he finished  (i told my girlfriend this was going to happen) an employee slipped and fell. Good thing she didnt get hurt too bad and right after her a guest was coming along and myself and another guest told her to watch herself because it was slippery (no visible signage) i just shook my head. Its common sense. Finally a manager told him to not do that right now. Smh.",

    "text": "This was an absolutely terrible experience. To start off, the service was horrible. I didn't get the name of my waitress but she was blonde and she had a very bad attitude. The food was so cheap and unoriginal. I ordered the signature burger and it was average. I expected higher quality from a restaurant on the strip but I shouldn't have trusted my gut. Not to mention it was outrageously overpriced! The only thing under $10 was a cup of coffee for $8. The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one was the French fries, they were simultaneously soft and crunchy. If anything, order postmates for the fries, but honestly, McDonald's is better. The goblet drinks were gross, no one can even finish them because of the obnoxious size. The drinks were a gimmick, extremely sugary and ridiculous not to mention unsanitary! Would not recommend coming here, try Black Tap for an amazing sweet and savory restaurant experience.",

Now Alfredo, sales me on coming in to try some of there signature drinks that start at $44. My time here, also being that I'm not a tourist, the drinks would always be available to me. I'm more of a Foodie, and I did Love my Turkey Burger with crumbled Bleu cheese, sauteed mushrooms and onions. With a side order of chargrilled asparagus for my side dish. Now after waiting for the actual waiter Betty to appear after waiting for a small glass of water 10 minutes. I explained to her, that I'd never eating here before. She didn't make or offer any suggestions to me. Just was kinda on a mission I guess her shift was almost over after me..so I asked, Could she give me a few minutes more?\" She replied, \"Sure thing\" and left for about 12 minutes more this time. I really didn't make too much of a stink being that she may've been Bombarded with an Abundance of customers to tend too. I ordered finally, my food was \"Superb.\" I guess I wasn't moving fast enough for this young lady. She reappeared at my table with in 10 minutes more asking, \"Was I done?\" I looked at her with half a sandwich left and shoed her away..this may've been wrong but I didn't like feeling as if my table had a meter on it. Now, I'm not getting hyped up just because I knew I'd be asking for the GM's email or speaking with the higher up before I left this establishment. I waited for I guess the shift changing, I did see the morning shift manager tell one of the hostess' that he didn't have time at the moment he'd be back..13 to 14 minutes went by before I spoke with a very caring an also intuned individual about what he's been experiencing since he's lived in Vegas as well. Geraldo was an is a splendid General Manager. Hopefully he can stay here to whip the staff into shape per say literally...it's disgusting to pay for services and then the server's are expecting a 5-18% tip..this usually is what I give IF I'm treated with courteous behavior. Geraldo reassured me that he'd speak with this young lady. He was also very aplogetic because of what had accurred.This situation that had me a little hot and bothered. Betty and the day shifts manager need additional coaching or more frequent breaks. Just a suggestion. Overall my food was Fabulous, the Proprietors are worth all the praises as well. Thanks! I will return.",

I came here with my mother in law and husband and we got a drink to share.   Looking through the drink menu we finally picked one to share and I know most places and bars don't have their prices next to the drinks but when we got the tab after ONE drink we spent $43!   Now that's a little crazy for some juice and candy with a shot of alcohol.   Anyways this place is fun but definitely only for a treat.",

    "text": "This is one of those places that you come to for all the hype and the experience. We had a Groupon for $40 off but the bill was over $100 for 2 people and 5 things so we were disappointed. However, I would come back because we learned our lesson, and you just have to know what to get. We got 2 soups, one of the goblets and 2 burgers. The French onion soup was bland and my sister's was actually artichoke dip when she looked under the cheese. It was an honest and funny mistake, however it took 10 minutes for the server to come over and get it exchanged. We got the signature lollipop goblet and it was weak. More tarty and sweet than anything else. That turned out to be $40 bucks and a huge disappointment. I think it's worth maybe 25 or 30, and then you should be able to add shots. We saw some things on the cocktail menu that we could get but being as though this was our first and probably last time for a while we decided to get what the place was known for. Meh. I will say we ended on a high note with the burgers though. Had the bleu cheese bacon and the white chocolate burger. Both were great! So next time we're in Vegas we think we'll go back and try other drinks and stick to just the burgers (and definitely try dessert  since we'll have a little extra money in our budget)",

We arrived 5 minutes early for our 8pm reservation and were told that there were reservations ahead of us who had not been seated and that we would have to bare with them. After asking several times the overwhelmed host was unable to give us an estimate on how long the wait would be.  She said the same to other guests. We overheard that others had been waiting over 30 minutes past their reservations. Ultimately at 20 minutes I spoke to a manager who immediately sat us. They maybe need more seating or a more conscious host staff.   Once we sat down our server Menz was a delight! We had no more worries other than the long wait for food. The food was delicious as were the drinks but both were a little pricey for the portion sizes. I'd eat here again but not for dinner.",

Worst restaurant experience I have ever had. Oh and the waitress never even brought my \"birthday surprise\" that cost $10.

    "text": "Exactly one week ago today my family and I along with in-laws drove to Las Vegas to celebrate my sons 9th birthday. As soon as we checked in to our hotel rooms we asked my son where he wanted to have dinner for his birthday and he said Sugar Factory.  He was so excited and us adults were excited too (we had seen pictures on Instagram, tv shows etc).  Right away I called to make a reservation for a party of nine (4 adults and 5 kids ranging from 3-9years old) at around 7:45pm.  We all got ready to head out and walked the strip a bit.  While walking and passing the restaurant we saw that it was empty and the kiddos were already hungry so I stopped and spoke with the hostess and she was able to sit us right away. We all were relieved and happy because the kids were hungry and super excited to dine there.  We were taken upstair to the \"Chocolate Room\" then our waiter came.  I forgot to get his name, I should have written it down but my oh my was this waiter so rude! I don't know if he was annoyed because it was so many of us or that we had 5 kids with us but cmon its a damn restaurant what do you expect! Any-who,  my daughter and I went to the restroom and on the way out we saw our waiter. I told him hey it's my sons birthday and right away he answered me as if he was annoyed stating they DO NOT do free birthday cheers I would have to buy a dessert and also pay a $5 fee to have the waiters come out and wish him a happy birthday.  Fine I was okay with it, I could've paid extra, not a big deal but the way he responded to me was unprofessional.  Because of his sassy attitude I decided not to bother with ordering my sons desert.  Mind you guys... it took forever for us to get our drinks...and it took forever for him to order our food! He would leave and come back minute after, lets just put it this way we literally had like a photosesh outside with all the kids because he was just taking so long.  Point blank this waiter ruined our mood, and to top it off I paid over $80 for our meal and unacceptable service. What urked me even more was the fact that his tip was already included on our bill.  I would not have left a tip at all if I had the option.  My son and I along with our in laws were looking forward to the desert and having a good birthday dinner and he ruined it. We all felt uncomfterable it was only obvious this waiter was annoyed or idk having a bad day. I was so upset and irritated by the waiter that I even wrote on the receipt stating If it wasn't for the added gratuity on the check I would have left nothing as a tip! $0! I also wrote a piece of advice to give better service next time. I hope his manager read it or who knows he probably threw it away so he wouldn't get in trouble.  Just a shame the food was really good but the service was just horrible and that alone threw off our dinner and even our mood for the rest of the night.",

I didn't realize that this was sort of a soft launch for their grand opening which is tomorrow.   The drinks and candy are what they're known for, but the actual real star at this establishment was our server Brandon! It was quite busy and frantic (typical Las Vegas restaurant on the Strip), but Brandon made our experience a very memorable one. Not only is Brandon knowledgeable and cognizant of everyone's tastes at the table, but he was extremely personable and delighted us with his upbeat personality and sharp wit!  Thank you Sugar Factory for making a comeback & thank you Brandon for your service and pleasant disposition.",

    "text": "If the music is so loud that the server can't hear the order correctly it's probably too loud.  All the fried food was so greasy that you can only assume that the food was fried twice. Our server didn't come back until the end to give us our check; we had to get our mustard and hot sauce from the busboy. And the milkshake was crazy runny. It was more like chocolate milk rather than a shake. Now I have to have another dinner to redeem myself from eating this crappy one. Would NOT go back again.   *Update on 9/12/17*  Since my last review, I got a message from Jennevive (manager) and she apologized for the subpar food and service so therefore kindly offered a free dinner on the house for me and a guest. First of all I didn't expect this kind of response... I didn't think anyone would pay attention to ONE person's bad review. But we went back to give it another chance. I immediately noticed that the music was not as loud as before (I was able to actually hold a conversation while we ate!). I must also mention that Mannie (our server) was excellent to us and treated us like VIP. He was very attentive and kind. The steak and lobster we ordered was supposed to be medium but it came out over cooked, so our server brought us another order of the same and it came out just right. Overall we were impressed with the service both from the manager and server so I did appreciate their efforts to take the time and care for a customer that has had a bad experience. It left me feeling like every customer is important to them and I was appreciative and impressed with that!",

    "text": "4-17-19 was my 21 wedding anniversary and we were visiting Vegas.  This was the only place that I really wanted to try while I was there.  It did not disappoint! I hope I am correct on this because I am writing this review late but I think our waitress name was Ashley. She was great. We are not big drinkers but due to the special occasion I wanted to splurge and try a drink. They are 40$ a pop. We got the watermelon patch goblet.  When the waitress came with the drink she asked if I wanted to video it.  So glad she did it was really cool to watch.  We shared the drink.  Perfect for two people. I got the blue cheese burger and it cost 13$ which I thought was average price for a burger.  My husband got the south beach flair burger 15$ and my daughter got the grilled chicken sandwich 16$. My son just got the chicken tenders. All the food was delicious and perfectly cooked.  Wouldn't have changed anything.  For dessert my son got the Carmel sugar daddy cheesecake shake it is suppose to come with graham cracker on the side of the glass but my son wanted rainbow sprinkles and she had no problem.  He was very happy with his dessert.  I also bought a groupon that day that saved some money.  But please remember to tip your waitress/ waiter on original price not the discounted price especially if they do a great job like Ashley.  The only thing I am disappointed With I didn't know they had an upstairs that had a chocolate bar and carousel I just read the reviews that mentioned it. Bummed I wasn't told about it.  Well I guess I just have to go back.  Oh darn!",

The Sugar Factory is indeed a cute and a popular hot spot in Vegas. They have an indoor and outdoor seating. Their signature menu offers everything from pancakes and sweet and savory crepes to burgers, salads, and pizzas.  We all had drinks on their famous goblets with dry ice that makes them fizz and bubble. The drinks and sweets were tasty, however, the food was a little bland.  The lower level is the Sugar factory dining experience as well as a confectionery offering gifts and sweets for every taste.   The music was loud and so we sat outside on the patio. I'd definitely recommend the Sugar Factory if you want awesome ice cream with lots of choices.",

    "text": "My 1st experience here was bittersweet.   The service: I went with friends to celebrate a birthday. We had a large group of 12 so it was a little hectic trying to take drinks and place orders. Now, being a Las Vegas local, not all but some places offer a local discount. My friend called and asked if they offered one, and they told her yes. HOWEVER when we arrived, I had to ask 4 different people, including the manager if they offered a local discount and NO ONE KNEW! I got really agitated because instead of someone coming back to tell me, I constantly had to ask someone else.   The food: I LOVED the pasta here! I ordered Chicken Alfredo, added shrimp and asked if they red peppers could be added to make it a little spicy. The waitress said that didn't have red peppers but could tell them to spicy it up. When I say this was the BEST PASTA I've ever had..... They seasoned the pasta so well I didn't need to add any salt or pepper. The chicken was tender and they gave BIG shrimps (about 6 to 7). Some of my friends did not like the food that they order.  The drinks: I have to say the drinks were the coolest thing ever! I had a Sexual Chocolate which literally tasted like chocolate covered strawberries. Absolutely delicious.  Overall: I was not really happy with the service (the waitress forgot to add our local discount but did fix it). She did her best. I know how tough it is trying to serve a large party. I really enjoyed my food and drink. The music was great as well. Perfect spot for a date. Next time, I will have to order one for their monstrous desserts.",

I will say, being 7.5 months pregnant and easily prone to headache, perhaps I should've chosen somewhere quieter to eat. Anyhow, that said, it's definitely a great place for a party to dine.. bachelorette, family reunion, whatever!  Bear in mind that this restaurant is Strip prices for sure so expect to pay $10-12 for an appetizer and at least $16 for an entree. Drinks and desserts are about the same.  Jake our server was super busy running around everywhere so it took a while to get our orders and refills. Because of the lunch rush, plan for at least an hour and a half meal without dessert.  I will say that their turkey burger is my absolute favorite. I tried it years ago and it's always been on my mind. It's thick, savory and seasoned, and topped with aioli! So good!  Didn't get to indulge in dessert this time but I know they big and beautiful and so are their prices!   Check in on Yelp for free bruschetta which is so worth it!",

From \"Goblets\" of cocktails to lavish ice cream sundaes, to crazy milkshakes, they also have a variety of food options to choose from.  After a couple of days of non stop drinking, I decided to lay off the booze. Although they are known for their Goblets (60 oz concoction of colorful, vibrant cocktails) I decided to skip the massive \"buzz\" and opted for something that had no alcohol. Their Milkshakes caught my attention.  Giggles Snickers Milkshake: For some reason by looking at all their desserts, I had the assumption that everything was going to be overwhelmingly sweet. To my surprise, the milkshake tasted fantastic. It was nice, creamy, and thick. It had a great oreo flavor, and I kept scooping away at the whipped cream and sprinkles. It was perfect. The presentation was exquisite. The mug was covered in chocolate with a rainbow of sprinkles and bits and pieces of Snickers everywhere. There was also a caramel waffle to top it off! SWEET! 5/5  I'll have to come back again to get sugar wasted with their Goblet's!",

I wish I could remember the name of my waitress because she also deserves all of the praise I can give. The Sugar Factory is one stop in Vegas that I recommend everyone makes.  I loved the location of this place, in the heart of the strip. It was alive and full of fun people and all of the staff was very welcoming and professional. You can also take your drink to walk around if you haven't finished it during your stay (which, unfortunately, I finished mine).  Which brings me right to the drinks. I had the \"Energy Bear Goblet\". Now I'm not really a sweets person, but this was a special occasion so I decided to bite the bullet. This was so fantastic. From presentation to taste, this was a very quality drink.   I also had the buffalo chicken sandwich and if everyone isn't ordering this, they're really doing themselves dirty. A fantastically cooked chicken with a delicious sauce and awesome toppings. So good, there was no way I could finish this and a goblet.  And if I haven't raved about the staff enough (I haven't), the service was impeccable. From the entrance to service to everything. It was a friend's birthday and Mercedes would not let her get out of the birthday dessert and song. Which was fun, and made us feel very warm and welcome.  Overall, fantastic choice for a place to celebrate. 5/5 service, 5/5 food, 5/5 location.",

This was on my Vegas bucket list from the moment I knew I was going!  Now, there are 2 locations in Vegas. This is the one outside of the Fashion Show mall. Our experience here couldn't have been better. We sat at the bar and our bartender was friendly and funny.   We ordered the Giggles Snickers Shake and I sat in excited anticipation while I waited!  When it was ready, OMG!  I could hardly contain my excitement!  It was so beautiful and huge and I couldn't wait to dive in!  My husband ate the snickers on top while I munched the warm waffles. The shake itself was the best we'd ever had!  And, because I wasn't going to let any of this go to waste, we scraped the chocolate off the side with our spoons!    The whole experience from beginning to end was everything I'd hoped!  When we were done I filled up a box of gummies to take home to my daughter. From penguins to whales to crab claws to strippers, they had every gummy you could ever want!",

We ordered a basket of fries and finally decided on the Berry Bliss goblet to share.  The fries were good, but we were both a little disappointed in our drink.  We decided on the Berry Bliss drink because in the description, it said it had fresh berries in it.  It was supposed to come with strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries, but the drink came with no fruits, just those hard berry gummy candies, like the Haribo Berries.  And I do not like those candies.",

For $34??? Unfortunately the picture here is not insta-worthy.   I guess non-alcoholic means no fun, no candy, or as they say in Vegas: no dice.   Came here for the experience and left so disappointed.   I didn't order any of the food thereafter. But the family ordered French onion soup, which was both small, and super salty. As another reviewer said - it's like a Cheesecake Factory, but sugary.   The only good thing worth noting about this place is the ambiance and the candy shop section. But we're in Vegas, so there's not a lot going for it sadly.",

Drinks were special, it's something you have to try in Vegas. 1pt   Food: I ordered a rib eye and she ordered mahi mahi tacos. The rib eye was very good and tender well cooked how I wanted it \"medium\" the sides were nothing out of the ordinary but were well prepared. 1pt   Service: waiter was a guy named Jason, that's the guy to go to! He's the man! I highly recommend requesting him. He helped us thorough the menu talked to us about the origin of the place and the popular items on the menu. He even went to the bar to make us his favorite drinks. Not usual for a waiter to also make your drinks 2pts.   Overall 5 stars, well come back again.",

Maybe the bad reviews were from people who didn't order the right items- no one in my group ordered dinner or the big sugary goblet drinks. We got appetizers and fries which were delicious.  But the best part were the drinks- we all ordered different versions of the chocolate martinis- I got the peanut butter chocolate, my boyfriend got the chocolate mint, and I forget what the others got but we all LOVED THEM!!! Unfortunately I don't have any pics (which is so not like me) but trust me you will not be disappointed with any of the creative martinis.  Sure it's expensive and service wasn't amazing but hey it's Vegas. And with a chocolate martini in your hand it's kinda hard to be mad ;)",

For the high prices, waiters that are talking about their Friday night plans on the Front of the house floor and the chicken and waffles that taste like frozen boxed chicken I think you can skip this place.   The drinks are 40 dollars and come in huge plastic cups labeled with the company name which you would expect glass for that price.  For my partner, the breakfast ordered was precooked bacon, uncooked eggs, and breakfast potatoes that Jimmy Dean whipped up before the sun rise.   As expected, the check was delivered to us just by a piece of paper. Not even in a nice receipt holder.   The experience at the Sugar Factory Restaurant was just like being a hooker in Vegas: Expensive, fast and cheap.",

    "text": "I have given this place 4 chances and they keep letting me down. I really really wanted to love this place. They look so fun.  So, first time I go and we were in the upstairs room. It felt like they didn't have enough servers because they kept disappearing. Took 30 minutes to get my bill paid after I finally went to the bartender to ask for the bill. The drinks were amazing though. We did the bowls virgin and I love that they have the option to try all their fun drinks alcohol free. Sadly they didn't have the signatue candy for our choice and they didn't offer all the drinks I saw on their online menu. I love the bowls though. Sadly they didn't tell us they were ours with purchase. That's 2 bowls we didn't get. (They cost 20 in the store)  2nd visit. Figured we'd give them the benefit of the doubt. This time we ordered a meal. Went with their steak. It was so flavorful and grilled so nicely. Ordered 2 more bowls. Once again we weren't told the bowls were for us. This time we get the bill and there was an 18% gratuity for the server who gave us our water and never came back! We had to chase down a waiter to get our bill and they didn't know about the gratuity and our waiter wasn't there any longer.   3rd visit.  This time took the cake. Got 2 goblets. Both virgin. I told them this. It was just 2 of us again. The waiter disappeared and the bar tender brings over the drink. I take a sip and realize it has alcohol in it. I tell the bar tender we ordered virgin. She told me to keep it and drink it anyway. I was flabbergasted because I was with my minor daughter. I tell her this. She looks ar my kid and shrugs. I'm not gonna say anything she says.   Are you kidding me? I made her get us the virgin because I'm not serving my kid alcohol.  Again, not told the cups are souvenirs. Try to get my bill. Takes forever and while I'm waiting for my card to run the bar tender decides she's done for the night and starts drinking with the customers at the bar that just wanted their change so they could leave. They told the tender this but she was busy pouring free shots for them and her.  So. Last chance. Go with friends. Was looking forward to the streak again since it was so good last time. This time it had no flavor. No char from the grill. Just was bland and chewy and the potatoes were sour. Another virgin goblet that we weren't informed we could keep and they were out of a few flavors. This time though the service was top notch. I told the waitress that every time we ate upstairs we had awful service and that the bartender tried to give my kid alcohol. So maybe that's why we had good service. A manager never came by though.  So that's how many goblets I didn't get to keep? I really wanted one too. The drinks are amazing every time...if they have it on stock and don't rely on the online menu.  The food is not consistent. The service is a nightmare.  I really wanted to like this place. The concept is fun, the decor is amazing, the drinks are unique and flavorful and you can get them virgin.  But I do not know if I'll give them another chance. If I did, I now know I can have my goblet. Would also be nice if they offered a gluten free option since it is a big stop on the strip.",

They didn't finish their food nor did they want to take it with them should have been a clue to me. My daughter had the chicken fettucine. We shared the $18 chocolate shake. I had a burger and fries. I finished my burger - it was good. too many fries but good. I tasted the fettucine and it was very rich, tasted fine. I didn't try any of the chicken. My kid got sick off the chicken and spent the evening and the next day in the hotel room sick and sleeping from nausea and stomach pains. Careful what you eat there. I would say - drink only.",

Not only was she extremely attentive from the moment we had sat down, she was funny, friendly, helpful, and very knowledgeable with answers to any questions we had about their extensive menu (which is a lot to look through! But it was impressive how many different options they have food & drink wise, our party of 7, 4 of which were young children were all able to find exactly what we wanted to eat even though each meal was vastly different from the others). Also following her suggestions on desserts turned out to be the most beautifully hand-crafted \"insane\" milkshakes, (including one with an entire slice of cheesecake on the top, one with cotton candy and Skittles and one with a bacon cheeseburger to top it!) And they taste as delicious as they look!! I had the club sandwich and although it was HUGE in portion sjze, I couldn't stop myself from eating more and more. My husband got the steak and lobster tail which was cooked to perfection and although pricey, completely worth every cent! We ordered the white gummy worm goblet with alcohol and we're pleased to find out we could order any of them without the alcohol also for the kids. They enjoyed the lollipop and ocean blue goblets. The beer selection is a little slim but we were pleased even more when our waitress assured us it was a full bar not limited to the menus cocktails and martinis only, so my sister in law enjoyed a vodka soda. The bruchetta and spinach and artichoke dip were definitely a great meal starter. We enjoyed dinner in the chocolate lounge upstairs and loved the atmosphere. We will definitely be returning next time we are in town!!   Thank you sugar factory staff and thank you Rhea for making our experience much more than just dinner out as a family!",

The staff was very friendly, even though our waitress was incredibly busy she took good care of us and checked in frequently. We ordered the raspberry watermelon mojito. The only complain I have about this drink is that it became carbonated because of the dry ice and I didn't really think that worked with the flavors (but that is just a personal preference). We also ordered the \"chocolate, chocolate, chocolate crepe\" and it was really good too, but you honestly can't go wrong with chocolate really. Yes, the price is a little bit high maybe but it's a fun restaurant to go to and they have a lot of different types of desserts and drinks. I would of come here for a regular dinner, rather would just recommend it for drinks and desserts!",

I would get the white gummy bear or the one with the lollipops and candy necklace ( I forget the name) I recommend coming here for one drink and that is it. The food is overpriced and not worth it. We ordered  the spinach dip appetizer which was a pretty decent sized portion but they give you like 4 pieces of tiny sourdough crisps. We asked for more once we finished and still had plenty of dip left and they come back with another 4. (Maybe it was 6 but still not nearly enough to finish the dip). I saw two birthday parties going on while I was there and the giant Birthday sundae seemed pretty cool. I'm somewhat disappointed in this new location. I miss when it used to be at Paris, it seemed a lot nicer there.",

We had made a reservation and our Hostess didn't acknowledge the fact that my husband had told them it was my birthday and they just put us wherever. We told the waiter it was my birthday and he actually wrote my name down and then that was it. No song, No scoop of ice cream with the candle perhaps, nothing. My salad/meal was the caliber of of a side salad and it was $24. Complete rip-off! This was my birthday dinner?! Never again. And they wanted $10 To come out and sing Happy Birthday and give us some sort of dessert is what my husband told me later. If I had known this I would have gone anywhere else for my birthday celebration. Very bad service and not a good place to celebrate your birthday!",

Myself and my party just ordered right away being on that spot and never saw my server again for awhile. We ordered the rainbow sliders, chicken quesadillas, and the night owl goblet. Our food arrived 15 mins after ordering and our server is no where to be found and by the time we're half way done with our food our drinks arrived.. it was so disappointing to know that our drink came after mid way of eating our food. The restaurant wasn't busy during that time. I would have understood if it was peak business hours but it wasn't. He didn't even clear our empty plates, he didn't ask how our food was, or anything! He came during the end and said \"you ready to pay\" we jsut didn't want to be there anymore and paid and asked to split the check. Our server told me to use my phone to calculate the spilt for the amount. First of all. YOUR the server, that's your job  it's just two cards to spilt down the middle. I wouldn't go back again. They have such a good name but such poor service.",

I had the jalapeno burger and my wife had the mac and cheese burger.  Both were incredibly tasty.  We also got a Nutella crepe for dessert which was excellent.  They didn't skimp of the Nutella.  Overall, I would recommend this place.  I'm taking one star off because the food and drinks were overpriced ($16 for a pina colada??) even for Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Came here with a party of 18 for my friends' birthday. At first they set us at a table that was a bit too small. After a bit, they accommodated to make the table bigger, which was nice of them.  The waiter was very patient in checking a bunch of IDs so we could try the cocktails. Two friends got goblets, which were great! You couldn't really taste the alcohol, and they had great candies inside. I got the Sexual Chocolate. The alcohol taste was a bit overwhelming in that one, so next time I'll be getting it without alcohol (which you can do with all of the drinks).  Now onto the food. Oh boy.. again, the waiter was very patient with us as we ordered. It took a while for the food to come out, but that's to be expected when you come with a large party. We got food ranging from pasta to burgers. No one had any mix ups with their orders, and everyone's food came out mostly with no gaps. I got the Fettuccini Alfredo with a side of onion rings. Although the pasta portion was small, it tasted great! I'm actually glad the portion was smaller because too much pasta isn't always a great thing. The onion rings were great too! Everyone finished their meals without leftovers. The only downside was that it took an hour to get the check. However, the waiter was really nice in splitting all of them without mix ups.  Overall, my experience was a good one and I will be back.",

The hostess rolled her eyes when I asked for a different seat ( something where I can sit next to my love , not a one top where I have to sit across from him ) , our server was annoyed and rushed and observed him being seated very close with larger parties . He forgot drinks as my love struggled to finish dinner .  As we checked out with the server we had to chance to rate him , right in front of him , I passed on the option and he kindly gave himself 5 stars with no explanation of the meaning of the review . Spoke to the manager concerning service and lacked interest with awkward silences even though I expressed my understanding of the server being overwhelmed .  Not sure the atmosphere or the food is worth 100 bucks for 2 when there's poor service .",

    "text": "This place is great if you wanna take an Instagram picture with your drink and that's about it. My friend and I ordered the night owl goblet (non alcoholic since we're 18) and it didn't even have the owl lollipops that the menu promises. But that's no big deal (we didn't care but thought they'd be cool). The drink tasted like diabetes but that was expected considering all the sugar. My mom got the berry goblet. In the picture it had fresh berries and the actual drink was candy. No big deal though. But for a drink that large that costs $35 she should at least get a buzz. She hadn't had a drink for two months prior, so her alcohol tolerance was low. Considering she couldn't even taste the liquor, I wouldn't be surprised if hers was non alcoholic as well. The most surprising part for me was that it was only $5 extra for alcohol in the drinks. They should lower the price on the nonalcoholic drinks if they're just fruit punch in a cool cup. The thing that caused this place to lose stars for me was that we asked four different people for a to go cup. And the food sucks. $100 for two drinks and an appetizer. Spend your money somewhere elsewhere, maybe nobu or maggianos if you want some actual good food.",

Then she assumed we were with the other table and asking \"Are you guys the one using groupon?\". When she was done taking their orders she left, we waited a bit for her to come back just to take our drink order. She brought our drinks and left again. Then came back to take our order. While enjoying our meal my daughter was looking for the rubber duckie that is supposed to come with her burger sliders. When server came around passing by, my daughter asked her if they forgot to give her the rubber duckie. The server immediately said \"we dont have it, if you want you can speak to the manager\". Long story short, After meals & drinks, we were going to order dessert when server approached us to take the order my daughter asked her if there is anything they have because we are celebrating my birthday. The server rudely said \"if you are not ordering any dessert then we don't have anything\". At this point I was already aggravated, and told my daughter we will not be having dessert anymore because of the way we have been treated. She could have nicely said it being that she is speaking to a 10 years old. Then on top of it all, upon paying our bill she was really rude how she shoved the receipt in my purse after I asked for it.   ---I can understand the attitude or rudeness if they were slam busy but they were not even busy.  --- She did not have to shove the receipt in my purse there is a proper way of handing the receipt to a paying customer.",

They were very tasty my husband loved his burger and my daughter thought the fruit was delicious. We also got goblets those we're pretty pricey but we're in Vegas right every thing pretty expensive my kids liked the dry ice and my little one got a virgin bubble gum Martin and I got the adult sour apple one both were delicious.our server Travis was pretty good too. We had a great experience so good that we had to come back today for breakfast today. So we just got done eating we got food was good I think I prefer lunch and dinner better I got the fruit crepes which were okay my husband got the eggs benedict which he thought were okay (said he should have got his burger) my girls got the waffles now those were pretty dang good. The girls also got a shark goblet to share which was pretty tasty and if you check in on yelp you get it for half off Which was totally worth it. And once again our server Travis pretty good.

I saw a few other angry faces looking around for their servers as well and thought to myself , if it's taking this long to get greeted and others aren't looking too happy, what more getting a milkshake!?!  On our way out is when someone finally took notice and asked if something was wrong.... I gave them the same treatment and said NOTHING.  Seriously, service needs a tune up!",

We were there for a friend's birthday party and I would have expected better service. The manager didn't even offer up an apology to us so I will probably never go back. She just said that the restaurant had been open for a month and thanked us for our patience while they sort through the mess. My friend was very specific in saying that she wanted no cheese on her chocolate burger and within a minute to 90 seconds, the waitress brought out one and asked her if she wanted it with cheese on it. She was beyond livid and so was her boyfriend.",

The restaurant ran out of clean eating utensils and napkins.  The waitress told us to \"just eat with our hands.\"  The fish bowl drinks were a huge disappointment.  We had intended to have dessert but after the terrible dinner experience we just wanted to get out of there...the manager was worthless when I wanted to talk about my not paying the full added on gratuity for my party of 11.  Terrible service, no water refills, no silverware or napkins does not equal the full gratuity!  Paid the check just to get out of there.  What a sharp decline from the former place...terribly managed.",

For a party of 6 that's great. The fancy drinks are a little over priced for what you get but nothing beats their presentation. I got the salmon croissant- super good. and the watermelon mojito was a perfect combo of sweet and minty. Loved our visit",

Me & my boyfriend order 2 drinks & a basket of fries & we paid $40 plus a $10 gratuity (there was 5 people in our party). $50 for 2 drinks & a basket of fries?! Not to mention our waitress Chrissy was making inappropriate comments about how she doesn't like when they play Spanish music bc this isn't a Mexican restaurant... she then went on about they don't even sell Mexican food & it doesn't make sense to her that they would play Spanish music. My boyfriend & best friend are both Mexican & sitting right there so it was very uncomfortable for everyone. She was so unprofessional & didn't even seem to realize that what she was saying might make us uncomfortable considering my boyfriends name is Jose & he looks obviously Mexican.. really ruined the experience for me because I did like the ambiance. Then on top of everything she said Jose's card was not reading & she wouldn't be able to accept it. Even though it worked fine everywhere else. Super disappointed.",

I'm here early on Thursday (only a few other tables worth people) and waited 15 min for a waiter to even acknowledge us. We immediately ordered including drinks. 20+ min later food arrives- still no drinks. Shouldn't you get your cocktail before your foodI ask the food runner to check on drinks which arrive another 10 min. later with he excuse that the bar is backed up. Really? No one is here... I'd hate to see the bar on a busy night. Also I could see the bar where I was sitting and my drink had been just sitting there for who knows how long- the cotton candy topper had melted and I watched he waiter put on a new one with his hands which he didn't wash. Food was nothing special. Do yourself a favor and skip this place for one of the many many other options on the strip.  Update- much like their cocktail service  the direct message from the management's comment below never came....",

After waiting for our food to come out correctly, they serve me raw/undercooked chicken. I understand your establishment has only been opened for a month..that may be a sorry excuse for the service but I don't think chefs are hired to serve undercooked food.

The waitresses upstairs made it a point to not make eye contact with us so that they wouldn't have to help. Initially, there was some type of confusion between the waitresses and the hostess regarding our seating, but that shouldn't have affected the service we received. We were told by the hostess that they wanted to give our table to someone else.  The male hostess guy out front with the curly hair was super cool and helpful, but I'll never visit again. Two thumbs down. There was also a guy on the elevator with some sort of microphone in his ear but I'm not sure of his position. He over heard our complaints about not being helped and said absolutely nothing. It was our first time there and we only went in after being asked to by the hostess outside. We were actually trying to go to the Benihana's next door. I've now read several reviews on the horrible customer service (mainly the wait staff). Guess I should've read up before we agreed to going in. DON'T WASTE YOUR  $$ HERE!",

Jennevive, one of the managers reached out to me regarding my last visit and requested that I give them another chance and come back in so I could get the service I should have gotten in the first place. I definitely appreciated her reaching out and wanting to fix the issues at hand. I decided to accept her invitation and went ahead and made a reservation for myself and my boyfriend who has Never been to a sugar factory before. I went in with an open mind hoping that this wouldn't be a repeat of the first time and it definitely wasn't. It was a complete 360. The service was amazing, the food was great, everyone was very attentive and had whatever we asked for in a timely matter. Menz, our server was AMAZING. He made sure we were updated on when our food and drinks would be coming out, made sure to check in with us even though they were pretty busy, answered all our questions without hesitation and even had a few laughs with us. The manager on duty Gerrard (Might have misspelled) was great as well. My boyfriend actually called him over to say how great everything had been and how much we really appreciated everything and he actually went over some things with us that would be happening weekly like ladies night, and I believe he said they would be having a DJ there on Friday nights soon. Overall everything was AMAZING this time around and definitely changed my perspective on this location. We'll be back soon! Thank you Everyone!",

It was apparent they were closing. Nice waiter was the only saving grace. Milkshakes come out at the time we are told they are out of the ice cream flavor that was to come on our sundae. So as you can see the sundae hadn't been started. He offers us different flavors. We are fine with that. We ask what are the options. No list of flavors. We had to get up to go see and when we did most didn't even have a label so no idea what the were. We settled on 2 flavors but very unimpressed with 2 of them.  Our sundae comes out and immediately I think something is missing. No crushed Oreos and no caramel. This is a signature sundae not something we created. We ordered coffee figuring we'd warm up with it while we waited and it didn't come until the ice cream. It was awful.  5.00 a cup we expected better flavor and the option of more than one cup. They took off for the sundae. We asked to remove the coffee and he was not happy about it. Manager says \"you drank the cup right?\"  The one late arriving bad coffee. Used a Groupon thank goodness but was still very expensive. Totally not worth it. We went for a fun experience and this was definitely a fail. Took a picture of my kids milkshakes and was not excited about the dirty mop pail in the background of the picture. . Save your money.",

We had only had one of their bowl drinks from a previous trip at the miracle mile location so we were excited to dine in. From the moment we walked up the host was warm and inviting and brought us to our table immediately. We sat outside as the weather was enjoyable however the sun was beaming down on our table. Moments after being seated our waiter Travis walked up also with a great genuine attitude. He immediately moved an umbrella around to get us some shade and assured us the sun would only be in that spot for no more than 10 minutes. He was absolutely right, he moved the umbrella once the sun was gone and proceeded to take our order. Our table ordered 3 of the large bowl drinks and two specialty cocktails all of which were fantastic! The drinks are so delicious you can't even taste the alcohol but trust me its there! Our food was brought out fairly quickly, Travis made sure to check up on our table constantly while having conversation with us and making the overall experience very enjoyable. I would most definitely say he is one of the best waiters we have met and will most definitely be going back on our next trip to Vegas!",

The menu was huge and we didn't know what to get but he was very patient with us. I ended up getting red velvet pancakes that came with whatever flavor ice cream I wanted and a side of bacon and eggs. It was very delicious. My family got a goblet that was huge and very good. We kept the candy and the lollipops that came with it. After we ordered we waited about 15 minutes for all of our food to come out which was very fast for all the food we ordered. When we were done eating we met the manager of this location and she was so sweet it would be great to work for her. The restaurant was very clean and the bathrooms were very fun! There is a chocolate bar upstairs that is 21 and over and sooo cute and smells sooo good! Next time we go to the Sugar Factory we will be sure to ask for chase.

I sat at the bar and the server wasn't very attentive at all. She seemed very preoccupied and flustered but there was literally only a handful of people in the restaurant.   As for the food, I ordered the burger that had Mac and cheese on it. I substituted the beef patty for turkey. Overall, the burger was bland and the macaroni was average at best. The fries were delicious though!  I also ordered two shots and a goblet (what was I thinking?!) The goblet was very fruity and I only drank half and it got the job done. My bill came to $70 I believe but I had a groupon deal which knocked it down to $40. Pretty expensive but typical for Vegas.  I would definitely return, try something else on the menu, and probably sit at a table instead of the bar.",

As a local, I have been to sugar factory several times when it was at the sugar factory. for about 2 years, it was actual a frequent date night for me and my boyfriend so when they closed i definitely missed it. When I heard they were reopening another location at fashion show, I had to come and see it.  So I came tonight for my birthday. Let me say, the service was absolutely horrendous. Let me start this by saying it was a Wednesday and there were literally about 5 tables sat in the whole restaurant. It took approximately 10 minutes to get my drink order in and then an additional 20 minutes to even order my food. Throughout this time span, I watched my waiter stand and talk to his coworkers and continue to do his roll ups (as I'm assuming his shift was ending soon) instead of taking our food order.  I come to sugar factory mainly for their amazing desserts and I didn't even order one because I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes on my birthday for a dessert.  I will NEVER come to this restaurant again. And as a local who frequented here weekly when it was at the Paris, that's saying a lot. I even used my last bit of cash to pay the bill so I didn't have to wait for my card to get ran.  If you are a local or even a tourist looking for a place to eat, unless you have an hour and a half to spare on just waiting for your food and drink, I would go elsewhere.",

    "text": "My husband and I brought of kids to to Vegas to kick of summer vacay! Our kids are teens so they had certain spots they wanted to explore and try! My 13 yr old, Kylie and Drake obsessed wanted to try Sugar LOL so I found a great Groupon, pay $40 for $80 value. We were greeted at the front and choose to sit outside. Here's what we ordered  2 classic burgers- standard  Classic steak- boring, no flavor Nutella pancakes Garlic butter pasta- boring, very little flavor Garden salad Rainbow sliders Mac and cheese balls The dye milk shake Rocky road milkshake Watermelon goblet  Bill with Groupon and checkin on yelp, $180  The food was ok nothing wow..... The goblet, it was ok had a powder taste to it. I barely drank half and you don't even get to keep the goblet! For that much give me the dam cup!  So 2 star for food, if we come again I'd do the mac and cheese balls and desserts only.  Now, the service! Ugh! The waiter didn't really engage with us and tell us about the menu, the menu is huge so it would be great to get some help here! Then after we were done eating, we sat and waited for 30 mins, I just wanted the bill and saw the waiter taking everyone's order but never came over to see if we were okay or to check us out. Finally I went in and requested the bill. Which they finally brought out. I showed him my check in and Groupon. He rolled his eyes and said this is a process and takes a while I have to go upstairs and do it. WTF???? Don't have a check in and Groupon if you all can't figure it out! Another 15 min wait, comes back and gives me my bill to sign. Never once explains there's already gratuity added, but hands me the bill with the option for tip open. So I added the tip because again I had no idea it was there already! Ugh! So he got there mandatory tip they charge and an extra tip! Ugh!!! Then I had to even ask for a paper receipt as he wasn't going to even give me one. Service sucks! Mind you the restaurant was not even packed, not busy at all! Someone needs to train this waiter!",

My fiance and I were walking by and thought the place was so cute so we decided to walk in and check it out, it was very empty, only us and another group. We were given a menu, and the waitress went over a few drinks with us. there was so many options but we didn't want any drinks we wanted a dessert, So we asked for strawberries with chocolate. Well I don't know for what reason but they wouldn't sell them to us. She left and came back saying they didn't have that, and didn't even offer us anything else!! and took the menu away!! Basically Asking us to leave for not buying a drink!! Funny part was that when we walked past the bar to walk out, we saw they clearly had strawberries right there. I don't understand for what reason she didn't want to dip a few in chocolate, the plater only includes 6 strawberries, it's not like I'm asking you to give me all the strawberries for the rest of the day. And I'm pretty sure you guys have chocolate. It's like you either by a drink or get out at this place, Or either they were too lazy to make some. This is the First and last time we come to this place.  NO, I do recommend this place to absolutely anyone, don't let the cute looks from outside fool you, the employees are rude and lazy!",

Got to see Chri$tina (that was on her name tag LOL) decorate the ice cream. It look straight out of Wreck It Ralph!!! She was sweet for letting us watch and interact. Roberto gave my wife a sample of strawberry cheesecake ice cream so we couldn't resist getting a scoop. The only odd thing about the store is that there are no pricing around, Yolanda was able to help us out very effectively. It was still a little inconvenient, but we were able to get through it. Otherwise, the service was what hit home for us. Would definitely come again and recommend just seeing how cute it is inside. Next time, we'll be coming back for some food and actual desserts!!",

The hostess knew we hadn't been served outside thus should have alerted waitstaff but again we were ignored. Waitstaff walked by no acknowledgement. Out the door we went. Hostess unfazed. Never again. Place was not full by any means either.  Update! 2/2/19 My husband and I had a wonderful meal today. Justin was a great server very courteous and attentive. Probably one of the best bennies I've had. SF may very well be our go to instead of Hexx for brunch or brekky",

They fill your goblet with peach candies, dry ice, and cotton candy and pour \"60oz\" of liquor over it for the show. I highly doubt it's really 60oz. It may be 24oz that fills up a 60oz goblet because all the candy and Ice in the goblet. The drink was very good but my wife and I finished it without a buzz at all. In my opinion not worth the $45 bucks but it's a cool show and it taste good.",

Part of their new menu item they added was the rainbow sliders... delicious! We went with a group of 6 recently to celebrate 2 birthdays and had an amazing time. There's a dj that plays live music and the environment is so fun! Our server Manny was so generous and kind, he had a great energy and enthusiasm. The menu has soooo many choices. Must try items... white chocolate burger, the Mac and cheese burger, chicken Alfredo pasta, ALL the goblets!! The drake is one of my favorites. The desserts are something else. The presentation of the food is so cute and well thought out. I can't wait to visit again!",

    "text": "I've been putting off this review because I just don't want to have to rehash this visit. My daughter turned 21 and we came here for dinner to kick off a fun night on the Strip. Two problems quickly arose. One: The waiter was clearly uninterested in actually serving us. I felt the entire time like he was put out by having to take our order. God forbid he bring the drinks we ordered or the condiments requested (I don't think asking for mustard for a burger is absurd but I gave up after asking twice and still not getting it). Fortunately they brought my sisters wine after she asked a second time... maybe because they can charge her for the drink? The second problem: The food was the same quality as Denny's. Now I love me some Denny's, but at Denny's prices. This was a late dinner and everyone in our party was hungry, but I don't think anyone actually finished their meal.   Now, if you were going just for drinks and dessert, you'd have a good (but pricey) experience maybe. I had a drink that tasted like a root beer float and it was absolutely delicious. I don't remember what it was called but everyone in our party did love their drinks.   The drinks are the only good thing about this place. As I mentioned, it was my daughter's birthday. We told the hostess that when booking the table. Never said anything to the despondent waiter (honestly, his attitude was that of someone who just lost a loved one but still showed up to work. If he weren't such a jerk later, I would have started to think there was something seriously wrong with him).   Anyway, after we un-finished our meals, a small bowl of ice cream with a truly spectacular sparkler flaming out the top was brought to my daughter. I thought, ok, this is making up for the crappy meal! My daughter had a smile on her face and that's all any parent wants.   And then the bill came. $400 for 8 of us was expected. $10 for the small bowl of ice cream was not. We didn't order it. And if we were going to order a dessert, we would have chosen something we actually wanted. I don't want to be the asshole haggling over a few bucks when the bill was so high, but that was my breaking point. We were all kind of shocked that we were charged a birthday bowl of ice cream when we never asked for it, and my sister approached the waiter about it. He claims that it is the standard charge for birthdays and \"someone\" told him to add it. We asked, \"Was it anyone in our group?\" And he couldn't remember. A manager came out and also insisted it was the standard charge and someone asked for it but again couldn't identify who that was.   It was a truly frustrating conversation. So I told my sister, \"Forget it, I have a Yelp account.\"  And that's when the waiter lost it. He said he \"doesn't appreciate threats\" and \"doesn't want to argue over $10 on a $400 ticket.\" I agree, it's a stupid argument but don't charge me for something we didn't order.   They eventually removed the $10 charge.   Perhaps if the service were remotely decent or the food actually tasty, I could have overlooked it. We went to a fairly extravagant (to me) dinner and I was looking forward to getting Instagram-worthy pics. Literally half our group have been servers at one time. We are all very generous tippers and are forgiving of busy, overworked servers. But this guy was an ass. And the food sucked. And they charged $10 for a small bowl of ice cream that we didn't ask for. And it definitely didn't kick off a 21st birthday like we had hoped.",

The desserts looked amazing!  We did  not have dessert though so I can't tell you if they are as good as they look.  The cons.  Service sucked.  My date had the burger with Mac and cheese on it, I don't think Mac and cheese belongs on a burger, but he thought it would be good.  So he ordered it and said it was \"ok\" not worth the price for sure.  I had the steak sandwich, comes with onion broth and fries.  The sandwich was very small and not worth the $24 price tag!  The broth didn't come out with my sandwich and the server finally stopped by so I could ask for it and when I got it, it was flavorless.    I was excited to try this place sadly I wish we went somewhere else!  We won't be back.  I suggest if you're going to go, go for drinks and dessert and have dinner somewhere else.",

Food was good too but the mini burger sliders was a good looking meal!  Justin, our server is very helpful with our order, attentive, has good chemistry with my kids, carefully listening to their questions and returning with an dramatic diaplay of liquid nitrogen in the drink goblets. My kids loved every minute of it and wanted to come back for more! Justin, thank you for the kind and upbeat personality of yours!",

    "text": "We went to the Fashion Show Mall and hadn't decided where we were going to have lunch. While walking outside we stopped by Sugar Factory. They were offering a deal with a percentage off if you ate outside on the patio. It was too humid so we went inside.  The inside had lots of flair, from its candy shoppe at the front, to its bright wall and booth padding, mirrors and chandeliers galore. They had a bar where you could sit and they prepped all the goblet drinks. It was neat viewing it from our table next to it. It was a little loud inside which bothered my son a bit.  It did take a rather long time but at least they had a kids coloring sheet and crayons to offer. My husband decided on a chicken sandwich, I decided on the strawberry brioche French toast, my son ordered the Mac n cheese appetizer, and we got the Giggles Snickers Milkshake. The food was very tasty though and had generous portions. My husband enjoyed the bun and said the chicken was moist and flavorful. He enjoyed the salty and crispy fries. My French toast was sweet, savory, and rich indulgence! It was covered in all sorts of berries. My son wasn't a huge fan of the Mac n cheese but I thought it was tasty. It came with a tomato soup type sauce to dip it in. All of us were pleased with the giant milkshake. They showed us how to scoop up the Snickers and sprinkles in the chocolate ganache along the side. It came with a full Snickers bar on top too!  We left the restaurant with some leftovers. While it was a little more on the pricey side than we normally spent, it still was fairly reasonable for the portions and taste. It was a fun experience. I would love to try one of the ginormous goblets next time!",

    "text": "This place is definitely hyped. I've had this spot bookmarked for some time and was delighted to finally check out this Vegas trip.   We came on a Sunday night and it was EMPTY! There were about three people at the bar, two tables, and us. We honestly just came to try their goblet drinks.   They have a large drink menu with no prices written on them.   We ordered one lollipop passion goblet and it was good but really really simple. And then we get the bill and it's $42. We are from LA. Our \"goblets\" aka fish bowls cost $18-$25 and not just filled up with mixers. Granted I guess they charge that much because their candy and lollipops are so expensive. *sarcasm*   Service was okay. Server didn't seem like she was too thrilled to be there. Apparently a bunch of celebrities come here and it's probably because they don't think twice about having to order 3 of their $40 goblets to get a nice buzz going.    Didn't try their desserts or food since their hype was on the drinks. The drinks were simple, expensive, and left much to be desired. But they certainly put on a nice show with the dry ice. Good for pictures.",

I could go somewhere else and have a comparable meal for substantially less. It was a great experience but I won't go back. The ambiance is fun, and our waitress was great! I just can't get over the price  Round two. My best friend and I came back. I ordered the Mac burger she ordered the veggie burger. Her veggie was good. Her fries were gross. My burger I ordered medium well. It comes out like straight charcoal. My fries were decent. They have our waiter swamped. Completely unenjoyable. I won't be back. They tried to accommodate me with a coupon. It was not worth it at all. I could go to in n out and get two amazing burgers for half the price of what I'd spend here.",

This one is nicely located by fashion mall so there's parking available  We came in with a party of 20! And they were able to make reservations and accommodate our group. Overall we enjoyed all of the things we ordered. Some tips especially with a big group is to order a variety since portions are huge and meant to share I suggest their eggs Benedict and chicken and waffles!",

Jade! You did an excellent job attending to our reservation of 20 girls. He was timely and if we needed something he didn't make a face when we asked. He was quick and efficient.   Ambiance: I love the decor here and the theme of the restaurant. I wish the lights on the chandelier could have been a little bright it looked really dark for a restaurant. Besides that it was a packed Saturday night and we had a great time.   Food: Of course it's Vegas and anything on the strip is pricey. We expected it but I wish the food was more flavorful than it was. I checked in and received a free bruschetta appetizer which was delicious. Also had onion rings and the breading was perfect and the sauce that came along with it as well. The chicken alfredo was okay. We paid extra for chicken and I think there was 5 pieces in the dish. The food came out at a reasonable time. The surprise birthday sparklers are $5 and $5 for ice cream which I think is overpriced but again I wanted the experience for the birthday girl and got a cute pic!   Drink: I had to get the goblet as we were celebrating a 21st birthday so it was a must! We chose Energy Bear and it was perfect because I did not want to get anything too sweet. They are $39 and have a variety of choices. Make sure to ask about taste if you're unsure. They also tell you the most popular goblets.",

He was very attentive to our needs, offered recommendations, and accommodated a table of 5 very opinionated women. I ordered the tomato bisque soup, which was good, nothing spectacular. It came with 3 mini pieces of cheese toast, which was really good! For my entree I ordered the ribeye steak, asparagus, and mashed potato dinner. Here's the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5. I expressed to Richard that I wanted the steak medium and NOT pink. Richard assured me that he understood exactly what I wanted. Well suffice it to say, the steak was pink but had an awesome flavor. I asked Richard to have the kitchen cook it just a bit longer and so after waiting for about 15 minutes, the steak arrive red instead of pink. Even Richard had a look of bewilderment on his face. And so with that look and my steak in hand he took the to his manager. The manager apologized and offered to comp my steak dinner, suggested that I ordered something else at no charge and have a cocktail. They reaaaaaaaaaally know how to rectify a problem. I declined on ordering another entree but enjoyed a nice glass of wine. Overall, I plan to return with my husband and children to enjoy this experience.",

Wanting to stay close to the strip, we decided on trying out Sugar Factory since neither of us had been since they opened up at this location, but we had been when they were still in the Paris.  We had a reservation for 6pm, but arrived about 15 minutes early. We were greeted right away, and sat promptly. The host was very nice. The decor of the restaurant is so cute and French bistro-like. I love the black, white, and red color scheme.  The menu is pretty large with tons of drink and food options. It took us a little while to decide on what we wanted, and our server was very patient. We ended up getting the mac and cheese pops, 2 Caesar salads, and we split 3 goblet drinks (2 of the lollipop ones and a Gummi one). The goblets were so yummy and cute, just like we remembered. We were here for a little over 3 hours, and the staff was cool about it. My friend said that we would finish our drink and head out soon, but the manager who was by us said no, stay and enjoy as long as you want. That was really nice! The only thing I would improve was the size of the salad. It was kind of small and I am glad we each got our own instead of sharing.  I will definitely come back to this cute place!",

To be quite honest, the food was a little bit of a let down. In my opinion this place is overly hyped, which lead me to have high expectations for their food.  They do have really interesting desserts and drinks, but their food tastes mediocre. I wouldn't claim it to be the best I have ever tasted, but it wasn't horrible.  I'd definitely recommend the Sugar Factory if you're looking for a fun night out, and are wanting to try something new! Take lots of pictures because the food (especially their milkshakes) are picture worthy, but don't overestimate the quality of their food.",

On top of that I had to wait over 45 minutes to get my food and the restaurant wasn't even busy at all, I feel like they just forgot to put our orders in and we were just sitting there waiting for a long time. I don't recommend this place if you are there to get a meal. Their desserts look amazing though, I would go there only to split a milkshake probably. I didn't order dessert because after waiting for 45 minutes for food I was afraid to order anything else. I also think it's pathetic how much they advertise the celebrity visitors, most famous restaurants have celebrity guests, there is no need to have 8 pages on their menu showing pictures of them, it's stupid. Anyway, go here for dessert, don't waste your money on their entrees.",

They actually \"ran out\" of chicken strips (what the heck) so our youngest was really disappointed with her dinner. Hunny & I split dinner and my eldest split dinner. We let the kids get dessert as well, as the place is known for its dessert. It was ok - definitely not worth the cost. An experience for sure, but we won't be back.",

I ordered a Turkey burger and fries the burger I didn't really care for, the fries were pretty good. I also ordered a side salad, it barely had any lettuce and had way too many cucumbers in it. The mimosa was decent. I bought a small scoop of ice cream on the way out it was $3.50 kinda expensive since the cup was tiny. This is the type of restaurant you need to visit only once.

Sugar Factory is a cute and lively spot with over-the-top drinks and shakes. Sure, you'll be paying strip prices and the food is standard quality for a chain restaurant, but the crazy shakes and desserts are actually pretty good value. The crazy shake I ordered had a slice of cheesecake, a huge rainbow lollipop, a sugar daddy, and the mug was huge! The shake itself was actually quite delicious, it tasted like homemade ice cream, which was surprising. I think that's worth the $19.   But really, the service was impeccable. The staff was so kind and thoughtful. I will definitely be returning for dessert because of the wonderful time we had.  *update: after trying shakes at a different, new establishment on the strip that's known for their crazy shakes, Sugar Factory is my first choice. SF shakes are a couple dollars more but worlds better when it comes to taste. Can't wait to go back!",

Our server was friendly and gave us plenty of food and drink recommendations from the menu. He was pretty attentive through the night, which was really nice. We were seated at a booth and there was a bright light that was making everyone really hot. There wasn't enough air coming to our corner so most of us were sweating through our dinner.   On to dinner - I know this is on the strip and the prices are expected to be pretty inflated but man, oh man, they really get you here. I ordered the Chinese chicken salad which was priced at $17. The picture on the menu showed a plate stacked high with chicken and wontons. What I got was a soup bowl filled with cabbage. It looked like one of those pre-chopped bags of salad you can get from Walmart. No wontons or roasted peanuts, like the menu said it had and only a couple chunks of diced chicken, not slices like the picture. Flavorwise, it was ok. I also ordered a virgin Caramel macchiato \"martini\", which was $15. The drink was tasty but it was topped with a thick whipped cream which made it hard to drink the actual drink. I actually spilled on myself while drinking it because the whipped cream was too thick on the side I sipped from and it leaked off the side. I ended up using my water straw to cut through the whipped cream to get to the drink itself and had more than half a glass full of whipped cream leftover.   The atmosphere was fun, the music was blaring and some folks even danced around their tables. It seemed a bit hectic at times, with staff dropping glasses and dishes through the night. Would possibly go again but not really in a hurry to.",

However, the pasta was small, literally looked like an appetizer for $30. I was left hungry. There's a candy and ice cream shop in the front which is also hella overpriced. The scoops are $6 a damn piece... Please.  Our waitress was very attentive and helpful and the manager also was present in the dining area meeting with guest.  This place has a weird obsession with the Kardashian family, there's TVs inside that show the celebrities that have been Sugar Factories and literally almost every picture was a Kardashian or their baby daddies. I'm sure this place was more edxpensive than other locations because it's located on the strip so I will go to a different location when I'm ready to return.  Plenty of free parking located behind the Fashion Show. Check Groupon before you go!",

    "text": "Came here for breakfast/brunch this past weekend with 3 of my friends.   The menu is extensive and the food was pretty tasty. I had the eggs, bacon, hashbrowns (yummmm!), and toast. Ate almost every bite. We had limitless mimosas. They were very juicy as in not much champagne but they were fine.   The service was terrible except one bright spot which I'll speak about in a minute. Took us asking 4 people for ketchup including my friend getting up and asking two servers who were just socializing if they could find ketchup for her. They were annoyed, said yes but did not. It shouldn't take us asking 4 (!!!!) times to receive. We weren't checked on at times for 20-25 mins. When we received the bill and wanted it split, it took 20 mins for us to see someone again and then to find out my friend was charged double what the receipt she was given. Just lazy and they don't seem to care about their customers. Two stars notched off for that.   The bright spot was Sadie, one of the hostesses. We were seated right next to her station and SHE was the one who would notice when we didn't get something we asked for and would retrieve it. Multiple times!!!! She was awesome and so sweet. She's what saved this from being a 2 star review. Get it together, Sugar Factory! Promote Sadie!",

The servers were real nice we even showed up around shift change.  The food tasted great and they have interesting selections.  I always like trying new things.  We got one of the goblets (i was hesitant due to not being a drinker and the price) and that was a neat experience.  Be ready to leave stuffed.  When we come back to town we will definitely make this a return visit.",

There's also plenty of places to stop and take pictures around the restaurant, which is cool.   We came during lunch. There were quite a few people, but we were able to sit upstairs without waiting. There's a great view of the Strip from up there, whether you opt to sit inside or out.   We ordered the Lollipop Passion goblet, the Grape Crush cocktail, and a mixed drink. These drinks, as sugary as they are, were reasonably strong. We noticed the shakes after ordering, unfortunately, or we would've probably snatched one of those up, too.  Yes, drinks and food are pricey, but that's honestly to be expected with the decor and theme of Sugar Factory. A goblet runs ~$30-$40. They know how to make that dry ice last! We had our drink for almost an hour, and it smoked the whole time. Food portions are on the smaller end. We didn't try the food, but we might just have to next time!",

    "text": "I saw videos of this place and was super excited to try their drinks and see the candy shop. We got two goblet drinks: Lollipop Passion & Fuzzy Peach Penguin Mango. Thankfully, they offer the drinks without alcohol because our waiter said it was about 6 shots in each drink.   The Lollipop Passion was green and was topped with two lollipop sticks and sugar candies. It tasted mostly like coconut, but it also has small hints of melon and pineapple. It wasn't great. The Fuzzy Peach Penguin Melon tasted straight up like orange soda, even though it was supposed to be peachy and mangoy. They had some gummy penguins in the ice and orange slices on the edge of the goblet. It was great and exciting seeing the dry ice working with the drink, but towards the bottom my drink froze and I couldn't drink the last inch of it. As fun and childish the drink was, it was insanely expensive. $34 for each goblet!! We didn't even get alcohol in ours, so I thought maybe it wouldn't be so expensive. I guess you really just pay for the dry ice and show.  This is a fun place to try once. Get ready for a big bill at the end!",

The food on the other hand was not good and it was expensive. I couldn't find anything I was interested in on the menu and landed on the sampler platter. The macaroni and cheese balls were gross and cold and you could taste the freezer burn in the onion rings. The chicken strips and buffalo wings were pretty good.

    "text": "Glad to say I came but I most likely won't be returning.   The Sugar Factory isn't your average candy shop. They are commonly known for being widely endorsed by celebrities and the ginormous 60oz signature Goblets. With it being so widely popular, there are multiple Sugar Factory locations worldwide ranging from Las Vegas, NYC, Chicago, Orlando, Dubai, and even Manila.   After numerous trips to Las Vegas and my IG constantly being riddled by drool worthy images of SF, I was pretty bummed at the fact that I have never gotten the chance to experience it first hand. This most recent visit changed all of that......  Our party arrived and was told there would be a wait for a table but if we didn't mind sitting at the bar, we could be seated right away. No harm no foul since our only reason for stopping by was for the infamous goblets.  Be advised that the once glass goblets are now plastic and being the picky person that i am, scratched up plastic fishbowls were not appealing whatsoever.   Instead we opted for 3 martinis: LEMON HEAD- described as \"lemon with a hint of sweetness\" WATERMELON BURST- \"crisp taste of watermelon\" SOUR APPLE LOLLY- \"liquefied sour apple lollipop\"  Overall experience- the cost is waaay too expensive for something that simply tasted soooo sooooooo bad and the portions are definitely skimpy. One added star for the nice gentleman who helped us out and insisted on my little sister looking like his cousin. LMAO.",

But nope- it was basically like drinking a gallon of Kool-Aid.

    "text": "Giving three stars really disappoints me after this much anticipated visit. When we were in Vegas last year, the Sugar Factory restaurants were closed. We were able to get one of the goblet drinks at their location in the Miracle Mile. When planning our trip for this year, I was delighted to discover the restaurant had opened in the Fashion Mall. We arrived at 9:45pm on a Tuesday night. There weren't many other patrons, but there was a table of about fifteen teenagers celebrating a birthday. They were really loud and rambunctious, but we didn't mind. Their energy was contagious and went well with the music blasting from the speakers. Yes, blasting! Don't expect to have a nice, dinner conversation when you're here. Our waitress promptly brought over menus. Excuse me. I should have said' \"extensive menu\", but I'm not complaining. Pages and pages of mouthwatering drinks and delectable desserts. I finally decided on the fried seafood platter and the sour apple lolly martini. The drink was great. The entree not so much. Basic seafood from a frozen box most likely. At least that's what it tasted like. They were out of the dessert we wanted to try so the waitress had them make us a customized sundae. Now that sundae was an absolute yummy treat. The best part of the visit. Our waitress was very attentive also. Almost to the point that I wanted to ask her to stop coming to the table so often. Seriously, whenever we were about to start talking, she would show up. Overall, not the great experience I wanted from this much anticipated visit.",

This place has changed a whole lot and I am for sure they will go out of business. Everything there from the food to the candy side are soooo expensive, so you would think the food and candy would be amazing? Absolutely NOT! Even the people working for the restaurant have the worse customer service ever! The prices are over the top and there burgers are Blah to there cold fries. I couldn't believe on Fathers Day we have a table of 9 and ask can we sit where there was a table with no one sitting there the lady said no it's for another guest. Literally while sitting with 7 little tables that moved everywhere for roughly 2 and half hours no one came for the reservations SMH . So I'm thinking are they racist and think ? Finally we are done eating and paying for a check that was astronomical, then to find out a-white family was seated where we originally said can we move to that side of the table. Lol! I would never in my life go to a place that sells a GOBLET for 40.00 and it's the worse drink with absolutely no alcohol. Anyone reading this I promise you do not waste your time. Go to Cheesecake or Maggiano's by far.",

They brought a table from the outside to pretty much shut us up. Our server at first seem to be empathetic that we had to wait so long then later on we got completely ignored we order our second drink which we never received. He then wanted to bring it to the table after we had another server get his attention to bring us the check. He blamed the wait for the drink cause it got busy for him which the whole time we watched him pass our table several times and serving drinks to his other tables but ours. No matter how busy a place gets there is no excuse for horrible rude service.... oh not to mention when we got our goblet we wanted a video and he had the nerve to say do you see how busy it is in here WTF! You as a server should do as much as you can cause you are working for to make me feel welcome and want to come back thanks sugar factory for making a local not ever want to step foot in your establishment again. Train your workers better.   After much hesitation I went back to the Sugar Factory today July 20th. When I first arrive I mention I had a reservation at 11 and they knew who I was and I was promptly seated even though a few members of my party were running late. We had a warm welcome from our server Travis. We had waters right away and my sister and I ordered goblets which arrived in no time. When the rest of my party arrive he greeted them with that same welcome. They also ordered drinks and food which there was no long delay. The service was great and it was all thanks to Travis and all the staff that approached our table it really changed my mind entirely about this place. I will be back!",

After receiving our menus we were given enough time to watch an episode of Joel Osteen before our server came back to ask for our orders.   We didn't receive any silverware or napkins once our Mac and cheese balls appetizer arrived, so we used our hands and licked our fingers to stay sanitary and ensure we could use our hands for hunting better food at a later time.    We ordered the charcuterie platter and when the food runner brought it out he spilt all the pickles on my leg, and the container fell to the floor. My boyfriend and I were like, \"it's cool...things happen.\" As he went to go scavenge for more pickles I noticed we did not receive bread with our meat platter. When we asked for the bread, the food runner looked confused and out of place. .... (how can you eat pate by itself or meats and mustard w/o any bread.  It's like ordering a pizza with no dough.). We were polite upon asking for our bread as it clearly states it is included on the menu.  I usually wouldn't write a 1 star review of this caliber as I see them being a decent warning, yet a waste of time. However, I wouldn't want anybody wasting their time at this establishment.",

When making small talk, he asked where we were from and when we said Vegas, he proceeded to tell us we gave off the tourist vibe. He was very awkward with his small talk.

Personally I've been dying to try this place ever since I've seen their lollipops plastered across social media by everyone and the ridiculously amazing milkshakes/drinks. So I took myself on a lunch date since I'm in town visiting.   Sat, got glared at an waited....  I ordered a goblet (I'm horrible with the names of the things that I order, but I promise to work on that y'all) it was super pretty and tasted ok. For 60oz, I'm on the fence about paying $40+ for a drink that had to be followed by a few more elsewhere to get me smiley. Then again, maybe I can blame that on my tolerance. I wanted another but didn't exactly feel comfortable nor too persuaded to order anymore. I also got a Cesar salad and added shrimp ($20) fairly small salad with 5 shrimp on top. Yummy but again, the pricing wasn't worth it to me. Especially after MORE WAITING. Wasn't busy around noon on Monday at all. My server was really sweet but I waited awhile before anyone acknowledged me at the table. Just men in uniforms with ear pieces...watching....  All in all, for $75 (tip included) I got a salad and drink, you're paying for the name and experience. Wasn't too impressed by the way I was treated as a guest. I really wanted to try an entree but will have to sadly pass.",

They have so many to choose from you'll definitely not get through them all. Be sure to get different ones and share! We ordered dinner and I had steak frites and mom had a burger. Both which were amazing. The frites were cooked perfectly I normally don't finish a meal but I took it down. Oh I also ordered a French onion soup and yes in this heat and it was one of the best soups I've had!  Mom had a blue cheese burger and it was great.  The fries were delicious too.  The decor is so fun and the music is great!  Outside has some fun candy and duck decor. If you're in Vegas this is definitely a place to check out!  You may even run into a celeb or two!  They have been known to have a sweet tooth and hang out in this hot spot!",

It's a small venue in my opinion especially for being on the strip. Anyhow, the wait for a table was 30 minutes so we decided to sit at the bar. The inside bar was full (can only accommodate roughly 10 people) so we sat outside. Our bartender was nice and moved us inside as soon as the inside bar had an opening. The bartenders inside was also nice. We stayed about 2 hours and drank a 3 goblets. $40 a pop! Not bad but at the same time, they fill these \"fish\" bowls up with so much dry ice and ice that the drinks do come out costly. Our drinks had a good amount of alcohol, so I can't really complain. I heard horrible things about their foos so I'm glad we didn't try any. One thing for sure I wanted to note was, we saw a few ants on the bar tables. Inside and out!  would I be back? Not sure.",

From the minute we walked by and we're approached to the minute we left we received great service. Everyone was so friendly and our server was awesome. Lashawna gave us a great experience. We ordered the goblet and with it came a $3 appetizer for happy hour (which you apparently need a promo card for). The goblet we got was called Energy Bear which came with burnetts watermelon vodka, grey goose vodka, and tropical fruits. It has energized gummy bears inside and topped off with a Red Bull. The goblets are filled with dry ice and they come and bring the drink mixture in a cup and the server pours it in your cup and it pretty much smokes up. We chose wings for the appetizer. Delicious Buffalo wings!!! We got The Farm burger which has an egg on top and gravy with angus beef, and comes with fries. To finish, we had the brownie ice cream sandwich for dessert and that too was amazing.  Overall, a great experience thanks to our server. Expect it to be pricey, but it's worth it. Definitely will be back!",

I figured it was going to be overpriced and gimmicky with average food, but I still wanted the experience. My husband and I ended up eating a light dinner beforehand and just splitting a goblet drink and a milkshake, which was a good idea cause I don't  know if we could have eaten dinner and our drinks, we were having trouble finishing our drinks alone.   Service was pretty slow even though it wasn't crowded. I was disappointed that they were out of the night owl drink, so we settled on the drake. It had cotton candy on top but it melted when they poured the smoke in it. We also got the dulce de leche milkshake with chocolate and popcorn on the mug. The milkshake was pretty decent. The drink was ok but very sugary. We forced ourselves to eat all the candy in it cause it was so expensive. My husband said he was going to be in diabetic shock and have to get his leg cut off after the meal. They don't even give you a price for the goblet drinks. Luckily we had a yelp offer for 50% off a drink, otherwise it would have been $38. We also had coupons on the table for 50% off food but our waitress was kind of cold and said \"well you can only use one, which one do you want to use?\" She tried to be sneaky, she should have just told us it was better to use it for the drinks. Luckily my husband figured the drink would cost more and said to use it for the drink. The only thing we couldn't finish was the lollipop, our waitress gave us a bag to take it home.   I did like the duck theme of the place, I love ducks. The host outside was very nice and offered to take photos of the both of us sitting on the duck. I wanted to get a sparkly duck shirt but they only had kids sizes. I ended up finding one at sugar factory at the airport.   Overall, we had a fun experience. We got a lot of pictures for snapchat of our bubbling drinks and huge milkshake. I'm glad we went there, but we probably wouldn't return because there's better places to eat.",

Loud pop music and the whole restaurant was relatively small. They have small upstairs lounge so I suppose that could make up for it. The food was good but the main problem and the real reason behind my rating is the wait time! Do not come to this restaurant if you have somewhere to be afterwards. We started by ordering drinks. 15 minutes later we ordered appetizers. About 15 minutes later they brought our appetizers and we ordered the entree. 20 minutes later they. Rought the entree. And then 10 minutes later they brought the drinks we ordered (remember those?) after we were done we asked for a to go box which took about another 10 minutes. And then we waited about 25 minutes for them to bring the check! All in all we were probably in this restaurant 2 extra hours that we didn't need to be. I don't plan on coming back any time soon.",

It's very deceptive and I didn't like that at all. Our server seemed like he didn't care for his job which is crazy considering he makes a killing. $6 for a coke seems over the top and the food was also way over priced and just ok, nothing special. Probably a one time deal for this crew...$161 for 3 people and we didn't get much for it (one person only ordered an appetizer and a coke).

    "text": "I don't even know where to start...we walked up to the restaurant & of course my kids want a picture with the big yellow duck. They get up by the duck & go to sit on it & someone from the restaurant comes out & yells at them. Put a sign up if you don't want kids climbing on the duck, it is an attractive nuisance! Then we go to the front to be seated & are seated at a table that is very wobbly. I ask to be moved to a different table that is not wobbly; they move us to another slightly less wobbly table. We wait at least 10 minutes before our waiter comes to the table. Actually another waiter had to tell him to wait on us. So we order...it takes forever to get our coffee which is cold and the orange juice the kids ordered comes when they are almost done eating. The OJ was GROSS, dark in color. We got our meals & mine was the completely wrong thing. So the waiter takes it back & brings me what I ordered. My husband got an omelette that had no taste & some toast. No butter or jelly is offered for the toast, so he asks for jelly. About 10 minutes goes by & he asks again for jelly & now fresh toast. The waiter told us they were getting fresh jelly out of the fridge...what?!?! What, really...it takes over 10 minutes to get jelly out of the fridge...ummmm ok.   Now the coffee situation...you would think that when you order coffee you would get a hot cup of coffee...no, not here. And when we asked for new, hot coffee the waiter brings one cup and tells us that is the last cup & their coffee maker is broken and the coffee they got from Starbucks is gone. WTF! Seriously!   Now, I expect a place to be very nice when I'm paying $15-$18 for one breakfast dish. Not the case. As I stated both tables were wobbly, the crevice around the table had old, nasty food in it, NO COFFEE, black cloth napkins stuffed under table legs to make the tables not wobble & there were wires hanging down from a chandelier. It is really the little things this place is missing! It's all the little things that add up!   We will never, ever go back. The manager did offer for us to come back later for dessert...nope, no thank you, not even for free!  Update to this review: we did get our meal for free. This still did not change the experience we had. I'd rather pay full price & have 5-star experience!   After I posted this review we were offered to come back. Management said they would make a reservation & provide us with a 5-star experience. I accepted as our kids really wanted to have a huge milkshake. Then I get another message stating she didn't realize our meal had been comped & she was confused that I still gave a one star review. Really? I was a little shocked. Yes, our meal was comped because it was a horrible experience. I was told they would give the kids free milkshakes and basically asking me to post another review & make it positive. I declined & then was told basically that I am trying to take advantage of them.   Really think about choosing a different restaurant if you are considering this one!",

    "text": "We came here on a Monday night. Not too crowded. We were seated immediately. The menu is huge and it's so hard to decide what to order, but we settled on the lollipop goblet, rainbow sliders, mac and cheese pops, and white chocolate burger. They were out of the mac and cheese pops. :(  They started us with the goblet. It's pretty messy. When the waitress dumped the liquid into the goblet it boiled violently and got all over our table. We had to use our napkins to soak up the mess, she didn't even seem to noticed. Be careful when drinking these goblets because the dry ice creates gas and that gas is pretty painful when you inhale it if your straw is unfortunate will enough to hit an air pocket.  You will end up with a mouth full of gas up your nose and it's pretty painful. The sliders were pretty good that was probably one of my favorite parts of the meal. The burger was OK but super messy and not at all visually appealing. The fries it came with were pretty good. We decided to try a milkshake for dessert and had the Smore's milkshake. Be forewarned this thing contains a lot of espresso! I stayed up all night easily after drinking that milkshake, but it was so good. Layers of chocolate and marshmallow. The marshmallows were toasted to perfection! Service was a bit slow for how empty they were on a Monday night, but it's a place you want to hang out at for a while anyways. I will definitely have to make a return trip to try some more of their menu items.",

Even when the waitress arrived with them she asked if we wanted to video her pouring (the dry ice has an 'ahhh' effect). We spent our time snapping pics and oohing and ahhing over said drinks. We got one with alcohol and one without so my daughter could share. They were tasty too. Then my daughter's milkshake came. More oohing and ahhing and pics. Taste was so-so. A Friendly's Fribble is better. Then the bill came. Did I tell you there were no prices on the menu? 100.00 for these three drinks! What stays in Vegas is our money! But it was fun. Oh, and those Huuuuge drinks had so much ice in the glasses they were pretty much the size of an average drink. So if you're going to go, be prepared",

The music is fairly loud and energetic! The tables are close together, not so much room for intimate eating. We ordered the calamari, it came out over cooked and salty, the outside crust was terribly crunchy and the calamari itself was hard. We then ordered a turkey burger, which was good, not worth $17. It was average is size and came with a small helping of shoe string fries. For dessert we had the bananas foster. We were so excited when it arrived. It looked so delicious! Our excitement left us the moment we tried to cut the macadamia nut cookies, but couldn't. They were so hard.... just disappointed. Would not dine here again.

First of all to have that many people order food and to all have their meals within 5-10 minutes of the first meal being brought out is super impressive and shows how well the staff work together. The manager (I believe his name was Shawn introduced himself and made sure anything we wanted was takes care of. Our servers name was Eric and what a fantastic guy!! Such patience for dealing with such a large group and so so sweet and professional.     They truly made it an unforgettable experience.

My husband asked for a booth because I have a bad back but the hostesses didn't even try to accommodate that so, he finally said \"my wife is pregnant\" I'm 7 months pregnant. The hostesses finally agreed to seat us in a booth but I noticed one of the hostesses look at my belly as I pass them by. After that, they were rude and my husband and I could hear them talk about us since we were seated right next to their podium. I, too was a hostess in my lifetime. They are the first people you see, they are the first impression. Here, there representation was indecent and unacceptable.   However, the star of the night was our Server, Shawnee. Without her this review with be a '1 star', this review right now would not even survive. We were there because it was our daughters birthday and she has been requesting  to have dinner at the 'Sugar Factory' for months.  Shawnee took care my family, she came to our table because she noticed we have been waiting for a while. First she served us our drinks, like how it always should be, we were ready to order our food by that time. The entire time we were there; I can't count how many times she came to check on me and my family. Shawnee was so attentive and amenable. She and the food runner were the only ones who smiled at us and treated us really good. The food was delicious as always and so were our favorite goblets, we had two virgins and a non-virgin for my husband.  Shawnee got a really tip at the end of our meal. She came back to thank my husband, Thank YOU Shawnee!!! and the cooks. We had a long day, we were exhausted and hungry. We wanted good food and to be treated right, thank you for making our night Shawnee, food runner and cooks!.",

    "text": "When it comes to overpriced gimmicks but super cute, Sugar Factory is the place to go. This place is the wonderland place to go for Instagram photos, and memories with crazy drinks. Their theme is basically ducks & candy. So there is TWO locations on the strip, and yelp photos does not help because it is all mixed up. The location at the Fashion Mall is the one you want to go to.   The location at the fashion mall is at the end of the strip next to Treasure Island. The sugar factory here is the place to go, because there are tons of photo opportunities. The restaurant, yes it is a restaurant too, is located along the outside of the mall with a giant duck outside to take photos with. Upstairs, by taking the outside escalator, outside is a field of photos wanting to be taken with tons of candy, carousel, gazebo, bunnies, and tons of marshmallow looking roses. It is one of the cutest setup I ever seen! The menu has food and drink options. Reminds me of the Cheesecake Factory since there is so many options. Also, inside the restaurant, there is a small candy shop where you can shop for duck things and fill up on candy.   The other location is at the planet Hollywood. This is more of a small shop where you go to get only drinks and candy quickly. There isn't much to do since it is more like stand where you can sit if you like, but it is more of go get your items then leave because of the lack of space.   NUTELLA DE LECHE MILKSHAKE: This is one of the cutest thing I ever seen. It is a giant mug that is half covered in chocolate and sprinkles. On top there is a small chocolate covered banana, candy necklace, and a giant unicorn lollipop. This is seriously a kids dream, and adults heart attack with all the sweets. However, even with the beautiful display, it was just not good. I hate to say that it was all looks, and nothing to show.   THE DRAKE: This was a giant drink with cotton candy on top. Basically they serve you a drink with dry ice, cotton candy, and gummies in a giant cup where they would pour the alcohol over the entire thing to basically get that smoking and bubbly effect. Like the milkshake, it was just not impressive. However, the taste of it was just plain gross. It tasted like medicine with tons of sugar. I could not drink it at all, and we just left it on the table to look pretty.   Like the milkshake & the crazy sugar alcohol drink, there is tons of variety to choose from. You can order the sugar drink without alcohol, which I forgot to do because I feel like it would have been better. Either way, the two drinks set me back $70 which is very high but not bad at the same time considering the size of the alcohol drink. I did not try the food, but from the lack of people I would guess that it was not that good.   This is a place that you need to try for the cute factor especially if you have kids. It is expensive but what isn't on the strip?! It is one of those places that you need to experience at least once. Even with the bad food and drinks, I got tons of great photos and i think the desserts are the best thing to go with here.",

    "text": "Been dying to come to Sugar factory so we decided to come to the Fashion Show mall and saw that they have a sugar factory. The drinks are super cute and makes every picture so fun and cute. The actual drinks are super strong and sweet! The bowl is good enough for 2-3 people to share. There's no price in the menu but a bowl is a whopping $40. It could range from that price and higher, I'm unsure.  I heard that the Lollipop passion goblet is their most popular. It's pretty good but in my opinion too sweet, I felt like I was having a real sugar rush. My friend had their Peace Love & Hermonie, she enjoyed it very much. Pretty pricey for such a small cup she received but it's alright. (Not pictured)  I probably would come back here next time but just share a goblet with a family or friend. Their food looks amazing too. Low key wish I ate here, we saw a lot of people getting the pasta. Until next time!",

Ok, the sundae here for two is ridiculously huge! It really is meant for four! It was crazy good but so huge. We celebrated our daughter's birthday here because she absolutely loved the desserts here few days before. They delivered a big birthday wishes with those giant sparkling candle! She loved it! They have a very large menu selections from food to beverages and most of all their nice selection of desserts. It's a huge celebrity endorsed place but my kids had a blast. Definitely a place to go celebrate a birthday. Something to try too! Just make sure you bring your sweat pants to eat those huge size sundaes and milkshakes!",

    "text": "\"Life is short, make it sweet!\"  My experience at Sugar Factory was one to remember! I had such a fun interactive dining experience from the second I walked into the establishment. This is the place for date nights, birthdays, and celebrations! It's not too over priced...it's honestly the same price as going to Cheesecake Factory. Definitely ditch the chain dining and come check out Sugar Factory.  My server Jason was awesome! He made sure my boyfriend and I were taken care of from start the finish.  I ordered the sugar factory cheeseburger and it was SO DELICIOUS!! It was $18 and came with French fries (not bad). The food also came out very quickly!   I did make a reservation ahead of time but it wasn't really necessary even though it was a Friday night. I'm not exactly sure why it wasn't busy, but I'm not complaining because we had a whole section of the restaurant to ourselves which made it perfect for date night!   Alcohol is a must! I know $39 is a bit much for a drink but I assure you it's worth it!! Get the drink!! You will totally regret it. They are strong and sweet...the perfect combination. I had the Ocean Blue because I don't have much of a sweet tooth but I was really impressed with how well everything went.   Don't forget to check out the Chocolate lounge upstairs and the gift shop! Great experience!! Definitely coming back!",

Not much of anything in it. Taste was okay but felt like they cut corners on quality. I do think they put the wrong chicken on it-looked grilled or roasted in picture  but was a small char grilled chicken with a tough lacquer crust. My friend got same salad and returned it. I would say good this place is especially good for kids, teens, young adults. Giving it three stars for the ambience and concept which is fun and  cool and also excellent service. Food is average and overpriced.",

    "text": "Oh how I wanted to like this place, but I left unimpressed.  I had the tomato bisque $9 and onion rings $12.  The soup was tasty but was no more than 5 spoons in quantity.  The onion rings (8 qty) were decent.  My wife had the big cheesy burger which was $19, she rated it 3 out of 5 stars.  My mother in law had the club sandwich which was around the same price of the burger and decent size.  The ice tea came out in a 6oz glass that had to be refilled constantly.  I felt bad for the waiter, the size of the ice tea made zero sense.  My daughter had the mini burgers w/ special sauce.  Those were not good at all, over cooked and their special sauce must have been put on with a teaspoon.  I would give them one star specially for the price.  Since we were celebrating my daughter's 6th birthday, I thought the sugar factory would throw in something special, the only thing special was the price $10.  The dessert was made up of 3 scoops of chocolate ice cream, whip cream and a sister sparkler type candle.  The menus were dirty and needed to be wiped off (really gross actually), the seat we were sitting at was ripped.    Food 2 stars out of 5 Value 1 star out of 5 Waiter was a 4 out of 5 Cleanliness 2 stars out of 5  I would not recommend sugar factory for dining or dessert based off of my first visit.",

I'm usually able to taste the alcohol flavor after awhile of drinking, but I didn't taste any alcohol while drinking this one. I think the lollipop in my drink helped it taste better bu hiding the alcohol flavor. I'd recommend sharing these goblet size drinks with others, but you can always ask for to go cups at this location if you don't finish. We also ordered fried macaroni and cheese pops and some type of cheese quesadilla. The food was a bit pricy for the amount you get, but the macaroni and cheese pops were very good. The quesadilla was good too, but there wasn't really anything special about it.  At this location, you have to buy the cup separately if you want to keep it unlike other Sugar Factory locations. I'd recommend this location if you're here to relax while snacking on food and not just here for the cool goblet cup.",

Apparently it's also a big spot for celebrities like Drake, Amber Rose, The Kardashian crew, and many others.  Honestly though I don't know what all the hype was about.  Don't get me wrong the shakes were good, drinks were interesting, and ice cream was decent at best.  In my opinion this is more of a place to check out just because it exists vs. somewhere you actually want to visit. I rarely bring up prices, but $19 for a milkshake is excessive. Again though this is all opinion and due to the attention this place has received it's worth a shot.   The actual restaurant itself is nothing out of this world. Looks kind of like a more current version of what a 50's diner would look like today. Music was on point though.    The waitress who helped us though definitely deserved 5 stars. She was able to memorize all the different liquors in the various fish bowls. Pretty impressive.",

    "text": "My family had such a great time here at the Sugar Factory at Fashion Show Mall. We celebrated my nieces 18th birthday so my family reserved a space in the Chocolate Lounge. When you first enter the lounge there's a step and repeat sign (photo backdrop) where you can take pictures in front of it.   The chocolate lounge is upstairs and right off the back patio where you can ride a carousel and take beautiful pictures. It's very picturesque! It has spectacular views of the strip and the lights are breathtaking at night.   So much food was ordered for my niece and her friends. They each received red candy buckets on the table. But why not! It's the sugar factory! They each ordered the infamous Goblets. Each one ordering from their own taste. Hers which ones they ordered (Virgin of course!) duh!   Lollipop Passion   The Drake - I ordered this! You can always count on me for cotton candy   White Gummi Watermelon Patch   Each goblet is super cute! You can take the cup home for an additional $15 on top of the already $25 drink. You decide if it's worth it.   Anyways, the food was delish. I ordered the rainbow  sliders.   Other food ordered (which was all family style) was:  Banana Split Waffle Country fried chicken and waffle -  Baskets of fries Fried Mac & Cheese Pops Spinach Artichoke Dip Grilled Mini Burgers Sampler Platters Chinese chicken salad  The Signature Sugar Factory Burger - my husband ordered   All this food came around a thousand times! So much was ordered and it was all delicious.   Service was great! Especially for a party of such large size.  Parking was fine. We parked in the Neiman Marcus parking lot and walked right up to Las Vegas Blvd. we did get lost by going to the Miracle Mike Shops. That's not the right one if you're trying to find the chocolate lounge. She did give me a couple coupons for the mixup. Lol   I really cannot wait to go back there.  I think the one in Los Angeles is open. I wonder if they'll have the same flair. I'll definitely be going.",

    "text": "I was pleasantly surprised by the food and service at Sugar Factory based on other reviews. I knew this was going to be a novelty experience eating \"pretty\" food, so I didn't have huge expectations beyond the aesthetics. Of course we had to try the rainbow sliders.  Nothing amazing taste-wise, but not bad. The prices for entrees seemed steep, but the sandwich prices were reasonable. My husband and I split the filet sandwich, and it was PLENTY to share since we'd had the appetizer. We steered clear of the $40 cocktails based on the advice of other reviewers, and opted instead to splurge on the $19 Tie Dye milkshake. It was big, ornate, and tasty. Again, you're paying for the novelty... no different than paying $50 for a cheaply made concert t-shirt.  Several reviews mention poor service. Our server was very attentive, but we went on a Monday night. The restaurant is huge, and I imagine it's a madhouse on the weekends. I wouldn't let the possibility of bad service deter you from dining on a weekday.  Cons:  I could've done without the endless stream of Kardashian photos flashing on huge TV screens throughout the restaurant. Not my idea of dinner entertainment.  Also, I wish I'd checked the math on the tip amount suggested on my receipt rather than just checking the box. Another reviewer's photo showed it was calculated almost double the amount! I know some restaurants will suggest gratuity based on amount before discount if a coupon is used, but otherwise that's super shady. I'll be interested to see if other people post receipt photos now that someone has pointed it out.",

As my daughter really wanted to dine at this place we will return as Corey is attempting to make it right and display that they are much better than our experience.

Everything looked good but I finally decided on a fettuccini Alfredo with shrimp, an apple pie crepe with coconut ice cream, and bottomless mimosas. The food was buttery, heavenly deliciousness and washed down well with the mimosas.   Our server, Mark, was really cool and even got us to-go cups for our last mimosa.  I love Vegas!!",

Great place to get a night on the town started, large and sweeet drinks filled with different candy's. I had the white chocolate and apple bacon burger It was messy to eat but a finger licking good. I need to go back when I can have one of their out of control shakes.",

The ambiance for the restaurant was classy and cute with an added candy shop/ice cream parlor. We paid about $110 for appetizers and one of their custom milk shakes. The food was just okay nothing special and our rainbow burgers were a little cold with the buns kinda hard around the edges. We also ordered wings which were also a little cold and their French onion soup had a burnt taste to it. The milk shake we got was the sugar daddy with a cheese cake slice on it (not to sure the name) it was just ok and didn't taste like it had chunks of cheese cake in it like the picture described. Over you pay for the experience like I said not for the quality.",

The staff there were very nice, we got seated at a table right under the air vent which made us really cold, and they switched us without any problem.

    "text": "I wish I could give this restaurant negative stars. We went here for breakfast. I ordered the eggs, sausage, home style potatoes, and toast. The toast was to be delivered on a separate plate so my friend could have it because it could make me very sick. When ordering I made it very clear that I had a wheat allergy NOT a gluten free preference. The top of the menu CLEARLY STATED THAT THE HOME STYLE  potatoes came with the meal I ordered.    The meal took 21 to be delivered to the table.  When it arrived I asked about my home style potatoes.  The server was new and said he didn't know why they weren't there.  He then came back with his trainer. They said they did not have those any longer, and that I could have hash browns like my friend was having instead if I wanted. I told them the menu was clear, and I wanted what I ordered. I also stated that I was not able to eat the hashbrowns that my friend ordered. Their hashbrowns are the same kind that McDonald's serve! Really? for the price you charge, Sugar?!? That aside I can't eat them which I told the server. He asked what I would like instead. I said to speak with your manager.  6 minutes later (yes I timed all this) I got up and went to the front counter to find out where the manager was? I was told they were on their way. Soon two were at my table.  They wanted to know what the problem was... I explained again. They said that they had new menus coming the next day that would be corrected and not offering the home potatoes. They said that the hashbrowns contained no wheat. I told them that the preformed items they had been serving were not wheat or \"gluten\" free. The packaging would say that they were. They also would say that they weren't on shared equipment. They most likely have a binder and that is why they can maintain that shape! The waiter had taken a photo of the box. The ingredients did not ot include straight wheat or flour. They did have dextrose and other ingredients that are so li g to be honest... I don't even know how to spell them, much less what os in then so I can't eat them for my own safety.   I explained all this to the two condescending managers. They offered me asparagus to go with my eggs and sausage which were almost gone. I told them no thank you that didn't sound like an appetizing combination. They said, \"then what do you want?\". I said to not pay for my meal. They did end up waiving our bill. This was a horrible experience. I felt that thes people were just obnoxious. More importantly as a landmark food establishment they didn't care that they could have put me in a situation of truly dangerous illness.   I did get my bill waived. My actual server was very nice. His trainer was not there to help him at all or this wouldn't have happened. Our food was late. I could have been made seriously I'll. The management was nasty and condescending. Strong work Sugar!",

    "text": "I was embarrassed! My daughter and I had been wanting to eat at the Sugar Factory for some time now. Being that we are locals we don't get out much in our city so we decided to invite a few family and friends and turn our first trip into a celebration for my daughters 19th birthday.   I thought this would be the perfect place to do so that is until we arrived. Once we arrived we had to wait about 10 minutes in the retail store which was not bad since it was only 4 people in our party of 10 that had arrived. When the hostess escorted us through the restaurant we were taken upstairs and seated.   There was not much staff present which was made aware by the staff complaining to one another at the bar near our table. When I made reservations on the phone the week prior I advised that it was my daughter's birthday. The waiter came over and wishes her happy birthday and asked if we were ready to start off drinks and we let him know others were still one the way and that seems to be when we were forgotten about. Our additional guest seemed to have trouble finding us when they arrive despite them giving the name that my reservation was made under and one guest was even advised that they were NOT aware of our reservation. Once the rest of the group arrived and ordered we had a special request from our pregnant guest and I thought making it known that she was not just sending the food back to be a bitch but was sending it for adjustment for her dietary restrictions but that did not go well when her dish was adjusted a hair was also added to her meal. I even had to shh her and another guest when it was discovered so as not to make such a big deal in front of my daughter. A man came over not sure if he was the manager or what because he did not address himself as one at all he of course apologized and offered her something else and of course she declined. The one person that should have been served first was the one that did not even get to eat. Once the rest of the food arrived and was finished our plates sat at the table and we watched as the few staff walked back and fourth busy doing something else. The first chance we got to wave someone down we asked for the check and still had to wait for that as by the time I got my change the entire table had already got up and was headed for the door.   No Happy Birthday song or dance for my daughter and not Happy Birthday memories at the Sugar Factory for us. What really made me upset and write this review was as we all gathered on the elevator to head out and arrived to the restaurant where all the others were I saw all those there having a good time servers happy and waiting on them having a good time listening to good music and a great atmosphere I felt like our reservation was rush or not even accounted for or forgotten and they stuck us upstairs hoping we did not notice. Maybe they thought we were from out of town and that is how they treat them because they don't know any better but this native was NOT impressed by this place and I will not recommend it to anyone else or have dinner there again. Glad that everyone else enjoyed their food at the least and there was only ONE hair found.   I don't know what it was but they need to get it together. If I could give starts for food and then starts for service then this rating would be different but with my background in customer service their bad service out weighted the food and once you find anything in your food that does not belong in the first place it just takes the joy and carelessness of the evening out the door because with every bite we all had our eyes on everything we touched. I am going to cut it short because I could certainly keep going but the fact that she should have know that the service was bad and made no attempts to correct it showed us a lot. Maybe our quite party of 10 was too much for them.",

We ended up not drinking and ordered:  1. rainbow sliders (comes with a free mini duck)- the flavor was on point and the colors were def IG friendly. I loved it! The burgers had a lot of flavor and the right amount of filling to meat to bread ratio.  2. Calamari- keep in mind it is like tempura style (fluffy and airy- slightly seasoned) I really enjoyed the calamari because it seemed not as greasy *please note they do not have tarter sauce and have marinara   For dessert we got the cookie jar sundae (meant for 2 people)- it was massive there were 4 of us and we barley made a dent. The ice cream is from San Francisco and absolutely delicious.   I will be back with another Groupon to try more but it is really pricey. They have special events- new years and superbowl which is 100.00 a person and includes food and goblets for free. I will do that in the future for sure!!!",

    "text": "Soooo glad they reopened this sweet place!!! I loved the one at the Paris Casino so when they closed that I was really bummed.  This location now has added the Chocolate Lounge upstairs to the Sugar Factory. So this trip we decided to check  that out.  We had a wonderful view as we ordered two sweet drinks, my daughter had the Bubble Gum cocktail and I had a Raspberry Martini--even though not on their menu they will make any cocktail for you.   The dark chocolate fondue for 2 was delicious! It came with small bites of brownies, lemon cake, angel cake, marshmallows, bananas, gummy bears & strawberries.  The wait staff are beautiful & sweet too!! Although pricey ($70 including gratuity) it really is a cute place to have a dessert, specialty drinks. They also have a candy store & full food menu. It totally reminds me of a new age version of Farrell's. I am def a fan!",

The opening date kept getting pushed back but now the downstairs at least is finally open.  Upstairs is a Chocolate Lounge that is coming soon.    We wanted to sit at the bar for happy hour but it was full.  We were offered 2 for 1 goblets if we sat at a table.  We took them up on it but that was a mistake.  Our server wouldn't let us keep a menu at the table and rushed us out before we finished our first round.  We planned on having more drinks but ended up just leaving.  Drinks were good but I prefer the small cocktails to the goblets.  Next time I will sit at the bar where hopefully we will get better service.",

We had to ask 3 times for jam and in the end only got it for the table when I had to go inside and track someone down. Food was cold by that time. We waited well over an hour for eggs and when we finally did get our food it was wayyyy undercooked for two of us. We waited another 30 mins for a fried egg to be redone -??? AND THEY WERE SLIMY AND UNDERCOOKED AGAIN!! In the end the two meals got comped but when our friends got their bill there was an automatic 18% tip added to their bill. Ridiculous!!! Oh and they also said they would not accept change. Give me a break. The Kardashians might get the royal treatment here but not everyday people and we were not the only table complaining. Never again!",

My husband then goes to the bathroom. Yes its my fault I assumed he paid! He comes out bar tender says bye and we go to candy store. My husband assumed I paid. Total misunderstanding! Yes it was my fault! But I was in store almost hour wondering picking stuff out. Then go to leave and am scolded and embarrassed infront of others on the strip for not paying... Excuse me!!! It was an accident and I promptly turned and paid. There was no need to let me walk around for an hour and then yell at me! I am beyond pissed and believe they overcharged us on purpose after so. We will NEVER be returning and I wish I could have returned the items I bought.",

She thought my friends didn't pay their tab & in actuality they did pay their tab! Although she charged us 2x for the same tab! I had a party of 10 & she was very disoriented the entire time she waited on our table. Almost like a deer in the headlights! She needs to work on getting the customers engaged in what the Sugar Factory has to offer by displaying a more positive/upbeat energy with the customers! She's lifeless. Luckily Gerard, the manager is the BEST in life! He literally made everything better & made me want to go back. I rate his service a 10! Mijka on the other hand need's a lot of guidance & coaching from upper management in order to be successful. If the proper coaching isn't given, I'm sure Mijka will continue to be rude, provide poor customer service & cause a deficit in revenue for Sugar Factory. The atmosphere is fun & is great for selfies. The food & Goblet drinks are the best!",

Update: It's obvious that the managerial staff takes pride in their restaurants. One of the managers reached out to me and completely apologized for the experience and invited us back to the restaurant. This visit last night was 100x better than our first. We constantly had our drinks full, the food came or very quickly, and our waiter, Jason, was just very prompt in general. We got the appetizer platter and the pretty patty burgers. It was all pretty good. And we finished the meal with a fondue that was pretty awesome too.",

We ended up ordering what I think was something like popcorn shrimp. It was alright, nothing amazing, have definitely had better elsewhere for cheaper. I ended up ordering a goblet. The goblet was amazing. I almost drank the whole thing by myself but barely got buzzed though and I'm someone who rarely drinks so if you're looking to get turnt then I wouldn't suggest spending that much money on a goblet. We wanted dessert so we ordered a brownie ice cream thing, I don't remember what it's called. We were then told they were out of brownies (shocker) but that they could substitute the brownie with a cookie. We were down because the lady said she would make it really special for us. Yeah...no. The cookie was basically concrete. We couldn't even eat it. I was genuinely scared of chipping a tooth trying to bite the cookie. It was ridiculous. The service wasn't great. The only friendly person we encountered was the guy outside leading people inside. Two stars- one for the cool dude outside and one for the good tasting goblet.",

The really cool thing about it, though, is the dry ice. At first, all they serve you is a bowl of ice but then they pour your drink in and steam pours out of the huge gauntlet. The process is really cool and if you ever see one of these places you should really go. The only bad thing about it is the price. Each one of the drinks is 30 dollars... Also,  we came around 5 and it looked pretty dead. It would've had a better atmosphere if more people were there and the Vegas lights were lit up. Other than that, it is a really cool place I that I really enjoyed going to!",

Since I had about 15 people joining me, I had to pre-order the food and everything which was understandable & insightful. We were escorted to the 2nd floor with a beautiful view of the strip. First thing, wow being escorted pretty awesome, and it was very nice because the 2nd floor was a little quieter than downstairs. It was a bit dim, so we asked if they can turn up the lights a little more which they did with no problem. After dinner we decided to take some pictures outside where the gazebo was which came out very beautiful. The staff, Emon, Ellie, Omar, Courtney and Dave you were all awesome and very welcoming. Special thank you to Sabrina who handled the whole reservation, I wish I could've met her in person & to our main host Emon for his patience and incredible service. Overall, the ambience was truly amusing and charming. My friends and I had never been to this location before so we were all exceedingly impressed and loved it. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone celebrating a special day, they will take care of you! Will definitely be coming back sometime soon.",

    "text": "WORSE Restaurant  on the Strip...STARY AWAY.. When it was located at the Paris hotel this was an awesome place. Great food and service.  Then they moved to Fashion mall, it sucks big time. I went there when they reopened and had bad service and the food tasted bad. They took off the menu, the great tasting drinks. My Well done  hamburger was raw. sent it back and it came back medium. Just ate it and left. My wife's club sandwich was dry.   We tried it again on my birthday. Again, really bad service, several of our party had to send their food back. We bought a Big Smokin drink for the kids for $35.00. mostly filled with ICE. about 10 oz of fruit punch and very little smoke. we sent it back because the fruit punch was sour and tasted like crap. the kids hated it. it was suppose to be a sweet drink. My BLT bacon was raw.  We all left their vow to never come back.  HOWEVER.   Last week my wife and I were at Wynn and she bought a groupon for breakfast at the Sugar Factory. So we though, How bad can they ruin breakfast? Well they did. I ordered an Eggs Benedict and my wife got a Bacon egg croissant.  Mine came with salmon on it, and my wife got a ham croissant sandwich with no egg. I told the guy who brought it that it was wrong and he goes, OH and walks away. We finally got our waitress  to sent it back.  30 min later, I got my eggs benedict cold. my with got bacon and eggs. eggs were raw and bacon was raw. We talked to the manager who was ruid and she said she would comp  another meal for my wife to go. I just ate mine cold. so they took back her bacon and eggs and she ordered a Club to Go. So basically we gave them a groupon for 2 meals, I ate one, sent one back and the Club was suppose to be free. we got a bill for 3 meals. I was pissed. she said she would take that off and then came back and wanted $5.00 for tax. 20 min later still no Club. At that point my wife and I left. NO CLUB. $60 groupon for a cold egg benedict.   The next day we went to Denny's got 2 breakfast for $14.50 and it was hot and yummy and quick.",

    "text": "Saw pix of the cute place & drinks we decided to try out this place for a bday dinner. Our drinks & food order was taken pretty quickly. Food was ok. I ordered the Salmon nothing too great. If it wasn't for the lil sauce they had on the plate I think it would have been too dry. But the sauce was yum. The drink was tasty but too pricey since you don't get to keep the cup. I ordered the same drink the day before on the strip paid $38 & got to keep my cup. The restaurant was $42 (I believe) & if you want the cup its $15 more. We also ordered a shake that we kept asking the waiter for. The electricity went out therefore we were not able to order anything else so our dinner was cut short. Note: we never got the shake we ordered from the very beginning yet he said because the lights went out they were unable to make it. Yet it was ordered & asked for over & over. I can't say I'd recommend this place. I don't mind spending but as long as I feel its worth it & the experience wasn't great here.",

    "text": "Update: I decided to give this place another try and from what I see, they have improved extremely since their first opening week. Jennevive, Sean, and my waitress were very pleasant and made sure my boyfriend and I were well taken care of. I absolutely enjoy their menu. It's full of yummy and interesting sweet beverages (you have to try one of the Goblets). The ambiance is lovely, classy yet hip and the environment live and fun. I'll definitely be back with some friends and family!!!  Not a good experience. I sat at the bar and was served by an Asian guy, I believe his name tag said \"ST\"... unfortunately he wasn't as enthusiastic with me as he was with other patrons. I sat at the bar and was ignored for about 15 mins, even the patrons sitting next to me were inquiring and wondering what was the deal. So I finally spoke up and asked if I could order. I ordered my drink but I wasn't given water like the other customers. He poured the drink and walked away and never gave me a straw. I had to ask another bartender, who I also had to make my food order with. She was great (sucks I can't remember her name). The drink was delicious and though my food order took forever and a day, I was comped for my second drink. All in all, I probably won't return. I'm unsure why I didn't receive the keen service as others but it was very disappointing to experience such at a reputable restaurant.",

We sat down and the server was extremely rude when he said he wouldn't split the check with us. Then we told him that two Groupons and he said we could only use one and we should've read the fine print that there was one Groupon per table. We asked to speak to the Manager. The server then came over and threw a laminated copy of the Groupon fine print to us. We asked to have us sit at separate tables and were told no. The Manager didn't come talk to us and my husband went and spoke to someone else. They explained that since we came in together...we are considered a group and they wouldn't do it. Oh...and the restaurant was empty. They wouldn't even consider letting us move tables. Needless to say, we all got up and left. Hoping that Groupon will give us our  money back. Worst customer service ever.",

We wanted to have the special ice cream with cotton candy that we read about online, but that was a special so they didn't have it. That's not so bad. Since it was over 100, we walked really far and 11 o'clock at night, we decided ice cream would be refreshing. We sat down at a booth and were served ice waters by a very nice waiter. There was no ice cream on the menu, only specialty shakes and $50 troughs of ice cream. The waiter told us to wait in line where they served the custard, sorbet and ice cream scoops and then take it back to the table. This was confusing because we were taking up his table and paying at a different place. No one told us where the line was so we waited for a really long time without anyone helping us.",

I told the young man at the door I had a reservation and he knew my first and last name which I thought was pretty awesome. He walked us in and to our table and almost immediately our server Terri came and introduced herself and went over some menu items with us in a way that wasn't so \"robotic\". It was very conversational and when we asked questions she was able to answer them for us. Terri was super sweet and friendly.  Now, you may be thinking \"well, they're gonna be extra nice this time around. They're making up for last time\". Not at all. We noticed the other customers were receiving the same treatment and service, which shows this wasn't just for me. I strongly believe my first experience was a one off, and I thank Jennevive for extending out an invitation to show us. We had a great time, great drinks, food. Can't wait to come back! In the mean time I'll enjoy my own drinks out of my souvenir cup! Couldn't resist!",

The food was mediocre at best and not worth the money. My friend had an average grilled cheese. I didn't get my omelette because we waited so long for the server it was 4:02 and they stopped serving eggs. That was just one example of the awful service. The first time we went for drinks and dessert service wasn't bad although it took about 20 minutes to get an extra spoon and another 20 for the check. The second time it took 30 minutes to be seated even though there was nobody waiting. Then about 20 minutes for the server to take our order and then about 40 minutes for the order to arrive. We had to ask a different waiter about our food. We made sure to ask for the check when the food came. Of course, they charged for the omelette I wasn't allowed to order. They took it off obviously but it was just another example of the horrible service. This place desperately needs a good manager and a better trained staff especially with the prices they charge!",

I use to go to the Sugar Factory at the Paris for years! It was amazing, never had a problem. When they closed I was Devastated. I was excited when they open a new at Fashion Show. I decided to go for my birthday, we went on Saturday, May 13th, I called and made a reservation. We went to the chocolate lounge because I was excited for their menu compared to down stairs menu. Every time I passed by when shopping at fashion show I would look at their menu board outside. I was so excited!  Well we get there and they don't even have the menu available. Strike 1. The place was completely empty. (Red flag) we were the only customer for a long time.  We order, it takes an hour for our drinks and food. Food was cold. It was the menu from downstairs. We were the only people there. I was trying not to cry. My friends had asked for sugar factory to do something special for my birthday (I didn't know). Which ended up having us sit there for an extra 30 mins-1 hour for 2 scoops for vanilla ice cream with sparklers. Apparently they had forgot and then changed us when they said they were comping it. And then over changed my cousin $20 on a $40 bill ($60) and they denied over charging her. And she had to dispute the transaction with her bank. She also had a $7 ice tea that tasted like fish, it was disgusting!  We all ended up getting food poisoning. My birthday was ruined. I tried to stay positive but after we left I started balling my eyes out. I will never go back to Sugar Factory. It's nothing like how it was at the Paris.   The manager on duty said he was going to take care of us for my birthday, but didn't do anything.   Over priced. Horrible food. Long wait. Food poisoning.   You can't pay me to go back there. Thanks for ruining my birthday.",

Justin's attention to detail was beyond my expectation. We eat out A LOT and there are VERY FEW servers that exceed my expectations. Justin may be only one of a handful of people I've sought out the manager to tell them about how wonderful they were. \"Examples: Justin brought us new silverware because he didn't like that they ones we had weren't polished. He brought me extra strawberries when I questioned if I got the mixed berry or strawberry french toast. (They only have a strawberry version that has a mix of raspberries, black berries and strawberries.)\" I can't give enough stars to how much this experience has raised the bar even more for the rest of the serves I encounter!",

The host was sweet and talked us up a bit which was nice. Our server was very attentive and friendly which is why I'm giving this place two stars instead of one. The reason for the low rating was the food. It was cold and bland and terrible. Prices were way too high for that quality. I got a creme brulee latte for $13 and it was served in a tiny cup and halfway through it it got terribly sweet. I've had creme brulee lattes before so I am aware of how sweet they get but this was gross. I drank it anyway needing the caffeine. I could've gotten two coffees at starbucks next door and still had change in my pocket. The potatoes were stale and cold and they give you half a scoop. I can't even compare it to the freezer bag of potatoes you would get at the super market because even those taste better. The New York steak and eggs was a joke. The steak didn't even look grilled. There were no grill marks and it looked like someone slapped it on to a cold pan. No good looking sear or anything. On top of that it looked like a cheap diner piece of meat. It was a very thin small over cooked piece of meat. The picture makes it looked like a thick cut beautifully grilled slab. They give you one piece of toast too. For $22 they couldn't even give you a full order. $7 for an order of bacon that wasn't even thick cut but looked like something you would get at a drive thru. I got the Alaskan Benedict. You know when you forgot to zip up a bag of meat in the fridge and the edges become hard and brown? Yeah that's how the edges of my soles salmon looked. I work at a breakfast lunch and dinner spot that sells food half the price but higher quality and properly cooked. Unfortunately my boyfriend and I aren't people to complain and ask for new plates especially since we didn't have time for that so we just paid and left.",

Being were in Vegas and such a large number we had to Uber to the restaurant, so we all arrived within 10 mins of each other. The first 4 arrived and seated pretty quickly. Server greeted them in a very rude manner with \"what do you want to drink?\" No, \" Hi! Welcome to Sugar Factory. Can I get you started with something yo drink?\" Second set of our party arrived just a couple of minutes after the first and again no warm welcome! The last 4 of our group arrived and waited a good 15 mins before they were acknowledged. I understand it's difficult when a large party doesn't arrive at once, but this is Vegas and should be expected. Finally after about 25 mins the last group got drinks in. Orders were placed and I will say the food came out as ordered, but the quality of the food for its price is a huge disappointment. Best I can compare their quality of food to is McDonalds! Our dinner service continued with our server being continually rude to the group, so rude that one of the individuals in the group couldn't take it anymore, so they asked to talk to a manager. No much was done except we did see her pull the server aside and talk with him. You'd think that would make him step up his quality of service, right? Nope!!! The evening proceeded with continual poor service and our server being rude. After telling our server multiple times we were celebrating a 21st birthday he finally managed to get our daughters birthday dessert to her. I will mention the manager did have our server bring out the $60 birthday dessert, which was very impressive. We finish with dessert and had to flag down our server for our checks. This took a lot of time. Then we asked for separate checks and he said he'd be back to separate them. Instead he returns with 2 checks. 1 that did need to be separate but another with 4 other checks on it. When we asked why he didn't separate the checks his response in a rude tone was \"because I didn't know how it was gonna be split\" Our response was \"it's because you didn't ask!\" Then to top it off we got charged with the birthday dessert we never asked for! The server made us write down on a piece of paper who's check was who's! Seriously?! After we do it ourselves we decided to talk to another manager. He listened but honestly didn't seem to concerned. He did give our party 30% off each check and gave my daughter a $100 gift card to spend in their gift shop. The night took a total of 3 hrs for dinner service. Server rude, lazy, and incompetent. Our Sugar Factory days are over!   The entire meal should've been comp'd.....after all we complained to 2 different managers because our server WAS that bad! 30% off our bill and the $100 gift card to buy stuff in their store to promote them just wasn't enough. Big picture is we paid them to treat us poorly. Thanks Sugar Factory!",

We started by having one of the goblet cocktails whilst sat outside before our reservation,  the bar man was great really fun to chat with wish I could remember his name, he was from Bosnia though.   We moved inside for our meal, hubby had the NY strip and me a turkey burger, I also had the Lemon head martini which was very good.  Food wise it wasn't the best meal I'd ever had but not the worst either.  I wished I had room for one of the crazy sundies or milkshakes as I think that's probably where they shine.  Crissy our server was just lovely and we liked her a lot.",

I'ved lived in Vegas most my life and theyve changed location about 5 times but looks like it will stay at fashion show.  Prices are steeeeep. A goblet with alcohol is $40 and we could not even taste a hint of vodka in ours. My friend said her crepe was good and my $17 burger and fries were just average. Her crepe was pretty small and I actually think more expensive than my burger at $18. Service was friendly and fast. Again, come here purely for their milkshakes and desserts. Goblets are tasty but only worth it if you want a nice Instagram picture.",

My husband and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary and was hoping to have a fun night because we rarely have time for date nights between our busy schedules. I asked the hostess if we can go sit outside and she said yes and she would send a server out to us. We are very patient people but sat there for more than 30 minutes and no one even came to greet us. We almost walked out until my husband flagged down a server. We stuck it out to make the most of it because it was our anniversary but I don't think we will ever go back again because of the service alone.",

We ordered two of the goblets (price isn't on the menu but they were 80 dollars!) mine was terrible and I only took a few swigs out of it my wife's was good tho but not 40 dollars good. A lot of money for a drink that cost about 10 dollars to make at the most. Next we got two milkshakes that were completely different ones but tasted exactly the same just bland with no flavor. The server was very nice and came back and forth a lot and made sure to check on us that's the only reason I gave them two stars. I didn't try any food only drinks and sweets. Attempted to order a dessert but they said they no longer sold it. Two milk shakes two goblets was like 130-140 dollars. Same price as my multi course meal at Hell's Kitchen take my advice and just go to hells kitchen and not waste the money at this place",

I messaged sugar factory to ask of they had discounts for locals because my mother was coming for her birthday from California and i wanted to take her someplace fun! I received a message from Jennevive. She let me know about a 20% disc for locals and made my reservation for me on the spot. I asked what she recommended I should order for my mother for her birthday and she stated she would provide \"a little something\" for her on the house she was sure to enjoy. So sweet!! Well...... they did not disappoint!!! When we arrived we were greeted by our waiter Brandon M. Great service from the moment he said hello. The atmosphere was upbeat and beautiful. At least three different people who worked there asked us how everything was and made sure we were happy. I cant remember a time I received such good customer service and with a smile on every single one of them!  My daughter ordered the Dulce De Leche Milkshake. It was exactly how it looks in the menu and absolutely delicious. My mothers martini had her feeling happy and relaxed. The food was top notch. Not joking... the fries...Yummy!! My mom and i ordered salads. I know that was silly at a place like this but they were so good!!   Well when they came out with the \" little something\" for my mother......I couldn't believe my eyes!!!! The lights dimmed and at least ten people followed our waiter singing happy birthday to my mother. I didn't know who to record my mom that was brought to tears or the huge gathering that was singing. Brandon was holding the biggest bowl of ice cream with ice cream cones, whipped cream, so many toppings, candy and fireworks shooting out!! It was HUGE!!!!! The look on my mothers face says it all. I was so happy to see her this excited. She was like a kid on Christmas morning! This was not at all what I was expecting. They went over and beyond!! I truly am grateful to every single one of you at Sugar Factory for making this a memorable birthday experience for my mother. I wish i could go back and hug every single one of you...... Jennevive, thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart. That night meant so much to us.",

We are always looking for a kid friendly fun restaurant and we thought we found it until a bald loud mouth man came yelling as we were taking a picture  of my daughter and her cousin in the front the restaurant next to the yellow duck. He completely embarrassed the sweet hostess in the front as we let him know she gave us the ok to take the picture. Not knowing who was this loud mouth man yelling from a distance as We later found out it was the owners brother! The approach should have been totally different, perhaps some training when working with the public not just because you are the owners brother does it give anybody the right to speak to anyone the way he spoke to myself and my family. We will never be returning to this place! My 9 year old daughter and her cousin were shocked!",

    "text": "While visiting my day daughter, son-in-law & grandson a few weeks ago l had the opportunity to buy a Groupon for the Sugar Factory! The pictures of the deserts had fantastic presentation value. We all went there for a late lunch. The restaurant is beautiful on the inside with chandeliers on the ceiling. The ice cream shop is to the left when you enter. My daughter and I tried numerous samples of the many fun flavors there while we were waiting on our meal. We ordered the BBQ Chicken pizza and a Mac and Cheeseburger and Blue Cheeseburger with Fries. Overall the food quality of the burgers and fries was average in taste. I expected more from the Mac and Cheeseburger. The Mac and cheese while overflowing onto the plate looked and tasted like it came from a box. The BBQ Chicken pizza was my favorite food item. It had a nice tangy BBQ sauce and a delicious presentation. For desert we ordered the Brownie Bread pudding and the Chocolate Peanut Butter shake. The bread pudding came without brownies but this was quickly fixed by our server who provided friendly and attentive service the entire meal. The shake looked awesome with peanut  butter cups on top. It was thick and had the added tastes of marshmallow. The Sugar Factory is a little pricey but it is a great experience just to go there. Someday I want to return to try other menu items and the ice cream parlor.#yelpvg",

Server never brought a drink requested, billed for a $19 dollar milkshake that they ran out of and charged for the other milkshake that was ordered instead. When asking the person delivering food for something he said to ask waitress. It would have been nice if there were more than one servers in the restaurant to help, especially when there were only a few tables in use. We brought a cake for my daughter's birthday dinner. After the server suggested to add a $5 sparkler to the cake to add sparkle, she just brought the sparkler on a rice crispy and the cake was left on another table. We ended up taking the unused cake home to celebrate.",

However, I must say that once the food arrived, my family and I were disappointed to see the very small portion of the crepes we ordered. The worse part was not only the size of our servings, but the price of it. Every item on the menu was SUPER pricey, even for the smallest portions. I highly recommend that you shouldn't come here, especially when your on a budget. Overall, the food at The Sugar Factory is very disappointing, when you consider the price. Unfortunately, it's just a giant rip-off.",

We were looking for a nice hearty, delicious lunch after donating blood and this certainly was not the place for that.  Everything was quite pricy on the menu, but the pictures looked amazing so we figured it was worth it. I ordered the big cheesy and my husband ordered the farmer, we both asked for well done on the burger. When they came out, they looked fairly decent, but with one bite, that changed. They were a frozen burger patty with a lot of fake smoke chargrilled flavor, very reminiscent of Burger King. My burger had macaroni and cheese on top, it was simply some Stouffer's frozen macaroni and cheese. My burger was cold as was the macaroni and cheese. My husband's burger was still bloody inside.  One thing I can say is that the service from Betty was superior, but the food was definitely not worth the price.",

It was hard to hold a conversation with anyone..I wish it hadn't been 115 out or we would have sat outside where it was slightly quieter. I get that it is probably part of their ambiance. The service was meh....Nothing special.  She kept my water glass full.  The one thing that kind of turned me off was the use of profanity at the table by the server. There is a certain level of professionalism that should be maintained and I was a little put off by that.  Not that I am a prude by any means but those words shouldn't be used in conversations with your guests--especially when you have a young child at the table with you.",

The surprises didn't stop there, our server for the night had the best customer service, Dan. He took his time with everyone's order, gave us a special walk in the sugar factory backyard with the carousel and handled each goblet drink with care and of course surprised the birthday girl with a dessert. A regular 21st dinner turned into an exciting night thanks to Adrian and Dan amazing welcoming.",

Everyone was friendly and they really want you to have the best experience here.   Our waiter Dan, who was more than wonderful, took care of our big party and made sure every single person was satisfied and happy. Adrien, another worker, went the extra mile to make sure our experience was as memorable as possible. If it wasn't for these two we would not have been so happy. They even let us into the carousel to take pictures and gave us a cake and sang happy bday to our friend. Thank you Adrien and Dan for everything, you guys made this an unforgettable experience!",

It's very fancy but we waited almost 25+ to get water, then our waitress was VERY rude cutting off the little girls at the table and being snappy. By the way his name was Ricardo. He rushed us and then expecting a $20 tip even though he only interacted with us twice and both were rude interactions! The food was good but I wouldn't go there again unless I was guaranteed GOOD service!  It was my boyfriends moms birthday and I'm sure that ruined it for her. Thanks Sugar Factory!",

    "text": "I believe my sister was also doing a review but I wanted to do one as well. Only thing knocking this down to a four star was the wait process if you want to place that under poor management be my guest. Had a reservation for 8pm and arrived early and wasn't seated until 8:20 8:25. The hostess was visibly frantic and very apologetic as there was other tables with reservations also waiting. Our server was Menz and he was the best part of our experience beside the goblets and food. I'm one to casually observe my server when the restaurant seems busy. I noticed this young man was handling at least 4-5 tables, 2-3 of them being rather difficult tables of 8 or more from the looks of it that is. (I think a dance competition was in town) Nevertheless my small party of three was taken care of from beginning to end. Menz gave his drink recommendations and checked in to make sure we were okay. Sad to observe what I assume was the manager giving him a little talking to (hopefully nothing too bad as I just said this young man was handling multiple tables and large parties and on top of things). When my friends and I come back to Vegas and should we come to visit, I will be requesting his section. Now onto the food. The goblets were amazing! I had the white gummy and was very pleased. I had the buffalo wings and they were hot in all the right ways. I will say the wait time for food was a bit obnoxious but not Menz' fault so no blame there. My sister had the alfredo pasta with shrimp and ate every bite. I had the grilled cheese with tomato soup. My soup first came out with the bowl barely half full and cold. Menz happily and quickly took it back and brought me a filled hot serving. It was very delicious. We also shared the fondue and that too was yummy except for the brownies. Oddly didn't taste well with the milk chocolate. All in all if the wait periods for tables and food weren't too long I'd give this place a 5. Cheers to Menz for AMAZING service.",

Menu says 60 oz however the fishbowl where they serve it is full of ice. The steak that I ordered was very small and thin; cost for that was $29.  I have never been to a restaurant where they have   a fee for candle when they sing happy birthday to someone. I saw that on the bill for $5.",

    "text": "Visited your location in Las Vegas, NV Fashion Show Mall. I visited on 12/9/17. We were celebrating my friends 47th BD. Our waiter was named Chaz.  It was our first time experiencing the Sugar Factory. We asked our waiter a few general questions abt the signature  drinks in the goblet. For instance what did he recommend and how much. He  throughout a money amount of I think its 41.00 i'll be back. It took Chaz a long time to come back to the table. We had more questions abt more drinks and food. He answered as best as he could I guess. I'll be back. He disappeared once again leaving us hanging, he left us in total 3 times. In the interim we asked another waitress was he new because he appeared to be in a fog and didn't no what he was talking abt. She responded no he has been here quite sometime. We asked her how much were the goblet drink. She gave us a completely different amount. We asked the couple next to us who had Chaz also, how was he treating them with the service they were provided. They said he disappeared on them too and were waiting for him to come back to the table. He got their order wrong etc.  Upon arriving back to our table we asked him not to go anywhere, we were new to the experience, please don't disappear on us again and to be patient. When we proceeded to continue our questioning he would answer and talk to us like we were children and in a condenscending manner. There were what appeared to be 2 or 3 Managers standing around doing nothing but talking and laughing with one another. They were not walking around asking customers if everything is ok and do we need anything like good management do. May I add Chase was laughing and talking (sucking up) to them as well!!! Our experience was so awful it killed the rest of our evening. It was our last night in Vegas, we wanted to go out with a bang!!! And did we, we were so miserable when we left your establishnent we went back to the hotel and packed our luggage and went to sleep. We were to make one more stop but the experience sucked the life out of us. I had read all the negative reviews before going here, against my better judgement took a chance anyway. I see why all the negative reviews abt Management and some Employees. Instances like these will cause this location to suffer and eventually close down. I am surprised nothing hasn't been done abt it because of all the negative reviews on service, food etc. It needs a new vamping of mgmt, empl. I should had maybe tried the one in my hometown Illinois. By the way, we had drinks and food and it was a waste of money. Food mediocre not that good. And one of the drinks had to be sent back and replaced.  To date I have not heard from this establishment. I reported them to the BBB and they have not gotten an response as of jet. It's almost Feb. complaint was filed and reported incident to them Dec. Bad business from the top to the bottom.  REALLY!!!",

When I called the day before I was told that ladies night began at 9 pm. I was then informed by the bartender that ladies night was from 7-9 pm. Fine. We decided to still dine there for dinner. The server took forever, when he did finally come he got my order wrong. Then as we were leaving, a bartender yelled out \"have a good night\" but three out of the four of us were already out the door and the last girl barely heard what he said so she didn't respond. So in turn, he then yelled out \"fine, don't have a good night.\" Tonight was a joke and I would think twice about attending 'ladies night' at this establishment.",

    "text": "Took my boyfriend for his 30th birthday the other night. I wanted a special dinner for him since we were visiting from Phoenix and it was his special night. I have always noticed the fun goblets from sugar factory and decided that would be a fun experience for him. When we got to our seats our waiter was Chaz. Chaz was fine, decent waiter. Once we finished our dinners the wait staff comes out singing happy birthday to my boyfriend with a BIG sparkler on top of some ice cream, very cute display. Then I get the bill... $10 charge for the birthday dessert. What!!??? We were dumbfounded. Not once was I ever asked if I'd like to add that on or anything about a charge for the birthday dessert. ANY restaurant, even fancy steakhouses, don't ever charge for a birthday dessert. I first brought it up to Chaz and he said they do charge for it and it's not a mistake and he went to speak to his manager to see if they can take it off. He comes back and mentions his manager can take off $5, not cool. It's not about the money, it's about making your customers aware of your charges beforehand I ask to speak to the manager and he comes to our table. He mentions \"we are known for our birthdays\" ok... so if you are known for your birthdays then you'd think they would be included in the \"experience\". He was sort of fighting me on it back and forth and then just gave in and said he will adjust it off our bill. It should have been no questions asked, but instead he ruined our experience and my boyfriends birthday dinner (for me anyways because I wanted the greatest experience ever for him). Not cool sugar factory.",

    "text": "My first time visiting this establishment for a birthday party. There was a group of about 20 people. The server and the manger refused to split our bill amongst the multiple people in the group. After gratuity and tax, our bill was approximately $800. (They went back and gave us 10% military discount) When we asked the server, his explanation was that it was easier for him to just keep it all on one check. When we asked the manager, he would only say \"I'm sorry, we just can't\". Therefore, leaving us to figure out the bill, tax, and gratuity amongst 20+ people. AND on top of that, the drinks were weak, and my burger was absolutely terrible. There was no flavor and it was extremely dry. Save your money. It was overpriced and not worth it.",

I showed up early to check in and the staff had no clue where to seat us. After waiting by the hostess stand for 20 minutes, I reminded them that we had a reservation and they acted like I hadn't told them that from the beginning.   We got seated on the outdoor patio, which was quiet compared to the inside. Or at least it was until a DJ started playing right next to our booth. My girlfriend and I ordered chocolate fondue for 2 (which is $28) and it was served COLD. Our friends ordered one of their giant goblet drinks ($36) and it was served in a broken glass.   To top it all off, while we were still eating, our server told us the entire patio was now reserved for a private party and we would have to move inside. Unacceptable. We will never go back. We chose Sugar Factory for my girlfriends birthday dinner and they wouldn't even do anything special for her because of the private party taking over the patio. Avoid this place like the plague.",

    "text": "I was looking forward to having lunch at Sugar Factory this morning because I've waited since last year for them to finally open. From the reviews I knew beforehand that it was going to be pricey but I couldn't get my mind off of their Goblet drinks! Anyways, I was there earlier this morning for lunch and the service is what is giving the review two stars. Our server and the other workers around were very attentive and polite. The reason I'm knocking off 3 stars is because I found a hair in my ultimate veggie burger. The manager did speak to me and ask if I wanted anything else but after I basically ate half a stand of hair my appetite was gone. She apologized for the issue and we went on to get our bill from our server. We asked for a discount because of the hair and our server gave us 75% off of my burger. I personally thought my meal should have not been charged at all but I didn't want to speak to anyone and my sister was dealing with the check. Obviously I could have asked to get my meal removed from the check but I wanted to get out of there so I can't blame them for that. I probably won't be back because it was embarrassing and disgusting having to deal with that.     Also, the hair is on the side of the plate in the picture I provided because my sister pulled it out of the burger to make sure it wasn't any strand from the leafy greens that was inside.",

    "text": "Wow. What a mistake it was coming in here. I ignored all the warning signs and let my friends convince me to give this place a try. We were walking around looking for a place to eat lunch, and..  Warning Sign 1.. They have hype guys standing outside trying to get people to come in. They flash the menu and try to convince you they have amazing foods/drinks. We were kinda hesitant. But then he mentions a 2-for-1 appetizer deal. My friends were all about that, and I was out voted. So we went in. I had a bad feeling by that time. If you ever walk by a strip club that has hype guys outside, it's a clear sign the talent inside ain't so great. Same concept here with a restaurant. Read on.  Warning Sign 2.. We were seated. I flipped through the menu and noticed that the cocktails were very prominent, with lots of large and colorful pictures. The food.. not so much. They're listed in the back part of the menu. Hardly any pictures. Just generic descriptions and tourist prices. Also, we asked about the 2-for-1 appetizer deal. Our waiter kindly informs us that it's only valid if you buy a cocktail. Something the hype man outside neglected to tell us.  Warning Sign 3.. We were ready to order. Our waiter came over and tried to punch in our order on his handheld thing. But it wasn't working. He went off to grab another one and came back about 10 minutes later. But that one didn't work either. So he wrote down our order with pencil and pad. Lol.   Warning Sign 4.. Food took forever. The place was practically empty. So I'm not sure what the delay was. Maybe the staff was on their lunch break, eating at another restaurant?  And we finally got our food. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich. Oh boy, what I actually got was a big plate of disappointment. I could tell it was microwaved or precooked. Even though it was covered in buffalo/wing sauce, the breading looked obviously soggy as if it was sitting around for a while. Also, the menu says it was supposed to be on a brioche bun. It was served on plain old wheat bread like you get from the supermarket. And I really knew it wasn't fresh cooked because when I bit into it, it was warm. Not steaming hot like normal fried chicken sandwiches. The fries were the only thing that was good.   So after my underwhelming dining experience, I came to the conclusion that this is a bar masquerading as a restaurant. Based on the enormous and somewhat comically fruity drinks and desserts, the target demographic for this place is for 20-30 year old girls, for a \"girls night out\" type of thing. If you want real food, go elsewhere.",

    "text": "I used to LOVE the old Sugar Factory restaurant so I was extremely happy to see it had opened up in a new location. I ate here with my family on our first night in Las Vegas after a 8 hour drive. Worst decision ever. The service was good, but the food was awful. 3 of us ordered the white chocolate burgers, which used to be our absolute favorite. I cannot stress enough how awful this was. Every burger had white chocolate drizzled ON TOP OF THE BUN. No where on the menu description does it mention that. None of us could pick up our burgers, and I got so frustrated eating mine I took a few bites and gave up. How do you expect us to eat a burger with chocolate drizzled on top? Our hands were completely messy, ruining the whole experience. We also ordered the dark chocolate french toast which was repulsive. It was soggy and mushy.   On the last day of vacation, I decided to order a salad to go. It sounded really delicious and I decided to give it a second chance. HUGE MISTAKE. The garbage salad was literally what it sounds like - garbage. The meats were so dry and the lemon dressing had a thick consistency, almost of mayo. The lettuce was soggy and I couldnt take more than a few bites. What also upset me was I called in the salad at my hotel. By the time I got there 20 minutes later, my salad was still not ready. Heres the kicker, there was NO ONE in the restaurant. Literally. So tell me why it took 40 minutes to throw cheese and meat on a salad? Seriously? There were servers sitting around talking and doing nothing but ignoring me. I had to go interrupt a group of servers and ask them to go check on my salad.   Overall, I would not ever recommend this restaurant. It used to be my favorite but unfortunately I will never return here again. Horrible food, horrible staff, and overall it was a horrible decision giving this new place a chance!",

    "text": "Haaaay there. LONG time Sugar Factory fanatic here. Est 2011 when I wasn't of drinking age yet but dreamed of the day I could have a goblet. Being a SoCal native I frequented the location at the Paris Hotel often and my heart broke into a million pieces when I had seen that it closed down. Fast forward and here we are! You could not fathom my excitement as I heard this place was opening during a trip to the SF @ the miracle mile shops. Did not have as much time in Vegas this time around as I had hoped so I only got to visit once and it was a weekday. NOW with all that being let's get down to it.  Being a weekday it was not super busy but had a decent amount of people. We were seated immediately and given menus. I got my smoking goblet! (amazing) Seriously anyone whining about the price can get bent. You're paying for the brand, you get quality liquor, and great visual effects perfect for showing off to everyone on social media. DON'T COME TO VEGAS BROKE!?ANYWAY. My guy was happy you kept the pizza burger ( from the OG menu )  he loves it and talks about how he craves it and can't wait to go back. You axed my monte christo sandwich soooo I got savory crepes which were good. I couldn't really describe anyone here as friendly - maybe mildly pleasant? Our server was okay, nothing to write home about. He could have checked on us as we did have to flag him a couple times for refills. Unfortunately after the meal is where it really went downhill (please bare with me)   Being obsessed with all things Sugar Factory I wanted the whole experience and really missed the chocolate lounge. Our server informed us they had just opened for today and we were welcome to go up and we could order dessert upstairs. Well once up there the magic kind of died. It was empty (to be expected) and this blonde bartender gave us the evil eye (yikes) I felt horrible like I had walked into someone's house. I VERY nicely apologized for bothering her and asked if we could order dessert up here. She kind of huffed and said \"yeah it's fine but what they wouldn't give you dessert downstairs?\" Ughhh I felt so uncomfortable... I told her I wanted the full experience yada yada and took a menu. Menu is great and I really wanted to relive my 18th birthday during my first visit to SF years ago with my mom when we had the chocolate fondue. But we literally just sat here. For an hour. I'm not exaggerating I promise. If I wasn't so hell bent on holding onto \"the magic\" of this place we could've walked out. We both felt crappy to bother this clearly unhappy lady that had disappeared and left us up there alone. We had to chase after her a few times and she finally took our order. We waited about another 30 minutes after this. In the meantime we heard her talking with a coworker that came up saying that she was all alone AGAIN today and basically she was understaffed and outwardly very unhappy about whoever called out or whatever. I guess that's why she was so unhappy? Well the same waiter from downstairs brought our chocolate fondue out . The chocolate was lukewarm borderline cold (idk how that's even possible). I enjoyed it for the most part I mean chocolate is good no matter what I just wish it had been warmed at least? Well it was time to go . We payed and left and I'm happy I payed extra to keep my goblet .   *** IDK who took the time to read this but management/owner/ANYONE that has the power to do something***  Please listen to the reviews and find yourselves some solid workers who are professional and NICE. You guys NEED to restaff! And find more kids to hand out flyers?? There was some awkward dude y'all are paying to literally stand and walk in circles.. I guess he was supposed to be advertising ladies night but he was so uncomfortable trying to approach people that he just stood around.  I want to make it clear that I did NOT have a five star experience but I do NOT want to see this place fail. There is so much potential but you have GOT to improve in your service department. Atmosphere, cleanliness, price it's all good in the hood but your lackluster staff is KILLING you.",

    "text": "Just no. Very disappointing as I was hoping it would be decent. We went for breakfast.  We ask for coffee. They, currently, do not have regular coffee. The coffee machine is broken! They offer us free Americana espresso, yet I want regular coffee. Not good. We turn the offer down and just tell them that it's OK to be polite, but it's not OK. Then I found out, as my friend heard it, that after saying the espresso would be free, the waiter corrected himself and said it would cost the same as the coffee and not more. I order the egg white omelette with spinach.. it is simple... no cheese, with rye toast and BK potatoes. Healthy meal... so excited... the meal comes: The menu forgot to mention how bland the omelette is going to be. It also forgets to say that the joke is on me due to how much oil the omelette and the breakfast potatoes are clearly cooked in, as they are swimming in oil. It looks healthy... but it's not! I also ordered the rye toast... A bit chewy. So, what was the best part of the meal? It was the water. What made the whole experience that much worse is that we had a waiter that thought he was being funny but was actually very annoying ( sorry.. I feel bad writing about this but it's a fact). Neither my friend or I finished our meals. My friend ordered the American breakfast with two eggs and bacon, and not only was hers bland but she commented that she wished she had made her own breakfast at home this morning as she could easily make this and hers would've been 10 times better. The waiter actually said \"I bet you guys did not finish your meals because you want dessert\". Sugar factory may be known for sweets, but that is not what adults usually ask for when it comes to breakfast. It may be better for dinner or especially for strong drinks... I don't know... That is not my thing. I know that the top chefs make it very clear that if you are going to cook anything in your restaurant, it needs to be top notch. This restaurant miserably failed at breakfast. I do not plan on coming back for any meal at this restaurant.",

I ordered the white chocolate burger which sounds strange, but it was actually really good!  It's messy but it's the perfect hint of sweetness to the savory flavor of the well seasoned angus beef patty.  Their portions are gigantic!

A few of the things we experienced: -one of the slowest services in the Vegas strip. Service was so slow that while walking to the bathroom I witnessed a party simply walk away after saying they were waiting for 2 hours for their food. It took 50 minutes for our drinks to be delivered to our table. -the layout is awful. Servers have a hard time moving around between the tightly squeezed table, slowing down service even more. -room is uncomfortably hot. -bartender couldn't answer a simple question such as \"what kind of red wine do you have?\" -food quality was awful, high school cafeteria type of food.  The positive? The design makes this place seem kid friendly since it's all about candy and sweets, and the bar is decorated like a carousel.  Never coming back. No wonder their other location closed.",

Still waiting, now it's been forty plus minutes and our whole party goes inside to the same hostess and reports that the server still hasn't come to our table which she then exclaims \" which table are you ?

Less then 24 hours later, (I ate at the restaurant around 9-9:30 and I left around 10:30 and had to be at work 6 am) the bread has mold all over the sandwich. I called the restaurant to see if something could possibly be done, but the manager completely dismissed me, kept talking over me. It wouldn't had been an issue if the woman wasn't so rude to me and tried to blame my fridge. When I was at the restaurant everything was fine, my waiter and host was nice but that manager ruined the entire experience for me. She also said that it's flour from the bread, but literally there's no flour on half my sandwich and even if that's the case there's green fungus all over it. I'm very disappointed in how she handled the situation and she needs to work on her customer service skills.",

Also, I really liked the privacy and atmosphere in the top bar area and the bartender was friendly, lively and kind. He was actually a blast! I am coming back to bring my husband and friends the next time. Can't wait!",

    "text": "I came here with a large group of women for a Ladies Night upstairs in their Chocolate Lounge and the service was so bad I left in the middle of the party. The appetizers themselves were fine but the drinks could not have come out any slower if a snail delivered them! This event was not spontaneous, they knew at least a week ahead of time about our reservation but clearly they were not prepared with ingredients nor wait staff. Of course most of the ladies ordered the big candy goblet drinks which are time consuming but they made one at a time, carried up by elevator (which is shared with other serving staff). We saw one drink delivered to the table every 15-20 minutes on average and some people never got theirs. I got my lemon drop faster than others but felt guilty about drinking in front of friends who didn't have theirs. Rule #1 in restaurants, serve a girl her drank ASAP! Failure to follow this on a ladies night out will result in lots of unhappy women and no one wants that. On top of that, no prices are listed on the menu and when a couple of gals received a $50 charge for a dry ice drink, that soured the experience even more. They never seemed to apologize or even try to rush things. I won't be back.  Bottom line, they are slow, the drinks aren't worth the touristy prices (c'mon, it's sugar water plus candy and a shot of alcohol!). Don't waste your $$$.",

    "text": "Giving two stars because they did give us 1/2 off the bill and the manager was apologetic.   We had a reservation for a group of 8 people for a birthday dinner. We arrived at our scheduled time and were seated quickly. The place wasn't very busy but It took awhile for the waiter to get our drink order. He brought drinks a few at a time but didn't bring mine until I reminded him. Again he took some time to return for our food order. When we finally ordered, 5 of us ordered the chicken and waffles. About 20 minutes later the manager comes to our table saying they are out of chicken then says wait I'll be back. He comes back and says the actually do have enough chicken for our order and we were the last chicken & waffle order they could fill. Well.... our food finally comes out. The chicken and waffle plates should come with two pieces of friend chicken on the bone i.e. Breast and leg or thigh. Each of our plates had two wings, two chicken strips and a thigh. It was as if they used all the remaining chicken types they had left to make our plates. I personally don't like strips or thigh pieces. They didn't tell us this is how our orders would be filled or give us the option to change our order. So disappointing and not appetizing at all! After calling the manager over he did give us half off our total bill which was nice but at this point we've been here almost 2 hours and it's already after 9pm and those of us with the chicken and waffle orders now need to find something else to eat since we really didn't touch our food.   Seems the service and quality has declined since moving from the old location at the Paris. Unfortunately, we won't be back.",

When the drink arrived they took a couple of sips and said it was not worth the price which made me and my husband proud, it was a great lesson in life, $34 may of been too steep for this novelty drink/restaurant but the experience was priceless.

The restaurant was nearly empty (went on a Tuesday evening around 7) and I requested a more private booth area. He wouldn't let us sit there because it was only for parties of 5.... but the place was empty. It stayed fairly empty until we finished the meal and left. He could have sat me and my party at a circle booth and there still would have been plenty of seating for incoming guests. I mentioned on the reservation note that this was my birthday dinner and he didn't seem to care at all. I asked several times if we could just sit one table over and he was like no you can just move your tables here. Gave up after that. Didn't even bring out a dessert at the end. The table next to us had a birthday too and they got one. Best part of my dinner experience was the kind server, Pablo. He was open to answering all my questions about the menu and was super friendly. The menu here is vegetarian and vegan friendly. They have \"v\" next to all the items that can be veganized.  Overall the drinks and milkshakes here are worth it since they have nice presentation. Might be better to eat elsewhere and come here after for drinks and dessert.",

So I thought to myself \"how cool, it should be smooth sailing from here\". But I spoke too soon! We had our two daughters with us and ordered their food food first. When they brought our drinks out, we ordered our food. It took close to an hour (not exaggerating) to get their food out. By that time we were done with our complimentary water and drinks. Never got a refill on my iced tea, but that's besides the point. The rest of our food came out about 30 minutes after our kids' food came out. By this time my wife was a bit upset, she was so looking forward to this restaurant and it did not deliver. What I noticed is that it's more of a bar than a restaurant, because the people at the bar were taking care of customers much better than the wait staff serving food. It was a good thing i got a (Yelp check in discount and a groupon deal) otherwise i would be more upset in paying the high prices and the service doesn't match up to it. if you're looking for a good place to eat, pick somewhere else.

I was early and able to see them on the carpet but was told by the hosts outside that the restaurant was closed down and we weren't able to be seated, even though it was past our reservation time, which was included in the \"closed time\". One hostess kept saying \"I don't know what's going on\" to everyone that asked. I sat outside at Starbucks and watched fans taking photos with them right next to me, while I was supposed to be in there. Yes I'm bitter lol. One young woman was helpful (seemed to be the only host who knew things, took charge), she felt bad and found us our table inside, but just in time for them to leave. Well it sucks we weren't allowed into what we had reserved, but we're already here, might as well eat. The music was as loud as a club, and maybe 6 or 7 times that a song came on, was changed to another, like the music is hooked to someone's phone who keeps pressing skip. It was annoying at first but became hilarious when we started betting on how long a song would last. When in Vegas... So just when we're done laughing about that, the lights were dimming and going back up. Over and over. Ambiance, just kidding, bright. Tables nearby exchanged looks with us like \"what the hell is going on?\". The most unorganized place I have ever been. Our server's name was Rhea. She forgot about our table for about 20 minutes, TWICE, our appetizer came out at the same time as our meal, she did apologize for it being \"crazy\" and I can understand that, but eventually another man named Jason had to step in since she was so MIA and he was very helpful and quick on his feet. I wish I would have thought to tip him. I don't care who has an appearance, we will not be coming back here. It's not ok that I had a reservation but was held outside my event. I wish I could say the dining \"experience\" made up for it, or at least didn't make it worse. I don't write reviews unless I feel that a place really deserves a great one and I can compliment someone, or the exact opposite, so here we are. I cannot use another word to describe the Sugar Factory except simply ridiculous. At least we got a few laughs.",

We had no clue there was even a Sugar Factory in Las Vegas so we were excited to experience how the Vegas one was because we love the NYC One. Upon late arrival (we had to walk through a hotel lobby to reach the entrance), we told the Hostess that we called a few minutes that we were going to be running late and that we also had a reservation. She told us it would be a 20 minute wait & we can sit at the bar outside. Unfortunately,  it started to rain outside so we had to wait by the wall (the inside bar was full) during our wait. After about 15 Minutes, we were seated & given menus. We couldn't but notice the manager looked familiar to us. We later asked her if she was from the Meatpacking location & she confirmed she was the General Manager that followed with a warm conversation between us 3, she was very nice. We ordered our Steak & Eggs with Bottomless Mimosas which were all delicious, service amazing & can't beat the music and ambiance of the place. They also did a very good job with surprising me with Dessert for my Birthday! If you've never been to Sugar Factory, what are ya waiting for?",

It was annoying and loud so we were glad that it stopped. 10 minutes went by and the fire alarm started to go off again. After 30 minutes we received our food. Didn't know what was happening our server just said that there's a problem with the kitchen. At no time did a manager ever come out to the dining room to apologize or even let's us know what was happening. We ate out food as quick as we could so we could get out of the noise. When it was time to pay the system was down they had issues with the computers, don't know if it was due to the fire alarm issue. The couldn't even get me a receipt.

The food was delicious and this time the goblet we ordered had the right amount of liquor and didn't taste like just juice. Thank you for making our second time here a better one.  My group and I went here yesterday for our ladies night I was excited to go here since it was my first time and I had seen before that they have these cool drinks to chose from. When we got here we waited almost an hour maybe more to get seated which they kept giving us the run around. When we did get seated we were put in the back of the restaurant close to the kitchen, to be honest I think that table was pulled from outside and placed wherever since our group was becoming impatient from waiting for an hour they figure they just put us anywhere. When our waiter came to the table we ordered a watermelon goblet he said he would bring waters which we didn't get till 30 min later. For the price of that drink I would think it would have enough liquor but it tasted like juice instead. We pretty much didn't see our waiter since he was more concerned about a bigger party that he was taking care of. When he did come to the table we ordered another goblet, we sat and waited for almost 35 min and still no drink, by this time we were already disappointed with the service that the first waitress I saw I asked her to find our waiter and ask him to bring us the check. From the time we got in to the time we got our check we were in this restaurant for over 3 hrs 1/2! Super disappointed from this experience.",

A lovely hostess reached out to invite us in unaware that we had reservations. Reservation indeed, it was a full house and I know why! The music gave the vibe a fun happy atmosphere. We started with the delicious Bruschetta & I ordered the Rib Eye dinner and she ordered the Steak Frites. Both of our steaks came out exactly how we ordered them, \"medium rare\" it' was perfect. \"Our compliments to the Chef\" we told our sweet and attentive waitress Adrien. We had the pleasure of meeting 2 restaurant managers and yes they are involved and seemingly never fail to check on any and all of us patrons.  The rest of the staff we came in contact with were attentive and a pleasure to meet. We finished it of with the Turtle Cheese cake, oh WOW, a must have!!!  Upon our farewell we personally expressed our compliments and gratitude to the gentleman named Mike (1 of the 2 managers we met) and Adrien our server. Not realizing there was an upstairs Mike personally took us on an upstairs tour of the rest of this Amazing Candy Land where there were having ladies night every Thursday's (btw). Crazy exotic drinks of all kinds some with chocolate dipped glass rims, a strawberry fondu fountain to cotton candy and so much more. She'll be back with her girlfriends for ladies night and we'll be back for more exquisite food and fun! Two thumbs up!!",

    "text": "We went here for Mother's Day lunch. I went because I saw the drinks on Instagram and wanted to try them. The food was subpar to terrible. I ordered eggs Benedict and the yolk was broken and dried by the time It got to me. Also, I had four children and my husband with me. We did not get any silverware with our food and when they finally brought silverware they only brought four sets. I couldn't eat my food until I got some more because I gave the first sets to the children. Then, I had to get up and ask for more silverware even though we asked for extra sets when they brought the first ones. My point is that the food isn't good, the cheese on the burger looked like cheese wiz. And the service is HORRIBLE. But the drinks were fun. If you want to go for drinks with friends this place could be fun if you have zero expectations for customer service. But avoid the food, there are MUCH better places to eat in Vegas.",

But aside from that if you guys aren't coming for a special occasion this place will still make you happy. The plates are HUGE and the service is great, they were constantly asking us to go if we needed anything; they even asked one of my friends if she wanted a new drink when she didn't like the one she ordered.

They also didn't have a lot of things on the menu available and I signed the check and then realized they charged me almost 20$ more.   Update: 2 out of 3 of us got food poisoning.  And they charged me 20 over what I spent even tho they said they wouldn't.   I ended up disputing the extra 20 through my bank.  Edit: I got a message from the manager and in this message i responded to all 3 of us got ill but they wanted the full truth because in the previous review, I wrote 2 out of 3 got sick. I only said 2 because the 3rd person just had an upset stomach and I didn't want to be dramatic who got sick, so to be \"TRUTHFUL\" 2 of us had vomiting and diarrhea and the 3rd was just nauseous.  UPDATE: careful if you post an honest negative review. They will threaten you.",

I'm writing this review so nobody else has to endure the wretched experience at the sugar factory that I did.   I don't mind spending money on food, although their food is a bit overpriced it didn't bother me to spend the money. We went for a special occasion, ordered three meals. Not only where the meals missing every possible thing we asked for, but when we told the waiter, \"you know maybe we could at least get the bread for the meal\" Nevermind the missing pecans, burnt French toast , and the wrong protein on the fettuccini...  but maybe we could at least get the bread..nope too much to ask for, \"would you like to pay was the response.\" Ummm no I would like the correct meal, that would be nice. We paid..full price, which isn't the problem. The horrible meal, horrible service, and complete disregard for your customer is the problem.  I will be sure to tell my clients what a mess this place is when they are asking for recommendations, seeing as I work in the mall.   Do yourself a favor and go next door to Benihana ...they get client service!",

    "text": "Updated review:  After much hesitation that I would come back and waste my time again,  I decided to return and I have to say this time they delivered. Completely different experience than our last trip. We were greeted with a friendly smile and were sat right away. Food was good(came out in a timely manner), drinks were great! They even went out if their way to make me a drink that was on their online menu but not on the menu at the restaurant. Service was great as well( thank you, Nikki!).  Thank you Sugar Factory for making it right!  I can't even with this place! Hey get a 1 because I have no other choice. Where to start? my party and I arrive and are given a 10-15 minute wait time. Sit at the bar and order a margarita which seems like a complicated order for the bartenders. Get he margarita and I don't know what it was but it was not a margarita. Fine. Make some adjustments to it and still not a margarita but whatever. 40 minutes later still waiting and I approach the hostess stand and I'm told about 20 more minutes. Wait 20 more minutes, nothing. THIRTY more minutes and still not seated. Finally we get seated and it's not a booth as requested but a table that seems like it was pulled from outside and placed by the kitchen area. Our server comes to introduce himself,make small talk and we make a comment about the wait time. Even after all that, the service is TERRIBLE!! Order drinks,appetizer and entree and as you can guess..long wait time. Order a second drink which never comes until we ask another employee passing by to please get our waiter and get us our check.  He shows up with the second drink we ordered 30 minutes before. Unfortunately I had to send that back as by now I am fuming and ready to get the hell out of this place!  The check comes and it's incorrect. I get it's busy but that's no excuse for this type of service there are way too many other places I can spend my money!   Ps: the bathrooms are disgusting!!! Fail all the way around!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went to the sugar factory in the fashion show mall because they have a Groupon specific to that location, specificly for brunch. We went, wish we didn't. We had to park on the opposite side of the mall because the gates were locked by the Macy's and there was a convention so no parking near there. That's fine. By this time it's about 930am and we are standing outside of S.F., the doors were locked, someone inside flashes me 10 fingers, my assumption they open at 10, since there were no hours posted outside. However on the Groupon it says they open at 9am? I brought that to the servers attention when we finally do go inside. He said he told the manager, hopefully they will fix that sooner than later, especially since it wouldn't let me leave a review on Groupon since I waited to buy it, just to make sure the there wasn't any other specifics. Thank goodness, I would have been even more angry. Mind you I am feeling pretty hangry, walking around for 30 because they can't seem to post the right time on the promotional ad. Also the sever says \"we do open at 9 Sat.&sun.\" I said \"ok but the Groupon says only valid Mon.-fri.\" That makes sense thanks for clearing it up. Ok, I'm ready to eat, the Groupon says let your server know you are using a Groupon before ordering. Ok. Then tells us the only dish available for the Groupon is the on in the picture on Groupon although the highlight promote pancakes and waffles which is what I wanted. 2 eggs, 1 slice of French toast, country potaoes, and 2 pieces of meat was in the pic. Ok. I thought wow! The Groupon value is $60 and I'm paying $36 at 40% off. Oh and the Groupon is for specifically only for 2 people. If we did decide to order off the menu, what we wanted it would have been less than $60, hold less than $36! What was the deal breaker was we were going to settle for the breakfast in the picture, we were already there and starving, we told the server we don't eat meat if we could sub it for some toast or fruit. That was an issue, he said he has to ask the chef. Came back and said they just budget the Groupon for what's in the picture but we could sub for a cup of berries this time. Budget for what's in the picture?! $60 worth I guess wasn't enough for toast instead of meat. They really need to take that Groupon down, so frustrated!!",

    "text": "After the 4.5 hour drive back from the Grand Canyon and a little hungry, but not too much given that hiking and the sun had certainly sapped us of resolve......  I've been dreaming about the Bacon Cheeseburger shake since I first saw photos of it a few weeks ago and this was my chance, since I don't like to eat late and it was already 10:00 pm by the time we dumped the car.  Sugar Factory was open until 12:00 am so we ran over there as fast as we could.    They have set up shop in the newer Fashion Mall on the lower level and ever since Serendipity left the coveted Caesars storefront and other than HEXX, there was no place that screamed \"Vegas\" on the north end of the strip.  The interior is a fusion between Willy Wonka + Moulin Rouge + Steampunk, which means you will enjoy sitting there while the music pounds away in the background.  Sugar Factory takes everything know for the American classics, such as sandwiches, burgers, milkshakes, and drinks and optimizes them.  And when I say, optimize, I really mean bigger and brighter.  For example, they have drinks here but instead of a typical cup, the drinks here come in goblets.  These are goblets you need to hold with two hand cupped around it, mind you.  There are no small drinks here.  And the vibrant colors induce rather than repel.  There was a table next to us that ordered the drinks with liquid nitrogen for the dramatic effect.  In this case, I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger strawberry milkshake and a Caesar Salad because that was exactly what I was craving.  Others in the party ordered the Turkey Avo Club sandwich and others ordered just drinks and wings.  The milkshake was everything that I was expecting and more.  The mini burger was even good, but the strawberry milkshake was a typical milkshake, not too fancy or out of this world.  My Caesar salad was fresh and crisp, exactly what I wanted after spending the day out in the sun exploring.  Not too heavy.  The Turkey Club looked good but seemed a little dry.  IE., there wasn't enough avocado on it and same with the tomato and lettuce.  I'm usually use to seeing stuffed sandwiches but this one lacked the filler and it looked a bit airy.  Overall, however, my friend enjoyed his sandwich and the french fries were a lightly seasoned shoestring kind.  We kept nibbling on these throughout the course of our evening.  Bear in mind that in the later hours of the day, this hotspot caters to a lot of groups celebrating birthdays so I wouldn't recommend bringing your little kids in around the 10-11 pm hours.  The music is awesome/dance but NSfK (Not Suitable for Kids).  Our staff person was very attentive and checked in on us at various intervals, which we appreciated.  Overall, a great experience so I'll be back for a quick bite/dessert in the late hours of the day when everything is closing.",

    "text": "A complete 360 from my first experience.   We were seated right away and greeted as we walked in.   Our party started with four people, then moved to seven. Luckily we made it work and made more room in our booth for the extra people.  We all started with a round of drinks and one calamari appetizer.  Calamari was fried to perfection and very well seasoned.  For the first time I decided to try a different flavor in their signature Goblet's. Went for the Raspberry Watermelon mint Mojito and it was very refreshing. But my favorite is still their Lollipop Goblet.   For the entrees, we had the Steak Bearnaise, Fried Sea food platter, Chicken Satay and two orders of the Pacific Salmon.  I had the Salmon and it was definitely my favorite entree. The salmon was not over cooked, very well seasoned and the asparagus and capers made the whole dish come together. I highly recommend this entree if you're a fan of salmon.  Seafood platter was really good and it came with multiple sauces to dip in, or I am not sure if my boyfriend just order a variety of them on the side.  My best friend had the Steak Bearnaise and she devour it. I am going to take a wild guess and say she enjoyed it. LOL We wanted to do dessert but unfortunately our tummy's said \"no\". Probably was a good thing since we were drinking.   Over all, I am so glad I came back and gave them another chance. All my friends had so much fun and truly enjoyed their dining experience.  Our servers name was Jason and he was great. Very attentive, patient and polite.   FYI, this place is perfect for Birthdays, special occasions or just a fun night out.",

The decor is fun and inviting. We ordered a veggie omelet, the Big Cheesy, pasta, and the big Watermelon Patch, Voli vodka and rum designed and tasted by Pitbull. All the food was fabulous and a great place to have any type  celebration. It was a full house and filled with good music! I would definitely give this a try for first timers for some Strip fun. The service toward the end was slipping just to caution you in case you need to be somewhere, allow yourself enough time to get to your destination...if you tell them there's a birthday in your party!!

    "text": "My nearest and dearest know I'm always hunting cool & colorful places.   When they come across something visually appealing they haven't seen on my social media feeds, they'll tag me. Sometimes demand to know why I haven't been... appalled even.   That is how I came across this place a friend tagged me when she found out I was going to Vegas, then I started to google it and found out they were having a grand opening, a few weeks before we were scheduled to arrive.    Immediately made reservations for our first night there. Online reservation was easy, I didn't even have to print out anything we were on the list.  Day of: We were not going to make it timely, I tried calling to make them aware but was told to get there ASAP.  She didn't have time to go let their hostess know.  We were fashionably late. They were packed, large crowd in and out doors.  I gave my name and the look upon the hostess face. Priceless.   \"We mark you as a \"no show\" after ten minutes\"  *insert annoyed emoji*    Good news, I wasn't turned away, but we lost our table indoors. I was told THE Backstreet Boys were to make an appearance. They did, I have pictures and video, shaking hands and hugging. (worth the extra wait)  We waited about 30 minutes to be seated, which is not bad considering the crowd. It didn't feel long due to the hustle and bustle of standing directly in front of the celebrity dudes. *no longer boys*   They were going to seat us outside in front of the crowd, my girl friend was not having it. N.O. *they bicker* The hostess looks over at me and I say \"look, I know we were late, I am sorry, but I booked it because I saw the beautiful decor and the fancy drinks, we are not here because of the backstreet fellas.\" *insert pouty face*  She said \"I only have outdoor tables, let me take you upstairs\", we walk out of the restaurant, around the crowds, up the stairs, & up to security.....  My eyes and smile couldn't get any bigger. Started wiggling in my skirt doing my happy dance, \"Yes! This is what I want, no better place! Is this where we are sitting?\" *dancing, clapping, silly ear to ear grin*  The most beautiful \"willy wonka\" (not willy wonka but you get it) area I have seen in real life. It's so pretty!!! We sat in a gorgeous gazebo & the lighting was perfect. Yes, I am outdoorsy, like getting drunk on patios too! I was asked a million times by my friends are you okay? I had gone over my limit but I was in magic land.   We sat just on the other side of the Backstreet Boys, window between us, their waitress was our waitress.   She was slow, but because she was busy, and she made it up to us.  Service, although slow, was great! She was a sweetheart. Appetizers, Steak, & Goblets on point. If you have anything here it has to be a Goblet. Just for fun!",

My son enjoyed his donut hamburger (but he's 16 and eats everything). I shared the cheese monster burger but the macaroni was not the best. The goblets are $40 each which is a little expensive for the actual amount of drink you get. But the dry ice effect is pretty cool!!!!! And the shakes are huge and very tasty!! Probably not a place I would frequent but definitely worth going at least once.",

As a teenager there aren't too many extravagant experiences, which are an integral aspect of a vacation to Las Vegas, but Sugar Factory really nails the 'over the top' Vegas theme - for ALL ages.   One of the greatest things about this place is that you can eat an entire dinner or come for an 'instagram-worthy' desert. The menu is 18 PAGES, which means everybody in the family can throughly enjoy their dining experience.   Along with quality eats, you will get quality posts. With the setup practically designed for photo-ops, if you're looking for a colorful post to social media, then this is the place for you!   I would definitely recommend this place to EVERY single one of my friends!! So you should come give this place a try and have the stereotypical 'kid in a candy store' experience!",

    "text": "After all the celebrity hype over the years, what better time than a bestie girl's trip to try out Sugar Factory for weekday Brunch.  The location itself is eye-candy from the outside in. The top level includes a lawn area of white tulip-esque flowers, rather reminiscent of marshmallows, alongside a huge rubber ducky, cupcake and lollipop statues. Inside, the place has a sort of candystore/ice cream parlor vibe with lots of black, white and red. Chandeliers hung practically everywhere.  I had made reservations on OpenTable beforehand, although upon arrival, I realized that it was unnecessary. We were seated immediately and chose to sit by the window facing the strip.  The menu here was no joke at 46 pages. I would say half those pages were used just to detail the elaborate goblets and drinks. At $40 per goblet, these babies are not for people on a budget. But seeing as we were here celebrating my bestie's bday, we decided to go all out and split one. We decided to take the waitresses recommendation and ordered a Watermelon Patch. A waiter brought us our drink when it was ready, the liquid inside a shaker and the goblet empty with just ice, dry ice and watermelon candies. As he approached he says to us \"Would you like me to wait as you take your phones out and record? Now is when I'm about to pour, which makes a good Instagram\" This was hilarious! I mean, he was right, but I had just never heard a waiter straight say that before, definitely gave us a good laugh.  The drink itself was pretty good, sweet and actually decently strong. Tasted exactly like a watermelon sour patch kid and omg the huge watermelon gummy sliced that came around the rim were FREAKING AMAZING!! Best watermelon gummy I ever had, for sure!  Part of the reason why I chose this place for brunch is because its one of the only places on the strip that offers a weekday brunch menu. We were both in the mood for benedicts, so decided on the Sugar Factory Benedict x2.  The wait time from ordering until the food was in front of us was decent. The plate itself overall, was a bit underwhelming. I will say that I really enjoyed the fact that they layer a nice crispy hashbrown in it, and the asparagus was also a nice touch, though they were a little overcooked. Thankfully, the eggs were nicely poached, delicate and jiggly, with a nice yolk-y center. Hollandaise could have been a bit more punchy when it came to the lemon flavor, but was silky and coated the eggs nicely. The english muffin underneath was completely limp and not toasted, too bad because that little touch would have made such a big difference!  Although the experience here wasn't terrible, it also wasn't that great. The food and drink is pricey for less than desirable quality. In the end, the price point reflects \"Wow-Factor\" more than taste. If you're hellbent on trying this place, by all means do so. You won't be 100% disappointed but also no guarantee that you'll be 100% satisfied. Only time will tell if I give Sugar Factory my vacation time again.",

    "text": "Just got out of a show and wanted to grab a bite to eat so we headed off to the Sugar Factory, another place we had to check out while in Las Vegas.  It was a quick walk from Treasure Island to the Sugar Factory in Fashion Mall, the Sugar Factory is super cute on the inside, pink, black, white lush and sticky sweet.  Since Valentine weekend was coming they had a special Goblet going, it was Bubby Kisses Goblet, it was Brut Champagne, strawberry rum, strawberry liquor, grenadine, fresh strawberries and gummy kisses. That's what my friend ordered, and I got to try it, man was this a great tasting drink and it was fun watching it be poured with the dry ice and smoke.   I went with martini's that night, started off with a Caramel Macchiato Martini, it was an espresso martini with caramel and chocolate swirled in the glass and fresh creamy whipped caramel vanilla foam, perfectly sweet. Then I went for a Chocolate Mudslide Martini, it was vodka, Kahlua, baileys Irish cream with chocolate drizzle & chocolate rim and dark chocolate shavings, oh hunny this one is dangerous, this is a grown-up version of chocolate milk, so smooth you don't know what hit ya till you stand up. Give me more!  After checking out the menu I went with a Grilled Chicken Breast Sandwich which slow roasted chicken, swiss cheese, avocado, romaine lettuce, sliced tomatoes herb mayo on a toasted French baguette with French fries. The toasted bread, the avocado, tender chicken, so dang good! And the fries were delish too!  Sugar Factory lived up to the hype, this is a fun spot to eat and people watch. I'm sure I will be back.",

It's a bit pricey, but I do feel like the experience is worth it if you've got a little money to splurge with. My friend really wanted to try them out because I told her about my experience at the Miami location. She was so excited to try a goblet drink. We ended up getting the watermelon one and it was honestly pretty good. I'm not a drinker at all, but I really enjoyed it.   We both ordered burgers. I'd say it was a pretty good sized burger served with a side of fries. I wasn't really up for too many sweets, but they do have a candy store in the front for some extra sweets! We went on a Thursday night and there were lots of parties there so I was expecting slow service. It ended up not being bad at all.  As a bonus, I got an offer for free avocado toast with entree purchase when I checked in on Yelp. I didn't redeem it, but I thought it was nice to have.",

The server brings the glass without any liquid than pours it in front of you and the drink begins oozing gas everywhere pretty cool.  We ordered the watermelon raspberry mojito.  The drink was outstanding and refreshing, all of the candy went well with the theme of the drink, would definitely order these again even at $39 very much worth it.

The pasta was good, I think they did go a little too heavy on the wine though. The burger was alright, sweet and savory isn't my thing so I didn't enjoy it as much. We did get the watermelon mojito goblet and it was very sweet. Then we ordered a king kong sundae for my birthday.   The sundae was great! There was so many layers to it and the ice cream was surprisingly very good! We killed a good 60% of the sundae. This time around, the food was definitely better. The server was alright though....he was very slow at responding and wasn't tentative. There were times where we had to really wave him down. The bartender was great though! He would come by and check on us multiple times. I wish he was our server. Overall, my friends and I really enjoyed ourselves and the food.",

    "text": "I was trying to live up to the hype because so many people I've know or celebrities have been here and I couldn't understand why it was so great. VERY expensive, and A LOT of sugar... had me leaving feeling a little qweezy if you ask me.   My friends and I stopped by here on our last day in Vegas to try it out before our flight took off. The place is definitely very cute, old school diner/modern kind of a theme. We didn't try the food, but decided to get the huge sugar bowl drinks without the alcohol.   I don't remember ever seeing any prices on the menu when the waiter handed it over. It was honestly a mistake from my end for not asking, but I guess a part of me though \"there's no way it could be that expensive\". The drinks are definitely aesthetically pleasing, but after learning that they were about $30-$35 each WITHOUT alcohol, I felt a little ripped off. I can't imagine how much it would've been if it was with alcohol because our bill totaled about $70-$75 NOT even included tip yet.     If you're curious to see what this place is all about, please let this review save you the time and money and go somewhere else! There are many delicious places throughout the strip that cost 80% less than this place & definitely doesn't fill you up with straight sugar.",

We ordered buffalo wings, Sugar Factory Signature burger, buttermilk onion rings, sampler platter, fish and chips, blue cheese bacon burger. My son also enjoyed his ocean blue goblet.   The onion rings are amazing, just wish the portion size was larger. The burgers were great but fries didn't seem as fresh. Our daughter loved her fish and chips, it was the right amount of food. Our sons are a big fan of the buffalo wings. Next time I will just order dessert since it always looks so good.  Overall, since the kids love the atmosphere and the food, we will be back.",

    "text": "At the mall needed food. Ive never ate here before and decided it was time as I had heard wonderful things.   We came in and at first we were seated at a little table under dank lighting. We asked to be moved to a larger table as we had a bags with us. We were able to move. During this time we were given the standard water.   Our waiter came by asked if we had been helped, I said no not at all. So he explains why we haven't been helped,  then takes our order. When you check in on Yelp they give an appreciation Bruschetta. I show the waiter this, he asks to take my phone to his manager so it can be taken off. I was hesitant at first to just pass my phone over.   Our food arrives with the Bruschetta at the same time, not separate how a appetizer would be. I thought this was odd. We ordered the club, the grilled cheese.  Nothing else. We were never even asked if we wanted anything to drink. So I just watched. At this point Im irritated as the food isn't cheap. Not extremely expensive but still.   Finally after eating, I ask the waiter for the check and boxes. He asks do we want dessert. So I asked him why didn't he ask if we wanted something to drink. His reply \" I saw you had water so I thought that's all you wanted\" I responded, I would have spent good money on drinks in here, but you never asked. I stated I always drink hot tea with all my meals. SMH  I give him my card to run, thinking this tab was a little high. Then I look at the receipt, they still charged me for the Bruschetta. I point this out, he takes it to the manager comes back with a new receipt, stating it is a new manager and that is why I got charged for it. ( they took my phone in the beginning of this )  I came in here because I thought it was going to be a better experience than it was. I don't think I will return. This was a big disappointment, as everyone brags about this place.  Location is at Fashion Show Mall 15/ Spring Mountain.  Ample parking.",

    "text": "This was a huge disappointment! My daughter has been wanting to come here for 2 years to get the huge goblet drink. We ordered the Lollipop Goblet, one of their most popular, and the waitress said sorry we are out of those, so we ordered the Watermelon Patch and asked if we could get the lollipops in that one since they were out of the drink, sure for another $8.00. This drink was completely full of dry ice and hardly any alcohol,  it had so much ice we could barely get our straws in it. It ended up costing us $46.00! Now we ordered the Rainbow Sliders and a salad for lunch, the sliders cost $24.00 and the salad was $19.00 with hardly anything on it. The sliders were barely warm and had no taste. Since we drove 3 hours to come here we wanted to have dessert of course! We got a sundae the triple chocolate one, now I have to say it was wonderful but not worth $16.00!  Now we had assumed for $46.00 a drink you would get to keep the glass, wrong!! The glass was an extra $15.00, so since this was her #1 reason for wanting to come here I bought her the glass. When I asked the waitress if we could get a clean one since this was still full of dry ice and candy she said no, it will be an extra $10.00. I about flipped out at this point, I said surely you can dump out the glass because we can't take it like this, and she said well I  don't so, I told her to go find out that there should be no reason they can't do that. She then came back with a clean one.  The waitress was not attentive to us at all, first of all the presentation of pouring the drink is a big deal, and I had gone to the restroom quickly, when I returned she had already poured it, she couldn't wait 1 minute for me to return and there was only 1 other table with people in there. She never came by and asked it we needed condiments or water the whole time we were there. Now to top it all off when we left a girl was sitting at the outside bar drinking a Lollipop Goblet!! So they were not out of them!! This small lunch venture costs us $150.00. I will never go back it is a huge rip off!!",

I took my seven year old nephew and luckily he liked the the thirty dollar candy drink he had. Bad bad bad experience.  Was contacted by management to atone for their subpar performance and when I reached out to bring my mom I was never contacted again. Wow! Lived in town for 15 years was a concierge for7 years.

Credit to the manager for comping the entire meal but the sloooooow service is inexcusable when they had 10 tables full and 20 people on staff. Love their drinks but their food is not Vegas quality.",

    "text": "My friends and I decided to see what the \"hype\" was all about and go ahead and make reservations at the Sugar Factory. After you get over the initial shock of their $40 drinks (it IS Vegas after all) the prices of their food were pretty much what was expected and the drinks though pricy are good. I ordered the turkey burger which was surprisingly moist and delicious. However, the fries weren't all that great. One friend ordered the Caesar salad which noted as being good and another friend ordered the quesadillas and returned them because they were very bland and got the shrimp Caesar salad and also enjoyed it. This occasion was also my birthday and the server noted my pretty \"birthday girl\" sash and explained the birthday packages and I pretty much said something on the lines that, \"I don't pay money to have someone sing happy birthday in a restaurant\". So in short, no fancy music, ice cream or servers singing, \"happy birthday\".  The hype of the Sugar Factory is at best overrated but may be worth the stop if you gotta say, \"I've been there in Vegas\".",

    "text": "Let me just start my post by saying myself as well as my family are all in the industry so we totally understand \"busy service\" however on this particular night there wasn't more than 10 tables in the entire restaurant.   My family came in for my sisters 16th birthday as it was her choice of restaurant. After being seated the server came over about 10 minutes later (not terrible considering we sat with an incomplete party) and brought water and about 10 minutes later returned to take a drink order. Before us ordering he never informed us on what they were out of so every time we tried to order something he would say \"o sorry were out of that\" it got to the point where we were asking \"what do you have\" once we gave him our drink order we informed the server who appeared to be for sure high and possibly drunk that we were ready to order our food as well. It wasn't for over 45 minutes that we then received part of our drinks. We originally ordered 2 goblet drinks both non alcoholic, one milkshake, two glasses of wine, and an iced tea. When the drinks arrived he only brought the two goblets one of which did have alcohol so that had to go back and he forgot the other drinks. After waiting 45 minutes for the wrong drinks and not even getting them all we spoke to the manager. A blonde woman very professional and courteous she assured us that we would be getting the rest of our drinks shortly. Then to come find out they didn't even have the wine we ordered so we had to change our wine order twice because all they had was Chardonnay. Once the drinks were resolved we questioned when the food would be out because at this point we had been waiting almost an hour and a half since ordering. Mind you WE NEVER SAW OUR SERVER AFTER HE TRIED BRINGING US THE WRONG DRINKS. AT THIS POINT IT WAS ONLY THE MANAGER TAKING CARE OF US. When the food came, they brought two additional entrees we did not order so they took them back to the kitchen. I originally requested for my sandwich to be made plain and it did not come plain but I feared saying anything in the case it may take another hour and a half to receive a new one. There was a puddle in front of the women's restroom that I personally had slipped on with no wet floor sign. HELLO !!! Are you asking for a lawsuit ??? To top it off we saw our so called \"server\" trying to grab the managers butt while on the dining room floor how ridiculous can you be? They tried to make it better by bringing us the King Kong sundae which was a very nice gesture however the awful service for the two plus prior hours was not forgiven. Not to mention those two extra meals we were brought that we did not take we're on our bill. 9 people eating with 11 entrees come on really ? I'm not sure if it was a lack of training with the staff or just overall carelessness but it was definitely an experience to remember and not in a positive way and as a local I will not be returning nor will I recommend people to come here.",

My fiance and I ordered the goblet drinks with the coupon that said 2 for 1. We saved a lot of money because the goblet cost about $36? The experience is amazing though. You see everyone recording when they get the drinks. Yummy candies inside and one drink does you good! The desserts are amazing as well, but if you come for food, I'm not sure how much you can eat the dessert! The food comes in good quantity. The spinach and artichoke dip was my favorite appetizer along with the chicken wings. Shoutout to the waiter Chase, who was really kind and gave the best serve in Las Vegas to us! Definitely recommend this place. It is a rememberable treat ;)",

We had purchased Groupons to help off set the cost of the $19 milkshakes, etc. Upon being seated we notified the server of our plans, I feel it's courteous to address it at the beginning. Our server immediately lashed out at the idea of us using more than one per table. Apparently that is a rule of the fine print, which he ran back to prove with their laminated copy, laminated- which tells me this is a recurring issue. He refused to accommodate us in anyway. Not even moving to two tables - \"we all walked in together so we are set as a group.\"  Following even misguided rules is fine and had the server, or any of the staff we spoke with, addressed the issue with the slightest compassion for the inconvenience or miss understanding, we would have happily stayed. I am still appalled at the lack of costumer service.  Instead we left and it became a good learning experience for our children to see that you don't spend your money at rude, disrespectful establishments. If they are so against using Groupons, they shouldn't offer one.",

DON'T EXPECT patience, eye contact, a smile, a refill on your water, to keep your menu without receiving an eye-rolling, or to keep your plate until finished. DO EXPECT a mild tug-a-war with that plate you weren't finished with, borderline attitude, to see more staff than patrons cheerfully conversing in an alcove while the floor remains practically void of staff, & your bill thrust in front of you under the watching/waiting eye of said waiter who says, \"You can add your tip in here\". I've given 2 stars due to a hip club-like environment, & trendy but decent/varied food choices (great salmon benedict), with some uniquely tantalizing desserts (yummy & plentiful cookie jar sundae) & huge, smoking dry-ice libations. I gave this establishment another chance after a year ago when my daughter had one of those libations explode all over a new shirt. This was met by a waiter who disappeared & never came back, & a manager who, when notified, could've cared less & didn't even offer to adjust the bill or pay for the cleaning bill. Maybe Management's attitude is responsible for the way staff present themselves. 3rd visit won't be charm because I'm not going back.",

The goblet drinks were \"ah\" worthy and tasty but way over priced at $34 each with no alcohol and you do not get to keep the goblet. The fact that no price is listed on the menu should have been a clue.  The food was not good and was expensive for the quality. The fried fish for my tacos were not seasoned.  The alfredo with shrimp was bland. The hamburger was not cooked to specifications and was greasy. Although the server was nice, she seemed overworked. It took longer than expected to get food, to get the tab, and she only checked on us once. I would have rather spent the $140 elsewhere. I can't recommend this place and will not return.

Third time I came here and tonight for my birthday. 1st time around grand opening had a reservation for Valentines day and they neglected to call and say they were not opening on time, we showed up and had no where to eat on Valentines day- I wrote to restaurant on FB i think or company site got no response. 2nd time decided to try the place for my sisters birthday about a year later, it was terrible. Food was gross sent back a couple things (waitress even said meat looked terrible) the \"fried\" ice cream my bf ordered was soup and disgusting. Our waitress gave us a 50% off food card for our next time she told us they may have had an off night and to try again. So here we are my birthday. Came with some friends ate, had the kind kong sundae. Our friends gifted us a groupon we used for 2 duck drinks, at the end of the meal were told we cannot use the groupon with the 50% and we cannot use the groupon on a separate check (in a group couldnt split the check I am pretty sure they could but ok probably just wanted auto gratuity cause I definitely would not have tipped)  Waiter said he told us that in advance and no he did not. So we ended up paying an additional $65 for drinks that were gifted to us and now we return the groupon to her? LOL because no def not coming back to get them another day. I am sure there was a much better way to handle it in the view of customer service. 3 times now and each time was a terrible experience, oh not to mention a goblet is $35 even with no alcohol that is ridiculous but side note and not fully part of the issue. I used to love this place when it was at Paris even Town Square was better than this. Also your menu online for fashion show doesn't really exist in restaurant (also part of 2nd visit). Terrible choice for my birthday dinner. thx",

The management staff was present and on top of things, the service was as incredible as the awesome milkshakes. I use to think that the Sugar Factory only had good desserts. Now, I know the food is just as good too!!   Thanks SF staff for making my birthday memorable!!",

From our great server DJ who was so personable and we could tell he loved his job.  To the manager and louis \"the fixer\" who turned an unfortunate spillage incident into a very great experience at this restaurant.  I was unfortunate to have hot sauce spilled on me and even in my hair, complete accident,  it happens.  The entire staff was so nice and apologetic.  They made sure we had everything we needed and more. Offered to cover any dry cleaning costs, made sure we got back to our hotel without issue, covered our meals. Many might think this was a no brainer to do but I've had really bad experiences in other restaurants and sometimes you barely get an apology.  You can tell they want their customers to be happy. Goblets large enough to share with 2. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich that was delicious.   Food, drinks,  customer service,  and even the music, all 5 stars.  Would definitely go back.",

I even took the time to let the waitress know that the service was bad and all she did was agree with me ! So not call for a manager or nothing. We paid our bill and will never be returning.

First off took around 15 minutes (after we were seated) for the host to find out who was serving our table then another 10 just for Jason to get to the table.   Yadioa one of the bussers walked passed our table several times without checking in on us clearing dirty dishes refilling our water glasses, Christopher on the other hand helped us a lot, there was one kid don't remember his name either that dropped off stuff at our table 4 times through out the night that wasn't ours but for a different table, when the food finally came out after sitting for an hour and half the food runner just started auctioning off all the food to the table and even had food for a different table with them they tried to give us. then our server Jason only came to the table to take drink orders food orders and desert orders and that's all never came to check how the food was or any of the drink witch was afoul we had the red velvet, raspberry sin, sour apple, and s'mores. Every drink was way to over powering of alcohol and no flavor to them, Or just straight out gross. The food wasn't that bad but if i wasn't that hungry tonight i would have sent it all back. After all that tonight this place is a good place to go to if you have a sweet tooth and want to be ignored or spend along time waiting for your food or any drinks.",

    "text": "Omg where to begin!!!!! While visiting vegas this past weekend i decided to stop here and check this place out. It seems pretty popular and well known. The ambiance has an upbeat diner feel. I ordered some sliders to start and it took forever for them to come out i knew it had been sitting on the food line because it was almost as cold as ice when we received them!  Before putting in our order for the sliders we requested that the sliders would be light on the salt the server then says SHE DOESN'T MAKE THE FOOD i was in complete shock for hearing such a rude comment i was so frustrated. i have been working in the industry for years and would never say that snarky to a guest and obviously it is your job to tell the kitchen our requests that is essentially what a server does? Anyway, i ordered the country fried chicken and it was a nightmare the chicken was greasy and burnt! Probably from being on the food line for so long or the cooks must have really had a long night. I don't recommend this place at all unless you're drinking. This is more of a I'm too drunk to care what I'm putting in my body type of place or maybe if you have a sweet tooth otherwise 0.5 stars.",

That's when the hostess asked if we wanted to sit upstairs in the chocolate lounge. Sure. Once upstairs and got settled in. We ordered our drinks. Then we ordered our food. Sitting for 30min we still have NOT received our drinks we ordered. Our drinks FINALLY came as well as only half of our tables food order. The rest of us sat for several more minutes until a couple more of our dishes came out. At this point we were waiting on 2 steak entrees for the last food to come out (steak bordelaise and steak bearnaise). It came totally wrong!!! My friend ordered hers med-well and my BF ordered his med-rare. Their steaks were mixed up on each others plates. And to top it off, they gave mushrooms (in a plastic container) instead of caramelized onions on what was supposed to be my BF Steak Bordaise. The server did not seem to care and blamed the kitchen staff on their mistake. We had to ASK for the carmelized onions!! Obviously, it's her job to make sure the food she's delivering is the right order. A friend ordered the alfredo and it came out like a kids meal size. Wth. We also did not receive an appetizer until after our dinner. The busser kept coming around trying to clear off plates that we were still working on, seeming like they were trying to hurry our meal and get us out. They also won't split checks for you.  I really wanted to come here to celebrate my birthday with friends and try their desserts but after the terrible service We just skipped dessert to get out of there.  So bummed this place could've been fun.   This place is 1)overpriced for the quality you're getting 2) terrible service, server will Just pass the blame to others and won't offer to Fix it nor apologize.",

The decor is gorgeous and fun, reminds me of some of the bakery shops in Paris. The big bowl drink I got here is $38 without tax and tip, including with tax and tip I spent about $10. Total $48 for this drink. It was really good and def a fun experience buuuuut it's def my last because it is not worth $48 to me. You could go on Groupon to help with the price. I found a coupon for $24 and you get a $40 certificate which could help a lot. I haven't tried their food or shakes which I'll be coming back again because it looks delicious as well!

The portions are pretty big where I suggest you can share. I ordered a ham and egg breakfast sandwich that came with a ton of yummy fries. I only ate half because, the portions of fries were pretty fantastic! I did like the food but, not my drink.   Sadly, you come here because, of the pretty drinks. That's what they're known for and the candy. Well, I ordered the \"Watermelon\" and they had no watermelon gummy wedges for the rim of the cup and the mini ones in the inside. I know you're thinking, \"Who Cares!\" Yet, it's not so much that but, HOW they handled it! I was pretty bothered by it. The bar tender instantly had made the decision to make our drink and add these horrible \"coconut wedges\" gummies that tasted old. Then he threw in some old sour patch gummies. When the waiter came he said, they ran out of supplies and that the bartender gave us another set of gummies. Like, really? Just like that? Geee, thanks! That's not what we ordered. The situation could have been handled a bit different. Like, \"Hi, I'm sorry we don't have the gummies for that drink. However, what other drink on the menu would you like? Or did you still want this with different gummies?\" I mean the guest are paying $40 for the drink. I'm I wrong for thinking this? Also, at the restaurant YOU DO NOT KEEP THE CUP!!! There's no disclosure and the waiter does not tell you! At the Planet Hollywood Hotel-Mall Area you're allowed to keep the cup and you pay $30 for the drink. I honestly, don't think I'll be back. Even though the food was good-I was disappointed in the drink experience! I JUST WANT MY CUP!   Lastly, I noticed they keep on eye on everyone. Ensuring no one walks out with out paying. I guess this happens a lot here. The hostess could be a little more chipper and pleasant! The restaurant is soooo EXTRA and pretty! I would think they would find a personality that would match it! The waiter matched the ambience and I wondered why everyone else wasn't like him. Pssst, like our bartender who made are drink!  Don't forget to CHECK-IN to get your free appetizer! USE YELP. Let them know what you think so, they can do better! That's honestly good. So, if you come you're probably better of getting a shake here not the alcoholic drinks. There over priced, don't let you keep the cup, and don't make them correctly!",

The decor is like an old ice cream parlor meets modern luxury.  To start I had one of their famous smoking goblets. I had the watermelon mojito. The goblets are very large at 60 ounces and are shareable. My goblet was yummy and continued smoking for about 30 minutes, when I finally finished it.  The food menu is pretty large and includes brunch, lunch, and dinner. I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup. It was good.  Lastly we could not leave without trying dessert. We got the snickers milkshake which was obnoxiously large and came in a candy coated glass. Again, easily shareable. It was delicious and I slipped into a sugar coma the rest of the afternoon.",

    "text": "This was our first time visiting this restaurant. Our family came her recently on a weekend trip to Vegas. First, we couldn't find it easily, but finally found the top floor after walking through the mall. We made reservations and I think we planned to dine in the 1st floor, but since we were running late and couldn't find the first floor entrance from the mall, we were just glad to find it when we did on the 2nd floor.   Anyway, after reviewing the menu book (yes, it's a book), our group of 7 (adults/kids) finally decided on drinks and food: Sliders, chicken Alfredo pasta, and two burgers were ordered, as well as a watermelon goblet drink (reminded me of otter pops), a couple beers, a mint chocolate martini, and chocolate milkshake. It wasn't until after we ordered that I checked in on Yelp and realized we got a free avocado toast. I asked the waitress and she obliged, only to return to tell us they were out of it. I thought it was odd, but didn't want to make it a big deal. She said she would talk to the manager to see what she could do. Well, he was very accommodating and generously offered the appetizer sampler in place. We accepted, even though we had already ordered our food. Needless to say, we were impressed and the table ate the entire thing. Everyone enjoyed the meals and we all had a great time. We would definitely go back, except next time we will find the downstairs entrance!",

Everything you could ever want in a bright, welcoming, inclusive and extravagant eatery.  Can we talk for a minute about the irresistible cocktails? Candy, booze and magic combine to make a delectable concoction that you will feel transformed after consuming. Made to share though I suggest being selfish.  Our table had the rainbow sliders and except for the pickle, they were perfection. Cooked to the exact right temperature and an absolute joy to eat.  Unless you truly love yourself, don't get dessert. We had the chocolate cake but there isn't a wrong choice. I don't have words to accurately describe how rich and sinful this cake was. Eat. It. All.  Most importantly I want to talk about the staff. Top to bottom they were exactly what you want in any dining experience. We were attended to by Ashley L. and she could not have been better. Attentive, kind and very welcoming, Ashley was nothing short of perfect. I use that word a lot but it's accurate. Were I from this area I would return weekly if not daily and every time request Ashley.  Keep in mind that the entire staff is easy on the eyes. That's inappropriate but I'm only in Vegas once so Imma be honest. They're as delicious as the atmosphere and the food.  I hope to be back as soon as possible. I'll be talking about this experience for a long time to come.",

    "text": "After having a late lunch in the food court, we decided to wander out to Sugar Factory for ice cream . We were seated in the upstairs \"chocolate lounge\". Area did not appear busy, only 3 other tables were occupied.  Ordered: Caramel Brownie Bread Pudding $12 and Fried Ice Cream & Oreo Cookie $12 (with the plan to split between two people)...were later told that they were out of fried oreos. Ordered the Cookie Jar Sundae for Two $14 (again meant to split between two people)  Received: \"An extra shake\"...while waiting for our orders to arrive, a different server came to our table and dropped off a milkshake saying that it was extra from another table's order. We graciously thanked her and sampled what we believe was a cookies n cream shake. Caramel Brownie Bread pudding: Traditional bread pudding served cold with bits of fudge brownies..all swimming in a pool of melted vanilla ice cream. 2 spoons arrived with the bread pudding. No napkins were provided.  Service: Waiter checked in with us four times:  1. to drop off waters & menus  2. take initial order  3. informed us that one order could not be completed as they ran out of fried oreos  3.5--After waiting 30 minutes (after bread pudding was dropped off) flagged waiter down to ask about our missing sundae, she pointed at the \"extra shake\" and said that was what we had ordered. When we asked why it wasn't a sundae, she responded \"it's the same thing...just blended\", with further questioning she blamed the kitchen and said \"they've been messing up orders lately\" 4. to drop off the bill   The check: We were charged for the caramel brownie bread pudding $12 & a (not ordered) cookie jar milkshake $11 Based off this check, I believe the server entered in our order incorrectly (despite stressing that the ice cream sundae was going to be for two people)..but wasn't apologetic (instead passing the blame to the other staff).  Cleanliness: Table surface was not cleaned completely. A different waiter came by mid-way through our wait with a rag to wipe extra chocolate off the side of our table. Floor was sticky in some areas. Crumbs/sprinkles on seat.  OVERALL: As a local, I would PASS on this tourist spot. Poor service and dining experience = an \"extra\" order we were charged for, a missing order, and no napkins/utensils or drink refills",

    "text": "We had a good time, but I can only give 3 stars for a couple reasons.  We live in the area and some family came into town and spotted a groupon for The Sugar Factory and wanted to try it out.  We did not have reservations, so I dropped by and put our name on the wait list for walk-ins.  They estimated about a 45 minute wait time, which we were willing to wait (we understood we did not have reservations and the wait was expected.)  However, about an hour later after waiting it out, I asked the hostesses if they had a new estimate for our wait.  We were informed that the manager had told them they could not seat any more walk-ins for the foreseeable future.  I asked if I could speak to him, as we had put our names in so long before and had been standing there biding my time with the 5 other people in my party who had, by now, joined me at the location.  After a moment, the hostesses found us a table in a dimly lit corner by the door (we were grateful for it too, he did not seem like he was going to seat us anywhere despite any length of time waited).  On our way past we heard him reprimand them for seating walk ins when it had become pretty clear that he made that cutoff/ distinction after our names were already on the list.  It just made the whole experience taste a bit bitter and it felt rather unorganized.  No one never actually brought us silverware (we were given two sets and our waitress did finally bring napkins so, fair trade?)  It seemed appropriately busy for a night on the strip, but she seemed a bit flustered the entire time so maybe it was worse than I realized? The food was pretty good, though a bit over priced for its quality (eh, it is on the strip so the inflated price tag was a bit expected) and I really wish that you could get personal sized cocktails that mimic the goblets because if you want some you have to go full fish bowl or nothin'.  Overall, we did have a good time and the girls up front were lovely and kind. I hope they did not have to take too much guff for having made sure we were seated. I would like to return to another location to give them another try. Probably specifically for desserts this time around.",

    "text": "I absolutely loved the Sugar Factory location that used to be over at Paris.  I thought the food and drinks were delicious there!  So I was pretty excited when I found out they were opening a new location at Fashion Show Mall.  I've been here a couple of times now since they opened.  Service was \"meh\" the first time and we were told they were out of dry ice so I couldn't get the goblet that I wanted.  What kind of business that specializes in these drinks runs out of dry ice?!  That was a huge disappointment, but toward the end of our meal, we found out that they had some dry ice in so I placed an order for a non-alcoholic Watermelon Patch goblet.  At the time it was half off with Yelp check-in, which was great since those drinks are pricey, but the deal is no longer offered.  I got to take a cool video of it as the drink was made and it started to smoke, but it could have been smokier in my opinion :p  Taste-wise it was nothing spectacular to be honest, but it was pretty refreshing and handy to take to-go with me since it was such a hot day.  As for the food, I had the Sugar Factory Club, which was totally average.  Even though food and service were not great on that visit, I wanted to come back to try their Caramel Sugar Daddy Cheesecake \"insane Shake.\"   On that visit, service was better, but not their food.  I got their tomato bisque which was not very good.  It came with cheddar brioche toast which I liked but there wasn't enough of.  The shake WAS pretty insane!  I had to take off the rainbow lollipop and Sugar Daddy to drink it and was given bags to put them in and take home.  The cheesecake that came with it was pretty good.  The shake itself was plain but tasted better with the caramel, which I wish there could have been more of.  I'll give three stars because the goblets and drinks are fun and Instagram-worthy :p  But the food is just not good (and the pasta dish I loved is no longer on the menu) and the service hit or miss, so now that I've tried what I wanted to try, I don't think I'll be coming back here.",

The killer part is a waitress came over in the area and served the tables around us all while ignoring our table and the neighboring table. She knew that some tables didn't have service and refuse to help out. The table next to us had to go hunt down someone to get the check. And we sat for a very long time to pay ours until THE WAITRESS WHO IGNORED US FINALLY ACKNOWLEDGED US and took our bill.

My sister ordered a cocktail that has no price on it and the reason it didn't have a price was because it cost 45$!!  It had a strong watermelon flavor, with vodka, Red Bull, and gummy bears.  They put dry ice in it so it looked cool.  My chicken and waffles Cost 28$ and was garbage compared to IHOPs chicken and waffle which is about 10$.  This place is kind of a tourist trap IMO.",

The service was nice even though the place was packed! My server was Heather! Such a kind helpful person! Then my friend came and we changed the table and the server was Rosie! Again very professional and know exactly what to do! I ordered half the King Kong celebration plate which was a lot but tasted soo good!!! They turned off the lights and sang the Happy Birthday song but they also let you pick a song that you like for the background music!! Such an amazing experience!!",

They have a lot of options of the Goblet which is the 60 oz cup or Martini or regular.  They also have really good food choices.  The waiter came back to check on us to see what we wanted, I got the white rum with gummies and it was so delicious. For the food portion I got the King Salmon with mash potatoes and asparagus and it was amazing! Very fulfilling! Very fast, everyone comes and check on you to make sure your good and I liked that.",

Very fun and vibrate place with some great choices of food, drinks and especially candy.   Service: My service was good but not the greatest. I've received better in other restaurants, but I think my waiter was tired and ready to go. She greeted with a smile, but I think some missed opportunities with for better customer service. Staff dressed very professionally and smiled throughout my service. I think there were chances where I think the waiter could have provided suggestions or possible promotions at the time of service.   Food: High-Five to the chef. All items were delicious and wanted more but my stomach could not handle it because it was so much.  With that being said, they provided you with a great portion of food and the drinks are awesome.  Unfortunately, one of the drinks was not available at the time of service, it was still was good. My sliders and the milkshake were delicious with my dessert. Yes, you could have rolled me out of there after I was finished. It was that good.   Overall: I would really recommend that you visit. Great food, great drinks, and great dessert. I can't wait to go back or visit their other locations.",

The drinks are an experience they have CO2 in them so they are so mystical and fun. I would recommend you drink it quickly because the bottom will freeze  if you don't get to it in time. There are delicious candies through the drink adding to the sugar overload.   The appetizers and food are just as good as the dessert factor here. The Mac and cheese bits specifically are amazing. They are gooey and warm and the sauce is a perfect pairing. We had the burger that also had the Mac and cheese and it was so yummy. I would say two adults can share an meal especially if you get dessert. Speaking of the desserts are out of this world cool and delicious. I would go back just for that next time. I love this place so much. Worth every penny.",

He was awesome and was super helpful in choosing one of the many drinks they have available. We will definitely be looking for him on our next visit. we chose the \"Energy Bear\" for a drink - it was the perfect pick me up to get going again. We were also able to try the Mac and cheese lollipops with the yelp check in and it was just what we needed before dinner. Crisp crunchy outside, with a gooey cheesy inside. Glad we were able to try the out.",

I've come here every single time I've been to Vegas (too many to count) and I've always ordered the goblet drinks. Sweet cocktails served in a goblet full of ice and dry ice for $40 each. Drinks and a show! The drinks are sweet but strong and packed full of candy and booze!   I've ordered their appetizer platter quite a few times and the Mac and cheese balls are to die for!!   The service is always amazing, and if you're lucky, the server will give you a to-go baggie of candy! If you can't finish your drink, they'll also give you a to-go cup.   Keep an eye out on Groupon for $40 worth of food and beverage for $28 deal. This place can get pricy real quick!",

Ive heard nice things about this place, so why not give it a try. The outside is nicely decorated, they do have a balcony, of course there is a friendly hostess luring you in. I visited on a Friday afternoon, so we got in instantly, no wait. There is a lot of competition in Vegas for food, Ive never waited at any restaurant so far in Vegas. Our hostess was really nice and on point at all times, she explained everything. They do have a Yelp coupon for a free appetizer, we picked the macaroni balls which were delish and filling!! We had the orange chicken salad and a burger/ fries, all the food was good. I was a bit surprised due to the popularity of this place!  I did take pics of the bartender making drinks, great experience, but I guess Im not the average when it comes to valuing my coins. I did visit the candy shop for a few treats upon leaving.  Try it and let me now what ya think!  Tip: Research the safety of Nitrogen drinks, decide if is this a good choice for U. Great photo Op, and it does look tasty.",

We were seated immediately and decided to sit outside since it was such a gorgeous day. The menu is very large and has a great selection and variation of drinks you can order.   We ordered the Goblet raspberry watermelon mojito and the Sugar Factory Club sandwich. My boyfriend and I shared both. The goblet was very huge and I'm glad we shared considering both the size and the price of each one. $40 for a goblet. They sometimes have a \"buy one get one free\" deal on goblets so keep your eye out!   The drink was super delicious!! And really refreshing as well. The mint and raspberry made the drink taste not overly sweet which I liked. It had watermelon candies on the rim as well. I really liked how the waitress first asked if we were ready for her to pour the drink, this allowed for us to take out our phones and record this moment without missing anything.   The Sugar Factory Club sandwich was okay. In my opinion it was nothing out of this world and tasted like an overpriced average sandwich. The meat tasted like overly processed turkey. I probably wouldn't order the sandwich next time.   When you come to the Sugar Factory, you definitely come for the experience! Paying $40 for a big drink was worth it in my opinion just to get the full experience. Plan to splurge at the Sugar Factory to get a sweet treat!",

A manager actually reached out to me to rectify the situation which I thought was very nice and surprising, so I decided to try again. This time we were seated faster and got drinks within 15 minutes( not terrible). Our waitress was very nice and attentive so that was a plus over last time. We ordered 2 drinks and 3 meals. The American Honey drink was delicious, however the raspberry sin was not as expected. We even questioned why it looked nothing like on the menu. (See pics) The turkey club and fries were delicious as well as the Manhattan eggs Benedict. However my Chinese chicken Salad was very lackluster and nothing like the picture. Overall, I still think this place is too expensive for what you get, but I am giving 3 stars ( mostly because I can't do 3.5) based off of the caring manager, good service and mostly good drinks/food.",

Our waiters were extremely helpful and had positive vibes. We told them we were celebrating our first year wedding anniversary. And they totally made is feel special.  The experience was dope, I loved the specialty drinks. They do get creative so whatever your into I'm sure they have something for you.   Sooooo, If I'm being honest the food was basic. I wasn't impressed. I ordered the Steak and Eggs and it was eh. My husband ordered the Waffles and Chicken. He also agree, his Chicken wasn't tasty or in his words seasoned to perfection. But honestly once you start drinking the food will be fine! (Lol) So go enjoy the experience and drink up!",

Although we didn't order food, we did get two goblets (one alcoholic, one not). Those things are HUGE and stronger than I thought it would be. They were actually pretty tasty and didn't have an over bearing sugary taste.  They also pour the drink right in front of you so you get to experience the smokey, mystical magic right in front of you. Our waitress and staff was very friendly, the place wasn't busy at all on a Tuesday afternoon and will definitely go back if I ever get the chance!",

The restaurant turns out its lights and sang a personalized happy birthday to my daughter. Our server, Maria, rocked the house. She treated my daughter so extra special! Thanks for everything!!",

    "text": "Pretty poor experience. My friends kids were turning 12 and I suggested this place for dinner thought it would be fun.   Service: When we first got there our server had a terrible attitude and was not very helpful. He seemed annoyed we all ordered milk shakes right away. One of the kids spilled water and he was extremely slow to react or care. No empathy was shown so the kid felt terrible for accident. It's not hard to say \"it's okay, it happens.\"  We were verbal about his attitude and lack of attention to him directly then our server changed. Second server was very pleasant and helpful.   Food: The food was rough. Mostly because mine was the worst and I'm writing the review.  I ordered chicken and waffles and the chicken was so over done it was hard as a rock. Not edible at all. The server did not come back until half way through the meal so I just ate the waffles. When she did come back she took the chicken and said she'd have it remade. The server agreed it looked terrible which almost made it worse because she served it.  The chicken took over 20 minutes everyone else was done eating so I told them to never mind I didn't want to sit here and eat when everyone else's was ready to go.   Final thoughts / TLDR: The place seems gimmicky. I would only recommend stopping in for the ambience and maybe a milkshake - skip the food it's Vegas plenty places to get good food and hospitality.",

The girl at the front wasn't very friendly but that definitely didn't stop us .   My little sister ordered the rainbow sliders and they were so cute . They tasted Fine . I ordered the Steak sandwich with fries that was good . My step dad ordered a burger with a side of chimicurri sauce and it honestly looked like oil with crushed red pepper . It wasn't great. My brother ordered shrimp Alfredo and it was good but honesty tasted like boxed fettuccine Alfredo . The fondue we got for dessert was the best part . It was good and enough for all of us to share .   I was a little disappointed at the service and we also let the waiter know that it was my sister's birthday and I think he forgot . They didn't do anything for her . Overall , my experience was just OK . The food is over priced for what it is , the service wasn't great and the food was just alright . Unfortunately I feel that there are far better places to eat at on the Las Vegas strip .",

I had reached out to the restaurant in advance to make sure everyone could pay with separate checks and make sure they could accommodate us as we needed and they were so helpful. When I got to the restaurant, they took me to a corner booth and helped me set up all of our materials. Our host answered any and all questions and stayed to make sure our small group had all arrived and we were settled (Thanks again, Madison!). Our server, Jason, took amazing care of us as did the rest of the staff who kept our water glasses full and made sure we had everything we could possibly need.   We had the Rainbow Sliders which were so yummy (and super photogenic) and three of the craziest milkshakes I've ever seen in my life (Twinkie Dinkie, Tie Dye, Caramel Sugar Daddy Cheesecake). I literally had a slice of cheesecake sitting on top of my milkshake! My club sandwich was so big it's literally served as three meals ($16 might sound pricey but given it's been three lunches, it's a good deal). When it was time for our bills, they were brought out separately as discussed in advance with absolutely no fuss. That never happens anywhere! One of the managers even gave us a tour of the chocolate lounge upstairs and offered to take photos for us in front of all the cool displays.  I was a HUGE fan of the original Sugar Factory when it first opened inside Paris Hotel and Casino. I rarely go to one place multiple times but Sugar Factory was my favorite place to frequent (and that says a lot). When the menu changed I wasn't happy and I didn't love the incarnation at Town Square. I wasn't sure what to expect of this new location but when I walked in I was thrilled. It has the same look and feel of the original and the menu even has the original items (many of which were removed when the menu was remodeled). If you eat here, make sure to go upstairs to see all of the displays outside the chocolate lounge! It's an Instagram dream come True (especially the miniature carousel). Yes, the restaurant is ornate and over the top but it's Las Vegas, get over it.   Thank you Madison, Jason, Mery and all the wonderful staff at Sugar Factory for making our gathering so amazing! I can't wait to come back!!!",

I was with a group of 5 girls. 3 were seated and given Complimentary drinks for Ladies Night & told the waitress (Terri D.) that they were waiting for 2 more ladies to order. The last two arrived and we had to wait 30 minutes before we were even acknowledged again! We tried to wave her down, she put a finger up signaling she'd be there in a second. We literally went up to another waitress and just asked her to please take out order, she said you guys aren't in my section so I'll just tell her... WELL SHE DIDNT. We waved down what looked to be a manager and told him how we had not be attended in over 45 minutes, she finally came around apologizing that she was busy & had too many tables. It literally felt like she was just plain ignoring us because in the time we spent waiting to get our food and drinks; 3 appetizers & 2 goblets (2 1/2 hours +) we saw the two tables next to us get several rounds of drinks and one of them managed to finish a goblet, have dinner, order dessert, & was even sung happy birthday to. So obviously she was just \"TOO BUSY\" to stop by our table for some reason. Oh by the way we were half way into our goblets before we had to stop the manager again to ask him to get us the complimentary drinks for the two other ladies who arrived a little late. And the only reason we bothered him again is because we waited over 20 minutes after asking Terri again to bring them...   I don't buy her too busy excuse because I saw plenty of other tables being attended and serviced... it felt personal, we felt ignored and for no reason. We were trying to be polite but we are never doing ladies night here ever again.",

Otherwise, I would recommend literally anywhere else.  My family and I went here for my mom's birthday lunch a couple days ago and it was awful. We were there at noon on a weekday so it wasn't even busy, but we struggled to get our server's attention the whole time, and none of the other waitstaff walking by would stop to clear plates. We finally had to ask someone and he actually ignored us. It was so weird and not Vegas-like service at all. They also didn't do anything for the \"birthday\" part of the lunch (like saying a simple 'happy birthday') and we didn't bother bringing it up a third time to our waiter. There were five of us and we didn't have alcohol or dessert but it was still over $200 which felt so wasteful. We were all really disappointed by such an icky experience eating out.   More on the food: The blue cheese bacon burger and onion rings  were good.  The fish tacos were really gross.  Chicken fingers, club sando, grilled chicken sando were all fine.",

    "text": "Loved this place! Also because I love candy and sugar! There was a huge list of alcoholic drinks to choose from that had actually gummies in it! Plus the dry ice gave it that smoky look, which was so much fun to watch. The downside is the big drinks cost $40 and you don't actually get much to drink it is definitely more for the experience. I was able to finally get a donut burger for lunch too! It was a pretty picture that much was for sure. The burger itself was good, but boy was it messy, the glaze stuck to my fingers the entire time, and the \"bun\" fell apart almost instantly, at least the flavors were great. The service was pretty fast and friendly and the decor of the restaurant was really fun! They had a slideshow playing on loop with celebrities and different concoctions of drinks. This is a must from now on every time I come to Vegas again.",

Great!   We get to the location and after being seated it was cool. We were greeted promptly and our servers were super friendly. The place itself was very cute. There were 4 of us and we ordered: 2 milk shakes, 1 Goblet drink and 1 martini with grey goose vodka instead of the standard vodka, an order of French fries and an order of spinach dip. The bill came and it was $117! I wouldn't even mind the price because the goblet drink was cute and really good and I liked the atmosphere BUT, one of the shakes was not good so one of the kids didn't drink it. The martini wasn't sweet and it was a Lemon drop, and the food was soooo bland.   The staff was very sweet though. I think our waiters name was Mellz (sorry if I butchered that) and he made my son's night with his dancing and just being relatable.   If you're hungry, eat first then come here for your drinks and sweets.",

    "text": "First I would like to say that the food was good. My husband and I ordered the rainbow sliders, onion rings and fries. The fries were lightly seasoned, however they were string thin, but also tasty. The sliders were flavorful and filling, as were the onion rings. My friend ordered the macaroni and cheese balls, they give you 3 and she only ate 1, they were not good.  Second, the drinks. The drinks were very yummy with just enough sweet and alcohol combined. I ordered the chocolate strawberry cocktail and my friend ordered the root beer float.  Last I would like to give the reason of only 2 stars. The service. The service was terrible. We sat for nearly 30 min before someone came to take our order. To top it off, our waitress was so eager to get another tables order that she said she'd be back to finish our order after she took the other tables order and then never came back. About 20min later she shows up with a milkshake saying we ordered it, um no, you never came back to finish taking our order. Wrong table.  The entire time we were there not once did she come check to make sure everything was ok or to see if we needed drink refills.  I had to flag her down to get our check, by this time the table was cleared by another person. So will I ever go back, probably not to this location.",

Well after visiting I'll just say don't believe the hype lol The Goblets are simply just for the looks smh for 40$ you get a big cup of ice & juice with maybe a 10 min buzz, unbelievable. I even told a guy that looked like he may of been a manager that the drinks were nothing but juice. The food was \"ok\" nothing special and the portions weren't all that large compared to the places I've been in Vegas. For $150 I could of went to an awesome steak house. Disappointed and won't be returning.  Update: After further consideration me and my husband decided to give the sugar factory another go. I must say this time around it was truly a wonderful experience. Our waiter \"Anne Marie\" was more than fantastic and the managers were very kind and apologetic for the inconvenience during our first visit. Our food , drinks and service was beyond exceptional. The music was even great . As a local I would definitely recommend them for fun night out.",

    "text": "UPDATE:  After the manager reached out to me on yelp to try again we totally took her up on that offer. Jeneivieve was super apologetic and very prompt in making our reservations after I gave her a date that me and my guest would be available. So one week later me and my best friend went back up to Sugar Factory. And by the end of the night I was FLOORED with how amazing our service was!!  From the moment we got seated we were taken care of. This was the experience that I was looking for last time. We got greeted by the manager  (and he apologized which we graciously accepted) , and then from that moment our waitor Jason gets 5 stars! He was awesome, funny, attentive, and a pleasure all night. There was nothing we asked of him that he did not give us with a smile on his face. We started out the evening with two goblets (he recommended the lollipop one) and on top of presentation the drink was delicious. I will definitely come back for that goblet alone. My friend orderd the Drake and boy oh boy was it strong. You can taste the Virginia Black in it, thankfully the cotton candy added a nice sweetness to balance out all of the alcohol.   He gave us some time to enjoy our drinks and just chaqt before he came over and took our order. (which we appreciated). I ordered the country fried chicken with a side of Herb Varicots (fancy a** green beans) and my friend ordered the steak and frites (which he suggested). Both plates came out piping hot. The chicken was cooked perfectly with a crispy texture and a hint of sweetness in the skin. Her steak was cooked thoroughly and by the end of the night BOTH of our plates were empty. Upon the suggestion of the manner we both decided to order deserts. I ordered the red velvet cake. Now to be honest I didn't read it all the way through because I hate raspberry and this cake was loaded with raspberry cream, mousse, layers, syrups.....so that was a miss for me. I got a chance to taste my friends fried ice cream, and to be honest it was just OK. We were so full that the only thing we could really enjoy were the lollipops that were in my drink. (which were amazing).   Let me tell you. This entire night was the exact service we were expecting the first time we came. And although they didn't get it right then, they got it right the second time. They have ultimately changed my heart and I can't wait until my friends can come in town so I can bring them here. Thank you to Jenivieve, Manuel, and Jason for the great night.  Literally the worst experience. From the moment we walked it was just a complete lack of attention, lack of hospitality, lack of well....EVERYTHING.   I made reservations for this place a week and a half prior for 8:30 pm. We were a little early but we definitely wanted to get there early to look around and take some pictures. I heard the upstairs lounge was super cute and we were more than excited to check it out. Once I showed up to the hostess stand there was NO ONE there. After a few minutes of staring idly at the drink bar outside, a manager came out to speak to the bartender (who was watching us stare at him...) and then saw us waiting. He immediately sat us at the empty table outside without asking name questions reservations etc. We thanked him and for 15 minutes we were not acknowledged, offered a glass of water, or even thought about UNTIL we saw another \"manager\" who came out to speak to the table behind us. I got his attention told him our issue, he apologized and said he will be right back to take our order. Then a woman came out who he introduced as the Event Coordinator took our food and drink order (PRAISE THE LORD CAUSE WHO KNEW WHEN WE'D SEE ANYBODY AGAIN).  By the time we got our food an hour has passed, and we never saw the event coordinator or either manager EVER again.   Let's talk about the food. It was SOOO BASIC. I order the jalapeno burger. Jalapenos, roasted tomatoes, Sugar Factory's special sauce and American cheese. Sounds good huh? NAH. They literally through a luke warm patty on a bun popped some uncooked or seasoned jalapenos on it with a slice of cheese, no sauce, no roasted tomato, and some sloppy lettuce. I was so turned off by the service, the food, and the entire night that I sucked it up and just ate it. I was so ready to go. Literally the entire experience ruined my night. At the end of the night I paid 19.00 for a burger that I could have went to Burger King for (at least it would have been hot). I could understand paying for the experience but there was no experience. They had one poor girl working the patio, there were more than enough empty table inside, the ran out of the ingredients for the one goblet we wanted, one glass of water the ENTIRE time. I didn't even bother going upstairs for pictures or to see the rest of the establishment, it was so horrible. I will never go back. EVER.",

    "text": "Want an over the top family dining experience in Las Vegas?  Then look no further than Sugar. This place is unlike any other. The menu is thick with interesting choices. Very good selection of appies, salads, burgers, anytime breakfast, pizzas, sandwiches and their over the top selection of fishbowl drinks, specialty drinks and specialty milkshakes.   We had a wonderful server Richard who was attentive and accommodating. We ordered 2 fishbowl drinks. One with alcohol ($38) and one without ($30) for our boys (ages 12 & 14). They are fun with the dry ice inside. Sweet as you'd expect in a place called sugar and for extra sweetness they add candy to the drinks.  We ordered an appetizer platter and the Sloppy Joe burger. Not everyone was hungry so we didn't order multiple meals. Appetizer platter had wings (good), onion rings (very good), chicken fingers (ok, not special) and amazing deep fried mac n cheese balls. Amazing!  And I'm not a huge mac n cheese fan. The sloppy joe burger was very tasty as were the thin fries that came with it.   We left stuffed and with our drinks Vegas style in to-go cups. Would go back next Vegas trip. Used a Groupon which helped lower the total cost.",

The young girl at the front was friendly and asked if we had a reservation(which we did). She quickly walked us right inside. There are four adults and two children and we were sat in a huge round booth and our server Jade was there as we settled in. He took drink orders and gave us a few minutes to look at the menu well he got us water. I had Salmon, my daughters had soup and cotton candy which was a gift from a woman manager/owner,maybe who made us several trips by checking on us and others around us. my husband had a monster burger which was incredible two and the other two friends with us had a garbage salad which was huge and the fettuccine. Jade sold me on a Virgin goblet for the girls and it was quite a show. The whole restaurant was rockin and from the time we arrived to the time we left it got busier and busier but the managers kept circling around making small talk and cotton candy was everywhere making everyone smile I food came fast but our third round of drinks took a little longer than the first two. My daughter's birthday is in February so I asked the manager about parties and She immediately took us upstairs for a tour. Still thinking about it,but it seems like a great spot. We live local and go down to the mall every so often and next time I won't Sugar Factory is there!",

Unfortunately one of our sugar goblets didn't have the dry ice because they ran out. But good ol' Chealsea made up for it and her service was just so pleasing, I didn't even care if my goblet didn't have the smoke hovering out of it. It still tasted great and so did the food! I got the Rainbow Sliders, juicy, colorful, basically a real life pretty patty (yeah, I just made a spongebob reference lol.) Our group came in to celebrate two of their birthdays so we also got the BIG bowl of ice cream and candy delivered so happily by all the sugar factory servers. That dessert was also pretty bomb. Enough to feed us all!   Don't forget to check-in on Yelp for the 50% off the sugar goblet (theres also non alcoholic ones!) Also, one of my friends used a groupon here as well so you can check that out too.  I'm so glad they opened a new restaurant here, I was pretty sad when the one at the Paris closed down. But forsure this wont be my last visit!",

Dear Travis, I decided to take our therapists advice  to come back and enjoy a Buy One Get One goblet with two different girls on another trip. I was so excited and nervous to see you again but then I was let down that you stood me up on Monday. I really was hoping we could work this out Travis. But I guess it's not me, it's you. Thankfully, Erick was my white knight and swept me off my feet. He was fun and flirty and knew exactly what to recommend. I left with a big hug, a drink to go and delicious dinner and dessert from the retail store. So I forgive you Travis. Erick has shown me a whole new experience that will leave me feeling taken care of, loved and happily full.  Sincerely,  The girl who is breaking up with you from feeding her way to much food in May.

After the bite I inspected my food and the chicken was very very undercooked. They were super apologetic, brought me new food and didn't charge me for my dinner. They also brought us a free dessert, which was appreciated. Again, the service was great. Later that night I got extremely stomach sick though and I know it was from the bite of raw chicken.

Our waiter starts walking with a HUGE sundae (with sparklers) in hand and behind him a line of other staff members. Once they arrived to our table they begin to sing Happy Birthday. IT WAS AMAZING!

First I thought I can use the Groupon but then they say I can't use it bec I have to have 4 people to be able to use it. So I wasn't able to use it and that's a bummer .   Then I checked out the store . Ok so what is the difference between this store compared to the other candy stores ? Actually it's only the name and the plastic goblet that says sugar factory and that's it . All of the candies here u may find it in any candy store . They don't have any signature candy or chocolate like See's candies or ghirardelli So anyways I still got myself some chocolate covered gummy and nuts .        On to our dining experience , the decor of the restaurant is ok nothing really fancy. Since it's a sugar factory I would expect more sugar decor lol . But it's just an ordinary restaurant type of decor . We got the orders right away and my kid ordered the berry bliss and it was really great to experience it . Me and  my friend ordered fettuccine . So the food came , my kid was delighted to see the smokey berry bliss . My guess is that they put dry ice on the bottom , add some berries and then when it's time to serve , the server pour the cocktail (without the alcohol) to the big goblet and then it starts to smoke . Pretty neat. Then the lunch was served , my son ordered the chicken with waffle . It's a big serving but the taste is not that great the chicken is salty. The waffles didn't come with any fruit or whip cream . And IHOP waffles tasted better than this one . Onto our fettuccine oh my gosh it is way salty to my taste oh my goodness what's wrong with me everything I taste always taste salty . But how come the other pasta restaurant doesn't taste salty at all ?         So at least I got a great talk with my long time friend who's based from Vegas . Then I got the bill . The berry bliss in the goblet was $30 so I thought maybe the goblet is free that we can bring it home . But no . The price is  $30 it's only great to experience it . So that's another bummer and so I have to buy it from the store if I want and it cost $20 . Well that's it I cannot say I fully recommend it . If u want to experience it why not go ahead but be aware ur paying way too much . I wouldn't recommend to eat the salty foods that you may order anywhere else but I would recommend the goblet if you want to experience it .",

The food was amazing- I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp and chicken, my fiancee ordered a steak and lobster tail entree. And we shared a white gummy goblet drink. We came in around 2pm on a Saturday. First of all, the drink was amazing. So worth it. The food was delicious- we both enjoyed our meals. And our server was fun and made the experience that much more enjoyable. I will definitely be back!",

The drinks were still so pretty to look at i forgot about the fog I was looking forward to and enjoyed my time there.

Place reminded me of an old soda fountain bar but with adult beverages disguised as childhood dream thirst quenchers, and a candy emporium as we came in.  Wife chose a Strawberry Mojito to share. Waiter was attentive and gave her the heads up to grab a video of the pour of our watermelon mojito into the icy red glass.  Once the liquid he poured hit the dry ice, the vaporous concoction started to bubble and boil.  Pretty tasty as well with a good mix of rum, fruit, mint and enough little fruit gummys to put a four year old into a sugar coma.  Food arrived and wifeys fish tacos were crispy and delicious.  My steak was petite, but well marbled, very well seasoned, and cooked perfectly with my over easy eggs and crispy home style potatoes.  Toast was meh, but satisfactory to mop up the eggs.  Price was the usual stack of cash for two.  Enjoyed it all and would recommend!",

For starters, we made a reservation for 1.45 and they obviously knew nothing about it - the hostess struggled to find us a table and led us to one that was still covered in dishes! We sat down as she cleared this away, came back to ask what name it was under and then wiped down the table. Ok...  Nearly 15 minutes later we got asked if we were ready for drinks. Ordered 3 martinis and our food as well - 2 burgers and the fettuccine. The group next to us asked for their check about this time.   20 minutes later...no drinks. The group next door asked for their check again. We saw several goblets and insane milkshakes being served at the bar but nothing came our way.   Finally, almost 45 minutes after we sat down we got our drinks. Our food came shortly after that and the next door peeps finally got their check after asking for the 3rd time and noticing how long we had been waiting.   I give one star for the food being delicious and the other star for our poor server, who advised one of them has just walked out for no reason and \"something's going on in the kitchen, I don't even know what.\" Poor staff, I felt really sorry for them with such disorganisation going on.",

As for the food... I don't really have much to say because it was so average. Definitely check out this place for dessert or a drink when you're ready to spend a lot for a great photo or just an over-the-top indulgence, but I suggest passing on  having a regular meal here. As for the prices... well expect to pay a LOT for what you're getting but check the Yelp or other promo deals.",

The thing that pissed me off about our visit on July 23rd was the fact that when my daughter was proofed because she wanted one of those overpriced, giant drinks the server saw her birthday was the day before.  We were there for lunch and one of those dumb drinks for my daughter.  We were not there to celebrate her birthday and we never indicated that to the server.  At the end of the meal the server comes out with an ice cream and a sparkler in it for my daughters birthday.   I sat there and thought what a nice touch.  Well, when we got the bill I saw it wasn't so nice - we were charged $10 for something we never asked for.  Just be aware of this I'm positive the servers are taught to look at birthdays for any recent ones and pull this stunt.  Just be aware of what's going on.",

Perhaps more importantly in a restaurant review, the food is phenomenal. I highly recommend anything with guacamole in it, but really you can't go wrong here!",

    "text": "I looked very much forward to sampling offerings here, but the visit itself yielded mixed results.    The ambiance was colorful, loud, lively, and bright--until lights were seriously dimmed for the night service. French Onion Soup was only okay, with a minimal amount of cheese and broth that tasted like Lipton's boxed onion soup.  To the contrary, the three meatballs covered with Marinara Sauce were very good as a featured appetizer, and Diane's trio of Fred Macaroni & Cheese Pops were nicely filled with gooey Mac 'n Cheese.  The Tomato Soup that accompanied her Grilled Cheese Sandwich was also creamy and delicious, although the sandwich itself stuck to the bread, was too dry, and the two slices were clumsily and unevenly joined.  While the soups and appetizers came out quickly, there was over a 45-minute wait for our entrees.  My party of three sat and sat while we watched other diners be seated after us, receive all of their food, and leave.  Our server said that our entrees would be coming shortly, but never admitted that a snafu had occurred in the kitchen.  This was very evident when I was presented with a bill for double what we had ordered in salads and Grilled Cheese Sandwiches.  This was promptly corrected by our server, who then acknowledged that our entree orders were rung up twice (for unknown reasons).  At least the Chicken Salad with Ginger Dressing was abundant, moist, and very good; the hand-cut French Fries excellent; and my sip of Diane's Chocolate Cookie Jar Insane Milkshake through a thick green straw, with the taste of caramel coming through the chocolate, simply outstanding.",

When I called to ask exactly where in the Fashion Show Mall this is at, the lady on the phone was very nonchalant. Additionally, the hostess was worse; didn't even properly greet us.   There was only one server for an entire section and many customers were complaining how long everything took.  Do not order the burgers! The menu says \"grass-fed burgers\" and they cost $19. But I can tell they were frozen patties and they were dry. Go to Wendy's if you want a juicier burger. Everyone at my table agreed about the dry $19 burgers.  The premier milkshakes are what they are known for. So for $19 each, it is worth the price. However overall for you money, the untrained staff, and also how their air conditioning did not work in the middle of the summer, I will not come back.",

    "text": "I never got the chance to visit the original Sugar Factory Brasserie on the Strip back when it was outside Paris LV.  So I was pretty excited when I found out that they re-opened at the Fashion Show Mall.  Now I finally have a chance once again to try some of their outrageous menu items.  I was actually interested in trying one of their Insane Milkshakes on the menu.  In particular, their Bacon Cheeseburger Milkshake.  After all, it was National Hamburger Month when I was there.  And it was definitely a huuuuuuuuuuge milkshake good enough to be my lunch.  Bacon Cheeseburger Milkshake -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2vLk12Q&s=607408fb7754d6592a56f710448f47b93c6533ee2695c248699882c5a7a778cf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2vLk12Q</a> Strawberry Ice Cream drizzled with strawberry sauce and topped with whipped cream, a Mini Cheeseburger, Candy Bacon Strip, in a Chocolate Covered Mug with pretzel pieces and M&Ms. Just to be clear, there's no cheeseburger in the milkshake.  As you can see from the pic, the candy bacon strip and mini cheeseburger are both served outside the milkshake and were more like decorations.  Still though, just by looking at the pic, it's pretty damn insane!   The milkshake was good and I enjoyed the sweet and salty combined flavors when eaten with the mini cheeseburger, candied bacon, and pretzel pieces.  This is not something I'd order all the time but if you want shock value, this is one thing you can consider getting.  I ended up finishing at about 80 percent of the shake, so I was very satisfied!  Sugar Factory at the Fashion Show Mall is definitely a spot you want to check out for some shock value dining and drinking.  I would love to come back again to try more things from their menu.  Almost everything on the menu has some kind of playful Willy Wonka look to them and would be fun to enjoy either by yourself or with a group.",

It is definitely a bit on he pricey side but knowing that you'll be fine if you plan to just spurge. I got the grilled fish tacos (cod) instead of fried and a basket of fries. My guest got wings. I need to go back and order a huge $20 shake and share w a friend lol. Our waiter was cool but since no one is allowed to wear a name tag I don't recall his name. Kind of weird but whatever. The music was a bit too loud for an early lunch could have passed on that it's more of a night time music feel and it was too early lol. The drinks are fun but again pricey @$30 ish. But u can keep the fish bowl or yellow duck or whatever if u want some Vegas souvenirs. It's a novice type of place for tourists but I'll go back when I have visitors come in. Love the Chandeliers but the candy store is a little expansive. My guest was going to get a couple gimbals and 2-3 blow pops-it was $7! That's a bit steep. Lol. Just plan to spend a lot and have fun and like the waiter said \"it's for the Gram\" (instagram photo ops)",

For dessert we had a fried cookies and cream ice cream and fried Oreos. Very different but a great dessert! Our waiter was impecable, very attentive with not only us but everyone he was helping.

It's around $4-$5 more for any day (includes Fri-Sun) GroupOn. We arrived in town on Thursday so we had dinner there on our first night.   We got seated right away since, I guess, Mon. To Thurs. is not a busy night. As soon as we were seated, I regret our decision. As a family, we like to look at the menu and talk about our choices but I could barely say a word without screaming because the music was so loud!!!!!! I guess they don't want you to talk to anyone you are with and have a nice conversation over food.  The next regret came when we saw the prices on the menu. With the $40 GroupOn we got one order of $20 rainbow sliders, 5 tiny pieces so it comes out to $4 each where you get two bites each out of it. We also got one order of $19 shake which came with a bonus tiny slider.  I was going to check in to Yelp to get 50 percent off one of the smoking goblet but I was told that I cannot combine it with the GroupOn. Lucky break that I realized later on since I would rather spend my money elsewhere.   The worst part was being seated next to the elevator where all night long scantily dressed women were brought up there by the wait staff. That must be their free ticket to get up there. There's not that much space in between the elevator and our table so it's a bit distracting. The elevator is also close to another room where the wait staff keeps going in and out. This must be how it felt like to be seated next to the restroom.   This place is just hyped up by the Kardashian family and other celebrities. We go to Vegas at least once a year and this is definitely one of those one time visit only.",

    "text": "The Sugar Factory! What can I say, this place was dope AF! I've seriously never been anywhere like it. They're known for their specialty shakes and oh-so-sugary cocktails. It says on the wall, it's the \"most instagrammed restaurant\" and I can see why. First of all, their drinks are absolutely wild!!  Secondly, it has been visited by so many celebs...Kim and Kylie, JLo, Drake, you know, just some B-listers, no big deal.  There are a lot of drinks to choose from, but if you go with a goblet, I recommend the spicy pineapple because the drink itself was really tasty, and the gummies inside are ACTUALLY SPICY!! I actually ended up fishing out all the gummies and asked for a to-go box so that I can continue to enjoy them. Just keepin in real.  Besides sugary drinks and insane smoothies and desserts, they actually have food that you can load up on before the sugar haul. Because we had literally just had dinner when we came here, we tried to go \"lite\" and ordered to salad. How very healthy of me.  But seriously, this place is worth checking out if you're an instagram whore like me. Oh, and if you happen to get like at least 10 friends to go, I would just order the King Kong....the most epic dessert you will ever eat in your life!!",

    "text": "So, so sad to write this review.  My husband and I were HUGE fans of the Sugar Factory back when they were at the Paris.  This new location is nice and the decor is fun.    We got the Passion Punch goblet which we got every time prior and this time is was unbelievably sweet with ZERO detectable alcohol.  Bummer because we used to get a little buzz on to start our day on the strip.    Fried Mac and Cheese are no longer triangle squares with breadcrumbs.  Now they are battered in what is like funnel cake batter and then fry them and put them on sticks so they are lollipops.  First, you used to get more... second the thick batter on the outside is just GROSS, third is I found something random and dark brown in one that was questionable.  The side sauce seems to be unchanged and still tasty.    The club sandwich was standard and good - hard to mess up though.   Lastly, our waiter was okay but he was also tending the outside bar.  Problem is I watched him pick his nose/ play with his nose ring MULTIPLE times and then continue touching things. GROSS!  The only reason I ate was because I saw him wash his hands before he brought us our food.    We want to love this location but will not be back.  Hopefully we can get a better experience at one of their other locations.",

Then Ronda came and said she would get us some water even though she walked by us 8 times without saying anything! So she brought us our waters while ashley brought our drinks and Ronda said to ashley I got them waters because this is my section... like really Ronda walked by us 8 times without saying anything and ashley came to help the customer which is the most important part, and then when the expeditor came to bring our food, Ronda came up behind him and said take it back this is not my section... this is so unprofessional and immature. So I would give Ronda 0 stars with Ronda with 4 stars because we never got offered a refill. What was the most aggravating was a party of 8 sat down and immediately were helped and got their drinks before us after they sat down 10-15 minutes after us.",

Our server recommended for us to go to the chocolate lounge that is a little more private. The moment we walked in the server/bartender (gay guy with blonde hair) was RUDE AF. He told us and the host that all the tables were reserved and we had to sit outside. Funny he said that, when there was only one table with a reserved sign. FYI--We were seated at one of the tables INSIDE THE CHOCOLATE LOUNGE. Once we were seated, it took awhile for our server to come, to get our beverage order, and the food. The food is not good, at least not for dinner. It's pretty much like diner food with contemporary furniture. The only plus with this restaurant is the view.",

The first time I visited The Sugar Factory was when it used to be at The Paris Hotel and it wasn't so great. We got sat way in the back where it was pretty dark, customer service wasn't the best and overall the food wasn't it either.   Decided to give it a second shot and I'm glad I did because right from the beginning the hostess greeted us & was super friendly. We talked for a bit while the rest of my party arrived and got seated right away. Our server that night was Jake ( I believe that was his name) and he was amazing! He would check in with us to see if we needed anything and he also let us know when & how long our food would arrive to our table. He was very friendly & attentive.   Overall, the service & food was phenomenal!  Thank you to the staff at The Sugar Factory for making my 21st birthday memorable; definitely will be coming back. Also the goblet drinks are a must because not only are the delicious  but  the presentation of it is so cool!",

( expecting my table to be ready and set up ) which it was not , I arrived at my reservation time which was 7pm and no one helped us at first ?? Second they didn't have our table set up ??? our waiter was completely rude he seemed like he really didn't care what we had to say or ask, so as the night went on I thought it was get a little better one of my friends ordered a steak  medium rare ( came out almost well done) , so she asked the waiter about the steak and about getting a new one and this was his response ( I work at a steakhouse for my second job I know what medium rare is ) which in a professional restaurant like that you should always make the customer HAPPY no matter what !!!! never came around !!

This was because the staff was to busy visiting with each other before they noticed we were standing there waiting to be seated. Ordered lunch and drinks... my boyfriend had to ask 3 different waiters for his diet coke before it finally arrived at the table before I was almost done eating my very wilted salad. I would only recommend coming to purchase the candy, for the food and service was horrible!! Also when I ordered one of their signature drinks, it came and wasn't what I was expecting, more disappointment! Thanks for letting me down sugar factory! Your place was on my list of things to do in Vegas, and it was a complete letdown!! :(",

I actually showed the bartender the gift card before I ordered and she said okay. I ordered and ate my breakfast. When presented with the check, I gave her the card and was having problems entering it. She went to speak to the manager who then, turns to me to tell me he has no way of processing the gift card since the different Sugar Factory locations use different POS systems. He offered no resolution to how I could redeem the gift card and was quite abrupt. Very disappointed in customer service and organization of Sugar Factory to allow this to types of situations to occur.",

    "text": "This was probably one of the WORST SERVICE I've had. I'm local. I myself work in the casino restaurant industry and my bf is a chef on the strip. So we very much we'll know hospitality.  We sat upstairs and we were greeted by the waitress. When I told her we needed a second before ordering drinks, she never once came back.  We waited what felt like 20mins until I had to get up and ask a bartender if he could send someone to get our drinks and that we were ready to order.  The manager than comes to take our order and you would think he would be apologetic after I had to wait and ask for service but no.. didn't bother him .. We ordered our food and drinks.  We waited no lie 30mins for sliders and a burger philly. The manager did however come by and said \"it shouldn't be much longer\" .. which really means .. \"it's still going to be awhile\"  There was only two waitress it wasn't busy for a Saturday night (11/4/17)they both had large parties of 10 and 15 no other tables just those two parties. If you can't handle a table of 2 let you're manager know ..  The waitresses looked confused and didn't know who's meals was who's when the large parties food came out, they were auctioning food.  Our food came out and my bf asked for  medium well burger and it wasn't. My rainbow sliders were not bad.  The busser did come by and asked how we were doing and refilled our drinks which I very much appreciated it.  The manager also than came by later to ask how was everything.  When we were done we waited another 15mins to see if anyone would come by. No one came, I easily could had walked out the restaurant without paying because no one attending us.  I AGAIN HAD TO GET UP AND ASK FOR MY BILL!!  My bf and I don't ever complain or make smart mouth remarks or ever call a manager. We're respectful and we try giving the benefit of the doubt. But this was one of the worst service we've had. So bad I had to make my first yelp review.  Sugar factory's hospitality sucks to the max and their management was just as bad ..",

One hamburger, two grilled cheese sandwiches and three drinks each large 2 small for the bargain price of $157. Our waiter was hard to find. By the time we were trying to get out of there to hit a Vegas show I was done with it all. I had to go to the hostess and ask her to find my server so that we could check out. The crew screams happy birthday to almost every table occupied, apparently it was everyone's birthday, with Roman candles shooting out the top of a deserts and noise levels of an airport runway conversation at our own table was rough at best. The drinks were billed as 63 ounces. With ice and dry ice to cause a bubbling effect we may of had a 12 oz drink watered down? Maybe they boiled off the alcohol? I'm just saying enough sugar to give a toothache, but nut enough kick to pack the tiniest buzz . I loved Farrell's ice cream parlors as a kid but this seems like a bit of a swing and a miss. In a town with lots of options keep looking.",

We had to wait a long time for our server to come to our table to ask for drink refills, order food, and pay the bill. Gratuity (18%) was included which is some bullshit because while our server was nice and polite, many things went wrong this meal and he was not attentive. If the restaurant had been full, I would understand but it was nearly empty. The Pepsi I ordered (they didn't have coke)  was one of the most disgusting things I've ever tasted. Something has to be very wrong with their soda machine. I ordered the Chinese chicken salad which wasn't horrible, but wasn't flavorful or fresh and the chicken wasn't quality. The fries were cold (they brought us a hot serving after we complained). The water tasted weird, I think it might've been something wrong with the ice. Also there were no paper towels or hand dryer or any way to dry your hands in the bathroom. For the price this place isn't worth it at all.",

The crepe was old and hard, the fried ice cream was the worst I've ever had. It was all very pretty though, so I guess I just paid for pictures of food. It was also so much sugar, I'm sick now. The goblet drinks look cool, and can be shared by 3 people easily. 40$ for alcoholic ones (about 7 shots worth of liquor), 35$ for virgin. It's way too much for too little. The atmosphere is really tacky, they advertise all the celebrities who have been there on every screen in the place, and the menus. I recommend going with friends, split the cost of a drink, get your pictures and leave.",

So we went up to the chocolate room and sat down and waited and waited and waited for our waiter to finally come when he came he seemed so annoyed with us and we had a few questions about the menu because obviously we had never been their before he answered us so short and then left to get our water which took another 30 min then left and came back to take our order! We had a few questions about getting a candle and singing happy birthday and he was really really rude and seemed like he didn't even want to be at our table so we didn't end up doing anything extra which was a major bummer to our nephew cause that's the whole reason we went their! We wouldn't have left a tip at all if it wasn't for the tip included with a larger party because he never was at our table it was all these other waiters who were way nicer than him! We are so sad we had such a horriable time because we had high hopes!   UPDATE******* I was messaged very quickly by the business and the man was very very nice he asked to call and talk to me and let him know more about our experience! Great customer service from him!",

    "text": "I was so excited to try this place, and I was very disappointed! First, Open Table had allowed me to make an 8pm reservation at the Chocolate Lounge, but it was closed when we arrived (very strange, but not a big deal). We decided to have dessert at the Sugar Factory instead. We waited for about 10 minutes to have our order taken despite the restaurant being maybe 1/3 full. Not too long of a wait, but longer than I would have expected. However, next, we waited for 40 minutes for our dessert (ice cream cookie sandwich)- I finally caught the manager's eye to ask him if our order had been put in yet (our waiter, Chaz, had not been back to check on us that entire time!). The manager promptly got our dessert and refilled our waters for us. He very kindly went to grab us some spoons for our ice cream as well. About this time, Chaz came back over and had the audacity to ask us if we could use forks for our ice cream or if needed him to get us spoons. The manager was making his way back with the spoons just then, which was good because I don't know how I would have even answered that! If someone orders ice cream, it's always safe to assume he/she wants a spoon!! It felt so condescending! After all of that, the cookie was very dry- the ice cream was good, but the cookie kind of ruined the whole dessert.   When we were ready to leave, I waved my credit card in the air when I saw Chaz waking by to get his attention because he had managed to avoid eye contact with us for so long earlier in the evening. Chaz noticed we hadn't eaten much of the dessert and asked if it was subpar. We told him the cookie was pretty dry/tough, and he said he would let the manager know, but we told him not to worry about it because we were tired and just wanted to go. He just stood there like he didn't know what to do, then he ran our bill. No apology for the food or the wait, no thanking us for coming in, nothing- he just gave us our bill, watched us tip, and left. I gave 20% even though he did not deserve it just because I felt so awkward with him watching!   I appreciated the manager stepping in to fill our waters and get our food when our waiter was no where to be found- he was wonderful. Unfortunately, due to the quality of the dessert and the terrible service, I won't be back. Next time, I'll just grab an ice cream cone to go because the ice cream did look pretty delicious as we walked past it on our way out!",

I've been to the Sugar Factory once before and I came back because of its cute and colorful menu items which make for great photo opportunities and I like the kitsch and hoped the food had gotten better -- but truthfully I find myself disappointed each time with the food prices for the quality.    I bought the $40 Groupon for $29 for 2 this visit, and with the signature goblet drinks running $40 that pretty much uses up your entire Groupon.    So onto the food, it tastes pretty standard, the burger tastes a little less par than a Red Robin burger and the fries are salty and awfully dry.  Yet it's twice the price at $20+ for a burger and fries.",

    "text": "Born out of Las Vegas and now identified as a place to sip gigantic bubbling drinks, eat fun food and spot celebrities from New York to Dubai, it would be hard to say Sugar Factory is not one of the most successful concepts to ever spawn from Sin City, owner Charissa Davidovici somehow managing to turn $30 Lollipops into high fashion frequently spotlighted in Social Media feeds of everyone from Drake and Shaq to a disproportionate number of Jenners and Kardashians.  Originally launched in 2010 where HeXx now resides, a second location at Town Square also opened and shuttered in the interim, Sugar Factory American Brasserie was recently re-introduced at Fashion Show Mall with a multi-million dollar overhaul and several 'grand openings,' a visit on Friday Night showing the space to be every bit as audacious as one might guess, both in terms of the eye-catching decor and the over-the-top menu executed in a kitchen led by Chef Bryan Ogden.  Without doubt a spectacle, the French Brasserie facade and giant Rubber Ducky quickly giving way to walls donned with \"Dots\" and photographs of celebrities as Rihanna 'Shines bright like a Diamond' at about 80 decibels overhead, it was with pleasant greetings that three guests were met at the hostess podium and led to a sizable six-top facing Las Vegas Boulevard, a young man named Erick providing great service throughout a nearly 2-hour evening.  Focused as much on the concept and environment as the food, a 'theme' restaurant in many ways but in general American as relates to the fare, it was after a quick visit from Chef Ogden who was most recently seen at Boca Park's Mixx Grill that a few items were ordered with a request for Bryan to 'fill in the gaps' family style, a brief wait spent watching the NBA Playoffs played on LCDs in back as sparkling candles zigzagged through the room as part of at least seven birthday celebrations.  Attempting to balance A/C with open doors, a tough task as Vegas neared 100F for the first time in 2017, it was after a bit more perusal that the decision was made to invest in one of Sugar Factory's $36 Goblets, the 60oz White Gummi featuring fresh-pressed Juice, dueling Cruzan Rums and a whole lot of Ice served bubbling at the tableside with Gummy Worms laced throughout a concoction that was at first quite sweet before unveiling a more spirit-heavy finish.  Making a low ceilinged first-floor look much bigger by way of crystal chandeliers and a lot of mirrors, the glass doors looking out towards Wynn and an open patio enough to keep the inside feeling secluded yet still accessible, it was after perhaps twenty minutes that savories came forth in back-to-back waves, the first two plates featuring Sugar Factory's spin on Chicken and Waffles with a golden half-bird laid across two crisp waffles tinged in Chives plus a sidecar of Maple-Cheddar Mornay and 3 Fish Tacos flawed by cold Tortillas that fell apart almost the second one tried to pick them up.  Not making any attempt to be a 'serious' restaurant, but rather a fun place for food and drinks in a City made for such things, round two saw Chef Ogden send out Sugar Factory's recently launched \"Rainbow Sliders\" aligned in the same color-order as the restaurant's signature signage as well as \"The Big Cheesy,\" a thick patty of Angus cooked medium-rare beneath crispy Bacon, house BBQ Sauce and a big scoop of Mac n' Cheese-a delicious idea that isn't so weird when you think about the ingredients.  Delving into three \"insane\" Milkshakes, an idea that seems to be gaining a lot of traction recently as restaurateurs put stock in Instagram's ability to drive short-term traffic, Sugar Factory goes all-in with three pages of choices, each seemingly more decadent than the next with the Twinkie Dinkie not dissimilar to drinking Birthday Cake in terms of its taste while the Giggles Snickers is essentially melt-resistant given the thickness created by Cookies, Peanuts, Chocolate Chips and Candybars, the Caramel Sugar Daddy further upping the ante by putting a whole wedge of Cheesecake on top of a Chocolate and Graham Cracker-coated mug full of the taste of a Sugar Daddy infusing a texture almost as smooth as Cannoli filling.  Fully aware that occupation and fascination were in conflict at this point, Sugar Factory proving as appropriate a name as any for a restaurant with an attached Candy shop and Chocolate Lounge upstairs, the meal came to an end by way of three desserts in two waves, items from the \"Gourmet Ice Cream Sandwiches\" section including two rich Brownies wrapped around Vanilla Ice Cream while a hemisected Doughnut was essentially a two-person Sundae with a duo of Sauces, Ice Cream, Fudge and Berries, the Caramel Brownie Bread Pudding served last a contrast of temperature, texture and flavor as the piping hot Brioche and Custard quickly melted Ice Cream and Whipped Cream into a pool around chunks of Fudge and Orange-Caramel Sauce that the youngster in the group likened to the taste of Fruity Pebbles",

The atmosphere is bougie and ornate, but also somehow really superficial; with large chandeliers, bold and dramatic decor, and classic finishes-it's a beautiful space. Then there's the copious tvs with photos of celebs and brand \"whoring\" in your face, along with loud music.   Service was good. Fast and attentive, but it was a mid week lunch service so I can't speak to what a weekend dinner service might look like.   I could see maybe returning for their huge and over the top sundaes, desserts, and fondues for a special occasion but it definitely won't be making it's way into the regular rotation with (extra) overpriced drinks and mediocre food.",

The top half the glass is covered in melted white chocolate and white chocolate shavings. Who doesn't like chocolate?! It looked heavenly and tasted devilly delicious! Each additional glass was only $5. In addition, they had complimentary appetizers to go along with the evening which included  bruschetta, a white chocolate fountain with brownies, marshmallows, and strawberries to with it. Yummy! Only gave 3 stars because the food was only for a limited amount of time and the server did not charge us correctly.",

    "text": "I know that this place is super gimmicky but holy moly, I had an excellent time considering I walked in with pretty low expectations.  First off, our server Marc did an excellent job in making us feel welcome. He explained everything and recommended some of the stronger goblets (maybe my party looked like we could drink?) He was also very professional and took really great care of us the whole time we were there, even though we did not order a whole lot of things.  My lollipop passion goblet was delicious! Yes, it was super sugary but it also packed quite a punch, I shared mine with the boyfriend and still ended up a bit tipsy. The lollipops and the candy bracelet was such a fun touch, Marc even offered me a bag to take my lollipops to go.  I tried my friend's calamari and it tasted so much better than I expected it to be, crispy and the marinara sauce that came with it was delicious, we felt that we had waited too long to receive it considering the place wasnt busy at all while we were there.  A few reasons that makes this place not 5 stars: -The price: I got one goblet drink and an appetizer, $75 ish including a nice tip. That's a little ridiculous in my personal opinion but hey it's the strip and I guess if you got cash to burn, you do you.  -The candy store was all out of their couture pops/refills: besides trying this place out, I was looking forward to purchase some refills and maybe some new handles. I did not see a single one in the storw. It doesn't make sense to me that they could be completely out of what they are known for.",

    "text": "Avoid, avoid, avoid!  We came to this place after seeing an ad for a meet and greet with UFC fighters. The ad also said to contact them for reservations. Naturally, we assumed this meant that to get to see the fighters you would need to be a patron, so we booked a reservation and showed up on time. The fighters, however, did not. They showed up an hour late. And when they did arrive, this place became a circus.  There was no organization whatsoever. We asked our waiter if it was possible to meet the fighters (as we were dining in the restaurant for that purpose) and he said \"they don't tell me anything about what's going on\" and walked away. When we got up and tried to get closer, we were told to \"get in line\" if we wanted a picture....so why did we make the reservation (as the ad suggested) and spend $$$ dining there if we're supposed to line up behind nearly 100 people who weren't patrons? Eventually, we did manage to get some pictures since the process was such a mess that they couldn't really stop anyone dining in the restaurant from doing so.   But I feel really bad for the people who waited hours in line, most of whom were waiting in 40+ degree weather, to meet fighters that showed up an hour late + further delays because people that I assume are friends of the restaurant owners or something got to skip the line to meet the fighters.  To make matters worse, the burger I had was not cooked properly. I ordered it medium-well but received it well-done and charred. The fries were great - at least they have that going for them?  While I wanted to order dessert, the experience left such a poor taste in my mouth that I no longer wanted to contribute to these guys and will definitely avoid them in the future.",

It was different for sure but liked it very much. $20 for 5 mini rainbow burgers and a duck! Hesitant to try but took a risk and boy it paid off!! All the food was enough for 4 ppl when we only had 2! Terri was so kind in bagging up our left overs. Music is loud and hip hop but it fits the funky fun atmosphere. They have a full bar with drinks full of candy that smoke pours out of... can be made w out alcohol. I didn't get this time (have had in the past tho and YES ITS WOTH THE COST!)  Highly recommend for visiting tourists! They have a candy store attached and an upstairs area that's stunning!!  Greeters gladly took pics along w our waitress!! Her alone is worth going again she put our experience over the top.  Stopped to thank MGR and let him know about how everything was wonderful and even the cashier helping in the candy shop was a doll!! A must do again!!!",

    "text": "If it were possible to give something less than one star, I would. If you have a reservation here, cancel it! If you don't have a reservation here, don't make one! I just returned home after an early Mother's Day brunch with my daughter and granddaughter. Between the three of us, we ordered brioche French toast with assorted berries, pancakes with caramelized pecans, and fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp. We asked that the chocolate drizzle and whipped cream be left off both breakfast items. When our food finally arrived, there were no pecans on the pancakes, and the brioche French toast looked as though it had been prepared literally in a toaster rather than on a grill-the crust was completely burnt. How does that even happen on the grill? There were barely 3 edible bites in the center. Additionally, both items had chocolate drizzle and whipped cream on them. Also, the promise of warm syrup is not to be believed. Apparently, only cold syrup exists here. No matter, since both items were barely worth eating. The fettuccine had chicken rather than shrimp and the waiter forgot the garlic bread that was to have come with that dish. Normally, we say nothing and don't return to restaurants if something even remotely close to this happens. Today, I did tell the waiter that the cook was probably going to cost him tips since every dish was wrong. His response was \"I'm sorry, did you want your check now?\"completely amazing. What should have been a delightful once-a -year celebration was completely ruined by the inept performance at this establishment.",

I came in with three other friends tonight and I'd have to say their customer service needs work. Hostess outside was nice enough and promptly sat us down after we requested a \"table for 4\". Our server started off friendly when we ordered 2 $40 goblets. When we let him know we weren't interested in ordering food (it was 11 pm) he became visibly upset and said \"I don't know who sat you here, but this is the dining room where you order food. The bar is right over there\". Uhhh okay? I don't work here, I think that's the hostesses job to let us know where to sit and ask us if we're going to be eating or not. Keep in mind the bar has about 6 seats and they were all taken so I don't know what he wanted us to do. There were also plenty of other open tables, the place was no where near full. He proceeded to bring the check right away and slam it down on the table trying to get rid of us and turn the table. I've worked in the service industry before and I understand he wants to make money but considering our bill was $90 for two drinks that all he had to do was drop off at the table, I dont know what he was upset about. That's no way to treat guests, and we won't be returning. Very disappointed.",

    "text": "First off, my friend and I were walking around yesterday and came across Sugar Factory and were super excited because we thought they no longer exist seeing how the Hexx took its place at the Paris hotel. The host greets us and asks if we want to sit at the outside bar, which we asked if it would be ok if we sit inside seeing how it was super windy and we were cold. He sat us in front of the door which made us feel like we might as well just sat at the outside bar. We tried asking to move, but that ended up making things more complicated. I tried to say it was totally fine, seeing how I do understand how a restaurant and hosting system works due to the fact that I've been a waitress for 7 years and understand that things just can't happen. But then a manager came and said that he was going to have the door closed for us, which made it worse because I knew that was a shortcut for waiters and bussers and tried telling him it was really fine. So the manager did it anyways and told all the waiters and bussers that they had to go around and I could hear one of the waiters talking how over the top it was and that we should just move and even our own waiter was annoyed with us which made me feel mortified. We sat right in front of the door which is right next to the bartender and every time they walked by our table, it was just them talking about us. Now the fun part, our food. My friend got the turkey burger which was super dry and looked like someone sat on it. I got the white chocolate burger and it was like our waiter, rare. It was cold and not even close to cooked. I couldn't ask for them to take it back one because I felt bad for causing so much inconvenience and two because our waiter checked on us once. I really do understand the frustration and patience one has to have in this industry and honestly, my friend and I weren't in a big hurry and would of waited for a different seat and I understand that the reason certain tables aren't opened is because it's a closed off section that's either for the closing shift or someone who's section is cut off due to the fact that they're about to leave, but we asked the host for inside away from the cold and he dropped us in front of the opened door and when we asked if we could get something else he had this attitude that said take it or leave it. Cool. Again, I totally understand when it's busy and you just hope the customer just goes with it, but hey, that's the job; and if you're going to talk crap about a customer, do it in the back, not right in front of them where we clearly can hear you. Of course when I asked for the check, that was when he was super attentive. Probably couldn't wait for us to leave. Check was over $100 for awful food and average drinks. Still left a nice tip because I felt horrible the entire time. So sad that it was so awful, I've been looking forward to coming here once I turned 21 and it was a complete let down. Just another overpriced store, average service, hyped up because it's on the strip. Definitely won't be back.",

One thing he said to the bride was \"one man can't do everything\" and she said \"well my fiance is doing just fine\"....he was sooooo rude with everything, very negative! His name supposedly was Manny (he was a short black/maybe Dominican guy) very rude. It was my first time there and I stayed quiet because I didn't want him saying anything rude to me and I have to snap on him. Anyway, food was good though. He just gave negative vibes the entire time. Closing out was super sketchy too because we totaled everything exact including tax and 18% gratuity that he honestly shouldn't have gotten, yet somehow it came up short and he said \"don't worry, I'll get the rest\" and disappeared after that. Very very weird...and we as servers didn't find that to be normal. They really need to get rid of the bad apples in there because obviously there's service issues from previous reviews.",

I had made a reservation for a party of 13 people a week in advance because I wasn't sure how busy it would be considering my birthday landed on Saturday, July 22nd. I was a bit nervous that the service wouldn't be so good due to the size of party I had and it would take a long time for our drinks and food to get to us but I really wanted to try the drinks and check out this location. Once my family and I arrived the hostess was more than happy to receive us and immediately brought us to our VIP table. This location is beautiful ! The colors and decorations are very nice and the chandeliers add a fancy touch. Within seconds of us being seated our server by the name of Pablo greeted us and handed us the menu to choose from an array of mouth-watering drinks. Pablo was the real MVP. Not only did he come prepared to handle my party but he immediately offered suggestions of what to order and recommended we order food to munch on considering we all wanted the signature goblet drinks. Pablo really went above and beyond for me and my party not only because it was my birthday but he was bilingual and he was able to communicate to my family who spoke Spanish and help them with their orders. After we ordered our drinks came out within minutes and our food came out maybe 10-15 minutes after. Pablo was so nice and fun and attentive in pleasing me and my party. The happy birthday Sunday Sugar Factory provided was so nice and it was such a relief to have Pablo there as our server and he was more than willing to help me and my party and make my visit more than memorable. Sugar Factory and Pablo were the highlight of my birthday.",

BUT, The caesar salad was over priced, the sugar burger didnt have crispy enough onions, and when I was ordering my second nutella pizza, one of the waitresses was looking at my shoes from across the room and saying something mean. I just know it. I also had to wait like 45 min for my bf to get there and I was sooo bored that I just left. I however took a blueberry bikini martini to go and an ice cream sandwich home for my cat and she loved it so... five stars.",

But what really made the experience awesome was the service we got. If you go, make sure to ask for Emon!!",

The goblets is what they are known for, but they are so sugary and priced super high at $38. My friend and I were going to split one, but unfortunately had different tastes. Luckily, I'll be back this weekend so I want to give it another shot...just wish the goblets were priced at maybe $20 less then I'd consider reordering. I haven't heard great things about the food either, but the service was great and store is really fun.",

Drinks are cute but overall it was a major let down...but I should know anyone running a Groupon needs business that was my 1st clue only wished they weren't sold out on Groupon for 2 so I could have paid what it was worth.",

I asked if they did something for a birthday and the guy said \"yes, we sing happy birthday for a 5$ fee only when purchasing a sundae\" I said ok, he seemed annoyed when I called.

I have reservations for the Foxwoods location for a company outing and am currently asking them to relocate.  This is a very expensive place to go, and supposed to be a fun atmosphere but just failed on so many level. They will lose at least 4500$ on our company outing due to this experience.",

It wasn't too sweet or too bitter. I would never have thought it would have been so good coming from a candy store. A waiter walked by with what looked like the most delicious milkshake I've ever seen. The employees were very nice and helpful as well. I will definitely be back to try a goblet and some food...maybe even one of those amazing looking milkshakes.",

We purchased the Sunday brunch Groupon with the \"60 oz\" bottomless mimosas.  Needless to say, I could not finish even one of the monster sized drinks.  For my meal, I had the Chicken and Waffles. Delicious!  We finished our meal with some strawberry ice cream.  This is a great place to celebrate special occasions.   The manager allowed us to go up to the second floor to take photos in the cabana that's used for weddings they have their.  He also gave us a big duck (their mascot of sorts) that our entire party signed with messages wishing us well.  I couldn't have asked for a better experience.  Thank you Sugar Factory for being a SWEET part of our Vegas wedding weekend.",

    "text": "We had been really looking forward to dining here and walked quite a distance just for it. It was our last Vegas restaurant experience on that trip and we expected it to be the cherry on top. It was a HUGE disappointment. HUGE!  I know it's \"Sugar\" Factory, so I won't be complaining about the murdering sweetness of the drinks, though I did feel the entire evening afterwards how that sugar clod was just sitting in my stomach causing uneasy sickness. But that's expected from a candy-themed restaurant, even though a couple next to us returned their goblet due to that very reason.  What I did not expect was that ALL three dishes we ordered (Mediterranean salad ($16),  Buffalo chicken sandwich with fries ($17) and Pacific Salmon ($29)) were unacceptably OVERSALTED. In fact, so terribly that I couldn't eat my salad at all and my husband had to ask them to take it back. My mom couldn't finish her salmon and it's still in the box. I know food is usually oversalted when it's about to go bad, but the salad seemed fresh, so I simply don't understand such unnecessary cruelty on the cook's part. Just.WHY? Moreover, our drinks had no alcohol in them. Like At All. We were told the goblet ($40) would have about 8 shots. 8 shots of syrup, obviously, not alcohol. The other drinks (Watermelon Burst martini and Sexual Chocolate strawberry ($17 each)) were also just that: sugar. No alcohol. For a $130 dinner (the salad was taken off the bill) that's just unacceptable. It spoiled the whole impression from the trip. The entire evening I regretted coming here and polluting my body with all that sugar and salt. For comparison a small restaurant Ocean One Bar and Grille inside Planet Hollywood got us deliciously full and drunk for just $48.64. Three DELICIOUS HEALTHY dishes, 1 appetizer and 7 great drinks! I HIGHLY recommend everyone to check it out instead of this sugary grave.",

I know there was a lot of people waiting to be seated, but come on pressuring people to get up so you can seat more people is uncalled for. Tried once, not coming back.  Ok, so today is 7/14/2018 8pm, Corey gave us a 100$ comp lunch or dinner, since i have left Vegas a few days ago, he said i could use it in a different location, luckily we have one here at The Pentagon mall. First, menu had waaay more choices (which is great) food came out perfect (except for the mac and cheese balls...no biggie). Costumer service at the pentagon branch was awesome, everyone was so attentive, our server Jason and Keith was amazing. The manager dropped by to see if everything is ok. All in all,  will recommend this place. Very nice ambiance, staff are fun! From 2 stars to 4stars.",

The table we sat at had two menus for four people which wasn't an issue until another host walked by with nine menus for a table where three of them were children under 10. We were told to share our two since there wasn't enough. Waited 25 minutes and no server arrived to even offer water....in Nevada. During the summer. We walked out. Thank you for ruining such a special day, but I guess when you overcharge people who believe your ridiculous hype and accept your ridiculous over pricing it doesn't matter that your establishment is horrendous. Avoid if at all possible because there are many more places in Vegas with better food, better prices and better service.",

When we double checked it turns out only milkshakes are included in half off drinks. And at the end they didn't even discount the milkshake until we asked why.  They also wouldn't honor the free appetizer for my Yelp check-in (the was no fine print pointing customers to that fact).  The menu had no prices for the cocktails. The big ones are $42. The food was pretty decent (burger, sliders, chicken and waffles), but the s'mores on the camp fire milkshake we pretty bad because the marshmallows were just a little burnt on the outside, but not even warm on the inside.  The service was slow as our waitress went to mix drinks constantly, so we asked for the check and she brought it 5 min later. Than she took 10 min to come back and another 5 to fix the $10 mistake she made. Then she waved me over to the bar \"do I don't have to wait again\"...  The last kicker: On the receipt they have tipping suggestions: The lowest one is 15% however, of you know math you quickly notice that their calculations are almost double the amount.   I know this is a touristy place and didn't expect much, but if I want to be taken for a ride, I'll go to NY NY.",

So the way they serve their fish bowls with the candy and the dry ice is a pretty awesome concept but the drinks are way too sugary and have a really small amount of liquor so you spend $20 on just presentation which I guess it's what the whole hype is about. The food isn't bad but over priced. The pretty patties are pretty dope too. The waitress was super sweet though, can't remember her name, sorry, but she just moved to Vegas from Houston so of course she was nice.  Oh! They had this fried Oreo fried ice cream dessert that was everything a fat person at heart loves! It's so big a whole family can eat from it!",

And then there's an upper floor with more of a lounge feel.   On the upper level, they were playing pretty good music. It's a nice spot to chill and have drinks and dance without having to go to a club. My friends and I were served complimentary champagne, with white chocolate on the rim and outside top part of the glass; I must say the white chocolate was a nice touch.   I ordered a Peanut Butter Cup Chocolate Martini. It was good considering I'm not a big fan of drinks with chocolate inside. But it also had a good amount of peanut butter too. So if you like chocolate and peanut butter, then go for it.   It was a cool spot, but they only get 3 stars because my friend ordered one of the spicy goblet drinks and it was not tasty at all. It was as if someone randomly poured different alcohols and liqueurs in it and then expected us to drink it.   We decided to send it back, but before we did that, I was like well at least let me eat the cherry gummies that came inside of the drink. Ummm, it was a spicy drink, so those were not cherries. They were gummy hot chili peppers!  That's what I get for being greedy, lol.   Anywho, the waitress was cool about it and we still had a good time. Overall, definitely a place to check out, and they have a really large drink menu, so you're sure to find something you like.",

My friend and I came on a Saturday night. About 730pm. We ordered the fish tacos and the south beach flavor burger. Both were complete disappointments.   Fish tacos: please DO NOT ever order this. This was so gross! The fish tacos had 3 fish tacos with creamy chipotle, lettuce and pico on top. It did not look appetizing when we got it. Sure enough, the taco was super bland. No seasoning for the fish or taco itself. Asked for some hot sauce and some salsa to try and make it better, but apparently they don't have salsa, so the server brought out more pico which was basically just diced tomatoes. We didn't even finish this because it was so gross.   South beach flair burger: not as bad as the tacos but it's regular burger with plantains on it. It was decent but not for the price. Fries were overly salty as well.   I was disappointed to see that their white chocolate burger they once had on their menu is no longer listed as a menu item.   This place has disgusting food. Only reason for 2 stars is for their drinks and desserts.",

Was a experience for sure . For the free appetizer we had fried mac & cheese balls . Was delicious. Bought the kids some stuff in the gift shop. Again super expensive.",

    "text": "So now that my mind is clear and I'm not pissed off anymore. Let me revise this review.  John and Corey both reached out to me via Yelp, which I appreciate.  John was able to refund all the extra charges, YAY!  So in all honestly, this restaurant is OVER - priced but that's all restaurants on the strip. Their Signature Burger is good, juicy and flavorful but I can get the same burger at a cheaper price somewhere else. Their goblets and mixed drinks are too sweet for me, but with a placed called Sugar Factory, sugar is what you will get. I felt my mixed drink didn't have enough alcohol, maybe it depends on the bartender, or the person. I'm a lightweight but still thought the drink needed more booze. I was disappointed that they ran out of their rainbow sliders, since that was the whole reason we came. They did make me blue sliders, which will have you pooping green (TMI :)).   Our waitress, eh, she was always MIA. It's still a cute place to bring your kids because they will enjoy it. So hopefully in the future, I'll be able to taste the rainbow sliders (yah, I know it will taste like the blue ones I got, but hey I need that pretty pic for Yelp)!",

I figured the Sugar Factory would be great so she could get sugar wasted with the cool milkshakes & ice cream sundaes. Our server was pretty cool & chill. A bunch of my friends came to celebrate her birthday with us. We ordered a goblet drink & I had the bleu cheese cheeseburger. You will definitely get sugar wasted here! There are a lot of different milkshakes, goblets, & ice cream sundaes to choose from. My daughter had the tye dye milkshake which was super sweet for me but of course she loved it. I also ordered her an ice cream sundae and paid $5 for each sparkler so they came out and did the whole Happy Birthday song.  I think this is a good place for both adults and kids. I would come here more for the sweets than the food though. I think their food is just average. We also had the rainbow sliders which comes with a free rubber duck to take home. It looks cool but it tasted okay, the top buns were kind of hard. I would still come back but probably only to celebrate a special occasion and nothing else.",

I think they either need to update their menu to reflect the current prices (IF that is the case here) or charge the correct prices. Not sure that I will be be going back, I will probably go to CPK or Maggiano's, both places at least give you your money's worth and the prices match up to what it says on their online menu.",

There was one party of about 8-9 just finishing up..and a few tables with 2-3 people.. there were a lot of open tables.  - PROS Cute decor Clean Pretty chandeliers Good spot on the strip Good parking Extensive menu 3/8 of the food items were good and interesting Cocktails were tasty (but no one got a buzz..lol)  -CONS (which I hate to point out- always makes me feel bad....but here we go..) Wait service not overly friendly, seemed a bit bothered Waited a long time for some parts of our order (fries...water...) Menu items look waaaay better than the taste 5 out of 8 dishes were just really average and not very 'special' - slightly over priced for what they were..  - ITEMS ORDERED **The loaded breakfast hamburger everything thing: Waffle 'bun' with an egg, hashbrown patty, hamburger patty, a large split breakfast sausage, bacon, gravy..etc etc.. 3 people had this and said it was really good.. fries were just plain average fries... lukewarm. ** club sandwich- super average. White bread, avocado, turkey, bacon, tomato... lettuce.. average.  I've had the same flavor/taste size at other chain restaurants. ** omelette with ham, toast, hashbrown-  this was really average.. eggs scrambled with some bits of ham, 2 hashbrown patties like you get at fast food places (minus the paper sleeve) and toast with butter on the side. Dish was cold. :( ** another scrambles egg plate with 2 sausage links, hash browns and toast.. again.. nothing special.. literally plain eggs, average fatty sausages ** eggs benedict with salmon and asparagus- bro in law liked it. Asparagus was fresh...  Overall, an average place for food... a great place for ambiance and pretty surroundings... good creative drinks.... and what looks like amazing desserts.  Cute place. Try it. I'd definitely get something hot off the menu. Avoid sandwich.",

We ordered steak and eggs and also the apple pie waffle. It all looked so good, then we took our first bites. The steak was under seasoned and the potatoes were bland. The waffle was actually really good. Crispy and the sugary.  Our server didn't check on us often, and one of our orders came out wrong. The restaurant was practically empty, so that wasn't even an excuse.   I think this place should stick to the sugary items and leave the savory stuff to the professionals. Totally over-rated place.

Extremely bland.   Regarding the drinks, they are mostly juice. We got 4 of the big cocktail fish bowls with the dry ice and it tasted like sugar and diabetes, no alcohol. You're better off just ordering regular drinks from the bar.  We purchased the groupon so we paid $99 each for unlimited cocktails, food, and fireworks that night. Eating here without a groupon is easily an over $100 check for two; the quality of the food is not worth honestly more than $15.",

The watermelon gobblett  The King Kong  Philly cheeseburger  White chocolate burger Chicken and waffles Chicken Alfredo pasta  I highly recommend the following:   This establishment is known for it's gobblett drinks, virgin or with alcohol. Either way the taste is a burst of energy. It's an item on the menu that comes in different ways, a must try on your first experience. The gobblett is sharable so the price fits the portion, $35.00 bucks.   If you want to put a smile on mine or my girl's faces gimme some ice cream 16 flavors of them with sparkles! The King Kong is presented with all the glitter and glam and is announced with importance! The whole restaurant is dimmed for the King Kong has arrived! All eyes on the King Kong as the sparkles light the way to your table. I tried the coffee, mango sherbet,  and blue bubblegum. The ice cream is lit! The presentation and the taste match its price, $80 bucks.  I left entertained and satisfied!",

I found out when visiting that they usually get a ton of celebrity visitors in Vegas and there are actually drinks named after a few of them (unfortunately one of those celebrity drinks was created and named after Pitbull aka Mr. 305).  That is neither here nor there, we came with a group of us who had gotten a Groupon deal on a couple of the huge Duckie alcoholic slushies and thank goodness we did. The prices are insanely high from what I saw on the menu but for Vegas I guess that is to be expected.   The flavors were decent (I mixed Pina Colado and Rum) and by the time I finished I felt as though I had gallons of liquid in my stomach, I think it's because I actually did. Make sure you prep beforehand if you want to get one of the larger drinks and stay hydrated when enjoying the Vegas strip during or after you consume!",

I recommend coming here for your birthday or bring your kids they won't forget it.  Oh ya and the firework ice cream firework was amazing!!!  I don't know how to post a second review, we came back for our anniversary.  Cory and Edward took care of us this night.  Due to some troubles with staff things were backed up and taking extra time.

    "text": "Sugar Factory is definitely a novelty.  Their elaborate drinks, desserts, and meals are instagram-worthy and will make your followers swoon.  I was tempted by the enormous goblet drinks, but opted for a water to save my appetite (and bank account) for the delicious milkshakes for dessert.  For my meal, I ordered the Farmer burger, which part of their monster burger collection.  It was a unique burger with gravy on top, which was amazingly good.  The burger was huge, so it is worth the price you pay for it.  For dessert, I ordered one of their insane milkshakes and decided on the Caramel Sugar Daddy Cheesecake shake.  These are pretty expensive-- but again, you get what you pay for.  The glasses are coated with various chocolate coatings, which are pretty, but not really functional as anything more than decoration.  My milkshake had a giant lollipop, a piece of cheesecake, and a piece of sugar daddy candy on top-- so it really felt like 4 desserts in one.  One of the shakes even has a bacon cheeseburger on it!  The shake was delicious, but I couldn't finish the entire thing.  If your shake has candy on it, they will package up your candy for you to go if you can't finish it, which is nice.  In summary, this is a place you go for the novelty.  The food is great, don't get me wrong, but the draw is really the elaborate foods.   Be prepared to shell out a lot of money, but it is an experience and is 100% worth it!",

It's a huge restaurant with the dry ice drinks per usual. I feel like the prices are higher here are higher than the ones in DC, but it's Vegas. I got ice cream from here and that was regular price. So that was nice. And it was really good! Huckleberry flavored. My friends enjoyed their apps. Overall good service and great location by the colorful stairs and near Fashion Show",

However is a little kn the pricey side because of the novelty items on their menu and the fact that this is a place where some famous people had chosen to eat and drink! Highly recommend this establishment, everything in their menu looks bomb! So far I  tried their crepes, sliders and omelets and I can safely say that I will definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas to try more of their menu!",

You call and cancelled our reservations and gave a party of 25 LESS than 24 hours to find a new venue. And the employee could only say... sorry? The fact that she even admitted it was YOUR FAULT by not telling us at the time we made the reservation, over 2 weeks ago (and we made them in person), that parties that big had to be booked through your catering department should have been addressed way before today. PLEASE explain to me how this is an okay business practice? You have ruined their Senior Prom. You have horrible policies and your staff clearly needs to be retrained.  I will be waiting for your ridiculous response. Sincerely, Pissed mom",

I never had the chance to visit when it was located at the Paris hotel, so I was delighted to find out there were still locations open at the Fashion Show mall.  Long story short, Sugar Factory is just a better branded Cheesecake Factory that is much more expensive. Their goblet drinks and extravagant desserts are what pull customers in and are really the only things worth trying in my opinion. The Sugar Factory Chopped Salad was not chopped, pretty mediocre and I had to request a different type of dressing to really jazz up the sad greens. The Mango goblet drink was okay.. nothing too special so next time I'll stick to a sugary frozen drink from the strip.  I went during a pretty busy time and our waitress seemed overwhelmed by all the tables, so I felt bad with all my numerous requests for water, etc.  Vegas is pricey so double check if you really want to spend your money here.",

    "text": "My experience here was not the best. My friends and I got a Groupon deal for a four person Sunday brunch where we would get bottomless mimosas and a $24 food credit for our meal. Seeing as almost every dish is $20 in itself, that would work out perfectly for each of us. The mimosas were definitely cool. They're \"bottomless\" as they come in this giant goblet and they put out a sort of magic smoke as the waiter poured the liquid in. Two of my friends got the waffle burger and they enjoyed it, so that was good. My other friend and I both got the Sugar Factory eggs benedict and that was when the problems began.   When they brought out our food, they brought my friend the wrong type of eggs benedict. This one had salmon on it instead of the traditional one she ordered, so she let the waiter know and they brought her a new one. However, this one was void of any type of meat whatsoever. How do you have an eggs benedict without canadian bacon? Her eggs were also really undercooked. In contrast, the eggs on my benedict were completely overcooked and dry. They hardly put any hollandaise sauce on the benedict and it wasn't necessarily a quality sauce either. Our waitress wasn't very attentive as well so we didn't think it was worth it to try and track her down to tell her. I'm sure there are other things on the menu that we might've enjoyed better, but would we come here again? Debatable.  Also, if you get the Groupon deal be aware that the tax and tip priced on the check is based off of the True value of the menu items and unlimited mimosas and not the Groupon value ($120 total for four people). So the taxes and tip were calculated off of an approx. $200 total with $30 in taxes and an expected tip of at least $35 (18-20%). The service we received was not $35 worth for someone who hardly checked up on us.",

It was probably some of the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant, the drink prices were outrageous even for Vegas and the 40 dollar drink we ordered barely had any alcohol in it. So the value was very poor. Our server was very nice but we only saw her twice, once 15 minutes after we sat down and to take our drink order, and then never again until we finally asked for our check about an hour later. I don't doubt she was busy, but this seemed to be the typical service there. In addition because of the allure it attracts a lot of kids and semi-trashy people. If you are looking to spend 40 dollars on a drink, I would look elsewhere for something truly worth the value.",

    "text": "The Sugar Factory is a fun and whimsical place to grab lunch; brunch or insane milkshakes.  I am not kidding about the insanity of the milkshakes; one.comes garnished with a cheeseburger, another is garnished with cheesecake.  There are also a billion choices for rainbow colored, confectionary laden alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.  Many are served in fish bowls and are bubbling due to a small amount of dry ice being put into the drinks.   I had a caesar salad, my children had pasta dishes and my husband had a burger.  It was all passable but I have to say everything was over seasoned.  The fries were delicious but salty enough to cause chapped lips.  Maybe their menu is too large to cook anythinf with precision.  It kind of reminded me of the cheesecake factory in that respect.  The menu was huge!  We enjoyed watching all of the crazy concoctions at the tables around us. The decor was pure whimsy with  chandeliers and an amazing duck shaped disco ball.  Is it even called a ball if shaped like a duck.  Really it was a fun lunch but the food just wasnt that good.",

Drinks were about $15 each so a little pricey. The potatoes that came with the omelet were nice and crispy and the pasta was cooked to my liking. The menu was slightly different than what's online. No pizza or chocolate lava cake, both what I was going to order",

I really wanted to come after seeing the menu of smoking goblets and food offerings online.   I ordered The Drake goblet, which was topped with cotton candy and filled with peachie-ohs gummy candy. I loved it, but it should be served with a spoon to fish out the peachie-ohs! They were stuck to the bottom of the glass. The white chocolate burger was good, but not what I expected. The ganache on top makes the burger difficult to eat. My hands were a sticky mess trying to maneuver through this dish. Maybe it would be better if the ganache was inside the burger. It would kill the visual effect that the restaurant is probably going for, but it would make it much easier to eat. The burger itself also needed salt to balance out the sweetness of the chocolate. It wasn't until the last couple of bites that I tasted any salt on the burger. But the best was saved for last, because those two bites were sweet and salty greatness.  The only pitfall was our server. It seemed like he came around often when we didn't need him, or he was nowhere to be found when we did need him. Overall, it was a great experience, and I would come again.",

    "text": "I would give this place 6 stars if I could! HUGE RECOMMEND!!! The drinks and dessert are awesome and their customer service is the best I've ever experienced! I visited Sugar Factory in NYC a few months ago and was very pleasantly surprised to see that their candy goblet cocktails and massive ice cream sundaes are exactly as over-the-top awesome as advertised!!! I wasn't particularly impressed by the food, but was still very excited to visit the Las Vegas Fashion Show Mall location for cocktails and dessert when I visited LV last weekend. I had seen on Instagram that the LV location hosted a cocktail and dessert buffet on Sundays so I made a reservation for me and my boyfriend back in May. But when I emailed to confirm last week, they told me that the event was cancelled and they had forgotten to tell us. I would have been upset, but before I could even get complain, the customer service rep Bryan offered me and my boyfriend COMPLEMENTARY brunch to apologize! We dined on unlimited mimosas, donut burgers and steak sandwiches, and a milkshake for dessert. Our waiter Rudy made great food suggestions so I loved the food, cocktails, and dessert this time, and Bryan even came to check on us. Hands down the best customer service I've ever experienced! Normally when something is cancelled or a restaurant/hotel makes a mistake, they won't even admit they screwed up. The Sugar Factory went above and beyond to treat us well after the mix-up. The next day my boyfriend and I saw a little Sugar Factory shop in the Miracle Mile shops that gave us a 2-for-1 goblet cocktail coupon so we went back to Sugar Factory in the Fashion Show Mall the next day. Three days in Vegas and two trips to the Sugar Factory. Totally worth every penny and sugary bite!!!!",

My daughter was upset because she ordered her non alcoholic cotton candy drink but unfortunately it doesn't have dry ice! The server said dry ice is to follow after one hour we already finish our drink sadly they still dont have.So that is the highlight shes looking for.  We paid 30$ each drinks without incomplete presentation of it! Not a happy customer.",

    "text": "Not impressed. We came in to have dessert and coffee after our dinner; it was about 40 minutes before they closed. Both the dessert my wife wanted (plain cheesecake) and the one I did (mudslide ice cream sandwich) were 86'd. By the way, it's great when waitstaff uses lingo with customers (sarcasm). So we both ended up getting different ice cream sandwiches and coffee. So we thought. Nope. They were out of coffee. What??? How do you run out of coffee? So we go the SF Cappuccino which is just plain 'ol cappuccino except it's $8 we found out when we got the bill. And it was gross. Extremely bitter. Kinda like me after this visit. The ice cream sandwiches were just ice cream between 2 rock hard cookies that you couldn't cut through. You'd think the cookies would be soft, no? Ya know, edible.   The service wasn't any better. We had to ask for sugar because he didn't bring it with the $16 worth of cappuccinos. He never came back to ask if everything was okay. He seemed more interested in what music was blaring overhead. Then he disappeared for a good 15 minutes while we were waiting for our check. We had to stop him as he walked by to ask for the check. Which then took another 5 minutes for him to bring. And don't get me wrong, it was not busy at all...so there's no reason it should have taken him that long.   So in summary, I do not recommend this location for its selections, desserts or service.",

Unfortunately, it was anything but that. I have never beer treated so poorly in my life. I am a restaurant manager and server myself.   To start our servers name was Alatise. Our party of 11 arrived in three separate groups due to our Uber's we had to take to get there. The first grip of three had been waiting for 20 mins when I had arrived, and they had just got there drinks. After waiting for about 10 mins the server comes over and says \"what do you want to drink\". No hello my name is so and so welcome to the sweet factory. Finally the last group of our party arrived, after another 10 mins I got the servers attention to get the last of the drink orders. His response was \"I will take their orders when you get your drinks\". WHAT?! A good server would have been at our table right away to get the last of the drink orders, and not tell the group they have to wait. After we all get our drinks, once again we had to ask to get our order taken. Asked to order some apps, we had ordered the spinach and article dip to start. The bread was cold and hard, and the dip luke warm. A clear sign it had been sitting in the window. Ask the server for more bread. Took 40 mins to get more. At this point I had spoke to one of the floor managers, she said she would do something special for my sister. Finally my entree came out. The chicken was undercooked. He did take that off the bill for me. After dinner they did bring out a big platter of ice cream sang happy birthday, the mood shifted a bit and we were all happy again.   After dessert we let the server know we will have 4 separate checks. He said I will be back in a few to separate those for you. He did come back in a few, with one check! Then argued that we never told him it was separate checks. So we wrote down what we all got on the back of the receipt. Any server should know to politely say no problem I will be right back to separate those for you. Now we are all very upset again asked to speak with a different manager, he did take 30% off our bill for us. We were there for 3 hours and were treated like a inconvenience, treated rudely, and felt unwelcomed.",

In fact, all of the employees I encountered were friendly. The decor is chic and I found ambiance whimsical as well as inviting. The food was tasty and the shakes were delicious   that coupled with their presentation...This place has mastered the ability to cater to all ages.

We purchased a Groupon for two duck daiquiris but we also wanted to try one of their goblets and it did not disappoint! I'm so glad that they also have a wide variety of non-alcoholic drinks. We had a Fuzzy Peach Penguin Mango goblet that was created by Pitbull and it was so delicious! We kept playing with the cute little penguin gummies lol as for food, we ordered the rainbow sliders and they were perfect! If you order an item on the menu that has a duck next to it, you get a free rubber duck which is so cute! I really wanted to try the Night Owl or The Drake goblet but they were sold out which just means we will have to come back again very soon! We will definitely go to Sugar Factory every time we're in Vegas! Oh and as for the duck daiquiris, they were so cute! We got compliments all night as we walked around with our ducks. We both had pina colada daiquiris which were super refreshing! Thank you, Sugar Factory!",

The service was good. The staff works very well together. If you ask one person for something, a few seconds later someone else would bring it. I do want to shoutout one of the staff would was so sweet and helpful! His name is Richard, I believe he may have been a food runner but secretly I liked him more than my actual server (Shh!) .   I ordered the chicken tenders and fries, basic but a good choice. The other two ladies in my party ordered the chicken quesadilla. There were fresh, a good amount of chicken, however, the taste was very bland. I even tried to add hot cause for a little flavor and they did not solve the issue. I get it, Sugar Factory is known for their drinks not food but the quesadillas was such a let down.",

    "text": "We actually visited the Paris location a couple of years back and remembered that we left pretty happy. Our party of five returned to the Fashion Show location on a Sunday night and we weren't all that impressed. The weekend dining time and atmosphere wasn't conducive for a family dinner and the service was slow and not very helpful with the daunting menu. When we did finally get our food and drink, we did enjoy it, but it wasn't quite enough to save the overall experience.  We were seated immediately for our 7:30 reservation time to a crowded restaurant with very loud music and even louder screaming and yelling echoing throughout the room (listen to my video). We had a lengthy five minute greet which gave those in our party who had not dined at a Sugar Factory before, a chance to review the voluminous menu. When the server arrived, the only introduction we received was her giving us her name and she immediately asking if we were ready to order without any review of the menu or even one suggestion. When she finally took our order, she was unfamiliar with the menu overall, especially my branzino entree and could not even find it on her ordering pad. Service from the bar was exceptionally slow. It was so slow that we received our entrees before we received our goblets. I'll be generous and say it took 25 minutes for us to receive our drinks that weren't appropriately garnished because they ran out of the gummy candy for their Drake, which was their signature goblet.  The menu is about 30+ pages with about 75% of it being flavored alcohol drinks, desserts, and pictures of celebrities. The food is for the most part American and everyone was actually pleased with what they received. I was happy they served the salty, crispy branzino skin side up to contrast the soft, mild flesh. I actually had a taste of my daughter's nutella crepe and it would be a good option for those wanting to stay on the sweet theme for their entrees. Although the goblets did pack a nice punch, when the mist cleared, the overpowering sweetness and the dry ice show were not worth the $38 price of admission for me.  Of course you have to get dessert at Sugar Factory, but our server did not even bring the word up and just dropped off the check. Maybe our $200 tab was enough already and she wanted to just turn the table over? So we paid it and had dessert elsewhere. I have no issues paying $40/person for a meal, but I expect stellar service, not service I would receive at a 24/7 diner. A non peak hour visit, which I would have to debate heavily, would probably result in better service. On the weekend nights, Sugar Factory is best for the large groups celebrating a special occasion, such as a birthday or bachelorette party, where you can get your drink on with foo-foo drinks, be boisterous and happy, and where you might forget about the prices you're paying and the service you're receiving.",

Food was good and came out in a timely manner. We shared an ice cream dessert that was covered with whipped topping and tons of sprinkles.  Biggest turn off was that it's not a clean restaurant. The floor on the second floor was so sticky when I walked in for lunch. I mean disgustingly sticky as in it apparently hadn't been mopped in a very long time. I was thankful to only have to walk through to the elevator that took me to the dining room downstairs. Downstairs was much better as far as being clean.

    "text": "I really can't with this place.   Want to start with the positive - which is that our waiter was super attentive to our large group and definitely tried his best.   The food is beyond mediocre, and unfortunately its not only that, but they also served me raw chicken. I ordered the chicken tenders. I noticed that two of them were stuck together and there was a white sauce coming out of it. Thinking it was just ranch, I pulled them apart only to find out that the chicken was literally raw and uncooked. I wanted to vomit. I immediately alerted my waiter who was super apologetic. They re-brought it out, but at this point I could only take a couple bites cause of fear. After like 2 bites, I look down to discover a long black hair, which is the opposite of my hair color. I couldn't anymore.   IDK if they're just like rushing to get the food out because our baked brie was cold in the middle and we sent it back to make it gooey.   Super health hazard and if I hadn't realized before eating the chicken that it was literally raw, things could've been a lot worse for them",

I'd say the quality is just average, but I really enjoyed the range and imagination that went into the menu.   My husband went with a basic bleu cheeseburger and fries. Dad and I got the Mac & cheeseburger and a BBQ Chicken pizza to share. Again, good portions and creativity. Ok quality.   For dessert - brownie bread Pudding and a chocolate peanut butter shake. The latter wasn't very thick, but had tons of flavor. And the bread pudding is probably croissant bread pudding with chunks of brownie on top (which they forgot and promptly brought out) as well as ice cream.   This was a fun place to visit with family. As anything on the Strip, it was over priced. But very fun!",

It was a nice comfortable atmosphere, except for the loud group across from us. Our service was great we got bottomless mimosas and our server kept them full. They put the dry ice in them so u get the show. I ordered the chocolate French toast with a side of eggs and bacon. Not what I expected but I loved every bit of the French toast. It had so much fresh fruit for every bite it was delicious. Skip the scrambled eggs I should have went with eggs over medium. Bacon was good but I was already full from the French toast and it was super huge. Filled up a box of candy as well. We worth my 94$.",

There was pop music flowing from the speakers and the presentation of the food and drinks is really great, all very Insta worthy.   Do yourself a favor and make a reservation on OpenTable to skip the wait you'll find at busier mealtimes!  The prices reflect this though, so don't be surprised. We had four entrees, four non-alcoholic drinks and one big - but not deluxe - milkshake and spent about $100, tip not included. The deluxe milkshakes are about $20 each and gorgeous alcoholic drinks in huge goblets are $40 and up.  The food was very good and creative. My South Beach burger was tender and flavorful, it had a PLANTAIN on it - sweet - and the milkshake we shared was creamy dreamy perfection.  Our server Manny was also super-friendly and personable. I love a good upscale restaurant that isn't pretentious.   Come here for a special night out, get a giant drink to start and a gorgeous milkshake to finish and don't worry about the pricetag.  Enjoy the hell out of yourself - it's Vegas!",

We were walking around the fashion show looking for a drink and decided to stop and get one of the famous goblets! We came in through the outside entrance and were greeted by a friendly hostess. I was waiting for my friend to return from the restroom and I was very indecisive about where I wanted to sit but everybody there was very friendly and accommodating! I asked to look at the menu so I could decide which goblet I wanted. There's a flavor for anybody and everybody! I love the idea of the candy shop in the restaurant and picking the candies you want in your drinks or desserts. This place is a fountain of fun for the eye. The colors and candies everywhere makes you feel like how Charlie must have felt in the chocolate factory. We decided on the Drake! It was peachy and delicious with sweet tea and cotton candy! The videos do it more justice than my words can. Well it's a little pricey you pay for the whole show and experience you get when you dine here. I need to come back and try food and I sure will.",

The food was much better, we had spinach and artichoke dip, it was a little to cheesy but not bad.  We also had the sampler that came with onion rings that were absolutely amazing and I hate onions, buffalo wings that was not bad, and chicken tenders that was pretty good they were very crispy.  We also had the colorful sliders.  The reason for my three stars is that the waiter seemed like he just wanted us to get in and out and was not very friendly, also the drink was not good!!  The Birthday girl and boy I was with shared it, it was the watermelon goblet.  I think the drinks are more just for show because they aren't really All that good.   Here is my biggest concern because it was two birthdays I asked the waiter to sing Happy Birthday, I had to pay 20$ for a scoop of ice cream a piece, whip cream and a sparkler!!!!!  For 10$ a piece I didn't get a choice of dessert, choice of ice cream nothing!!!!  That definitely needs to be rethought, but as many Birthdays that was happening in there I can tell they made a killing on Birthdays alone!!!!!!!",

She was discriminated against (she's a transsexual) and when she presented her ID the waitress didn't think it was her and gave us a very hard time. Not pleased with how she was treated.

I called again yesterday 10/1 and I tried talking to the manger and she told me that they were to busy and to take my info down I gave her my info and I asked her something and she hung up on me !!
