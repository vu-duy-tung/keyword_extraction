Nice thin crust with just the right amount of toppings.  Not overloaded with just a bunch of stuff just to make it bigger.  Time from pizza creation to table was about 15 min.  We got 2 pizzas and 2 reg drinks and paid ~$21.  Not too bad for getting something pretty good quickly and not feeling bloated and stuffed when you are done.  I will definitely recommend to others and will return.",

I guess they're losing out on some major revenue because I'm sure I'm not the only one. Someone didn't do a very good job on the ordering.  Also I wanted to order online but you have to pay first without the option to redeem a gift card or buy gift cards.",

What i loved was the fact that the seating is spaced out very well.  The easily could have crammed in more seats, but it was really open.  When you walk up there is a list of potential pizzas as well as toppings.  Similar to a Chipotle you then go down the line and build your pizza.  I tired a couple sauces.  I enjoyed the red sauce, which was slightly sweet.  They also had a spicier sauce which I honestly was not a fan of.  I liked the heat, but whatever they use to cause the heat did not work with me.  After having our pizza built about five minutes later they were ready to eat.  Decent sized pie for $6.99.  Loved it was a thiner crust, and did taste incredibly fresh.  I certainly look forward to visiting again, and trying their cheese sauces as a pizza base.  This is a wonderful concept and would be amazed if even more do not spring up.",

I had the red vine, which could have used a little more cheese but I could have asked for that for no extra charge.  My husband had the Link In with pepperoni, he said it was \"meaty\".

It's sad the rest of the employees seems really descent but this young man and the manager has THE WORST customer service.  I will tell my friends not to come here.  So owner of this location if you're reading this teach your manager customer service.  It's the manager who's working at around 2:00 pm.

It's just like going to Chipotle, you order what sauce you want and move along and you tell them what meats/vegetables/cheese you want on your pizza. The pizza is original crust and it taste good.The service is great and the atmosphere is great as well. It's spacious in there, lots of room to sit if you have 2-10 people. You can dine in or take out.",

    "text": "So I've been here multiple times and have always had good service and great pizza. However, tonight was the exception. I ordered and paid online and when I checked in they said that they would fire my pizzas. After reminding them twice and waiting for half an hour, I finally got my pizzas. There were people that came in after me, who received their pizzas, ate and proceeded to leave the restaurant before I even received my pizzas, that I ordered online and paid for ahead of time. No one could figure out who was making online orders and come to find out, my premade pizzas were sitting in the rack the whole time! Their lack of organization and communication needs to improve drastically! They even lost two other peoples' pizzas and had to have them reorder and remake them. I hope they improve because the pizza is really great but the service needs to improve!",

I couldn't decide between the Red Vine or White Top specialty pizzas, so a worker mentioned how you can do half-half... One pizza on one side, and the other. One specialty pizza has 6 slices. It was so good I finished it in one setting.  The ingredients were fresh. They have a variety of vegetables and meats. They prepare it in front of you and place it in the fire oven. I requested they put pesto all over the top of pizza after it was baked. You can also request for them to make your own pizza if you don't want the speciality kind. They utilize the production line teamwork like Subway. I was also impressed at how affordable it was too for the satisfying taste quality. I will definitely come here again.  I have already recommended it to my friends. This place is great!",

You're not allowed to carry it to your table yourself.  I know I've ordered beer at Chipotle and they give it to you right at the counter.  Maybe the liquor laws have changed in the last few months or something.  Anyway it's a great place with reasonable prices.  Just don't like the hassle with the beer & wine.",

At Blaze, you can forget that sharing is caring and order your own personal size pizza for under $10. What I love about this place is that pizzas are fully customizable, or you can opt in for their signature styles. There dozens of toppings and sauces, plus three types of dough: traditional, gluten-free, and high-rise. If you want a \"lighter\" pizza, go with the traditional; it's a thin and has a crunchy crust. The high-rise will no doubt fill you up. After pizzas are made, they're slid into a fiery oven and cooked within minutes. Unlike other pizza shops in town that operate on a similar concept, my pizzas have always been baked to perfection -- never undercooked.   The ordering process is painless. Despite the occasional long lines, the wait time is short. Hate lines? Place an order online -- too bad they don't deliver.",

Just be ready to constantly ask \"huh?' or \"what was that?' because it's pretty noisy in there, it's difficult to hear anything. On a positive note, I've become increasingly good at reading lips lol. They do get points for always being very clean and everyone is friendly. The kids love it, so we visit fairly often.

She was also a bit short with us but not nearly as bad as she was being with the other two.  It was very obvious the guests were getting aggravated trying to order their food and she was replying what seemed to be very sassy remark's. Even after the two young gentleman received their food she continued out onto the floor and actually touched his wallet and his cell phone while they were eating. She was totally harassing them while they were just sitting quietly trying to eat their dinner. I think that management needs to intervene and teach Maria and maybe coach her a better way on how to speak to guests and how to keep her hands to herself.

The crust is thin crust and it is super flakey and scrumptious!  My friends got the green stripe last time and she said the pesto was too oily so I shy-Ed away from that. I'm all about the meat. I got a meat eater pizza with extra blue cheese, while garlic, sauteed mushrooms, red peppers. My friends got the white top.  Total after taxes it was about 8$.

The Blaze concept mirrors another well known burrito place based in Denver Colorado.  You start by waiting in a usually waiting in a line with at least 10-15 people.  Don't worry it will move fast and it is well worth the wait.    1st choice- sauce traditional red, white cream, or spicy red 2nd choice- cheese- mozzarella 2 types, parm, goat, feta, goat, or gorgonzola or vegan cheese 3rd choice- meats - sausage, pepperoni, meatballs, ham, bacon, chicken, and turkey meatballs 4th  choice- veggies - artichokes, olives, kalamata olives, banana peppers, onions, cherry tomatoes, basil, spinach, garlic chopped or roasted, mushrooms, pineapple, oregano, and red peppers. and I am sure there is more.    Your delicious masterpiece goes into the oven and if you like it can be finished with 5th choice - Arugala, bbq sauce, pesto, or olive oil.    Any way you build your own it will be AMAZING!!. For just $7 and some change.  They offer some of their own concoctions so you don't have to do the brain thinking in a high pressure environment because it feels like you are holding up  the line while building your pizza.  Either way Blaze Fast-Fire'd Pizza is awesome and I cannot wait to go back.",

The ingredients always seem stocked/fresh and the pizza always comes out so fast and taste the best. This is probably one of my favorite places to eat.   The soda is always so crisp and fresh, I swear their great plastic cups make the drinks taste better.  Oh and my pizza of choice, the build your own, thin crust, white pesto sauce with chicken and spinach, sea salt and oregano! You must try it!!",

My husband and I will be returning at least twice a month!!!!! It's that good y'all!!!!",

    "text": "Cue the sad trombone music.  After being an avid fan of this location for years (despite only writing a review this year-oops) I had an awful experience on April 2nd around 11:30. Nuvia was assigned to making our pizza. She mumbled the whole time so we couldn't hear her and wouldn't repeat herself when asked. We were splitting a pizza 50/50 and she didn't disperse the toppings evenly-we had to ask her to redo the meat as the \"half\" with pepperoni had about 9 pieces of pepperoni covering two or three bites right on the crust. They were out of cherry tomatoes (which I know isn't her fault), but the BLT salad had cherry tomatoes. That leads me to question when the salad was made if they didn't have any fresh tomatoes...Speaking of the salad, it's already pre-made and just needs to be boxed up when you order it. It wasn't given to use when we paid, or when our pizza was ready. I had to go ask Bob, the cashier, for our salad. He asked Julia if she had made that salad yet, to which she responded \"LOL NO\", literally laughing at him as I'm sitting here waiting for the salad 15 minutes after we ordered it. Julia finally boxed the salad up, but then I had to wait for them to find a container to give me dressing. They were totally disorganized. There were probably 8-10 people behind the counter and a grand total of 6 customers who had all ordered at separate times and they couldn't get it together. Another gem of this experience? There was a new girl training and I overheard them telling her that secret shoppers are older people and to treat them differently, cater to them, etc. Oh, ok! Good to know that those of us who aren't \"older\" get sub-par service because there's no chance we're secret shoppers. Such a joke. It will likely be a while before we head back to this location. Yesterday's visit left a bad taste in my mouth.",

Crisp, chewy crust with a variety of quality toppings (goat cheese, gorgonzola, fresh basil, minced garlic), ready super-fast with great service, for a low price (under $8/each) and sized large enough to have a couple of pieces leftover.  On opening day, they were super busy but every employee was peppy and positive. In addition to the pizzas, they also have some small salads and desserts (ask for the s'mores to be heated in the oven!).  Highly recommend adding pesto drizzle to your creation after it bakes, a vibrant and flavorful version generously applied.",

The environment is awesome, they play great music, and have accommodations for sitting inside or outside.  We live in the area and go to Blaze relatively consistently, but the last few times our food was not satisfactory. We got two build your own pizzas to go last night. The dough was floppy and not fully cooked, to the point where we had to put it back in the oven when we got home. We also had to re-cut our own pizzas because the person cutting them didn't slice effectively. Our pizzas have turned out this way the last three times we went to Blaze. Over all, we continue to return to Blaze in hopes that our experience will be better.",

Kinda steep for lunch but it was some of the most delicious food I've had in Las Vegas.    For one price you get unlimited toppings!!! I really like that.  Some of the competitors charge upwards of $1 per topping (I'm looking at you, Novecento).  And they have a LOT of toppings!!  Even fancy stuff like fresh arugula and sea salt.    And get this...the staff actually looked me in the eye and smiled...and most of them even looked like they bathed that morning.  Amazing.  First, you pick your crust, then sauce, then cheeses, then meats, then other miscellaneous toppings.  You pay and sit down and then they'll call out your name when your pizza is ready.    Also, to-go boxes, parmesean cheese, red pepper flakes, and forks are sitting out so you don't have to ask for them.   They have high chairs for the kiddos.  The decor is really trendy and clean.  I think I've found one of my new favorite places to eat.",

You heard me out and took initiative to make things better.  I really want you to know you are a great asset to Blaze and you are appreciated.   Thank you so much for making my dining experience even better this evening.   A thanks to Johnny who when there was a problem with the order he was very accommodating.

This evening the computer system was down and this is the 3rd time we have been impacted by this.  There was no communication to the customers and the team members not once apologized for the more than 20 minutes of delay.  The lines were long and you have got to figure how to better manage this issue and have a backup in cases like this.  We are a family of 5 that only got cold pizza and no drinks until the system came back up.  I suggest you show appreciation for your guests and apology when your establishment creates a less than desired circumstance.",

He handled a gluten free pizza with utmost attention to detail: using new gloves, new cutter, etc. Both Brittney, Jon and Courtland have great attitudes and superb customer service as well. Invest in their personal development and leadership training (better to retain than acquire)!",

I work right across the street so i can see when it isn't a busy time to come in and get my meal. When anyone walks in the first thing you should get is a greeting and fast service, especially in a place like this. On occasion ill walk in when nobody is in line and see a bunch of the young employees touching each other and messing around in front of everyone or get several deer in the headlights looks and nobody jumping to take my order for what seems like minutes because they all suddenly have something else they got to do. Other then that its a nice, fast paced dine in.",

The entire room is designed with flat noise reflecting surfaces. That plus the big man handing out the pies at the end of the line is screaming people's names at the top of his lungs. Unnecessary loud. The pizza was good, fairly typical of the Chipotle style pick your topping pizza. We will probably not return based on the big guy bellowing names and making everyone else try to yell over him. Too much of a distraction to try and enjoy a meal. Would not recommend unless you like uncomfortably loud restaurants.",

I ordered classic red sauce with mozzarella and ricotta cheese with salami, bacon, mushrooms, artichoke, and oregano. They cooked it right away and the taste and flavor exceeding my expectations. This place knows how to make pizza and it tastes flavorful. The pizzas have about six slices. I really enjoyed the blood orange lemonade they served. I will definitely be back for more soon!",

While there are \"signature\" pizza options, this looks like it's more of a build your own pizza spot- you start at one end to get your crust/dough, and move down a long line of toppings and let 4-6 people know what things to go ahead and add before they throw it in a wood fired oven for a few minutes. What floored me was that the build your own pizza was under $8- with all the toppings your want! Most places start with plain cheese and charge you per topping. I think the plain cheese Simple Pie is $5 and a 1-topping is $6 and some change. The place is clean and well organized.   My pizza had red sauce, mozzarella, ricotta, turkey meatballs, spinach, roasted garlic cloves, artichoke hearts, and olives- and it was amazing!! Filling, too - I only managed to finish about half of it (which means you can share... unless you and your friend can't agree on toppings).  I also grabbed the Tomato, Basil, Ovalini side salad $4- like a caprese with lots of greens! The favors were on point, and again I couldn't finish the whole thing.",

They have a large selection of meats, cheeses, and veggies to create your one of a kind pizza masterpiece. My favorites are the Italian meatballs, fresh ricotta, roasted garlic cloves, and their roasted red peppers. To help wash down your masterpiece try their strawberry and mango agua frescas. Blaze is an overall great place for a casual dinner or weekend pizza run. The staff are always welcoming and have your pizza to you quickly even when the place is extremely busy.",

    "text": "We are big fans of Blaze.  The first time we ate here, I was kinda skeptical about the whole concept: a Chipotle of pizza, right?  Well, after devouring my first 180-second fired pizza, I became a Blaze believer.  First of all, the price is right for the Build Your Own Pizza, where you can add as many toppings as you want for $7.65.  Their Signature Pizzas, where the ingredients are already laid out for you, are also only $7.65.  I like the Veg Out, Red Vine, and the White Top for these.  Secondly, well, the pizza comes out fast!  And, thirdly, they are delicious, not at all greasy.   This location is only two exits away from us so it makes it easy to get here and get our Blaze fix, which we've been doing at least once a week now.  The staff is super friendly and even if there's a line, it moves fairly quickly, plus you know your pizza will be ready in no time.  I usually can't finish the six slices that each pizza has, so my pizza is good for two meals, making my money go even further.  I'm lovin' it.",

Ran out of white sauce & tomatoes. Guy on expo station that cuts the pizza- we asked twice to cut our pizza in squares. The first time, he literally cut the pizza once, in half. Boxed it up and gave it to us. I opened it up, saw it, went back over to him and again nicely asked for it to be cut in squares or at least cut in a way that we could actually eat it. He cut it in triangles. Lol  Don't get me wrong, I'm still going to blaze for all my pizza cravings, but screw this location.",

I understand sometimes it's hard to keep up but last night they had no reason.  Behind the counter was probably 10-12 young adults talking and laughing and the restaurant was filthy.  The lines were the shortest I've ever seen but instead of cleaning up the staff felt like joking in the back was more important.  I gave it 3 stars because this is the first time I've had a bad experience here but it was definitely upsetting.",

    "text": "When staying with friends for the week in North LV we opted for ordering a batch of pizzas for dinner - five adults and three children.  Blaze was a recommendation from our friends as a good local pizza shop who had a variety of specialty pizzas as well as gluten free options (our friend's family has dietary restrictions).   We ordered a variety of pies including the Art Lover and Red Vine. I enjoyed the size of the pizzas since they were small enough for each adult to have their own. I also liked that their dough was perfectly cooked and their sauce wasn't overwhelming - two things I always judge aside from the toppings and service.   Overall, Blaze was good - but only just good. We're spoiled with Pizza Man Dan's back in Ventura so this place didn't quite satisfy that pizza craving we were hoping for. The toppings were simple on both pizzas and nothing special to note about either.  I don't doubt that dining-in customers have different experiences, but for pick-up, and the pizzas we ordered, they were just okay.   Perhaps we'll have to try them again the next time we're in town!",

By the time I paid for our pizzas and got our drinks the pizzas were done. They are thin crust, so they cook fast in the high temperature oven. Our pizzas were well done and crispy, just the way I like them. If you don't like them well done, then you might want to mention that before they go in the oven.  $8.00 for unlimited toppings on an 11\" pizza. Well worth the money and worth the drive from Summerlin. This is arguably one of the best pizza places in Vegas. I will be back and I recommend that you give it a try.",

They load up the toppings and you still get a crispy crust on your pie, even the very first bite at the point.  The kids that work here really know what they are doing. The first time we went was on Pi day (March 14) and the line was out the door! The staff did great, no one was giving attitude or having a meltdown. They even had someone offering water to people out in the sun. Once you get up to order, no one gives you an eye roll or anything if you want a lot of toppings. And when in the oven, your pie is ready in just a few minutes.  Blaze's pies are a bit larger than Pieology's also. Usually I can finish a Pieology pie in one sitting. At Blaze we each took home 2 slices and they even have a huge pile of to go boxes ready to go. And reheated, crust still awesome!",

    "text": "How To Basics:   Personalized pizza with the build as you order concept. You order what you like and they build your pizza in steps (made-from-scratch crust, Sauce, Cheese, Toppings then they bake it). Think Chipotle or Subway. Got it? Good. Easy, quick, and damn delicious.   Cost:   $7.65 per individual pizza with as many toppings as your heart desires. Load that puppy up and have no regrets. I love the flat rate and that they are generous with their toppings. No charging you an arm and a leg to add extra cheese/sauce/veggies or whatever artisanal ingredients you top your pizza with. They will pop it in their oven and it will be ready to go quickly. Crispy, crunchy and delicious.   Taste:    My husband and I have been here twice and we LOVED it!  I ordered their  'VEG OUT' both times. The Veg Out has zucchini, mushrooms, red onion, mozzarella, gorgonzola, red sauce dollops. I loaded up more veggies: artichokes, chopped garlic, red onion, roasted red peppers and spicy marinara sauce.   My husband orders their 'MEAT EATER' that includes pepperoni, crumbled meatballs, red onion, mozzarella and red sauce (he also throws extra veggies on his.. Cuz' why not?!). We even had them cook it 'well done' so we had an extra crispy crust.   Final Thoughts: Quick, easy, convenient and fresh. We're in and out with our 'tum tums' full of 'Blaze' goodness. We enjoy their pizza and plan to keep this on our lunch rotation.  Yelp Review #4  2016",

We ordered 1 cheese pizza for the little one and a build your own for me with spicy marinara sauce, mozzarella and Parmesan cheese, ham, spinach, olives and mushrooms with a sprinkling of oregano plus a fountain drink then you watch them slide your pizza in the oven. All in all we paid $16....not bad. Not even 8minutes we got piping hot pizzas. Both are medium sized with thin crust. My little one swears this is the best cheese pizza she has ever had. Mine was yummylicious! I might never eat pizza anywhere else again.  Funny thing is this place is just across from the newest LVAC on Decatur. Ha! We will be back!",

    "text": "I LOVE Blaze pizza! That's where the 3 stars come in- good thin crust, a bunch of topping options, and good beverage options (coke products and lemonade that is stellar). Plus, they offer vegan options. However, my major complaint is the mobile service. Each time I've mobile ordered (at least half a dozen times this year), my pizza has come out at least 10 minutes late. I understand there are peak times but when I select a time on mobile order, I expect my pizza to be done then. I also expect that when I go in and ask about my pizza I don't get the response of \"we've only got one person\". If you're offering a service, you need to staff and abide by that service. This dissuades me from going to Blaze more often. If they fix this issue, I'd happily change my review to 5 stars.",

I tried ordering ahead because I was stuck for time, and I ended up waiting longer than I would've had I just waited in line. The pizza is supposed to be made and just waiting for the oven. In my case, my pizza was sent to the back of the line when I showed up to \"check in,\" 5 minutes before my pizza was supposed to be finished, because no one had made it yet. It wasn't crowded at the time I was there, either. Not to mention, my toppings were few and far between! I'm assuming this is because I wasn't peering at them through the glass as they made it, like I've been before when the toppings were much more generous. I will certainly be back for more pizza, just never ordering online again.",

We enjoyed being able to point and pick out whatever we wanted on our pizza that was being made in front of us. We went to check out and got a couple of s'mores for dessert and the cashier said we can just come back for them when we were done so they can heat it up for us, so nice. The pizzas were pretty good. I really liked the crust, it was really light and crispy. The toppings were a bit bland but you can't complain much when it's so cheap lol the guy on the floor was constantly cleaning tables and he came and asked us how everything was and took our plates. Finally it was time for the s'mores for dessert and they were delicious. We had a good time there and left feeling full and satisfied. I'm glad this is close to my parents house, it's a great go to place for a cheap, quick, and yummy meal.",

    "text": "I've been to this location a few times in North Las Vegas, and up until today the service and the pizza has been amazing. Today, I would classify, as one of the worst experiences I've ever had regarding customer service. I'll further expand on this by saying that Jared (or Gerald), who is the General Manager is by far the most unprofessional manager I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with. Based on his attitude and behavior, I'd say that the mantras of your Management Training Program are \"The Customer Is ALWAYS Wrong\",  and \"The Only Way To Hold A Conversation Is Through Being Argumentative and Impossible\". Here's the gist: I placed an online order tonight. It's the first time I've ever used your app to order (I've got some feedback on the app if you would like to hear it sometime). I was actually happy to see that when I placed my order, the app stated that my pizza would be prepared, but wouldn't be fired until I checked in with the cashier. I thought this was a great touch, cause my pizza would be piping hot when I got it!! I ordered three Build your owns. The only special instructions I had on one of the pizzas was that I wanted pesto on the crust. Yum! I selected that I would be at the restaurant at 8:15. Sadly, I didn't get there until 8:21.  When I walked in, I went to the cashier, and signed my receipt. I hung out, and waited for my pizzas to come out of the oven. After a few short moments, one of the guys working the station where the pizzas get cut and boxed, turned around and grabbed three pizza boxes from the top of the oven. The other gentleman called my name and handed me the boxes. I'm my past experiences, the person opens the boxes and shows you the pizzas. I've always thought this was a nice touch because it gives you a chance to chance to check your order. This didn't happen. I stopped at a table and checked my order. Two of the three pizzas were supposed to be finished with BBQ Sauce. Sadly, they weren't. I headed back to the counter and the gentleman fixed the discrepancy.  As I grabbed the boxes, I found it odd that the pizzas had been pulled from the top of the oven, and they felt lukewarm, not hot.  Unfortunately, I had other food in the car, and a diabetic girlfriend at home that had already taken her insulin shot and had to eat soon, so I wasn't able to do much about it. I drove home, which is literally 5 minutes away (Though my maps app says 7...guess I'm a little heavy on the gas!). When I got into the house my suspicions were confirmed. The pizzas were not hot. They were actually to the point where the ovalini mozzarella on two of the pizzas was thick and stiff. It was a letdown. So I decided to call the store and ask why my pizzas were fired before I checked in. After about 5 or so minutes, I was able to speak to Jared (or Gerald). The very first thing I asked him was if the app says to check in so your pizzas would get fired, the. Why were mine cooked and sitting on top of the oven. This was where things quickly went downhill. The first thing he said is \"If your pizzas weren't ready when you walked in the door, then you'd be complaining about that too\". I was really caught off guard by that comment. I told him I didn't Ming waiting the four or five minutes it takes to cook the pizza to get it fresh. He then said \"Your order said ASAP on it, so you indicated that you wanted them right away when you ordered them\". I told him that I did no such thing. He then said \"All I can tell you is that you need to pay more attention when you're ordering your pizzas to make sure you don't put ASAP in the special instructions\". I again told him I didn't do that. I told him that the only special instructions were that on one of the pizzas I asked for pesto on the crust. He then said \"Well someone at some point put in your order that you wanted them ASAP\". I told him again, that I never used the app before, so that wasn't possible. His tone and demeanor continued to decline and it got to the point where I couldn't even talk. He kept cutting me off and accusing me of some wrongdoing. Eventually, I just asked for a District Managers Name / Phone Number. He then told me I could file a complaint on the companies website. He also made it clear that I needed to make sure that you knew the ticket said ASAP, as if to continue to imply that I was in the wrong.  I was beyond furious at this point, for several reasons. Needless to say, I have contacted the company via email & Twitter. I can only hope that they do something with the Manager at this location.",

    "text": "So THIS is the place everyone has been calling the \"Chipotle of Pizza!\"   Upon entering Blaze Fast Fire'd Pizza, I was hit with the most lovely pizza smell and I knew that I was in for a treat. The decore and atmosphere is quick casual, similar to that of Chipotle. We dined in and I wish it hadn't been so windy so that we could have dined out on the patio.   If you're on a time crunch, be sure to snag a menu at the start of the line to get an idea of what toppings you may or may not want. There are a few standard pizza options for you to choose from or use as a base to your own creation. You have about 3 crust types to choose from and from there, no topping is off limits.   I used their Red Vine as a base for mine and added pepperoni, turkey meatball and artichoke... it was SO GOOD! I loved that their crust was a little more crisp than what I was expecting (800 degrees type crust, a little dough-y). I want to clarify that the crust was perfect as I enjoy a little crunch. The toppings were all fresh and you can see that from the line. The cook time was no longer than 10 minutes, I want to say.   Great place to check out if you're a pizza person like me. :)",

    "text": "I finally got around to stopping by this spot for a quick late lunch. It wasn't as busy as it usually seems to be when I'm in that shopping center. The staff could've been a little more attentive especially since there was so many of them and I was the only customer at the time. They were discussing their personal lives while I was trying to order and I had questions regarding their menu. They didn't seem to really be helpful so I winged it with my choices and 2/3 were good enough!   Regardless, the food was great! I definitely won't get white one again though. It throw my taste buds off. The combination of the greens and garlic and white sauce did and chicken bites weren't up to the other pizzas we got. Usually, I'm a fan of white sauce, too. The veggies and BBQ chicken were winning in my book! They over did  the veg pizza and the whole crust and bottom weren't burnt. I'll definitely check my order before I leave next time.    Overall, if your looking to spend around 8 bucks on a quick personalized 6 slice pizza on the northwest side of town this may be your new spot. The dine in sitting was next and spacious as well. With some better service this could be easy 4-5 star rating joint!",

Think of Blaze as Pizza meets Chipotle...pick from original or gluten-free dough...then the sky's the limit from there!! Pick white, red or spicy red sauce, choice of cheeses, choice of meats (or all the meats!!) excellent choice of veggies ( I recommend the roasted garlic and artichokes) then it gets quick fired in an oven in no time!   Love that this con pet has finally come to fruition and that it's available here on the northwest side of Vegas. Stay tuned for updates because I will be back!!!",

I always get barbecue for my sauce and every time I tell them that, I always sense a bad attitude. I'm not sure what the big deal is. Do you have to pre-prep your sauce or is it because you have to walk \"so far\" to the other end of the counter to get the bottle of bbq sauce? Regardless, it isn't a huge deal for a worker to get upset.   At this location, I love going in and seeing this amazing guy named CHASE. He is always up beat, enthusiastic, smiling, and giving such a positive experience every single time I go in. I don't see him as much but when I do, it's nothing but much respect and positive vibes exchanged.",

    "text": "I'm a forever pizza lover. And after eating at BFF- I am hooked. The build your own concept is not a new one: Subway and Chipotle had the market for awhile but watch out, there is a new kid in town.  One tip- know your order before you get up the the counter. People are anxiously waiting in line and when you can't decide and take too long, it makes others (myself included) get a little hangry.  The first time ordering can be a bit intimidating, but you will quickly get the hang of it. They will walk you through the process. I love how quickly the pizza comes out and how crunchy, crisp, and thin the crust is. I call it a pizza cracker. There is a build your own option or a few a popular pizza combos.  We ordered 2 BYO and one drink and it was under 20$. I took a few slices home to eat for dinner. I left feeling satisfied but not overstuffed and greasy which is a good thing.  I liked that there was an employee working the dining room. She cleared tables, wiped them down, and asked how we enjoyed our meal and if we needed anything. A nice extra touch.  I would warn this place is LOUD so don't come here for an intimate date. There are tables outside but eating near all the cars in the parking lot is really not my idea of enjoyable.  Yay to a great pizza option in LV. * I would like to see all employees wearing hair nets under their hats. Also the hair needs to be pulled back under the hat- so many ladies had pieces of hair dangling out from underneath- too close to the pizzas and ingredients. :/",

    "text": "I have been eyeing this place waiting for it to open and it finally has! Hubby and I stopped by for dinner a few days ago during the grand opening and a nice girl at the door gave us both BOGO coupons. There were a few tables occupied, but no long line like some of my friends faced when visiting during grand opening week. They have a good amount of tables inside and they also have some tables outside. After looking over the menu and placing my order, I watched the pizza artists work their magic making my pizza and I was impressed with the variety of toppings offered. Pizzas are made in 180 seconds once in the oven and are all $7.65 each plus tax and you can choose from one of their signature pizzas or build your own choosing the cheeses and toppings you like. I ended up liking my pizza a lot and came back for dinner tonight. Service was just as friendly and I again enjoyed my pizza.   Build Your Own - I chose classic red sauce, shredded mozzarella, ovalini mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, mushrooms and pineapples. The sauce was good as the toppings. I really liked the thin crust that was chewy yet perfectly crisp.  Art Lover - This is one of their signature pizzas with artichokes, mozzarella, ricotta, chopped garlic and red sauce dollops. The crust was consistent with my previous visit and I again enjoyed my pizza. The only problem with this pizza for me was that I tasted no garlic. It's possible it was forgotten when the pizza was being made, but garlic is a flavor that stands out and it was hiding this time, boo!   You can get your food to-go like I did and you can also place your order online. I'm a fan and will be back to try other pizza creations :)",

I didn't like the already made salads that were very overpriced and quite small and flavorless.  I didn't like how when trying to ask for toppings to be placed on my veggie pizza the girl kept asking after each and every topping, \"are you done?\" And that question began after topping #2! I didn't like how they offer only ONE size pizza and NO option for even a smaller size for kids. That means share a one topping pizza with my picky 9 year old or get more pizza then we really need. I chose to go for more pizza thinking leftover pizza would be welcome later. Well, to my surprise, that thin pizza doesn't really fill you at all so my 9 year old ate her entire pizza in one sitting. My husband and I shared a pizza and I had two very small slices and the above mentioned flavorless salad. Total cost of meal....just shy of $30. The one thing I liked.... My pizza didn't come out burnt to a crisp! Trust me, I saw two other pizzas that didn't fair so well!",

    "text": "I believe in second chances. I tried another Blaze pizza after having been extremely disappointed with the no cheese, veggie pizza I ordered the first time there a couple of weeks ago. This time they got it right - plenty of veggies and they prepared it with love!  It was very tasty. I wish I had taken a picture of the bare pizza I received two weeks ago to compare it to the one I got this evening. Night and day difference. One thing to note - my husband did have to ask for extra veggies.  Thank You to Blaze management for caring about customer feedback. It's good to know that owners are keeping up with what customers are saying about their product. Thumbs up!",

    "text": "Went there last night after someone had told me how great it was, I placed my order online so that way all Id had to do was to check in and they would fire up my pizzas. Well over 20mins goes by and my name hasn't been called came to the point where I start seeing people that came after me get their food already. So my husband goes up and asks them where the order is since their oven cooks your pizza in 180 seconds and we have been waiting for over 20mins, I guess someone forgot to fire them up. So we had been waiting that whole time for nothing. You would think since they had over 15 people working that everything would get done on time. Once we finally got our pizzas I started eating mine and notice that my sauce wasn't even on my pizza and had to go back up, after waiting already just to get my food. Overall I LOVED the pizza! This is just a very good tip to let people know if you place an order online once you check in at the cashier make sure you see them put your pizzas in the oven. 5 stars for the pizza, but not so much for the fast service.",

Gluten free crust is delicious, they have separate sauce if you have an allergy that doesn't touch the \"normal\" dough (though they're cooked in the same oven). A lot of toppings, cooks in 180 seconds, but pretty small for the price. The first time I came there were 16 staff members behind the counter  (2 weeks after they opened) and it was chaos. I was very intimidated to walk up to the counter. The second time about half the amount and much friendlier/low key. Kids in line were excited to be designing their own pizzas, great for them!",

The pizza was not my favorite, I have had better tasting pizza at a similar concept pizza place on the Strip, (Project Pie). My daughter loved the pizza, so we will be back and I will give the place a 2nd chance. If the pizza does not work out for me, the S'Mores and salads are options! The likes: I liked the huge selection of toppings, which the staff was generously put atop the pizza. The dough had a rim to keep the toppings from falling off. Everyone was super friendly. The manager even came by to ask how we liked it. The unlimited amount of toppings did not effect the one priced pizza. It's nice not to pay per topping! I loved the S'More dessert which they will heat up for you in their oven. The blood orange lemonade was good, but really tasted just like lemonade. I did not taste orange juice in it. They do offer alcoholic beverages, so that is nice for an evening out with friends.",

Prices are reasonable as my wife and I got out with just a $23 bill for two pizzas and a small salad to share. My wife got her pizza a good 5-7 minutes before me, despite mine being made first. I thought at first it was because I got the high rise crust instead of the normal crust like my wife. But when I got it, they had made just a normal crust for me. I brought it to their attention and they quickly made the right one for me. They also gave me a free pizza card for the troubles. The place was clean but sort of loud. We would probably come back.",

    "text": "What can I say other than Blaze Pizza N. Decatur is top shelf!  From the delicious pizza, salads, dessert, and Frescas to the OUTSTANDING customer service.  It took me a while to check Blaze out because the parking lot is a bit of a nightmare, but one afternoon I decided to take a chance and see if they lived up to the hype my good friend was giving me.  As soon as I walked in I heard a chorus of happy \"Hello and welcome to Blaze!!\", I immediately smiled.  When I approached the counter I was asked if I had been there before, to which I answered no and was then guided through the ordering and customization process.  I couldn't believe that I was being offered so much flavorful variety at such a low cost!  I was full of expectation as I waited (not very long) for my pizza to cook.  I was not disappointed, the first bite all the way through to the last bite was heaven!  Now that I have become a frequent customer (as much as 4 times a week at times) I know to slather my pie in garlic pesto before anything else, and I know that at any given time, someone on shift knows me (which makes me feel pretty special). Now it's time for shout outs to my Blaze family: Jon, my first friend, who remembered when I came in for lunch for my first visit and returned for dinner that same night with my mother in tow by saying \"Weren't you here earlier?\", Kenya who always greets me enthusiastically, along with Britney who greets me with a \"Hey girl!\", Cortland, Ricky, Elizabeth, Michael, Angela, Ana, Leshay, and Ms. Megan who says \"Hey Mama!\", there are others too (Sorry guys if I didn't name you!!) this staff is awesome and make the experience of coming in a double joy with their genuine good spirits and delicious food!  If you haven't tried it go immediately!!!!!  You can't beat the price for real food!  Thank you my Blaze family you have a devoted customer in me!!!!!",

You can change your taste bud with different and wide variety of choices of sauce, cheese and toppings that you wouldn't normally get from your delivery pizza. The location has good service, friendly people, and a lot of employees that make your order go faster and smoother. I orders a pizza and got it cooked and ready to eat in five min.

Best way I can describe it is \"A CHIPOTLE STYLE RESTAURANT BUT FOR PIZZA.\" To order you either chose from pre-determined ingredients signature pizza or make your own. You pick your dough, sauce, type of cheese, meat, veggies. Afterwards they throw your creation into an oven for a few minutes and it comes out crispy and delicious. I love either the meat lovers or barbecue chicken. Making your own pizza can be very satisfying too. The more toppings and the more colorful the better. Lines here can get a bit long because the workers move the pizza along in single file. They also have pizza boxes for taking your left orders to go. Overall, this is a good lunch spot with enough variety with the toppings that each experience will feel New.",

You know when you just have a craving and the day isn't complete without satisfying that craving? Well that was me today after getting shut down at PIEOLOGY. Kind of happy that happened because if it didn't I probably would have prolonged coming here. Sometimes unfortunate circumstances can lead you to tasty pizza.  Atmosphere is chill here. Laid back music, simple modern decor and dining area. Even though it was super busy when I came in, it didn't take long for me to get to the ordering counter.   The girl who started off my pizza creating experience was very sweet and even asked if I wanted employees to change their gloves for my order upon telling her that I'm vegan! Hell yeah. I feel needy when I have to ask for the glove change but for real I don't like the thought of animal juices touching my pizza.  Speaking of toppings, they have everything I want on a vegan pizza: spinach, basil, mushrooms, roasted garlic, roasted red pepper, artichoke hearts, zucchini, red onion and of course the obligatory oregano just to name a few.   I don't care if it's further from my house, if I want a delicious and QUALITY vegan pizza I'm coming here from now on.",

Pizzas are 11 inches each. I got the \"white top\" pizza which comes with white cream sauce, garlic, arugula and mozzarella but I added basil, goat cheese, tomatoes and mushrooms. It was pretty good. I got a side Caesar salad as well which was delicious though a little pricey for the size of it. I'd definitely go back to try another pizza.  They have online ordering which is a huge plus. When I got to the restaurant, I only waited one minute which is how long it takes to cook the pizza (they waited until I got there to put the pizza in the oven so it would be fresh and hot for me to take home). They use a 2000 degree oven so it only takes about a minute-90 seconds to cook.",

    "text": "Blaze Fast Fire'd has become my favorite \"Build Your Own\" pizzeria. I'm here so much that you can call BFF my new BFF. And based on the lines that you'll find here, everyone else is a fan too. Your options are almost endless. Want to keep it simple? Then go for their Simple Pie ($5.25), which is just mozzarella, Parmesan, and red sauce. Too boring for you? How about their 1 topping pizza ($6.45)? You can't decide for yourself? Then go with one their Signature Pizzas or a Build Your Own for just $7.95.  I usually choose to build my own and take full advantage of their limitless toppings. My pizza masterpiece consist of just a regular crust, white sauce, no cheese, triple serving of chicken, mushrooms, roasted garlic, and olives. My opinion...it's the best pizza that I have ever created. Obviously, I'm a fan and will be back.   TIP: Download the app and order your pizza ahead of time. You are welcome.",

This place is pretty far where I live the actual place is a dine in restaurant with the bar by the front very much a chipotle and cafe rio concept of high quality food after that going to an actual pizza restaurant. Very clean place, easy to find and good customer service. The price is really affordable, specialty pizzas are 8.25 and \"build your own\" is 8.25. I did have an amazing cookie that was completely over priced.  You get to build your own pizza the toppings vary there's quite a few selections but not a ton. Veggie friendly, but not vegan friendly as there was not alternative cheese options. (I may be wrong call ahead)   I had a yummy \"build your own\" pizza with tomatoes basil and ricotta cheese!!  My friend had \"build your own\" as well.  Definitely go to this place so YUMMY and very affordable.",

Went up to the online order station and the guy says it will be ready in a minute. So 12 minutes goes by and nothing happens. Not even apologizing for the wait or offering some water since I have to wait. I mean absolutely nothing. Then I look and I see 2 large pizzas just sitting there, at this point I'm imagining those are mine. Another 10 minutes goes by and finally the guy comes up to me and tells me he never got the ticket for my 3rd pizza. Idk why?? All 3 pizzas were in the same online order. So they're making it and will be ready. Then finally at 4:34pm my pizzas are coming and of course to make it worse the 2 large pizzas that were just sitting there for 20-25min were indeed mine! I was so annoyed, so I went home and of course those 2 pizzas were cold. This was my very first time ever coming inside a Blaze Pizza establishment and I was going to share this with my family. How disappointing. I will never come back to eat at this location nor this establishment as a fear that something like this may happen again. The management really needs to work on customer service and especially the online ordering. Didn't want to give a negative review, but hopefully this helps the other customers and concerned employees about this problem. So disappointed as this was going to be my go-to pizza place.",

You can even have yourself a gluten free pizza! not that I went that route but if one wanted to you can.  I was pretty surprised that you can have unlimited toppings for only about $8. It's a self pizza but me and the beau shared one and I left satisfied. The toppings seemed fresh. They make the pizza and than it takes about 8-10 minutes and it's done. Fresh and bomb!  We topped our pizzas half and half. I was able to put my own toppings on one half of the pizza while the beau did his thing on the other half. And it's thin crust.. My favorite. You can also get a \"rising crust\" if you wanted to.  Can't wait to come back.",

After a long hike on Sunday, I suggested to hubby that we check it out. Little did I know, he had already been here for lunch with workmates!   We walked in and there was a line but for obvious reasons. Your pizza is handmade to your liking! When we made it to the front of the line we were warmly greeted by Chase. Chase was lively and entertaining to say the least. Hubby wanted to keep the pizza simple since it was my first time so I let him do the ordering. We opted for a fresh tomato/mozzarella with mushrooms. In addition, we ordered the arugula sale with fresh fruit. We looked around for plates and utensils and low and behold Deborah appeared and kindly explained that most people use the boxes to eat on. She even went as far as to tearing up the box and making us both plates. Next, she saw I was missing my salad and went back to grab it for me. Deborah delivered the best customer service I have received in quite sometime and she was super pleasant and happy to help. I immediately tipped her and expressed my appreciation for her assistance. I hope the management team knows what gems they have with both Deborah and Chase!   Ok, back to the pizza. As my opening sentence expresses, sooooooo good was this pie! Wow! I did not expect this quality but my doors were blown off. I have been to a couple of other make it yourself pizza places, but hands down Blaze is the best I have ever had. I will be back here again and although I don't live near by, after my next hike in another week I will be stopping by again for more deliciousness! Good news!! There are opening a location closer to my house but I still am apt to return to this location based on the customer service alone!",

The pizzas are prepared but not \"fired\" until you pick up. I got there at 8:14 and my pizzas were sitting on the counter.. Done and had been for 5 minutes (according to the gentleman that put them there) but the sticker on the box has a 7:59 time stamp. When I asked why they were cooked already I was told ASAP orders are cooked right away. When I asked what determines an ASAP order, they told me its written in the notes(keep in mind that it doesn't state anywhere that if you write ASAP your pizzas would be cooked immediately. So how would I have even known to do that?!). I WROTE nothing On my order and purposely chose 8:15 because that would give me enough time to get there and hopefully the pizzas would be warm when I got home. Instead of working with me and remaking the pizzas.. Both the lady at the register and I'm assuming  the manager just argued with me. I'm a very tech savvy person and use my phone for everything...... This was not a glitch on my part.   Now I'm sitting here eating a cold pizza.",

    "text": "This place is awesome. They basically turned subway into a pizza store. You get to make your own pizza choosing from ANY of the sauces, cheeses, toppings that you want. All that for a very cheap price too. About 8$ for a medium pizza.  The ingredients are great quality, the sauces (pesto sauce!!) and cheeses especially. Some of the meats are kinda ordinary though. But still a step up from most pizza places, plus you can add as many as you want.  This restaurant has a great staff, as well as in numbers and service quality. They are all mostly in the 20s and super friendly. They work very effectively. A pizza is ready 5 min after you are done picking the ingredients.  The inside is well decorated, nothing too flashy, in a simple Italian style restaurant. You can see the pizza oven, which I think is kinda cool.  Overall, this place offers a very good quality of pizza for a very affordable price in a very nice setting. With a friendly and very competent staff. I would recommend this place to anyone.",

As we were walking out he told us to come back, which I did to let him know his guest service skills were horrible and he should find a new occupation, then proceeded to chipotle.

I got a build your own which was a flat price of 8$ unlimited toppings. I was iffy about how good the toppings would be seeing that I can put as much as I would like. Let me tell you they were fresh and this is the best pizza I have had in Las Vegas. It's personal size just right for yourself and a slice or two for later! And the blood orange lemonade was fresh tangy and just right!!! I can't wait to go back and try the toppings I didn't have the first go around!!",

The crust is very lacking, my pizza was very chewy even for a thin crust. My wifes pizza on the other hand was burnt so bad on the bottom it was horrible, the line was crazy so we just went for desert.  Oh and the decor should have been revised inside, there is nothing to soak up the noise, and music so it sounds like an empty warehouse. Normal conversation is ok as long as your only 3 feet away.",

The 3 stars is because the staff up front are usually stepping over each other and will go back and forth to taking your initial order to making your pizza all with the same glove. As you go down the line some of them actually like they're scared they are going to put too many toppings on it or something. They move so slow putting each piece of item on one by one. I don't know something about it irritates the crap out of me. Just put the toppings on already...geeesh! But other than that, great concept and decent quality of food too.

I understand being upset that someone hasn't done what was expected but he became visibly frustrated with Sam in front of other costumers. Having food industry expirence, I know how frustrating and embarrassing it is to be called out on the spot in front of all the other customers standing there.

They also sell warm s'mores for dessert. So good! And their lemonade selection is pretty good as well if your not trying to drink soda.

In terms of toppings, I like the sausage here a lot better than Pieology's sausage.  All other elements seem similar, but they do have a few additional toppings here that are not available at Pieology.  They also serve beer and have blood orange lemonade.

The crust is super thin but crisp and the amount of toppings I had didn't weigh the pizza down or make it soggy after cooking.

And then my husband and I also get a spicy one with the spicy marinara & stack it with deliciousness. Oh and don't worry about getting carried away with  delicious toppings because They don't charge extra. WHAT!? YES!! They care about your happiness here so they do not put an extra burden on you.   I haven't even mentioned what really makes this stand out from other pizza joints. You get to pick your fresh toppings from a port of sub-type of layout. Watch them stack your dough & a few minutes later.... You have a fresh yummalicious pie ready to be devoured!  Highly recommend this place to anyone who loves their taste buds enough to treat them to a slice of heaven!",

    "text": "I have eaten at Blaze four times. Three out of our four trips to this restaurant were terrible experiences. I will not go back.  The first time my fiance and I ate at Blaze, it was wonderful. We went on opening day, got free pizza, and it was delicious. The service was great. The food was great. We thought we found a new go-to eating spot. My one complaint was that I purchased a smore and asked it to be warmed up. They forgot to warm the smore up, and I had to go up and ask for it after ten minutes. It was terrible at room temperature. I decided I wouldn't order that again.  We went back to Blaze for a second time about a week later. We waited an excessive amount of time to receive our pizza, and when we did, our pizza was burnt. They took my fiance's pizza back and made him a new one for free. They tried to tell me my BURNT pizza was normal. I told them it was unacceptable. So they made me a new one as well. My new pizza didn't come out until after my fiance was done eating his new pizza. However, my fiance's new pizza was STILL BURNT. The manager, Jared, brought out his new pizza, looked at the bottom, acknowledged that it was still burnt, and served it to my fiance anyway. My fiance felt obligated to eat the pizza because Jared gave us free pizza cards to come back at a later date, and my fiance felt it just wasn't worth the trouble to get a third pizza in the hopes that this pizza would not be burnt. We were not the only ones receiving burnt pizzas. Several other people had pizzas that need to be remade because they were burnt, and Jared was handing out free pizza cards to other people.  On our third trip to Blaze, we used the free pizza cards given to us because we had burnt pizzas. My fiance's pizza was again burnt. We kept the pizza because they were free.  We decided to give Blaze one more chance and we went back for our forth and final time. Everyone in the line to pick your toppings was cheerful and friendly. The lady at the register was very kind and happy. We sat down and waited for our pizzas. My fiance's name was called. He brought his pizza over and went back up to wait for mine. To be clear, we ordered our pizzas together at the exact same time. Our pizzas went in at the same time. They came out at the same time. Over five minutes pass and my name has still not been called. My pizza was sitting under the heat lamp while it was passed over for other people who ordered after me to receive there pizzas. So my fiance's pizza was sitting on our table getting cold while my pizza was sitting under a heat lamp waiting to be cut and served to me for over five minutes. I had to explicitly ask why my pizza was just sitting there and ask to be served my pizza. If I hadn't, it would have sat there for who knows how long. They did not offer to make us fresh pizzas. They didn't say anything at all. Just handed me my pizza like it wasn't a big deal that my fiance's pizza was now cold and mine had been under a heat lamp. To top it all off, my fiance's pizza was burnt FOR THE THRID TIME. Three out of our four times at Blaze, he was knowingly given a burnt pizza. Unacceptable.  We ate our pizza and I asked to speak with the manager, Jared. I told Jared everything I wrote above from our first time at Blaze to our last time at Blaze. Jared's exact words were \"okay.\" I replied with \"okay?\" And he said \"I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry that happened. But you two are the only ones who have ever had a problem here.\" He tried to make it seem as though we should be okay with poor service and burnt pizza. And it he lied when saying we were the only ones who had a problem because many people had a problem with their burnt pizzas on our second trip to Blaze. Further, he said \"well, that's just one piece that was burnt\" because we saved one piece of my fiance's burnt pizza to show Jared that the pizza was burnt, again. The whole pizza was burnt, but he tried to make it out like only one slice was burnt. Regardless of if just one slice or the whole pizza was burnt, a customer should never be served any burnt pizza. Ever.   Jared was completely unprofessional, rude, and dismissive of our complaints. Needless to say, we will never go back to Blaze. We are much happier going to their competitors and giving them our money instead.",

It takes much better than Pieology. The sauce is what gets me with Blaze Pizza. You can never get a pizza as good as the ones you get in New York City. Living in the west coast for 8 years I've realized I can only tolerate thin crust pizzas here and the two best that I've experienced so far is Blaze Pizza and Grimaldi's.",

I do love that you can get whatever meats, cheeses, veggies and more on your pizza for practically the same price, so if you love tons of stuff on your pizza it's worth it. The pizza is to me bland, and there is nothing special about the crust. Service is always on point though here at the Decatur location. I'll come back every now and then when I get the chance",

I then added a sea salted chocolate chip cookie, and goodness those things are awesome after being warmed up!  You also have to try the lemonades, they're so refreshing.. while sitting we had, eddy, Chris, and mike all come ask if we were doing okay, even with how busy they were they still had time to make sure we were doing alright.. we will definitely be back!",

My boyfriend and I walked in at 9:50pm (They close at 10pm) and they were absolutely phenomenal! Starting with the manager Gab! I asked for half a pizza and a salad they had already cleaned and put away the salads but he insisted he could still make me one... I said it was okay and he nicely offered a complimentary dessert for the inconvenience! It's a build your own pizza, you can do half a pizza too, FRESH ingredients, so many different options with sauces, gluten free friendly, very clean. Brittany was at the register, she was absolutely amazing as well, very friendly again even though it was about 7 minutes till closing and another couple walked in after us, still with friendly faces on their face!  Lastly, Larry he was the one cooking our pizzas, prefect crust, prefect amount of dressing, & great conversation!  The whole team work was great. I absolutely LOVE pizza so this is definitely my new spot!",

They had the fires raging, toppings fresh and ready to blow my tastebuds away, and not to mentioned the staff was perky given it was only 10:30!    To the eats. We went with 2-1 topping pies featuring red sauce, vegan cheese ( yesss lawd), and spinach. Still in the vegan struggle zone I chose the vegetarian option labeled Veg Out! We also accompanied the pies with a Cesar salad and the squash/ quinoa salad!  The pies were very tasty!! Crisp crust that was chewy on the inside, the red sauce was perfected (not too acidic or sweet), and all the toppings were delightfully fresh! Not to mention that vegan cheese melted! Heaven!   All of this food was enough to satisfy my family of 6 and only costing about $35 that wasn't shabby at all!",

I studied at Le Cordon Bleu to be a chef and cooked for many years. The food bins with the ingredients had some of every other ingredient in there mixed up! So food allergen people stay away. Cheese was spilled over in all the sauces, olives in the garlic, nats flying around, meats had fallen into other meats. Fresh made salads were wilting and needed to be thrown away. Tables were dirty and had sauce dried on, floors were dirty with debris were customers sit and behind in prep area. The guy that made the pizza kept rubbing his shirt with food debris against the edge of my crust. Some many things wrong so many codes violated in one night to list. Will never be back to this location, which is sad because it's in a really nice area. My advice if you still come after this bring the pepto.",

It is the same build your own pizza concept as Pizza Rev and Pieology where you go down a assembly line of employees to tell them the toppings you want on your pizza or you can opt in for one of their specialty pizzas. Then you wait 5-10 minutes for your pizza to be ready.  What sets them apart from their competitors is that you get a slightly larger pizza along with a thicker crust which makes for a better tasting pizza. Also, they offer different types of lemonades along with soda which is great for people who don't drink sodas.",

    "text": "So aside from this being my favorite pizza, this post is mainly about how seriously TERRIBLE the service is. I tried to handle this complaint through the website but nobody wants to get back to me so here goes: We showed up at 8:30 on a Sunday night and waited for them to help us for 20 minutes and when the guy finally came up I asked \"is it closing already? I thought you were open until 10.\" He said \"no just pre closing.\" So we stood there in line for 20 minutes while they ignored us even though they were open for another hour and a half. Then we get to the register and they overcharge us by a dollar because he messed up the register and when I asked him about it he said \"oh yea I just noticed, sorry\" but did he fix it? No. Then when I went up to grab my pizza I reminded him that I asked for ranch drizzle and he rolled his eyes so then I said \"can I just have a cup of ranch instead?\" And he got upset. The restaurant had no Parmesan shakers out like they usually do but honestly I was so upset at how the staff had treated us I didn't even attempt to ask. We just left. It's only this location that has terrible service. The other locations are excellent but the staff at this location need a strong lesson in customer service. We won't be back.",

Come to find this place is a Subway Style Pizza but super delicious, and not at all like a subway sandwich. You could choose one of their signature pizzas or you could do a Build your Own Pizza for only $8.25 with as many toppings as you want. They had many options of sauces, meats, and veggies to choose from.   After I created my pizza, they threw it in the oven while we waited to pay.. before we even made it to the cashier our names were called and it was hot and ready to go... and boy was my mouth watering at just the sight of it.   In less than 15 minutes from walking in the door I had made my own personal, DECENT SIZED pizza and was devouring it.   They also have other options to make a Pizza Salad - also gluten free options.   Lastly, they had a variety of different lemonades and juices to try that really topped off the meal.   I will definitely be a repeat customer.",

Seriously, for under $8 I can get a personal pizza loaded with unlimited veggies of my choosing. I'm talking bell peppers, mushrooms, basil, and zucchini with a spicy marinara base. I always order my pizza with daiya cheese, although most vegans aren't a fan of this brand. I think it tastes awesome!   When you're in a hurry, I'd recommend ordering online. When your order is ready for pick-up, you just mosey over to the cashier and they'll fire up your pizza in the oven. Otherwise, waiting in line may take a sec because Blaze always has a crowd.

My mother got home and ate hers and like I said,she IS NOT a pizza eater.She called me and said OH MY GOD THIS IS THE BEST PIZZA I EVERY ATE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.LOL.Needless to say BLAZE HAS A STAMP OF APPROVAL.We will definitely be returning soon.",

So imagine my excitement when a new place just opened up and had great reviews.  1. The inside is beautiful, it has a very trendy and hipster vibe- I loved it!   2. The customer service was EXCELLENT- every worker was moving-fast! They all had smiles on their faces even though they were slammed (went on a Saturday night)  3. Pricing is MORE than fair, seriously I was used to paying about 16 dollars over at Novecento and here it was 8! Plus they sell alcohol to go with your pizza ;)   4. Taste- it tasted great and very fresh, plus how it works is they give you a slab of dough and you choose everything from the type of  sauce, cheese, and all the toppings you can even imagine. Its like a subway but for pizza!   Overall, I will be coming here from now on! It was a really great experience and I'm glad I have found a replacement from the last joint I used to go to. Great job! :)",

Everyons pizza was great and not burnt as we have received elsewhere.  Only thing missing was some TVs to watch some sports on.  Will definitely be back with more of the family!",

I'm not going to lie I was a little worried about how it was going to taste, but he loved it. He ate the whole pizza. Recently we discovered he had a dairy intolerance. He had been missing pizza this last month so you guys really made his day. The girl who helped us even changed her gloves to handle my son's pizza without being asked. Thanks for going above and beyond!",

When going up to the counter, they always talk to you like they've known you forever and it's always nice to lay your problems for the day on a person you don't know! The staff are so friendly and I even know a few people that I went to high school with here!   As far as the pizza goes, it's delicious! I ordered the \"meat eater\" last night and the gentleman put every meat on there and I was super happy. They ran out of the banana peppers I love though, right when I got to the veggies. Bummer.  Sitting at the high tables was pretty nice because we were away from the children climbing all over the booths. The tables are always clean and I love being able to take my pizza home if I'm not finished!",

Once, around 2ish years ago, I ordered a salad and found a dead bug in it. When I went to let the employees at the register know about it, they literally laughed at me and just casually took it back. It was quite obvious I was around 7 months pregnant, def no laughing matter. Only about 5 min later the manager came out and apologized and gave me a gift card to use on a future visit.   Today, they were so rude to me that I just had to leave a review. During lunch rush they were operating incredibly slowly, and I waited a good 15 min in line before getting to the front, okay no worries, I get it they were busy. When I finally had my chance to order, she told me they were all out of the gf crust I need to eat for my health reasons, ok, fine, I told her that unfortunately I  wasn't going to order anything, and she said w a bad attitude, 'ok, you can go somewhere else'.... And I did. I get it, she hates her job, but she shouldn't have an attitude w me after I waited 15 minutes in their line just to end up going to Chipotle next door.",

As a new keto lifestyler I was apprehensive, but it's pretty good. Keep in mind there is an up charge of 3.50 on this option, but I didn't mind seeing I don't have to break out the almond flower! The peeps working here were friendly, and the manager even changed my crust without my asking (was slightly breaking). I was given a disclaimer that the crust maybe a little cold as they are still figuring out how to perfect the crust. Annnnnd yes it was a little cold, maybe heat the crust a little before adding the toppings?  Overall I had a pretty good experience at Blaze, the establishment was clean, and staff was friendly.   4 stars was mainly because my pizza was cold, and I didn't have the time or place to reheat it, other than that I'd try it again.

I was so happy they had vegan cheese and TONS of veggies to choose from. They even had vegan chik'n! Sidenote: Pieology doesn't have vegan meats :(.   The pizza was very good. The crust was thick but not doughy. The sauce was very good. And the pesto drizzle at the end really set it off.

Growing up in Hawaii, all I ever knew was Pizza Hut or Domino's, and for the longest time I was totally against the thin crust.  The pizzas here are always amazing! The pies are individual sizes, but could feed two people if you're willing to share, and you're able to custom build the pizza of our choice. What I love about them is that they have some specialty recipes already on the menu, and they still allow you to customize those too.  I always order the Green Stripe pizza, and add on a few extra toppings. I love the green stripe because it shows doesn't come with any sauce-- just good 'ol mozzarella cheese for the base. I always ask that they brush pesto on the dough before the cheese is added.  Although I will never completely surrender my pan pizza crust from Pizza Hut, Blaize Pizza's crust is pretty good.  The prices were good, the toppings were fresh, and the wood-fired taste was delish.",

I love that I can build my own pizza. There's SO MANY options of meats, cheeses and veggies. Plus seasonings and drizzles. I love that they offer gluten free crust, vegan cheese and they even have vegan 'chicken' now as well. I don't love that out of the last 30 visits, they have had to remake our pizza about 18 times. Typically because they burn it. This last time however, was because they gave my pizza to the wrong person. The young adults working were more preoccupied talking to each other rather than paying attention to the customers. I waited about 6 minutes for 2 employees to finish their conversation next to the dough press before I was helped. I chose my toppings and my pizza went into the oven. 15 minutes later, still no pizza. Puzzled I walked over to the pickup area and I spotted my pizza ready to be sliced. I said to the young man, oh good my pizzas out but he said no that's not yours. Yours is still in the oven. This is an online order.  Ok, back to my seat I went but then another 13 minutes and still no pizza. I asked for a manager. Turns out that was my pizza that had been given to someone else. Of course they remade mine and gave me a free pizza for my next visit but the worst part is that no matter how many free pizza cards they hand out, it doesn't change.",

I placed an online order to be picked up at noon. I show up at 12:05 and have to get someone's attention to tell me my pizzas just went in and would be done in 3 or 4 minutes. Another 10 minutes go by when I realize my pizzas had been sitting on the station in front of an employee that knew I was waiting. I point out that those were my pizzas, that I had been standing there for 10 minutes, and that the order was for 12:00. I was pretty nice about it. He seemed annoyed with me and says that he thought it was waiting for another pizza. I tell him that it's just waiting for a salad and he says he knows and that another employee is getting it. He didn't offer and apology, nor seem apologetic. She brings me the salad and doesn't say anything (I think she was just busy and was being called in a different direction already when she dropped off my salad.) I don't like to solicit apologies, but at the very least, he shouldn't get annoyed at me because of his mistake.   The manager did give me a free drink for the wait. He was helping customers and did not seem aware of the situation.",

Not only can you request your pizza made to order but you can also request zero cheese on your salad. My favorite drink here is the matcha tea and the Blaze Pizza app is a must have. Blaze Pizza also gives a 10% military discount if you present your card. Everyone here is very helpful and I especially like visiting when Eduardo and Abigail are here. You can even try toppings before they are put on your pizza. It's a good thing that I tried the spicy  vegan chorizo before my pizza was completed. I opted out of that topping",

Their Canadian bacon or ham as some prefer was only available as smoked ham and on pizza I find that to be far too salty. The green peppers were also cut into chunks rather than in slivers, which is hard to eat on pizza. They also ran out of the fresh mozzarella balls, so we had to wait around for them to grab more and the person behind us also ordered it and that was all they had in the store. Running out of ingredients is no bueno. The service from the staff was good and the speed of the food was good. All in all, it was good, but if I had to pick just one, it wouldn't be Blaze.",

Sweet price for being able to add whatever you want on the pie .Somehow it tasted and made me feel healthy (idk how you do that with pizza , but they did it). Staff is nice , quick and accurate . Even when it's busy you don't have to wait around for anything . The first time I tried it , I brought one pizza home just so everyone could try it . When we finished that pie , we went right back to Blaze and got 2 more . It's a pretty place too . It's definitely something to try. Too good to pass up .",

And waited. After 10 + minutes asked the guy cutting the pizzas if mine were in the oven yet, he assured me they were. 10 or so MORE minutes, still no pizza love for me. Asked the perky girl and she found my order prepared but still waiting to enter the oven. Me=not happy. Another worker offered to comp me cookies as a consolation prize but I'd already purchased cookies so asked for a salad instead. No can do says she. Finally got my order and headed home. The crust is crispy and tasty, good. Sauce sparse but good also. Toppings were good but not plentiful, and I could find almost no mozzarella in attendance. Were I to order again, and it's doubtful, I'd be more proactive in making sure the pizzas were being cooked and definitely order extra cheese.",

A bit of background, if I may. I have worked in the customer service industry, on the Las Vegas Strip,  for the last ten years for a company who prides itself on top notch customer service and employee/customer interaction. This company, who shall remain nameless (but it rhymes with Beazers), hasn't the first clue on how to motivate employees to WANT to provide this level of service. That being said, I have no idea how Blaze does it, but every time I walk into this place (at least twice a week)  I feel like each and every employee there is happy to be there. Their smiles are genuine and even during the busiest of times, the great attitudes never fail. I've seen them cope with mistakes and miss-ordered food without a single slip in their service standards. I've never seen an unhappy customer there either, and that's saying something. I know that the bar is set pretty low for places like this, but they consistently achieve so much more than you'd expect that they're rapidly becoming my favorite place to eat.  So, in no specific order, let me thank the team who served my son and I last night: Gina, Felix, Eduardo, Michael, Courtland, Angelo and Cesar thank you all very much!!",

They walked me through the process of how it all works and how you get unlimited toppings and endless customization for only $8. They even serve beer and wine! Top quality toppings and sauces go on the pizzas. After I placed my order and waited only a few minutes the pizza was done! Quick, tasty, and affordable pizza! I highly recommend this place.",

My husband likes spicy red sauce pizza with pepaloni. The sauce is quite spicy. I like pesto with lot of veggies. With drinks, it was less than $30. It was very good. We tried Pieology, but my husband didnot like it. This place is cheaper, tastier, closer, and give bigger portion than Pieology. We will go back.",

    "text": "I decided to go to Blaze because I knew my husband had been wanting to try it. In the Air Force, well on the flight line in any case, they are always talking about food, lol. I was not in the mood for pizza at all but I didn't let him know that.   Well, I was pleasantly surprised!! The line went fast, there were plenty of FaNtAsTiC topping choices. Not just your typical toppings but a wide variety, several sauces, multiple cheeses to choose from, plenty of veggies, even a salad pizza!   They have specialty pizzas you can order as well but to me for the price of build your own, I'd build my own every time I go! It's very affordable, we got a pizza each but if we could agree on the sauce, lol, we could get one pizza and it would have only been about $12 for 2 adults. But it was $22 for 2 pizzas and 2 drinks and we ended up bringing a whole pizza home, half of each of our own pizzas, so we had lunch for Sunday!  To me, that's a pretty good deal.   The atmosphere was nice and despite being there near closing I never felt rushed or hassled by the employees. Props! I can't tell you how many times that has happened at other places and it's so rude. EVERY employee I dealt with this Saturday night was kind and courteous at Blaze! !!   Overall it was a GrEaT experience, FaNtAsTiC food,  and over the top customer service!!   We've definitely found our new pizza place, no more delivery here!",

We didn't know how the process worked and they were patient and walked us through it! You pick out you dough, cheese, and you get as many toppings as you could possibly want for no additional charge! They make sure you are pleased with your pizza, you will get asked multiple times if everything is tasting okay or if you need anything. They are on top of cleaning. The pizza TASTE AMAZING! Everything about this place was great. Loved it. We will be back again!   OH & if I had to make one personal suggestion on another topping option... I would ask them to include asparagus that would make this place even better!",

I created my own :) they put a pizza crust down and you tell them what you want and YES they know what WHITE PIZZA is!! So many places I go to, don't. On a white pizza there's no red sauce it's an Alfredo sauce, it's just a good change. So they have an array of items you can choose to have on your pizza - they slide it down the table like at a sandwich shop. You can add just about anything you want, they literally have all kinds of toppings. I chose 1/2 red and 1/2 white sauce - a friend was with me and we were splitting it. Then we added roasted garlic, spinach, black olives and ricotta cheese omg! The maker hands it off to the cooker who throws it into the brick oven and within a few minutes they're yelling your name! All the crusts were the same, a nice thin, crispy crust. The pizza was great and they have beer, wine and an array of soft drinks and water.",

I think this is the first time I was asked about whether the no gluten was for allergies or preference. They took extra care to ensure there was no wheat. For me it is a preference but my dining companion gets violently ill. The extra care was so appreciated.The pizzas were wonderful. The sauce, so flavorful. We had one pizza with traditional sauce and the other with garlic pesto. Did I say the sauce was wonderful? Yuuummy ! they know how to do garlic pesto!  So many fresh choices for toppings. The garlic cheese knots were scrumptious..with even more luscious sauce. They didn't make it home. The prices are not bad, about $10 for an 11\" pie. Nice place to hang out and share a pizza with friends. We will definitely be back.",

I paid online,  this place doesn't deliver and I came over to pick up my order at the time on my receipt. My pizza wasn't ready and I was told to wait,  and wait 20 minutes later, finally they called my number and i went home with my box.   My Green Stripe was anything but green it was missing the pesto and arugula!!! And it wasn't gluten free.  I paid extra for gluten free.  As in no gluten.   I was home,  with pizza that was less than what I payed for or called to order.  And I can't eat gluten!   This is what happens when you remove the human element,  and \"streamline\"  your business with computer ordering.  I called back to complain and the person on the phone said nothing can be done, unless I  return to the store. I explained that the pizza I was sold was inedible and I needed a refund. Nope,  no can do I was told.   But I was home,  not wanting to go pick up another pizza, I was in the comfort of my own home.",

(We initially tried to go there first unknowing how crazy the line would be.) The line wrapped the inside of the building and at times edged outside, but my girlfriend and I were hungry and the people in front of us in line had adorable kids who were entertaining. If the line was out the door, it had to be worth the wait right? Definitely.   We waited about 30-45 minutes in line and we're finally greeted with extraordinarily nice employees who explained the process. Got our pizzas all picked out and sent to the oven, paid, picked a seat, and in just a matter of minutes our names were called. Crazy good! Even with all the craziness of that night, the employees were all working very hard and the restaurant remained clean the entire time.   I used to work at a pizza place similar to Blaze, and you guys blow it out of the water, mainly because I appreciate how everyone behind the sneeze guard works in unison, without confusion, and with tidy efficiency.

The allergen free options are unrivaled and supreme, really delightful for someone that has to avoid things like wheat or dairy. The online order system is very simple and so far very much on time. The standards like pepperoni pizza are run of the meal, id recommend exploring some of their more niche choices for toppings and sauces. They're really good!",

    "text": "After driving up to Cathedral Rock to enjoy the cool temperature I ended up in Blaze Fast-Fire'd Pizza to enjoy the hot temperature. That is the hot temperature of an 11 inch custom made pizza pie prepared in an oven at 800 degrees.     This Blaze Fast-Fire'd (abbreviated Blaze Pizza) is located in the rapidly developing shopping cluster near the North  Decatur at the 215 interchange in the Winco-Target Shopping Center. Blaze Pizza was asphalt when I  reviewed this Winco and Firehouse Subs not so long ago. Just like the shopping cluster by North Decatur and the 215, Blaze Pizza is growing. This is the newest location in the Las Vegas valley.     After my brother and I hiked in Cathedral Rock on Monday, we made it to Blaze Pizza around 6:30 PM. At this time on a weekday, it was busy. Fortunately there were plentiful tables. And fortunately I knew the Blaze Pizza routine from my original visit at the Eastern Avenue Henderson location (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/blaze-fast-fired-pizza-henderson\">yelp.com/biz/blaze-fast-...</a>).     From the point of ordering to getting the pizza, Blaze Pizza is all about building your own custom pizza. A statistician would be able to show a formula of how the customer could eat here every day and have a different pizza pie for at least a month. This paragraph shows the process through my experience. As soon as I made it to the order and pay station, the lady there asked me if I'd been here before. I did and ordered one of their signature pies with additional toppings. Because they were out of meatballs and regular sausage, I ordered the Link In signature pizza pie. This includes mozzarella cheese, Italian sausage, red peppers, and sauteed onions. After I paid $10.70 for the Link In ($7.95) and a small Coke ($1.95), she marked the pizza on a box on the start of its route on the assembly line. My next stop was the toppings station. If the Subway toppings station is Exploration Park Hill, the Blaze Pizza toppings station would be Mount Charleston. The selection of toppings is massive. It was here that I opted out of the red sauce that is included with the Link In for the spicy red sauce. I'd compliment the pizza pie with black olives and mushrooms. From there the customized pizza pie traveled into the 800 degree oven. I'd wait for a few minutes. I'd get slightly concerned when the customers that ordered after me were picking up their pies. When I looked toward the pick up area, I noticed that when the man took the pizza out of the oven that he immediately cut it into six slices. I also observed that Blaze Pizza is popular with families.      I was very happy with the pizza. The spicy red sauce was the winning ingredient that elevated the pizza pie to greatness. Supporting the spicy red sauce were the first-rate ingredients that made up the pie. All the fresh  first-rate ingredients created a first-rate pizza pie that was a pleasure to eat to the last crumb.    The first-rate 800-degree custom made pizza deserves a hot rating. Without further due, I declare this Blaze Pizza \"4 Stars.\"",

    "text": "I am loving these BYO places that are popping up all over. Blaze has a simple concept; one pizza, one size, unlimited toppings. Of course you could choose one of their signature items, but I like to make my own. It's more fun that way.  I chose a regular crust pizza and got no sauce. I added mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, tomatoes, artichoke, and ricotta cheese. Then when the pizza came out of the oven, I had them drizzle some olive oil over the top. Simple yet delicious. My boyfriend heard unlimited toppings and went crazy. He got the high rise pizza dough which is thicker crust, and then added tons of cheese, and almost all the meats they had. He also got extra cheese. Don't be afraid to ask for more toppings. They only give you a handful of the toppings you ask for, but you can always ask for more.   They say the pizzas take about 190 seconds or around 3 minutes to cook, but his took a little longer because of the mountain of toppings he had. One thing I can say is I saw some of the pizzas come out of the oven looking like shit. Some of them got stuck to the pans, and I saw one dude scrape off cheese and toppings and put it back on the pizza. I'm glad that wasn't my pie. I would make sure to keep an eye on them when they come out the oven though.   I was just about to pay and leave when I saw their premade salads next to the register. I chose the berry arugula salad and it was bomb. It had fresh blackberries, creamy goat cheese, and peppery arugula tossed in some type of balsamic vinaigrette. I wished I had gotten more than just a single serving. It's safe to say I would come back here again.",

The idea of having an ingredient buffet and letting the customers customize their own pizzas is brilliant. The pizzas prices range from $5.95 to $7.65 from the most classic pizza to the most deluxe with all toppings you can think of. The ingredients are fresh and the service is good. The only negative thing about this place is that the line is usually pretty long so if you're coming here to get pizza, be prepared to wait in line for some time.",

The employees should all be spoken with because this is my SECOND bad experience here, I keep coming back because I love the food so much but really it is getting unbelievable. There were also women behind the counter without hairnets and some had long hair!! Sincerely hope that does not end up in anyones food!!!!i  ORIGINAL: I like that this place has vegan options BUT the employees are hella rude. There was a woman who was NOT wear ing a name tag (not sure if thats allowed) who fucked up my pizza and was super rude about it. The only good employee y'all had was bob :))) he was an angel and deserves a raise. I know y'all don't pay him enough to be dealing with his rude ass coworkers.   Overall though good quality pizza. I like the vegan cheese & that you give unlimited topping :) Will maybe be returning",

We came here (knowing it was close to closing) but they didn't make us feel rushed or unwelcome at all. The manager (Lizzy) saw his badge when he went to pay and thanked him for his service.

He jus got the plain cheese but my sister tells me he never finishes his food so that speaks wonders about this place.  I got the meat lovers(its called something else) with green peppers.  I ate at this place in Fremont California when a girl I know took me.  This place is like a subway but with pizza and way better ingredients.  The ingredients are fresh and the people behind the counter were very nice and helpful.  The restaurant is very modern and a hipster kind of aura around it.  They have a few pre made set ups but you can build your own and its a great way to mix things up.  Once you throw everything you want on the pizza you sit and they call you up after it comes out the oven.  The line starts all the way to the right behind the little wall.  On a little side note I bought my sister one of the remade salads and she devoured that s*** in like 2 minutes so I'm pretty sure it was pretty good.",

They didn't try to replace it w a new one just sorry.  Too bad because I was super stoked and referred a lot of people here when it first opened.

She said let me go check and I'll be right back.

The crust is so thin and cooked so quick that it soaks up the liquid like a cracker. I had to do the Brooklyn Fold. That said, we will go back. The reason for only 3 stars is the atmosphere. It is a great warehouse for a quick lunch, but not an enjoyable dinner. The room is sooo loud you have to scream at the person making your pizza. All you hear of the background music is the base, because that is all that breaks thru. And, in creating a positive customer attitude, the greeter was smiles and bubbly and happy. The expediter was a no smile or personality big bear. He should be a club bouncer.",

We got there on a Friday night and it was quite busy. I wasn't prepared for a wait in line, one size only kinda pizza joint, but here we were. I noticed on the menu they have vegan cheese! (My daughter is allergic to cow juice!) Not only do they have vegan cheese, there is NO extra charge for it!!!! She was very excited to try it since the only one we've found in store was not too good.  It was finally our turn and the employee asked if we had been there before. Nope,  no problem! She talked us through the process and down the assembly line we went. My daughter got the (vegan) cheese and one topping (pepperoni) I got a pre designed veggie.  We took our seat and waited a bit (it was quite busy).  They forgot to bring my plastic cup of wine, so I asked for it when they called our number. No biggie, they apologized. The pizza was thin, crispy and delish! Her cheese was melty and good. My veggie was fresh and good! It was so good we went back the next night with 4 more friends!   Give it a try!",

We had never been here before and didn't understand how to order, she mumbled under her breath the entire time and acted as though it was a pain to explain the process. Even turned to one of her coworkers and said \"please take over for me\". Everyone else  was pleasant. Food was good.",

Only complaint about this location is if you are dining the acoustics are horrible...hard to hear the employees building the pizzas and it's like sitting in a gym when eating...some sound baffling on the ceiling would help tremendously.",
