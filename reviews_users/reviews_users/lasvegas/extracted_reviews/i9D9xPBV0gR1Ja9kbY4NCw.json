Poached eggs were closer to hard-boiled, and today's short rib hash was barely warm, the potatoes were under-cooked, and while the menu describes the dish as having onions and peppers, there was literally one piece of a roasted red pepper and one piece of onion.  That's a lot of disappointment for $15.95.  Has there been a change of kitchen staff?  The service, on the other hand, did not disappoint.",

She explained multiple items in great detail and made sure we were taken care of.  All of us preferred different items, the butternut squash hash, protein breakfast, and chorizo omelet.  All three of us were truly satisfied with our orders  First the butternut squash hash was outstanding topped with shredded turkey.  For the table we ordered some sweet potato fries that were amazing as well.  My friend ordered the chorizo omelet with bacon and literally could not stop talking about it.  The melding of cheese egg and bacon truly made the meal for him.  As far as atmosphere, the tables are close together, but far enough to have individual conversations.  Realistically this place always has a wait, and tries their best to accommodate as many patrons as possible.  My best advice is to order the bottomless mimosas.  At $8 a glass and $16 bottomless, it makes absolute sense to go all the way.  Be sure to try all the options, blood orange, regular, and pomegranate.  Last but not least, be sure to try the banana nut bread.  My friend ordered it as a starter and we had to order another!  Between the food, the ambiance, service, and overall presentation, this place is definitely a 5/5.",

    "text": "We finally got up early enough to try this place and wanted to see what all the hype was... but sadly I didn't see it.  Maybe breakfast eateries are scarce in this area making this place popular.   We came in early, a little after they opened, since we read and heard that all their popular pastries are gone within the first few hours they open, like the monkey bread.  Speaking of which they did not have any ready at the time we arrived, we asked about their other specials and they were also not ready. I truly don't get this. The host told us 9 am or later...umm you open at 7 am right?   She said it takes a while to make, okay fair enough, but then why wouldn't the baker come in prior to opening to be ready when the establishment opens or why not open at 9am. If it were a brunch Item I would understand, but that is not the case at all.     Okay we decided to run some errands and then come back at 9 am.  Unfortunately the items we wanted to try were still not ready at 9am.  We decided to place our order anyway and we would order breakfast and hopefully the other items would be ready by the time we finished eating breakfast.     We ordered their breakfast burrito to share, which consisted of a chile relleno, cheese, chorizo, and scrambled eggs.  Sadly I did not care for the taste and honestly I was starting to second guess this place and the great reviews.  We then got our Monkey Bread and Kouign Aman.  I didn't find anything special about the Monkey Bread except for the presentation.  I thought it was overly sweet and just good on the first bite. The Kouign Aman on the other hand was delicious.   The place is cute, the service was friendly, but nothing over the top food wise and I can't see a reason to return.",

I haven't had anything I didn't like yet from their menu. No joke.   Waitlist? Yup! Good problem but also no problem. Their staff are very friendly and they care to get you seated as soon as ppossible  Social media presence should also be acknowledged. Many owners cut corners and hire an agency to bulk their page and promote their business. These guys run their own page and actively respond to their customers. I applaud that.  Overall: go try if you haven't. Worth the drive if you live far from Anthem area.",

I LOVE that they have a vegan menu-- this restaurant is clearly cognizant of the dietary needs of its customers! It's so refreshing that so many non-vegan restaurants are offering options! I had the veggie toast, and it was delicious! I finished all of it, and it didn't leave me feeling disgusting or over-stuffed. My only complaint is the clientele, but I'm not sure that's the restaurant's fault! ':-) I came in around noon, and I was surrounded by chatty women b****ing about their husbands and every other woman they know who wasn't present for their brunch. I mean, what did I expect from a brunch spot, but holy cow! The food is delicious, but I felt like I was stuck watching an episode of The Real Housewives. It might help if the hostess could spread customers out a little more. It wasn't too busy, so I can't imagine it would have been much trouble to spread people out a little.  \\_()_/ ",

The quiche itself was light and fluffy that bounces off the tongue and the roof of the mouth. The asparagus went pleasantly well with the bacon for an addition of a slightly salty taste with the small crunch of the asparagus. All in all a wonderful and light quiche with a flavorful combination of texture and flavors.  The salad sauce was on the sour side as a vinegrette that may have been good with something else but did not go with the quiche. Otherwise the small potato crisps are always a welcome addition to the salad. Perhaps a less flavorful salad dressing would have been a better pairing.  Other than that the smoked salmon was on a wonderfully browned and soft bread with a very large helping of smoked salmon. While I do enjoy getting my bang for buck the large amount of smoked salmon made it hard to eat as the height of the food exceeds that of the mouth, and even if you press down on the meal your hands would be oily. Beyond that the copious amounts of salmon mask all the other flavors sans the white sauce they decided to use which was also a large amount. Otherwise it was quite succulent. Between the choice of bang for buck and a few overpowering aspects of the meal, this place is a solid choice to go.",

My son ordered pancakes and fruit, my daughter got the butternut squash soup, and I ordered quinoa cakes. Don't let my boring name turn you off to the idea, the quinoa cake order (I can't remember its official menu name) was SO GOOD! I loved the dish. The flavors blended so well and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it for the last two weeks.  The staff was all incredibly kind and considerate. They were kind to my kiddos and made sure we each loved our meals. It was a great experience and I will definitely return again!",

    "text": "Living in Sunridge at MacDonald Ranch is pretty sweet, but with the addition of the Craft Kitchen at Eastern and Sunrdige Heights, the experience just got even better.  What an amazing little slice of culinary heaven tucked away in the best kept secret in Henderson.  We just finished our second visit after a nice mid-morning walk...gotta justify the bottomless mimosas (traditional, pomegranate and blood orange) somehow!  The menu is truly amazing, with flavorful customization to traditional dishes, like the pulled turkey benny or completely unique dishes like their short rib hash, which left me licking the plate, the cutlery and anything the plate and cutlery touched...almost got me tossed, but I think they had seen the reaction before! The restaurant its self is very charming, you will immediately forget that this funky-fresh, country-cool eatery is situated in a strip mall...they created this fun little outdoor eating area where seating is at a premium, that is separated from the rest of the world by a sort of make shift herb garden created from customizing old pallets... The food is great and well it should be as the owners are very accomplished chefs on the Strip and this little venture, from what I understand is where they get free reign to express all their creativity, and wow does it show!   The staff for the most part is wonderful, especially a young go-getter named Caleb, who is definitely destined for great things!  Jeffrey, who has helped us twice is also extremely helpful and accommodating, we sat inside today after our walk and my wife was a bit chilled, so asked to be moved outside.  Jeffrey and Caleb made sure we were moved to warmer climes and well situated outside, but unfortunately, this seemed to rub the person in charge of the great outdoors the wrong way.  I believe her name was Katy, hard to know, as she was determined to either ignore us completely or to get us to leave as quickly as possible...which is the only reason I am unable to give the Craft Kitchen a 5 star review at this time.  I wasn't sure if she was upset because she had interlopers in her area whose tip would be going to another server, or if she was angry because one of her tables would be taken up by us for a few minutes...we were nearly done with our meal, Caleb moved our dishes to the outside when we reseated and reminded Katy that we needed a couple more mimosas.  Maybe she didn't like being reminded of this from a younger member of the staff, but for whatever reason, she conveniently forgot and we were left waiting for about 10 minutes before I went back inside to see if I could just bring the drink order out myself and was told that it would be brought to me.  Katy (again, I hope I'm getting her name correct) finally delivered our drinks and asked, \"who was your server\"?  I mentioned that Jeffrey was helping us and she left. Half way through the second glass of our \"bottomless mimosas\" Jeffrey showed up and gave us our bill.  Apparently Katy told him we were ready to leave...again, she couldn't wait to get us out of her station.  Normally I get a bit prickly about something like that, but we still had to walk home and while one more mimosa would have made the mile home a bit more enjoyable, I might have wandered into traffic or stumbled into a random wall, so I guess I should thank her for making sure we go out of there before we could do too much damage to ourselves or the oncoming traffic!   Still it would have been a much nicer experience for us if she had recognized the fact that had she gotten us the drinks quickly, we would have finished more quickly instead of waiting for our drinks.  Also, had she just \"taken one for the team\" and provided the exemplary service we received from the other members of the staff there might have been an effort put forth on our part to ensure she received a separate tip for herself.  Instead, she made it quite clear that she really didn't have the comfort level of the guests at Craft Kitchen as her top priority; just those that she was sure would enrich her tip jar at the end of the day. At any rate, the Craft Kitchen is easily one of the best places for breakfast/brunch/lunch in 89052, and is well worth the drive from any other zip code for that matter!",

Unfortunately she never came back with the menu so a member of our party had to go to the podium and acquire one. Ordered the monkey bread for an appetizer, after taking forever to come out, it was cold. Had to chase down the waitress to tell her. The monkey bread was removed and we were told they would make us a new one. Instead they simply threw the one we had eaten from into the microwave and brought it back.  Never had that happen before, normally a restaurant makes a fresh item if it's complained about. Food also took a long time to come out, noticed other tables seated after us received their food before us. After food was delivered, never saw the waitress again. No refills on coffee or water. Sad because this used to be a great place. Won't be going back.",

So we headed over just for a few pastries for a light breakfast.   To our disappointment, they only sell cronuts sometimes, and mostly on weekends- so they didn't have them! We ended up ordering a cinnamon roll, homemade poptart, and cronut holes.  These were all delicious. The waitress heated them up for us too. The poptart was not too sweet and had an apricot filling, and the pastry dough was very flakey. The cinnamon roll had a little too much icing but was very soft inside, and the cronut holes were so flakey and soft, which made us think of how good the cronut would have been!  One thing to note was that it was COLD inside! I know vegas often over air conditions, but I had goosebumps and plenty of people were getting asked to move outside to get out of the cold.",

    "text": "From my first visit to this one, it was a definite turn around.  I met a friend here for Friday Happy Hour.  Unfortunately we found out it was their last Friday night with HH but it was certainly memorable.    We decided to start off with their Cheese Plate.  This cheese board was one of the best assortments.  Creamy blue cheese, brie, truffled parmesan, aged parmesan, homemade jam, fruit and toast.  Each cheese sang a different melody.  It was simply amazing!  My Yelp friend and I also opted to share some of their dishes: Caesar Salad, Lump Crab Cakes and Cavatelli & Short Ribs.  The caesar was very large and fresh.  The large salad was plenty to share with leftovers as well.  The fresh parmesan crisp in the center gave it a great flavor.  The 2 crab cakes were a delight with the lemon aioli.  The lemon kicked it up a notch with the real crab.  The cavatelli & short rib had a unique flavor that was my winner of the evening.  It was a wonderful pasta and meat dish that is delicately sprinkled with fresh parmesan.  Everything sitting on our table would be highly recommended for another order.    Service here does not go unnoticed.  Our waitress, Jenna, provided such attentiveness and gratitude.  Her friendly professional attitude completed the wonderful evening.  I hope they bring back the happy hour again soon as I would love to enjoy their delectable dishes!",

    "text": "Having heard and seen many of my friends going here, I wanted to try it too. I went in the early morning probably 30 mins after they opened. The place was nice, cute and spacious inside. Got the salmon benny and bread pudding as breakfast.  The salmon was seasoned well. Really enjoyed the fried capers, very interesting cause I've never seen that done before. I didnt particularly enjoy the hollandaise sauce, it was a bit sour for my taste so I only drizzled a bit over the top. The poached egg was cooked just right. Once you cut into that egg, you could see the bright yellow yolk running down and spreading all over the salmon, tomatoes and the English muffin...mmmmm But, again it was just an Eggs Benedict with Salmon substituting the bacon or ham.  The bread pudding was moist and soft inside. Not too sweet. It had chocolate swirled and hidden into every bite. Came in a cute small cast iron pot dusted lightly with powdered sugar. I really enjoyed it.  Overall, I would come again to try their bakery goodies and lunch menu items.",

    "text": "I think this place has the potential for a higher rating, but I just wasn't that impressed based on my personal experience.   Maybe I just didn't order the right item, or it was the ridiculously long wait to get our food, but I don't quite understand the hype over this place.  It's great that it has a separate vegan menu, and tries to use locally sourced organic ingredients whenever possible, but that shouldn't cause such a long time to prepare the food.  Our wait time actually wasn't as bad as some other reviewers but it was still uncomfortably long.  20 to 30 minutes is way too long in my book, especially considering we came when this place wasn't even busy.  My wife and I came here around 9:40 a.m. on a Tuesday and there were only four other parties besides us so I can't understand why it took so long for us to get our food.  We had similar dishes at Kitchen Table the day before during a very busy brunch time, and we still got our food within 10 minutes.  As far as the food, it was mixed.  I liked the Short Rib Hash but was disappointed by Turkey Benny.  All other ingredients in the dish were fine but the turkey was extremely dry.  It was so dry, it felt like it was going to get stuck in my throat.  I initially wanted to send it back but didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for another dish.  I managed to finish half by using lots of citrus hollandaise sauce that came with this dish.  The hollandaise sauce tasted like a lemon bar, and was good by itself.  However, it didn't quite go well with rest of the items.  I thought it was too acidic for a dish that doesn't have much fat.  I don't know how some people are managing to wait 30-45 minutes just to get a table here.  I wouldn't wait that long even if the food was excellent. For people that are new to the area I would still recommend trying this place, but should only come during non-peak times.",

We arrived and checked in and within 10 minutes got a text message at 1135am that our table was ready. The sweet hostest sat us down and gave us menus to look over. We began talking and noticed after awhile that no one came to ask us what we wanted to drink or  acknowledge that we were there. So we waited a little longer and after about 15 minutes we left. We were disappointed at the lack of service that was not provided to us as we sat down. This is not a review of the food but of their service. I also have to mention that this would have been my second time eating here and the first time the good was great but I did notice a few people got our food before we did. I wish i could remember extactly what happened it has been at least 2 months since.",

Today we arrived for breakfast with the in-laws and were served cold / luke warm monkey bread, and dirty side plates! When we were seated at the table there was a pesky fly hovering over us the entire meal. And lastly, the bathrooms were subpar.  Hopefully Jared and his wife read this review and realize today's experience among the past few visits as well need attention. It breaks my heart when a thriving, successful business starts to have more issues consistently. Everyone has a few flaws or mistakes that can be overlooked, but as a Duchess of \"CK regular\" there's a sincere concern. Please train new staff so they're as spectacular as your veterans, please wash your plates and check the temperatures of your dishes.",

Personally, I was expecting a bit more in relation to the serving size to price ratio but I was still very excited to eat. In the end, while none of the food particular jumped off the page for me, it was still very satisfying for the mid-price point that we paid.   I will say however that I did appreciate that they had very considerate menu options for GF, Vegetarian, Vegan, etc. I also really like the idea that they update their seasonal menu items frequently, so I hope to be back soon to try another food adventure.",

I've never seen so many servers and the manager/owner standing around doing nothing. Disappointed. Trendy looking restaurant. Missed the mark. :(",

The atmosphere was amazing as it had an old farmhouse rustic yet fresh and modern feel. I ordered the red velvet pancakes of course and my partner ordered the salmon Benedict. While waiting I also ordered coffee and the bottomless mimosas ($16, not a bad deal).   When the food arrived it was presented so lovely. I really enjoyed the pancakes, however I feel like they could have had more of the cream cheese sauce on top. Or a side of syrup. I really enjoyed the salmon Benedict, the salmon was very fresh!   The server was sweet and checked in on us periodically throughout our meal! I definitely recommend this place and will be trying new dishes the next time we go!",

Super tasty, loved all the potatoes in it. Really good. -seasonal pop tart: not too sweet which i approve of and really liked it.  Price wise was as expected we spent about $35 for the above. Not including the juice that was about $9.  Love the decor and ambiance the place has. Staff was really friendly and helpful.",

I am super glad I went on Yelp to look for a place to eat lunch.  While I was perusing through the pictures and reviews, I decided I wanted the Smashed Avocado Toast!    As soon as we entered, we were greeted promptly with a big smile from the hostess which I thought was very welcoming and really sets a friendly mood!  Good job on that part!  We were seated promptly and given menus to decide what to order.  I learned I could order both breakfast and lunch items!  Yay!    Food:  - Smashed Avocado Toast - Very tasty and avocado was creamy on a toasted ciabatta which paired well.  Favorite dish of brunch.  - CK House Burger - Very tasty  Meat cooked to your liking, I usually go with well-done.  The tomato jam used is pretty good too.   - Truffle Fries - I really liked these fries because it was thin and crispy.  And truffle oil?  Nothing can go wrong with that!   Baked Goods: - Granola Bars - Super delicious granola bars!  I have no idea what they use but the sweetness of it is so addicting!    - Nutella Cronut - Their cronut was very delicious.  Slight crunch but still soft and flakey!  It was perfect with the spread of nutella on the top!  Definitely gonna get this again.    - Chocolate and Banana Loaf - I didn't really care for it, was a bit too dry.    - Cronut Holes - I'm guessing it's just the left over dough and deep-fried.  My brother didn't really like it, I think he got a dry one, but the one I ate was pretty good!  Coated in sugar and a bit soft on the inside.    Parking - easy to find.  Large parking lot in front.   Service - Great!  No complaints!  Hostess was friendly, warm and welcoming.  Our server was quick, checked up on us periodically and friendly.",

    "text": "Cute breakfast pastry spot at the edge of Henderson.  A group of us girls decided to host a holiday brunch here with the theme being \"an ugly sweater and white elephant party exchange\". Craft Kitchen has a private room for a large group that is enclosed in glass which also has a closing glass door. You are seated away from the other guests; however  you can look through the glass room  and they too can look back into the Glass Room . Which makes the rooms semi-private.  A number of my friends ordered their bottomless mimosas which they really enjoyed during our visit. I ordered the chicken and waffles which was really good and spicy. The waffle was very flaky and the chicken was fried nicely.  The chicken and waffles came with a pickled jalapeno and pickled jalapeno maple syrup. The syrup had a hint of spice and heat with a taste of sweet as well. While there we didn't have the opportunity to try their pastry from their pastry bar, however another one of the guests did order a tray of pastries that she would take to a party later that night. Overall Craft Kitchen is a place that I would tell people to try especially for breakfast and I would like to go back and try it one more time without a group of people.",

They were still able to deliver a fantastic product with timely service. To complement the quality of food, their decor is great, along to the vessels used for service. The best part? The value! Yes, more expensive than some of the other breakfast joints, but their quality is far superior.  Items ordered:   Chicken and What? - Fantastic Smoked salmon - Better than fantastic Turkey Benny - Good, just a tad dry...its turkey though! RV pancakes - Very good  The coffee was very good. They have been open for less than two months, and already killing it.  One small \"opportunity for improvement\" would be to work a little with the staff, so they would smile a little more often. By no means the service was not excellent, just that you can read a little stress on their faces, due to business pressure. They still were polite and efficient, though.

Good job on the save there. - The atmosphere was loud, but only due to other customers (several groups of loudly cackling house wives). - I didn't try the coffee products, but they seem like they're trying to serve gourmet coffee / espresso at those prices, but nobody knew anything about their beans & they have automated machines that make the coffee - not really hitting it home in that area.  I'll try it again. I'm neutral at this point. Maybe next time they'll deliver better on the service side and it'll get a bump up to 4 stars!",

The chicken and waffles dish is also one of our go to options which doesn't disappoint, again the combinations of flavor on this dish are awesome from the pickled jalapenos to the fried chicken to fluffy waffle. If you're in the mood for a lunch option the burger is also a great option and both the truffle fries and the sweet potato fries with the maple bacon aioli are great too! After you finish your meal you must save room for dessert they are all homemade and are all delicious. The cronuts are by far my favorite option with Nutella on top!!

    "text": "I was really excited about this place because of the good reviews. We waited for a seat inside for about 27 minutes! Wow! I asked the hostess if you needed reservations she said no, unless it's for a large party of 10 or more. Funny, because the couple that came 5 minutes after us was seated prior to us. We were a party of 2 as well. :(  We ordered coffee, strawberry lemonade, beef hash, and breakfast croissant sandwich = $32 plus tax & tip not included. $40 for our meal. We tip good because our waitress was really nice and polite. My husband said the food was okay, nothing special. The beef hash had great flavor. It would have tasted even better if it was served HOT not room temperature.  The decor is really cute, retro outdoor feel and clean. But as busy as it was, I wondered why they had all that room in the front left area upon walk in? Why not put 3 more tables there so there's more seating = more money = less waiting = better customer service?",

Baked goods to eat there or carry out. Nice friendly service. These people have worked in big name kitchens, and it shows in their work. Also the best damn coffee on this side of town.",

The pesto aioli is complimentary on the sandwich. But with the added Italian meats it give the sandwich a slight sweet, salty flavor. The salad that Comes with the melt has a phenomenal vinaigrette flavor. Light but packed with tons of flavor.",

I came around 10:30 on a Monday and it wasn't terribly busy. The hostess was easily the nicest person I've ever met, and let me know their pastries are running low, but to make sure to check them out. The weather outside was perfect, so I snagged a table for me, myself, & I and started off with a cup of coffee and a homemade pop tart. The coffee was fantastic, but I wasn't too impressed with the pop tart, I'd skip it. Wish I would have gotten there earlier to have a better selection.   I ordered the salmon Benedict and I was soooooo glad I did. They have a lengthy vegan menu and I was really tempted to keep it light & healthy but decided that would be for another time.  The server was quick & efficient and I only wish that this location were closer to my house!!",

There's definitely something in the water or something to the way this spot is managed because the staff always seems so excited to engage their guests. The food selection is great, the ambience/deco is minimal and so tasteful.  Today I dined by myself with Emily as my server, and she was quick attentive and polite. Gave me an honest recommendation that I followed -- the protein fix -- and I wasn't disappointed. Paired it with a matcha latte with almond milk. Great meal, filling but not bloating. But beware! Their house made salsa definitely has a kick to it, which is great if you can handle the heat!  All in all, this is one posh and pleasant neighborhood brunch spot that I'll come back to over and over again!",

We had cappuccino's, cronut holes, croissant sammy, a Cinnabon/muffin, omelette and an amazing concoction called a cruffin that had strawberry and a scrumptious custard filling.  The decor is clean, lots of light and an ideal setting for friends/family/dates. Our server Katie was friendly, personable and more than helpful when it came to our indecisiveness on what all to try.  If you haven't been here yet make sure you try it out!",

    "text": "Hidden breakfast/brunch gem in Henderson. I met a friend here at 9am on a Sunday for breakfast, and by 11am there was a line out the door of hungry people waiting for a table.   PROS:  + They have an entire separate vegan menu loaded with fantastic yummy options.  + Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable about both the regular and vegan menus.  + Avocado toast was crunchy, creamy and flavorful and the vegan cinnamon roll was soft, sweet and warm, perfect combo.  + They have freshly squeezed juice options!  CONS:  - It seems to get very busy around 11am - 12pm, so either get their early or prepare to wait  TIP(s): They have so many options, I would recommend ordering a few and sharing. Also, as stated above it gets busy so if you can try to get there before 10:30am - 11am on the weekends.",

I highly recommend you visit this place! If possible, I recommend checking in ahead of time via the Yelp app because otherwise they may be on a wait. Using the check-in feature via Yelp, we ended up waiting less than 15 minutes vs 45.

It wasn't too busy fortunately so we were seated right away. The host thoughtfully asked if our son wanted crayons to keep him entertained which we gladly accepted. Unfortunately, those never came but no big deal. Seating inside is very spacious and the restaurant is very clean. The prices are on the higher end but the food wasn't anything to write home about. Don't get me wrong, everything tasted great but I'm not convinced the prices match the taste but keep in mind that most of the menu are organic, etc so it makes sense. The staff were very friendly and attentive. I recommend anyone stopping by for breakfast, brunch, or lunch if they are in the area.",

    "text": "Stop #2 on the \"OMG, WHY HAVEN'T I BEEN HERE SOONER\" tour...  CRAFTkitchen is one of those places located far enough away to make it seem virtually impossible for me to make it over there without a great deal of personal hardship. In other words, it's outside of that 10-mile radius for Las Vegas residents that makes it seems as though it's located on another planet. What's up with that, anyway?   With that said, I finally made it over for brunch on a beautiful almost-spring Saturday morning with some girlfriends. The stars must have aligned for this journey because the 215, Eastern, and the CRAFTkitchen parking lot were relatively easy to maneuver. Furthermore, the wait for a table was only a few minutes. Thanks, universe!   The restaurant itself is wonderfully well-lit and open. The seating is comfortable; though in our booth, we were close enough to the surrounding tables to get a good look at their food (not a bad thing) and to eavesdrop on their conversation (if we were inclined to do so).   The menu covers all the brunch classics with unique touches that don't make you feel like a total lame for ordering yet another benedict. Looking back at the meal, I appreciate how well everything was prepared. I left my meal both satisfied and with a list of all the things I need/must/will try on my next visit.   This is one of those places where it's great to go in a small group with friends who are willing to eat family style or share plates. Thankfully, my group was completely down for this plan so we were able to order quite a few items, including:  - Smashed Avocado Toast. I tell myself over and over that I can make this myself but, damn, this one's good.   - Crustless Quiche of the Day. We had bacon and cheese. It was delicious, but perhaps a tad bit on the small side.   - Pork Carnitas Benedict. I had my doubts and they were quickly erased. This was beautifully done.   - Chilaquiles (made vegan with soyrizo). I'm really picky about the chips used in a chilaquiles. These were perfect.  - Mimosa. Having driven the 15 miles from home because I didn't have the energy to chat up a Lyft driver, I opted for one $8 blood orange mimosa. There is a bottomless option for $16 if you can muster up the chattiness to let someone else drive. Here's my thing with mimosas: I don't really do juice. I'd rather just have a glass of bubbles. THESE mimosas though... consider the juice to bubbles ratio nailed, everyone.   - Coffee. I've been drinking a lot of free office coffee. Because free. It sucks. It's almost undrinkable on most days. The coffee at CRAFT was a real treat. So smooth.    We also got a few baked goods. Frankly, CRAFTkitchen is worth a visit just for carby sweet and savory goodies.   - Ham and Cheese Kouign Amann. GET IT WARMED UP AND THANK YOURSELF FOR BEING YOUR BEST FRIEND IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD  - Vegan Cinnamon Roll. Also great. Warm. It. Up.   - Vegan Blueberry Lemon Scone. You know it's good when you question its lack of dairy.   - Monkey Bread. Ours was a little bit overdone, but not enough for it to be problematic. It was still gooey in the best way possible.   I'm hopeful to make a return trip for more brunch madness soon and am eager to try dinner... if and when I can get my mind wrapped around driving this \"far\" again.",

My favorite things about each dish are as follows: the thick Niman Ranch ham and the zesty citrus Hollandaise sauce made the CRAFT Benedict extra delectable, the cobbler crumble, caramel sauce, and the whipped cream were perfection on the Apple Cobbler Pancakes, and lastly my favorite things about the Carnitas Omelet were the avocado salsa and the carnitas (so sooo good together).",

It has the right amount of sweetness, it's not greasy and the flavor is perfect. Perfect with mimosa. :)  Highly recommend this place, local friendly and everything in the menu is delicious!",

Located in a strip mall behind Osaka's, on Eastern between Horizon Ridge and Sunridge.  They have some outdoor seating, and when you walk in it is very simply decorated, clean, with plenty of light from the windows. They even have a back room area for larger groups. We were quickly greeted by the host and sat.  Service was outstanding, maybe 3 minutes before drink orders taken and 8 minutes before food order. Refills of ice tea and water were prompt.  I ordered the Turkey Benny, and my friend went with the French Dip. Rave reviews on both meals. My Turkey Benny had plenty of turkey, grilled tomatoes, avocado, and perfectly poached eggs. The citrus hollandaise sauce was delicious, with a nice hint of butter taste. It's not a huge meal that will fill you up, but nicely sized and perfect for my lunch. My friend raved about the beef in his french dip.  Overall, great place to come and have breakfast or lunch, and weekend brunches. It wasn't too busy when we went, and filled up about halfway while we were there. I didn't explore the bakery or coffee selections so I can't comment on that. Fresh ingredients expertly prepared. Enjoy!!",

We found this place highly recommended on YELP so we put our name on the list online and headed over. We waited maybe 2 minutes for a table (highly recommend putting your name on the list to avoid the wait) and Susan, the manager seated us. She was very gracious. We were lucky enough to have JP as our server. He was so attentive and had some great recommendations. We tried the Cuban sandwich (our overall favorite and something we would come back for),a mocha latte (oh my goodness HEAVEN), a chicken pot pie (good but not our favorite), and the avocado toast (DELISH). We also had some bottomless mimosas. We asked to speak to the manager to RAVE about JP (yes the service was THAT good) and told her it was our first time and we would definitely come back. She packed up some pastries for us to take home! My goodness what amazing service. I feel like good service is hard to find in Vegas but this place takes the cake. We will definitely become regulars. Thank you JP and Susan for showing us our new favorite brunch spot.",

Our bottomless champagne never disappoints.  My peach salad was awesome, the beef sliders were huge, and the kids tenders were perfect for two kids to share.  We were stuffed but had a tiramisu to share.  I thank Katie and Devin again for always a great job.  See u soon!!",

The turkey benny is a nice twist that they have come up with as they use real pulled turkey with a home made hollandaise sauce that you pour on top of the benny.  I still want to try their home made chorizo and some of their other items as well.  But do yourself a favor and make sure you either leave room for their baked goods or take some home with you.  Sticky buns, scones, COOKIES, and croissant are some noteworthy baked items.  Seriously, they are all good.  Take some home to the family and you'll have a happy household.  If you're from out of the area, it's worth the drive to try this spot.  I'm gonna try their home made pop tarts next time.",

Service is excellent and friendly. But the real star here is the food.  Offerings are not your standard bacon and eggs fare. Short rib hash, smashed potatoes, avocado crostini, pastries, caprese sliders are brightly flavored and beautifully presented.  Future adds will be housemade breads for purchase/take home.  Stop in near their 3 pm close and they will sell you left over housemade slider buns and pretzel rolls at a discount. Check this place out!",

    "text": "This place is awesome and we will definitely be going back. We first tried their food at the Yelp event Lions, Tapas, and Scares. The fresh barrata and pumpkin soup was delicious so we had to come in for brunch. My husband got the bottomless mimosas so he could try one of each. His favorite in order was raspberry, white peach, blood orange, then pomegranate. They were a little slow on the refills but they were busy. They did not skimp on the champagne. I had a mocha and it was high quality. We started with the monkey bread and it was to die for; ooey, gooey, sticky, buttery, sweet deliciousness. For our meal my husband got the croissant sandwich. He asked for the egg over easy which it came out hard but other than that it was good. He also had a side of sweet potato fries with maple bacon aioli which he liked. I got the acai bowl which was beautiful. I have definitely had better smoothie bowls but I think that had to do with the berries being out of season and tart. The coconut and granola on it were good. I got a side of turkey sausage which was extremely dry, probably because it was made with turkey breast. It was also $4 for a small patty, I wouldn't order it again. Next time we will try other things off the menu since some items weren't our favorite, but I know they have lots of great options to try and think they have 5 star potential.",

    "text": "This place is pretty solid. Quality of the ingredients and presentation is off the charts. Big league attention to detail.  Don't expect anything here to be your basic b**** variety. Everything, from the silverware, plates, and the cream holder for the coffee is next level. You are not going to see pre-packaged vacuum sealed artificial- imitation plastic synth creamer containers in a little bowl in the corner like you would see in a run down diner, no, you get a stylish, contemporary ceramic container with FRESH cream. Those little things do make a difference. In addition, they have some very interesting menu items and the taste profiles harmonize pretty well together most of the time.  Something I really like is their \"Sweet\" stuff, like pancakes and other sweet things are pretty awesome. A lot of places just have stuff like that as an after thought, something to fill space on the menu.  It does not get a 5 though, for several reasons, mainly because it is kind of expensive. I am probably a couple of tax brackets too low to afford eating here on a regular basis. Ok... I am exaggerating a little bit, for the type of food you are getting, it is a really good value if you consider the quality of the ingredients and attention to detail put into it. But still, expect to pay about double compared to going to Denny's.    The other reason I don't give it a 5, and this is probably really petty, is the staff seems slightly too reserved. I am not saying they need to act like a bubbly teenager working at chick-fl-a, but it would be nice to see a little more bounce, a little more glow, a little more pep.   Also, this may be a plus for some people, but the clientele who frequent this establishment are a little too pretentious for my tastes. I'm talking about the kind of people who look like they think that they have an inherent superiority over the plebs because they spent $15 on a kale-infused, gluten free, acai berry , fair-trade, quinoa loaf for brunch.  Despite all that, solid 4/5. This would make a great place to take someone on a date as well.",

First of all I have never sat in more uncomfortable seating, chairs are made for children not adults, benches take riding the pine to a whole new level. My breakfast was served on a side plate sized plate, and the forks are for children's hands. There are no choices for toast, I was served two very small dried out hard tac crumbling pieces of something that even starving birds would ignore. There are no choices for jam, I was brought strawberry jam, that's it for your choices. They served my bacon and eggs with sprouts, are you kidding? Sprouts! The eggs, smashed potatoes, and bacon were cooked perfectly. I also thought the service was excellent. My breakfast was over priced by 20% by Henderson standards. This restaurant was recommended to me by a friend who said their brunch was to die for, maybe so but my experience during a weekday morning visit was simply terrible. My advice, don't screw around trying to be trendy.",

I dearly miss the forager sandwich, but they are constantly adding inventive tasty items to the special menu and the regular menu doesn't change too much, which I appreciate. The French Dip is lean, I haven't experience tough, fatty, or grisly in it yet and I've ordered it about 10 times. I love the smashed toast with the sunflower seeds, micro greens and avocado. If you'd like a sugar coma definitely come on a weekend when they have the churro waffles on the specialty menu, you can't put your fork down. And of course, homemade pop tarts!!! I've heard some complaints about slow service, and you just have to understand, they get SLAMMED on weekends for brunch, and everything is cooked to order and fresh, so of course there could be a chance for a wait. But it's definitely worth it. And if you ever do have an issue, management is attentive and happy to make it right given the opportunity. Love love love!",

This hash was awesome with smashed and crispy small Yukon potatoes and flavorful short ribs.  Maybe the best part was the fresh brewed coffee. No refills but a fresh cup brought to my table.

    "text": "This place is a lot cuter in real life! As soon as you come up - you see some pallets turned into planters which gives the place a bright entrance. As soon as you walk in, you'll see the counter along with  a display of their desserts. There are a few booth seats along the window, along with a separate room that you can see into through glass. They also have these cute little square salt & pepper shakers along with a mini plant on each table.  My friend and I got the Smoked Salmon, Red Velvet Pancakes, and the Sweet Potato Fries. Everything came out pretty quickly and looked amazing! All the dishes were very colorful. The prices can be a bit high for the portions, but that's just my opinion.   Smoked salmon: comes with two little pretzel buns, some sort of sauce, a decent amount of salmon, some micro-greens and some little green things that I had no idea what they were. Something in there was really salty so it wasn't as enjoyable. I believe it was those little green things that made it pretty salty.  Red velvet cakes: comes with 4 little red velvet cakes, cream cheese icing, white chocolate (?) shavings, and some raspberries & blueberries (like 4 of each...). These tasted exactly how they should but they were a bit dry, so I wasn't able to finish all of them sadly.  Sweet potato fries: skinny sweet potato fries and a side of crack sauce (maple bacon aioli). Tasted how you would expect them to! Some of the skinnier fries were a bit burnt though.  The servers were really nice and pleasant. I can't remember their names because there were about 3 who helped us out. They always checked up on us and tried to have little conversations with you. I would consider this place a hidden gem! This place is a bit of a drive but I would consider coming back.",

Nice balance of tart with sweet, and the creamy meringue was a perfect topping) -corned beef hash (my friend enjoyed it, the side of mustard sauce was really flavorful) -butternut squash hash (came with two eggs, and the potatoes were not typical hash style, but were whole roasted fingerling type potatoes with were perfectly crispy on the outside and really delicious) -vegetarian breakfast burrito (stuffed with chili relleno. I asked for their homemade hot sauce which brought the burrito to a new level. Their avocado tomatillo sauce had a nice tang but was not spicy enough for me. Hot sauce was an extra charge (0.75 I believe) -blood orange mimosas (weekends only, one for $8 or bottomless for $16) -dirty chai latte (light flavor, not the best I have had, but comes with a small biscotti which was light and flavorful)  I came two times over my stay! Really enjoyed my food and dessert, and the service was friendly and quick!",

We went during prime time, brunch on a Saturday, so the wait time was around 10 minutes which wasn't bad at all. The menu had a lot to choose from and was very affordable (ranging from $10-12); all the food, and even the coffee, tasted wonderful; service was great and fast; bakery items were also cheap and delicious. Overall I highly recommend this place since there aren't too many classy yet fairly priced breakfast/brunch places out here.",

It is small and fills up quickly but has some seating outside as well. The staff is very friendly and on top of everything, especially when we told them we were first timers. We partook of their Bottomless Mimosas that come in three flavors, Pomegranate, Orange, Blood Orange. For brunch my wife had the Chicken and What? (Chicken and Waffles with Jalapeno Syrup), holy smokes was it good. I had the Chorizo Scramble Skillet (Chorizo, Scrambled Eggs, Smashed Potatoes, Cheddar Cheese), again it was great. Remember, they're only open for breakfast and brunch and can run out of some popular items, so make sure you get there early. We look forward to returning.",

    "text": "First time trying this place, at the request of my husband. I like fresh, homegrown, organic ingredients, and he used that to get me to go! I also like supporting local small business.   The place was packed! We got the last empty table inside of the restaurant. That told me that this place was going to be good. The decor is super cute, and the bathroom is clean. Love all of the plants everywhere, including the herb garden outside.   Server came right over after we sat down with water. I didn't catch his name, but he had a long black point tail. He was really good! As it was our first time here, we had to read the entire menu over, and the server was kind enough to give us a couple of minutes several times to decide what we wanted.   My little one ordered hot chocolate, which she loved! She was delited that it came out so pretty. They do flat whipped cream with chocolate plaid like lines on top. Plus, it was really yummy! Big hit.   I ordered the butternut squash hash. Whatever they put on that squash was so addictive. This was one of the best things I have had in a long time. Everything in it was delicious.   My little one ordered the mini chocolate chip pancakes. She was full from the hot chocolate (ha!) so I ate half of her pancakes. They seriously need to put these on the adult menu, because they were awesome. I would come back just for these.   My husband got the CK house burger. It was gone in about 30 seconds. He said it was delicious as well. He also got a side of garlic french fries. Yum!  We also got my daughter a cake pop to go!  Its a little pricey, but that's to be expected for good quality food. Overall, 5 stars for sure!!",

All was excellent. Service was fine.  The indoor-outdoor vibe of the restaurant is great and on-trend.  The reason for a minus star is the fact that seating is difficult, and depending on the time, you will wait a while for a table.  We came at the end of their brunch (before they closed) to avoid this, but then we felt we were rushed to get out of there before they shut down.",

The food was delicious as well, the only thing I'd say is that there was a large portion of my side compared to entree, and while I love potatoes I wasn't too big of a fan for how they do them. Otherwise, definitely still worth it to keep coming here and try their other options. Well priced as well.",

I have also had the monkey bread, sweet potato fries, pork carnitas omelet, and oatmeal.   Follow them on Instagram. They post weekend specials.

Took about 10 minutes to get water - we perused the menu for another 10 minutes - placed order. The main reason that I took hubbs there was the monkey bread that was the 1st thing we ordered. We were told that all the monkey bread was gone & if we wanted it we had to get there early.  You would think that the kitchen had the skill to be able to plan for a holiday on a Sunday sales, it is not that hard, especially because it can be made & panned ahead of time.  Settled on just ordering peach Kouign-amann, a breakfast burrito sauce & jalapeno on the side & short rib grilled cheese with salad with ranch, garlic Parmesan fries, 1 ice tea with lime that turned out to be some kind of flavored tea. The server said she could slice a lime for the tea. Finally got the tea at about the time we were served that was never refilled. Had to ask for sauce & jalapeno, salad had vinegar on it. All the food was good. Not memorable, a little bland, but good. Overall with a half an hour drive from across town - not worth it.  For $38.10 should have gone to the buffet @ Green Valley Station.",

Found it on Yelp (of course) while looking for a breakfast place to load up on before driving to Red Rocks.  It's located in a busy strip mall district but we easily found parking right out front and walked in and were pleasantly surprised by the lack of wait.  We were sat at a cute quiet corner two person booth.  BOOM.  Already starting off well.   I ordered a soy chai latte and it was promptly brought out with a small biscotti cookie.  Yum!  It was delish.  The carafe of orange juice was fresh and delicious as well.   There were several items I wanted to try on the menu --- but I ended up going with the avocado toast which had smashed avocado, sesame seed pesto, greens and a poached egg on ciabatta with greek yogurt topped with fresh berries and homemade granola.  I also tried the monkey bread which was DELICIOUS.  I want to try turkey sliders, cinnamon rolls, the acai bowl, veg omelete, breakfast burrito, etc. etc.  This is def. going to be a place I haunt next time I come to Vegas.   Service was great and we had great conversation with a nice lady who sat at the table beside us and was a local business owner.    Excellent experience with great food, good service, and great healthy ingredients and menu options!",

The staff is always friendly and eager to help. Very knowledgeable on the menu and always smiling. One of the most customer service friendly restaurants around.  Restaurant itself is bright and always clean. Decor is very modest. The real star of the show is the food.  My go to is always the lox platter. It's presented on a homemade pretzel bun. Cream cheese, tomato's, Red onions, lox, capers and micro greens. What more do you need! Firm 5/5. Not bad for about $12.   They always feature a different pancake plate as well. Blueberry lemon pancakes have been the favorite but the bananas foster also were amazing. Both are 4/5 and 5/5.  Another go to is the chillaquilles. Yes it's s staple around town but the salsa is what turns this one up a notch. We do the vegan way with no chorizo. Ask for extra sauce on the side.  Chef owned and run you can taste the difference here. By all means make the trek to Henderson!",

    "text": "So today at 12:00 I finally went into CRAFTkitchen today for a sit down meal since I usually just get my food to go.  We were greeted by the hostess and was told it was about a 45 minute wait. We weren't super starving so we were okay sticking around.  Once we were finally seated, we took a look at the menu. They have everything here from birthday pancakes to avocado tacos. Everything looked and sounded so yummy we had a hard time figuring out what we were going to order!  So we started off with a Bloody Mary (for my guy) and a mimosa (for me!)  The presentation of the Bloody Mary was SUPERB!  It was stacked high with bacon, shrimp, and olives.  We finally decided on ordering the carnitas omelette and the chorizo scramble skillet.  Our food came out within 15-20 minutes which was super quick considering how slammed they were!   The Food:  This is where I had to knock off a star. In the past when I've gotten take out, the food had succeeded my expectations. Unfortunately that wasn't the case dining in. Both of our dishes had ZERO flavor. My carnitas were dry and the chorizo scramble was pretty bland.  Again I was so confused because previously I have had nothing but amazing flavor from this place.   In the end, I will be back to try some other dishes, and maybe just stick with my favorite \"Avocado Toast.\" But in all honesty the service form our waitress today was probably one of the best I've received in all of Henderson!",

Not knowing anything about the place, I did what most people would do and check yelp. Looking at the pics, I just knew I would enjoy the food here. Also, the reviews of this place were positive.  Like other breakfast places, it was packed on a Saturday. One of the most awesome features that I seen on yelp is the check in ahead feature. It tells you how long the wait is and puts your name on the wait list. Essential you are on the list while driving down. Once getting there, we waited about 5-7 more minutes for a table to open. We were seated inside although they do have patio seating but it was just too cold for me.  All of the food look so delicious. I ended up getting the short rib hash. The meat was so tender and flavorful. The potatoes not mushy. It was just a great pairing. I look forward to eating there again and trying some of the other dishes.",

Maybe a bit spicy for those don't like spice but the flavors were perfect otherwise. The monkey bread was awesome too! Slightly crispy on the top but our favorite part was the soft parts on the bottom. Many times with these types of restaurants you get either good for or service but with this local spot you get both.

The selection was pretty impressive, considering CRAFTkitchen isn't a vegan restaurant. The dishes were largely vegetable dishes with the option of adding meat substitutes. They offered Gardein chick'n and soy chorizo, which was probably also a store bought brand, but it was nice having the option. We opted for the soy meats, but the dishes were great vegetable dishes on their own. The hash consisted of perfectly cooked butternut squash cubes, grilled onions, and kale pieces sprinkled throughout. The smashed potatoes were perfectly cooked and well seasoned, but there was a disproportionately large amount of them. I desired more of the kale and caramelized onion. The fried avocado in the tacos were generously portioned; the texture of the crispy coating along with the creamy avocado made for a luscious bite. The black bean was smooth and the crema sauce was flavor-packed. The soyrizo added that extra hit of spice.   Service was attentive and friendly. The decor was hipster-y, but not in a pretentious way. Easy parking in a shared lot.",

    "text": "On my visit the day I visited Craft Kitchen, all I wanted was a salad.  I checked Yelp and saw that Craft Kitchen serves healthier foods and so I made the decision to head on over.  Especially because it is super easy to get to from the back roads from where I work.  My lunch is at 11am and I got here not too soon after.  The restaurant was actually busy.  I took a seat by the window and searched and searched and searched for a plain ole salad, but none was to be found.  They only have the fancy kind.  Nothing on the menu was appealing to me either.  So I ended up with the buffalo chicken wrap. But it's vegetarian, so it really isn't chicken.  The service was slow.  So slow, that I almost didn't make back to the office on time.  While I waited a long while, I was noticing that those that had ordered before I got there, were waiting longer than I was.  The restaurant was nice looking.  They have a nice glass enclosed conference room that appeared could be reserved ahead of time for people to have luncheon meetings in. And, I thought the service is good too.  My meal finally came, but only left me 10-minutes to down my food.  The \"chicken\" was fine, but the buffalo seasoning was too tangy for me like it had too much vinegar.  Thank goodness for the fried potato chips it came with.  That was the only thing I really enjoyed.  Because of the delay in getting my meal and pressed for time to finish it, I couldn't wait anymore for someone to drop off the check and for me to pay it.  I ended up having to walk up to the cashier to pay.  It's kind of a bummer because I was looking forward to trying this place out for quite sometime, only to be disappointed. Maybe healthier vegetarian cuisine just isn't for me.",

Came specifically to try their Kouign Amann and boy was it worth the wait and the travel. Since we waited a while before our orders was taken, they compensated our long wait by giving us complimentary Kouign Amann and cronuts both delish. I had their chilaquiles and my son had the chicken and waffles, the chicken was moist and tender and the chilaquiles was so flavorful. Will definitely be back to try.  Special shoutout to our server as well for the exceptional service. Will definitely be back to try their K.F.C. Korean fried chicken!",

Visiting my best friend who moved there, he found this chic, adorable spot. It's got great decor, a hip vibe, and really cool staff. It's in the middle of an unassuming plaza, so don't judge the restaurant by the cover.   I had a really hard time ordering because there were so many things I wanted. And cruising on Yelp didn't help as there were many beautiful photos. Arriving at 10:45 am on a Saturday, peak brunch hours. We were sat within 30 minutes.   I ended up getting the fried avocado tacos and boy am I glad. They were delicious, a fantastic texture, and as someone who hails from Los Angeles, a really good ode to Mexican food with a hip, modern twist.   The rest of my party was also incredibly satisfied with their dishes, from the bloody Mary's to the cups of coffee, brewed one at a time.   Highly recommend, 5/5 for ambiance, service (even though a bit slow at times, just relax & enjoy!), and food.   The food actually tasted as good as the photos looked.",

I can understand that some of their signature items may justify a higher cost....but I fail to see how this a applies to a sack of pancakes. This morning's breakfast consisted of a stack of regular (not the pancake of the day) pancakes $10.95, three pieces of bacon $5.00, and a cup of coffee $2.50. I can't speak for anyone else, but I think $18.45 for this breakfast is excessive and quite frankly indefensible! By the way the $18.45 does not include sale tax $1.48, and my 20% tip (on the entire amount) $4.00. Total bill: $23.93! I thought it was only the casinos that stole your money?

The last time I went in, I waited over an hour for my food. My brunch date had to get out of his seat to ask about the food. When the food was brought out it was cold. Who eats cold eggs Benedict? So, I then asked for something that wouldn't take as long and new. They took another 30 mins to cook the same meal. So I explained I'm in a rush and have to leave. I didn't ask for the same meal because it took too long the first time and the messed up the order. I prefer the smoked salmon vs the fresh salmon. Anyways, I didn't end up eating until 3 1/2 hours later.   Then today...my order was messed up. I love the fried capers but I got none. I wanted avocado spread on my English bread for my salmon Benedict. They brought me a big chunk on the side, happens every time. I didn't ask for my eggs on the side but they did it anyways, weird? Much? I asked to spice up my food, nothing. Didn't offer hot sauce or bring any. The server also forgot my coffee. I had to stop someone else after my food came and it still wasn't there.  Hopefully the owners and management see this review so they don't lose business. I have brought many friends here and refuse to go now. Everyone enjoys the food but when it doesn't come out in time, orders get messed up or it's served cold. You can't convince a friend to try it again when it happens the second time. Third time isn't a charm here!",

Craftkitchen is nothing special, food is okay and plating is clean but not enough food on the plate to fill your hungry stomach for the price.  Ordered a Red Velvet Pancake (5 little mini ones), a seasonal dish and a cup of tea for one person, cost $34. The portion is very very small. If you expect to leave this place feeling somewhat full, expect to spend more than $30 per person.    \"Chicken and What\" comes with 2 mini waffles and 2pcs of small chicken strip.   \"Chorizo Scamble Skillet\" the spices for this dish does not go well together. One bite and I will never want to eat it again.  Red Velvet Pancake comes with 5 mini size ones. It's fluffy and small, not worth the money.   Portion size is good for children.   You will notice these friendly staff keeps coming to your table asking if you would like dessert or anything else they could get you. The reason is they know you are not going to be full after these small clean looking plate of food.   If you are on a budget, this is not a place for you. If you want to try something new and different, this is new but not that different to other similar breakfast place. You could get the same kind of food elsewhere, better tasting and fills you up. If you know how to cook, you could make the same dishes for less, healthier and better tasting. You don't have to be a chef to make these dishes.   When it comes to taste and enjoying a good breakfast, this place is not for me.",

    "text": "2.5  Just not impressed with this place, like at all. I'm sure this review will receive the typical owner comment explaining away the legitimate issues I will address (ps owner where are you? There was zero owner/manager interaction with guests seen) but here goes:  My significant other and I spend every November in Vegas at the M Resort and I am always looking for places off the beaten path to eat at. More so, I specifically look for small businesses to support. When I bookmarked this place I was excited, walking out I was disappointed.   Regarding decor, it's  the typical \"new\" craft kitchen/gastropub standard decorative scheme. Coming from LA this has become common and we all know what I'm talking about; white tile, dark salvaged wood, herb/succulents, burnished steel. Been there, done that. We all know it's beautiful.   Our server, although sweet, seemed extremely overwhelmed and unsure of herself. Having worked in the hospitality industry for almost a decade I noted to my significant other \"there's too much people doing busy work and not enough servers on.\" Someone should talk to the staff and let them know if people's waters or coffees are empty, if there are dirty plates on the table, that rolling silverware or rearranging pastries is not the priority. Our server also forget the egg we requested on our short rib hash. It came after we were almost done (like three bites left). The egg should have  been comped, period or the whole meal offered to be remade as ordered.   Regarding the taste and quality of food. I have to agree with some other reviewers, the price point is about two to three dollars too high for each item. The short rib hash was very small and although delicious (not amazing) I know what it costs to locally source and profit margins. Our coffee WAS amazing though, so very high marks for that.  Additional notes to staff and owner: While I was sitting there and there was an obvious wait, some people came in and bypassed the line to sit down at a table and camp out while they put in a Togo order. None of the staff were brave enough to approach these people despite the over a dozen people that were already standing there waiting. Train your staff to be more proactive and  take responsibility for their environment or post a clear sign.   If I lived in the area, I wouldn't come back to eat, but I would probably grab a pastry and a Togo coffee.",

    "text": "After reading the reviews I was very enthusiastic about trying this place, love that it is locally owned, and near the Anthem area.   Walked in on a Sunday around noon for brunch. Not many tables, and very crowded. When you walk in it is very awkward, not clear where to ask for a table. After putting our name in we awkwardly stood next to the entrance as there wasn't a clear area to wait. Because the place is awkwardly laid out you feel like youre in the way. Servers walking through the 'waiting area' or lack there of. The wait was at least 30 minutes, which the hostess failed to mention when we put our name in, so we spent 30 minutes standing in the middle of chaos.   The food was good, but very overpriced for what it was. The portions were small, and the food although good, you can get the same quality for much less elsewhere. 2 adults and a child $75 bill.  Wouldn't mind paying the price if the service was better, and the waiting area/seating were not so awkward.  The service was very very slow. Especially waiting for the bill. Nearly 20min wait for the check, had to find someone to request it, and still took 10min to get it after that. You can't demand the high price and offer low quality service, it doesn't make sense.  For the price I would expect a stress free, well serviced dining experience, and Craft unfortunately did not deliver.  The decor was done very well, hope Craft Kitchen can work through some of the deficiencies, and continue to be successful. As for me I probably won't be going back.",

The truffle fries were skinny and crispy too, like Houston's fries. The portion sizes were perfect, enough food to be satisfied, but not stuffed.   I can't wait to come back to try the chorizo Shepard pie, shorts ribs, and ck market. I might even give and get the glutton free pastries.  They look like they are worth the calories and carbs.  The decor is cute and modern. It seems very well run considering they just opened a few days ago.",

Citrus hollandaise was surprisingly crisp and tasty. Turkey was a little odd being with eggs. And a couple stems in the micro greens that were very noticeable. Overall very good presentation great flavors and felt kinda light in the stomach for a benny. Service was okay although outside people seemed \"left out\". Five stars for good food good price and for support of new eats in the neighborhood. You could use some fresh juices or blends.  Good markup and healthy delicious add ons.",

Very spacious for the most part and very clean. The hostess was super attentive which was nice. Got seated right away.   One word to describe the food of this place? YUMMY!  I definitely had a hard time choosing what to eat here since everything looked so interesting and good! I ended up choosing the pulled turkey benny with a poached egg on top and a side of truffle fries because the cravings were real. My friend ended up getting the turkey burger with no jalapenos.   The pulled turkey benny was really tasty especially with the side of hollandaise sauce to dip it in. The sauce was very lemony which to me balanced all the flavors with the benny. The turkey burger, when it first came out, looked very plain until we saw the avocado spread, cheese, and sauce. Super juicy patty and very well balanced with the flavor as well.   Overall, I really loved this spot and would definitely try it again. Maybe for their happy hours on Fridays starting at 4pm will be next on my list. Can't wait to come back to this place!",

We got there about 11:30am and it was crowded but by time it was noon, there was a wait.

There's always a friendly hostess who organizes the crowd (if there is one) and finds you a place to sit. I have 3 kids under 4 and tend to wind up in the private dining room a lot (HA) which is fine by me! It's so cute in there, and as long as you call ahead to reserve it, it's yours! I hate to give away that secret but yeah..... Don't steal my table, people!!!! Lol.   I've had 3 different servers now. Katie, a gentleman with dark hair in a ponytail, and one other girl with dark hair. Boy, aren't I awesome with names? Anyway, all of them were so sweet and patient with my kids and I. They feed the masses with ease! Also, I came in here once with a friend of mine, Bobbi, and the manager who helped rectify a previous experience of hers was also AMAZING to us. Pretty much just the best service ever.   I've had quite a few different meals here, today happened to be the salmon Benedict, which is so full of flavor. Fried capers, I mean, come on. And the hollandaise sauce is made with angel tears, or something like that. The veg omelet is also amazing..... whatever that garlic sauce is, ASK FOR EXTRA OF THAT. Trust me, you will want more.   All of my kids are obsessed with the red velvet pancakes, which speak for themselves. My fiance ordered the breakfast burrito and loved it. They make their hot sauce in house and he says it's the best hot sauce in the world!!!! It's like a spread? Kinda? Almost? I dunno, it's definitely thicker than a sauce...... but I don't even like hot sauce and the stuff looks good to me!   Long story short, if you're looking for amazingly delicious, healthier-than-usual food, served by awesome people.... Come here!",

There's an area to eat at outside in case you want to enjoy the weather or if you just want to bring your doggies. It's really simple & very modern looking. Very LA to me, I loved it. The staff is also friendly & helpful. Katie served us today and she gave good suggestions.   I ended up ordering the C.K. special which included 2 eggs of your choice, bacon or turkey sausage (I got the turkey sausage & it was really flavorful), & smashed potatoes (omg so crispy & perfect!). My boyfriend ordered the French Dip which came with a salad on the side. He said he enjoyed his sandwich. We also ordered sweet potato fries that came with this sauce. I don't know what that sauce was, but it was pretty delicious. Oh & cant forget the chocolate chip banana bread. Soooo good! Must try.   This is a perfect place for having brunches. I would've ordered myself a mimosa, but that didn't go so well for me at another restaurant two days ago LOL. All in all, enjoyed my visit here. Will be back!",

    "text": "This is a nice place to dine and has a hipster feel to it.  This is a nice addition to Henderson, which reminds me of O.C. and the CAMP.  The food presentation is beautiful and a nice balance of the bad and the good (nutrition wise).  House crafted croissants, I couldn't resist but to order the buttery croissant sammy.  The sandwich is between a fried egg, 2 pieces of perfectly cooked crisp bacon, cheese and I added aioli sauce.  It was lacking a little bit of greens, so I snuck a few pieces of my mixed greens from my salad.  Flaky croissant from the outside, pillowy (not even a word) goodness on the inside and that makes it just buttery goodness.  My mother opted for the quiche of the day and that one bite I took had a good balance of eggs, cheese and lovely bits of bacon.  This was all baked on a moderate sized for one person quiche dish.    We both ordered from the early-hour menu versus the afternoon menu. The other set of dishes were shown on the flip side.  Either way, this is smaller portions, which is expected at these modern, quaint, well crafted food places.",

Bummer that I clearly ordered the wrong thing. Had the buttermilk pancakes, which tasted nothing like buttermilk pancakes. The pancakes itself were perfectly cooked, but sugar (and a lot of it) was added to the batter which was a shame. My husband had the eggs, potatoes and turkey sausage, which was flavorless. Avocado toast with poached egg was good. I clearly mucked up my order and will definitely avoid the pancakes if we head back.",

It's based solely on the food. The food was okay. My mimosa was passable. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but it's like they're trying to recreate the wheel. And somehow they just miss the mark.   One more thing, and not that this is the restaurant's fault, but the pretentious energy flowing through this place was palpable. Again, the service was OUTSTANDING & the coffee is pretty damn good. However, that being said, we won't be back.",

As soon as I walked in I was hit with a yummy smell of pastry. I don't know what it was but it smelled good almost like a bakery.  As I stepped more in, the aroma changed to food, and it still smelled yummy. Score!  The event I was attending was in there room that could accommodate 15-20 people, the walls were glass so u can see in and out.  I definitely think this room is good for private events, meetings and parties. The pastries that we had taste good, I look forward to trying there cupcakes and cookies- but out of the pastries I enjoyed the scone the most , it wasn't too sweet and had a balanced flavor with a bit of tart. I definitely will head back here to order from their menu. All the food I saw people eating looked tasty.",

We attempted to have brunch here a few times before, but the wait time was crazy by 10 a.m.   We were seated quickly and the waitress was super nice. I suggest starting off with the monkey bread. It's amazing. I got the breakfast burrito and he got the pork carnitas omelet. Both were gigantic. I'm not sure how anyone can finish these. More bang for your buck!  Pros: The food is delicious. The decor is cute. They have a legit coffee bar with bakery counter, so you're not drinking watered down sludge. The service is quick.  Cons: The wait time gets insane on the weekends. If you're hungry and impatient, I suggest getting there before 9 a.m.   I'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of CRAFTkitchen and would definitely consider myself a regular by now.  We were here celebrating a friend's birthday.  Had a group of 6.  We started with an assortment of pastries and cronuts.  The Nutella cronut was so freaking BOMB!!!!  The layers on that cronut were legit and light and flaky AF.  I was in heaven.  If you know me, you know I'm a fanatic for cronuts.  So this one was right up there with the original Dominique Ansel Bakery cronuts!!!  The cinnamon roll was huge and too sweet for me.  We also had the matcha green tea cronut which was tasty too.  The pumpkin muffin wasn't too sweet and pretty on point.  For lunch, I opted for something different and ordered the Pear, Pomegranate & Burrata Salad.  At the time, everything on that salad sounded delish.  When the meal came out, it was a beautiful presentation and looked yum.  When I took my first bite, it was just eh.  It didn't blow my mind and it wasn't as good as I thought it would be.  At a staggering $13.75 for a salad with just fruit and cheese, it's pricey!  I should have gotten the Citrus & Crab Salad which I've had in the past and so good.  Sorry pear salad but you were a disappointment.  My brother ordered the Chicken & What? which is always amazing here!  I'm in love with the pickled jalapeno maple syrup.  So good!!!  Our friends ordered the Short Rib Hash which is an OMG dish, had it and loved it.  So much flavor.  I was eyeing the Korean Shrimp Tacos and our friend ordered it.  I wish I got this instead of my pear salad.   Now I need to check out the CRAFTkitchen Friday Happy Hour events.  Soon I hope.",

Finally, tried the Sunday mimosa \"deal.\" Unlimited for $16 with orange, blood orange, and pomegranate. Blood orange was the clear winner.  The servings all small. Disappointed that the refill service was lacking.    There is something here for every palate. Can't decide whether to do a healthier/light meal, heavy, or sweet?  Make sure you go with friends that share. Friends that sample each other's plates are the best.  Last brunch, we had the avocado toast (huge debacle over who go more of the poached egg..j/k), chorizo skillet, chicken and waffles, salmon benedict, and quiche of the day with a side salad.  Our previous brunch, we had the red velvet pancakes, smoked salmon, and short rib hash.    Would order again: both salmon dishes, and short rib hash.  *Side note: bomb potatoes from the skillet  Let's not forget their enticing dessert case.  Ordered a few things here and there over the years.  Unfortunately, some forgettable.  They do offer pre-orders for some of their baked goods/breads for the holidays.  Interior is spacious, gorgeous natural light (for optimal food photo taking), and cute succulents adorned on tables.    *Extras: Private room for events/meetings *Changing table in the restroom for the bebes!",

Once I arrived inside, the hostess said, \"its gonna be a 5-10 minute wait\". I looked around the quaint restaurant and saw 15-20 open seats. She saw me look around and she felt compelled to say, \"well, I have to give the wait staff time 2 catch up\". She did not seat me for approximately 5 minutes after that. I thought to myself, I'm patient but she could have seated me @ a vacant table and gave me water/coffee. That was a little disturbing to me as I've never witnessed this as I've out around the country. I must say that after that awkward beginning I was questioning my decision to eat here. Needless to say, the food was served quickly and it was very good. Good ending to a weird episode at a restaurant.",

Here's the lowdown ~  THE GOOD + nice atmosphere + selection of vegan/vegetarian options   THE BAD  - decent, but slow service - small portions - simple and plain tasting food - pricy   For savory breakfast options, I've tried the Butternut Squash Hash and CK Breakfast Burrito vegetarian style. And while filling and made with quality ingredients, the flavors for both dishes were very simple, and just too plain for my taste. Each time, I've had to load up with hot sauce and ketchup to enjoy it. Granted, I like food that packs a punch and the food here? It's like a lil' love tap.  As for something I did like, I have enjoyed their avocado toast. And while it's hard to go wrong with avocado on toast, it's not very filling for the price.   Overall, CRAFT just isn't my thing.

She brings my food. The omellete was fine, but she brings me a pancake drizzled with blueberry sauce and blue berries with a side plate of cut strawberries. I explained to her that I didn't understand why my pancake arrived like this and she said they technically didn't have any strawberry sauce to make a strawberry pancake (why wasn't I told this in the first place???). I was confused and disapointed. I sent the blueberry pancake back and asked for a plain pancake instead. I also had to ask for a glass of orange juice twice. I don't think I'll go back. I may order from Uber Eats because the food was still good, but never again with that service!",

In fact, what used to be a few vegan offerings on the \"regular menu\" turned into a full-blown vegan menu a few months ago. Awesome!  I recommend the avocado tacos, the vegan butternut squash hash (add avocado!), and the farmers' market stack.  Service is consistently fast and friendly. The decor is simple, but tasteful. Yes, it can get loud when the restaurant is packed (and it is a popular brunch spot, so it usually is packed!), but I appreciate that this isn't a restaurant that blasts music at high volumes.  The two-person booths by the windows are cute and offer substantial privacy.",

I did take into consideration that it was Sunday morning and it would be busy... After waiting outside for 30-35 minutes then being seated on one of the many empty patio tables... we sit down and look over the menu, 20 minutes later we still haven't seen a server for drinks or anything for the matter. After another 10 minutes we tried to get a servers attention just to get some ice water (it's 95 degrees and sitting outside) no one paid any attention to us at all. So... we ended up leaving. I did notice when we walked out to leave a few servers standing talking to each other, yet no one said one word to us... the entire place is giant windows.... I work in the food service industry myself and understand a rush but to be completely ignored after being there an hour? I don't think that's cool..... I don't think we will be going back anytime soon and that sucks because the food the first time was great. Maybe it was a bad day but you can't ignore people like that. We were there for an hour total and got nothing but to look at the pretty pastry case. #SadMoments",

I was skeptical about the burger at first but after one bite I was happy I ordered it. The meat was fresh and the tomato jam was to my surprise a nice addition to the rest of the flavors. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal but Devin the manager was THE ABSOLUTE BEST! I really appreciate the way he went out of his way for my family. His recommendations were perfect. His service was top notch! I think we had \"waiter envy\" lol... We had already tried the brunch and enjoyed it so we thought we would give the dinner a try. The food was definitely worth it but the manager made the place worthy of a review. Devin you were AWESOME! We will definitely be back!",

I was just complaining the other day that Vegas isn't a breakfast town and we came upon this restaurant and were delighted with the food and atmosphere.  The menu is very gluten free friendly, which I like.  They also have a really great kids menu which has small, kid versions of the regular menu items.  I had the crustless quiche, and it was really great, I only missed the crust a little :) My husband had the salmon on pretzel roll and he loved it, it had a generous amount of salmon.  My daughter had the red velvet pancakes and I don't know if she will ever go back to regular pancakes again!  My only complaint is with the music.  They were blaring a country music station.  I would recommend that you pick more neutral music and play it at a lower volume.  Loud country music would definitely keep me from returning!  I also don't think it goes with the overall vibe of the restaurant or the clientele.",

The outdoor seating is cute and if you slouch low enough in your seat you can convince yourself you're in a cute neighborhood and not eating in a parking lot. The restaurant is bright and decorated nicely- a perfect spot for brunch or catching up with friends. Ask for a seat by the window- the bench is cuter and the two person table is cozy and bright.  Monkey bread: Yes, yes, yes. It's like a cinnamon roll, but better. For only a little over $5 the appetizer was perfect start to our brunch.  Strawberry lemonade: My first glass was too sour, not enough sweet. Second glass (yes, free refills!) was watered down. It wasn't worth it. Go with the alcoholic drinks instead.  Croissant Sammy: perfectly buttered croissant with PERFECT strips of bacon. The \"salad\" on the side was just leaves, light dressing and little chips on top. It was a nice touch, but it was too small to consider it a side.  Short rib hash: The short ribs were flavored nicely and the dish was filling. However, I liked the croissant sammy better.   There is a glass case with tons of cakes/cookies/macaroons for those who want to just stop in and take out. Closed off room in the back for big parties.  They serve breakfast all day. However, they close early so don't forget to check the time before you go!",

    "text": "They say everything happens for a reason--boy was I glad that Kitchen Table had an hour wait, because we opted to go to CRAFTKitchen instead for brunch. It's enjoying it's well deserved new restaurant popularity and it's definitely worth it--and the 25 minute wait to be seated. It's first come first serve and every table was occupied.   I hadn't ordered yet, but was thoroughly impressed by the vibe and decor--you would never imagine a place like this in a Strip Mall in Henderson, but it's just what the area needs because Lord knows I am not a fan of driving 30 mins to Summerlin or the like for these kinds of culinary experiences. The interior space was modern, industrial Americana  and offered a private dining space embellished with vertical gardens. There are also adorable pod like booths made of wood that offer an outside view. Tables are constructed of wood with succulent plants as centerpieces--very West Elm.   I was tempted to knock my 5-star rating down to 4.5 due to the service--but they just couldn't help it--they were slammed with a revolving door of non-stop guests for Sunday brunch. It did take a while for our server to take our order, but once placed, our food was out in a reasonable amount of time.   My guest and I decided to share a couple of items including the Chicken and What? (chicken and waffles), Red Velvet Pancakes and Truffle Fries--I know, what a mix right? As a Soul Food snob, from the South, the Chicken and Waffles were delicious and full of flavor. I only wish the portion was bigger as the waffles and pieces of chicken were small. Though we shared, we should have ordered two. Up next were the Red Velvet Pancakes--phenomenal as were the Truffle fries.   Just when we thought we were full, we had a little food envy of the table next to us as they had two orders of Monkey Bread--one for the table and one to go. No shame in our game we ordered a batch of the bread too--unreal! Warm, buttery and flavored with plenty of cinnamon and sugar. Tip: the best part is at the bottom of the pan. And another one: CRAFTKitchen just might one of the best new eateries on this side of town. Take that Summerlin.",

    "text": "It's too bad that we will never be returning to Craft Kitchen again. My husband and I have always been a fan of their food but the service has declined with each visit over and over. We have probably visited the restaurant more than 10 times; the food is good, coffee is excellent and it is close to home. We decided to give it another shot since we called and they said there was no wait for 2 people on a Sunday at 130 pm. My assumption is the restaurant was half empty on a Sunday (which most brunch places should have a 30 min wait min) because other patrons, similar to us, are just tired of their noticeably slow service. Since it was so empty inside we were hoping the service wouldn't be as timely as our previous experiences here. Sadly, no. After ordering our coffee, our drinks were delivered and our waiter dashed away without taking our food order. 15 minutes later, after I flagged him down that we were ready, he took our order. We waited.... waited and waited some more. 45 minutes later we were upset to see that food was being delivered to 3 other tables surrounding us that were seated almost 20 minutes after us. Since our waiter did not care to check up on us or inform us that our food was ready, I asked a food busser if she could check on our order.  She returned to tell us that new batter had to be made to make our pancakes. An update from our server would have been nice if there was a long delay from the kitchen.  The food was delivered after another 15 minutes of waiting and low and behold, my husband's order was incomplete.   To our server's defense, he constantly on the move, and overwhelmed with so many tables beyond his control. Maybe this explains his inability to check up on us. The restaurant needs serious modifications in their management structure. I wish this was our only poor experience at Craft Kitchen, but it was not. We love to support local businesses but unfortunately we will never return to this establishment nor recommend it to any of our friends and colleagues again.",

Nevertheless, this place is not for those who have a discerning palate or have a desire to dine in a pleasant environment.  The food is clean, I'll give them that. The portions are wimpy. While I can live with that, it just wasn't delicious... And it's really not that hard to make eggs taste good.

The potatoes in the dish were not just over seasoned, they were literally brined in salt.  The eggs themselves were over seasoned, but not inedible like the rest of the plate.  I ordered the Quiche of the day.  The flavor and ingredient profile was fine, except for over-seasoning again.  One dish could be excused as an anomaly, but 2 independent dishes, scream quality control issues from the kitchen.   Conversely my mother's side potatoes had no seasoning...  Other notable gripes: 1) We waited 15 minutes while there were several open tables.  More tables were bused and/or open than there were parties waiting.  2) Refills on drinks were upon customer request with drinks sitting empty for 5-10 minutes.  3) Waitress was excellent at being nice, but not providing good service.  Empty drinks most of the meal, only asked how the meal was 1 minute after arrival and was in robot mode asking if we wanted desert a 2nd time after being told no 1 minute before.  She was good at going through the motions and nice enough I guess.",

    "text": "The food was good. But not great. Especially for the price you are paying. The flavors on all of the dishes at our table except 1 completely missed the mark. The churro waffles were the best thing out there. The Craft Benedict had a slice of ham that would have been enough for 2 orders. It was way too thick. The hollandaise sauce was on point though. The rest was just kinda there. My husband got the protein fix and said there was so much sea salt, the rest of the flavors were hidden. Almost on purpose as he couldn't get anything good from the rest of it. My dad had the chilaquiles. Said it was pretty bland and about half way through was over it. The salsa was amazing though. My mom had the strawberry shortcake pancakes and cheesy grits. Said they were both pretty good. I would go back just for the Carmel latte though. Man o man was that good!! This is a local place that I wanted so badly to love in order to support a local business. But it just wasn't there. Will give it another shot sometime in the future and hope it was a one off. The table next to us left without eating much of anything or paying. Something had to be off this day.",

We had a baby shower in the private room and had to ask multiple times for a server to come in to take our drink order. A few weeks later I went in for lunch with coworkers and it took about 20 minutes for someone to take our order then another 30 minutes to get our food. I ran into some friends at another table during that lunch, and they had the same problem. It's become frequent enough at this point that I probably won't go back for a while. Hopefully they get it figured out because it used to be one of my favorite brunch/lunch places!",

You won't find a better cup of coffee from a Breakfast/Lunch spot anywhere.  These are the items that I have tried:  Avocado smash toast-  Excellent, egg poached to perfection Turkey Benny-  made with real turkey and homemade hollandaise sauce, very good Chicken and Waffles -   Chicken tender and fried to perfection Carnitas Omelette - I ordered with egg whites, pork was very good and had a nice kick Monkey bread -  comes out warm.  it was  good and addicting  Will continue to go back whenever i am in town......",

There isn't much that will get me to drive across town but after hearing all the rave reviews of CRAFTKitchen and seeing all the pictures of gorgeous food I had to give them a try for myself.  They were packed on the Saturday morning after Thanksgiving and my mom and I patiently waited for a seat while ogling the delicious looking pastries in the display case.  Finally seated it took me a minute to decide what I wanted to order. Everything sounded amazing and as I unabashedly stared at the food from neighboring tables the decision process became that much harder. I finally settled on the short rib hash, while my mom ordered the smoked salmon on a pretzel roll. I also ordered a pecan roll to share.   The pastry came out first and it was perfection. I recommend having it heated to maximize the ooey gooey factor. We devoured this in about eight seconds flat. Next, our entrees arrived and they we're everything my heart was hoping for and more. The short rib hash was evenly flavored and the crispiness of the potatoes complemented the subtly sweet flavors of the meat. I loved every bite of this dish. The smoked salmon was excellent as well. The pretzel bread was soft and pillowy and enhanced the flavors of the salmon and cream cheese well.   I can't rave about this place enough and I look forward to returning soon and often.",

    "text": "Beautiful restaurant, delicious food, and excellent service makes CRAFTkitchen a triple threat and THE Henderson hot spot for breakfast, brunch or lunch!  --Restaurant-- Farmhouse Chic! A cross between contemporary rustic, with a touch of industrial.   First the place is 2x the size of the former breakfast place that occupied this space. They knocked out a wall and voila!! Three dining room areas!! The main dining area has booths, tables and counter seating. There's a private dining room also (call ahead to reserve). When it's not windy and the temps are right, take advantage of sitting outdoors!  Love the wall dividers with potted plants made from wooden pallets on their outdoor patio. The dark wood dining tables are custom made with CRAFTkitchen etched on the corner are just gorgeous! They make the perfect backdrop for food pix too :D  --Food-- Health conscious, meat & potatoes kinda person, sweet tooth? CRAFTkitchen has got it covered. Fresh, organic, baked goods made from scratch, cooked to order.  Foodies be prepared!  Your culinary senses will go crazy for Chef Jaret's creative dishes. The quinoa cake on pureed potato, (Farmhouse Stack) is brilliant. Smoked Salmon on pretzel bun made in house is really good. Turkey Benny with the PERFECTLY poached egg, is a winner as well.  Love the garnish of garden fresh greens they use too. Everything is meticulously crafted by chef and his awesome crew.   -Baked breads A++ I didn't have to tell Mr. B. I brought home bread the other day. He smelled the fresh baked cranberry bread as soon as I walked in the door. The flavors, taste and textures of all their breads are all perfect like that.   -Breakfast/Brunch\\Lunch Everything on the menu is available all hours. Get the Quiche of the Day!! (QOTD). Creamy smooth, light texture. crustless too,(big plus for those who want Gluten Free). The quiches vary so check the chalkboard when you enter the restaurant or check their instagram ahead of time. Whatever they mix in, Gruyere cheese, spinach, bacon, potatoes, mushrooms, CRAFTkitchen crew nails this savory dish!   -Soups Dont miss ordering this either!!! Hearty and rich, perfect start for warming up in the morning. Hard to resist not ordering their soups either.  Butternut Squash, Asparagus, Pumpkin, I'll never get tired of.  The kids menu is kid tested and approved. The foodie-in-training toddler that comes along with me cleans her plate.   Lastly the PASTRIES & DESSERTS! Ohhh...my...make room for them too! The pecan sticky bun, brioche cinnamon roll, lemon tart, and that croissant bread pudding. So far everything in the dessert case is wicked good! Yeah and wicked for my waist. Good thing they open early (7am), gives you the rest of the day to work off the calories.   Been showing up here couple times a week for a month now and repeat orders have been consistent in execution and SO good!!  --The Scene-- Classy, casual, chill vibe. Family friendly, soccer moms, fitness freaks, instafoodiegramers, hipsters, grandmas and even the meat and potatoes crowd (ie Mr. B) would feel at home here. There's something for everyone.    Price ...For me, I have no problem paying average of under 15 or up to $25 for my meal, plus pastry..or pastries, tart etc. Know that quality ingredients are used.  I appreciate that.   Service...Excellent!. Dining in, there's table service. Their really sweet staff working the counter will seat you or are there to ring you up if you just want to buy baked goods from the dessert case.  The servers have always been great, whether it's early am or on a crazy busy day. Teresa and Rusty are pretty attentive, my orders come out in a timely manner.  Owner Chef/Tami (Chef Jaret's wife) is hands on the floor overseeing everything and greeting customers too.    It's nice that they dont rush everyone in and/or out. My guest pointed out there is no clock on the walls. Be prepared for a 20 minute wait in the foyer on crazy busy Sundays, no joke. But that is a given for popular spots anywhere.  Location....this spot was formerly occupied by Bread & Butter (miss you Chef Chris!) corner of Sunridge and Eastern. If you take Green Valley Pkwy up pass the Target, the street turns to Sunridge, turn RIGHT into the strip mall before you hit the light on Eastern. BAM you are there.  --SUMMARY-- CRAFTkitchen rocks! That is all!",

    "text": "The second time is even better.   While living in Southern California I took for granted all the great things that were within walking distance; grocery stores, parks, watering holes, and amazing brunch spots. Craft Kitchen looks and feels like it was plucked right out a San Diego or Santa Monica Beach community; very clean, modern look, and I can walk there!  I've come here twice now (brunch & lunch) and both meals were amazingly tasty and the service was on point. The first time here I ordered the Smashed Avocado Toast and enjoyed it on the \"craftily made\" outdoor patio. This light and filling lunch is comprised of Ciabatta, sunflower seed pesto, micro greens, and a poached egg. The perfect option for the eater looking to watch calories and is an avid avocado fan. Eggs, avocados, and crispy bread, what's not to love?    Visit number two: Short Rib Hash. My first thought is, this place is basically a coffee shop with a slightly refined menu, do they really have the balls to put out a Short Rib option? Yes, and they can back it up.   The Short Rib melted in my mouth, it was tender, flavorful with just the right amount of salt, I was very impressed that Craft Kitchen could pull this dish off. The poached egg broke perfectly when cut into and the smashed finger length potatoes had a perfectly crispy skin with a soft buttery inside.  I know Henderson is far from the walking communities of SoCal, but Craft Kitchen is a start to something worth traveling for.  P.S. - Get the Pecan topped sticky bun. Trust me.",

Our experience continued with Erika (Sp?) our waitress, who was excellent. Then breakfast started coming, fresh squeezed OJ, check, excellent coffee (brewed & espresso) check.   As our meal we had the Bananas Foster pancakes, the Chili Rellenos Burrito, the vegetarian omelette and the Pork Carnitas Omelette.   The Bananas Foster pancakes were some of the best pancakes we've ever had, fluffy and light and the fosters sauce was perfectly sweat and not too rich. We treated it as a \"starter\" for breakfast. Would definitely get these again.  The Chili Relleno Burrito was very good. The Chili was still slightly crunchy (not over cooked) the seasoning was fantastic as were the smashed fingerling potatoes and the Avocado sauce.   The Veggie Omelette was perfectly cooked, the mushrooms and the associated sauce would have been suitable as a side in a fine steakhouse.   The Pork Carnitas Omelette was a terrific blend of spice and tart with the green sauce and Cotija cheese and the pork itself was incredibly tender and perfectly seasoned. The only bad thing about the omelette was that I wish it were bigger because I wanted MORE.   This place was recommended to us by a famous Vegas lawyer by the name of Trent Richards, thank you!   Chef Jaret, thank you, we'll be back.",

We ordered a breakfast burrito, an apple pop tart, a pecan sticky bun and a chai latte.  Everything was delicious but my favorites were definitely the pastries. The sticky bun was lots of layers of buttery pastry dough with cinnamon and caramel. Easily cut with your fork, it melts in your mouth and was a perfect addition to our meal.   The apple pop tart was fun to order and to eat. The apple filling was tart but sweet and the crust was topped with a simple icing sugar.   We had not only our own server checking on us but others would stop by to refill a water or clear a plate.  I'll be back!",

The manager a young kid with a tie and suit was great and the Asian waiter with long hair was an top of things. Over the past 3-4 weeks or more the staff has changed and the young girl manager that is there now have a very negative and aggressive behavior towards people . If I or anyone that I bring complain about anything with a a fake smile she says she is working on it but doesn't have to social skills to address customers or has any experience what so ever how to treat a customer. We have met the owners wife a very nice sweet lady but I have to say being in the customer service business my self it's been a horrible experience since the management changed and the waiter left. It's very slow service and any complaints they don't want to deal with as to going so far am telling u if u don't like leave. I support all local businesses but I have to say if the owners don't change the management soon old local customers like me they will loose and that will affect them greatly.  I hope this is a constructive review and they take in consideration my words and change for the better .",

We were looking for a family brunch on this day and every place we went had over an hour wait. Somehow we ended up at Craft Kitchen who was no different. We saw a few familiar faces and decided to wait it out. There was a great vibe outside the restaurant so the 45 min wait didn't seem like much.   Our server was so nice and accommodating. She went out of her way to secure the last monkey bread for us and she was very patient with my mother in law's gluten free questions. I wish I remembered her name to give her a shoutout.   The food was amazing. A bit under seasoned, but still amazing. We ordered the chicken and waffles, the protein plate, the short rib hash and of course the monkey bread. Everyone on our table enjoyed their choices and there were absolutely no complaints. Even my kids ate everything they ordered.   The great food, the wonderful staff and fresh ambience won this restaurant 5 stars. Can't wait to visit again.",

Felt kinda silly after leaving with a $27 check when we could have made a breakfast for about $3 with organic ingredients(which we did after).  Mimi's Cafe has a delicious breakfast and good service.

For 5 stars you need to meet: great atmosphere, great staff, great music, great food, cleanliness, and the place must \"flow.\"   I'm in between a 3.5-4 stars.   When we first walked in, there was no one at what looked like a hostess table. It was unclear what to do, so I took it upon myself to write my name on the wait list.   There is no technical waiting area. There is a bar of sorts facing outside, which is where everyone waiting sat. But this took up seats where anyone who came in and wanted to sit here, wouldn't be able to.   It is a super cute place, very homey, and very inviting, but there wasn't any music and the tables were pretty close to each other, so any conversations you have will not be private.   The food portions are smaller than most places, so if you're a big eater, eat before coming or order two plates. The prices are higher, but matches the quality of the food.   One dislike, however, was that the special of the day was shrimp and grits. Being that I'm a huge lover of grits, I asked if I could order a side of the grits. I was quickly told \"no\" by our waitress. This was a turnoff. I would have preferred being told, \"I'm not sure, let me ask,\" instead of an immediate \"no.\" I'm actually surprised she didn't bring me a small sample.  I ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was moist and crispy. The waffle was good, but on the smaller size. The shaved jalapenos were a nice twist. I also ordered a side bacon and the bacon was bomb! Side note: if you like your bacon crispy, be sure to ask for it that way - it comes out soft.",

However, the recommendation quickly went out the window due to the poor service given from the beginning.  There were plenty of open tables and many waiting to be seated in the entrance. With most of the parties consisting of two people, it was apparent the staff would not seat two at a table meant for four.  When a two person table opened up, the hostess was so hurried to seat us, she nearly forgot to clear the table from the couple before.  The food was decent enough, nothing spectacular, and unfortunately, we did not try any pastries as our initial excitement was lost.",

He recommended my now favorite breakfast order which is the chorizo scramble skillet. I tried the croissant sammy today too which was \"flaky buttery deliciousness\" also we had a fruit plate today and all the melons and berries were perfectly ripe. I've been here and had their bottomless mimosas too which are pretty good. If you're in a drinking mood definitely try the blood orange mimosas!! I didn't care too much for the pomegranate mimosas. Also if you're going on a breakfast or lunch date the booth window seating is super cute. I'm also a fan of all the desert flower art in this place. Check it out! It's a great spot.",

    "text": "Talk about another great little gem in Henderson. CRAFTkitchen visited twice and both times had been spot on awesome. My first visit came with others yelpers first week they opened so got to see few things on the menu. I was torn between the turkey slider and the loaded roast beef. Once I saw pretzel bun was sold!! Talk about sandwich that delivered!!!! I have always preached that any sandwich for me always starts with the bread first and foremost. The fact they were serving it on pretzel bread that hardly see on any menu. Nice. The bread really was amazing. I could devour the bread by itself with some mustard. You add the nice portion of thin sliced roasted beef, horseradish cream (best part never overpowered the dish), and some tomato. It truly was the best roast beef sandwich ever had in life. Every component was the perfect fit, balance, and sandwich lovers dream. The salad that came with it was again perfect compliment nice refreshing with nice light vinaigrette and the crispy (no idea) added nice crunch texture round out the salad. I also ordered chocolate croissant. All the pastries made fresh daily in house. Not only do they look amazing, LOVE love the display case they have all fresh made pastries, and mix it up daily. It dam tasty. Other yelpers kind enough got try the truffle fries. It was ok. Truffle fries more like fad. I would not hesitate order them put it that way. Really all the dishes between four of us all looked good.   Second visit meet friend for recovery meal. I decided go for the Crustless Quiche of the day. I believe it was turkey and ham, What I do know is not big on Quiche but CRAFTkicthen got me hooked line and sinker. Times that Quiche all taste is scrambled eggs. Quiche here breaks all your stigmas, It has a nice creamy egg flavor and not just beaten eggs, The filling you get nice amount. Each bite perfect balance not just all eggs eating. The whole crustless makes for beautiful presentation and feels more filling. It comes with house salad that can never get enough of in life.  The decor HUGE fan. I like fact lot of wood from the tables, the front of the restaurant with patio area and potted fresh herbs on different levels.The open space feeling, they even have a sweet private dining room that have writing on the walls, and the display for the pastries are awesome. It very inviting feeling when you walk in.   The service was spot on five stars both times. Second visit I loved seeing the owner walking about checking up on customers and big smile positive vibes. The only bummer is wished they were open for dinner. I do like the fact that they serve both breakfast and lunch menu all day. So no matter time of the day can get your fix in. No doubt if am in the area plan on coming back and trying more more of the menu.",

The menu looked great hence the two stars. I ordered a water and a garden panini ( no meat, no cooking involved) and did not receive it for 30 minutes. Had to ask for it TO GO, eat it in my car before I went back to work. Wanted to enjoy this place, it's honestly right next to our home. Perhaps I wasn't their type of clientele since I was alone and in my work clothes. Horrible service. The panini was soggy. The decor was lovely however. Might give this place another try but not likely.",

    "text": "We had heard about Craft Kitchen through a food blogger on Instagram. Her photos and descriptions of the food led us to venture off strip for some late breakfast.   We were seated quickly and brought water. We had heard a lot about the \"churro\" waffles so we started off with that as an appetizer. Gary got the French toast and I ordered the Croque Madame. We also both got lattes from their espresso bar. They arrived quickly and were delicious.   The churro waffles started us off. For a person who loves cinnamon and caramel, these were IT!! They were so delicious and I was in love. They are VERY sweet, I can't stress that enough. If you don't have a big sweet tooth, skip these. Gary got his French toast and while he loved it, the sweetness from the waffles had put him off. I was very happy I went savory with the Croque Madame. The bechamel sauce was spot on. Not too thin and not too thjck. It softened the bread just right. It was a wonderful item. It comes with a side salad with some sort of dressing on it, but I could of done without it. It was just lettuce with whatever the dressing was. Not a lot of flavor.  We saw they had mini cronuts when we were paying, but we were too full to indulge on those.   My only True complaint was the service. While it all started off great, one we ordered our server never came back. Not once. Someone else filled our water (once, it sat empty for awhile. We were never checked on for how the food was, if we wanted anything else or boxes. We weren't even brought our bill. We were ready to leave and finally went to the front to pay. We saw others paying at their table. Our waiter was sitting in the back doing his side work. I get that it's on us that we went at 1:45 p.m. but the restaurant had a lot of people in it still. We were customers and should of still had regular service. If he was off, letting us know we were being passed off to someone else would of been courteous. The one man helping was great (he ran food, filled waters and cashed us out at the register). We loved the food so that's why I'm leaving it at four stars.   Atmosphere: 8/10 Food: 8/10 Service: 5/10",

Slightly confusing, but not the end of the world.   After some deliberation, I got the chicken and waffles. It is very good! The chicken skin is deliciously fried and the meat tender. All of it went together with the waffle and syrup. The pickled jalapenos were okay, and I'm not sure they added much to the dish.  The rest of the menu items look amazing, and I would absolutely return here to try more! They do seem to run out of favorites like the monkey bread early, so make sure to go in early if that's something you're interested in. You can also make reservations or join the wait on yelp before showing up! Highly recommend",

I went for a ladies brunch with some friends and we sat on the patio. Definitely a chill environment to chill for a few hours with some awesome coffee or mimosa. Bottomless mimosas are $16 a person. I ordered the veggie omelet with Ham and it was so pretty with all the vegetables. My friends ordered the Salmon Benedict and the fruit tart. They also have a large Vegan section of the menu.  Clean bathroom, but disappointing that there is only 1 women's stall when they offer bottomless mimosas.",

    "text": "CRAFTkitchen definitely served up a brunch to remember when I visited on a Sunday with a friend.   Most of the popular brunch places in Vegas and Henderson have quite the wait, so I wasn't surprised when the hostess let me know that I would be waiting for 30-45 minutes for a table. And because I had chosen to come around lunch time, there were some big parties that had occupied the tables. But no matter since I was waiting on my friend to arrive anyway. There are some seats inside, but when the wait gets super busy, you'll have to brave the heat and wait outside the restaurant.   The wait turned out to be quicker than I had expected, which was nice. Walking inside, I found the modern and simplistic style to be very appealing. Very light and modern colors and furnishing with open spaces and deep green plants on the wall that ended up giving me the vibe of a very fancy dining room area - just with a bunch of customers and tables and chairs. Behind the hostess stand is also a display case full of pastries, desserts (and the coffee area) that one can order to-go or eat in-store.   For the menu - they offer breakfast and lunch options, as well as special brunch options if you want to order something different. So much to choose from, but ultimately I went with a savory option and topped it with their popular CK monkey bread.   CK Monkey bread: This is a MUST order if you love cinnamon, bread, sweets, etc. Seriously - it's worth the $5.95. I would eat this every day if possible. I had actually wanted to order the sticky bun, which I saw was a popular treat. After I asked the worker about the bun, she said that she wasn't sure what the bun was, but recommended the monkey bread as something that was similar. I decided to trust her and I'm so glad I did because it was amazing. The entire concoction came out in a pretty big pan with brown sugar and cinnamon draped over the pullable pieces of bread. Eating it worm and having it melt in my mouth while tasting that sweet ooey-gooey cinnamon taste ... that was the best thing ever and pretty much made my stay at Vegas. It was so decadent that my friend and I had a hard time finishing, but we did because nobody likes a food waster!   Craft Benedict: $12.95 for two poached eggs with ham, tomatoes, and citrus hollandaise sauce on top of an English muffin. I liked that the hollandaise sauce came on the side, allowing me to pour as much as I desired. The sauce was creamy and not too acidic-y, just adding the right amount of flavor to the benedicts. And the eggs were cooked perfectly - cutting into them, the yolk oozed out and covered the rest of the benedict with that yolky goodness, creating that perfect bite/texture each time. The ham was not too salty and the tomato added a little kick to the dish that I really enjoyed.   Oatmeal Brulee: $7.00 - honestly not sure why my friend ended up ordering this dish, but he said he wanted something healthy and not too costly. This vegetarian dish came with oats caramelized with sugar along with some dried fruits and nuts on the side. The presentation looked amazing, but I don't think many people order this dish in general. I was able to try a little and I do think it was better than any oatmeal I've ever tasted (probably due to that brulee), but it wasn't too special of a dish.   Even though it was super busy in the restaurant, the workers were bustling around trying to help each guest - and were super courteous whilst doing so. The restaurant is only open for breakfast and lunch, but they seem to be doing very well in the Henderson area. Parking is hassle free as the plaza has a huge lot.   tl;dr - A very tasty spot for brunch if you don't mind the wait. Highly recommend the Monkey Bread and the benedict!",

The food is delicious. Understatement. I had the chilaquiles and added chorizo and avocado. So freaking good. Too much to finish! Hubby had the Biscuits and gravy. The Biscuits were insanely good. The gravy was the best I've EVER tasted. The sausage equally delicious. Usually a great breakfast place falls short on coffee. BEST. CUP. EVER. Hubby had the bottomless mimosa. Had a sip to taste. Will definitely try that next time. Shout out to Marlene our server! She was sweet, attentive, knew the menu and offered us a delicious crescent just because we raved about the food. We recently relocated to to Vegas for work. This place will be in our weekend rotation. *** Word of advice, check in on Yelp or you'll wait over an hour. We had to wait because we didnt know, but so worth the wait!!! Enjoy",

Here's what I got to try and how I'd rate it.   Short-Rib Hash 2/5 - It looks amazing, but totally lacked in flavor.   Carnitas Omelette 2/5 - Looked small for the price and was also lacking flavor.   Churro Waffles 5/5 - These were one of the specials of the day and probably the best waffles I've ever had. I'm guessing they used churro batter because they were the lightest, fluffiest waffles ever to exist. They were absolutely covered in a thick coating of cinnamon sugar and came with a caramel sauce. There are no words for how amazing this was. I can't believe I had to share. I would definitely go back specifically for these.   Chocolate Bread Pudding 3.5/5 - Its hard to find good Bread Pudding. And I certainly had better luck in the Midwest. I felt this one either needed more chocolate chips or it needed a sauce. It had great moisture and I loved the cold ice cream melting on top, but I would try something different next time.   Service 3/5 - It was just fine. The waitress didn't seem to care very much, she simply got the job done.   I will note that one friend ordered the fried chicken sandwich and another ordered the chorizo scramble - both looked great!",

Maybe it was an off-day, maybe it was because it's Saturday, or maybe it's because it's so close to Christmas...   The wait time was between 30 and 45 minutes, which isn't too bad when you see that the line never ends for this place. But as soon as we were seated we were given our glasses of water and our drink orders were taken.  Needed to have a mocha on a chilly day! . Our mochas came to us room temperature I should have known something was wrong when when my cup felt cold... I asked our waiter if he could please replace these drinks he brought it to I'm thinking the hostess or the manager's attention and instead of getting a new drink that was hot they basically just warmed up our drinks and return them to us.  The food was good, but when three out of four say not good enough to return to I can't say that it was great... I did order desert, and that desert Save the Day! They would return for the desert!!  The interior decoration are very well done. It sort of reminds me of Joanna Gaines and Magnolia.  LOL my HGTV people know...  I'd like to give this place another try but the other three said they'd only do a dessert here",

We ordered pelligrino for tres people but she only brought us two bottles anticipating that we might not drink it all and she was right and she took it off the bill at the end. Very thoughtful. She told us the specials everything sounded delicious it was really hard to choose. Husband ended up getting the veggie omelette as well as the churro waffles. At first glance the waffles look crazy sweet, but they were not! Even the 3 leches glaze was not overly sweet it was amazing! The omelette was really good too. I ordered the French toast which was good and my 5 year old ordered the kids waffles which he absolutely loved. They came with fresh berries and powdered sugar and a really good maple syrup on the side. Service was great, food was great, and the atmosphere was very clean and inviting. We will definitely be back for breakfast and will have to try it out for lunch as well.",

Craft is easily one of the best breakfast places I've ever been to, sadly I just had to take off a few stars for the wait on being seated and for the wait on food.  We went on a Sunday during peak time which was our bad. The place is small and unfortunately, you can't make reservations for this location. We were quoted around 45 minutes and were seated 15 minutes past then, not a big deal, we knew the food would make up for it. They have a huge menu and everything looks delicious.We tried ordering starters, but all 4 options were 86d. We decided on the creme brulee french toast to share. It was the best! The filling and the bruleed topping exceeded all expectations,I highly reccomend it! The entrees took a looooong time to get to us.The table that sat after us even got their food before us. Looking around, you can tell they are understaffed. The servers are also acting as baristas, hosts, and bussers. But even so, our server was super friendly and helpful. When our  entrees finally arrived, the soup was cold and needed to be sent back, and my dish was seriously lacking salt. But those small things aside, the short rib hash and the crab benedict were amazing!  I'll be sure to try this place again when it isnt so crazy busy.",

My husband had garlic cerano wings and a combo plate with short ribs and sausage served with rice topped with an egg, it was delicious! I had a mojito served in a freshly opened coconut and it was very strong for its size! They also give your the coconut water on the side. The staff was attentive and informative. Would definitely recommend this place!",

First off, this place is only open breakfast and lunch hours, so don't try to go later in the day.   We sat outside because it was so nice out. They have a few tables outside, but it is in a strip mall so it's not like a private outdoor area or anything special... it's right by the parting lot. Anyway, so we ordered food and I got the chicken & waffles. Holy Moly!! SO TASTY. Everyone was really happy with their food, but the one thing I'd caution is the portions are a little small for the price range. It's quality food and it's great food, but be aware that portions aren't huge. I don't mind, cause ya know... portion control is good. But I know some people are bothered by such things.   Our server was really friendly and attentive and when we went inside to pick out desserts from the bakery case, the staff behind the counter was also really friendly. Overall great experience! Would recommend if you're in the area!",

We ordered the breakfast sammy and the protein fix. The sammy was okay, but nothing I couldn't get at a fast food place for way less than the $10.95 Craft charges. It also came with a  side salad which completely baffles me. Who wants a salad at 9 in the morning??   The turkey sausage on the protein fix was dry as a bone, pretty much inedible. When we asked the server for salsa to moisten it up she said \"Sure but it will be 75 cents\". Hmmm, you want me to pay 75 cents more to fix your super dry sausage?   Not sure what happened to this place but it was not the least bit enjoyable. Not sure I will return.",

My gf didn't even get Potatos or a small salad on the side of her plate.  It was literally 13$ for something I could have made at home.  She got the turkey Benedict which was absolutely disgusting.  The citrus sauce was a horrible choice.  She only ate 2 bites and through it away.  I got the short rib and like I said early it's small portions so you spend $15 on a meal and your still hungry after.  Waste of money.

After about 20 minutes, 4 parties that came in after us were then called & seated. The staff did not notice until a couple that came in noticed, and said that we were before them when they were called up. Staff did not acknowledge the situation.

    "text": "We love trying new places, looked at the reviews and they looked promising so we thought we'd give this place a shot. We made a mistake. From the fake herbs outside to the uncomfortable ikea furniture gallery seating inside, we weren't impressed. First the food. Everything is ala carte and everything we tried lacked any seasoning whatsoever. We ordered 4 different plates. Carnitas omelette. Protein breakfast. Grits and eggs and red velvet pancakes.  The carnitas were the most blan carnitas we've ever tried. The grits were not seasoned, they were lumpy and undercooked, the egg whites were cooked decent but still no salt and the turkey sausage patty was tasteless. We also ordered a side of bacon. Must be a low sodium bacon and it was super thin. Nothing and I mean nothing had salt in it. One bright side? Perfectly ripe cherry tomatoes.   Service. I ordered a side of bacon with my breakfast. Even after reminding the waiter on 3 separate occasions it didn't come out until I was nearly finished eating my breakfast. I asked for hot sauce, they brought out a teaspoon sized dollop of this tasteless green mud. I told the girl I asked for hot sauce(tapatio, cholula, etc). The girl said that's what they have. I ordered a side of toast. They have two types of bread and yes the other one is gluten free(yeah, it's that kinda place lol). They brought out two dried out pieces of bread that were harder than a week old crouton, no exaggeration. No butter. No jellies. I asked for butter. They brought out a small dollop that was frozen. Not refrigerated..frozen! I asked for it to be warmed. I didn't see it again for at least 15 minutes after I asked two additional people for it. It came back cold. Not once did they offer a refill on our coffees or water. They were even stingy on the \"bottomless minosas\" that come in a 4 oz glass. Yeah, service was poor. When all was said and done it was $115 for 4 people. They actually charged us for the condiments!  Poor service, tasteless food, fake everything and outrageous prices. That's what you'll get here.   Well at least we can say we tried it. Lol. Ya win some you lose some.",

My wife loves the crustless quiche, which is constantly changes ingredients, so you never get the same thing twice. My personal favorite is the breakfast burrito which is a man sized portion of eggs, chorizo, green chiles, and cheese... Amazing! The prices are reasonable, and the atmosphere is great.  We will also bring our dog and sit out on patio. Can't go wrong!",

So my husband and I happened to get off at the same time and didn't feel like cooking, so I whipped out Yelp and searched the area. Located two seconds from work, Craft Kitchen. First impression loved the look of the place and drooled at the pastry case. The two woman that were working were very knowledgable and professional. The pastries are made fresh daily and you can taste it. We both went right for the Short Rib Hash. I had a Mocha Coffee that was perfectly done, usually I have to add sugar but it was perfect. The Hash came out and was delicious! Afterwards I had already eyes the Berry Crostata and my husband the Pecan Sticky Bun. Mine was the perfect end to a great breakfast. His Pecan bun was yummy, but it's so sickly sweet I think it's better to drink with coffee then just straight on its own. My only complaint is the chairs! So uncomfortable!  Next time we go we will request one of the bench seats. Otherwise this was a complete gem! We will be back.",

We individually ordered and got to see a variety of food. I had the \"Chicken and What\" (chicken and waffles) and enjoyed the jalapeno syrup.

My hubby had the chicken and waffles. He shared and it was also amazing. My older son had the sliders and the younger had pumpkin waffles (this was a \"special \") and they also were very tasty. We also tried the truffle fries and sweet potato fries and enjoyed them both. The coffee was delicious. My only complaint was the service left a little to be desired. It took a while for the server to even come over to take our drink order. We asked for water with our coffees and didn't receive them until the food runner brought our entrees. The server just seemed like he was a little slammed and didn't check back on us, fill our waters or ask if we wanted more coffee. The food runner and busser really picked up the slack for the server. Without them I wouldn't have been as happy with our experience. I'm just going to chalk the service up to the place being new and him still learning the ropes. I will most definitely be back to try some of the amazing looking baked goodies in the case.",

    "text": "We really wanted to love this place. Our favorite place (Layers) recently closed and we hoped this would become the go to spot now. Came twice on a weekend since they opened. While I understand it takes time to work out all the details in a new place, something needs to be done about the service. When you walk in there's a sign stating to go to the right counter to be seated. It's hard to see it right away and most people just wait at the door further blocking the sign. The staff doesn't really do anything about it and you need to catch someone to get a table. No fun when you waiting with kids. When finally seated both times took a while for someone to come by. On a second visit once we finally ordered, few minutes later another waiter came by to say he will be our server and what would we like. We said we just ordered. Again took time for drinks and only water came. Server forgot our coffee until we flagged her down. It was nicely comped later as apology for the wait. The waitress just seemed not to care at all. She made some weird comments when I was ordering my son's breakfast along the line \"you sure that's what you want for him\", not even half way through our meal asked if we are ready for our check, and asked two more times, until we finally said yes. Another server brought our food including small bowl of fruit. I asked if that's part of the kids meal and he said \"yeah\". During the first visit, we did get fruit with the kids chicken meal, so I thought that was the case again. Turned out I was charged for it and the waitress just said \"which guy told you that\". It doesn't matter, she took my order and I did not ask for it in a first place. Also, she never gave us itemized bill until my husband paid and it just seemed too much. Once I asked, she printed a copy which showed the charge for the fruit. While the food is good with quality ingredients and nice presentation (hence the 2 stars), the overall experience was not pleasant either time, and we won't be back.",

Although the Salmon was pretty mouth watering. The atmosphere is pretty good and it has a good visual aesthetic that works well for brunch and instagram.   Overall I have no problem coming here for brunch. The service is a little bit slow, but that's the downside of brunch sometimes. It's passable, but not too high on my list.

Today o went with a friend for Mother's Day and the food did not disappoint however the menu was a set price with the option of additional charge for a bottomless mimosa or Bloody Mary.  The quality of the champagne was honestly probably the worst I have had!  Usually they use Wycliff and this had a horrible after taste and a screw top!  I hope this is not going to be a regular choice because it was very disappointing.  The service was great after they were not going to seat us because it was a reservations only day.  Clearly there were several tables available and happy they were able to accommodate us!",

I ordered the smoked salmon and my best friend ordered the short rib hash, and bottomless mimosas (classic and pomegranate). Everything was great! The smoked salmon was on top their house made pretzel buns (2 in total); portion and flavor was great. It wasn't a hearty meal (which is what I was going for). The short rib hash, on the other hand, WAS hearty, but oh so delicious. I actually wished I ordered that instead lol. All in all, great place. Definitely coming back for more.",

After a couple visits it's safe to say this is one of the best (if not THE best) breakfast/brunch/lunch spots in town. The short rib hash ($15.95 + $1.75 for a poached egg) was as amazing as it looks with plenty of savory, tender beef. The potatoes are what really elevate this dish. They're smashed on the griddle then fried, giving them their crispy texture.  The apple tart ($5.25) is a thing of beauty. The thin slices of apple have the perfect balance of sweet and tart and the ginger crust is the perfect compliment. Their chocolate chip cookie ($2.25) and chocolate brownie ($2.75) are textbook perfect. The only flaw was a dry, dense almond croissant ($3.25).  It's hard to believe this is the same space that was occupied by Bread and Butter a few years back, but Craft Kitchen has proven to be a worthy successor.",

Would hate to see the noise level on a busy day.  The restaurant was freezing cold.  The iced tea was amazing.  That alone would bring me back again!  I had the chopped Caesar Salad. The presentation was beautiful  There was a toasted Parmesan crisp garnish that was amazing.  The salad was good, but when they were preparing it, they were a little heavy handed on the anchovies so the dressing was a little too fishy for my tastes.  My friend has he house burger and it was HUGE.  She said it was delicious.  We each ordered a side of fries.  I had the Garlic Parmesan and I loved them, her sweet potato fries were delicious too.  Normally I would have given this restaurant three stars, however, since the menu had so many choices and that delicious iced tea, I would be wiling to give them another chance.",

I asked for the salmon without the two eggs and I could substitute sweet potato fries. Seems fair. No, he was going to charge me for the side even though I was getting half a meal.  I tried to explain my diet but he said he doesn't know about Paleo and wanted to know if I was ordering or not. That was enough to make our party leave that minute.  This restaurant comes up with every search for \"Paleo restaurant\". Paleo eating for health is a fluid concept that allows for variation because many of us are trying to recover from illness caused by the standard American diet. I cannot have wheat, nightshades ( white potatoes, eggplant) or eggs. I didn't expect the server to know about my individual needs. I did expect him to be educated and trained enough to help me to choose from the fresh food they so proudly promote, so that I CAN maintain my health. This was embarrassing and time wasting and I will not return.",

I get the whole \"healthy eating\" angle, but let me enjoy my Splenda.   Ordered the pork carnitas omelet. Very bland. Pork tasted watered down. Green sauce just had no flavor. I felt like I needed to pour some hot sauce on it, but after being denied Splenda, I was afraid to ask.   I may try again, but my first go here was underwhelming.",

The owner's wife and kids have nut allergy, so he cares so much about people with food allergy. How nice!! I couldn't tell from outside but this place was very spacious and bright inside.    I was welcomed by this young guy that was very nice. He took me to the little cute booth to sit. Cozy!! Loved their succulent arts on the wall. Each table had a little succulent pots. Cute!! The waitress, Teresa was also very nice and accommodating. I told her I'm trying to eat as healthy as possible. She recommended me a bunch of items on the menu. (Loved they have a bunch of healthy items to choose from.) I decided to go with \"Farmers Market Stack\".  It was absolutely delicious. The quinoa cake was crisp outside and soft inside. The tomato sauce was flavorful and the veggies were fresh. The portion size was small compared to other breakfast places. I appreciate the small portion size because I usually overeat otherwise.  The manager, Devin was making sure everybody in the restaurant was happy and satisfied. He was very nice and cheerful. I like to see people like that early in the morning to perk me up.  My overall experience here was absolutely amazing. One of the best healthy breakfast places in Henderson!!",

The chicken was a bit over salted , but the jalapeno syrup was interesting.  I enjoyed the pop tarts. My first home made one and it was worth it. Bread pudding is a must.

    "text": "Meh. Interesting food, small portions, mediocre service, overpriced  Tried Craft Kitchen today for the first time.  We ordered the chicken and what and also the turkey Benedict. The chicken was tasty,  and the jalapeno on the waffles was a nice touch, but the portions were rather small. Additionally, it was nothing novel or unique compared to the other Chicken and Waffles that I've had in Las Vegas (except being a smaller portion).  Add in the fact that they do not provide you with any of the typical side dishes that you expect with breakfast fare, the price point is undesirable.  The turkey Benedict was interesting. Clearly, the turkey is dry and insipid. While everything is cooked appropriately, and the hollandaise had an interesting Touch of Orange, I wouldn't go back for it again.   The sausage patty tasted like stuffing you would have at Thanksgiving. While I liked it, it wasn't worth $4.  Finally, the service is pretty terrible. The waitress was inattentive and did not come back to check on the table. She did not come back to do refills on our drinks. I ordered it hot tea, and there was barely enough hot water for half a cup. I consistently had to ask for more hot water.  I am glad I had a chance to try this restaurant, but I will simply just go to Egg Works across the street from now on.",

I saw that there were 3 open tables inside (2-4 tops and a 6 top). I totally understand not wanting to sit me at a bigger table, however, after 10 minutes, another 4 top opened outside.  The girl then came over and told me it would be 'another 5-10 minutes\".  I believe, if there's nobody else there, after a few minutes, sit the single in the 4 top.  Don't upset the guy waiting by making him wait an additional 10 minutes in the hopes that more people would come in and take the bigger tables.  I grabbed a coffee to go (coffee is outstanding).   This is my opinion, but I appreciate the feedback.",

Wait staff knows their menu and they are very attentive.tried their smoke salmon on a pretzel bagel and was absolutely phenomenal. Also something as simple as scrambled eggs had to be the most perfectly prepared eggs I can remember.  Their monkey bread served  during weekend brunch is just decadent.",

We initially chose inside but moved outside a bit later ( seating under the vent was a bit chilly) and from then on got absolutely zero service. Katie took orders from other people seating outside but absolutely ignored us for 30 some minutes we spent eating. At one point my husband had to go inside to get us some drinks. Katie showed up with two drinks, inquired who helped us inside and quickly had the check brought out. In spite of the fact we were not ready to leave we did, feeling totally unwelcome to stay. In spite of delicious food the rudeness of the server who ignored us even after another team member directly told her that we needed service spoiled our experience. Sad:(",

Really could have been served with decent sized juicy shrimps for the price. Others ordered the Crab Salad - nothing really special.  We all found the chairs very uncomfortable especially since we got together to gab a bit. It's definitely not a place to go if you want a leisurely lunch and enjoy your friends company. Service wasn't that great either. Not sure I would go back.   Disappointed in Anthem",

I love the layout of the restaurant. It's simple but yet cozy with a super friendly staff. We were instantly greeted and seated as soon as we walked in and felt welcomed.  The server was very nice and knowledgable of their menu. I wanted something simple so I had ordered the CK special. It was just the perfect amount of food because I normally don't like to stuff myself. The turkey sausage was amazing hence I normally don't eat sausage.  I must say the Carmel Latte was amazing as well.  I wanted to order a second cup of java but yet I get heart burn so I had to limit myself. The Sammy croissant was yet another hit! It was so delicious and yummy.  We had also ordered the garlic fries and cake pops for dessert and yet no disappointment. I totally recommend this place and will be back to try the other selections on the menu. Happy eating.",

I can't tell you how long I have waited for this town to finally have some local places to eat that aren't a chain and actually offer delicious, healthier leaning, \"foodie\" type food. The combinations that Jaret comes up with for each dish makes your taste buds explode and leaves you with a smile on your face.   I've taken my mom, my family, my friends and have dined alone and every time everyone has left with nothing but great things to say about CRAFTkitchen. They also cater to people with dietary restrictions which is a bonus.   I look forward to many more dining experiences here and can't wait to see how the menu changes with the seasons. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a new take on breakfast and lunch.",

Came in here yesterday with two others, and after we were seated my one friend and I ordered one single mimosa. They do offer bottomless mimosas, but we just ordered one. After we drank about 3/4s, our waitress came by and refilled our drinks. Our initial reaction was oh, cool more mimosa! But then we realized maybe she thought we ordered unlimited, which we didn't. So we decided not to drink them. Totally fine. Here comes the problem... I approached the waitress about our incorrect bill, and her response was, \"well you didn't say anything when I filled them up.\" Umm excuse you! The waitress' mistake now became our mistake. No thanks. My response was, \"what was I supposed to do flag you down while you're running around?\" Queen of sass, I know. But this interaction was rude and completely inappropriate. This waitress clearly needs to work on her customer service skills. If we come back, I'd be sure not to dine with her!",

The grits were in the same boat as the turkey sausage, just horrible and made by someone who has no idea how to make grits. Overall the food lacked flavor and technique. If you want a great breakfast go to Mesa Grill at Caesars Palace and let Bobby show you how grits are made. This is a great example of how easy people are fooled with fancy decor and cool plate presentations. Open your eyes people and let the food be the deciding factor.

They gear toward the healthy side, which can sometimes leave the taste in the kitchen...not this place!!  Everything was fresh and healthy but also flavorful and filling!

The service was great, our waiter was very prompt and polite. He also seemed to have great timing. As I had friends visiting from out of town so we were very busy conversing most of the time. He always came around at the perfect time for ordering as well as refills and extras.  I ordered the carnitas omelette and it was DELICIOUS! The pork was tender and flavorful and mixed with the green salsa and cheese it was perfect. The portion was great as well... it wasn't to much food, I was able to eat most of it and share with my friends. I left feeling full, but not stuffed and that made me very happy. I also tried a bit of my friends meals: the apple cobbler pancakes and the breakfast burrito. First off all of the dishes were perfect portions and were presented beautifully. They cut the breakfast burrito in half making it easy to take the other half home. It was still delicious reheated later that day. I really liked the idea of putting a chili relleno in the burrito. It was different then your typical \"breakfast burrito\". The  salsa verde (served w burrito) was the same that was served on my omelette and it was really delicious and simple.  Now the apple cobbler pancakes were FANTASTIC! I will be back to try those again! The pancakes held up great to the warm flavorful syrupy apple cobbler and had a bit of texture with the crunchy topping.  For drinks we ordered michaladas and pomegranate mimosas. Both were delicious and served in beautiful glassware. (Making for great social media pics)  I can't wait to go back to CRAFTkitchen and try more of what they offer on the menu. The pastries in the pastry case looked delicious ( wanted to try them but was pleasantly full after our meal) I would love to try the coffee as well. They have so much to offer, and makes me eager to be back for more.",

They have a walled off room with windows for events and the staff was so nice and helpful! They're cappuccino was soooo good! It may be the best one I've ever had! It was so foamy, creamy, and smooth. We got their acai bowl with fresh banana, blueberries and strawberries, toasted coconut, and house-made granola. I definitely recommend! We also got the CK special with turkey sausage. The only downside was that they are a little bit on the expensive side for the portions you receive. Still the food was very good! I will definitely be back!",

Atleast until the new Costco get built~     Located on a strip mall near the corner of Eastern & Sunridge Heights behind Osaka this is the place for breakkie & lunch. Open daily 7am -3pm all menu items available anytime!!!    We had breakfast, my selection toasted ciabatta slices with smashed avocado seasoned with salt/pepper and a little olive oil, a scrambled egg and finally topped with toasted pumpkin seeds, Atleast I think they were pumpkin seeds.....just FAB!!!! They do offer more traditional items with a little twist.     Coffee is not served from a pot or carafe either.....each cup individually brewed so an excellent cup of Joe  from a roaster in Boulder. Gr8 that the chef/owner Jerrod the former pastry & food service Mgr from Red Rock Casino is using local sources.      Jerrod told us they will be open a couple hours on Thanksgiving for pie & bread order pick ups. Also selling slider buns and the pastries are beautiful to look at and the glazed cinnamon roll I indulged in was infrekkin credable!    Head on into CRAFTkitchen ez parking, pleasant & welcoming staff and truly great food",

I try to order something new each time I go. So far, my favorites have been the short rib hash and avocado toasts. Their mochas and cappuccinos are delicious as well! The thing I love the most about the food is that it tastes super fresh and not overly seasoned or cooked in oil. I leave feeling satisfied and guilt free. They're all you can drink mimosas on the weekends is also worth trying! Just expect a fairly long wait during brunch. But busy means the food must be good right? :)",

Today we got there and it took about 4 minutes to be greeted, all while watching about 4 people on the other side of the counter. We had our name taken and were told it would be about 20-25 minutes, while there were four or five open tables. I get it's a busy and popular place, but it just seemed a bit odd to keep people waiting. It seemed like the hostess was trying to have her own system of setting tables. Finally someone came over and started seating everyone who was waiting. I do think I will return, but hoping the service does get better.",

No specials were read to me but I heard them being read to another table as I got my CK breakfast burrito. The first bite of my burrito was a giant piece of inedible, hard chorizo and I picked every single piece of chorizo out after that because I didn't want that awful bite again. The smashed potatoes were the best thing about the burrito but there was only a couple pieces in there spread out unevenly. Last time I tried to come here the pulled turkey Benedict came out completely cold and the time before that the homemade turkey sausage was hard and inedible as well. Not impressed at all by any of the meats at this place. Not sure what the hype is about Craft Kitchen because I really don't get it.",

However, both times we've been puzzled by the order in which tables are seated. Many tables sat vacated, un-bussed for several minutes. With a long wait list, I would assume the intention would be to seat as quickly as possible. We waited approximately 25 minutes for our table, which is reasonable for Sunday brunch. The concern I have, is the 2 top that was open when we arrived, remained open for 25 minutes until we were seated at it. The staff is all very friendly, but based on observation it does not appear they have defined rolls on who should bus, seat, stations etc. I would like to continue coming here because the food is great, but the unnecessary wait times are frustrating and take away from the experience.",

I ordered the roast beef sandwich and it came out the way I asked, cut in 3 so I can share. The sandwich is shaped like a slider and I was expecting a hoagie. The meat was tender and flavorful. The rest of the parties shrimp and grits and portabello mushroom sliders were tasty as well. Food items are made differently here but everything is cooked well. No complaints. Service was snappy even though we sat outside. I joked that he can bring me a knife if the kitchen forgot to slice my sandwich and he didn't forget. The mimosas were tasty with fresh squeezed pomegranate juice.",

I had heard so many good things + the basic instagram b*tch in me was dying for the aesthetic pictures!   okay let's get started: my boyfriend and I went in on Thursday afternoon at 12. It looked pretty busy but we got seated instantly so I didn't think service would be a problem. Our server brought us some water and took our order at around 12:05 (no problem). We ordered a simple sandwich and an omelet. At the same time we ordered our food a couple next to us had just ordered as well...   next -- did not see our server for about another TWENTY MINUTES. I thought ok their busy I understand. We still kept waiting for our food unable to order anything else from our server as she hadn't even looked at us since she took the order. 12:34 comes along ..... still no food. However the table in front of us who also had an omelet had received their food, and asked for the check all while we were waiting for our food. At this point I was pretty irate. But just as I was about to say something at 12:40 our food arrived. THIRTY FIVE MINUTES AFTER ORDERING.   Tried to stay optimistic and was thinking the food was going to be amazing. 1st problem- Even after I had asked for my omelet to be well done it was not. I thought whatever it took this long I'm not going to say anything. 2nd problem - the omelet was disgusting. I don't know ho you can ever mess up an omelet but I was so disgusted that I took 2 bites out of my $15 omelet (I added avocado) and left it there.  Now I've only seen my server twice during these 45 minutes and both times were within the first 5 minutes -- she comes back for the third time does not say anything about the food and instead gives us a look like \"is it ok\" but doesn't say anything!!!!!! No apology for the food or if she could get us anything else :-) .... at this point I'm livid.   I don't know what took longer, trying to even get her attention or our food.   Go here if you want to pay for overpriced bland food and wait 30+ minutes for it. Literally a waste.",

They have a single brewing system that pours a smooth frothy looking cup.   We've been here 3 times and haven't been dissatisfied. My husband had the chicken and waffles and I the croissant Sammy. Both very good. We did the bottomless mimosas the next time and both had delicious breakfasts. The 3rd time I was talked into getting the special they had of a roast beef sandwich which he described as a moundful. I have to say I was a little disappointed this time. Wasn't that much meat at all actually and it was just ok. But we will still come back.",

My personal favorite is the Short Rib Hash is was wonderful, just be careful everyone wanted to taste it so there wasn't much left. The have a great private dinning room that is perfect for a small shower or birthday luncheon.  Make a reservation they are busy and don't forget to take some bakery items home they are bAked right there",

I came in with my two girlfriends and my kids on a Sunday and waited 30 minutes to be sat, but it was so worth the wait. We all ordered something different and all loved what we got. I couldn't find their kids menu online or here so I'm going to post it on here when I'm done writing this. Anyway the food is DELICIOUS! Sooooo yummy! Taking my hubby in next week to check it out again . Love this new spot down the street from my house. Oh! And and Ashley is amazing! She is so sweet, helpful, friendly and kind. She definitely represents the company well! The hostess Mo was fantastic too! Super friendly and sweet as well. I'm big on customer service when I go out and they got a 10/10 on my list! Hahah! Can't wait to come back and eat here soon!",

You can't physically, mentally, or emotionally go wrong with any choices; if you do come in with some hang-ups, they have a great Bottomless Mimosa with quite a kick.  Family friendly. They do have a changing station in the ladies room that I'm aware of.   Staff are incredibly professional and friendly, even around the the less than awesome patrons that find themselves here.   Their coffee is automated, inexpensive and made to order and with precision.   There was a waiting line when we got here, but it's gotta be good if they draw a crowd, they really did not disappoint.",

Definitely get that. They also have this salsa who they say is spicy but it's really do able. Today I decided to get their special, pork belly breakfast tacos! It comes with 3 and surprisingly, there wasn't much fat at all on the pork belly! Definitely put some salsa on that. I love my breakfast with a kick in it so I tend to choose ones that go well with pico de Gallo or salsa. I couldn't leave without getting fries so I got the truffle fries! If you like skinny crunchy fries, you'll love the fries here. Since I can never make up my mind, I also went for the carnitas eggs Benedict. It wasn't my favorite dish I've had from here, BUT let's talk about that poached egg doe!! Perrrrrfectly ooey gooey yolk BURSTING out when you cut into it. When you lightly poke at it, it wiggles.... Now that's perfection. For first timers I definitely recommend the carnitas omelet and fries!",

I had an arugula pesto salad with free range chicken and the chicken wasn't moist. If you pay free range prices, then the meat should be cooked right , and if you are going to charge Cheesecake Factory salad prices, you should give the same portion size. My daughter had a kids cheeseburger, it was a bite sized burger and completely over cooked. The portion size is really small. I paid $2.75 for an iced tea, a bit over priced for a tea. The best part and the only part we will be back for are their deserts. They were pretty good and decent priced compared to local competitors.",

If you are in Henderson and want an amazing brunch spot, this place is a MUST!!!",

    "text": "Where do I start? The hosting staff didn't turn over tables quickly during Sunday brunch... With a growing line of hungry patrons and several clean, empty tables, they probably need to beef up their hosting staff. The food is okay, but not amazing, and kind of inconsistent. I couldn't help but notice I got less short rib hash than everyone else nearby who ordered it. The short rib was tender but low on seasoning. The bread pudding we ordered was too eggy, so it tasted like a mix of bread pudding and scrambled eggs. Husband agreed on how weird the texture came off. (Also, even though I ordered it by its specific name in the display case--chocolate croissant bread pudding--our server was confused, said they didn't have it, left, returned saying they were out of chocolate croissants, and then finally agreed it was available by repeating the name back again with an \"ohhhh\".) Our garlic parmesan fries were one-note, and that one note was rosemary. Don't toss that in, unless you're planning on accurately naming them \"rosemary fries,\" in which case, knock yourself out. There were too many artistic decisions that were \"form over function\" and/or nonsensical: fries spilling (literally) out of small, round bowls; sandwich on a narrow tray with greens next to it, perhaps to occupy all the empty space? But then the greens were spilling over the sides, and they were not dressed! I hope that was an accident. We were confused by the experience, and probably won't be back.",

Presentation of the good was great, pretty enough to post a picture on instagram! The ingredients were very fresh. Although the coffee/ latte was on the colder side. Overall taste was good, I've had better benedicts before but I also had much worse. I would definitely recommend this to friends, I would for sure come back and check out something else on the menu.",

The servers are eaither stretched way too thin or they are really understaffed because service is pretty slow always. The menu is also not too diverse and options seem pretty limited. The menu items are a bit overpriced for their simplicity as well. The roast beef sandwich was really dry on a hard stale pretzel bun, and there was so much horseradish on it that my eyes watered and I almost couldn't stand it. The  turkey sausage was pretty bad also, it tasted like ground turkey with a ton of rosemary and overcooked and dry. The omelettes are dry and portions are tiny. People seem to really love this place however, and I really wish them success, but I just can't bring myself to go back after so many disappointments.",

The service was soooo slow. There were two tables behind us that were seated after us and were able to order before us. Not to mention they got their food at least 20 minutes before we did. I was not happy about that. Then, we waited about forty minutes to get our food.  They couldn't even give us our appetizer first. I mean forty minutes come on. Fries is the easier thing you can prepare in the kitchen. The waitress was nice enough to bring us one banana chocolate bread (there was four of us) but she didn't even follow up with us on our order till we complained to her about the wait. She barely even had time to come by to refill my water.   I ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffles were decent but the chicken was not crispy but rather soggy. Very disappointed. I tried my friends short rib hash which was pretty flavorful.   In short, a highly disappointing brunch experience. I will give their dinner another try since my friend strongly recommended it.",

    "text": "IG has been blowing up with great shots of CRAFTKitchen's new Friday-exclusive \"happy hour\" menu. The curated list of savory, sharable dishes warranted a group visit because everything sounded so good. Eight of us ordered and shared the majority of the menu, including all four dessert options plus a stop by the pastry case on our way out the door. Go big or go home, right?  HITS: You can't miss the cheese plate. Great price, great selection, the bleu with walnuts was my favorite cheese but they were all thoughtfully selected and played nicely against each other. The smoked wings have a great presentation and are full of flavor. Pretzels and beer cheese are amazing, and the order is so huge you'll have to share it even if you don't want to. I hogged the Manila Clams for myself, with pork and a great white wine broth I wanted to drink like soup! The Grilled Artichoke dish was small but tender and well-executed with a great roasted garlic aioli that it didn't need but was wonderful nonetheless.  IF YOU HAVE ROOM: Almost everything we had was stellar but if you can't order everything, prioritize what's above. Otherwise, order the Bone Marrow, because duh, it's bone marrow. Fun presentation. CK Meatballs were moist with a robust sauce and ample ricotta. The Chopped Crunchy Salad has an amazing green goddess dressing that made it stand out from the Beet Salad and Heirloom Tomato Salad of the \"healthy\" / vegetarian options. The tempura shrimp was nice and light, bed of shredded lettuce underneath makes this passable as a salad for solo-diners. The Fried Polenta Sticks had great texture but I thought I'd like them more than I actually did. Perhaps by that point I was already overwhelmed by everything else I'd tried.  DESSERTS: Yes, this warrants a separate category. There's an affogato and a nice creme brulee available, but you really want to go for the Mason Jar Magic Bar and/or the Sticky Toffee Cake (in that order). The jar is layered with tons of textures and flavors, as if you're straight-up raiding the chocolate aisle or your mom's baking cabinet. It works! The cake in the STC was nice but I was missing the robust sticky toffee elements that originally made me gravitate toward this option.  Chef Jaret and the staff at CK are doing some great things here in Henderson! Looking forward to more visits to try the couple of things I missed (hello, CK burger!) and maybe try one of their pairing meals for a date night.",

I ordered CrabCake Benedict which was really good, with a nice twist on a traditional hollandaise sauce, however I asked for my eggs to be poached medium so I wouldn't have yolk all over the plate. When I broke into the egg you could still see the \"gel\" of the raw egg white, and egg yolk was everywhere (I prefer a \"slow leak\" not extremely runny yolks but to each his own). The egg wasn't enough to ruin the entire dish. My BFF ordered chicken and waffles and the server was kind enough to swap the regular waffle for the churro waffles, which was awesome! The chicken was juicy and flavorful and the churro waffles were sweet and decadent. We arrived around an hour before closing during the week so it wasn't busy and the service was good. Our food came out quickly. I would definitely give this place another shot and try some of their coffee, pastries, and other items on the menu.",

    "text": "CRAFTkitchen is a solid breakfast and lunch Henderson spot, and they've recently debuted a new \"happy hour\" on Fridays from 4-9pm, featuring an array of new recipes and a nice selection of beers and wines.  I first stopped by solo, and I opted for the CK House Burger ($14) because it's the most loner-specific item on the new menu. A bit of a faux pas: burger #1 arrived well-done instead of my requested medium-rare. Burger #2 - reportedly prepared by Chef Jaret himself this time - was a little on the rare side, but I'm more than happy with that \"fault.\" Patty #2 had so much more life, and the overall profile was satisfyingly meaty and umami such that it didn't have to rely on the sweetness that I thought would've been provided by the tomato-onion jam.  I also tried the Garlic Parmesan Fries ($3.50 per receipt) per my server's recommendation. The fries are average shoestring, but the garlic parmesan flavor was delicious. The truffle and sweet potato fries did sound tempting, and I'll probably revisit them in the future.  ----  I returned a few weeks later to join a group of Yelpers. As I'd anticipated, we ended up sharing a slew of dishes.  CK Cheese Plate ($14): a must-try array of cheeses, fruits / fruit products, and honey which were altogether rich and varied in flavors and textures.  CK Meatballs ($13): strangely alluring, non-dry ground meat with more of a subtle flavor, strongly bolstered by an excellent sauce and ricotta combination.  Chopped Crunchy Salad ($9): texture and flavor contrasts are here aplenty, but I'm not that impressed by an array of raw veggie slices with some dressing and cheese.  Grilled Fresh Artichokes ($13): easily the star of the veggie dishes, with tender artichokes, delicious truffled cheese, a nice balsamic, and an addictive roasted garlic aioli.  Bone Marrow ($13): I'm not that experienced with more upscale treatments of the soft, fatty treat of I've had most often from the remnants of preparation of soup stock, but it seemed tasty enough if not very filling.  Tempura Popcorn Shrimp ($13.50): I don't see how this really conferred too many benefits over simple shrimp tempura or larger-sized shrimp.  House Smoked Wings ($12): my favorite of the night, with a crisp and sweet glazed skin and a noticeable smoky flavor (not just the scent). I was tempted to order this for myself alone, and now I'm certain that I will.  Tricolor Spring Beets Salad ($12): another good veggie dish, with goat cheese and beets forming a nuanced, balanced bite.  Polenta Fries ($10): mostly enjoyable for the texture and the sauce, marginal value making this something I'd ideally order for sharing in larger groups.  Pretzels & Beer Cheese ($12): a surprising treat, with a rich prominently beer-y cheese sauce that covered for any dryness in the moderately dense pretzel bread.  Heirloom Tomato Salad ($12): the grapefruit and vanilla gastrique and the shaved ricotta made this just good enough that I was able to banish the thought of \"why would anyone pay so much for a few slices of tomato?\"  Manila Clams ($16): the mix of ground pork and tender clams in that intriguing shallot white wine broth made this a very good dish, although I might have gotten just a touch of grit in one of the clams.  Sticky Toffee Cake w/ Vanilla Bean Gelato ($8): the oddly-reminiscent-of-corn-bread cake  was fluffy but didn't quite have the depth of sticky toffee-ness of the rich sticky toffee puddings that I've enjoyed. Excellent texture and flavor in the gelato though.  Creme Brulee w/ \"assorted\" housemade cookies ($7): not sure how getting two identical shortbread cookies constitutes an assortment. The most memorable part of this dish was the fruit.  Mason Jar Magic Bar ($7): wanted to love this, and the variety of textures and toppings was great, but the chocolate chantilly reminded me slightly too much of plain chocolate puddings rather than the rich decadence that I've had in many other chocolate desserts.  I've yet to partake in their wines or beers (select wines advertised as 50% off and selected bottled beers available for $3, both during happy hour only). Instead, I've relied on caffeine. Coffee ($3 sit-down cost) and Iced Latte ($3.50 sit-down) are solid options, brewed from the reliable Colorado River Coffee Roasters. Both gave me a good kick at the end of a workday. I somehow received the iced latte rather than an iced otherwise-black coffee, but it was enjoyably creamy nonetheless  By the way, another happy hour deal is 50% off baked goods (excluding the cold case), and although I wouldn't reorder several of my recent purchases at full price, the discount makes them excellent.  These meals and prior experiences at CRAFTkitchen have also resulted in a mix of excellent and merely good menu items, so 4* is right. Chef Jaret and his team deserve applause and customers for their sourcing and creativity, but a significant number of their creations don't quite hit the high marks that their pricing demands.",

I ordered a vegetarian omelette, it was a perfect combination of veggies and delicious eggs. My boyfriend ordered the Chorizo Scramble Skillets he loved it. Service and space is great, very modern and looks nice. Coffee is classy and good. We like spicy food so ordered their house salsa which was amazing (it's extra $0.75) but worth every penny. Will be back many times and try their desserts, they look bomb :)",

    "text": "Amazing birthday brunch yesterday!! The bottomless mimosas at $16 per person sounds bad at first, you are thinking on top of entrees & sides being high priced,  this is going to be some bill. However,  all of it is DAMN WORTH IT!   Unfortunately,  I did not get any pictures this trip. The food was too amazing to think of anything else. Not to mention the coffee is perfection (make sure to get some to go).   I had the pomegranate mimosa, quite a bit, delicious.   Jason & I shared each others meals. Carnitas Benedict & Salmon Benedict (add avocado), with a side of bacon & smashed potatoes.  Holy moley! It was amazing, if I didn't live polar opposite,  I'd go back today.   My brother enjoyed the chilaquiles which looked amazing & as he puts it, \"this may top one of my favorite places!\" (We are picky about Mexican food and prefer authentic hole in the walls)  The monkey bread was ok, but not my cup of tea. Those truffle fries are amazing with the lime citrus style ranch. (Stole some from the bro)   Yes, there may be a wait but get added to the waiting list via Yelp and it will be fine & worth it, anything good is.",

    "text": "Where should I start....  Being a good critic, I have traveled in numerous places and have searched for the best food in each city. Coming from Chicago, I try not to have high expectations but being in Vegas, I set the bar high since this city is another food mecca filled with talented cooks. For this restaurant, I definitely set the bar high with the long ass wait time and being one of the few healthy restaurants in the area. However, after today, I was definitely deeply disappointed like a kid who received coal on Christmas.  I'll try to keep it short and sweet since I only have 5 seconds of your attention.   1. Long wait times. How??? I'm guessing this place must be really short staff both waiters and cooks since there's plenty of open tables outside and food takes forever to come out.  We have tried coming here several times to just get slapped with a wait time, in which we didn't even bother. It gets worse after 10am. In addition, you get fooled with how the food really is, thinking it must be that good since people wait for such a long time in this super stretch line. Buzzkill for you- it's not worth the money or wait.   2. Great healthy options, why they can keep a star. One of the few places offering healthy breakfast options. We tried one of the expensive items on their menu- smoked salmon on pretzel bun. WHAT ARE THESE PEOPLE RAVING ABOUT?!!!!! I've tried every smoked salmon in most cities and several brunch places. THIS IS NOT WORTH ANY PENNY. First of all, you pay about $14 for a cold pretzel bun, not even lightly toasted and it's smothered in cream cheese. I can get the same thing in California or Chicago for a cheaper price on a toasted bread plus a poach egg. BOOM! Hopefully this blows peoples mind. Now ask yourself, is it worth the wait and money? Not for the smoked salmon on pretzel bun. I don't like to judge on first impression but obviously, if that wasn't up to par for the price, the the quality of the rest of the items are not either. Sorry, truth hurts.  Other things that you can read more about or move on to the next review, but it's just me and my opinions. I dare you to try it and not agree with me.   3.The ambiance is nice with a flake hipster vibe or just trying too hard. When I say this, I mean: plants are fake, they went cheap in which they can't even afford real glasses for drinks(plastic cups you drink from at a buffet) and they just totally gave up on the decor outside(missing plants in plant bins). Talk about carelessness for quality and service.   4.Staff was super nice but looked overworked. They couldn't even stop by and asked if we needed anything else or how we liked our meal. We didn't even bother staying too long. We ordered right when we sat down. We wanted to save time waiting for service, food, and the check since everyone around us waited a long time for any kind of service.   My advice: check out the other breakfast places around you or just cook yourself a good breakfast. It'll probably easier to just order for pickup from this place like the rest of the customers do.",

I think they're kind of pricey here because their food isn't anything to die for. I don't ever crave anything from here and it's never a place I choose to eat at.

The French fries were good, but I'm pretty sure that's my favorite food any where.  Anyway the reason we went there was the bf wanted to try the shrimp tacos he saw a photo of somewhere--big bust for him. He felt there was absolutely no flavor.  He wasn't drinking, or I would have had the unlimited mimosas! Next time.  I went another time with my gf and she absolutely loved it! I had the veg omlette, and it was good. I'd like to come back and try the avocado toast.  Love the decor, reminds me of some San Diego food stops, the chair could be more comfortable-was a tad bit on the not comfy side.",

ALL of us were NOT impressed at all with the food we ate Plus prices are a little overpriced for the portions AND service sucked. Our waitress finally came to take our order and when I asked her about the ube pancakes and she said they don't have it today she walked away and went to other tables to pick up their dirty dishes and talk to them and didn't come back for a while. Then when she FINALLY came back to take our order she wasn't very friendly. Then after our food came we ordered the creme brulee French toast and red velvet pancakes she didn't bring us maple syrup but she walked away so fast and didn't ask if we needed anything else.  So it took me a while to flag her down to get the syrup and also sugar for our cup of coffee which my brother needed from the beginning. She didn't check up on us till we were done eating. So service was bad and food wasn't up to par either. I can cook better tasting pancakes.",

With an extensive vegan menu as well as quality food and presentation, CRAFTkitchen impressed us throughout our whole experience.  We came here on a Tuesday around 2 pm - just an hour before they close. Thankfully, they accommodated us, no problem, and gave us great service to boot.  We split the vegan avocado smash toast, the truffle fries, and I had the vegan soyrizo breakfast burrito. My husband had a gorgeous foam-art latte + biscotti and loco moco dish to himself. We LOVED our food. I cannot emphasize that enough. It was presented beautifully and tasted amazing.  I think the only constructive feedback I can give is that my burrito probably would have been even better if the potato was cut smaller inside, and/or if it had tofu scramble. No matter what though, it was a great meal and staff treated us exquisitely. We love the large vegan vs. regular menus available.   We're going to be having brunch here again soon - I'm looking forward to trying the vegan chilaquiles.",

I ordered the Creme Brulee French Toast for a whopping $12.95.  This is fairly pricey for it to not come with any side dish.  Luckily, it was filling after finishing half of it.  Was there actually Creme Brulee on the top you ask?? YES.  Was the filling flavorful??  YES without being overbearing.  It was PERFECT.  Even the syrup tasted great.  Unfortunately, ordering a side of breakfast meat for $4 was ridiculous in my opinion so I didn't get around to trying those.  From what I can tell, everything is made to order with quality ingreds. so I'm sure either of the meats would've been just as enjoyable.  My chai latte ($3.75) was yummy, too but it's almost impossible to mess that up.  And you can add vanilla syrup for free!  I say they should improve pricing or AT LEAST offer one side to go along with your entree.  Otherwise, awesome place.",

    "text": "New Years Eve Brunch was so phenomenal! This is my third dining experience here and I just can't say enough good things about this restaurant except I wish there was one closer to me! Located at the top of Eastern Avenue in Green Valley but so easy to find.   Since they were featuring so many of the brunch favorites, we decided to come on in. We were warmly greeted and although we had to wait for a table, so worth it! I had only eaten outside before and we sat inside this time. Interior seating is basic and clean. I loved the mini succulent plants on each table and the old fashioned metal chairs. This place is all about the food!!   We all reviewed the menu and decided we would all get something different and share. We had a fantastic server who was so kind and she delivered on point. We ordered the pork carnitas omelette with lime crema and cheese, the CK Benedict, the CK croissant with apple bacon, egg and cheese and we topped it off with an order of the Churro Waffles! Mom and I both enjoyed mimosa's, mine was Blood Orange and hers was orange. Each dish was delicious in its own way but the True winners were the pork carnitas omelette and the churro waffles! The lime crema balanced the spicy and  the sweet of the carnitas the t and the churro waffles were simply out of this world.   This place is always bustling and busy but they are never to busy to help you or get you what you need! I have now had brunch here twice, the first time enjoying monkey bread and the avocado toast and now this time. I have also enjoyed lunch here as well.   CRAFTKitchen is a winner in all aspects. I will be back again! You will be so glad you stopped in to eat here, bravo to the chef! Living in a large metropolis that offers so many choices of places to eat, CRAFTKitchen is one place you don't want to skip!",

I enjoyed the vegan menu option, from which I ordered the Crispy Avocado Tacos- BOMB! My boyfriend ordered the Smoked Salmon Benedict, which he devoured :-)  The service however... Not fantastic. Our server seemed flustered and was constantly missing. We waited for our tab for a long time and were given another table's check. In the future, I hope the server makes our visit more pleasurable.",

    "text": "I would love to give this place more than 5 stars!  For starters my BF and I shared a Carmel apple pastry called a Kouign Amann. So delicious and a really good size for $4.50. The breading is like a wonderfully dense egg-ie croissant.  My BF and I fought over the last bite - he let me win.   My BF got the croissant sandwich. The bacon was wonderful - cooked perfectly and was thick enough to be chewy (in a good way). The croissant was also nice and fluffy. The side salad was a nice touch.   I got the pork carnitas omelette. The tomatillo sauce is fabulous. The pork is wonderfully prepared - moist but not soggy. I would love to have this dish swimming in the sauce but it would probably get too spicy for me (it does have a kick to it).  Most of the omelette I had to eat the next day as between the pastry to start and the small Yule log we got for the dessert, I was full.",

The atmosphere of CraftKitchen has a clean and modern vibe with both indoor and outdoor seating. They also offer a private room that you can reserve if you have a large party seating. Also, there are delicious fresh baked pastries and goods in the glass case up front which are nice to take home if you get too full.  There are several favorite dishes that I recommend like starting off with the Monkey Bread to share with your table. It is so fun to share and a nice way to break bread with others. The menu is Modern American which includes tacos, egg dishes, omelets and sandwiches. All are a twist on classics that give it that Modern American flair.  The service at CraftKitchen is friendly and professional. I have never had a bad experience within these past years. Only delicious food and great service within a fun modern atmosphere.",

Once I walked in, again I was surprised at the size and the cute decor- definitely my style with the rustic, modern decor! We had the private room in the back which is separated by a clear glass, which made our brunch more intimate. This private room could fit about 10-12 comfortably so if your in need for a spot of that size, consider CK for the private space!   Okay, so let's discuss food. You can tell that they put a lot of thought in the food presentation here because everything that came out from the kitchen was pretty! I ordered the short rib hash and this is a meal within itself. The meat was very tender, so soft it practically melted like butter! The smothered sauce on top was very flavorful. Peep my pic to get a tease. Order this if you visit!   Besides the optimal options for brunch and lunch menu items- this place is also known for their pastries. If you're looking for a cute brunch spot, consider CRAFT!",

    "text": "I cannot sing the praises of this restaurant enough.  You just have to go there to really understand how seriously awesome this place is.  It looks like just another average sized, contemporary American restaurant but OMG, it could do no wrong.  My single issue: The hostess wasn't that friendly.  She was young and just sort of \"Meh\" about putting our name down and answering the few questions we had. At first I was a little bothered by her uncaring, curt attitude but then I thought, I waited two days to try this place and now I'm going to have to wait another 30 minutes in line, so I'm not going to let this spoil what is hopefully a happy meal experience with my family.  So I let it go.  We were seated sooner than expected.  Devin was our server and I think he enjoyed our back-and-forth banter as much as we enjoyed him.  He was on top of it all.  My Vanilla Latte was exactly the way I wanted it.  My husband's mimosa was the right amount of everything.  He said the alcohol level and taste were spot-on and that if we didn't have to leave, he would've just kept on drinking (LOL).  We got: -Cuban Sandwich -Chimichurri Steak Sandwich -Butternut Squash Hash -CRAFT Benedict -Salmon Benny -Black & White Cookie -Creme Brulee -Mango Panna Cotta -huge Macaron (they pulled a misnomer on that one and labeled it a \"macaroon\"- tsk tsk!)  Honestly, I could NOT believe how amazingly perfect the entire meal was from service to food.  Everything tasted way better than we expected and the prices, especially on the fantastic desserts, were more than fair. Not one item tasted just \"okay.\" Everything was fabulous. My CRAFT Benedict had thick slices of ham that were so generously cut and the saltiness was at a minimum. The flavors were just beautiful, the absolute *BEST* Eggs Benedict I have ever had.  I cannot stop bragging about this place.  My husband is not a foodie at all but he said this place was great.  My two older kids with discerning tastebuds that they get from their mother were beyond impressed.  My daughter kept ooh-ing and aah-ing about her Salmon Benny while my son had everyone try a piece of his Chimichurri Steak Sandwich because of how absolutely flawless it was cooked and seasoned.  Neither my husband nor I are huge red meat fans but that steak was everything!  Every steak needs to taste like the it was cooked by the chef(s) of CRAFTkitchen.  I'm not big on macarons but this one was pleasantly delicious.  I was delighted to find a most sweet strawberry filling in the center, which was totally unexpected.  The kids gushed with happiness when they saw it.  The other thing that caught me off guard was the B&W Cookie.  First of all, that thing was gigantic.  I never liked B&W cookies because I always found them to be dry and crunchy, which I hate.  So I didn't bother trying it until hours later when we were stuck on awful traffic coming back home from Vegas.  I took a bite and it was so soft and moist that I was actually taken aback.  So I checked it out and it turned out to be more of a cake than a cookie and thought, OMG, they are brilliant!  Again it ran through my mind that this place could do nothing wrong.  It's been a long time since any eatery has wowed me to this level.  Very few places in general have ever left such an impression like this on me.  Thank you so much, CRAFTkitchen, for just knocking it way out of the park and exceeding any standards we had.  Each one of us walked away feeling so satisfied with the entire experience.  I cannot wait to visit you again all the way from Los Angeles!",

    "text": "It has been said that the \"best\" Restaurants are those guests want to visit repeatedly, and from the moment one sets foot inside CRAFTkitchen a desire to be anywhere else diminishes, everything from smiling servers to a smell of Yeast in the air appealing, as too is the modern yet pleasant decor.  Now a staple of the '702' since 2015, Jaret and Tami Blinn's investment of money, time and talent a winning combination thanks to passion plus a commitment to quality, it was arriving before the 11:00am rush that three guests were seated near paintings made by Blinns' daughter, just another element making the place feel anything but corporate.  Surrounded by couples and families of all-ages, many opting for alfresco seating while dining on items old or new, it was with individually made cups of Coffee in hand that six Pastries arrived first, a Blueberry Lemon Poppyseed Scone made without Animal products found to be a bit dry but soon forgotten in favor of classics like the Cinnamon Roll, Poptart with housemade Jam or an all-new Viennesoire layered with ground Pistachios and boozy Cherries.  Not forgetting Kouign Amann and its layers of Pastry plus Butter, the savory version with Ham and Cheese good but Strawberries plus Rhubarb with a bit of bite even better, it was while indulging in Sin City's best Monkey Bread that two sweet plates arrived, weekend-special Pancakes soaked by Blueberries standing tall while Texas Toast with a crystallized Sugar top is not only delicious, but texturally splendid.    Bridging sweet to savory with individually portioned Chia Pudding, the consistency just right thanks to Coconut Milk, Fruit and Nuts, suffice it to say that for fans of smoked Fish the #everchangingbrunch Benedict was a winner from top to bottom while those seeking a bit of heat may instead want to check out Chilaquiles that hold up well thanks to thick Tortillas, or a Short Rib Grilled Cheese that has migrated from weekends-only to main menu thanks to housemade Bread plus slow-cooked Beef blanked by Cheese, Peppers and Onions.   Switching back to sweet, two new Cookies continuing just as predecessors have in terms of quality, it was after devouring a Brownie featuring both soft Fudge and firm Chips amidst swirls of Nutella that the \"grand finale\" arrived, Chef Blinn taking time out of his otherwise busy schedule to surprise a fan with his Carrot Cake, in this case presented \"Naked\" style but still moist and delicious thanks to bold spice notes and particularly tangy Icing.",

The burrito itself is not humongous, but so dense that you will not leave hungry. I would prefer a spicer mix in the burrito and a spicer, larger side of sauce - instead of the tastefully looking thimble container of sauce accompanying the meal.  The Short Rib Hash is not to be missed, it is demi braised short ribs, smashed potatoes, roasted sweet onions and peppers. The meat is sumptuous, fall off the bone tender, and the potatoes are expertly seasoned. The glutton in me would prefer a lager portion of meat, but again the meal is so rich-you won't leave hungry.  Service is top notch, friendly, and accommodating. The atmosphere is casual and stylish.",

    "text": "Craftkitchen has been in the neighborhood for a few years and I can say that it's one of my favorite go to spots.   The restaurant reminds me of a place you'd find in San Diego. It's bright with simple modern decorating. They offer indoor and outdoor seating. In the back there is a private room that can hold up to 20 people with an 8 person minimum.    I've enjoyed everything I've tried from their breakfast and lunch menu. The brunch specials are always unique and well executed. The pastry case has never disappointed either, the staples or the weekend specials. One of their signature items and for good reason is the monkey bread which is great for sharing. Recently, I tried the Creme Brulee Stuffed French Toast that was also amazing.   On my most recent visit I reserved the private room for a small group. The staff that I emailed and talked to in the reservation process were friendly and helpful. Troi was our server for brunch and he was great. Thank you for taking care of our group, Troi! We were definitely not his own table, but you would have thought so by how attentive he was with our table.   Craftkitchen would get a bonus star if they ever bring back Happy Hour. My friend and I came here when it was offered and loved it. I'd love to return with a group for Happy Hour if it is every offered again!",

    "text": "This is probably going to be the most difficult review to write because our experience here was so \"off.\" Some of the food was excellent, some of it was horrible, the manger's customer service was excellent, the server's was horrible.   First, we went on a Sunday for brunch, and they were moderately busy. We had to wait a short 5 minutes to be seated. The decor of this restaurant is very modern/clean appearing, and we sat at a cool little wooden table near the window which was great for people watching.  We were first greeted by someone who said they weren't our waiter but that they wanted to get us drinks started, we both ordered lattes. Ten minutes went by and our server comes up and asks if we had our drink order taken yet and then asked if we were ready to order food. We said yes we ordered lattes, ordered food, and then another 20 minutes went by. Our server came up to our table to check in on us and said \"let me check on those drinks.\" He came back a minute later with two lattes that were room temperature (clearly had been sitting on the counter for a while).  -Strike 1 (cold coffee) -Strike 2 (very long wait for coffee)  Our entrees came about 15 minutes later and apologized for the wait and said the chef would like to offer us a free dessert for the wait time. We didn't think the food wait was that big of a deal but given the rest of our experience we said thank you and took him up on the offer. The gesture was kind and we appreciated it.   About a third of the way into my breakfast (which consisted of the most under seasoned eggs and potatoes I think I have ever consumed in my life), I found a long dark colored hair in my food (which didn't belong to either of us as our hair is short). I grabbed the manager who was walking by, she was very polite, apologized profusely, and offered to have something else made for me. I declined and helped my husband finish his very delicious red velvet pancakes with cream cheese frosting (I'd recommend them without hesitation) -Strike 3 (hair in food) -Strike 4 (very bland)  We finished our food and our table was cleared and the manger again asked if we would like anything else on the house to make up for our experience. We declined, simply taking the dessert previously offered to us. From the point that we finished dessert, until the point we were able to leave then took another 35 minutes. The server insisted on running to every table around us and didn't bring our check. I finally had to get up and ask the hostess if we could get our check and it was brought ten minutes later.  -Strike 5 (ridiculously long wait just to get our check)  All in all a very weird experience. The server was definitely not busy enough (he had a total of three tables with a total of 7 guests including the two of us) to have left us hanging at the end like he did. He honestly just seemed like a total space cadet. Despite the multiple errors, I will try to be back because I want to believe this place is capable of better (and maybe the server was just having an off day), much better, but we did not leave very satisfied overall.

    "text": "We stopped by CRAFTkitchen by [semi]-accident. I actually had my Yelp directions set for Kitchen Table but my cousin who is a local in Las Vegas directed us to CRAFTkitchen. The restaurant looked super cute and trendy so we decided to give it a try. We were first-timers here and definitely weren't disappointed.   UPON ARRIVAL & ATMOSPHERE: CRAFTkitchen is located within a shopping center. Tons of parking. We arrived around 2:30pm. We were hesitant because we didn't want to be \"those\" people who arrive right before closing, but there were quite a bit of people still seated so we didn't feel too bad. The restaurant was very trendy, modern, and \"hipster.\" Nicely furnished, simple decor, and fresh herbs in their [meeting] room.  FOOD: I ordered the SMOKED SALMON on a pretzel bun. SO GOOD! Did your mouth water from the pictures you scrolled through? Well good news, it looks just like the pictures on Yelp and it was love at first bite. However, by the last bites it started tasting really salty. I still demolished it though. My cousin ordered the CHICKEN & WHAT? I didn't get to try it--let's just say his meal was gone within 5 minutes. He's either super greedy and finished it before I can ask to try it..or it was just that good. His argument is that it was just that good! I believe him. He originally ordered the Loaded Roast Beef but they didn't have enough pretzel buns for both of us (a small let down.) He asked to substitute the bun with focaccia bread but they were also out!  SERVICE: Although we came within the last hour of operation, we did not feel rushed at all. Our server was phenomenal. She was very apologetic about what they were sold out on and she was quick to refill our drinks. Huge plus!   Would I recommend this place? Absolutely.",

I was super excited to try the salmon because everyone has it on their yelp, but the salmon was just too salty for me. Don't get me wrong, there was a LOT of salmon on that pretzel bun, but still too salty, I didn't finish it. The smashed potatoes were pretty cool, but I wouldn't try them again. Our service was really slow and it took forever for a server to even take our order. She just kept walking back and forth around us, but never asked if we were ready. Maybe next time in the area I'll try it out, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.",

The food is a funky mix of items that you may not find at other more traditional breakfast places. The food was hot, fresh, colorful, flavorful, and filling. Why the middle of the road rating?? The service and the seating are not something I want to experience on a regular basis. Wait staff seemed overwhelmed and rushed. It was like they were trying to be patient and engage with the customers but they just didn't have the time.  The seating is very tightly packed together and when you get that place full it was so hard to hear that I had to raise my voice to be heard by my friend across the table. Then the front entrance was blocked by the people waiting to be seated- not sure how code enforcement would feel about that. It just gave me like an anxious/rushed feeling while I was eating. There are tables outside if you want to brave the elements but I would be afraid that service is even slower if you eat outside.  Sad to say the cramped style of eating is not my cup of tea so I will let all the 4 and 5 star reviewers eat there while I dine elsewhere.",

    "text": "The last thing this neighborhood needed was another greasy spoon breakfast place! *eye roll* No offense to those businesses, since there's a time, a place and obviously a market for that but my preference is now gravitating towards high quality, organic foods. I am a follower of the paleo diet, so CRAFTkitchen is one of the few options I have to find my type of food. To quote Jim Rohn, \"Take care of your body. It's the only place you have to live.\" I'm a firm believer in that.  Thank you Jaret Blinn for answering my prayers and putting this gem and welcome addition to the neighborhood near me. I now have a favorite brunch place that I can take all my friends to. I'm not just saying that because of the bottomless mimosas on weekends, although they certainly don't hurt matters either. *wink wink*   I love that they have gluten free options on their menu. I have a lot of gluten intolerant friends actually, so I take that into account when selecting restaurants. All of their ingredients are farm fresh and the presentation is just like you would expect from the fanciest of restaurants.   It's always super packed as of late and I worry it's just going to get worse as more and more people discover it because of all these great reviews they have. The modern contemporary meets industrial chic decor is definitely cool, it could stand to be a bit more comfy, but then that would also cause longer wait times, since people would be more prone to stay longer. I know how it works. I get it! That's just a lil gripe because I do like a bit of padding for my derriere when I sit down. Haha!   I do wish they'd make room for more tables (or make better use of the space). The long table across from the coffee bar is a nice place to wait to be seated but if they made that useable space, then maybe there wouldn't have to be as long of a wait, since people would be seated somewhere to get their orders going. Just a thought. That's my only suggestion. Other than that, they are on the right track. It's so cool to have been a customer since the beginning and watch their success grow. :)",

As a person who's originally from Portland, I can say this restaurant would fit in with the Portlandia crowd. That being said, it's probably why the staff act the way they do. If you watch Portlandia, you'll know what I mean.  I ordered the croissant breakfast sandwich. Husband ordered the smoked salmon on pretzel bread. Both were delectable. The croissant was a little greasy, making it incredibly rich. However, the little salad that comes with, refreshed the palate. The little potato chips served on top of the salad add a much needed crunch to the entire dish.  Order their coffee! Freshly brewed per cup. It makes an amazingly rich and strong cup. And it's local. We'll be going back until we've tried everything on their menu.",

About 15 min later about 40% of the tables were empty and multiple parties were still waiting to be seated. They seemed to be understaffed and unable to seat all of their tables on a Saturday morning. After a 20 minute wait in a half empty restaurant we finally sat down. From that point on we continued to be unimpressed. The service was slow and terrible. We were in a sea of unhappy faces. The other tables, like us, struggled to get a waitress to provide things like silverware after the food was delivered. The presentation of the meal was underwhelming as was the food. My breakfast burrito was filled with mostly whole pieces of potato and the flavor was nothing special. I don't get the opportunity to go out to breakfast much on the weekend so this experience was highly disappointing. 2 out of our 3 visits here weren't great so definitely going with other breakfast places in the area next time.",

It had the perfect amount of filling and our server was excellent when she offered to warm it up for us! Took me right back to my childhood.  We then moved on to the protein plate and chorizo and eggs- both were fantastic! Everything was wonderful and I am excited to try it out again. Brunch anyone?",

I had actually been wanting to come here for brunch for quite sometime,but for some reason I always end up at Kitchen Table. I was greeted immediately by a very courteous young man who seated me promptly at the table I requested. A few minutes later an Asian waiter came to take my order. I requested the croque Monsieur be made a croque Madame and I also ordered a side of truffle fries with a small orange juice . All the food was very tasty (with the exception of the bread on the croque I was not a fan) and the oj was very fresh of course. The only reason why I gave this spot three stars and not 4 was because after my waiter took my order, I never saw him again. I had to get up and ask for whatever I needed and at the end of my meal get up and ask for my check. In defense of the staff EVERYONE ELSE other than my waiter was fantastic and very attentive. Perhaps he went on break? Maybe he should've let someone know?",

Everything seemed very pricey, but I split salad with a friend. Split was done in kitchen, and portions were more than enough for both of us. Ate with several other ladies who are usually critical but there were no complaints from any of the 8 ladies. Everything was plated so beautifully. Can't wait to return for more.

They treated it like a job and did not seem particularly sincere.  I can't remember what my husband had, but I remember him saying that it was just OK.

So I tried the pulled turkey benedict, side of thick bacon and coffee. I was the only one in the restaurant and you know when you have checked your phone email, facebook, maybe a couple other sites, and you realize hey, I don't have my food yet and I have to get to work? That would be the case! When it did arrive the muffin was warm on the bottom and the egg warm on top, but the turkey, tomato, avocado and the side of too thick hollandaise in a chipped china container were all cold. Which made too large of a percentage of cold in the stack for me, and not pleasant to eat. I have had good thick bacon before as advertised for $5 we make it at home so I know it's expensive, but I am going to guess that this was not cooked that morning and reheated. Coffee was good and glad to see they did not break the $3 for it.  So this all added up to a $22 breakfast, so that questions my breakfast price value perception, for that price I'm kinda expecting an ocean view! But the menu looked interesting so we could find ourselves back for another try.",

The service staff was in training, but from what I encountered they should be up to the task with friendly smiles.  My favorite was the short rib hash.  Meat was so tender and flavorful I just wanted MORE of it.  Not your typical \"hash\"  Beef was laid over crispy small potatoes..highly recommend this dish.  Citrus & Crab salad was very refreshing and you can tell it was freshly made.  Need a fork and knife to eat.  Chorizo shepherd's pie..need I saw more?  Just the right amount of kick without overwhelming your taste buds.  Pulled Turkey Benny didn't sound that great to me, but someone else at my table ordered so I got to a chance to try it.  Wow what a pleasant surprise.  Fresh and actually did not feel like a heavy dish.  The sauce that came with it was excellent.  Chicken and What?  Have to admit I am not a white meat person and this was boneless white meat.  My 8 yr old son liked it, but I would have preferred a drumstick.  Just a warning so you are clear of what you will be getting.  Beef sliders where very good.  Grass fed beef done perfectly.  Would have liked some sauce options that woudl have made them perfect.  The pastries and desserts is where Craft Kitchen truly shines.  Had a sampling of both and every item was perfection.  Several where gluten free and I could not tell.  This place is committed to good food and healthy choices and includes a lot of gluten free options.  Can't wait to go back and try all their other offerings.  The owners, Tami and Jaret Blinn will be creating more items and I am very excited to return and experience more of their craftiness in the kitchen!",

I like the avocado bread, so no complain on that one, and we got another pork hash that was quite a disappointment, I know they maybe are trying to be healthy, but there's literally no taste in it at all.....and way over priced for the amount of pork we got, we went to DW Bistro sunday brunch and we can get their pork hash for exact same price with super tasty sauce on it and portion is almost 3 times as much.  I just feel the restaurant is a bit pretentious....really good decoration inside though...",

It seemed like they forgot we where there, I asked for tortillas and they never came. Drank my latte' without sugar, are our food and left. We where paying and the waitress looked at me and then the tip thing(we where getting change for her tip).. made it really uncomfortable.

Ok so I finally got back to Craft Kitchen this past Sunday.  And it went from 5 stars to 2 stars, not because of the food but simply because of the way the place is managed.  It was a Sunday, so understood that there would be a long wait (we were told 45mins), but when there were consistently 2-6 open tables at any given time during our wait time, I just find it unacceptable.  The friend I was with told me this is just standard practice her.  Service is consistently slow, waits long and they leave dirty tables sitting instead of turning them over and getting customers seated . When we finally did bet seated, no \"thank for being patient/waiting\". Lots of great places to eat in this town.  Food is great.  I'll give them that.",

We like to come and drink some mimosas while eating good food (but really who doesn't love that) usually the service is on point the most recent time I came here the waitress made it seem like we were bothering her. Usually when people order, the waitress makes sure there's nothing else you want, but not this one. The second my boyfriend was done saying his entree she whisked away our menus, but I needed fries in my life. She apparently didn't care. You know the service is subpar when your house coffee cup isn't refilled once. WHO DOESN'T REFILL A CUSTOMER'S CUP OF WATER OR COFFEE. (end of service rant)  Chorizo scramble: This place perfects the scramble. The thing I love most about this is that it was nicely layered. Every bite had everything, which is hard for some places. Everything worked together so well. It was beautifully presented and it seemed like it was baked together in a way because everything stayed on my fork without struggling to eat it in one bite.  Carnitas Benedict: My boyfriend seemed deterred from having the sauce on the side. The poached egg was overdone. Poached eggs are supposed to ooze out but ours just stayed in place. How are we supposed to take our yolk porn video for the insta story if it doesn't ooze out? The carnitas was cooked well. Despite the egg troubles, the plate itself tasted like perfection.   I've been seeing a lot about their happy hour, can't wait to give it a go!",

It was presented well and was very filling. I can typically eat a whole entree however this was hard to do. It was flavorful and fresh. Also my aervice was good. Emily waited on our table and she recommended us many food items that were a hit for my friends visiting from out of town. This will definitely be my go to place when with friends. I also recommend using the YELP app to check in because wait times can be 45 mins during busy times.",

One of my favorite things about this spot is the succulents on the patio but during my most recent visit, they were nowhere to be seen. My other favorite things about this place are the food and the cronut. Yes, I know that cronuts are food but they are so delicious here that they belong in their own category.   For those folks who are unfamiliar with a cronut, it's a croissant donut. Also, where have you been!?! I mean, WHAT?! Flaky buttery layers of pastry heaven that you must devour before your friends ask for a bite. There is a host to greet you and seat you but make your way to the pastry case before you sit down. You have to survey the goods!  Service here has always been A-OK for me. They once forgot to bring me my Nutella cronut but still *almost* charged me for it. They were super apologetic when I brought it to their attention, took it off the bill, and still packaged one up for me to go. That's what I call exceptional guest service.   I've enjoyed the Avocado Toast but could do without the sunflower seeds. I've loved the Acai Bowl with a side of bacon. I was disappointed with the Ham Benedict. My ham was cold and cut too thick for my liking plus the sauce is served on the side without my asking. I'm all for the sauce life and wasn't into pouring it myself. My most recent visit I enjoyed the Crustless Quiche of the Day. It's served in a small baking dish with a side salad. Fluffy and light, filling but not heavy. Super into it. I enjoyed the patio with a pal and her pup so it's nice to know it's pet-friendly!  Yum.",

We arrived as a table for 2 at 10am and waited 10 minutes which was expected considering the popularity. Our server was polite and friendly.She explained the menu, gave her recommendations, and overall was very helpful. The inside itself was very bright and welcoming with plant decor. We ended up ordering the monkey bread as an appetizer which was delicious but made no room for dessert. I had the pork carnitas benedict and it was absolutely amazing! Probably the best I've had so far. My friend had the chicken and waffles and was also very satisfied. As we left, there was a line however that didn't stop us from agreeing to visit again. It's a little pricey but definitely worth it.   5 stars and worth the wait!",

It's got that super hipster \"you an take Instagram photos here\" feel about it, which I'm down with (obviously, I write yelp reviews and am about to post an insta pic). However, the food is pretty dang good. My benny was perfect for lunch, the capers were fried or something and were oddly enough, the star of the meal. My friend's burrito was good to them, but I hate a lot of the ingredients (personal preferences). The plants were cute, the little tea pot was adorable. The portions were great, my yolk was perfectly runny, there was a glass meeting space that my friend is hoping to rent soon.  The only reason for it being one star down is the acoustics. It was loudddd. The floor is concrete and there are brick walls. While it looks slick, it doesn't allow for audio absorption. Maybe put up some planters with padding behind them, add come cushions to the booths, etc. It was a good place, but we need to be able to talk about our yummy food, not just eat it.",

Waving down the waitress to order, to get another drink, to get the check,etc. I hope they step up the service as the food is awesome!  Update: went today and had brunch. Leslie is the star server!

    "text": "Sometimes your visual perception of something is painfully deceptive when it comes to the quality of the item itself. I think that's where Instagram fails us as patrons. Sure that purple colored waffle covered in Fruity Pebbles under a mountain of whipped cream looks delicious, but is it? Or does it just taste like sugar infused Bisquick with 3 dollar cereal sprinkles? I too have fallen victim to the wonderfully talented Instagram foodie photographers.  Why the long winded lead in? Well it's kind of where this review starts, an Instagram photo. Of course I didn't order what was in those photos but I was otherwise influenced by them. As a blogger / vlogger and foodie myself I seem to forget that beauty sometimes really is only skin deep.   It's not to say that my experience at CRAFTkitchen was bad or that the food was bad, but it is to say that  believing isn't always seeing. I really did enjoy our visit and the service was wonderful. The staff was very courteous and friendly and we really never waited for anything. That aside, the food wasn't worth the cost.   We ordered the Monkey Bread as a starter and it was delicious. A little dry as I'm used to it being moist and sticky but very sweet and flavorful. Now's where my experience falters a bit. Alex and Brittney ordered the Short Rib Grilled Cheese sandwich. It was my first choice and I even pointed it out to them. For some reason though, I changed my mind. Instead I ordered the Chicken and What?   Their beautiful pulled short rib sandwiches arrived covered in caramelized onions, peppadew peppers and all blanketed in melted Havarti cheese between toasted sourdough. They were amazing. I know this because I finished Brittney's. A truly wonderful sandwich.  I'm almost sad to write about mine and I really wished I had looked for a picture of it before I ordered it. Chicken and What is their rendition of chicken and waffles. What I received however can only be described as two swollen Eggos and two chicken fingers. I'm not even trying to be funny about this. I was turned on by the pickled jalapeno maple syrup but immediately turned off by the fact that I was spending a fortune for a Happy Meal. A Happy Meal that had absolutely no taste of jalapeno, pickled or otherwise.   All of this being said my rating of three stars is not because the Chicken and What is a fail, but because the CRAFTkitchen is just too expensive for the quality of food. After winning multiple readers polls I have to ask myself what happened to that quality that got them there? My reviews are based on my experience and though the experience was fun, the cost for quality and portion was just way too high.

I mean, there is understanding on our end since we didn't make a reservation. In any case, we were happily served right away and given our bottomless mimosas  Definitely am a fan of the mango mimosa and pomegranate mimosa! Ordered the crab cake Benedict and SO HAPPY that I did. Crispy crab cakes and avocado spread? Yes, please! I literally wiped my plate clean.   It seems like others were happy with their orders as well, like the salmon toast and omelets.   Single bathrooms, so you might have to wait.  Easy parking since it is located in a shopping plaza in Henderson!  Would return, and probs with a rezzy...",

    "text": "Word to the wise, use Yelp waitlist if you go here! They even encourage it at the front with a cute sign that tells people to download the app and use it! Pretty awesome.  I say that because the wait could have been so much worse than it was for us. We \"got in line\" right when we left the house and only ended up waiting about 10 minutes when we got there, which could have easily been 30-45 minute wait if we would have just put our name in when we got there! AMAZING!  The only weird thing was that when we got there, we mentioned we were fine sitting outside, but they mentioned they sit by server so if we wanted to sit outside it wouldn't make a difference of us sitting sooner. But no worries on that because we didn't wait too long.  Now on to the drinks & food. WOW! Absolutely incredible. I decided to opt in for the bottomless mimosas because even if I had two, it would be totally worth it because of the price. They had a few different flavors to choose from, but I ended up having the pomegranate one, which was super delicious.  For brunch, I ordered the avocado toast which was topped with a poached egg and sunflower seeds, which I thought was such a great addition to the dish. My husband got the churro waffles, which seemed a little small when he first got them, but they were super sweet so it ended up being just the right amount for him anyway. I tried a bite and definitely had food envy. They seriously tasted just like a delicious churro! YUM! He also got a side of eggs and bacon, which he mentioned was prepared well, too.   We will definitely be back and I can't wait to take my sister when she comes to visit because it's definitely a spot I know she will enjoy!",

Everything seems so fresh and unique for the breakfasts options.  I would use the words farm fresh for some reason, but really, I am not sure.  Just everything was so creative.  A nice bakery set up greets you as you first come in. Man, if I was eating that stuff, it looked so good... I have been here several times now.  Just imagine the food with titles like Croissant Sammy, or Pork carnitas Omelet, or Goat Cheese Frittata.  I had the Protein Fix for breakfast, which was 3 eggs organize spinach, avocado and turkey sausage.  Excellent. OK, you can see I am watching my type of food...  Next time I came here, I tried the vegan menu in honor of my daughter and I wanted to check it out so I can bring her here too.  Had the greek salad with the gardein chicken.  The salad was wonderful, the gardein chicken a bit odd to me but I ate it... Of course I would.  They do have as I mentioned an entire Vegan menu and that would be very good for so many!  I am coming back to try that Korean Fried Chicken Burger. or the Short Rib Grilled Cheese.  Yeah, it will be on my \"cheat\" meal for those.  GK says, check it out, it will be busy but you will enjoy it.",

There's a \"private\" dining room too...it's more semi-private in reality bc the walls are glass and people in the main restaurant can definitely see you  The service is super friendly and high energy, though I found that it took longer than expected to bring the food out  Most plates will set you back $15 ish Got the pork carnitas benedict. Eggs came perfectly poached and I loved how they put the sauce on the side even when I forgot to request that. I was sharing this plate and thought it was great that they split the plate for us so it was easier to share. Also got the salmon salad to go. It came with a decent amount of salmon. I liked how the salmon came out hot, so they put it in a separate container. Very thoughtful!  Food is good, not mind-blowing. Not eager to come back here but wouldn't be resistant to it. I thought the service was better than the food lol",

Most places we've gone in the last 3 months aren't busy enough to wait.  Well, let me tell you, on a Monday, this place was POPPIN'.  The wait wasn't too bad (and you can join the wait list on Yelp!!!)  Service wasn't perfect.  It was a tiny bit slow but like I said it was packed in here (even all of the seats outside were taken, in 105 degree summer weather).  The food made up for it.  We loved the bakeries so much we bought some to go.  Everything came to our table beautifully presented, hot, fresh, and packed with flavor.  I don't think the price was off for what you get either.  I mean I've been to places that were more expensive for WAY LESS quality food.  Attention to detail is where it's at.  I mean the coffee came with a biscotti.  How many places still do that?  A mean latte with a biscotti for under $4!!!  Amazing.      Turns out that on Mondays you can get some of the Sunday brunch specials as well.  YAAASSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!  Looks like my mom and I might not need to try any other breakfast spots...",

The restaurant is very cute, has a small private dining room (for your special group outings or meetings), as well as patio seating.   The service is consistently good and everyone is friendly.   I love their everchanging brunch menu as well as some tried and True favorites from their regular menu (crispy avocado tacos, churro waffles, Cuban sandwich).  There is something for everyone as their menu is pretty diverse with breakfast and lunch items (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free options too!) and they also have an impressive selection of housemade pastries and desserts.  Weekends can be a challenge because the restaurant gets packed so be sure that you are okay with waiting for a table (bring a book or some fun people with you); otherwise, show up early! They also offer a waitlist through Yelp - which I recommend trying.  CRAFTkitchen is definitely the type of place that you will want to go to frequently - and if you can't - try their catering services!",

We got the salmon benny, several pastries, the French toast, and the frittata.  The frittata was amazing! It was vegetarian and still so flavorful! They definitely had several good vegetarian options that weren't just \"here have a vegetable.\" The Benedict was the best for sure. It was a huge portion of salmon and tasted really fresh.   We also did the bottomless mimosas. It's too bad they don't put the juice and champagne on the table for you to pick your own proportions but on the upside they were strong as heck (only a downside if you had later in the day plans...).

You can add your name to the waitlist via Yelp and then check in when you get there. We did that and walked outside to wait. About 2 minutes later, we got a text that our table was ready. We walked in behind a gal that just got there who was immediately seated at a four top table. He sat us at a two top surrounded but children... screaming children. We dont have kids, and it is fairly echoey so it put a bit of a damper on breakfast.   Our server (leslie I think) was prompt and friendly. We ordered the potato cake and salmon Benedict. It was good, but personally I prefer less salmon. I think it is a good amount for value, but I personally think salmon is overpowering and a little goes a long way. I probably would not order it again, but it was definitely edible.   Nothing that's making me die to go back.",

I think I leave with my stomach so full and I'm just so happy that I forget all about writing a review. My deepest apologies. I have enjoyed amazing breakfast during the week and the phenomenal ever-changing brunch on the weekend, as well.  The meals are always prepared to order and with the freshest ingredients possible.  I'll go on record as saying that my favorite breakfast at CRAFTkitchen is the Smashed Avocado Toast. For someone who has a sweet tooth this just blows my mind with the fresh greens. My poached egg was cooked exactly the way I like it, as well.   When my friends and I returned (on another date -- to celebrate my birthday) we decided to try out the brunch and we were pleasantly surprised with the vast menu options. We all tried something different and shared the CK Monkey Bread. Soooo yummy! Pretty sure we were rolled out of there that day. ;) The coffee is always fresh and delicious (which I, personally LOVE!) and the servers are extremely attentive.  CRAFTkitchen is by far one of my fave local places to eat. I'll continue to recommend it to anyone and everyone. Keep up the GREAT work!!",

We wanted to get a few things to go, but the servers wouldn't even wait for us to finish speaking before rushing off. In the end, it left a bitter taste to an otherwise great brunch.

My latte was dropped off with no sweetener and had to wave down help.. Also had to ask someone else to bring us waters.  Oatmeal Brulee was amazing with the sweet shell and they leave a nut assortment on the side that is delicious tossed in the oatmeal . Short Rib hash came out cold and bland for my taste. Dessert (bread pudding) was yummy. I sent my Bloody Mary back, the way they make it taste weird.. Like a virus smokey taste.. She said it was from the bacon but it wasn't the bacon in my opinion. I would order a standard Bloody Mary not theirs.",

It's bright and clean inside, with large, chunky wooden tables and metal chairs and benches. There's a coffee bar and a nice selection of pastries and baked goods such as tarts, cookies, muffins and cake pops. Cute succulents adorn each table and models the new healthy and modern style of eateries.  While not organic necessarily, it seems that loads of vegetables and more clean eating is the motto. They do say they try to use organic, local, GMO free, humanly sourced food when possible. Whole grains, micro greens and vegetable loaded dishes are commonplace on the menu.  Items ordered; turkey burgers sliders topped with a sauteed veggie and micro green mix served on whole wheat buns, with sweet potato fries and maple aioli. Absolutely delicious!! My hubby ordered an egg white omelet with spinach and homemade turkey-veggie patty, side of avocado (which I ate). He said it was fantastic. We got a side of the homemade spicy salsa, which was again super tasty! We gluttonously ordered a pumpkin muffin that was more of a cake, but decadently ambrosial. I had a cappuccino with nonfat milk, awesome!!  Service was friendly and attentive.  They are only open breakfast and lunch (until 3 pm) and I am hoping one day that they'll do dinner.  Will definitely be returning to Craft Kitchen soon!",

When asked the hostess reason why, she said she was told by management to stagger the seating so they can give us \"the best service possible\". When I asked if they were short staffed, she repeated the same answer again. Once we sat down, it became evident that their waitstaff was disorganized, which I consider to be poor guidance from management. They brought out half our order and told us to enjoy our meal and didn't realize our order wasn't complete.  I give this review 2 stars because their food was pretty good and the waiter was nice.  If management is reading this review, I recommend working on better leadership to create a more organized service. If you don't understand what I mean by this, then go to Cheesecake Factory (or any well established restaurant) and see how their service works.",

My other guest didn't even hear her and she turned away too quickly to even say we actually had other drinks and an appetizer we would like to order. Our server rarely checked on us after that, and only refilled low coffee once the entire meal, and our food didn't come out correct. We waited for an entree to be fixed and we're brought over cooked yet cold food in return nearly 20 minutes later. The food and especially service were some of the worst I've experienced and we will not be returning.",

A waiter held the door open for us and we were immediately greeted by the owner who sat us at a table.  She was sweet and gave us a quick over of the place and what to expect as far as food goes.   Our waiter Jenna was very nice and attentive.  She explained the menu very thoroughly to us since it was our first time there. She assured us our messy baby was no problem .  I loved that every person working was doing something.  They were either helping other tables or restocking or cleaning.   We ordered the truffle fries to share, husband got the chicken and waffles, and I got the roast beef sandwich.  We also ordered coffee, a cookie, pineapple/coconut pull apart bread (the only one eaten there), pecan sticky bun, and the berry scone.  We were absolutely thrilled with everything we ordered.  The portions were a nice size for the price and quality.  Everything was fresh and full of flavor. We couldn't have been happier.   I also loved the ambiance of the place.  The succulents on every table, the park benches, the wood mixed with metal, and even the light bulbs added character.  It's obvious lots of thought and attention went into all the details.  Even the salt and pepper shakers started a conversation! The only thing I would change is the music.  Beyonce screeching in my ear reminded me I was still in Vegas.   We can't wait to go back!  We've already shared it with a few Facebook groups we're on!  But being military, were always excited to take family and friends to new places far away from the strip whenever they come to visit.",

The coffee was almost $3 for a cup, which felt unreasonable for portion size and quality.   All in all way over priced for what was offered, and the quality of the food didn't live up to the decor.",

Maybe I was expecting the wrong thing. But it was like eating sweetened bread.   Short Rib Hash - the potatoes were really good, the short rib tasted just like beef roast. Comfort food.   CK House Burger - It was cooked well, really juicy. It was missing something though. My pickle wasn't very tangy and I wish I had some fresh onions or something.   Kids Meal- turkey slider was just bread and meat. Nothing at all on it and the meat wasn't very moist.   Overall, the presentation is what grabs you and draws you in! But this isn't a restaurant that would make me say, hey let's go back and try more food!",

Luis was great, he dealt with me asking a million questions about my food allergies and went back and forth to the kitchen several times to check with the chefs. They have a vegan menu and many things are gluten-free. I ended up getting the sweet potato hash with some modifications and it was yummy, although my critique of it was that it seemed more like potatoes with a topping of hash, so I would have preferred more of a balance of the ingredients. The other negative was that they served me my juice in a plastic cup even though we were dining in. I hate single-use plastic, why does a sit down restaurant feel the need to use it?!? Other than those two things, the experience was great.",

I included a picture of the menu they provided. I love the staff on the floor and in the kitchen! They excelled unmatched guest service and relations to their upscale etiquette towards food. Nothing beats welcoming staff members which they made our day much more enjoying as we feasted at our leisure. As a food critic, we held an event here to network and promote Crafts Kitchen's food. Even though we were all over the place, they were patient with us making sure we enjoyed every last bit of our stay. I recommend dining here when you get the chance to drop by Henderson.

Lke a local, I quickly tire of the Strip, the facade, the fakery, the mistreatment of workers at the hands of inebriated \"adults\" on their first trip to \"Disneyland\".  Sometimes you gotta get away.  Enter CRAFTkitchen.  A casual SoCal eatery (you know, micro greens, avocados, side salads).  From the second you walk in, the air perfumed with wonderful aromas, fresh brewing coffee, friendly faces.  The food, vibrant and fresh.  From the Early Hours menu, the braised short rib hash.  Tender braised short rib atop thick cut country fried potato topped with a fried egg and micro greens and dripping in its braising jus.  Break the yolk, mix it up.  Yes.  For something lighter, the smoked salmon.  A fresh toasted bagel with a thin smear of cream cheese, deep fried, crispy capers, beefsteak tomato, shaved onions and a mountain of velvety cold smoked salmon topped by micro beet greens.  Meltingly delicious and the perfect balance of flavors and texture.  From the Mid Hours menu, it's all about the croque monsieur panini.  Thin sliced Niman ranch ham, melted gruyere, creamy bechamel in fresh focacia, crisped in a panini press with a side of mesculine.   Nothing fancy, just good eats.  Finally, do not pass on the pastries.  The basic croissant, near perfect.  Flaky layers of thin, layers around a still moist, \"stretch when you pull it\" core with a gentle salinity and sweet butter finish.  The sticky bun; just get one, or two, or three.  Large portions.  Reasonable prices.  Very friendly, off Strip service.  Thank you Norm K. for the excellent review that sent me here.  A gem and well worth the drive to Hendertucky.",

Committed to all things local and organic and featuring comfort dishes ranging from \"Buttermilk Fried Chicken, Short Rib Hash and the Turkey Benny. The bakery also has luscious cakes and mini desserts to sink your teeth into.  I like the stuff they carry on the menu, the Short Rib Hash caught my eye. It's braised short ribs, potatoes, roasted sweet onions and peppers with an egg on top. Simply fabulous, the meat was tender and juicy. Potatoes had a good crisp on them and the egg just held everything together.   The Red Velvet Pancakes was tasteful and pretty, with generous amount of cream cheese spread around. I finished it rather quickly, the portion I think could've been bigger. They have great desserts one in particular is the brownie cookie bar, it's so chewy and chocolaty also it's exquisite with ice cream.    The layout of the place is nice had a delightful and spacious ambiance. I came in around noon it was crowded and I still didn't have to wait to sit down. The staff does a good job providing great service, in particular Vanessa is super friendly it was her suggestion to get the chocolate bar.   Overall, this is a great replacement from the Bread & Butter cafe that used to be there.",

The food is consistently yummy and the staff is consistently courteous, even though they are busier than most eating establishments. I have to admit, I'd love to try everything on the menu, but I am always pulled back to a few items I love, and haven't managed to work my way through the entire menu yet. Plus they feature special menu items I feel like I must try before they are gone! Almost everything I've tried is a \"Must try\" in my opinion. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed. And if you're down for a really long, relaxing brunch, try the blood orange mimosa.",

    "text": "I was really excited about the opening of CRAFTkitchen! I am definitely a fan of the cute, modern decor/seating and the beautiful presentation of the food (very instagram-able!).  But unfortunately, I'm not a fan of the small portions and the high price of the dishes.  My friends and I ordered the Short Rib Hash, Beef Sliders, Truffle Fries, and Sweet Potato fries w/ Maple Bacon Aioli.   - Short Rib Hash: I actually wasn't totally in love with this dish as much as other yelpers were! There was a bit too much gravy for my liking. I really liked the tenderness of the braised short ribs though! The smashed potatoes that it came with were good as well but nothing that stands out. I also added a poached egg for $1.75.  - Grass Fed Beef Sliders: I actually preferred the Sliders over the Short Rib Hash!! The plate came with 3 sliders which had pecorino cheese, arugula pesto aioli, carmelized onion on a house-made potato roll. It was delicious!! The only complaint was that my friend ask for his sliders to be cooked medium rare but it seems like that request was ignored unfortunately since the server told us that they were \"cooked medium/medium rare anyway\". When the dishes came out, the waitress didn't know the cook of it and his sliders ended up being cooked medium instead, much to his disappointment ):   - Fries: The truffle fries were pretty good but I would say the Sweet Potato Fries definitely stands out more with the Maple Bacon Aioli sauce!! The fries + that aioli sauce were probably one of favorite things to eat.   Would I come back to CRAFTkitchen again? It's unlikely. The food was tasty but my friends weren't even full after eating their entrees and sides, despite paying a hefty bill for brunch (~$20-25 each).",

    "text": "Honestly our son came in from out of town, and he's really into eating fit and healthy.  So, we found this place on Yelp and gave them a call about making reservation, and was told that it was not busy so we decided to make the trip and give it a try.  Sure enough it wasn't real busy and we got seated right away even though it was just a little past noon.  Our server greeted us right away and got our drinks (water), and we had a feeling that the price was higher than normal but hopefully the food would be well worth the price.  Well, when our server returned we went and placed our orders.  This place looked cleaned but we were surprised that our food was taking so long as it has been well over a half hour and our server never came back to see how we were doing.    Finally after about 45 minutes someone bought out a salad and hamburger.  Unfortunately no one at our table ordered a burger so the person took it back.  After waiting another 5 minutes surprisingly our food was finally starting to come out.  There were six of us and needless to say with one child I was proud that a 5 year old was able to sit there without screaming and causing a fuss that long.  Well finally everyone got their food except for the one person whom we thought would have gotten her food first, since she only ordered the Acai Bowl.    Someone (not our server) came out to says that they had ran out of coconut, but they could roast another nut and bring it out later.  Really? Btw, during this entire time our server never once came out with any of our food, nor did we see her until everyone was nearly finished.  Only then did she start to come over to see if we needed any boxes, and she did bring us the bill.  Despite the fact that our server was not the best, and we had to wait over 45 mins after placing our order until we finally got our food I felt that maybe she had an off day or she had no control over the kitchen.  Having family member who worked in the restaurnant business I know how tuff it can be so I felt good that I was still able to leave a good tip!   Will I go back?  Not real sure that I what to spend $100 for this type of service no matter how good the food was.  And to be honest it was good, but not great!  Lastly, it was bought to my attention that the women restroom has only one stall, and needless to say when you have to go and there's only one stall, then go into the one stall that's not being used even if it's in the mens restroom!  Ouch!",

Overall, this place is pretty cute and a nice addition to Henderson. It's super hipster and the place definitely gives off a trendy-vibe. We got seated quickly, but unfortunately, we had to wait awhile to get our food. This \"long-wait\" system has happened on two separate occasions. It took us awhile to get our orders in. If they fix it, I wouldn't mind changing this to a \"five-star\" place because the food is pretty darn good!   We got the Red Velvet pancakes and the Chicken & Waffles (they call it a different name) and these were beyond delicious as entrees. I wish the fried chicken had a bit more seasoning because it tasted a bit bland, but the syrup and waffle, as well as white meat made up for it. The Red Velvet pancakes are great, but I wouldn't just order that as a meal. We ordered a plate for our party to share, which turned out pretty well. I also ordered a side of Truffle fries, which was super delicious. The fries were crispy, thin and just downright amazing.   If you're going to be drinking, I'd also reccomend the bottomless mimosas deal for $16 bucks.",

I expected there to be a wait  since it's understandable to be busy on such a day. Even so,  I am surprised at the horrendous service of our waitress.  We waited about  30min to be seated which I thought was pretty good given the family holiday. Our waitress asked us (a table of two) for our drink orders and then did the same for the table who had just been seated next to us. After we got our drinks, she came by once to refill water and after that, she did not come by our table even once.  She came by the table next to us and kept refilling their mimosas and asking if they needed more water or anything else. Still,  she didn't come and ask us if we needed anything. To make matters worse,  our food order was taken before the table next to us and they ended up getting all their food before us. Fast forward an HOUR later and we finally get our food. We were never given silverware in the hour we were sitting there so I asked the server for some silverware and hot sauce which she immediately got for us. After a while, I wanted a coffee refill but our waitress was still helping other tables except ours so my friend flagged down another waiter and asked for the refill. When my coffee refill came,  I immediately asked for the check,  drank my coffe,  paid,  and left. I still left a tip since I understand a waitress job is still hard work,  but for a waitress to help other tables and not ours for the majority of a meal is horrendous.   I had high hopes for craftkitchen but after this, I will not be dining here ever again.",

I like to look at the glass as half full so ill start with positives.  1. Service has been good. 2. Outside seating 3.healthy & unhealthy options 4. Deserts are good  now for the not so positive.  1. Serving sizes are small. 2. Food is a bit to pricey especially for the amount of food. 3. Food doesn't really come with sides. Sides are another 5 bucks or so when normal breakfast/ brunch places gave sides.   This is place is more of a cafe in my eyes. Don't come here hungry. Come here for more of a hangout during down time, its a mice spot for that. So far the food i have tried is good. However I feel like I don't really get what I pay for and leave unsatisfied.",

Croissant sandwich is delicious and their sweet potato fries are on point but if you don't care for salty too much I would definitely as them to omit it or be easy with the salt. The chorizo burrito is huge and tasty but not something I'd crave. Their minestrone soup is delicious and their salads always look amazing even though I've never had them. Red velvet pancakes with their sauce are pretty bland so those are a no go for sure. They offer mimosas and beer which is awesome for your brunch needs! They also have a protein fix option which is super delicious with their homemade turkey sausage patties egg whites spinach micro greens and tomatoes BUT I'd say their price point for breakfast in a local strip mall is a little pushing the pricey side for sure. Good food AMAZING pastries. Worth the stop for a coffee and pastry fix!",

The service from out waitress was on point, super friendly with a smile from ear to ear. We ordered smashed avocado toast, kimchee tacos, crab cake Benedict, coconut chia pudding & kids grilled cheese with truffle fries. The waitress did warn us about the avocado toast that it tends to be a lot of avocado and not enough toast so she offered to bring us more toast if we needed it (definitely recommend getting the extra toast). The kimchee tacos were delicious, not spicy or overpowering in taste. Crab cake Benedict was delicious, that was the first thing I started on so I ate the whole thing haha. The coconut chia pudding was light and perfect amount of sweetness. Although with everything we ordered we enjoyed the truffle fries the best! It came with my son's order with the grilled cheese and let me tell you they were on point!!

They also have an amazing selection of pastries including a ridiculous vegan blueberry scone that was one of the best & one of the best black & white cookies I've ever had!  The breakfast selections range from veggie toast to skillets & my favorite the breakfast burrito! The mushrooms on the veggie toast were perfect, my niece who only likes mushrooms on certain things ate them all! The breakfast burrito has an entire chili relleno in it, & you can get the soy chorizo if you don't like the pork option! It was so good I've ordered it twice already! The crab cake benedict on the weekend brunch menu was AMAZING! So fresh & perfectly seasoned, also a huge portion! The monkey bread was the best I've had in town for sure! A friend got the chorizo skillet & another the Cuban sandwich in different visits, both of them loved their food! The Cuban sandwich got a little soggy in the middle if it sits, but even than was gone! The staff is also happy to be there & on top of almost everything! We waited a bit our 1st visit, but there was an event & a photoshoot happening so it was understandable. I will drive the 25-30 mins & Wait the longer wait time on weekends for this amazing place! Can't wait to try lunch!!",

The food might be okay here but you would never know due to the extreme lack of customer service skills. Their hosts and managers (Sunday AM) have such a lack of care for the customer. I would NEVER recommend anyone come to dine here unless they completely replace their front of house staff. We made a BIRTHDAY RESERVATION for 15 PEOPLE a week ahead of time, had confirmation over the phone, and then were simply told it didn't exist when we called to amend the reservation to 12 people. \"Nicole\" the Monday manager (when the reservation was made) acted as if she didn't know the reservation existed. The Sunday manager explained that they take no reservations for Sunday and if they did they would have had our credit card info. Seems like Nicole forgot everything. After the frustration of finding out our reservation was never made official by this joke of an establishment we were told \"well you could show up and see\" with 12 people. The cop out of the front of house on this situation was complete bs. They knew that a reservation was made, most likely booked extra people, and then did not honor it. Show up and see? Lol I'll never try this place again. Hopefully the back of house finds a manager that knows how to treat guests properly and hosts that use their brains enough to remember a BIRTHDAY RESERVATION. NEVER DINE AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT. TERRIBLE SERVICE. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER COMMUNICATION SKILLS.",

I love anything red velvet and when I tried their velvet pancakes, it was heavenly!! Also to side it with the hot chocolate ( which was very rich ) , was even better.  for pricing I say isn't that bad but you get what you pay for. Overall , this is certainly not your average breakfast/ brunch place. It has a very unique and significant difference, especially the ambiance that's very earthy and subtle. I loved the succulent wall piece as well. Although one thing I could complain would be the chicken and waffles, I had it sit out a bit since my friends and I ordered quite a lot and I tasted spicy waffles instead of sweet. I noticed it was because they garnished the plate with jalapenos for the chicken. And the syrup was quite messily plated and caught on that spicy jalapeno flavor with it as well and it was really weird . But aside from that, good service, great food and will come back again.",

We had a bit of a wait, but that was fine. The place was buzzing with energy and a great vibe. When we were seated, we figured out the reason why they were so busy. The food was amazing, but our server, Erica R. was absolutely incredible. She helped us with the menu and questions. We loved the Monkey Bread and the Smoked Salmon and the Crab Benedict. Everything was perfectly prepared and we noticed other tables really enjoying their food also. We were just amazed at how Erica was flawless in her service. She was busy and had several tables, but you wouldn't have known it. She was always there, at exactly the right times. She was so kind and bubbly, it made for a lovely brunch. We will be back to enjoy the fabulous food, for sure, but it's Erica that we will truly remember. She's the real MVP. :-)",

Most restaurants don't pay attention to the quality of the ingredients, but that is what separates fair/good from excellent. You're only as good as what you start with.   This place is excellent. The pastries are excellent.   I had the butternut squash soup today and it was tasty, not too salty and flavorful. Loved the fresh sage garnish.    Need to come back here for a bottle of wine and a cheese tray!    My new neighborhood hang!  PS - service is a bit weak. The girl that's the hostess is not qualified. Come in three tables empty. Ten minutes to sit down.  It's happened on three occasions.  Management needs to train the employees better and oversee them better, too.   If you get a coffee, at a table, I bet they don't bring sugar or cream. It happens every time.   Food is great, but the more you come back, the more service warts you start to see and the more they get under your skin.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to check this place out for a while. Their dinner pics on Instagram are fantastic! However, on this visit I was enjoying their breakfast.  We were seated right away even though half our party was running a little behind which I appreciated since most places make you wait.   They have 3 flavors of mimosas. Blood Orange, Pomegranate, & ???. And, you can enjoy one for $8 or go bottomless for $16. I went with a single blood orange. It was a pretty color and I liked the glass, but I would have appreciated more orange flavor. I debated switching to the pomegranate and soldiering on, but I went the responsible route and ordered a coffee. I have to say, the coffee was a bit strong for my taste, but of you're a Starbucks fan you'll probably love it.  For entrees, I had the Breakfast Sammy which is basically a bacon, egg, & cheese croissant. My husband had the Short Rib Hash. Our friends had the Smoked Salmon Sandwich & the Carnitas Omelette.  My breakfast sandwich was a little bit small, but cooked to perfection. I prefer my bacon crispy rather than chewy which it was. The croissant was flaky and buttery. Egg was over hard. And, cheese was ooey & gooey. It came with a good sized salad topped with a few house made chips. I'd probably order it again on my next breakfast visit.  My husband loved the Short Rib Hash, but we felt like it wasn't actually a \"hash\". It was shredded meat over some smashed potatoes. Delicious, but not a hash in the traditional sense. He opted to add a poached egg on top, too.  Our friends enjoyed their selections as well!!  This place is a bright, clean, and really cute breakfast spot. However, the standout for me on this visit was our exceptional server, Jeffrey. He had at least 4 tables of 4 people and was charming and attentive to every single one of them. It was one of those flawless experiences where the server is there every time you need them, so you want for nothing and never feel neglected...and at the same time, they aren't hovering or being annoying. Every server everywhere should take a lesson!!   We split our check and the tip with our friends...and Jeffrey's service was so exceptional I asked my husband if he had any cash so we could leave him extra.  I, also, noticed the manager checking in with each table. I wish we hadn't been so into our conversation because I usually make a point of alerting management to good service experiences when they stand out, but I didn't.  This was one of the best dining experiences I have had this year! Now, more than ever, I am excited to try their dinner menu!!",

Was super on point and very nice.  The Cuban Sandwich is better than what you get in an actual Cuban restaurant around here. They make eggs in detailed and high end ways that make them \"special\". Some of the desserts are small but they are perfect! The taste is quality all the way. CraftKitchen is a fine restaurant to check out and meet with friends and family. I would give it five stars but some items are pricey. But again better ingredients so it makes sense.  Recommended!",

My daughter had red velvet pancakes and it was SO good and a big serving. My husband got the chicken and waffles. He thought it was ok, just a bit overcooked so the chicken strips were pretty dry. I ordered the Cuban sandwich and didn't enjoy it at all. Nothing like a real Cuban, which was to be expected, but their version misses the mark. We may return again to try more items on the menu, but so far half of what we've tried has been fantastic and the other half has been less than satisfactory, so we'll see.",

    "text": "I have this love/hate relationship with yelp's \"Hot and New.\" It's almost always a guaranteed fail at service, but for the most part the general feel of the restaurants offerings can be gaged. Most Hot and New restaurants are just OK. And sometimes, like today, the find is exciting and worth the prolonged wait for food & drinks!  We arrived shortly after noon for brunch. Mind you, we were all STARVING!  I was hesitant to try a new spot this morning based on how hAngry I was even before arriving!  Apple maps even took us past the address, made us make a u-turn, and landed us at NOTHING.  Something is wrong with the Apple maps idea of this address, so use Waze when venturing to this new local eatery.  If you're familiar with this side of town, it's located behind Osaka before you hit Sunridge Heights.   Upon entering, we were greeted with the comforting smell of coffee and pastries.  Yum!   They really need a hostess stand outside or closer to the door.  We weren't the only group that walked in kind of confused about whether we seat ourselves, or need to be seated. After about a minute of standing around, a nice young girl scurried over to us (I guess we really looked confused).  She offered to seat us and asked us where we would like to sit. We opted for a table outside.  The weather today is PERFECT!  She gave us menus and a kids menu for Chloe.  No crayons for the coloring kids menu tho. Maybe an oversight?   We were immediately greeted by our server, Kevin. He took our drink order, then recited the specials to us.  We asked for his personal favorites (our favorite question at a new place). He recommended the Short Ribs w/an added poached egg on top, and the smashed avocado toast. We ended up taking his recommendation on the Short Ribs w/a poached egg and got the Croissant Sammy to split.  The little one ordered the waffles & fruit off of the kids menu. To drink, waters all around, 2 coffees and a decaf mocha.   Our waters came out quick, but the coffee drinks all took a while. I think the server should have explained that their coffee is brewed per cup, therefore takes about 10 minutes to come out (probably based on other customers who probably ordered before us).  The coffee is bold, tastes like an Americano it's so strong. It also has a light foam at the top.  I definitely think they need to tell their coffee story somewhere.  If I didn't ask about the coffee after our 2nd cup came out (and took just as long as the 1st cup), we wouldn't have appreciated how good the coffee was.  A little briefing on the coffee story makes the wait worth it, and somehow even tastes better!    About 10 minutes after our server took our order, another server showed up and said \"welcome to Craft Kitchen, are you guys ready to order?\" We explained we had already ordered, and thanked him for checking on us.  A little disorganized, but that's ok. At least he was the 2nd waiter to try to take our order. Lol.   When our food finally arrived to the table, we were all so hungry, we didn't really talk much. We devoured each dish, leaving no crumbs behind.  The braised short ribs were cooked to perfection. Zero complaints.  I make a pretty good braised short rib dish and it's rare I find one that blows mine away.  However, Craft Kitchen's version kicked my little homemade version's ass.  Bravo!    The croissant Sammy was nothing to write home about, but the salad that came out with it was amazing.  It had these little potato chips on the salad that tasted homemade.  Yum!   Chloe's kids waffle meal was the perfect size. 3 small waffles served with berries & maple syrup.  Being in restaurants myself, I know how pricey maple can be, so I do recommend they pull back on the serving size of the syrup. She hardly used half of the syrup they gave her.  I cringed at the waste. Eek!   Our bill was just below $50 before tip.   A bit pricey for brunch, but honestly for the freshness of the ingredients and quality of the meal, this was expected.    As we were leaving I visited the pastry case to see what I could take home!  We got a small bag of assorted cookies ($4.95). Honestly I expected them to be better, but I'm not mad about the purchase.    After drooling over the other items in the pastry case, we decided to talk to the pastry chef Katie about ordering a pumpkin cheesecake for Thanksgiving.  She took our info down and will be contacting us later this week about our size options & pricing!  Yay!    Overall, this place WOWed me.  The service wasn't horrible, but it can definitely be improved.  None of the staff really offered info about their concept until we asked questions.  I think their pricing, wait times, and menu can be understood better with even a brief explanation of their ingredient sourcing.  It adds value to the experience.  I look forward to dining at Craft again!  I think this place can only get better if they stay True to their purpose!",

Shortly after my sister took a bite from her farmer's stack and found a long hair that was weaved through her food . As for me, I had the Turkey Benny. The meat was dry, the Hollandaise sauce was oddly sweet, and there was quite a bit of avocado sauce on there (making it overwhelming) .   Don't get me wrong, I get it ....hair happens but not when you have a restaurant.  The manager was kind  and took care of us after that but we were just over it at that point .",

A very clean, modern, hipster joint with an ever changing menu packed with yummy goodness. The first time I was in here, I just came in for a coffee but it was hard not to try something from menu. It was heartbreaking when 346 Patisserie closed and my family feared that was the end of classic French style baking in Henderson. Thankfully, this gem opens up just in time and delivers beautiful, imaginative baked goods. The Owners make themselves known in the dining room and are well trained with impressive resumes and I feel dining here you can clearly see the vision they have.   The service is exceptional. Well trained, enthusiastic staff who work the best hours on the planet (7am-3pm). I would recommend this place for a girls lunch, a decadent breakfast or impressing your out of town guests. You can bring the four legged family members for patio dining. If you do anything, try the desserts but work out at the gym an extra day to make up for it ;)",

    "text": "Had a holiday party here for lunch - I love that they have a big enclosed room with 1 large table - perfect for a little privacy (we were kinda loud!) and for groups.  Short Rib Hash - meat so tender, melt in your mouth. Smashed potatoes perfectly crisp on outside, but still fluffy inside. Massive portion for lunch.  Truffle Fries - Okay, these were the stars of the meal. I've had my share of truffle fries, always disappointed because the fries would be too oily (restaurant would drizzle with truffle oil), too salty or the restaurant would smother the truffle fries with Parmesan - which is fine, except sometimes I really want to taste the truffle....not parm. CRAFTkitchen's truffle fries are a must-try. Golden brown crisp without a hint of greasiness. Truffle flavor without being overpowering. Perfectly salted. The crispy bits at the bottom of the bowl were the best. Small portion though -- if someone asks you to share, tell 'em to get their own.   My friend had a caprese salad with more salad. She turned around to talk with another friend and I stole the rest of her salad. The greens were perfectly dressed with a homemade vinaigrette. I love when chefs dress salads lightly, so you can actually taste the baby lettuces.  Mimosas - I had 5 of them. Okay, maybe 7. But we stayed there for 3 hours.  Cookies - Even though the chef is a pastry chef, I don't recommend their cookies. I bought 6 cookies to take home - 2 gingerbread (the cookies were so hard that when you bit in, I thought the gingerbreadman was knocking my teeth out), 2 chocolate chip & 2 chocolate chocolate chip. These were rock hard as well. They tasted like last week's cookies and sounded like you were crunching on concrete. One bite of each and the rest went uneaten by my kids and husband. If those sugarholics didn't like the cookies, then they were pretty bad.   So, 5 stars to this restaurant for the food (and mimosas) and I'm going to forget the cookies ever happened.",

The waitress who's name I forget at the moment was super nice, patient, and informative. The interior was pretty and had some awesome looking decorations. The only bad drawback of this place is the way it's laid out for sound design. It's hard to talk to people while you're in there, because you can hear every conversation in the room and it's very loud. A group of young men a few tables behind me were so loud volume-wise that I was getting a headache every time they all got excited about whatever and laughed and joked.   But beyond that I'm looking forward trying everything else on the menu since so far this place is great!",

If you are within 25 or 30 miles you must visit for a snack, a meal or even a coffee. Love love love this place! JP and the rest of the servers make you feel like you are part of the family",

    "text": "With warm anticipation, a new breakfast/lunch venue has opened in South Henderson on Eastern near St Rose.  With a fair amount of neighboring competition, it seems as though the aim to differentiate is towards locally sourced, organic ingredients...important to some, if you're into that sort of thing ;)  Starting off with the Croissant Sammy: Thick Applewood Smoked Bacon, Sharp Cheddar & Over-Hard Egg. Excellent sandwich, perfectly crispy bacon on a golden buttery pastry!  This was very enjoyable, fair portioned and memorable.  Pulled Turkey Benny: Charred Tomatoes, Avocado, Poached Egg & Citrus Hollandaise. Nice presentation, could fare well with a bacon bit or added crunch for texture, piled high of turkey, with a creamy avocado.  The underlying citrus is welcomed.  Citrus & Crab: Lump Crab, Avocado Puree, Baby Lettuce, Fingerling Chips & Champagne Vinaigrette. Very good, lettuce-cup-like in presentation with a fair amount of shredded crab and citrus. A bit difficult to eat with a fork, I just ate them like lettuce cups with my hands...hope you guys don't mind, I'm not shy around the dinner table :P  And finishing off with the Sliders: Grilled Onion, Cheese, Greens on a Whole Wheat Bun. Juicy, served medium rare, yet in need of an aioli / mayo to soften the doughy/yeasty wheat breading.  I'm a bit of a burger/slider snob, but it's almost there!  I was told that a lot of the menu is going under final revisions, subject to ingredient tweaks and adjustments.  I think the direction is spot on, and would love to revisit to venture further into the diverse menu selections.  Recommended!",

Presentation of the food was phenomenal. Our party ordered a variety of things and all of the menus items looked to beautiful to eat. Also his is a great place for people with dietary restrictions like gluten free or vegan folks out there. Our waiter listened to the parties concerns and was able to make suggestions to accommodate those special dietary needs. I highly recommend! I drove across town to try them out ! It was well worth it",

Bottomless mimosas at $16 and meals under $15. Food is tasty but very neighborhood quality. For instance, they had no tobacco sauce or other hot sauce, only 'in house salsa' which they charge you for. The food otherwise was very filling but I noticed the poached egg on my Benedict was very overdone and the mimosas were very slow service-wise. We ordered a turkey Benedict and vegetarian omelet, with a side of fries. Besides my complaints, the food was fantastic and perfect for any weekend brunch or weekday breakfast/brunch. The pomegranate mimosa was actually fantastic and perfect for a leisure few hours to chill and talk in Henderson. In Yolanda our meal cost just under $70 for 2 entrees, 2 bottomless mimosas, and a side of large fries. Prices were reasonable and the fact that they had a dog friendly seating makes it worthwhile. There are better food locations in Summerlin or strip, but CraftKitchen is fantastic for a neighborhood boozy weekend brunch.",

The bad part was that we counted 9 non-kitchen staff mostly milling about, drying coffee mugs, wrapping forks and knives with napkins or just talking.  There was at least one open table and several on the patio that we asked to sit at, but were told the seating was based on servers not tables, but the staff didn't look busy at all.  Once seated the food is pretty good, and they don''t rush you, which can make it nice and we would have been happy with slow service  They need to figure out how to manage the flow better because to all those waiting with us, it wasn''t a good experience looking at anyone's face.",

I've been here enough to say that I've tried most of their dishes.  My \"go to\" order is the burrito and churro waffles...need I say more??

Although I blame it on the location, a little far from me. But I would come here a million more times if I could! They have indoor and outdoor seating but the outdoor is just kind of right in front of parking spots, I personally wouldn't sit outside. I came with a party of 4 on Saturday brunch and got seated within 15 minutes.   I was debating between the salmon benny. Or the crab benny (seasonal). Unfortunately, they ran out of crab benny so I opted for salmon. I also got the blood orange mimosa which was super tasty! I'm a huge fan of eggs benedicts, it's a dish that sets my rating for any brunch place. I must say, their salmon benny was one of the best! It was the perfect portion and I devoured that plate in 10 minutes.   I cannot wait to come back to try more. Their food was good and customer service was excellent. I highly recommend this place! I'm tempted to go again, next week.",

The waiting list create a log jam because of so many cancellations and no shows. That it sacrifices the service of those waiting to be seated. The staff has no urgency with a lack of awareness of what's going in the front of the Resturant. Tables left uncleaned with customers waiting to be seated. Once we sat down the serve took 5 mins to bring us our menus. Customers waiting with staff standing around isn't the service customers want to see. All three visits the food didn't disappoint. But the service in the beginning doesn't do the Resturant justice. I'm not sure we will come back a forth time.",

    "text": "What a lovely little lunchy brunchy spot. I had my mom in town and we wanted to grab a sweet little cafe lunch during a day full of errands. I whipped out my yelp app and based on reviews decided to choose CRAFTKitchen! I am so happy we did! We were warmly greeted, and seated promptly. The feeling of this joint is so warm and fun. Our waitress was fabulous from the moment she seated us. My mom got the French dip sandwich which came recommended to her by our server, while I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap off of the VEGAN MENU (that's right, they have a vegan menu!!!!.)  As a vegetarian/ naughty (because I don't always follow the vegan rules) vegan- I always get so excited when restaurants have options for us vegg heads! Ok ok- back to the food.   The french dip looked divine. My mom raved over and over how delicious it was. It came with a side salad that she said was equally as delicious. She mentioned that the sandwich was so fantastic by itself that she didn't even need to dip it in the gravy. I think the True game changer is that the bread used for the sandwiches is made in house.   We did order truffle fries for the table. They were okay- but I will probably sacrifice the fresh breath for garlic parm fries next time.   I got the buffalo \"chicken\" wrap off of the vegan menu. I was blown away at how great the texture was of the \"chicken.\" The wrap was delicious. It came with a buffalo sauce in the wrap that was FIREY hot! Thankfully i enjoy spice- but if you are slightly sensitive to spicy foods I would ask for it on the side. There were a few times I had to take a couple of deep breaths and a sip of water! Anyways- it was super yummy, and I can't wait to go back so I can eat it again!   We finished our lovely little lunch with a blueberry lemon scone and 2 vanilla lattes!  The coffee was delicious and the scone was absolutely heavenly.  I would recommend this spot to anyone for family brunch, dates, or just a bite to eat with your girlfriends or buddies. Overall really pleased with my experience",

Tempura style avocado, black bean puree on corn tortillas, just tasty. Organic chicken over my ceasar salad was perfectly cooked and well seasoned. A great eatery in Henderson.",

They have great imagination and creativity with their menu items.  I recommend the there pancakes which are light and fluffy.  When i was there i had the funfetti B Day Cake Pancakes which was off the charts.  My second recommendation would be the Churro Style Waffles.  These tiny waffles pack a punch with cinnamon and sugar.  I just wished there was more because they were so good!  If you are looking for a solid out of the box breakfast check out CRAFTkitchen.

I ordered a little bit of everything (off the Vegan menu of course).  They had a great variety of menu items for both Vegan and non-Vegan.   For Starters we ordered :  * Plain FF.  Well done.  And those were good.   Not too salty.  Good price.  & Skinny; how I like em!  * Vegan Chili Cheese FF.  It came w/a hefty serving of fries, & not enough chili on top + cilantro.  The ratio here was off, but also, the chili itself was a bit too dry and should've been warmer, enough to drip all the way to the bottom (in my opinion.)  Menu Items :  * Vegan Chilaquiles. These were great!  I loved that subtle hint of lime crema.  But the only down side here was that their Vegan Chicken. It had nearly no flavor at all.  I'd have preferred more char and seasoning on these for that extra $4.95.  * Vegan Farmers Market Stack. I loved this dish.  It was hard to argue with it's complexity.  It had a good texture and overall flavor.  If I had to add anything I'd recommend a sauce drizzle over the smashed potatoes.  Besides that I would definitely order again.   Dessert :  * Vegan Cinnamon Bun.  Good it was a bit naked.  It needed more cinnamon sugar between the rolls and  I would've liked icing too.   * Pineapple Pannacotta.  This was amazing!  I wouldn't change a thing.  Definitely get this one!  * Lemon Tart.  Not Vegan.  I wouldn't order this again.  It had a very strong egg flavor.  Kinda gross.  All in all I would come back. There's such a variety of menu items & I'd like to try them all!",

We even sat a while after eating, chatting and the server filed our water, checking on us even after the bill was paid. That's top notch service if you ask me. The rustic decor with abundant green (yet fake) plants was visually appealing. I would certainly recommend this others and will be back to try the lunch/ dinner or \"mid hour\" menu, as they called it.",

And oh, did I mention the parking was sooo Easy!!! Considering its on Eastern Avenue. :) You know what I mean.  We will be back for sure.",

    "text": "New bohemian chic breakfast spot CraftKitchen is a cute little restaurant in the GV/Anthem area. While the decor is nice ( muted color palate, herb garden) and food is thoughtfully presented, I was thoroughly disappointed with our experience. The $16 Short Rib Hash was literally 5 small red potatoes topped with about 4 oz of shredded beef accompanied by a few drops of braising liquid. After waiting 20 minutes for it to arrive (we were the ONLY table in the restaurant when we ordered) I was expecting it to at least be hot, but was instead merely lukewarm. It looked like an appetizer sized portion.  My 4oz pour of OJ for $3.50 seemed a bit pricey to me. My gf had the fried chicken and waffles, which again, after waiting 20 minutes you'd think would be piping hot and crispy right?  Think again. 2 soggy chicken fingers and 2 small rubbery waffles are what we got. For $43 (including tip) for breakfast for 2, I was expecting a bit more than bland, under seasoned small plates. We left hungry and disappointed.",

After our first meal, we knew we would be returning for what was almost every morning during our stay.  Our selections ranged through the CK Special, the Fresh Fruit Plate and the Greek Yogurt.  The menu had a lot more to choose from as well.  All dishes well done.   The service was spot on as my water glass was never empty.  They did an impromptu \"iced coffee\"  and they were really cool about substituting in a non-gluten item for the standard on the Greek Yogart plate.  Overall, nice place which did fill up quickly during peak times.",

It was my first visit to the restaurant, and the staff (the manager Devin, hostess Erica, and waitress Katie) went above and beyond to ensure that my experience was second to none.  And the food...life changing!!!!!!  I was struggling with what to order, as there were so many menu items that intrigued me, and Devin was flawless in his assistance of recommendations.  It was his description of the Short Rib Hash that led me to order it (\"A lot of love goes in to the preparation of the short rib for that dish\"), and I was blown away.  A lot of love indeed!!! =)   I also had the Oatmeal Brulee, and it was incredible.  The temperature was JUST RIGHT, and the nut and fruit mixture with the caramelized sugar topping was nothing short of phenomenal.  Even the coffee was amazing.  Fresh, delicious, and again, served at the perfect temperature.  I simply can't say enough good things.  I can't wait until next weekend to return and try another dish.  I will definitely be raving about this restaurant to all my friends and family.  Please don't ever leave Vegas!  Thank you for a truly incredible and unique dining experience! =)",

    "text": "First off, for people who don't worry/care about eating organic food I am sure you will be happy with the offerings here. I have been really looking forward to this place opening for quite some time now as I was under the impression that they would be serving the majority ORGANIC foods/ingredients.   I didn't really know how to grade this place based on a single visit but for people like myself that were hoping for something else, I thought this may help.  For the visit that I had today I will give a detailed review and overall impression.  First off, I used to come here when it was \"Bread and Butter\" and the entire look inside and out has been changed.  This place has a great \"feel\" and atmosphere now and I think they did a great job with that.  Service was spot on from the minute I walked in the front door where I was greeted with a friendly hello and smile.  The only negative I have to say about my encounter with several employees was that they couldn't answer questions re: organic options.  I understand that being the second day open, this isn't to be held against them as they are still learning their new jobs.  I did get different answers depending on who I spoke with but the comments to follow were based on an individual who went and spoke to the person who orders the food from the different distributors.  Upon looking at the menu and speaking with the employees, it was determined that the only thing that was ORGANIC as a whole was the coffee they serve.  This was a huge disappointment for me as we don't have a single restaurant up in the area any longer that caters to ORGANIC food now that Layers closed down a few months ago.  I ordered a salad that was tasty but very small with a few greens/apple strips/ and a small amount of quinoa.  This came with a couple of pieces of bread.  Overall, I felt the food was good but not very filling without any meat in the salad.  I walked out spending 17.00 (w/ 3.00 tip) for lunch and didn't even get anything to drink!  I feel that if you are going to charge prices like this, you should be serving organic food.  I will not be back unless it is for a cup of ORGANIC coffee or until I hear that they have decided to serve the quality of food that is in line with the prices that are being charged",

Also the fact that they offer bottomless mimosas is a huge plus considering there's nowhere else in Henderson that offers this brunch experience. Food was excellent also. Only knocking down to 3 stars due to the fact the service was pretty much nonexistent. On a busy Sunday there were only seemingly 2 waiters, so we sat at our table for about fifteen minutes before anyone even approached us for drinks/food. All of this was made worse due to the fact there were like 6 people standing around at the counter doing absolutely nothing but standing with their hands in their pockets / behind their backs chatting with each other while the two waiters managed basically everything. Definitely going to come back here because I'm sure things will smooth out, but there's for sure some work that needs to be done on making the experience more enjoyable. Sitting at a table without even getting waters for 15 minutes is kind of a joke when you're looking at a $70 bill.",

They were definitely impressed, and appreciated that the meal portions weren't overloaded. \"Perfect size so we don't overeat for the rest of the day.\" Fresh ingredients too - herbs are displayed in front of the restaurant.  I had the Chicken and What? Those waffles were so fluffy, and the breading on the chicken was light. Perfect match with a small kick from julienned Jalapenos. Didn't need the whole cup of syrup either - always a good thing if you don't need to drench food in sauces. A brunch special of that day that the boyfriend took advantage of was bottomless mimosas. Sorry, but he had to because we were living vicariously through him. One friend was pregnant and her husband was supporting her by not drinking too, and I was the hostess driving everyone around.  The one thing we were slightly disappointed in was that we never got to try the cinnamon rolls. Our waitress Teresa forgot to bring it out as a dessert when she brought back the first draft/copy of the bill, and came back 10 minutes later telling us that the kitchen had ran out. Hmm... Maybe next time.",

The salmon was Ok nothing special in my opinion. The risotto had good flavor and texture, too bad it's a special. I would probably give it another try to try some other items and their baked goods.",

We had the traditional, blood orange, and pomegranate in which all were delicious but my fav was blood orange! We also had the scallop ceviche which was on the specials menu and was fresh light and fresh just enough citrus and maybe was a pickled taro perhaps and thin tortilla strips for crunch...mm mm! I had the smoked salmon on pretzel bun and my brother had the braised short rib on hash. Smoked salmon was a nice portion was good and very nice twist on traditional bagel and lox. My bros short rib was cooked nice but was a little timid on seasoning and lacked the boldness I'm used to with a braided short rib. All in all this place was great and will be back soon cuz all I thought about when I got home was why didn't I order the red velvet pancakes!",

We were seated immediately and were pleased to learn that we could order from either the early or later menu. We enjoyed every bite of our meals: from the brulee oatmeal to the pulled turkey benedict to the beef sandwich to the amazing short-rib hash (I will be dreaming of those potatoes!), there just wasn't anything negative to say. It was all delicious, fresh, attractively presented, and \"cheffy\" but not in a pretentious way, if that makes any sense. And to think that I almost skipped having a cup of coffee: that would have been a major mistake on my part!  Our server and the counter staff were all personable and helpful. We had a delightful meal in every respect (and it was very reasonably priced for what we received).  (My single complaint has nothing to do with the food. Try as I might, I could not get comfortable on the metal chair I was seated on. Perhaps the seat itself is too deep for me; I found I could not reach the chair back without slouching, so I ended up slid forward to the edge of the seat with no back support.)  I can't believe we waited until now to try CRAFTkitchen! It's close to home and so good that we will be regulars. Highly recommended!",

    "text": "My better half found this place on Yelp and were decided to stop in for a late lunch. Their posted hours are 730a-3p and we snuck in around 240p. We were a little worried we might be rushed, or even turned away (yes, it's happened to us before at another small business which I reviewed on here). Our server (I didn't catch her name) promptly sat us and got us drinks without any rush at all. We ordered our food and with her quiche, there was a small side salad.  Now my better half is deathly allergic to vinegar, so she just put it to the side. When our server came to check on us, she asked if everything was okay with the salad, and we told her about the vinegar allergy, and apologized for not mentioning it prior. She asked if she wanted a different salad, but the quickly realized that all the dressings had vinegar in them. So she offered us not only a side of fries, but truffle fries That was very nice of her to offer. Not once throughout the meal, did we get an inkling of them wanting to rush us out. In fact, as we were finishing up, we asked for a \"to-go\" cup for her coffee and the gentleman behind the counter offered us fresh cup for the road. Wow! And he even made her a latte instead! So we paid the check and on the way out, the same gentleman behind the counter asked if he could have a minute of our time. After that, of course. I figured it was for a customer comment card or a survey. He asked if we had tried any of their fresh pastries and we nodded no (I think he noticed my better half drooling on the glass pastry display as we walked in and waited to be seated). He pulled out a brown \"to-go\" box and proceeded to explain what each pastry was as he placed them in the box. About half a dozen pastries later, he closed the box, pushed it across the counter and said, \"I hope you enjoy them!\" He introduced himself as Devin and wished us a great rest of our day. A great meal AND some great desserts?!? Double wow! There are lots of great places to eat in this fantastic city of ours. Some have great dishes that you may or may not remember, but I think you ALWAYS remember that great feeling of when a business makes you feel WANTED and APPRECIATED. And yesterday afternoon, CRAFTkitchen did both. Thank you again guys! We will absolutely be back.  -- Matt & Lex",

A variety of delicious gluten-free options..the apple tart is exceptional. Pastry items cost anywhere from $2-$5.  Shortrib hash is the menu's home run item. Breakfast/brunch for two will run about $30-$40. Servings are not huge but very filling and high quality. Nice atmosphere and decor. Especially liked the counter seating looking out a large glass window.  Super busy on the weekends. If possible, enjoy CRAFTkitchen on a weekday for the best in service/experience.",

    "text": "Wifey and I ate here on a cold (outside and in the restaurant too) Friday morning in Jan. I had the CK-Breakfast Burrito ($13.75), she had the Protein Fix plate ($12.25), and we added the Sweet Potato Curry (cup) Soup ($4.95). Overpriced was my feeling about it all. We had water, not even coffee and the total was $33.50!   Bad ratio of food ingredients in my burrito-- potatoes vs the chile relleno was 9:1 (no exaggeration) which makes it hella carbs to be made full-from potatoes and not the taste and flavor of chile; not on the menu as it is advertised/ described. Menu says it's \"stuffed\" w. chile relleno.  You judge for yourself, but if your not in the mood to be disappointed.... go somewhere else with your appetite.  Cold in there too. Walked by the thermostat on the way to the restroom and saw it SET at 66 degrees in the restaurant ....in January? That's how they roll in there. My guess is-to get you to order hot coffee.  No manager type person visible in there either...you know, someone who looked like they were in charge (not while we were there), to ask if they \"..noticed everybody eating in there was wearing their coats & hats because of the chill\" and I thought I saw a lady wearing her gloves in there too! Don't think I'll be back too soon. Too much hype. I've seen a lot better ...for what this place was advertised as. This place is for people who are ok with paying for someone to cut their avocado, plate it next to a fried egg and charge you over $12.  Little to none in pastries and treats on display at the counter too.  On the good side...it's decorated modern and clean. Good space to eat in (elbow room). Parking was decent for a Friday brunch. And the host and server were nice.",

Items ordered:  1) red velvet pancakes (sadly, my 5-year-old hoarded then so I didn't get to try...but they looked excellent  2) butternut squash hash: the kale was so good but hardly any in there. The squash was super good and good amount. The potatoes were tasty but way too many for me. I would've reversed order of how much per item but overall, it was super tasty and I'd go back just for this dish and ask them to hold the potatoes if possible (haha I'm weird cuz \"hash\" I assume is the potato part)  3) something about protein? I forget the name. This was hubby's dish and he tore it up. I was going to get it, but honestly portion size looked pretty small on it so I'm glad I didn't.   4) monkey bread. Hot damn. Super crisp too and caramel buttery soft goodness underneath. Perfect! And I'm a pastry chef so I'd know (don't you hate when people say that?!

First of all the owners must be very greedy because they obviously don't have enough staff(properly trained) to handle the volume. And also, the portions are very small for the price. It's a trendy spot and I see a bunch of teenagers/college students there all the time but aside from a social hangout, this place does not have any substance.  Ordered chicken and waffles and got two small chicken strips and a soggy waffle. Waitress got the order wrong the first time and brought me out something that looked like shredded turkey with white sauce all over it. Looked gross but was probably better than what I actually ordered.  Like I said, I don't get it. Place sucks overall.",

The apple cobbler with vanilla ice cream seemed the most appetizing, but the service took too long so we didn't order it. They also have various baked goods and desserts near the front register, but again they are on the pricer side.

First of all, we were sat but no one took our drink order (and I needed a cup of coffee!)  We waited about 10 minutes before we met our waiter.  I ordered the Salmon Benny and my husband ordered the Craft Benedict.  While we were waiting, I saw a delicious looking Blueberry/Orange Scone at another table.  I ordered one for our table but it never arrived.  Our benedicts arrived without Hollandaise Sauce???  Oversight, no biggie. These items are served alone with ANY side or garnish.  When the Hollandaise sauce came to our table, I put my finger in it to check the temperature and it was super cold!  Our waiter took it back. BWe ordered 2 more cups of coffee and only one came,  By the time the next 2 ramekins of hollandaise came out, our benedicts were cold - as was the hollandaise (again!!!)  By this time, we just wanted to leave.  A young girl, not our food server, brought our bill and apologized for the hollandaise issue.  She asked if we had everything we needed  I told her about the scone we never received and she gave me one for free.  My husband noticed a female's name under server.  Our server was male.  Instead of saying anything, we just paid the bill cause we wanted out of there ASAP!   Very disappointing experience.",

    "text": "I have dined 2 times at Craft Kitchen and have been blown away each time! For my most recent visit I arrived at about 9:45am and sat at the bar. I ordered black coffee and a water. The crustless GF quiche on 1/10/16 was mushrooms, shallots, and parm; so that was definitely being ordered! I also ordered the sweet potato fries with maple bacon aioli.   My coffee came quick and fresh. I am an ex-barista(not sbux) I appreciate a good crema, the picture doesn't give my coffee justice. When it was placed it front of me I thought they brought the wrong coffee. It looked as if it had milk, my tired eyes adjusted to see this beautiful crema. The coffee was hot, but sippable. Super smooth!  QOTD was served with its usual mixed green salad that had a great vinegar punch to pair well with the decadent, fluffy, pot of love. Typically the crust is 50% of the reason I'll eat a quiche. Craft Kitchen doesn't let me miss it. The egg is this beautiful light texture, the Parmesan adds just the perfect amount of richness and nuttiness.   The sweet potato fries were good. Perfectly seasoned and fried crisp. I think I might have been served a regular garlic aioli because I'm not sure I tasted any bacon or maple. Not sure I would order these again.   On my previous I had the Burrata salad and it was creamy, fresh, and bright! I was thinking it would be sweeter, however, the dressing was a great tangy vinaigrette. I've also tried their creamy asparagus soup and the croque monsieur   Now. The sweets!!! I've tried the pecan sticky bun, kouign amann, and raspberry lemonade panna cotta. All of which were AWESOME! The panna cotta had this great candied lemon wheel on top, the light lemon and vanilla bean cut through the sweet and acidic punch of the raspberry sauce on bottom perfectly!! Warm that sticky bun up!!!!! It is SINFUL! Yum!   I love Craft Kitchen. Their fresh ingredients and heart they put into the whole concept is obvious! Bravo!",

    "text": "Invited to try some new menu items by chef/owner Jaret Blinn, four of us came here for brunch at 1 PM on 26 December.  Seated in the private (semi-private) room, we started with appetizer pastries (that's what I'll call them).  They ranged from sticky buns, to cinnamon buns, scones, and croissants among others.  Each one was absolutely wonderful.  Chef Blinn shows his skill with these pastries.    Following this, we had our savory dishes which included shrimp and grits, Citrus and crab salad, Ciabatta Caprese, crustless quiche of the day, short rib fries, Croque monsieur panini, and chorizo Shepherd's pie.  I didn't get a chance to try the citrus and crab salad but everything else was outstanding.  I enjoyed the panini and the Ciabatta Caprese as well as the quiche.  Everything is thought out so well and they're very good dishes.  After the main dishes, it was time for more pastries that I'll refer to as dessert pastries.  These included mango sticky rice, S'mores waffles, a chocolate sticky bun, and a duo of bread pudding and sticky toffee pudding.  Service was excellent with new share plates and silverware for each course without needing to ask.  Refills of my iced tea were frequent and again with no need to ask.  Chef Blinn's desire to turn out quality pastries and savory dishes is evident in everything I tried.  He's a very dedicated man who makes his food with quality ingredients and has a menu that is very diverse such that anyone coming here can find many things to like.  You're not going away disappointed.  It's a shame it's a 20 minute drive from home to get here or I'd be buying pastries more than I do now.  Getting some of these pastries in the future will be worth the trip!",

What's real and what's fake?    The design reflects on the freshness of their menu.  It's healthy without being overly dietary.  There's a comfort in knowing they choose their ingredients, for example in their house made sausages.    Croissant Sammy. Read the ingredients and knew immediately it was just my taste.  Requested soft cooked bacon, which was done perfectly.  I ordered a side of their bacon aioli which paired well with my sandwich.  The side salad was beautifully garnished with small potato chips. By the flavor of it, I believe they fried it themselves.   Their potatoes are nicely cooked and different then I've had before.  Small in size and flattens skins on, creates cracks.  When fried has a nice crispy outside and soft center.  Cafe mocha; froth, coffee, chocolate was well proportioned. The perfect hint of sweet, no sugar needed. Really enjoyed my meal.   On top of all that, all the staff were friendly and their good mood contagious.  Came in contact with atleast five of them, everyone was great!   Thanks so much, will be back!",

They had open tables and when my friend was only asking why the 20 minute wait if tables are open and people are waiting ? They replied it is due to kitchen staffing being unable to serve that many tables ! What ?! Then get more kitchen workers duuuhh! They are in a busy area ! The manager decided to come over to me and my friend and tell her \" bitchy  snarky nice \" they are doing the best the can but the wait and open tables was due to kitchen issues and then went on to say how my friends husband was not welcome there ! He wasn't even with us?! My friend and her husband frequent this place on weekend brunch bc they live close by and the food was good and staffing but recently the staffing had gotten worse and good workers were leaving . When my friend asked why are bringing that up the manger states \" just so you know for next time ! What ?????? I was absolutely appalled and flabbergasted by the rudeness of their manager ! That how you treat customers ! Forget NEVER GOING THERE and neither should you !!! They think their sh* t don't stink !!!! SO RUDE! I will Make sure to let everyone I know about this !",

    "text": "I love that Vegas is starting to get more and more local places to eat. It's a great option over going to a casino or to the strip.   I thought this place was so cute! I came here recently with my uncle for breakfast. I love that they use local ingredients and are a farm to table restaurant.   They have outside seating but since it was winter it was too cold to sit here. We arrived just in time before a large crowd came in so we were able to get a table relatively quickly. If you do not feel like waiting a long time for a table on the weekend I would suggest getting there at 11am or before. This place gets popular after that!  I decided to order the avocado toast. This comes with an egg on the top and pesto. I really enjoyed this and felt proud for eating healthy since the other things I tried weren't as healthy.   We also tried their pecan sticky bun. It was so good! I wish we would have had them warm it up, I bet that would have tasted amazing.   I also ordered their hot chocolate that came with a marshmallow that was dipped in chocolate and peppermint. It was so rich I had to add a little water to it but it was very good. Dipping in the marshmallow was my favorite part and was glad it was included with the drink.  Lastly, we took a cupcake home with us. Since it was Christmas time it was a red velvet cupcake with frosting that was made to look like a reindeer. It was so cute and part of the reason why I purchased it. I really enjoyed it and was a good take home treat.   The prices here are a little higher since they are dealing with local ingredients but I do not mind paying extra for quality food.    I would love to try their lunch here next time!",

Our server repeated back the order and it still came out wrong; they forgot to bring us our muffin, so it was suppose to be on the house. When we got the check they hadn't taken anything off for the inconvenience as promised. The sever took way too long to get back to our table in order to tell him about the mistake in price. We left exact change and left. So unfortunate about their customer service because their menu is awesome and I would love to try more things on it, maybe with a different server next time.",

I love spots that are comfortable and pleasant to look at - for me it adds to the overall experience.  Highly recommend everything we ordered - truffle fries, short rib hash and smoked salmon. The short rib was tender, flavorful and not too fatty. I liked the added touch of roasted/baked (?) capers on the smoked salmon - paired with the cream cheese, tomato, onion and pretzel bun, it made for a perfect combination. None of the flavors were too overpowering, as this dish can sometimes be. We finished with a huge chocolate chip cookie (which they warmed up for us so it was gooey and delightful)...the cap to a wonderful meal.  Can't wait to go back. The only downside to this place is it's not closer to my house!",

Both dining spaces are inviting and I'm a fan of their use of decorations of succulents, grass, herbs, and wood top tables...it gives this place a farm to table vibe! Which is what they aspire to do.   Food:  I personally ordered the Pulled Turkey Benny which was delicious. Turkey was moist and seasoned nicely, perfectly poached eggs, and the hollandaise sauce served on the side was honestly the best I ever had, with heavenly notes of lemon but still very balanced...gonna have to try to imitate that recipe!  Also had the house made gravlax...the fried capers were such a nice touch! It was tasty. We also got to try the hummus and focaccia, which was really good too!   All my friends ordered various items on the menu and no one was disappointed. 3 of us got their coffee and one friend ordered their bottomless mimosa, which tasted great. We had one kid with us and she loved her waffles!!!  Very kid friendly place. All of us will be back.",

The service was incredible, the food was divine, and the ambiance was trendy and relaxing.  My friend and I started with pomegranate mimosas in these cute modern cups. We shared the truffle profiterole with black truffles and risotto.  Wow it was light, creamy, and amazing truffle goodness. We then tried the smoked salmon on a pretzel roll with capers and tomatoes. It was plated so well. The cream cheese was a piece of heaven with the soft pretzel bread and the tender fresh lox.  We then tried the blueberry lemon crepes with a blueberry sauce. The crepes were light and the lemon zest with the warm blueberries and whipped cream was just right. Then we had the ciabatta caprese which was plated very playfully. It had rich burrata cheese, basil tomatoes, and sweet balsamic. You get to put the topping on the ciabatta yourself which was fun.   Then for dessert we had the smore tart and peach/apricot pop tart. The marshmallow topping was so smooth. They both were delicious! I couldn't believe the fresh peaches and apricots in the middle of the pop tart. What a wonderful brunch!",

Our server, JP, took our food and drink orders and we didn't see him again until he brought out the check. He didn't check on us one time throughout the entire meal...no coffee refill (he did refill my water once right before handing us the check so I'll give him that) nor at any time did he ask how the food was or see if we needed anything additional. I even had to go to the hostess stand myself to get an additional set of silverware. I would go again, but I'd make sure I had a different server.  Now the food...pretty darn good! Presentation and flavor was definitely worth it. Wish the service had matched the quality of the food.",

What do you expect when they're being served in 4oz glasses?    We had to wait 20-25 minutes before the server had to tell us just a bit longer on the \"giant\" biscuit after I flagged her down to question why the 4 tables who walked in after us were getting their food before us.  Chicken and waffles are 5/5 most of the time, but my last time here, my chicken and waffles were cold; I think it was because it was made but was sitting under the burner for the biscuit to be made.   The turkey meatball on the protein omelette was a little dry, and the omelette itself was warm instead of hot.   The coffee is good!  And the crab salad on their lunch menu is superb.",

The decor is very inviting and spacious.  The outside seating looked very nice but we opted to sit inside.  The menu is very eclectic and you can get breakfast or lunch items all day.  The thing is - everything is pretty pricey.  Red velvet pancakes were tasty but not worth the $10.75.  Chocolate milk for the kids was $2.75 for a glass - no refills.  They offer a carafe for $5, but it turns out that a carafe only has one and a quarter glasses of milk.  Not at all worth it - in fact it seems kinda like a ripoff.  The sliders were somewhat greasy and nothing very special.  The chicken and waffles were pretty good.  Service was okay.  We had to wait for a while for our food and the table next to us received their food first even though they sat down and ordered after us.  We had to keep flagging servers down for drink refills and for the check.  One server kept saying weird things.  When bringing some more syrup, she said \"that's my workout for the day\" and then \"just kidding\".  The bill for 4 of us including tip was over $80.  I hope they re-evaluate their pricing and work on the service professionalism.  We'd really like to have another nice locals place to eat.",

I've been here twice, once was with my family and they loved everything they ordered.   We ordered Salmon Benny, Veg omelette  Avocado toast & Berry pancakes. Every single item was amazing & indulgent, even though some of their serving sizes isn't as big, it makes you content by the end of your meal!   Second time I was here I went with a few friends. The wait was 45 mins, but we decided to stick it out since we were already there. We ended up only waiting about 20-30 since we think people decided to drop their spots. It was definitely brunch hour around 1245. My friend and I decided to order the seasonal crab cakes because we were stuck with avocado toast and the egg, but wanted more protein. It was the best thing I've tried at CRAFTkitchen and so amazed by the concoction of flavors, it was a party in my mouth. Haha   Definitely will be a returning customer bringing brunchers to table!",

The place is open and has more of an industrial look to it. The front bar serves a variety of coffees and has a Showcase for their oh-so-pretty pastries and jams. If that doesn't get you excited when you first walk into a breakfast house than I just don't know!!   The item for the morning was their crustless mushroom quiche. When our server (I forgot her name) described it, it sounded amazing. So naturally without reading through the rest of the menu I took the servers recommendation and gave it a try. Let me tell you, I was BEYOND far from disappointed. The buttery, rich, savory, earthy flavors and textures that came with that dish was delicious. It was served with a little salad on the side. I know what your thinking, salad for breakfast? Yes, the salad added that balance of texture and flavor. Almost like a palate cleanser that allowed every bite even more amazing! Seriously I'm in love with my breakfast this morning! And when we found out that they make their jams homemade every morning and have a different flavor every day. We of course had to have a side of toast and jam! The toast wasn't your typical toast, it was toasted baguette and served with their mixed wil berry jam! It was fresh, sweet and nothing short of amazing!!   I'm highly impressed with this place I wish I would have found it sooner!! This is definitely in my top recommendations!!",

We forgotten more than once, so much that even after we got our food I had to ask for utensils again. It seemed they were on it with everyone else so I don't know why they dropped the ball with us. Our drinks came after two other couples that sat after us, our server asked only once if we needed anything and she was walking so quickly that with food in my mouth I couldn't answer. And yes I needed something, a napkin. I did enjoy the food, but I was irritated at their service that I didn't enjoy the meal as I would have in other places. Probably only will return if my daughter drags me again. Not worth the hype, you can get same food same price elsewhere. Close by too. Lots of places to go Eastern, good luck if you go though.",

With indoor and outdoor seating the minute you set foot inside you can just smell the fresh brewed coffee. I'm in love with this place already.  I tried the Italian Melt sandwich on this visit, mixed meats between a soft bread. It's has to be up there with one of the Best sandwich melts I've eaten in a long time. The salad that comes with the dish had their special dressing, a peach vinaigrette, light wonderful flavor. Couldn't eat a sammie without an order of Truffle Fries, Yum!   Simply love the vibe of the eatery, very clean and it has a healthy feel to it. There are some Gluten free choices,but I love that they serve filtered water along with filtered ice, now that's how you do it right!  Jenna our waitress should get 5 Stars alone, she's energetic, friendly and \"Absolutely\" fantastic! Make sure you catch her here on Wednesday and Thursdays, the two days she works.

Eating standing up next to the order counter and eventually walking out realizing they would not going to seat me without asking my name!!!!!??????  My juice had no ginger no cucumber and 3/4 of a cup filled i was wondering since ditched the ingredients why at least fill up my cup. meanwhile the entire time i was there no one none of the millennials asked me if im doing ok? ! maybe instead of high tech the owner should teach the young staff compassion, caring, and how to go to extra mile for customers. perhaps teach how to write down a person's name and when its time read it out loud.",

Truly a great place to  eat, we've been there often and have always enjoyed the food and service.  The last visit was for a private dinner event when Chefs Tami and Jaret outdid themselves, blowing away all the guests with their innovative dishes made especially for the party.  They cater events like this at the restaurant for dinners, so keep them in mind if you are ever in need of a site for your own function.  My favorite menu item is the Short Rib Hash with smashed potatoes, sweet onions, and peppers, with the Shrimp and Cheesy Grits a close second.  For the bakery items, hands down the monkey bread if you want to go to carb heaven, but all the items in the cases are inviting. Weekend brunch from 9am to 3pm has an ever-changing menu so you never know what new items will appear.  If you haven't been, drop by when you're in the area and see for yourselves what's cooking in the kitchen of CRAFT.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying this review is based solely on service, not food. I like to be completely fair in my judgement of a restaurant so I'll start off with the good  The bottomless mimosas are relatively fairly priced and they give you an assortment of juice options to choose from. The food is always hot and delicious. The menu does change, so you can't always order your favorite thing, but I have always liked everything I have tried. The burrito is one of my absolute favorites as it has an authentic taste. The pop tart is amazing, and the ham and cheddar kouigh amann (or however you spell it) is the best thing I've ever had in my whole life.   But there's a reason I won't be coming back, ever. Not even that cheesy croissant is amazing enough for me to ignore the laughable service again.   You're busy, and I get it! That's what happens when you have delicious food. I'm not a high maintenance diner. I actually like to be left alone most of the time.   But on my last visit, I was left alone basically the whole time.   We started off by ordering water. JUST water. Shouldn't take too long to get back to us, especially bc for some reason, craft wasn't busy. When she finally comes back, we order our food and I'm not confident that she will get my order correctly bc she's not writing anything down. And I know! Some servers are simply on it, and don't need to. But that isn't the experience I've had with craft.   And of course, I'm correct. She comes back later to ask me to repeat my order. And I do, no worries. We all have bad days right?   So our food comes out and of course, I'm missing the side of avocado that I ordered. And since my waitress doesn't come to check on us, I eat through half of my burrito before I get a chance to tell her. Kinda defeats the purpose of getting avocado in the first place.   My companion ordered an americano, and she needed a cup of ice. Just a cup of ice. We asked our server but of course, the ice never made an appearance. My friend got so tired of waiting, she poured her americano into her ice water. Literally ridiculous.   But oh wait! We haven't gotten to the worst part yet.   The bill comes and we ask to split it by items. We didn't order a lot and we tell her what goes with which card. Our cards are red and yellow so no chance you could mix those up. But somehow she does! If you weren't sure which card was for which order, why not ask? You're lucky I'm not poor craft, and you're luck the price difference didn't make or break me. But imagine if my bill had been higher? When you're messing with someone's money you have a big problem. And that day, you messed with my food AND my money.   I want to support you craft, but I can't. The people who work for you are visibly miserable and not attentive. Not to mention I overheard one of your servers trash talking her recent table because they apologized for not being able to tip.   Don't come here. The food is great, but there's a lot of other great places for brunch that have bomb service. Try echo and rig perhaps. But stay far away from here.",

I had the seasonal lemon blueberry mascarpone pancakes and the short rib hash - the latter seems to be one of their most popular items. The waiter immediately exclaimed it as his favorite. Oddly enough the short rib hash, at $15.95, does not come topped with an egg as one would expect. The egg is a $1.50 upcharge.   I love short rib and was excited to try this dish, however the short rib was gamey and not very flavorful. It's also worth noting the portion of meat only seemed to be around 3 oz. The smashed potatoes - although abundant - were very underwhelming and under-seasoned, if at all. I will say that the egg, which I paid a premium for, was cage free and perfectly cooked to the over-medium doneness I requested.   As for the lemon blueberry mascarpone pancakes - they too were very disappointing - perhaps even more so than the short rib hash. These pancakes were neither lemony (at all) nor did they have any creamy texture or taste from the mascarpone. In fact they were dry and seemed to be regular subpar pancakes topped with blueberries and blueberry syrup.   None of the four people I dined with were impressed by their food, aside from a vegan blueberry and blood orange scone that was great. The service was friendly and relatively attentive, however there's nothing that would bring me back here.",

The egg was perfectly poached, which is almost a miracle because It's difficult to get a perfectly cooked egg outside of scrambled at even some of the better breakfast restaurants, much less a perfectly poached one. The flavor was hearty and on point, tasty without being over seasoned, allowing the natural flavors of the ingredients stand on their own. The restaurant is a bit on the small side and we came at a peak time, so we did have about a 20 minute wait to be seated but all things considered, that wasn't very long at all.

They don't have a call ahead system and the waiting area is micro sized, so you're stuck either waiting outside or in your car for a good 30-60 minutes sometimes for their weekend brunch. For the third time now, they were out of gluten-free waffle mix by 11AM, which is basically the only GF brunch option aside from eggs. Obviously it's a big seller so I don't understand why they don't stock up on it!   Aside from those snafus, their food is incredible and the bottomless mimosas are amazing. It's definitely my favorite brunch spot, but I wish they'd work out these kinks!",

Food: CRAFT uses fresh ingredients to offer small bites and full meals to fit anyone's palette. I love their smashed avocado toast the best and salads! Sometimes their menu changes, so it keeps things fresh! I've even come here for Mother's day and had a completely different menu offered with bottomless mimosas! There's fresh cookies and pastries in the front and options to grab and go if you're in a hurry!  Drinks: Whether you want fresh juice or a nice glass of wine, CRAFT has the best selection for you. If you're into the cafe feel and want coffee or tea, they make it fresh and on the spot!   Service: Everyone at CRAFT is welcoming and friendly! You don't even feel like you're hiding in a shopping plaza in the suburbs of Henderson!   It's a great place to meet up with a friend or have a date night/day! Check them out for sure!",

Vivid green scenery all around and the plants on the wall gives the place a refreshing twist. The restaurant is clean and I liked the way the booths are adorned and intimate.   2. Food: Three words: Churro Style Waffles-- UH MAY ZING! The perfect combination of the crumbled sugar in conjunction with the taste of an delicate and precise waffle/churro phenomena. CRAFT kitchen is what Henderson really needed. Let's begin with the vast menu choices from sweet and savory eats to the perfect healthy plates that are simply palatable. I've been here three times already and I have to say the Short Rib Hash is one of my favorites on the menu. The beef is juicy and blends well with the seasoned potatoes. I definitely enjoyed sipping their a Chai Tea Latte as it starts the taste buds before the food arrives.   3. Service: Although it's always busy, the wait is not long and the staff is always friendly and complementing. They have always asked me the preference of my seating and are always attentive right away. I've never had an issue with their service.   4. Overall Experience: I say they get an A for encompassing 1,2 and 3 -- which is what makes a \"good restaurant\" be GREAT... with a GREAT experience every single time. Keep up the good work and hope to see you soon!",

I ordered the Craft Benedict, which has a citrus hollandaise sauce. I was excited because I make my own with lemon juice. This one was clearly closer to orange and made it so flavorful. Also got the Portuguese sausage as a side.  Here is the most agonizing part of the visit. The Benedict came out with just that, no extra side. I was hoping for has browns or something, man! So since I was still Hu gry, this gave me the opportunity to order a pastry. So this is why they don't give you potatoes here!!! I got a home made peach pop tart, also yum yum yum!  I can't wait to come back and try more stuff.",

    "text": "I ordered the stuffed french toast, & in the past it used to be much better. It appears the filling & technique in the kitchen has changed :( I was not so impressed with this latest recipe. The french toast is served with real whipped cream, fresh sliced strawberries & real maple syrup. The egg dishes are much better, accompanied by their tasty salads & amazing coffee(I don't know what they do to this coffee-just a reason to come here!). Anyway, I come here regularly with my teens & they enjoy it. Pastries & cookies are really good.",

    "text": "Really good food, served quickly and without fuss. I felt the prices were a bit on the steeper side for locale, atmosphere, and level of service, but definitely not enough to be a deterrent from coming back!   The service is great, but it's casual dining, and I feel most of the menu items didn't reflect that in their pricing.   The monkey bread is incredible! A perfect balance of crispy, gooey, caramely, doughy indulgence you expect monkey bread to be! (Priced appropriately-don't skip it!)   For our entrees, we had an \"all American\" and the chilequiles with carnitas added (served vegetarian on the menu and any meat available can be added). I personally can't comment on the flavors/textures of the \"All American\" style breakfast, because I was so consumed with my wonderful chilequiles! The egg was cooked exactly as requested (a big deal for me) and the sauce was well spiced but not overwhelming.   They also have an impressive bakery case and coffee bar for bites on the go (or to take home).   All and all, the homemade pride shines bright and we would definitely return.",

The staff greeted us immediately and were friendly and prompt with seating us. The place was busy! Always a good sign that our meal is going to be good.   They're only open for breakfast and lunch but serve breakfast all day (until they close at 3PM)- dare I say..this may be my new brunch spot!?   They have vegan and gluten free items and healthy/guilty pleasure items- something for everyone! They also make their pastries in house daily and serve espresso and fresh juices.   I tried the fried avocado tacos (Vegan) and it came with 3 and was a perfect little lunch! I'm giving it 4 stars because the service was just okay- we had to ask for water after our meal as we never got any. My coffee was also so-so but they did fix it for me when I asked them to.",

The wait time was about 20 minutes since it was a little busy on a Saturday Morning but they did get us in as fast as possible and all the employees were super friendly and smiling.  The menu was super healthy and they also have a separate vegan menu. I got the avocado tacos and they were amazing! By far the best avocado tacos I've had in a while. They were super light and filling. Everything on the menu was affordable, which was a plus. And the wait time for the food was quick. Would go again for a nice breakfast/brunch spot!",

We got seated it took about 20 minutes to get our food, felt like a while but I was super hungry. Wanted something salty and sweet so we settled for the chorizo skillet omelet and the creme brulee French toast. The chorizo skillet was really good. It had smashed potatoes on the bottom, cheese, pico, sour cream, and I got it with avacado. I give it a 7.5/10. Was impressed overall. But the creme brulee French toast blew it away for me. It wasn't soggy the cream filling was yummy, it had a good bread to cream ratio. And it had whip creme and strawberries on the top. And it was crusted on the bottom of the bread with sugar and cinnamon. My taste buds exploded. 10/10. I wanna come back to try other things. From what I hear their weekend menu changes every week. I like the environment overall and it's super chill. Hopefully we get our food a little faster next time though.",

I had left my credit card there, probably because of the effects of their bottomless mimosas.  It took me a week to notice it was gone and went to see where I used it last.  Called on Monday closed to their closing time and said I would come by the next day.  Got there only to be informed that the manager had already torn up card.  Supposedly it was his policy after a week..  no attempt to contact me.  I needed to use that exact card to validate a purchase now I can't until the credit card company reissues me a card.  Not the biggest deal but I can't understand the policy and still see it as a reflection of their service.",

I liked the name and it reminded me of a name of a restaurant that I would find in Seattle or Los Angeles, so I was like \"Yes! Let's do it.\"  We arrived at about 9:15 a.m. today(Saturday) and were sat immediately(it got packed shortly after we arrived) in a cute two seater booth by the window. The decor is really cute and rustic. They have succulent wall gardens and a succulent plant on the tables. I find this type of decor simple yet charming.   We were brought waters and menus right away and given some time to look over the menu. I decided on the smoked salmon on pretzel roll with a latte and my friend ordered the mashed avocado toast with an espresso. We split an order of smashed potatoes with bacon aioli. Everything was really good. They gave me a lot of smoked salmon in a gorgeous presentation on a soft pretzel roll with cream cheese, tomatoes, onions, and fried capers. Amazing. The latte was definitely one of the best ones I have ever had and they gave me a small slice of biscotti with it, which I thought was a genius touch. Smashed potatoes were perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the interior. The star was the bacon aioli, though. So good. Life changing. My friend said her mashed avocado toast with poached egg was good, though I didn't try it. Looked really tasty.   Service was phenomenal. We had Jeffrey as our waiter and I thought he was fantastic, attentive, friendly, and charismatic. Really love getting great service my first time somewhere. It sets the bar.   Will definitely be back for more yummy breakfast and lunch options. I saw a table splitting the monkey bread, so I must return for that.  5 star experience, friends.",

This is the third time I've been here, first time was good and it wasn't a busy day, second time on a Sunday was horrible and they gave us the wrong sandwich and we didn't want to wait the 40 minutes for another.

    "text": "Came here for brunch on a nice quaint Sunday afternoon. CRAFTkitchen has been on my \"to try\", but because it is so far (deep in the heart of Henderson), I haven't had the chance to until I was on this side of town.  And WHOA was I blown away. I had the most satisfying, most delicious, most drool-worthy meal ever. And this was before I started feeling tipsy from the mimosas! Our server (sorry, I forgot his name) was also amazingly sweet and personable. I wish I could give you a Yelp shoutout, but I went over a month ago and his name escapes me now.  Anyway, onto the important part: FOOD!  I think they have a special brunch menu every Sat & Sun. Not sure, but I the korean-styled short ribs with eggs & rice (see picture). It's a little pricey compared to the rest of the menu but it was the most perfectly portioned, delicious piece of yum I've had in a while! I ate it all feeling perfectly satisfied (not too full, but no longer hungry).   Unfortunately by the time we tried to order the monkey bread, that was out as well. We were told by the server that the banana bread is always the first to go. He suggested for us to try the bread pudding with vanilla ice cream (or was it gelato? Can't remember TBH) and it was deliciousssss! I think the monkey bread might've hit the sweet spot a little harder, but the bread pudding w/ vanilla gelato/ice cream still put the icing on that Sunday brunch.   So basically...tl;dr, arrive very early or no monkey bread.",

At the front counter they have all the desserts latex out for your viewing pleasure. It's a giant tease, but it works. I thought about the lemon tart the entire time I was eating.   Our waiter was super friendly and helped us out. He explained things to us and offered suggestions. They have a unique system here! They change their brunch menu on the weekends and serve totally different items. So if you're looking on yelp at the food photos and it says BRUNCH , chances are it's only served on the weekend. Anywho! I got the cheesy grits and chicken situation. Every spoon full of grits felt like it was filled with succulent cheese and spices. It was pretty awesome. The wife ordered the chorizo scramble and of course I took a small taste.... another fantastic dish.   The portion sizes seemed a bit petit, however EVERY single bite is packed with flavor that literally sends your taste buds into convulsions. ( ok that was a little dramatic, BUT it really is tasty. Like super tasty) We eat got a mirmosa , one pomegranate and one blood orange. Both were good to go. Sadly I was fulfilled I failed to try the lemon tart. That just means that I'll have to return.",

    "text": "Ok, here's the deal. We've been here twice so far and I would actually give this place 4 1/2 stars if Yelp allowed that.   It's a casual, high end breakfast/lunch place.   Pros - owner and concept. A slightly limited but really good menu ( kids too) with great quality and great execution, as I said high end. The space and design are a plus, although the front window seatings are a bit uncomfortable.  The  pastries, coffee , food are excellent.  Cons- prices. This is the sole reason why I didn't give 5 stars. A bit of a mixed bag here. I expect to pay a bit more for great food done right, but the prices border on expensive. It makes coming here weekly or even a few times a month a bit of a stretch for a couple or family. A lot of reviewers have posted the menu, so you can see for yourself. Portions are adequate but definitely not large, you're paying for quality, not quantity. If you come here really hungry, it's going to cost you. Often you have to add to your already pricy entree choice, then a pastry/dessert so  it adds up quickly . All of this shouldn't be a big deterrent, but you should know what you're getting into  and I did say the food is excellent.  The staff is fine, very friendly. We've experienced a small learning curve too, but come on, they just opened and I'm sure they will develop a good flow sooner than later. Got to talk to the owner and his approach is what's going to make this work. He is obviously well trained, very knowledgable and experienced. He seems open/ committed to adapting his place to make this a success. I also hope a few of the prices are reviewed/ adjusted or some cheaper items are added.   I look forward to this place being around for a long time and would like to come here more often.",

Nice and creamy and strong just how we like it! We can't wait to go back and try more! Very happy!",

I spent the morning with two of my friends here one Saturday, and I ordered the smashed avocado toast while my friends ordered the croque monsieur, the pumpkin brulee, and the ciabatta caprese.   We mostly enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant. It was unlike any other restaurant we had ever been to. I loved the rustic and fresh look of the wood and the succulant plants. It brought a well first impression of what else was to come.  The food was spectacular. I overall enjoyed the presentation of my avocado toast, and judging by my friends' expressions, they loved theirs as well. As for taste, it was as good as the presentation. The sunflower seed pesto really paired well with the creamy avocado spread, and the bread was perfectly toasted. It was also filling, so the price was worth it.  I would definitely come back here again to try something on the sweeter side. The pastries featured in the display looked amazing. It's nice to know that the owner appreciates fresh ingredients. I'm very impressed overall.",

    "text": "I am always amazed when I find really good places that are way off The Strip. CRAFTkitchen is one of those places. I was bowling at the South Point last Saturday and we weren't really feeling the buffet or coffee shop there. Naturally, I looked at yelp and it led me to the light. Usually, my wife is the one finding places to eat so color me impressed with myself. lol  CRAFTkitchen is located in a strip mall in Henderson. In many ways, it is in a very unassuming location. Specifically, it is on the corner of Eastern and Sunridge Heights. Not far from South Point at all. It seems to me this is more of a local place, which is a good thing. We arrived about 9ish and were seated right away. The decor is very bright and industrial at the same time.   In looking at the menu, my wife and I had so many choices to make. I would have ordered one of everything on the menu, but that would have just been down right unreasonable. Besides, I am not Gordon Ramsey and this was no Kitchen Nightmare. lol First off, you got to have the coffee. It was so good. To me, it had kind of a smokey after taste to it that I liked. There are two menus. One is the regular dailey menu. The other is a brunch menu. We did not take a look at the brunch menu. After much salivating, my wife and I narrowed our decision down to two items.  I ordered the Chorizo Scramble Skillet. It was a beautiful symphony of cage free scrambled eggs with chorizo, onions and cheddar cheese, spiced smashed potatoes, and micro cilantro. I was offered the option of adding avocado so I did. When one is offered avocado, one must have it. I asked myself, self, what are smashed potatoes? They were the potatoe skins fried nice and crisp. The flavor profile of the whole dish was over the top in my eyes. My wife had Croissant Sammy. It was another beautifully put together dish consisting of house made croissant(I will get into that in a few.), thick apple wood smoked bacon, sharp cheddar, over hard egg, and tender greens. Now normally, a breakfast sandwich is a breakfast sandwich, but not in this case. According to my better half, the house made croissant made the dish. So much so, she bought 3 others to take to our family. I have to say that they were amazing. I have had some pretty good croissants in my day, but these were the incredible. The service was good, so I have no issues to report on that end. Parking is ample, since it is a strip mall. CRAFTkitchen is open from 7a.m to 3p.m. Saturday and Sunday, and from 7:30a.m. to 3p.m. Monday thru Friday. When we left about an hour or so later, the crowd got bigger and there were people waiting so you might want to get there early if you don't want to wait.",

The decor and design was very clean, and had a crisp fresh appeal with flowers located on tables and the walls had various earthy art pieces. The booths were separated by wooden walls that went to the ceiling so overall the ambience was perfect to try the bottomless mimosas and have a light brunch! I ordered crab cake Benedict that I was honestly disappointed in. The crab cake itself was watery and the hollandaise was chunky and it started to separate. So for me, the food was not where it should have been, but the mimosas were great! We tried all four flavors which were orange, mango, pomegranate, and blood orange. So I highly recommend this place for the reasonable priced bottomless mimosas. We also had the mango panna cotta which was fabulous! It had a good amount of mango, citrus flavor followed by the creamy goodness of the vanilla bean panna cotta! Make sure you check this place out for brunch as I am willing to try again, I just hope the food doesn't disappoint next time!",

Inside it's quirky and modern all in one.  The food has high quality ingredients with a farm to table feel.  The short rib hash is so satisfying, and I recommend you get the poached egg on top.  They cooked mine perfectly.  Their small pies in a cup give me deep joy, not to sweet or artificial, just the rift balance of texture. As far as quantity goes main entrees are not a giant plate of just carbs and fat like many breakfast/ brunch restaurants, it's thoughtfully presented, and just enough where you have room for something sweet afterwards    Just today I was craving their pies like crazy and I got the time wrong, and they were closing.  They were so accomidating, and insisted I come in.  They had put all their stock away and found the two pies I wanted and rang me up.  Such wonderful service and those two pies came to under 5 dollars.  Check them out if you want a fun fresh take on breakfast/brunch, I'm so happy we finally have something like this on our side of town.",

    "text": "In a sea of shopping centers, an eatery like CRAFTkitchen is the pure definition of hidden gem. If you happen to be way out there in Henderson and craving a non-diner experience, this is your place!  Though the wait on a Saturday is longer than one might expect in the 'burbs, it's a nice place to enjoy brunch. Family friendly for sure, since old people and kids alike enjoy a midday meal. The queue is truly \"first come, first serve\" so larger parties could wait longer than most. I'd say stick with groups of four or less if you want to get a table in 30 minutes or less.  Those imbibing in an adult beverage can have a single mimosa, or for a better deal, go bottomless. It's $8 for one drink, $16 for endless refills.   Croque Monsieur panini with truffle fries was exactly what I wanted at noon on a Saturday. Other people in our group tasted the short rib hash (with an egg on top), avocado toast and smoked salmon. Portions were just enough, nothing too gut-busting, nor was I left hungry at the end of the meal.   Henderson keeps getting cooler and cooler, CRAFTkitchen is one reason why.",

    "text": "*Military Discount*   Went on Saturday 2-13-16 at 11am. This restaurant is located on Eastern between Sundridge Heights and W Horizon Ridge.  Ah, yes, way up in white people land....Anthem...home of range rovers and trendy haircuts for your dog.  $41.46 got us a croissant sammy, a waffle for my boy, a latte, some sliders, some sweet potato fries, and a carrot bar.  We only came here because there was an hour wait at Kitchen Table which is just down the road.   $10.75 Croissant Sammy has thick apple wood smoked bacon, sharp cheddar, over hard egg, and tender greens.  Lemme just say this...I do not like fried eggs and I don't particularly care for bacon but this sammy was delicious.  The bacon was thick and salty, the egg was rich and creamy, the croissant was flaky and hot, and the small salad that came with it was perfect for breaking up the richness of the sandwich.  I loved every bite.  My favorite part was probably the itsy bitsy teensy-weensie potato chips on top of the salad.  It's little surprises like that that take this place from 4 to 5 stars IMO.    $14.95 grass fed beef sliders have truffled peccorino cheese, caramelized onion, arugula pesto aoli, and microgreens on a house-made potato roll.  The flavor on these things is out-of-this-world tasty.  Slightly sweet, beefy, tender, and perfect with their soft little potato rolls.  Plus, I'll eat anything with microgreens on it cuz' they are fancy *pinkies up*.  The sweet potato fries were average but the maple bacon aoli is creamy and tangy and wonderful.    $3.95 carrot bar is....OMG.....so delicious!  Dense, spicy carrot cake is topped with the most creamy, decadent cream cheese frosting, a tasty brittle of some sort, and white chocolate \"leaves\".  Definitely one of the best desserts I've ever tried.  Their case full of pastries is absolutely stunning and they all look amazing.    The best part about this place is the incredibly attentive service.  The moment we were done with the carrot bar our entrees came out.  The moment we were done with the entrees the plates were cleared and the check brought.  I'll be coming back here, mark my words.",

Both items were bomb.  The Chile Relleno chorizo burrito was delicious. The Chile was not spicy at all, although I prefer spicy, it was still good. The tomatillo green salsa which came with it complimented the burrito well.  The churro waffles were also very tasty, but be warned, they were a bit sweet (at least for me they were, the wifey said they were fine). Covered in a rich creamy caramel sauce these churro waffles were amazing.  The little ones ordered pancakes. One ordered red velvet and the other chocolate chip. I tried them both and they were both pretty good.  We will be retiring here again before we leave Las Vegas.",

Very very good vibes. I also really appreciate their extensive vegan menu. I'm no longer vegan, but I enjoy having the options, and I did, in fact, order off of the vegan menu. The prices are all reasonable and comparable to most breakfast places. I ordered the crispy avocado tacos off of the vegan breakfast menu, and holy cow-- they were AMAZING! I wanted to order a pastry and coffee to go, but I was too stuffed. Guess I'll just have to come back (shucks! ;-))! Very happy to have come by here-- such a great experience!",

    "text": "So I know I am in the minority here with this restaurant and although I like to visit someplace a few times before making a review I have to give my 2 cents on this one.   We came last Sunday around 1pm thinking the breakfast rush would be cleared out a bit but we waited 45 minutes to be seated. In their defense it was cold out and no one wanted to sit on the patio so it made an already small restaurant seem minuscule. The cute old lady waiting next to me said it best...\"these guys didn't dream big enough\" I would have to agree, the place is pretty small. Everyone was huddled together in front of the cashier/coffee bar/bakery area and unfortunately to the restaurants misfortune we all had nothing better to do than stare at every table to the left and to the right. Anxiously watching as tables were finishing their food and as the bussers tried doing there jobs in synchronicity with the hostess. Maybe I am being a little harsh here but although the hostess was the sweetest gal ever she seemed to not delegate as fast or firm as she should because we watched over and over how the staff made things longer for the people waiting.   The food...  Short Rib Hash Well lets just say when I first saw a picture of the Short Rib Hash on Yelp I got all giddy inside. On the drive over I was thinking about how I would have to contain myself so I don't just scarf this down in 2 minutes. I'm sorry to report that I was underwhelmed. When you tell me I am getting a Short Rib Hash I instinctually think that I will be getting chunks of short ribs that have been braised on their bone until they fall off then chopped down into some other ingredients to form a hash. What I received was almost like Pulled Beef in a sauce. Weird. It wasn't bad, just wasn't anything I was expecting. I think a more fitting name would be Pulled Beef Hash. Also the flavor profile surprised me, it was a cross between pot roast meets braised short ribs. I decided to add an egg because well duh its breakfast and that really helped the dish for me. It was a perfectly poached egg.   Red Velvet Pancakes Well that too was a small let down. The actual pancakes are perfectly round and expertly cooked and the flavor was de-lish but why such a little amount of sauce? I mean I was choking them down. Its not good thing to have to take a sip of water after each bite. I will order this again one day and just ask if they can please be a little more generous with the sauce. Also, somehow I missed the part where they say they shave white chocolate on it? And I mean ALOT of white chocolate. Usually non disclosed white chocolate is a bonus but since it lacked sauce it just created the most intense pancake eating session ever. Roof of the mouth sticking good I guess you could call it.   The Smashed Potatoes I love what they are doing with their potatoes. I am so darn tired of those nasty diced potatoes breakfast places serve and the same goes for hash browns. Thank you for making me like breakfast potatoes again!  CK Special My poor finance isn't too happy with me when I mess with breakfast, he's a simple man. Wants a simple breakfast. The CK Special did deliver him their version of a simple breakfast and he was pleased. We especially liked how thoughtful of a touch it is to have homemade Turkey Sausage. What a treat! Very tasty and something they should tout more because it was very good.   Lattes  I am a coffee queen and shoutout to the barista for my excellent latte!   Overall I was somewhat pleased with my experience but I didn't leave feeling blown away as some other reviewers have seemed to express.",

And we were there before 9:30 just 2 of us. They could have easily accommodated us. I have eaten here several times and was always satisfied with the service however I will not be going back. I'll take my local business elsewhere.",

When will I have chicken and waffles? And every time I go they always are top notch. I love how the flavors of sweet, savory, and spicy just intermingle so nicely.",

I ordered the Croissant Sammy and i got my daughter the chocolate chip Pancakes. I wish the croissant sammy had more than just two pieces of bacon and an egg, especially if I am paying about $11 for it. So personally for me it was a little pricey BUT was made worth it because of our server JEFFREE. He was very attentive and made us feel very welcome.",
