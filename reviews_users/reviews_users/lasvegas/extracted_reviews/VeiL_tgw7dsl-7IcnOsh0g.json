I love the booth because they have the black cover when you sit in the booth. Our servers were very nice and attentive. I ordered the chirashi for lunch and my friend ordered sushi lunch. Both very delicious!!!!! I love this place definitely recommend and will come back. I checked here in Yelp and had a surprise for free dessert. Of course I got the tempura fried ice cream and it was on fire which was cool. I took care of my server and tip them well for a fabulous job. Definitely will come back",

Wife got the Dinner Bento with beef negimaki, another great option. They don't skimp either, all the portions were bigger than expected.   We also ordered two rolls which were delicious and enormous. For the price of a standard roll elsewhere in town you get what is easily twice the amount. In the end it was almost too much for just three people...  Dinner came with a great miso soup and side salad with a very nice ginger dressing. Service was great, highly attentive. Try the shishito pepper appetizer, they are roasted and seasoned to perfection.",

Toro tuna belly was neutral in flavor, it was like eating plastic. No flavor at all. Tako Octopus was super chewy and difficult to eat without almost choking and no flavor. Maybe the items coming in on the airplane from overseas are being stressed from the flight? The fish on the rolls are tiny tiny tiny, almost a non event to eat the rolls, since they are tiny and flavorless. There wasn't even one item that had that special something that makes it memorable. Spider roll had some kind of veggies in it that took away from the soft shell crab and even that ingredient was mushy and flavorless. What is going on here? Expensive and tastless, I guess some love it here, but it was a total miss in my eyes. Great decor and service and bland food, the food is what makes me come back and I won't. Seriously, I was shocked how disappointing it was.",

    "text": "IRASSHAIMASE without an accent?! Okay, already feeling a 5/5 star restaurant here....  Let's get straight to the point, Sushi Hiro has Japanese sushi chefs behind the counter and even Japanese waitresses. The sushi chefs are a pair of brothers that own a sushi shop in the main plaza of Little Tokyo in LA. After talking to them, they promised me that they serve the freshest quality of fish in LV :)  They don't have AYCE and their a la carte nigiri prices are pretty pricey, so I suggest ordering off their lunch specials menu. They have a dinner specials menu, but it is the same as the lunch menu, but more expensive (by about $3-5).  We ordered the obento boxes (chicken katsu, salmon). The chicken katsu was pretty bad, extremely rubbery and I wouldn't order it again (3/5 stars based on just that). The salmon was a lot better. The portion size is huge, you get a choice between tempura and california roll, with gyoza, egg roll, salad, miso soup. If you're new to Japanese food, I suggest starting here. However, it was more for the portion than the taste.  Where they really shine is their chirashi and sushi plate. The sushi plate was very filling and the quality of fish was pretty good. Ask what they're including on the sushi plate before you order! Even better, sit at the sushi counter and make friends with the chefs, get the real Japanese experience! The chirashi is HUGE. SO filling and SO much fish. I'm amazed by the portion size and the quality every time I go (Yeah, I've been here a lot)  !~",

I tend to stay away from AYCE, well because if you're a True sushi eater, you know AYCE really can't cater to high standards because they can't use top notch fish, and well they have to make money too. So, that's why I went to Sushi Hiro. I went multiple times before writing my review, so at least, I can make a fair judgement call. First, the sushi is great, no doubt about it. And their omokase option is also great. I couldn't give it 5 stars because well, personally, their sushi rice wasn't too flavorful. It tasted a bit more on the bland side. However, with that said, Sushi Hiro is on my regular list of go to places for sushi. I still really enjoyed it, and I still can safely say, I highly recommend this place.",

It's a bit more upscale and pricier for an off the strip sushi spot, but has on the strip quality. Their nigiri portions are massive and are paired with their special fermented/aged soy sauce. They have some unique items that basic sushi places don't carry such as fish belly and collar which I both highly recommend. I got the chu toro and yellowtail belly which both melt in your mouth. Staff is very friendly and walked me through the menu as I had never been there. Will be coming back!",

The booth is pretty and its like your own private area kinda(they cover the booth with curtains). When you sit, they give you a warm hot towl for your hands and they give you the menu. They have a lot to chose from but i'll always get the rolls. The sushi plate my sister ordered was good! You can taste the freshness of the seafood. The only thing about the sushi, they put wasabi on the seafood and the rice so that it wont fall apart so heads up to those who don't like//want wasabi on their sushi. Theyre Japan Series Roll is amazing!! In the chicken teriyaki beno box they give alot because it also comes with house salad and miso so you'll get pretty full. Tip: ALWAYS order a side of eel sauce whem you order any of the rolls that have eel in it. Itll taste so much better. What I do like about this place is that all theyre seafood is fresh so you can actually taste it. The only thing, when my sister got the Fatty Tuna sushi from the fresh seafood sushi menu it has that oil after taste and when you bite into the middle, theres something in there thats spicy and its not wasabi thats the only thing. Overall, I love this place. It's pretty far from the strip, its more in the subburbs area so expect a pretty far drive like around 10-15min drive i think.",

We ordered a lot and it was expensive, but this has to be the best sushi in the neighborhood. The ingredients are better so it tastes better. The next morning my wife had the leftovers for breakfast and it was still in good condition. It was worth the money. Don't think I can imagine eating anyone else's sushi anymore.",

Surprised my husband suggested we try this new restaurant since he is very leery about eating sushi anywhere other than by the beach. We were greeted with a Japanese welcome by the entire staff when we walked in the door. We decided to sit at the bar for the \"sushi bar\" experience. We would have been happy at any other seat in the restaurant. The atmosphere was bright, clean and modern. Every dish we ordered was delicious: several sushi varieties, sticky rice, fried calamari, soup, gyoza, and lots of saki. Their sushi presentation is A+++. I would definitely recommend Sushi Hiro to anyone. Another indication of a good restaurant is the restroom - which was clean and modern. As we left, we were sent off with a Japanese goodbye from all the staff.",

The staff that hosted us were attentive and kind, and did a great job making sure that my boyfriend and I were comfortable when we ate here. Unfortunately, I have to say that dining here was one of the worst sushi experiences I have had since I moved to Henderson. I do see that there are several wonderful reviews, so please don't let this review deter from you trying Sushi Hiro! However, my boyfriend ordered the Tour of Tokyo, and I ordered the 007 roll. Both rolls were tasty, but under-seasoned, and left much to be desired (especially since we were both craving sushi that night!) Our dinner was palliated by the amazing azuki mochi ice cream (red bean) which was smooth and perfectly sweet. But, it was made way worse when a few drunk restaurant attendees came out of the restaurant and kept standing in the path of our vehicle as we tried to leave (even after we asked them kindly to move)! They were clearly severely inebriated and I think that more attention should've been paid to them by their waiter/waitress in the restaurant (it's a safety thing, really!) In summary, we found that our service was wonderful, but I don't think we'll be back.",

I mean Sushi Hiro sounds so similar to Sushi Jiro, but they did have 400+ yelp review. OMG..it is so worth it!!!   First off, there are 2 japanese chefs and 4 assistants for an entire restaurant of perhaps 30 settings all cooking in front of you.  So, makes us wonder what are they prepping here.   The buttery Toro from Spain, kumamoto oysters drizzled in ponzi sauce, delicate uni roll, thick cuts of flavorful tuna and salo, ..and the baby yellow fin that was just sublime. I wish I can bring them back to Houston.  We will be back tomorrow for sure and every time we come back to Vegas.   But most important, thank you for this wonderful meal because we will be reminiscing and comparing all other sushi dinners to Sushi Hiro for years to come.",

So I had to wait for them to remake everything that I had ordered 30 minutes before. The sushi was good and fresh, but nothing outstanding or memorable.

The menu is large and has a variety of choices from bento boxes, sashimi, rolls, sushi, curry and ramen.   We ended up going with omakase for two. The service and quality were outstanding and the price was fair. I ended up dining for several hours since there was so much food and had great conversation with the owners wife. Chef Hiro is not new to this industry - he's been in the business for over twenty five years and had a restaurant on the east coast and in little Tokyo in Los Angeles that's still operating.  I wish the best for the Hiro's new Japanese restaurant and would definitely recommend them for authentic quality Japanese food.",

The focus and spotlight is on the sushi chefs and it is enjoyable to observe them.   Upon entering and exiting, the entire staff greets every guest with a shouted welcoming in Japanese and/or English. From the second you walk in, it feels like home here and there is a relaxed environment. There isn't anything I don't recommend here but the dishes that stood out were the toro and crispy rice special, spicy scallop, and the takoyaki. The toro belly melts in your mouth and it is complemented by the crispy rice patty it sits upon. The spicy scallop is remarkably fresh and the takoyaki is decadent. The chefs here REALLY know how to cut and select fish. The service is impeccable and fast! They make you feel like they are serving you in their home. A definite return visit is in the near future!!",

Reminds me of Yummy Grill and Sushi off Lake Mead, but nicer.  I ordered a bottle of sake, and it came with an ice bucket to keep it cold. That's pretty cool. The menu has a wide variety of dishes, sushi, sashimi, bento boxes, etc. Ordered a rainbow roll, beef negi wegi, and one of the specials for the day, albacore tataki. All were presented nicely, tasted fresh and delicious. Very happy with the quality of the food here.  What really made it great was the service. We were frequently checked up on, empty plates taken away quickly, sake glass filled, my friends coke filled, and waters topped off at least 3-4 times.   Its not a huge place, I think I counted 4 booths, and about 6 tables as well as the sushi counter. It was pretty full except for the counter when we dined here on a Wednesday evening 6pm. Well worth a visit, come check it out!!",

I was a little apprehensive when I pulled up since it is in a strip mall, but after walking in and seeing the gigantic pieces of fresh fish in the open kitchen, my anxiety about dining here subsided.   Tuna, Salmon, and Yellowtail Nigiri were bar none. The Plum Tree Roll, Crazy Tuna Roll, and Volcano Roll were the perfect combination of spice and fresh fish. Service was great and you could see the chef's putting the rolls together. Awesome experience!",

It's located between taco y taco and smash burger and their parking is a bit tiny but it seems like people always come n go.   The staff is so polite and welcoming as you enter, it's not a big restaurant. It has a L shaped sushi bar, 2 or 3 tables, and a few private booths. I love the decor as well.   Food...most important part of a review.....best fresh sushi everrrrrrrrr! The quality is just over the top, and the amount they give is so much for such a reasonable price. This place has sushi as well as kitchen prepared foods if you don't like raw food. The menu is limited but I honestly prefer that so they really perfect their selection. If you're one of those who likes rolls, and sauces and deep fried this and that...this is not the place for you. This is real sushi which is just really good rice and fresh fish. They even graid the wasabi right in front of you. No frills no gimmicks, just beautiful traditional Japanese cuisine",

Grab boba tea at Brew Tea bar nearby afterwards - probably the best boba outside of Taiwan in the US that I've tried so far. Can't go wrong with either.",

Same goes for the rolls on the menu... there's a boatload to choose from, which a lot of times indicates Americanized, avg level sushi... Nope... not at all.  We had a table, but if u peeked over the chef counter you'd see all sorts of authentic, super fresh stuff.  Clams, Live shrimp... we also got the yellowtail jaw, which was super generous.  The menu, when u dig in, has very legit high quality fish options.   I'd say, go all in on it.  We wish we had ordered more.    Very good, friendly service.  Priced very generously for the quality of sushi.  And i hate generalizing this, but the sushi chef was straight japanese.  Not Korean, or any other ethnicity.  And how cool was it that he was taking shots of sake w his customers.  Entertainment value of watching this is worth at least 1 star.    Nonetheless, very high grade sushi at a very, very reasonable price.  Clean restaurant with very friendly service.",

Everything was excellent.  I especially liked that the roll had a very good ratio of rice on it.  Too many places put too much rice and Hiro's had just the right amount on their roll and nigiri.  Service was very good as many people touched our table to make sure we were doing ok on our ordering.  Their chicken katsu was fried and breaded lightly just like it's supposed to be done.  Nice execution Hiro!",

And this review is strictly for delivery. (Can't wait to actually dine in ). Prices are well worth the quality.  We ordered  garlic edamame- sweet and delicious with the perfect kick of garlic. Pork gyoza- very flavorful and hot Seaweed salad-fresh and amazing 4 different sushi rolls- all delicious... Can't recall the names except the 007 roll.  Long and satisfying story short, this place is great. I would recommend to anyone.    It can be pretty sketchy to order delivery,  especially from a Japanese / sushi spot. Food is packaged well and flavor was most definitely on point. Thank you to all at\" Sushi Hiro \".",

    "text": "This review would have 5 stars if it were only for the food. We can only give 3 and would even lower it for the several issues and observances at the sushi bar during our meal. Please read to the end.  First, the good: The fish is amazing. Fresh and portions are very generous. The presentation is very pretty. We had kanpachi (amberjack yellowtail) sashimi and sushi, umi masu (ocean trout) sashimi and sushi, uni, salmon and tuna sushi and a rock and roll.  The bad: We sat down at the sushi bar around 5:15 on a Tuesday.  There were only 4 people at the sushi bar and one party in a booth. The 2 waitresses were very disorganized and hurried.  We were not recognized at the bar for a while then our drink orders were taken. After waiting longer the sous chef finally came to take our order. I knew what I wanted but my husband did not so I ordered sashimi kanpachi, uni masu, salmon and tuna.  The sous chef milled around, obviously not making food, and finally the sushi chef asked him what our order was and began making it. It was obvious that he had forgotten because I received only kanpachi and uni masu. At this point a waitress came to take my husband's order. He ordered sushi kanpachi, uni masu, uni and a rock and roll. We were presented with 2 orders (4 pieces of each) of tuna and salmon sushi that we neither ordered that much of or prepared that way. My husband finally got his food after much confusion and miscommunication between the waitresses and chef with near arguments in front of us and a \"we'll talk about this later\" from the chef to the waitress. We for sure double checked our bill and found we were charged 3 times for one thing that we only ordered 1 of and 3 times for another item we ordered 2 of.   The worst: Sitting at the sushi bar allows customers to view the chefs making food. It's fun and I enjoy it. This time it was very obvious that extremely dirty towels were being used to wipe the food prep, knives, and hands. At one point, the sous chef was chopping salmon with one of the dirty rags about 3 inches from the fish. He wipes a hand on the towel, continues to chop fish using both hands to mix. A piece of the salmon dropped ON the dirty towel and he picked it up and put it back in the mixture. Sushi Hiro has a unique item on the menu, Wagyu carpaccio.  We did not order it but saw it prepared for others. One order sat on the sushi bar, ready to go out, for about 10 minutes before the waitress finally picked it up.   This experience is very disheartening.  I guess had I not seen the dirty towels I would not have known but nonetheless, I did see them and the manner in which they are used. It's very hard to find a really good sushi restaurant in Henderson and I wish all the negatives would not have happened because the food was so delicious with generous portions and so fresh and that in itself is hard to find. Can I go back without worrying about contamination?  EDIT 6/1/18: I had reported this to the health department and I looked today to see that a routine inspection happened on 4/23/18, 6 days after my complaint to SNHD.  I see they got their grade lowered to a B and had 20 demerits on routine inspections.",

You definitely get a bang for your buck here. Portions are a lot bigger than any other sushi place in Vegas. Ordered Takoyaki and it was ooyey gooey and just MELTED in your mouth. The Katsu Curry is very delicious too! The staff is super informative and friendly. Gosh I can't give this place enough praise. Got yourself a new regular here",

I'll start with two negatives so you can read them and forget them - there is no all you can eat, and the prices are a bit prohibitive from eating there every night (it's a travesty - trust me).  NOW ON TO THE GOOD STUFF! The restaurant is cozy but laid out well - there are booths which actually offer slight privacy with tasteful curtains and then you have general table seating as well as front-row seats at the bar. The staff is very engaging and accommodating - many members of the team take the time to check in regarding drinks or clearing the table for you so you never have to worry about being unnoticed.   The sushi chefs are especially talented at making some AMAZING rolls and adding their flare with some outstanding specialty rolls. While I can't consume shellfish, I still enjoy most everything on the menu because they are more than happy to accommodate a substitution and ensure zero cross contamination (seeing as I haven't visited the hospital yet - don't worry, yelp review once I do).   One of my favorites is the out of control roll - just like everything else on the menu, it's a well sized portion which leaves you full yet ready for another.   This is a must see!",

    "text": "Wow, HUGE disappointment!  Placed an on-line take-out order yesterday evening  via Eat24 app, to be picked-up about 40 min later at 9PM.  I ordered Curry Rice with Tofu ($11.95) & Teriyaki Don, also with Tofo ($11.95).  Picked-up my order at 9:02PM, and the first thing I noticed was that the take-out bag didn't seem to be as hot as it should be -- I suspect they made my order closer to 8:20PM when I placed it, versus waiting a while, knowing that I specified a 9PM pick-up time.   During my brief encounter (my order was pre-paid) with them during pickup, the staff was friendly.  Second issue: Most Asian food places give you steamed rice in a separate \"to go\" container, so if for example, you order a curry dish, you get the curry item in a pint or quart container, and then you get steamed rice in a separate container, making for a total of two pints of food.   Sushi Hiro doesn't, and that means you're paying a pretty high price for about half the quantity of food you get at most other Asian take-out places.     I learned the hard-way this was the case with both items I ordered.  Third issue: The Curry Rice with Tofu was extremely bland.  I'm well-aware that tofu itself has no flavor, but I'm also well-aware that any decent curry *does* have both 'heat' & flavor. The curry from Sushi Hiro simply didn't.  Their menu did not give any options for curry spiciness.    Fourth issue:  I saved the Teriyaki Don with Tofu item to eat today, and just did.  Same issue covered in #2, *and* because the steamed rice was mixed-in with the Teriyaki Don, in the 20 hours between when it was cooked & when I ate it, the teriyaki sauce had been completely absorbed by the rice, thus the tofu and other ingredients didn't really have any of the Teriyaki flavor.    On top of that, the teriyaki flavor was minimal, so this dish also tasted very bland, just like my other entree from them!    I've got zero reason to ever go back there (other than to ask for a refund), and even writing this negative --but completely honest-- review of the place is taking up more of my time than they deserve.",

Both rolls were totally flavourless...   I tried again and got something totally out of my norm, the out of control roll, it was actually really good but it was super Americanized and I don't usually like that stuff, so I was shocked at how much I liked it!  Last time I went, I got a spider roll, salmon roe nigiri, and a spicy yellowtail roll. The soft shell crab in the spider roll was so dry and yet soggy at the same time?

I ordered my food take out and when I got home I saw the difference in size and I was absolutely amazed at how much these two rolls came out to. $15,14 for rolls and I get this it's ridiculous. I don't mind paying the price for good sushi, but when I get played this bad I'm not okay with it. I've gone to multiple places where the price matches the quality and quantity. Definitely dissatisfied and disappointed. I thought it would be great, but another one to the books. Don't recommend.",

I had the sashimi lunch and the fish selection was delicious and fresh. I love uni and had to order two orders of them. It was so fresh and sweet. From the specials menu we ordered the o-toro (bluefin fatty tuna belly) and the mirugai (geoduck). The bluefin was melt in your mouth delicious. The geoduck had a nice crunchy, chewy taste. It was something different. The only critique I could make was that the fish was cut so large. It was a two biter. I rather have it cut into smaller pieces so it's not overwhelming. This place is not cheap so of course they want to give you your money's worth, but cut it smaller and have more pieces than? I love this place and will be back.  We tried to stop in on a Monday and they were closed! FYI",

Service was excellent and they went out of their way to make us feel like we've been coming for years.  The sushi quality is exceptional.  We started with a couple of oyster shooters with the quail eggs, and they were extremely well balanced.  Next up came the yellowtail jalapeno, and it was beautifully presented.  We also had a caterpillar roll that was fantastic, and finally, a couple pieces of the nigiri toro.  That absolutely stole the show, it was some of the best toro I've ever had!   Great restaurant that focuses on quality.  If you're looking for AYCE this isn't your place but is definitely a contender for the best quality sushi in Henderson.",

There were even beef and chicken dishes for my husband which puts it even higher on the list!   I had to try the O-Toro special of the day, and I can honestly say I've never had fresher fish of any kind in my life!  While the price was a little higher, you definitely get when you pay for!

As you walk in, you'll notice the gigantic lantern decor in the ceiling.  The place is bright, clean, and new.  Very welcoming feel.    I sat at the sushi bar, where Hiro, the Owner of the place, was the sushi chef.  It's always nice to see the Owner working behind the counter.  You can really tell he is really proud of the place, and I agree he should be.  Hiro seems like a hard working, humble, and very personable guy.      Pretty much all specialty sushi rolls have photos, which is a great idea!  Saves me time on imagining what sushi looks like as I'm reading through the description, when I can just look at the photo and say yep....that's what I want!!    I decided to try their sushi (nigiri) lunch special.  Comes with miso soup and salad.    Sushi came with 8 assorted fish of the Chef's choosing, but I requested one of the pieces to be the super white tuna.  Sushi came with pieces of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, red snapper, halibut, shrimb, albacore, and the super white tuna.  Each piece came included some wasabi in between the rice and the fish, which gave some kick to it.  I think more sushi places should include a piece of wasabi in their nigiri sushis.    If you check in on Yelp, you get free dessert.  I'm glad I tried the green tea tempura ice cream.  They pour bacardi on it in front of you and light it on fire.  Quite the presentation, and the flavor was amaze balls.        I will be coming back Hiro!",

Only things you are better than this place is the size of the restaurant and you make brown rice sushi. Everything else, this place was waaaay above you. The freshness, the quality, the service, the portion, the price... EVERYTHING!!!   Ankimo... Steamed monk fish liver with ponzu. Amazing. Just amazing. Just like I had in Japan. Not smelly or fishy at all. My ultimate favorite.  Shishito... You could share this dish with 5 people. $5.95. Really?! They are too generous on the portion size. Seriously, they can cut the portion size in half and it would be still good. I'm a big eater and I couldn't finish it.  Ika shoga... Broiled squid with sweet ginger sauce. Tender. Flavorful. Perfect. Not salty at all like other places that serve this dish.   Chirashi... Like everyone on Yelp said. The best of the best sashimi pieces you can have in town. Thick, fresh , quality fish. The best raw fish I've had in the US. Even 100 times better than Chirashi I had in Mandarin Oriental which was 3 times more expensive.   They've been open for 7 weeks now. Could never find this place without Yelp. Thanks, Yelpers!! Right next door to Taco y taco. They even have curry on the menu?! Wow. I never saw any sushi place has curry on the menu, but maybe I'll try next time ;-) Love Japanese curry...!! Two brothers (the owners) were super nice guys. I love to see sushi places owned by Japanese people as I see a lot of places owned by Korean or even Chinese.  Loved it. Definitely coming back.",

The booths are kind of cool with small curtains giving you a little privacy. Their menu is the typical sushi restaurant items but very user friendly with pictures/descriptions of their rolls, boxed meals, sashimi, including some items made for couples or group meals. The food is very good and rolls are  very well made. The staff and sushi chefs are very friendly and attentive to whatever you need. It's nice to have this restaurant within walking distance and look forward to visiting them again soon.",

Who know good sushi could still be had here in Vegas :) Words could not best describe the bliss i had with getting their fatty tuna sushi. It was extremely tender and practically melts in my mouth (consider I have teeth issues to chew faster).   Although it's a bit pricey, what do you expect? It's definitely worth the quality seafood freshness here at Sushi Hiro! If the busy bustling vibe of The Strip gets too much, definitely make a trip out to here to veg out~",

Also, I felt the slices of sashimi were too thick. I'm happy that this is NOT AYCE as I find that a disgusting concept.   Food: chirashi, sashimi lunch and chicken katsu bento. quality was there, but too thick slices felt cumbersome in terms of mouth feel. I like that the chirashi came with pickles. It would be nice if they served complimentary orange slices at the end to get rid of the fish taste in my mouth.   Service: very friendly and welcoming.   I think I would be back to try bento box lunch again. In terms of Tokyo-style sushi, in Henderson, I still prefer Tokyo Boys.",

Walking in we were immediately greeted, seated and handed hot towels to clean our hands.  Waitress handed us a menu and a daily special menu. My fiancee was extremely impressed that the daily menu had the date typed in and was on high quality paper. He said it showed classiness instead of the typical fast hand written specials on a board.   Fatty tuna ($8) and salmon belly ($7). Best tasting fish I've had in the valley. Have I had good fish else where? Yes, but it was topped with other heavy dressing sauces or ingredients. This was natural, simple and fresh without fishiness. I just can't explain it.   Next we had the screaming O ($15), which was a fresh salad with tons of ahi tuna. Yum! Very large. I would eat one just as a lunch dish.   Lastly we had a fatty tuna crunch roll ($15). Best roll I've had without all the crap dragging it down. Loved it! We even ordered a second one and the sushi chef gave us fresh cut jalapenos and chopped wasabi to try it even spicier.   Five stars hands down. No AYCE? No problem!! We love AYCE but this beat AYCE by a long shot",

The waitresses all speak Japanese and some of them are even starting to recognize my family and me due to our frequent visits.  The prices are as expected for a good Japanese restaurant; slightly higher but not exorbitant, and great value considering the extremely high quality of the food.  Service is phenomenal and courteous. The interior is clean and sleek. They take reservations but I can usually get a table without a reservation as well.  I love their main menu, and they have rotating specials as well. They have some sushi too (not AYCE), but I would come here for their more traditional fare. Their chirashi is a very popular item, and they give a lot of food! Overall, the food here is exquisite; I am starting to drool just thinking about it!  Definitely come here for amazing Japanese food; I recommend it to others all the time!",

I dined by myself and sat at the sushi bar, so it was nice to see the chef paid attention to me even though they were slammed this Saturday night. Btw the make their own wasabi and it is 1000% better than the powdered stuff. The agedashi tofu is amazing, so is the oyster shooter, and silky cooked fish. Also love the salmon, halibut, and red snapperskin sashimi.",

I haven't had much sushi outside of California but I've had a lot of sushi in California from many different places and not even Michelin star sushi joints come close to here. Everything is extremely fresh and amazing tasting, Yuki the brother of Hiro, was nothing but an absolute pleasure to talk with, he himself brings a whole vibe to the place. The staff and all the other chefs are also amazing and extremely friendly. If sushi to you are rolls then don't come here but if you're looking for an authentic life changing sushi experience then this is your spot. Personally I hate Vegas but Sushi Hiro has been one of the main reasons I keep making the trip back. The Omakase experience is worth every penny. I can not wait till next time.

I ordered the chicken teriyaki lunch bento box with tempura, even though I had originally wanted the California roll I totally spaced because I got excited about the tempura. This box has so much food! I did order it to go but none the less there was still so much food. It comes with a small green salad and a miso soup. The bento box had 6 pieces of tempura, 2 shrimp, broccoli, sweet potato, Japanese potato, and cucumber, which is a great variety of veggies! I liked the gyoza more than the spring rolls but that's just my preference. And the two pieces of pickled radish it comes with (the yellow one is my favorite)!   I grew up with really authentic Japanese food back in California and this made me really feel at home. I definitely will be back because the sushi the other table had while I was waiting looked amazing!",

    "text": "As a sushi lover in Las Vegas, I've found it easy to fall into the mindset that I either have to aim edomae style sushi for super-expensive high-end fish or AYCE sushi for more modest quality but high variety and cost efficiency. However, places like this prove that you can find a great compromise.  Sushi Hiro is one of the newer spots in this middle-of-the-road sushi segment. They do have omakase options, but their dinner menu has more easily afforded options. Sandwiched between a taqueria and a fast casual burger chain location in a popular and convenient plaza on Eastern near Richmar, this place has been on my radar for a while now, but I only managed to visit it when some friends came up with it as a backup plan after we learned that our first choice for Friday night dinner was shockingly busy.  I entered to find my group already seated at a booth rather than the bar, and they seemed to be going toward the less pricey end of the spectrum, so there was no way I was going for omakase regardless. I ended up choosing the Sushi Dinner ($29.95), which consists of the typical sides of salad and miso soup, a small tuna roll, and the chef's choice of ten pieces of nigiri.  For what it's worth, the salad had an atypical, not so sweet dressing and was fresh, and the miso soup was balanced. I'll also say now that the tuna was pretty tasty in its simple presentation, which is at the center of one of those thin tubes fully wrapped in nori. No fancy sauces or fish on top here, just a few simple and well-executed ingredients. These pieces ended up being a nice palate cleanser following certain subsequent bites.  Most deserving attention was the nigiri course. Ten different fish (well, nine actual fish and one shrimp) were represented here, and some had garnishes while others were presented unadorned, with a small wasabi layer gluing these pieces to the rice underneath. Also, after I looked back at the menu to compare pricing for individual orders of nigiri, I determined that the monetary value easily swings toward choosing this sushi dinner, and to have the benefit of variety on top was music to my taste buds. You're welcome for the mixed metaphor.  Lest I ramble on too much about the fish, they all had excellent flavor variations and will taste familiar if you've eaten them elsewhere. The ones on my plate were maguro (tuna), hamachi (yellowtail), sake (salmon), aji (horse mackerel), ebi (shrimp), super white tuna, ma dai (a Japanese snapper, also called sea bream), red snapper, albacore, and saba (mackerel). The mackerel types clearly had more fishiness, certain fish were mushy but in an obviously deliberate way (salmon, sea bream), and the ebi never tastes special to me, but everything was distinct and enjoyable in its own way. Oh, and the size of each piece is what I'd call a moderate mouthful. Don't you dare bite it in half though...  I also tasted a couple of other items on our table. There was a roll with tuna inside, eel on top, and eel sauce all over (named eel lover's roll, perhaps, and going for around $13) which was quite enjoyable as far as rolls go. The Curry Rice ($11.95) was a massive portion of this common Japanese dish, and the depth of flavors plus the delicious Tonkatsu (breaded pork) will almost certainly be my order on a future visit. As a Henderson resident, this steal of a deal might preclude most if not all future trips to Spring Mountain or the Southwest for similar dishes. Lastly, two tablemates had bento boxes, and while I didn't sample anything of these dishes, the portion size looks more than appropriate for dinner.  Sushi Hiro is a very respectable sushi joint with a few other Japanese dishes up their sleeve, and I'm already feeling the urge to return for a small taste of more of their pricier fish as well as such simpler options as described above. They're worth a visit for sushi enthusiasts of all levels as well as the fish-averse.",

I have eaten at many very high end and high priced sushi bars and this ranks up with the very best. The chefs are two brothers and they are both very impressive as chefs.   The quality was top notch with many choices fresh from Japan.  If you're staying on the strip, it is worth driving to this place as it delivers consistently better quality and without the ridiculously high prices. And servings are not microscopically small like they do on the strip to cut costs because their rent is so damn high. I'd say even better than Nobu or Zuma for a sushi purist.",

    "text": "A visit to Sushi Hiro was at the top of my list since I was dying to complete my imaginary \"Chef Hiro\" omakase trilogy.  Unsure as to why three of the standout off the strip sushi restaurants are all spearheaded by such talented chefs with the same name (Sushi Hiroyoshi, Tokyo Boys are the other two), but I plan on legally changing my name to Hiro for a couple of weeks to see if that raises my own culinary game.  Prior to arrival, we called to discover that their corkage fee was a ridiculously low $7 (?!?!?!?) and snagged a couple of bottles at Trader Joe's up the street, which enhanced dinner smaaaashingly.  This is also the most price accessible Japanese spot offering omakase, starting at $49, but we opted for the $89 premium option and were seated in front of Chef Hiro himself in order to compare it fairly with the others...and because I am a fucking pig.      While Raku's version of tofu is the gold standard for Las Vegas, the one that the Chef Hiro doles out is excellent and would save any Henderson resident some car fuel if they were jonesing for a soy fix.  The tempura dish, the other option for this specific course, was also first-rate.  The ocean trout sashimi was definitely a highlight, cut thick and delicious; these mini filets had me absolutely fish-giddy.  Served on a bed of crushed ice with several other cuts of sashimi and a mini-box of uni (kawaiiiiiii), it was easy to see that the chef and his staff take great pride in details.  All the nigiri served was terrific with the most unique being the special chu-toro from Massachusetts of all places.  This provided a unique flavor and chew; almost like a cross between ika and maguro...even in color!  Overall, this was another noteworthy dining experience that I would gladly return to.  4.12777492739204 stars!",

The people are professional, friendly and also the place is very clean and inviting. Prices are fair, definitely not the least expensive place in area but their fish is quality so we feel its worth it. We have not found a place like this in Vegas area that is similar to Japan quality.  We are now regulars at the sushi bar.",

I had my toddler with me and it was very nice that our server asked me where I would like the high chair placed. Our drink order was taken and our food order was placed.   I ordered the salmon dinner bento box and my husband ordered 2 sushi rolls. The miso soup and salad that came with my dinner came out immediately.  Unfortunately, the rest of our food took a REALLY long time to come out.  When our server, Grace saw a the look on my face, she came right over to our table to check on us.  She checked on our food and apologized about the delay. When the food finally came out, all was good. My salmon bento box was a great value.  It filled me and my daughter up. My husband said his sushi rolls were just okay- not worth the price we paid.  Grace checked on us several more times and even brought a little toy out to keep my daughter entertained.    Considering the great customer service that Grace provided us, we may give this place another shot.",

The food tasted very good, no complaints at all.   The place also has some good soothing music to match the beautiful Interior of the place. I had the pleasure of coming when the owner Hiro san was at the resturant. Very kind and knowledgeable.    Will come back again. One of the best Japanese resturants I have ever been to.",

It was a great, nearly-authentic Japanese experience and I can't wait to go back.   When we first walked in, all the staff gave a hearty \"Irasshaimase!\" - \"Welcome!\" - which was a good sign. After we were seated, we were given hot towels (o-shibori) for washing our hands, another tradition you see in Japan but not so much in Japanese restaurants here. Two for two for hitting the \"authentic\" Japanese restaurant experience!  While we knew what we wanted, we looked over the menu and ended up ordering a baked asparagus appetizer as well. It was tasty and a nice starter to the bowls of curry heading our way. And man, were we happy when the curry hit the table. I had the torikatsu (fried chicken cutlet) with it, and at first I though the chicken alone was a little bland and needed more salt, but then I had it with the curry sauce, it was perfect. And man, that curry sauce. Unbelievable, with the flavors of the vegetables coming through beautifully, but all in perfect balance. Curry carving: blown away.   As far as the restaurant, it's a nice modern looking place, with a few well-chosen Japanese decorations. Clean and uncluttered. Relaxing, but not fancy.   There were only a few things that kept this from feeling like you were sitting in a restaurant in Japan: No doorbell buttons on the table - but it is an American restaurant, after all, and the wait staff were all very attentive so no need for the bells; and the contemporary pop on the radio. And the whole \"everyone speaking English\" bit ;)  Overall, REALLY excited to have a great curry place close by, I can't wait to come back and try some of the sushi!",

My friends and I went to road trip; Arizona, Utah, and Las Vegas. Let me tell you, the first three days that we spent at Arizona and Utah, we only had burgers... PURE burgers. We Asians miss rice so much. Then the last day we arrived at Las Vegas, Sushi Hiro was the first place that came to our mind and we were not hesitate to visit at all.    We ordered a bunch of sushi. The rolls were placed in a big boat, pretty fancy, and all of the rolls were DELICIOUS. Every rolls became my favorite especially Out Of Control roll and Under Control roll. One of my friends also order off the bento menu. He said the bento was so good that he couldn't have enough! Overall, all the food was PREMIUM QUALITY. Service was FAST and ATTENTIVE. The interior and decoration were pretty. Great food with a good price deal. HIGH recommendation to try out this place and you won't be regret, believe me. Thank you Nami, Brian, and Chris so much for such a great services. We had a blast time. ^^",

Delicious sashimi...We ordered whole Japanese Spanish Mackarel sashimi and 1/2 of the Red Snapper sashimi that so delicious just like we revisited Japan.  It's fresh and melted in your mouth!!!  It's hard to find any place that can make a whole fish out of the sashimi except Sushi Hiro.  We can't find this place in Washington D.C...you can't beat the price because it's really cheap compared to Morimoto in MGM Vegas strip and the taste much better believe me!  We requested to have the fish bone deep fried and grill for $20 extra and it's worth it because our kids love it...The lady server is really nice and fast service since we were an early bird for dinner and hardly anyone there so we got the best service in house for that day...:-)  Next time if we ever come back to Vegas, we're definitely will be here again for sure.... My sister and her husband come to Vegas twice a year for a furniture show so they definitely will come back here with friends and family soon...Thank you Chef!  Our family will support your restaurant all the way...:-)",

But after reading a few peoples review I wanted to try this place for their freshness. I was going to order the Pine Omakase but was scared it'll be too much food for both of us. Boy was that a mistake! I was still hungry after our Bamboo Omakase so I had to order a Philly roll. LOL. People are right, the raw fish here is good. And it's fresh. The sushi chef infeont of us cut a live shrimp and made it into sashimi for the table next to us. It was crazy! Even if you don't order the Omakase, order the Black Cod. OMGSH! Just do it, and you'll understand. The only reason why I have them a 4 star was because I thought the food was going to keep coming. But instead we were sitting there 7-10 minutes in between each dish. The whole dinner probably took about 2 hours.",

My girlfriend and I ate there a few nights back, we have been hearing nothing but great things about this new sushi restaurant in the area so we had to try it. When we walked in we were greeted by the whole front of house staff as well as all the Sushi Chefs. When we sat down in the cozy booth we looked over the extensive sushi menu, everything in the sushi window looked very fresh so we knew we would be eating great! Our server came over and got our drink orders, she explained to us about the 5 course $46 menu that the sushi chef makes especially for you so we decided to go with this option. We were not disappointed by any means, everything tasted so fresh and the rice that was accompanied with the sushi was the best I've ever had.  If you are looking for an All You Can Eat sushi joint this will not be your place. Sushi Hiro takes pride in his rolls as well as the fresh seafood he offers at the restaurant. Thank you Sushi Hiro and staff for the awesome experience, we will definitely be back!",

You'll find no \"Screaming Orgasms\" here or \"Johnny Roll # 5.\" What you'll find are classic rolls redone in interesting ways. The flavors aren't unique. But they are simple and refined. You can tell the chef is meticulous about the ingredients he selects, the seasonings he adds, etc.   What I look for in sushi is rice. Is it perfectly seasoned? Is it perfectly cooked? Or is it mushy and crunchy at the same time and drowned in sauce? Yes, yes and NO.   I've never had rice like this before. At first I thought something was wrong. But no. The granules were tight on the rolls and pieces and then melted into perfectly cooked grains in my mouth. It was firm, yet delicate. Savory, yet sweet. Beautiful.   Oh and the fish is fresh too.   No more long winded reviews. Just go. You can thank me later.",

No saltiness. Jus blah. Shumai was cold in the middle and almost pasty. Gross. Portion is big but quantity never rules over quality.  2) Tempura- no finesse. The tempura was not flaky and delicate. Instead it was globby, oily, and blah. To boot, I think the shrimp tempura was really ebi fry and not tempura. Big difference.  3) Sushi Rice- could've used a bit more vinegar and tasted more like regular rice. On a couple of the rolls the rice was hard and almost pasted together. Weird sensation and not pleasant.   Hiro did deliver on the following: 1) Service- excellent. Attentive, friendly, and sincere. Well trained staff.  2) Ambiance- comfortable. Very clean restaurant. Booths with the curtains is a nice touch.  3) Flexible- requested a substitution and was accommodated with a smile.  4) Quality of Fish- on point. Fresh.   Bottom line- next time we'll go for sashimi and nigiri. I get the feeling they offer the bento to cast a wider net of diners but the attention is on the fish. Not on the bento. I hope they pay more attention to the quality of the sushi rice and maintain the quality of the fish.",

I have eaten sushi at many restaurants, been many times to Japan, so I had never had an omakase where the same fishes are served twice, and in particular almost in the same style (with and without rice).

I was surprised by the price of Omakase, the ranges much cheaper than other places. I ordered the $109 --pine Omakase, so much food!!!! About 9 courses as I remembered. The quality of fish were good and fresh. The grilled fish was so juicy and tender, perfectly cook.  The only thing I don't like about was too much cook food for me. First time eat Omakase feel so full already before the nigiri course come out.   The service was the highlight of the whole experience. The sushi chef--Hiro san really pay attention of detail. I didn't even say I was full, and he just knew, and suggested to make the sushi rice smaller.   Very authentic experience!",

    "text": "So this is not the place to go if you're famished and want to stuff your face, as that will quickly make you go broke.  It is not an All You Can Eat place, and it is very expensive.  That being said it is worth it.  The cuts are amazing, and everything is very fresh.  The presentation is amazing as well.  The only reason it is not a 5 star from me, is the price.  I understand that quality costs, but there are some AYCE places not terribly far away with extremely high quality at less than half the price.    I had a friend who visited this place and proclaimed it as her favorite.  When she and another friend decided they should go there again, the one friend asked me, and I said of course I would join them.    So I got there a bit earlier than they did and found an quaint little joint that was excellently decorated, and the booths have a little curtain for privacy.  Not that there was any conversation that needed privacy but if you're closing a big business deal and you have trade sensitive info, rest assured there is a bit of privacy.  As I got to the booth and waited for my friends, I perused the massive menu.    There is a plethora of options available, including rolls, sashimi, nigiri, and appetizers.  So my friends and I ordered several options, a few rolls, and some nigiri.  It came out fast and was beautiful.  The yellowtail roll was absolutely my favorite.  It came with a sauce that was a blast of flavor. The Tako was also one of the highlights for me.  Everything we ordered was delicious.    At the end of the meal, we all left full and happy.  That is the point of dining out, and Sushi Hiro delivered.  If you're looking for a quaint place tastefully decorated, with amazing sushi, this could be your place.  If you're extremely hungry and looking for an endless supply of sushi at a more reasonable price- this is not your place.  I do like the music at other sushi places better too, but the classical music in the air complemented the food well.    Vegas has so many options for so many palates.  It is good to have options for everyone seeking sushi.  Everyone needs a hero, could this be your sushi Hiro?  Only you can decide.",

Yesterday Friday the 2nd of Aug I stopped in at 1300 to order a roll to go. I was approached by a server who promptly  today me  not today no to go orders. We too busy you can not order come back another day.  I looked at the woman dumbfounded and said excuse me, she again repeats no to go order they are busy come back another day. I've never been to an establishment who didn't want my money.   My spouse and I had a similar experience in April here. We were told we could only eat until 7:30 because she was expecting a table if 6. So we had to go before their arrival.     Such a shame I really liked this place and they were so close to the house. Now on to finding a new sushi favorite",

Hiro Service:  I've been here multiple times since the first visit and the service is comparable to a $$$$ restaurant.  Once seated, you are presented with a warm hot towel to freshen up.   Everyone is friendly and although a small restaurant, it's not uncommon for multiple servers to check on you throughout your dining experience. Fantastic  Hiro Sushi & more:  This is not an AYCE sushi joint but they offer numerous in house rolls (currently 40 on the menu)  All the nigiri, sashimi and rolls I've had have been very tasty and fresh. My current favorite roll there is the \"out of control\" (#9)  Loaded with eel, crabmeat, cream cheese & avocado inside along with suna, salmon, & yellowtail outside.  It's like an inverted philly roll with all kiiinds of #gainz.  The Bento boxes are packed with so much food that it's hard for me to finish.  The Udon is at a level better than some stand alone Udon restaurants in the Vegas Valley.  I'm just as impressed with their non-sushi dishes, excellent.  Hiro Ambiance:  Modern Sushi house decor with dark wood being used throughout the restaurants for tables, chairs, and booths.  The Sushi bar is shaped like an L and seats about 15 people?  You can dress casually or dressy and both would be fine at Sushi Hiro.  The great service that hasn't faltered coupled with the high quality food makes for great visits which is why I frequent here weekly.  The omakase experience is coming up soon but that's another Yelp tale.   Arigato! =)",

    "text": "I had been hearing about how great sushi Hiro was since it opened, but just finally made it in.   Walking inside you pass through the split red curtain into an almost nautical design.  They have bar seating, table seating in the middle,  and more secluded booth seating to the side.   They also have like 4 menus, but if you have an idea of what you want you can navigate fairly quickly.   They also hand you a warm towel to clean your hands before the meal.   What many people continued to reference was how fresh the fish was here, and honestly they did not disappoint.   I really enjoyed watching the sushi chefs, and the  care they put into handling their product.   The rolls themselves are very generous portions, and we'll worth their price.  No all you can eat here, this place is about the quality not how much you can shove in your face.   I actually converted one of my friends who always insists on all you can eat,  through a meal here.    One item she cannot stop talking about is the higher level cut of the tuna nigiri she got.  They had been out of their cheaper option, so she went for the 10 dollar one.  It was the size of like 5 all you can eat portions,  thick almost like a steak,  and buttery.    Now some rolls that stood out to me through both visits were the best friends roll,  and the rock n roll.  Their sashimi at lunch is such a great deal for how amazing the cuts are.   They put a chilli sauce on one of my white fish cuts though that was not my favorite.  Also the miso soup they have is fairly basic,  and the dressing on the salad although very fresh tasting is a little heavy in onion.   Also even though overall the service is stellar,  I would have liked them to tell me what fish selection the chef gave me.  I had an idea,  but it's nice to know for the future when I order.    I also love that they have some more obscure options on the menu for the foodies like egg custard,  it had the perfect jiggle to it,  with the broth from the meats inside breaking through with each spoonful.  It was savory yet light,  and oh so comforting.   One little tid bit that really made me happy, is in addition to grated wasabi, you can order chopped wasabi. They also let you order their other sauces on the side as well.    For dessert I have a deep weakness for fried ice cream,  especially green tea flavor.  So when I saw they had this, I had to have it.   They even light it on fire to add to the crunch right in front of you.   The green tea itself is lighter in flavor not a heavier matcha, but it was still lovely with all the components.  They top it with whipped cream and chocolate sauce.   I had to give this place 5 stars because a week later I was already back,  and I look forward to many more visits exploring their menus.",

    "text": "Among the sea of trendy, hip, all-you-can-eat sushi restaurants, there is a jewel of a sushi establishment that sticks to a more traditional flair with quality ingredients, friendly staff, and a homey atmosphere.   This place reminds me of a lot of sushi places of the late 90s, early 2000s. You know, those small mom & pop shops, but with a tasteful updated decor and aesthetic style. It just feels welcoming.  As soon as you're seated, you're greeted with a warm moist towel. A rare sight to see these days at any restaurant. They're refreshing, clean, comforting, and very Japanese. I could already tell that this was going to be a good dining experience at that point.  I came here for good sushi, and that is all I ordered. The salmon and yellowtail nigiri were great. Smooth, buttery, and tasted so fresh. However, the chutoro nigiri was just so, so good. It was worth the $14 for those pieces. The rest of my orders were a salmon roll, negihama roll, and negitoro roll. All again very good, but the negitoro roll tasted amazing. Almost divine. It's just something about that combination of the fish and scallions that add an extra dimension of flavor that is almost mindblowing. I'm a guy who enjoys minimal ingredients at the tastiest levels, so this was a near perfect meal.   The presentation of the dishes are also noteworthy. The nigiri pieces were beautifully and precisely cut, served on a curved stone plate, and the rolls neatly placed, also on a unique stone plate.  If you want to take a break from the AYCE scene, or you're ready to take the next step into a more authentic Japanese dining experience, then Sushi Hiro is the place to go.",

    "text": "What a lovely find! My new favorite sushi restaurant in Vegas! This place is a drive from the strip and doesn't have that chic ambience. However, they serve high quality, authentic style sushi without the jacked up prices that you would find on the strip.  We opted not to do the omakase as we were looking to get sashimi only and didn't care for the extra appetizers, sides, and cooked fish. We ordered the chirashi and sashimi dinner platter. Beautiful presentation and very fresh fish. I really liked how the chirashi had a generous amount of tobiko in the rice. I also really liked the two different types of tomago in the chirashi. I'm not one to comment on the tomago, but both tasted delicious! One of them had this cake-like taste to it. I'd definitely get it again.  We sat by the bar and saw the sushi chefs in action. All the dishes they were preparing looked great and while we wanted to order more, we were pretty stuffed by the end of our meals.  Great service as well!",

At first I was leary because we are used to AYCE but we all left with full, happy bellies.  Let me say, this place is on the higher end $$$ wise but the quality is superb. We actually ended up over ordering because the portions are big, especially on the appetizers. 3 of us ordered the Age Dashi Tofu but 1 order would have been enough for all 3 of us.  My husband ordered Sukiyaki Udon and said it was perfect. Every bite having a little bit of everything in it and the flavor being spot on.  I ordered the Fashion roll and the beef negimaki!! The roll was super fresh and the beef came out on a sizzling iron plate. Perfectly seared on the bottom and tender. Taste was amazing. My MIL had a sushi dinner. Nice pieces of fish with small amount of rice. She said it was delicious. Staff was very friendly and polite. We will definitely be back to try more dishes!!",

In short, Sushi Hiro is the best sushi in Henderson!  I've only been by for lunch, where the omakase and chirashi prices are a bit lower. The dishes are consistently fresh, beautifully presented, and full of flavor. My go to is the chirashi bowl, and the chef is great about accommodating reasonable requests (no wasabi, no octopus, etc). Though they do offer a menu of rolls, I stick to their more traditional sushi options, which are simple but well executed.   Note that you can order online to take your spectacular sushi feast home. I advise against this because of how great the dine-in presentation and service are, go when you can enjoy the whole experience! Highly recommend sitting at the bar to watch the action, but the private booths are nice too.",

We had the Bamboo omakase (mid tier @ $69) and had a great meal with very good cuts of fish.  The cooked food was as good as the sashimi and sushi.  Our table also ordered a roll - one of the largest rolls I have seen.  Usually that means lesser quality, but that was not the case here.  Give Sushi Hiro a try!",

You can get fish here that is simply not available at 95% of the sushi bars in town.  They do try to accommodate American/Las Vegan tastes with a large special roll menu, but do yourself a favor and order some fresh chu toro nigiri, kumamoto oysters, giant clam sashimi, etc. Their homemade tofu is a treat as well.   This place is not all you can eat and hopefully Vegas learns that that is a GOOD THING if you're looking for real, quality sushi. Sushi Hiro could compete with the better joints in southern California.",

If you're really hungry, their rolls will fill you up. One order has like 20 pieces it seems. Salmon lover is my go to roll when I'm super hungry but don't want to spend too much $$.

    "text": "Walking in, the vibe is sweet and welcoming for a sushi place. The staff behind the sushi bar are all Japanese and look happy to be there.   The owner is from southern Japan so nearly all their fish is flown in fresh! The attention to detail is really impressive, down to de-seeding the jalapeno slices.  The amount of fish in each roll is in abundance, they add a very thin layer of rice which is very authentic.   Cold tofu: homemade tofu, is a comfort food for us. Most places it's never perfect but when I saw the plating we knew it's authentic! So fresh and just heavenly, I love it with fresh yuzu paste and they accommodated me!   Eel unagi: fresh! By far the best I've had in the country, we like it extra crispy with sauce on the side.   Mexican roll: this roll is so well thought out, the shrimp with the spicy crab, avocado, cucumber and top it off with fresh shrimp. Unique and full of flavor.  hubby- \"it's not that spicy but it's bomb, really bomb\" a must try   Fire dragon: the tuna mix is spectacular and so fresh, they took the time to remove the seeds from the jalapeno slices on top!   Spider roll: spectacular, the crab had a lovely crunch to it and it accented the pickled burdock root so well. Love!  We have found our new sushi spot, can't wait to come back!",

I chose the l sashimi lunch platter which was a miso soup, salad, and a really gorgeous plate of sushi....like I should've taken a pic bc it was really beautiful to look at but I was too hungry. It was chef choice and included salmon, tuna, red snapper (the popular) and yellow tail and striped jack with a small bowl of white rice. Fresh and as good as it looked. The rolls looked creative and good but I was full and happy. I'll be back next time for a roll.

This place has a couple dishes that really stand out for me and they pull it off well.    The chirashi is awesome - it's always a selection of the best fish served on a bed of rice. Another favorite of mine is the salmon kama - the way they prepare it is absolutely perfect every time. It takes a little longer to prepare but it is worth the wait. Most places will just throw their kama in the fryer for the sake of saving time but it doesn't come out as well. I believe that they use a broiler for theirs.   The service is always attentive - sushi chefs are friendly and the food is legit authentic Japanese. Peak dinner times can get really busy, so come early or late and grab a comfortable booth or go strike up a conversation at the bar.",

Time of delivery, presentation, quality, amount, and taste of food was amazing. Amazing enough, we came back a second time in less than 2 weeks.  Second time, it was a Sunday evening and slow.  Again, seated right away and food was still exceptional.  But, there were a few cons this time around.  Couple seated after us, were catered prior to us and received their food before we  received our drinks.  One item from my order was not put in and waited a bit longer to receive that item.  This is why gave 4 out 5 stars.  Depending on our next visit, this review may/may not change.",

The freshness of the fish was reminiscent of our recent experience in Japan. On the pricier end of sushi restaurant but you definitely get quality both in the menu and the service.   A big group walked in right before us and orders were backed up, they were very attentive and apologetic. We didn't really mind and we weren't in a hurry. They felt so bad they gave us a generous order of complimentary mochi ice cream which were very soft and delicious.   They've definitely earned my business, and will be recommending to friends and family!",

I don't have enough compliments for the sushi chefs here.   Their food is even better then their service. I even took my gf here who doesn't usually eat raw fish and she loves it as well. They have quite a large selection of nigiri as well as rolls! In addition, their rolls come with 10 pieces instead of the usual 8 so they are a tad bit larger.   If you can't decide what nigiri to get, you should have their chirashi! It has assorted sashimi on top of sushi rice! Every time I come here I always have to get at least one order of their Uni. It's so creamy and delicious!  Overall, just come to this place if you live nigiri and even if you like rolls. Hands down best food best service and my favorite sushi place in Vegas.",

I arrived at 5:55p, requested a table for two and was seated with the quickness. My homegirl opted for a table at the sushi bar, cuz \"it's like a show- you get to watch them build and create the sushi rolls!\" (Per my homegirl)!   The menu is quite large, so if you're a regular sushi eater- then you're going to really enjoy this place! I opted to try the Wa Gyu Beef ($12/2 pieces) and the salmon roll. The Wagyu Beef was like butter, raw pieces of meat sightly torched with a flame- glazed with a light garlic ponzu sauce?! Yes please! The salmon roll was fresh, light and yummy!   The customer service is great! I drink a lot of water and the server was on it refilling my cup as soon as it hit half way empty! Plus my homegirl was right, sitting at the bar is truly an enjoyable experience.   I would totally eat here again in the future!",

    "text": "If only I could give this place more than 5 stars!   Most sushi joints in the US seem to only cater deep fried saucy things and cream-cheese smothered rolls that they dare call sushi. But not here. I mean, they do have a lot of rolls. And I'm sure they're delicious. But the nigiri and sashimi is really where they shine.  For nigiri, we tried the yellowtail, yellowtail belly, salmon belly, red snapper, and kamashita. All of them were so amazing. Especially the kamashita toro, which is on the pricier side, but so worth the splurge. The marble on this slice of fish was out of this world, and it literally melts in your mouth. It's like a bite sent from the seas of heaven. We also ordered the toro tartar on crispy rice. Another must order item! So full of flavor from the fresh wasabi, red caviar, toro, and light sauces. And a good balance of textures with the fatty tuna on top of the crispy rice.   The freshness of the fish was almost on par with my experience at the Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo. Definitely the best sushi in Vegas, and probably one of the best in all of the west coast.   I want to thank chef Yuki for being such a friendly and accommodating sushi master! You can tell he is really skilled by how focused and precise he is in cutting the fish. It is like a form of art.  I'm sad I don't live in Las Vegas, so I can't come here more often. But at the same time, I'm glad I don't live in Las Vegas, so I can't come here more often. My credit card would be maxed out in like a week.  Patiently waiting until the next time my taste buds can be blessed by Sushi Hiro..",

The rolls were sliced thinly compared to other places, fish of course is thinned. But tasted good.   Negative side was our service was slow.

Hands down the best sushi restaurant I have been to. The 2 head sushi chefs are two brothers from Japan and everything they serve they put their own pride into. The fish were super fresh and big portions of fish. Everything was smooth and buttery. I'm really picky when it comes to sushi and this place is the only place in Vegas I would trust. Even more than the sushi restaurants on the strip. I wish I could give this place 10 stars I would. Hiro is an amazing sushi chef with lots of knowledge and personality. MUST TRY!!!",

Towards the end of the night the staff behind the Sushi bar started yelling \"vamonos\" as in telling us to hurry and pay our bill. I'm pretty sure that falls on a the rude scale.

This place is authentic Japanese sushi unlike most sushi restaurant in Henderson. The dinning area is decorated so adorable and they have booths that offer some privacy while dinning.   Beware their rolls are HUGE..which is not bad at all! Another great thing about this place is that they have a lot of pictures on the menu which always makes your decision easier. Upon request you can get fresh wasabi which if you have not tried yet (and you can handle the heat) you certainly need to request it. The servers and staff were all very friendly. They are also featured on a few food delivery apps and yelp delivery which is very convenient for a sushi night at home.",

But it doesn't break the bank either. This sashimi dinner is amazing!",

    "text": "By far the best sushi joints in the southeast, where quality Asian eateries are few and far between, and easily one of the best in town.   Sushi (and sashimi) menu is fairly comprehensive, complemented by Daily Catch and Omakase (i.e, A Japanese version of prix fixe). On my first visit, I ordered the Chirashi Lunch Special ($15.95), with a side of Toro and Scallion Roll ($10). The hot tea was free (I think).   The lunch special came with miso soup, salad, and chirashi bowl. The fish was very fresh and in generous potion, and the sushi rice was very flavorful. I highly recommend it to all who like poke bowls - in comparison to most places specializing in poke bowls, here you are getting high-quality fish of different varieties, proper sushi rice, restaurant-quality soup & salad, and unlimited supply of green tea (that doesn't come from a tea bag). In addition, the lunch potion was so generous that, half way through it, I started to regret the side-dish order.   The place is clean and bright. Service was friendly and attentive. While I was there, a shipment of 27lbs of tuna came in, and I took a photo of Hiro San going at it - perhaps for the dinner service? In any case, I'll definite be back for the Omakase menu.",

They are also a bit overpriced for the quality of food that they have. The food not pertaining to fish was decent though. Lunch time would be the best time to go.",

For a decent price the lunch and dinner specials come with a huge portion. The sushi and sashimi specials come with miso soup and salad. They have a chef selection of fishes and all are good quality. The bento specials come with an entree of your choice, miso soup, salad, selected tempura, and a california roll. So much food!  If you do not want to eat the lunch or dinner specials, you can order al la carte. However, I don't recommend doing this. Whatever fish I ordered in nigiri and sashimi was not the fish they brought out to me. They claim to have all these rare fishes, but when I order them, they always bring me \"similar\" fishes and not the exact one I order. Just beware of this so you don't get ripped off.  Update: The yellowtail cappacio is really good! Take note that they put a lot of the oil sauce so I would ask for light sauce.",

The highly recommended Chirashi was indeed really good, and large! I could do without the imitation crab among all that great fish though. I'm not sure if the chirashi is the same size at dinner and lunch, but it does cost quite a bit more at dinner. The Salmon Teriyaki box was also really good and a big portion, with great salmon quality.  We also had a salmon jaw, which was very good. My wife has to have her fish attached to bones so she had to have it. The Udon looked good, although I didn't try it. The dish that wasn't great was the chicken kara-age. I've had much better, but it was certainly OK.  Would absolutely come again!!",

Sushi Hiro gets fresh fish from Tokyo a couple times a week just like those fancier places. The chirashi is a fantastic mix of fresh fish on a large box of rice. My husband refers to it as the \"box of fish.\" Also try the homemade tofu if it's available. It's a firm type of tofu but the mix of toppings is delightful.  My favorite though, is the chef's tasting menu. Go big! This is an amazing experience. It's 8 courses of delicious raw and cooked foods. Service is great when you're sitting at the sushi bar so I recommend doing that whenever possible. I've never needed a reservation but I usually go on a weekday later in the evening or on a Sunday for lunch.  Check it out. You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "I enjoyed Sushi Hiro very much. There is such a plethora of Sushi places in town and that is such a great thing for us Las Vegans.  There are very traditional places, the popular Roll type of sushi houses and in this case with Sushi Hiro, a blend of your Roll type sushi house meets tradition.  1. The authenticity - I really love it when you can walk into a Sushi Restaurant and the Japanese that is spoken is more than just Irrashaimasu.  To hear the sushi chefs speaking the lingo and calling out orders for pick up in that traditional way just adds to the ambiance.  2.  The ambiance - I like the simple originality of the place. Big Sushi bar, a few tables in the middle, and then booths with a bit of privacy along the side.  Clean, efficient lighting and those large wrapped Sake Barrels used as part of the decor.  Lighting is just right, the lights themselves are so simple and nice.  Just a great place to enter.  Not much room for waiting though.  3. Service - The team tonight was tapped out as it was freaking busy at 8:00 pm on a Friday night.  The wifey and I entered when there was a small lull, but about 8:45 pm the second or third wave hit and it was swamped. But alas, the team is so friendly, nice and welcoming.  4.  The Food - That is what we are here to talk about so let's rock this place out.  a. The rolls - As you may be aware by now, I am not a huge roll fan, however, I find them definitely edible and tasty. I mean, as a comparison,  I find grilled cheese and PBJ sandwiches tasty and edible, just don't order it much.  Back to Sushi, the rolls here are very good. Rather than the huge massive rolls that are packed and heavy, these rolls are rather delicate. each piece is cut thin and each piece is about 75% the size of those normal rolls you get elsewhere. I do like this in many ways because the taste is simpler, more defined and it seems the nature of the fish and rice stands out more.  When I go to an AYCE Sushi place, I can eat the rolls, but i find that all the flavors and the tastes are masked due to all the sauces and ingredients mixed in.  Here the essence of the sushi is more refined.  If you are a big roll eater and like that huge mix of ingredients, you will find perhaps some disappointment, so be aware that this is entirely a different style of sushi rolls.  b. The Goodies -   Ankimo - ordered up an order of Ankimo, monkfish liver.  You don't get to find this everywhere. It was great and with a bit of scallion, daikon and ponzu sauce to round it out. I am not sure why I like monkfish.  Don't google a picture of one.  I don't know who goes around the world saying \"look at that fish\"  isn't that one tasty fellow!  When I got my first look at a monkfish, I think it was a bit frightening.  Mirugai - You cannot imagine how many sushi places I go to and attempt to get this Geoduck clam or any other type of clam and it is not easy to get. I get a no more than a yes. Here they had it as a special and i ordered it sashimi style. Again, simple, great texture, fresh.  One of my favorites and they had it.  Loved that they served it very simply in a plate with some Wakame.  A nice pairing.  By the way, if you ever googled a picture of this clam, you would probably never order it, so don't google it...and keep your kids away from it.  O-Toro- When ever I am ordering sashimi and tuna specifically, I generally am getting the Maguro. Love Maguro and you get a lot of it in an order as well.  Here they had as a special O-toro. That fatty belly part of the tuna is so tasty and melts in your mouth. I often don't get it at many places, but ask and here it was one of the specials. I enjoyed it and that made it a bit special tonight.  Escolar Super White Tuna - Whenever I go to a place and they have superwhite, I have no idea if it is albacore tuna or escolar fish.  Here they tell you straight up it is escolar.  That fatty special controversial fish that many consider a delicacy.  I guess some people's stomach does not go well with the fatty content that makes this fish so nice.  I had it as a sashimi as well at enjoyed it.  I won't order this all the time, but I do like to order it when I am feeling a wee bit adventurous.  Scooby Doo Roll and the Fashion Roll - Hey, come on, you knew I was going to get a roll anyway!  I had a few bites of these rolls and like I said above, nice, simple, delicate.  Dessert - If you check in on yelp, right now they are offering a free dessert. Mochi ice cream and it tastes great. Always like that.  I will be coming back here for sure to try more of what they offer.  I stuck mainly to the specials and sashimi tonight to get the best possible taste of their fish offerings.  For the second time here, I enjoyed it and will be coming back for sure!",

    "text": "I've only been here once, and I usually visit restaurants at least a couple times before giving them the big 5* - but I'm pretty certain Sushi Hiro will hold up. The reason is that the fish quality is very high, the availability of traditional Japanese fish is good (e.g. on my visit, mirugai, kinmedai, and yari ika were all on the specials list), and it seems like Chef Hiro knows what he's doing.  I see this place as somewhere I see myself splurging a ton ordering a la carte just because the quality is so high, which is great b/c there's nowhere I feel compelled to do that on this side of town. Really the only other places in Vegas I do that right now are the two edomae spots in Chinatown, which are only open for dinner and usually need reservations. Hiro offers a more casual, anytime option, and that's great for people on the Henderson side of things.  I look forward to repeat visits, including trying some of the hot food as well as the omakase menu, and updating my review accordingly.",

The sushi is very fresh and DELICIOUS! I love the fact that the sushi rolls do not have a thick layer of rice, as that gets a little too much sometimes. My favorite sushi roll has to be the Shrimp Tempura roll, I get it every time. The sashimi dinners are amazing as well, how fresh the fish is and the presentation as well.

    "text": "Sushi Hero has many 5 star reviews so expectations were high, unfortunately we were totally underwhelmed. Everyones tastes are different but Yelp is about honest reviews and that is what I will write. We arrived around 5:30 and were quickly greeted and seated in a booth.   I started off with an ice cold Kirin draft while looking at the menu. There are no complimentary appetizers or salads like many other sushi or japanese restaurants (edamame, green salad with ginger dressing, cucumber salad, etc). We put an order in for a few different rolls and nigiri sushi.   All of the order with the exception of the crazy tuna roll was served in the boat which was a really cool presentation. We first tried the yellowtail sushi was fine, pretty thin cut but average. We then went to the eel roll and both looked at each other as we ate it. The eel was very fishy tasting which fish should never be. The rice was cold and hard (like if you have ever had sushi from a supermarket). We did not finish the roll.   We then tried the philly roll, spicy tuna and crazy tuna rolls and again did not care for them at all. The spicy tuna was very \"dry\" and again all of the rice was hard instead of warm and soft.  In all fairness this is more of a traditional sushi restaurant so maybe it just wasn't our taste. Maybe it was an off night? Im not sure but its definitely not like us to not finish our sushi.   Our waitress noticed we didn't finish our food and asked why we didn't like it. We explained the eel was very fishy and she told us they switched to a new supplier and that might have been the issue. She was kind enough to take the eel roll off the bill. Everyone was very friendly and service was good but I cannot give more than 2 stars due to the sushi.",

Although I only ordered one sushi roll (Crunchy Toro Special) from the daily special rolls. It was really really good. The fish quality was fresh and like the combination they came up with for the Crunchy Toro Roll). Not sure if maybe there thing or no doubt found the size of any of the speciality rolls HUGE. Basically your getting two or three extra pieces then regular sushi restaurant if ordered speciality roll. So warning if going specialty rolls two or three that LOT of food. The diversity of the speciality rolls is awesome. They literally have pictures of believe all the specialty rolls on the menu. Really not often seen full menu that literally every dish has picture with it.   My entree ordered from the Dinner Bento Box and got the teriyaki chicken. They have few other protein options if going with the Bento Box. The thing that stood out for me. Most traditional Japanese restaurants that has the Bento or Box dinner on the menu. Not that big. The size at Sushi Hiro is pretty big. Literally every box is filled with food. It also come with miso soup and house salad. Both very tasty. The house salad nice fresh greens and the kicker was the salad dressing was awesome. I would buy bottle of that if they sold it. The teriyaki chicken was just ok. It could have been marinated longer or lacked distinct teriyaki flavor for me.  The service was five star. I came for dinner help celebrate another yelper Terri R birthday with other friends of hers. It was no big deal getting separate checks for party of seven. They were friendly, attentive, and nothing but five star service in my mind.   The restaurant is small but love the interior decor. It very much your traditional style Japanese Restaurant.   Not often on that side of town. Sushi Hiro is sushi spot that would hit up again!!!!",

We opted for a booth which has nice shades on each side for some privacy. Our hostess ended up being our waitress and she started us off with warm towels. The first thing that struck my attention was how clean the restaurant appeared.   I started with the House Salad and the cold ginger dressing didn't disappoint. My husband and I shared the Shumai appetizer which was tender and delicious. We weren't overly hungry so we stuck to sharing two rolls, the Funky Roll and the Fire Dragon Roll. Both tasted fresh and had great flavor. The rolls were nice portions. I wrapped up with the Yelp check-in offer for a free dessert. The Tempura Green Tea Ice Cream was so delicious. I loved the crisp of the tempura coating and the creamy green tea ice cream.  Our waitress provided amazing service during our visit. She was friendly and attentive. Our food came out quickly. Overall, we were delighted with our experience here. This is one of those restaurants that I wish I could give six stars.",

The tuna sashimi was my least favorite and the bowl of rice (side order) was not the sushi rice that I was accustomed to. Dessert - Green Tea Tempura ice cream was what we each selected since we got a free dessert upon check-in via Yelp App offer.  It was beautifully presented, with the waiter lighting the tempura icecream on fire, hence the tempura was nice, warm, and crispy.  I have had green tempura ice cream at many other restaurants, but Sushi Hiro's version is hands down, the best version.",

    "text": "Located off of Eastern Ave. in the massive shopping plaza with restaurants like Cafe Zupas and Taco y Taco, Sushi Hiro is a welcome addition to the dining scene. Folks in Henderson don't have to drive to the Strip or China Town for excellent Japanese. This modest and modern spot has a long sushi counter. It's the best spot to dine if you want to watch the chefs in action. The omakase (two different options) is reasonably priced at $49 and $69, a bargain for the quality and amount of food you get.   Halibut sashimi in tofu oil and yuzu began the meal, with an oyster shooter next. A large portion of shrimp and vegetable tempura followed, all lightly coated and exceptionally crispy.  Fish is where they excel. Tuna from Spain, yellowtail, and ocean trout were all sizable cuts of  quality fish. Another large dish followed with the salmon kama deep fried and sitting in a rich and aromatic agedashi broth. The sushi course was also excellent, particularly the tuna and red snapper. All came glazed with house made sauces.  Ending the meal was a rich and dense green tea cheesecake -- creamy like a traditional American style cheesecake instead of a lighter and fluffier Japanese cheesecake.  4.5 Stars",

This place works out for everyone because it has all the rolls you can imagine, but we don't come here for that.  (But if that's your thing, you'll be more than happy here!)    Our focus is the sashimi dinner, the dinner chirashi, and whatever daily fish they have in stock.  With fresh deliveries coming in twice a week, I love looking out for their most unique items and our favorite is getting the whole Aji Tsukuri.  They recently had this Uni Tray that came with toro, salmon eggs, seaweed, and rice and you put the whole thing together yourself.  So good!  I am happy to bypass all the AYCE sushi joints in town to get some quality fish here.  I really can't say enough about Chef Hiro and his team. I love coming here and they know it. They've been open for a little over a year now and are going strong.  It's super busy on weekends, so make reservations! Families are welcome and large parties are often present.  If you see me there, don't be shy to say hi!",

From the moment you enter and the moment you leave, you are met with warm smiles and leave feeling quite satisfied. It is a fact that they know how to run a successful business as high-quality food and superior service is their standard.  Sit at the sushi bar to ogle the fresh fish where friendly conversation is well-received and returned.  Brian, Stella and the hostess are very knowledgeable of the menu and attentive to all guests.   Appetizer: Fresh Salmon Spring Roll - This is light and refreshing. Salmon sashimi, shrimp, green salad, shiso leave, kaiware radish wrapped with rice paper. This is served with sweet sesame dipping sauce.  Roll:  Plum Tree - Tuna, salmon, and yellowtail wrapped in rice and topped with red, wasabi green and orange fish roe. The presentation was marvelous - I almost did not want to eat it because it was too beautiful! The flavors were rich and the crunchy texture of the roe paired well with the soft and creamy texture of the fresh salmon.  Dessert: Strawberry and Red Bean Ice Cream: Another beautiful presentation of lightly drizzled chocolate with mochi ice cream from the popular desert spot, Mikawaya (Los Angeles).  Chef Hiro and his brother recommended I try the Omakase ($45-65) - this seems to be the item of highest value as other high-end restaurants charge at least double of the price.   If you are in the area and would like to be served high-quality fresh foods with top-notch service, stop by Hiro Sushi!",

We started with Yellowtail Carpaccio which was quite good and a very reasonable serving size. This would make a good main course for a lighter appetite.  Our two rolls were \"Mermaid Roll\" and \"Plum Roll\" (which, we were told, was the chef's specialty). Both were good, and were *huge*.   We split an order of uni (sea urchin) which he liked more than I.  All in all - this was a *Lot* of food. Almost too much for two big guys. I would prefer smaller rolls - and then I'd get several, rather than one large roll each.  (Maybe they'll add a half-roll option?)  The total came out to what you would pay at any AYCE place, but the food quality was definitely a step up from that.   Not blown away, but very good and certainly more than satisfactory.

Price is not a issue when it come to great service and food. So when I got back to my work place to eat my 5 pieces of sushi my eel had bones in it not one bone and not two there were tons in every piece  to the point it just was more work to eat then enjoy.. I eat eel ever time I eat sushi and NEVER have had bones in it.. when I called the chef and he said it was normal that all eel does well now I know they serve bones in eel here.. I will go to another location I love up the street that does not serve bones in my rolls. I ordered seaweed salad,eel sushi and a soda for 24.00 craaazy.",

The credit/debit machine was down. We were given two options: 1) drive a mile down the road to an ATM to get cash for the bill, or 2) they would WRITE DOWN my card info (number, expiration, and security code) and manually run it after the server came back up. Obviously, I went to the ATM, paid the additional fee, and 20 minutes later was back with my wife (who I had to leave at the restaurant so we didn't skip on the check) to pay the bill. No discount offered. The ENTIRE meal should have been free. It is not my fault your equipment is malfunctioning. To ask a customer to leave their credit card info written down!? Get out of here.",

There are a lot of other shops around it so it might be hard to find, but it's right next to taco y taco with a large grand opening sign hanging in front. As soon as we walked in, literally everyone greeted us which was surprising. We sat down in a little booth that also had black curtains which came down half way to give a little privacy. I ordered the lunch special bento box with salmon teriyaki and chose the California roll for my side and a iced green tea.  I was first served a little side salad and a cup of miso soup. The salad was pretty basic but the dressing was really interesting, I have no idea what it was but I liked it.  Then my bento box came out and everything was mouthwatering! The salmon had the perfect amount of glaze and wasn't dry at all - like other places I've tried. The pork gyoza that comes with it was awesome also, too bad it's only 2 pieces :(. I wasn't a big fan of the egg roll as it was a bit mushy like baby food. Our servers were very attentive, my drink was always full, and we were always checked up on.  Also, check in on Yelp to get a free dessert! I got the green tea mochi and was expecting just one mochi cut in half (like most sushi places) but I actually got 2 on a plate decorated with chocolate and whipped cream.   I would definitely come back!",

While the people were extremely friendly and the restaurant was clean and had a great atmosphere, the food was sorely lacking in taste and quality. The rice in particular was terrible; not sure if it was a lack of water or over-cooking. The sushi was off as well, with the tuna being somewhat dry as if it had been out for a while, while the eel tasted overcooked. The avocado was not quite ripe; it affected the taste and texture. Definitely not going back.",

Ordered the following:  Karaage, Korokke, Beef Negimaki, Chicken Katsu Curry and Shrimp Tempura Sushi Roll Loved:  Beef Negimaki, Shrimp Tempura Sushi Roll Liked:  Chicken Katsu Curry Pass:  Karaage, Korokke Total came to $48 + tip. The price was a little high in ratio to satisfaction.  The Karaage were tiny pieces and tasted way overseasoned.  The Korokke was a little disappointing since the picture looked like 4 whole pieces, but when it arrived, it was actually 2 whole pieces cut into halves, so 4 halves...price seems high for 2 whole pieces, 4 would be more pleasing, even 3 more acceptable, but 2!? The Chicken Katsu Curry was plentiful and yummy and the shrimp tempura sushi roll was exactly as expected. The winner of the evening was the Beef Negimaki - I could eat this dish alone, just give me a bowl of rice to go with it and I'd be a happy camper. Great place to go for Japanese food if you are in the Henderson area.",
