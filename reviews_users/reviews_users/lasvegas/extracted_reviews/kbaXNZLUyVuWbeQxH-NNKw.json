    "text": "Went with a group of friends for a total party of 12 on Sunday evening for dinner.  Was completely blown away by the food.  Everything was fantastic.  To top it off, they opted to wait on us due to the size of the group.  The pulled pork was perfect, moist and full of flavor.  The brisket was really tasty and begged for their homemade BBQ sauce as the perfect compliment.  A side of pork belly was an overindulgence, but it was fantastic and almost started a fight as people were trying to steal pieces!  Any BBQ fan knows the staple sides, but Bell's takes it up a notch and goes gourmet on them.  We didn't try quite everything, but each one we had was phenomenal.  Mashed yams could easily be desert.  Potato salad with the just right amount of egg.  Crispy brussel sprouts were a huge favorite.  Beans were rich and flavorful cooked with the brisket.  Buffalo cauliflower was a surprising treat, and the okra fries were delicious.    No one ordered a dessert jar, but I'm sure we will the next time.    Do yourself a favor and check out Bell's.  Without question the best BBQ in the area.  Don't believe the hype about the cost - the price point is fantastic for the massive amount of food you get.    In fact, I'm going to get takeout for dinner tonight.",

The presentation was great, 2 pieces of Texas toast still attached at the bottom & open at the top like a pita.  The meat was loaded at the top and the sandwich stood on the connected bottom open end up.  I choice the house sauce and liked it so much that I added it to each bite of the sandwich.  The red beans and rice side was very tasty but a bit on the dry side for my taste but still very good. The staff is very friendly and I'm looking forward to trying more items on their menu, I recommend you try this family operated restaurant.",

She wasn't going to have any onions on it until I asked if they could make them gluten free.  They did, so basically I had a little batch of skinny onion rings!

The dining area is open and clean.  We were greeted immediately as we were browsing the menu.    I decided to try their chopped brisket sandwich, cheese grits and caesar slaw.  I liked how they cut the Texas toast into a pita like envelope.  The meat is then stuffed into the bread.  Clever! It was good but not memorable.  I had a taste of my husband pulled pork sandwich and had the same thought.  I wish the meat had more of a smokey flavor like other BBQ places.  The cheese grits, however, were so delicious! I loved every bite and could just eat the grits as my meal.   The caesar slaw was also just ok in my book.  I probably wouldn't order those again.    From all of the Yelp pictures we had to try the caramelized banana pudding.  It's served in a cute little mason jar.  The balance of cake to pudding to topping was a bit off but it was still tasty.    I wouldn't say Bell's is my favorite but I might try them again.",

    "text": "I'm rounding up, more like 3.5 stars because prices are a bit high. We rolled in around 1130am for lunch, and after perusing the menu for a bit we were notified that the brisket and 1/2 chickens were not ready. They don't offer a 3 meat sampler plate, but you can order a base plate and then 4 oz add ons on the side. So this concept is a bit different from other BBQ places.   I ordered the daily special, a BBQ rib sandwich, a side St. Louis Rib, and the BBQ beans as my side. My friend went with the catfish sandwich, which he enjoyed. They have regular BBQ sauce and a spicy one, which I didn't try. The regular sauce was sweet and tangy but not overpowering. My BBQ rib sandwich was delicious, topped with coleslaw on texas toast, and I managed to get 1/2 way thru before filling up. The BBQ beans are not for me, with the onion and pepper combined with brisket.   Where I felt it wasn't a great deal was the 1 St. Louis Rib add on for $2.95. This rib was not full of meat, but a bit thin so I felt like a bit overpriced. The flavor was good, the meat tender, but not really smoky....and I didn't see a smoke ring. I don't know where they keep their smoker. Next time I'll drive around back to see if its there.  Overall, good food at an ok price point for the area. Service was great, very friendly. The brother/sister team came through and talked to us as well as our server. I will be back to try that brisket!",

    "text": "After seeing a few IG pics(thanks Shirley B) I knew I needed to try Bell's BBQ. A very clean dining room with an open kitchen you get to see what going on with the food.  I opted for the pulled pork sandwich and some brisket on the side, with an actual side of mac n cheese. The pulled pork was stuffed between a thick slice of Texas toast perfectly grilled on each side. Brisket was still juicy and was melt in your mouth texture. Mac n cheese was also good, served with some crackers baked into it. I got to try some of my wife's St Louis ribs. I am a fan of Baby backs and she forgot to ask for them, they were a little tough for me but still had excellent flavor. I have bben back since and will definitely come back for some more of the BBQ in no time.",

    "text": "This place has really good reviews so we were excited to try it. The employees were friendly and helpful. I told them it was my first time there and they explained things well. I ordered the brisket, pulled pork sandwich and chicken strips to go. The pulled pork was quite good. Tender and not fatty. Barbecue sauce is flavorful. Chicken strips were good too. Red beans and rice were really good. Unfortunately the brisket was awful. I'm hoping maybe it was just a bad day because I've seen good reviews on the brisket. I ordered it lean. It came very fatty and not tender at all. It was chewy and I couldn't even cut it with a knife. Very strange since brisket is usually fall apart tender at other places. There was literally not one piece that was edible. It's pretty pricey too which is fine if it's good food. So we were very disappointed in that. I will probably try it again because some things were really good, just not the brisket.  So we tried Bells again and I updated to 4 stars. We had the pulled pork again which is quite good and tried the 1/2 chicken. The chicken was moist and flavorful. Still won't be trying the brisket again but my husband loves the red beans and rice so I'm sure we'll be back.",

I don't like much BBQ, because I can't stand when everything is covered in sauce (to where you cannot taste the flavor of the food underneath), so I was pleasantly surprised when I came to Bell's!  The atmosphere is definitely one of Southern hospitality - they will help you with just about anything you need, at any time. The staff are welcoming, knowledgeable, and polite.  The food here is spot-on. I have had (and recommend): BBQ Brisket (Cooked perfectly! No rubber here!) Shrimp Po'Boy (The shrimp are HUGE and are battered perfectly - and not greasy!) Shrimp Dinner (See comments about the shrimp - seriously - just get them!)  Sides: Yams! (Super delicious and creamy!) 4 cheese corn (don't fight it - just try one!) Okra fries (I HATE okra, so this should tell you something) Macaroni and Cheese Brussels Sprouts  It says something about an establishment when NO ONE speaks during dinner. The several times I have gone, the dining room was full, and everyone was QUIET.  I recommend this place to anyone who thinks of themselves as a BBQ connoisseur. I know I will be back!",

    "text": "It's about time there's a legit mom & pop barbeque joint here. It's called Bell's BBQ, and it's right here in Henderson.  --What's On the Menu-- Brisket, Pork Belly!! Pulled Pork,BBQ Chicken, St. Louis style ribs are a couple of the featured menu items. The menu is well rounded with combo meals with your choice TWO sides, Texas toast and pickles made in-house.   The variety of sides you can choose from include 3 cheese mac,braised southern greens, Okra \"fries\"), Smashed Yams w/brown butter & vanilla bean. The corn coblet is described as either plain or Parmesan-Asiago herb crusted! Bet you know what I'm getting next time! There are more listed on menu plus Chef John Bell mentioned they will be adding more in the next few weeks!  WOW!  There's also sandwiches. Someone order this and take a photo and post on Yelp please!! I saw a pulled pork sandwich being brought out to a table. The presentation of it is Yelp worthy! And for under  $10 with your choice of side is pretty sweet deal! The BBQ rubbed pan roasted catfish w/bbq tartar sauce sounds divine too!   --Super Family Friendly!-- The kids menu has mini corn dogs(toddlers love these!), grilled cheese, and smaller sized portion of the larger meals. For under seven bucks it also includes choice of side and a soda. (wonders how old you have to be to qualify as a kid to order ...hmmm)   --What's On My Plate-- I got the Pulled Pork meal and chose smashed yams and okra fries on this visit. Also ordered an add-on of brisket. The pulled pork came on top of the Texas Toast.  Both bbq meats are smokin hot! Perfect mix of meat & fat on pulled pork.. so juicy!  Flavorful & melt in your mouth. Yass!!! And the smashed yams with vanilla bean was insanely good! So were the okra fries..it's sliced and dipped in a corn meal batter I believe. Delicious!!! You'll be happy choosing those sides as I was. The side portions are pretty generous servings. The meats are very good quality,good portion size too and the price is right!    I also got St. Louis ribs for take-out for Mr. B. Dont miss out on these meaty and tender ribs!!!   Oh wait!! There's dessert!! In jars!  S'Mores, Caramelized Banana Pudding, Cheesecake with berries and Chantilly creme? A touch of gourmet twist on these Southern treats. Yasss! Save room for it! I got the S'Mores one. With brownies, marshmallow creme, chocolate mousse, PANNA COTTA, topped with chocolate ganache and krispies. Good stuff. No need to travel elsewhere for dessert.  --Ambiance/Location--  Fast casual style restaurant.  Order and pay upfront at the counter, seat yourself, and servers will bring food out to you. There's also take out too! My orders came out in timely manner.  Everyone on staff was friendly and helpful. Chef John was nice enough to answer my dumb questions. Really nice family friendly place.  Spacious, clean and mix of seating in dining area in way of booths with high back chairs and also dining tables that seats 4, but can easily combine tables for larger groups. You have upbeat country music playing in the background.  Location- Anthem/Green Valley part of Henderson. Bell's is visible facing Eastern Ave, just past Horizon Ridge, in the strip mall next to Pho Mailan. Or locals like me know the shortcut access entrance area off Sundridge (where Lee's Liquors is) and drive around the back.  Soft opening as of this visit with limited hours for now. Open for dinner at 4pm.  So check before you come. Back of take out menu and server told me extended hours coming soon!  --SUMMARY--  Go! NOW! Before this place gets super busy! Because it will! (actually it is busy) No more need to go out and drive another 15 miles away. The Henderson hood has Bell's BBQ!  Yass!",

Beef brisket had ABSOLUTELY NO BARK whatsoever, and it was sliced, part of the reason you slice is to get that great smoky bark flavor in every bite, mine had none.  Beef was dry and no smoke flavor at all. Tasted like roast beef with no seasonings.  Referring to ribs, I have to assume they were suppose to be smoked but again ABSOLUTELY NO SMOKE RING, and if they came off the charcoal grill,  that flavor was also missing.  Tough.  Now for positives, ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE BEST POTATO SALADS I HAVE EVER TASTED!  Black eye peas were good, and the Pork Belly was a little tough, but it did have some smoky flavor.   Don't know if I would order again, but if I did I will stick to sides.  Just keeping it REAL!",

I realized when I finished the meal that I was eating aluminum foil. The foil had pealed up and the paper was left under what was once foil. Plastic fork, Plastic knife served on aluminum foil.. All food was served on same foil tray. That included the salad I ordered and bread.. the aluminum foil got a little wet from the salad dressing and I think that's what caused it to peel and join the food I ingested. If this place is too cheap to serve a meal on a real plate then they have no right being in the restaurant business. The problem is they are just too lazy to wash dishes.. Too bad that comes with the business of owning a restaurant. Do us all a favor and turn it into a TAKE OUT joint so you don't have to have plates and silverware! Go to Lucille's!  They know how to do it RIGHT!!",

(Stouffer,s better and I hate frozen food).  Fried pickle boring and no flavor. Red beans and rice husband said just okay. Okra boring. Toast had a sprinkle of spice - Where did that come from!

In my opinion, the sides are just as important as the meats.  We had the pickled coleslaw which was different and just fair, the Mac n cheese  and okra fires which were very good, and the beans which were fair.  The ribs were cooked perfectly and meat just fell off the bone.  We ordered the s'more which comes in a small glass jar.  Although good, don't expect typical s'more flavor.  It's more of a gourmet s'more.  Very nice family owned restaurant, but they still have some kinks to work out.  I got the wrong plate, we had a missing side, and were overcharged for an extra drink, however they fixed the issues(we didn't bring up the overcharge).    They are only open for dinner right now, but are planning on expanding their hours in the next few weeks.  Definitely worth a trip to support a local family and get your BBQ fix.",

Cons:  sides sit a bit too long (crunchy brussel sprouts are soft, not crunchy).  And the togo order was packaged with the Texas toast under the entrees, leaving it soggy.  Another pro:  dessert!  Comes packaged in a glass bell jar (return it for a $1) - the banana pudding was good!  Nicely done BBQ and really enjoyed your sauce.  Welcome to the neighborhood!",

It's just not good.  On top of that the mac & cheese had no cracker crumbs on top ( which is what makes it so good ), and the \"pickles\" were cut to at least 3/4\" thick ... not sure who they're catering to with that .  I'm not sure what has happened ... maybe putting too many irons in the fire - I see that they're now doing breakfast ... who is going there for breakfast?  Maybe trying to do too much?  I loved this place when it first opened but I can't see myself going back here - at least for a long time until they sort out the issues.  For the price, it needs to be much better.",

I ordered the St. Louis ribs.  They were meaty and smoked perfectly. I cannot speak to the sauce as I do not eat sugar, but they did have sriracha available which paired perfectly.  My sides were the fried Brussel sprouts with bacon and the Southern style greens... both delicious!  They brine their own pickles... which rocked!  I don't know whether to try the pork belly or baby backs next time.... maybe I should get both!",

    "text": "Bell's BBQ is now open.   I am a big fan of BBQ and it is about time we have a very decent barbecue restaurant on Eastern Ave in Henderson.   My wife and I drove by and ate there just 2 hours after they opened their doors.  Chef John has 30 years of restaurant experience and he and his wife Stephanie were friendly and welcoming.    First the positives (and there are many).   The brisket is outstanding.   Tender and juicy and filled with flavor.   Many times it is difficult for a restaurant to get brisket to not  dry out but not at Bell's.   It was perfect.  We also tried some ribs (naked,  without sauce) and LOVED the rub used.   The ribs were meaty and did not need sauce but Bell's had 2 homemade sauces available.   For sides we tried the Mac n Cheese,  the southern greens and baked beans.   Of these,  you need  to especially try the greens.   I usually don't like greens but Chef John somehow made these taste pretty awesome.   The Mac N Cheese as well as the beans were tasty but compared to the rest of dinner,  were just average compared to other BBQ joints I have been to.     The biggest positive was the desserts.   You MUST try the Smores which were served in a glass jar.   Three kinds of chocolate,  marshmallow,  graham cracker  crust with a few cocoa crispies as a topping.   Yummy.   I would (and will) go back just for this dessert.   The negatives are few and pretty minor.   The hand printed menu board was difficult to read,  there was no TV and the location was a bit hard to find.   However,  go there once and you will remember because you will be going back time and time again.",

Didn't realize it came topped with onion rings, so others might get a better value than me(I also didn't get the free pickles that come with it). I did however very much enjoy everything else. The 4 cheese Mac with the ritz crumbles is on point. The sandwich hearty & tasty. All that meat wedges in between 2 big pieces of garlic toast. Another great option besides Sin City Smokers closer to home.",

Parking is plentiful here and as far as upon arrival it looks like a clean place. It is small, cozy & bright.  The people that work here are friendly and helpful. They do come by and check up on you and make sure that everything is good. So I ordered a brisket plate with a corn coblet, collard greens and an ice tea.  The iced tea taste good and seem to be freshly brewed. Corn cob tasted okay but lacked a little bit of flavor. The collard greens has bacon pieces inside and taste a little bit salty but was okay. They put the brisket on top of a thick cut of toast and topped it with some fried onions. The toast was thick and crusty , the brisket was moist and tasted pretty good, and the fried onions was a nice touch on top. The two barbecue sauce  bottles is on the table one is spicy and one is not which tasted yummy when dipped with the brisket. I will most likely come back again and try their other dishes!",

    "text": "Was disappointed by what Bells puts out as bbq. ordered brisket with a beef rib on the side. the order i picked up was more like 1oz of jerky on a bone and some of the driest brisket ive ever had.  i was shocked to see two bones in my beef rib order thinking id scored some extra meat. what i got though was an overcooked dose of mass amounts of paperlike membrane. the small amount of meat i did get was overcooked, dry, and almost jerky like in texture. brisket was just as overcooked it seemed. they tried to help by covering it with sauce (using a sauce different from the one i ordered and got on the side :-\\ ) but it didn't help.  sides were mediocre. mac and cheese was good onion straws were solid but nothing to go back for. nothing really was. ill stick to mulls and lucielles",

The cornbread was like nothing else, I got two huge pieces. The cornbread is almost like cake, and they toast it so there's a crunch. There were some items not available at the time of our visit but I will just have to go back and try some more options. It's kid friendly and they had a kids menu. My husband got the brisket sandwich and it was loaded with meat and the bread was thick like a Texas toast style. I would come here again because the menu is stacked and I would like to explore it sometime.",

    "text": "Honey has been craving BBQ, I remember seeing that photo of the cheesy corn. I put them both together and we took a ride to Bells.  Small, casual, and welcoming. Staff was friendly and  helpful. Great selection of food, so much I wanted to try. It was lunchtime so we split a St Louis Rib Dinner with Cheesy Corn, Garlic Mash, and Mac and Cheese, then we added a side of Brisket \"just in case\". Prices seemed a bit high. We didn't wait long for the food to come out. Everything was good, unfortunately the ribs and brisket were not great. A little dry,  we don't think it was smoked. I've eaten a lot of ribs and these were average like the ribs you ate at Uncle Joes Birthday Party BBQ you attended last week. Mashed, Mac, and corn and Texas Toast were all good. We both agreed the Old Fashioned \"sweet\" BBQ sauce was our favorite of the sauce choices. Now on to the dessert...I'd give it 5 stars if I could. I'd go back just for that. We tried the S'mores Jar. So delicious, not too thick, not too chocolaty. Love the cocoa krispies on top. Marshmallow was perfectly torched. I had to restrain myself from licking the jar. I really want to try the other ones. As a matter of fact, I want one now. I wonder if I can get one to go!?",

I did like how the sandwich looked when they brought it out, but it was very hard to eat like a normal sandwich. I ended up treating it more like a bread bowl.  As for the service, they needed a red bull or something. Between the girl and guy upfront, it took them 5 minutes to bag our food once it was finished. There was no other orders, it was just them dragging their butts.   I may try it again since it's close to my house, but it definitely won't be on my go-to dinner spot list.",

    "text": "Solid 4 for this place. Really wanted BBQ to take to the park and have a picnic with the kids after work on Memorial Day. Our first choice wasn't open (boo), so we decided to try Bell's. Not a bad choice.   Smelled insanely delicious inside. Smokey, earthy, sweet. But this place was packed!! I had the feeling they weren't prepared for the onslaught of people that had the same idea I did.   Their tiny dining room was jammed with hungry folks who were only getting hungrier from the intoxicating smells. But the peeps behind the counter were cool, calm, collected, and very professional. They apologized when food took long (which they advised guests of prior to ordering at the counter), and we're kind and patient. Hard to do when you're as weeded as they looked, but they pulled it off.   The food: again, a solid 4.  -My favorite was the pulled chicken. Tender. Not dry. Just enough chew. Smokey, although not really pulled as much as chunked. Atop Texas toast with seasoned salt. Yum.  -The smashed yams were fantastic.  -The St. Louis. ribs were good. A tad bit over cooked. Not very succulent and juicy like I like em, but great flavor.  -The chopped brisket was very peppery, again great smoke flavor, and not too fatty.  -Coleslaw was average. Not enough dressing in my opinion, but we ate it all.  -Crispy onion straws were good, but we're probably better fresh out of the fryer like most fried foods.  -The sauces were superb. Original. Spicy. BBQ ranch. Honey mustard. We are a saucey clan, and we liked them all.  -And the PICKLES!!! A+++!!!   Will return. Hopefully on a not as busy day, and will eat in. Can't wait to try the mason jar desserts.",

You get a free side by checking in. I ordered the Pulled Pork sandwich which came with 1 side and got my free one. I had the cheese grits and Brussel sprouts and the sides were exceptional. The sandwich was huge and was presented as a stuffed Texas toast sandwich. It was closed on the bottom and so it was easier to eat. There was PLENTY of meat like a dinner portion would have.  The staff was pleasant and stopped by to check in on us. My wife said the collard greens were much better than other places. The prices reflected the value and portion sizes.  All in all I'm really happy with this place.",

The meats (pulled pork is my go-to) and sauces available are truly mouth-watering, and I love that the meat is served on top of the Texas toast, turning it into a palate cleanser that also complements the rich flavors of your main dish. Their selection is sides is also to-die-for. Try the corn on the cob with cheese for added mmm!  Portions are sizable and the staff is super friendly.

There are some definite must haves: cheesy grits  fried brussel sprouts ( BEST THING ON THE MENU)  mixed fries    This is the very first time I've eaten southern food in Vegas and not been disappointed. Being a True southerner I totally understand I am a steep judge, however I must say this was tasty! You order up front and they sit and bring everything to you. The staff was super nice and the beer and tea cold. The meats were good but it seemed like all the food was missing salt ( and BLACK PEPPER- a southern staple!) The deviled egg potato salad and rice and beans were very disappointing. The rice and beans was more like decried beans with some rice on top- not the southern rice and beans that is spicy with sausage bits I'm used to. The deviled egg potato salad was super mushy and potatoes over cooked- also there was red pepper? Inside and no gherkins. We will definitely be back to try the chicken and waffles! Keep up the awesome work!!",

While we were waiting in line a woman with a \" Emotional Support Animal \" (a dog) was in front of us. When she went to order the owner very politely let her know he did not allow dogs inside the restaurant. She then told him it it was an ESA and she had the right to have the dog with her during her meal. The owner again very patiently explained that they had an incident where 2 \" ESA \" dogs had gotten in a fight inside the restaurant and a customer was bit.  The owner said that the woman was more than welcome to enjoy her meal with her dog in the outdoor seating area and they would bring her food out to her when ready.  She then insisted that they had to eat inside as her dog was allergic and or would try and eat the decorative plants in the outside area and again they must be allowed to sit inside.    The owner again explained that it was his policy and that she would not be allowed to sit inside with her \" ESA \" dog. She then threatened to call the Justice Department if she could not eat inside and again the owner said no, but was more than welcome to sit outside. At this point she stormed out.     The long and short of this is, the owner was more than accomodating to the lady and her animal, he was never rude, and gave her an option to still enjoy a great meal even after she was completely rude to him.   I will be eating here plenty more....lol!!  And BTW the crispy Brussel sprouts are amazing!!",

My favorite was the grilled corn! It was so sweet and crisp but then you get the surprise of the melted cheese that gives you just the right amount of saltiness. The deep-fried okra was very good too. And the brisket - so soft and tender I didn't even need a knife to cut it! Top that with their house BBQ sauce and you're set. Make sure to leave room for dessert coz those sweet jars are not to be missed. Red Velvet was so moist and not utterly sweet. Wait and then there's also Banana pudding that will remind you of the ones from Magnolia Bakery in New York.  The ambience is low key and very relaxing.  It has a very nice and welcoming vibe when you enter. The staff is very friendly and attentive. It's a local business that's not a franchise so that's a great addition to the neighborhood.",

I got three sides:    *Smashed Potatoes w/Smoke Roasted Garlic      Tasted two days old as if they were in the fridge and then they warmed them up in the microwave and put them in the box. Also, garlic? There was none.    *Crispy Brussel Sprouts       Drenched in so much oil; from the frying, that I could have squeezed it out into a pan and fried something else in it.    *Mac and Cheese       Eh. Super bland. Nothing to write home about.   But the meat, was delicious. Yum. Three stars for the great meat and amazing barbecue sauce.  Also, I lived in St. Louis for the last three years so barbecue was a staple in my house. Bummed on the sides but the actual barbecued meat and barbecue sauce rivals the St. Louis/ Kansas City barbecue.   Will try the ribs next time.",

I got the pulled pork, brisket and pork belly. They were too dry (except for the pork belly since it had a lot of fat). When I reheated the leftovers the next day for a very short while, they were so dry that I tossed them out. It's unfortunate that barbeque places here can't serve juicy meat with crispy edges. That was never a problem when I lived in California where I got delicious barbecue. I don't know what the problem is here. As far as sides, the mac & cheese was really good. The red rice & beans were just OK.",

I got the brisket sandwich. Love the toast but the sandwich was a little dry. Not sure what they could do to give it a little more flavor.

They always ask how you like your meal and can they bring you anything!  The brisket is tender and delicious either sliced or chopped and the chicken dishes seem like homemade. There are so many sides that it is hard to decide which one to order and they are also very unique like okra fries, which completely appeals to my southern roots! It's very reasonably priced and you leave feeling satisfied that you had a great meal. There are a lot of great places to eat in his locale, but, this is by far my favorite, see ya tonight!",

On the opposite spectrum, the mashed yams were a sweet balance, and very delicious. The brisket was good, a little on the dry side, but nice flavor. The barbecue sauce was great.  On the other hand, the cornbread waffle needs some improvement. It tasted more like batter, and not even like a waffle, let alone, a cornbread waffle.  The concept is great, if it were Real corn bread batter, cooked in a waffle. But it is not. And the sweet tea was good. But could have been a little sweeter.  Overall, great place, would have even been a five star if it weren't for the few key elements that were lacking, which make a Great barbecue spot.",

A lot of times you go into a BBQ place and the condiments are sticky and dirty from previous diners.  It appears they wipe everything down on the table after you leave - the way it should be done. It was a long drive since I live clear on the other side of town but worth the trip and I will be back.",

Our friends had eaten at Bell's many times and recommended it strongly. Ample parking in the lot. You order at the counter and they bring your food to you when it's ready. We decided to share the St. Louis ribs ($23) with 5 fries, Fried onions, and baked beans as sides (third side an extra $3). It also comes with Texas toast. The ribs come naked. You add your own barbecue sauce at the table (House sauce or spicy sauce are the options). The ribs were incredibly meaty and cooked to perfection. The fries were a combination of waffle fries, curly fries, sweet potato fries, and two varieties of traditional fries. While I liked the curly fries and the waffle fries the best, the combination was really enjoyable. I also loved the baked beans. The fried onions were just OK. The servers came around several times to make sure that we had everything we needed. Overall, informal ambience, very friendly service, delicious food, and reasonable prices. I will definitely be coming back here often.",

    "text": "Any place that has catfish, I'm so excited to try! The fish was perfectly breaded, seasoning was great annnnnd the best part.. every bite was super soft. You know how sometimes when you eat fish there are hard crunchy parts with no meat?! Lol. Definitely recommend getting that. My friends had the BBQ which I tasted: baby back ribs were good, super soft and tender.. juicy. The brisket was tasty, not dry at all. Sweet tea was pretty sweet.   Now, can we talk about the CORN ON THE  COB WITH CHEESE tho. The cheese was melted on the corn with an outside crunchy layer, literally melting in your mouth as you're biting into it.. yum! It's a perfect side dish. I was very satisfied leaving, even got dessert to go. Currently devouring my S'mores sweet jar. So bomb! Go try.",

We also got extra sides of pork belly a la carte , hot chicken wing which isn't a wing but more like a leg with chicken thigh deep fried in batter then slathered with tasty hot bbq sauce.  Portions were huge for the price and we had some left over to take home but I would recommend to finished the pork belly there when it is crunchy otherwise it is gross for later on Out of all the side dishes, I like the grits, Cesar coleslaws but I would like to try fried okra as one of the side and other items on the menu Definitely will be back .

But once I got there, I realized we needed dessert. So I picked up one banana and one S'more pudding.   The Brisket was chopped and served dry - definitely better with sauce. I preferred the Ribs. They weren't quite as fall off the bone tender as I've found other places, but the rub gave it some decent flavor.   The sides we chose slaw and friesX5 (mixed selection of regular, curly and crinkle cut). The slaw is mayo based with a little sweetness, which was nice.   Between the two puddings I thought the S'mores was better because it was a lot more rich.   It was nice to try another BBQ place in Vegas with friendly service. But I can't say that I would seek this place out after having found a few other places in town that I prefer.",

I personally don't eat red meat so I had the chicken breast tenders with the devil egg salad and assorted fries. The chicken tenders were long strips of tender breast meat with just the right amount of batter, so it wasn't too oily. It was placed on top a huge piece of Texas toast and onion strings. Mmmmmmm  Each plate comes with two sides of choice. They have so many different sides I couldn't pick just two, so I'd have to go back and try more.   And don't forget for all you Yelpers out there... $5 off your order when you check in!",

Cons: Service was not friendly, did not greet us, took order and looked miserable. Asked if we wanted to add a tip, when person taking order didn't do anything to earn it. Screwed up garlic mashed with potato salad, ignored me standing at front counter until another employee pointed me out. Price was way over inflated for what we received. Save your money and go to Dickie's for better BBQ or make the drive to Rollin' Smoke or John Mull's for the best BBQ in Las Vegas. Food: Everything was bland, temperatures and textures were wrong. Brisket was spongey, didn't feel like I was eating meat. Sandwiches were extremely stingy with meat, sides: mashed potatoes, egg salad, mac & cheese, coleslaw were all bland. Not sure how that managed to mess up everything they served. Pros: restaurant is extremely clean, in a good location, presentation of food was nice.",

Not even on the menu. . But they do have an awesome menu... lots of stuff to choose from which is why I will be back!  Pulled Chicken Sandwich- The chicken is served folded in Texas Toast style of bread... the bread/toast was good... and the serving size of the whole thing was really big. They definitely didn't skimp on the chicken. Unfortunately the chicken was sooooooo dry. I used a couple of their sauces to liven it up a little.  Brisket- Very dry. But luckily they have great sauces which again helped to liven it up.  Pork Belly- My partner absolutely loved it.... and that's a big deal! Flavor was all there, no dryness!  4 Cheese Crusted Corn Coblet  (side)- This is an absolute must! Very rich and yummy... not messy, comes on a stick, easy to eat.  Okra Fries (side)- Delicious! We were a little skeptical as their appearance is kinda blehhh. Paired with their homemade ranch was a home run. You don't even need the ranch.  3 Cheese Mac (side)- Disappointed. It was more like a very bland cheese pasta off the kids menu in an Italian restaurant. The kids scarfed it down. I guess I was expecting some awesome mac n cheese you would usually get at any BBQ Joint. I wouldn't get it again.  Sweet Jars!!- We ordered the \"Aunt Linda's Red Velvet\". Wow! We were fighting over bites. So moist, the perfect ending. Served in a cute mason jar. This will cure any sweet tooth cravings. Even if you don't want BBQ or anything to eat... stop by and get you or someone else a Sweet Jar! We are going back this weekend to try some other ones.  Sauces- Their BBQ sauce is an absolute win! It reminded me of one of my favorite sauces from back home. They have a great variety of other sauces too which were all good.",

    "text": "This is our second time going to Bells.  It was so good the first time we had to make sure we weren't just really hungry.  I am no BBQ connoisseur but I must say this place is really good!  Everything we had tons of flavor.  The second time we went we were actually on a \"whole30\" diet.  So we called ahead and asked if they could accommodate.  They prepare the half chicken with a rub and then smoke it.  They then flash fry it for a really crispy skin.  I know this sounds amazing but I could not have it this way because of the diet.  So they gladly put it the oven to finish it off!!  They went above and beyond to make sure our experience was awesome.  So many things to try next time when we are not dieting.  Make sure you try deserts!",

The brisket sandwich was a thick slice of bread with half of it cut in the middle then stuffed with brisket. The bread was heavily coated with butter then lightly toasted. The brisket was a bit dry but the bbq sauce saved it. The side of Mac n cheese was unimpressive. My wife's bbq chicken looked great but did not reach the point of falling off the bone like good bbq chicken should. The plastic knife and fork was challenging to cut through the bird. It may be worth another shot but for today, we should of stuck with the pho.",

Bells has a very diverse BBQ menu and 3 different BBQ sauces that are all amazing. Very big variety of sides which out of the 5 my wife and I had were all fantastic. The pulled chicken and brisket were both cooked to perfection. Not sure if it was a special but the Buffalo cauliflower nuggets were spectacular.  Price point I feel was spot on. Portions are large enough for 2 sittings. Large variety of craft beers and desserts that sounded amazing. I intend on going back just for dessert tomorrow. Just ran out of room for it.  If you enjoy BBQ give Bells a shot. They won't disappoint.",

    "text": "My husband and I ate here on Wednesday, January 10, 2018. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted immediately and were asked if this was our first time eating there. The menu items were explained in detail to us. My husband ordered the pulled-pork sandwich with a side of okra fries. I ordered the pulled-brisket sandwich with a side of roasted brussel  sprouts and an extra side of red beans and rice. Sandwiches come with one side and homemade pickles. Everything was delicious! They have a  small selection of beers (local and others) to drink with the BBQ. Their portions were decent size. The sandwiches were both on Texas toast bread which was toasted. What I loved about the sandwich was that the meat did not fall out; somehow they made it miraculously stay in between the two slices of bread, which was wonderful. The red beans and rice were good, I just didn't think it was spicy enough. The fried okra fries is a new twist(to me) on fried okra. They were very good. Crispy, light and not mushy. They have a bottle of BBQ on the tables along with wipes and extra napkins. Nice touch. We ordered of their sweet jar desserts to go; a Key-lime pie. The Key-lime pie was made of a chocolate crust versus a traditional graham cracker crust. My husband prefers the traditional crust; but said it was was really good.  By the way, we used $5 off when you check in with YELP. No problem.   The atmosphere was pleasant. Staff checked on us occasionally to see how we were doing and cleared our plates when were finished. Great service from start to finish! They have two televisions in there in case you don't feel like conversing with others.   I would recommend eating here. This is our new favorite BBQ place when we have a hankering for BBQ southern style.",

I tried pork belly for the first time here and i was mind blown. The skin was crispy but, the inside was juicy and fatty. The house pickles are amazing and so is the desserts. They serve all of their food on a baking sheet which i thought was super cool and unique. The desserts are served in mason jars that you can keep. I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for delicious bbq !!!",

I ordered a fairly large amount of food because there were several items that I wanted to try. I got Ribs, Catfish, chicken and waffles, about 4 different sides and of course the caramelized banana pudding sweet jar.   EVERYTHING.... and I do mean absolutely EVERYTHING was fantastic. The only other thing I can compare this too locally is John Murs spot ( which unfortunately is on the complete opposite side of town).  I told them I was new to Bell's and had never experienced their greatness. So they insisted that I walk away with one of each sauce. Thank you for that by the way. Options are good, but options with BBQ sauce is a must. Sweet, spicy, and the regular stuff. All of it had a little tang to it but I enjoyed it. I did the st Louis ribs this go around. Next time I have to try the baby backs.  Tip: ask about the cornbread. ( Jalapeno / Bacon) you'll thank me later.",

    "text": "Talk about nice small BBQ spot in Henderson. I have always heard about Bell's BBQ and literally pass by it every Thursday night before my cycle class. I finally decided this week get my recovery meal right next door after cycle class.   The menu is fairly straight forward comes to most BBQ joints from brisket, pulled pork, ribs, and can go on and on. I was in the mood for nice pulled pork sandwich for my first time. It was really good!! I like the fact they used more Texas toast style bread then traditional bun. It definitely is lot more filling bread. It looks massive the way whole sandwich stands tall with pulled pork pouring over the top and the topping of fried onions brought it all together. The crunch of the fried onion along with the moist. juicy, hot, and right amount of BBQ soaked in pulled pork. Solid. Nothing worst then over BBQ in pulled pork sandwich the bread way soaked after one bite not much of sandwich. No doubt pulled pork sandwich one of the best ones had comes to BBQ. The sandwiches comes with one side so went with the 3 cheese or mac and cheese. It was pretty tasty. One thing that stood out the type of pasta used in the mac and cheese. Spiral shape pasta instead of traditional elbow macaroni. I like the way cheese gets all in-between and cheesy goodness just soaks it all in. It creamy cheesy cheesy not heavy but there still nice stringy cheese with every bite. I got another side of Crispy Fried Onion. Probably not good idea when I realize it was to late it was on top of my pulled pork sandwich. It really good more so if dip it in the ranch sauce comes with it on the side.   The service was fabulous. The gentlemen took my order was friendly, told him was my first time, and explained everything on point. Positive vibes. Once got my food made sure check up see if everything was ok and if needed anything. Five star service for sure!!!   So many other goodies on the menu definitely need make it more of regular recovery meal spot Thursday nights.",

The first thing is when I pulled up to pick up the order, there was no \"smoke smell\", It was around 5, so the smokers should still be fired up.  Decor was nice, staff was friendly, even threw in an extra beef rib because they were \"small\" all together we ordered: 3 Bone Beef Ribs with Okra Fries, 4 Cheese Crusted Corn Coblet Add 1 St. Louis Bone Add 2 Baby Back Loin Bones Add 3 Salt and Pepper Crusted Catfish Fillets Cameron's Southern Fried Chicken Breast Strips with Mashed Yams and 3 Cheese Mac Buffalo Fried Cauliflower  The mac and cheese was bland, no flavor, just pasta in sauce, topped with cheese and cracker  The Mashed yams tasted exactly like that, yams that were cooked and mashed, that's it, nothing added to them, we had to add some butter and brown sugar.  All of the Ribs, were tender, just about fall off the bone, but had little to no seasoning, and lacked any \"smoke\" flavor at all  The chicken tenders also had little/no seasoning  The sauces were alright, and I loved the salt n pepper catfish, didn't care for the crusted cheese corn or the buffalo cauliflower  If i did eat here again id only order the salt n pepper catfish",

They are small but pack a mighty punch with all their in-house sauces and sides, let's not forget about the tart little pickles. The \"small family BBQ joint\" feel like back east is a a big bonus for me. I had the pulled pork plate with a couple baby back ribs, a side of deviled eggs potato salad and Cole slaw. I used both the old fashioned and house BBQ sauces. I couldn't decide which one I liked more. The old fashioned had a bit more of a tomato base and the house was a bit more molasses. Both had a slight vinegar taste that I grew up with. The pulled pork was delicious and moist, the baby back ribs were served dry and unfortunately I would say the meat even after a heavy dose of sauce was still a bit dry all be it still delicious to taste! The potato salad was on point, nothing more to say it was great. The cole slaw had fantastic flavor I wish they had chopped the cabbage a bit smaller. One of my favorite touches are the absolutely delicious home made pickles! They tasted just like the ones my mom used to make. The staff was very friendly and attentive like you'd expect if it was a big corporate establishment.",

Their sides are on the other hand Great!  The brisket was moist and tender, no smoke ring and not the back you get from an offset smoker.  They have about 4 sauces they were really good. Glad I ate here and you will be happy you did too.",

    "text": "So I didn't want to write a review so much that I waited a week, because I end up heading out of town for Xmas two days after the Hubby and I visited Bell's. So last Saturday on 21st, we decided to check it out since we live in Henderson, we pull up guy outside talking on his phone, I looked at him and we continued inside. About twelve minutes later he entered through side door and came up to front and started looking to see where the staff needed help in preparing orders, so my first red flag was him by passing the wash sink. As he proceeded to roll up his sleeves, and touching food on table I say so, he's not gonna wash his hands? Less than one minute later he goes over to wash sink(that's in plain view) and proceeded to wash. So in the meantime my Husband is ordering and I asked cashier are the beef ribs tender? And she says yes, they are. I said ok I think they were 16.95 or 18.95 not sure bc I only glanced up and I didn't pay. So we order 2 spare rib bones, half of chicken, a hot link, Caesar salad, red beans and rice and the greens. I have to say when I home I was angry and disappointed, the beef ribs were horrible, so tough, the beans and rice bland, the greens, OMG no ma'am or sir, we tried to doctor on them but hubby was so upset. The chicken was edible, the salad, the hot link and the spare rib was ok...So after opening and tasting I end up calling them with in 30 mins of just leaving and the Lil guy that was helping told me that the Owners had just left and that he would have them call me, I gave him my number, and to no avail he never called. And so that's why I'm telling.....we will continue to travel to the other side of town if when we want BBQ from a restaurant...",

    "text": "With so many mixed reviews I was waiting for the kinks to get worked out before trying out Bell's. Unfortunately the food was a big let down. First off, it was over $16 for the brisket meal which came with two sides and one piece of texas toast. Just way over priced for one person. I really wanted to try the banana pudding in the jar but that would have brought it over $20 just for a bbq plate.   The brisket was served on the toast which I didn't get. If I wanted it on bread I would have ordered a sandwich. The first few pieces of brisket were extremely dry and tough which made it hard to chew. The 3 cheese mac n cheese lacked any \"3 cheese\" flavor, it was just a bland sauce. I did like the BBQ beans however, great flavor with pieces of brisket.   I also liked how it was decorated inside, but if the food dissappoints, Im forced to give 2 stars as I have had much better BBQ. I am definately willing to give Bell's another try as I really want to try the banana pudding jar. Maybe I will order the pulled pork or ribs next time and have a better experience.",

Curly, regular, waffle, yam, crinkle, etc all in the same order!  The smashed potatoes with roasted garlic was also excellent, however, a little deceiving... Its really just smooth creamy mashed potatoes (no chunks).  The brisket which was served on texas toast and topped with fried onions was good.  A touch on the dry side though.  I was also hoping for a little bark on the brisket, and a little more composure of the meat... ie I don't really care for the meat falling apart on its own.  I'd rather have a little more chew to it.  The BBQ sauces offered were ok, but to me a little sweet (all of them).  The mustard-based BBQ sauce was probably my favorite.  Also tried a red velvet cake sweet jar.  They are really not kidding when they say SWEET jar.  It is really sweet!  Little too much for me, but my kid liked it.  Not bad prices, everything was fresh.  Great place for a quick BBQ bite!",

The customer service is top notch, after visiting about 2 months after our first visit, the owner remembered my husband and I, even where we sat in the restaurant! You order at the counter, then seat yourself but there is always a server offering refills and taking away dishes. They have a lot of different menu options, we have tried several main course meats as well as several side dishes. We were lucky enough to have their pork belly the first visit, the second visit we were too close to closing and they had run out. The pork belly is by far the best I've ever had, and the home made pickles, as well as pickle chips are some of the stars, in my opinion. The sauces are delicious, especially the mustard! Portions are huge, appropriately priced, and overall delicious. YOU MUST GET THE FLUFFER NUTTER SWEET JAR FOR DESSERT. (That's the only one we have tried but I'm sure the others are just as good) My husband and I split the dessert and were fighting over who got to take the last bite. We even had some the next day, and the mousse turned into a fudge-like consistency and it was the most decadent dessert I've ever had. Overall phenomenal service and food. This is on the top of our list to bring family and friends to when they come to visit!",

Food is better but I stand behind my original comment that the food is oversalted.  My son wouldn't eat more than a few bites of his chicken fingers so we brought it home.  I was going to eat the leftovers for lunch but couldn't get past the salt lick.  Too bad, as the tenders looked very appetizing.  The brussel sprouts could have been addictive if not for a bit too much salt - and I love salt!  Brisket was  very tasty and tender, fried okra perfect, fried green tomatoes terrific.  My husband had to have an extra order of the buffalo cauliflower because he loved it so much.  Portions are very generous.  St. Louis ribs were ok.  Cute idea with french fries to have several different types in one order - regular, waffle, curly, crinkle cut.  Nice local place but lay off the salt please!",

We ordered ahead of time and our order was just being packed when I arrived 15 minutes later -- that was quick! Everything was remarkably good, but we wish someone warned us that a full rack is easily 2 full meals (for us anyway). We enjoyed the other half of our 1.5 racks the next night for another dinner (and the following day for lunch).  My husband really liked the house sauce and I can definitely recommend the spicy. We had a variety of sides: beans, okra \"fries\", hoppin' john, cole slaw, and greens, all of them a-ok. I guess it's traditional, but there was really no need for the Texas toast, we ended up throwing them out from both dinners (we would rather spend the carbs and fullness on the other yummy stuff). We are really happy Bell's is so close to us and will definitely be back -- maybe we'll actually eat in next time!",

Not only was it here within 20 minutes, but it was hot, great presentation, everything wrapped correctly, nothing spilled=BBQ sauce!  The brisket was tender and no fat, hubby had pulled pork ribs sandwich on Texas toast and it was huge!  I loved the the smashed yams with vanilla and brown sugar. We shared the banana pudding dessert in a jar and it was incredible. Thank you for such a great dinner and we got to stay home!!!!!",

We both wish we had went to the pho restaurant. The service was okay, the cashier was REALLY pushy about their creamed kale, I guess it was a limited time item. The prices were way too high for the quality of food. I ordered the brisket, yams, and cheese grits. My boss had the pork belly, cheese grits, and Brussels sprouts. The food looked good enough, but digging in was not as pleasurable as we wanted it to be. My brisket was dry and cold, and smothered in their sauce. If they really do smoke their meat, you could never tell because of the sauce drowning. The yams tastes disgusting, like they were made with tap water from the wash sink, and they were also cold. The cheese grits were alright but didn't rock my universe. There are much better places to eat in the area, and we won't ever be going there again.",

    "text": "This is very good restaurant. Others have referred to this as a mom-and-pop place.  While it is family owned, I think \"mom-and-pop\" is a misnomer and implies a casual approach to food preparation.  This, on the other hand, is great food by a talented chef.  The menu is \"deep,\" with lots of choices.  The flavors of everything I've had were bold, not the usual bland tastes we're finding at more and more restaurants.   Everything appears to be made in-house and was very fresh.  And, until they get a better sense of how much they need when, I'm willing to put up with their being out of some items in exchange for this freshness. The details:  I've had take-out once and eaten in twice. Baby back ribs had lots of fall-off-the-bone meat.  Very flavorful and were not covered in sauce.  I consider this a sign of good meat and good preparation.  Other similar restaurants seem to be covering up their product with lots of sauce.  A vinegar-based sauce was provided in a separate container.  Catfish \"add-on,\" that is, a small portion, is delicious.  Plenty for lunch.  Ask for the tartar sauce - it has some extra kick in it. Cole slaw and fried onions were very good.  As with everything else, portions are very large - enough for two when ordered as an \"add-on.\"  The \"red devil\" potato salad was delicious - the potatoes had good texture and the dressing unusual but sure to become a favorite.  Baked beans had great depth of flavor due to addition of peppers and plenty of brisket.  The pickles were a great surprise.  I've never had freshly brined ones - very crisp and a great counterbalance to the ribs and fish. Dessert for me was a classic creme brulee...but served in a cute little glass jar.  They have other choices. Another good feature:  the carryout containers are high quality -- no styroform.  They were thus leak and drip proof.  It looked like they had a good selection of beers.  There was also Woodbridge wine.  Other beverages were available from a soda fountain setup.  Although customers order from the front counter and then the food is brought to the table by servers, this doesn't have a sterile, takeout kind of vibe.  The lighting is nice and people seem to linger at their tables enjoying another beer.",

They added on the tip when we ordered our food so we felt obligated to do 15% and all the girl did was bring out our food.  We didn't see her again.  This is not a sit down, order and be served restaurant, this is a walk up, order, get your own drinks and have your food brought out to you restaurant.  My husband had a full slab of what was supposed to be baby back ribs that were tough and fatty, I had the 1/2 BBQ chicken that was dry and chopped up oddly so I kept chewing on bones, my older son also ordered 1/2 slab of baby back ribs (again, very tough and fatty) and our youngest son had the mini corn dogs which were over cooked. Even though everything else was bad, we decided to try one of their sweet jar desserts.  We got the banana pudding and that took about 15 minutes to get and it was not even remotely good.  The best thing about the meal was the iced tea, I mixed half regular with half sweet tea.  I've had lots of different BBQ and this is one place I would never go back to and will not recommend it to anyone.",

I'll also say that Bricket  isnt my top choice, but I saw someone eating it and I changed my order. Im very glad I did, it tasted great. Cooked perfectly, nice smoke ring, and it was a good sized sandwich. It comes on a double sized texas toast bun, something ive never seen before, but its twice the size of a normal bun. It was filled with meat, not all bread. Very cool. I also ordered the Banana pudding. I got home and i was wondering why it weighed so much. It comes in a glass jar!!!! Its a decent size portion, and it taste great. Couldnt be more happier. My buddy also ordered the pulled chicken sandwich and he loved it. He had the Onion strings and loved them. All in all a great BBQ, and im heading back very soon for the 10 Bone St Loius ribs. Cant wait. The only issue is there not open for lunch. They said they would be soon, but nothing yet.",

I placed my order over the phone three minutes to closing time, and Twila (hope I spelled that correctly) was nice enough to accommodate me, even though I know better than to order near closing time. She was so helpful and informative and I let her order her suggestions for me, telling her I was open-minded. The half-chicken was perfection with juicy meat and I could not eat it all. One huge beef rib was so tasty, I just wish there were more meat on this particular one, as I like beef better than chicken or pork, but that is the way it is with beef ribs. I had the zucchini medley like a salad-type zingy tasty treat, charred collard greens? which were delicious and I dipped them in bbq sauce. There was Frank's bbq sauce-type fried spicy cauliflower and a thick piece of bread. My favorites were the key-lime pie and the cheesecake desserts. They were each served in real glass mason jars. I thought to myself that this cannot be a cost-effective way for a restaurant to serve its tasty treats, but my homemade candle-making will appreciate it! Overall, I LOVED the sauce and the rubbed rib flavor, and the EXCELLENT SERVICE will keep me a loyal customer. We need more restaurants like this! Congrats!",

It is a simple place in a strip mall but nicely appointed and comfortable. They offer a number of entree plates along with sandwich plates and more sides than we had ever seen in a BBQ restaurant before. I had the brisket plate with mac n cheese and their southern greens, the wife had the pulled pork sandwich (wow) with the Brussels sprouts. There was nothing left on either plate. Even then we had to try one of the sweet jars their signature dessert. We had the cheesecake which again was excellent. They let us try a new thing they will soon have on the menu, buffalo cauliflower...yum! The only caveat and it is minor, was they need to step up the flavor of the ranch dressing served with the buffalo cauliflower dish. Sort of bland. We left there stuffed and contented and plan to return again soon.",

And when I say hard, I mean chewing on your shoe hard.  This is coming from a guy who will eat the hardest and driest beef jerky around.  It felt like taking $15 and throwing that $15 in the garbage.  It was like paying to eat old gum off the bottom of my shoe.  Avoid at all costs.  Brisket:  3 stars.  This was a lot better but just about anything would be better than the beef ribs.  It was average at best.  Somewhat soft, decent amount of fat, but basically no taste.  My family took one bite and we all started dumping their sauce on it.  GREAT brisket doesn't need sauce and is so soft and juicy, it's like a softer filet mignon.  This was like fatty tri tip.  3 cheese mac:  3 stars.  It was cheesy but could've used some seasoning.  But a decent amount of it.  So average.  Caesar salad:  4 stars.  Tasty.  The guy behind the desk assured me this was great BBQ.  I've had far superior BBQ than my initial trial run.  I'll give this place another shot and try their pork ribs before completely writing it off. But half of our dinner on this first pass went straight to the trash.",

If you are in the Eastern area I would highly recommend stopping by Bells. We have been going there for a while and this review is long past due but let me break this down like Wreck It Ralph for you.   We found the place after searching a gluten free app for a place my daughter can eat; before you make a comment of, \"oohhh your one of those\".... My daughter has severe stomach pain when she consumes gluten so this is not simply a TMZ OMG a Jenner was slipped some carbs moment.  Anyways, we stopped in and the staff was super helpful and friendly and told us about the process they take when making the gluten free chicken fingers, which I must add when I took my dad tax from my daughters plate they were quite delicious. Our other little humans ordered mac and cheese and the mini corndogs and of course they loved it. The wife and I ordered Brisket and Pork Belly.   I feel like the pork belly deserves its own section in this review... We have been to Korean bbq, sushi joints, lots of establishments that serve succulent slabs of swine stomach but this plate comes to our table in the hands of server looking like they are carrying a an emperor of meat on a padded bed while being fanned with palm fronds.  Okay, well maybe not palm fronds but it is still awesome. They did not skimp, it was piled high and was for sure a meal in your mouth treat that was smoked to perfection.   As for the brisket, it was also cooked by what seemed to be a pit-master runner up... Now, I say runner up because the first place people usually sputter out after the competition and the runner up ends up being insanely succesful. If you are questioning my logic here you need to watch more American Idol. The Brisket was awesome, it was juicy and had a nice bark and great smoke flavor and once again there was no attempt to skimp on the portions.   Lastly, sides are not to be forgotten and honestly I want to refrain from telling you my favorite because I have gone to Bells since and had days they are sold out. So me telling you the best side is like a fisherman giving up his honey hole. Okay.... It's the buffalo cauliflower...   Lets Review, If you are hungry, and you want to meet an awesome staff that really takes care of the patrons and a kitchen staff that clearly wants to put out a good product then this is a great place to try out if you are in the area.",

    "text": "Gave Bell's BBQ a try yesterday.  Their menu is extensive and goes beyond bbq.  Shrimp and grits, chicken and waffles, chicken fried shrimp are a few of the options that stood out to me.  We stuck with bbq this visit and ordered a full rack of baby backs, added on brisket, hot links and salt and pepper catfish.  We chose 3 cheese mac, deviled egg potato salad, mashed yams and corn bread for our sides.  Sweet tea to drink and banana pudding for dessert.  Total for all this was under $60.  Highlights were catfish (with bbq tarter sauce!) and hot links.  Fave side was the corn bread.  It's grilled and almost cake like.  Least fave side was the deviled egg potato salad.  They have over 20 sides so there is plenty of other options for next time.  There was an issue with their card system when trying to pay.  Took quite awhile and ended up just having to ring me up on another register.  Seemed like we should have done that from the beginning but I would have been waiting for my order anyway so really didn't matter.  The cashier was very nice during the whole ordeal.    There is a $5 off $25 yelp check in coupon.  I used it the first time but I think when she had to ring it up again on the other register it was forgotten.  Per owner comment below it is only for dine in.  That is fine but then she shouldn't have marked it redeemed and given me the discount the first time she rang up the order.",

As expected, it was busy but anywhere Fathers Day is going to be busy. We ordered our dinner and sat at a booth. The food came out about 10-15 minutes later, not bad considering how busy they were. I ordered the brisket (Cornbread/Fries). The food was absolutely delicious. I loved the different sauces on the table to put on the meats. The brisket was so great! The cornbread tasted almost like a slice of cake and the fries were top notch. I also tried the pulled chicken, Mac n Cheese (The BEST I've ever had), chicken fingers and Beef Rib. All amazing. So for 3 meals, drinks and extras, we spent $65. Money well spent! I will be back for sure.",

I ordered the pan grilled catfish for $17. Both came on a piece of massive came Texas toast and two sides. Everything was huge except for the catfish which was greasy and then covered with fried onion tanglers. The seafood was certainly not worth the high cost we paid for it.

Great charm with how they present items with mason jars. Would love to see them find a better solution for someone who wants to try multiple beef or pork items - instead of having to buy a full item of just one meat. Late lunch for two with one drink and a dessert coming in at over $40 seems a little unreasonable. Seniors have good deals that should be given to anyone who wants to try several items. Rooting for them to do well. But they need to find a solution where you can try a little of everything at a fair price.",

I had their fried okra as a side and it was prepared like french fries, a first for me...  However, the okra was fresh and tasted great. There was some kind of house sauce with the okra that also tasted pretty darn good.   The only issue I had was that I ate so much that I had no room for desert....

    "text": "If brisket is your first menu item, and the most expensive, I will drive 30 miles out of my way to give you a try. The brisket wasn't their best item on the menu, but I'd keep Bell's in mind if I were on this side of town again.  Menu features the choice of a meat plate (8oz with two sides, house-made pickles, and Texas toast) or a sandwich, and you can add on additional meats (~4oz?), as they don't have multi-meat combo plates. Sides of mac and greens were just okay.  PORK BELLY: The highlight. Was surprised to see it on the menu, but it ended up being the best thing. Tender, falling apart, juicy, and full of flavor. Wish I'd just ordered this! BRISKET: Close, but no cigar. Nicely seasoned with visible smoke ring, but the meat itself was dry and hard in spots. I suspect this is because it wasn't all that fresh, being that they're new and not quite so busy yet. I'd give this another try on a future visit. PULLED PORK: No. This was the oddest meat in the meal, cut into odd pieces and drowning in sauce, portion also seemed smaller than the others. Meat was very tender but sauce was overly sweet, did not care for this at all. RIBS: Got the St. Louis style, add-on. They're large and meaty, but BF found them a bit too fatty for his liking. I'd get them again, but kind of wish they came sauced, as the cups provided for takeout make it an odd fit for dipping the bone without making a mess. Pleasantly surprised with these!  DESSERTS. I'm not big on desserts, but I couldn't resist the cute jar presentation! Opted for the cashier's favorite, the S'mores. The graham cracker crust bits were on the clumpy side, but the rich, chocolately mousse tasted just like hot chocolate and the browned marshmallow fluff on top was nicely subtle.  Service was welcoming and friendly, interior is clean and modern with country decor touches- love the strands of lights above the dining room! Rounding up for potential, will come back as they get settled in and work out the kinks.",

I ordered a variety of meats and sides. the meats mostly tasted okay but were obviously reheated. I could not see a smoker but could smell the smoke. When I asked what type they used, the gal replied hesitantly, Apple I think. Smelled stronger than apple. The pork Belly was fresh and crispy, the sides were just okay although the fried cauliflower was good.The sauces were good. The Smores jarred dessert was cold - I guess I expected it to be hot but was tasty. The place was not busy at all- Two Tables in the middle of lunch hour..so? but in a great location.",

We both had the Pulled Pork, reallllly good~ nicely prepared, fully cooked juicy & tender. Could have been hotter, temperature wise for my tastes, however my husband didn't seem to mind. We both ate all of it so it obviously was fine.    Typical BBQ SELECTIONS, ribs, pork belly, brisket & Chicken & they also have a kids menu ~ and nice dessert options if you have any room left to indulge in banana pudding, creme brulee, Jordon's Cheesecake and more just can't  remember them all.     Lots of sides to choose from, smashed potatoes (YUMMO!) , corn on the cob (nice! not over cooked with a smidgen of butter, 2 different types of cold slaw, pickled & Caesar style (hubs had the pickled & quite enjoyed it) southern prepared greens (again my Hubs ate these & thought they were Gr8!) The sides we didn't try, smashed yams, Okra fries, 3 cheese Mac n' Cheese I am sure I have left something out but as you can see Lots to choose from~    Nice interior with booths & tables to accommodate 70 guests, nice strings of lights draped from the ceiling all add to a pleasant dining environment. All the servers genuinely friendly greeting us upon entering AND exiting       Currently just open for dinner, have take out ordering, catering will offer lunch after they complete their soft opening. Everything went like clockwork for our visit, so if your in the mood 4 BBQ, stop by Bell's & prepare to carb load!!",

I loved the baked beans--they are a variety of beans & not just the same 'ol jazzed up jar of Bush's like some other places I've been. The desserts were really impressive. They are served in a glass mason jar (even if you get it to-go) and were as tasty as they are beautiful. I might have to take my jar back for a refill!",

The pulled pork is good, not the greatest that I have eaten but still very tasty. The brisket is great, both times that I have been here I get it and it has yet to disappoint. Pork belly was phenomenal, I could have chowed down 10 pounds of it!! The staff is friendly and courteous, the food comes out quickly as well.",

    "text": "So I ordered baby back ribs with cheesy grits and \"smashed\" potatoes. My husband got brisket with potato salad and \"Hot Tots\" which describes them as hot links with ketchup. I prefer my ribs dry because if it's done right you don't need sauces to make it moist, flavorful, and tender. First the \"smashed\" potatoes were garlic mashed potatoes and not \"smashed\". Chef needs to know difference. Grits were extremely dense, but good. Brisket and ribs no real flavor until I added salt or when BBQ sauce added. It's all about the meat when it comes to BBQ, not just sauce. Tender enough for me with ribs, but boring flavor. Brisket tender enough, but very boring in flavor.  Back to \"hot Tots\". Describes them as hot links, but they were tator Tots with a little bit of sausage. Not described properly. Been there several times for breakfast and always great. The cornbread offered is.             awesome. Offer all the time. You should offer breakfast all the time because that seems to be the successful menu. Actually threw away almost half our meal after spending a lot of money  because nothing was worth saving. Everything was pretty boring. I did not originally give this place 3 star, but it was changed from 2to3 after posted",

The macaroni was dry and tasted of cornstarch, the cheese grits didn't have enough liquid so it became a solid block with no flavor, the brisket was dry (hence the need for so much bbq sauce), the fried okra was too salty, and the St. Louis ribs were cooked in a flavorless rub. The best parts of the meal were the mashed yams, bbq sauce itself, Devyns pickles, pulled pork, and the fluffer nutter dessert. That's very unfortunate because I was excited for a new bbq atmosphere besides the food chain of famous Dave's, but I know I won't be back.",

The brisket sandwich is between Texas toast and is so tender and delicious. The amount of sides to choose from is incredible. The three cheese corn is my personal favorite. The prices are very nice as well with the amount of food you receive. The sweet jars for dessert are so tasty and I love that you can return your jars for a raffle.

    "text": "Found this place through TripAdvisor and thought I would give it a try with my cousin one afternoon. Best decision ever. As we walked in, we were immediately greeted with friendly employees. Since it was our first time, the employees gave us multiple suggestions, as well as had me sample there newly added side of Buffalo Fried Cauliflower. It was delicious, so of course I had to get that as one of my sides. I had ordered the Pulled Pork which came with the choice of 2 sides, Texas toast, and pickles. I was also able to get one additional side for free through yelp. They have SEVERAL sides to choose from! However, I went with the Buffalo Fried Cauliflower, 4 Cheese Crusted Corn Coblet, and 3 Cheese Mac. The portions were very generous that I definitely had to ask for a togo box. The older lady who was serving us was VERY sweet! Continuously made sure that we were doing all right, filled our drinks, etc. The 4 Cheese Crusted Corn Coblet was really good, the outermost part was crusted with cheese and in the middle was melted cheese that was \"stringy\" with every bite I took. The 3 Cheese Mac is one of the best Mac and Cheese sides I have ever had! There is no way to describe the deliciousness, you just have to try it on your own. The Buffalo Fried Cauliflower came with multiple pieces of deep fried cauliflower with buffalo sauce inside and was served with your choice of ranch or bleu cheese. The Pulled Pork was served upon a piece of Texas Toast and with crispy onion strings on top. They don't marinate it in BBQ sauce or anything of that sort because there is an entire rack filled with different types of BBQ sauces that you can choose from. All of which are very tasty. Although I was stuffed to the max, I couldn't walk out without trying one of there desserts. I ordered the Creme Brulee which was served in a mason jar. It was rich and creamy, not too sweet, just perfect. Only downside was that I think the price for desserts are a little too high. It was about $6 for the portion they served. Overall, this place is amazing and I definitely will be going back to try out other options.",

Excellent taste and spicy level was perfect.   I also really liked the Caesar slaw. Genius! The boyfriend ordered a side of the pork and said it was good. A happy boyfriend makes my life easier. The mashed potatoes were a little boring for my taste... but a little spicy bbq sauce fixed them right up.   The service was very friendly and helpful. Kudos to smiling staff - it really makes a place standout. I can't wait to try more options from the side menu and maybe check out a dessert jar.

I couldn't decide between 3 stars and 4 stars, but decided to go with 3 because I'm on the fence and couldn't get passed their fried okra.  So, to put the visit in a nutshell and cap the food: their meats are good. My brisket wasn't as hot as I'd have preferred in when served, but it happens. Their sauces are delicious, so I was happy.  What I was VERY disappointed in was their fried okra. The okra was mushy. Fried okra is not supposed to be super mushy. Sorry. Not good. I think part of it is the way they cut it like french fries rather than in rounds like most places do (including how my grandma used to make fried okra.)  Bell's leaves a little bit to be desired, but if you're in the area and have a hankering for some bbq, I wouldn't count this place out by any means.   Would I come back here? Probably.  Would I recommend this place to others? Absolutely, with the caveat of \"do not order their fried okra.\" Lol.",

Food is great, multiple variations of awesome BBQ sauce, even a gluten free option. The sides were amazing, and the portions are huge. It's pretty hard to find decent BBQ, most places are just crappy chains. Not to mention the entire establishment was insanely clean, bathrooms included. Believe me, that does not go unappreciated. Was happy to find one that broke the mold here in Vegas. Will definitely be coming back.",

The ribs arrived pre-sliced with a small quantity of BBQ sauce applied to each.  Had I known, I would have requested them served intact without sauce.  The ribs were hardly fall off the bone tender and the smoke/rub was only faint.

Yes, that have all the regular BBQ basics...ribs, chicken, pork, etc.  in addition, they offer items the others don't. House specialties, if you will...  Shrimp and Grits - Outstanding!  Beef Ribs - Best I have ever had anywhere!  Sweet Jars - Small desserts...just the right size. I would tell you my favorite, but I have eaten them all and haven't found one that isn't my favorite.   House-made pickles.  5 choices of house-made BBQ Sauce including a gluten free option if that is important to you.   No matter what you desire, they have you covered.   Worth the drive if you eat there or take home or have it delivered.  Yes we are blessed in Henderson.   Thank you Bell's!",

As a guy who's spent 30 years behind a grill and a smoker, I was left wanting. The BBQ beans were very tasty though. The Mac N Cheese was outstanding! Coleslaw was the worst I have ever had. Very inconsistent. A couple of good sides, but one goes to a BBQ restaurant for the meats. This place is surely better than Lucille's (awful!!) and a damn site worse than Rollin' Smoke, Big B's or The Roadkill Grill. Those are the best three in town, in that order. You should probably go to one of them instead.",

    "text": "Bar-B-Que, there's not much to it. Not too hard to get wrong as long as you offer up some burn animal flesh and delicious sides. I've driven by Bell's BBQ a number of times and I never went in until recently. We made a point to go to Bell's and all in all it wasn't a bad experience. Can't really say I'm a fan and not really sure I'd go back, but it's an option if you're in the area seeing as there aren't too many other BBQ joints around. However I did like Big B's Texas BBQ on St Rose better.  On to the review:  The place is pretty easy to find and parking was a breeze. We went during lunch time on a Saturday afternoon. The place wasn't too busy and we were able to order right away. Table Service was good.  Here's what we got and what we thought: Baby Back Ribs - These were okay. I've had better. The meat wasn't as tender and the meat quantity was a little light on the bones. Those pigs were probably undernourished? 3-Cheese Mac - This was pretty tasty. The cheese was melty (is that a word?) and macaroni was good. Get this as a side unless you're lactose intolerant. Pulled Pork Sandwich - This was okay. Pull pork was tender, but nothing outstanding in the flavor department. It came stuffed in this big loaf of bread and the bread to pork ratio was unfortunately biased to the bread. Crispy Brussels Sprouts - meh. They were crispy, but not all that great. 4-Cheese Crusted Corn - This was a nice idea on paper, but the cheese flakes off the corn pretty quickly, so your first bite has cheese and corn and next bite is all corn because the cheese has likely fallen off. Chopped Brisket - This wasn't bad. As part of the kids meal this is a good choice. Pulled Chicken - A bit dry. Nothing special. Garlic Smashed Potatoes - This was good. Devyn's Homemade Pickles - Nothing special here. You get some slices included with your meal. Meh.  Also with all this you can try a number of different BBQ sauces including: House, Mustard, Spicy, Nashville, Old Fashioned, Gluten Free.  Here's what we thought since we tried them all.  House = Old Fashioned = Gluten Free = all taste very similar Spicy - wasn't very spicy and close in flavor to the House Nashville - Was more tangy. Mustard - a mix of House BBQ and some sweetness of Honey Mustard I would say Bell's BBQ could probably just have 4 flavors: House, Spicy (make it more spicy), Nashville, and Mustard. The others are just taking up space. But even then all the sauces weren't outstanding. We mainly stuck with Nashville and Mustard.  Anyhow, if you looking for really great BBQ I don't think Bell's is the place.  You'd have to drive out to California and get Smoking Ribs or Phil's down in San Diego, but seeing as they're not local, I'd go Big B's Texas BBQ.",

The catfish was good when dipped in the sauce, the fried shrimp were really good, (I like the batter) The yams were gross, the baked beans were good. The cornbread was nice and sweet but way too dense. The red beans and rice were good but could use a little more salt. The corn on the cob was not very flavorful. No sweetness.

The food was excellent, 5pc St. Louis Ribs, with two sides. I had Mac n Cheese and coleslaw. The Mac was over the top, one of the best I have had. They offer several sauces, the presentation was nice with crispy thin fried onions and pickles. The onions were a great compliment and very tasty. Will definitely visit again, just for the Mac n Cheese. Forgot to mention the ribs were delicious and fell off the bone.",

I remembered seeing something about Kids eating free on Tuesday so...  We got a free meal for my kiddo (chicken tenders) since my husband had an entree (the shrimp po' boy) while I ate all of the sides! My favorites are the black eyed peas, collard greens, cornbread, side salad, and OKRA FRIES! Sometimes we've gone to order them on Uber eats and they're sold out!  They're full-length pieces of okra and perfectly breaded and fried with cornmeal. My little one eats them like a fiend! I'm flexatarian, so I make some wiggle room in my mostly-vegan diet for Bell's!  There's a good beer selection as well as tons of options for the kids. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. We were just talking about making this our Tuesday night gig!",

So I got my order, and they gave me a fork with it.   It had the cheese sauce, tomatoes, pickled jalapeno's sour cream and green onions.   All great ingredients!  But I never would have put them together!  My first bite......LAWDDDDDDD HAV MERCY! I never would have thought this would have taste like this, it was amazing, The chicken was amazing, and crispy!  I'm not that person that sucks the chicken wing to the bone, but I was trying to scoop up all the sauce and all the other goodies, that fell to the bottom of the container.   If I could have licked the container I would have.   I got jipped because they should have given me a spoon not a fork.   customer service was great, I plan on going back for more.",

It smelled amazing, and turned out to be really really delish food. The food is quality, and with quality comes the cost associated with good food. This place is not cheap, but its also not super expensive either.   The sides are epic, especially the 4 cheese corn and the brussel sprouts. Sides come with sandwiches, and 2 sides with dinner plates. I ordered the shrimp po' boy, which was amazeballs, with the 4 cheese corn and the garlic mashers. The husband ordered the chicken plate, with the cauliflower and brussels. And together we shared the cheesecake served in a jar, super fun and ridiculously amazing as it wasn't overly rich or sweet but hit the spot! We both were overstuffed after eating our meals, and we took home leftovers. In all honesty we could have shared the sandwich, sides, and the dessert and left stuffed without leftovers.   This is a family run business and you can tell, they care about what they serve to their customers and it shows in the quality and taste of their food. GO HERE! EAT THINGS!",

I'm also a fan of potato salad and love me some deviled eggs, so I thought this was the spot for me. I ordered the fried catfish dinner with the potato salad and b.e.p's... Well, I'm sorry to say the sides were disappointing. The black eyed peas were on the hard side, like they weren't allowed to soak long enough. No amount of hot sauce can fix hard beans. The potato salad had very large chunks of potatoes that were also too hard, I couldn't believe it... The catfish w/bbq tarter sauce on the other hand was outstanding!... I still can't help but feel sad that I literally paid $20 and only ate the catfish because the sides weren't cooked thoroughly, I had to toss them out unfortunately. On a positive note, the restaurant is clean and has good vibes and the gentleman at the register was pleasant.",

All of us ordered something different and all were very pleased with the main courses: catfish (excellent!), ribs (tender, juicy and not fatty), chicken tenders & shrimp po-boy. Large portions and great taste! Side dishes were good but they were out of the okra fries which was one of the main reasons I wanted to go here. I ordered fried green tomatoes instead and they were horrible! The breading was way too thick and doughy, not crispy at all, and they were cold. If they had been good, I would have been upset that there were only 3! I did tell one of the employees (nicely) and was told \"I'll tell the cook.\" No offer to reduce the bill or get a different side dish, dessert, etc. Not a deal breaker but would have been a nice gesture. Other sides ordered were pretty good - 5x fries, yams, coleslaw, potato salad, corn on the cob and salad. The bbq sauces were very vinegary and I didn't care for them but that is just my personal opinion and others may like them. Desserts were very good and the mini mason jars are a nice touch. My overall opinion is that the food for the most part is very good however, I felt it was quite pricey for not being a \"sit down and order\" place. One more thing - there is a small container for trash on the counter near the drink station - a bit of a turn off but at least it only contained straw wrappers and a few squeezed lemon wedges! May go again but order differently to try to save some $$.",

It tasted like it had either been frozen or boiled in water so long it was mushy.  The chicken and the pulled pork were ok but nothing you would want to come back and have a second time.  To be fair though, my husband has a smoker in the backyard and smokes his own brisket, pork and chicken.  We thought we would try some so we wouldn't have to cook it ourselves, but Bell's won't be replacing home bbq.",

It took awhile to get our food but were told with apologies that they just had a large take out order that backed them up. Food is 5 stars. Price is a bit high to be able to go often and feed a family of 4. It was also pretty smoky inside which made it a bit uncomfortable. But the food was super good.",

We both got the pulled pork and it was super fatty...the majority of the meat was large hunks of fat and gristle. The sides were okay: beans, smashed potatoes, mac and cheese, greens, and pickles. The kids meals were fine (mini corn dogs and grilled cheese). I can't say any part of the meal was really good. We'll probably give it another try after they've been open for a while. We'll go earlier and we'll definitely order the banana pudding because that looked amazing. Maybe next time, Bell.",

The food was delicious and the customer service was outstanding!  We are putting this place on 'our rotation' when we eat out!  We had a variety of sides with our meals and they were all sooooo good! For dinner We loved the Chicken and Waffles, pulled pork and pulled chicken sandwiches!  You must try the buffalo cauliflower and okra...sounds random... But delicious!!  Last thing.... It's so refreshing to go to a restaurant and witness young people working who are polite and helpful!! Can't wait to go back and try something else on their menu!!",

My pulled pork was pretty dry, smashed potatoes were bland and my okra was so do.  I was intrigued by the okra fries but they are difficult to bite so you have to shove the whole thing in your mouth.  I like it cut up better.  They have three sauces, spicy, old fashioned and house.  I preferred the house, it tasted like a vinegar base.  My husband liked his brisket but said it's a little too dry but he enjoyed the sauce.",

They were open until 9, but the doors were already closed. No big issue - it may have been a slow night and they closed early?  Next time they were open, and we got the Brussel Sprouts, Macaroni and Cheese, Coleslaw and ribs. The Brussel Sprouts were fantastic! Crunchy and delicious! My son loved and Mac and Cheese, especially with the Ritz Cracker crust. The coleslaw was fine, nothing wild, but it is just coleslaw ;-) The meat, the star of the show, was lackluster. There was so much fat and very little meat. I know BBQ, especially ribs, can be fatty, but this way way too much. I took my first bite and it was all fat. I just can't give this place 4+ stars when the BBQ itself is not as good tasting as some of the sides.   Two friends of mine went the other week and said the same thing - sides and dessert were good, but the meat was lacking in the flavor department.   Maybe we'll go back one day as I heard they have several gluten free options, but unfortunately, I am in no rush.",

    "text": "It was our first time and I was having a difficult time deciding what to order. It must have shown on my face because the woman at the register (I'm sorry I don't recall her name) started to explain the choices of the different meats in sandwiches or combos and all the different sides. I ordered the babyback ribs as a combo so that included 2 sides. The ribs sit on Texas toast and came with hard boild egg potato salad plus a side salad. It was a lot of food. And it was all delicious! We even got pie as a to go order.  We will definitely be going back.  We got there for a late lunch/early dinner and it was pretty quiet but as we were leaving there was quite the line forming. My tip if you plan on going for dinner plan on waiting in line. The food is worth the wait.",

When I'm there I dine in and get two orders to go. It's the best bbq I've ever had. Eric the owner has a great rapport with his customers and is very accommodating. The crew he has working there are also great. They're always quick to get me a refill on my soda, etc.  I'm sure Eric's tired of me bugging him about opening a Summerlin location but too bad, Eric...I'm gonna keep harassing you (just kidding). No, in all seriousness, this place gets enough steady business that I doubt he even needs a second location.",

    "text": "We've been to Bell's BBQ, it has been a wonderful experience each time.  When you walk in, you order from the counter. Then find a table, most people enjoy getting one of the many booths that line the parameter of the restaurant. Your food is brought to your table and they continue to check on your table if you need anything else throughout the course of your meal. Service is wonderful, always with a smile and all the staff we have met so far have been very nice.   What I recommend: -Chopped brisket sandwich.  -The half smoked chicken.  -The side of Kale Salad.  -The side of Mashed yams (oh soooo delicious).  -The Mac and Cheese for kids. (Huge! You can split with between 2 kids) -The side of fries (it comes with every kind of fry! Regular, curly, waffle, sweet potato, crinkle, my daughter loved it) --And the Shrimp and Grits   The Shrimp and Grits are in my picture and I posted a video too..  get ready to drool when you watch the video. Tommy makes it the best! I love this dish, it's my new favorite craving! In my opinion, by far the best thing on the menu.   They have desserts, called sweet jars. We have yet to try one yet as we have been too full. Maybe we will make a trip here just for dessert.   One more note, my son just turned one and when I place him in the highchair, the table is the perfect height for him to enjoy and eat with us. Sometimes, other restaurants do not take this into consideration, and the table ends up being up to the toddlers nose. In this case, the height is perfect and is a BIG plus because it makes takes my kids here to eat very easy.   Tuesday's kids eat free. That's a bonus! Will be back for that too.   Bell's BBQ is quickly becoming a family favorite that we will frequent in the years to come.",

You will not be sorry you ordered it! Pulled pork was very good too. Potato salad was a bit spicy but the owner switched it out no problems! They will let you sample the sides and I would do that with it and the slaw. Grits-cheese and mac n cheese was beyond delicious! Corn bread as others mentioned is ..well... it is the best I have had in a very long time! It is sweet and moist! Love the outdoor seating for a mild night like we had. My only regret is we do not have one in Indianapolis!",

    "text": "Barbeque, ordered via takeout, so good I wish I could give this place five stars.  As a disclaimer, I lack the refined pallette of some of my friends when it comes to barbecue. I'm horribly inept at identifying the \"smokiness of the rub\" or judging the \"nuttiness of the sauce.\"   But I can tell you that every corner of the menu here is slathered in dazzlingly fresh ingredients, with a splash of unique flair in every dish.  The pulled chicken sandwich is crammed into the middle of a single buttery, griddled loaf of Texas style toast, overflowing with mouthwatering strands of chicken ready to be drenched (to your own preference) in a side cup of barbecue sauce.  The fries are an adventure in themselves, with an assortment of sweet, salty, thick, and impossibly skinny fried potatoes. The mac and cheese is perfectly creamy, slathered with a delightful variety of sharp and mild cheeses. The braised greens are juicy and fresh, an exquisitely mild and faintly bitter foil to your feast of riches. And the beans are a meal into themselves, the full spectrum of beans comingled in a deliciously flavorful sauce with a huge lump of pulled pork(?).  Oh, and the dessert! A delicious banana pudding, with slices of real carmelized bananas. All of it served in a surprisingly beautiful and sturdy jar I'm finding hard to throw away.  The service was plenty friendly when I arrived, but painfully slow - he seemed far overstretched for what appeared to be only a few orders coming in.  Could've been just an off day, but I waited a solid 15 minutes after the initial time it was supposed to be ready (20 minutes after order was placed). For barbecue this good, I'm perfectly okay with waiting a little longer for it to be ready. Just let me know!",

Not an item I see at any other BBQ joints around town, I had to try it.  I always get a beef rib whenever I find them.  There are a ton of sides to choose from, I went with the deviled egg potato salad and red beans and rice.  The Good: Pork belly was amazing!!!  Thick cut pork belly smoked then cut into chunks and tossed in the deep fryer!!  You end up with a crispy, smokey, unique taste that you won't find anywhere else.  A 5 star dish for sure!!  The Okay: Beef rib and red beans and rice were ok.  I'd say these dishes are 3.5 stars.    The Bad: Deviled egg potato salad was gross.  It did not taste like deviled eggs, there was no egg in it, and it was very bland.  My coworker and I both ordered it and both agreed that it was horrible.  1 star dish.  Overall, the pork belly was the star.  My coworkers food looked delicious and they said it was good.  Portions are large and worth the money.  I would go back and try some of the other meats and sides.",

    "text": "During my first visit, the meats I tried were the brisket, (which was flavorful) and pulled chicken (seemed a little dry, but I think because it's shredded, that probably dries it out some). I also tried the crispy brussel sprouts that were really yummy and the crispyness took away the bitter taste that I normally find with brussel sprouts. The deviled egg potato salad was good and had a little kick to it; the potato pieces were a little large and I did have to cut them. The bbq beans were great and included some shredded meat (I think pork) and tasted great; they also had a little spice. In my opinion, the sauces tasted best when they marinated on the meat for a few minutes. The regular bbq sauce combined with the spicy bbq sauce balanced each other out and gave a little heat, but not too much. Great service and the restaurant was clean and food tasted fresh.",

I've absolutely never had pickles diced into my coleslaw but it is NOT my thing. It's overpowering and isn't the classic taste of coleslaw I was expecting. Our server was really nice and I was too shy to tell her I didn't like it. The price is fair for the large amount of food you get here. Each plate comes with some yummy texas toast as well.",

I ended up choosing Cameron's Southern Fried Chicken Breast Strips (about $16 with tax) since I didn't want to get my hands all messy during my lunch break.  It comes with 2 sides, a large slice of Texas toast, and 2 pickle slices.  Literally 2.  The chicken strips were large and had little to no fat on them.  Fried to perfection.  No hints of old, overused grease whatsoever.  I chose mashed potatoes and macaroni for my 2 sides.  Again, no complaints this way.  The macaroni was creamy and the potatoes were the ideal texture with just a hint of garlic.  Not overbearing but just right.  According to their website, all sides are homemade and I am not going to disagree with that.  Only thing I would change is the serving of 2 quarter sized pickles.  The pickles are very good, but I wish they gave you more lol I don't really understand the point of adding pickles if they aren't a regular amount.  It's not like I ordered a sandwich.  Definitely delicious, and a place I would never say no to!",

There was no line, which is always nice.  My sister in law just moved here, and had never been here. She wanted to try tri-tip, as that is her favorite thing ever. To her dismay, they do not serve tri-tip.  Not yet anyway. The gentleman that rang us up said they were considering it somewhere down the line. She ordered the brisket sandwich, and I ordered the pulled chicken sandwich with deviled egg potato salad.  The pulled chicken is very good. I tried their original sauce on it as well, very tasty. The bread is a little overwhelming, however. It is Texas toast, which I love, but it is a little too much using a very thick slice for a sandwich. They make a slit down the middle and stuff it with the meat. It was very good, don't get me wrong, Just way too much bread.  The potato salad is really good. I have had it before, and wanted it again. The gentleman that rang us up indicated it was spicy- I didn't think so at all.   Service is good, the place is super cute and clean. It's also close to our home, so easy to get to!",

    "text": "I can't say enough good things about this place from my first visit.   The service:  As soon as we walked in, we were greeted. The cashier, the servers, the cooks, all so nice as we ordered and got served. Very friendly! I wish I had more cash to tip them after paying for our meal!   The food: Very flavorful and there's an extensive side dishes menu. My favorites were the brisket entree and pork belly entree, with sides of collard green, Brussel Sprouts, and deviled egg potato salad. My cousin says the cheese crusted corn was amazing also-which it looked delicious! (We also got the Mac n cheese which was good! Next time I want okra fries!) I wouldn't say it's the BEST brisket I've had in terms of tenderness, but still worth th price and the flavors were spot on!  Deserts were also just as delicious! The \"sweet jars\" were the perfect ending to an umami tasting meal. Not too large, but enough for two people to share very well , or one person to indulge fully. (My favs are the banana pudding & key lime...and s'mores if you like chocolate!)  Drinks: They have a self serve fountain station as well as sweet tea. If you don't like those, they also have a selection of beer that you can chose from! Just show your ID!   Pricing: We did the entree which was about $14-15. It includes two sides of your choice and the meat selected. (We did one brisket and then ordered another with pork belly). I believe the drink is separate and was about $2-$3? I'm unsure actually. The dessert sweet jars were around $6.50 or $7. It's a bit pricier of a full meal, but you definitely get a good amounts worth!! We took a lot home!   Tip #1: BE SURE TO CHECK IN. We forgot to check in right when we got there and they have $5 off your order of $25 or more.  Tip#2: try the sauces on the table! My favorite one was the spicy bbq and the mustard bbq!",

We literally wanted to try everything and we were definitely what I call \"ordering with our eyes\" so we ended up getting a togo box.  I've read reviews that complained about the prices, but I've been to several BBQ places and the price is reasonable and comparable to others.  I mean you can't expect to get half a rack of ribs for 5 bucks.  C'mon people !   Overall it satisfied our craving for BBQ.",

And those of you who read my reviews know that I am extremely picky when it comes to meat!  We decided to give Bell's BBQ a try after reading the reviews and looking at everyone's yummy photos! We have two BBQ places we frequent regularly and I have to say....Bell's has beaten them all!  :) Not only with the food, but the service and the atmosphere and the prices!!!! A huge win win all around!!!! All together we had: brisket, pulled pork, spare ribs, mac-n-cheese, buffalo cauliflower, coleslaw and 4 cheese crusted corn on the cob!!!! Spare ribs were out of this world...didn't even need a drop of sauce.. incredible...flavorful...fell off the bone! I put some of the pulled pork on my mac-n-cheese and omg...mmmmmm! For me my favorite part was the buffalo cauliflower....I would go back for that alone!!!! Incredible! But honestly everything was delicious and we have found out new go to BBQ joint for sure!!!!  We were told we should save room for dessert so we did...we had ordered the banana pudding and creme brulee but they were out of banana pudding...so we had 2 creme brulee....so creamy and had a faint taste of vanilla...but the perfect amount of sugar on the top.  Definitely hoping they have banana next time so we can try that...but would definitely get the creme brulee again. The atmosphere was great, clean fun staff and great music playing!!  The person who took our order asked us if it was our 1st time there and was very helpful with suggestions!  Thank you for a great experience all around and we will be seeing you soon!!!",

They've still been out of items (like beef ribs) on a couple trips, but they generally have what we order.    I absolutely love the buffalo cauliflower and the brussel sprouts (both are up-charges as meal sides)  Also, their sauces are better than they were when they first opened.  If you order dessert for takeout, don't forget to return your mason jars to get entered into a $20 gift certificate each month.  Lastly, it's nice that kids eat free on Tuesdays.",

It is impressive that this is the dream of a world traveled chef and when you see those fantastic deserts you will be tempted to go straight to the deserts.  Help us keep this business in the Anthem neighborhood by supporting them and call in your orders for take out too.  We personally took several menus to hand out to our neighbors.  On comment as some though the prices a little high.   This is not a fast food joint and try buying this meat at the grocery store, marinating it, and preparing as they do for the price.   You get what you are paying for and since we eat out most of the week being seniors, I assure you we think the value is great.",

Brisket here was fab and you get a decent sized portion.  the bbq beans are great...different beans are used and they have good flavor without having too much bbq sauce in them.  They remind me of \"cowboy beans\".  Of course, I like the Texas toast it was served open face with.  Just like in TX.  I love that they have beef ribs.  Have to try them yet but glad I know where I can get them.  I also can't wait to try the grits and cheese.  Yum!  The staff is friendly and helpful and aim to please.  The owner came by and I did tell him the greens were not spicy enough for me and that I liked the vinegar from a bottle of tobacco peppers on my greens and he said he would look into getting some.   As far as price, well, a good BBQ place buys good meat and they have to cook it just right so they have to have someone who knows what they are doing. Someone that feels that these prices are high, has not eaten in many good barbeque places.  Typically, it ain't cheap!   I am not totally sold but I will say that I will be returning.  I have to try the catfish and fried green tomatoes and the fried okra.  One of these days I have to save room for desert.",

At the end of the meal we had three sweet jars... All were very good! Very good fries, and the ribs looked awesome ( will snag one from my nephew who brought two home)!

There were so many items on the menu I wanted to try but the items I did choose I ended up being sadly disappointing at this restaurant. Based on my experience I don't know how it's gotten so many 5 star reviews. Maybe it was an off night for some of the food items. Ordered the pulled pork plate but I swore I was given pulled chicken. It comes with 2 sides & I opted for the Brussels Sprouts (which I love) but sadly they had been sitting around & were dry, burnt, very salty & bitter. Second side I opted for Mac N Cheese & you could tell it had been sitting around for awhile. It had no flavor. Meat was just OK - nothing special. I did order the Caramelized Banana Pudding which was delicious though. Another dining partner ordered the catfish & said that as extremely salty as well. Some of my other dinning partners ordered different items than I did & they said their meals were great & that they would go back again. I honestly don't know if I would go back. I've had better food @ Lucille's for a little less money. Wishing I had a better experience as the venue is close to home.",

We did decided on brisket, chicken fried shrimp, chicken tenders, and St. Louis Ribs, ending our meals with dessert jars - red velvet and fluffernutter.  All I can say is damn. Damn, damn, damn!   The brisket was so tender and the ribs had that bite I love. The chicken strips were some of the best I've had outside of Chicken Shack! The chicken fried shrimp was delicious. Even the sides were great! We had fries x 5, cheese grits, and corn. I'd totally order all that again.  Ending with the dessert jars was the best choice in life. Both desserts blew us away! We took one jar home because I wanted to save some to eat before bedtime. It was amazing. Between red velvet and fluffernutter, if I had to choose one, I'd run away with both jars.  The photos speak for themselves. You must eat here.",

I came back here a second time to just make sure that the food was good and I would give it a solid 3.5 star.  1. Pork Baby Back Ribs - These are the very best and every rib we had was very tender and moist. Smoked and just right every time!  2. Sliced Brisket - I had asked several times if it was really moist and tender and they said yes.  It was tasty just not the most moist ever brisket.  If you douse it with enough sauce, in the end your won't notice.    3. Chicken - The bbq chicken was pretty good. They give you the thigh, wing and a quarter of chicken. It was overall good, however, I don't think you should ever give up the breast part as it is too dry overall.  4.  The sides - We had the red bean and rice, the southern greens and the fries. All were your standard fare, pretty decent overall.  5.  The service - Nice service, you order and then they bring to your table. They are friendly and helpful!  6.  They serve the food in a nice metal tray with Texas Toast on the bottom, the meat on top and the sides.  Price wise, I find it on the slight higher end, although I enjoyed it overall.  GK says that this is a pretty good place for barbecue and i will be back to try a few other choices.",

Out of all the things we tried I have to say the Half Chicken, Mac & Cheese, Mashed Potatoes and the Banana Desert Jar were the shining stars for me. We did find that the greens didn't have enough fat used in it for our taste buds as it was very 1 note for us. Also the pulled chicken was very dry! We didn't understand why the girl at the register recommended it to us as we thought the Half Chicken was much much better in flavor and juiciness. The Mac & Cheese was amazing! So was the desert jar, it was PERFECTION.  This place gets a point for cute factor and friendliness and our next visit we plan to check out the ribs and pulled pork and that cheesy corn!

I ordered a pork a la carte, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and mac and cheese. Having had those ill probably be back for the okra, baked beans, corn coblet, and coleslaw. Maybe even a pickle stick. Possibly one of those sweet jars.   So yeah this was all delicious. I picked it up and brought it home, roughly a 10 minute drive. Everything was still warm but I'm sure the drive made the cauliflower and Brussels sprouts a little less crispy. It was still delicious and I ate them all!   This left much less room for the pork and mac & cheese, but I still had to try them. The pork was a bit dry but I got a nice serving of House BBQ sauce.  It's a standard sauce, a bit on the sweet side. My dog definitely enjoyed the scraps I gave her. The mac & cheese is definitely homemade and worth getting.   I'll be back. It's a small space but there was an outdoor table or three if you wanted to do that.",

    "text": "The staff was friendly and helpful.  I ordered the brisket plate for $15 and it came with 2 sides.  I chose crispy brussel sprouts and cheese crusted corn, both had an up charge of 50 cents.  I also ordered and add on of 3 chicken strips for $5 and a fountain drink for $2.35.   The brisket arrived on top of Texas toast and had sauce and crispy onions (like the onions people put on string bean casserole at Thanksgiving) on top.  I never put BBQ sauce on brisket because I think it takes away from the smoky flavor and the great taste of the bark (the best part of any brisket).  After I tasted the brisket I understood why it was served with sauce.  It tasted like the brisket my mother make in a pot on the stove top when I was a kid.  That is to say dry with no smoky taste, no smoke ring and definitely no bark, just bland meat texture.  It was hands down the worst brisket I have ever had (and I've had smoked brisket from Boston to Austin and nearly every place in between).    The sides weren't much better.  The brussel sprouts, that I assume were be deep fried, must have been sitting around for a while because they were neither crispy nor hot.  And although the cheese on the corn on the cob was tasty, hot, crispy and gooey (who doesn't like cheese melted and crisped on a flat top) the corn underneath was soggy and mushy.  It would have been better to just sell crispy gooey parmesan-mozzarella crisps.  The surprise was the chicken strips.  The add-on was for 3 strips and I only received 2, but the ones I received were large and crispy and the white meat was moist and flavorful.    The brisket portion was small for the price and $5 for 2 chicken strips was high but had I received all three the price would have been about right.    All in all, the value for dollar is better at any of the other BBQ joints around town (I've tried 8 so far) and like I said it served the worst smoked (?) brisket I've ever had, but if I was in the area I might stop by for the chicken strips.",

Pros - The restaurant is clean and comfortable, with southern music playing softly in the background. My sides were super good. I loved the red beans and rice, they were hot and spicy. The Mac was steamy and good.  The Cons - This place is awfully pricey for what you get. I got twelve ribs with sides and two grilled cheese sandwiches for my kids and spent 51 dollars. The ribs were OK, but they are pre made and come out to you dryer than dog biscuits and Luke warm at best.   Overall - Good place but I probably will not come back for a while..  Especially when it costs 50 dollars to feed my family.",

We ordered to go and were greeted at the register (yes order and pay first even to dine in) and much like most new restaurants they use an iPad for ordering and paying, so this is where you would be asked to tip (purely an option not complaint worthy as some previous reviewers have complained, and you can still leave a tip on the table if you prefer, wow!)  The Food- My wife has the pulled pork and enjoyed it, she is not a seasoning person, so the pork was lightly smoked and seasoned, and was perfect for her. Me, it needed more seasoning.  My son had pulled pork sandwich, which was a good portion of meat and worth the $9 price.  I asked the cashier what I should go for since I didn't want ribs, and was recommended the brisket. Some of the better brisket I have had, good smoke flavor, nice char, not gristly, and not dry!   The sides were all good, although none of them really stood out.  The dessert - This was the highlight of Bells, we had the smores and caramelized banana pudding which are served in these awesome little Mason jars. Both were fantastic, wife the chocolate fanatic loved the smores, and I the not too much of a chocolate fan was left wanting more banana pudding.  Bell's is worthy of another visit for the BBQ, but might see me weekly for the Jars of deliciousness!",

The first thing you notice is that it really doesn't smell like a BBQ place...no smoke smell outside or in.  It was about 4 pm on Sunday and they were already out of Beef ribs....ugh!  I ended up ordering a full slab of St. Louis style with the coleslaw and the crispy Brussel sprouts.  The portions are generous to say the least, the Brussel sprouts were great speaking as NOT a fan of them and the ribs were meaty.  I would eat there again for sure.",

She ordered the brisket sandwhich and I ordered the beef ribs. I love beef ribs and these were tender and tasty! I usually have to fight getting the meat off the bone but not these ones! I got 2 sides and an extra side for checking in with yelp. I am critical with Mac and cheese and I must say the 3 cheese Mac and cheese surpass my test. Nice consistency with the cheese and has has a smoothness to it,which I like. The crispy brussel sprouts were the bomb! I wish I can make these at home. The 3rd side was the mash yams , which was nothing special but still good.  They have different types of bbq sauce and I usually go with the spicy bbq sauce,but the mustard bbq sauce was amazing. First time trying mustard bbq sauce on ribs and it added another level of taste to my palate!!! Great service, especially from twayla. She made sure everything tasted great and are drinks filled! I believe their bbq is a North Carolina flare. Oh they also have legit texas toast to die for. Ill be back!",

First off we were greeted by a very friendly young man named \"Balil\" I actually called after l left to make sure spelling was right :). He was very sweet and helpful with choices on the menu.  Food was very yummy.  I had the pulled bbq sandwich and my sister had the bbq brisket sandwich which she loved.  My husband had the baby back ribs and love them as well.  They were yummy and tender.  All the sides were great!  Balil was the one that checked us out at the register but even came by the table to check on us and asked if he could refill our drinks.  It's people like him that make it a pleasure to come back.",

He said it would be ready in 15-20 minutes and it was ready when we got there.  As soon as you pull up the aromas are so enticing it makes you anxious to want to eat! We ordered 6 bone baby back ribs with smashed potatoes and mac and cheese. Another order but this one with mac and cheese and crispy brussel sprouts (Yum!). Also a side of pork belly, buffalo fried cauliflower (so good!) and a sweet cheesecake jar.  Everything was packed beautifully and everything we ordered was DELICIOUS  all the way down to their signature BBQ sauce. The portions are HUGE including the ribs. They have a great menu with a large/great selection of sides all of which I cannot wait to try. Really a great asset to our community and I wish them continued success.",

I waited to do this review, so I don't have the details of the the flavors. Get double sides you won't have enough. They don't have mixed plated like a rib chicken plate or combo that I saw. They have a kids day with a balloon maker and discount meal.",

I'm not a gnaw the meat off the bone type of girl, so I opted for the pulled chicken both time. Flaky, tender, and extra spicy with their choice of regular or hot bbq sauce. Aside from the meat, I am a major sides girl. They have so many to choose from and are always adding new ones. So far the cheese corn, baked beans (with pieces of brisket), deviled egg potato salad, garlic mash, and cheese grits have been my default favs. They offer two with your meat order, but you can add on as many as you want for a reasonable $1.75. Also, house made pickles and Texas toast (think Raising Canes) come with your meal.  This place is great for kids. Im all about not paying an arm and a leg for my two kids to eat out. I get them both a side order of the 3 cheese Mac and they are stuffed. Super cheap, super yum.   The restaurant itself is clean and cute.  Nothing over the top, but I kind of like that. A Mom and Pop kind of place. The staff is super helpful, and they are on top of coming over to fill your cup at the self serve drink station. A+ service.  Next time, I'm going for that banana pudding sweet jar.",

Ordered brisket, porky bellies, tatertots, Mac and cheese their special corn and a blue moon. All good food.   Brisket had a smokey, not overdone flavor. It welcomed the final touch of your pick of the cool sauces. Watch it, some are spicy.  Lots of sauce selections.  Pick bellies we well marbled. I don't like that. But, they were prepared well. I was just adventuring into a new food and found it was not my thing.   Think: the easy, spiritual, down home feeling that you get from good blues music...that's the feeling of this place. A good dinner is made up of the look and feel of where you're sitting, the flavors and then the feel from it all out together by the people. They nailed it here. It's now on my shortlist for go-to food.   I don't know for sure but if feels family-owned, family and friend operated. The sincerity of it all just doesn't come from franchised places. This was all about the warmth.   Nice!  Highly recommended.",

I have tried John Mulls meats, Famous Daves, Rollin Smoke, Lucilles, and a few other places I have forgotten. All of those places have let me down in one way or another (sauce overpowering, too expensive, too bland, etc).  Bells is the Belle of the Ball. I had the Pork Belly plate with a Brisket add-on, with Smashed Potatoes and the 3-cheese Mac and Cheese for my sides, and Sweet Tea to drink.  The Pork Belly was so tender and juicy. It was the second best belly I have. Only second best because the best was a little less fatty and had more of a smoked bacony flavor.  The Brisket was also fantastic. Tender and fall apart on your fork.  The Smashed Potatoes are flavored with Smoked Garlic but it's just a hint. Not over powering at all. And they are real potatoes. Like my mom used to make. Definitely not powdered or flake.  The 3 Cheese Mac and Cheese is great. You really can't go wrong on a 3 cheese mac.  The sweet tea was good, definitely not overly sweet.  Will DEFINITELY be returning here",

The menu has all kinds of options from ribs to pulled pork/chicken, and a bunch of sides to choose from. We had the St Louis Ribs and pulled chicken. Wow! it was good.   They also have a great kids menu, especially if they aren't in to BBQ. Our kids had corn dogs and Mac n cheese.   While there food was amazing, I was most shocked with their customer service. The employees came by several time to make sure we had everything we needed, refilled our drinks several times, and even cleaned our table off when we were done. In addition, the owner and head chef came out to welcome us and thank us for coming in...wow!!!  We will definitely be back. This place just exceeded my expectations!",

The pricing is a little bit on the high end for what you get especially since you have to line up like cattle at the counter to order. This is especially annoying when the people in front of you have to discuss every item on the menu with the cashier.  The decor is fine for a casual place. Treat me like I am visiting a restaurant and take my order at the table and I will be there more often and hand my money over much more cheerful, otherwise charge me like a place where I order at the counter.",

    "text": "Since I was born in Memphis and have eaten BBQ all over the country since I was a child, and make it myself, I think I know a little about this subject. I also have a restaurant management degree. First I found all the food to be just average. The pulled pork had good flavor but putting it on top of garlic bread spoiled it for me. The two don't gel well on top of each other. And I don't like garlic flavor in my BBQ. Plus I like my garlic bread separate. When I entered I took a seat and waited twenty minutes before the waitress told me I needed to order at the counter even though she looked and passed by me several times. When I ordered it took a while for someone to take my order. Then I was told the food would be delayed.? They were only about 2/3 full. But one look at the apparent chaos in the kitchen gave me a clue.! My food did come quicker than expected but overall my experience was about 2 1/2 stars.!",

Not allot of places sell it, when ever I see it anywhere i go I always order it and here it did not disappoint! It's cooked perfectly. I never eat in I always take it to go and it never makes it home. Haha  Another thing that they never advertise but they really should is their Chicken wings. They have some of the best wings I've ever had. Better than Buffalo Wild wings or where ever!  I've only had a few of their sauces but the ones I've had so far have been great! Mustard BBQ, Traditional Buffalo, this sweet and spicy sauce.   That pretty much somes up this review Their Pork Belly and Wings are why I come here.",

We had a party of six and when the waitress came to the table she didn't introduce herself and said they only had three menus ? WTH? Mind you we were the only ones in the restaurant.  The food was ok. I had the brisket which was very dry, the cheese corn, crispy Brussels sprouts and Mac and cheese, let's just say the corn and Brussel sprouts were the best out of my entire meal. I really wanted to try the beef ribs but they were out ( which I wasn't informed of by the waitress until I ordered them) the rest of my coworkers  said the food was ok as well , they had a variety of the greens, pulled chicken sandwich, pork belly sandwich. Overall I might give them a second chance and try the beef ribs if they have them on the menu",

So I decided to go light with a sandwich and a side of my favorite okra that they make in house. Now let me describe the nearly meatless bread sandwich. Most people would call it Texas toast. Each side of this bread sandwich is about the thickness of 2 regular slices of white bread. So think of this as a standing on edge large piece of bread that has been cut in the middle to hold the meat. However the amount of meat that was placed inside was meager to say the least. Maybe I should call this a jam sandwich....2 pieces of bread jammed together. Bottom line...not worth the $9.95. Plus I don't understand why they had so many employees behind the counter as the place was almost empty. One thing is for sure I will not be returning or recommending this place.",

The BBQ is awesome...moist and tender.  I split a brisket plate with 3 sides (one free) with my daughter, so we would have room for the 3 dessert jars we ordered.  Priorities...always save room for dessert.  Our dessert jars were:  Red Velvet, S'mores and Creme Brulee.  All were wonderful.  The Red Velvet was my fav.  I would come back just for the dessert jars right now if it didn't take me 10 hours to drive there.  Definitely worth a return visit next time we're in Las Vegas.",

As far as the brisket and Mac & cheese...they were decent. Nothing special. To be honest, they both seemed a little dry.   The location is nice, in a little shopping center near the corner of Eastern and Sunridge Heights. They have plenty of indoor seating and picnic tables outside.   Brisket with two sides $14.95",

We should have placed the food order in advance too; lesson learned.  -  Ordered from the catering menu which included a little of everything for $189. Ribs, Hot Links, Brisket, Pulled Pork & Chicken. A whole chicken cut up & 6 sides of our choice: Braised Southern Greens, (2 x) 3 Cheese Mac, Fries, Mashed Yams and Cheesy Grits.  There was more than enough food - (I happily took home plenty of leftovers; which they packed up and boxed it all, for ease of transporting.) Total was $240 with soft drinks, a glass of wine & separate gluten free dinner and a side of mini buns.   The food here is southern and good!! No desserts had on this visit, but the previously devoured Smore's, Creme Brulee and Caramelized Banana treats were all yummy.",

    "text": "First let me say I tried this place for the first time on Fathers Day. I placed a large order from grubhub. Everything was really good but I ordered a lb of sliced brisket and they brought me chopped, but other than that fantastic. Best cornbread I have ever had.  On July 4th I placed another large order.  The brisket was sliced this time and was delicious. However the brussel sprouts were burned so badly they got tossed out, the cornbread was burned and unpleasant and the pulled chicken was not pulled.  I called grubhub and said I understand they are probably busy and everything was great except these 3 items that made up only about 20% of my order. There was no need to send new ones but a refund of these items seemed appropriate.  So grubhub called the restaurant and called me back. They told me the restaurant owner was not going to issue a refund because he wanted to personally call me and offer compensation but they were busy so he would contact me later or the following day. It has been 3 days and I have heard nothing.   I really wanted to love this new place close to my house because I love bbq and the first order was great. I was even willing to give them another chance after the bad order because I understand they must have been very busy. But failing to correct this issue left a worse taste in my mouth than their burnt nasty food that they allowed to leave their kitchen. And if I can't rely on a bbq place to give me hood bbq on the number one grilling holiday of the year then they are useless to me. Could you imagine a pizza joint that can't deliver good pizza on Super Bowl?  ***update***  The day I wrote this review I received this message from the owner: \"Yes, before I issue a refund I want to speak to the person and hear about the issue so not only I can try and fix it, but stop it from happening again. I asked the GrubHub rep for your info, wouldn't give it to me for some weird reason, so I said to please have the customer call me directly. Seems like there was some miscommunication, and instead of our 3rd 1-star review ever, I wish you would have called the restaurant you ordered from so we could have hopefully earned a higher review. Sorry about your food, and my philosophy would be to order from a mom and pop bbq restaurant on another day besides the 3 busiest days of the year And not from a third party delivery partner. Maybe then you could get an accurate pulse on what the food SHOULD be like. Again, so sorry, and hope to serve you again in the future.\"  I am not sure how to feel about this message.  Draw your own conclusions",

    "text": "We are locals here (part of the year here, part elsewhere).  We eat out every single day. We recognize that the restaurant business is a difficult and tricky business to achieve success in. We eat in divey out of the way places and in high end restaurants (think Hank's in GVR).  It is with this in mind we write reviews.  Bells is hidden away in a small business center.  It is worth discovering!  We gave it a try for the first time and were dazzled by the quality, quantity, value and deliciousness of their BBQ.     I personally LOVE good BBQ and am usually disappointed with most BBQ joints.  Bell's is the exception!  A small family run business with an excellent menu that will satisfy even those who are not BBQ aficionados.  Wonderful starters, plates that are full and tasty that you can add additional items to.   I've always thought it a flaw in the BBQ arena of offering plates of one thing, but not having some add-ons so patrons can try other stuff.  As an example, I love ordering the pork plate, but I'd also like some ribs or chicken.   Bell's has solved that problem with their wonderful menu.      The meats were smoked and delicious. The plates were full and the sides (I'm partial to the mac and the beans) are big.  The seating is comfortable casual and the chatter, service and attention is excellent.  The pricing is really good for what you get - knowing that good BBQ is not a \"cheap eats\" but when one receives quality and quantity for the money they pay, they walk away happy.    We commend Bell's to you and urge you to satisfy the BBQ craving in their small restaurant. You won't be disappointed!",

I really liked their brisket here. The baby back ribs were meaty and tender. My only complaint are the sides. I ordered the corn and it was served plain. I wanted to try the cheese corn like everyone else's photos. Maybe it was just a fluke that day. I didn't care for the cheese grits either. The red velvet sweet jar for dessert was the real treat.  The cream cheese was on point and the cake to cream ratio was great. I liked the crunch of he candied pecans.  Overall, a good BBQ spot for the area.  I hope to try some better sides next time.   *****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge***** 38/100",

    "text": "I love that so many BBQ options are popping up in this area and I'm on a mission to try them all. Overall, this spot is A-OK and I would return.  The restaurant is clean and open with about a dozen tables. A few of the tables are large enough for a group. There are a few picnic tables outside too. The location is easy to find on Eastern and there is plenty of parking in front of the building.  The menu here is one of the largest menus I've seen at a BBQ restaurant. They offer all of the meats you'd expect from a BBQ joint, around 20 side options, and other items like catfish. They definitely weren't lacking in options.   The service was a five during our visit. As soon as we arrived the woman at the register asked if we were first timers and gave us an overview of the menu. After we ordered at the counter she brought our food to the table and then took care of everything from there. We were offered drink refills and to go boxes when the time came. They definitely have service in order.  I'll start with the sides because these were my favorite foods. The Pickle Sticks were my favorite side. The sticks were thin, lightly breaded, and delicious. The sauce on the side wasn't even necessary. The 4 Cheese Crusted Corn Coblet was unique and delicious. The Deviled Egg Potato Salad had great flavor and texture. The Red Beans and Rice were good, but could have used more Cajun spice.   My husband had the Pulled BBQ Rib Sandwich. It was much larger than it looked in photos on Yelp! Overall, the sandwich was good, but the meat was not the most tender meat. My two meats were St. Louis Style Ribs and Chopped Brisket. The meats were okay, but neither were as tender or as seasoned as I expected.  For dessert we shared the Black Bottom Key Lime Pie jar dessert. Choosing a dessert was hard because they have so many great options. The key lime was tart and the chocolate crust was yummy.   I'll return because this BBQ spot has a lot of potential. I really enjoyed some of the food items and the service was great. Hopefully next time I'll find a meat that is a favorite!",

    "text": "My nephew passed his driver's license test, do you need any other excuse to go get some barbecue? I met up with my family during my lunch break on a Wednesday afternoon and almost didn't make it back to work because I was ready for a nap. The sides weren't my favorite, but most importantly, the meats were delicious and everything was good enough overall to keep us coming back.  I ordered the brisket meal ($14.95) with the $3.95 pork belly add on and BBQ beans and okra \"fries\" for my side. There was a healthy portion of brisket that was a touch under seasoned as I had to go the BBQ sauce for an assist. The pork belly was excellent: crispy, fatty, and salty, another nice sized serving, well worth the extra dollars. I wasn't a big fan of either side, no problem with execution, I wasn't into the grittiness of the cornmeal on the okra and the sauce for the beans could have used a little more flavor. But no worries, they have plenty of selection for sides and I'll just get something different next time.  My wife and daughter split the baby backs ($24.95) with the 3 cheese mac and cole slaw. The leftovers were lunch for me the next day and they were quite tasty. Also ordered were a pulled chicken sandwich ($9.50) and pulled pork sandwich ($9.25) both with assorted fries. They were both finished, again no problems with the meat, except for the ends of the Texas toast. For the sandwiches, in the bread vs. meat battle, the bread wins in a landslide. I also noticed the french fries sogginess and that oil was soaking through the box container. The fries probably weren't made to order or just sold too soon and had been sitting around.  I would have loved to try a sweet jar, but I was just too full. A definite reason to come back though. A $72 lunch for a party of 5 may seem a little steep, but considering how much food we ate and how much we still took home, we got some bang for our buck. There were no issues with the service and everyone was friendly. The barbecue wasn't the best ever, but all in all we had a good first impression so we'll keep Bell's as a barbecue option for us.",

Bell's ribs were disappointing. The Banana Sweet Jar we got a taste of was very good though.  Most of the sides and sweets are where it's at...sadly, not for the BBQ....ALOHA!!!

This place have great meats, sides, and the deserts are off the hook.   The one tip I will give you is if you are ordering your food to go, call and order it. They will take a long time to get it to you if you order when you get there.",

    "text": "Probably one of the best places for bbq I have been for a while. Now I am giving this 5 stars for multiple reasons though there were a few recommendations.  I will start out with the things I didn't so much love nor dislike but did think need improvement, minor yet notable.  First, was my husband ordered a side of pork. The young man at the register asked if he would like that chopped and my husband said, \" yes\". His only recommendation on all the meat was to chop it a little more like more traditional bbq so its easier for consumers to eat.  Second, were the okra fries. I absolutely love okra so to see okra on the menu I was ecstatic. These left me a tad disappointed. The end was still intact, the breading was falling off, they lacked any flavor, and had to be my least favorite thing I ate while dining.   Now for all the AMAZING THINGS!!!! I am vegetarian and my husband is full on carnivore so the menu here was perfect for both of us giving multiple options. I ordered the Mac and cheese which was heavily!!!! I have to say it probably was the best Mac and cheese I ever had anywhere so major props! I also ordered the sweet potatoes which were divine and not to sweet like other places. The grilled cheese was made with real cheddar on Texas toast and not greasy. My husband ordered a pork bbq sandwich which was huge, the meat was tender and moist. I have to say I am very happy that Bells has come into this location because we will definitely be frequent customers. The staff was wonderful and food was delicious!!",

The Brisket was perfection and the mashed Yams my new fave! there not just for Thanksgiving anymore...the beans are also full of flavor and do not disappoint, lots of house made pickles thrown in the gift that keeps on giving I find that a meal at Bell's proves to be enough food for the next day as well! And finally the BBQ sauce is exceptional I am hard to please with sauce but they have nailed it with this one and they ever skimp on this either.  **Shout out to Bite Squad for stellar performance as well fast accurate and a friendly well mannered delivery driver thumbs up to you, we will be back.",

The brisket here is right on point, it's super moist and delicious, I highly recommend it. I tried the chicken here, they give a good portion of meat, but I thought it was kind of dry and there wasn't anything special about it. For sides, you can pick anything from mashed potatoes, to four cheese corn, to mac n cheese, to buffalo cauliflower, to deviled egg potato salad and so much more. Their bbq sauce is pretty great. I'm not a fan of bbq sauce, but I have to say, it tasted well with everything. This place also has a wide variety of unique beers. The prices of the dishes here are reasonably cheap for bbq. Great food, great interior design, and great service:)",

Brisket was nice in that was not dried out, but, no real smoke flavor or seasoning on the meat. BBQ beans were really nice (sweet but not overly). Slaw was ok, nothing special (pretty much what you get at any other place). Pickles were good. Nice sized portions.",

The chicken wasn't at all what I thought it was going to be or taste like. For the price it should have been some of the best damn chicken I've ever had and sadly it didn't even come close. The sides were pretty good. The yams were my favorite I think. I got some fried green tomatoes. Those were pretty good. Got a side of deviled egg potato salad...ugh..disgusting. never again. And I love potato salad. We also ordered pulled pork and brisket. It was decent. It's all highly overpriced if u ask me. And you can't even get family meals all the food I got cost me almost 60 bucks. Ridiculous!",

    "text": "I ordered the 6 Bone Baby Back Ribs with Smashed Garlicky potatoes and and bbq Beans. The Smashed Potatoes recipe really needs an overhaul. They look like they were made with water or nonfat milk. Add some cream, butter chives and maybe try some dang salt as they had NONE. The beans were just ok. The sauce they were in was too watery. The Ribs had a few small quirts of sauce which was OK because they have some on the table if you want it. I found the Texas Toast and Onions on top to be to much. Like they were trying to fancy up the fact that the food is super bland. The rub they use is off. I can't figure it out but there was some spice in it that was really off putting almost had a chimerical taste to it. The BBQ Sauce was like something you would get from a grocery store. As for the meat it seemed inferior. The ribs were a bit chewy and not even close to falling off the bone. Not very tasty at all. It doesn't surprise me that Bell's is in a strip mall because it really taste like something you would get in a food court. BLAND!   So next time I feel like spending over $20 for BBQ, it won't be Bell's.",

We were looking for a casual restaurant with great food, and Bell's was the perfect choice. We had 30 guests, and a guitarist and there was plenty of room for everyone to spread out and be comfortable. From the St Louis ribs, brisket and chicken, to the Mac and cheese, Brussel sprouts and crispy onions, to the amazing Sweet Tea and Sweet Jars for dessert - it was mouthwateringly delicious. And a shout out to Megan who was our dedicated server. She really did an excellent job. If you aren't able to have a party, or go to a party at Bell's make sure you get there to have lunch or dinner. I live in NY and have had lots of BBQ, and there is none better. And the prices are reasonable too. I guarantee you won't be disappointed.",

I had ordered to go so maybe they were expecting me to go home and heat it up later. However, I went to place next door to sit down and eat with the rest of my friends (I didn't feel like eating pho at the time). So when I took it back, they were nice about it and made me a fresh new batch. They even let me keep the old one to eat for later since they were going to just throw it away. Most places would have just taken it back and just tossed it in the trash.",

Everything we had was great, ribs, brisket, pulled pork, mac n cheese, sweet potatoes are amazing and the kids even like the food. Then over the course of our last few visits the food has gotten really inconsistent. Sometimes the ribs were dry or the pork portion was on the small side or something was too fatty. We've written them off considering the choices that are available in Vegas and how pricey it is. Sad because the location is perfect for us.",

    "text": "Today was my first, and last visit to Bell's BBQ.  My first clue should have been that they didn't have HOT LINKS on the menu.  What kind of BBQ place doesn't have hot links?   I ordered brisket.  I was absolutely flabbergasted when the man carving the meat CUT THE BARK OFF the brisket and threw it in the trash!  They claim to \"hickory smoke\" the meat for 14 hours.  There was absolutely NO SMOKE RING on the meat.  How could this be?  Last, the brisket was 100% lean - not a speck of fat anywhere.  Since fat means flavor, dry and boring is the BEST thing I can say about it.  There was little to no smoke flavor.   While bbq is never cheap, their prices were a little high.  They don't have any 2 or 3 meat combo meals.  If one wanted to try more than a single meat, the option was to purchase a full order of another protein on the side.  It was nearly $60 for myself and my 83 year old Uncle.  We both had two meats, he had a dessert, no drinks. The guys working there were super friendly, even guiding me to their door, over the phone.  (A bit hidden in the shopping center). The girl at the front counter wasn't rude or anything, just not as friendly as the guys.  She wasn't helpful at all, even though I explained that this was my first time.   Sorry Bell's.  you won't be seeing me again.",
