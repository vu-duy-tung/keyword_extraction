So bearing in mind that my Sister was Three Sheets to the Wind, I agreed to go here. The bartender, (a blonde with curly hair, curvy girl, and glasses) didn't bother to put down her phone to greet us when we walked in.  We ordered a drink and a slice of cheese pizza each. One slice was like $ 8.00!!! It was cut SO thin!! Mostly crust, dried out like it had been sitting there for 3 days. Barely and cheese. I took one bite and spit it out!!!  My Sister asked the bartender if we could have replacement peice. I got a new one. It was the same quality. My Sister kept saying that they go there during Bike Week every year. I kniw what it's like to go out partying and get wicked Hungry, stop at a place, think \"Omg This is Sooooo good\"!... then ho back another time sober and that same place that \"soooo good\" is now disgusting sauce on cardboard.  Well, THAT'S EXACTLY What this pizza tasted like. Sauce on cardboard.  Disgusting.  No way would I ever believe this place won any kind of award. I was a little buzzed, no need to go back sober cause this was already a huge fail. Never going back. Too expensive. Not worth it. Zero stars.",

Great price for an extremely delicious generous slice of pizza.   The garlic knots were also delicious, though in my opinion were a bit overly dense.   The Evel Kneivel theme of this place is also on point.. hipster-rock I say?  I do wish this was closer to the Strip though.",

I've worked back of the house for over a decade and the staff were below incompetent. They looked at the slips like they were written in code by Stephen Hawking.    After 40 minutes the staff were actually hostile to the person ahead of us and our party as well when they were questioned about the timeliness of the slices.  And I'm not exaggerating with the word hostile.  I mean seriously. Put a slice in the oven. Then hand it to the customer.  Get a clue.    It's also not advisable to tell the customer to 'fuck off'.  The girl taking our order was awesome though.  Please don't lump her in with the incompetence of the kitchen staff.",

The large number of positive reviews indicates I am likely in the minority, but I was really disappointed in the slice of their white pizza I ordered.  When I picked up the slice, the pizza had such a large pool of grease on top it almost seemed like they must have poured oil on it before heating it up. Then, biting into the pizza disappointingly gave way to a super chewy cheese experience (I'm guessing all the oil leeched out of the cheese, leaving the cheese as a deconstructed rubbery affair). Sadly, the flavor was bland to boot.  We did end up here after midnight, so who knows, maybe it's just an issue with the night shift. The only really positive thing I can say is that I started out hungry (having skipped dinner) and after eating the slice was satiated. But at $6 for a slice of rubbery white pizza I doubt I'll be back.",

    "text": "PIZZA! On Fremont in Vegas! SO GOOD and totally affordable, but price should not be an issue when it comes to good 'za (however, non-chain yummy food that doesn't bust your wallet is so great to find in Vegas!). The sauce is great, the crust is PERFECT, and for those who want it, there is a gluten free  option plus a vegan pie.  The Cheesy Rider showcases Evel Pei's pizza making skills, and showcases the sauce and crust with just the right amount of cheese. Barry White Pie--I love a white pie and this is glorious, balanced and nuanced. The World Famous Snake River Special has rattlesnake sausage (yum!), and OMG! they have man candy bacon as a topping on the Hog Heaven, and you can get it as a extra topping for other pies or slices.  They serve beer and shots as well as sodas, are open late late and freaking ROCK!",

We were told to get in line and order drinks when we order pizza. So we can't sit down and order drinks and then get in line for pizza? Nope. So we got in line. Ordered 2 slices and a couple of beers. We sat at the bar and ate our dried out pizza. It was a good thing we had the beer to wash it down with. I would not recommend this place. Save your money. There are way better places either within walking distance or a short RideShare away. If you need recommendations, see some of my other posts from my recent Vegas trip.",

(Sorry radio city pizza fans I was not impressed) serving pizza by the slice and pie this place is great and open late. Nothing in Vegas can recreate New York pizza (mostly because of the water, but there are other reasons too) this comes damn close. A nice greasy slice, that's thin enough to fold and eat New York style. It's a neat Evel Kneivel theme as well with all sorts of interesting decor. Looking forward to trying the rattlesnake sausage and man candy( a maple ham and pepper mix). Say hi to bartender Kelly if you go by, she's awesome!",

But beware, I then asked for a cup of water to go with it and they refused saying they don't offer water, even to paying customers. They replied back that the higher ups don't allow it because of the homeless people. Ridiculous. Rock Pizza block over doesn't do that. Rock Pizza associates are also friendlier. No water for paying customers is just a ploy to pad their tab thinking you'll buy a drink or sugar soda.",

    "text": "I enjoyed Evel Pie. I like the theme and the feel of this place on Fremont St. The staff was all real nice even at 10PM.   I went in for their award winning gluten free pizza, because I heard it is amazing. I ordered, was told it'd be 20 minutes, but 30 minutes later I'm still waiting for my pie.   It wasn't busy, so I'm not sure why my pie sat on top of the oven for a while even though the person who took my order saw me stand up from the table getting a little impatient. I saw a pizza on top of the oven, thought it may be mine, so I slowly start inching towards the counter. Finally, someone asks if I was here for pickup and gave me the pie.   The crust is deep dish, airy, and it has that yummy browned cheese on the edges. Yup. To die for. The sauce is a little sweeter and herbaceous which I love, and it wasn't drowning in cheese which I really appreciated. Simple and to the point. The crust was a little greasy, but it is 10PM on Fremont St, so I wasn't expecting something healthy at that point.   Here's the thing. I don't expect pizza places to make an extra effort and have a gluten free crust. However, the fact that Evel Pie put a bunch of effort into making a stellar crust for those with a gluten free allergy is impressive, greatly appreciated, and pretty close to being worth the $21 for a plain cheese gluten free pizza. I'm even willing to look past the wait time. I would definitely suggest that people come and grab a bite here - gluten free or not.",

Or maybe I was just seeking any calm away from Fremont Street.  BIG NEW YORK STYLE SLICES I took a slice topped with pepperoni and jalapenos while Hubs wanted one topped with multiple types of meat. Our slices arrived with a pool of oil on top from the cheese and limp from the size... but we already knew this wasn't gourmet pizza. This was diner pizza- comfortable and flavorful. The price was also great.  ORDER AT THE COUNTER AND THEY'LL REHEAT There were about a dozen varieties of pizza on display. We chose what we wanted and they'd reheat and serve it to us in our seats. Next to us was a long bar full stocked. The entire vibe of the place was very chill. A little dark. It reminded me of an old city pizzeria.",

Great prices (lunch specials are just $5.00 and include a beer!).  It's nothing fancy, but if you're looking for some awesome NY style \"by the slice\" pizza, this is your place!  We tried both the \"Balls to the Walls\" and \"Mystery (basically Hawaiian)\" slices.  The employees had a friendly vibe, with great senses of humor.  The whole place is decked out in Evel Knievel memorabilia, and they were even offering Wild Turkey shots in honor of his birthday the night we were there!  This place has a great local and down to earth feel, so if you're tired of the buffets and fancy restaurants it's the perfect place for a quick delicious meal before heading on to Fremont street debauchery!",

Much of an improvement from the previous F. Pigalle and Radio City Pizza tenants before. Loved the decor, the prices seemed right, et cetera.  Had to take off two stars for the staff. Considering the spot opened up six days ago, why was the staff so rude? They had the attitude of hipsters who had been there before Beauty Bar opened up. Hate to pull the hipster card but the staff was rude when we were trying to make conversation. Didn't offer us drinks, didn't greet us, wouldn't talk to us, saying we literally were too lively for them at 9pm just ordering food and no alcohol, complained about us taking too long, etc. At least if you're going to act like you're too great for everyone... earn it first. Honestly between Evel Pie and Pizza Rock, I would rather go back to the OG Pizza Rock and have friendly service.",

I was downtown waiting for a concert to start and I remembered about the deal at Evel Pie where you get a cheese slice and PBR for $5, so I was off to grab some slices and beer. The line wasn't long inside at all, but there was a good amount of heads at tables. They have a ton of pizza options and there's a display behind a glass case showing you what they have to offer. I got a cheese slice (cheesy rider) and pepperoni slice. There's fold and eat pizza that is legit and then there's fold and eat pizza because it's so floppy you have no other choice. Sadly this pizza was the floppy kind. When I picked up the pizza slices they belly flopped. There wasn't the slightest of any structure in the crust. It didn't taste bad, but it didn't taste great either. For $5 I can see why people come in for this deal because it's perfectly doable if you are sober or drunk and the slices are big. I would stop by again when walking around downtown for the deal if friends wanted to, but I'd personally order from nearby Pizza Rock when downtown and craving pizza.  They have 20 inch whole pies here at Evel Pie that range in price from $24-$30 if you want more than a slice.   Cheesy Rider $4 per slice Pepperoni $4.50 per slice  Specialty $5.50 per slice",

Unfortunately I don't make it downtown anymore as much as I would like to. My sister-in-law is in town and we were in DTLV for the second night in a row.  We were headed to first Friday and wanted to make sure we had something somewhat solid in our bellies before stuffing it full of junk food. We swung through Evel Pie and picked up a slice each. I was ecstatic to see such incredible pies on display. Such fluffy crust, chewy and delightful, this place does it right. Reminds me of my East Coast home. I grabbed a pepperoni slice, which after warmed up was extremely greasy but I sucked it up with a napkin. The husband got a cheese and my sister-in-law picked up a Greek slice of pie. Holy moly, we were delighted.   The staff was super nice, real people, and I loved the atmosphere. We will absolutely make Evel Pie a regular stop in our routine. It's super helpful that it's right next to where my husband works.  We got three slices and three bottled waters for $25. The cheese slice was four dollars, pepperoni was $4.50, and the Greek slice was $5.50. Pretty reasonable for such a bad ass pie.  This so-called Evel Pie was absolutely heavenly.",

The Goblin was covered in a very fresh tomato sauce, it was bright and had touches of garlic and oregano. Covered with sausage. It was very good. The pulled pork was covered with too sweet BBQ sauce for me. The pork was well smoked and tender. I added pepper flakes to give it the heat I like. Really good if you like BBQ. The third was the Veggie and I didn't try it. You could tell by looking at it, it was not very hot, which was the only complaint. It was devoured so I am assuming it was still good. Go and enjoy a very NY crust, loved the crunchy and chewy crust, it was fantastic!",

The Pizza is so darn good, we debated on getting a whole pie or some slices so that we could sample a few of our favorites!  We opted for delicious slices of the following!  World Famous Snake River Special- mozarella, rattlesnake sausage, carmelized onions and roasted red peppers.  Barry White- mozzarella, pecorino, fontina and ricotta.   Hog Heaven- bbq sauce, smoked mozarella, fontina, pulled pork, man candy bacon, red onions.   Classic Pepperoni  Garlic deez knots- garlic, pecorino & parsley with their famous Evel's tomato sauce.  The pizza is always delicious, fun and flavorful!  My favorite Evel house specialty pizza is HOG HEAVEN, that yummy bbq sauce and pulled pork brings me to climax.",

We came here after our friends renewed their wedding vows. There were 15 of us. We ordered lots of food, and all of it was good. Service was stellar.

I called ahead and asked if it was comparable to the normal pizza. They said its worth trying so i ordered it. Unfortunately it wasn't  as good as thier Normal pizza. while i have to admit i am ignorant when it comes to gluten free food. This pizza was airy and light. But not for me. You can tell alot about a business when they go out of there way to make a product for a select few who normally could not enjoy it. The owner and employees here go above and beyond to make sure your visit is the best it can be and for that i thank you.",

We went up to the counter to order different slices and beer, and were told to sit and wait for our names to be called. We didn't have to wait long.  Their special which I did is a beer and a slice of cheese pizza for 6 dollars. It's a good deal, you get a pint of PBR and a big slice of pizza. The beer was nice and cold which was good. The pizza is obviously the star of the show. The crust was light and chewy and had great flavor to it. It wasn't too dense and the dough wasn't too much in relation to the sauce and toppings. The sauce was a red sauce that had a touch of sweetness to it. And they made sure the slice was super cheesy. None of the ingredient outshone another one. They all complimented each other very well.  I have to say I was impressed that even though we all ordered separately we all got our slices within a good timeframe so no one was waiting too long. I was lap impressed that when one slice came out a bit toasty on the edges the person behind the counter told us that a new one was being made but we could have that one while we wait for the other to cook. The toasty pizza wasn't even that toasty and we said that we didn't need another slice but within a few minutes another slice had magically appeared at the table. Of course we couldn't turn it down and it was definitely not wasted. It was definitely a great experience between the service and the food itself. I will definitely be back.",

The manager DONNA let me sit there for 30 minutes waiting, while the people next to me got served. Unacceptable customer service, I immediately asked for a refund. Worst service I have ever experienced. I usually don't write reviews but how are not going to serve someone waiting that long after they paid.

Balls to the Wall ($5.50/slice) was my favorite because of the perfectly caramelized onions that paired well with the meatballs. 1 slice is definitely filling, but I \"accidentally\" ate 2 because I couldn't help myself!  Not only are the slices generous but all the flavors offered were also very unique. Of course there are the classic ones like pepperoni and cheese, but if you're in the area, I recommend giving their specialty pies a try!",

The restaurant has a hipster feel with really cool vintage evel stuff. The people that worked the days i went were pretty nice.   But im here to judge pizza. Its thin crust, which is what i like. I just dont think the taste is there to be considered a 'killer' spot. Ive had easily 20 better pizzas in my life. So the price justification isnt quite there and the hype is not met.  I guess it could be good for those that live here and dont get access to bomb pizza. Overall not too bad,  but id rather eat Rosati's thin crust or Biaggios just in vegas alone. They just lack branding and dont buy awards.",

There's a variety of Evel Knievel memorabilia hanging on the walls to glance at while waiting. The staff was very friendly and attentive.

The pizza is delicious, the Evel Knievel decor and atmosphere is fun, there's an Evel Knievel pinball machine to play, and the location near the corner of Fremont Street and Las Vegas Blvd is perfect!  Tip: Get the Passport parking App for easy street parking in the Downtown East area.  Pizzas are sold whole pie, as well as by the slice - and the single slices are very big! There's one Gluten free pizza option available for those who want gluten free The meatballs are delicious!  Good beer selection!  Note: order at the bar/counter, then pick up when they call your name from their bullhorn!  The only dis-merits I gave for this establishment: 1) Music was upbeat and fun.. but a bit too loud. It was nearly impossible to have a conversation with our group of friends who dined together when we visited last week. We would have preferred  the volume to be turned town a couple of notches. 2) Tables are a little too close together (Personally, I'd like just a teensy bit more space between each table)  Thus a solid 4-star rating. In fact, I'd give it a 4.5 rating if that was an option!",

From my vast pizza eating experience, this pizza sucks. Sorry EP, clean up your pizza act and quit giving your customers pizza crap when you have massive profit margins.  Edit & Response:   Yes Branden, I couldn't wait to get home and slam your crappy pizza. If it was killer, I would have told the world your \"award winning\" pizza was killer. It wasn't so I call it like I eat it. I won't fall for your bullying, sarcastic, intimidating type comments. The only reason you have so many customers is your location and ease of service. In response to your super price deals, no one informed me of that deal. If they did I would have tried it.   I hope you have a better day as well.  & I hope your pizza standards come up, or I was there on an \"off\" day perhaps.  ***ANOTHER  edit because the owner can't accept that her pizza TOTALLY SUCKS. Hey Jacka** FYI your pizza is crap and you know it.  For an owner your attitude sucks, along with your pizza. Beat it clown  Another OWNER CLOWN EDIT.... Owner calls me a joke and tells me he posted my review on his FaceBook account and hundreds of people are laughing at me. Wow I'm glad I'm so funny. Your additional comments are making you a Joke, you know your a clown because a reputable business owner wouldn't even come close to the clowning remarks you have. Your a CLOWN dude.

    "text": "Wanted to try this place cause they won an award for gluten free pizza. What I didn't realize was they have 1 gluten free pizza, the Olivia gluten free John.   So don't expect to get anything else. They are not very customer friendly, my wife asked for extra cheese and was told, nope, be too heavy on the pizza, asked for grenadine added to her coke, told nope, don't have it. Have a full bar but no grenadine?   Order at a Counter, no waitress service, for lunch at least and they bring you the pizza. Right after we got ours a homeless guy walked up to our table and asked if he could have some. He was quickly escorted out of the place.  Now for the food, both pizzas were really good. They 20\" is all of that, a huge pie with a thin crust very reminiscent of what I've had in a pizza shop in Brooklyn. Plenty of pepperoni was scattered across the top. The Olivia gluten free John was ordered with sausage and onion and was also pretty big, and being deep crust I managed to eat 4 out of 6 pieces. (We took the rest home, looked for the homeless guy to give him some but he was not around).   The music was so loud was nearly impossible to have a conversation. I guess I'm too old but I didn't enjoy the visit at all. Between the ear splitting music and homeless people accosting me, I was disappointed as I was really looking forward to trying this place. It was also expensive, a little north of 70 bucks for 2 pizzas and 3 cokes. I'd prefer waitress service for that kind of money. Pizza was good but everything else drags the review down",

Their specialty marinara sauce is nothing like I've ever tasted, and I've been craving it ever since.   I hope they open a second location closer to the Strip because we don't make it downtown often enough!   Note: They also have a pretty sweet atmosphere, it's a must-do if you're looking for cool touristy spots to hit up while in town.",

Everyone thinks that good pizza is about the toppings but it's all in the dough! Most slices are around $4-$5 so it's a good deal. Of course we ended up eating more, and drinking more but it was worth it!  Tip: Order the beer on tap or you'll be surprised at how expensive your bottle was!",

I grabbed the slice and threw it to some pigeons.  \"C'mon now, you're not eating this ill-conceived slop on my watch. Those toppings looked like deer pellets.\"  I marched him down to nearby Evel Pie, where we devoured some amazing pesto pizza and a trio of Grandma's meatballs.  Then he left like he was floating on nitrous oxide at the dentist, with this goofy grin, but his life seemed to change for the better after the intervention.  Lesson learned?  One slice of good pizza puts you in a better place than an entire 24\" drab-tasting pizza.",

It is a meat lover's dream filled with pepperoni, ham, italian sausage and bacon. It was hot but was a bit on the soggy side. However, it had just the right amount of cheese and sauce. I would go back to give it another shot.",

I am vegan and gluten free, which becomes a nuisance when eating out with a large group, but Evel Pie is the place to be for those special accommodations. I ordered a gluten free pizza with vegan cheese and a few veggies. This thing was so delicious that it was worth the $27 (yikes). The pizza it self was a DEEP DISH. Where have you EVER seen a gluten free deep dish pizza?! I am usually accustomed to the paper thin matzo style gluten free crust, so you can imagine my excitement when his beautiful creation came out. It takes 30 minutes to make, but while you wait, they offer a large array of schooling beverages (including ciders and gluten free beer). Once the pizza came it was flaming hot and crispy. The vegan cheese had baked into the sides giving it an extra crunch while the inside was soft and cooked perfectly! Shouts out to Kitty for being the most FABULOUS bartender ever and literally making my entire downtown experience far better!",

Upon arrival at the store we are told we needed to wait another 15 minutes and it was us that hung up on her which isn't True because I was sitting right next to my husband as she hung up on him, either way she was extremely rude about it that's not the worst of it. After arguing with me about the fact the we were the ones that hung up on her the front counter lady offers me a drink as she says \"for my trouble\" she serves me a drink which by the way I'm glad I never touched then she goes and whispers something to the guys making pizza the little white guy then looks at me and says well now she's looking at me and for good reason now I'm suspicious so I'm watching these guys like a hawk. Here's the best part there is a giant guy maybe Mexican and a little white guy the big guy stands in front of the little white guy and I watch the little guy turn around sneeze into his hand and continue making my pizza. I immediately asked for a refund.  I made the payment on my card and it was refunded 28$ but the lady at the counter also charged and additional $12.83 cents to my card maybe her tip for horrible service? No fraudulent.This was on the 1st of July 2019. I called the store the next day only to be told that the store doesn't have a manager and they would have someone call me back. I won't hold my breath. Whoever started this place started a good thing but to allow such a careless bunch to misrepresent you is and abomination to your vision.",

The type of people who are in this joint seem to be more grungy and wearing all black/biker wear, and the restaurant decor and vibe itself was a little dark and foreboding (I suppose it's consistent with the name Evel Pizza). So I wouldn't recommend bringing young kids as they might get scared. But the food was DELICIOUS. Their pizza crust is so good, and I would recommend their buffalo chicken wings any day (so fresh and crispy!!!).   This is a great catch for dinner or drunchies (drunk munchies)! And I might just be back in the next couple of days!",

Thin crust, NY style, cooked with a hint of char on the crust as it should be.  We got a pizza and pitcher combo deal that was reasonably priced and loved everything about it.  No pretentiousness,  just a comfortable,  chill environment  with some pizza and beer.  All good!",

You order at the counter, find a seat, and wait for your name to be called signifying that your pizza is hot and toasty. Slices run $4-6 a piece, and although we ordered one per person, I probably could have devoured two for dinner.   The had some basic slices (cheese, sausage, pepperoni) and some interesting creations (hog heaven: candied bacon, BBQ, sausage, ham & mystery slices). It was a nice easy place to stop, and I can easily see why they keep steady customers.   Was it the absolute best pizza ever? Nope. But it was easy enough to fill a craving.",

I'm from Cali and have been coming to Vegas since I was a kid and passed this place quite a few times in my past Vegas trips. This time (4/20) was a random turn around trip to Vegas and while roaming around Fremont st, I see a sign (cheese slice and beer $6). Sounds great to me. Now anyone can throw toppings on a pizza and it'd be a decent pizza. But if you can't master a cheese slice you're a buster. These people at Evel Pie ain't busters I'll tell you that. I will be back very soon, specifically for that cheese slice. By the way, stopped in at around 3 pm and had 3 cheese slices and 3 beers. It was so good that I went back at around 9 pm for another slice and beer   S/O to everyone working there by the way. From the dude that took my order to the cook making those pies and even the woman and man who cleaned up our table. Y'all are amazing",

We put in our order, took a seat, and enjoyed the atmosphere   20 minutes later we asked how much longer we would have to wait for our two slices. Turns out they had lost our order. They offered to put it in right away and give us a free slice if we wanted. We declined, just wanting our original order.   10 minutes later we are called. The pizza we were offered was not what was ordered. I pointed out that the order was wrong, and that we needed to go, so I would just like a refund.   Their response was that they could give us an entire pizza for no extra cost. Because we apparently wanted to wait even longer and possibly still not get what we asked for?  After again demanding a refund, finally someone agreed to refund our money. It took a few more minutes to process it, and they could not refund my card, but instead had to give me cash.   Instead of a unique local experience I got a major hassle and had to resort to fast food",

One might be attending the Fremont streets-bar for the late night pizza, the specialty drinks, or the back bar band performances. Although not everyone in the room might be a prospective daredevil, there is no doubt each person was searching for their own sense of adventure.  Last night's trip to the Evel Pie was an alternate route off the familiar beaten path of Fremont. There I hung out by the back outside door listening to new aged alternative music. Talked to a few old soul rock musicians. Lip read the lyrics of a few fantastic songs sung by the Donkey Jaw. Then rocked out to a few tunes performed by four Negative Nancies. For me, it was a most positive adventure indeed. One that left the door open for many more adventures ahead.",

We had seen there sign shortly after the shooting that mentioned that they were feeding First Responders for free. How stand up is that!! Our next trip to Vegas we returned for lunch and everything was just as good. We had a salad with our pizza and everything was amazing again. Needless to say this is on our Favorites list!

Also, they don't have Italian seasoning, garlic, or pepper flakes on the tables. This place is more about attracting tourists to spend money that it is about having a good slice of pizza. The slices were unreasonably thin. I got a cheese and a vegan slice and the vegan slice was just little bits of pepperoncini, olive, and onion on top. It's like they were thinking that people that don't eat meat or are vegan just like to eat less. All they had to do is put more vegetables on the slice and it might have been worth it. And they have the audacity to sell it for $6.50. And it's not like the cheese slices any better.  It hardly had any sauce on it and the cheese  wasn't even that flavorful. Again, less of a pizza place and more of a tourist trap. I don't think I've ever written a review on Yelp, but this place definitely motivated me to do it.",

The crust is thin, yet chewy, the toppings are delicious, the cheese is perfectly gooey.  We had slices of the Greek, the Barry White, and a Green pesto one, and they were all delicious.  Prices are reasonable, ambiance is inviting, and staff is friendly.  My new favorite pizza place!  I only regret that I don't live closer, as I plan to return often!",

Craig alone made our experience such an enjoyable one, he interacted with everyone throughout their whole visit and really made sure to keep everyone happy. When we first got there we waited in a bit of a line to order but it went super quick. The quantity of people kind of come in waves there it seems. At first it was really busy and there was no places to sit inside but plenty of nice seating outside.. super nice seating! Luckily we got to sit inside before our food came though which didn't take long but was also so hot and fresh when it came out. In total we got a slice of pepperoni pizza, a slice of hogs heaven pizza, and garlic knots. Everything we got had a unique flavor to it and my taste buds were very pleased! I'd totally come here again and again. I recommend this spot to everyone. Also every place needs a Craig!!",

Specializing in pizza (could you tell?), this place channels its inner Butte, Montana to provide the visitor with what feels like a pizza joint that has been here for decades (but in reality only moved in last month).  They do pies and slices. A few specialty slices are interesting: I like the rattlesnake which utilizes real snake and pheasant for the meatballs. What's more metal than snake meat on your pizza?!  What's pizza without beer? They have bottles, draft, and cans to choose from. Good selection of all. If you'd like something a little more heavy, they do have a full bar available, as well as wine.  Great service when I visited. They're doing a good job of working the tourist crowd while keeping things inviting for the locals, too.",

Took about 90 minutes at a very odd hour.  That would have been fine if the pizza had been worth it.  But this was some of the worst pizza I've ever had, and I'm pretty easy to please.  It wasn't even really edible.  Most of the outside of each square was burnt to a crisp.  It was so hard that it basically just shattered in my mouth.  My tooth kills now -- gee, thanks a lot.    And if that weren't enough, the middle part didn't even seem cooked.  It looked and tasted like raw dough that was insanely greasy.  I'm not sure how one manages to burn half of it until it's a black brick, yet the inside looks like it wasn't cooked at all?  Maybe the person who made it was new?  I hope so!  I washed my hands and still haven't gotten the grease off them.  The only reason I didn't give this a one is because I DID like the flavor of the toppings.   If the cheese and toppings were on a different pizza -- one that wasn't a combo of a brick and total mush, then I'd be just fine.   Other than that, not a happy camper.  Waited a long time just to throw it away.",

Thought it was just a bar till I saw they served pizza. I didn't think my son(6 years old) would want to go in cause of the music and him being autistic he doesn't like loud places. But he noticed the pizza too. He wanted to go in so we did and we're glad we did! I was nervous going in and waiting for pizza cause I wasn't sure if my son would stay for our whole meal with it having loud music and a small place but he did. The bartenders were super friendly they made him feel comfortable and complimented him on his mohawk. We liked how the pizza was put where you could see. They let my little guy pick what pizza and what particular slice he wanted. He was excited to get to do that since most places don't let you. The slices were big his eyes lit up when the guy pulled the slice he picked! Just want to say thank you to the staff again for making our visit memorable. It was just me and my two kids. With my son it can be hard to find new places to eat. He told my family after our visit about how cool this place was cause it had motorcycles and pizza! We will definitely be going back every chance we get",

    "text": "I am a total pizza lover and this place was not the one. Female staff are nice and they did offer a gluten free option which was needed. My boyfriends son is gluten AND dairy free. Even though the gluten free pizza was not coming with cheese and we were willing to pay more for toppings, they would not allow more than 3. They also served us our regular slices of pizza long before the gluten free pizza was done. I know it takes longer for the gluten free, but parents do not want to eat before their kids do. I didn't eat the non-gluten pizza as I just had a regular pepperoni slice, but it was not great and the crust was too hard to eat. The only perk of this place was my boyfriend's son seemed to enjoy the pizza whether it was good or he was just happy to finally have his food (as he is autistic) we will never know. The location is convenient, but if you want good pizza/service and are not pressed for time, I would take the extra time/hassle to go to another spot.",

I usually reserve that for Broadway, but this place could give them a run for their money.  When you walk in the door the bar and some tables are right there for you to sit. You do have to head to the cashier to order some slices and they have a few pizzas on display for you to choose from. The girls who bartender are always really cool and helpful too.  It's one of my favorite places downtown and I hope it stays there for quite sometime!",

The framed pictures all over the walls are mostly old vegas imagery, some Even Knievel/motorcycle stuff is hanging as well. I especially like the Evel Knievel arcade games in the back, I wonder where the owner found those gems!   The slices are delicious and the selection is big enough that probably anyone, can find something to eat. They don't concern me but I bet someone who follows a vegan or gluten free diet would appreciate those options on the menu. They are limited, but they're there. With the help of a friend, I tried four different, delicious slices and finished off with the Led Zeppole (fried dough).  I liked the variety of music too, ranging from Social Distortion to Peaches. I'm pretty sure I heard Styx too. Rock on! I'll be back for more.",

Nice, think, NY style pizza and Im all for it.  Now, this seems more like a local hang out, so prepare to see some interesting patrons.   I also enjoyed the Evil Knievel decor and inspiration for the place.   All in all, this place is interesting and feels inspired. Not bad for a quick bite to eat and most refreshing coca cola known to man. haha",

    "text": "Great pizza and a great music venue. This is not your traditional pizza place. It definitely has a punk rock vibe with evil Kenevil decor You can order your slice or entire pizza at the bar and they bring it out to your table during the day. This place is more bar like but during the day it's totally fine for kids. The pizza is amazing here the crust is excellent and they have a huge variety of toppings. My favorite pizza here is the gangrene. It has a pesto base sauce and cheese. The gluten free pizzas are the best I have ever had. The gluten free pizzas are pan style and the crust is so unique!  If you come here at night evil pie hosts some of the best local bands on the rear outdoor patio/bar. I definitely recommend coming here for the music seen.",

It was good, but not at 5 dollars a slice.  Definitely overpriced for a small slice.  I'm adding an addendum because the manager contacted me and offered to give it another try. The pizza was delicious, but I may of received a small slice. The cheese pizza slices definitely looked big and delicious. 4 stars for excellent customer service! Very refreshing to see people that care about their product. If I'm ever in Vegas I'll definitely try it again and recommend people go there because they want you to have a great experience! Highly impressed!!!!",

    "text": "This is a long-overdue updated review for Evel Pie.  The owner/manager is extremely friendly and customer service oriented.  He is always bringing in new musicians and specials at both of his locations.  He also makes a point to communicate directly with his patrons to resolve any problems.  Prices are reasonable for the downtown Las Vegas area.  Living in the DTLV area just a few blocks from Fremont, Evel Pie is a frequent stop for us, either to dine in or take out.  The place is always clean, the food hot, and the service fast and extremely friendly!  To me there is still an issue with the garlic knots.  They have changed their recipe but I still do not like them.  Perhaps it is just a personal taste.  To me they are dry, crunchy, and covered with olive oil instead of butter and very little garlic.  I am willing to concede this is a personal taste/preference and not really a problem with the garlic knots themselves as others seem to love them.  Literally everything else there we have tried is yummy.  The pizza is good, great big slices.  My favorite by far are the BBQ wings and their on tap Root Beer (best I've ever had anywhere!)  If you are looking for a fun atmosphere with lots of Americana and nostalgia THIS is the place you want to visit when walking around downtown LV/Fremont Street.  It is loud with rock music, which I personally love.  Be prepared for it to be crowded (always a good sign of good product and service) with happy go lucky people enjoying their time on Fremont Street.  Laid back, friendly environment with good eats.  A must visit DTLV location!",

It is disappointing when a group comes in and spends money in a restaurant, and then can't even sit down to enjoy our food. I wish the staff of this restaurant took their jobs more seriously. The amount of people in here ruined the atmosphere.   I don't think this restaurant is very good.

Evel Pie is the new Evel Knievel-themed dive bar and pizza place on Fremont Street, the walls are covered in \"Evel\" memorabilia, and the bar t-shirts and hats are great 70's styled throwbacks. Not like the normal cheesy Vegas gear, stuff I would actually be proud to wear.   I was here on a weekday at noon, and it was dead, but I see how this place could get packed and loud on Friday and weekend nights. I went with two slices, the White Pie with Garlic, Ricotta, Mozzarella, Basil and Black Pepper and a slice of the Hog Heaven pie with BBQ Pulled Pork, Bacon, and Onions.   Both slices were amazing; The White Pie was rich and full of flavor, and the crust added some great texture, crunch after crunch. The Pulled Pork Pie was a pig lover's dream, covered in pulled pork and bacon. Crunchy crust, cheese, pulled pork, bacon. I'm dead.   They offer a daily $5 beer and slice deal for happy hour, score! Coming to DT? Evel Pie is a must stop.",

We got lucky and there was a table waiting for us when we arrived.   I was joined by the bf and fellow Yelper, Kevin. Both interested in trying the rattlesnake pizza. I'm allergic to pork so I stuck to the Barry White. The guys enjoyed their pizzas although both agreed they still didn't really know how rattlesnake tastes. Personally, I assume it's for the best but I'm not that adventurous. My Barry White was delicious. My only complaint would be to offer more pork free options by the slice (although I realize I'm in a huge minority) but no one ever wants to split a full pie with me.   Tas does an awesome job behind the bar. She made sure we always had drinks and made me feel like a VIP! This is a great addition to downtown.   They also offer gf and vegan pizza but I didn't see any by the slice.",

    "text": "My new favorite pizza joint in town!! I thought the cheese was so delicious and its stretchy and delicious and I want it right now! The service is pretty good for downtown, considering the hipster vibe of the place. You get what you pay for, as far as quality, it was 5.50 for a medium slice but it was so worth it! I recommend getting two slices if you are hungry.  They have a nice selection of beers, fancy and non fancy and a couple of generic wine options. Its definitely a must do if you are in the down town area. You know what?? stop by even if you have to go out of your way, it is well worth it. Way better than the cosmopolitans over hyped \"hidden pizza wedge\" or whatever the hell its called.",

We asked the cook if it was indeed the rattlesnake slice because we never had it before, and couldn't tell where the sausage was.  All he said was yes...our thoughts was maybe the sausage was under the cheese or hidden under the peppers?  The guy next to us order it as well, but when it was served, the cook realized there wasn't any sausage placed on the pizza. Turns out we ate pizza with no rattlesnake.  Wish we could've had it the right way...and no we didn't ask for another slice and it was too busy to explain the mishap. I feel it could've been a better experience if it was right the first time.  One question: how the hell does the cook not know that the pizza is incompletely made?",

An added bonus is their window seating that allows you to enjoy all the inside and peek at the outside as those passer by's give you a little added entertainment!

    "text": "From the mind of the creator of Golden Tiki....  Actually, that's True.  Brandon Powers has teamed with Evel Knievel's son and other folk to make a new (and only I've seen) themed pizza place downtown.  It's next to where Insert Coin(s) used to be, and is literally a hole in the wall, as any good pizza place should be.  Again, as with Tiki, \"theme\" is key here, and the walls are fully decorated with memorabilia of the daredevil. One of the more impressive aspects is that the place feels dated and lived in.  It comes straight from the late 1970's-early 1980's, and feels like it's been around forever, which is a good thing, in my opinion.  Where so many things look sparse/artsy and pristine around Vegas, this place has some rugged personality, accompanied by a classic rock soundtrack.  The pizza is decent.  I'd like to try a few more varieties, but what I had was authentic \"pizza dive\" food.  Coupled with the numerous beers on tap, again, I couldn't help but shake the feeling that this was a place that you grew up with.  The arcade machine was broken, so that was a bummer, and again, I want to try a few more varieties of pizza (we had pepperoni and sausage with a salad), but the place had a relaxed vibe, and made me a little nostalgic for my youthful eating experiences.  Like Tiki, there's a lot to look at around the place, albeit smaller, so it's worth exploring.  It's a place that you've been to in your past, yet still probably haven't yet.  I look forward to sampling some of their other selections the next time I make my way there.",

When I asked about the loud music, the cashier told me that every time they turn it down the manager cranks it back up.  (I honestly can't think of one reason music needs to be that loud in a restaurant)  The pizza was reasonably priced, but was mediocre at best.  Between the noise and paid parking two blocks away, I don't think it will be worth a return visit.",

Having a culinary degree, my joy comes from being a part of other chef's visions and culinary journeys. Evel Pie, not only for its aesthetic and novelty, blew me away. Nostalgic for the long lost past of Radio City, I couldn't hope for a better downtown pizza replacement.  The food...to die for....the prices....worth coming again and again.  The service makes it worth the time you'll spend waiting for a perfectly cooked pizza with top notch ingredients!  Kelly, Chelsea and Ivana are excellent at what they do all with histories in the Downtown and local bar scene. I've followed them from location to location and this bar and it's food so far has been my favorite.  Do yourself a favour and join them for a slice of pizza and a beer for 5$, or stay all night like I do for the customer service and good times all around.",

Was pretty sure the girl who took my order heard me but when I got my ordered it was only 1 slice and 1 soda. I told her she was missing my other slice and soda and then she told me that I only ordered 1 slice. I told her I was looking right at you when you took my order, look at the receipt, why is it 14 dollars for only 1 slice? Since the receipt orders don't tell you what you ordered they could easily tell you to order and pay again. Which I think is really odd for a restaurant to not have what the customer ordered on the receipt. Overall the people here were really disrespectful, and you can barely hear or talk to them with the music blasting right in your ear and the megaphone with the next ready order blasting in your ear as well. I told the pizza cooks also that I was missing a pizza and they seemed really hostile like they wanted to fight me cause I was telling them how they messed my order up and how inconvenient it is that I have to pay and order again. Pizza was so dry, there is no customer service here, this place is truly evil!!!",

    "text": "Newest pizza place on Fremont street. First of all... they have a deal to get a slice of pizza AND beer for $5... enough said. It's Evel Knievel themed, giving the atmosphere a cool vibe. Their slices are huge and SO good. Its a slice that's thinner but packed with flavor. They have a huge selection. The vibe of this place is definitely cool to kick back, relax, eat, and go back to bar hopping. It's located right in the middle of the Fremont east bars making it very convenient to get to. I would suggest parking at the neonopolis garage or trying your luck at the free side street parking down the street. My service has always been friendly and fast. I love it and can't wait to eat here again!",

The staff was friendly but seemed more interested in each other than to help out customers. I was told my Gluten Free Pizza with 3 toppings would take about 20 minutes, truth be told it took 40+ as my whole table was served their entire orders it seemed they forgot about mine until I had to get up and ask and at first they looked lost then said \"oh yeah it's coming right up.\" I get this is a bar but if it is also a restaurant you should be able to hold a conversation without having to yell because the music is BLARING. At the end of the day this place just seems to be really over priced and over hyped. Definitely will not be a returning customer.",

So many different meats, cheeses, and other fun, unique toppings you could add, like RATTLESNAKE SAUSAGE. Yup, you read that right! Anyway, this place is great and pretty affordable compared to other pizza places in the area. NOTE: 20 wings for $15 is a great deal! And they aren't the wimpy little ones either.",

The decor and ambience of this place is super funloving, funky and eclectic. It's an outrageous homage to Evel Knevel and 1970's Americana.

    "text": "My partner and I really love Pizza  so much so that we even have Pizza tattoos. So we were excited, naturally, to try Evel Pie after a dance night on Fremont Street. We went in to get our pizza and were relatively pleased with the Pizza. My partner loved the Barry White slice; but the pepperoni left much to be desired. If we were just remarking on the Pizza, we would give an average 4 star rating.   However, we were mortified by the outright classist, anti-homeless, and possibly racist behavior they exhibited. My partner noticed that a young woman was sitting at a table with only juice to drink and no food. She decided to offer to buy the woman a slice. We suspected that she was homeless, and felt that she might want something to eat. As she approached the counter to place the order, one of the employees warned my partner that \"just so you know, she's in here all the time asking people to buy her pizza.\" He said this as If to encourage my partner to rethink her gesture. My partner was a little annoyed, but graciously thanked and dismissed his concern. However, soon after we noticed the security at her table asking her to leave. We were very disappointed to see that they actually packed up her food and forced her to leave, even though it was completely paid for, including the tip. She didn't appear to be bothering anyone and there was plenty of open seating. We were dismayed and disgusted... we couldn't even enjoy our meal and the pizza is forever marred in our minds. It felt even yuckier that the staff was all white and the woman was black.",

Paintings of Evel jumping  his bike, beer mugs and girls in daisy dukes adorn the entrance. There's a big window in the front with barstools and a counter, perfect for watching the hoards of people making their way to Fremont Street one block away.  Inside, the walls are covered with pictures and posters of the late great Evel Knievel as well as a bronze statue of the legend. There was a great selection of beers (bottles, cans and on tap) that included some long forgotten classics such as Olympia and PBR as well as IPAs, Lagers and Hefs. Although there were a large variety of pizzas by the slice, we decided on getting our own pesto cheese pizza with the addition of delicious ricotta balls. Despite the continuous influx of people stopping in for a quick slice and beer before their Freemont Street Experience, the pizza was cooked to perfection in no time!  The pizza was no less than amazing! The pesto dropped off the pizza with the melting cheese all on a light, delicious non overwhelming crust. As we enjoyed the pie, we were entertained by the music witch ranged from metal to Bakersfield country and a little bit of everything in between. It was a great experience! We took half of the pizza to go in our pizza box with a color drawing on the box of Evel Knievel l making one of his jumps with a slice of pizza in hand. As we carried the leftovers around Fremont Street we declined all offers for a slice which no doubt sold itself by the amazing aromas. As a life long fan of Evel Knievel, I will be mounting the beautifully illustrated box on the wall of my man cave. Evel Pie exceeded my very rigorous pizza standards and would have definitely would have made the daredevil himself proud!",

As the tile says Evil pie, it pays homage to the great Evil Knievel. With signage, pictures and even the old school video game and pinball machine, it is definitely themed appropriately.  The pizza was nice and thin and the reheat gave it a nice crispiness to the crust. Topping were also on point. I had the Hog Heaven, BBQ sauce, smoked mozzarella, fontina, pulled pork, \"man candy\" bacon and some red onions. It was loaded up to say the least and had some good flavors. it was kind of steep for one slice and the topping to crust ratio wasn't great. The slice had this thick end of crust when the could have stretched it out and covered the ingredients more on the pizza. Still in all not a bad tasting pie.",

It was dinner time, and I felt pizza would be a great dinner.  As I entered, I eyed the tent-sign at the door. It spoke of a six dollar beer and pizza deal. I was intrigued, and I felt like experiencing the six dollar beer and pizza deal for myself.      I walked up to the counter to check it out. I asked about the deal, and the lady behind the counter said 'it's a slice of cheese pizza and our house beer.'  I nodded and accepted. Six and some change later I had a receipt and they had my name. I found a table to sit down at and wait for them to call it.      Just a few minutes later, my name was called, and I retrieved my pizza and my beer. The beer was cold, and the pizza was hot. For six dollars, I was quite contented.  As I ate my pizza and drank my beer, I took in the place. I watched amusedly as a small child tried to play a very old arcade game. Doing a wee bit of research, this game is as old as I am! <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FStunt_Cycle&s=a27bc8c2136d90e3fae5ba11431be743eafc071bcb764dcc386cef66c2740c8a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St...</a> (Just in case you want to know how to play it when you visit.)       The place seems to be a shrine to the Evel Knievel. Who was an awesome guy to have a shrine too. I'm not sure why. But there's a bunch of stuff dedicated to him. Portraits, statues, pinball machines, and a stunt motorcycle very old arcade game. Maybe this place was started by his relatives? Maybe this place was just a huge fan of the stuntman's work? I dunno. But it's a fun place to pop in for a six dollar beer and pizza.      I'll be back on my next trip out to Vegas. Maybe I'll get something else. But thanks!",

    "text": "Wow what a great find! Opened my trusty Yelp app and typed in pizza, sort by rating and BAM I'm heading over to the best slices in Vegas!   Let me start by saying I am a pizza fanatic! Grew up in New Jersey and had pizza up and down the boardwalks from Wildwood, Atlantic City and Asbury Park as well as at the Big Apple of course.  I know what I like and am always looking for the best pizza when I travel.  When on vacation I usually have pizza every day and I'm always looking for something a little different.  ENTER: EVIL PIZZA'S AMAZING HOG HEAVEN SLICE!!!    For $5.50 you get an amazing crust loaded up with BBQ sauce, smoked mozzarella, fontina, pulled pork, candied bacon, red onion and some parsley to green it up a touch!  This is a serious slice and the mixture of sweet sauce and pork along with the slightly salty cheese blend is a match made in heaven!  'Now don't judge a book by it's cover' should be their slogan.  Doesn't exactly look like the fanciest restaurant in Vegas but sometimes the best food comes from joints like this.  It's actually a pretty cool motif and yes, it's evil because once you eat here you won't accept anything less!  Hooked for life!",

The balls to the walls suffered from being bland. The house salad was overcome by way too much Italian dressing.   Staff was friendly, but the price was too high for the quality. Memorabilia was cool, but not enough to make up for the less than average quality food.",

They are located very close to the Fremont Street Experience, so as was expected, finding parking was a challenge.  If you're alao a Evel Knievel fan you'll find plenty of memorabilia here to take a look at.  The young guy working behind the bar was friendly and informative. He recommended the meat lovers pizza and balls to the wall pizza.  Personally I found the pizza to be just okay... nothing to write home about.   If you're a Evel fan and are feeling a little hungry it's definitely worth stopping in and checking out.",

    "text": "I'd walked passed this joint while exploring Fremont St and after a night of drinking, I remembered the sign out front advertising $6 pizza and beer. Although the beer was tempting, but by the time my friend and I came here, we were already pretty buzzed so we decided to skip on the beer and just get a couple slices of pizza.  There was a pretty long line inside to place an order. It moved at a pretty acceptable rate since the line could only move as fast as someone placing an order and paying for it. I'm the type of person who will already know what I want by the time I get to the cashier to place my order, but I know that some people wait until it's their turn before they even begin to think about what they want. These people are the ones holding the line and I have to say, \"You suck!\"  Anyway, I placed an order for three slices of 'Hog Heaven' at $5.50 each and a slice of 'Cheesy Rider' at $4. Pricey? If I were buying these slices in Houston, TX where I'm from, then yeah. But for Vegas standard? They're pretty average prices so no, not pricey at all.  I didn't care much for the cashier. No smiles, no hospitality, nothing. Just a blank stare and a short, \"can I help you?\" when I was placing my order. I guess when you're working a long line, you get tired putting on a smile on your face? Or maybe because it was because it was super late? Who knows?  It didn't take them long to get the order ready. Probably less than three minutes because our order was ready not long after we took a seat.  The pizza was delicious! I'm not a fan of ham and I didn't even bother to pick the ham off my pizza! The crust on the pizza was good and crispy enough that it didn't crumble when I folded my pizza before devouring it.   And yeah, even though this is a great joint for a munch after a night of drinking, I can tell you that it's not just the alcohol talking. The pizza I had was delicious. My friend concurred. You should try it whether you're sober, buzzed, or completely drunk.",

But, I happened to be downtown and had a craving for pizza, so I figured this was the spot!  They have lots of varieties of slices, from cheese to more exotic ones, with all kinds of funky names and combinations, ranging from $5-$7 per slice. Of course, I can't remember the names of the slices we ordered, but mine was a meatball slice with mozzarella balls on it, and my boyfriend got the \"Goblin sausage\" pizza. Both were great! The slices were large, served piping hot, the dough and crust were delicious, and they had lots of toppings.  You basically stand in line, order your pizza, pay, find somewhere to sit, and they call your name over a megaphone. Luckily, we arrived right before the line got super long! This is a busy place, with a dive bar feel to it (they have a bar and serve all kinds of beers, if you're into them). Busboys clear the tables, but of course it doesn't have the cleanest feel to it.  But if you're there for the pizza and not a fancy ambiance- it's a winner! Go Evel!",

Service is very bad, the owner spends his time eating scraps and leaving trash everywhere.   This is not a very good place to go in Las Vegas. The owner likes to make things up about being voted #1 junk food restaurant on the west coast but this is a lie.   Update: Stay away.",

I'm giving three stars because unless you've been here before you'll have no idea how to get served when you come in I'm just used to being greeted and waited on but this is not that type of deal and that's cool but they could have a sign outside by the door or inside more visible however to their credit they do have two small signs further down into the restaurant that say \"order here\" \"pick up here\".  The cashier chick came off with an attitude but the actual cook that gave me my pizza was super cool and nice. Bottom line is this place is good but learn to put a smile on and welcome customers. I'll probably come back when I'm in town again since now I know what to expect and not to expect from this place.",

Evel Pie delivers on just that, plus they always seem to put a creative spin on their pizza slice options that sets them apart from all your other average pizza places.   Like for example, on St. Patrick's Day they had a corned beef and cabbage pizza that made this Irish girls taste buds happy as can be! Oh and recently I tried their Gang Green pizza slice which consists of pesto sauce and a hearty helping of melted cheese. Two simple ingredients that lead to one tasty slice of pizza. Pair any slice they have with an ice cold beer and you'll be all set for a great night.",

The decorations are super cute and almost every inch of the place is covered in something! Pictures, stickers, pinball machines, etc.  They have a hole in the wall kinda feel but I liked it! They even had Christmas lights up!  The pizza was pretty good. I went with a basic slice of pepperoni and for pizza by the slice, it was good. I don't know if it's good enough for a whole pie but it works for a night out on Fremont Street. The cashier was super friendly. The first time I saw this place was on a weekend, before midnight and it was packed. (People standing everywhere) When we went, there were about 10 people there, so it was loud at all.",

After wandering around Fremont building up an appetite, we looked around at a few options and decided that pizza sounded good.  With the cool exterior and punk rock music coming from inside we knew it'd be a unique place.  There's Evel memorabilia all around and interesting people. The girl that took the order was polite and friendly and they even went out of their way to make us micheladas which I know is not very normal for a pizza place.  They actually had some kind of local lime beer though and it turned out really tasty.  The bartender clearly knew what was up and it went great with pizza.  As far as slices, I'd say this is very good pizza, with great crust and quality cheese. I got a version of a hawaiian pizza with japenos which made me wonder why no one has ever made this before.  Great combo.  My date got some kind of \"Barry White\" pizza which she said was really good.  She is very picky about pizza and never offered me a bite AND ate all her crust which she never does so that really told me something.  Overall I loved the ambiance, decor and vibe and will definitely be coming back when I'm downtown.  It's a quick and fun way to refuel on your adventures that is also affordable.",

While the manager looked like he was high and just walking randomly around the building. No desire to help the line or the bar to Idk maybe help her out!  I order 1 slice of pizza. It took 15 minutes to reheat 1 slice of pizza. Domino's delivers in under 30 from scratch.  as my pizza slice is being burnt to a crisp as I'm now at the register asking for a refund , which the cashier/ bartender girl has no idea how to give me the refund, finally the guy walking around high on pot finally goes to help her out. Then as I tell him on the way out that it should never take 1 slice of pizza to take f**ing 15 minutes, he then says im kicked out and can never come back. Then keeps cussing at me while outside with 25 people walking by, Let's say this United States Marine kept it in check and left, i could care less if im kicked out or not, Pizza Rock is around the corner, no big deal. But hey customers if you want to wait in long lines with piss poor service and average pizza for over $ 5 go for it. Way to treat your customers, on 1st visit no less lol I'm glad the owner let's his managers work on the clock while high. Seems like a smart business decision. He's working in a kitchen how dumb are you to get high on the job. I hope for his sake that no innocent person gets hurt if he were to do something stupid in the kitchen, not sure if you can claim high on the insurance claim when it happens.

They have a special (when I was there over the Memorial Day holiday) that is get a slice of cheese pizza and house beer for $6. I figured I would give it a shot, I mean it's fairly cheap and the worst thing that can happen is I lose $6. I was nicely surprised. The beer is a golden ale that is crisp and has a smooth flavor. The pizza-oh man the pizza was what I didn't understand. So most places that sell pizza by the slice, scoop it up and throw it in a plate and hand it to you. Not here!! They warm the slice back up so you can thoroughly enjoy it!! I mean that's what had me coming back. It is a small place and don't let that stop you from coming in and taking your slice out back if it's a nice day or to go. Please stop in and say hello to Breeze and Donna. They were super nice while providing great service.",

Four of us were in the booth right across from the pick-up zone and started clapping for our friend Ryan as he got his pizza, being cheeky & naturally stoked. Not only did the door guy stop on his way to the back to start clapping with us, but the entire restaurant started joining in cheering--many people taking things to the standing ovation level, some on their chairs--and finally the pizza chef gods and servers all started banging on the metal shelving and counter tops. It was a good solid 10 minutes of pure effing comedic glory & good times. So thanks Evel Pie, not just for filling my belly, but my damn soul! Great vibes, great staff, great environment.",

Came in here for their happy hour this week. This place has their happy hour from 2:00 pm to 6:00 pm everyday. Pretty fantastic. Most places don't do a happy hour Friday through the weekend.  They had $3 drafts of Coors, PBR and Bud Light I believe as well as $4 wells. Didn't see any food specials though.  They did have a $5 slice of cheese and PBR.  Standard menu with some interesting toppings. Man candy (candies bacon) and rattle snake sauce definitely caught my eye.   I went ahead and got the traditional pepperoni. Like most of the by the slice joints, pizza is made before hand and they simply take a piece and heat it in the oven. Never been a fan of the pizza that's been sitting around for a while but this slice was pretty tasty. Thin crust and great sauce made this slice pretty epic.   They also have a salad option and a calzone as well. Staff is great. The vibe here was pretty amazing aw well. I believe the son of Evil Kinevil is one of the owners hence the shrine like set up behind the bar to the great daredevil.   Music is always on and the bartenders are pretty rocking too. Danny was new that night but she was definitely serving up good drinks and great vibes.   If you're looking for a cold beer and a decent slice in downtown then this is for sure the place to go.",

The big, New York style slices were ready to go, only a quick wait for a warm up. I love a good cheese slice so that's exactly what I had. It was just as perfect as I wanted it to be!

Coprolalia, the part of Tourette's that marks a person curse or use profanities. My husband was waiting in line with him and his aunt. An employee- which happens to be a transgender and Hey, no judgement made, live how you want. Anyway- she or he decided to tell my Husband that my son has to control what he says, my husband explained very nicely that my son can not control what he says, if he could he wouldn't say what he does, trust me- no one would choose to say this type of stuff or use these certain words. Put urself in his position for a moment.  Anyway, She or he still said \"but still, he needs to watch what he says-he cant say that stuff in here\" she embarrassed him and us and made a big deal. His disability is protected under ADA and just like \"him or her\" choosing to be seen as a different sex, he should be protected. Not everyone is the same. After we sat, they called attention to the manager on staff to report the issue. He seemed to take it seriously and I feel like he will handle the situation. He offered to take care of our Bill but that's not what we're after so we declined. We won't be returning, we just hope that they will treat others a little differently and maybe with a little more respect in the future.  Update- Branden the owner reached out and went above and beyond to correct the situation. We're very pleased with his and his staffs quick response. Dustin also reached out and between the two they have offered to help us spread awareness to Tourette's and we couldn't be happier. I wish more businesses would have the same values they clearly have. I'm very excited to see what the next chapter holds",

If your not a fan of his music you will be a fan of the pizza assuming you like ricotta cheese. I like to taste the ricotta in every bite so I spread the dollops across the entire piece. They have a special where it's a slice of cheese pizza and a  pint of there house brew for $6 bucks.",

I'm vegan so I ordered a Viva Las Vegan pie which is basically just a vegan cheese pizza. To make it anything, I paid for $10 worth the toppings and got a *sprinkle of each, at best. Meanwhile, there are pizzas on the menu for the same price boasting 5 toppings (3 meats, 2 veggies) not including the sauce and dairy cheeses. To say the least, I was underwhelmed by the taste and stunned by the pricing. I don't plan on frequenting this establishment. There are way better options than this place downtown.",

I remember when don't tell mama, the beat coffeehouse and even insert coins used to inhabit a world that I find a tough time to relate to,but that's just because I'm not in that 21-25 yr range anymore . I'm not a spring chicken anymore and can't handle my hangovers like I did before , 5 drinks = 2 days to recover, this is 29 y'all  .   We came to evel pie on a whim, hungry and thirsty. We were downtown for LIB festival and everything was over priced and appetizer sized portions, which if you're drinking , you need something hearty and substantial  . Small portions and $15 for a shitty beer, no thanks . I saw the signage for $6 slice of cheese pizza and beer = winning .   The staff was nice and very accommodating and patient. There was a large rowdy crowd of people who've been drinking and partying all weekend, and evel pie was on that main stretch to get to the festival, so they got a majority of that crowd . Overall wait time was fair and there were even some seats at the bar . The beer was something similar to a bud light or even a Michelob.  The pizza was great and pretty big as well.  The layout was funky and cool and had that 80s-90s nostalgia that created a fun atmosphere and it wasn't too stiff or stuffy that you can get a certain bars . The cheese pizza was damn good and was the closest to NY Pizza that I've had in a while, and it was affordable . It had that nice char and chewy crust, the cheese was gooey and hot .   You have to finish your beer on the patio before exiting . So if you plan on drinking or bar hopping, try and take your time or just slam the beer back and carry on .",

Of course there is an Evil Knievel statue in back that attracted my friends to pop a pose.  My husband instantly became fanboy and had many photos taken.  There is also a pinball machine plus tons of memorabilia.  Typically if a place is themed well the food and drink are horrible.  Evil Pie was neither of them and had great deals on some slices and booze.  The pizza was great - unfortunately I can't describe in detail because I was a few cocktails into our Vegas journey.  Everybody loved their slices so I will take that as a thumbs up!  Other reviews stated there were huge lines but maybe our timing was divine because we got a seat and waited a minute or so for our slices.  This and Atomic Liquor should be part of your downtown perp walk!",

I somehow managed to get out of bed and meet up with a friend in Downtown Fremont. He'd been living in near Downtown for a couple of months now and had highly recommended Evel Pie.   Just by the look of the outside I already knew I was going to like this spot. Plastered with stickers and an awesome mural to the man bearing the establishments name, this place is simply badass. The inside is like a divey museum to all things Evel and anything else circa his prime.   Now to the pies; I got a slice of The Goblin Sausage which is perfect for any meat lover and The Hopper which had actual grasshoppers! First time eating chapulines so I was pleasantly surprised. They tasted like sardines with a hint of dirt lol. They were both huge and delicious (pause). Topped it off with a Golden Road Mango Cart and slowly but surely my headache/hangover was going away. I wish I could have ate more but I feel like I would have thrown it up.   They host gigs in the back so if you're hear at night take a peak.   Now time to walk it off and people watch down Fremont St.",

The lace gets crazy loud so you have to listen carefully to head your order called. It's also a bar so it has beer and cocktails. The pizza flavors include a few vegan ones and comes as slices or wholes.   Atmosphere here is crazy and loud. Inside it gets ridiculously loud and because they call your order from the counter it's easy to not hear it and not know your order is ready. The inside kind of looks like someone's garage with all the bicycle parts and stuff. It has all kinds of memorabilia. There's lots of pictures of Evel from his famous stunts and personal pictures from his childhood and of his family too. Music selection contains lots of classic rock from the 1960s and 1970s, his stunt riding heyday. The food needs to be mentioned too. By checking in, you get a beer and a slice for $6, which is totally mind blowing. It has a good selection on tap. The Evel Ale is the house beer, so just go with that. As for the pizza there's a few slices at the counter. They always have a vegan one. It may be the Veg Out. It comes with grilled vegetables and sauce, without cheese. The other is the Viva Las Vegan. It comes with vegan cheese. There's also other menu items like meatballs.   It might be very hard to find seats for a large group. It's very popular with the crowds on Fremont. Part of it is the novelty, but the pizza is genuinely good as well.",

They do full size pizzas which are pricey, but hella worth every penny.  If you enjoy divey joints, good music and great service you have to check out Evel's Pie near the heart of Downtown Vegas off Fremont Street a great place to start off the night or the day with hearty food.  I personally think it's one of the best pizza I've had in Vegas and came highly recommended, by both locals and visitors. Enjoying the veg out with a tall boy of Lagunitas was something I hope to do again here.",

I pre-ordered our garlic knots ,bbq wings and dessert dough that I can't remember the name. Anyone I ordered directly thru Yelp.  Upon arrival Trevor was super helpful advising my co worker of what slice to go with . I went with the pesto slice. I let Trevor know I ordered online and he let me know it was ready and got my order. I waited for my slice and my co workers did too .  We sat and enjoy our appetizers waiting for our slices . During our visit Prince came out offered us water and cleared our table .  Not only is it fun to visit but also has yummy pizza by the slice or a whole pie with amazing service for the win!",

Open late, which is great for their location. Counter ordering with all the pizzas to view behind the glass at the counter. It's a quick in and out for us. Two thumbs up!",

Wanted to try it Cuz of all the reviews and I was a little disappointed. I had very high expectations, but it didn't live up to it.  Their pizza is as much is their beer. $4.50-$5.50 for one slice. Yes it's a big dice, but u can get a bigger slice at sams pizza and it's ot and fresh. This pizza has been sitting out for a bit and then they reheat it. Reheated pizza isn't the best.

Also they have Oly Beer and Hamms Beer which I have not seen in years. Awesome!! Now for the pizza...it is really good and maybe the best pizza I have had since moving to Las Vegas 4 years ago. The staff is friendly and helpful, the place is a very cool place to have a pizza, a few drinks and hangout. Oh yes...the music they play is always great and makes the atmosphere here even better..Adding to this review as this place has become my hangout since my original review...I have been frequenting drinking establishments for many years and I will say with total honesty that in all my travels and all my years I have never been to a place as awesome as Evel Pie....",

The music they play in this place was excellent. We kept pulling out Shazam going, \"damn I know I remember this one, but I can't remember the name!\" The nostalgic stuff all over the walls also kept conversations going with a lot more of the, \"oh yeah, I remember that!\". I had to take a picture of the Billy Squier bumper sticker that looks like it came from Detroit's WRIF/101.1 in the 80s and send it to my brother. Definitely a do-over the next time we are looking for pizza on Fremont East, which is pretty often.",

We would then run outside, build flimsy ramps, hop on our bikes, and then jump over strange objects until someone crashed and ended the fun.  This place is not so much a destination, as a pilgrimage for all us kids who received scars as we emulated the greatest daredevil of our age. The place is small inside, and loaded with some of the best Knievel memorabilia one can find.  It even includes his trademarked video game and pinball machine!  There's also a small, portable TV with a video loop of some of his more famous jumps.   As for the food, I opted for the Pizza Slice and Beer combo for $5.00.  That deal gets you a large slice of cheese pizza, with a pint of PBR- definitely a throwback to Evel's heyday.  It was delicious, BTW.  There were other pizzas you could buy, and the bar had plenty of libations available.  I couldn't imagine drinking anything other than beer or a straight whiskey there, though. So, for anyone who finds him/herself longing for something different in a town of 'differents', this is a great place to visit.",

Only in Los Angeles which was good as well, and popUp pizza which is also around this area downtown vegas, the thing I like about pop up pizza is that have a specialty vegan pizza so they don't charge you per topping like this place does. But it's really good and could crave a pizza craving from a newly vegan like me. Subtract one star only because the place was kind of a hassle to get to. Having to find parking, and it's downtown on a busy street. It was kind of a ridiculous hassle to get to just for a take out pizza. If I hadn't all ready paid for it online I probably would have just left like I don't want it that bad...  lol.. if they want to or other business in a high traffic areas want to sell take out more, they should probably have a back drive threw area, or advertise that they will send someone out so you can just drive threw and pick up your order if you all ready paid for it. So people don't have to find parking, or deal with the hassle of large crowds cause I was not trying to be social at the time I was just trying to get take out and go back home. Lol.. this would be a cool place to hang out w friends tho. It has a hipster vibe thing going for it. It's a cute little spot. And they have vegan pizzas that actually taste good, even just cheese. I got cheese w extra cheese ate a couple slices then saved the rest for later and added my own vegan toppings on each slice later. FYI they sell vegan pizza as well as a lot of other vegan things at sprouts grocery store. For newly vegans who don't know.",

The meatball slice was my favorite with the caramelized onions.  Highly recommend.  I beat the crowd there so I was able to grab a seat at the bar",

I go into the back and he's standing with two white women in the alley trying to spit his game at them apparently and I'm standing right next to them and he tells me that I have to move and that they are fine right where they are I'm sorry because you thought that they were going to suck His dick.

But most importantly my wife, who is gluten sensitive, REALLY enjoyed it, and that's what truly matters. I have to say Branden, and the staff there truly went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our return visit.   Myself, I tried the meatballs for an appetizer, and a slice of cheese. Both very good. The marinara on the meatballs was out of this world good!    Thanks again Branden, and staff at Evel Pie!!  You truly understand the meaning of exceptional customer service, and you gained customers for life with your willingness to reach out the way you did, and as quickly as you did. You truly have a gift when it comes to pizza making (I consider it art!!) and your talent really shows.",

When you walk in you are greeted with an awesome bar, pinball machine (Evel Knievel themed of course), and some booths in the back. There are tons of flavors of pizza to try and tonight I opted for a couple of slices of the Goblin Sausage which is topped with sausage (duh), bacon, pepperoni, and all the gooey fatty cheese you could ever wish or dream to have. The dough is rolled right there in shop fresh from scratch and the pizza sauce is also made fresh so you know automatically the pizza is going to be more amazing than any Evel Knievel stunt. This place is surprisingly cheap with a slice of pizza running around 5 bucks (for my slice). A slice of plain cheese is probably cheaper but I ordered one with a good amount of toppings.    The service was phenomenal as well and I was treated more like family than a guy who just walked through the door. I felt so welcome here and felt as though I had been coming for years even though this was my first time. So now onto what you all care about which is how the pizza actually tasted. First off trust me when I say I've had a lot of pizza in my life, I've had cheap fast food style pizza and I've had overpriced 30 buck hipster pizza that is organic and tastes like van carpet. Let me tell you that no pizza I've ever had compares to how tasty Evel Pie is. I mean the crust isn't too crispy, the sauce is tangy and has the right amount of kick, the cheese is perfectly melted to where you get those little crispy parts in the middle, and the slices are nice and big New York style slices. You just can't find pizza this good anywhere else in the city and I've tried. They even run a deal where you can get a slice and a beer for 5 bucks in total. All in all I love Evel Pie and I will definitely 100% be coming back to this place whenever i'm craving a slice of pizza or when I wanna cheat on my diet. Great place for locals and visitors alike.",

Good beer selection Tasty big slices Fantastic decor  This will be a hangout spot at least once or twice a week for me. So glad this place exists.  Oh also, $5 gets you a beer and a slice. Can't go wrong with that when you're hungry downtown.",

The place was pretty busy so I didn't expect quick service but the person taking our order didn't even acknowledge us. My sister told the woman that it was our first time there and that we are vegan so is their some recommendations she had and the woman acted as if my sister didn't say a thing to her. We ended up getting four slices of vegan pizza and they put two slices on the bottom and two on top, causing the cheese on the bottom slices to get stuck to the paper. Literally all the cheese was stuck to the paper and I had to use a spoon to scrap it off and put it on my slices. I ordered four slices of vegan pizza and two order of vegan meatballs but only received one order. It cost us $34 dollars and while the food was good, the service was horrible and not worth it. The only reason I'm not giving a one star review is because the vegan pizza was actually delicious.",

They are open really late as well and the line is long as well.  I saw they were one of the best and I could not agree more as the crust was good.  It is $5.50 a slice for their specialty so be prepared to pay quite a bit of money for a slice.  They make the slices fresh as well and eat it up which is really nice so when you get it, the pizza is nice an hot.  Definitely would come back here that is for sure.",

Price is a bit more than I usually pay for a slice of pizza, but that's how it is with cool bars/restaurants, right? Few extra coins for the atmosphere.  I definitely would like to return sometime with friends, get a whole pie (or a few) and some beers and kick it there. Great place for a photo/video location, too - in case anyone could use that.",

A slice of pizza and a beer is advertised for six dollars; they also have a variety of craft beers on tap to down with your pizza. I had the Barry White pizza which had fresh ricotta a touch of nutmeg, mozzarella cheese Romano cheese it was fresh the crust was New York style with a light crunchy edge and foldable. It was delicious. husband got the meat lovers pizza with sausage pepperoni sausage and pepperoni was fresh and meaty, he enjoyed it. vegetarian looked delicious other varieties look delicious too!  The interior is decorated with various memorabilia of Evell Knievel and his many stories and pictures of the 70's and 80's.

The walls are lined with not only some incredible Evel Knievel photos, but also photos of Vegas legends like Wayne Newton and Siegfried & Roy. There are Evel Knievel toys sitting high above on shelves and a bike hanging from the ceiling. There are also 2 functioning games, a stunt rider arcade video game and a pinball machine.  Now back to the pizza. They serve up pretty large slices, and the best things to order are the ones that sound like odd combinations or toppings. We split a slice of the snake river pizza, which is topped with sausage made out of rattlesnake. I also enjoyed a Maui Waui slice which is a classic Hawaiian pizza, but with added jalapeno slices (which is how I'll be ordering my Hawaiian pizzas from now on). The pizzas are made with a cracker thin crust and are heated again in the oven before being served to you, so don't be worried about lukewarm pizza, because it will come out of the pick-up window screaming hot.   This is a fun spot that I'm looking forward to taking friends and family from out of town to when we take them down to Fremont street, as it's not even a block away. I enjoyed coming here and I can't wait to come back again.",

    "text": "I debated between 2 and 3 stars for this review. I opted for 2. There was nothing that morally offended me about this pizza, but I was also just disappointed.  The decor here is cute - very Evel-themed. Parents, be warned that some of the decor is not exactly child-friendly.   The staff definitely fit the theme of the bar. They seem to be very friendly with regulars. They aren't so friendly if you aren't a regular. We were first over-charged, and the cashier wasn't too happy when we asked about it. Then, when she corrected the total, we weren't asked if we would like the change. It was just assumed that we didn't want it.   The pizza was okay. It was easily some of the thinest pizza I have ever had. We are talking paper-thin. The pizza just sorely lacked any flavor. Even the pepperoni on the pizza needed more flavor.   This is certainly not a pizza I would go back for. It seems targeted more so to the drinking crowd.",

If you are downtown Las Vegas I would highly recommend grabbing a slice at this hole in the wall!",

    "text": "I wish I would've gotten names but I used to love to drop by this place every time I was downtown hitting up bars with my friends. My last experience was about 2-3 months ago and I haven't been back since.  I'm sure this happens all the time with them but I was mistaken for someone acting like they never got their pizza order but actually did. It was a very busy night for them, I saw and was patient. I had been waiting for about 10-15 mins with no pizza in hand. I ordered 2 slices. I saw customers that ordered after me get their orders, so naturally I checked in on my pizza and I was rudely told that I already was served and given my slice, when I actually did not (side note: the guy behind the counter was talking it up with a girl and i may have interrupted a good conversation ). Someone behind the man that was \"helping\" me assured him that the slices they were doing for me burned, so they were preparing new slices. Another 10-15 mins pass and I checked in (still politely and tired from that night's festivities) and the same aggressive man yelled at me this time and said \"what are you still doing here?! You already got your slice. I'm not giving you another one\". The gentleman behind him over heard and told him, \"no her slice is almost ready\". Once I came back up for my slice, the man who has been giving me trouble gave me the \"stank face\" (he was no longer behind the counter, he was now interacting with some friends that entered the restaurant). I get it, I'm Asian, I look like every other Asian, but I promise i wasn't that girl you previously served a pizza slice to!  Anyways, leave one bad impression and leaves the customer not wanting more. Sorry for the long review, hoping it'll bring some light to the customer service aspect!",

Since living in Vegas now going 3 years , good , great pizza is hard to find . Locals tend to stay away from the strip ,,so we're always looking for a place that not only is welcoming but also provides a great environment for locals !  The one place I always come back too ,, I don't mind dealing with tourist , traffic or finding parking is Evil Pie !! The slices are a fair size and the atmosphere is amazing back bar , or eating at window lookin at cowards passing by on Fremont !! We try to make it out at least twice a month , and after attending shows on Fremont we differently make our way to Evil Pie !! Pies always fresh and tasty , and the price with a nice cold adult beverage won't hurt your pocket book!!  So next time you in town visiting , or out on the town , make your way to evil pie .. a vegas favorite..",

Also they charge extra for ranch. They got my order wrong by not giving me the amount of slices I paid for and no apologies. The table we sat at was so wobbly every time we make a move our drinks would spill out I told the girl at the register and she just laughed. Also took a long time to get our food.

I always get it but once I a while try their more avant-garde options. And my girlfriend can come too! She's vegan and they have options for her. Great environment. Great beers choices. Just overall a dream of a pizza spot. Go get your grub on!",

The garlic knots had no flavor, it was basically plain buns with some oil dumped on it, could not taste the garlic. The wings were basic and didn't have much sauce. Overall, I was underwhelmed by this, and disappointed due to all the great reviews. None of the items really stood out, it was all pretty average and forgettable.",

    "text": "Evelly Delicious!!!  We were walking around Fremont on a very busy Saturday night, a semi decent band was scheduled to play on the main drag so the place was poppin.  We stopped at my favoriate outside bar which is located at the Golden Nugget and ordered some very large cocktails.  We did the loop around Fremont, and once we got towards the end we decided to grab something to eat.    Spoke with the bouncer at the door and he said we could seat ourselves.  Luckily they sale their pizza by the slice, so I ordered 10 slices of different varieties (For 5 people) and we waited a bit for it to be warmed up.  Evel Pie is pretty hipsterish, and it was certainly busy but we were able to find a seat.  We probably waited a total of ten (10) minutes and our slices were ready.    It may have been the booze talking, but this is some delicious friggen pizza.  Everyone pretty much devoured whatever I ordered no questions asked.  Thin crust, great flavors and just solid goodness and not too greasy.  Definitely very close to NYC pizza, and probably the best I have ever had while in Vegas.  Definitely make this place a pit stop to re-fuel, and get something in your belly to compete with all the booze.  Even if you don't drink and are in the area, you better stop by and get a slice you won't regret it.",

    "text": "Full Review can be found in the blog.  Opting to dine family style at the kitchen's discretion, a few Beers plus a punchy local Root Beer in hand, the first look at Evel Pie's product since their Grand Opening shows that the kitchen and their ovens have already improved substantially with a bit of seasoning, the multipurpose Dough used to make everything from Garlic Knots to Zeppole baking up with a good char and just the right amount of stretch plus a cornicione that bubbles just enough to let patrons know that nothing here is rushed, the crispiness and air pockets imparted by giving the yeast  enough time to ferment.  Offering both whole Pies and those by the slice, the former obviously a fresher choice though those arriving during peak hours are rather certain to receive a hot slice straight from the rack, it was with five different combinations of toppings that opinions were formulated of a Pizza that manages great consistency by way of good Ingredients and a 50/50 Mozzarella that is not applied overzealously, the \"Cheesy Rider\" and Pepperoni Slice with Cup and Char-style rounds always available for purists while \"Hog Heaven\" with housemade Barbeque Sauce plus Brown Sugar Bacon, Pulled Pork and Red Onions is more of an acquired taste, the \"Goblin Sausage\" taking the idea of 'Meat Lovers' pretty seriously with Pepperoni, Ham, Italian Sausage and Bacon while the \"Barry White\" Pie features puddles of Ricotta and Fresh Basil atop a light Garlic Sauce.  Smartly offering his own style of Meatballs as an appetizer, the three for $8 Orbs tender and supple in a pool of crushed Tomatoes, additional items from \"Evel's Sides, Salads, and Other Stuff\" include a Caprese with Fresh Mozz and good Balsamic that would not be out of place at most of the Strip's fine dining spaces save for its service in a take-home tin, the Pizza-joint staple Buffalo Wings a bit less surprising, though still quite good for those who are into such things.  Lingering over good music, great conversation and what was already plenty of food, it was with the dining room really revving up for business that Justin brought forth \"Evel's Giant Hot Pocket Rocket Calzone,\" the three Cheese blend inside what is literally a whole Crust folded over soon to generate a 'Cheesepull' that exceeded four feet of creamy texture and a whole lot of flavor while Vincent's now-famous Gluten-Free Pie arrived shortly thereafter, the \"Detroit-style\" Deep Dish subjected to a double ferment that has thus far limited the restaurant's capacity to keep up with demand for something that is not just 'Celiac-friendly' because it is trendy, but truly a passion project with a crispy edge and buttery softness that seems almost impossible to achieve without the elasticity typically associated with Wheat Protein.  Rounding out the night with 'Led Zeppole,' the obvious reference to a band who named themselves such because they figured the idea would quickly crash, Evel Pie's Dough defies the idea of a heavy Doughnut by generating small Puffs that emerge from the fryer light and virtually oilless, the powdered sugar dabbed-on as opposed to being dumped over allowing the yeastiness to come through while a sidecar of Chili Flake Honey is an idea so simple and satisfying that one wonders why they've never seen it before.  ****1/2Taking the concept for what it is, the marriage of a high-flying Daredevil's relics to a Pizza Joint circa 1972, Evel Pie has achieved a tremendous amount of success in under four months by pairing a passionate Pizza Man to an owner willing to take some chances, the answer to every New Yorker's prayers answered in a rather unlikely place with the only questions remaining just how much better the 'slice' can get, and what these guys will come up with next?",

We each got a huge slice for only $5 (we got the all-meat one) and it kept us filled until dinner. We almost got a whole pie for around $28 and it comes with 8 huge slices and I'm glad that we didn't. There was no way we could've finished that. It would've been a great deal if we stayed close or if we had dinner there because leftover pizza are always good for breakfast. The Diet Coke comes with free refills. My teen son did get a bit \"shocked\" when he tried to use the men's restroom. I had to take him to the women's restroom with me. It still had the same graffiti covered grunge look and a bit dark.",

    "text": "This is classic New York big slice pizza with gourmet options. If you are looking for California pizza kitchen's bourgeois offerings or a \"oven roasted yuppie'za\" you are going to be disappointed.  This place gets greasy, fatty, big slice punk kid pizza. This is the kinda pizza you get before you skateboard or play pinball.  It is also very good New York style.  The ingredients are top quality. The sauce is actually very sophisticated in a non-gastro-pub, throw back to OG Italian way. I think I taste a hint of star anise. And you can make it fancy with some rattle snake sausage. Who else has that? There are gluten free and vegetarian options. I wouldn't say they are healthy, but this is pizza. Pizza isn't a health food, it is an indulgence.  What is also brilliant about this retro pizza is it fits the 70s-80s height of Evel's fame. The food matches the decor.  Also, this place participates in a ton of community outreach. It provided meals for the recently unemployed MGM workers and donates to a different charity event every weekend.  You need to go here and not be a pizza snob; expecting the crust be fire roasted over angle farts.  Also if you show up at night, on a weekend, on Fremont and expect immediate service and the tables to instantly open up...I mean I guess some of us are just from small towns and dont get how the big city works.",

You may have to wait a while on the weekends but it is worth the wait. It's a pizza shop right on Fremont St. just west of LV Blvd. They serve pizza (of course), salads, wings, garlic knots, and meatballs. When I went to was slammed with First Friday going on and took a long time to place our order. They have slices starting at $4 and going up from there. They have a could different kinds of pizza. I went for the standard pepperoni for my first time. They also have a white pizza, vegan, and some others. Once we placed the order we got the pizza pretty fast. They call out your name on a mic. It was hot and ready to go in my mouth. I devoured the slice in seconds. I should have ordered some extras because I was hungry but alas we continued on your drunken path.",

    "text": "This is a great pizza spot in the middle of downtown Las Vegas. I went in because of the sign outside promoting a slice of pizza and a beer for $6!!  That's all they had to say.   I did however go with family here & because of the feel/atmosphere very bar-like, my mom was really hesitant. I calmed her down a bit and the server (who was awesome) mentioned a back open patio.   We headed back to the patio and it was empty, very cool set up & some music came on eventually to avoid awkward silences. Then when the pizza and wings came out, we were amazed!! Honestly some of the best pizza I've had in a while.   The winners were the wings however. We ordered some buffalo and bbq wings & both were finger licking good. I would I definitely stop by here again the next time I'm in town but maybe not with family lol",

They have a good selection of pizza by the slice and a decent selection of beers, soft drinks or water depending on what you need.   The Evel Knievel theme is pretty cool to see too.   The folks are super friendly and the crowd is pretty mellow.   All in all a little oasis in the desert.   Great job guys.",

Pizza's always good, let's see if the place lives up to the hype.  Answer: YES, absolutely yes!  The pizza was good. We tried different types and all of them were good well except I ordered the veggie (I couldn't see the pizza in the display box cause it was on the top shelf - this is what happens when you are short :-)) and it was really an olive pizza.  Just way too many olives.  They were kind enough to change it our for me for the pesto one.  So hungry and those pie slices were so good, I forgot to take pics.  LOL.  Just go here, seriously.",

It is an homage to stuntman Evel Knievel and has pictures and memorabilia all around the restaurant to gaze over.  The music is loud and the staff are super friendly as you approach the bar to pick your pizza. They're all served fresh and sit for minutes in the window before they have a hungry pair of hands to snap them up! As such, you can see exactly what to pick from and the ingredients list is infront of them too.  The pizza bar doubles as drinks too and you can order most things from shots, pitchers and beers. Reasonably priced for the size of the slice and location of the place, Evel Pie is not necessarily a romantic, calming hotspot but it is full of character, is super fun and has a chilled, friendly vibe.  Downtown and craving pizza? This is the place for you!",

Always a good crowd of people and the environment is perfect for a late night bite.   The grit is part of the charm and while it might look intimidating from the outside it's actually a well oiled machine.  As far as pizza you're looking at a NY style thin crust pizza with premium toppings. Thin crisp crust on the bottom with a great sauce to cheese ratio. Their toppings and combinations are great.  My one criticism about this place, which might not bother many is the outside crust is SO THICK. Like a breadstick surrounding the pie. For me that's too much and makes the pizza feel more doughy than it is.   I love stopping in her when I'm downtown. With Pizza Rock, Naked City, and others in the area this easily stands above them as the best pizza option downtown.",

I was originally from the NJ/NY area and spent a fair amount of time in those area finding the hidden treasures in Pizza. Cut to the present and I am out searching Las Vegas for the best pizza experience Southern Nevada has to offer.   I purchased a large caramelized onion and roasted pepper pizza with candy bacon on half. It was truly a large pizza, too big for my pizza bag, I will give them that, but from a taste perspective nothing special. Like any pie I could get in any town in Bergen County NJ. The difference is in NJ it would have cost me probably near 20 dollars on the high side and at Evel Pie it was 36 dollars. Like I said it was big so that probably justifies a higher price and its sitting on Freemont St downtown, maybe that's another justification, but 36.00 is a lot of money for that pie in my opinion. But I think it was a letdown with all the hype of the positive reviews. I will not be going back and I would highly recommend Amano in North West Las Vegas or Naked City Pizza near Chinatown or even the Secret Pizza in the Cosmopolitan instead.",

    "text": "My new Favorite Pizza place in Las Vegas! When we moved to Vegas over a year ago, several people told us about how good Evel Pie was. We finally made it Downtown to check it out and now we wish we would have come sooner.  The crust was perfectly cooked. The sauce was loaded with fresh crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of cheese were oozing with deliciousness, and, the sausage and pepperoni was applied in abundance. The Goblin Sausage Pie is our favorite followed closely by The Barry White Pie. Enjoy!",

    "text": "When it's 1am and you're wrapping up your downtown Las Vegas bar crawl, your tolerance for dropping $5.50 on a slice of pizza just might grow exponentially.  Such was the case when my friend and I found ourselves at Evel Pie after he surrendered to his pizza craving. It looked crowded earlier, but we seemed to hit a temporary dip in the crowd and didn't have to wait too long in line to order. Our slices came out pretty quickly afterward, presumably after they'd been run through the oven quickly to restore them to a high temperature point.  Although my friend was content to go with the $6 deal (cheese slice + house beer, which is the light and bland Evel Ale), I did grab some specialty slices for $5.50. I recalled seeing the Snake River pizza on TV when Evel Pie was featured on an episode of Food Paradise, so I went for it. Frankly, the rattlesnake sausage tasted much like regular pork sausage. The slice was otherwise quite sparsely adorned, so I'm disappointed that I surrendered to that impulse.  I much preferred my second slice, the Balls to the Wall. Massive dollops of ricotta and reasonable amounts of meatball made every bite a treat. I didn't even have to add parmesan or red pepper flakes to this one. The thin crust was otherwise similar to the other piece, substantial and chewy and neither soggy or crunchy.  I don't think I'll flock downtown for Evel Pie, but they're a fine choice for a late night snack if you're walking around Fremont Street.",

According to whoever responded to my first review, if that happens, don't assume that they suck and they're overrated like I did, bring it to their attention and they might try to make it right. That's not what happened on my second trip.   Group of people I was hanging out with wanted to refuel downtown, and they picked this spot and I thought, \"Why not?\" I figured the food traffic would mean fresher slices that don't need as much reheating. I don't know if the foot traffic thing has anything to do with it, but the pizza was good.   It's pricey if you're just here for a slice of pizza, but, if you like beer, you can get a slice and a beer for $6 (according to a sign I saw), and I'm sure ordering a whole pie rather than a slice works out better for your wallet as well. I won't specifically come downtown to eat it, but, if you're nearby and in the mood for pizza, there's a good chance you'll understand why the reviews are so glowing.",

The $6 slice and beer is a great deal but even if you get a slice of the ready made specialties or order a whole pie of whatever..you cannot go wrong. Even better, they have live music and events on the back patio and it's a great vibe. Thanks Evel Pie",

My only complaint is that the beers were a bit overpriced. Paying eight dollars for a small draft beer seems a little steep, but that is to be expected given the area and that it is Las Vegas. Pizza slices started at $5.50 which is high too. The bartender was super friendly and accommodating, and a lot of the sample a few beers before actually selecting the one we wanted to drink. I think what I like most about this place is that is just such a funky establishment was so many different things all over the place to look at and that is right up my alley.",

Also, you can't get the happy hour special on the veggie pizza, nor the $6 for a slice and a PBR, that one should at least be good for the veggie w no cheese option. So yeah, this place is almost perfect but $10 for a veggie slice w no cheese and a PBR is a little steep.  The pizza sauce is dope.",

Prices are a normal for by the slice but normal for by the slice is kinda high. For a dollar or two more than you pay by the slice you can get a large Brooklyn style 3-topping pizza at Dominos or something. Plus for some reason everyone they ever have at the register seems to be too busy to take your order unless it's Friday or Saturday night.  Come here if you're out on Fremont at night on the weekend, otherwise you're gonna pay $17 for two pieces of pizza and a bud light and feel kinda jipped. But for the times they are running that special and have the staff around because they know they'll be busy, it's a good place to grab a piece of pizza and a beer.",

My wife and I ate out of the bowl while we wondered who the extra fork was for. When I ordered a beer for my wife, they came back with a pitcher and then gave me attitude about it when I pointed out their mistake. They never fixed it and I ended up paying for that pitcher of beer. When I called the manager, he told me to call my bank and he couldn't have cared less about it.
