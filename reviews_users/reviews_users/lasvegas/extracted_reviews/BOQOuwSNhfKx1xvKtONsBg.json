Came for a salad, pizza and a beer. $9.00 for a glass of beer?!? Look, we can well afford a 9.00 beer IF we thought it was worth it. That's just WRONG! Maybe that's why the place was empty. It's in a little strip mall on Sahara not in the tourist area on the strip! We walked out. I'm not paying that much for one stinking glass of beer. I wouldn't be surprised to see this place close too.",

    "text": "I tried Settebello for the first time last night.  I had read the reviews of my Yelp friends and likes the sound of the Rafael pizza which was on their special of the day and it sounded good.    When I talked to the young man at the podium and told him I wanted to place a To Go order, I told him about the pizza and the reviews.  He told me he'd check and a short time later, he came back and told me they could make it but they didn't have the caramelized onions for it.  I told him to order it anyway.  In just a few short minutes, the pizza was brought to me as I waited in their small waiting area.  I brought it home and it was very good.  It was also the perfect size for two people.  My preference is still for thick crust, Sicilian style pizza, but I can see that Settebello will be on my rotation list.  And, I want to try some of the others as well.  Good service and good pizza!",

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you don't like Napoletana style pizza that is typically eaten with a knife and fork because it is chewy/wet/runny/soggy in the center then don't eat here. It's not their fault if they serve their product correctly.   Settebello uses fresh, high-quality ingredients...they cook their pizza in wood burning ovens...they have an approachable wine list with lovely options...they have great salads and desserts to start and finish your meal with! Include a clean, welcoming environment, and Settabello is an easy \"Good as it Gets\" 5 Stars!  My favorite pizzas are the following: Margherita DOC Diavola Pizza Carbonara Settebello Bianca  I belong to runny egg yolks anonymous due to my addiction/infatuation for the golden spheres of flamboyant goodness that are egg yolks. Settebello does their Pizza Carbonara with a runny yoked egg on top. What's more? You can ask to have a runny egg atop any of their pizzas. I suggest experiencing the Diavola this way...you could also do the Settebello or Bianca this way, but even an addict such as me would leave the Margherita & M. DOC alone.  Settebello is easily my vote for best Napoletana pizza in Vegas, but they might be my favorite pizza in Vegas of any style.",

Today we asked the waitress to get our pizza cooked enough and again we got our pizza soggy.    When we returned the pizza to the kitchen to get it cooked longer our waitress said they would throw away this particular pizza and make a new one so it would take longer.  3 minutes later we got our pizza back (we are pretty sure it was the same one that we returned to the kitchen since we made several cuts in it before and the cuts were there when we got it back) and again it was a little bit more cooked on the outside, but inside it was still undercooked.   Coupled with our waitress attitude (I do not know why she had to come up with the story that she threw our first pizza in the trash and the second one was freshly cooked when we did not even ask for it) and same soggy pizza, we are not coming back.  In general we had a good service before.  Today it was different.   We never saw this place full, we figured there must be a reason.    We put 2 stars for the ambiance and the topping on the pizza. But they need to figure out how to cook the pizza.",

The decor is very much my style. Loved everything about how this place looks and feels.   The food is ok. When I walk into a place this pretty I guess I expect more. The misto was ok, doughy focaccia, mild cheeses were ok along with selection of meats. Was looking for bolder Italian flavors. We decided on the margherita pizza because it's my favorite type. It was very doughy. The flavors were fresh and good but I'm looking for more of a crispier & thinner dough. It wasn't bad but didn't live up to my dreams of finding the perfect margherita pizza like the one I had in Italy. Prices are average. Service was great, no complaints there.

We got the pizza of the week with pesto sauce & tomato w/ garlic which I thought was hands down AWSOME!  Bianca was another one we got with the balsamic reduction!  We got one other pizza but i forgot the name.. The dough was chewy and crispy! So good & you could just tell the cheese was fresh! Definately will be back to try the dining experience more & the pizza would probably taste so much better when it is Hot!",

The variety is the key because you can just keep coming back and experimenting with all the unique combinations. Personally I like the jalapeno and the margarita. Don't forget to save some room for the tiramisu. This is a great spot for a date, group of friends or the whole family. I felt like I was at home as soon as I walked in and was greeted promptly. The place is upscale quality with reasonable pricing which always makes me happy. Also the portions were hearty and not skimpy and you can tell that the meat was fresh and well prepped and not just thrown on at the last minuet like most pizzerias are doing these days...  Overall I just had to give a five because the place is so well rounded and after multiple visits the consistency in quality really won me over.",

    "text": "Nothing to Write Home To Mama About  Please take this with a grain of salt as this is our first visit.  Based on the interior of the restaurant, we had high hopes for our first binge meal after five weeks of almost no-carb fasting. The chairs and tables are warm dark wood and leather, as are the booths. Nice high ceilings and a beautiful large bar area, segmented off from the main restaurant.  That's where the niceness ends unfortunately. I'm not sure if this is a family owned business, but the service was neither prompt nor overly friendly. We came in the middle of the afternoon with only two other customers in the place. The host seemed like he was just wandering aimlessly around the dining area and just happened to see us. The booths are not exactly comfortable, as I think the backs are a bit too tight and push you forward to the table.  Quick summation of the meal:  Arugula salad (Panzanella): probably the best thing we had. Homemade croutons and little dried pieces of proscuttio topped with large shavings of parmigiano.  Meatball appetizer: five small meatballs in so-so tomato sauce and topped with basil slivers. Meatballs were cold (as in freezer cold) in the middle and not especially tasty. You can see that the cheese on top is not even slightly melted, which is rather indicative of the overall temperature of the dish.  Salsiccia e Friarielli (sausage and broccoli) pizza. Sausage was not bad at all, but appeared to be tossed on the pizza in very uneven clumps. The dough was also not bad, but the chef definitely needs more experience with his or her oven. Burnt on the outside, raw on the inside. This can happen now and then with a good hot pizza oven, but added to everything else it just added insult to injury.  So, salad, pizza, appetizer. $50.00 for lunch. Not a great first experience in the Village Square on Sahara. We might visit Settebello Pizzeria Napoletana sometime in the future, but it might take a few months to get the bad taste out of my mouth.",

Trish the manager should have corrected him on the spot, she was too busy sitting down socializing at a nearby friend. I guess business is good enough here that anything goes in this place.

    "text": "Sad to give this 1 star review. I have dined at the Henderson location and loved it. I do live right behind the summerlin location so I thought ordering 2 pies to go was a great idea. Wrong! Crust was burnt and the center of the pie was super greasy and full of water? I returned the pies and watched the cook remake the pizzas his expression on his face was not pleased to make the pies again. Not only because I have been a chef in Las Vegas for 20 years but I could feel the heat blasting all the way by the counter. They need to learn how to control there fire. Burnt is not cooked!!!!! I expressed my concern that the thermostat on the pizza oven was passed 900 degrees and he said well the thermostat had been broken for years. Right then I knew my pizzas would come out the same they did the first time. At this point I was beyond younger and I just wanted to eat. I just felt cheated that they knew the oven was way to hit to cook the pies properly and just giving me a card for a \"free\" pizza was going to see me off to enjoy my burnt undercooked pizzas. Thank you settebello",

    "text": "I'd never been before but a friend constantly raves about the place so when visiting this time, we made this the final gathering place for the trip. The staff was very friendly and helpful and saw to it that we got a great seat for our party of 10.  First stop? The bar while waiting for the rest to arrive. The wine list is somewhat limited with only a few whites by the glass. Fortunately my favorite white was on the list. Pinot Grigio. It was nice and dry, not sweet, with a fruity linger. Very good stuff.  The server in the bar was friendly and when he asked us if we wanted \"water\" I knew immediately he wasn't from Las Vegas. I pegged him from New York. Brooklyn even. He told us he was from Brooklyn so I asked him to say water again just so I could hear it. Where I come from when you say water, you're speaking a different language.  As our party arrived and we moved into the main dining area, we were promptly seated without a reservation. They were very accommodating and friendly. Service was impeccable and she provided a nice flow to the whole situation. If I could give just the server a star rating, it would be 5, no doubt.  I started off with another glass of Pinot to go along with my salad. We shared a beet salad and the Insalata Grande, which in my opinion was the better of the two. This might have been one of the best salads I've ever had: Mixed Greens, Fresh Tomatoes, Artichoke Hearts, Roasted Mushrooms, Olives, Pine Nuts, Cracked Pepper, Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano, Balsamic Vinaigrette.  Pizza? Yes Pizza. On rare occasions I'm willing to violate my glutard status. We didn't know until after arriving that you have to ask for gluten-free a day in advance because that's what they need to prepare it. I think they're pickier than I. At any rate, we had the  Margherita DOC: Crushed Tomatoes, Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, Parmigiano Reggiano, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. I think in order to truly enjoy this pizza you have to be a fan of the crust. This stuff was ultra thin and a bit chewy. I'm not saying I didn't like it, I'm just saying you would have to be a fan to truly enjoy it. It's not something you can pick up and bite but something you have to eat with a fork. For a lot of pizza aficionados, that's practically sacrilege.   In the end and for me: The dining experience gets 5 stars, the service 5, and the pizza 4. Sooo, I'm going to give it 4 stars because you just have to go and check it out for yourself. Is it yea or nay on the pizza? That's what Settebello is all about, the pizza. I will say here though, that the VPN (Vera Pizza Napoletana) certification is impressive. The requirements are as follows: The VPN charter requires that members use only specific raw ingredients to create the pizza dough, that the dough be worked with the hands, never using a rolling pin and that it be cooked directly on the surface of a bell shaped pizza oven that is fueled solely by wood. The charter also requires specific types of tomatoes be used and only the use of fresh milk or buffalo milk mozzarella is acceptable. Settebello is one of only 5 pizza establishments in the country to be certified by the Napolitana pizza police from Italy. I guess that says a lot.",

I really liked the atmosphere and their huge wooden tables. The lighting felt perfect for the dinner setting and it was not too dark or too bright.

    "text": "So the food was great, and the bartenders were so welcoming! However, not a single person in this valley, in the middle of summer, wants to sit in a swamp cooler. It was at least 85 degrees in here, causing us to end our experience before the next round of entrees and drinks.  I get it, pizza ovens hit above 110, but accommodate that setting. Allegedly, the staff has no control of the air. As we sat, the temperature raised a few degrees more. Your employees shut down when this hot, and customers want to run. If everyone else figures it out, and keeps it semi-cool, so can you!",

Pizza Diavola (crushed tomatoes, red bell peppers, spicy salami, garlic, mozzarella, basil and olives) - 3 stars.   Pizza Vico (sausage, roasted fennel, mozzarella, basil, olives, red onions) - 3 stars.   Crostini con crudo (Prosciutto crudo and shaved parmesan) - 2 stars.   Crostata ricotta with nutella- 2 stars.   I'm generally a fan of a crisp crust, including the bottom having a slight crisp. The pizza was soggy, a bit too soft for my taste, and basically falling apart as soon as it was picked up. I think this could be a matter of preference, but I thought everything we had was OK.",

Happy Hour is good for trying a few menu items, while Mondays are fantastic for $5 margarita pizzas.  In all, the food is high quality and the restaurant is quaint and casual with a seating area for a date night as well as a bar and TV area.  Easy parking and overall good scene make Settebello a nice option for pizza n the area",

We asked if we could put our own toppings on a pizza and that seems to have annoyed her. So far less than impressed with service. Let's talk about the food: salad tasted super fishy oddly enough ( perhaps anchovy juice got in but it wasn't a Cesar salad) Croutons were super soggy (all of them). Pizza was subpar and didn't have the one addition I requested. Let's not forget the dirty plate the waitress put down, looked at and thought it was ok to leave with us. Additionally we ordered bread for the take in the beginning and once all the food was delivered we reminded her again. I normally don't post negative reviews in that we all have bad days however this was never ending and zero effort was given by the waitress!  Better luck to you all if you try this place out.",

The reason why I would give this place a one star is because of their horrible customer service and our server named Tricia or whatever her name is.. before I explain I would like to point out that this was my first time eating with my parents and my one year old son at this restaurant.  Our waitress/server is extremely unprofessional and rude. My son is one year old and is very playful; and as he plays around and gets excited he tends to move a lot in his high chair. Well while Tricia was taking our order my son accidentally tapped her.. BUT of course she took it as my son hit her (keep in mind he is one, so really how hard can a one year old hit) .. and in her response is \"don't hit me buddy because I will hit you back.\" and in her tone she was not kidding..  I have've let that respond slide; BUT the second time she came around to drop of plates and I believe was our starters, my son again moved and almost touching her and she gave my son and I a really dirty look and gave us a nasty attitude. On top of that she barely checked on our table but she check the table behind us, beside us and in front us constantly but barely paid attention to mine and my parents table..   In conclusion this restaurant has amazing food BUT I would advice not to have Tricia as your server!",

We went on a Tuesday evening.  It was pretty slow when we walked in.  We were greeted promptly.  At first the Host attempted to seat us at a table.  I requested to have a booth and he was very good about letting us move over.  Not a big deal, but you know how sometimes you get the \"eye roll\" followed by a sigh.  So, that was nice. However, after we were handed off to our server the difference between this location & Henderson became glaring.  The service simply isn't in the same league as the what the Henderson staff puts out.  Ordered the Beet Salad & was brought an Insalata Grande instead.  This is a good salad too, so I didn't make a deal about it.  Which would have been hard, since our server ghosted after she dropped it off.  Our server was ok, but just not very attentive.  The pizza was on par with Henderson.  I got my favorite pie, the Margherita DOC.  So freaking good.  Although, it took quite a bit longer to come out, than the Henderson location.  This location does have more seating than Henderson.  So, that's cool, I guess.",

Some other pizzerias just add too many spices in the sauce and I don't like it.  But why, or why? Why do you burn the crust like that. Please, don't tell me that's how oven baked or wood fired pizza should be. I've tried them all and the crust should NOT be so burned. Check out my photos. It was so bad, my kids did not want to eat the pizza, in the end they ate only the mid secrion of it.   The pizza is very thin. The sauce and cheese are light. Toppings tasted good. These are all food things. That's why I give it 2 stars.  Other bad things - other parts of the pizza were slightly burned as well and the toppings were unevenly spread.  Please, fix your ovens or replace them.",

My boyfriend loves the arancini as well.   This location is quite larger than its Henderson counterpart, and the furniture and tables (including lighting and bar) are equal parts rustic and gorgeous.  The only drawback to this location (as opposed to one in Henderson) is that they don't serve gelato.

The pizza reminds me of stopping at that random family-owned restaurant along the streets of Florence or Rome.

(Best old-fashioned in Vegas, tied with Herbs and Rye) And their Happy Hour tops the whole thing off.

However the place looks like a really cool spot to be in once the sun goes down and more people start to come through.  The decor is very rustic which is nice and you can see the huge pizza over in the back of the restaurant.  FOOD:  The pizzas here are meant to be eaten individually (no large pizzas to be shared) and I'm not so sure if I'm a fan of this style.  I enjoy having a huge pizza in front of everyone and everyone getting a slice.  Regardless, these are Neapolitan style pizzas which have a much chewier center while the outsides are crisp.  It had a little too much chew for my liking, but what made the pizza great was the freshness of the ingredients.  I had the Capricciosa pizza and it was a great choice overall.    SERVICE:  Our server was nice enough to explain how Neapolitan pizza differs from other types and did a good job in explaining their options on the menu.  It was a well run service, nothing truly remarkable but certainly beats many other restaurants I've been to where the service truly lacked.",

It is much larger than the Henderson location. There's also a lot more open space rather than sectioned off areas, which I personally like just because I enjoy watching the guys working with the wood fired oven.   Neapolitan pizzas should have a thin crispy crust that is chewy and moist at the same time. The crust should be so thin that it is hard or impossible to eat without utensils. Settebello pizzas are just that...always messy but absolutely worth it. My favorite pie still remains to be the Vico. Thank you Settebello for the consistent deliciousness and awesome service.

    "text": "When someone who doesn't really like pizza LOVES this pizza joint, you know it's gotta be something special.  Been here with friends several times now and the pizzas have always been consistently delicious.  The wait can be a little slow but every pizza I've had has hit the spot.  Standouts for me have included Margherita DOC, a pizza that's not listed online but contains pear, and a brisket pizza. Best part is to ask for the olive oil and their spicy oil to mop all the crust up with.  And then dessert pizza.  Imagine dessert pizza with cinnamon and marscapone and honey.  I don't think I need to say more. :) This is definitely one of the places I have on my recommendation list for any friends who come to town.",

She had never been to Settebello and I had always told her how good the pizza was.   It didn't seem too crowded and we were greeted by the same server named Adam, I believe. He is always very friendly and even acknowledged that I was there with my wife and not my coworkers. It's very nice to feel remembered.   I always get the margarita pizza, but my wife insisted we get a salad, too. She choose the insalada grande. I'm not much of a salad person, but it was very good. The food here is just so fresh tasting. Every time I have eaten here I can taste how fresh my pizza is, and in this case the salad, too.   When we had finished Adam suggested dessert. I had never had any here and my wife loves chocolate, so Adam suggested the zeppoles. Simply amazing.   I really wanted to write this review because I was nervous of disappointing my wife about the lunch place I had talked up so much. But, like always amazing food and spot on service.",

If people are complaining, they are not used to the real thing and need a trip to Italy to explore another part of the world. This restaurant is certified as well.   The ambiance was lovely, modern with a warm, comfortable twist. Though the layout is quite open, it was still quiet enough to hear the person seated across from you. This restaurant could easily accommodate a group of 8 -10 for lunch/dinner. My friend dined here for a late lunch the week before, and he said their Happy Hour prices and specials were surprisingly decent. I will give it a try in the next few weeks.   The server was amazing - attentive, knowledgeable,  friendly, and inviting. As many of us know, great servers are a rare breed now-a-days in LV as most act like they are doing their guests a favor in the land of Make a Living Off Your Tips. This was also nice to find at a new, trendy, hotspot in Vegas. (Server was Josh - he remembered my guy friend's name and is unfortunately going to the Henderson location permanently).   The timing of the food was perfect, the quality was great, and the price was reasonable. Everything I tasted was delicious - not too much, not bland, and authentic.",

Featuring all the standards of a certified parlor, inclusive of a hand pressed di Sorrento brick oven, all wood firing, and imported flour worked by hand it was perhaps with a bit of gluttony that a the decision was made to sample four of the restaurant's four signature pies plus the weekly special but in the end each and every one was an individually shaped, lightly charred, bubbly and balanced success.  Truly a space where the concept of quality ingredients and time honored techniques yield a superior product it was with two golden, creamy arancini that the meal began and then progressing through pizza both red and white, simple and complex it was perhaps most telling that the best slices of the day belonged to the Margherita DOC with a the Buffala Mozz briny funk finding harmony in the hand crushed tomatoes yet not to be outdone the eponymous Settebello also shined as the novel pine nuts and mushrooms added an earthen undertone to the pairing of cured meats.  Truly a place where not a single savory was anything less than excellent it was without hesitation that desserts were selected and again choosing broadly the rewards were myriad; a creamy budino on par with DOCG's for best in town a clear favorite amongst many while the Bella Mela proved just as well conceptualized as the pizzas though ever more subtle - a characteristic ignored by both the Calzone and Zeppole; the first harkening a campfire's smoke and the second soft and supple but both filled to bursting chocolate decadence and all the better for it.",

The prosciutto is better than any deli I've been to or maybe it's what that 900 degree wood fire oven does to it but it's lovely on my tongue. They don't have pepperoni, what you say, a pizza joint that doesn't have pepperoni is 5 stars? Yes they have a spicy salami and after,  you'll wish your pizzeria did too! So yes the food is fantastic, but without the service no matter how good it was you wouldn't come  back. They always greet you with a smile, make sure your cup no matter what it is, is always full.",

We got lucky tonight and found parking right away. It took a few minutes before someone realized we were standing there. Once she greeted us it took at the most about 5 minutes before we were seated. Not long at all. We ordered a mixed green salad and margeretta pizza with no basil. I didn't read the part on the menu that said the salad would only be drizzled with oil. My bad. Had I seen it I would of asked for vinegar. The salad was good. The pizza was on a super thin crust which is what I like. A little crunchy. Fresh tomato sauce. Portion wise wasn't too bad either. We were able to split the pizza and salad between two people and walk out full.",

We love their thin crust and fresh ingredients. Ask for their spicy oil to really bring out the taste.",

It has a very relaxing and laid back atmosphere, which you notice right when you walk in. The pizza is a traditional Neapolitan style. They have a good variety of pizzas, and have a special pizza of the week. (Which hasn't let me down yet!)   There is a very nice bar with a great selection of beers and cocktails. Not to big, but perfect size for a small group to unwind after work. Plus, two happy hours: 3:00p-6:00p and 8:30-to close, Mon-Fri.   So if you're looking for a great pizza, friendly staff and a place to relax at an affordable price, try Settebello.",

When I drew it to his attention that he shorted us .60cents, his reply was:\"We don't do change!\" REALLY??? What does that mean? That you get to keep \"MY\" money??! Great racket you got going on buddy! .60 cents from every table turns into dollars of others money in your pockets! We own a restaurant too...if you were my employee I would fire you on the spot!

    "text": "Finally got around to trying this place last night. I think we've been holding off because we thought it was going to be expensive, but it really isn't. 2 salads, a pizza and a cocktail came to roughly $40.   The food is excellent and the pizza is very different than we're used to but very fresh and delicious (and the sauce is amazing!). The crust is really thin, airy and light, but not hard, crunchy or crispy like you might expect a thin crust to be.  We had the Diavola pizza which had crushed tomatoes, garlic, basil, bell peppers, peppered salami, crushed red peppers, etc. So incredibly flavorful and delicious. What's really amazing is that you taste every single topping. It's like hearing an orchestra where you can isolate and identify every single instrument yet still appreciate the cohesive whole that they become.   We also had the warm beets (served simmering in a cast iron pot smothered in garlic, oil and Marcona almonds) and the Insalata, both of which were delicious.   For the drink we shared the Triple B. Bourbon, Balsamic Reduction, muddled strawberries, lemon juice, and a few other ingredients that I can't quite recall. My wife said it reminded her of a scented candle... Not sure I agree but we both thought it was great!   The atmosphere is also nice. Comfortable, cozy, warm and inviting with a nice energy. This is definitely a place that we'll come back to.  UPDATE: We've been back 3 more times now and we've never gotten the same dish twice, we always try something new. We have yet to be disappointed! Everything we've had has been delicious. We've also taken friends and family for the first time who promptly went back again to try other items.",

Every time I eat there I think of the movie Eat, Pray, Love when she can't stop eating the Pizza in Napoli because is just so good.  The atmosphere is comfortable - great for a date night or a night out with the family. Love this place. Its one of my favs!",

Their salads taste like a pine tree and not in a good way.  3. The service was really slow. We finally got out of there after 2 1/2 hours. We went on a weekend night and there were only a few other people dining, but we were not attended to very well. There were multiple waiters but refills were neglected.  4. The pizza just wasn't that great. Project pie, Grimaldis, biaggios, and other pizza places in Vegas are a lot better.  5. The waiter had a difficult time splitting the checks.  6. We both got sick from what we ate and had stomach issues all night. TMI We will not be going back. But in all fairness, if you still want to try it, at least they have coke products and their bathrooms are nice.",

They are certainly big enough to split, as one would make an entire meal for most people.  After that we always split a pizza.  My favorite one so far is the Settebello pizza.  It has pancetta, sausage and mushrooms, and it really is tasty.  The diavola pizza was really good too.      The drinks here are good too.  While the cocktails are good I think they have great sangria.  The service is always friendly, and I have never had trouble getting a table.  I will definitely be back.",

I have been looking for a spot, where I can have an authentic Napoletana pizza and this place came really close. Although, the middle part of the pizza was a little soft and soggy and the crust was slightly burnt, which added a bitter taste to the pizza. I can overlook those tiny flaws.   However, I cannot overlook the non-attentive or shall I say non-existent server. We're not in Italia so I didn't expect the customer service to be lacking. Once the server got our order, we never saw the server again. We needed extra napkins and more water, but there was no sign of the server anywhere. There was a few people on the other side of the room that looked like they work there, but it was a bit awkward to flag them down since they were preoccupied with their conversations. There were only two other tables with customers along with ours and we were all pretty much ignored. The server came back when we were done with our food and at that point, we got the bill.  I don't think I'll be coming back here when I'm in Vegas?! It's such a shame since the pizza was so good.",

    "text": "I spy a big pizza pie in your eye!!! (pointing finger)... There being several choices of eateries within Village Square, we happened upon Settebello with front door parking.  It must've been a silent invite.  Good to see it's not crazy busy.  We were seated within a minute of walking in.  Quickly, snapped a photo of the funny happy hour chalkboard.  Got seated at a booth and flip page menus were left on the table to view.  So glad it wasn't confusing.  But with all the flavors and ingredients, it took a moment to decide.  Let's just start with ice waters and a pitcher of white sangria.  Perfect pick on the white sangria to bring out our cheerful sides hahaaa.  Wine glasses are $5 during happy hour which is 'til 9pm on Thursdays.  Now we know to order by glass instead of pitcher for happy hour.  We tempted our taste buds with artichoke crostini; followed with Settebello pizza.  It was described with Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  OMG that was great!  It wasn't so much the thin crust cuz it was soft; usually not my preference.  But if anything has flavor scores, for me I just be quiet and GRUB.  I had no expectations trying this place out, and the food has me starry eyed.  Okay maybe the sangria was a booster.  Interior is beautifully designed.  I love the reused wood tables, and the mix of metals and stones.  It's modern but they use a brick oven for their pizzas and you can actually watch them being made.  There's bar stool seating around it for closer observation.  Need to give Matt, our server, applauded acknowledgment for his polite attentive customer service too.    They have a separate bar area where sports fanatics can watch and consume.  The environment overall felt comfortable to chill and relax with the warm colors of the furniture and fixtures.  At the same time Ness and I felt like we were in the spotlight, on our stage.  We were only having a catch up conversation.  Recommending Settebello for any reason cuz the food is really flavorful!  Will return to try other pizzas.  Also, cuz their white sangria causes laughter spurts.  And we love to laugh :D",

    "text": "I wasn't a pizza lover until I met Settebello.  Anyone who knows me knows that pizza is never my go-to option. I am very picky with pizza and having just moved from New York City, I've also had my fair share of pizza tastings but who knew Napoletana was going to be my style?  The first time I was here, I feel in love.   I immediately came back the next week and brought two friends with me, one who is a pizza lover and will eat any kind of pizza you put in front of him.   What I love about Settebello is that this style of pizza features a super thin crust that is loaded with fresh and abundant toppings that is baked fresh in a wood-burning oven.    This is definitely True Italian style pizza, not American style or Chicago style or NY Style. If you're expecting this then don't don't come here.   The dough is soft and only takes a minute to cook in their wood-burning oven. I found the pizza to be soft and foldable yet at times it would have been easier to eat this with a knife and fork, which by New York standards Is a massive NO-NO. Yet in Italy, this is how they would eat it.   The blackened char spots on the pizza crust is a tell-tale sign of Pizza Napoletana that has been cooked in a blistering hot, wood burning oven so don't fret if you see some burnt crust. It's not the end of the world.   I'd recommend the DIAVOLA for spicy lovers (Crushed Tomatoes, Finnochiona (Peppered Salame), Roasted Red Bell Peppers, Crushed Red Peppers, Garlic, Mozzarella, Extra Virgin Olive Oil)  and the SETTEBELLO (Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil)  Ciao!",

But pizza came to the U.S. via Naples.  Settebello's explanation of why their pizza is small, soggy, and salty doesn't add up.  We got there just before the late HH was about to end, so we ordered a wine and beer.  Six bucks for a draft beer pint is not my idea of happy hour pricing, unless maybe you're on the Strip.  But we weren't.  The small HH menu listed individual pizzette for $5 each.  We asked our waiter if we'd get more if we ordered the regular pizza off the regular menu.  \"Definitely,\" he said.  So we did, assuming that it would be a normal pizza and we'd have leftovers.  I love leftovers.  Until we were presented with what usually passes for happy hour-sized pizza at other places.  And then watched as a man dining near us got his individual pizza, and realized we'd been had.  Two of those would have given us as much, or more than the one we got.  The waiter's response was that he guessed he'd made a bad call.  Yeah, real bad. I can't even remember the last time we didn't tip a waiter.  And that was before we each took a tiny slice of the drooping, sloppy \"big\" pie.  Salty.  Flavorless.  Four bites and it was gone.  The manager admitted that the Neapolitan style wasn't to everyone's taste, and offered to get us something else.  We declined, and simply finished our drinks and went down the street to Khoury's.  Now that was worth the four stars I'll be giving it. And next time we want pizza, we won't be going back to Settebello.  So utterly disappointing.",

The food is fine, but there has been, without fail, a problem with our order every single time we visit (item not brought out, not made according to specifications, wrong item, extra item).   For whatever reason, the servers all seem to be incredibly apathetic - - almost to the point where it seems a little rude. Every time I've brought up the issue with the unfulfilled order, I feel as though I'm burdening the waiter, which shouldn't be the case. It's fine though - - I guess it's better to dine at a restaurant where our business is appreciated.",

The crispy pancetta on the top was a nice touch; however the toast points were lacking in flavor and texture, and possibly freshness. I would have appreciated it more if it were served with fresh, toasted (possibly in their Italian oven?!) bread rubbed with garlic or olive oil.  The pizza was dynamite and could not be improved upon. I had a margherita, and my husband had a Diavolo. My son ordered a smaller cheese children's pizza - nice to have a kid option.  Service was good. Decorated nicely. Next time I'll take care to wear something better than shorts and flip flops.",

Not many people there yet we waited to be seated and served and then for the bill and such.  One really bad note for the manager. When the waitress was bringing the food out she stopped the waitress and grabbed the plate then took it in the back. Then it was delivered. Well of course we asked why. Our waitress explained that it  was because there was too much salad for the side salad.  What could a pinch of extra greens in the salad cost??? A nickel???  My food gets yanked out of the servers hands right in front of us and stalked back into the kitchen for a nickel.   Well that nickels worth of greens left a bad taste in my mouth and lowered the rating.",

However, overall it was good, not great. The crust was a little bit softer than I would like and it seemed like it lacked seasoning. Would I come back? probably would but I would try to go to other pizzerias I've had around the area.",

My group didn't want to wait much longer. The hostess looked up my name and said two tables in front of us. 25 more minutes go by and I see three more groups seated.  Go check to see why we were skipped and then told there are FIVE more in front of you.  I explained what the other hostess told me.  No apology. Just a shoulder shrug. So the originally quoted 30 minute wait, would've been at least an hour and a half if we kept waiting.  I gave up just after an hour. Had I been told the truth of 8(!) more tables in front of us I would've only wasted half the time.  Either the hostesses intentionally lie or they can't count or estimate.",

I don't want to accuse without proof but I could swear she seemed a bit turned off that she had to serve latinos. Never came once to assist us after we got our pizza, and saw her plenty around her other tables. :(. Basically never offered water, never offered the kids crayons or anything, I asked what kind of beverages she had for my son and she gave major attitude like I was an idiot for even asking. Oh, and I waited 25 minutes for her to finally see us and by the time I got the chili oil we had finished our pizza. This other waiter that came serve us our pizza , was much more genuine and friendly. The skinnier waiter with her hair slicked back in a ponytail ruined our experience...we will be driving all the way to henderson to be in better company with PATRICK. such an asset to the Settebello team in fact if I could replicate him in every single dining experience I would. He will always get a big tip from me. . He is amazing. MY experience went from 5 stars in henderson to 2 stars because of a waiter :((((",

Clearly the girl during the day that was working  should take a pen and paper to the table for orders. The place was dirty and should be closed down for horrible food and service!!!

    "text": "Where do I begin? Well how bout I start with I got what I expected. Meaning after reading numerous Yelp reviews about how the pizza is either a hit or a miss because of the wet or uncooked pizza dough. I could see why some people wouldn't care for it. For me I knew it was going to be like that so I guess I wasn't as disappoint as oppose to someone who wasn't expecting soggy center.   I came right when they open first customer of the day. The restaurant itself is super cool, very rustic and stylish. Classy with lots and lots of space. The bar to the left is a great size with flat screen TVs. The kitchen is sort of open with an awesome oven for pizza prepping. I also notice a nice size private dinning room which can be closed off to the rest of the Resturant.   We were greeted nicely and seated promptly. I started off with the Insalata Grande which was dresses lightly but perfectly with a balsamic vinaigrette. The fresh mixed greens with baby arugula was simply topped with their amazing roasted or more like sauteed mushrooms, delicious salty olives, tomatoes, shaved parmigiana and the best chunks of juicy tender artichoke hearts. But the best part of it was the pine nuts. It gave the salad the crunch it needed.   Wife and I shared the Signature Settebello pizza. Waitress kindly described their pizza as being thin crust with chard crust and \"chewy\" dough meaning it's completely wet in the middle where you can't even pick it up even if you had skills. The pizza came out pretty quick and had lots of flavor the sausage was amazing the chard crust was something I really dig but yes the center was  soggy. There has to be a way for them to make their yummy pizza with a more cooked and not so wet center. You almost have to use a fork to eat it properly without a fork just forget about trying to pick it up.   Other then that I really did like what I had, priced fairly but I wasn't blown away to where I will come running back. Very nice Resturant and will return just not any time soon.",

    "text": "Settebello's is a pizza place that offers you the thin crust wood fired pizza. The pizzas are about 12\" and are usually more than enough for one person. There are about 8 different pizzas on the menu that are about $13 each. You can add items to the pizza, but you could end up paying quite a bit for a 12\" pizza, depending on what you add of course. Extra items start at $1 and then go up from there. The menu also consists of salads and appetizers to go along with the pizzas. They have a comfortable dining area with bench style seats, chairs, and booths that are set around wood tables. It is a Rustic decor that goes along with the menu.  We ordered a couple of salads. The Romana Salad and the Beet Salad. Both salads were okay. The arugula was fresh. The beet salad had red and yellow beets. They beets tasted like they were from a can. There was very little cheese on both salads.  We ordered three pizzas and added some items on each pizza. I know now that this type of pizza is known for being a bit soggy towards the middle of the dough after reading about it. I'm not a fan of soggy pizza.  Quattro Formaggi Pizza. I added mushrooms and calamata olives. The pizza was cooked nice and crisp, but the middle was soggy and I could not pick up the slice with out everything falling off.  Marinara Pizza. I added mushrooms, peppers, and onions. This pizza was cooked slightly less than the Quattro and was also soggy in the middle.  Margherita Pizza. I added olives, mushrooms, and artichoke. This pizza dough was under cooked and not at all crispy.  The cooking of the pizzas were very inconsistent. We had three pizzas for one table that were all cooked for different amounts of time, unless their oven was not distributing the heat properly.  The service was excellent. The waitress was very nice. I'm going to cut the pizza maker some slack this time. Their air conditioner was broken and he was cooking by a 900 degree oven. He looked very unhappy, which is quite understandable. So I'll go back again and try the pizzas when it is not a sauna in there.  The bill was $71 for 3 pizzas, 2 salads, and 3 beverages. A bit pricy for what I received. I will give them another try though, because the pizzas would be pretty good if they would have been cooked a bit longer. ******************************************************** Okay. Here is the update. I went back today to give them another try and got a couple pizzas to-go.  Much better. The pizzas were cooked perfect and they were not soggy at all. I figured they were having a problem the first time I was there because their power kept going out.  So, I would definitely recommend this place if you enjoy wood fired pizza.",

The arancini was awesome and crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. Then the marvel called Neapolitan Pizza arrived.

    "text": "This is really REALLY good pizza!  It is different in that it is more European and rustic than the typical American sliced pizza.  The crust is different too.  It is really fluffy in the edges and the inside is really thin.  This makes eating it a little messy but totally worth it.  Their pizza is traditionally served unsliced and you eat it by tearing off little bits.  Good fun if you are having your own pizza.  If you are sharing or don't want to be a mess they will slice them up for you!  Here are some of the pizzas that I have tried so far: 1) Settebello: This is the name of the restaurant, how can you go wrong?  It has crushed tomatoes, pancetta, sausage, mushroom, pine nuts, mozzarella, basil, and olive oil.  It is like an everything pizza.  So good.  If I had to choose one to be my favorite, this would be it. 2) Pizza Carbonara: Crushed tomatoes, pancetta, eggs, mozarella, pepper, olive oil.  The eggs are mixed in with the chesse.  This is another tomato sauce pizza that is really good. 3) Emilia (white pizza): Prosciutto, panna (cream), mozzarella, parmigiono reggiano, basil, olive oil.  Excellent and tasty white pizza.  The creamy consistency is delicious. 4) Vico (white pizza): Sausage, fennel, red onions, mascarpone, mozzarella, basil, olive oil.  The sausage and red onions on this pizza are delicious.  Basically all the pizzas are really good.  The bruschetta is good too but needed a little salt in my opinion.  For dessert the Bella Mella: apple with caramel, vanilla mascarpone, and almonds was the best.  We tried the nutella pizza (so-so) and the nutella filled donuts.  The apple pie was the best by far.  Come here for some great pizza and a food coma shortly to follow.  I fell asleep right after and didn't wake up to brush my teeth or shower until 6am.  It is powerful pizza.",

    "text": "I have been a fan of Settebello for years and was excited that they opened another location closer to my side of town. I had the opportunity to have a meal with some fabulous fellow Yelpers last week and we had a five star meal, as expected. Since we had a larger party, we were able to order and share quite a few different pizzas and desserts.   We started with Arancini for our appetizer, which was good and opted for five different pizzas, the Margherita DOC, Settebello, Carbonara, Diavola and the special of the day which was a white pizza. My favorites were the Margherita, Settebello and Diavola, although all of them were great. The Diavola had a fantastic spiciness that I couldn't get enough of. The Margherita was simple, but perfectly made and showcased the quality ingredients that they use. The Settebello is the restaurant's namesake and has the perfect combination of flavors, and I can never say no to a pine nut. My least favorite was probably the white pizza, since it had quite a few more onions than I would have liked. It was lacking for me, but my tablemates seemed to love it quite a bit They do have weekly specials, so it's a good idea to check them out on Facebook or sign up online for their newsletter for updates.   Luckily, we were able to sample quite a few desserts as well while we were there. The Caramel Budino stole my heart the moment I read the description on the menu and it did not disappoint. This was one of the highlights of our meal for me. Flavorful and a great combination of flavors. The dessert pizza was heaven. Cinnamon, apples, caramel, powdered sugar served on their beautiful pizza dough. This was a great dessert as well. My second favorite of the day. The S'mores Calzone and Zeppoles didn't do much for me. They were good, but too sweet and chocolatey for my taste. That's probably just me, though.   As a fan of Settebello for so long, this meal lived up to all my fond memories of meals with friends at the Settebello in Henderson and makes me wonder why it took me so long between visits.",

    "text": "I had been eagerly awaiting the opening of Settebello in Summerlin for some time now and jumped at the chance to go last Wednesday.  I thought their Henderson location was the best pizza I'd had in LV so that's what I expected.  It wasn't the same but it was still pretty good.  Let's start off with the restaurant itself.  The place is big compared to the original and they did an awesome job with the decor, open kitchen and cool bar area.  I look forward to coming back for happy hour multiple times.  $5 mini pizzas among other food deals from 3pm-6pm ensures that.    So my wife and I split the \"Panzanella\" salad (House Made Croutons, Cherry Tomato, Prosciutto Crisps, Red Onion, Fennel, Cucumber, Basil, Arugula, Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano, Red Wine Vinaigrette) which was good as usual.  I really like the prosciutto crisps since they're basically super bacon bits and could've used more of them but no biggie.     Then the pizzas came out.  My wife got the Margherita DOC which was topped with fresh buffalo mozzarella as opposed to the regular cheese and well worth the $1-$2 upgrade.  I usually get the Settebello pizza (Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil) but chose to get the Pizza Carbonara instead.  I should've stuck with the Settebello.  Why mess with perfection?  Pancetta, egg, mozzarella and crushed tomatoes just sounded so good but it didn't come together as well as I was hoping.  Funnily enough, when the waiter came to ask how everything was and we gave our obligatory \"fine\", he just comes out of nowhere and says \"Yeah.  I am kinda conflicted on the carbonara....\" and just walks away.  Hmmmmm.  Not enough pancetta or sauce and the crust wasn't as well done as I wanted it to be.  But after all, it was still pizza and it was good but not the best.  My wife's margherita was great.    I still have a lot of love for Settebello and look forward to bumping it up to 5 stars.",

If you look at my other reviews you can tell I love pizza.  The search is over. The first bite sent me back memory lane and I thought I was back home for a second. Not to mention there is a pizzeria in my small hometown of Modugno with the same exact name!  The dough, the sauce, the mozzarella, all of it is top notch. Tried the arancini and a salad and they both didn't disappoint.  By the time I was leaving I was already planning my next visit.",

I prefer grimaldi's to this place hands down. This pizza was falling apart and wet. Everything but the crust was swimming in the crushed tomato juice. There isn't really any \"sauce\". It's just crushed tomatoes and all that juice is literally dripping off the pizza. The crust was charred, in a bad way. If I have it my way, I'll never be back.  If my wife has it her way she would come back frequently. To each their own I guess.  Give me classic new york style at grimaldi's, give her this pretentious pizza with Italian names and fancy ingredients.  Besides, $14 for a personal size pizza? Really?",

Not sure whether it's because we got some of the \"cheaper\" options (the Monday $5 Margarita pizza) and the happy hour pizza...the pizzas left much to be desired. We got the mini sausage pizza on the happy hour menu. They didn't do a good job at all of spreading the cheese evenly on the pizza -- in fact, one slice didn't have any cheese at all!? There was only one piece of basil. The margarita pizza was just as pitiful...the cheese was really only on half the pizza, only one piece of basil (basil is kind of a key part of a margarita pizza!?), and worst of all the bottom of the pizza was completely soggy. The pizza -- I mean dough with tomato sauce (and maybe a tiny piece of cheese) -- was pretty much falling apart as I was eating it. We also got drinks. I thought that their mule was fine, but my friend ordered the Old Fashioned and felt like they kind of skimped on that drink. More than half of the drink was a giant ice cube.  The one redeeming thing is that their sausage is actually pretty good.",

You can't pick a slice up with your hands. If you like Napoletana pizza this might be ok although I have never been to Naples.  I haven't been to the Henderson location but I didn't think it will be much better.  Everyone has an opinion and we all have our own taste.  The reviews that were 5 stars I can't for the life of me understand why unless they don't know great pizza.  Chicago and New York have great pizza and I will continue to search.

Settebello did that for me. My favorites: caprese (keep that plate for your pizza to get ever drop of the oil & balsamic left behind), arancini, Settebello specialty pizza (sans pine nuts) & the z... I forget what they're called... the fried dough balls with nutella. The only time I didn't love my pizza was when we got one that had eggplant, hoping it would be like the slices of sauteed eggplant that melted in our mouths at Custom Built Pizza. Instead, it was in cubes & seemed raw/tough still. The ambiance is quite lovely- dark wood, very lodge feeling, yet open & light during the day & rustic romantic at nite. The service is satisfactory- they pay the right amount of attention & give feedback about the menu items, which I like.",

    "text": "My wife and I frequent Settebello because of it's close proximity to our office and the exceptional food/service we've received in the past. However,  today was not one of those days. We arrived begore the typical lunch rush at noon and were seated. The new waitres was obviously frazzled already. We oredered our usual lunch special - two pizzas and two salads for $22. The new girl then informed us we could not order what we wanted, even after we assured her that we would pay the difference for the additional toppings like we have everytime in the past. She got offended and told us the other girl (the usual waitress that has served us for the last year or so) was fired and that ot was because of people like us modifying our order. We decided to stay and order the special and the side salads since we had already been served our drinks. Our salads finally came,  but by this time several other people had shown up for lunch. She must have been the only person hosting and waiting tables as it was pretty hard to get her attention. Our pizza came out of the oven and sat on the counter for several mintues before she came out of the back and finally cut it and brought it to our table. Sadly it was now cold, but had the promise of being a pretty tasty pizza. When we asked to settle up for the salad and drinks, and told her our pizza was cold she proceeded to walk over to the manager and tell him we didn't like the pizza and so the very nice man came over and gave us a free pizza coupon for our next visit. (But to be clear, no we actually thought the flavor was good, but eating a cold pizza was not to be desired and trying to flag down this waitress was very difficult). All in all kudos to the manager, he obviously cares about his customers, especially ones that come almost once  a week. I guess the other girl who used to work there was fired for being nice and accommodating to her customer, who knows,  I can only go by what the new waitress told us (who even says stuff like that to customers? ) but I can tell you that the service was terrible",

Took 40min to get pizza first off. The bolognese was disgusting. It was like eating soup pizza. Was basically raw dough in the middle. I had one slice of the bolognese and was done. The settebello was raw in the middle as well but not as bad as the bolognese. The waitress said the pizza was soft but I was not expecting raw pizza. Just a horrible texture.

    "text": "We arrived at 4pm and found the restaurant in comparative darkness without any customers.  The latter actually worked in our favor because we had wonderfully quick service from a very knowledgeable server. We ordered a warm beet appetizer together with arancini ( rice balls ). The warm beets were served in a small cast iron skillet with chopped Italian almonds which were a delight followed by the arancini which were crispy and deliciously warm. So far so good. Then we had 2 pizzas. Mine was a \"bianca\" with just mozzarella arugula and parmigiano but I added basil and Kalamata olives. My husband ordered a basic pizza Margherita.  Both pizzas were nicely charred around the edges but the interiors were slightly gummy. Having said this I do think a little longer in the wood fired oven would have been the answer to make the base nicely crispier. The pizzas tasted very pleasant even so . We ordered 3 desserts to get the feel of the menu. A Tiramisu , some zeppole and a gluten free torta chocolate cake. All desserts were delightful but the Nutella free zeppole were the best I have tasted outside of Italy. The bill was around $93 but all things considered, this was indeed value for money due to us ordering far more than most people would even consider eating. An espresso following the meal was excellent and rounded off my early dinner very adequately.  I would highly recommend Settebello but suggest an early or late visit because I think this place would be overflowing at normal times to dine. We left here at 6pm and it was filling up quickly. A+++ for this local eatery.",

Tonight we took our friend from out of town here and, again, they did not disappoint. However, their Internet was down which meant they could not accept credit cards. After waiting a bit while (the manager?) was on the phone with their company trying to get it back up, the man came over to us and handed us a new bill, apologized for the inconvenience, and told us to have a good night. Confused, I looked at the bill and they completely compt our meal. I absolutely appreciate the gesture and working at a high end nail salon I understand when frustrations happen to where you comp a service.. I've been on that side and I understand the personal feeling of being upset that a customer would be annoyed with you for something out if your control. Needless to say, we absolutely love this place, will always pay for our meals even if they show their kindness in paying for the meal themselves, and will be a long time customer. You guys, as I've said, do not disappoint. Thank you so much for always a great experience.",

Never asked how the meal was because then we could have told them that it was quite cold where we were sitting. The table although nice for atmosphere, is very unsanitary since it's unfinished wood. My friend when she was dishing up ur own salad dropped several pieces of salad as well as pine nuts etc and they just settle into the nooks and crannies of this table. I will say that they do give you a lot of whatever toppings are listed for that pizza, are on that pizza. We had the settebello pizza and it did have plenty of sausage and mushrooms and pine nuts on it however not too much cheese. But all in all it did come with the variety of toppings that was stated on the menu. I'm glad I was warned about the pie being wet, that is not my preferred style however this was the style and it was something that I was aware of. All in all a so-so experience",

    "text": "Pros: Food is great, genuinely Italian, food comes out fast. Cons: Poor service. If there is good service, they'll provide good service to 1 or 2 tables and not the same service to the rest of the tables, which is really odd. I'm not sure if they are specifically nice to regular customers and don't care much for new customers, but that is the vibe I got from here. We actually had to get up and find the server to have them take our order. Again, if this was the same service they gave to everyone else in the restaurant, I'd just think the servers don't hav experience. But it's especially upsetting when you are seeing the server be top notch with a couple customers while completely ignoring other customers by not taking your order, not cleaning your table, not getting refills...truly, it's a shame because the food is good. I'm happy for everyone else on here who got great service but I simply cannot say the same.",

All the ingredients were fresh and although they have a thin crust pizza, half pie was just enough for me to feel completely satisfied. All the staff were super nice and helpful, also the service was extremely quick and professional. Definitely order a dessert since they have a huge selection of delish treats! Unfortunately i didnt have any room for it this time but i will definitely go back and try the lemon tart :)",

    "text": "What a delightful find. Looking for pizza and decided to give this place a try. So glad we did! Walked in, greeted by friendly staff and a nice, welcoming dining area. Seated promptly and our waitress came over immediately to bring menus and offer drinks. She was super friendly and very informative on ingredients and tastes of various items.   We ordered two pizzas (12\", thin crust, wood baked oven)--the margherita and the Vico. Both tasty, husband and son preferred the Vico. I loved the margherita. Yummy sauces and fresh ingredients. Nice & thin very foldable. We also got bruschetta as an appetizer and it was so good. It was a little different than normal as it used a pesto sauce base. Since I love pesto it was a definite winner!  I also got a beet salad sans goat cheese. Absolutely delicious.  For drinks it was waters, a diet coke, and I got a specialty cocktail--the scotch orchard. Very good, very well made, and totally worth the price ($12).  Bathrooms were a little odd--there was motion lighting in the main part of the bathroom and in each stall. So weird, but it worked. Down one star for the toilet paper on the wall--there was a hook on the wall next to the sink area where an unopened roll of tp was placed...assuming by staff for ease of changing for a later time?  Anyhow, slightly off putting to have tp chilling on the wall. Everything else is fantastic though!  Great place for pizza, I'd definitely eat here again.",

And the reality is that this is vera pizza napoletana and no other self-proclaimed Neapolitan restaurant ever came close to the quality and authenticity of Settebello.  The pizza Margherita DOC is spot on in terms of mozzarella to Marzano tomato ratio, basil, and olive oil. The dough is exactly like we eat it in Naples: soft, thin, but not soggy.   The service is always good and friendly, and pretty much everything on the menu is fresh. The slice the prosciutto from the ham leg right in front of you. The tiramisu is delicious: it's sweet but without failing to celebrate the unique taste of espresso.   All in all, this is definitely my favorite place on the West Coast to eat authentic Neapolitan pizza.",

I thought the dough at Setebello was particularly great, whereas the cheese and sauce were only normal-great. (Check out <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.varasanos.com%2FPizzaRecipe.htm&s=4c15509c30492ef95f7af800e441fc9659fa1e881b446eff24f16270b6affa82\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">varasanos.com/PizzaRecip...</a>. Settebello is listed as \"to be tasted\"! That means something.)  On top of the great taste, there isn't a long wait, and on Mondays, Margherita pies are only FIVE BUCKS! The service was great too.  Although the pizza was great, I wasn't in love with the meat balls. I have trouble bringing myself to call them anything better than \"average\".  The deserts were pretty awesome though. Not \"tier one you MUST have them\", but definitely good.",

This time I decided to take the fam bam....well they think I'm the biggest retard because this place was awful. I don't think they will ever trust me again ha ha.  We walked in to be seated and it took about 10 minutes before anyone came to seat us. Then as we sat we noticed....THE A/C IS NOT ON!! they relied on fans. But whatever. It wasn't miserable...but it wasn't exactly comfortable either. The table next to me kept bringing up the fact that it was hot.  Took about 15 minutes for the girl to greet us at the table and get a drink order in. She didn't look very happy. She was not very warm and friendly either...but as I look around she's the only one working in this hot hell of a room...so I'd probably be a miserable person too.  Because she's by herself...well the service is just as you'd expect...lacking:  The pizza wasn't like I remembered, it was soggy on the bottom...like seriously wet. It was probably better before because I had the smaller appetizer size that seemed to bake better. But this pizza was gross. Maybe ask for yours to be crisped up more when you put your order in.  I would have stayed and had another drink or 2 if it wasn't so damned hot.",

I got there an hour before they closed and our waiter told us they were shutting down their oven in about 10-15 mins, so we did feel a little rushed. I feel that if the restaurant closes at a certain time the earliest they should close down the kitchen is maybe 15 minutes early, especially for guests there for their first time.   The food...absolutely fantastic! Their pizzas are so delicious & full of flavor! The appetizers are wonderful. I honestly have no complaints whatsoever about the food.

The reason I'm finally posting a review is because of their zeppoles.  OUT OF THIS WORLD!  I seriously don't know why they don't promote those puppies more.  I'm Italian and have never had one like this.  Not your typical dense, fried dough.  They are stuffed with Nutella or Cannoli filling and more like a fried cream puff.  The order comes with 6 giant stuffed \"balls\".   Highly recommend.  Great place for a lunch date or dinner with the family.  And the service is always wonderful as well.

My newest discovery is their lunch special each day - you can get a Margherita pizza for $7 and the insalata grande for an additional $4. This is perfect to share (or you can get your own pizza and just share the salad).  This location is much larger than the one in Henderson. It's the original Vegas location, so that makes sense - but the Henderson restaurant is much closer to us and our go-to for pizza. However, we've found ourselves in Summerlin often lately and Settebello is always on our list of stops when hunger sets in.",

The cooks other than Augustine have burnt every single pizza that I have seen come out of the oven. I saw the two cooks and they both were not paying attention and we're talking to each other while the pizza was cooking. Whether the oven is hot or not, they both burned all of the pizzas that came out of the oven. I would rather pay double for Augustine to make and cook the pizza because he doesn't burn it first of all and the flavor is more deep and the mozzarella is perfectly melted. I feel like I wasted my money and time today because I cannot even eat the crust or the bottom of the pizza because it was all completely soggy and burned. Like what I am left with to eat... The toppings?! I think Augustine should be the main chef at Settebello because he is consistently making perfect pizzas which is the only reason why we go there and gave 5 stars in the past. I will not be going there anymore except on Sunday's when Augustine works there and the two other cooks are not. My point is why should I pay $45 for a couple burned pizzas? Also, I usually don't like to write bad reviews, like last time I was there, there was strand of blonde hair and well what do you know... the pizza was burnt. And of course Augustine was not the cook. If you like burned pizzas this is the place for you.",

My fave is the Settebello without pancetta. Yummy and satisfying. The pancetta makes it too salty and heavy.   They also have great cocktails. Usually get the Miguel Douglas. Had the barbershop medicine and it was delicious.",

We came during the lunch rush and the place wasn't very busy. They're understaffed (3 people) and the 2 waiters and 1 waitress were dressed very inappropriately for work. In all honesty I thought they were customers themselves.  When we walked in the host tried to sit us at a high table with high chairs even though my father walks with a cane... I was shocked that this boy couldn't use common sense.  The waitress as very slow at getting us anything we needed and quite rude when we questioned her as to why she took 12 minutes to take our bill so she could run the card.  We both got the lunch special. My father got the panzenella salad with the settebello pizza and I got the beet salad with the diavola pizza. Both salads were very underdressed and dry. The pizzas where also lacking in flavor, depth and the crust was overcooked and chewy. I won't be coming back here but if you want to try it by all means go ahead. Nothing ventured nothing gained!",

Located in the Village Square shopping center right by the movie theater, there is tons of parking so its very convenient. We have tried various items here but our favorites have been their Italian Panini (not on the menu but ask your server/bartender about it) Its huge so I suggest sharing it! Also when were in the mood for pizza we get the Diavola, Crushed Tomatoes, Finnochiona (Peppered Salame), Roasted Red Bell Peppers, Crushed Red Peppers, Garlic, Mozzarella, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. AMAZING! it has a kick so its not for those who dont like spice. Josh the GM is great. He makes our dining exp so much more enjoyable then anywhere else we frequent. I highly recommend this hidden gem!",

I am somewhat of a regular here and need to get in the habit of checking-in,  but I typically get a Settebello pizza, unsliced, with spicy oil.  The reason for this, and after tasting all of the pizze on the menu, the Settebello has, by far, the best flavor combo if you're into a more savory, earthy flavor in pizza.  My favorite in Las Vegas and the US, period.  This is what real pizza, not greasy NY or Chicago style bs pizza, should and does taste like.",

    "text": "I am the type of individual who loves pictures to be able to see what the food looks like but unless you look on yelp that's gonna be your best resource.  The descriptions of all the pizzas sounded good so it was a little difficult to choose.  However we asked the waitress what was the popular and she mentioned the Diavola and Settebello. The boyfriend and I shared the Diavola, and we ordered it extra crispy and asked for it to be a white pizza instead of red.  My recommendation is if you're hungry ... don't share. One pizza is not enough for two (order your own ... plus you can try more options when you order two!)  Diavlo has a spicy kick to it which I loved, I wish it was a little spicier.   Extra crispy is the way to go.  If you get it original the crust is crispy but when you get towards the middle you will have to use a knife and fork to eat it, or fold it in half and bite into it because it's soft in the middle.  Our friends got both the Settebello, one got the original and the other got it as a white pizza.  I definitely liked it as a white pizza.  However I am a fan of white pizzas so it might be a little biased.  With that being said, the waitress said any pizza can be a white pizza and you can add or take off anything to your liking.   Saving the best for last ... the Bella Melo pizza for dessert was delicious.  Super sweet with caramel and apples.    Overall this place was a nice place for a group of friends to get together to share pizza and have good conversations.",

They are experienced Settebello diners, and we ordered 3 pizzas to share among us.    We arrived just after they opened, and were seated right away. The restaurant itself is lovely and airy. Service was friendly and conversational.  We ordered the settebello, the bianca, and another pizza that was not listed on the menu (I believe it is called the \"Raphael\").  All of them were delicious. The dough tasted fresh, the ingredients were delicious, and I didn't even mind that the crust was thin- it wasn't too hard and crunchy.  I am glad that Settebello is on the west side of the valley, and I'm sure I will return!",

The wood-burning oven and wood pile in the dining room gives the whole place a cozy and inviting atmosphere. Our server, Bethany, gave us a nice overview of the menu and explained their style of pizza - Napoleon - and also briefed us on the Happy Hour specials.   We were pleased that they had $5 mini-pizzas on the Happy Hour menu since we saw several pizzas (all 12 inches only) on the regular menu that we would like to try. I opted for the Diavola and Hubby got the Emilia with red sauce instead of white. We also ordered a couple of drinks but nothing special. They did seem to have a nice selection of wines and beers and we will definitely explore this next visit when we have more time.  The pizzas arrived timely and looked delicious. Like another reviewer stated, the thin crust is crisp on the outside edges but soft in the middle. It almost seems to form a \"bowl\" as it bakes which causes this. I personally found it to be fine. What I was disappointed with was the taste. Everything was fresh but bland. I had to add salt (which I NEVER do, especially to pizza!) and red pepper flakes to give it flavor. There was certainly nothing \"Devilish\" about the Diavola!! Hubby enjoyed the Emilia and said next time that he would like to try the Settebello.   We will come back when we have more time and try some different menu items for sure!",

He was knowledgeable and passionate, and we thoroughly enjoyed our evening.  For starters my husband and I had a platter with toasted bread, prosciutto, mozzarella buffalo, and tomatoes in basil. We topped one topping on the next, and it was to die for. It wasn't even on the menu, so I can't remember what it is called!  My husband had an Old Fashioned and he said it was the best one of his life.  Next, we both dove into some pies. My husband got the diavvolo (spelling?) and I got a pizza with artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, and salami. Both pizzas were incredible, but my husband's was spicier and more full of flavor. The crust is thin, doughy in the center, and the crust dipped into the red pepper olive oil is the best thing in the whole world.  For dessert, I had the traditional tiramisu, and my husband tried the strawberry and crema dessert. Both were heavenly.   We asked Josh throughout the meal to pair up our food with adult beverages, and each time he was spot on.  We cannot wait to go back! The best pizza in town. In fact, my husband said the pizza was better than when he was in Italy.  Well done, Settebello!",

We were offered the private room in the back because it was just me and a lady friend, it was windowed with a glass door and very quiet. We were able to have nice conversation without having to talk over other patrons back there.   We ordered a misto plate which had. A variety of Italian meats, cheese, and grilled veggies with focaccia bread. The server suggested a salad with just greens, balsamic, and shaved Parmesan. Perfect! My friend ordered a mini margarita pizza because it was available at happy hour price at only $5! I ordered a 12\" full sized Diavola pizza because I was hungry.   The pizza was soft and fluffy. The salami was spicy but not overbearing. My server brought out some pepper flake infused olive oil to put on the pizza and it really added an extra kick.   On top of this, we each had a drink and our check came out under $50! Truly the best experience I've had anywhere here and it's a great place to take a date. Go there now!!",

I lived in Italy for 2 years and at the really nice pizzerias in Italy, this is how the food tastes.  Here are my favorite dishes. The insalata Grande, the beet salad, the crustini con crudo, and my favorite pizza is the settebello.  Their desserts are out of this world! My favorites are the Nutella pizza, the s'mores calzone , and they have this salt caramel pudding with an armaretto cookie. That armaretto cookie when it comes fresh out of the oven is one of the best things I've ever tasted.  If you love real Italian pizza and real Italian food then you will love this restaurant.",

I ordered the Bianca. I wasn't too impressed with it and since it was such a thin crust it got soggy pretty quickly. My husband ordered the Capricciosa. We weren't blown away by that either.   Overall service wasn't the quickest and most attentive (waited for more napkins for a good 10 minutes or so) but the credit card machine was back in working order. I wasn't too impressed and I'm not sure I'll be back when there's a lot of pizza places that I do love around! Sorry Settebello!",

    "text": "I am from Italy for real.  Pizza in Italy is considered an health food because the ingredients are few but fresh and the dough is thin but flavorful.  I was never able to find a real Italian pizza in the US before until I tasted Settebello's pizza when I moved to Las Vegas.  I say this after living in New York City which many claim has great pizza (I'm not one of them). If you're looking for American-style pizza with lots of toppings and fat, Settebello is not for you. If you're looking for an Italian pizza where ingredients are fresh, Settebello is for you.   La migliore pizza a Vegas!",

You only get it in this location and it's amazing. it sounds weird, but it's an amazing flavor combination. I also love their Pizza Capricciosa. The Romana Salad and the Beet Salad are very good too. One of the best things though, is their Panna Cotta dessert. Perfect consistency, not overly sweetened and has a nice added touch with the Strawberry and Balsamic on top. Decor is rustic and spacious with a \"generous\" feel to it. Service is very good as well.  We've been there many times and got served by different people but it was always great and friendly service.",

Our app the Bruschetta was horrible, from the taste and texture to the balsamic that was \"artistically\" swirled in the center.   The pizza I ordered which was the Vico didn't have enough toppings...basically a white pizza with horrible inconsistent cuts of onions, and maybe a toddlers handful of meat...no joke! The meat on the pizza was less than 1/4 of a cup.   The canoli was by far the worst canoli I've ever had. Paula Dean couldn't even save this dish.   The Worst:  Both pizzas were under cooked. Either the chef really didn't care because we walked in 35 minutes before close or because a group of 6+ walked in 20 minutes before close or because he was too occupied making sure what looked like his family was having a better meal than anyone else.   I see and hear people rave about this place. Regardless of the friendly waitstaff, I wouldn't return due lack of flavor, lack of originality and inability to make something so simple as pizza cook properly.",

Their pizza is very flavorful, and the crust here is soft, lightly toasted, and has a slight smoky flavor from the wood fire oven. For their pizzas, I love their Emilio, Vico, and Diavola Pizza. The Emilio and Vico are both a creamy sauce pizza, and the Diavola comes with a spicy tomato sauce. Their Prosciutto Crostini was very tasty as well. It comes topped with generous Proscuitto and parmigiano-reggiano.    I loved their Tequila Mockingbird cocktail, and it's unlike any other cocktail I've had before.

When she finally decide to come by, she asked me if we have been helped. Confused, I thought to myself, isnt her job to seat guest down?   Then the waitress came by our table. As I was ordering, it was only a one way communication. I was telling her our order but she isnt saying a word, after I finished. She finally replied, \"is that everything?\" Such great customer interaction! Wow!  Here's the only positive, the order arrived quickly, but the mozzerela cheese wasnt melted on the margherita! What a shame.  At the end when I asked for the bill, again they seem to be just passing our table and doesnt care at all. There was only 5 small tables that night. 2 servers and a host that helps.

We got a booth and were given time to look at the menu.  Waters came out and while we glanced at the drink menu. They had some pretty funny drink names: Tequila Mockingbird was our fave. lol We ordered our pizzas: capricciosa and diavola.   The pizzas came out pretty fast and they were made to perfection. The capricciosa had crushed tomatos, prosciutto cotto, artichokes, mushrooms, olives, mozzarella, basil and olio. The blend of these ingredients were so mouthwatering; I couldn't stop eating!! I finished the whole pizza by myself lol.  My friend had the diavola which had crushed tomatos, red bell peppers, spicy salame, garlic, mozzarella, basil and olio. I didn't get to taste it but only because my friend ate all of it--meaning it had to have been delicious since he is very much so italian (speaks it fluently, so I guess that means his opinion is legit).   The service was great as well; our waitress was attentive and friendly; she checked in with us and wasn't overbearing at constantly checking in.

All the decorations makes it a really nice place to enjoy a really good pizza napolitana. Very original concept and quality.  I only eat gluten free pizza which is hard to find good quality pizza and they make the best so far.  The only bad comment I will say about this place is the host. I came tonight 3/16/2019 at night at 9:30pm he insist the place close at 10pm and he couldn't take more people, but we insist and they took our order, after us came a couple but he didn't take it at all (at 9:45pm). His actitud was rude, he didn't give us napkins, and at the end he took the empty dishes  while we still eating. It wasn't a nice experience. Very rude host.",

    "text": "This place NEVER disappoints me. Probably the best pizza place In Las Vegas hands down. I've never left this place and thought anything less than 5 stars.  The Settebello pizza is a trademark. I get it every time. It's become my number one pizza BUT lately we've been getting the Diavolla. It's got crushed tomatoes, peppered salami, roasted bell peppers, crushed red peppers,  garlic and mozzarella. It's got a great kick. That pizza is slowly reaching for the number one spot. Also if you go during HH, you can get the Diavolla as a pizzette for just $5! What a steal.   The appetizers are amazing also as well as the salads. During HH they have this crostini con crudo which is so good. The balsamic reduction on it is delicious.   The best part about this place is the Tirimasu dessert. It is one of my favorites. It's not too big where you won't be able to finish it after a fulfilling meal. But it's not too small where you'll be like I need another. It's perfect way to end an amazing meal!",

I have also tried the Quattro Formaggi (four cheese pizza), Marinara (no cheese), and the Bianca.  All are good, but it's the Margherita that has my heart.   There is no wrong time to go to this Settebello.  It's not as busy as the Henderson location and I have never waited to be seated.  The best time to go to Settebello is during happy hour (M-F, 3 PM to 6 PM) when apps have special prices, beers are half off, and a personal pizza is only $5. I have never had a poor experience when it comes to service at this location.  Overall, Settebello is the best.  I find it very difficult to give Settebello any less than 5-Stars, especially since they serve pizza exactly how I like it.",

It's consistency is more True than that of the pizzas I've had at due forni.  The toppings are more in line with traditional Italian dishes.  I was very happy with the pizzas.

We walk into settobello, and are met with the slightly post modern (I'm terrible with these names) feel. It was big and roomy with bits of yellow tinged lights. Very nice for a day like this. The front was extremely friendly. The service was lightning. Although, my water was filled at an average rate. Other than that, it was a very nice ambiance and service.  On to the food. Pizza was on point. We had the special with roasted pork, pistachio pesto, mozzarella, basil, and parmesan. Great flavors, interesting texture. I actually prefer my pizzas a little crunchy towards the center, but the chew was kinda nice on it. We also had an evil twin even more coco jesus and holy crap, every bar needs this beer. You get the awesome coffee notes that you usually would from stouts, but you also get berries and a bit of coconut on the top. Amazing beer. Seriously made my meal. To top it off, the tiramisu was excellent. Bits of coffee, bits of sweetness to round the palate.  Overall dope experience. 9/10 will be back.",

Randall wanted Papa Johns for the 4th consecutive night, but i was like, \"Dude. You have a huge zit protruding from your forehead from all the grease you've been consumIng. Let's hit Bello\". So we rocked it, right after I got my first tattoo (a hibiscus flower with some text: \"Chingona\".) We were starving when we arrived and must have actually looked obese, because the hostess sat us in this weight reinforced booth. Our waitress was adorable. She tried to take our drink order and Randall straight screamed a food order at her. Hella embarrassing. I actually saw spit fly out of his mouth and land on the table. Speaking of mouths, I have a gnarly sore on my lower lip that I'm positive Randall gave me. Yeah. He did actually order some bomb shit though. To compliment my glass of Banfi, we shared the Insalata Grande (sans queso) and the Marinara Pizza. We added some mushrooms (Randall wouldn't eat them because he thought they'd get him high he's hella straight edge) and some toasted pine nuts. The food was gone within 8 minutes of arriving. It was that good. Plus we were celebrating tonight. Yeah. Your girl got REVIEW OF THE DAY on YELP today. Well, technically Randall did. He wrote the damn thing. When we toasted to my success and he found out, he turned around completely and spent the rest of the meal staring out the window and softly crying. Our waitress, god bless her, came over and asked if everything was alright and i told her not to worry. She brought Randall a complimentary bowl of ice cream, but since he was crying and facing the opposite direction, I straight jacked his shit and ate it. We'll be driving home soon. And once we get home, I'm sure he'll want a foot rub. So there's that. Thank you, YELP!",

    "text": "You can almost miss Settebello Pizzeria Napoletana as you drive by...with the mild tone of the logo above the restaurant, amongst a storefront of other businesses...I wonder if I would notice this otherwise ample space if I wasn't looking for it. But once you come in!..the only missing you'll experience is a gentle longing to return to Settebello.  Located in the Village Square Plaza on Sahara and Fort Apache, home to standards such as Archi's Thai Cafe, and local's favorite Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dogs, resides a king of yet another unique concept: Settebello Pizzeria Napoletana.  I am not a huge fan of Pizza, but when I want to have a bite of that cheesy and wonderfully Napoletana crust, this is one of the absolute best options in Vegas! And here are a few reasons why:  1. The crust is flame blistered for a bit of crunch that soon gives way to a soft, fold it in your hands or cut it with a knife and fork texture that is only found in Napoletana crusts....not the most popular style in town, but one of the best IMHO. 2. There are many seats for larger groups, as well as intimate booths. Want to watch your sports team's score? Grab a seat at the bar. 3. The Aroma of the open-fire, domed, pizza oven, fiercely baking your favorite Pizza is simply intoxicating.  4. Don't care for Pizza? Settebello offers a variety of Salads, Antipasta, and appetizers, such as the splendid Aracini, classic Meat Balls, or Insalata Grande.  5. Many choices of wine are available from Italy, as well as other locals around the world, and are offered by the glass or whole bottle... or by two bottles if you are like me and my company. 6. Service. Their service has never fallen short. It doesn't matter what time of the day you come in, the staff is always professional, attentive, and knowledgeable.  My most recent visit, found my love and I coming in unannounced, part of a group of 9, on a Sunday night...luckily for us, there was a big table for us to all sit together. The food came quickly, was fresh, and tasted amazing, while wine and water never missed a proper pour.  Arguably the best Pizza in town, according to many a Pizza Snob, Settebello also hits the spot for me. So if you find yourself craving some great pizza, come have a slice or two with some friends, or order a whole pie for yourself!!!  -2018 review #6-",

    "text": "So this pizza was really interesting. Gluten-free pizzas in other restaurants usually taste like really bad microwaved pizzas, but Settebello's recipe was totally different. Their gluten free pizza had like a naan bread base (which is probably just Napoli-style; I have never had it before, though, and that's the closest comparison I can draw!) and fresh ingredients piled on top of it. They're definitely not American pizzas; they have a very authentic Italian taste (especially the sauce). The hostess said pretty much anything on the menu can be made gluten free for just $4 extra, which was incredibly accommodating. My friend and I went at around 5PM on a Sunday, and it wasn't very crowded and service was incredibly quick (the pizzas came around 10 minutes after we ordered). The ambiance was really nice, too; it's very tastefully decorated and would probably make a great date night.",

I had an Old Fashioned which was pretty good and only $5.   We ordered a few mini pizzas and an artichoke crostini.   The crostini was pretty basic and kinda tasted like artichoke from a can slapped on to some toast with goat cheese.  The mini pizzas were excellent. Perfect char on the crust from the brick oven and the sauces/cheeses were well blended.  The service however was lacking. It was apparent the first few minutes of arrival that the staff was struggling with the amount of people in the bar area...we were the bulk of the people in the bar. The waitress took all of our orders but didn't write anything down. Sadly, she had to return to confirm what was ordered but didn't want more than one person talking at a time. She then starting making drinks as well while another person was behind the bar not doing much of anything. Next time, write things down and nudge your co-worker to help you out.",

    "text": "One night while driving around Village Square and changing my mind from Rubio's, Jollibee, Yojie's and Buldogi's, I realized this restaurant was here. Since my obsession with Grimaldi's changed to my obsession with The Pizza Kitchen, I've been pretty pizza-ed out, but still wanted to try their Napoletana style pizza. We had just missed happy hour, but I'm glad we got to enjoy their regular menu first. Their beet and goat cheese salad was fresh and a very hearty portion size for two people. The crostini con crudo featured high quality meat and cheese, but I don't think I'd order in the future since the meat kept on getting stuck in my teeth. We decided on sharing the Settebello pizza which was everything I wanted a sausage pizza to be. I enjoyed their dough and thought they had the perfect amount of salt in it. Everyone should always save room for dessert here. From all the amazing choices, we decided on the crostada, which is a tart with ricotta, chocolate chips and Nutella. It's actually not too chocolatey and very well-balance. Our dedicated server was delightful and gave us amazing recommendations, and any staff that helped us along the way was very friendly. The only complaint I have would be that the lighting in the restaurant is a bit off and distracting - it made for some weird shadows over the tables and gave me a bit of a headache. Otherwise, no other qualms about this place and hope to be back here soon!",

    "text": "For Napoli pizza, as close to authentic as u can get.  Owners are two brothers and a buddy that travelled to Italy and decided to bring Napoli pizza to vegas.  I did not know prior to coming, but the Italian government has an agency called VPN that will certify that you conform to their standards when making Napoli pizza.  Settebello is certified.  Their brick oven is from Napoli and two trainers were flown in from Italy, per the server.  In addition, on the way out, I noticed a dozen bags of flour with a Napoli branding.  Wow, authenticity is a priority here!  The pizza's crust was very thin, soft, and moist.  As other yelpers have reported, the crust is too soft to eat with your hands.  Eat with a fork and knife!  I enjoyed the experience of eating their very traditional pizza.  Temper your expectations on flavor.  Authentic Italian is not over the top....  Come here on a quiet day and appreciate Settebello's strive to be authentic.  Chat with the staff for background info on the process and enjoy their pizza!",

    "text": "I've really come to appreciate VPN style pizza. Because of the high quality ingredients, it truly distinguishes this pizza apart from any other pizzeria. Imported flour from Napoli, San Marzano tomatoes, meats from various American distributers and Buffalo Mozzarella give this place the ingredients to make one hell of a pizza.   What we ordered:  Arancini appetizer- not the best I've had, but I came here for pizza.  Margherita DOC Crushed Tomatoes, Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, Parmigiano Reggiano, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Simple yet exquisite. Yes I just used that word to describe pizza. Truly my favorite pizza here.  Diavola Crushed Tomatoes, Finnochiona (Peppered Salame), Roasted Red Bell Peppers, Crushed Red Peppers, Garlic, Mozzarella, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. This definitely had a bite to it, I like spicy food, the peppered salame gave it a delicious spice to it.  Pizza Carbonara Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Egg, Mozzarella, Cracked Pepper, Extra Virgin Olive Oil My very pizza with egg on it that I liked. I was a bit surprised myself. The oven cooked the egg perfectly to blend with the rest of the ingredients. This was an excellent slice of pie.  Settebello Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Still a classic. Along with the DOC, this is a staple when ordering here. Not usually a fan of sausage of pizza, but a total exception to my rule here.  Pizza Special: Rafael (different special weekly) Mozzarella, Salame, Roasted Onion, Garlic, Oregano, Red Pepper Flakes, Basil, Parmigiana, EVOO. Excellent! This was my second favorite pizza sampled that day.   Caramel Budino-very sweet, if you like caramel, this is the dessert for you.  S'mores Calzone-it was essentially chocolate chips melted within a calzone.  Bella Mella-Dessert Pizza was excellent, cinnamon apples and mascarpone was delish.  Zeppole-nutella filled donuts. Need I say more? This was my favorite dessert out of the four we tried.  For a True hand crafted pizza, this is the place I will come. Being the only VPN certified place in town, Settebello stands out from other pizzerias. Sign up to be on the email list and be notified of their weekly pizza special.  *Sidenote, I really wish people would stop complaining about the pizza being undercooked and/or wet. This is what VPN style pizza is, it's not Chicago style, it's not New York style. Grimaldi lovers probably won't appreciate this style of pizza.",

    "text": "I have come here plenty of times, so I figured it was time to give it a review.  Ever since I stumbled on this place, I have always enjoyed each subsequent visit. They serve  Neapolitan pizzas that originates from Italy instead of the more traditional American versions like thin crust New York Style, Chicago deep dish, fancy California pizzas, etc.  They have a varied menu of appetizers, salads, pizzas, and desserts, so there are plenty of options for anyone to find something to suit their tastes. I normally tend to get their margherita, crushed tomatoes, cheese, olive oil, basil, and  parmigiano reggiano, and their Settebello, a pizza similar to the margherita but with sausage, pancetta and mushrooms.   I am always looking for a good cannoli and the one that they serve here is exceptional, especially coming from a pizza place.  As I am regularly pleased with their food and service, my only complaint is that the bottoms of their pizzas can be soggy and limp at times. Even when it does happen, which isn't often, the pizza still tastes awesome.  If you are a fan of pizza, and are looking for something different than your regular New York style or Chicago style joint, this would be a good addition to your pizza rotation.",

Excited about not having to drive all the way too Henderson get me some Settebello. It just open this past week sometime so had my reservations opening week. They might still be working out kinks but honest everything went really smooth from service and the food still amazing!   I had the pizza carbonara. One of my favorite pizza on the menu. Still taste amazing as always.The fried egg topping that think adds so much depth too any pizza. You get some of that good old fashion fried bacon and eggs he perfect compliment. Breakfast on pizza! NOm.NOM. I had dinner with brother family got too try few appetizers besides pizza. We had Arancini balls and was awesome! It first time every ordered them. I love outside perfect crispy golden brown, risotto was cooked perfect and creamy, and sits on tomato sauce that was nice refreshing light. You combine all the elements together really really good. Also had the MIsto and focaccia. The Misto presentation on long rectangle cutting board is art looking at it. Not sure which meat too eat first too the cheeses and decided hit the olive/artichoke next. The focaccia was great. It not your fluffy one that looks more like bread bread but much more thin and just has nice flavor. It perfect appetizer too compliment Misto.   The service was definitely five star from the minute walked in everyone was friendly, waitress asked if we been here before (we like yup! so never had too go over the different style of pizza then most people think normal crusty crust) and if had any questions with the menu, and never had too worry about empty glass of soda. Well done.  The only difference is TOTALLY different set up then the original one. Here the open kitchen is much more open kitchen one that as soon step foot in the restaurant can see. They have cool top end slicer that can see the cooks slicing all the meats for the menu. It lot lower ceiling, have little almost private dining area (not sure if could rent it out) more wine cellar that had few tables in it, the bar area interesting they had glass panel kind of separate the two areas but really connected, darker in general inside, and feels more upscale vibe then the first one. I am sure the sign out front not the permanent one since just open only banner. I feel like this one holds more people then the original one.   Happy that have one on my side of town. Look forward too making more visit in the future.",

I've had it a few times, and even recently just to give it one more chance...but it's just not for ME.   With that being said, I will review JUST the DESSERTS lol :  Zeppole ($5.50): Fried Mini Donuts filled with Nutella & coated w/ Sugar. AMAZING! It doesn't get much better than this guys!!  I think about these every so often...I'd come back just for the Zeppole :)  Bella Mela ($7): Vanilla Mascarpone, Cinnamon Apples, Caramel Sauce, Powdered Sugar & Almonds. Delicious combination! Loved the crunchy apples and the caramel sauce.  Recommended.  Caramel Budino ($7): Caramel Pudding, Salted Caramel Sauce, Whipped Cream & Almond Orange Cookie. This was very sweet with all the caramel combined together but very tasty!  Just beware if you aren't a fan of overly sweet desserts.  S'mores Calzone ($7): Filled with Chocolate, Marshmallow & Powdered Sugar. Very sweet...super chocolaty. This was the least favorite dessert out of the 4 we tried.   So a cool trendy spot with a specific style of pizza that isn't for everyone...but at least the desserts are yummy!",

It a small restaurant with maybe a 10 seat bar and you can see the brick oven right when you come in. They have a small menu. They have some random salads and even some yummy desserts but I was there for the pizza. My friend found this place when she first started dating her current bae. She pushed me to come and said its the best pizza she has had aside from Italy. It is different from your normal Pizza hut or Domino's. It's thin and toasty. I like the Diavola. It has crushed tomatoes, peppered salame, roasted red bell peppers, crushed red peppers, garlic, mozzarella, and Extra Virgin Olive Oil. I put a little extra crushed red peppers and each the whole thing... Keep in mind it's thin. I feel like I'm eating two regular slices of pizza. They also have some nutella based dessert which are a must try at least once. We had zeppole for best friend's birthday and they made them a little different since she doesn't like nutella. They made them will the nutella on the side and added cinnamon which was really cool of them to do to. We have been a few times now and I think best friend is right. They hire pretty people. All of them are pretty. It's a random thing to say but when they don't know how to get ice off a table it kind of makes me laugh. We had a little accident and split a yummy Mint Collins. It took a couple trips to get it cleaned up then someone put our new napkins right in the wet spot. They also dropped some of the drink on my phone and didn't apologize or even acknowledge it.  It was more funny than anything but they were so busy for the anniversary I was just ready for my $1 pizza. Overall its a great place to grab a pizza and sit and talk with friends. The flavors in the pizza are great and different from the rest.",

Joining Bachi Burger, 808 Tapas, Firefly, and yes, Jollibee (halo-halo, y'all) in Village Square just means that there are even more options for some great food in one spot.  You can plan a date night with dinner, movie, and dessert in one spot (ColdStone Creamery is here, too).   My friends and I arrived on Friday night at 5:30pm because I was hoping to catch Happy Hour, but alas, Happy Hour at this location is Sunday-Thursday only.  Nonetheless, we still had a fabulous meal with great service.  The place only had two other parties seated at that time, but then it filled up by the time we left.  I had the arancini to start and the Margherita with mushrooms--carb city!  I only had room for two slices of the pizza, but I'm enjoying the leftovers.  The new location is sleek and modern inside with a view of the wood-burning stove from most of the dining room.  Their pizza is not for everyone, especially if you like Americanized pies from Pizza Hut or Dominoes.  This pizza is authentic Napoli-style with most ingredients imported from Italy.  If you've never had Settebello's pizza, now's the time to give it a try, especially if you live in the 'hood, too.  Mangia!",

The waiter was a little confused and would take a couple orders, then leave, then come back, then give some people pizza before he even finished getting everyone's orders.   The food-pizza was gooey and soft in the middle making it hard to pick up (sloppy) and hard to cut (falls apart). I am not sure how you eat this pizza correctly! :)Crust was just right.   We had the Setebello pizza and it was good but I would get something else next time. The friends I was with ordered desserts and although I did not try them, they looked amazing!",

The severs response was, \"...we remove items once in a while...\" The Settebello pizza was delicious as always, love the pine nuts added for texture.

Unfortunately this location isn't not even close to the original location.  The place is spacious and welcoming. The service do not exist, they don't have the minimum idea how should be done.  The misto appetizer is a joke $16 for 2 slice of inedible speck \"cut like a steak very thick\", 4 slice of salami and 3 of soppressata, some kalamata olive, 2 artichokes and some little pieces of cheese. Of course they serve the appetizer with focaccia.  I don't care about your focaccia and o don't wanna get full with it, give me some value of the $16 meat and cheese plater.  The pizza was ok like I say they should learn from the original location.",

Also 800 degrees was the only neopolitan alternative and closes early Friday and doesn't have tiramisu.   I was unsure of what to expect of what one Yelper described as a family friendly spot. Which it is. But it is still nice enough for a group of adults. There was no line and the restaurant empty but just wish the service was faster! An abundance of tables Sun at 7 yet we stood for 15 min waiting to be seated.   The pizza dough was delicious. I liked the Diavola (saltier. For meat lovers). Also enjoyed the Settebello just wished it didn't have pine nuts. The arugula prosciutto was my favorite.   The salads were mediocre - beets tasted pre-sliced and not fresh, panzanella not special.   I absolutely loved how creamy and delicious the tiramisu was. Must order.   Overall friendly but slow service. Delicious perfect chewy thin fluffy pizza crust. Worth the $20 uber off strip!",

It's the most authentic Italian cuisine that you can get besides actually being in Italy. Plus I've been to Italy, I can confirm it's that good.   Plus on Monday's they have FIVE DOLLAR authentic Margherita pizzas! How can you get better than that! They also have specials, I believe weekly, that are amazing. We got a special, the prosciutto platter thing, and a margherita pizza. The special was bbq pork with caramelized onions, garlic, and spicy oil. That should be all I have to say about that. I was speechless.   The bread for the prosciutto platter is homemade and olive oil INFUSED.... then add burrata cheese and prosciutto and man you have me spending all my money.   Seriously though, Their prices are more than fair. Their specials are great. Their pizza... you can taste the love and the tradition. I would consider moving back to Vegas just for this place.",

Even though there was an ottoman placed there in the handicap restroom.   I ordered the Pizza Pere e Jalapeno. I couldn't finish it, but it was amazing!! I have a high tolerance for spice, and it wasn't spicy at all to me; which is why it's rated 4.5 stars to me. I also tried their Zeppole, which I LOVE! I highly recommend that if you like donut-stuffed with Nutella. Despite the fact that the food were made to order, none of them took too long to make. Which, as a hungry customer, I highly appreciate. Although the pizza is a bit pricey ($15, I believe), I think it's worth it since you get a whole pizza with 6 delicious slices.  The best part, however, was the service. Waters were refilled constantly. Plates were taken when we were done eating. And the server kept checking on us and recommended some of the foods that my cousins and I tried. I love places with amazing services!",

But, if you're for fresh, delicious, freshly baked artisan pizza, drive 15-20 minutes and COME TO SETTEBELLO'S!!",

I got the Margherita pizza and my sister got the Pizza Bolognese. Oh my goodness, I must be in Italy. The sauce, the mozzarella, and the crust are authentic and tasty. I normally try not to eat the crust because of carb but I couldn't help but eat the entire pizza. Even the tiramisu is to die for. Delicious lady fingers soaked in coffee and custard...yum! I found out that they have Margherita Monday, $5 for a 12 inch pizza! You guys know where to find me on Mondays now :)",

The desserts, however, left much to be desired. The tiramisu tasted like it had been dunked in espresso and the panna cotta  tasted like it had been in the fridge long enough to form that gelatinous film on the top before spreading strawberry jello on top. Beautiful venue with decent service. I'll be back, but I'll surely skip dessert.",

I can't eat any pizza anymore without comparing it to settebello. Highly recommend the Margherita doc with spicy salami on it along with the jalapeno pere marmalade pizza.  The service is hit and miss on some days but I've had more good than bad most definitely! The beer and wine selection are fantastic as well! I didn't order dessert today but I've had the tiramisu and it's some of the best I've had before!  Overall for the food and drink quality 5 stars most definitely! Service is a too hit and miss to rate a complete 5 but I have to say our server this afternoon was fantastic! He really went above and beyond to make sure we had a great meal I just wish I caught his name!",

Gotta say - the Green Valley location makes better pizza! The crust was much doughier at the Sahara location while GV's is crispy and light. My Emilia pizza had corn on it at GV and did not have ANY corn on it at Sahara (my favorite ingredient in that pizza!!!)   Ambience and decor is nicer at this Sahara location with a more industrial chic look. GV's location is a little more of an italian restaurant feel. I love the patio at GV - wish Sahara's location had one too!  Overall, I think the food is still good but it's worth the drive down to Henderson to their other location. I would recommend the two locations work on getting more consistent recipes between the two locations.",

    "text": "Came here on a Thursday night with a group of 10 people. We started off with drinks at the bar as we waited for everyone to get there. The bar service was slow...really slow. I do hate to bash bar service, because it's quite often a staffing problem, not a speed problem with the bartender. I waited 15 minutes to get my first drink, which my friend ordered for me before I even got there. The poor bartender was crazy busy until another bartender finally joined her. They were both super friendly. My guess is, they usually staff more bartenders earlier on in the nights for Fri, Sat, Sun.  When we were ready for food, they smartly moved us into a private dining area with glass doors. This was a wise decision on their part. This IS a family establishment as well, and some in our group were getting a tad rowdy. Good to move to keep everyone happy.   The pizza was phenomenal. We ordered the gluten free crust and it was, hands down, the best gluten free crust I have had. I actually was super skeptical it was even gluten free, so I had to ask what was in it.   We did have a little mix up with the bills at the end due to our switching from the bar to the dining area.   All in all, great time here. Props to the staff here for letting us ourselves while maintaining a family atmosphere for the rest of the customers.",

I liked the crushed tomatoes approach to the sauce, but I wish Settebello would rethink how much tomato juice they are allowing on the crust; I think they could stay True to their concept of pizza without letting it get overly soggy.",

    "text": "Settebello is one of those restaurants that you come to on weekday afternoon and find it filled with the Real Housewives of Summerlin. Pizza here is a fork and knife experience:  It's beautiful and impeccably decorated and full of cute (if I was 16, I'd say hot), young dudes. The space is filled with several booths and tables and a separate bar area. All of which are super comfy.  The menu is limited: there's pizza, salads, desserts, antipasti, and several wines. Pizzas range between $8-13.50 and are 12 inches. (Pro-tip: ask for it sliced, as this dish is served in traditional Napoli style).  My hot lunch date was my Gammy. She was pretty smitten with the boys & was flirting with them (and well received). You go, Gammy and you go, Glen Coco! We were promptly seated and our server was over in a jiffy. Drinks came the next second and pizza was ordered.  First and foremost, I am a simple pizza girl. I just like plain old cheese. I ordered the pizza with the Buffalo Mozzarella (I'm a sucker for it), basil, crushed tomatoes, some other cheeses, and oili. It was simple. The crust in the middle is very, very thin. Making oversized NYC foldable slices seem like reinforced bricks, hence the need for fork and knife. The dough was delicious. Crispy in the crust and gooey in the middle (not underdone bread gooey either). My Gammy got the Pizza Bolognese. It was so good, it smelt and tasted like spaghetti in pizza form. My Gammy was sad when she found out they didn't have any actual pasta dishes there. She loved the sauce and she's picky and a New Yorker.   Settebello has been on my list forever and I got to finally check it off and was not disappointed. Solid food, slightly inflated prices, lots of eye candy, and nice ambience. It's definitely a gem.",

    "text": "I'm so fancayyy, you already know.....  My husband heard good things about this place through co-workers and friends, so we decided to have lunch here one day before catching a movie next door. It was pretty quiet during a weekday, but there were a few people coming in to pick up their phone orders. Our server was very nice. We mentioned that it was our first time there and he explained the menu to us in detail, as well as what pizzas from Napoli were all about. We decided to share one pizza, but couldn't decide what to order. In my opinion, I feel like it's a bad sign when the menu is complicated and when I don't see anything appealing. Thankfully, our server tried his best to help us out. He asked us what kind of pizza we were looking for, and we replied, \"something with meat.\" I can't remember the name of the pizza (nor do I see it on their online menu), but he did suggest a cheese pizza made with meat sauce. He said that they don't have traditional pizzas like pepperoni or sausage. So we just went with his suggestion. We also ordered a salad and I believe it was called the Insalata. It was the simplest sounding one on the menu.  I must admit I am picky about my salads. The leafy greens that are used need to be dark green and fresh! Not light green with brown on the sides. That being said, they did use good quality greens! However, I didn't really like the vinaigrette on the salad, it tasted quite bland. I prefer my dressing to have at least some taste. Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed with the pizza either. Yes, the ingredients were fresh and hot, but the pizza was hard to eat. The main problem was that the crust was very thin and with every bite, the ingredients would just fall off. Kind of felt like I was just eating crust most of the time and it was pretty messy. Thankfully, ordering dessert was a great idea. The Tiramisu was delicious and not too sweet. The coffee flavor wasn't overpowering (or lacking) like how it was at other restaurants. I thought it was funny how they put \"contains raw egg\" in the description on the dessert menu. When we asked our server about that, he said \"Well, it starts off with raw egg, then it gets mixed with....\" Umm ok, so that means a lot of dishes start off with raw egg, right??  Anyway, now I can say I finally tried it, but was not impressed. Fancy pizzas are definitely not for me. I will happily stick to my boring Pepperoni Pizzas, thank you very much!",

    "text": "Feeling like pizza, I called in a order for pick-up. The girl who took my order was friendly and said my pizza would be ready in about 15 minutes. I headed over and upon walking in I was quickly greeted by the hostess who rang me up and asked if I needed any crushed red pepper or parmesan cheese added to my pizza box. I sat only for a couple minutes before my pizza was brought out. The inside looks very clean, but I was glad I placed my order for pick-up because it looked too trendy to be eating pizza in there. The hostess opened my pizza box and went over my order and asked if it was to my liking. It looked good!  Priced at $13.50 I had the \"Margherita DOC\" and the pizzas seem to come in one size here. It is more of a personal size pizza, but not super tiny. I was happy with it and couldn't finish the last 2 pieces. The pizza has crushed tomatoes, fresh buffalo mozzarella, basil, parmigiano reggiano and extra virgin olive oil. The crust was light and crispy, while the center of the pizza was softer. I had trouble picking up the pizza and eating it so I used a fork and knife which I don't mind. The crushed tomato sauce tasted sweet. I loved the amount of fresh mozzarella that was on it too! I'd like to try some of their other pizzas so I will be back. They also have some salads that sounds good!",

    "text": "Located inside the Village Square center, Settebello is divided into two sections, both of which are serving up delicious eats. On the right hand sand, you've got a standard dining area with booths and tables. On the left, you'll find additional seating including some high tops and a full bar. One of the coolest parts about the setup here is that everything is very open, so you'll be able to see the wood fire oven from just about anywhere you sit.  The menu itself is somewhat small. Aside from about a dozen pizza options, there's only a few other choices of salads, antipasti's and a couple meat trays. You're not going to find any pastas or sandwiches here but they've also got a decent wine list, a few cocktails and a handful of dessert options.  This was our first time here and were told the pizzas were personal size. However, at about 12\", it's a good size pie and for me, I'd only be able to finish the whole thing if I didn't eat anything else. As suggested by our waiter though, we ended up sharing a salad and pizza between the two of us. That was a perfect amount of food, while still having room for dessert. ;)  For the salad, we decided on the Romana. I'm not normally a huge salad eater but I couldn't get enough of this. It comes loaded with arugula, artichokes and speck, then it's topped off with a good amount of goat cheese, pines nuts and dressing. The flavor was just amazing! It's salty, it's a bit sweet and the textures perfect. Everything on the plate was incredibly fresh as well. Just a great salad all around that I'd highly recommend.  Moving on to the pizza, we ended up going with the Settebello to share. Want to talk about flavor? Talk about this pizza. It might seem like a lot going on when you look at all the ingredients but everything comes together so perfectly. The crushed tomato is great and their mozzarella is ridiculously tasty. And my new favorite pizza topping might just be pine nuts. Now, want to talk about crust? Yup, talk about this pizza. It's almost bread like in the center with a very soft, chewy texture but the outside is crispy and gets that awesome char from the wood fire grill. My one and only complaint about this pizza is the amount of toppings. There was a very small amount of sausage compared to the other ingredients and some slices even had no meat on them. Not a huge deal, but the could definitely be a bit less stingy with the meat.  They're dessert worthy too! While a bit on the overly sweet side for my liking, the Bella Mela is definitely worth a try. The combination of apples, cinnamon, almonds and mascarpone is so good, you'll probably ended up wanting to eat the whole thing alone, even if you are full from dinner.  So, when it comes to pizza, we all know there's no shortage of options here in Vegas. But if you want legit, Neapolitan pizza...Settebello is where it's at! Prices aren't bad and the service is excellent too. A solid 4 stars and a must try in my book!",

    "text": "Settebello, you let me down! There was one item that I had every intention of ordering and it wasn't there. That item was a budino, an Italian pudding-like dessert. It's simple, but when done right it'll make you wonder why you haven't had it sooner.  Of course, Settebello is know for their pizza rather than desserts so I had to try one. I opted for the self-titled pie the Settebello ($13.50) with crushed tomatoes, pancetta, wood oven sausage, roasted mushrooms, pine nuts, mozzarella, basil, and evoo. The interplay of savoriness and saltiness made for excellent flavors and the pine nuts added a crunchy texture that elevated the rest of the dish. My biggest complaint was the paper thin crust under the pie. I understand the Napoli-style makes for a wet pizza with a soft, pliable crust, but the lack of density beneath all the ingredients made it appear soupy. A good pizza for sure, but my personal preference is for a firmer crust.  Without the budino, I decided to try two desserts. First up was the Dream Bomba ($5), a dense ball of caramel surrounded by a creamy and smooth peanut butter gelato and coated in chocolate. It was cut into four wedges. A solid dessert for sure, and one that you'll want to share.  The second almost made me forget why I came here in the first place. The zeppole ($5.50) were soft, warm pillowy mini doughnuts of deliciousness filled with plenty of nutella. Coated with plenty of sugar, it's a sure-fire cure for any sweet tooth. If you're sharing with a kid, like I was, make sure you get extra napkins because most of the sugar and nutella ended up all over his face.  While not quite living up to the lofty expectations I had, Settebello is a great family-friendly dining option, especially if you're craving pizza Napoletana.",

A big group of 16 people had reservations for a private room. The moscato and the settlebello pizza were phenomenal!

    "text": "Slooow service at 1:30 with more employees than customers. The days old premade/frozen meatballs were still cold in the microwaved / oven reheated dish with a undersesoned tomato sauce & good quality melted cheese. Salad was bland & without seasoning or anyother veggies...a tasteless board of bacon wrapped without a hint of dressing & good goat cheese. Both pizzas were both burnt throughout the crust & spots underneath but also undercooked & doughy elsewhere. 60 bucks for this food is criminal & the waiter argues that the black isn't burnt. Wanted to cut off any piece of the black carcoal tasting portions & tell him to eat the friggen burnt charcoal ashy pizza & tell me with a straight face it's again isn't black & burnt. SMH....we will never return to this shameful place. I can & do produce much better food myself (so much for tying your place)...minus the extremely slow, ignorant & argumentative employee who is unaware of my years of quality food preparation experience. The waiter doesn't know his customer, but is well versed in excuses for customer disappointment. Your months long experience of slinging overpriced, tastless, undersesoned, burnt & undercooked food doesn't make you a food coneisuer nor a chef/cook.  Here's a tip...if you can't get the oven temperatures & or the dough recipe right so as not to both burn & undercooked your pizza.... close it down.  Likewise if you're charging premium prices don't serve friggen cold meatballs by reheating them in a microwave, so the cheese & sauce are super hot hot & the center of the meatballs are still ice cold. One more tip you can thank me for since your oven maybe your problem (which is a costly fix) if you failed to get it installed right in the first place....brush the crust with a butter or egg wash & it will not burn the dough & use cornmeal on the bottom (unless Ypu can get the temperature & recipe right). You're welcome & while your at it laminate the cheap, flimsy & strained cheap paper menu's....it's the first sign you're resturant is sub par... attempting to pass as an elite pizzeria. And don't microwave anything. Trash your microwave now & any cook/chef who uses it. It was embrassing to bring my family here...I hope your family experiences the same disappointing dinning experience next time you go out to eat at another restaurant. Karma is the word you should be reminded of in the event your experience is way below standard. Below standard & over priced is what you are serving the community. It's a joke what your resturant produces...regardless of the high prices you charge. Thanks neighbor!",

I'd mention where they're better but that's not right on a review for their restaurant. The pizza was some of the worst in town. This is what I don't get. Even my wife liked it which kind of annoyed me.  How can you like pizza where the crust is mushy. Maybe I'm just a pizza snob. But, atmosphere doesn't matter to me. I want a good slice of pizza. There are plenty of good pizza places around despite everyone saying that none are good. Unfortunately, this is not one of them.",

They should say something and tell you that before you order it.  The food is overpriced for what you get and the ingredients themselves including the crust and everything else is just a low quality compared to other restaurants that occupy this sort of sector / case in point would be due forni which smokes this place, you shouldn't even bother to go here,  worth it and I'll never come here again while duo forni is open, don't be fooled",

The decor  and the whole vibe was really cool.  Our server Juan was very friendly, personable and had good menu knowledge. We ordered a bottle on Kim Crawford which was yummy and started with a caprese salad. It was good but pretty basic. I would have like a bit more basil but I would definitely have it again and maybe ask for a bit of extra basil. We shared a margarita pizza. It was good. A bit doughy for a thin pizza. Too much crust but maybe that appeals to most Americans. But the dessert..... Was SOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD! The tiramisu was the best ive ever had!  They also had an espresso machine which we took advantage of!  We were able to have a full meal within an hour and fifteen minutes and were able to make our movie on time. I'll be back!",

We got a carbonarra which had 4 slices if pancetta and maybe 3 small leaves if basil on it, not enough for me.  The eggs are scrambled which really killed it for me.  The cheese was just a little light but not a problem.  We also had the mageritta DOC and 5 slivers of cheese is not enough for me on that either.  I like these pizzas a little thicker and more sauce so you can scoop it all up with the crust.  The dough was tasty and cooked very well.  Prices are right about par for a place like this.  I've had better wood fired pizza here locally and I do not go to pizza house for the decor.",

All I wanted to do was pick up my takeout; 2 pies and a salad. I gave my card to one girl who stood with my credit card 5 feet away from me complaining to another employee about a previous customer for 3 minutes while I watched her not running my card and not getting my food.   After finally handing over my food, I was asked if I wanted parmesan cheese and red peppers. You could have asked this before you went to get the food so you could have grabbed everything at once making my wait less but yes I do. Hot damn! Apparently those toppings are in short supply because I was given two packets of peppers and 1 ramekin of cheese that was so empty I could count the flakes. $39 bucks and I can't even have half a ramekin?  Okay, well the front of house sucked but how about those delicious pies I've been reading about?  I got home with our pizzas and salad and without saying a word to my wife she took a bite and said, \"these aren't cooked all the way.\" Sure weren't. I knew this because I had to sneak a piece on the way home (to test things out as any good husband would do) and had the luxury of eating cheese that wasn't quite melted.   On to the \"bread\" salad. There were two croutons in it. It was a sea of arugula.   Back of house fail.   Not sure what is going on with this place. It has all the elements of a good restaurant but the execution is way off. Whoever owns this place needs to step in quickly because the staff are not trained well and it shows.   With so many pizza options, don't waste your time or money here.",

    "text": "The new Settebello Pizzeria Napoleotana in Las Vegas is a well-designed, intimate restaurant with beautiful wood and brick furnishings.  It feels much more authentic than the Henderson location and we appreciate how closer it is for us to eat here since we live in Las Vegas.  When my girlfriend and I walked in at about 3:00pm on a Friday, it was completely empty so we got seated right away with the table/booth of our choice.  Originally, our decision to come to the new Settebello was because of the happy hour that they offered from 3pm-6pm, however, there were only a few items on the menu that catered to a real happy hour deal.  The beer/wine/cocktails were $2.00 off the original price as well as a \"Mini Bite\" selection that went for $5.00.  It wasn't a very good happy hour, but if you're ever planning to go here between 3pm-6pm, maybe you can take advantage of the happy hour menu and knock a few dollars off your bill.  For drinks, I originally ordered their Mirror Pond Pale Ale on draft but soon found out that their tap wasn't working for it.  Instead, the bartender recommended the Le Freak Imperial IPA by Green Flash and it was delicious.  I was impressed that our waitress went out of her way to ask for a similar beer.  As an appetizer, we started off with the Piatto Misto which was part of the $5 Mini Bite Menu for HH and consisted of various cheeses and meats served with toasted, warm focaccia bread.  It was good for the price.  For entrees, I asked what pizza was closest to a meat lovers and the waitress recommended the signature Settebello pizza.  My girlfriend ordered the Margherita D.O.C. pizza for her main meal.  Both our pizzas came out in a reasonable time (~15 minutes) and looked absolutely stunning.  The Margherita D.O.C. displayed what a pizza would look like in Naples and my Settebello order smelled delicious and was nothing short of authentic.  The crust on my pizza was perfect:  crisp on the edges while soft but still structured towards the center.  The toppings were outstanding and the amount was enough to fill me up.  I did get a chance to try the Margherita D.O.C. pizza and it was such a velvety, melt-in-your-mouth experience that I may have to get that the next time we visit this place.  Overall, the experience here at Settebello Pizzeria Napoletana was fantastic.  We have been to the other location in Henderson but the newly opened branch served as a much better experience for us.  The only reason I knocked off one star was because of the limited happy hour menu, but honestly, if I could rate this place a 4.5, I totally would.  From the interior to the service and all the way to our pizzas, Settebello at The Lakes can be seen as one of our new, favorite pizza places here in town.  Bill Breakdown: (with HH)  Beer:  $7 Settebello: $13 Margherita D.O.C.: $12 Piatta Misto:  $5  Total:  ~$50.00 w/ tip.",

The restaurant has a dim romantic vibe to it, which didn't really suit us that evening since we had our 4 year old.   I ordered a caprese salad that was delicious but nothing I couldn't make at home.   My bf got us an appetizer to share. It was delicious, but I had recently got my braces put on, so hard crusty bread was not my friend. I had a SMALL bite of it and from what I remember, it was delicious. I believe it had artichoke, prosciutto, and ricotta (?)  I forget all the toppings that his pizza included, but I DO remember that the center of each pizza (our son got a regular, kid-sized, cheese pizza) was soggy :( The sauce was delicious but a little too thin.   The service was quaint and I remember our waitress mixing the two juices that our son couldn't decide on together, which he thought was pretty neat.

We ordered tiramisu and Nutella pizza and 2 cappuccinos...when waiting a very large party can in and they sat next to us...not really a big deal but we did have to move our table down a little for comfort. Our waitress was given the big table as well as needed to finish ours. We were delivered our desserts but coffees were no were to be found and she kept going back to the big table to take orders while we clearly sat at our table ready to go.she finally dropped the check with no mention of the coffee....until My husband mentioned it to her. She was nice and apologized but said well they aren't on the bill so that's good...yeah I guess it is good. I just felt like our table was no longer important now that a table of 25 was there...my bill was still $100 and I still tipped her 20% so I feel I was important too.

It is not up to the server to decide that I shouldn't have dessert, and that is what I'm feeling here. Maybe I'm overly sensitive but dinner last night was the last straw. Eric, our waiter, seemed like he couldn't get us out the door fast enough. We had to ask for refills on our drinks and when we did he brought our check. No dessert and no more Settebello.

The staff was very nice, prompt and it seemed like they all knew what they were doing- except for their busser  or their food runner, who kept asking us if we were done with our dish, and try to take it away. But it was okay since we were enjoying everything.   The bartender made sure to bring our wines on time. The server was friendly till the end. Definitely a hidden gem in Vegas, that people seem to be missing out, since the whole restaurant was empty when we were there-and it was happy hour.",

I've almost tried every pizza and my top two are the emilia with added pine nuts and Bianca.  The donuts with Nutella and the Nutella pizza with added strawberries are both definitely hits!  The special thing about this place is the pizza Napoletana is soft and foldable.  I've seen other reviews and some think it's not fully cooked but the style is considered \"wet\". The char spots on the crust give you he flavor of the hot wood oven burning cooking style. It is best to experience this style in dine in however take out for us was just as satisfying.  Happy hour pizzas $5 each for a smaller version definitely a great deal. Happy hour 3-6 Monday - Friday.  Give this place a try... I'm craving it right now.",

Didn't check on us once and we had to ask the busser to order another round of drinks. I get you want to leave, but it's just plain rude.

We grabbed a couple chairs in the bar area before heading over to see a movie and made it in time for their happy hour which is from 3-6pm. We were a group of 12 women but we came in groups of four with 20 minute increments in between our arrivals.  We ordered a few personal pizzas, an artichoke crostini and a couple craft cocktails including a mint Collins, basil gimlet and Moscow mule that were each $5. They have a wide variety on their happy hour menu with lots of different choices.   Everything we drank and ate was awesome. The char on the pizza crust that they get from the wood fired oven was perfect. Chewy texture with a little crunch on their crust. The artichoke crostini had slices of prosciutto, large pieces of marinated artichoke and and ricotta. You can't beat the price on the craft cocktails either!   Service was incredibly slow, the waitress was overwhelmed when our group came in and never wrote anything down. She would then come back and ask what we ordered every time she took an order. At one point two girls spoke up and she snapped back, you both can't talk to me I can only handle one person at a time. She clearly needed help but no one else came to assist her. Next time write things down. One of my friends waited 20 minutes for a water! Cocktails and food all came at different times even when orders were given to her at the same time.   I'm giving it four stars instead of two or three because the food and drinks were good.",

I'm not a pizza person, and I went there thinking it was an \"Italian Restaurant.\"   From the exterior it's a very attractive restaurant. The interior decorations are as equally appealing.  I found the menu VERY hard to understand! I know I wasn't the only one in our party who felt that way.  The staff was fabulous! As our glasses became empty, they were quickly filled! The waitress was very informative, friendly and patient.  My main problem was that I don't like salad, expensive appetizers, or pizza... That's all they serve!   As far as the flavor of the food, it was good. But the consistency of the dough was horrible! It was equivalent to my first attempt at making a pizza, not very good!  Had they had some Pasta Options, Soup options, and a more understandable menu, they would've earned a better rating! The only reason they got a 2 instead of 1, was because the level of service!  I'll probably never return again!",

Ordered a Dogfishhead IPA ($3 off during HH), and each of the following dishes for a mere $5 each: bruschetta appetizer, warm beets \"snack\", and the Margherita and Vico mini pizzas. For $25 before tip, this was a filling but light early dinner.  The apps were delish: bruschetta is my BF's favorite, and here the crostini is topped with bacon and there's a side of pesto for extra flavor, too. The warm beets were divine and flavorful, served in a mini cast-iron dish and topped with peanuts.   The mini pizzas weren't that mini- don't know the size compares with their usual since this was our first visit, but server let us know that the usual pizzas are 12\" and intended to be an individual size due to the thinness of the crust style. Ordering two mini pizzas (maybe 8\"?) was enough for us to share without feeling like we were going to explode afterward.  Margherita style was my favorite, as the classic tomato-and-cheese combo is just what I naturally crave when I think of pizza, and I love the complementary flavors of fresh basil. BF preferred the Vico, with sausage, fennel, mozzarella, moscarpone, and red onions- quality ingredients and good depth of flavor. While he liked this topping combination better, my dude simply didn't love the thin, wet crust style served here and it may be tricky to get him back in.  Will be coming back soon to try the Moscow Mule cocktail and the Emilia pizza- possibly on my own!",

They might not have been the best pizza around, but for $5, they were just fine! The bartender (I forgot his name) was awesome. He was very engaging and our food came out right away. Actually, I can't believe those pizzas came out that quickly. I'm almost afraid to ask. Ignorance is bliss.  There is plenty of seating everywhere. Lots of tables and space.

I was really pleased with the goat cheese crema as it was a modest amount and didn't dare overpower the beautiful beets. The almonds were a nice touch!  Polpette Napoletane ($14): Neapolitan beef and pork meatballs, covered in Neapolitan tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil. The meatballs were simple and just loaded with meat and practically no filler. It's served with buttered toast that's been tossed into the oven as well; delicious.  Margherita DOC ($14): Crushed tomato, mozzarella di bufala, parmigiano, and basil. This is one of my all-time favorite pizza styles and this is definitely one I'd want again. The dough and all the components created a solid Napoletana pizza. They also have a non-DOC option without buffalo mozzarella for $12.  Pizza Carbonara ($13): Crushed tomato, panchetta, egg, cracked pepper, parmigiano, mozzarella, basil, and olive oil. All of their pizzas start the same way, so it's the same great crust/dough. My disappointment with this pizza was the scarcity of toppings and the cooked yolk - that's definitely not what I was expecting. Since this is atypical for Carbonara, I think it should be disclosed on the menu or as you order.  The restaurant is beautiful and the vibe is classy yet casual. I love that everything cooked is thrown into the blistering-hot brick oven. I also like the non-pizza offerings and look forward to trying several of those as well. There is a happy hour during the week (M-Th 3-6PM, 8-9PM & F 3-6PM, 8:30-10PM) with most selections at $5/each.",

    "text": "I've been meaning to try this place for a while and what better time than pi day, 3/14/16, to have a pizza pie :) We came around 8pm which was during happy hour but the space was pretty empty. I would give my dining experience 5 stars for service and 3.5 for food. We ordered strictly from the happy hour menu:  We started with the arancini (friend risotto balls) and the artichoke crostini. I did not like the arancini. Whenever I see this on the menu, I typically order it. Settebello's version did not have enough flavor in the risotto. Instead, the predominant taste was that of the deep fried outside. However, I really LOVED the tomato sauce it was served with. It was super tasty and fresh. I liked the artichoke crostini much better than the arancini. It had good flavor; of course I think anything with goat cheese does. I think it could have used more balsamic reduction than just the garnish.  Next we decided on the Dia Vola and the Vico pizzas. The Dia Vola was spicy, but almost so much so that I didn't really taste much else (I do have a pretty high tolerance for spice). It was still good though and I love the crust of Neapolitan style pizza in general; it was perfectly foldable. *Side note: I believe they are VPN certified which means they conform to standards that make this legit Neapolitan pizza. A VPN certification is rare and they are the only ones in Las Vegas that can boast of it.*  I enjoyed the Vico pizza much more. We ordered this for my boyfriend because he loves white pizza but I enjoyed the flavors too as they all nicely complemented each other. Again, it was good but it wasn't anything amazing.  Lastly, we ordered the house made crostata ricotta e Nutella for dessert. It was delicious! I wish it wasn't drizzled with Nutella because the flavor on its own was wonderful. It was just slightly sweet. Would definitely order this again.  Overall, we had an enjoyable dinner and were able to order 5 dishes and a Peroni for just $30. Great happy hour prices! We left very full and we were super hungry to begin with because we had just come from the gym. Additionally, the service was excellent. Our server was Bethanie and she was very sweet, attentive, and quick. Our hostess was also a doll. Thank you ladies for taking pride in your work and making our experience so enjoyable.  I think the next time I visit Settebello will be at the Henderson location. Yelpers rave about that location so I purposely came to the Summerlin location first to give them a fair review. Additionally, I wouldn't order the same pizzas again as I wasn't wowed by either of them.",

No complaints at all about the requests for multiple tabs(kids sports team event) and all the food came out fast and hot. The server, without being asked, inquired about food allergies(gluten and nut) and had alternatives ready  It was my first time at a Settobello and I am excited to know there is one close to my home in Orange County. The 'style' of pizza was perfect, the dough was incredible, and the side salads and meatballs were great too. Also, a very good bar with a great selection of beers on draft and bottle.   Final observation, the build-out was modern, comfortable and clean without feeling 'stuffy'..",

I checked out this out this past wknd and was pleasantly surprised! It was pretty close to my favorite spot in Naples! It was as close to Napoli pizza as you can get in Vegas! Try it if you like that type of pizza! It's definitely not your typical NY slice. Will eat here again. FYI the soggy crust everyone is complaining about is how the real pizza is done in Italy, and it's fantastic! Remember this isn't NY style ! If you want crispy crust go to Grimaldi's !!",

This was our first visit to this location and my rating is probably closer to 3 1/2 stars, but I didn't think our experience was worth 4 stars.   We were seated quickly and ordered the meatballs and capricciosa pizza. The meatballs were just ok, a little bland without the sauce, but the bread that accompanied it was good. In theory I liked all of the ingredients in the pizza - artichoke, prosciutto, olives, mushrooms, mozzarella, basil. What's not to like? But together, it didn't really work. I think if they used black olives instead of kalamata and chopped the artichoke hearts a bit smaller (instead of huge chunks), and added more mushrooms and prosciutto, it would've been 10 times better. I do like the thin crust and cooking it in a wood fired oven gives it a rustic flavor.  Service was decent, not great, not terrible. We probably won't be going back anytime soon though :/",

    "text": "I know I will probably get some heat from my fellow Yelpers for this review, but this was honestly one of the worst meals I have had and I literally had to pull in to the Taco Bell after I left this place to get something to eat because I was so hungry.  I went here last night with high hopes. I was in a party of 4 total. We sat in the back room which was kind of like having our own private room, so that was a nice perk. In my party of 4 we did order drinks. The waitress was nice but had no idea about the scotches on the menu and had a really hard time taking this order. She had to go to the bar and bring out 3 or 4 bottles so she could remember what she was doing. We ended up ordering 2 double shots of 2 different kinds of Scotch, 3 beers and a glass of wine.  For the appetizer we shared the Arancini. It only came with 2 so each person got like 2 bites. These were absolutely flavorless and the inside was pure mush. The only thing that was in tact was the frozen peas that were barely warm. I should mention that there was a hint of red pepper after taste.  The waitress suggested that we order 2 salads, each couple could share. Great- the first couple ordered the Insalata Grande: Mixed Greens, Fresh Tomatoes, Artichoke Hearts, Roasted Mushrooms, Olives, Pine Nuts, Cracked Pepper, Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano, Balsamic Vinaigrette. The second couple ordered the Beet Salad, which had a ton of arugula. few beets, tablespoon of goat cheese and no dressing. he first couple seemed to like the salad just fine. Our salad was not good, it was like eating dried grass without dressing.  Before we could even finish our salads, they brought out our pizzas. What??? You couldn't even wait until we finished. Your restaurant was totally dead on a Saturday night. It's not like you needed the table. Why the rush?  Back to the pizzas. We each order our own because the waitress said they were very small and we could all eat a whole one. We ordered 2 Margherita DOC: Crushed Tomatoes, Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, Parmigiano Reggiano, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 1 Vico (No Crushed Tomatoes): Wood Oven Sausage, Sauteed Fennel, Red Onions, Mascarpone, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil and 1 with salami and cheese (they do not have pepperoni here and will give you salami if you order it).  Everyone started to dig in on the pizzas and all looked at each other like what the hell is this? The first couple were so hungry that they went ahead and ate theirs. The BF hesitated to eat his and I could no way eat another bite. This was the worst COLD pizza I have ever had. We waited for the waitress that did not come back for a while. The BF was so hungry he decided to go ahead and eat his but did not like it at all.   When the waitress finally showed back up I told her this was the most flavorless, disgusting cold pizza I have ever had. It also looked liked someone had poured a cup of water in the middle of it. The waitress informed me that  Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella is a watery cheese. LOL!! Oh and let me also say that all of the pizzas were burned (like charred black on the bottom). Yes--I know these are cooked in a brick oven but burnt is burnt people. So as I am telling the waitress how much I hated this pizza, she is making up a to go box. I am trying to hand her my pizza to get rid of it and she asked me if I would like to take it home. WHAT?? Did you even listen to what I just said? WAKE UP!!  No I don't want this nasty pizza now and I certainly am not going to want it at home.  She took it away and when she walked in to the kitchen she must have said something because everyone that was standing back there all turned around at once staring at me. RUDE!! She came back a few minutes later and said the manager was at the store but would take it off my check when he returned. I was surprised that the manager never came to my table to apologize or offer me something else.   So our check came and it was $166. Wow--that is outrageous for the quality of food we were just served. I have no problem paying for meals that are good and worth it. This was just plain gross. If the other people in our group weren't starving, they would have also sent back their pizzas.  Yes I am aware that this is a VPN certified restaurant. Just because you have the certificate does not mean you have good pizza. It is basically a marketing tool. For those that don't know the definition of VPN, it is as follows:  \"VPN\" is a designation given to qualifying pizzerias by the Naples-based Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana or its delegates  To qualify you must:     Make its pies with only certain types of ingredients     Use only approved equipment     Adhere to traditional pizza-making methods  There are parameters on: Oven temperature  How long the pizza is allowed to cook  What size and shape the final product should be  Final note is that I have spent many many months in Italy (all over). I am well aware of how this food should taste.",

    "text": "Came in to try out their happy hour. They have two times 3-6 and 830-close.   The table ordered Moscow mules ($5), arancini ($5), Diavola pizzette ($5), Vico pizzette ($5), and a Emilia pizzette ($5). This was a great way to try out the different pizzas they had to offer.   There were two arancini that came with the order. The crust was delightfully crunchy and crisp which complimented the fluffy filling and tangy marinara sauce. (4/5)  The diavola pizzette was topped with crushed tomatoes, peppered salame, roasted red bell pepper, crush red pepper, garlic, mozz, and some evoo. Unfortunately with the amount of toppings, the dough of the pizza soaked it all in and became a mush when I bit into the slice. It was more of a salad with a charred crust. (2/5)  My favorite from the pizzette as was the Vico. Toppings on the Vico included sausage, red onion, mascarpone, basil, mozz, evoo, and roasted fennel. The pizza managed to stay in one piece when picked up unlike the diavola. The texture was awesome with the creaminess of the mascarpone mixed with the succulent sausage and the crunch of the roasted fennel. I would come back for this pizza! (4.5/5)  Lastly, the Emilia pizzette had prosciutto cotto, Italian cream, mozz, evoo, parmigiana reggiona, and corn. This was a very savory and creamy pizza. It lacked acids to balance the flavor and had me taking sips of the Moscow mule to cut the richness. (3/5)   Although I can't say this place is my definite go to for pizza in the neighborhood, their Vico pizza will have me coming back...for happy hour!",

    "text": "I had never heard of Settebello Pizzeria until my daughter went there on a date. She told me how good it was and that I needed to try it. She had a special birthday coming up, so we decided to throw her a surprise party at this location. The decor is really chic and cool. I love the big wood tables!  We went ahead and booked in advance and they have a private room you can use, however, it only holds roughly 15 people. We had a party of about 20 people so they took four tables and set up in a big square. Needless to say my daughter was surprised when we walked in and all her friends were sitting there.  I was approached right away by our young server who was very nice and conscientious about making sure everything ran smooth. We started out with some insalata which had a delicious balsalmic dressing followed by several Margherita DOC pizza's. All of the pizza's are wood fired with a thin crust. They range in price from about $9 - $14. Each pizza has eight slices and they come out of the oven piping hot which is how most people prefer their pizza. All of the ingredients are flown in from Italy including the tomatoes which if you have never been to Italy, the tomatoes are super juicy!! In addition, they feature a potato gnocchi which is one of the reasons that I will return is to try it. In addition, they have a full service bar for drinks. At the end of the meal they brought my daughter a dessert pizza for her birthday. It was the \"Nutella Pizza\" and it was really on the mark! The overall price for the party including salad, pizzas, wine was very reasonable and well worth it.  We all really enjoyed the food and the service was terrific. My advice to you is to plan on eating there instead of  \"to go\" since the pizza is made to order. I plan to return very soon and give the gnocchi a shot!",

If you're not into something a little bit different and just want your NY Pie or Chicago deep dish....you need to go across the street. But if you want to get full and eat a delicious Napoletana Pizza...this is your spot.   I usually order the Emilia. Italian Creme instead of the tomotoe sauce...prosciutto, cotto, mozarella, that fresh basil....mmm I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!   If I'm in the mood for red sauce...I'll order the Settebello,   This is the closest you'll get to tasting real italian pizza...and it's a lot cheaper than airfare. So thankful the summerlin Settebello opened. Now my family doesn't have to travel all the way to the Green Valley District for a taste of Italy.",

We were shown to the private room that was a bit tight for our group but luckily we all enjoy each other's company and didn't mind the closeness. The chairs were put together with no space between, so anyone with a big party BEWARE. The food was all delicious, they kept our drinks filled and sold us on dessert. Of everything, the risotto balls were the best appetizer, we didn't have a single bad pizza but the Blanca special was very delicious, and you can never go wrong with Nutella pizza for dessert. Skip the custard doughnuts.",

    "text": "This Settebello location is absolutely impressive when it comes to the interior. Maybe it just hit me because it was new and I didn't expect a pizza joint to be so nicely decorated. Would recommend for a nice low-key date night with a movie theater just steps away.   Their pizzas  come in one size, which I approximate around 10-12 inches round. Perfect for sharing between two people or feeding a very hungry individual. The Pizza Napoletana dough is softer than your average pizza and is meant to be eaten with a knife and fork. The pizza is cooked in a wood-fired oven and I would liken it to a thicker version of Indian naan bread. Wonderful texture, in my opinion. Ordered the Vico pizza  with sausage, fennel, red onions, mascarpone, mozzarella, and basil. The sausage was nicely seasoned and all the ingredients complemented each other well.  I made sure to save room for dessert which I think were called Bombolinis. Bombolinis, beignets, donuts, whatever... I love!",

So after burning what I tell myself must have been AT LEAST a million and a half calories in the Rock 'n' Roll, I told my parentals that it was critical we get pizza. Serious. Crucial. Muy importante.   We rolled in to the new location of Settebello and the place is an Instagrammer's dream. It has a very refined, elegant feel to it that does not exude \"pizzeria\" in the slightest bit. Tons of #nofilter #woodwork #crafty #ilovepizza #canyoubelievethisisapizzaplace #noireallycant going on.   La noche began with fried risotto, which were ravioli-like envelopes of breaded risotto, and a beet salad with creamy goat cheese and nuts. I think the risotto could have stood on its own without making a detour to the fryer, but the salad was a fresh complement to the pizza.   The Family K opted for the Vico (sausage, fennel, onions, mascarpone, mozzarella, basil, olive oil) and Capriccioso (all vegetables - don't even bother if you're a carnivore), and the final tally had Vico in the lead. We were advised in advance that the thin-crust pizzas come out slightly charred, but the crust on our Capriccioso was just burnt, which is why it was Michelle Kwan that night and not Tara Lipinski. We learned that night that crushed tomato is OKAYYY but we don't love it. Since Settebello has so many options without crushed tomatoes though, I'm sure we will be back again sometime to peruse the other items on the menu.   #nexttimeiwonthavejustrunahalfmarathonthoughughhh",

    "text": "Ambiance: A Food:        A Service:    D-  If you are looking for one tasty pizza Settobello just may be your place.  I dined here for the second time this past weekend and once again, while the food was superb the service is UTTERLY LACKING (which can ruin an otherwise great mean in my book.)  Myself and five friends gathered for a post-New Year's dinner.  We gave the server our entire order and our waters and iced teas made their way to the table.  About this time the fire alarm went off... and continued to go off.  Finally they asked everyone inside the restaurant to wait outside while they investigated further (kudos to them... I loved that they took this seriously and put guest safety first.)  After about 15 minutes out in the cold Las Vegas night we were allowed to come back inside.  The server came back to the table and basically said, \"I can't find your order and will need to put it back into the computer.\"  Umm, okay, no big deal.  Though we found it strange that no one ever came by to address the fire alarm or simply say \"thanks so much for waiting outside, we know it's cold and really appreciate it\" or \"hey, it was a False alarm, fire department came and checked everything out... thanks for waiting.\"  No, it was simply business as usual without one word about the incident.  A few minutes 5 of us receive our food... the 6th persons order is lost.  Again, no big deal since we have ordered a ton of food and we all prefer family style anyway.  About a quarter of the way through our meal one of the servers is trying to stock the shelf LOCATED ABOUT 2 INCHES from three of my friends (on the opposite side of the table) and continually asks my friends to please move so she can complete her side-work.  This is where they completely lose me.  Here we are, trying to enjoy our meal and we are being asked to constantly move/stand-up/shuffle our chairs so the server can complete her re-stocking of pizza boxes behind us???  We then ask for refills on all six of our drinks since NO ONE has re-addressed this since we originally sat down - and what really infuriated me the most about this particular incident is that there were SIX employees standing at the POS terminal chatting to one another!  I'm sorry, but as a manager I'm like HELL NO!  Either get to work or go home!!    In the end we paid our bill and gave 20% tip because our original server was somewhat decent.  But we did ask to speak to the General Manager about the evening.  A lady greeted us a few minutes later... we told our story and she said \"I completely understand and I would feel the same way, but I'm just the bar manager......\"  In a nutshell, Settebello PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE focus on training and management of your employees.  You serve a fantastic pizza but this was my second experience at your restaurant and both times the service has really let me down (the first time wasn't much better but I was willing to give a second try.)",

    "text": "After hearing good things about the place, my friend and I went on a Monday night to try out their handcrafted pizzas. The interior is very beautiful for a pizza place, I like that you can see the pizza oven in the back of the restaurant. When we walked in, there was no one to greet/seat us, even though the restaurant was barely half full. We stood there for a few minutes before a server acknowledged us and yelled to a girl standing by the pizza oven chatting to the cook. That's when I realized she was suppose to be the hostess, but she obviously thought talking to the cook was more important. Moments before, a large group had entered the restaurant and stood behind us, and the hostess ignored me and my friend and immediately spoke to the guy behind me and asked if they had a reservation. Perhaps she thought we were all one party, but I thought that was pretty rude of her not to ask.   When we were finally seated, we were unable to get menus right away because they had run out. How do you run out of menus on a Monday night when it's not busy? I'm sure the Office Depot down the street can make color copies at $0.25 each...  Aside from that, our pizzas were pretty good. I'm not a big fan of pizzas, but I love the crispiness of the crust and how you can taste the freshness of the ingredients. I had the Vico, which was basically a white pizza with no tomatoes, and it was surprisingly very filling despite it being a very thin-crust pizza.  Long story short - good food, subpar service.",

After ordering, walked down to Rocket Fizz to pick-up a few \"artisan\" sodas.  Returned just in time to pick up pizza and go my way.  I felt the pizza was undercooked - very slight charring on the top of the pizza crust,  The mozzarella was not melted, a boatload of pine nuts, yet very light on mushroom..  Still, the flavors were there - especially liked the sausage and the pancetta.  I'm hoping this is simply a \" working out the kinks\" situation yet I wonder since at the time I entered the restaurant, I only saw 3 customers - what happens when there are 30 customers ???

At first it seemed it would be difficult to bring home, because of it's style.  In actuality, it heats up beautifully, and if you'd like it crisp you just put in in your oven or convection right on the rack.  You will be craving these pizzas once you try them.",

I used to live in Italy and I do not remember the basil on the pizza ever being burnt to a crisp, which creates a bad taste. I believe in Italy, they put the basil on after the pizza comes out of the oven.  Wish this place would focus on creating a better basic Italian napoletano  style pizza which is a high art form when executed correctly.",

My grandmother was from Napoli and she would have approved of this place I'm sure of it. I've been to Napoli myself, and although there is NOTHING like the actual real deal, I must say, they come close...eh on a good day. I have never had a bad experience, but their service is kind of wack ya know?!       I remember the first time I went in there when it first opened. I was so excited! Finally a napoletan pizza place conveniently located! Anyway, I was asking some of the staff a few questions about some italian liquors and if they use mozzerella di buffala, and no one knew what I was talking about. So that kind of killed my excitement. All and all the food is good. I love the Margarita or that Diovala  pizza. The Capri pizza is pretty good too, and I love the Misto (meats and cheeses). I suggest eating it there. I picked it up today, and its not as good as it is freshly made. I kinda hate to say Due Forni on town center drive is better. I will stick to that place after tonight. At least there, they are well versed and appreciate the love and culture of a True 'taliano.",

We have been going there since it opened and first they stopped serving sangria Italiano. Sangria is a definite must have! Then they keep changing the Misto! It use to have a great roasted zucchini and Kalamata type olive's along with the selection of meats, then a changed to an awful green olives,  now they have a awful fried eggplant and fried zucchini. Who wants more grease with the fats from the meat? The fresh selections were a much better choice! Service has been slipping a bit also..",

The crust is that perfect uneven crispiness on the outside and moist and chewy on the inside.  The tomato sauce on Settebello's pizza was particularly delicious and we loved the mozzarella di bufala on the pizza.  We also loved the $27/bottle Banfi cabernet/san giovese bottle of wine.  The atmosphere is fun and attractive.  Our waitress was delightful and helpful.  You can't go wrong here.  It's delicious.",

They have this amazing non alcohol ginger beer and it is so yummy. I had a coast land blond on tap beer also great. I don't think I would go back very often for this pizza :( sadly the crust is too soggy. Great customer service!!!!!!!
