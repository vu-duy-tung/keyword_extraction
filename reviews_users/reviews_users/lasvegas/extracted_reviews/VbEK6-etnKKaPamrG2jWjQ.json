The menu has a lot of different options and it seems like you can add items to your hotdog also.  They also serve crinkle fries too, I can't remember the last time I had those.  All in all this place satisfied the fast, cheap and good requirements.",

It's not a served restaurant, so you order at the counter and pick up at the counter. What am I paying $40 for? My boyfriend and I split the fries, he had the dog, I had the burger. All just mediocre. Nothing to rave about and nothing fancy about the dog, service or price. There was nothing horrible so I give it 2 stars.",

Anyway, I thought these dogs were pretty delicious!  Between 3 of us, we had 5 dogs:  The plain Jane- pretty basic dog, relish & mustard (and onion if you like) The Polish - with swiss and sauerkraut and even corned beef! The DC half smoke- another polish, but with chili and onions. The empire state dog- red sauce onions & mustard And of course the Windy City- do I need to explain? We also had some poutine fries and cheese fries. Everything was freakin' great!! Yeah a tad high priced, but that is expected in this location. I would be giving 5 stars, but the service majorly lacked. A bit confusing and small, so a little help would have been the cherry on top.  If you are in the mood for a hot dog, this is a solid option on the strip, with plenty of people watching nearby.",

Going back to the Tijuana dog it has dilled jalapenos instead of fried ones if you know street dogs you know everything is grilled together! Our bill was  $35.26 and they didn't provided free water cups so be ready to pay $3.25 for water! honestly save yourself the stress and go to in n out just a couple of steps more lol",

My, now, fiancee showed me this place on line before leaving for the trip and had to try it just to appease her.  Turns out I would be eating her almost twice a day and almost everyday.  Mostly cause the Fun Ghi Dog was the heavenly.  I took a couple of my friends down here for a late night dinner/snack and found the Poutine to be bangin as hell...we weren't that drunk yet btw.  One of them mentioned that the burger was better than not good, so I guess decent.    My last day, I decided to give the Tijuana Dog a shot.  Beef Frank wrapped in bacon and deep fried, topped off with jalapenos and something else I couldn't remember...IT WAS ALSO THE BEES KNEES.  Unfortunately, I splurged on their $1 shrimp cocktail.  Don't expect much, but hey try it..it's just a buck.  For location and time of day that they are open, this place is where I'll be taking my fiancee for when I go back for work next month.",

Then...I tasted my haute hot dog treat. And there's not enough stars to go around.  I got the Windy City dog. With its celery salt, neon green relish, perfect size and mouth warming goodness, it was EVERYTHING. I went to Berkeley (go bears!) and coming here was like coming home to Top Dog.

I know you all are waiting for it... but it was just A-OK. The billionaire dog consists of FOIE GRAS, which is the reason why my EYES LIT UP, a kobe beef dog (which was actually pretty good, but I wish the dog was a DOG though!), and some type of jelly. It was good, but it DIDN'T HIT THE SPOT.   I know I am not the hot dog expert, but I do know what I like. I hope in the future, I give them another chance, and they SURPRISE ME!",

I went on the first day of the partial opening of the Linq and to be expected not many people were there (actually no one except for my group and the workers). Its located right outside of O'Sheas and right next door to Purple Zebra.   The menu (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hautedoggerylv.com%2Fmenus%2Fmenu%2F&s=7c6ddfa88fccedb643583f908a49278724c8d2499c10c07ef8097f9534651c50\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">hautedoggerylv.com/menus...</a>)  If you dined at any of the other Block 16 Hospitality restaurants (Public House, Barrymore, Holsteins, LBS, and Pink's) then you'll see a lot of similar ingredients and similar flavors, especially with Holstein's, a lot of their offerings have the same name. The El Machete was the only hot dog I tried. How was it? It was good, super clean tasting frank but it wasn't $8 good. Man I'm definitely a sucker or perhaps money is burning a hole in my pocket to be spending $8 on a hot dog. I definitely felt like I was eating that strip up charge. Of course in True Vegas fashion there must be something \"VEGAS\", and that is the Billionaire Dog (grilled Kobe beef frank, Foie Gras torchon, port onion marmalade and truffle mayo). Get em tourist!  Next time? Nah... probably not.",

Chili and cheese taste like they come out of a can and develop a dry/plastic film on top if not eaten right away- like within 5 minutes.  Even if you can tolerate the cheap tasting but expensive food - their customer service is horrible. Their staff don't smile or offer assistance with the menu - they just answer yes or no with blank faces. The general manager is rude and condescending. She threatened me with security and scolded me- even comparing me to a child for \"giggling and smiling\" when my companion had made a noise with his plastic cup on the table. She proceeded to say it occurred 3 times and we COULD HAVE POSSIBLY  have been damaging her tables/ property. She only made the rude condescending threats to me when my food was ready - which makes me question if she was really concerned or just a mean person with personal problem with 2 young people being able to go on vacation while she was stuck at work. Nonetheless it was water spilled on a table that made a noise when the plastic cup slid over it. She claims to be the general manager but has obviously no training in customer relations or customer retention . Don't waste your money here - GO TO IN N OUT. In N out has great food & great customer service for 1/3 of the cost.",

Around $6 after taxes for a measly 10 maybe 12oz beer, not worth!  The store itself was cute though. Cute paintings on the door and the ceiling is an American Flag made out of license plates. It's eye catching, least to say.   I don't think I'd be stopping here again unless I just need something quick.   Do not get the shrimp cocktail, it was gross. Smallest shrimps you can think of and it just didn't taste right. No wonder it's a dollar.",

I have tried 5 different types of dogs here and each of them were delicious! I also like that you can get free French fries if you redeem through yelp. Yummy fries!! Only setbacks are the space is small and cramped and the music is too loud. Also our cashier seemed out of it and confused... maybe she enjoyed some time on the Vegas strip before her shift started? It was a little concerning",

After waiting 17 minutes for a burger that was supposed to be ready in \"about 10 minutes\", I thought I was going to enjoy a latter-day Vegas delicacy.  Nope.   The flavor was decent enough, but why was the patty broken? I wouldn't serve a broken patty off my grill at a backyard barbecue, but not everyone takes as much pride in wanting to serve their guests the best. A pre-broken burger is annoying and flat-out rude.   The fries were good enough to save them from a 1-star rating, but just so we're clear, I'm in a really generous mood tonight.   The prices are high, but you have to expect airport prices on the Strip. A burger, fries, and 3 drinks came to $28. The real issue was the wait time. The wait was extraordinary, well beyond a reasonable amount. It simply was not worth it. This place is way too slow for me to be willing to give it another chance. The staff were all polite (and slow) and I just don't have the time to risk being disappointed again.",

Has a diner/soda joint kind of interior decorating sense to it.  Prices seemed fairly reasonable for the strip, especially since it's a step above the usual fast food chains but you don't have to sit down. Staff is very friendly but service is slowwwwwww.  The pricing doesn't really make sense for the burgers - they're all about the same price (~$11) even though they come with vastly different amounts of stuff on them.   I got the southern smokehouse burger which comes with double meat - beef brisket and a fat, flavorless and rather soggy patty. Despite having SO much stuff on it (BBQ sauce, hot sauce, cheese) it still managed to be rather flavorless. The portion was huge but with how underwhelming it was, definitely felt a little much.   Fries are the crinkled variety. The poutine was extremely underwhelming.",

I'm not really a huge hot dog fan, but my friends wanted to eat here so I decided to give it a try. While they do have some really unique hot dog concoctions, I couldn't bring myself to try them because some just didn't sound that great to me. I kept it simple and ordered a plain hot dog with chili and one with sauerkraut. I definitely would've been fine with one, but wasn't sure how big they were and ordered 2.   While they were good, they definitely weren't the best hot dogs I've ever had. The actual hot dogs themselves were a little too salty for me. The chili was good, but nothing spectacular. The sauerkraut also didn't taste homemade, so again just a run of the mill hot dog.  My friend ordered the poutine and that was very good! I'd say a must-order item.  The staff was also super friendly and they kept the line moving quickly.  Overall, wouldn't say this is a place you HAVE to try, but it is a quick, easy meal.",

Looking at the menu, the Rising Sun hot dog and poutine fries stood out as some of the more unique, interesting, and tasty options so I went with these.  But from there it went downhill . . . I waited almost 20. minutes. for these stupid choices. The three lazy employees were chatting away, laughing, not giving a care in the world, moving as slow as they could.   The rising sun dog stated it had a grilled kobe beef dog, topped with crispy yams, nori, teriyaki glaze, spicy mayo, and a tempura avocado. The only things they got right were the yams and tempura avocado. The hot dog was not grilled. Obviously not a kobe beef dog but still tasted worse than a normal hot dog. No teriyaki glaze. No spicy mayo. No nori. The \"crispy yams\" were burnt. The tempura avocado was gross and over fried. Terrible hot dog.  Now for the poutine . . . first off, it was cold. The fries were soggy, and undercooked, gravy was clearly powdered, and there were maybe 3 cheese curds?  $15 down the drain. such a disgrace",

I went back more than a couple times. I loathe skinny oily over salted fries, so was glad to see they had crinkle cut fries that were neither oily nor over salted.  CONS: you pay $1.00 for the cheddar cheese and $1.00 for the pickles. It is too pricey for what you get, but a good price for the Vegas strip where everything is overpriced.",

I have never been to this place before and was very excited to go! I walked in and looked at the menu for a couple of minutes and instantly wanted to buy everything...it all looked so good. I ordered and when I went to pay I attempted to use a Visa gift card I had received for my birthday and the woman behind the register proceeded to tell me how she couldn't take it since it didn't have a name on it. I did explain it was a gift card and was accepted anywhere Visa was accepted. She just looked at me with a \"meh\" attitude and said they couldn't take it because of fraud issues. Oh, okay. I'll just take my business elsewhere since I am such a liability to your company.   I didn't mind paying with my debit card, my credit card, or even cash, but I felt it was very rude the way she handled it. I certainly hope the food wasn't that great, because I have no plans of returning. I am huge fan of good service and good food. You can offer a great product, but when your service is anything less than average, I will just go somewhere else.",

Very small place, mostly real crowded, but staff is fast, helpful. I recommend this place to all of my friends and whenever I am back here, I deginitely stop to eat my hotdog and french fries. Also chipotle ranch souce was quite delicious.",

I had a dressed-up Polish sausage (after having been up-sold) with pastrami and other fix-ins that was pretty good, but my family had other items that they described only as okay. - Good location right off the strip.  Cons: - Very expensive for what it is. Three people eating cost almost $30. For hot dogs, even fancier ones, that is too much. - THEY DO NOT SERVE TAP WATER! You have to pay for a bottle of water. Any place that does not offer paying customers a small drink of water automatically fails in my books (I think this actually happens a lot on the LV Strip).  Overall: OK fare, but be prepared to pay a lot, and don't count on free water!",

The polish sausage was OK-you can find much better polish sausages at any grocery store. The Kobe dog was very good-juicy and flavorful. Everything else about the dog tasted like food-service quality buns, chili, and shredded cheddar cheese. Nothing special there.   Overall it's a good place for lunch or if you've been drinking (it is located on the Vegas strip). A big critique is that two hot dogs and a drink costs about $20. Although it is located on the strip (tourist prices), you can certainly find much better places to eat for $20, even on the strip.   My biggest critique is actually the menu. When you walk in the menu is located almost near the ceiling, so everyone is straining their neck to look at it. There's way too many types of hot dogs, each one  coming with a different type of meat for starters. There's Kobe dogs, grilled franks, polish sausage, steamed franks, etc. Then they all have catchy names, and the menu is divided into two sections of hot dogs. It's too much, too confusing. They should keep the menu simpler and make it easier to actually look at.    Now that I've tried it I wouldn't go back unless I was walking the strip with friends in the evening and wanted a quick snack to go with my beers.",

Don't get me started on the girl with bad attitude who likes to give you a dirty look every time she walked by and for no reason. When my girlfriend went to ask for a side of relish, she charged us .50, and this after we just handed her $35 for three dogs, a fries, and 1 Coke. Don't bother going.  The dog is loaded with toppings and looks great, but the dog is skinny, and lacks in taste. Fries are the frozen ones you buy in a bag at the supermarket. Weak!!!",

I had the Tijuana Dog - bacon wrapped and deep fried frank, grilled onion and jalapeno with mayo - $7.30  The Good:  When I saw  \"bacon wrapped frank\" my mouth began to water, how could I resist? I just hoped it was as good as it sounded, and it was. The flavor of the bacon combined with the dog, grilled onions, and jalapenos was very tasty.   The Bad: This is pretty minor and strictly cosmetic, but the dog didn't look all that appetizing when it came out. The bacon was nearly blackened around the edges and the dog had blistered up, I'm sure this was from the deep frier. I don't know if this could be avoided by shortening the cooking time by a few seconds or would it be just as good if it had been grilled? I don't know but this wouldn't stop me from ordering it again.  The Indifferent: At first I was a little leery of the prices. 5.50 for a plain dog? That's a bit steep. But when I started looking at their more interesting offerings (like the Tijuana), I figured those prices were worth it for a unique hotdog experience I was unlikely to stumble across elsewhere.     It did take them a while to get our food but they were fairly busy and the wait wasn't annoyingly long.  My only regret is I didn't have time to come back and try a couple of their other offerings before I left town. There are at least four or five other dogs on their menu I'd like to try on future visits.",

I won't lie though, I do kind of want to try all the dogs at some point because they all sound very intriguing (and I'm such a sucker for hot dogs).   BUT If you're in a hurry and want something satisfying and don't mind paying extra for a fancier hot dog than that in harrah's casino (theirs is 1.99, twice as long but not as thick and more simple) I'd suggest to go here.

So disappointing as I work nearby and was so excited for them to open!!!",

Lots of bayshrimp in an excellent cocktail sauce.   We were both very happy and satisfied. We have 4 more days and we'll be back!",

Its good food for a decent price, and a good place to go if you're ballin' on a budget, but other than that its just typical American food. That burger was definitely not 1/3 pound as the menu said, you might get a bigger burger at McDonald's, even. And they give you a regular sized bottle of soda to drink. Whats a guy gotta do to get a fountain soda around here?? I will say that the onion rings were delicious.",

I love Jalapenos so I went for the Jalapeno popper dog, which was beef, bacon bits, cheddar cheese and cream cheese and of course a bunch of jalapenos! It was decent. Of course with all those ingredients it was a little bit messy to eat.   Beverages are a little expensive which puts icing on the cake for me in terms of low value.  Decent food, great concept of it dogs, clean restaurant but expensive for what you get. For the same price, you can probably hit up one of the restaurants during happy hour and get way more food",

I mean, it's Vegas and the place was located in the bustling new LINQ wanna be promenade thing. That's all gravy baby. I expected something similar to Dog Haus. But I was wrong. The hot dogs were kind of ridiculous. I guess I had a high expectation cause there were actually a lot of people inside. My fault, because I yelped only right after I ordered and sat down. The hot dogs were ok. Won't cry about it. The NOT so GOOD thing is the shrimp cocktail special.  NOT GOOD AT ALL. My boyfriend and I had a freaking stomach ache after eating it. His cousin was fine, because he didn't order one. But my bf and I were NOT ok. Horrible. And what sucked the most was the fact that we ate here for a quick bite before driving the long stretch back to LA. URGH. Never again. Ever.",

Two dogs and a bottle of soda was $15. I get that it's the strip but the $1 foot longs you get from some of the casinos are way better. The dogs had crispy rubbery skin on them that was not even attached to the rest of the meat. The dog it self wasn't thicker than my index finger. Just yuck.

    "text": "Lots of interesting and creative hot dog options options available, but execution of the menu items were mediocre at best.  For the price, which is $5-$10 for a hot dog (most are closer to $10), I would expect better.  The toppings and the hot dog itself were fairly good.  But then again, it shouldn't be too difficult to produce a decent hot dog.  What I found surprising and disappointing was no effort to heat up the bun.  It was served cold and right out of the package.  No steaming, grilling, or toasting of the bun.  So what you get is a cooked hot dog with hot toppings, and a room temperature bun.  Also tried onion rings and poutine fires.  The onion rings were good.  The batter was light and fried well.  Unfortunately, the poutine fries were terrible.  There was barely any gravy and cheese curds on the fries.  In fact, when I first looked at the fries, I thought they had given me regular fries in error.  There was not enough gravy to cover the fries and I had to dig to the bottom of the fries to find any cheese.  The \"cheese curds\" turned out to be a ping pong ball sized glob of completely melted cheese.  If you are looking for a place that services poutine, this is not it.  Their version is nothing like traditional poutine.  Additionally, the cashier who took our order had a scowl on her face and made us feel like we were bothering her.  Two hot dogs + 1 onion rings + 1 poutine fries + 1 bottle of water + 1 ice tea = $31.  For the price and lack of quality, there are much better options elsewhere.",

That is if they are amazingly delicious which unfortunately was not the case here. :( Had just come from a concert at Brooklyn bowl and wanted something fast and cheap.  Well we got fast but not cheap.   First of all its a cute tiny place and the menu looked like there were some very great combinations . I ordered a hot and my husband ordered a cheeseburger and chili cheese fries. The hot dog was wrapped in bacon with grilles onions and jalapenos. Yummy right....not really I could have made the same thing for  cheaper and tastier. It was 9 bucks for the hot dog which was over priced to me. My husband enjoyed his burger but then again he had not eaten all day. The chili cheese fries were ok too. We ended up paying almost 40 bucks and I just don't think it was worth it at all. I think the combinations have the potential to be great but that just isn't the case right now. Save your money and make your own hotdogs.",

It's a small space with tables and countertop seating. They have license plates that cover the ceiling.   There was fine print of course. You had to buy a hot dog and you could get the shrimp cocktail for $1.   We were pretty full and all their hot dogs sounded fancy and were loaded with toppings. It took us a few minutes before we decided on a plain hot dog with sauerkraut to share so I could get that shrimp cocktail. The lady at the register was patient and nice as she answered it questions.   Well of all, even if it's a $1 or free even, it's not worth it. The shrimp cocktail is very small and on a bed of lettuce and cocktail sauce to fool you into thinking there's more. It's flavorless and watery.  However, the hot dog was amazing which ironically is not what brought me in. It's a ripper style hot dog meaning it was deep fried so it was crisp but juicy. This is the reason why I gave them 4 stars. I wanted to do a 1 for tricking people but then a 3.5 because the hot dog was great and the service was good.   We can't wait to come back and try their other specialty hot dogs! I wonder how many people fall for the shrimp cocktail like how we did...",

    "text": "Had a staycation and played tourist this past weekend with my honeybabe. He has never been to The Linq yet so we decided to head over there to check it out. This is my 3rd time at The Linq since it's been opened. Quick update: still boring, still bland stores and still a wannabe LA kind of vibe. Ugh. STILL a no-go in my book.  Anyways, wanted a quick bite to eat...literally. We weren't too hungry and we didn't want a big ol' lunch like what The Yardhouse or Tilted Kilt would offer. Wandered to Haute Doggery. Took a quick look at the menu and said, sure...why the heck not!?  We ordered the Tijuana Dog, the Gold Standard, and Crinkle Cut French Fries.   The Tijuana Dog DID NOT taste like the ones I've had in Downtown LA. So all you LA natives, you will be disappointed with this one. It was good...but not great. My boyfriend enjoyed his Gold Standard. Sadly, the crinkle cut fries was the star of everything. It came out pippin' hot and fresh.   Also, I found it weird for them to NOT have soda fountain machine. They only serve their drinks in bottles. ie. a bottle of mountain dew was available for purchase. I just think maybe they're being cheap and don't want people to come back for refills 5+ times a day. Oh well...whatever floats their boat. We came, we tried, and most likely we won't be coming back again. The price for what we ordered was not worth it. Almost $10 for a hot dog?!? No. Just no. We're not at Disneyland okay?!?!",

The regular hot dog itself was small, had an unpleasant skin, and tasted like nothing.  It was served on the plainest of buns.  The toppings were ordinary except for things like a slice of brisket (misplaced on a hot dog), etc.  The ambiance is non-existent, but the service is friendly.

    "text": "Haute Doggery is good, but even considering its location on the Strip I found it to be overpriced.  I had lunch at Haute Doggery on a Friday about 1:30.  It is a small joint inside, I would guess it seats about 30 at the max.  There is additional seating outside, and you can just get your food and eat somewhere in the Linq Promenade as well.  I went with the All American Dog and poutine on the side.  I had water to drink, and was told they have no free water options.  So, I bought a 16 ounce bottle of water for $3.  This is absurd given that Haute Doggery is located in the middle of a desert yet has no free water options.  I would rather they charge more for the food (which was not cheap either considering what you get) and give water cups to customers.  They have no fountain, but there certainly would be a way to make this possible.  Otherwise, continue gouging customers for water at over 300% markup.  I suppose I bought the water rather than going elsewhere, so Haute Doggery wins.  The dog comes with pulled pork, coleslaw, bbq sauce, & a few fried onions.  The onions were the best thing about the dog, they were crispy and fried perfectly.  No oil at all.  They were also flavorful, I should have ordered these as a side.  The dog is super messy (as most on the menu are when you put this many ingredients on a hot dog) but it was good.  Not close to the best \"fancy\" hot dog I have eaten, but it certainly wasn't bad.    The poutine was the weak link in the meal.  The crinkle cut fries are fine, but needed salt and pepper.  The gravy was a little thinner than I prefer, and the cheese curds were not distributed well.  About 1/3 didn't have curds at all, and in one part the cheese melted into a glob that I had to pull apart to eat.  I did not finish the poutine, buyer's remorse over the fried onions.  The lunch was nearly $20.  I realize we are a captive audience on the strip and I am sure Haute Doggery's rent is insanely high.  But, the meal delivered was not good enough to justify the price.  I don't regret eating here but I probably will not return soon.",

Felt the burn tonight for Frank. I needed him and he was waiting for me, hot and long at Haute Doggery. Mouth watering I waddled to the Frank Factory. Upon entering, Blues Traveler was on the radio. All treble. No bass. John Popper is underrated and he definitely inhaled hella Franks on the reg. At the order counter, I was greeted by a young friendly Woman who expressed empathy when Randall deliberately elbowed me in my watery mouth while I was ordering. Speaking of water, I asked for them to refill my Starbucks cup and they straight ignored me. I ordered the \"Windy City\" and added \"penos\" for that extra oral spice kick from Frank. The employees took their sweet time, but that was fine, because it gave me a moment to watch 4 men in their mid-60's huddle around half eaten Franks and  swipe through photos of women on Tinder in the corner of the restaurant. One of the men had ketchup all over the side of his face and I don't know how it got there. He made eye contact with me, but just then, 13 year old behind the grill called out my order. The moment I had Frank in my soft hands, time stood still. The music stopped. Everyone stopped chewing and watched me with baited breath as I closed my eyes, screamed \"9/11 was an inside job\" and put all 7 inches of Frank inside of my boca. A young mother screamed out \"dear god!\" and pulled her kid away from me. The Windy City frank was frankly splendid. It's nights like these that make me want to sell my breast milk in front of Home Depot. God Bless.",

The mac-n-cheese used on the hot dog was cheap poor-quality crap that you can probably get from Walmart for less than $1 a box. I wasn't expecting homemade cooking, but this was not the mac-n-cheese that I was expecting. It was dry and mushy at the same time, with minimal cheese that wasn't from the cheddar cheese they added on top. Mac-n-cheese should be creamy and cheesy. I got neither. The hot dog was also charred and extremely salty. We got a side of fries which were meh. I like hot dogs, but this was not it.",

I ordered the the Rising Sun, which I was hoping it would be like something similar to the \"Japa Dog\" version from Canada. It was not. The hot dog would be considered mediocre and the bun wasn't special either. It was a \"Millers Meats\" hot dog with some Japanese seasoning. The avocado was lost on me. It was fried right and nice and moist with crispy batter but what did it bring to the Japanese party? Nothing! Would be better on a Mexican dog. The big letdown was the crispy cut fries. They were cooked right but clearly tasted as if they came from a food service product. Not fresh, hand cut fries? Why not? I also ordered the Foie Gras gordons that go with the Billionaire Dogg, why do they serve separately, again is lost on me. It was not the best way to serve foie gras. Other than just being a pricey food item I don't think this item is needed not on any hot dog from here. Might be time to rethink these hot dog options and revamp the menu.",

The onion rings were in the same category as the batter was excellent. The only thing we didn't care for were the chicken fingers. They were not bad but just had an extremely bland taste. One price point complaint would be $4.00 for a 20 oz soda is way too high. As for returning to this location, I can't say I would go out of my way but if it's close by I would stop again.",

I love trying different hot dog places, and this place ranks up there with the best of them. Stella on tap is nice, and they have bottled water or sodas. You can build your own hot dog or try one of their unique creations. The onion rings were awesome, too! I forget the name of the woman who helped us, but she was so amazing and welcoming and answered all our questions without making us feel rushed to make a decision. I will definitely be coming back next time I am in Vegas!",

I ordered the Windy City dog which was basically a Chicago dog. The ingredients tasted high quality and the dog itself was all beef and grilled to order. Very delicious especially the peppers. The only thing I didn't like was the shrimp cocktail. They came with a hot dog for .99 cents extra so we tried it. It was really a waste of .99 cents because the shrimp were microscopic and the cup was mostly filled with shredded lettuce. However I won't it against them, because why order shrimp cocktail at a hot dog place anyways.",

    "text": "Last night, my friends and I had the amazing opportunity to see O.A.R. and Gogol Bordello for free! O.A.R. started the evening off right! Such a great show and full of energy, energy that built up my appetite. Between shows, my friends and I decided to walk the Linq and check out Haute Doggery for bite to eat.   First off, when you hear the name Haute Doggery, you think gourmet. You think, wow, that's a cool spin to a hot dog. That's what originally caught our curiosity. Hot dogs are an American classic. When there's a spin like that, you can't help but walk in and try them out! Walking into the place, you notice the bright accents around the room. White table tops, wooden trimmings and bright red chairs. The focal point to the place is the hot dog artwork to the back of the room. I thought at first sight, this place looked awesome! Then it was time to order.  THE BIGGEST, and I mean the biggest turn off for me are non engaged employees. When I walked up to the counter, the lady taking our order was texting on her cell phone! Clear as day, it looked like she was hiding from her coworkers, but didn't care about doing that in front of her customers. I took a picture and posted it onto the business page for proof. If you zoom into the picture, she wasn't texting anything professional. The conversation via text was about some drama. WHAT. A. TURN. OFF. That should NEVER happen. Unacceptable. She let me stand there for a good 30 seconds before saying something. When she did, she said, \"Don't worry, I can hear you. Go ahead and order,\" WHILE SHE CONTINUED TO TEXT. Ugh, I'm sorry for the rant, I just felt cheap and unimportant at that moment. Not good for this business. That may be the reason why they just opened in the Linq and so far have an overall Yelp score of 2.5 stars.   Aside from that, here's what I got for my meal:  -Crinkle Cut French Fries for $3.99: the big disappointment with these fries that they weren't fresh cut fries. If the business is going to advertise themselves as a step up from the normal hot dog joint, well then I would expect them to have stellar, fresh cut ingredients.   -Tijuana Dog for $7.29: When I did get the opportunity to talk with the hostess, I asked her between this dog and the Gold Standard dog (advertised on their business page on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FTheLinq.com&s=fde7305be5670653f29bfde09f99c26b3343b833470ff475486fbe3450045047\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">TheLinq.com</a>. She told me hands down, this dog. This dog was bacon wrapped and deep fried, topped with grilled onions, jalapeno and mayo. The jalapenos weren't overly hot and coupled with the onions, it brought a nice crunchy texture. One of my favorite guilty pleasures is eating a hot dog with mayo. This was no different and super delicious! Although the hot dog was bacon wrapped, which I LOVED, the dog was super small. It had a nice snap to it, but unfortunately for me, it got lost in the mix of ingredients and wasn't the True star of the show.   The word Haute means, \"fashionably elegant or high-class,\" depicted by Websters. This place was inspired by the famous Holstein's menu and to me, a huge disappointment. I appreciate their overall take on the American classic. I really wished the experience was much better than what I saw, heard and tasted that day. For the strip, I would say the price is on point, however, not worth the return visit in my opinion.",

It's a small walk-by hot dog joint and if you keep your expectations set on that then it's a good place. We wanted a smaller meal that was quick and this was a great little spot. The variety of hot dogs was good and were both able to find something good to satisfy our hunger. And the people around us had some dogs that were creative and that we would've loved to try if came back. We got two hot dogs (a Detriot Coney & a Seattle dog) as well as a side of fries, which were good, for less than $20. It was a nice spot for a casual, quick meal that didn't leave us feeling miserable or disappointed.",

When I get hot dogs, I always have to compare it to Costco hot dogs because #1 it tastes great and #2 it's $1.50 including a drink. I ordered the Naked Kobe but the sausage was small and the flavor bland. Also the casing was a little bit chewy. My friend got the El Machete and they also didn't find the sausage amazing but they liked the toppings. For $6.49 vs $7.29, I think a gourmet hot dog will be a better deal (if you can call $7 hot dog a deal).",

Wanting a veggie option when with a big group of people, all not wanting to spend too much on food after some unlucky gambling...this place was a big win to please the whole group. Noting super fancy. Just hot dogs with some cool toppings choices. I don't get the people complaining like they expected this to blow their minds or something. It's hot dogs. Not prime rib. I think they did a great job, quick service, fair price, so A++ from me. But you guys really should advertise that veggie option!

It was pretty small. If you're more quantity than quality, fast food is a better deal.  The Naked Kobe- exactly what it sounded like. A plain hot dog(Kobe beef) and bun with nothing on it.  Chili cheese fries- your typical chili cheese over a bed of crinkle cut fries that were fried to perfection.  All in all, the food was delicious but you're better off somewhere else.  Also, there is no \"cup of water\". The only water they have is bottled so you're forced to buy it.",

The Tijuana dog had a generic hot dog bun with a generic grocery-store level hot dog wrapped in bacon. It was topped with mayo and a row of jalapenos. Overall just okay at best.  What we did like were beer battered onion rings. They were piping hot fresh and came quite tasty as is. If you want, you can douse it in ketchup yourself, but I think it was good solo.

I also grabbed chipotle ranch for my fries. This had to have been the saltiest chipotle ranch I've ever had!! It was expensive. Paying what we paid for hotdogs you really would expect them to be amazing! Next time we're craving hotdogs we'll hit Costco.",

I was excited to try this place because everything else at the Linq has yet to have disappointed me, but unfortunately this place was the first.  The dogs lacked the unity found in other hotdog places. Trying different types with the toppings didn't make the dogs taste any better but made them taste worse. They hot dogs they used didn't seem to work with the toppings they decided to pair them with.  The service was a bit lack luster there was a general feeling of \"I don't want to work here\" and when I asked for an extra box to eat out of they gave me a used box that was sitting on the counter -.- not good  Overall an unsavory experience.

While our girls stopped at In & Out Burger we checked this place out and were not let down. We had a Chicago dog with the usual; a Gold Standard dog with bacon, arugula and my wife added celery salt and for the showstopper, a Billionaire Dog with Kobe beef, truffled mayo, port onion marmalade and topped with foie gras. Yeah, foie gras!  I don't think I need to say more other than, we never thought a hot dog would be so incredibly unforgettable. And to make things more the small restaurant piped in old school 80's and 90's hip hop! I would definitely recommend this joint if you're visiting the LINQ while in Vegas.",

As we were walking in we were given coupons for free fries with the purchase of a hot dog. Which is always a plus.  Walked in and it was relatively slow, only one person ahead of us in line. Made our order my mom and I split the gold standard dog and my dad got the plain one and we also got the onion rings.   Food came out fast and hot. The hot dog itself was good. The bread fell apart because of the toppings which is understandable.  It had good flavor and all the ingredients worked very well together. The fries were hot and crispy just the way we all like them.  Onion rings were slightly disappointing because they didn't resemble the picture on the menu.  They were the out of the bag and then deep fried kind instead of the flaky ones that were pictured.  Overall for a late night snack that won't break the bank it's a good place to go. The food is simple and tasty and fills you up. If you want something fast and easy I would definitely come here. It's open late and you get free fries. Always a plus.",

The space is a small storefront in the Linq promenade and has seating for probably 20-30 if you packed people in.  It's obviously an eat and run stop off.  The hot dog was normal sized (odd for Vegas) and I had a basic chili dog.  It was good. Not great.  For the price, I expected something a bit more.  Not sure if I expected bigger, bolder, or simply something special - but I got none of those.  Back home I could have had a better dog at a street vendor after a night at the bars.  So maybe I'm spoiled.  I think there are better options in the area if you're looking for a snack. But if hot dogs are your thing, and some of the other menu options light your fire, perhaps it would be a better experience.",

I had the Detroit Coney Classic (grilled frank, chili, onions, mustard & cheddar cheese) and a side order of onion rings.  It was almost $15 but it was also a LOT of food - definitely more than one meal.   Possibly could have used a bit more cheese (when you wrap a hot dog in paper...  the cheese WILL stick to the wrapper - they should really wrap in foil first).  But a pretty solid effort.  Located in the Linq Promenade, I wouldn't put this on your \"must do\" list, but you could definitely make a quick and cheap meal out of sharing one dog and some fries or onion rings amongst two people...  there is a LOT worse food to be found in the Promenade to be sure.",

The big problem the 1 lady at the register would take your order the go fix drinks for the order most of the drinks are located way past the food prep area and if they ordered a shake she would have to fix that as well while the 3 people fixing 1 or 2 hotdogs were just standing around watching.  it took over 15 or 20 minutes to place my order.  In my mind the cashier should only take orders and let the other three people take care of food prep and drinks.  Once the order was placed things got better.  I only give 1 star because the order taking was stupid slow.",

They're an OK size, but it's like somebody downloaded the first recipe they found off the internet for each one and just kinda slapped it together. No artistry to it, it's straight assembly line.   Surprisingly, the fries are better. It's the generic \"brown freezer bag\" crinkle type that restaurants often have but the oil was unusually tasty. I actually regretted getting the poutine gravy as it kinda just drowned out the taste.   Not fantastic but good enough for a filling junk food meal if you're at the LINQ or Flamingo for around 10 bucks. Don't miss the Yelp check-in deal above for free fries w/ any hot dog.   One note for all the degenerates out there, they don't award or use Caesars Rewards points anymore though it's still listed in their FAQ.",

    "text": "Being frequent imbibers of the delicious bloody Marys at the Barrymore, the bartender there recommended we try their 2 newest \"haute\" spots, one being the Haute Doggery (and the Blind Pig which I'll also review next)   So early one Saturday evening we ventured down to the Linq. It is an unwritten rule for Vegas locals to stay away from the Strip on the weekend.   What were we thinking?   A few words on the Linq dining & shopping area itself:   There is only one taxi drop off location and it's located under the new ferris wheel called the High Roller. You can also be dropped off at the Flamingo and schelp though the casino or at the IP oops wrong name - the Quad and schelp though. The Haute Doggery is on the strip side of the Linq so it's a schlep & with crowds, not that easy to navigate on a Saturday night - sober.   The \"Doggery\" itself is bright and cheery. Extremely clean & well laid out. A variety of seating - and yes Fatastic seating.   We ordered:   Tijuana Dog - 4.95+ a perfect Kobe dog, wrapped in bacon and deep fried, garnished with a fantastic mix of jalapenos & onions and dressed with a light mayo. The only -1/2 point was for the ugliness of the actual dog after the deep fry. A victim of circumstance but close your eyes and take a bite..after that you won't care.   Empire State Dog - 5+ - NOT a dirty water dog! - grilled to perfection and the red onion sauce we love. Just biting in made me homesick.   Plain Jane - 5+ - we fixed ours up with extras like bacon and a slathering of garlic aioli.   Order of crinkle cut fries 5+ delicious & brought back good memories of Saturday nights on the boardwalk at Coney Island.   Some might think it's a tad expensive for a 'dog' but its KOBE dogs. not some generic out of the freezer case dog.   The only down side was that it took quite a while for us to get our order and it came out piece by piece instead of all at once.  I can see this will be a problem once the High Roller opens and the crowds move in especially during huge events like the EDC & NFR.  Maybe by then they'll have their routine down and be faster at getting the orders out.  It will be on my list to take visitors to when they want to 'see the strip' - Good Job!",

I had called a week beforehand to make sure they sell gift cards, and was given the affirmative. So the hubby and I decided to make a date night out of it.  First off - they're hot dogs. They tasted good, although I would think it's more because of the toppings than the hot dog. It's pricey, but with all the toppings you get, it's not that bad. I had the Fun-Ghi and hubby had the Detroit Coney Classic. I thought mine tasted pretty good, and he thought his was just \"eh\". And we shared an order of onion rings, which we thought were average.   It took 10 minutes for the clerk or manager on duty to try and get me a gift card, only to tell me something was wrong with the machine and asked if I could come back the next day (which I couldn't do as it was out of the way for me, and my days were already full - yes, I shouldn't have waited till the last minute). Obviously they don't sell a lot of gift cards here, and it would have been nice to have known there were going to be problems before trekking down to the strip.",

The billionaire dog will catch your attention, but the cashier steered me towards the \"Funghi\" ... Which turned out to be a hot dog topped with mushrooms and truffle mayo and Gruyere cheese.  Reminded me of a pizza.  Unfortunately, they don't have a very large seating area so it's a little hard to get seated and eat.  I suspect one of the hot dogs I ate may have put me in a certain amount of gastrointestinal distress, so I'm gonna have to dock a star for that.

The place itself is small with maybe one or two tables outside, so it can get crowded during peak hours. However, the staff was quick and friendly and managed to push orders out while still maintaining quality.  I ordered the Gold Standard, which had bacon, cheddar cheese, tomato, arugula, and garlic aioli. It reminded me of a BLT (without the lettuce) but in hot dog form. The overall hot dog was pretty good. I would've liked it more if the cheese was melted a little bit but other than that, the flavors came together pretty well. The fries were really good as well. Freshly made to order and crispy.  I would definitely come back to try more from their menu! This type of place on the strip is a really great concept for all to enjoy.",

Being Japanese I really enjoy flavors of Japanese cuisine but as adventurous eater I love fusion foods. This is best hot dog I ever eat and could eat again and again.

My fault, I got caught up in the cuteness of the name and it was a cool vibe. The one stand out was the music. Excellent music, it was an eclectic mix of old skool rap, hip, rap and new skool artist mixed it. Not overwhelming, not vulgar, very chill and relaxing.

They hold True to their hours and we got in 5 minutes before closing and still got good service.  Dogs with toppings is not a new concept,  since it's been done many times over now.   Averaging about $9 per dog, the Yelp check-in deal for free fries was a nice perk.  You can upgrade for $1 for a polish dog. I chose the Rising Sun a slightly spiced dog with teriyaki glaze, spicy mayo topped with crispy yam and a deep fried avocado. The texture of crisp, then sweetness and the mild spice mixed well together.  Not bad for midnight snack,  but definitely not filling.",

    "text": "I was distraught to find out Pink's had closed.  But I had Hope.  Literally...a local resident named Hope recommended a couple of different places supposedly better than Pink's.  I did my own research and thought this one had the best combination of menu options and location.   It's located in a busy walkway next to the Linq Casino. If you blink you will walk by it.  I ventured into the cramped space and was a little stressed about the lack of seating. In order to enjoy a dog, one needs elbow room, right?  The second thing that stressed me out was the number of options. If there is a way to turn it into a dog, they have done it.    I waited my turn and used a version of a Basketball tournament as my selection guide. \"If this dog goes against that dog, then that dog gets eliminated.\"  I was finally down to two.   A table opened up and I was no longer stressed!  I got my order and sat near the door.    So my choices:   The Rising Sun:  Grilled Kobe beef frank. Crispy yams.  Nori furikake, teriyaki glaze. Spicy mayo.  And tempura avocado   Versus...  The  Fun-Ghi. Char grilled frank, grilled mushrooms, caramelized onions, gruyere cheese and truffle mayo.     The crispy yams on The Sun added a nice textural element that complemented the smoothness of the tempura avocado. But the teriyaki made it all slightly on the sweet side.   On the Fun-ghi, the caramelized onions, gruyere and truffle mayo worked together effortlessly and the dog had a nice mouthfeel to it.   Fun-Ghi wins!!!  It's not quite as good as Pink's but it was worth the Uber ride!!!!",

The hamburger was thick & juicy and the Pepsi was in a bottle & cold!  I would go back, my son loved my food more than his.

Individually, the ingredients didn't really do much for me. I didn't really taste the mayo, but maybe it was subdued due to the truffle mixture, the onion marmalade was good, though. I've never had Foie Gras, so I didn't know what to expect. This was heavy on Kalamata olive flavor. I'm not a fan of said olives so it was a bit alone. However, taking a bite with everything combined was magical.  Venue-wise, it's small inside but due to its location, that's understandable. You can eat in a booth, stand at a table, or sit at a counter. The dogs are made very quickly and the service is friendly. I'm definitely coming back.",

They have their dogs in mainly two different categories: Retro Dogs and Haute Dogs (which are their signature hot dogs). I decided on my first visit to try one of the Retro Dogs called the Detroit Coney Classic. It wasn't bad, but nothing really stood out. The bun was soft, the hot dog cooked well, and the toppings were decent; nothing to hoot and holler about. The fries we got seemed to have either been sitting for a while under a heat lamp or were overcooked or both. We got water which they only sell bottled (but it does have their logo on the bottle which was cool). The pricing is what you would expect for being on The Strip but not too terribly overpriced for calling themselves a gourmet hot dog place.",

I thought with how much this burger was it would have at least came with fries, but it was just the burger. Obviosuly, the bacon in the burger was great but the grilled onions was just too much for me. It felt like the grilled onions had too much sauce and oil on them, it was just oozing out. Overall, it just made the burger soggy. My stomach ended up hurting right after a few bites.  I didn't get tomato with it, I could imagine if I did it would have been worse for me.   The customer service was okay. Nothing special. Their water bottles are $4 and it's not even as big as an Arrowhead water bottle. I guess that's what you get for getting food on the strip.

I ordered the chili chesse and onion.. the hot dog comes wrapped even if u it it there. Light on chese and chili...may be a bit overpriced aincw they skimp on the toppings. No snap to the dog at all. The bun texture was kinda hard like it had been sitting around. It was strange the dog had no snap as it had a casing. The chilibwas bland.  I would pass unless you have a huge craving",

It was bacon wrapped with onions and mayo. Pretty good but not that impressive. It was pretty busy when we came but the traffic flow is not too bad. The line to order is by the entrance and you get your food at the end of the bar. They have a decent amount of seating but it seems like most people take their dogs to go, to wander around the linq.   The service is alright. They're not super involved with your dining experience. The place is run like a fast food joint. Order in one line and pick up in another. It was just meh. No one specifically stood out for poor or excellent service. I'd come here again, but only if I'm craving a hot dog and it's the only place open in the area.",

    "text": "I'm pretty surprised about the really bad reviews but maybe I'm just not the hot dog expert (I get easily satisfied with eating store-bought Nathan's hot dogs at home).  Yes, the prices are steep. But it's on the Vegas strip and as far as I've experienced so far, EVERYTHING is overpriced around here. Even Starbucks seemed to have cost me more than normal. Having said that, the number one advice you should follow when it comes to trying Haute Doggery is DO NOT ORDER DRINKS HERE. Their drinks ARE ridiculously priced even for Vegas. They are very conveniently located right outside the Linq.  I have tried the Fun-ghi (mushrooms and Gruyere cheese) and Detroit Coney and loved them both. Fries were very crunchy and my son loved them. Very little sit down room but pretty clean place. More a place to eat and run rather than stay and hang out.  Advice to management: You may want to put a large sign outside listing your menu. You have a pretty complicated menu (with fancied up names and lists of ingredients) and during the two times I ate there, I saw A LOT of people come in, look at your hard to read overhead menu, and step back out. If you put a menu outside, at least they get to read about all the complicated menu items and decide if they do want to eat there or not.",

My friend and I weren't interested in eating at the more expensive options inside the casinos so we decided to come here.  I ordered the Detroit Coney Classic - basically a chili cheese dog with onions and mustards. It was pretty good - it's admittedly hard to mess up a chili cheese dog, but the onions and mustard (as well as the ketchup I added myself) gave it a good kick.   I have two minor gripes with this place: the interior is very small, and the hot dogs are kind of pricey. I believe I paid $7 for my hot dog, which felt a bit much. But it is Vegas.

Well, if you are going to make that claim, then do it right. Start with the Chicago style dog was a joke. Not even served on a poppy seed bun, and they suggest using a steamed dog as opposed to a char grilled? It was a hoffy hot dog on wonder bread with the rest of the fixings. At least the peppers, pickle, tomato  onions were real. Menue claims beef is Kobe. I highly doubt that and why does a hot dog need to be kobe, anyway?

    "text": "This little hot dog restaurant is at a great location - LINQ Promenade on Las Vegas Strip. We came here because we wanted a quick affordable eat before we hit the dayclub at Drais. It was indeed close by Cromwell, quick service and delicious. I love the billionaire dog. It's cheap foie gras on top but I still enjoy it because I couldn't think of anywhere else I could get a hot dog like this!   It was nice, clean, and organized when we went. Food was presentable, hot and juicy! I wouldn't recommend the dollar shrimp cocktail - tiny shrimps and not fresh. I mean it was only a dollar so what could you ask for. But I still wouldn't chance it for stomach ache..   There are so many options here other than just the traditional hot dogs, that's what I like about this place. They also have vegetarian hot dog, taste pretty good too. It's not the cheapest hot dogs but don't forget it's the Las Vegas Strip, everything is overpriced!",

Its a small, casual shop that offers many different varieties of hot dogs, a couple burgers and crinkle cut fries.  I tried the fun-ghi and it was bomb! Grilled mushrooms, added some jalapenos, cheese and a special aioli sauce on top of a hot dog all equalled AWESOME!

He loved it. We also got poutine. Which, i'm curious to know how close it tastes to the reeeeaaal poutine.  It took a long time to get our food - but I mean, its fresh then I guess. Lol.

    "text": "\"Hotdogs are made out of pig buttholes,\" my dad told me when I was eight. Needless to say I didn't eat another for over a decade and we've had a tense relationship ever since. But thanks to the gourmet hotdog movement of 2004, I've ventured out to try them every few months or so.  Enter Haute Doggery- located in the LINQ, touting Kobe-beef dogs with gourmet toppings. I opted for the Fun-ghi Dog, menu description: a char-grilled frank with grilled mushrooms, caramelized onions, truffle mayo and shredded Gruyere cheese.  It arrived covered in cheese, which was fine with me since I love cheese. But I quickly discovered that the cheese was a blanket of deception, meant to hide the fact that my $9 hotdog had a scant four mushrooms on it and so few onions as to seem missing or forgotten. Oh, and I highly doubt that these are made with Kobe anything- and even if they are, their cooking method renders the quality of product useless. Listed on menu as grilled, it tasted boiled and lightly seared (which explains how it was ready in 3 minutes) and had ZERO snap. And the bun was unremarkable other than it being broken in two pieces before it reached my mouth.   Pet peeve: receipt for walk-up restaurant has a tip line, but there is virtually no service provided. Even when there are only 3 people in the restaurant, order is called out when ready instead of walked out to the customer. Kind of tacky.",

I should've read the reviews and did a little more research but my eagerness got the best of me and I paid for it... $39 dollars of crappy food that is..  Idea and concept is there but execution sucked! Presentation sucked! And service definitely sucked!  First the prices for hotdogs, burgers and fries were up the ass.. Second, upon ordering our burger we had requested for the meat to be cooked \"medium rare\".. The cashier and so-called cook said \"You know that's raw right?\" I said, \"What?!\" Excuse me last time I checked medium rare meant the meat cooked but has a touch of red in the middle, not raw.. PLEASE EDUCATE YOUR COOKS & STAFF!! Looked at us like we were stupid... Third, when we received our food presentation was crap! Wasn't at all pretty and looked pretty damn ordinary to me considering we got the most expensive hot dog & burger...   Now the taste.. There was no quality in the food! Was not worth the monies we spent! Hot dogs could've more than likely come from your local Albertsons, the foie gras was bland, cheap bread, the \"Perfect Burger\" was so ordinary, my first poutine was yet my worst poutine..   WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY & SPACE AT THE LINQ-- will NOT be returning!",

The dog itself was good, but if you're gonna advertise high end stuff like truffle and foie, don't skimp on these things! Couldn't even taste truffle in the mayo, and the foie was random broken pieces rather than nice medallions.  The interaction between the cashiers and cooks are just about non-existent too. Seems like they just go through the motions rather than engage a guest, offer suggestions and sell you product, know whattamean???  You're better off hitting up local spots like Great Links in the Northwest or even Fernandez on E Charleston for their killer street dogs...ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  2",

They have good choices and an interesting menu, some choices look great like the longhorn and the all American. Even with our orders, the idea was great but execution was off. Stale bun is a big turn off for a hot dog. The actual dogs were a little too undercooked to properly enjoy. So that leaves me with toppings to enjoy and that's not enough to carry the whole experience.  While in Vegas, I am surely more prompted to stick with the off the strip hot dog spots that go the extra mile like Buldogis and Dirt Dog.",

But unfortunately, nothing exciting was to be found here.  The place was near empty when we walked in. The cashier was less than happy to be there and was decidedly unfriendly.  The menu was enticing. Lots of unique and creative options. We settled on a Longhorn dog, poutine fries, and a bottle water. It's definitely not a cheap place to eat.  Our order was ready within a reasonable amount of time. But they forget a key thing...flavor. The dog itself was bland. The bun was bland. The BBQ beef on to was bland. The cole slaw on top was actually disgusting. And the onion rings on top were poorly done. Even hungry, I couldn't force down more than a few small bites.  The poutine fries were about what I would expect my 4-year nephew to create. It's a total sham to call them poutine fries. The fries themselves were decent. And then had a smattering of icky gravy and icky cheese. They were quite sad.  In sum, quality and taste are lacking here. If it's a good hot dog you crave, there are better places on the Strip to satisfy your hunger need.",

    "text": "I'm usually not a big hot dog person but I was curious to try this place out after a long night on the town in Vegas. Since it was close to our room and the name and theme caught my attention, we stopped in. They have a wide variety of hotdogs to choose from. It really reminded me of a place in New Orleans that had a similar concept. I ordered the Mac n cheese dog (will add a pic) and it was a hotdog with Mac and cheese and bacon bits on top. It was different, but pretty tasty. There are a few others that I'm curious about trying! My best friend seemed to like The Windy City one that she ordered. We also really enjoyed the check in offer for free fries with any hotdog order. Thanks Yelp! As a matter of fact, the one major con to me is the price of the hotdogs. They are between $8-11 or more which is too pricey for just a hotdog in my opinion. It would makes more sense for the price to include fries. It may even cause people to order more. Overall, it's a unique concept for a touristy area like Linq Promenade.",

    "text": "While walking around the LINQ promenade, my friend and I decided to grab lunch here because hotdogs sounded like a good idea. Given that the name of the place has the word \"haute,\" I was expecting some really good gourmet hotdogs. I don't think that's the case here.  The interior is pretty small with limited seating inside and two small tables outside the doors. It was nicely decorated with anime-like drawings on one of the walls and an American flag made out of license plates on the ceiling (yeah patriotism!).  The employees weren't really that welcoming, but at least they (kinda) warmed up to us when we ordered.   Anyway, the hotdogs were just eh. My friend and I got the Gold Standard hotdog and used the check-in offer to get a free Polish hotdog to save for later.   The Gold Standard was apparently a char-grilled hotdog with bacon, cheese, tomatoes, arugula, and a garlic aioli. The Polish was just your standard hotdog, nothing too special. At first glance, the hotdogs looked like fake food. I mean it was glossy and when you bit into it, the hotdog had a weird texture. The arugula was fresh, but it didn't go well with the other things on this hotdog. The tomatoes were fresh as well and super juicy, but I didn't like how it made the hotdog bun soggy... I didn't taste the garlic aioli in there, so it basically tasted just like a regular hotdog... with cheese.   Haute Doggery didn't really knock my socks off, and I don't think it was worth the price. I know things on the strip are a bit more expensive than places off the strip, but with subpar \"gourmet\" hotdogs you should really save your money for something else.   Yeah it may look like a fancy gourmet hotdog, but it sure didn't live up to that standard. What a waste of a cheat day...",

Many variations of hotdogs and all the sides that typically go with them.   They are a bit pricey for hotdogs (ranging from $5 to almost $8) but it is Vegas and what isn't overpriced. Service was slow.  We were greeted at the counter quickly and efficiently, but it took longer than it should have to get our food.  What we got was tasty.  I especially enjoyed the fries.  They were crinkle cut (which is my favorite) and even offer a poutine option.  The poutine had a nice amount of gravy but was a bit light on the cheese.  But overall it had a nice flavor. They also offer a 99 cent \"classic Vegas\" shrimp cocktail.  It had lettuce, cocktail sauce and shrimp all in one little cup.  A fun add on to the meal. Drinks are only offered in bottled form and are almost $3, but again, not unexpected. Overall a cute place for a great quick bite.",

    "text": "This place was downright disgusting, not only was the food bad, but so were the prices.  I was initially excited to try this place out, but it was nothing but a big disappointment.    Usually I go all out fatty in Vegas, but summer is coming, and I've been trying to be a little better in portion control, eating well, and working out.  So while in Sin City, and since I wasn't able to do my usual all you can eat buffet, I decided just to just get a quick bite to eat before hitting up the club... Haute Doggery was the nearest, most convenient, shortest wait option.    Afterall, you can't go wrong with a hot dog right?  (wrong...) lol... I should have stayed with a usual regular hot dog, but noooo.... The menu had to throw in keywords like \"Kobe Beef\", \"Foi Gras\", \"Billionaire Hotdog\"... The marketing totally got me and at the end of the order make you not mind paying over $10/hotdog for those crafty keywords... Oh and since I didn't have that great of cellphone reception, I was unable to check in and get the yelp discount; make sure you do that if you eat here.  As I waited, I admired American Flag ceiling made out of license plates...  My order came out and presentation was a disappointment.   I brought my order to go and walked it upstairs to my room.  As I was in the elevator, everyone made conversation about the hotdogs I was holding.  Two black men remarked \"WTF is that, livers n sh***\".  I was a bit embarrassed about my order as they snarled at me for being asian, filling in the stereotype of eating weird things.  The ultimate taste of this hotdog was bland, almost a gross texture, and nowhere near tasting like a billion dollars.  The Billionaire dog looked like it had two hard boiled eggs on top (cold foie gras).  What a waste of foie gras.  I don't think I'll ever eat foie gras again after they butchered it; cold, hard and disgusting, leaving me with a bad taste and memory... When I finally ate it, it had a thick sweet sauce which I was not a fan of.  It was plain gross, imo.  The Rising Sun dog, which I ordered second, looked like it had a fried jalapeno which ended up to be a fried avocado (I know weird).  It was much better than the Billionaire dog, but nothing to rave about.  All I liked about it was the spiciness to remove the taste of the Billionaire dog.  I don't know why they call it a \"Kobe Beef\" dog.  It tastes like a regular hotdog.  Meh.... Marketing...  The two expensive dogs on the menu were terrible.  I wish I had ordered something else, something normal.  Better luck next time Vegas.",

    "text": "First day in Vegas! Obviously, I didn't want to eat that much before the party. So, my friends and I opted for something small and to share. It is not a great idea to eat something salty and fatty before fitting into out tight clothes, but we really wanted something cheap. Us 6 shared a hotdog, onion rings, and regular fries. The total was about $20? The hotdogs that we got was the Billionaire Dogs, which cost $10.99. It is a grilled Kobe beef frank, with Foie Gras torchon, port onion marmalade and truffle mayo. The hotdog was pretty good. The Foie Gras torchon aka liver, was kinda gross because I expected them to slice the liver thinly or even grind it into a pate style. Instead, they just put two blocks of yellow-color liver on top of the hot dog. The onion was really well marinated to the point it got sorta over powering. The truffle mayo looked gross to me, but my friends loved it. I only liked the Kobe beef and the buns haha. The beer battered onion rings were pretty darn good. It wasn't oily as I thought and the onion rings were perfect bite size. The fries were crunchy and not overly salted. Overall, it's a good place to come by if you don't want to spend too much at Pink's Hotdog. (Price is around the same but probably $1-2 cheaper). The downsize of this is that its located in an alley by the high rollers. I can tell that people will definitely miss this place and just go straight to Sprinkles cupcakes or Yardhouse. I know I almost did...",

    "text": "**Haute No More** HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!  I'm rarely compelled to give a one star rating for various reasons, and unfortunately, this is one of those rare instances.  The one star is given to the tempura avocado on The Rising Sun and the port onion marmalade on the Billionaire Dog. The place is decently clean with an inviting decor. I'll give credit where credit is due, and this is where it all ends.  Our number was called roughly 20 minutes after we placed our orders, mind you that all we wanted were 2 dogs to fight off mid-afternoon cravings prior to our dinner reservation. As suggested by the time of the day, the place was not packed with people during normal dining hours, although there was a steady stream of foot traffic coming and going given that people tend to eat at any hour of the day in Vegas.   I tend give new restaurants the benefit of the doubt because I understand that it takes time to grease the wheels back in the kitchen, and so I stayed optimistic. And perhaps, with wishful thinking on my part, that they were taking their time to make the dogs right. Unfortunately, one disappointment followed another from here on.   Both franks were dry and bland. There's nothing special about the kobe frank that is to be desired over a regular dog. And based on the other comments, the regular dogs are not getting complimented much either. In the test kitchen, they may have tasted as good as they sound on the menu, but unfortunately, they were poorly executed here. There was no hint of truffle in the mayo, and so I asked for the Garlic aioli to bring it up just a notch.  Now, this is the part where the story could have taken a turn, but instead, it sealed its fate.  The lady behind the counter looked down at the receipt, then back up and said, \"It's 50 cents. You can pay it at the register up front.\" Under normal circumstances, I would not have made a fuss had the menu (both in the store and the website as of the date this review is posted) not said that it was FREE!!! (You can verify this under photos that other customers have posted should they update the menu at a later time.) There were no fine prints indicated otherwise either. When I pointed out this fact, she repeated the answer using the I-can-care-less tone and gave me the you-are-wasting-my-time + leave-me-alone combo look. Strange, but True. No explanation. No apology. Just Attitude.  It also left me wondering how many customers have been Falsely charged for the condiments without knowing. Just to be clear, I'm not appalled at the fact that they're charging for condiments, but I am annoyed at the attitude in which the manner was handled, and the deceptive business operation this little incident is projecting. I cannot believe that a place of their potential would risk of categorizing itself under *****FALSE ADVERTISING***** over chump change, inadequate customer service, and poor management!!!!  This is one of those rare instances where I would steer people away from a place even though I had a not-so-pleasant experience because I believe I visited a place on one of their \"off\" days. But after reviewing other comments (which is what I should have done before I got all excited about the mysterious power that Kobe and foie has over me), it seems to me that an abundance of \"cold\" disappointments are being served up at this supposedly \"hot\" joint.  All in all, there is definitely no shortage of competition in Vegas, especially when it comes to eateries. I am curious to see how long the little Doggery door can stay open with the high lease and the streak of low ratings. Any guesses?",
