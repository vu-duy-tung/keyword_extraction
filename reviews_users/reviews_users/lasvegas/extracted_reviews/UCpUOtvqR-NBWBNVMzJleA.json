    "text": "My friends and I came here on a Saturday night to celebrate a birthday and we all had a pretty good time. There was a $5 cover so make sure you bring cash. We all started off with a round of drinks. I had a mango mojito and it was really tasty and was served with an orchid inside! Drinks ranged from $14-$18 I believe.   This was definitely a good spot to come dancing. My friend who lived in Vegas for a few years said that this was a place that locals usually come to because they generally hate the crowds at the bars/lounges on the Strip. The DJ played a good mix of new and old-school hip-hop. And there were plenty of tables to sit down and take a break. There was also a photographer going around taking pics and selling them. I paid $20 for a nice quality pic and gave it to my friend as a bday gift.   The location is pretty good as well. It's located on the second level of a outdoor shopping plaza, so there was plenty of free parking around. I'd come back next time I'm in Vegas!",

The hookah was the only down fall. It wasn't terrible but for $30 it wasn't very strong and the flavor lasted 15 minutes. Other than that it was a good time.",

Had to wait at the front door, they couldn't find our reservation meaning we were forced into a spot with only one waitress for 30 people. We were supposed to have bottles waiting for us, given that they didn't know we were coming there were none. We asked ahead of time if we needed to pre order food, they told us no, they lied we had to wait for our buffet. After further inspection of the food we found roaches crawling around. I have pictures and video of it, we demanded they bring us her cake so we could leave, they took forever and them came back with it lit so we were forced to stay longer!!! We promptly asked for it to be packed up, that took forever too. Spoke with the manager and she was as useless as they come. After much debating she finally only had us pay for the bottles which should have been her first offer all along. Don't go there it's unsanitary!!! And they know!! I filed a complaint with southern Nevada health district but it's just not enough. Such a horrible place and waste of time and money.",

    "text": "Blue Martini was pretty disappointing. I really liked the vibe when I walked in. The space was huge with dining type seating, dance floor, outdoor seating and the option to set up a hookah right on your table.   I'm from the Bay Area but was visiting Vegas to celebrate my partners birthday. Her friend, a local thought this would be a good place to grab a bite, hear some tunes, and grab a drink.   Food:  Menu was quite small, although it was a bar scene so I guess you can't expect too much. We ordered the crab and shrimp dip (only came with 6 small banquette slices , $2 for 6 more), and pepperoni flat bread ( came out cold, and I was given a hassle by the server and runner when I requested a new one o be mad) overall my food experience was horrible, should have went downstairs to the yard house.  Service:  The host was friendly, staff were smiling, and the manager handled my food discrepancy very professionally.  Drinks:   Lots of specialty cocktails, bottled beer only, this place needs some taps.   Overall if you are looking to hang, drink and dance with your crew this spot seems like it has it all for not a bad value. Definitely might wanna come with a full tummy.",

I can't really pinpoint what I don't like about it, but all I know is that every time someone suggests going there I feel disappointed. On most occasions, I end up enjoying myself quite a bit. I think it's due to a combination of positives that this place has going for itself. Great Happy Hour, Industry and Ladies specials (50% off drinks and appetizers).  For the most part, I've had a good time on my last few excursions here so I guess I'm getting over the my dislike. Sorta.  Try the key lime martini. It's my favorite! They have hookah here too as of late, which is a nice addition.",

Ok, what's going on, we look around, and Blue Martini, had every single table  with reserved signs on them!  EVERY SINGLE TABLE!  And to be able to sit at one of these tables, you had to order, not 1 but 2 bottles!  And the least expensive bottles were $125.00!   It was kind of one of the employees that gave us all this info to comp us our first drink!  At that point there was 5 of us.  Now we stayed there til about 8:30, and as people were getting these tables, I only saw 1 girl come out with the fireworks thing! (which means someone bought a bottle)  As we were looking at people at the tables, there were no bottles! These folks were ordering drinks just like us!  Our group of friends that we roll with, we are ordering drinks!  They lost our group business.....I think I said, I won't be back.....Well I take that back, I will pop in to get my free ladies drink and maybe one more.  But they won't be getting the business that we would normally bring!   I'm not sure if maybe you had to slip someone some under the table money to get a table......But were not the one!  We will find a new spot for our group of friends!  BAD MOVE, BLUE MARTINI!",

    "text": "Review is for Blue Martini as an event space only. I had a really great experience booking a last minute holiday party for 43 people under $2100 (including food, booze, tax & 20% autograt).   My boss decided to have a department party about a week earlier and after scrambling to find a place with availability that was also reasonably priced, I thought of Blue Martini. The biggest deciding factor was that they let large groups to do happy hour drinks (50% off everything) which runs every day till 8pm. They also allowed us to use our own printed drink tickets to limit people to 2 each, and my boss was happy they were really strict about collecting tickets when they took drink orders. They had 2 other groups booked inside, so we ended up on the patio, which worked out fine even on a 50 degree night. Hooray for heat lamps.   Lana the event manager was great about sending me info and answering questions via email, and she was also on site to address any issues during the event. I had to ask for additional tables, and had questions on whether food was being replenished - Lana was always available and super helpful.   I'll admit I had kind of low expectations for the food, but the prime rib was surprisingly good - the price was reasonable at $325/50 people (+$50 set up fee), potatoes were $125 and their portions were generous. I would probably pass on the caprese salad because the cheese wasn't very good, but we only went with 1 order (feeds 22ppl) it was a larger portion than expected. People less food snobby than I am thought it was fine. 1 order of the Spinach artichoke dip ($85) was also a bigger serving than expected - a half pan filled about halfway and a big bowl of chips. We got 3 orders of the assorted flatbread ($50 each), which seemed like kind of a smaller portion for 22ppl each, but still decently priced and everybody loves flatbread.    A few negatives - 1 cocktail server for that many people doesn't make sense and bartenders are still as slow as they were years ago. Plastic plates are ok I guess, but you try cutting prime rib with plastic cutlery. They were pretty bad about clearing dirty plates and glasses from their tiny cocktail tables, I often ended up bussing tables myself. The live music actually brought the energy down - it's not a fun band anymore, just 1 guy playing the worst loungey/jazzy version ever of Megan Trainor's All About Bass.   Those are minor things and everybody had a good time, which is all that matters. My boss liked it so much that he's talking about having another event in a few months. We all had a lot of fun times at Blue Martini (maybe 6 or 7 yrs ago?), and although this was a great party, I'm not really motivated to start hanging out here again - it's definitely more of an older crowd now, so just not my scene.",

Said roommate needed to charge her phone and this was one of the only places that was happy to make that happen.   We sat outside on the patio and perused the menu on the table. It consisted mostly of drinks, with a few \"light bites\" listed as well. Much to my chagrin, there are no beers listed on this menu. Obviously, there are a million martinis to choose from, along with a good selection of wines and champagnes, but no beer! There is beer available, but you have to torture your waitress by making her list beers by memory. My roommate highly recommends the Cake Pop martini, should you be so inclined.   Anyway, the service was great. The waitress appeared when we needed her, but understood that we were in the middle of a serious chat session. The only real downside in our experience: the heaters on the patio really don't help. I think they're more for show than anything else.",

Sitting outside seems ideal, as you can hear the band and still enjoy the company of your friends fire side.  The bands perform behind a bar.. I have no idea how the bar tenders aren't deaf by now.  Although I've been assured I came on an unusual night and the service is alot better than what i experienced, it was very difficult to flag a waitress down.  If you can't don't bother and just go up to the bar and buy yourself the drink.  Onto the menu:  You have some appetizers including beef tenderloin, seared ahi tuna, lobster tacos, etc.  that are expensive, but I heard good (particularly the lobster tacos)  Martinis:  tons of flavorful concoctions to pick from including key lime pie, smores, red apple, blue martini, mango madness, etc.  I opted for the mango madness which I've been assured doesn't taste strongly of alcohol, which it definitely didn't.  It almost made me wonder if it was just a weak watery drink or was it done so well even I couldn't taste the alcohol.  Prices are up there ranging from $12 - $15 a glass, but you do also get the shaker so it amounts to two martinis for the price one one.  My one martini gave me a decent buzz.    I'd def come back here again.  Maybe on a night where the band's not playing rock.. maybe something else.",

My back was to the waitress stand. I was talking to my friend and a waitress came around the back of me(I couldn't see her) and ran into my hand as I was taking(I talk with my hands).  She spilt her tray of drinks on my friend (my friends was soaked) She gave me a look as if I ran into her. She never apologized, nobody came over. I asked for a manager and Raul came over. I started to explain what happened and he said I know what happened the waitress told me you hit her tray.  He was a big guy and was very aggressive like he wanted to throw me out or go to punches. After a huge confrontation with him he bought us a drink thanks to my friend that had to step In and calm us down(I didn't want the drink).  All I wanted was someone to apologize for what happened. I thought they were all about the customer but apparently not.",

    "text": "Soon after moving to Vegas Blue became a favorite place - great staff, fun drinks, and all in all a good time. Last year when friends started to dislike going here, I stayed faithful because to me it was still fun. I used to go at least once a week, more like 3-4.   However, I went on a Thursday a couple weeks ago and if given a choice, I will probably never be back!   Cons: The crowd and the staff have changed ... bartenders and wait staff are rude, managers are obnoxious, the food mediocre at best, the drinks are Thursday night band sucks. Unless a close friend has something here, I unfortunately won't be back.   Pros: It was nice going where they know my name, it's off the strip, bouncers and girls at the front are always very nice and easy to talk to, Leah (sp?) especially - she is so sweet. If there is a problem the bouncers handle it respectfully.",

Yes, I know that's expected in club type bars but I didn't really notice any security watching for issues so was uncomfortable. I'm not one to usually worry about this but Vegas clubs are a different story. Never know if half the place is altogether or just dumb tourists looking for a rise. Great for singles. Couples...

What we ordered and what was received at our table was incorrect! Didn't provide extra sauce and salad which i paid an extra $6 for! Horrible! Also, our waitress had a bad attitude by walking away when we did not even complete our order. Hence the fact our oder came out incorrectly. If that isn't the job for them they shouldn't work there.

    "text": "We went on a Saturday night to celebrate a birthday. We picked this place for the simple fact that no one wanted to deal with the clubs/bars on the Strip. Unfortunately, this place tries waaaay too hard for a strip mall bar. There was a line and a cover charge. At $10, no one complained. The problem started when security asked my brother to remove his hat. He removed it and stuffed it in his pocket. He was then told he couldn't even enter the club w the hat at all. He had to leave it outside. He had on a simple baseball cap. Literally while security was telling him this, 3 guys walked out of the club temporarily...ALL WITH HATS ON!! 1 had a hat to the back and 1 even had a skully on. You can't make this up!! So now we're looking at security like \"are you kidding me?!?\". They offered no explanation but stuck to the \"no hat\" policy clearly just for him. He had to leave his hat on the ground at the door. After finally going in, we noticed 1 out of every 10 guys had on hats!! All kinds of hats; baseball, skully, cowboy, etc. It was actually ridiculous at this point. So while the place itself was really nice. (I like that it had hookah.) It's trying waaaay too hard to be some kind of upscale club but in fact it's a damn strip mall bar. The drinks are overpriced ($15+) and watered down. The people working the door are overzealous to say the least. I probably would not go back on a Saturday night.",

They are uniquely served in a martini glass along with the shaker and its ingredients on the side. Each martini has so much flavor and truly keeps you wanting to try so much more. My favorite? The Lychee Martini.  The atmosphere in Blue Martini is also top notch. Whether you want to dance and meet great looking people, or slow things down on the patio with a drink or hookah, Blue Martini caters to your every mood.   This is a fantastic local spot, and great for tourists who want to skip out on the Strip Martini Prices and enjoy some serious fun.",

    "text": "I hate to give this place 2 stars because its a solid establishment but unfortunately there were too many hiccups to warrant anything more.  First off the good. The ambiance is lovely. On any day other than Sunday its a good date night place. Dimly let and cozy. I went on a Sunday for Neo Soul happy hour. The ambiance was more of a club atmosphere. But, still a good time. Drinks are a bit pricey but well worth it. I had a dreamciscle martini and OMG. Delicious!  There were a few issues with the evening but for the sake of brevity I will only detail the biggest 2. Everything revolves around the fact that this place was understaffed and unorganized. First off, there was a drunk guy passed out at the bar on the patio. Now there's drunk and then there's where are your friends because you may need medical attention. This guy had his head on the bar with both arms were handing to his side. He was clearly gone. I simply couldn't believe that no one saw this. Not the bartender feet in front of him or any of the staff members zooming and zipping past him. I notified my waitress who was also oblivious to the fact. She notified what appeared to be a door guy. After about 10 minutes of yelling in this guys ear and shaking him to death with no response he gets another door guy to help him lift he guy out of the chair. The guy was NOT coherent and could not lift his head let alone stand or walk. They each grabbed an arm and drug him out to the stairs leading to the nearby movie theater.   Now, in no way did I expect the staff to babysit this guy. What I also didn't expect was for them to throw him out and make him someone elses problem. The police should have been contacted to keep this guy off the street. Suppose he tried to drive and killed himself or someone else? As a business, Blue Martini failed and what they did was unethical and probably unlawful. Not to mention that no one in the establishment noticed him until I notified them. Also, what bartender was serving this guy? In TX we have this little thing called Dram Shop laws. Obviously that is not a thing in NV and its a shame.  Lastly, the staff at this place were inattentive and hurried. Whatever we ordered was dropped off and they quickly rushed away before we could ask for anything. So we were left with food but no utensils and hooka but no tips. My waitress also forgot that I gave her cash for my drink and accused me of not paying for it. We also made table reservations weeks before we arrived and 3 people came to out table throughout the night claiming there was no reservation.  It was just one thing after another with this place. A series of unfortunate events.",

However, the bar maid was leaving for the night and closed our tab and removed my beverage before I was finished. It took the new barmaid approximately 20 minutes or longer to serve us. I had told her what had happened but she didn't tell the manager and still charged me over $8 for a bottle of beer. I wrote \"F*$k.You\" and was later directed to the door like some 20 something year old thug by 4 bouncers with no compensation for our drinks. They even cleared my companies drinks from  our table which were not cheap. This place forgets hospitality, no managerial skills, and just want to create drama for upset costumers.

They have live music occasionally and some dancing, the music varies between bands and DJs, depending on the night/time.   Happy Hour is a good option here (drinks are 50% off), and some of the food is discounted. It can get really crowded, and all seating is on a first come, first serve basis.",

    "text": "Horrible customer service, super packed that you wouldn't be able escape if a fire broke out. I came here with a friend and it wasn't busy that night. It took forever for a server to come to our table, when we asked for help a girl ignored us. Then our server came and never told us her name or said hello. Asked us what we want to drink. We needed a menu. She got us one and left. We moved tables after awhile because we got cold. We mentioned this to our server. We told her we instead wanted hookah she said okay and left. She nor the hookah server came. So we tried to get our server's attention but she was more focused on the big group next us instead of all of us..so aftwr awhile I approached her to ask about ordering a hookah , who was going to help us and she got annoyed real quickly and said, \" she'll be over..\" Then I asked who and again she replied \"she'll be over.\" So I asked who and she angrily replied and pointed to thin air across the bar to a dark spot of the area, \"HER.\" I got fed up with the service I received and asked her why she is being so rude to me. And I walked away back to my table heated. She approached the big groups table all giggly and emty handed asking if they needed anything and then hung out with them and then came to our table and asked if we wanted anything and I said \"the manager please.\" She got mad and asked crazily, \" is there anything I can get you?!\" And I said \" Yes. The manager please.\" And she replied, \" there's not a manager on the floor right now.\" So I told her to \"bring me the highest rank in the place to speak to concerning my service.\" She left mad and returned with a fake boss, a party host! Who said he was the manager! I only found that part out from his co-worker..We go on to explain our time there and the server just stayed listening to us, with her head laying on her hand while she leaned on the table smiling at us because she knows she's being sneaky. The boss says that she's beautiful..and he gave us a free hookah..the hookah was disgusting..the smoke was choking us..just all bad..we stayed like less than 10mins after the free hookah and left. Horrible service. I think it had to do with looking broke because we came back looking great and the server began being all smily with us and nice. Do not judge a book by its cover. We may look broke, we may go to that spot, but we are certainly not broke or about that spot. Fix your damn employees and stay off Dirty Dining! Because I saw Blue Martini on Dirty Dining ..nasty af!

Martinis were very affordable and the food was good. Small portions but we weren't that hungry anyway. Our server was Angie and she was funny, polite and really took care of us. It was really busy so my friends appreciated the fact that she apologized in advance if our food and drinks were backed up. I advised her I wasn't big on anything too sweet and as long as it had vodka. She recommended the cucumber martini with cucumber vodka instead of the gin and it was delicious. Very refreshing yet strong. The music was great as well. I loved the live entertainment. This is definitely a place where I'll visit again on my next trip to Las Vegas.",

Pros: Great Happy Hour  Good Food Cool Atmosphere  Cons: Horrible waitress  Long wait times for drinks and food   I ordered the same drink for three rounds and each time it came out a different color.  My friend ordered a drink and was brought the wrong one. She didn't ask for a new drink she just told the waitress she ordered Pino Noir not Pino Grigio. The waitress responded with no I brought you what you ordered. Uhmmm okay attitude.   My opinion it's a cool spot for happy hour, just order two drinks at a time because the wait between could be 20+ minutes.",

    "text": "With nearly 230 reviews already written I'm not sure what I can say about Blue Martini that hasn't already been said. I generally don't drink martinis, but when I go to the Martini I always have a couple. The tini menu is so extensive that nearly everyone will find something that is to their taste. My favorites to date are the pomegranate and the Blue Martini. The pomegranate is pretty straight forward with the exception of the splash of grapefruit vodka they use. This gives it a bit of a citrusy edge that works well with the sweetness of the pomegranate. The Blue Martini is also a great blend of sweet and tart with OJ and sour mix paired with Blue Curacao and Cointreau.  The Lemon Drop, Cosmo and Three Chocolates are also very good.     We've never eaten at The Martini so I can't speak to the quality of their food. This is usual the starting spot for a mini pub crawl around Town Square (we save the eating for Cadillac Ranch or Yardhouse).    The Blue Martini is a great meeting spot and an excellent choice for Happy Hour. The ladies need to be sure to get a Blue Martini card, which gets you a free martini on each visit. Some folks may get a bit of sticker shock when they see the martini prices, but rest assured its money well spent. Your drink comes in an oversized shaker that holds the equivalent of two big drinks. As the more popular places in Vegas go, it's a pretty good deal.  Do be aware that Happy Hour is usually very busy, so get there early.",

At 9 the band comes out so there's live music, dancing and smiles :D They also have a hookah outside on the balcony if you are into that as well. there's always people to meet and it's a great place to go with friends and let loose",

It seems like the crowds only come around at night, so it is actually a very quiet and pleasant place to relax during the day. I love that the bartenders are actually knowledgeable about the liquors and menu. There are not too many things more annoying when your ordering a specialty drink, than dealing with an uneducated bartender that can't answer a single question you ask. The girl who poured my friend and I drinks was very knowledgeable, and therefore very helpful in assisting us with our drink selections. Beware that all drinks are poured with a heavy hand, and you are served not only your glass, but also the leftover shaker. If you have to drive home shortly after visiting, rethink your plans or get a cab.",

    "text": "Blue Martini has happy hour every day from 4 to 8 pm with all drinks halfpriced and some food items reduced as well. This makes the overpriced drinks reasonable, $5 to $7 a piece instead of $12 and up. For me, happy hour is the only time to bother with Blue Martini.  It should come as no surprise that Blue Martini gets pretty busy during happy hour. Finding a pair of available seats on a Friday afternoon can be a chore, thankfully on my last visit my girlfriend and I managed to snag the last pair of seats at the bar. We joked a bit about what we assumed the required bra size was for Blue Martini employees as we looked over the extensive drink menu. And then we waited. And waited. And waited a little more. Getting the attention of the bartender took far too long considering we were sitting at the bar.   After ordering a pair of drinks we decided to get the Shrimp Martini and the Charcuterie Board which, according to the menu was \"an assortment of dried, cured Italian meats and cheeses accompanied by a delightful mix of olives and fresh figs\". Both of these were reduced to $5 each. The shrimp martini was fine, 5 good sized shrimp. The Charcuterie Board was missing the figs, would have been nice if the server either warned us when we ordered or offered a substitute when she brought it out. She also failed to notice we needed silverware and napkins. It certainly seems that workers at Blue Martini are selected for their aesthetics rather then their customer service skills.  The drinks were also on the disappointing side. My friend had the Mango Madness which was made with mango puree (or at least was supposed to per the menu) as well as mango flavored vodka. This should result in a distinct mango taste but sadly, my friend could barely taste the mango. I went with the Fly Me to The Moon which included Cointreau, watermelon pucker and pineapple juice as well as vodka. The flavor was ok, the drink went down easy enough but I didn't feel any sort of buzz from it at all.   Overall we had a decent time but it could have been a lot better. I would have been highly disappointed if I had paid regular prices for anything we had. If you are at Town Square between 4 and 8, and craving a sugary cocktail Blue Martini is worth a stop but any other time? Not so sure...",

These people know how to treat those hard working strip workers. After a hard day (or hard day's night) of dealing with moron tourists (if you're not offended by that, you're not one of them), you head on over to Blue Martini and get a whopping 50% off your bill. Thank you, sir, may I have another.  The drinks are fairly good too. Not too weak, not too strong. It's like Goldilocks found Baby Bear's liquor cabinet. Juuuuuuuust right.  I hear the food is decent too, but we didn't have any.  Here's the problem though: my friend and I who went tonight are both 21+x years old (where x is less than 8). Yet when we went in, we felt really really young.  Really young.  Like, it shouldn't be called Blue Martini. It should be called Cougar Martini. There was more plastic surgery in there than Joan Rivers and Cher COMBINED. Those who hadn't had it done looked like Magda. (Ryan, did you just make a \"There's Something About Mary\" reference? Yup.)  And the music was lame. There was this godawful cover band playing, and when they finally said they were going to play something \"original\" it wound up being a fun little ditty called \"Please Don't F*ck With My Heart.\" So charming. Where's Simon Cowell when you need him?  Am I being too harsh? Too bad. When I go to a bar or lounge or club, I need good atmosphere and strong drinks. The drinks were okay but the atmosphere was terrible. But 50% off everything, can't beat that. So I'm not boycotting it, I'm just not going out of my way to go.",

I'm not sure if industry night is every night or if it's just Thursdays, but my group and I were able to get blue wristbands that could get us drinks for 50% off. Not bad of a deal, considering while most of their drinks are mediocre at best, their mojitos are pretty good (we all got different flavors: regular, raspberry, watermelon, mango! Yum!)  Their dance floor is little to non-existent, but I couldn't help dancing at our table to latin beats. Latin Nights seem to generate the crowds, and I have to admit their music is pretty good and upbeat. There was a live band, in which of course they themselves were mediocre and nothing entirely special (mainly did covers of top 40 songs). The food was a little bland; we ordered the spinach artichoke dip, chicken, beef, and rice plates, and they lacked considerable flavor to them.   I would recommend people hitting up BM for Latin Nights on Thursday nights, seeing as how I had a great time with the music and company despite how everything else was plain jane.",

The down fall there is that the flavor lasted all of 15 mins before it need to be \"ashed\" once that was done the flavor didn't taste the same at all. Tasted more like burnt coals than the flavor I asked for.  Wednesday is ladies night. Half off drinks I was told at the entrance. About 5 mins at the table before the hookah arrives I placed an order for a chilled shot of Hennessy. The hookah arrives first then a few moments later so does the shot. Keep in mind I'm expecting this one shot to be half price. No one at the door mentioned any stipulations nor did the waitress mention any when she took my order. I sat there and smoked my flavorless hookah and sipped on my drink. When it comes time to leave I ask for my card and tab. The Hennessy is listed for full price. I inquire about the half off drinks I was told about and the waitress needed to ask someone else about it. Hennessy is top shelf alcohol and is not an option for half off. That is not stated anywhere nor was I informed by anyone helping me that Hennessy is not available to be reduced. If I would have know that I would have ordered another type of cognac.  My main concerns were having to wait long periods of time in between getting the waitresses attention and her doing what I asked. The hookah was horrible. And nothing was done to accommodate this. The worst part was the manager  Shawn admitted the waitress was in the wrong and was going to do nothing about my situation. The best he could do was 30% off my shot.  Not good enough. A friend of mine speaks highly of this place and I experienced a totally different encounter.",

I let the company do the ordering and since it was happy hour they ordered food as well as drinks. The dirty martini I had inspired me to make it my new favorite drink. I order it everywhere I go now. Yummy salty heaven! We had some smoked salmon quesadillas that were small but delish. The other appetizers weren't memorable, but I didn't dislike any of it. After 4 of us had 2 drinks each and shared 3 appetizers our bill was still under $50. Gotta love happy hour prices!!!

    "text": "Ah Blue Martini, been to the club portion back in 2011 was alot of fun had a great time with a good girlfriend of mine, good drinks.   This time went there for a birthday happy hour night with another friend. Had some of the special martinis. Wasn't a huge fan of the one I had flavor wise but loved that for the price you get two martinis for the price of one. My friend was doing the hookah also she enjoyed it. Tried a few of the appetizers, artichoke dip with chips and lobster tacos. Definitely good eats. The lobster tacos were definitely something I'd have again. I switched to a mojito drink after martinis very good.   My only problem with the happy hour time was the music was too loud to enjoy the time there. My friend and I had to yell so much and we were right next to each other, and we were outside. Also had to hunt down waitress to get things to eat or drink. But do understand it was busy and happy hour. She was polite and calm, and quick once we got her. Overall would go back or recommend to people to go there for a good happy hour.",

The staff was friendly and helpful, the people are beautiful and the dj's are so on point. We were just there this past memorial day weekend on Sunday. The line was long as hell but nobody cared and when we were leaving around 230 am there still was a line of people waiting to get in so come early. We are going to start checking out the other nights of the week. They just announced Friday night live at the martini being broadcast on 97.5  radio station if you like hip hop and r and b. You won't be disappointed!",

There is indoor or outdoor seating available, which is fantastic depending on your taste. Trendy and up beat music is always playing. At night they have a stage for live music. I particularly love how spacious the lounge is so you can disappear in a comfy quiet booth.  The martinis are incredibly crafted with delicious design. A BIG value because you are given a full canister shaker with your drink to pour at your leisure, so basically another cocltail! The food is delicious as well, I reccomend the Margarita flat bread with no cheese and extra tomatoes.  Overall, I highly reccomend this place for a local bar or a tourist stop for cheap delicious drinks on the strip.",

    "text": "Came here for the first time on a Friday evening with some coworkers and I enjoyed myself. I arrived just as Happy Hour was ending, but that didn't stop me from indulging in a few of their martinis. Trust me, it was much needed after the work week that I had!  There is a lot of seating outdoors and heat lamps too, perfect for the colder Vegas nights. I noticed a dance floor and multiple bars inside. The bathroom was hard to find at first, but a kind employee pointed me in the right direction.   My martinis were delicious. Of course I had to order a Blue Martini, their namesake. Van Gogh Blue Vodka, Bols Blue Curacao, Sour, and OJ served on the rocks. If you're a fan of  L.A. Water or an AMF, you'd like the Blue Martini. The Starburst was just amazing! I couldn't get over the fact that this martini tasted exactly like my favorite pink Strawberry Starburst candy! Bacardi Dragonberry Rum, fresh lemons and limes, Cranberry, and Sprite make for the perfect drink. Definitely one of those drinks that will sneak up on you!  Our waitress Jillian was fantastic. She took care of us and kept us laughing! Loved her outgoing personality.  Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere at Blue Martini and my coworkers and I had a great time. It's a cool spot to come with a group of friends to wind down, or even for a date night drink with your special someone! It's a good alternative if you want to avoid a crowded nightclub on the Strip. I'll have to come back for Happy Hour soon! The appetizers look great!",

A group of friends and I went on a Sunday night for a friends birthday we didn't make any reservations so we knew there was possibly going to be a wait to get in. We arrived and the line for general admission was by the stairs close to mcfaddens and if you know townsquare thats a long line. Usually the club lines rotate from table reservations and general admission so we figured well get in maybe 40 minutes. Well TWO HOURS LATER we finally got to the front normally we would have left but my birthday friend was already inside and thats the only reason we waited but once in front I realized why the wait was even longer than needed the \"hosts\" in front would be approached by general admission people that slip them a $20 and there group gets put infront of this line. Its a ridiculous they dont value there customers because it wasnt even discrete the guy had told my two friends and me okay your next was about to let us thru until someone slipped him some cash and we waited another 25min at least. We had asked the host when we first arrived how much the cover was and we were told $10 once we finally got inside $20 for girls and $30 for men what a scam and worst experience inside was so crowded we didnt enjoy ourselves and when my friend asked for hookah service we were told yes one minute wellll that minute never came the girl never came back. Never again well stick to the places that actually value our service.",

Perfect for sharing over drinks. I tried the Raspberry Sage martini and the Strawberry Basil martini this time. My only criticism is the amount that was left in the shaker got very watered down. It was not sitting in the shaker that long either. They have tons of heat lamps outside so enjoying our \"winter\" weather is perfect. A side note not related to my specific visit but I am disappointed about the quality of the industry card program. I think this is Blue martini overall and not this specific location. I just do not feel like I receive the same treatment with the card like I did the app. Also, on a holiday, if I remember correctly it was Labor Day, they did not honor my card and wanted me to pay admission. I had brought my girlfriend who came into town to visit me there and we left. I get that it was a holiday but I'm local, industry, and it was 2 females.",

TO MY DISMAY, they didn't have baked brie like the last time I was there. I was sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo disappointed and just got whatever cheese platter they had. I mean, it's cheese....I love cheese; how bad could it be. Granted, it wasn't bad as there was goat cheese and baby bell cheese with lots and lots of fruits (grapes, berries, melons) but, it wasn't my baked brie that I love so well. Especially that BM made it drizzled with honey. ***I guess I'll just have to make my own***  Friends got the lemon chicken skewers, beef tenderloin, and the seared tuna. Lemon chicken skewers had orzo, instead of rice as its side. The chicken was as remembered but, the rice was overcooked. Beef tenderloin was cut thicker than previous so, it was \"different.\" Seared tuna was yum. Seaweed salad on the side was good but, a little slimy.  Overall, the food wasn't as good as I remembered it was about a year ago. Sadface!  The happy hour specials here are too good not to come back though.",

For the price they charge I expect them to use fresh mango puree at least . I asked the girl for a weak cocktail, I got a strooooong one. Maybe she thought I m kidding??? I did not like it at all. Just drank the water. She did not asked about why I did not touch it . Mister ordered a blue martini ? Not good either. Food wise we had the shrimps cocktail . It was good (1 star for the food) and the Brie with fruits (very yummy)   The girls there look stressed out and r not smiling at all. At least they r cute looking ( maybe that and the food attract the ppl, can't be the drinks) It was very busy because of the happy hour I guess.  On my way to the restroom , old men try to hit on me. Well this place seem to attract old single ? Or pretending single men and desperate over 40 ladies who maybe like it   Music was ok. Not too loud , we could talk to each other without yelling.",

    "text": "I came here for a Meetup.Com Happy Hour event on 10/6. The host of the event advised me to check in at the front for my Ladies ONLY vip card. When I arrived I was greeted by a brunette at the host station who didn't even bother to say hello let alone give a smile. She stated I had to be a Nevada card holder to get the VIP card. I am not really sure how that makes sense since they have numerous locations around the area but a free drink coupon isn't worth ruining my mood when going to hang with a bunch of people I have never met before.  I attempted to ask if anyone else from meetup had arrived she just stated \"Um well I think someone might be here but you'd have to look around\" .   Thankfully when I walked on to the patio a group of females spotted the fact that I looked like a deer in headlights and I was able to find where I needed to be. Once the host arrived she took over quite a few tables out on the patio. They allowed us to take up about 4-5 tables and the waitress who was helping us was VERY FRIENDLY and accommodating.  My low review is by no means due to her service. I felt she kept my drinks full and was super friendly. I wish I remembered her name but she was a tiny little pixie Asian female with beautiful long hair. She even recommended I check out golden spike. To be honest she was probably the saving grace for why I gave this place two stars at all.  The drinks were OK nothing special and if it wasn't half off for happy hour I would have stopped at one. I tried the Shrimp MARTINI. DONT BOTHER GETTING THAT. Its only 4 shrimp and not included in the happy hour appetizer special so it was 12$ I basically spent 4.00 per shrimp for a tasteless little tidbit.  Some of the other members of my group got the chicken skewers.  I enjoyed the Down Dirty Martini and the Cucumber Martini but the bus boy took my cup before I got to actually eat my cucumber which also didn't help this place become somewhere I want to return.  The Cake Pop Martini is super cute but the taste is like sweet milk and just wasn't for me.  Overall this place is worth it if you are going with a good group of people and you are prepared for the fact service can be spotty. I can totally see if I had a bad waitress how terribly wrong things could go as they have rules about splitting the tab but our waitress was great about taking cash. They did add on the 20% gratuity automatically since it was such a large group even though they gave separate checks. Personally I felt like that was lame to do without advising us not to mention it shorted the waitress out of larger tip because I was so taken a back by the fact they added it on. Now don't get me wrong I still showed her love for being good at her job but the management of this place needs to get everyone on board to provide good service.  The patio was nice and over all it is a good place to sit out and enjoy the company of people... Check it out but I would not pay a cover for this place.",

Our bartender Cassandra was one fastest and attentive I've ever had the privilege to watch. A smile and a thank you with every single transaction as well her head on a constant swivel. Paying attention not only to guests but her teammates as well. As we had no food our drinks were never empty and water was offered at nearly every exchange. We'll be back again soon!",

The appetizers were wonderful ( good amount of food and fresh for the price), and Stacy our server could not have been nicer. She was very informative, and constantly checking on our table. She is a 5- star server by far.  The only reason it lacked one star from me is because  the band came on and over powered the sounds in the first bar. It chased us out. My recommendation would be to start the band early like to you did, but maybe hold off on increasing the sound in the front bar until about an hour later. We were not the only ones that left around the same time, we think for the same reason.  Great perk for locals as well. Ask at the front desk. My friends and I will be back in the future.",

This place is great because you can dance, drink, eat, smoke the hookah. So much to do!  Its even nice to sit outside when its freezing because they have those heaters.  My biggest suggestion would be to buy a bottle and get a table. Most of those drinks are $15 - $20 each and a bottle is $150 - $200. So you will save yourselves a lot of money if you plan on drinking a lot or are with a group of people. Plus, you get a table where all the action is!",

    "text": "To wrap up our Memorial Day weekend, me and a couple of my colleagues came here. Upon arrival, the line was incredibly long, which wasn't an issue at all. We were happy to wait because this is one of our favorite spots to go to. I only mention the long line because after patiently waiting for an hour, at least 15 minutes standing at the door, the man working the door tells me I can't come in because I'm a male and my dress shirt has camouflage print. Since this is a venue we frequently recommend to our clients, we're very familiar with their business casual dress code. Even if you call the business, their dress code details mention nothing about this, nor is it posted anywhere at the door or on the website. Furthermore, we were confused as to why we spent 15 minutes at the door, had our IDs checked and were directed to this doorman if my attire didn't abide by the dress code to begin with. Regardless, THAT wasn't even the upsetting part. The door guy then says, \"if you slide me something, I can work something out\". At this point, it's discriminatory; they're picking and choosing which patrons they want to allow in. My camouflage dress shirt didn't prevent us from getting in, it was ONLY because I wasn't willing to tip out the guy at the door. It's extremely unethical, and I'm surprised that's the attitude Blue Martini has about its visitors and fellow industry employees. Even if I paid the guy, that would've left me less money to spend in the actual establishment on drinks, hookah, or whatever else. These door men are practically taking money from the venue's pockets! Furthermore, I'd like them to explain why \"because I'm a male\" my shirt can't have camouflage. Why does the assumption that I have a penis make my attire any more harmful than my female counterparts who easily could've been wearing a similar fabric. This is always the easiest recommendation we can make to our clients looking for entertainment away from The Strip, but we'd be embarrassed to suggest this place to someone who's spent time and money traveling here, follows the rules as they're provided, only to be turned away and insulted by soliciting bribes. This experience was shameful, sexist, unethical, and embarrassing.",

Positives: Great music Great happy hour menu Good food  Negatives: Had to wait 20-30 minutes at a time for the hostess to come get our order.  By the time our order was taking happy hour prices were over even though we arrived a full 2 hours before the cut-off.  Out hostess seemed like she didn't want to wait on us and wasn't friendly at all.  Overall I like this place but hopefully when I go back I will get someone friendlier and someone who is faster in taking food and drink orders.",

We sat at a table in front of the bar that explicitly did NOT have any sort of reservation sign or anything to indicate that it might be in any way exclusive. We ordered more than one round of drinks including a round of appetizers, and after they served us, they informed us that our table would be reserved at 10:00 for another group. They could have told us on advance, but they waited until we had already ordered and we're already obligated to pay. VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. Nothing was communicated effectively, and it ruined the entire mood of our night. When I asked a server, they said that people move the reserved signs all the time, and it wasn't their fault that we had sat at an apparently reserved table. They did NOTHING to inform us in advance of the way they operate, and as a result we assumed we would have the night to celebrate my birthday at the table. Instead, we were told we would effectively be kicked out at 10:00pm. Long story short, I will not be patronizing this place again. Their process needs to be clearly communicated at the beginning, otherwise it is extremely alienating, ELITIST, and off-putting, I don't care how close to the strip you are. A TERRIBLE way to treat your customers.",

I think that's pretty expensive considering we weren't at some premium nightclub.The service at the tables was basically non existent and I had to have the bf go to the bar to get our drinks.

From the humming noise coming from my husband I could tell he really enjoyed the lamb chops. I ordered the beef that was super tender. It came with fingerling potatoes and a small dressed salad all on one plate. We also ordered they chicken satay that were plump and also came came with a slaw. The chicken fingers were also served with a small salad. Like I said way too much food for two people. We've gone to the Blue Martini before and viewed people eating. The quality of food was outstanding. I forgot we also ordered the crab cakes. Being from Maryland, I'm always searching for the that Maryland crab cake taste. This was as close as any I've ordered. We went during NEO Soul Sunday happy hour so the prices were great considering I don't drink and my husband likes premium liquor. You've got to try it.",

I got 2 drinks, one savory and one sweet (the cake pop - really recommend that one!) The waitress was a very nice girl who provided awesome service, despite one of us unintentionally insulting her (LOL). I also like that you can order a hookah here, though we didn't this time around. My only complaints are that the food is a bit pricey, even during happy hour, and that we were constantly sprayed by misters that reminded me of sprinklers. Maybe turn those down a little? My hair and me were like \"Noooooo!!!!\"...but somehow, we survived..",

We've gone here a couple of times since we hate driving to the strip and it's closer to the I-215. NEVER go here on a Friday night since everyone is getting off work.  The blue martini signature drink looks just like ADIOS. For $6 during happy hour, you will only need just ONE. Again, this drink is definitely a creeper, so beware.  Also try the shrimp cocktail and bruschetta.  We can't wait for spring so that we can sit again outside the patio!",

    "text": "I've been here twice. Both times I was not impressed. The crowd... I would have expected a much younger one to be in attendance, but, it seems as if the place had been taken over by cougars! Eh, not my idea of fun!  First time I went with my boyfriend and another female, we sat on the patio. We had a hell of a time finding chairs, seeing as it was happy hour. We finally found a spot, and ordered our drinks from the bar and brought them back to the table. I did a little people watching... it was too early for some people to be drunk, in my opinion, but, then again, it's Vegas... what can you expect?   Second time I went was with a few lady friends and a couple guys. This time we went inside. We, once again, struggled to find empty seats and when we finally did, we were starving! We desperately looked through the menu, and honestly, none of the food sounded appealing to me, and on top of that, it seemed a bit pricey. I know it's called Blue Martini, and they specialize in those sorts of mixed drinks, but even most other bars have decently priced, simple, \"bar food.\" Anyway, by the time the waitress came around to take our order, which was 30 minutes after we were seated, we had already decided to ditch!  My review may be impaired due to the lack of alcohol in my system, but, I still have to say that IMO this is not a kick-it spot to me.  Anyway, my friends and I ended up having a far better time at Stoney's that night, even though we were overdressed!",

    "text": "It's really sad, but this place is like the watering hole for locals which is why, I guess, other reviews are so high. It's okay, but it's definitely not comparable to nice hot spots in other major cities. They've changed their menu a couple of times (to offer even LESS than their already bare food menu) and they are way overpriced. The only upside is that their martini menu offers a lot of choices..... The staff...that's a whole other can of worms. The female bartenders/waitresses wear the typical Vegas uniforms of corsets and tight pants, big hair, and lots of makeup and what comes with that is the typical poor attitude. Friendliness is hit or miss because some are nice, some are not so I guess it depends on the luck of the draw whether you get your orders taken in a timely fashion or if it takes all night. *shrug*....The music depends on the night (the have various specialty nights: Ladies night, Latin night, etc.) and they often host private parties. The do have a decent happy hour which is the best time to actually go there so you don't feel completely jipped by the prices.....about a year or two ago, they started having Hookahs available, but they are overpriced as well...Guess that's all a part of being in a setting away from the swarms of tourists.   Definitely give it a try, but don't expect it to live up to the hype. It's really not that great. Actually, I prefer the Phoenix one better. It's just blah, in my opinion.",

We had the artichoke dip and it was like any other. I am a fan of a dirty martini and got the choice of blue cheese stuffed or regular olives. When I said I wanted two regular, and one blue cheese the bartender gave me three of both! Yum! Hubby got the cucumber martini which is always refreshing. I like the individual shakers. It makes it feel like you're pouring two or three drinks (but really it's about one and maybe a quarter).

I was there on a Wednesday night, which is LADIES NIGHT, so we got all our drinks half off. Their Martinis are a good deal. For $7, you get the martini and the shaker they make it in, and it will refill your glass 3 more times!! So it's really like buying 3 drinks for the price of one.   Also, if you're a student and a female, bring your ID for a special card which will give you ONE FREE DRINK every time you come in :) I think that's pretty cool.   The atmosphere was fun, but it's not good if you want to have a decent conversation with your friends because you can't hear anything over the music. But it's fun if you want to shake it on the dance floor and just grab a couple drinks.",

Blue Martini is a cool place to go to for a drink after dinner with friends.  Last time i went was on a Monday and there was a country band playing in the main room. Outside was still okay playing hip hop and top 40.  Wednesday for ladies night is still their best night",

Here's what we ordered: Seared Tuna  Ahi Tuna, Seared, fresh and flavorfull and i liked the seaweed salad they gave us with it.  Charcuterie Board An assortment of Dried, cured Italian Meats and Cheeses Accompanied by a Delightful Mix of Olives and Fresh Figs... i liked this but it wasn't traditional cheeses, it was actually store bought and put on there... one of them was the boursin cheese that is prepackaged at teh grocey store and the served those little wedges of cheese, i forgot what their called but u can find it in the cheese aisle at the store... so a lil disappointing but what can you expect from a bar i guess?  Margherita flatbread... Vine Ripened Tomatoes, Fresh Italian Cheeses, and Fresh Basil.... always love a simple ' pizza'  Sliced Beef Tenderloin Perfectly Marinated Hot Beef Tenderloin Medallions... this was delish! meat was so tender and really good.    we ordered all this food and bellinis for 3 and the bill only came out to $50.  can't go wrong!",

Popped in here last night after 2am. Yes, I was sober, so yes, I can judge. Crowd was mixed. Lots of mountain lions more commonly known as cougars.   Pete's Dueling Piano Bar (just across the way) closes at 2, so the overflow crowd comes here. My friend ordered a Dirty Martini. I think that means this individual chose to get drunk. I respect that. It looked quite vicious, and came with the shaker for the overflow. Wow. I used the word overflow twice in one paragraph. Who AM I?  This music is fun. Your usual top 40 \"jams\". Apparently there was a cover charge, but my friend and I pretended like we knew what we were doing and walked through the \"other side\" of the ropes, cuz that's how we roll. Also, I'm kind of a big deal. Ok. Maybe not. But I like to think I am. Don't judge.  Outside has a fairly large hookah section with a couple of TV's that show ESPN highlights. Friendly for the gentleman crowd.  Fun place to hang out. Club vibe, without it actually being a club. Single women dancing with eachother and making out for attention. (That gave it an extra star. I started writing this with three stars).   Worth a visit. I think next up on my Vegas list is Cadillac Ranch.   And it really isn't as douchy as my fellow Yelperations say. At least not at 2 in the morning. The party's still jumpin and my momma aint home. (Credit: Snoop Doggy Dogg)",

On a Saturday night this place is like a human car wash; bar is packed as well as the dance floor. We moved our way to the back smaller bar by the restrooms which was busy, but once a small group of girls left we had premium bar space for the rest of the evening. This place has a very long list of interesting and tasty martinis, even some called \"Skinny\" that are low on calories. I ordered myself a Cookies and Cream martini that kept me super drunk the rest of the evening. A ridiculously potent concoction with the rim covered in Oreo cookie crumbs. Delicious and it was served quickly and cost $12. Not too bad for a specialty martini.   Didn't really take too much heed of the people there as I was with a bunch of friends, but we did take ourselves to the dance floor a few times which was a lot of fun. Decent prices for a wide variety of drinks, the music was great, and the environment was pleasing.",

I don't really eat when I go here, but the few dishes I've tried were pretty good. With the large martini menu, everyone can find something here.  I don't appreciate the strict dress code. Stop taking yourselves so seriously. You are a bar...in a mall. I understand you don't want hobo-looking people right off the street, but come on.  I mainly don't think of coming here because of the prices. It's ridiculously expensive. The only redeeming factor is when I got a hospitality card that gives me 50% off food and drink all the time. If you go here, def take advantage of the happy hour when everything is half off. That's when it's worth it.",

    "text": "Anyone that knows me, or read a review by moi, knows that I disagree with Yelp Reviewers 9 times out 10 because I happen to think 3 STARS is a phenomenal rating.  But because of reactionary neophytes being hungry and enjoying a basic burger, they weigh in with superlatives like \"AWESOME\".  WOW, SHUCKS BATMAN.  I'm freaken glad for you.  But there's some responsibility in posting stuff.  I will not insult truly top-of-the-kingdom industry people by wagging my tongue over very good fare.  We all, as consumers pay a lot for the opportunity to eat mostly decent food and drink mediocre cocktails, so let's set the bar a little higher, ok?, so that real players can shine and excellence can make it to the forefront.  Nothing whacks me out  more than a waiter or bartender with an attitude. Spare me the peek at the boobs and serve me a great drink with a smile.  Why do I have to preface and preach on my day off?  If the forum was more fair I would write more reviews.  So for most of you, keep it unfair and you'll be spared my diatribes.  Okay, today the business at hand is Blue Martini.  I went there Friday after shopping because Tommy Bahama bores the piss out of me quite frankly, even though I love the place for happy hour.  High praise considering I wouldn't get caught dead in one of his shirts and if you see me in one, please shoot me on sight.  If I accessorize my house with one of his trinkets you have my permission to blow the place up.  They do some good happy hour apps and that basil, grapefruit thing martini always kept my babe pretty riled up.  Even though it takes four or so.  So I took my cousin and her friend along with the babe to TOWN SQUARE.  I like to consider myself very cool, urbane and still get unsolicited offers of sex.  The babe gets whistles and cat calls at funerals.  My cousin, I love her, one of the few in my family that I can say that about, and her friend are really great people.  They fly into Vegas every now and then to see things like POISON, Def Leppard and other fading icons of metal.  They look the part as well.  Meaning they have also faded in upkeep, but take on a more blaringly obvious stand-out-in-the crowd look in places like Vegas, Blue Martini, or standing next to the babe.  One of them is, let's say overweight, the other disheveled, and I say this because people are so worried about that stuff and lose all decency.  As if they shouldn't be allowed to go out.   It's sickening.  One thing to be treated like that in general, a whole other kettle of gefilte fish to get dissed by the staff.  We went to Blue for happy hour, 6 o'clock in the afternoon and my crew, \"the girls\" wanted to be on \"the patio.\"  Enough of this outside BS. After a Vegas sun day I'm an air condition gypsy.  I was fed up with a couple of clerks, and people not treating my Cuz, like the Queen I know she is.   She has buckos.  She spends like a drunken sailor in a whorehouse.  It wasn't bad but the first round of drinks was like I had to say thank you for being able to pay the girl.  I didn't order, my cousin's friend did, and it was watching every other patron in the bar get a drink before she could get the girl's attention.    So the drinks were good.  The babe loves Skinny Margaritas, even though she doesn't need them, the skinny I mean, and the CUZ and friend had some of those ridiculous martinis I will never even try, so who am I to comment.  They looked OK though.  Me, A straight Vodka Mart up, no olive or twist.  Why? It's going to be gone in a minute.  And bar olives are probably the most disgusting things on earth.  Yes, everyone loves them.  Forget it.  I know.  They are vile.  The fungus that grows on them probably keeps the western world from getting rare diseases.  It's vaccine for the masses.  So the next round we gravitated toward a different bartender.  I ordered.  Nice chick named Beth.  Actually, she's a great chick.  The babe immediately said that I have GPS for the babe with the biggest boobs but that's just not True.  Not exactly good for my ego but Beth was sweet to me, offered to run a tab, made a great drink for me, just me, girls weren't ready, and she looked past my shoulder and started a conversation with my babe about make-up and then my cousin about shopping and what the F she bought and how cool and she likes to shop here and there and check out this and that and go to that and here and two hours later my cousin had the best experience of her Vegas \"trips\" meaning she commented how service in Vegas is decent but can be \"cool\" or cold if you don't get my frequent incoherent switching of meanings or ramblings or run on sentences or fragments or just plain annoying everything.  Blue Martini is a pretty good place.  I've been there a few times.  Always had a decent time.  But this chick Beth made my cousin actually talk about it all night like it's the second coming of night clubs.  It's not.  But places would do better here if they made the experience like this one.  Thanks. B-to-B",

    "text": "This was my first time at Blue Martini. I went on a Monday night and entrance was free. They had an impressive rock band in the main bar call the Whispering Giants. Their covers of Kings of Leon and Red Hot Chili Peppers were good.   They obviously sell quite a few martini's; over twenty kinds on the menu. We tried 6. My top two from those were the Brazilian (Acai berry martini) good balance of scent, favor, and tartness & there Carmel martini- really good, very sweet. The prices range from 12-14 dollars which is a bit expensive; pay attention to the description of the martini, a few have top shelf liquor on the list of ingredients. You get more quality in some than others.   The patio area was nice and not very crowded; nice solid wood chairs, fine counter tops and intimate lighting. Good service and attractive wait staff add to the experience. One thing I enjoyed was that they had a bathroom attendant with all the bells and whistles including linen to wash your hands. Do tip, it shows class and character especially if you're spending already.   Those details lead me to believe the restaurant takes themselves seriously. I recommend ordering the fruit and cheese platter -serves 3 and the presentation is a delight. The cost is around 14 dollars but a value especially when split. I would avoid beer - no selection and wine - expensive unless you're a high roller. I saw a few groups doing bottle service. That could be interesting.   Until next time.",

    "text": "Ha, visited Blue Martini last night only a day after writing my original review.  Sat down at a table in in front of the main bar/stage, and was ignored for 10 minutes.  My friend and I made our way to a side bar and settled down there.    The bartender asks what we would like, and with my comment in my previous review (\"Servers have also told me that the 1/2 off price applies to mixed drinks with 1 spirit, though I haven't confirmed this.\") I asked the bartender if I could get a Manhattan at happy hour prices.  The bartender looked at me, and I could tell this was going to be a chore.  She said that she wasn't sure; I thought that she meant she didn't know if it would be at happy hour price.    Nope.  Well, yes, she wasn't sure about the happy hour pricing.  But her first concern was \"What's a Manhattan?\"  ... ... ...That's the kind of person who will ask what you think of their personality, and I would respond by patting their head and telling them that they were very pretty.  After staring at her and wondering how she got her job, I explained what a Manhattan was, and told her that I wanted bourbon whiskey.  She then proceeds to another bartender at one of the outdoor bars and has him make the drink for her.  She comes back and tells me that yes, it will be at happy hour pricing, but they had to use Jack to make it discounted.  Well, Jack isn't bourbon.  But hell, at least I finally got a drink.  Star gets knocked off for having incompetent bartenders.  I'm thinking that this lady was only capable of making whats on the menu and opening beer bottles.  Which when I noticed, was what all the other guys were drinking at the bar I was sitting at.",

    "text": "Our Saturday night adventure continues at Blue Martini. We have this friend Mr. W who we hang out with, and he wanted to find some live music. (I know it sounds like a James Bond character, but he's really Mr. W.) He had seen live music at Blue Martini before, and we are generally up for whatever, so the caravan took sail for Town Square.  Pulling into the Town Square parking lot I was shocked to find what seemed like thousands of cars. I had no idea that the nightlife was so well attended at this south Las Vegas Blvd shopping center. The triple punch of Martini, Yardhouse and Cadillac Ranch generates a large crowd.   Alas, we did not find live music at the Martini, as after midnight, there is no longer a band, just a DJ pumping hip-hop tracks. I was shocked once again to find such a motley crew of people inside Blue Martini. From a transvestite to an international banker to some left over disco-themed patrons (there had been a live disco band earlier), there were all shapes and sizes getting their collective groove on. This is a good thing to me, but the truly happening Thunderdome vibe was seriously undercut by the \"chic\" Applebee's interior and the impromptu, mini dance floor. I am just opposed to dancing in a restaurant, especially a chain restaurant, where the dance floor is created by pushing the tables into a corner.  The cocktail selection was obviously a wide selection of creative martinis. I realize it is called the Blue Martini, but I appreciate a bit more brain power behind my cocktails because I am very indecisive when it is time to place my order. I am tired of bartenders \"surprising\" me with Seabreezes and other fancy fruit punch concoctions. Fruit punch is not too surprising. I guess I will have to go back to my standard tequila neat.  As for Blue Martini, it just failed to deliver an experience I would want to repeat: notable people watching, but in a stale environment. The search will continue for live music.",

It was sweet, but came off strong - just like the bartender ;)  The vibe was chill, and seems like a cool local spot in Town Square.  I personally dig the live music factor and local feel.

Was so thirsty and took them 20 min to get me water. I can understand if they were busy, but they were not at all.

They have a wide selection of martinis and other crafted cocktails. Some of our favorites are the dirty martini, pear martini, lychee martini and the morning after cocktail. They have a large outdoor seating area with an outdoor bar as well. Service is always inconsistent and there are times when it's easier to order a drink at the bar instead of waiting for someone to come to the table. Getting a table has never been an issue when I've gone with my friends which is usually between 4-730pm any day of the week.   Food menu is limited to appetizers only such as flatbreads, dips, fruit and cheese plate and other simple varieties. No wow factor with the bites but they are also half off during happy hour.   Overall and good local bar/lounge with fun cocktails and martinis that I will continue returning to.",

Very cool lighting, ladies room was elegant with lots of room. The music was excellent. I danced all night. My feet were so sore the next day but totally worth it. I will definitely come back here again. To all the blue martini staff. Keep up the good work! This place is awesome! Looking forward to visiting again soon.",

They're response \"You have to buy a table, the cost will be $225 to $250\" I'm like ok we're in Vegas..Let's do a table with Grey Goose which was $250, no problem..the host informs us that the 250 doesn't include my tip still not a real problem but definitely a red flag..tip her 20 bucks..Fast forward, me and my girl are having a amazing time, live music in which the band was descent..ask for our bill..almost $400 bucks they said the bottle service was taxed, the gratuity was also included with in the bill and we told the manager the girl told us to give her a tip he said she should not have done that lol..I told the manager and our hostess I'd be writing a review so here it is... My advice to you Blue M is not to gauge people who are already paying top dollar..Out",

Yes please! I had a blast, danced till I was sweaty (ew, I know) and drank till I was drunk (took advantage of having a designated driver). It was such a great time! I love their martini's. Drink of the night for the most recent drink was a grapefruit martini, it was slightly sour, not too sweet, and packed a good punch.  Blue also has Latin Nights on Thursdays, I think. Plenty of comfy seating, several different rooms, balcony, stage for live performances, and a dance floor. The dance floor could afford to be bigger, a lot bigger. It tends to get pretty packed. I have never been to Blue and not have a good time. The music is always good, kind of a mixed crowd, and always delicious martinis. I have never tried their food but hear that they have a good happy hour. Will try that at tome point.",

The cocktails are creative and fun, and OMG the Creamsicle martini is like drinking an ice cream treat with a kick!! Also had the Brazilian, the Jalapeno Passion Fruit, the old fashioned, and a habanero martini. Worthy!   We had the shrimp cocktail, tuna ahi, beef and portobeallo flat bread, and spinach and artichoke dip. All were really fantastic, and as a side note, the calamari with the tuna ahi was tender and flavorful!   Drinks were fast and delish, the food was perfect nosh for the drinks, and the service was spot on. Happy hour (from 4-7pm) has great prices.   Our server Angie was fun and funny, and really had some great suggestions to enjoy the meal and drinks. Glad to have someone take care of us so well.   We will return and recommend to anyone.  :)",

When we walked inside the place twice in circles, there were many empty tables but everything was reserved. When we ask for a table to sit because we also want to eat, we were told we can sit on any table marked reserved but if there is another customer who gets a bottle service, they will have to take away the table from us. What? We have to move while we have plates and still eating.. just to give to a customer who will pay their bottle service? We didnt want any of that so we ask how we can get refunded of the cover charge. Worker said the same things again. Really.. all sales are final.  So not worth to hang out here and ruin our Saturday night. We are kind people so we just gave up on our concern and also gave up on our money to them even though we were there for less than 5 minutes just looking for a table to sit.

    "text": "I've been putting off writing this review as I've been hoping things would change, but unfortunately this location has disappointed me and my girl over and over again.   After 2 years I finally found myself moving back to Las Vegas and remember having such a great time with excellent service here at Blue Martini a few years back and was excited to make this spot my go-to spot for Happy Hour once again. I've only been back to Vegas for 3 months and have probably been here almost every weekend since being back. Every time I come, I come at opening so I can take full advantage of the Happy Hour.   The place is NEVER busy during the couple of hours that I'm here, yet the service is super slow and many times I'm just ignored totally. I'm not sure if it's because I'm not a \"single\" guy and I always come with my girl, but on multiple occasions, we sit and have to wait 10 or more minutes for a girl to come around just to bring us our water and to take our first drink order and there may only be a handful of other people there. The girls will stand around the bar and do their talk and adjust their tops and put on makeup/fix their hair. If the place was super busy I could understand having to wait for drinks, but if you have time to stand around, you have time to take care of your customers.   Except for the last two times we've been here, the girl serving us will be attentive for the first 15-20 minutes and then not even look our way. We've had to call someone else over on several occasions to have her tell our server that we want to order more drinks or food. Several times our server is just talking and has her back toward us the whole evening!   Another very bad negative in our book is the Hookah girl/serve. The last few times we've been here we've wanted to do Hookah and had all intentions to use the service, but the girl was very rude! First off, since we come first thing when they open up, she doesn't have the hookah menus on the tables yet so she gets around to it fairly quickly, but she always passes over our table and never puts a menu on it! We always have to get a menu from another table and she still doesn't come over and ask if there is anything she can help us with. This last weekend, we were at Blue Martini and the same thing happened, yet this time she made eye contact with me and immediately processed to smile and talk with two guys that were sitting alone!! I'm am beyond belief right now. I can't see how she can treat people like that. The whole 2+ hours we were there, she served 3 tables and all were tables of single people. Two tables of guys and one table of just girls. I don't want to say that she only wanted to cater to \"single\" people, but that is how I took it, especially since she never even came to our table and asked if we wanted anything. Before when I used to live here, the hookah girls would always come around to almost everyone's table and ask if they wanted to do Hookah, but not now. The girl acts very stuck up and has no personality. Would never use the Hookah server at Blue Martini if she was the girl working that department.   Other then that, the drinks are excellent and strong and are very reasonable if you come during happy hour. The food also is hot, delicious and always comes out quickly. Restrooms are almost always clean and stocked whenever I'm here. The inside is clean and very organized. The patio area could use more fans or something to help keep people cooler in this hot weather.   This place just needs to work on the people that work here, especially the girls. The customer service here is very lacking. I've been tempted to just leave because of how I and my girl are treated (or the lack of).   Will I come back again? Yes of course. I love the enviroment and of course the excellent drinks.",

And we told her we wanted to order off the menu, she showed no interest at all, not even a \"I will get someone for you.\"  In closing go and enjoy the music, but do not expect any type of customer service good or otherwise, because they are clueless on the concept of good customer service.

It was only the hookah girl with piercing in her cheeks that made the experience bad. Our hookah stopped working 15 minutes after we got it and took her 45 minutes to get her over to us after us after we requested her multiple times. She finally came over and tells us to pick a new flavor and she would fix it?? Meaning another $30?? Super rude about it!!! The hookah wasn't even blowing at this point I'm still going to give it 5 stars because the manager Victor and the new hookah host Melissa understood the whole situation and fixed it but a new hookah server needs to be hired because it was no where near that busy for the service we received.... btw I hate bad yelp reviews but she was really THAT HORRIBLE!!!",

On a given night you could expect to see a group of people that may look like the channel 4 news team, a crew of gangsters, a set of latin Milfs, and a guy who looks like a pirate (minus the bird on his hsoulder of course).  This is a fun place but from my experience the party starts late here. The drinks are strong and this pace is Yelp friendly! They recently had a promo where yelpers could get 25% off your entire bill. They have a stage for live music and this place is pretty big too!",

The patio bar area was packed so we chose a table at the inner bar where a band was setting up.  Our waitress came over and took our order.  We ordered a gin martini and a vodka martini and due to us not calling liquor we were poured premium booze for which there was a $2.00 up charge per drink.  For dinner we ordered hummus and the Perfectly Marinated Hot Beef Tenderloin Medallions.  The hummus was good, but the portion was rather small.  However, the beef medallions were amazing.  They were super tender, cooked to perfection and extremely tasty!    As we were enjoying our drinks, we became aware of the fact that it was warmer in the bar than it was outside, which was rather off putting and the reason we didn't have another drink.  We asked for our check and presented a coupon we had purchased through Living Social.  The waitress became hesitant and said that she didn't think they would honor the coupon due to the fact that people had been printing off the same coupon multiple times and using them over and over again.  We pointed out that each coupon has a specific one time use code to prevent this, but she insisted that was the issue.  She went and spoke to a manager regarding the issue.  She came back and stated that the manager refused to honor the coupon; however, the manager did not bother to come out and talk to us about this issue.",

    "text": "My wife and I thought we would give the Blue Martini a try on a weeknight because we were already in Town Square. We arrived at about 9:30pm to find a couple friendly people sitting at the front desk, which was a nice change. We took a walk through and found that it was mostly empty so there were a lot of open tables available. They had a band playing on the main stage but the music was kind of depressing - we sat down and ordered a drink anyway. I ordered a Grey Goose martini, extra dry with an olive and my wife ordered a Chopin martini with a twist. They arrived at our table about 15 mins later. Both martinis tasted like they contained about 2 oz. of vermouth, 1/2 oz. of vodka and 5 oz. of water. They were served warm and tasted like vermouth flavored water. They were, without a doubt, the worst martinis we have ever tasted!   After we choked down our martinis, we figured that we would give them one more chance and ordered something easy: Captain Morgan and diet Coke. Our drinks arrived fairly quickly this time but the drinks were served in what appeared to be 4 oz. glasses filled with ice! I have had larger drinks at a strip club! To add insult to injury, the bill arrived and we were charged $17.00 for the GG martini, $18.00 for the Chopin and $10.00 for each Capt'n and diet! The strange part is that I'm sure they listed GG martinis on their menu for $12.00 along with just about every other type of martini. I wonder if those ones had some alcohol in them? When we asked for our check, the waitress quickly dropped it off at the table and ran off, never to return. I guess if I were charging those prices for that drink quality, I would be embarrassed too! Maybe they figure that by 10:00 on a weeknight, anyone still up and drinking is too drunk to realize what is happening! We ended up leaving some cash on the table and walking out.    It looks like the Blue Martini has become just another Las Vegas tourist trap! I wish I could give negative stars!",

We chose to sit on the huge outside balcony...so the music wasnt overpowering and you could hold a good convo. Plus the crowd out here was more chill too... on the inside it was a bit too douchey I thought. They also had hookahs (bit $$ but oh well) to smoke out there too, a pleasant surprise.

One birthday, I thought it would be a great idea to try half of their martinis in one night. The signature blue martini is delicious, if you like an AMF, you would love this drink. Most of their martinis are just variations of mixed drinks. The only one that I would suggest avoiding is the Almond Joy because the coconut irritated my throat.   The food here is nothing special. If you can hold out, go to Yardhouse for dinner and beer at their happy hour. Remember, beer before liquor never been sicker. Liquor before beer, you're in the clear.",

If that is what you are looking for, swing a stick and you will hit 5 of them. There is a PT's pub on almost every main road. And this isn't one of those places.  It's a martini lounge. And I like the principle of the $10.00 cover charge, because it helps keep the rabble out. Ten dollars is not a ton of money. And seriously, if a ten dollar cover is tough for you to come up with; you should probably be out looking for a better job rather than stewing over that. Think of it as a public service fee for discouraging the dregs of society from being in attendance. And even with it being that simple of a concept, it works! I bring my customers here and they always have a good time. And I don't have to worry about them ending up in a bar fight with a bunch of blue-collar tools. Moving on .... Happy hour is a bargain IMHO. The martinis they pour are potent and made with good label vodka. I agree that it can get a little pricey if you aren't enjoying happy hour. But its on par with what you will pay on the Strip for a double martini. The simple solution is to do the bulk of your drinking during happy hour, which runs from 4-8PM.",

    "text": "Little to pricey for my cheap ass :) I understand this is Vegas and all but this is way off the strip at Town Square where not a whole lot of tourists go. It cost $20 for guys at the door and beers were $7.  I've been coming to Vegas for years and did the ridiculously expensive club thing back when I first started coming. Now I love to do Vegas cheap and for me that is not possible at Blue Martini.  On the upside the place is huge and separated into 3 different areas. The main area in the middle has the sage set up right behind the bar. So that was a pretty unique site to see.  The service was great. I opened up a tab with one bartender and every time I came back up to the bar she saw me waiting and asked me what I needed right away even though it was crazy busy.  Overall cool spot but I wouldn't go unless I had a little more cash flow ;)",

Due to no one directing the lines there were multiple times where big groups of people walked up and were let in and our line had not moved. We supervised this happening multiple times and when we asked Security why this was happened they just continued to say you guys are next. An hour later we were still in line and seen multiple individuals being let in. After living in Vegas for 4 years I had never been to place and heard good things but unfortunately I can't say its a place I will go back too. I've gone to way bigger clubs/bars than Blue Martini and I've never waited in line for 2 hours in Vegas. If I could give this place no stars I would.",

It's a perfect place for a girl's night out or a little birthday gathering ~  I really like the fact that they have multiple bars & different areas to sit. They also offer hookah on their patio area! There drinks are a little pricey but they have happy hour until 8 everyday!!! All of their \"skinny\" drinks are so yummy! And their chicken skewers are delicious and moist!!! Wednesdays are great for ladies Happy Hour ALL night and they usually comp a bottle of champagne to groups of 6 or more ladies! Shout out to JayRay A. who is a great VIP host!!!   Hot Tip: if you work in the hospitality industry bring a pay stub and get a VIP Blue card which gives you half off of drinks & apps when it's not Happy Hour! Meaning... Don't ever pay full price!!!!! Yay~",

We usually go when it is happy hour and you cannot get a better deal! The drinks and, if hungry, food menu are vast and 1/2 price. The fruit and cheese platter, Brie bake, artichoke and spinach dip, crab and shrimp dip, Margherita pizza, and Thai chicken have all been tried on different occasions and they are all really good! My favorite drink is the Sangria Fusion, yet the Mojitos and Martinis are outstanding, and the wine list is also very good. The service is always friendly and upbeat! So going back and highly recommended.  Happy hour times: noise average level. Evening: really loud as music.  Has full bar and for nighttime, no shorts.",

    "text": "When I first moved out here, I would say that I was here on average of every other week.  Obviously came for the drinks, ambiance, and sometimes their food.  But keep in mind, food here is basically appetizers.  I have to admit, their seared Ahi is too legit to quit.   My last time here was Halloween this year.  I had to pay $20 to get in while my friends only had to pay $10 (ladies got it good).  Regardless, not use to having to pay to get in, but I guess that's Hello Ween for you.  Place was packed as expected inside and out.  Everyone was in costumes and after a couple of drinks, it got a bit old.    Drinks are fairly cheap considering...far cheaper than a club or a gentleman's club.  I use to come here prior to hitting the strip just because their drinks are cheaper.  One note though, sometimes their drinks are watered down.  Let them know, and they'll take care of it.  Just don't forget to tip.  I don't frequent this place as much as I did about a year ago, but it's a nice visit every once in awhile.  Place is usually locals, but I do recommend for tourist.  A nice change for sure.",

They have some great specialty drinks but ordering regular drinks is a rip-off  Ordered a titos and pineapple and was served the smallest cup ive ever recieved. The girl poured about 2 seconds in a 1 oz gigger (filled halfway) and about 2 more seconds in the cup essentialy a 1 oz drink. Super clubs like omnia/xs etc. Do charge more but at least they give you a decent drink for 17 dollars instead of a joke drink for 11 here (pictured). Next time offered off of the specality menu and the drink was much better (bullit manhattan).",

Walking in here can be intimidating, especially when packed; the place is huge, like \"where are we allowed to sit?\" When it is so packed and we have to sit in the corner I get nervous on how the service will be; it usually starts out slow but ends up being OK.   I went there recently while shopping at Town Square, about 5mins till they open (it's only Aug and 1000 degrees out) and they wouldn't seat us. I am not letting it get to me too much but WTF?!?! We ended up at Tommy Bahama's restaurant next door which was just decent.  Also BEWARE; Blue Martini does not have ranch dressing. Silly right? No big deal, I guess some places don't but it caught me off guard.  Go for their awesome HH tho!",

The hookah lady said she will get her to get the orders but she forgot.. Instead we went to the bar and got our drinks. Service is so terrible.. staff shouldn't be flirting at all and staying with the 3 guys that were shining their cellphones on her. Finally sat on a different table. A different waitress approached us perfect and quick. But we already got our drinks from the bar in less than 5 minutes.

When we got there the band would play then the DJ would Spin... (alternating) place was packed but not to where you COULDN'T MOOOVVE! 3 different bars. I didn't experience the other bars, but we stayed in the middle bar area with the dance floor.   GREAT crowd: ages ranging from 23-55ish, but you know blk don't crack so faces were looking young. Lol. Girls night out... fellas night out.. couples were left & right, so mini date night/evening outing is great too.   Dress code ranges from casual to LBD and dark jeans/slacks and a sweater however you pair it fellas, either way a thumbs up. Better to come over dressed than under dress kind of thing...  Music was hip hop & R&B.   Didn't get a chance to eat, but we had 3 apple Martinis that came up to about $50 and some change. That's after happy hour.   Other than that, this place is a must EVERY SUNDAY when I get a chance to come to LV and here on Sunday instead of leaving on Sunday!!",

My horrible experience happened when I woke up the next morning to see that the tab I closed out in cash was double charged to my bank account. No issue normally so I call the place to get my dispute settled to find out that there isn't even a manager on staff DURING business hours to handle my problem. Instead I get a condescending employee asking how much I spent and since it wasn't a big charge I shouldn't worry and to call another time when the manager is actually at work. What does the amount have anything to do with it? If I spent $1000 then he'd fix it? Now I'm gonna have to call the bank to cancel the transaction. I'm not worried about getting the money back, the bank will settle it in the end. It's the principle of the customer service fixing a problem THEY DID. Completely unprofessional to say the very least. Buyer beware, make sure you check you charged closing out with cash.",

It was Saturday afternoon and the weather was beautiful so obviously day drinking outside was the logical activity. We also needed new shoes from a store at Town Square so this was an obvious choice.   We arrived around 5 on Saturday and the hostess told us that seating was open. Most of the seating available was at the bar or inside, but we were able to snag one of the few outdoor patio tables available. As soon as we sat down our friendly waitress greeted us and provided waters. She checked in several times while we were there and our waters continued to be filled.   The drink menu was impressive. They offer plenty of different drinks ranging from martinis to mix drinks to white and red wines. It was one of the lengthier mixed drink menus I've seen lately.   My Pomerita had more of a sweet taste than a boozy taste. It was light for a summer evening. My husband really enjoyed his Bombs Away.   This is a nice spot to enjoy a drink with a group or as a couple on a nice evening.",

In Las Vegas .......Sunday it was my  roommates brothers 48 birthday he is mentally challenged about 15 of us got there around 4pm the first thing i did was go to the bar their was not one customer there i stood in front of 2 bartenders not one said a word to me when I  asked about ordering a piece of cake for our birthday boy the male bartender told to go sit down and wait for a waitress no one came by so I went back and asked a waitress she came by we looked at he the menu and choose a piece and told her we would like it after we ate we ended up sitting outside because they would not let us save seats for the rest of our party we had a lot a food a lot of drinks we even had the hookah the service was so slow  and when we asked the waitress where our food was she replied we're busy ok but when it came time for the piece of cake for our birthday boy they said we didn't order it so my roommate went to the bar and they said they didn't have time to bring it to us. So my roommate and I went to the manager 'greeted by a rude waitresses\" and waited to speak to him the waitress immediately started yelling to him saying my roommate was harassing the help wevwere shocked we explained to him what happened he said he had to speak to his staff first ..then never came to look for us but we found him of course he believed his staff the result was we never even got offered the   $8 piece of cake to sing Happy birthday!!! So if you have a Mentally Challenged loved one or if you want good service don't go there....",

They wanted to kick my friend out because he was supposedly too intoxicated yet they were willing to let him stay if I paid them money. I said so he's too drunk to be here but if I pay you he can stay? Rashad the security there said in his own words \"If you break me off we can look the other way\". So when I didn't want to pay him he decided to move forward to start getting my friend out when he was sitting in the table, non aggressive. It's a bar and it's Vegas so I guess you can't spend too much money in drinks there and enjoy yourself without them trying to squeeze you for more money. I took it to the manager and instead of him telling his security something he went and condoned that kind of behavior. I imagine he makes a percentage from all the money they extort from his patrons. Whoever the owner is, I feel bad since his own security is setting them up for a huge liability. Hope they fix the extortion issue and that they are fair with everyone.",

We initially came here on a Wednesday night and it was jam packed inside and out. Little did we know that on our girl's night out we stumbled in at the right time to enjoy Ladies Night. Call it dumb luck. The drinks were delicious and at half price even more delicious. Love how they bring your drink in a cocktail shaker that give you at least two fill in your martini glass. Oh and then there's Industry night on Mondays. Definitely a smaller scene than Wednesday but made for a great outdoor patio party. The dj was on point.   I have loved every cocktail that I've tried here. My favorites by far are the Chyna Doll and the Summer Fling. Both are sweet, though not too sweet, and flavorful. I've tried my friends cocktails and seriously have yet to try one that I haven't liked.    Simply love this place. It's away from the whole casino/strip scene which I appreciate and then to consistently have good service, great music and yummy drinks, how is one to stay away?",

We get there and the vibe is ok, we figured let's get our drinks and see how the night goes. We get to the bar, the bartender asks us what we want, give our order and then he just disappears. We probably waited 15 minutes thinking maybe they ran out of something and he went to the back. That wasn't the case! He completely ignored us! He comes back starts making drinks thinking it was ours and nope! A group of guys come up they exchange hello's saying they just got there and he hands them drinks. We're like ok maybe he'll make our drinks next. Nope, he went on to other people at the bar and started making theirs. Seems like you have to be a regular to get acknowledged. We wanted to give this place a chance but with that kind of service we decided to leave.",

I've only sat outside in the patio area which was nice (and even better when it wasn't too hot). But the last time I was here, I walked inside to use the restroom and noticed the inside atmosphere/vibe was also really nice. So you would probably be fine either way.  Food-wise- I've had the seared tuna, lobster salad, both the margherita and beef tenderloin flatbreads, and others.  All have been quite good.  I would recommend this place and would totally come back.",

    "text": "First let me start by saying I hate leaving negative reviews. I'd just rather not even leave one. In fact I took some time to really think about what transpired before leaving this review. Didn't want emotions to overtake my ability to be fair. I was in town for a wedding and I'd heard so much about this place. The first day we tried to go they had not opened yet. We went back a few days later. First the hostess was on the phone when my part of 4 walked in she never looked up to greet us and never made eye contact. She muttered she needed to see our ID and that we could sit anywhere. Already I'm thrown off, do your job and greet people properly. As we were told to sit anywhere we did, found a booth. We were ready to kick back have some drinks, food and hookah. We sat for at least 10min and no one I mean no ever came over to assist. We keep seeing other people receiving service. We are now becoming irritated. The hookah service is provided by an outside company and the hookah girl was the only person to give notice to us. We asked for the manager. Now I don't know who hired this lady but she (manager) was HORRIBLE!! We explained to her how long we had been sitting with no help. Not once did she apologize or even try to make the situation better. She simply told us the waiter was late as in late to work. Remember I explained we were told to sit anywhere. In fact the \"manager\" made it seem like we were wrong for pointing out to her how terrible the service had been. I didn't get her last name but her first name was Lana. The general manager really needs to know just how horrible the customer service is in this establishment. If I could give it no stars I would. After the way we treated and the way Lana spoke to us we were ready to leave. The only positive feedback I have is for the bar manager Christian, he saw how we were \"handled\" came over and apologized he even gave us complimentary drinks. He is the only bright spot in this joke for a restaurant/bar.",

I've only been to Blue Martini a few times, but I've enjoyed it each time (one of those times, a little too much).  We went here last night for a friend's birthday. The place wasn't as packed as the last time I remember. I was surprised to see that there were more girls than guys last night. I'm not sure if that's the norm. I only had one drink - a Caipirinha Martini. I love a good Caipirinha and this martini version tasted pretty good. The live band they had last night was fun to listen to. Their set had a good mix of old and new. I believe they are named after their lead, Gregg Peterson. Unfortunately, after they stopped playing, the music reverted to a generic blend.  Obviously, the drinks here are overpriced. You just come to expect that from Vegas. You'd have to show up before 8pm for their happy hour to get a better deal on drinks. I also noticed the 25% Yelp discount thing before I came, but I completely forgot about it last night. On the other hand, it looks like service industry workers can get a wrist band and get half price drinks.",

What kind of establishment won't make toilets unavailable for customers? Staff doesn't even care for the customers condition. One guy from the staff even pointed us to a restroom at the next establishment and made us walk a long way only to find out its closed too! WTH! Restrooms are a necessity for establishments serving alcohol and we are so disappointed that the staff doesn't even care. What a bad experience!",

Location - 4 Star.  being in Town Square has a definite cool factor about it. Although parking is a bit of a walk and signage for this place is poor, if you like TGIF or such places thin BM is fine.  b.  Ambiance - 3 Star - Suburb Chic at it's finest. This is a typical bedroom community bar for younger people overall. Nothing really great, however, it is busy and crowded.  c. Service - 2 Star - For 100+ people, they have two servers?  And they have no system and the free drinks are not free, or sort of but confusing.  Very odd and very unaccommodating.  There is really not much to say about this place.  It is a huge suburban bar and many people drink here. It is something that is generic and replicate in most suburbs. Not bad, not special, it just is.    Fun place overall, and not a bad place to hang out and meet friends.",

Needless to say everyone gave me the run around and the only person willing to help was the cocktail waitress Stacy she was amazing!  When it came to getting a hookah Samantha was our hookah host with a horrible attitude and not helpful at all. Our hookah was terrible, couldn't even smoke it because it was hitting hard. We asked her if she could fix it and all we got was her attitude and dirty looks, so we grabbed a fork and fixed it ourselves. Darlene saw us struggling and came over to help, she was very nice and helped us fix Samantha's mess.   Overall the concept of this place is amazing with live music great patio seating and everything, unfortunately their customer service skills and unwillingness to help accommodate a large party ruined it for us.",

When I was there this cover band was doing songs from the 80s. But they kept playing crappy songs from the 80s instead of the hits. No big deal. The time before that they had another band which did a good job covering modern songs. My biggest complaint is the food selection. I came here starving and was looking forward to getting good food to eat, but their selection sucks. They don't have much to choose from and the things they have aren't that great.  I got the chicken (I believe thai peanut flavored) and it was something I'd eat if I was on a healthy diet. When I come to a place like this I want cheeseburgers, chicken tenders, wings, something! But they don't do this. If this place increased their menu I'd come here more often. If you just want to have some drinks with friends and listen to a cover band then I recommend this place 100%!",

Didn't get to try the food but the drink menu is awesome because there is such a wide selection from house specials to wine and beer. Prices were a little high for the specialty drinks but they were great. Service was slow. They have good happy hours specials from 4 to 8pm.

The bartenders are great at taking care of guests, so I usually sit by the bar areas because I just feel I get better service there. On Friday, June 2, I finally sat at a table outside with a friend and received outstanding service from our server, Lanetriah. She went above and beyond to make sure our drinks and food were up to par, and always checked on us even though she was quite busy. She also engaged in great conversation with us and really made our experience at Blue greater than usual. It's rare to receive such excellent service like this in most places.

I ended up buying 1 mojito and it was $16! The music was okay. I preferred sitting outside than the inside even tho we had a whole booth for our group.",

    "text": "Blue Martini has really come a long way since they opened years back.  My friends and I used to LOVE going there for happy hour on Sundays (happy hour is from 4-8 and has half priced drinks and some food).  I love the set-up.  The huge patio outside makes you feel as if you are not in Las Vegas, and the ceiling fans keep it surprisingly cool.  There is plenty of seating and you are not forced to make a reservation or buy a bottle just to sit down.  The crowd is a good mix of people. Youngin's, grown and sexy, 50+.  There is a little bit of everything here!  The DJ is usually good, playing a mix of top 40 and hip hop, with some old school jams thrown in there.  I had some friends in town and we were looking for a more relaxed place to go, where we knew we could sit down, and this was the perfect place.  We swooped in on a table when another group left and immediately got some drinks and a hookah.  Now, I am a beer drinker, so I just can't justify paying $14 for a fruity martini.....but oh well.  \"When in Rome!\" The prices are just a bit outrageous, in my opinion.  And our server was VERY slow.  It took at least 20 minutes to get change when I paid, and I had to ask for it.  The hookah was a great part of the night, although I don't smoke.  Blue Martini served it's purpose - we had a nice, chill evening with a few cocktails and some bumpin music.  I just don't like having to pay a cover ($5-$10) for a local place and then pay $14 per cocktail, otherwise I may frequent this place more often.  If you go, just stick to happy hour.",

    "text": "Terrible interaction with the local community.  Let me start by clarifying an inaccurate statement, Blue Martini does not take reservations on Sunday night. They actually are attempting to change a Bar Restaurant into a Night Club on Sunday nights.  Neo-Soul, a promotion company operating on Sunday's has increased their visceral attitude toward anyone not willing to pay 300 dollars for a  bottle service on Sundays.  On Sunday August 7, 2016, I visited the Blue Martini as I always do several times a month.   During my visits I normally spend  around 100 dollars.  After checking online banking I discovered that I have spent approximately 500 dollars since mid May. Yesterday I ordered chicken wings and a cocktail around 730pm.  I waited 45 minutes for my wings.  I look forward to eating BM wings on Sunday since it is the only day that I eat Chicken.   Half way through my chicken wings a Neo soul representative came over to where I was sitting with a retired engineer.and a VA Nurse. The unknown Neo soul promoter described as early 30's, black male, bald head and bow tie, failed to introduce himself.  The first thing out of his mouth was \"Other women are wondering why you have a stool to eat your dinner with. He further stated, I have to ask you if either of you two are disabled\" (he clearly was the one to ask about disabilities).. I was embarrassed that he would stand by with a security officer while I ruffled through my purse in the dark for 3 minutes. I assumed he would be allowing me a reasonable accommodation after forcing me to reveal my disability and showing my credentials.  Instead he was throwing me out of my stool and escorting me way in the back where they hid chairs for Profit.  The promoters actions were consistent with some one without knowledge of Restaurant Regulations.  \" if a patron orders food from a bar that patron should be afforded a proper bar stool\".  Meaning,If a patron orders food from a Blue Martini Bartender at a bar and pays for the meal a bar stool,and proper eating utensils  MUST be provided. Blue Martini can't profit from a customer and then not provide a stool in order for Neo Soul to increase it profits.  The Neo Soul rep. appeared surprised when I produced my Armed forces Veterans disability ID as if he was not expecting that. I explained to him I was a Desert Storm Veteran and retired from the armed forces and Las Vegas Metro.  He then told me to grab my half eaten chicken wings in order to place me out of the way in the back.  I was not going to pay several hundred dollars for a bottle service and chicken wings to hear the same band so that I could sit down for ten minutes to eat.  I asked him if there was an emergency and why I could not eat my last two chicken wings.   I explained that it would not be unreasonable to allow a disabled veteran to finish two wings and then move.  He said \"Let's take the disabled veteran out of it\".  I asked why when he was the one that interjected the disability as a prerequisite to a bar stool which is inconsistent with restaurant  practices. It is also unsanitary to drag your food around in the dark .  The Neo Soul rep also felt it necessary to have a Blue Martini Security officer stand by as a \"Show of Force.\" We took this as excessive, embarrassing and humiliating because it was for profit.  Neo Soul felt  it necessary to interrupt my dinner  so that Neo could increase profits.  Neo Soul is confusing Blue Martini with nightclub practices. Neo Soul and Blue Martini's failure to fallow guidelines of restaurant/Bar have generated a multitude of complaints.  Lastly, He continued to make the situation worse by making me stand and eat my remaining two wings.    Neo Soul claim that by removing seats people are able to get to the bar to order drinks easier are  False. The first bar where more then 25-35 bar stools remain, individuals are allowed to eat and drink around the bar with a proper bar stool.   Secondly, at 815 pm there appeared to be about 5 people at the bar on this particular night.   Lastly,the stool that was taken from me was moved to a small high table where 3 dancers immediately occupied the table.    The entire scene was mishandled and escalated by the Neo Soul rep.  The rep who hides dozens of chairs from restaurant goers was unnecessary and purely for profit.  I would like to reiterate the fact that,  You absolutely cannot make reservations. This entire \"rigged system\"  is sit up to increase the profits of the unprofessional Neo Soul reps desperate to make more money.   I asked  to speak with a Manager at this point.  This manager can only be described as stocky, Latino with a neatly trimmed beard.  He was extremely professional and apologized for the behavior of the Neo Soul representative's behavior.  He further stated that Neo Soul Rep was unprofessional and to contact Scotty M immediately. Additionally, he offered to purchase my chicken wings and I said \"thank you but If you could give us some drink tickets instead.",

We got here and the place was pretty much dead...keep in mind this was the Sunday before Halloween.  At this point it didn't bother me since I rather be at a place that was \"dead\" but had room to sit and dance at than being crammed like sardines at a small night club.    Anyways, I could see why my brother and his friends frequent the place.  The venue was spacious and had places to sit around and lounge.  It was cute how my brother's friends felt embarrassed that they were hyping up BM only to find it \"dead\" so they ordered a round of kamikaze shots, which we all liked.  I also ordered a glass of Shiraz wine that was fine but I should have just ordered martinis like the rest of the girls.  If you're tired of hanging out at \"The Strip\", Blue Martini is a great alternative.  3.5 stars for now.",

Blue Martini has an incredible happy hour that lets you take full advantage of all they have to offer, accept the Hookah.  Is it just me or is their hookah overpriced?  Maybe that's why in all the times I have been there I have never seen anyone doing it.  Located in a shopping center you can shop til you drop.  I advise you to shop FIRST then come here.  Once you get started during happy hour you wont be able to stop.  Love you Blue Martini and cant wait to see you again.  If you miss me too I'm always available for an all expense paid trip.... hey doesn't hurt to ask.",

It took awhile to get the waitress' attention, but once she came over she was sweet. I think the Stella's were a bit overpriced ($8!). The atmosphere was pretty good - loved the outdoor seating and misters. When we wanted a second drink, we could not get her attention for the life of us. My date actually had to go to the bar and order up there since we were tired of waiting. I know that it was busy but she seemed like she only had a few tables and all were in our section. I wasn't crazy about the music and how loud it was. Pretty hungry, but they weren't serving any food (not even snacks or small plates) at 11:30, which I think is odd for Vegas.  Would I return? Maybe if friends invite me, but won't be rushing back. Between the price and trying to get service, and the cover charge for I don't know what, I wasn't impressed.",

    "text": "Five of us gals came here to celebrate my friend's birthday party.  We arrived during happy hour and so we got discounts on the food and on the drinks.  Two ordered tuna and one ordered the artichoke dip.  The tuna was pretty good.    The birthday girl ordered a dirty martini.  They poured half for her and left the other half in the shaker.  During the meal, the busboy took her shaker with half of her drink.  Now try to convince the server that's what happened.  We ordered her another round of drinks but we asked the server about the other 1/2 of the drink that was taken away in the shaker.  Reluctantly she brought her  a refill but at least she did it.    The rest of us enjoyed our drinks and the temperature was just right with the misters going and the sun setting.  We eventually moved inside to listen to the band.  I didn't get the name of the band.  They played very enthusiastically their sets but it seems the crowd just wasn't connecting with the band.  We got up and girl danced anyway and even got the birthday girl up on the raised dance stage for a bit.    The mix was like what I have read here, there were a lot of guys in their thirties, some obvious lounge lizards, some groups of ladies of various ages.  It seemed like there was not a lot of really great chemistry in the room and I can't figure out why.  It's not exactly my scene.  We had fun, we girl danced and got the birthday girl up on the raised dance stage.  The drinks were well made and both servers we had were on it.  It's a beautiful venue.  It's just that the chemistry of the people seemed to not be clicking.  I think we'll come back during the week, and give it another try.",

Mind you, we got drenched by the rain in a mid-summer flash-flood as we were walking up to the building and this place was still packed! A Neo Soul mixer event was being hosted that night so I guess they figured a little rain don't hurt nobody! LOL  It was too loud and crowded for us to hear ourselves think inside, so we headed to the outdoor bar to relax, sip on our beverages, and indulge on some appetizers. We ordered apple tinis, cadillac margaritas, wine, margherita flatbread pizza, shrimp/crab dip, spinach/artichoke dip, & baked brie w/fruit. The drinks were subpar, but the food was delicious! Next time I'll have to order wine or my spirits straight up w/ice. LOL The ladies working the outdoor bar took good care of us so we took great care of them.  On Tuesday, the Neo Soul happy hour is 5:30-9:30pm. Both food and drinks are 50% off. Overall, we had a good time and I can't wait to return!",

I initially was excited, after hearing a few other people say how awesome this place was. So, fast forward to Saturday night, we arrive shortly before midnight, the place was beyond packed. We get in right away, and surprisingly enough we were able to get right up by the bar. The vibe in the place, not gonna lie was the only redeeming thing there. Everyone was loud, drinking and generally it seemed to be having a great time. Now, back to us, we ordered our drinks, took only a couple minutes to receive them each time we ordered, annnnnnnd sorry, that's what killed it for me. If I'm going to pay over $11 dollars for a drink that's off the strip, I'm sorry, but it has to be amazing. That's what killed it for me, drinks were nothing special, overpriced I thought for the quality, not overly friendly staff, and ummm, yeah, some of the girls working inside looked like they belonged at a strip club. Not impressed, to me it was just an average run of the mill bar. Will I be back? Maybe, but more than likely I will pass",

I only ever see cougars lurking around in the dark or pervy old businessmen trying to hit on the hotties. BM used to give you a nice helping of the drink you ordered. They would fill your glass up when serving you and then leave enough in the cocktail shaker for another full glass. That made it worth paying $12/drink but now you barely get any leftovers. The food is cheesy and expensive. Everything tastes pre-packed and/or frozen. The only app I enjoy there is the fruit platter (at least I know the fruit has to be fresh).   Another gripe- I have to sit outside now because the music is SO loud inside that I can't even have a decent convo with my buddies. Oh and $30 for a hookah that barely smokes for 20-30 minutes....honey please. The worst part? They took my favorite drink off of the menu, the s'mores martini :( BOO!  The only thing that keeps me coming back is my industry card (I get 50% off all drink and apps) and my lady card (which gives me 1 drink for free before 9am). I can use both together so I can usually drink on the cheap. If I am looking for a place to take an out-of-town guest (and I don't feel like hitting up the strip) then we'll normally end up here.   P.S. not counted against their rating - but the valet that's outside of Yard House now charges $5 + tip to valet. It used to be free. What the crap?",

The food was great and since it was happy hour the appetizers and drinks were half off which was a plus. You may need to check what time that is but I believe it's before 9 pm. The club was even better and with the patio outside there was a very relaxing atmosphere if you wanted to chill. The DJ was well rounded playing mostly hip-hop and r and b type music. It does get pretty crowded for the club portion so plan to come early. This all took place on a Sunday night so if you are looking for a place to chill on sunday-funday type deal this is it!",

I was meeting a group for a send off party for a friend so I arrived early for some food so I could drink safely.  It was happy hour and food items were discounted and drinks were half price.  I will post photos of the 2 food items. I got crab cakes and ahi tuna on seaweed salad with ginger and 2 sauces wasabi and ponzu. Both were worth the price and tasty! I choose a drink called the Wise Guy. If you are into old fashioned type cocktails you would like this. I was very pleased this second time back!",

Apologizes for being the only person on the floor, takes a while for our drinks to come, and when we have had enough of their service and decide to pay the tab it takes 15-20 mins to get the tab and another 15 mins to get my card back. All in all this place is not a good spot to expect good/speedy service.          Now for the drinks. The drink are expensive unless you go during happy hour. Which I did so I have no complaints about that. Drinks were good. The food was good too. That's the only reason why I am even giving this place a 1 star. No bueno!!!",

    "text": "I come to Vegas about once or twice a year. I come to Blue Martini every time I'm in town and I especially love Sunday Neo Soul. I'm a muture woman who prefers a mature crowd and the music is the best you'll hear in Vegas if you're a True R&B fan. That being said I now need to vent about what happened this past Sunday night 05/24/15. I met a friend there and since I don't come often she reserved a table for the two of us. The price of the table did not include a bottle so we purchased that as well. We also paid for Hookah. We had just started the Hookah and filled our glasses when a great song came on,  so we left to go dance 2 songs. When we returned to \"our\" table there were several people sitting there. When we told them it was our table they said we should speak with the server. We were then informed that our table was cleared and sold because our bottle was empty.....even though we both had full glasses with napkins over them and a full Hookah. Wtf? If it's their policy to boot you from your table once the bottle is empty then fine...I get that they're trying to make money.. but at least give US the option of purchasing another one. I guess what pissed me off the most about all of this was the fact we tipped the server WELL, ahead of time, and she still had an \"I don't give a shit\" attitude. Sad because if she would have treated us right we would have taken good care of her. Even management didn't seem to care an only offered to replace the full drinks....not the table. The only person in all of this that had our back was the Hookah girl.    This is bad customer service no matter how you look at it and unfortunately it has left such a bad impression on me that I will likely never come back. I'm not a big baller like some, I work hard for my money so when I spend that much I expect better service.",

Some nights this place would be crawling with cheesy timeshare salesmen and desperate cougars...sooo NOT cute but makes for some mild entertainment. Mango Madness martini was good & came in a little shaker, don't fall for $12 blue martini...you're paying for glow stick. Fave apps include ahi, margarita pizza, chicken skewers, not bad for bar food. Still one of the best happy hours though. 50% off drinks & apps 4-8pm and located in Town Square so you can leave and go somewhere else if you're not feeling the vibe.",

I left my table to go dance, but left all my belonging behind (a friend would always stay to guard our table and the guys were at the table smoking hookah and drinking).    My waitress, Des had security go look for me because she assumed I couldn't afford a $23 tab. There was no need for her to do that or for management to assume there was a misunderstanding because the entire appetizer and drink was still on the table, meaning I was still on the dance floor.  I couldn't enjoy the rest of my night and ended up going to a different lounge where the service was faster and the waitresses allowed us to enjoy the vibe without feeling harassed.",

I bookmarked this location because of the positive reviews and non-yelper friends of mine who recommended it.   It was pretty late when a group of girlfriends and l arrived and l regret not making the move sooner to stop in a decent hour. I had a BLAST!.  The place was poppppin. It was packed and the music was on point.   The location and its decor were both very nice. The ambiance was super fun and the crowd was diverse.   There was a cover charge of $15 for the ladies, l'm not sure what the cover was for the gentlemen.   The lighting in the entire place was amazing. The drinks were AWESOME and Bitching w a kick! Try the signature drink  blue martini- it was a tastefuly strong mixture that got me acting like l was a choreographer out on that dance floor! I also became one w the skinny bitch all night.  Hookah was also available for a fee and brought to your table if that's what you want.  The restrooms were very clean and well stocked with the essentials.   Ladies bring a pair of slip-ons because Blue Martini is located up stairs and goin down a flight of stairs in heels after a long night is ..lemmmmmeee say, painful.. lol",

We've had almost every martini on the menu, and the one with the blue cheese stuffed olives and straight Stoli is my very good.",

    "text": "My friend and I came to Blue Martini at 645pm for an after dinner cocktail after a long day at our respectable day at work. I went ahead and got a table and order drinks and my friend settled the check at our previous restaurant. Upon arrival, my friend was told that he had to take his hat to the car and leave our leftovers at the front desk. During previous visits, it has not been a problem to bring in items that we purchased at other establishments at Town Square; however,  that was not out biggest concern. After my friend took his hat the car, he returned to Blue Martini and saw several white gentlemen wearing their hats out on the patio, where I was seated. He was told by both hostesses, \"They weren't sports hats. They were golf hats, so they were okay. Mine was not allowed because it had a team on it.\" Another white gentleman was not only wearing a fitted cap, but he had it turned backwards. Mind you, my friend was wearing a Polo button up, fitted cuffed jeans (not baggy), and respectable and charitable Tom's. Based on this interaction and the profiling of the hat, it seems as if this rule is racially biased.  If I had not already ordered and paid for the drinks, we would have left the establishment immediately.  As I'm typing this, another white man walked in with a fitted cap as well. This is unacceptable. This used to be one of my favorite summertime spots.",

    "text": "First time visiting this place last night and won't be coming back. Me and a friend went there to go have dinner, drinks and a little bit of dancing.  We were there early around 8pm and the lounge was pretty empty. Our waitress at that time was really nice and accommodating. 2 hours in we had ordered drinks and appetizers, there was a shift change and we received a different waitress around 10:00pm. By this time the DJ started spinning so we left our table for a quick dance. Mind you our drinks and appetizers were still on the table half touched. When we came back there was two ladies sitting at our table who had put our stuff on the table next to it which was reserved and empty. We politely tried to tell them that we were sitting there but of course they tried to act like they didn't know nothing. I then tried telling the new waitress and she acted like she didn't care and was really rude. I asked to speak to the manager and told him the situation and how they should be moved because we were there first since 8pm and the other ladies just got here and took our table but he insisted to put us at a different table, which was probably outside because there was none left. We decided to just leave because we felt like we were being treated unfairly. This was bad customer service and this ruined our night, it was a waste of our time and money. So just a heads up if you plan on dancing, you might want to bring a body guard to watch over your table. This place really needs to make some changes because it seems like this is a problem and it can cause some problems in that type of environment.",

How does this work I have no clue, only golf hats no baseball caps. There's an outside patio but only golf caps, I'm sorry to keep bringing this up but I never knew blue martini had a day time dress code to have a drink and something to eat, i honestly hope this business turns over and a lounge/restaurant with better credibility takes over because to get \"profiled\" in that manner after we literally golfed for hours on the green is absolutely mind boggling. I hate typing out bad reviews, but if it forces to improve a business and expose their bs, than I believe it's well deserved. When I do have time, I may write something to their corporate offices in Florida. Unacceptable Blue Martini, unacceptable!",

    "text": "Blue Martini is very hit or miss. Let's break it down into a list, shall we?  1. Located in Town Square (Las Vegas Blvd. South), if the place is packed, there are lots of close by attractions, bars, and other shenanigans to get into. 2. This place gets packed on the weekends and ladies night (which is Wednesday). What's great about Wednesdays is that ladies cocktails are 50% off. 3. The patio is the best seating area. 4. There are a lot of great martinis, but some epic failures. (Avoid the Key Lime Pie Martini at all cost!) 5. There are various age groups here. 6. The dress here is very club attire. 7. The inside is packed, the tables are first come first serve and people pounce on tables as soon as all seats are vacant. 8. It is hard to walk through this place without spilling half of your cocktail! 9. It's VERY loud. 10. When Blue Martini is slow, it's a really cool spot. 11. If you work in the hospitality industry, you can get an industry card and your bill is 50% off all the time. 12. This is a great place to find a piece of booty for the night. 13. The bartenders do make strong beverages and if there are extras in your martini shaker, they give it to you. 14. Some nights, there are hookahs available to rent. Lots of yummy flavors to choose from. 15. They do have yummy food, but the pickings are slim and the price tag is a little too high.  And that's Blue Martini, not amazing, not bad.",

If it wasn't Wednesday, their happy hour is from 4-8, which has to be one of the best in Vegas, as most of the happy hours stop at 7pm.  It wasn't packed in the BM when we got there, so we got a table right in front of the bar.  Ordered a Skinny Bitch (only 45 calories!) and watched as the band setup shop for the night.  The band was pretty decent but made it extremely loud in the bar, to the point, my friend and I were yelling at each other.  I ordered a Cherry Martini and fell in love with it.  It tasted like you just ate a cherry out of the jar.  So good!  Someone had rented out the back part of BM for a birthday party (I wonder how much that costs?  Looked like fun!)  I've been to the BM on a Saturday and hated it as it took forever to get a drink. I think I will only venture to the BM on Wednesdays!",

But, if you go with a group of friends whose company you enjoy it's a good place to stop in for a couple drinks and apps. Drinks, appetizers, and flatbread pizzas are half off during happy hour, which is everyday from 4 - 8.  I always love to get the russian vodka, blue cheese stuffed olive martini and the fruit and cheese plate. The fruit and cheese plate is great, and enough for 2 people to share and feel satisfied. I also recommend the spinach-artichoke dip served with pita chips.   Tip: Go see a movie next door at Rave and bring your tickets back in for one free drink per ticket. I came here for happy hour, got half off drinks, went to the movie, and came back after for a free \"non-happy hour price\" martini. Good deal!",

Guess what they did??? They just escorted out the offender and let that person go, they did not hold that person and call the cops or the ambulance for my friend's cut bleeding nose, my friend couldn't press charges bc the attacker was gone, again and for the third time in 5 years, security orchestrated everything in the same way. We did tell the security guard while the attacker was being hold by the bar in the dance floor, to not let that person go like three times, and he agreed. When the Metro, permanently located at Town Square, arrived, there was no case, the assaulter was gone, and the same security guard, said to my friend that he didn't know that my friend wanted to press charges. Security at BM LV is protecting people who break the law, Instead of protecting well-behaved costumers and regulars. We all must know by now this is BM's policy.This is BM's reputation. I found out last night talking with other costumers there. I think is dangerous for all the town to know, they can come in whenever they want, and do whatever they want, and they will only be escorted out.....",

Right from the start the new door-douche (from Florida) was giving me problems with my wardrobe.  Apparently all guests must dress the same to get in.  Although I was dressed for a night out at the clubs, in $600 pants and a custom collared shirt, the door-douche would not let me in.   Here is the kicker, he flat out said to me \"DO YOU MAYBE HAVE A TRENDY SHIRT? LIKE AN ED HARDY OR AFFLICTION?\"  HAHAHAHAHA  He preferred that I pull my entire party out of the place, and leave because I was not wearing a \"TRENDY SHIRT\".  Oh but then they let in 3 guys dressed in shorts, flip flops and Ed Hardy shirts while discussing their dress code with me (which is not posted anywhere).  Thats when I called my party and told em we were leaving.  My party of 8 left, went directly downstairs to YARDHOUSE and had an awesome night free of Douchebaggery.   Then off to 3 other Hot spots like Body English, all of which felt my wardorbe was fine.  If Heading to Blue Fartini, do yourself a favor and skip it, and go downstairs to Yard House.  over 200 beers on tap, great food and Atmosphere  - ZERO DOUCHEBAGGERY!!!",

I didn't know what to order, all these people with fancy drinks on their hands pretending to be somebody, I didn't want to get a beer and stand out like sour thumb, I wanted to blend in to the pretentious scene.  \" can I help you?\" yes I'll have a martini. \" what kind?\" (now, I don't want to sound  ignorant.)  I'll have the one with the olive, you know.. the one James Bond drinks. She didn't have a smile on before so I'm sure it was nothing that I said. She served me the drink that ended up costing me me 15.00 dollars! I think I'm only having one drink tonight. Are they any cheaper without the olive?    I joined the party and had a good time with my friends. But I don't know if I'll ever return.

A large group of us met there for happy hour. We sat in the inside bar since it was 115 degrees outside. After we ordered our drinks we were told by our waitress that the manager was not opening the inside bar since they were short staffed and we had to move outside - in the heat - in the smoking area. Wow! I have never had such poor service in my life! We were dying in the heat and, being allergic to nicotine, ended up being a most miserable experience. I will never go there again. Clearly their manager, who could have stepped in to help wait tables if he had to, could care less about the comfort of their patrons. Bad move. Left early, won't go back = lost revenue.",

As we were being escorted out, I said to the bouncer that he just lost a lot of business ($10+ per drink x 13 per round) Instead of being professional.. he tells me that they don't need our business.

BUT.. they charge you to get in & you gotta get major snazzy.    *y? idk. it's probably because everyone else is?   anyway,  if your kickin' it with a big group of friends, this is probably a good spot to do that.   it has a big ass patio with a bar to match.  you can kick it and fan out if need be.  they also serve food which is also good when you've drank a lot of \"blue martini's...\" (*ahem... very strong drink btw..)    they also have a dance floor which is cool..  but the cover? idk.",

My boy met us up in line and was like \"yo! my brother is spinning for 93.1 over @ blue martini, wanna check it out?\"  So we went over there, and it was actually a great time!.  I had never been over to town square before and this place was not over the top like most clubs in las vegas, but it was really fun none the less.  I think my superior dance skills were a bit much for the crowd tho, they really didnt want any.  I will definitely be back!  Drinks were reasonable, I think they over charged my card...but I was tipsayy so im not too sure on that one.  Good times really enjoyed the outdoor patio.  Check it out if you wanna do some off strip partying.",

We waited about 30 mins to get our food n drink orders in, then the waitress seemed so stressed like she didn't even wanna be there kind of attitude. The food was awesome tho, we got the margarita flat bread, spinach dip w/pita and lobster spread w/crackers all worth trying. As for drinks we ordered a couple martinis & a mango mojito all were pretty good except the one thing that pissed off my fiance was that when he got his martini which comes with a shaker to pour your own glass, the waitress advised that the shaker was uneven with the top, so of course when we poured it 3rd of the drink leaked thru the side of the shaker, and the waitress could care less! Then it took another 30mins to close our tab! All I can say is we didn't leave a tip!",

This is my first time there. I ordered Fly me to the moon martini and it was strong and good. The martinis are served in a frosty shaker and you can refill your glass several times. The lemon chicken was good and the service was ok. The place is huge with several bars, the occupancy is 750. The decor is nice. We sat on the large outdoor patio bar that was packed. The music was loud and it gets more loud as time goes by. It is too loud for me as we could not hold any conversation. The best part is local ladies can sign up for a Blue Lady card which will get you a free martini and I believe any night of the week from 4pm to 10pm.",

At first we sat on a cocktail table on the patio and waited 20 minutes and noone came to help us.  At that point I got up to order from the bar and pretty much the same story.  The three bartenders were too busy socializing with each other that even after making eye contact, they still didn't come help me.  Then when a bartender finally came over, he took about 6 minutes to make 2 drinks and was more concerned with his odd version of flair that it was just annoying.  It turns out that while I was at the bar, a waitress finally showed up and just stared at my friend without staying a word, just waiting for her order, just being incredible rude.  Won't be back",

The security was really rude & pushy when trying to clear a path for a bartender holding drinks. My friend was apparently standing where she wasn't suppose to while waiting for an opening to get a drink.. Instead of letting us know nicely that we couldn't stand & order drinks where we were.. we got \" You ladies need to move & wait somewhere else to get drinks.\" At that point we just walked out. Super disappointed. Sad that we have to find a new spot for Ladies night.",

    "text": "Advertised as having the best happy hour on the Strip, so we thought we'd stop in and check it out. During happy hour drinks and food are half-priced, which will run you about $6 a drink (for a martini) and $6 to $8 for food. Martinis are served in a frosty shaker from which you can refill your glass several times, yum. The location is fantastic and the place itself is impressive in decor and size with three bars inside and a large outdoor patio bar that was absolutely packed with patrons and perfect for hanging out and enjoying the warm Vegas evenings. Local ladies can sign up for a Blue Lady card which will get you a free martini any night of the week from 4pm to 10pm. Not bad.  As far as people watching goes, this place is a must. First off, the bartenders (girls and a few guys) and waitresses won't make you gag. The clientele consists of people just getting off work, those who want to be seen and a fair amount of singles. Live music is performed inside throughout the week and ladies night is every Wednesday. Might be a little douchie but we can handle it.",

I've gone twice now and both times, once on a Saturday night and again last night, the servers acted like I was doing them a favor by being there.   I mean I understand people make mistakes, and sometimes the wrong dish gets prepared. But fix the mistake quickly. We waited almost 20 minutes for them to bring out our crab dip, by that point we didn't even want it anymore. I was going to ask to speak to the manager, but caught sight of here taking shots with a server. Great environment right.   Definitely not coming back anytime soon.",

    "text": "The experience last night (March 17) was awful. I'll never return to that restaurant. Their food is actually not bad and they have this complimentary cocktail for ladies, which is a great selling point. However their service sucks, well at least the service last night trashed my neutral feelings toward the restaurant. I was expecting a five star service at this casual dining place but it was so bad that it's ever worst than the worst Chinese restaurant at Chinatown ---- at least they take you order and feed you!!!  So here is what happened. We arrived at around 5:30. It was a lovely day and a table on the patio. We were perfectly happy until we spent 15 mins on the menu back and forth because no one came to take any order or give us a water. Finally the waitress came and took our drink order, we ordered a vodka martini and a water. She walked away so fast, leaving me no time to order any food. After about 10 mins, we caught a moment to place our food order. After a few minutes, she returned with 4 glasses of water in a tray and gave us one. My martini didn't come so I asked for a water from her. She said she'd get me one and gave the other three to another table. I bet they didn't even ask for it as they just sat down. She never returned with my water. What pissed me off the most is that she kept serving tables that already have food or drink an ignoring us, who don't have anything on the table. She's either a bad waitress who doesn't give a shit to her customers, or she a racist who only serves white people.   We waited for that glass of water for another five mins and we left. No sure if she placed the food order at all but I don't think she did, probably not even the martini, which didn't showed up in 20 mins.",

It can be fun to visit with a group of friends, but it gets crowded and super loud real quick. It's not really a place that you can just chill at for a long time unless you can stand on your feet for long periods of time, or you really enjoy being in a crowd.   Food and drink wise, nothing that stands out, but nothing sucks.  I would go with one of the namesake martinis and peruse around the outdoor seating area.  I would also suggest going during happy hour, but we all know what that entails...overcrowding, mediocrity, and lots of cougars.. jk... sort of :P",

    "text": "Half-priced martini's and a nice collection of small and medium bites for happy hour, which stretches out way past the norm by ending at 7:30pm.  BF and I got here around 7pm on a Thursday night and were rudely greeted by what I can only describe as a tool bag at the entrance asking us to get to the back of the line where we could be carded to come in. Once security deemed us old enough to enter, we walked into the patio area to search for a table or seats at the bar.  It was really nice outside, so this outdoor patio area was hoppin'.    After spending 10 minutes repeating what we JUST did in the parking lot (wandering around aimlessly for a spot), we gave up and went inside.  Inside the restaurant was rather empty so we grabbed a table easily.  The only problem was that it was FREEZING inside.  I felt like whatever table we were at, cold air was blowing directly on me.  We decided to brave it out.  A nice friendly waitress came over and informed us it was still happy hour, to our extreme pleasant surprise.  He ordered a dirty martini with blue cheese-stuffed olives, and I ordered the Mango Madness.  Both were okay.  Mine was a little sweeter than I'd like, and his just wasn't 100%, but we did end up ordering one more each, so they must not have been that bad.  For food, we ordered the margarita flat bread, the sliced sirloin, fruit and cheese plate, and crab cakes.  Let's start with the bad (because I like people to leave my reviews on a good note).  The crab cakes were super mushy.  The flavor was mediocre at best, but they just completely fell apart when you went to get a piece of it with your fork.  It was really more of a crab mush than a crab CAKE.  The breading was not crispy at all and just didn't add anything to the dish.  It was served with an orangish drizzle that could have been spicy mayo.  I think whatever it was, it was the dish's only saving grace because it had a delicious flavor.  The next bad dish was the fruit and cheese plate.  What a disappointment.  I'm sorry, but when I order a fruit and cheese plate at a place like Blue Martini, I would expect the cheese to NOT include baby bells.  There was a slab of goat cheese in the middle, a few squares of swiss, and two baby bells, along with an array of fruit and crackers.  There was only one strawberry on the plate and it was more green than it was red.  The whole plate, which was very large, was a complete disappointment and we ended up wasting most of it.  Okay, onto the good.  The sliced tenderloin plate was so delicious.  The slices of tenderloin (which is what a filet mignon is cut from) were so tender and juicy.  The dish came with some rice pilaf and a horseradish sauce.  All of the flavors combined were perfectly well-balanced and made a delicious dish.  Last, the margarita pizza was amazing.  So simple and yet so complex.  The crust was just the right amount of crispy.  The tomatoes complimented the light but flavorful cheese just right.    Our server also brought my BF extra olives for his second martini because she saw me eating them out of his glass.  She was really sweet, friendly and we never had to wait on her so that was a huge plus.  If not for her service, I may have given the martini a sad 2-stars.",

    "text": "Although Blue Martini could be a total hit or miss for me,  I was excited to spend a Monday with a bunch of my friends as their advertised Manic Monday happy hour event.  With this happy hour, it starts at 8pm (and ends at midnight) and includes half off of all drinks and food.  There's an booth at the front that will give you a wristband if you're part of the Vegas casino and entertainment industry.    I do like the venue.  There's outdoor and indoor space and lots of it.  Although I've been indoors, the Monday night festivities were outdoor only because they were rennovating the inside.  I like the outdoor space.  Lots of bar space, high chairs and high top tables all around.  Fit pits and a balcony overlooking the middle courtyard of Townsquare and other restaurants close by.    For my drinks, I got the typical vodka soda with a lime.  Just your typical drink, although I know they have great martinis.  What I really want to review is the lobster salad.  OH-EM-GEE, it is soo good.  Two whole chunks of Maine Lobster accompanied by baby greens, crunchy romaine lettuce, mango, avocado, tomato, tossed with a lemon/orange vinaigrette.  Everything was super fresh and crisp.  The lobster meat was cooked perfectly and really made the salad the star of my night!!  This salad is about $20 but with the half off price, it's perfect!  You'll definitely have to try the lobster salad and drinks.  It's a light meal that is packed with flavor and delightful textures.  If you work in the industry, come check out Manic Mondays and get the salad.  You will love it!!",

About a year ago I was in Vegas with friends for March Madness and could not get in Hakasan due to long lines. I asked club security  while in line where else was there to go? He told me about a club named Blue Martini and it wasn't to far away. It was a 15 min ride by cab over to Town Square. This place was like no other! It looks small walking up but it is huge inside, lighting and sound are perfect , the food on the menu taste really good, and they even have hookah if your into that too. I have been back to Blue Martini now several times and made it my place to go when in Vegas. The live bands and Djs I've heard  there really bring in the people for a great time and atmosphere and even on a Sunday night!   Last I feel it would be an injustice to not mention the professional service I always receive there from  every person working at this establishment whether it be the greeter at the door, the person making sure your glass has a drink and ice bucket refilled ect. All the staff is great but I ask for Cocktail Ambassador Erika C.  my favorite as she goes above and beyond to give excellent service, and to ensure your experience there is the most memorable!  Thank you Blue Martini and you too Erica (:",

You can also here live music here on occassions and they definitely have loud music, sometimes too loud as you can't hear your own conversation.   Ladies night is Wednesday night with half priced apps and martinis on the menu. Their food is actually quite good for a bar and their drinks are even better. They've added some new additions like skinny margarita martini that I do thoroughly enjoy.  They also have hookah if you like that. This places does get quite crowded and is open very late.  There's an inside and an outside complete with fans and heaters depending on the weather. They also have roll down shades for when it actually rains in Las Vegas.",

Friends and I went in yesterday using our lady VIP cards (drink ticket), checked in on facebook (drink ticket), used valet coupons (drink ticket) all which we had done before without issue (i'm there on a weekly basis). Well last night we were told that we were \"exploiting\" them by using those tickets because each of us had 2 or 3. I'm sorry it's YOUR loyalty/comp program and we're the ones exploiting it?  But that's not the worst of it.. we decided to move outside on the patio after the manager told us this, finish out drinks, and leave but the manager came back got right up to my friends face and YELLS at her!!! He said we moved tables to try to scam another server. It was ridiculous! Now their cocktail servers are tweeting us saying \"there are two sides to every story\" and that the manager yelling at us HAD to be warranted because the management is \"so easy to deal with\". Are you kidding me??!! What happened to the customer is always right? Especially when we were completely calm throughout this entire situation and did absolutely nothing wrong.  I have been a loyal Blue Martini customer since it opened but I will no longer patronize them when they treat their LOYAL customers this way.  As a friend just commented: Wow getting threatened for taking advantage of the deals THEY have put in place... because that makes perfect sense.",

When we came the Vip hostess acted like he never had talked to our friend on the phone shortly before we arrived. We waited outiside in the cold while waiting for them to set up our table. We were brought inside to the table area and seated. They had the ice and juice ready and after brought out the bottles we had selected. We chose ciroc and kettle one to mix our drinks with. The server checked on us frequently and asked if we wanted more drinks as she would come and prepare them for us.

I work in the industry and now at the door they want your BM Industry card AND Gov't ID so they can put info in their computer about you. It was hot outside and it holds up the process. I guess now they are moving on to direct marketing or perhaps even selling it to other organizations. They, seriously, want your phone number, email and address! For half off of many $14.00 drinks I guess that information is worth something to someone.  Walking in this place has this terrible smell of burnt pizza... all the time. I walk past this completely empty bar with two bartenders standing around and when I approach one bartender passes me off to another. I assure you a cranberry vodka takes two minutes to make. They have this weird habit of stapling this big piece of paper to my receipt and its quite irritating. Anyway, I proceeded to the function and needed another drink and they wanted to charge me $14 for a drink. I had show them my wrist band to get it half off and even then it was $8. I mean come on lady and BM. Half of $14 is not $8.   The last time I came I ordered a pizza and it was as if they had a promotional contract with Ritz Crackers. The pizza was about as dry as a Ritz and the toppings were hard to spot. A sprinkle of cheese here and basil leaf there- voila Margherita pizza. Needless to say I didn't bother with the food this time.",

It was $30 for the first time and then $10 for each additional refill. The outside part had their own DJ which played house music the entire time. The inside part played more R&B and hip hop music which I would have liked outside as well, but that was okay. Drinks were good, overpriced for a normal night, but okay priced for happy hour.  Service was a little slow and the girls did not seem interested in our table until we gave them a $5 tip for two drinks.",

The music was great because they had two DJs, one playing the Latin music inside the building and the other playing hip hop outside. The ratio of male and female was decent so make sure you bring girl friends. Drinks were good and happy hour was a plus. But service here isn't great. Especially the security. They kicked my friend out for \"getting in the way of the bartender.\" But keep in mind this place is packed on the inside and he even lied saying he was the manager, giving a fake name, and said he had already warned my friend twice to get out of the way.",

    "text": "With the hundreds of people in Blue Martini Saturday night I'm surprised there aren't much of any real reviews, so here is my best effort. Over the past two weeks the name kept on coming up, this is the place to hang in Las Vegas. Situated in the middle of the district upstairs overlooking all the shops with its indoor/outdoor setup and girl to guy perfect ratio (60girl/40guy) you will be bound to have a great time.   The place is huge, bars setup everywhere, live music playing, food served quickly and drinks of only top shelf live here. Their lobster tacos came highly recommended so we ordered one of those (18.00) and their sashimi salad (12.00), perfect... Still a little hungry we ordered their artichoke spinach dip which we both agreed their pita chips should have been soft bread or just normal chips as the pita chips were rock hard intentionally of course...  The crowd was truly mixed, so many people of all different ages, backgrounds and types. Anyone can feel comfortable here and when we went Saturday night we had no issues getting in, (they do check ids) and no issues with clothing (jean, red shirt, coat) and non-dress shoes. Now there are a lot of people dressed up, but saw no sign of them keeping people out or giving a hard time over dresscode.   No gaming, great food, great drinks, good music, and fun crowd.",

Drinks are average priced but ide stick to happy hour as it is cheaper. Im not sure of the dress code i want to say collard shirt and black shoes no sneakers so be weary of what you wear. Definitely seemed like more of a local crowd then a tourist crowd which is great. There is abundant parking as it is located within the mall located near the theater. It is also very spacious and smoke free as well. You may only smoke on the outside patio bar where the hookahs i saw are also located. Definitely a nice place to just sit and relax but not for the casually dressed.",

Drinks run about $12-14 each, but half price during Happy Hour -- 4pm to 8pm daily. At $6 each, it's a great deal because they fill up your martini glass and then give you the shaker, so it's like two drinks for one.   The martini menu is expansive. I've tried a lot of the drinks and they're all good. The only only I ever didn't like was the chocolate bar one. It tasted like straight vodka. But the caramel swirl - yummy!    The place is huge and has (I think) three different bar areas. There's music inside. I highly suggest checking it out.",

    "text": "This Town Square joint's packed like a stripper's shoe closet!  But I wouldn't know that.  The bars are massive!  Go find a casual lounge mood inside with a live band playing danceable tunes (salsa, Earth Wind and Fire) to get all the lovely ladies moving (too bad it's a small floor).  A cabana style area outside awaits others who just want to talk, complete with overhead fans where most of the cougars and older rich men like to go on the prowl.  I didn't dig the velvet ropes though.  VIP service at a bar?  I thought only clubs do that.  It's a few minutes drive down the strip, still further south than the infamous \"Welcome to Las Vegas\" sign (with a fence and parking area built around it now?!  Must've had one too many tourist casualties).  I can't stress enough how much fun I had here two Fridays ago.  Crap, \"stress\" and \"fun\" shouldn't be said in the same sentence.  I heard from a friend's friend who lives in Vegas that this used to be the locals' hotspot, but for what it was worth, March 20th goes down as one memorable evening for me!  But I won't tell because what happens in Vegas...  stays in God's mind forevermore.  The bartenders (Kristy, I'm talking to you) were cool and attentive.  Go to the far back where it's less crowded or get here early because Happy Hours run from 4 PM - 8 PM everyday.  You're looking at half off everything so for example, a Grey Goose and Tonic will cost $5.  Dress is casual as I saw business suits, nurses still in uniform, and plenty of chill people in jeans and sneakers.    Far from ghettofabulous and nowhere near pretentious, this is a great starting point for a Friday evening.  Real swell until the newest Vegas Happy Hour hot spot hits.  Oops.  Too late.  It probably already did.  No cover when I went around 5.  I didn't get any bouncer attitude either.  Are you sure this is Vegas?",

They waitresses were bitchy at best. My friends from Vegas actually had to order from the bar, because she was too busy fixing her hair in the mirror. She took forever to bring back our change (like twenty minutes) and did not even apologize for making us wait.   The huge plus side is there are about three or four different bars in this joint. So if you dont like your server you can simply move to a different location.   I liked the dance floor set up with the Go-Go dancers.  The bathrooms could be in a better place, rather than all the way in the back.   All in all its worth checking out if for nothing more than the variety of martinis.",

Since it was located in a strip mall, I expected it to be some sort of low-key bar/restaurant. The mall is nice, upscale and well laid out.   There was no line at 7 o'clock so we walked right it. The decor was nice, it was definitely better and bigger than i had expected. A live band was playing that night busting out tunes from Bon Jovi and other 80's/90's bands. There are 3 bars inside and all 3 had good looking female bartenders. The food was decent but I wouldn't go here just for the food. I tried the steak sandwich and the flatbread pizza which was decent and since it was half off, it tasted even better. The cocktails didn't taste watered down and I could feel the effects after a few drinks, just the way I like it.   The crowd was cool. Everyone seemed to be there to have a good time, not to show off. The women there seemed friendly as well with a good mix of people. I never had any trouble getting drinks or food from any waitress so that was definitely a plus.   I would definitely stop by the Blue Martini during my next visit to Vegas. It's a nice change from the usual strip scene.",

The food is better than expected considering it's a chain and focused on drinks, but mostly for appetizers to nibble on versus place for dinner. Try the Margharita flatbread. Very tasty.   A few of the bartenders are really nice. Try to find Christy or Monica if you can. Sweethearts.   So, what concerns me about this place are the crowds. If you're looking for young and hip, this isn't the place for you. I would say the happy hour crowd is skewing mid-30's and 40's. The last time we went later in the night, the crowd was very ghetto, but apparently they've done something at the door to improve that according to some of the staff.   If you're looking for a \"locals\" hangout to have some drinks and apps with your friends, this is the place. Bonus: it's in Town Square so you can get your shopping done too.",

    "text": "The service here is awful. Our waitress brought us dirty silverware and did not once come to ask if everything was to our liking (there were maybe 10-15 people in the entire inside bar area with three waitresses). The all three waitresses were visibly standing in a circle texting on their phones and talking. The wine my friend ordered was obviously watered down, unfortunately I can't remember the name of the wine. I ordered one of their \"specialty martinis\" and it was definitely special... Even though I had not finished the special martini, I decided to try a very simple martini to see if the bartender was just out of his/her game for the first. I ordered a Vesper, a very common martini, and even explained what was in the drink so they did not confuse it.  3 part Gin,1 part Vodka, 1/2 part Vermouth, and a lemon twist - A simple mixed martini. What I received was a mess of vodka and vermouth. The waitress set the drink down and asked, \"Did you want olives or lemon?\" I replied, \"Lemon...\" (as explained when I ordered the drink). She returns with three lemon wedges, one of which was already squeezed and left in the cup. I asked for the check then she proceeded to stand by the register for another 10 - 15 minutes and text in my line of sight. I was only 20 feet away from her. I will not be returning to this place. You can get better service and more knowledgeable staff at a PT's Pub.",

Yesterday, we noticed that the bouncers were being very \"selective\" in allowing people in. We were a group of Asians dressed in button shirts with dressy adidas shoes on. He told us we weren't allowed in because they were adidas', despite that they were black and dressy shoes and we are locals. He was very rude and in our face about leaving. Yet, right after denying us entry, we saw him let in guys in tshirts and dirty converse shoes. We use to come here often and have spent thousands of dollars here. Never again because this place is getting a snobby strip feel and worst, almost racist feel to it!!! Try Nu Sanctuary instead:)",

Everything is half off during happy hour (like everyone else says), and the atmosphere is very nice: modern, dimly lit, a great place to relax from a stressful work week.  It's one of my favorite places to hang out and catch up with my sister.  I'll go here at least twice a month, I'd go more if I didn't care about splurging on calories.  I seriously have nothing negative to say about this place.  Perfect location in town square, what better way to wrap up a nice day of shopping than martinis and yummy miniature dishes?  Among my favorites martinis are (choco fan here): Espresso martini, Smores martini (big marshmallows on a skewer), triple chocolate martini, and one I forget the name of that is a blend of espresso and dark chocolate (on right side of menu).  I can usually only stand to have two because they are so strong- NOT complaining!",

They also have hookah here which is awesome. Nice bathrooms cant complain, the inside is pretty nice and the outside has good seating.

If you want to get laid, more than likely you can go home with someone and it won't be too hard. I certainly have met people here when I've wanted to hook up as have maaaany others. True, it can be an eclectic mix of people sometimes,  it's mostly filled with Vegas versions of the Jersey Shore. The drinks are way over priced and are just sub par. The bartenders are hot and seem to serve their purpose in that sense, but aren't outstanding mixologists (like they get hired on how well they make a cocktail in the first place). Basically, are you lonely? Are you decent looking and want  to just get laid? This is your place.",

They covered old and new songs which is fun to sing to (Which we tend to do when we're drunk). I liked sitting outside the most because they had hookahs, it was quieter, and the music was more the dance type. Their servers were very lively and fun. Do not order the Almond Joy. It is the strongest drink I've ever had and it was gross. I could not finish it. I don't even think i put a dent in it. We didn't order any food there. I'll have to go again and experience their food and happy hour.",

This place is more where the locals hang out as it is not on the strip.  It tends to be busy here, but I've managed to find a table every time. The music is also loud, so it's not the ideal place to be if  you're looking to have some enlightening conversations.

    "text": "Womp womp womp. This place is a such a downer - I have no idea why people come here and why it is so, so packed all the time. It must be their awesome discounts for people in the industry. I am not a casino worker and I am not down with paying $12 for a teeny watered down beverage.  I have come to BM a few times before my last trip for my friend's birthday party and I have never been impressed. As many others here have pointed out - the place is for cooooougars and men who wish to prowl on divorcees. Other people you may find here - groups of girls who come for happy hour and leave before being hit on by sleez-os trying to dance up on them on the tiny dance floor. Lots of single dudes. Single dudes standing around in a martini bar....   Anyway - my friend had her birthday here on \"Latin Night\". We wanted a table in the back, but didn't get one because they said they weren't going to open the bar in the back. So, my friend - pissed by the way - agreed to be sat up toward the front, in much less nice seating. They shoved our 10 person party in space meant for about six and promised us we could have the table next to us as soon as the two cradle robbers at that table left. Right. *rolls eyes* I've been to a lot of clubs/bars in Vegas and I've been around a lot of promoters and I even did a stint of promoting myself. That right there is just crap service. Especially to locals.  Let me also point out the fact that our waitress never came by to fill our drinks. I get it, it's busy, whatever. There was a table full frat-hats next to us, whom she was serving, but come on. You can't even come around once after the first time to refill drinks? I've been in PACKED clubs and I've had my drink refilled by the waitress many, many times during the course of a night.  Sorry, maybe call me spoiled by my desire to actually have bottle service when you're paying for BOTTLE SERVICE. If you're going to offer the option, and people are going to pay for the bottles - then step it up and do it.  Overall - I never have any intentions of returning to BM, unless I'm invited to another birthday party.",

    "text": "This has to be the absolute worst experience ever!!! Decided to take friends and family out while they visited Vegas and we ended up at the Blue Martini. There was an entry fee which I thought it was weird for a restaurant. We ordered a bottle of Coconut Ciroc so we can get a table. Initially we were given the option for a table that was in the middle of the dance floor basically or a more secluded table. After given the option and us choosing the more secluded area, we were sat in the middle of the \"dance floor\" because the other section was closed (btw the table we were offered and told was closed after was empty). We were a group of 8 and couldn't be properly accommodated because the tables, which fit 6 max, we're screwed to the floor. Then they bring the bottle we ordered, already open, and the waitress pours out a couple of drinks without mixers and walks away. First sip we all took, it was clear that this \"Ciroc\" we ordered was NOT Ciroc!!!! It watered down vodka of who knows what!!!!! This is a table full of people that drink nothing but Ciroc and even the other people around us that tasted it can clearly tell it was not Ciroc!!!!!! So we call them back over and have them taste it themselves. First guys face after his first sip was priceless!!! He stuttered so hard when trying to explain that this never happened here before and blah blah blah...bs!!!! The bar \"manager\" comes over and opens a bottle in front of us and literally argues us down that it tastes the same but she wouldn't do anything to accommodate and clearly lacked any type of customer service skills!! She just kept arguing and laughing like this was some type of game they played on a regular!! So we tell them to take their bottle back and charge for the 5 drinks they half poured. We start to walk out without signing the check that sat next to the untouched drinks, and they follow us out demanding we sign the check. We asked for the manager to come out, and some other guy named \"Paul\" comes out...doesn't say a word to anyone, doesn't introduce himself, wouldn't even look us in the eye while we tried talking to him!!!!! Security followed and surrounded us like when all we wanted was to talk to this guy but clearly they felt threatened...so bad that it wasn't until I turned around and told them to back off that they stopped following us around!!! When we explained what the issue was and the fact that we got an open bottle and their bar manager refused to give us a sealed one, his response was \"our corporate policies are to open our bottles behind the bar....and you wouldn't go red lobster, order a lobster and tell them to take it back because u didn't like it\"...followed by \"next time try Pizza Hut\"...wow really!? At that point it was clear that this place along with that whole crew was a joke!! We signed the check just to get out of there and actually have a real drink!!!! We ended up at Gold Spike off Fremont st which is always a great time but by then we were all sick from the poison Blue Martini gave us. I will NEVER go there again and will be sure to spread this around!!!! I have visitors often and this city isn't very big so this WILL get around!!! And this review is just the beginning...Blue Martini will get what's coming to them!! And I will be reporting this illegal bs they're trying to pull off....be ready to have that little liquor license revoked Blue Martini!!!",

Oh and the Martini list?...Out of this world fantastic with just about every decadent concoction of flavorful drink's you can think of- all with a special Blue Martini touch!!  This evening I was a little stuffed from my previous meal so, I was unable to try all the Martinis I would have love too have though, I was fortunate to indulge in a few that were incredible.My first drink was the Blue Martini drink which is Van Gogh Blue Vodka, Citronge, Blue Curacao, Sour Mix, Orange Juice, served in an Oversized Snifter over Ice with a Glow Stick. This drink was strong though super delicious!!!! My second drink of the evening was The Skinny Bitch which was something I needed especially after feeling so stuffed the drink is Van Gogh Vodka, Tropicana 50 Blueberry/Pomegranate Juice, and Blueberry Puree which is only Under 25 Calories and tasted fantab and never would have though it was so low in calories.  I had a really fun time here this evening especially with all the people watching of everyone dancing and having fun especially watching those who should not be dancing...lol  Drinks are pricey at about $12.00 to $14.00 a drink though I heard they have a good happy hour with drinks at $7.000 half off on appetizers.   I really, really look forward to my next visit,especially for there happy hour time....until next time!",

    "text": "Is this place spectacular?  Not even close.  But it is consistent.  Blue Martini offers great discounts.  Ladies, make sure you have your VIP card.  This place has a great patio, really good martinis (which are very affordable at happy hour), consistently good servers and usually a good atmosphere.    I've been to Blue Martini a lot.  It's a great place to start the night because their happy hour really can't be beat.  Most of the food and drinks are half price and although the food is NOT awesome, it is tolerable and BM makes up for the mediocre food with their martinis.  I love a good martini and with a few exceptions, BM has great martinis.  My favorite martinis are the Dirty Bird and Sweet Tea martini.  I still have a lot to try, but I can tell you to avoid the Grape at all costs unless you really like Dimetapp.  As for the food, the flatbread pizzas and bruschetta are passable.  The odd thing about this place is that certain days it's a much older crowd and certain days its a mid-20s, early-30's crowd.  One caveat: I like the front bar and patio area.  The other area gets incredibly loud and hot when the band is playing.  I strongly suggest a few visits before you decide whether you love it or hate it!",

I find the early evenings to be the most enjoyable as the patio seating/live DJ almost has a Miami vibe in an otherwise normal shopping plaza (Town Square) of Las Vegas.  Here you will find a large local/industry based crowd as well as some wandering tourists.  The drinks and food are great and Wednesdays is Ladies night.  If you plan on going to party here please be advised they do have a dress code for the  later hours, so please save yourself the trouble and come proper!  You can also get bottle service here for a reasonable price and is always a more fun route for groups of people.  The crowd is diverse and I have never had any issues inside.  Well staffed, and attentive security.   Definitely a local hot spot and worth the trip if you have never been! : )",

We decided to do a group date ( 3 different couples) and thought this would be a good place to go to since we had all been wanting to try it out for quite some time.  We went during happy hour which was great since the drinks and appetizers were 1/2 priced, but that was really where the good things end.  We sat at the bar out by the patio area. You would think sitting at the bar you would get some faster service, especially since they were not even close to being busy yet with maybe 3 other tables in the whole place being occupied.  It took forever to get the bar tender to even get our drink orders since apparently he was deciding to flirt with one of his co-workers that night.  Finally got our drinks (which I will admit weren't bad) but then it took another 15 or 20 minutes before we were able to order any appetizers since apparently every one decided to go on break or something.  After we finally got our appetizers (which were okay but nothing amazing) it was an evening full of having to ask 3 or 4 times for other beverages, even asking for water about 3 times and never getting it( again we were right at the bar, and by now there were maybe only 5 other tables in the whole place being occupied). Finally we were fed up and decided to take our business elsewhere, paid our bill and left. We took our business to another one of the bars in Town Square and were much much more satisfied.  Good drinks, mediocre food, and really, really bad service.",

Totally fine by me because we had front row seats to the amazing acoustical talents of Jeremy Cornwell and a bartender to tend to our every bar needs.    Happy hour, 4-8 pm, included 1/2 off martini's and food specials.  They had me at martini.  The skinny Bitch (blueberry inspired) and the Espresso (self-explanatory) were both good and strong...just how I like my martini.    Swanky place to kick it for a few hours.",

Or it can be Noche Azul on Thursdays for Latin night where the DJ plays genres such as salsa, merengue, bachata, cumbia, or even banda. I have also seen their billboards announcing black tie or little black dress events. The dance floor is not huge, but there's more room outside, although it's not recommended since all the waitresses and people are walking through there. Usually there is different music playing both in side and outside, so you can choose your scene. During the day however it is just like any other restaurant with signature martini's.    Be aware though, you must be 21 and older to enter, they do check id's.",

    "text": "I've been coming here a lot this past year with friends mainly because of it's unbeatable happy hour. I have a lady VIP card and an industry card which entitles you to a free drink and happy hour all the time aside from their normal happy hour times which is from 4-8 pm. So if you're a girl, you must sign up for this incentive!   The food isn't too bad especially at happy hour prices, but I don't think I'd pay for it at normal price. I really really enjoy their lobster salad! It's very light and refreshing yet full of flavor. It has sliced avocados, mango, baby cherry tomatoes, mixed spring, romaine, and iceberg lettuce, and two pieces of lobster. To. Die. For! I also like their spinach and artichoke dip, both of their flatbread choices (margherita & beef tenderloin portobello), beef tenderloin dish, and chicken skewers.   I ordered the baked Brie thinking it would be fantastic. The bread is pretty good, but the cheese for it tasted much too strong. It was brought out with the rest of my appetizers and I was meaning to eat it last which I did, but at that point the cheese seemed like it had hardened so it wasn't that good. The fruit on the plate also was not fresh and made me want to spit it out.   The service is hit or miss depending on the girl's attitude that is serving you that night. Most of them are pretty happy, but there have been instances where my waitress was very unpleasant.   The bands that play are fun most of the time, but I don't generally think of this place as somewhere to go to and dance. It naturally isn't meant for the younger crowd. As some of my friends call it, it is \"cougar town\"! Haha so watch out younger fellas. Most people that come here come after a long day's work to get a drink with their business peers and whatnot. It can get really loud in here too so it's hard to talk and socialize unless you're sitting outside, which can be a pain to find seating some nights. It can get very crowded! So beware if you don't like busy and noisy places.",

No one ever says, \"I'm going to Blue Martini for a great meal.\"  Um, no.  It's always, \"Let's go to Blue Martini for Happy Hour!\" Yes.  I really like that they have so many martinis and that they have skinny girl martini options.  My inner skinny girl (she's in here somewhere) is pleased at whatever prospect is available of cutting calories.  As far as live music goes, it's OK.  Nothing spectacular.  I've seen a couple cover bands there and they're just OK.  The crowd at Blue Martini is kind of a odd one though.  Anyone who's been there knows what I mean.  It's a great spot for people watching though, if that's what you're into.  Normally, I just go here with a couple girlfriends for happy hour then make our way onto our next destination.",

Located in Town Square plaza not too far from the strip, my friends and I came here after deciding we didn't want to deal with the strip and just wanted to be one of the locals. My girlfriend and her boyfriend live in Vegas after all, so we were pretty much half way there.   HH here is amazinggg!! Half off cocktails, which still puts your cocktails anywhere from $6-7 bucks, but so very worth it! I ordered a different martini every time and loved everything I drank. Tried everything my friends ordered and loved theirs too! You seriously, can't go wrong. I fell in love with Blue Martini. Their drinks are fun, delicious and will definitely have you feeling good.   Servers aren't attentive as I like, but they weren't too bad. This venue is a pretty decent size. They have 3 bars, 1 which is located outside. You can hookah outside and their patio is a wrap around so it's pretty big. There was a band at the beginning of the night but as it progress they had a DJ. Small dance floor but it still had a very good energy.   I'm definitely coming back.  I mean, I don't know many other places that make martinis this good. My favorite martini was the Down & Dirty. If you're a dirty martini fan, you're going to love this. Make sure to ask for bleu cheese stuffed olives. Yummmm!!!",

Not a lot of local places in Las Vegas have a cover and as a woman I don't really believe in paying for cover, especially not in this town, but since we were already getting our drink on at Town Square we decided to go there for some dancing.   After we got our drinks we proceeded to get a table outside. The cocktail waitress was very unfriendly and uninviting, it was a Saturday so I decided to let it slide. Since the cocktail waitress wasn't really around to get us our second round of drinks (these were not included as the time lapse had expired) I went to the bar to order them,  the bartender was douchey and arrogant.   Also there's hookah servers, we ordered one and that took a while, again, it was a Saturday so I was understanding. The bowl itself didn't last very long and the hookah server was difficult to locate.   Overall: poor service but fun environment, diverse crowd",

    "text": "Another Town Square joint going down the tubes. First they change their food menu. Service used to be slow, It's only gotten slower... the place was pretty empty and a took a while just to get noticed. Another table that was there before us, got waited on after us. Their martini's aren't as good as they use to be either. I think they stopped trying. I have only been going here recently because my friend loves cheap eats and happy hour pricing, She likes everything, I've never heard her complain about any place she's ever been. I like the free Martini with movie ticket deal and the Lady's Blue Martini card, drinking for free is never a bad thing. The food is average.  I rather pay the money and get quality food, drinks, and service.",

Was surprised how busy it was in the patio considering the weather has been on and off. Angie was our server and was extremely nice and made great recommendations. There were no questions asked when we returned the flatbread (my husband can be picky) She connected with us and made my husband and I feel comfortable. I had no idea there was music and dancing so we'll definitely be back for that!! Also happy hour prices are awesome",

    "text": "I would give this place zero stars after the experience my friends and I had last night. We waited 1 hour to get in which was not a problem because it was expected being that it's Memorial Day weekend. Once we get to the front we stand there for another 5-7 mins and then the doorman told us that our guy friend could not get in because he was wearing camouflage print. He began to state that women can wear whatever they want but men can not. We asked if there was anything anywhere stated about the dress code because we tend to recommend this place to a lot of our guest that stay at our resort. He said it's corporate that has these dress codes in place. So still confused and embarrassed we begin to get out of line he whispered to us that if we slide him something he will talk to management and let us in. At that point we are all offended because is that the dress code or not because I can give you money on the low to get in and then on top of that still pay $40 just to get in. So how is that ok to tip the doorman so he can speak to the manager to allow my friend in. Had we had \"slid him something\" would we have been kicked out once security or a manager spotted my friend in his camouflage and have to leave?! That was the worst experience and the fact that we had other friends who were planning on coming that night was a huge mistake and I can no longer recommend this place to anyone else because of the bad service from the doorman.",

The thing is, it is not bring the kind of crowed it use to. The music ranges from mediocre to just shoot me already. After last night's experience, we will not be going back.  Although this did not happen to me this time, the server padded the bill of another couple we were with. Not sure if she thought she could get away with it since my friends were drunk.   Its sad really. This place use to be one of our favorites about 4 years ago.",

    "text": "We thought Blue Martini would be the best place for my sisters birthday/deployment going away party, due to the fact we have been here several times and had great service....after this experience I must say I had mixed reviews.      Her boyfriend was charged $500 to hold an area of the bar for our private event which came with appetizers. I thought this was relatively cheap figuring we had our own space and it came with some pretty good appetizers. It came with spinach artichoke dip/chips, chicken skewers, and lobster egg rolls all of that was delicious.     Also when we were introduced to our waitress Erica she didn't even see happy to being doing our event; she could have cared less and didn't even smile. It was automatic bad vibes she had this resting bitch face the whole time. We decided to open a $200 bar tab with the waitress and we're admant that it was to be $200 and to cut it off. At first she came around maybe two times but she really didn't ask people if they wanted drinks;just came and walked through and walked out. After awhile we saw her less and less and then nothing at all. Several of our guests started to complain, and had to go track her down to order their drinks or went to the bar to buy drinks themselves. We found out she wasn't even tracking our tab due to the fact it went over, $110 over!!! Keeping in mind half way through the event we asked about the tab and she said \"oh you guys should be fine\". She was lucky we were in a good mood bc we had agreed only to a $200 tab and ended up paying $310! Terrible terrible waitress we had to get a manager involved and even then she acted like an even bigger bitch after that but at least she showed up more.     Now a positive staff review our bus boy I can't remember his name but he looked like the basketball player Stephen Curry. He had an amazing smile and was happy and positive the whole time! He was on top of cleaning our area and keeping the chips stocked. When Erica failed to deliver he was always willing to step up. I gladly tipped him $20 just for being amazing. We loved him he needs a raise!!!     All in all our waitress sucked but our bus boy was amazing; I'd take him any day over her! The appetizers were really good and we were  conveniently located in the back close to the bathrooms and outside balcony area. It was kind of hot in there though we did notice and the area they gave us wasn't big enough for the amount of guest we had, but it worked. We may consider coming here again, but would be more strict on bar tab and not having a bitch waitress. Oh and they added automatic gratuity on top of her shitty service, knowing she was terrible they should have let us have an option. She earned 20% by not even servicing us and having our guests go to her...pisses me off! Probably would come here with a small gathering of friends but I am unsure if I would plan an event here again.",

Its a nice place to hang out and people watch and also enjoy strong martini's.  Their drink's are very pricey, but it is good and worth it.  They have a big variety of different martini's to choose from and they serve your martini with the shaker so you can fill your glass another time.  Our server was very nice and attentive and they are all good looking too..   Hint---check into yelp and you may also see a 25% off discount for your tab too or check into 4square and you can get a free drink ticket....Just show the hostess and she will give you a complimentary cocktail pass...which is good for a drink...saves you a good $10-15, because that's the average price of 1 martini.  I went there with 2 others and we had the mango, almond joy, pomegranate, caramel apple, and peach martini and they were all delicious!!! If you have a sweet tooth, definitely go for the almond joy martini, the glass is rimmed with coconut flakes...  Even though this is way off the strip (located at the town square) it was worth the $20 taxi ride to get away from the madness on the strip...I will definitely be back.. They need to open one of these in SoCal..",

It's in a semi new shopping plaza with lots of shops, restaurants, bars, and a movie theatre.  Locals come here to party if they don't feel like going to a casino club and fight to get through long lines and parking.  So coming here is a very good alternative.  Mixed crowd and the age range varies.  Their drinks are cheaper than most of the LV nightclubs/bars.  You can also dance, their resident DJ is pretty good, and they have like two main bars.  I like chillin' in their outdoor patio bar, smoking a cig, and pounding on my drinks.  It's very chill and their staff are all nice.  The men's restroom is pretty cool as well.  Instead of a hand dryer or napkins, you get an actual hand washcloth.  After you're through drying your hands, just dump it in the bin.  Very cool.  Price to get in was $10 and the line was about 10 feet long.  Awesome!  I'd come back here again.",

They servers are sexy ladies. The drinks are strong. They restaurant is clean and they even have an attendant in the bathroom. The Blue Martini is located in the town square on the south side of las vegas blvd. Check it out!",

I love las Vegas! but Las Vegas Blue Martini, they are a joke! I went there with my boyfriend because I read that supposedly now it is a local hot spot but we couldn't enter just because our outfit!  We didn't went with tshirts and flip flops. It is like the other girl's review its a BAR!!!!! in a Mall. Come on! I do not want to sound arrogant but we have a clear fashion sense! My boyfriend who is a model went with a style fashion tennis that for sure the door man want them to have but he didn't allow the entrance just because my boyfriend didn't have a fancy shoes. We went to other hot places like TAO, Ghost Bar at Palms, Lavo,Jet! which they are NIGHTCLUBS and my boyfriend went with the similar outfit (fashion tennis) and we did not have any problem with the entrance. Actually  he received a lot of compliments from the door guys of those places. I think that the Blue Martini staff should modify the strict code or at least give to the door guys some fashion lessons to teach them how to recognize a good outfit from a bad outfit. We were just a nice couple that wanted to have some drinks and have good time in the supposedly local hot spot. Do not ruin the locals reputation with these poor impressions. I think they lost and they will keep losing from others customers like us. We still love LAS VEGAS!!",

Drinks weren't that hard to get as I thought it would be with people crowding around the bar.  The food was pretty good such as the lobster taco.  The place is a lot bigger than I would've thought  it was going to be.  Live music played.  There was no cover before 11:30, but my friends had to pay $5 to get in.  There's a small dance floor.  It was definitely a 30's crowd in there.  Drink prices felt close to club prices.  The inside decor was also pretty nice.  Service for food was hard to get, however.  It took a good 30-40 min before a waitress came back to order food.  Not much of a place to chill since if it's so hard to find a table.  Some people tried to charge us $20, and they would've let us take their table.  Obviously, we didn't take it because they were going to leave anyways.  Atmosphere's ok.  There is a dress code.  No hats, shorts, and basketball shoes.  Chucks are acceptable.",

    "text": "Went to Blue Martini after work with friends the past two Fridays.....  I love Town Square..... buuutttt..... The Blue Martini, although extremely crowded with patrons, misses the mark a bit for me..... it is much more of a \"meat market\" than anything else..... which makes for some definitely interesting people watching......  love sitting back watching people's \"technique\".....  It is a very large establishment, but, yet there is still no room to move... guess that is good for their bottom line but, not so much if you actually want to move around and talk to people..... get there way earlier than you want to if you want to score a table..... I recommend the outside patio.... still crowded but at least you can both inhale and exhale and if you are so inclined as to carry on a conversation, you are more likely to hear if you are not inside.......  I don't know about the other poster's paying a cover charge... didn't have to pay either time...... maybe I was there waaayyy earlier than I would have liked to be???",

    "text": "I love the Town Square location and have been a patron since it first opened.  I've been familiar with Blue Martini since it opened in Orlando and the one here in Vegas is just a nice.  Blue Martini is often a very popular bar so if you intend on going make sure you get there before 10pm.  Otherwise, be prepared to stand, shoulder to shoulder with other patrons desperate to find a chair or table.  Blue Martini is a great locals bar and while the menu lacks a diverse selection of appetizers or entrees, what is on the menu is typically much better than your average bar food.  Lastly, guys make sure you wear dress shoes else you'll be heading someplace else for your drinks.  Blue Martini frowns upon sneakers so dress nicely.",

Talk about a sausage fest!  I was hit on by at least a dozen butt-faced boneheads in the 45 minutes I was able to stomach this place.  Butt-faced in this case refers to both the people and their condition.  If you're into (to borrow from a previous reviewer) douchebags and doubaggery, then you've hit the motherload!    There were more goofballs there with fake tans, coked-out eyes, highlighted faux-hawks and Ben Sherman \"Vegas-shirts\" than at a Jersey bachelor party!    Some girls might read this description and say \"Count me in!\".  They get 2 stars for the room.  Well done.  Potentially great place, but infected by the douchebagism.  Have fun, chix with skank-striped hair, orange skin, stripper voices, and tramp stamps!  You are going to love the Blue Mar-tini-weeney!",

You can have a lot of different drink prepared for you with half price.  There are a few choices bar food. It used to be everything half price during happy hours. Now that some are only a quarter off. Still, some are half priced.   The lemon pepper chicken comes in 4 skewers of nice and tendered chicken meat. The veggie slider looks nice and taste great. Beef tenderloin and portabella flatbread are very thin sliced but fun to pair with those nice looking drinks  The place is usually packed in happy hour. Today it is very easy to find a good seat probably because of Christmas Eve  The service is super friendly and nice. Will certainly keep coming back.",

When you say that it makes you violently ill and have a bit of shock when you realize that you are going to be sick for about five days due to her lack of care to actually check with the kitchen that is a complete disregard for the customer's health and well being. She brought the check with no regard that she had poisoned my husband. I asked to talk to a manager (Sean) and he listened to what happened then took $6 off our bill for the offending dish. That's not even close to compensating for the pain and suffering that ensues. Thank you, but I prefer to patronize a business that takes their customer's health and well being seriously and can't recommend Blue Martini in good conscience.",

On top of that, when I visited in mid-December, I was told to remove my baseball cap, charged $5 for a \"security\" fee on top of the $20 cover charge (applied to men only) and when I left the establishment, the Blue Martini and their staff had lost my hat entirely!  Gone.  Someone STOLE it.  They told me to screw off and after I wouldn't leave and demanded to speak to a manager, he begrudingly gave me $40 to replace the hat.  Terrible, terrible, terrible time.  DO NOT GO HERE.  There are PLENTY of other great places in Las Vegas that would be happy to treat you and your belongings with courtesy and respect.  Avoid this place at all costs!",

Boyfriend said this is a place where a lot of the locals go. And with good reason! It was poppin on the Saturday night that I graced Blue Martini with my prescense. LOL.  It was much bigger than I expected.. I always pass by it but never realized how big it was. There's a nice outdoor area, nice bar areas, and a super crowded dance floor. Although it was crowded, everyone was having sweaty fun!  The only thing I hate... the trance/techno/house music that comes on around closing time. Sorry all you trance techno house music lovers. Just not my preference.  The drinks were good. I got an AMF. Strong. Not so tasty. But that's how they usually taste right?  I would definitely come out here to party it up and hang out with good friend. Drinks. Food. Music. OUTDOOR AIR. I LOVE IT!",

I came here on a Wednesday night/Thursday morning at like 2am, and it was packed wall to wall.  They were charging $10 cover, and there was a quick line.  Didn't even get a drink it was so annoyingly packed with douchebags, so I probably won't be back, or at least not at night.  My buddy said Wednesdays are ladies night, hence all of the craziness, and it's much chiller on a Friday night.  Maybe I'll give that a shot sometime.",

I thought I had died and gone to Vodka heaven :)   It has more than a few bars, indoor and out, a stage raised above the main bar with a live band that plays along as you sing your favorite song.  Drinks were great and service was good, I got there at 12:30 PM so I didn't get to eat but they do serve food there also.   After the singing is done they have a local Dj Spinning the tunes so you can shake your booty on the dance floor. He was awesome!!   Make this place a must visit if in Vegas!!",

The ambiance is pretty nice for a lounge. I loved the outside area, which has a patio that goes around the building; You can see the beautiful, night view of the Town Square shopping area. There was a band that played before the regular DJ was on. The band was probably from So Cal, since they played California Love and bunch of old school hip hop songs like No Diggity and Yeah! by Usher. It was kind of weird though...the band members looked punk rockish, were white, and were singing hip hop??! It was crazy...a weird, surprise...  The dance floor was really small; This place is definitely not the place to go if you want that club scene feel...  As for the drinks...kind of pricey. I liked the mango martini, as it didn't taste too strong. The service here needs some work. We had to track down waiters/waitresses to order a drink..  Other than that....an ok place to hang out with friends when you just want to chill...",

Let's put it in clearer terms...a Bar & Grille at a mall...your expectations shouldn't be that high, yet I was impressed with the setup. The bouncers were really cool with me seeing that I was from out of town and I was wearing jeans with kicks and they didn't stress me. The only rant I have at this place is $20 cover???? Are you f**kin kidding me? I guess its coz its vegas, but still. The crowd was chill when we went, which was a Friday. It was actually a really nice atmosphere. Then again the place wasn't too crowded.   They had a live band playing and when they would come off, they had a DJ spinning...if that's what you call it...hahaha...The talent in this place was cool. Not too much plastic and  very diverse. The drinks are great prices, then again I made buddies with 2 of the bartenders and they took care of me, but that's coz I took care of them. Good looking people...good looking waitresses...good looking bartender...and a good looking place for my expectations.   Overall, I would come back to this place, but try and not pay the $20 to get in...oh and surprisingly...they have bottle and table service. Really? At a bar at the mall? and they close at 4AM? Really? YES!!!",

It was our 10th Anniversary and Brian, who dropped off our platter told the DJ who posted a message on the screen wishing us a Happy 10th Anniversary.  Our waitress, Amanda was really sweet.  She brought out a nice chocolate cake for us to enjoy on our anniversary. The only negative I could really say is that it was Salsa Night so we expected the Band to play Salsa music but they played more modern Latin music (stuff you could hear on the radio). We actually enjoyed it more every time the DJ played music, everyone got up and danced. We would definitely come back in the future.",

The service was pretty good.  50 bucks and free drinks till 10 sounds like my kind of place for NYE. The drinks are strong which is perfect if you're looking to get your buzz on.  I recommend the cosmopolitan and the lemon drop. The band is great and the DJ even better. I may just have to try to book my birthday here.",

I mentioned the roach to a server and he just looked at me and walked away to the bar. He got some towels and cleaning spray and just rubbed it on the couch as he didn't care. We went to the bar and I asked for a manager, she was polite but still seemed as making up a story about the roaches. She bought me and my friend a round of drinks but that is not the point. They should close down and really detail the whole place. Disgusting and shocked!! God knows how the kitchen is and they are serving food with roaches outside!! NEVER NEVER TO GO THERE AGAIN!!!",

So the manager apologize because we just flew into town and came straight here after eating and invited us back on Thursday. So we finally returned only to be turned away at the door because of my camouflage $400 jeans but the white boys got in wearing cut up and ripped up clothing. This is why the blue Martini Lounge franchise are closing. Starting with the Tampa location.",

We spent $150 on a bottle of vodka and the bouncer wouldn't let us leave with the bottle, so I understood and said we would just stay a little longer and finish the bottle before we left. The bounce told us that we could do that because \"the bottle was his, we couldn't have any.\" When we asked for the manager he said he was the manager, and threatened to call the police on us. The entire time this was happening he had some girl on his arm drinking and repeating everything he said like a parrot. I've never been so disappointed in the customer service especially since the waitress said we could finish the bottle. I've been to blue martini multiple times and I've brought many friends and I'm just so disappointed in the service. I hope something is done about the bouncer. It was 1-2am, March 31st. We spent $150 on a bottle and we got hookah as well. So disappointed.",

But we were invited to a private party, so who can resist unlimited free booze and food??    Servers were very efficient, and we never had to wait very long to give a drink order or get the drink.  Lots of different appetizers were served, finger foods that were mostly fried.  Pigs in blankets, mini crab cakes, and a host of others that were tasty.  Though I usually don't order them, I couldn't resist, since this was dinner for us. There were plenty of tables for seating.  An excellent cover band was playing, but unfortunately I never did get their name.  Good music, and the girl singer had a great voice.  Great evening at Blue Martini, and hope not to stay away as long!",

    "text": "Located at Town Square this is a happening place  for food and local entertainment. There are 2 VIP rooms and three cabanas available to rent. Live music plays every night, featuring a rotation of local bands and different music genres. Happy hour is from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. each evening, featuring half-off many drinks and all food. There are fours bars, and one is part of an outdoor patio.  Let me tell you I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of food. Being that this is more bar place than a dining establishment the menu offered a variety of tapas fit for Foodies ranging from healthy to not so healthy. If you love Lobster and are also trying to stay within the healthy category I highly recommend the lobster salad. Just take a look at the picture of the size of lobster that was presented in this beautiful bowl of greens with a very light vinaigrette on the side. The chicken skewer was such a HUGE serving.  I would have liked to have more of the pesto sauce on the side for dipping. The lychee martini was done exactly as I asked. I don't like sugary drinks so they cut down the sweetness as requested and so it was perfect for me. Taste like the tropics for sure. Entertainment that night was outstanding as well. A tip is to sit a little bit away from the stage so that you can enjoy conversation with your guest. The only negative comment is for their signature drink the Blue Martini. I don't know what is in it but it does not taste high-quality unfortunately. Can't wait to go back and listen to another band. Can't beat the happy hour prices which includes entertainment.",

Wow, why have I just discovered this place now! Anyways schools in here we go!   Attending a private event that is hosted by the LBD society. This is where they had the said event. Of course this is Vegas once my name was verified on the list you get waved by! Yeah security does not feel you up up or even fondle with a wand.  The private event is in the back and they are sampling Veuve Clicquot champagne. It is really smooth and dry. It goes down the pallet nicely. As part of the event we can explore all Blue has to offer here.  I like what I see the band is about to play and this band sits behind the bar and bartenders. Very happening and they are quite good too! This is the first time that I have seen a band behind a bar! So props to this idea. It's brilliant.   The bartenders energy is intoxicating and pleasant. They are trying to make us patrons cheer and make some noise for the band that is playing. My cheers were no different I gladly supported the band.   The band continues to play and with such an instrumental precision the songs every one knows and continues to flood the dance floor. So many ladies I even met two knew lady friends from out of town that need dance partners have joined with. Amazing we are having so much fun! Cheers to new friends!  In the midst of all the chaos a cocktail waitress decided to come my ways and wow decided to order food too! Yes, with this being Vegas they have that here too! Amazing food at the best and most amazing happening venue in town or at least it should be!   More or less this place seems to be the ladies hot spot since more ladies occupy the Blue Martini than the boys. It's ladies day tonight and it's not even the special ladies night celebrating times. In Vegas ladies this is where we gather for a great time it's on my list now baby! Met so many wonderful ladies tonight too!  Decided to order something since the fabulous Erica came around and took my order. I ordered the Beef and Portable Morning Mushroom; accompanied with Champagne with Strawberries such a great pairing too. This is the fantastic food that I talked about not sure what we had over the champagne earlier since too many drinks ago; but it involved chocolate.   The staff here is so concerned about our safety that one of the ladies of our group spilled here drink, we do this when too lit! He came over and had us move in order to clean up so one of us did not hurt ourselves. Such compassionate and caring staff thanks looking out for us when some of us cannot. I am giving him a shout out now! This nameless Superman took charge when no one else knew or would.   So now you know where us local ladies call home and jump around. Come on out ladies certain nights of the week after 10 pm get open bar! Yeah! Plus such a rocking place to come celebrate being a lady let's go ! See you all there now off to the bar baby! See you on the dance floor!",

Plenty of seating, spacious outdoor seating with a bar outside as well as a bar on the inside. They also have a stage for live music.

This place is actually huge, but it was a Tuesday night and me and my Bro wanted to chill and have a few more brews before we said good bye and until next time.      Ambiance here is a really chill vibe, DJ was spinning like it was early Friday night.  The clientele wear diverse, young money, well todo, classy hood, grown and sexy professionals.      The surprise was they had Hookahs.  Now if you never heard of a Shisha pipe it's cool, it was before vaping and well long before rolling cigars.  Think \"Alice in Wonderland Caterpillar\". And you know what a Hookah is.  Not many flavors on the menu but skittles was a neat flavor.  Once the hookah showed up.  It felt like a place called \"Osan Lounge\".  Them military cats know what that is if they have been to the Pen.      A must to hit up even on a Tuesday night if you want to hit a club but not a packed club with tourist.  Lastly give some love to the Brother working the restroom.  He made a classy experience more classy.",

I'll was very impressed on how attentive she was with our table during that hectic and busy atmosphere. I didn't drink any alcohol but had a rare headache the next day and I come back to work to hear this place was on Dirty Dining twice is very disturbing. I can't say the food gave it to me because thank God I didn't get food poisoning. On the another note, the Neo Soul after party was lovely",

We stayed past happy hour and kept drinking and as the night went by people kept coming in. Approximately at 10pm one of the security guards came to our table abruptly and told us we had a few seconds to clear our table due to our table being reserved. We all looked astonished and asked why if there wasn't a reserved sign on our table and there were plenty of empty tables around us. The waitress saw what happened and quickly talked to him. After that it was a displeasing feeling and we just left. Although the food and drinks were great I don't think we'll be back. The security guard left an unpleasant feeling towards their establishment.",

They play Spanish music of all kinds especially merengue, cumbia, salsa, reggaeton and much more.  . I was very happy with my drinks they were well made a bit pricey but I didn't mind if they are a good drink! They don't look like a cheap ass club that waters down drinks.   The servers and waitress were very nice helpful and social which makes a huge difference in a club and sets the pleasant mood. I don't think that it was bc we went with an exclusive group and had VIP service but it look like they treated people all around very well. That makes me smile!!!!   They are on the top floor the space looks clean the restrooms were good at all times of the night when I went in there after all the sweating and drinking I was doing lol   I love this place!",

And I mean those that not only failed admittance as a blackjack dealer for the dollar per hand spot, but also pretty much any 'bar tending school' with a graduation rate somewhere in between 100% and 100%. What a statistical anomaly. A peculiarity.  Bartender charged me $41 plus for a single bud light by mistake. She made an oopsie doopsie . However, she , nor the bartenders , nor the management apparently had the technological fortitude or extemporaneous logistical  creativity to produce a 'void' receipt.  And my temper flared. I do t know if they're trying to scam me but they gave me their Las Vegas  'word' that I shall not receive any False charge on my card. Well, that's nice and dandy and all, but do I have proof? Apparently not.  All establishments , shady or otherwise possess these provisions. To do so would be a dereliction of their fiduciary duty. They need to safeguard customer transactions.   F   They didn't even offer me a comp to the correct , but still overpriced charge of a seven dollar bud light.  Wouldn't recommend this one.",

If they're having trouble with certain negative clientele there are better ways to handle it other than offending the general public. If they're gathering marketing information, wisen up!

A gentleman brought us water and then no one came until we hunted someone down. Each of the waitresses kept saying someone would be with us but it took a painfully long time, 20 minutes at least.   There was no indication of it being ladies night on the menu or otherwise. My friend knew from having come before. She recalled she received a free drink and the rest were half off. I in-fact read this on yelp later. See attached picture. We also weren't informed until we asked about it. We forgot to mention the comp drink but it also wasn't offered to us. That would've been a great move tip wise had she brought that to our attention.   We enjoyed our drinks but half way through the music was turned up incredibly loud to the point that people were moving away to quieter areas. I saw several people complain but the music wasn't turned down regardless.   I liked the open patio seating. The mists were on to make it more comfortable. Bathroom was clean, so there's that.   I'd return, it definitely seems to be a fun place. I do hope the attentiveness of their staff improves along with their consistency, music at the request of patrons.",

We were there to celebrate her birthday by having a few drinks and dinner but what came next floored me. Just so you're aware we've been there several times before, just not in the last few months. 1st...They asked for ID I'm 62 so this isn't to see if your 21 this is a privacy grab of personal information. 2nd..They sat us down on the patio 108' at the time and brought out a small bottle of Vodka and said $200 please just as if we got a table at a night club.....wow....when did they go night life especially at 6:30!!??? At that point I said we are not paying for a bottle and you need to put us inside out of the sun. To quote the server  \"I've already opened the bottle\"....lol my comment was I don't care, give it to the bar so they can use it and let me talk with your manager. She walked away really upset and returned 5 minutes later and took her bottle never to be seen again nor did we ever see the manager.  They moved us inside and limited us to where we could sit and switched servers on us twice in 10  minutes. After sitting and enjoying happy hour for as long as it lasted along comes our server to ask us for payment for drinks and food while we are still ordering food and drinks.  Keep in mind we hadn't ordered dinner yet and they're asking us for money.....while privately other employees we're saying we don't do it that way. I'm sorry Blue Martini you failed this long time resident and customer to the point I'll never be back.",

The interior is quite huge, and I love the layout of their outdoor versus indoor so that you can get a breath of fresh air.   The music is decent. It's definitely not a place for hooking up if you're single. Most people stay with their own group and it's really more of a \"hang out with your friends\" type of place than meeting strangers.",

Also, if you are sitting inside, and they have live music, you will not hear you neighbor, it gets very loud.

I understand that given those facts, I am not really reviewing this place as a whole, but for a place that I know has a wide selection of strong martinis and outdoor seating I'm happy.

It's loud, they have live music, which is loud, the crowd is on the younger side, and loud, and the atmosphere is party, party.  So, for these reasons, I give it a low rating because it's not my cup of tea.  The outdoor patio is nice in the summer, at least there you can hear yourself think over the loud music and conversations but since they have removed the grilled lamb chops form the appetizer menu, there is really not reason to go there.  Unless you are 30 something:-)",

    "text": "Blue Me  I hate this five star system. There's just too much nonsense among the staff and absence in detail to justify a positive rating on its own. However, the customers, the energy is so alive and playful that we have to go three.   How to begin? First off, $10 cover for a bar that's off the main strip, eh...although they did have a good DJ Gilbarba who kept the beat going so well that even the uncoordinated white men were bumping and grinding.  The lighting, spectacular. The bar set up, artistic. The staff, attractive and in sharp uniforms.  But maybe the worst service I've ever seen for a club like this. I started off at a high top just removed from the bar, and even though there were hookahs, which should mean servers, no one stopped by to ask if I needed anything. And when I went to the bar to get a drink, the bar top was covered in old drinks and trash. (As were all the high tops and surfaces inside the club. It was as if every one came in, ordered once, and then the servers all went home.) It was so disgusting that eventually I got to a point where I felt no need to use an ashtray...just use the ground, they didn't care, why would anyone else.  I went to the bar for a drink, the girl looks at me and says, \"one minute\". Did she go serve another customer? NO she went to a group of friend and told jokes and giggled. When the server stopped by to ask me if I needs anything and I said 'water', did they come back? NO. I must have seen 5-6 different servers standing in a sowing circle bullshitting while the entire room looked like the remains of a child's birthday party. Only once did I see who I can ploy assume is the GM make his way about the floor. And even after he pointed out the problems, the room remained a mess.  The floor plan is interesting. There's an outside and patio area that's kind of nice. A quieter removed section that allows for easier conversation and clean air. But the main room, terrible set up. You can barely see the dance floor from the dance floor. There's huge columns or angles in the way of a clear view. And the best spot for viewing anything good was filled by a DJ who just stands there. I think we need to rethink the layout. However, having said all that, the mix of persons is a very cool collection from all races ages and personalities. The dress, was a nice comfortable casual dress when you could see sexy outfits along with stylish wardrobes to jeans and sweaters. The kind of acceptance that makes you feel you're always in the right place.  In closing I almost have to say that this place is great, in spite of itself.  Although, it was definitely more of a ladies place than for men, at least in regards to the male:female ratio.   Would I go again? That's the problem..maybe, if I knew there was a reason to. But just to catch the regular party, not likely. More like a 2.5 than a 3, at least as far a nightlife goes. The saddest thing is, that 2.5 could easily be a 4-5. Just needs someone to hammer the nails.",

However, when the drinks are half-off (i.e. happy hour) or free (i.e. private party), it's not so bad. The bartenders definitely pour the drinks quite strong (think almost straight vodka). And the martinis can be quite tasty (if not overly strong) - and there's a nice, expansive menu of them.  And there's a live cover band some nights, which isn't too bad. And there's live band karaoke some nights too, which is kinda awesome.  All in all, it's an alright place. But I definitely won't be becoming a regular here anytime soon.",

We ended up just asking for a tab (for the one item of 7 we ordered that we actually received) so we could leave. And by asking for a tab, I mean getting up and locating the server on two occasions to request it since no one was stopping by our table. The first time the two servers blamed each other but did nothing to assist. The next time we finally asked to see a manager. He was equally incompetent and made excuses, that the restaurant was busy. He didn't have an explanation as to why all other customers around us were getting their orders in a reasonable time frame. I'm never going back to this place. There is no excuse for spending an hour and a half in a restaurant and receiving nothing but an attitude.",

There must have been a change in management that is trying to turn it into a club atmosphere. The only thing missing is the rope line!  Unfortunately, they have a dress code after 8pm and its strictly enforced. I was dressed nicely in a polo shirt with loafers but was refused entry because they won't admit anyone in shorts. It doesn't matter that its a Wednesday or that its 100 degrees in Vegas tonight. Ridiculous if you ask me.  I can get a drink in a less pretentious spot downstairs at the Yardhouse.",

Over priced on there sugared down martini's (I don't know about you but I dont care for 2 cups of sugar in my drinks). Its sad that a place like this still survives in a city with some of the best Chefs and Bartenders in the world living in it. I would rather pay more for a drink someone put time into they just slaps it all together and calls it a great cocktail.

Use to be my spot for happy hour and a good place to bring people from out of town.This was my first time after happy hour. The appetizer menu has gotten shorter once again.

I couldn't even help but ask her before she was done pouring \"Uhh, am I going to get 2 full glasses out of this???\" She paused and smiled. Sure enough the 2nd pour was barely half full. For 12 bucks! Hell no I will stick with happy hour from 4-8 where at least I won't be that pissed off for a 6.00 Martini that I won't get 2 full glasses out of.

Last night we had cousins visiting us in Vegas from out of town, so we took them to Blue Martini for some drinks before dinner. It seemed clear that BM was cutting back in response to the economy. The happy hour special changed from 50% off to 40% off and we all agreed that the fruity specialty drinks we ordered seemed watered down with little to no alcohol. We usually stay for several rounds of drinks & even get some food, but after being immediately underwhelmed with the first round, we packed it up & went next door. What a disappointing change.",

    "text": "Viva Las Vagueness!  Man, they ruined that song by turning it into a Viagra commercial. Can I get a witness? I mean, seriously. I hear that song and I start seeing blue, which brings me to my review of Blue Martini.   Here's how it breaks out, and let's start with the good:  1. Hot patrons (for me, the women). 2. Hot waitresses (yes, they're female as well) 3. Large and roomy venue. 4. Indoor AND outdoor space. 5. Waitresses=hot. 6. Did i mention there were a large number of attractive women of the female persuasion there? 7. The place was mostly populated by locals, which gets you away from the rotund, behemouth, gargantuan, midwestern, muumuu-clad tourists that seem to permeate the Las Vagueness vicinity. 8. See numbers 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 above. 9. They have a happy hour that offsets #2 under the \"not as good\" section below. Unfortunately, we weren't at it.  Bah. 10. They're open LATE, i.e., like 4:00am.  The not as good:  1. My \"Blue Martini\" was blue, but it wasn't a martini. It was also overly sweet.  They have other \"martinis\" that I didn't try, but perhaps those are better.  2. $12 martinis feels like NYC, price-wise, and let's be serious; this is Vegas, not NY. 3. $6 domestic beers. 3a. $8 foreign beers. 4. The lovely waitresses lost one of my party's credit card.  That kind of put a damper on the evening temporarily. 5. Service was a little uneven, but we got hugs from the waitress, so uh, let's just leave it at that. 6. At a venue filled with hot chiquitaz, they managed to seat us next to a table full of gay men, which would have been ok, except one of them was rubbing his ass up against me after having hit on me.  I could have lived without that, mos' def. 7. It's a little ways out of town, and as any of you who have been to Vegas recently knows, cab rides are freakin' astronomical. Don't be surprised when it costs some bucks to get there, but hell, you're in Vegas where ponying up is part of the reason you go, am I right?  Overall, this is a fun joint. The band was playing bad cover tunes, but hey, it's Vegas, you can forgive them. It was more than made up for by the quality of the eye candy therein, etc, and what have you. In between band sets they played some cool 80's tunes, which seemed to work nicely.  If you're in Las Vagueness, hit up Blue Martini. I'll be sure to go there again next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "Went to Blue Martini on a Wednesday with a gal friend of mine whom I asked to show me to a local spot. Upon getting to the front of the line, I saw a familiar face from back home (what are the odds) and he let me and my friend in without cover. Started off good so far.  I began ordering drinks, and they were so much more affordable than what I had spent over the weekend on the strip. It was definitely refreshing to see some normal-ish prices. The bar was quick and efficient even though it was a very busy night. Cute blond bartender girls were very friendly. I kinda stuck around the bar for a while with my friend and she volunteered to be my wing woman. I thought this could potentially be a great idea. And there were plenty of pretty girls there, but I realized one thing in the middle of it... A lot of people there already knew one another.. Definitely a locals spot.  The thing I love most about Vegas, is just meeting random people from all over the country/world. And normally people on vacay are so much more open to meeting new people as well. The thing about local spots is a lot of girls and guys travel in packs and they already have their little clique. Even in big cities, this tends to be the case because people usually meet up with too many friends of the opposite sex. Although, I pretty much knew most of the relationships in the bar were platonic, I wasn't about to set the wrong jealous friend off. Plus I was having such a great time with my friend, drinking and dancing. She was a great hostess!!  Blue Martini was a good little experience for me. I'd try it again, but for a traveler/visitor.. I would definitely recommend the parties on the strip...",

    "text": "Ok so everyone is always talking about Blue Martini when I'm in Vegas.  So I finally tried it along with my girlfriend and I have to say it was a good time. It's in the Townsquare shopping center which I like anyways, so it's super convenient and you don't have to deal with the crazy strip crowd.  It was a friday night though so it was kind of busy.  We both got free drink tickets downstairs from some guy that works there so that was cool...and they let us use them on kettleone martinis so that was another plus.  All of the open tables were marked \"reserved\" which was confusing but then they let us sit there??  Weird but whatever. We ordered the tuna, chicken and bruschetta and shared everything, but it came out in like 5 minutes, which always makes me feel rushed.  I like to enjoy my nights out with cocktails and friends though so it could have taken longer--not like they wanted us to eat and leave, or maybe they just microwave everything? So the bill came and I almost died it was so inexpensive I thought it was a mistake!  I asked the waitress and she told me it was Happy Hour and that everything was 50% off, plus our drinks were free:)   Love love love it. We would have stayed longer but the crowd wasn't that exciting to creep on and I didn't want to have another cocktail when I was driving so we left, but I would totally go back next time I'm out with a gf in Vegas:)",

But we came early before they really started playing dance music. The ambiance was really nice. It was a little bit crowded, but not so bad that we couldn't move. I WAS NOT feeling the music. Which is the reason we left. But if your not too picky about music you'll probably like this place. I still had a great time.",

    "text": "Blue Martini in Las Vegas has a lot going for it. I went there on a Wednesday night and so might not be the best night to judge the location but I digress. Any faithful reader of my reviews understands that I am a bit different with the way I use my stars and how I write my reviews. Firstly it's a loud happening place where you'll find (from what I've been told) the local crowd in Vegas. I hate loud happening places, so were off to a good start. The bar is part of a shopping plaza right before you get on the strip and so you won't find the throngs of tourists that wonder like fiends (or zombies depending on what casino your in front of). I find that really appealing, because there are several locations to escape the noise and talk with the people your with, they just aren't located at BM. The bar has a large dance floor that is full of pretty (and not so pretty) people dancing. There are, in typical Vegas fashion, over priced drinks and killer views both on the patio and the dance floor.    There was a live band that night playing OK music. The mixture of drinks, people dancing an the fact that the motto for the night was \"its Vegas baby\" moved people to be a bit more liberal in regards to dancing, yours truly included.    I'll give blue Martini two stars because while it would be a top bar in most cities, but without ninja's, a car chases, and a healthy dose of bullet dodging I was disappointed. Now I don't care much for expensive trendy drinks, or loud music, or just about anything that BM has going for it. That being the case everyone I was with really enjoyed it. I would like to a quieter patio (like the 16th floor of the M resort) where I can escape and have a drink and  talk without auditory assault in the form of Kanye West via cover band. I bet your asking yourself why did I go if I don't like those places? Simple, Its Vegas baby!",

    "text": "My friend chose this place since it was her bday and we were supposed to go to a tapas place first.  Since BM had happy hour and a good menu to choose from.....we just passed up the tapas place and went straight to Blue Martini.  We got seated in the VIP area since it was still available but was informed if someone reserves it later....we would have to move...which was ok.  We ordered so much since it was almost like tapas dishes.  Not too big but great to share with others so we can taste almost everything on the menu.  So don't go there famished.   I got the BM special ....pretty, and yummy and not weak at all. ***The Blue Martini Finlandia Vodka, Citronge, Blue Curacao, Sour Mix, Orange Juice, served in an oversized Snifter over Ice with a Glow Stick***** My friends ordered the cantaloupe, mango madness and caramel swirl.  All was good and pretty potent.  Ordered a few  bday shots.  It was nice there was a balcony you can go out and get some air and take a break for a minute.  Surprisingly the live band was great and not disappointing at all.  The one thing that was sad is since there was six of us....the table was small and we could not put the circle tables together cuz they were bolted to the floor.  (guess it was for safety reasons-lol) The servers were cute and barbie doll looking.  (at least ours was pretty hot and she was nice too.) They finally informed us the VIP had to go to the VIP's now ....it was ok...we were done allready and and even paid our bill allready. The bill was so reasonable since it was happy hour.  So make sure you take advantage of the happy hour---well worth it.  Went to the bar to get more shots and we didn't even have to wait long.  The bartenders actually made eye contact and smiled.   The parking kinda sucked since this was in a mall setting.  Hard when you have high heels on.  Then we saw there was valet but the person I was with did not want to take advantage of that. Overall....the experience was fun and the vibe was great.  We didn't want to drive around after that so we headed to YARDHOUSE in the same area---lol.  Read my review on that.",

Where it needs improvement is the service. Party of 3 went the other night and arrived at 7pm. Placed our first order within about 10 minutes of sitting down and that was the last chance we got to order for happy hour which ended at 8pm. We got our first round of drinks and food around 7:20 and we didnt see our server again until about 8:10!! Unacceptable. Even though the drinks, food, and band were good, if dont have the chance to order any of it, it doesnt do much good does it. Not the first time we have had subpar service and after this time I wont be going out of my way to make it over there. Its worth a try if youve never been, hopefully you get a good server, because everything else is good.",

Blue Martini satisfied our desires for decent drinks and some dancing.    I had a martini called the Skinny Bitch, which was decently strong, and sweetened with one of those artificial sweeteners -- Truvia.  I think it was billed as under 150 calories or something.  This was a good thing since I was coming off a buffet brunch and a delicious Japanese meal off the Strip.  The cover was free for ladies (this was a Saturday night), and $10 for guys.  OK.  The line was fairly short -- we waited about 10 minutes.  Lots of locals, so a lot less pretentious and crazy meat markety.  The dance floor is really small but a lot of people were gettin' down.  Good times.",

    "text": "This is gonna be a short review unfortunately.  On our way down to the Town Square for dinner we wanted a few drinks.  From speaking with fellow yelpers, I seen that there were lots of bars in the area to try.  On our way there the Taxi driver recommended Blue martini and i recalled it from being on the list.  Upon entering we were greeted and mentioned we were there for HH.  The girl told us to come on in and we found a spot to sit.  We sat there for about 5 minutes and nobody had any clue we were there for service.  Hey, No problem.....I jumped up and stood at the bar waiting to ask for a drink. And I waited....And I waited....And I waited...And I waited....Judging from the irritated look on my wife's face, she hadn't had anyone ask her if we had been helped either.  All in All, It was about 10-15 minutes with no help, my wife at the seat, me at the bar.  We couldn't even make eye contact with someone.  Im giving 2 stars because the place looked like it would've been really nice to enjoy a HH at.  Funny, how they post a special too.  SAVE %25 on your whole bill for yelp users by printing the page.  Perhaps I should start going into bars with a I YELP ASSHOLE!!!! T-shirt on.  Perhaps that would motivate a waitress to take your order.",

Its away from the strip and not really wantin to deal with long lines at the clubs in the casinos. Its usually jumpin on a friday/saturday nights. The Blue Martini Martini is what makes my friends come here. Drink two -three of those puppies you're set for the night.   The entertainment varies. Anywhere from coverbands to local music. There was one night where I wanted to jump from the balcony, the music was that bad (Didnt though, I ended up going to Stoneys).   I noticed a few faux pas about this place. They've been known to double book gigs at this location. Intentional? highly unlikely, unorganized? likely.   The decor is cool for the most part.  The service is par. We got our drinks shortly after our arrival. If its a busy night, screw it...Go to the bar!  I noticed that alot of people like to be the star on the dance floor. A small dance floor (yikes). But hey, if you're drunk and wanna make a fool of yourself on the stage.Knock yourself out. At least those who are attentive will be entertained.  Its ok. Parking is a pain though.",

Then later my friends came in and we were finally grab a table for 4 of us. And that's where it started getting worse.... Do they even know what \"service\" means? Tips by definition are product of the proper service (they're not requirement) - good service=good tip and bad service .... you guess no tip!  First we had to chase waitress around to order drinks. I started going towards bar stand but \"security-type\" guy stopped me and said that waitress will come to our table. 10-15 minutes later he ended up taking our drink order himself .... than we had to wait for another 15-20 minutes for drinks to get to our table.  Than we ordered some food and it took almost 40 minutes to get it (because for some reason 1st time it was delivered to another table!!!) .... bla bla bla and here we are ready to move on to next venue - not so easy because it took damn waitress another 30 minutes to get my check! Heck!!!! I can forgive anything but NOT WHEN I HAVE TO WAIT FOR MY CHECK! Come on people ... you want your money for your damn overpriced drinks do you?  So I have to confess - first time in all these years I stiffed and left zero tip. I could insult her of course and put few coins in but I was in a decent mood even after all this crap.  (Am I just bitching? May be I am ... but customer is always right, isn't he?)  P.S. While I was standing on the balcony I witnessed a nasty act of hit-and-run - b*tch was trying to turn around (turn, reverse and turn) and hit a car that was parallel parked right in front of BM. Too bad I didn't see plate number otherwise I'd definitely turn her in. Morale of the story - don't parallel park in a center of Town Square or you risk getting hit by some drunk f**k",

This is a classier place with a modern decor inside and out. It's also bigger then it lets on. The front door men are typical las vegas. Pay em a little and voila! No line wait for you! They have a hookah service at the outdoor bar. It's 30 Dollars an hour, though, we had it for longer. Also it's ten dollars after that. As for the specialty drinks, I am a huge fan of the BLUE Martini drink. For the ladies, try the Mango Martini.  There is a dance floor inside, a little small but so much fun.

I'm not lying when I'm saying it took them 1.5 hrs to get this rights, we sent the waitress back with the receipt four times.  Even Ashley had a hard time getting things through to the manager so he would correct the bill.  I was so upset at the end of the night that I left $0 tip which sucks for Ashley because she was an amazing waitress I just didn't want to leave any money to share with the incompetent staff.

It definitely has a chill vibe since we go there majority for live acoustic music. Haven't been disappointed with the entertainment but it's another thing when it comes to service.. We came in through the door, stood for a while near the entrance. No one seemed to have noticed we existed and we had employees of the company pass by us many times and still not recognize we needed to be seated. After a good 8 minutes we decided to look for a empty table for three and sat. A server then made time to come check up on us but did not take any orders. It's weird how the place is compact, so you find yourself sitting 5 feet away from the next table so I would assume it would be easier from customer to customer. I went up to the bar and ordered drinks from the bartender instead since our server really had no intentions of catering to our needs. They have cooling misters during the summer which is nice for a drink in this desert. We decided to have just that one drink and left. Maybe they were a bit busy, but it doesn't give you a reason not to let your customers know that at least they'll be checking on you shortly. I still contemplate on coming back here, but only for the live acoustic music.",

    "text": "We went this past weekend and I will NEVER go again.    There is one bathroom at the very back of the club that you have to fight your way thru the crowd to get to.    We were double charged for drinks, and our server took 45 minutes to finally settle our tab.    We paid over $700 for table service, but we were strong armed by the front door men when some of our party had to go in and out to settle their tab with valet.  And even though we paid such an outrageous price for 2 bottles of alcohol, our mixers were lukewarm and of very limited selection.  We even had to take the ice bucket back and forth to the bar because service was so poor.  And the music mix was just plain strange, the DJ wasnt quite sure which vibe he was sticking with for the night.  Add to that a very tiny dance area.   So if you like way over priced alcohol, poor service and being treated like a low-life, go for it.   This place was just as bad as any overpriced, crowded club on the strip.",

I think they're confused on what to call this place... a lounge, club or bar because it has all, which is cool, but the vibe is confusing.  Seating is hard to get & my 5 inch heels were busting my hooves, I had to pull a few strings to get a table.  The host tried to talk me into bottle service, are you kidding me???  It isn't a club!!   Bottle service?!?  haha, riiiiiiight!! The music was bad, not feelin' the mixes.  The parking sitch sucked.  Overall, it had great potential but I won't go back.  Bummer, because I love town square.",

Food is okay and the only thing I really like is the fruit and cheese platter. You can't really go wrong with cheese. Ohm nom nom!  If you're looking for a chill time, don't come later in the evening..as in 7pm and on. I prefer coming a little earlier as it's easy to get a place to sit and you don't wait too long getting your drinks/food. When it gets busy, it's hard to walk around, hard to find a place to sit, hard to get a drink etc. I guess I can't expect too much from a bar but it's frustrating. Atmosphere has changed over the years. I used to come here and see people in my age range but now its mostly 40+. No matter what your age, I wouldn't come here to meet somebody if I were you because there are TONS of creepsters hanging around, hitting on whoever, no matter their age. Gross. Also, after 8, they start checking ID's which isn't a big deal but at that time they also enforce a \"dress code.\" As a female, I've never run into any problems but I've had a guy friend denied because he wasn't wearing the right kind of shoes. Um, okay? Who's paying attention to anyone's shoes anyways?",

Then I advise I have one drink missing from my bill. I'm charged for the extra drink. Then I'm told they need my bill back to correct it. The bill comes back with the correct order 2 drinks and 1 appetizer. My card has been charged 3 times and cleared my bank. I've called management 2 days in a row and have left messages to discuss my bill to correct the charges. No one has attempted to call me back. FYI DON'T OPEN A TAB, DON'T USE A CARD, AND PAY FOR YOUR ITEMS WITH CASH IMMEDIATELY so you aren't charged for items several times. Now I remember why I stopped going to Blue.",

However, the 3-star rating is because A. there is not enough dancing room--though there is plenty of space in the venue but cocktail tables are all over and should be relocated to create an actual dance floor-- and B. I witnessed first-hand security or the front door man (whatever you want to call him) asking for an additional $10 on the side (for his personal pocket) to let someone in who \"violated dress code.\" Either you have a dress code that needs to be followed or you don't. Pick a side but stop hustling people at the door for more $$ just for them to come in anyway looking casual compared to the rest of the patrons. There were PLENTY of people in sneakers, white T-shirts and everything else that is \"not allowed.\"",

There just wasn't anything particular special about it that would make me want to come back.   As for the drinks, delicious! All martinis were half off for happy hour.

    "text": "Loved it here. I was in town for Thanksgiving and my 30th birthday. It was my first time in Vegas so for this night I wanted a place off the strip that was still entertaining and with more of an elevated dress code than Freemont street. This fit the bill (thanks to Yelp!) Drinks were good, dj was good. Each of the 3 areas had different music, mostly hip hop, some pop, and even some throwbacks.   I had to take 1 star away because the dress code said business casual..my boyfriend went with a hat on, not sure if he'd be able to wear it. At the door they informed him there were no hats that night. The security wouldn't let me put it in my purse, so He put it behind their door (we took an Uber there so nowhere to put it). When we got in, we counted 7 guys with hats on, and some with tennis shoes on. Upon asking the security about why he couldn't wear his hat, my boyfriend was told they didn't know why anyone had hats on, and that they must have been let in by management. If this is the case, management needs to enforce dress code across the board, not just for random people. The perception of WHY did not look good.  All in all a nice place to go off the strip (ladies were free all night), and my friends all enjoyed themselves with the exception of the hat issue.",

While I loved the caprese salad, I thought that the margarita flatbread was subpar and the chicken skewers were kind of dry. This could have been because they were super busy.   Another thing is that our waitress was very unfriendly and she didn't take our drink orders until we had been there for 45 minutes. I would say that is pretty dang slow. She also took about 20 minutes to bring me a glass of water. Most of the time I saw her just standing at the bar socializing. Let's just say, we were severely neglected.   I may return for the dirty martini's but I don't know if it's worth the wait.",

It's mostly outdoor but it was too cold to sit outside that night so we went inside instead. It was happy hour so drinks were half off and some of the food was discounted. We ordered the thai chicken skewers, cilantro chicken skewers and the beef and mushroom flat bread. Food came really fast and it was large portions. The three dishes were big enough to feed the three of us. I really liked the flatbread. There were generous amounts of mushroom and beef. Flavorful and my favorite dish. The sauce on the chicken skewers were really good but the chicken itself was pretty dry.   I think this is more of a drinking place than food place. Next time I'll come here to try the drinks.   I like the space, the portion size and the happier price. Food was decent but some better than others.",

That's how we also found out we had nooooo cell reception inside. So no phones and can't talk...blah!  Wait staff were walking around everywhere but not really helping anyone. We had to flag someone down twice for things we needed. Not my fav thing to have to do.   We ordered the shrimp and crab dip that comes with baked bread...it was very tasty. Had a little spice kick to it that was great. We also ordered the baked Brie. It comes in a nice and soft Phyllo pastry which we loved. The accessories to it were minimal and forgetful...a few grapes, a couple of cheap crackers and a few apple slices. Meh.   Our drinks were pretty good. The morning after was sweet and good and I had a cucumber martini with vodka. (I've had better) I finished with a mojito which was good.   I would only suggest going for the half price times, their regular prices are not worth the quality.",

    "text": "What an excellent experience at blue Martini!! I really felt that this was a place for the younger crowd but I 100% stand corrected. Yes their was lots of younger people there but was a great mix of young, mid aged, and older guest. Food and drink at great prices. What made this experience one of my best was the service. I think her name was Ana (she had red hair, and asian) best service hands down. She could have easily not told us about happy hour and taken advantage of our party and made the bill go high. She knew everything about the menus inside and out, helped us pair our drinks to what we were ordering food wise. Even got us to step out of our comfort zone and we all tried new drinks. My husband and his friends never had hookah before so she helped them with that. I wasn't the biggest fan (I don't smoke at all) but they LOVED it. Only because of her is why the very next day we came back. I will tell all my other friends to come to this place for great food, drinks and service and unbeatable prices. Thank you so much Ana (red hair) for your kindness to us. Anyone reading this ask for her if she's working!!",

    "text": "I came here to celebrate my grandmothers 70th birthday with my partner and family. The waitress who took my order failed to give me my credit card. My partner had to track her down to find my credit card and her response was, \"I gave it to you in the credit card sleeve.\" Which was False. The one employee that helped was MJ, who found my credit card at the front desk. How it ended up there, I have no idea,but the fact remains my card was lost and the waitress never attempted to look for it. I remained calm, asked for the manager. Alyssa, the manager, approached me in a defensive manner and stated: \" she gave you the credit card in the sleeve. She said she did and I believe her.\" Then she turned to partner and demanded that she step away since it wasn't her credit card. False again. She is on the credit card as well and my wife. At this point Alyssa had failed to apologize, accused me of lying, and rudely addressed my wife, mother in law and rest of family since we were all sitting at the same table. The experience for the rest of the night was sullied due to Alyssa failing to deliver customer service. Instead of enjoying a night out at Blue Martini I was upset that Alyssa had spoken to my wife the way she did. In the end Alyssa comped my meal but never apologized to my wife and that was the most frustrating part of the night. Two thumbs down Blue Martini. Advice to others keep track of your credit card here because it might end up lost.  Alissa, at the end I was tired of the situation, it could've been handled a lot better. Also, it was never ok but I remained calm that doesn't mean I was happy with the way you talked to my wife. Also, it never should've taken you 10 minutes of arguing and trying to separate me from my family to comp the meal!",

    "text": "It has taken me a long time to write this review. I started going to Blue Martini in 2007 and went pretty much every weekend until 2015. The last few years I stop in now and then but am not a fan of what it has become. With that being said I know that things and times change but I think that it has turned into a worse version of what it could have been. So yes, I am not a young woman, but I would say I am a mature, classy one. Dress codes don't bother me at all. It makes me very sad to come to Blue and see the changes which I will address in case anyone older than 40 might appreciate and feel the same way. You young ones may not since you don't know what it used to be.. Hint it wasn't a nightclub for young people.  BTW I have read through many reviews on here and they are spot on both the good and the bad.  1. Biggest problem for me...why oh why do you not let anyone sit at the bars.... Really? Okay I understand you want easy access.. but if you didn't let 1,000 youngsters in and you didn't turn it into a free for all club maybe people could sit there and meet others without having to get a table!!! Which leads me to....  2. RESERVED TABLES!! All of them?? Really? Stop it.. Bottle service only? What bottle? Vodka? I will be more than happy to pay for an exceptional bottle of wine or two to SIT somewhere which may. BE $100 or more..   3. So very RUDE  to offer no tables to anyone especially older people who have money by the way.. Unless they buy a bottle of alcohol. Maybe they want to eat and have good wine and martinis.   4. Asking people to move from the table because it is \"reserved\" and the people are here now.. come on... oh yes I forgot there is free seating in the back.. whatever lol! You are in the corner and can't see anything.   5. Positive! Good drinks/food and some great bartenders. Good music!!! Waitresses meh... they take too long.   Sorry I know they need to make money Scott M,  but for those of you who used to go back in the day that nice bar/restaurant with great music is a thing of the past.   Miss the old days. Too many kids/lines etc. If I wanted a nightclub I would go the casinos..",

    "text": "Blue Martini..... what in the HELL happened to this place? I remember when it first opened up and the spot was well put together! There wasn't a hookah lounge, they had good happy hour specials.... all and all it was a great place to be.   I stopped going here for a while since life things kind of got in the way, work, family, etc.. Well I made it to Blue Martini a couple of times in the past month or so now. I made it on a Thursday night (Neo Soul Night). This place was packed!! The hookah lounge was packed but not nearly as bad as the club/indoor spot.   The indoor spot was an absolute S*** show. WAY TO MANY people shoved in a little box with little room to move. They really need to set a limit on how many people they can have in both areas. Hookah was probably capped out but the club was insane. This leads to nothing but problems, which this placed seems to have constantly now.   The main issue is..... FIGHTING!!! There have been multiple fights because people are trying to get by the insane amount of people to either go to the bathroom or to try and get to the other side of the club. What happens then?? Well the person who is drunk and cant handle their liquor has to bump into another person who also can't handle their liquor, and POOF.... FIGHT ON!!!!!!  They really need to limit the MAX people getting in. If there isn't a limit, they need to make one and STAT!!   The specials still might be great and Blue Martini is still in Town Square which is a beautiful place to hang out. Town Square is getting a bit more \"Ghetto\" but Blue Martini is becoming the worst of the worst there.   **** Most Recent Trip ****  Went to YING YANG Twins, which played here (Friday night).... Holy Hell, what a freaking nightmare. Again, same issue. How in the world do you host rappers in a hookah lounge/extremely small club?? As you can imagine, it was another S*** show!!   I really need to pick a better day to go, but those times only work for me since I am working the other days. Oh well, looks like ill be waiting for some other company to buy this out and make it a more peaceful place to be.   I gave it two stars because its not the worst of the worst (YET) and the food is always halfway decent. The employees are always nice too. But Geez, get it together guys!!",

I arrived and was greeted by a beautiful young lady and a cool dude (ID check). I met some friends and found seats near the outdoor bar area.   This place is huge. Two indoor bar areas with a dance floor, but my fav spot was outside. Although a lil chilly out, they make up for it with space heaters spread throughout.  They have an awesome drink menu and the service is fast. Our waitress was very attentive, always checking on us to make sure we were good. We ordered appetizers to get us by, because it was a drink, stoggie, and relax night!  The flatbread pizza was delish and so was the artichoke dip.  All in all, we had a blast. I think I may have found my watering hole. Great atmosphere, not on the strip, and good views. Definitely give this place a try.",

The music was good. So much variety but in a good way of course.  I love this place. Atmosphere was fantastic. It was my last stop on my vacation before it was back to reality and work work work. Sunday was a fun day for me for sure and I must thank you Blue Martini for making it end with a bang!   This place is an all around winner. Great for big parties or just a fun girls night out!

During the day on an outside patio at Town Square in Las Vegas??  To be clear: these were nice shorts, not cutoffs or sportswear - with a smart button-down shirt.  I am generally in favor of dress codes for nice restaurants, and wish more places would institute and enforce them. But this one is seriously misguided.   We spent our money at Brio, where we could enjoy the beautiful weather al fresco, and where the staff was not noticeably offended by my knees.  UPDATE in response to Scott M.  It's not about being a \"fan\" of anything, and I'm not frustrated. I'm merely observing that you lost business because of the dress code. I've known nice nightclubs to have restrictive codes, and as I mentioned before, I generally approve of that. I guess Blue Martini is trying to position themselves as one of those. To me, you're a Strip-mall bar and grill with delusions of grandeur. If I'm looking for a \"nice night out\", I won't be looking at Town Square with its kiddie fountain and train rides.  Different strokes.",

I came with my company one nice dinner night out, had fun, live bands etc on a Friday night. I kept coming back to get that vibe back. the DJ in the past 3 weeks or more has been so bad in being relevant and catering to new audiences that it made me make this comment. Please if there's another DJ that can replace this man change it please. The table next to me right now didn't even finish their drink because the DJ sucked so bad...",

Probably not a good place to go if you are looking to have a conversation with your friends there. Go for the good times and the music, some people were just standing around dancing with the music.  Had a decent Appetizers and drinks selection, happy hour ends at 7pm.  We ordered the flat bread, cheese plates, and tuna tarte tart. The server was training another server, they checked on us often.",

Not the best I've ever had but by no means bad.  But they did have olives stuffed with blue cheese which in my opinion is a crucial ingredient for any dirty martini but surprisingly many bars don't have them.  We were really hungry so we ordered a few things to share.  The beef tenderloin was fantastic.  We also ordered a cheese plate which was good but honestly it didn't seem like there was much thought put into it.  There were a few pieces of cheese and some fruit thrown on the plate but we definitely expected a little more.  The crab cakes were just ok, wouldn't order them again.  We also ordered a Margherita flat bread which was amazing.  The service was great.  Waitress was always on the spot, we didn't wait more than a few seconds before she came to get our order.  She also brought more blue cheese olives for my martini without us even asking which was totally unexpected and a real credit to how great the service was.  Overall, I give it 4 stars but if we didn't have happy hour prices I would have given it 3.",

I have a cousin that lives in Vegas and he suggested we meet here for a drink.  I looked over the menu and a couple of items caught my eye, but we ended up just grabbing a couple Bud Lights ($7.00 ea).    Service was great. We sat outside near some heating lamps, which was awesome since there was a cold wind.  It wasn't until it was almost time to go that we noticed another area (straight ahead when you walk in, rather than to the right, where we were). It was a huge room with two more bars!  The place was pretty empty but I imagine it's very, very fun on the right night! Though, I'd probably bring a flask unless I hit up the long happy hour!",

They see a drink low, they come ask if you want more and they deliver fast!  They are a little overpriced and the drinks arent that strong, but thats usually the case for anyplace you go. They have an outdoor bar and an indoor bar.  If you are indoor, sometimes you are lucky enough to get to see live music!  They had a great band that played some awesome tunes.  The hookah is $30, I think that is a little over priced, I usually you only pay about $20.",

From RA in Luxor to The Beach by the convention center... from bottle service to hitting up 4 clubs in 1 night.  This was my 1st time at the Martini.  Overall I will give this place a solid 6. If I had to do it all over again, I might have decided otherwise due to the music but we did have a great time and service was great!  Hosts [9] - These guys know what they are doing. They hooked me up before I got there and they had everything moving seamlessly. They kept checking in with me but not over doing it. Service [7] - Nothing really spectacular here just good, fast service. Brought is OJ and cranberry when we needed it, she was hot, and she was on point. Even brought out our b-day cake from the back with plates & utensils. Atmosphere [6] - Pretty cool place except for the lay out. Seemed really long and narrow specially when walking by the big bar with the DJ. Too crowded with no crowd control in that area. Saw 2 fights near the bathroom area with no security around. huh? DJ [2] - Wow, really? A 2? Yes, a 2 and I used to mix back in the day. This guy blew chunks!  Couldn't mix bpm's, couldn't fade, and could NOT read the crowd to save his life. Went from hip hop to edm to rock in 3 songs! I don't mind him chugging 24 oz cans of bud light but can he please play something that put butts on the floor. Crowd [7] - Pretty good, mixed crowd. Different ages and ethnicities all over the map in this place.  Had some 50+ groups and some 21 yr old edm dancers that took over the dance floor to fake break dance. =)  Guess I'm getting old.",

    "text": "This review is long over due, but I came to the Blue Martini on the Saturday after Thanksgiving and would not recommend this place to ANYONE. My boyfriend and I were visiting Vegas to spend time with his family for the holiday. His mom and sister got to Blue Martini about 30/45 minutes before us to save a table (they had an event going on this night). Then my boyfriend, his aunt, and myself arrived and met them there. We ordered drinks, which were EXTREMELY overpriced, but we were enjoying our time until one of the workers randomly came up to our table and started to harass us. His first words were \"excuse me, but we just saw on the camera that you guys came in through the fire escape\" .. SERIOUSLY WTF? Who in their right mind just comes up to a group of CUSTOMERS accusing them of such bullshit when it was FREE to get in?! So then my boyfriends mom straight up told the guy that we didn't even all arrive together, and to let us enjoy our time. A couple minutes later, our waitress came back to the table, so we asked to speak to a manager. The manager came out, was VERY rude & unprofessional, and had the nerve to continue to accuse us of \"going up the fire escape\".. not to mention that it was FREE ADMISSION. He went on and said \" I saw in the tape someone you looked just like you (pointed to my bf's aunt & sister).. Why in the world would 4 women WEARING HEELS, try to enter a club through a fire escape in the first place?! He also continued to say \"a group of 5 people\" when referring to \"the tape\" when WE DID NOT ARRIVE TOGETHER. At this point, we all wanted to leave because there's absolutely no way anyone should be accused like that for something so stupid. Then my boyfriend told the manager he was going to talk to the bouncer at the FRONT DOOR who let us in, and he had asked him to tell this manager that he checked us in and we came in from the front. Once the bouncer told his manager that, he said the only thing he could do was apologize. Are you kidding me?! You're going to ruin 5 people's night, accuse them all of something they didn't do, make them want to leave, and the only thing you can do is apologize?! Could've offered free drinks or SOMETHING for the horrible experience. Worst customer service I probably have ever experienced at a club! I don't want to pull the race card, but I truly feel like that had something to do with it. I will never come back here or recommend to anyone.",

The drinks, as always, are ridiculously over priced as expected- Take shots, you're better off. But at least the music is good- Salsa, Reggaton, Bachata, Rock en Espanol, you name it- they got it- Latin style :D The only bummer is that their dance floor is TEENY-TINY! How are you supposed to get down Latin style with no room to spin around? No bueno.   They even have a live band- which is OK- I think they switch up the band every so often because I went once before and the band was awesome, so I guess it just depends. LADIES ARE FREE, and I believe it's $10 for local guys, $20 for other.   For their specialty drinks, you will spend around $9-$16, for shots I believe around $7-$12... I not a huge martini drinker but I always get the Raspberry Bikini Martini- Its OK :)   Overall, I think this place is an OK spot to hang out. I would rather much dance at a place with a larger dance floor but you gotta love the crowd and lovely people :b",

They are cautiously calculating what to say, because they got missile lock on you.   Wednesdays is Ladies Night, which is prime cougaring hunting grounds. And then there is Thursdays Latin Night, there is a small drop on the cougar population, but remember, travel in a pack to avoid getting pounced on.   They provide industry discounts for retail employees on The Strip, or restaurant employees with their health cards. 50% off all drinks and a few dishes. Show the bartender your wristband that you got from the hostess.   I recommend the PB & J Cocktail from this one guy that works here. He adds a bit of salt to bring out the flavor of the peanut butter. Thats probably the most unique drink I remembered seeing on the menu.   The drivers in the Town Square Parking Lot are terrible. They don't check their mirrors before backing up, or they will do turns that are too sharp that can clip your car, etc. And we are talking about hours right past 10PM. It's a rats nest of shitty drivers in this shopping area. I'd rather take my car to the valet.",

I give it three starts because there isn't much happening here anymore other than great outdoor seating and decent drink prices (compared to other places in town.) Music is A-okay, crowd is A-okay, atmosphere is upbeat no matter when you go. If you're in the gaming industry and have a Blue Martini card you get 50% off drinks. Can't complain, right?   Blue Martini, spice it up a bit!",

When we returned from the restroom one of the servers already cleaned our table and someone else was siting there. They offered to bring us new drinks but by that time I was ready to go already.  Horrible place , and I will never ever come back.",

I as well as the other ladies had the opportunity to sample a few of their delicious martinis. The most interesting martini I had was made jalapeno. IT WAS INTERESTING!  We also indulged in the appetizers, the shrimp crab dip was absolutely awesome. Then there was the hookah which was also very good. The lounge itself has a absolutely awesomely amazing good feel, especially if you sit outside. The staff was very attentive and always came around with water, which I must say was very needed. I would recommend and suggest this place.  Another huge plus is its off the strip, and is surrounded by retail stores and other places to eat as well as a play area for kids.  Its located in Town Square. It was just a lovely place, and the absolute best happy hour I have ever been too.",

Little side story: the girls and I wanted to hang out some more after dinner and thought to go to McFadden's but after entering there and standing around for 2 minutes, we decided that it wasn't for us. We ended up at Blue Martini instead and enjoyed ourselves more here!  I'm not sure if it's every Saturday night, but there was a live band playing that night and they were super talented and entertaining. We each ordered the Cake Pop Martini and it was yum in a glass. The glass was rimmed with sprinkles and icing and the drink itself was delish...strong but amazing! It was funny because the girls didn't know that the little shaker cup contained more of the drink!! We shared the big fat chocolate cake slice and that too was amaze.   Between the cake pop martini and the chocolate cake, I would say that it was the best idea for dessert after dinner. Add live music and great vibes and it was complete.   As far as the crowd and ambience--pretty chill and fun, but there were times that I thought that I was at Stoney's instead! The live band was awesome and when they took breaks, a DJ would play some music to keep the crowd entertained.  I did notice that they have different specials for each night of the week and I would love to come back and check out ladies night and happy hour.",

We legit stood at the main bar for 30 minutes maybe 40 waiting. Trying to get his attention. He kept interacting with a group assuming his friends/buddies and flirting with a girl. So he finally looked our way and got our order I'm like good finally. 5 minutes later we see him out of the bar serving area taking shots with the group of friends basically partying . I was seriously in shock. My 7 year old can take better directions and focus more. Another bartender finally comes in (looking annoyed since he was picking up the others one slack) and takes our order again and serves us within 3 minutes. Props to him for actually doing his job. Never had such a bad experience. Other than the sucky bartender the vibe and music was a great.",

I LOVE their happy hour deals, almost everything is half off - AWESOME for my wallet! :)  If you're looking to hang out at a local spot and get away from the strip - this is def a good option.  The live band can make it a positive, or not so positive experience..  I went on a good night because the band was awesome!  Their martinis are STRONG, and when you order one it's pretty much like getting 2 for 1 because they give you the little shaker to refill your drink!  Even better ;)  I went for ladies night (Wednesday) with a girlfriend  - and at 7pm this place was PACKED!  Seating is open, and after circling the place a few times we got lucky  to score a seat facing the band.   We had the crab cakes - two pieces which had chunks of crab; an almond joy martini (which was super heavy - sweet - and def tasted like a martini, it was STRONG!); and the tilapia which was OK.  The atmosphere is fun, and it's seriously great for people watching because people will get up and do almost anything (yes - even dance on the bar)!",

    "text": "Let me start on saying I didn't appreciate getting kicked out of this place because of how ur security or manager think I was too drunk to handle myself the way I looked that night. I flew all the way from Seattle to Vegas to celebrate my 40th bday. Thinking, this place will be a good place for me, my sisters, brother in laws n husband a place to enjoy n celebrate my bday. Well, let me tell u.. we were so disappointed n wrong. I couldn't believe how poor ur management n security handle situation when u had too much to drink. Yes, I admitted had drunk too much that I did actually vomited inside ladies restroom.   Not to the point, that I made a mess on the floor or did not make it to toilet. I managed to walked n did my business inside ladies room. I managed to clean n flush the toilet to make sure it was spottless.   As soon as I went back to r booth.. one of the security guard was talking to my brother in law n want us to leave because according to him.. I was too drunk to be there. At that time, I was just sitting n drinking my water observing n thinking.. what the hell is going on. We left r booth n waited for r parties on the waiting area to take care of r bill. Again, this security guard told us that we can't be there n have to leave the premises. That time, was already getting pissed off n heated up by the way they treated us. We got to this place @9pm n listened to the live band(sounded good by the way) enjoyed listening to them.  We took advantage of they'r 2hrs unlimited drink for price of$47 Ithink.  We ordered drinks n enjoyed drinking. That's the reason why we were there for, right. Well, if u guys r offering unlimited drinks in ur lounge expect that u will have drunk people. I had fly me to the moon, mai tai n rum n coke. Hmm, 3drinks within 2hrs was not WORTH IT!! that 3drinks for me was enough that I had too much already n had already gone to restrm. Well, after 2hrs they told us we can't stay in r booth  n we need to moved. But if we want to stay, we have to order drink to keep the booth.  Orderd a bottle of bombay n juice just to keep r booth. They suck u up to order so u can keep ur booth. Again, why did u guys kicked us out coz I had too much to drink n can't handle myself(according to them) but yet, u offered us to ord more drinks to keep r booth.  Not only we got kicked out @12:30 at night(still too early didn't even got a chance to dance on the dance floor).   I found out next day r bill was $800.00. What  the f***, how much again for party of 8. Come to find out they did 2 separate bill. First, 2hrs bill unlmted drinks so about $400 plus r food chips dips maybe $500 + gratuity of course there were 8 of us 15 or 20% of r total bill. Had another bill they chg after 2hrs+gratuity again of course. Oh, wait there is more another charge for the booth we reserved but did not tell us we have to move after 2hrstotally shocked at this lounge.. billed us twice gratuity that's 40% no wonder r billed was $800. We didn't even finished r drinks that was ordered after that 2hrs unlimited coz u kicked us out.   Now, u guys tell me if I was out of control that night.. as far as I know.. didn't say anything nor made a scene to get kicked out. The only time that I started dropping the f** word when I found out that we were getting kicked out coz of me. My only mistake was.. I had too much to drink n I threw up in the ladies room using the toilet bowl n did not made a mess. If I had too much too drink..then why the Hell do I remember all this.!! that's because,  I was not toxicated at all!! I think ur mgmt n security guard did so poorly judging me that I was belligerent n not able to contempt myself just because I threw up in the ladies rm.   Thx, blue martini for ruining my 40th bdy n made me think that ur night club will be an epic place to be. I was looking forward to celebrate n enjoyed myspecial day that night with my family but instead worst time of my life. A night that I will never forget..disappointed place to celebrate ur special day. Ur security guard looked at me like I was being belligerent n can't handle myself. Again, u can't judge a person just the way they look n act.   Understand, protocol n security of others is ur priority. But also need to realize ur lounge serving alcohol will not expect that customers will not get drunk. I felt humiliated getting escorted by ur security which until now.. still trying to find out WHAT I DID WRONG THAT NIGHT. Ur security need much training when to act or escort people out on how much they've drink. He judge me so poorly that I was not able to handle myself. I did not trash ur place, bother anyone nor I vomited in front of everyone.   Not my recommendation to celebrate special day coz they judge u on how u look if u had too much to drink. My 1st time getting kicked out on my 40th bdy n in Vegas.. Way to go Blue Martini... this should be negative zero star but not able to post my reviews if i don't click at least a star.",

Especially the fruit and cheese appetizer. However the second time I went (but it was earlier rather than later on)... the waitress was a bit annoying. I showed her my ID (because she didn't believe I was over 21) and she was staring at it as if it were fake and was going nuts looking to see the authenticity of my ID when the hologram of it being real was easy to see. She also took a while to give us the credit card back when we paid.  But I will say despite the second experience... I do like the place.  The band is amazing as well. At least the one that was there when I went. I actually almost started singing along to the songs and almost started dancing.",

If you sign up for the ladies' VIP card, you get a free drink every time you come to Blue Martini.   My favorites there are the Peach Pit and the Pomerita. The drinks are pretty strong (in my opinion) and they come with a refill in a shaker so its kind of like two drinks for the price of one. They also have an amazing spinach and artichoke dip, probably my favorite out of anywhere.   The service is usually pretty good as well. I could rave on and on about this place, go check it out!!  Another little tip- its especially fun when Empire Records performs there. They are a 90s cover band and they totally hype the place up!",

Awesome Happy Hour from 4pm- 8pm. I like to sit outside on the patio which is covered and has plenty of fans and monsters to keep you comfortable from The hot dessert sun. Choose from an awesome cocktail/martini menu and relax in a great laid back atmosphere and throw in some hookah.",

    "text": "Blue Martini is somewhere I go only if I am invited.  I went Wednesday night, and I was not surprised.  My friend and I walked in, and I showed the lady at the front my VIP card, and in we went... we walked in, and the place was PACKED. It's ladies night, what do we expect right? Well, we found a table right in the middle of the place and settled in.  We had to sit at two chairs right at the end of the table just so that we could hear over the band.  It was so loud we were yelling into each others ears!  We then proceeded to sit at said table for 15-20 minutes without even being acknowledged.  There were three different servers working this particular section, and not once did any of them stop at our table.  My friend proceeded to get up and go find a manager.  She was escorted back to the table, and told \"sorry, I'll find someone\" and never came back.  10 minutes later we were greeted by a server that not only informed us that her \"friends\" were on break, but that tonight was her very first night working there.  Let the eye rolling begin.  We checked in on Facebook, where it indicated that were entitled to a free martini.  Our server of course had no idea what we were talking about, and told us to go all the way back out the front to ask the girl at the hostess stand.  We went one at a time to get our tickets for fear of loosing our table.    We both ordered the \"blue\" martinis, and my friend ordered the pepper chicken.  The food was excellent.  The drinks were brought out rather quickly, and the night started to pick up.  After a while, as my friend was starting to not hold her liquor so well, I asked for the check. With our free drinks, we were only having to pay for food.  Well, the bill came, and the \"ladies night\" 50% off was no where to be found.  I asked another server who happened to walk by about it, and she apologized, and said she would take care of it.  After a few minutes, another server came back with the check, and very rudely told me that food is not 50% off, only drinks.  I advised I have been to this bar numerous times, and we always get 50% off of the entire bill. She basically proceeded to call me a liar, and walked away.  I tried to ask if maybe they changed their policy, and she didn't even hear me.  After I paid the $21 for 4 pieces of chicken and a chocolate cake, I grabbed my friend and went next door to Ranch House instead....",

    "text": "I come here a lot, about 8-12 times a year. So over the years I've experienced a lot of different types of service. I've been there for events, birthdays, New Years, or just casual nights. I definitely keep coming back because of the good food and great drink menu. Plus you can't beat the happy hour menu 4-8pm daily. Not just mon- fri. The service is always a hit and miss. I've had really great out going servers but I've also had crappy ones who couldn't give a dam. All the bus boys/barbacks are great tho, I swear they work harder then the servers. The staff is always changing, I think only twice I've had to he same server. I love the environment as well because you can either sit outside on the patio or inside. They always have great music. Every night is different so definitely check there social media to see what the theme is. Wednesday's are ladies night, Thursday's are Latin night, Friday's are live bands, Saturday's change from a special event or top 40's music/remix, and Sunday nights are Neosoul. Hookah is available outside as well, you can only smoke hookah inside after 10pm.   If you plan on getting a table for an event don't expect any great deal of service. I wanted to get a table for my birthday last year and getting a hold of someone was very difficult. You have to speak with James, but he's number always goes to Voicemail and never calls you back. I was very frustrated and didn't care for it anymore but then my boyfriend called and his phone call was returned right away and it was all set up in one day. My friend had the same issue, she had a hard time getting a table for an Event when Pitbull was going to be there. I don't know if he doesn't like doing business with women or what, but his attitude complete changes when he talks to a man. For that reason I never ordered a table again.   My latest concern was just last night, when my credit card and Id was misplaced and given to someone else. With all the fraud and identity out there anyone could of easily taken my cards. From now on I will never open a tab there again. I will simply pay as I go and keep my cards.",

Gracious and most efficient Graciela and Braxton present excellent people skills, professionalism and care, this makes them truly a phenomenal combination.  Our Bellinitini, The Brazilian, and The Espresso martinis were 5 star.  We dined on lobster salad, lemon-pepper chicken and our seared tuna with calamari salad are delicious.  We enjoyed baked brie for our appetizer- divine!!  Our night was complete with fine dining only matched by the superb attention to detail and vibrant staff named above. Kudos to Mr. Hernandez for making our experience outstanding, under his most professional direction, Blue Martini is a must stop for all in Vegas!",

It has bars everywhere, along with a dance floor and probably the best live band I've heard in awhile (Dancing Naked). The shared lead was this beautiful woman named Elise (sp?) whose voice was so amazing that it mesmerized! She was only filling in, but fortunately we found out she was in a Motown show at PH (V Theater) so we're headed over there to see her next!  As for THIS place, though, I couldn't find a single thing wrong with it. We had great seats, everyone, EVERYONE was having a great time. The drinks were delicious, they have high end liquor and make dazzling drinks and the waitstaff was incredibly quick, they had fabulous attitudes and made you feel like you were their best friends! I wanted to hang out with our waitress all night (I wish I could remember her name!).   If you want a moderate club-y feel with great, great music and really good drinks, try this place, it did NOT disappoint!",

I noticed their website said ladies drink free after 11pm if you check in with the hostess by 9pm. While my friends were hanging out next door I went over and spoke to the hostess about coming over later with my friends.  After I got back with them she hooked us up with a free cover and a wristband for free well drinks. The drinks were great, the bartenders were hot, and the dj was getting us in the groove. The dance floor was packed and that's a sign of an awesome dj.  Every drink I had was made exactly the same each time with no issues and never to strong or weak. We used two different bartenders and they were both on the same page. They were very friendly and outgoing. Never once we're they rude like others we've dealt with at other places. Our experience was awesome so we can't wait to go back.",

This must have bugged the server because once she \"cleared\" the table and check she never came back.  The table was cleaned by the bus boy in less than 5 minutes of us sitting down.  At 6:30 we ordered drinks from the bar... At 6:40 we tried to order food from the bar but they said they would send the server over.  She visited EVERY table but ours the entire time giving me side eye.  At 7 pm we left and went directly downstairs to Yardhouse to great service and food. I'd hate to know how much money this one server is costing the company with her attitude...",

It's my wife birthday so her and the girls decided to go to Blue Martini. Now Thursday is usually one of the best nights to go but tonight it was very empty. So my wife's group got a hookah and a lot of drinks and they sat down at one of the tables like we always do if we don't buy a bottle. The server Maria Paula comes over and tells them they have to move or buy the table. My wife informed the server that we frequently come here and all of the managers tell us if we have a hookah we can sit at the tables until they sell it. This particular server said no you need to move because wee need it if someone buys it. She was very rude. Now my wife's tells them its dead tonight...all the tables are empty..why cant we just sit here with all of our drinks and hookah and have a good time..the girls said normally we will let you but its labor day weekend and even thought there are no one buying table tonight so far you still have to move. the lead security guy Reich comes over and he was awesome he informed my wife that he would take car of them and found them another table. He was very nice and helpful, also the other server Stephanie and the hookah girl Shira were also awesome. I'm not much of a yelper unless something like this happens. We always come here and normally get table service and have an awesome experience. We always recommend Blue Martini to other people.",

Pretty sure the line was going slow on purpose by security to make people pay a cover because when i got near  the front of the line at about 9:50pm not only was everybody in front of me denied free entry but they were charging $20 for ladies and $40 for men for top 40 music and no special guest or occasion. This really made me lose respect for this \"local\" establishment especially Im no stranger to Neosoul Sundays and the fact that the usual cover is $10. Its ok though  they're obviously not good at business because they easily lost 50 customers  who weren't  stupid enough to pay that steep of a cover .",

    "text": "I'm not really sure how to classify Blue Martini. Depending on the time you go it can either be a restaurant, club, bar, or even a hookah lounge. Whatever you want to call it Blue has never delivered anything but a mediocre experience for me.  First off the drinks are very overpriced for what you get. Each martini is about $14, at this price point you are approaching what high end night clubs on the strip charge and this place is no Marquee.   However, what bothers me the most about Blue Martini is their half-assed attempt at being a 'club' at town square. On any weekend you will see a group of the sleaziest bouncers this town has to offer enforcing dress code and holding up the line for no reason. Once they make you pay cover and get in, you come to realize that place is full of people old enough to be your parents trying to dance to some no-name DJ playing songs off his ipod.  While Blue Martini is not a small venue, it is by no means comparable to any of the nightclubs it aspires to emulate. Low ceilings, cramped seating, and a tiny impromptu dance floor created by shoving dining tables and chairs off to the side. Personally, I prefer not to get down in some chain restaurant.   No matter how you look at it, you can have a better experience for the same price on the Strip. Unless you have a hook up for free drinks or a bottle, avoid this place like the plague.",

I had to stand up and put my coat on just to get his attention to bring us the check. We ended up going to eat elsewhere.   At fist, it seemed like the service would be great. However, as the night went on, it became clear he was more interested in chatting with his coworkers than actually tending the bar. Another couple sat down across the bad from us later and ordered three drinks each...that's either an indication that the service is always like this, or the couple needs a 12 step program. Either way...I don't think I'll be back.   I would give less stars, but to be honest, the drinks we did have were good enough for three.",

But despite the fact that Blue Martini is not my usual preference, I end up having a great time whenever I go.   The martinis are excellent, the food is good, and the patio has a really fun vibe.   The only downside is that they don't take reservations for dining. You can buy a table in the club area, but you can't reserve a patio spot for dinner. It's usually not a problem though, as long as someone in the group gets there early to scope out a table.",

Service - Servers always give you a hard time about splitting tabs. When you can get them to do so, it seems as though it's never correct and they have to re-do it a few times before getting it right.   Eats - They keep taking things off their menu that are good and not adding new items.   Drinks - Not as strong. Plus, you used to get enough for 2 drinks with 1 martini (one poured, one more from the shaker). Now you're lucky to get 1 from it. Just don't give me the shaker when it's basically empty.   You cannot beat their happy hour hours (4-8 pm, 7 days/week) so I still will end up here regardless.",

The food is halfway decent, prices pretty much in line with the Strip, and there is music and occasionally dancing (music varies between bands and DJs, depending on the night/time). I've had some good drinks, and I've had ones that were pretty gross, but overall I've been satisfied enough.   A lot of the surrounding bars/restaurants, such as Nu Sanctuary and Cadillac Ranch have closed down, so Blue Martini has become one of the few options at Town Square these days. As a result, it can get really crowded, and all seating is on a first come, first serve basis.  Happy Hour is a good option (all drinks 50% off), and the bartenders and waitresses are all good eye candy, so there's that, too.",

    "text": "What a train wreck!!!  We received a comped table and comped bottle for Thursday night. When the she came with the bottle she said it was an \"automatic $40 service charge\". I didn't mind paying for it, just wanted a bill for everything I was paying for. She told me that they don't ever give bills for comped tables. I refused to pay. She said she would get me a bill. She comes back almost an hour later with a REPRINTED receipt from a different group. Scammed for a tip once.   Left our table and went to get a hookah at the outside hookah area and the scams just continued. Our coal burnt out after 15 minutes and I asked for another coal or if she could adjust it. She said that it would be 1 coal per hookah all night. I looked at her and said we both know that's ridiculous. She then said \"if you tip me, I'll fix it\". Ended up tipping her $10 and had to continually ask her for refills and for her to fix the coal. Scammed for a tip twice.   My sister went to the car to go her sweater because it was cold. Didn't want to stay inside and partake in the Latin Night so we were outside. Not once did the bouncer tell us that he wasn't allowing re-entry as we waited for her by the door. Not once did he tell her that he wasn't allowing re-entry as he flirted with her when she was leaving to the car. But right as she came back he said \"no re-entry. You can tip me and I'll let you back in but $5 isn't gonna cut it!\" Wow. This was definitely a sign for us to leave.   Blue Martini must be doing really poorly for every single employee to have to scam people for tips all night long.",

My friends and I would be here every night we wanted to go out (if we weren't at the nightclubs on The Strip). Especially since they offered Hospitality cards - if you work in the \"Industry,\" you present this card, outside of Happy Hour, and you receive a wristband that provides you with an instant 50% discount on drinks and food. Fabulous. The martinis are fun and, for the most part, delicious. The food isn't bad either. Most nights, the music was decent and dancing in the area near the stage was fun. Now, the crowd has certainly changed (or maybe my friends and I have changed?) and it's just not our scene anymore. The problem is that I don't think it's much of anyone's \"scene\" either.   The service has been spotty as well. One stand-out experience that halted my visits for a long time, occurred on St. Patrick's Day in 2009. A particular bartender was unnecessarily rude and implied that I was going to leave the lounge without paying my bill by coming out from behing the bar and standing next to me the whole time we were paying. My friends and I were at the SAME table next to the bar for a couple hours and we didn't say or do anything that would have indicated anything! I have never been treated with such disrespect at any establishment as that day. I've been just a few times since then and it's been just okay. I'm not sure what makes all the employees think they're too good for their jobs and better than all their patrons, but it is beyond me.",

Me and my friend were sitting down by the hookah booth when a random guy decides to come to us and he was keep asking if we want to keep this table or move over which I reply to him by saying that I this our table and we want to stay here and not interested in talking to him ... so he was keep walking around us and keep intimidating us... after some little time he decides to sit at our table right next to us... when I told him he gotta move and I'm not allowing to sit at my table ... he moved the chair over and he start telling to his friends something about us and pointing to us ... which I already felt very insecure .. and was ready to call up security. After some time he came back and ask if we want vodka ?!! I said no thank you, we are not interested .. after all this he start touching the hookah we had and he said you guys need a refill , I said stop touching my hookah and be around us... when he reply IM THE OWNER .. walked away ... I called our server and explain the whole situation ... she reply that he was the owner of the hookah booth in blue martini. And I said he is keep intimidating us and being disrespectful to his costumers which she reply she have seen this and she is going to talk  to him.  This guy end up bringing me refill of hookah and after we were about to leave I decide to talk him about all situation. I told him that I'm sorry that I was rude and I didn't know who he was but I said it doesn't explain him why he was so pushy of scaring us off and getting us off the table . Which he said he is the OWNER AND THATS HIS TABLE. I reply...Im your costumer .. what do you mean your table .. im supporting your business by ordering hookah at least!!! once a month for 6 years  .  He reply THATS MY TABLE FOR 9 years... then it was a big argument back and forth with the owner of hookah booth  in blue martini. He never said he is sorry nor He was wrong he just keep being a complete assholes to his loyal costumers and stating it was his table and we took it over !!!! Never ever ever ever ever again I would smoke hookah from place  who doesn't value people who brings him business. I have to say goodbye !!!!",

We had 2 of the spinach dip & one of the guacamole dip. They call their guacamole \"tomato avocado salad\"... lol I found that interesting. The spinach dip was really good & I like that they use the blue tortilla chips. The guacamole had a little kick to it, which was nice. I do think that their chip to dip ratio is a little off. We got through half of the chips & we had no more dip. Lol. Also, they brought us the wrong thing & it took forever to get it changed. Nobody came to the table, we had to hunt down our server. For my drink, I got the white sangria & I didn't like that. Poor choice on my part lol.   On the plus side, they were bumpin some really good music!",

    "text": "Okay so this place deserves three stars because the drinks are good with good happy hour specials.  Try a mojito:). Also, another star because it's a beautiful spot with an open back patio perfect for a day time or night time chill out. Large indoor space and outdoor space.  Another star because the scene is cool, good music and themes based on the nights. Particularly the monday dance off nights (a lot of awesome talent) being super cool and Latino music nights.  Food: very limited selection with not so good choices. Come full. I've tried the cheese plate which is good and the ahi tuna which is okay. But you can get much better food elsewhere.  Hookah: quite horrible. So it's really odd how they have their hookah separate from the lounge itself. So no coal monitoring, not even Tongs to fix it yourself. No check ups on it really. And it burns out very quick for the price you pay.  The music: is way way way too loud. They need to leave it only on the inside and let it just lightly radiate outside. It's a lounge not a club. Kinda makes your head hurt.  Service is quite sucky too. Trying to get stuff at night when you have a table can take a long while. Day time is much better.  Cool to check out if you're looking for a dive-like scene.",

So flavorful.   Red wine: Apothic Red, my favorite blend. Not many places serve it.  Nice place to experience.  I visit every time I'm in Vegas.  A slight suggestion.  More heaters on the patio outside in December.  Even the waitresses are wearing ear muffs and gloves.",

    "text": "I used to go here all the time and had great times but after 1 year of not coming last night i went with a group of friends who wanted to spend money in drinks and maybe buy a few bottles and have a fun time , at the door this prototype of hostess with an ass face asian chick  demanding 5$ to get in ....... I understand 10 or 15$ but 5$ to get in a club ? I ask myself How slow can it be or how desperate can these employees be to collect 5$ from ppl that are literally going to tip more than what they asking at the door?? . To make a long story short I work industry and have spent more money in that place with my costumers than they can make in 1 year of work so I ask to speak to the manager( a little men in a suit comes ) I  ask what's up with the 5$ charge in the door is it a joke or is it real , he told me is a charge of 5$ to get in so I told him ok Im industry usually we don't get charged and specially 5$ he told me well can I see your industry card or something that says your industry  ( all this for 5$ )I told him bro I'm friends with your brother (one of the bartenders I appreciate and have brought my costumers to buy and tip very well amazing guy J Rey to me a great young men with a great attitude and smile ) he says to me I don't care your not special I told him bro i know Im not Chris brown obviously if I was I would not come to blue martini I just want common courtesy he kept insisting I needed to pay 5$ at the door  .than I had to ask him \" money is not a problem but how bad you guys need money that y'all charging 5 miserable dollars on a Wednesday night I just thought it was absurd and ridiculous that a place in Las Vegas needs 5$ ... so the guy kept insisting after I told him I had a group of 12 coming with me to spend a little more than 5$ he told me sorry but you need to pay your not special  so than I got so sad about them I threw 20$ for his ass face employee and I threw A 100$ to him cuz i just felt like they desperately needed money . Point of the story on a dead night like it was Wednesday ( last night ) for lack of common sense the manager lost 12 costumers  that he could have charged 5$ each and that wore ready to spend more than 500$ for 5$ he wanted to charge a local industry (me) who was bringing him money and ppl IDK who hires these type of no brained mediocre wana be managers but Blue martini you guys are not doing a good job . You lost some money tonight  do to a no common sense unprofessional manager ., By the way if the manager and hostess needs more money for rent or milk for there families I'll make a donation anytime for there personal use but don't be charging 5 miserable dollars cuz to a person like me is a joke to a local who is bringing you 12 ppl who are going to spend hundreds on your venue the company lost money . Now money is money so if blue martini don't care about 12 people spending money than that's fine but with a 5$ charge at the door I'm pretty sure they can't be loosing money or costumers like last night .",

We sat at a table that was not reserved and was told that we maybe asked to give up our table by a manager if a group wanted to buy our table. Eventhough I observed it was a busy night, I do not think that one paying customer should be treated differently. Ironically we witnessed a manager asking a group to give up their non-reserved table. The DJ was really good as well.",

    "text": "This is my second bad experience in a ROW here. I used to like coming here the first couple times me and my partner came for drinks and hookah but now TWICE have been disrespected by the waitresses and hookah girls. Both times we were seated and had to wait atleast 20 plus minutes to be helped or to even order anything. My last time coming was just last night at 12:50-1 we got there in time to enjoy a drink or two and a hookah. I again brought a guest to show this place to and was embarrassed the waitress did not look as if she even was serious about helping us, I watched her deliberately walk past several times and help the people next to us. We were waiting for our hookah to start our drinks or possibly a bottle (if anyone wanted to actually help us) that never happened we were told to wait 3 times and nothing happened each time the girl just walked away and would go dance and mess around with her other coworker. We sat around while literally EVERY customer had hookah around us while no one could even serve or take our order. Which is confusing because I could have sworn the girls were there working not partying but to my perspective they weren't doing a damn thing but dancing and ignoring us and the fact we were looked at and ignored or just told to wait  is BEYOND ME. Is this how the wait staff treats couples or is it a racial thing? I'm not sure. I was so disappointed I came here to celebrate my self for my birthday that I went home and bought a hookah so I could just do it myself! I probably won't be back here but I would save your time and if you have pay to get in I would save your money and go to actual strip. I gave this place three shots and it's just safe to say you may need a new wait staff! And to the man who replies to these post I am a LOCAL, I have been here multiple times on different times of year and every time your wait staff has an issue taking care of things properly I will be my letting my friends know I don't advise going unless you wanna fight a waitress because they all act too good to help people!",

    "text": "Had my going away party from work here last week and we sat on the patio for happy hour. Drinks and food were great but the service was terrible. No silverware or napkins were given when appetizers were brought out and we repeatedly had to ask. My biggest frustration came from the fact our waitress spilled drinks on me not once, but TWICE. To add insult to injury, she didn't apologize once. Both times were while she was clearing the table. The first time the drink spilled down my forearm and on to my lap. Luckily I was wearing dark colors, but she just looked at me and said \"Oh. Oops.\" I wasn't offered a napkin, towel, or anything to try and clean up. The second time was hours later, shortly before we left. This time she spilled the drink down my other side and I could feel it running down to my feet. I was understandably frustrated and said \"once wasn't enough?\" She started chuckling and said \"wow. I guess the drinks really like you. Can you tell it's my first night on the floor?\"  Very disappointed in the lack of service. I understand accidents happen, but when they do I expect a genuine apology. I really wish I had gotten her name because for the betterment of the establishment, she needs to be coached on how to handle this better. Not everyone will be as easy going about this as I was.",

But there prices always change at the door. I am not sure if it's depending on the mood they are in or how they determine the price. The host Friday was rude and charged me for 6 people when in actuality it was only  3 of us I still have my receipt. the bar close to the bathrooms had poor services not many people and the bartender took for ever to help us. So people watch out when you pay at the door they take advantage and up the prices as they please!!!!! Depending on what you look like!!!! this past Sunday my friend said she went and they charged her 20 and her boyfriend 40. that's crazy!!!! LOOK OUT GUYS SPECIALLY IF YOU ARE OUT OF TOWN!!!!",

On one hand, I fit in with the douchiness since I was wearing a v-neck linen shirt and True religion jeans. On the other hand, I don't have diamond studs in my ears or barbed wire tattoos around my entire body. And I'm really not into trampy platinum blonde whores with white stilettos, it's just a teeeeeeeny bit too much for me.  On the OTHER OTHER hand, there were some complete biscuits walking around this joint. Some of these girls looked like they stepped out of my dreams and into my reality. Obviously I didn't talk to them, though, because who can do that?  For four people, our bill came out to $170ish for 8 rounds of drinks. I think our waitress left some off on purpose to apologize for the crappy service in the beginning, but it was cheaper than I thought it would be. We smoked a lot of hookah, I highly recommend the watermelon-kiwi and the pina colada. Incredible blends!  All in all, three stars. It's like a club for locals, but still has the douchy flare of a place like Pure on a Saturday night.",

If you go here alone, you'll look like the creepy serial killer guy that hangs in the corner eyeing his next vic.    I went on a Friday night, after work with a bunch of co-workers.  It was very cool, casual, and fun.  The drinks were outrageously expensive ($19 for a peach martini?!?) but that was ok - since it was pay day.  If you go with a group, plan on getting there EARLY.  The benefits of that are that you can get some tables - which will be in short supply later on in the evening - and if you get there early enough there is no cover.  There was a band that played after 10pm - they were pretty cool.  The waitress was attentive, the drinks were strong (whoa on that Manhattan!), and the \"scenery\" was decent.  Hot men, but desperate cougars looking for a piece of ass.  Oh well, can't win 'em all.",

    "text": "Met some friends here for an after-work drink- or two.  Around 530PM on a Tuesday evening, the place was about half-full and started to get busier as the everning progressed.  Had no problem finding a table and ample seating in the outside patio area.  The martinis- included the Mango Madness (the go-to drink for my companions), the Red Apple (tasted like cran-apple more than anything), and the Cookies and Cream (sweet, but delicious, complete with oreo crumb rim).  All were good, strong, and tasty.  Pretty sure you can't go wrong with a 'tini with flavors you like.  These martinis are $12-14 a piece, but since it was happy hour (4-8PM), they were half off.  So at $7 a martini, still a bit spendy, but a nice treat.  And, yes, they do give you the mini shaker to ensure you get your entire beverage- just be sure to not let them take it before you've ensured it's empty.  The food-  with food half-off as well, we ordered the BBQ Chicken flatbread (tasty, but mostly bread- more cheese, chicken, sauce please), Spinach-Artichoke dip with Pita chips (pretty tasty), and the Bruschetta (basically chopped tomatos on toasted bread- nothing special).  All of these were regularly around $12 a piece, I believe ($6-ish with happy hour).  The service-  good, not great.  Our waitress actually came around a few times, but only when it seemed like she KNEW we wanted to order something.  Annoyingly, the other people working there would come by every 5 minutes to take our plates, drinks, etc., even when we obviously weren't finished.  We found ourselves consolidating a lot, just to give them something to take.  All-in-all, with HH the bill was $60 (before tip) for 6 martinis, 3 apps, and a coke.  Pretty decent for some quality beverages and nosh.",

Our server seemed to be overwhelmed with tables which made the service slow & bordering on annoying.  She kept asking if I was sure I wanted this drink or that or this drink or that drink.  Yes, I want a Manhattan!  That's what I am asking for & please give it to me now.  Thank you & please come again & yes, before my cocktail is empty.  I would go back when it might be slower than usual.   Oh & hospitality people, get a hospitality card.  A free drink every time you go.  Works for me...  The bathrroms are a trek.  Good god, they must want you to parade around the damn place & look at all the peeps there.    That's all I have to say about that.",

The waitstaff was pretty nice and the food was quite good.   Happy hour is from 5 to 8pm Monday through Friday with martinis at 1/2 price, house wine is 1/2 price... and all appetizers are 1/2 price. I think cocktails and beer are discounted too.  It's refreshing to be able to walk into a bar and not see a video poker machine. Unlike some of the other reviews where people were mingling with others... we kept to ourselves and had a great time.  The crowd was similar to who I'd expect to see at the Whiskey at Green Valley Ranch.  I don't know that I'd come here and pay full price for everything. That'd take some of the fun away for me. But it's in a great location and it's fun to go shopping afterwards at the neighboring stores when you have a little buzz.",

Other than the fact that they charge cover, Blue Martini has a nice vibe. Very nice inside. Small-ish dance floor, but the balcony outside has a LOT of room for people to stand around and talk. I didn't actually buy any drinks here, seeing as I pre-drank at Yardhouse. I'm going to try this place at happy hour and see what the experience is like.",

If my review was solely on him I would provide five stars!!! However, the wait staff particularly Cassandra who my husband nicknamed Cum-Sandra because she cared more about the tables that were flashing their male parts and their wallets than the tables who generally needed service. She never acknowledged everyone in our party and multiple times we had to chase her down to complete our order. Because she just darted off without verification of completion. She had asked for a credit card to hold our tab, which we were more than fine with but had the intent to pay cash. She charged my card, when asked for a void receipt she could not fulfill such request. I could continue to go on, but if you are looking for a GREAT VIP host than Jason is your guy. But be warned the wait staff is at minimal to a level of customer service that is expected.",

And the all-girl band!  Every song they played was on Natasha's Ipod.  How cool is that?  We ordered the tenderloin flatbread and the lobster tacos.  Both were delish.  I did think however that they were a little skimpy with the tenderloin on the flatbread.  Blue Martini is in a happening outdoor mall called Town Square.  Kinda what The Grove (in LA) wishes it could be.  It's a good distance south of the strip, but worth the drive.  We'll be going back, and probably make a night of it and go over to Pete's Duelling Pianos.",

It amazes me with the constant inconsistent service you would think that people would be sick of this place, but we aren't. It has been almost a year since I have been here,  I thought that things would be different and nothing has changed. So from my understanding  they have ladies night every Wednesday and they do a give away, but we got no tickets and them when I asked about it the bartender told me it was the customers responsibility to let them know that they need tickets,hmmm really?..How did I even know you were having a give away?..I will not say that I have always had bad service here but really in the last 2 years the service here has been subpar. I dont think their service matters to them. I am in the customer service industry and your customers are pretty much the most important part. My friend and I were not the only ones without tickets. I am sad that they are going downhill, we loved going here all the time. I suppose I will find a better place to go to in Summerlin! Thanks for regulating your sevice..not..",

Despite that fact that this venue is ALWAYS packed and there's rarely a place to sit (thus the 4-star rating instead of 5) Blue Martini is the perfect setting for someone who doesn't want the club scene, but isn't necessarily looking for a laid back lounge either.  It radiates with energy and style without the obnoxious meat-market factor.  Take a few girlfriends and order the Cherry Bomb martini - \"Three Olives\" Cherry Vodka, Red Bull Energy Drink and a dash of Grenadine.",

The crowd was annoying, and when we finally found somewhere to sit, it was hidden in the back. It was full of people trying too hard.  The second time... GOOD TIMES! Went on a friday during happy hour, around 6 o'clock, sat right at the bar. The crowd was more chill since it seemed to be more of the local \"hey I just got out of work lets get a half ff martini\" crowd. The bartender was nice, quick and friendly. My friend and I ended up sitting at the same spot til 11pm! It was alot of fun. If you're gonna go, go at happy hour from 4-8, drinks half off! And more laid back crowd.",

Luckily, I live close by and grab some nicer shoes and it met the bouncer's approval.  Unfortunately, he didn't mention the cover charge, which took me by surprise when the cashier told me to fork it over.  Even though it was $10 for locals, who ever heard of charging people to get into a bar?  Whatever.  I pay my way in and met up with the gang.  Service was slow, music was way too loud and for $8 for a domestic beer did not impress me.  Remember that policy about the business casual dress code?  Funny thing about that.  As I was out on the patio, I happen to spot a guy in shorts and tennis shoes wandering abouts.  Selective enforcement perhaps?  In short, it's over rated and overpriced!",

I'm wearing a $200 pair of Jordan's these aren't some beat down raggedy kicks so I went to my MERCEDES ( yeah I'm not broke but they treat you like that unless they know you or you buy bottle service haha ) and changed shoes but when I got inside I seen white guys wearing tennis shoes so I'm thinking really it's like that ????? But I'm not gonna let that ruin my night so we drank and danced it was cool plus they have a super huge nice patio with chairs heat lamps and hookah ! The waitresses were hot and the bartenders but the drinks were weak as hell and overpriced but that's Vegas unless you know where to go for locals. The female bartender sucked just because you're hot doesn't mean you should be a bartender !!!!!  I knew I was in for it when I asked her to put my ciroc in a bucket glass and she said \" what's a bucket glass ? \" I was like OMG you're a bartender and you don't know what a bucket glass is ..... really ????? So then I kept going back to the guy bartender who actually poured a decent drink and knew what a bucket glass is so he got my business and tips ! Make it sweet and short good time with friends but pricey drinks, rude security and dumb bartender but the guy bartender made up for it so maybe I'll go back but definitely not one of my top five ! It's to bad that the staff can ruin such a nice place with a great set up ! Oh btw do not run an open tab  with the waitresses !!!!! They ran my boys tab up over $400 and when we look at the receipt they had stuff on there that we never ordered obviously tryna increase sales and get a bigger tip !!!!! We were not happy to say the least but yes they'll take advantage of you thinking you're drunk and won't look over your tab !!!!!",

Great atmosphere outside on the deck, easy parking and a midweek lack of bazooka-sized slushy drinks, popped collars, completely oblivious gawking and oompa-loompa fake tans.  Just a nice, relaxing atmosphere. We had the lemon drop and standard Sapphire martinis, the Margherita flatbread, caprese salad and the beef tenderloin with the Vesuvius cake.  They were all very good and well presented. The one thing I would say about the place is it has a fairly limited menu.  There are about five pages of drinks and wines to two of food.  Not to be confused with a complaint though.  There were ample choices. As a pseudo/temporary-local, I will be back!",

I also love the location since Town Square is a fun place to go to with a very small town feel.  You don't find that very often in Las Vegas and I really appreciate the vibe of Town Square in general.  Blue Martini has a very happening atmosphere although it can be a bit loud; better to meet somebody new than to go with your current sweetie.  Even though it is always busy I tend to get awesome service and hardly ever have to wait before the bartender notices me and takes my order.",

    "text": "Blue Martini is definitely a place to go on a crowded Friday or Saturday night if you want to people-watch in a sort of meat-market atmosphere. Many of the women wear tight, short outfits and high heels. The guys dressed pretty decently. There was no cover charge the night we went, thank goodness, because even though the staff were friendly enough and the place was nice to look at, no way would my time there have been worth one.   The space is upstairs at one of those faux-village malls and it was PACKED, with loud Euro dance music that included a few recognizable remixed tunes. We found a spot outside where we sat at a table near a bar. The place is definitely visually interesting. I liked the different seating areas and the decor. I imagine that it gets very hot in the outdoor section, hence the ceiling fans everywhere.  I ordered a brioche while my friends ordered drinks and we kinda looked around at the people.  And looked around some more.  Then did some more looking... you get the picture. B o r e d o m.   I probably won't come again, but I think for the right crowd its the perfect evening out, as it is definitely popular.",

    "text": "Wow!  A lot of mixed reviews for this joint.  Let me tip the scale a lil...can we get more stars added just for Blue Martini?    The restaurant/lounge/bar is huge! They have both an indoor and outdoor bar with the indoor bar set up as a stage for the various bands that play there.  The waitresses are all haawwwwwt and wear bustiers.  Great eye candy for all!  The martinis range from $12 - $14, half off during happy hour. Happy hour is every day from 4:00 - 8:00.  Our mission that night- try one of each.... with 36 martinis on the menu....5 thirsty customers... being that i'm not so great with simple math....ummmm... that appears to be about 7 each!!!  Piece of cake!!!  The only catch is in addition to giving you your martini, the waitress hands you the shaker filled with over another martini glass worth.  How cool is that?  So, on that note, 7 martinis + 7 shakers = 14 each!!!!!  Sweeeeeeeeeeet!!!  I tried all of the following:   1. Mochaccino: Van Gogh Double Espresso Vodka, Starbuck's Coffee Liquor, Dark Creme de Cocoa and a splash of Cream, garnished with a Rock Candy Stir Stick  2. Cherry Bomb: Three Olives Cherry Vodka, Red Bull Energy Drink and a dash of Grenadine  3. Purple Passion: Finlandia Wild Berry Vodka, Chambord, Sour Mix and 7-Up  4. The Pomegranate: Absolute Ruby Red Vodka, Pama - Pomegranate Liquor, Citronge, splash of Cranberry and Soda  5. Cantaloupe: Idol Vodka, Marie Brizard Watermelon and Orange Juice  6. Mango Madness: Finlandia Mango Vodka, Mango Schnapps, a splash of Pineapple juice  7. Bellini: Ketel One Vodka, Peach Schnapps, House Champagne, and a splash of Orange juice  8. Caramel Swirl: Three Olives Vanilla Vodka, Butterscotch Schnapps, Amarula Cream Liqueur, Caramel Syrup, in a Caramel Swirled Martini Glass  Hhahahahhahahh... i counted up 8!!!  I knew i was bad at math!",

I've had a few of their martinis, Mango Madness is my favorite.  Atmosphere: DJ L1 is the buiz.  And on Thursdays they have a live band inside.  I think Thursday is Salsa night?  I wouldn't try to go for serious Salsa dancing though, that place gets packed!    I'm really picky about going out.  I'm not a fan of clusterf%$ks of people and I have to be in a certain mood to listen to House all night long; but if you say Blue Martini, I'm there.",

Thanks Jareed and the mixed girl bartender too.   I forgot her name... boo...she's a total sweetheart.  I would definitely hang out here again.

I think I can finish 2 orders of this. There were two big lobster tails, some mangoes and avocado with citrus dressing.  Shrimp and Crab Dip - a must try dish. Shrimp and crab in a mayo-cheese sauce with a hint of spice served with toasts. Really yummy.  Lamb Chops - this was not part of the happy hour. I believe it was about $18. It was mediocre. Not something I'll try again.  Lemon Chicken Skewers - another so so dish. Nothing special.   Eggplant Caprese - this is another good dish. It came with some tomatoes, mozzarella and olives.  Baked Brie - I love this dish too. It was served with crackers and fruits, drizzled with honey.   Seared Ahi Tuna Salad- another yummy dish to try. It's a generous portion.   Margherita Flat Bread - I've tasted something better.  Mushroom Flat Bread - same as Margherita Flat Bread... So so  Beef Tenderloin Medallions - good one.   Definitely a good place to hang out... Good ambiance and great food.   We will be back!",

Sometimes its hard to get a place to sit on busy nights, but there are plenty of places to talk and take a break from the dance floor. I love the DJ and live performers on Sundays.  One con: I called a few days in advance to ask about cover charge for Sunday nights for women (I had friends visiting from out of town and I was trying to get and idea of how much they should bring for cover for all of the places), and I was told is would be free before 10pm and $5 for all ladies (locals or not) after 10pm. We got there around 12am, and cover was $10. Not expensive, but when I asked the lady at the front desk about it she just said \"I'm not sure why you were told that, it must have been for a different time.\" There wasn't a special event any it wasn't a holiday weekend, so I'm not sure if they just change their prices depending on how many people are there.",

You can't get great tasting food in this town for two people with drinks for that price.  We sat at the bar last night and the service at the bar FAR exceeds the service you get when sitting anywhere else outside.  I talked to one of the Bartender's who said he came from Florida and he said the owners are very selective about the market they open up in and how things are designed and ran, this explains why there's only one in this town right now.  What it does not explain is the lack of training given to the young servers they hire to take care of everyone else who is not sitting at the bar.  Every time I have been here and we have not sat at the bar, the service made the experience horrible to the point of why return?  It would be great if the owners or management would take the time to read these reviews.  I guess when you have a place with a 7 day a week happy hour and the place is always packed, those few hick ups just don't matter much to you.",

It is HUGE and has a great atmosphere but the food and drinks were just okay and we had to practically beg for service. Our waitress must have apologized to us 5 times throughout our 3 happy hour appetizers and 2 rounds of martinis. They seemed completely understaffed...  I did like the fact that my Nevada resident female friend received a free drink with her valid ID.  Again, 3 stars.",

I waited a day to receive a confirmation, called the restaurant yet again and the representative took my name, phone number, email and # of ppl for my reservation. The rep said a 3rd party was handling the reservation and I should be receiving a confirmation in some form....Still no confirmation email or phone call.  Really Blue Martini!!!!!  If you care about your business you should reconsider who manages your existing and future customer's experiences as there are several other options in the area which we will now be exploring.",

But this time was horrible, we had a server (Rosa), she was spending more time to danse with her coworker and flurt with an other employee  instead of spend time to serve the guest. For the first drink we waited 20mins after that we decided to go to the bar to have our drink ,kylie was really eficient and serve us right a way. I hope the manager team will see this review and talk to the employee to improve the service. The blue martini is a really good place to have fun with friends but it doesn't deserve to have employees like Rosa.",

You would think after you purchase 3 bottles you would get service and since this place was just on the news for roaches at the outside bar, they would try to have better customer service to make up for that. But nope! I even wanted to spend more money there by also buying drinks at the bar. Again - waitress was very rude no smile and seemed overwhelmed when it wasn't even busy. You would think that due to them being dead slow they would appreciate the business. Nope. I'm a local and they have just lost my business. It needs to go back to 2014 era when they played better  music and appreciated money spent.",

Located on the 2nd floor. They have a live band that rocked it out. 50% drinks and apps happy hour from 5-8pm. If you work for a hotel, casino, bar, restaurant u can pick up the industry card which gives u the same 50% prices after 8pm. Signing up is as easy as just showing ur employee ID and waiting a few seconds. Prices are still a little pricey with the discount but you are still saving something. Nicely designed decorations. VIP area with their owe bartender. Balcony area overlooking Town Square.  Very friendly bartenders and hostess. The Blue Martini drink wasn't that bad, a bit to fruity or sweet for me but still good. 007 martini was also ok.  It's really hard to hold conversations inside because of the band. To the right of the entrance is a less crowded and better area to hang out, with their own bar area.",

But when in a place with an alcoholic name, one must order a drink. I ordered the Mango Mojito, and enjoyed it!  It was served in an over-sized snifter; and, surprisingly, I actually finished the whole thing.  From what I remembered, I don't think I tasted any mint (hence, MOJITO). That was ok because it was sweet enough for me not to taste the alcohol but still get a buzz that would last me until I got to the airport.",

    "text": "My friends and I love this place. Great for a Saturday night when you don't feel like going to a club. Wednesday nights are really packed too because it's ladies night (all the guys show up) but the other nights are much slower (boring).   Ladies can get a free VIP card on Wednesday nights which entitles them to a FREE Van Gogh vodka martini or cocktail EVERY TIME THEY COME TO THE BAR. Just show your VIP card and ID at the door and they will give you a coupon. They have 8 million martinis to pick from which are all excellent. The Pomegranate and the Palm Beacher are my favorites. They recently added quite a few new ones too. If you go during happy hour, which 4-8 every day, drinks and food are half price. This puts the martinis at $6-7. If you are lucky enough to score an industry card you get half off all the time. Tons of people have them who are not really in the industry, so figure out a way to get one. You should never have to pay full price here. Note: they don't have Corona. Sad face.   Lots of times if you're sitting at a table your service will suck, so just go to the bar and order your drink there. The food is pretty good for a bar but I wouldn't advise going there for dinner or make the food the reason you're there.   The lives bands are good, but I really wish they would just stop all that and only have the DJ. If you sit inside you can't hear what anyone is saying over the loud band music. They usually do covers. I think the DJ usually comes around 11. There is a dance floor but seems like the only people who use it are there for a bachelorette party or else it's old people who somehow stumbled to Town Square from the strip.   The bathroom is very nice and the attendant is always cool. Parking kind of sucks because you're at Town Square so you can't get a close spot, but there is always valet. Blue has a nice outdoor patio. Bottle service is good if you have a group and we have tons of bday parties here.   Dress nice folks, this isn't the Cadillac Ranch. Plus how are you going to attract a mate if you look like a slug? Girls do come here in hopes of meeting guys, so feel free to buy us drinks. It's open till 4, which is fantastic.",

Ok it was lady's night.    it went from 0 to unmovable between 630pm -700pm.  Luckily we were there at 6pm and had a table.   What I did like:   The bartender rocked it.  Made me the best Bloody Mary I've had in Vegas..he even indulged me and put cucumbers in it so it was like a gazpacho with vodka.  YUM.    My Euro friends were fascinated with the diversity of the crowd.    after an hour of shouting at each other we gave it, and our much sought after table, up.

This has happened on numerous occasions and the last time the server girl smirked as though I should be able to handle my alcohol. Firstly, I'm not an alcoholic and frankly even they would have trouble stomaching the drink I was served. Secondly, I have lived in 5 continents and bartended in 4 so I think I know how to make a cocktail. The last few times I have been the service has been slow and not very personable from any staff member.

Happy hour prices should not interfere with how the bartenders make the drinks. I felt it was a rip off. Especially since I had attended a function several months later at the Marriott hotel, and the Blue Martini was there advertising and giving out free \"mini\" martinis to try and promote themselves. Well one of their \"mini\" martinis gave me a buzz.  One thing I don't appreciate is False advertising.  I don't drink alcohol very much.  But when I do order a martini, I expect alcohol.  I hate it when I hear of bartenders watering down drinks.  Bar tabs can be pricey, so why not give the people what they are paying for.   As much as I did enjoy the atmosphere, I think I will pass on the Blue Martini. Bu bye.",

I've been here three times to really make up my mind and each time I ask for \"well\" drinks the bartenders end up pouring me Grey Goose or Van Gogh and then when the check comes they pretend that that's what they heard me say. Last time all I had was two double vodka soda \"well\" drinks and got a bill for 45 bucks cos the bartender poured Chopin. It's a really dumb scam and I've fought it each time. Just be on the lookout for it.",

    "text": "Looking for an \"off the strip\" place to hang out at? I'd make this an option. The drinks are way less expensive than the strip, the service is good. Call in if you have a big group because you might save more with a $100 bottle service.   The band, most of the time hits the note. I wish they would  bring back the band that plays mostly 90's songs...   It's close to the strip - but far enough to be a local spot.   The first year this was open, it was great because I could connect with my 20's and 30's crowd. But for some reason, the geriatrics found the place. And all I see are cougars and dirty old men. Shame on me - but shame on them too.   It's halfway a bar, lounge and well, don't call it a club. Their security acts like it is though. Anyways - don't come here alone lest be prayed upon by your moms and dads friends looking for young blood to hook up with.   Dont get me wrong, if you're coming with a group - you'll have fun.   The selection of martinis are as good as the selection of beer that Yard House has below and the selection of license plates that The Cadillac Ranch has next door - with that being said: If you don't like the crowd here, go to Yard House or Cadillac Ranch.",

I ordered the bbq chicken flatbread and it was hard, cold, and dry.  It might be because it was late night dining and not during the day, but based on my experience, definitely don't come here for the food. Just take advantage of the drink specials, especially the mango mojito!",

However, they try to be sneaky about selling bottles for $150 and pouring well vodka in it.   Our table had put in a request that all our bottle be brought to the table sealed and opened there! First bottle service was fine. Second bottle however our server brought over a bottle with no seal so we had to ask for another. Third bottle is where WE ALL THOUGHT IT WAS RIDICULOUS. Our server brings the our third bottle to the table and we noticed it had no top or seal. Then one of our guys tried pouring a drink and there was absolutely nothing in it! Ok so then we called the server back and told her about it and again asked for a sealed bottle to be opened at the table. (She told my bf that it was sealed and she opened it there and that I didn't see her open it!) She then said she'll be right back with another one. (mind you we are sitting right across from the bar) so we watched her go back to the bar and tell the bartender what happened and he pulls out another bottle from under the bar and gives it to her and she walks past our table to the other side of the bar and hands it over to another bartender/bar back. From what we see, she's over there dancing while he's doing something else to our bottle and hen she brings the bottle back with a pourer on it. We all look at each other puzzled and ask her what is that? She replies with \"a pourer\"! We ask her to take the bottle back and bring us a sealed bottle please! She finally brought us a sealed bottle and apologized for what happened and then we partied the night away but, we were still uneasy about the whole situation! We had a fun night even though that happened! We still love Blue Martini and that's not going to stop us from going back!   The next morning we still couldn't believe that happened and just wanted to give everyone a heads up! It's not the first time it's happened to us. There's other bars out there that also does the same thing! Make sure you get for what you pay for!",

Anyways.. this place was paaaacked. Couldn't even find a place to sit at the bar. Wandered around.. nothing really interesting. Got a free sample shot of vodka from some waitresses walking around. There was a live cover band playing, which was cool. Finally found a table, sat, drank some more, ordered some spinach dip (which was really good, btw), and just kinda people watched. I'd say the crowd was more mid-20s - mid 30s.. a little older than us early 20ers.  Probably would've been more fun if we had gone with more people. Overall, nice place.",

    "text": "Went here last night with a huge group of coworkers. The drinks and food were priced right at happy hour, I wouldn't pay full though. Our main complaint was we never got a server. Ever. We asked FOUR different people for one. As it was we each individually went up to the bar and ordered food, waited for it and returned to our table. Definitely put a cramp in our hanging out together. We got a hookah for the table and the hookah girl was around every ten minutes, which is really sad that she was so attentive and we couldn't order a drink to save our life.   We had bussers (?) come around trying to take plates and glasses...and trying to grab them when we weren't anywhere near done.   Oh and the bar lost my credit card twice, I had to go find the actual bartender I handed it to and ask for it back.   So I give a good rating for the food and drinks, but the service was Horrendous. Awful.   But high five to the hookah girl, she rocked my socks.  Edit: I returned last night with my sister and her boyfriend. The bartender was so nice and accommodating I'm upping my review a star. Also, someone came by and lit our fire without us even asking which was cool. The bartenders name was Conitra. Even though she was busy she gave me great service every time I went and I was impressed with how well she handled the busy bar.",

There are about 40 choices ranges from light refreshing pear to creamy dessert type almond joy  I had a mango mojito on my last visit. Soooo syrupy sweet I couldn't even drink it.  I asked the bartender for some lime juice to try to balance it out and he holds up a bottle of roses?!?!? How can you serve mojitos, margaritas, and 40 types of martinis and not carry lime juice??? weird.  Always busy.  Great, upbeat vibe.  Little to no dance floor space.  Don't bother eating here.  The food is not good.  Everything is mediocre at best.    If you are looking for an upbeat, drama free night out, head on over.  If you are looking for a lovely three martini afternoon on a patio overlooking the park...this is your place.",

The band was playing Rock 'N Roll, but not so loud that you couldn't have a conversation in the outdoor bar. I loved the decor and ambiance of the facility.

Every day from 4PM-8PM you can come here and indulge in some of the best cocktails and martinis! I could almost kick myself for not coming to try this place out a lot sooner! Anytime I've been here in the past it was more on the nightclub scene! If you find yourself in the area you most definitely have to try this place out! I've been here now twice and I can suggest that the crab cakes, crab/shrimp dip, spinach and artichoke dip, teriyaki chicken and bbq flatbreads will not disappoint! As far as the best martinis I'd say the southern belle or southern charm, starburst and pomegranate martinis are all worth trying! The customer service is extremely friendly and all the girls working are very pleasant! If you are a hookah person they do offer hookah as well.",

I've never been to Blue Martini, and didn't know there was a dress code - I was wearing sandals, solely for comfort. When telling my friend \"Hey, I didn't know there was a dress code\", a girl nearby told me I looked fine. We waited a bit and had a couple of the bouncers walking back and forth \"see me\" along with everyone else in line, prior to entering. When it was time to check ID, the bouncer looks at my feet and says, \"Dude... we don't do sandals...\" in the most derogatory and degrading tone. Before I could even open my mouth, he says, \"But if you give me $50, I'll let you in.\" I ended up leaving, and heading home. I was livid, because if there was a dress code, why is there any room for negotiation? Why didn't any of the bouncers say anything while I waited in line? Why would I consider paying $50 for entrance on a Thursday night at a location that isn't even on the strip as a local? Granted - I genuinely wasn't in dress code, but the whole experience was overall humiliating in front of my friends/coworkers I haven't seen in the longest. I'll head downstairs to YardHouse next time.",

It was all very good except I wasn't a fan of the pita bread/chips. Brandon the manager kept checking up on us to make sure everything was great and we did ask him about the pita bread... some were HARD and some were half way soft and hard - which were they suppose to be??! He said they are suppose to be hard, like a pita CHIP. Either way, the consistency in the pita was INCONSISTENT so maybe they should rethink that but the dip itself was delish and we also just used the crust from our flatbread to dip anyway!  I tried a Peach and a Mango martini and they were both delicious!",

    "text": "So it's a bar with a decent happy hour (4-8) half priced drinks and reduced food costs, and that's about all the positive things this review will have.  Service was not very good. We waited about 25 minutes before even having someone take an order then they missed the appetizer we ordered. In general, it was hard to get service and more than a few times we had to request things like drinks and such multiple times.  Our appetizer, the Caprese salad seemed like someone had heard of it and decide to make one but never actually tried a real Caprese salad. The salad greens were mixed greens, a horrible choice, that was clearly made to reduce costs to make it easier to use those same greens for other salads. The mozzarella wasn't that good and way too little balsamic vinegar.  The food we ordered, lamb and an ahi tuna dish, was not all that impressive either. The lamb we ordered medium rare, we were served a medium well lamb that wasn't seasoned very well along with some pretty basic and simple potatoes and peas. The seared ahi tuna dish, was fine, but that's about all it had going for it. The sauces provided could and should have been much more aggressive in their flavors. Again all this felt like someone had read somewhere how to make these dishes but never actually experienced what they should be.  The drinks were meh. I had a bourbon and coke and it was fine. The Mango Tango was actually a decent drink. The signature Blue Martini was ok if all you care about is a lot of alcohol anything else and just avoid it. It's not a particularly pleasing combination of flavors and I have no idea why it would be the main advertised drink.  I can't recommend this place in any way. It wasn't awful, but really nothing about it was worth even half of what we paid.",

It's nice and open, in a great lit mall and the drinks are strong. I got a Jack and Coke and it was just enough alcohol for me to dance until the club ended. Also bottle service isn't expensive and it's worth it, so that you can sit on the balcony and enjoy it with hookah.",

    "text": "'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;  That was pretty much the reaction of all the people that happened to drop in last night (Tuesday around 10pm) at Blue Martini. The music was still blasting out of the speakers, the bouncer is still checking IDs, but there was at most 20 people including the staff inside.  That is just cra-cra from a business operations perspective.  Not sure what happened to this place.  But even in the middle of the week on \"industry nights\" Blue Martini was a pretty happening place a few years ago.  I am not a regular but from the pictures shared on FB and other social media, it was a fantastic place to hangout with friends and meet new ones.  But now, we walk in after celebrating a coworker's birthday downstairs at another restaurant and the place was like, reserved for VIPs that have yet to arrive.  It felt like walking into that habitually closed and then opened briefly under new management strip club on W. Sahara. The place is big, but how can you stay open when the staff to patrons ratio is almost 1:3 (and I am counting the hostess and bouncer at the front and the bathroom attendant(s).  Anyway, I hope they do better on other more busy nights. Because even with the discounted appetizers and drink specials, without a happening crowd to fill all the squared footage that Blue Martini occupies, they will soon go the way of the prior neighbor Cadillac Ranch.  2 stars partly for nostalgia, their flat breads and the still eye catching outfits of female bartenders.",

When Christina came back she asked how we were doing and cleared our table and got us more drinks. She is an asset to this place. The servers need to take a page from her book on how she runs her section. She is awesome. Thank you Christina for the great service and making us feel welcome :)",

    "text": "This lounge/bar/restaurant/club is a one of a kind gem in Town Square. The space is upstairs, with a large patio creating an indoor/outdoor bar experience for their first bar. There is an even larger indoor space with two bars that is distinctly separate from the outdoor bar area.   I was worried it would be an uptight, pretentious \"martini bar\" and was so happy to find it to be exactly the opposite. They have so much more than just standard martinis, play top 40 music, and have several TVs for sports.   Their happy hour is fantastic! It runs later than most and offers real special pricing on all food and drinks. Wednesday night is ladies night and all ladies get half off drinks all night; local ladies- for even more perks, join their Lady Blue program for a free drink EVERY NIGHT! (After 8pm)   I wish they had a better system to integrate their two spaces as open seating policy results in the outside bar constantly being packed but the inside room generally remains an isolated ghost town people traverse to get to the restrooms.",

Came here on a Sunday night and the DJ was playing all the greatest hits and the drinks were tasty. They were also quite pricey, which lost them a point. Like, I get it's Vegas, but your'e off the strip. SO paying $15 for Sangria isn't really what I was into at that moment.   The crowd is urban and the music doesn't stop. I would recommend this place to chill and have a good time dancing with your friends.",

As I was walking away he started to speak disrespectfully to my friend telling her to leave after saying goodbye to me.

Music was so so that night, but still, everyone enjoyed the atmosphere and company of others. I had been corresponding with Leah for months on the planning of the party and she made sure I was satisfied from start to finish. Food was hot and delish (we had mini cheeseburger and crab cakes), drinks we on point and just the ambiance of folks having a good time was worth us coming all the way from Texas. I have no regrets for picking Blue Martini. I thank you guys so much for helping us celebrate 6 years of wonderful wedded bliss!!",

Blue Martini is also one of my old stomping grounds... MANY a fun and crazy nights happened here, and I love it even more for this reason!  We sat outside underneath the sprayers, so we could smoke hookah. Oh! Hookah is a new addition since the last time I was there. $30 for the first bowl, and $10 for the refills. The good thing is that they use Starbuzz shisha; Starbuzz is the best brand of shisha to use for hookahs. We had the lemon mint (something breeze), and it was of course, perfect, since i have it at home. We had 2 bowls. between the 3 of us.  Happy hour has also changed; it is now from 4-7, 40% off food/drinks. It used to be 4-8 :( Well, just means you have to drink more in a shorter amount of time! not a problem! Haha.  I had the lemon drop martinis; they were delicious. My obba had a Stella and some other beer on tap. The hookah made the night perfect, and our server was also fantastic. I cannot wait to return so we can have more fun here. I hope they never close!!",

Get my heart pumping Blue Martini! Don't break it like a narcissistic lover that I'm done with but return to. The DJ's here are the very worst and yet this venue is where every local friend of mine chooses to visit. It's what my kind knows and here I go having to say, \"No Becky and Josie! We gotta find another venue to dance at. One where the DJ knows what they are doing!\" And then they all agreed.  This place has an amazing atmosphere, wonderful vibe....don't get it twisted.....hookah area that smells lovely and is so chill you wanna stop and breathe it in but you gotta up that constant beat because no....I don't wanna stop dancing!

Food was more of a platter type of offering but the cheese plate was a great order.  Cheese was fresh and fruit included was sliced and fresh, not just out of a can that I expected.  Venue is huge and if you come early and get a table it isn't too loud.  Live music is constantly playing and inside and outdoor option make it great for night in Town Square.  I recommend it highly for a Happy Hour spot and to continue on from there.",

The DJ is always playing good old school music that will either cause you to dance, sing a long or both.  The drinks are good and contain a little sexy flair to them.  The food is okay.  I think, in order for you to receive the best deal, you should come during happy hour.  After which, the prices are little expensive for what you get.  The service is good.  Overall, I would say that you should try this place out when in town.",

When we got there, the girl at the door asked for our ID, and was scanning it, but appeared like she was having problem, while also on the phone. She said because our drivers license were from out of State, and felt different, she called her manager over to take a look at our drivers license, who took them and was gone for like ten minutes or so, while we stood there waiting. He came back with some excuse about how their computer won't take our license and when we asked why won't the computer take it? We are from Minnesota, so why won't your computer take an out of State ID, when he reports that they accept them??.....If you coming from out of State, just stay away from this place, or if you are a person of color period. They are not welcoming at all! STAY AWAY!",

And if you happen to have your server be shona you're in for a treat !she is amazing.",

    "text": "3.0 Stars  Location Overview: This bar/club can be found at Town Square upstairs cross from the AMC movie theater. This place is spacious and a very chill environment. Even when it gets crazy packed, the environment does not get overwhelming. The music variety is great for dancing - not overly loud, can still carry on conversation.   Customer Service: The customer service was fantastic. Waitresses were very attentive even when people were coming out of the woodwork. The only complaint I have is the hookah bar, I had to have our waitress and even a manaher check on our hookah about 8-10x before it finally came out. The hookah girl was slacking big time.   Quality/Quantity: The quality of the drinks, food and hookah was good. The quantity was lacking though. Even getting here way before it got packed, the bar did not have several different beers and I had to settle for stuff I do not drink.  Side Notes: Great for large parties, good bar scene with a little club mix.",

    "text": "The food and martinis were excellent on happy hour.  DJ was fun and entertaining.  But beware of what is done with your credit card and watch charges if you go to this establishment.  We were vacationing in Las Vegas and this place was recommended by a local.  The waitress insisted we give our credit card for happy hour when we wanted to pay cash.  They said we could settle with cash at the end.  We were ready to leave around 11:00 p.m. on April 28th 2019 and I had to hunt down the cocktail server to get my credit card back.  It took some time for her to come back with it and now I know why.  We settled with cash and then left.  This week went into my Visa online statement to look at it and pay my bill and I see I was charged for $34.50 from a company named Hookah Hot Spots.  I figured it was a charge from the Blue Martini because there were people all around us smoking the Hookah.  I have Asthma so that was another reason we decided to leave because it was too smoky with that, cigarettes and cigars.  Anyway called the Blue Martini yesterday and I was told the Hookah Hot Spot was a separate company and my Visa must have been handed off by our waitress to the Hookah waitress hence the reason it took so long to get my card back.  Blue Martini wouldn't help me with the charge but gave me number to reach owner of Hookah Hot Spots.  I'm supposed to get a refund in 2 or 3 days so we shall see.",

Whether it's dead empty or slammed full, the cocktail servers seem oblivious.  My friend and I went specifically for food on a random night and were asked to pay the $15 cover. Fine...We sit down and wait.....and wait.......annnnnd wait. Even after flagging down a waitress, she tells us someone else will be coming soon to take our order. Still nothing. Everybody who works there acts like they have something better to do for some reason. We go to leave and ask the host at the front desk to refund our cover charge. The guy tells us no because we have no receipt. Of course we weren't given a receipt for the cash cover. Guy wants to go back & forth about it, but we're still starving, so $30 down the drain takes us right downstairs to Double Helix instead. At least they have good cigars, whiskey & grub with an attentive staff.  Probably won't be back unless I'm already too drunk to realize where I am.",

Me and My friends waited in line for a hour to get in and when we finally got to the front the guy working the door told my male friend he could not get in because he was wearing a camo shirt ( A very nice camo button up). We always check the dress code and nowhere does it say  that men can't wear camo. The man said only women can wear camo. Which makes no sense. Then the guy came  back over to us and says \" If yall slide me a tip I will speak to my manager and let you in\". What kind of mess is that either camo is allowed or not! I will never step foot in Blue Martini again.   Update : Scott, you're missing the point how come if we would have given the bouncer a TIP then we can wear camo ? It's either it's allowed or it's not. And we called before we arrived and on your automated system for dress code it does not mention camo. I shouldn't have to ready other ppls reviews to find out the dress code. Just ridiculous !",

    "text": "Positively the best Happy Hour in Las Vegas and one of the best I know of.  It runs every day, even weekends, from 4pm to 7pm.  Apparently they just changed it from 8pm to ending at 7pm on a Sunday, as there were some upset customers who came in around 7:30 expecting 50% off martini drinks and food.    The quality is excellent, I ordered the Maine Lobster Salad for $8 and the beef tenderloin sliders, 3 for $9.  They have about 20+ items on the menu, all at half price for Happy Hour which is an amazing deal and well worth the visit.  The salad was fresh and the lobster cooked very good although a little too salty for my taste. It had a good variety, with avocado, mango, tomatoes, and lettuce.  Plus it was a regular sized salad portion.  The sliders too were really good and a fantastic value at $9.  They were tender and filling.  Drinks and their specialty martinis are also all half off which is an amazing deal. Would order again although there is a lot more on the menu I'm interested in trying.  Parking can be a little difficult, and finding the place if you're not familiar with the town center shopping center can be a little confusing.  It's on the 2nd floor by the AMC Theater.  Or look for the Coffebean and the stairs is directly across the street, listen for the music.  Highly worth a visit especially Happy Hour.",

Walking-in we sat down and were promptly greeted by our server who took our drink order and offered a food menu. We didn't order food, only drinks during our stay. The drinks came quickly and were decently strong. Nothing really mind blowing, but what did semi-explode my mind was the size of this place.   We sat on the outdoor patio, which by the way is huge and wraps around the entire restaurant. There's also a separate bar for the patio, which is probably why our drinks came out so quick. There's also two other bar stations inside the venue; as well as a dance floor, dining room area towards the back, and what seemed like private room for party rentals.   There was a little bit of sticker shock when the bill the came, but we did enjoy multiple shots, cocktails, and Hookah.   Did I have fun? Yes.

    "text": "Definitely, one of my first choices to drink in the district. Thursday night is latin night and is always a blast. I really like their lady VIP card that gets you your first drink free. You can use this card during happy hour and get some nice appetizers too. As a local, it is really nice to be able to go out and have a nice time and not spend $20 on every drink. I love the Martinis. My two favorite martinis are Starburst and the Dirty with Blue cheese olives. They play live music sometimes on the patio and it is very nice ambiance. This place always has beautiful girls and good looking guys too so if you are looking for a date this may be a good place too. I will be back.",

The atmosphere is always amazing and the music is always great. Working in customer service for 11 years, I pay huge attention to service every where I go. The waitresses are always super awesome especially one in particular. Erika was our waitress for my friends bday celebration. With her bubbly and vivacious personality, she cheered up my best friend who had just broken up with her man earlier that day. Erika made her get out of her funk and actually enjoy herself. She was kind, fun and very attentive. Because of her, my friends want to continue coming to Blue Martini. I def recommend this place!",

The DJ would only play a song for no more than 15 seconds. By the time anyone got to the dance floor to dangle to a good song, the Dj would change it up. There were a few times when hip hop or r&b would play and the next song was a rock or alternative song. Don't get me wrong I like that music too but it was such a drastic change when you were trying to dance.",

Me my friends came down to Vegas to surprise our friend who just move here, and we ddnt wanna go to like a club, but still have a good time, and have to worry about lines!!! Our bartender was awesome, never waited long, was very friendly and I even asked what drink the couple down from me was drinking and he gave me a sample! Such a sweet guy!!! Defintely coming back when we're in town!! Good Music, has a dancing area if you wanna dance, and a hookah bar as well!! Price starting at $30 which wasn't bad, too sad they ddnt have any available at the time so we ddnt get to try it out!! And also alcoholic price was very reasonable!! A well drink vodka tonic my go to drinks was only $8!! Cheaper that going to clubs on the strips!!",

She charged more for the same drink (Corona Grenadine) than girls working other Bars inside Blue Martini. What pissed me off though was when she took my order, I paid with a $20 bill and she returned 15 minutes later asking \"do you guys want another round\" I simply told her \"I want my change\". She returned 5 minutes later with $1.35, when I told her I gave her a $20 she pretended like she did not know what the fuck I was talking about. I asked to speak with her manager and she came back 5 minutes later saying the manager \"was busy\" but I can have a free beer. I'm not mad over $10 dollars but the principal of this stupid bitch trying to steal from me when I work hard for my money. Anyway, the manager (white dude) was a douche but he did return the rest of the change.   Moral of the story... be careful and keep track of your money because these pretty waitresses will try to steal from you in a heartbeat.",

We started with the spinach dip and a BBQ flatbread. Both were excellent. We followed that with the crab dip and seared Ahi as shared dishes. Each very tasty. Excellent appetizers.  The big drawback to the Blue Martini is getting a table outside during happy hour. We got there and every table was taken. I spotted someone getting up from the table on the other side of the Terrace and rushed over. Got there the same time as a guy 20 years younger than me who had forearms the size of my calf. I decided it would be best to let him have that table. My wife spotted a table where someone was about to pay the bill. We stood by for a few minutes and did manage to get that table without conflict.  Once you get seated, it's really a nice place to spend the happy hour. However I'm not really sure it's worth the hassle to get a table.",

They have a small dance floor where you're literally elbow to elbow with people. I don't like strangers sweat on me, let alone touching skin.. I love their balcony, it's easy access if you need a break from dancing to catch some fresh air. Hookah is available, seating is limited and it was easy to get a table on a Friday night for my birthday. My favorite drink, of course, has to be the 'Blue Martini'. Overall, this place isn't that bad, just be prepared to party with 21-50 years olds.",

I've had the cookies n creamtini, peartini, & appletini, and they were worth their weight in gold.  The venue puts our regular deals through <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgroupon.com&s=dddd6d4a067849d455557df3f740429e9a4df76571dab2a2356ac944fa74372c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">groupon.com</a> and <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Flivingsocial.com&s=2456932cd5ebcc60ad30944e723e56ffdb2706564dcfac90fbf2e821a2c1c821\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">livingsocial.com</a>, so you should keep an eye out for them if your wanting to try the place out for the first time.  Wednesday nights are ladies night, and Friday & Saturday nights turn into a night club. They start off with a band playing then a DJ takes over to finish the night off  **Make sure to get there before 11pm on the weekends as that's when  they start to charge a $20pp cover fee  The place is inside TownSquare located in the back of the center and in front of the Rave movie theater upstairs, so park in the back lot.  They also have happy hour everyday from 4-8, which is also a nice added bonus. I recommend the lobster salad and the cheese/fruit place for sharing.",

They have a stage which has live music on the weekends (Not sure about during the week).    Drinks:  AWESOME DRINKS!  I love their selection, it makes me want to try everything.  My favorite is the Bazillion, lychee and melon.  For you non vegans, they have candy bar drinks which look good, but more like a milkshake for my taste.  The price isn't too bad, especially if you end up here during happy hour.    Love this place, my only complaint is it gets crowded, so if you have a larger party you want to come ahead of time, or have someone come stake out seats..it gets packed fast.  Go BLUE MARTINI!",

I think they go for the happy hour specials but this review was for getting in around 11pm on a Wednesday night.  I was told that it was ladies night but I guess a bunch of guys got the same memo so the sausage to taco ratio was skewed toward the sausages.  On top of that, the drinks were pretty weak for what they charge - $9 for Stoli and a mixer and you can barely tell there is alcohol in your drink.  My friends were paying $12 or $13 for martinis but I guess they give you a little more since they give you the shaker to take with you and pour the rest when you're ready.  Would I come back?  Maybe...  I think I'll have to show up for happy hour since it seems like that's when they have the best deals but I wonder if they will charge a cover just to get into happy hour??",

They also alternate with a live band that plays latin rock and also the good old 80's rock. Overall the atmosphere of the place is very young, energetic and lively. The food, although I only tried the artichoke dip, was ok/good. But the drinks...that's what you go to Blue Martini for. Large selection of specialty drinks including the infamous blue martini. I recommend you try at least two different ones they're all pretty good. Would recommend and come back. If you work in the casino industry you'll get 50% off after 10pm.",

Here are the pros: Decent selection of drinks Live music Outdoor area Huge sports bar inside  Cons: Price of drinks Service can be a bit slow even when there's multiple people working Airport noise  This isn't really the place you would want to come to hold down a conversation (pretty loud) but it's a nice place to come enjoy a breeze and a cocktail.  It is a good alternative down Las Vegas Blvd. and off the strip. If you're coming from the strip, GPS shows it's 3 miles or so but be prepared to either take sidestreets or commute for half an hour. Just a heads up in case you have a reservation!",

Also you did accuse us of lying by stating that you believe your server returned it and you supposedly looked this up on the camera to prove this to us. You also were extremely rude and short with myself, by raising your voice, stepping back and placing your hand in my face, you should never disrespect a customer when your establishment misplaced, lost, whatever you want to call it our card. Also the card was found with no help from the server who lost it  or yourself. You should stop making this worse, don't respond to this review you were wrong, was a terrible experience, end of story.",

All of these things were accomplished that night at Blue Martini.  We arrived at 7pm to partake in the HH specials. We ordered 2 blue martinis each, crab cakes, and flatbread. The drinks and food came out in a timely manner. We were able to small talk with the servers before it got too busy and loud. The food was hot, fresh, and tasty. Those drinks are strong and did their job.  A cover band entertained the crowd for most of the evening. In between sets  a DJ played some modern tunes.  Even after it got busy the waitresses were very friendly and attentive. They cleared our table and made sure we had plenty of water to drink.  I enjoyed the mixed crowd of people. It didn't have the club feel of creepy people trying to pick up on unsuspecting dancers.  The bathroom was monitored by an attendant so it was always clean which can be a big deal when a lot of ladies have been drinking and dancing all night. My friend and I are already making plans to go back for some more fun at Blue Martini.",

I keep coming back for many reasons, everything from the food (love the cheese and fruit platter) to the music, vibe and the service. It's also a great place to network and meet people. The patio area is great during the spring and fall but can get a little too hot during the summer and a little too cold during the winter. During those times I mostly stay inside the lounge. Whichever bar their bartender Chris is at is where you'll find me! He is the best bartender ever!! He always welcomes me with a smile, he has great energy and he's really good about making my drink in a timely manner even when they are slammed! He's one of the reasons I'm now a regular here. He serves so many people every single day and yet when I come in he knows exactly what I'm going to order without me having to tell him, which I love! He interacts with everyone at his bar and keeps the energy up all night. Whenever you go to Blue Martini ask for Chris and tell him Laura Dee sent you, I promise you you will love him!!!",

The first time I came was summer two years ago and it had a nice day time vibe, even with misters in the outdoor patio which helped keep me cool. When I came this time around last weekend it was a good time as usual. My friend who is a local who loves this place always gets hookah in the blue mist flavor which is pretty good. I went this past Halloween weekend and there was a $10/cover which isn't bad on the day of. For Halloween they had an MC and a Halloween costume contest which added for some entertainment and music was from DJ Nova. They have a small dance floor, hookah outside, and hookah can be brought inside only with bottle service only starting at $150 which includes mixers with Kettle One Vodka. A crown royal whiskey sour costs $13 and is in the smallest glass. A long island has the taller glass and is $15. The drinks are your typical price point. Overall the service is pretty good and this is a great option for those looking for something different besides the club scene.",

We said yes we'll take it. Then we were told we had to buy two bottles to get the table. I was like okay why? They said because the bottles are really small. OmG they were really tiny probably enough for 3 drinks we could not believe it, Later we hear from a guy in the suit that he can get us a vodka bottle for $256 I said great what bottle? He said I don't know I think it's new and blah blah blah. He was just trying to up Sale shit to us. And of course all open tables had the stupid \"reserve\" signs on them. purchasing a bottle shouldn't be so hard we just wanted to know what the hell we were getting.

Not to mention, my friend is a bartender at the Hard Rock Hotel, so we got 30% off on top of that!   3 drinks= $20. Down.   Overall, the drinks were alright I'm not a martini type gal, but it got me through the night. In other words..it got me drunk lol.  4 drinks, and I was on a good level.   The live music was awesome! The band was great, and they were playing all the current hits, and all the old school hits..I loved it!  The crowd was very mixed. A mixture between old men and young gals.... :x   Overall, it's an alright place. Probably not a place I would take my friends to though.  Oh yeah, and I got a drink spilled allll over me here. Cool beans.. -_-",

If you like top shelf martinis and want to pay under $10 per drink, the Blue Martini is a MUST VISIT during happy hour. I came here with my girlfriend after work for happy hour and we were VERY pleasantly surprised by the service, by the pricing, and by the drinks. I had three martinis and each one was GREAT. (And rather large for the price.) I like my vodka martinis extremely dirty, and very often bartenders tend to \"under dirty\" my martini even though I order it \"extremely\" dirty. However, the bartender who mixed my martini hit the dirty level spot on.   For appetizers, we ordered the crab dip plate and the baked brie plate. Both were really good. If you're a fan of seafood, definitely give the crab dip a try. It is a little spicy, but just right.   My girlfriend ordered an Almond Joy martini, and while I'm not a fan of sweet drinks, I definitely thought that the martini was really good for a dessert drink.   One of the pluses here is the speed of service. Our waitress was super nice and tended to us just the right amount. She wasn't a helicopter waitress, but she wasn't an absent parent either.   This is fantastic happy hour spot, and I definitely recommend you coming and trying this place out.",

But having to get classy and listen to crappy music that you can hardly dance to, sucks!  I do give the place 3 stars for the super cool menu of martini options, their food options are all tasty, service is rather quick, and because they have an outdoor patio area that is nice to hang out in; complete w/ a bar and everything.  I wish they played better music though.  Since they have 2 areas for music, they should switch it up and tailor to everyone's likes.  Not everyone likes house, trance, hipster, and high energy.  Some people like to hear some top 40 and hip hop.  Play some!  The music inside gives me a headache, especially since the big speakers are right on the dancefloor!  Yelp Challenge!

I was there a few Saturdays ago around 11 pm and got in line, which wasn't too long.  But I was surprised with the cover charge they now imposed!  Sure, I was free (either b/c I'm a local and/or b/c I'm a girl), but the Husband was charged half off b/c he is a local...which meant he still had to pay $10.  Now, this is where I felt really bad because I had referred some out-of-town people here and I would have felt like crap knowing they paid a $20 cover charge to get in!   It was still busy in there, but definitely not as packed as before.  They are getting cheap on the drinks though.  My Mango Madness ($14) shaker used to fill the martini glass two rounds, but this time it just filled the one.  Bummer.  And the Husband's Jack and Coke costs $8, and there wasn't much in there.   Overall, definitely not the place to be anymore...and the neighboring restaurants have since closed down too!",

The bartenders always make great mocktails, and I actually start having more fun and dance more the more I have. I like that Latin Nights the best. On Weds it is a great place to go if you want to just have a girls night. This place is small enough to just enjoy the people watching and where it's not too loud or crowded where you feel pressured to have a drink just to make it through. We have been to other lounges and clubs, and when you tell them you just want a water or something non alcoholic they don't give you the best vibe. But BM is not that way and we are just comfortable there. If I feel like the crowd is getting too out of hand and people are not capable of handling their liquor I just say it's time for us to go. It is meat market though so ladies be prepared for the guys to try all night! Even if you are with someone they still try! :/ They also have an industry happy hour and always accommodating if you just want to eat as well.  Some of the crowd are like 50 year olds with grandchildren trying to relive their youth, it's entertaining nonetheless watching !",

Went to the bar and were told a server would be over. That never happened. Then tried the outdoor bar where I stood for about 5 minutes and was never acknowledged.  Not even a \"we will be right with you\". Nothing, I walked away and decided I'm not giving this establishment my money. Waited for my friends to finish their drinks and left immediately.

The drinks, the food and the service was all excellent.  If you and your crew (we had like 25 people) want to do this place in style - get a VIP room. We had a blast and it was the perfect end to a wonderful trip to Vegas.   The food we ordered - Lemon Pepper Chicken Skewers, Baked Ziti, Margarita Flatbread Pizza, Caesar Salad were all very good.  The Dessert Skewers are the shining star!  I would do this again in a heartbeat.   The evening band was excellent and even sang me Happy Birthday - this was not arranged - just happened out on the dance floor (which is small, but still fun). The DJ is spinning the latest pop music and was what you'd expect.

It does have a really great patio but sometimes can be very hard to get a seat. The waitstaff is hit & miss. Some days you can get a great server that's happy & friendly, most days, they seem more put out and frustrated. The food servers are great, always get your food out fast & clean your table quick. If the food & drinks were a little cheaper during happy hour I'd give them another star. Tip: Wednesday nights are probably the best night \"Ladies Night\" and usually a great band.",

As locals me and my friends come here often spending over hundreds of dollars in drinks hookah etc....every single time we come. Typically there's no cover to get in early in the say and on certain nights, they do have a sign that says Thursday to Sunday there's a cover charge after 10. Now I came here on a WEDNESDAY at 930 and the women at the door says I need to pay a cover charge or buy a $25 bucket of beer. First off Wednesdays are suppose to be ladies night because I've been there plenty of times after 10 with NO cover and half off drinks all night. Second I don't drink beer so I don't want that I wouldn't have spent well over $100  on just hard drinks alone and that's without food or hookah. So you're telling me u rather me pay $25 for a bucket of shit i dont want or the door cover that is not typically charged at the time I came, over spending the hundreds I typically do????? And where on the sign does it say Wednesday??? Or before 10pm???? Of  course I'm gonna buy drinks! Plenty of them, I don't come to a BAR just to look at people. This is completely disappointing. I won't be going there anymore because being in customer service for a very long time you typically have to go by what's posted not go back and forth with a customer. The only reason I still gave 3 stars is because of the music.",

They normally have the Star One Allstars Band playing and they are fantastic. Later in the night, a DJ spins R&B and Hip Hop.  There is a dance floor.  The drinks are good but are about $14 so they are not cheap.  They also offer Hookahs although I don't partake in it.  It's a great place to get a table with your friends or just go with your mate and have a relaxing and fun evening.",
