To start we had the tuna tartare on the waffle chips along with the octopus.  The octopus was very tender but nicely charred.  We also ordered oysters which were very fresh and complimented with some great sauces.  The kobe beef special is amazing and the Uni they had was the sweetest uni I have ever had!    The only downside I would say is it's a small place so it can take sometime for your food when they get busy but their service makes up for it.",

    "text": "From the outside, wasn't sure what to expect from this place.  The sign reminds me of a dive bar I used to go to in Waikiki.  It didn't help that there were some younger \"kids\" smoking cigarettes out front, sitting on the hood of their car.  If Other Mama's yelp rating wasn't so high, I would have jumped right back into my car, assuming this place isn't my scene. Lol.   BUT I walked in...and WHOA.  The inside is not at all what I expected.  It's an open kitchen format, but done in a very homely manner.  It's not at all flashy.  All of the servers are wearing baseball t's and it's very casual, although you may see customers dressed up on a date or having cocktails after work.  The vibe is very \"downtown\" (you know what I mean), but it's located about 5 minutes from my house, so WIN!!!!    My first visit I was solo, and sat at the bar.  I ordered the organic chicken over a bed of Shishito Peppers & sweet potatoes.  It came out sizzling on a cast-iron plate.  Everything about this dish was yum.  I particularly liked the rock salt over the chicken.  It gave that pop of saltiness here and there, which wasn't too overwhelming.  Shishito peppers were great and the sweet potatoes were deeeeeelish!   My second visit was with my boyfriend a few days later and we decided to sample the sashimi sampler, and amberjack + the organic chicken.  Yep!  Had to get it again.  It's just so good!  The amberjack is as good as everyone raves it to be!  During this dinner I even said \"I wish they had more dishes like THIS!\" The fish provided on the sampler is unbelievably fresh. I haven't had sashimi this good in a very long time.  Our server was courteous to ask what our favorite sashimi type of fish was, and the sampler was created with our specific tastes in mind.  LOVE!   Recently we went with my daughter and my boyfriends brother and we enjoyed another very delicious meal. We had all of our original favorites plus we tried the special, Alaska king salmon in a cherry ponzu.  Omg.  It melted in my mouth & the basil complemented the dish very well.  We also tried the Pork belly fried rice which came recommended by our server.  I'm not a huge fried rice fan (I know, I know, being from Hawaii, that is pretty strange), but if I have the option to order fried rice, I never do.  Everyone else wanted to try it, so I took a bite.  Pretty good, but not my thing. I probably won't partake in that dish again. Everyone else raves about it, so it must just be my personal preference. On this visit my daughter had the chicken wings (sauce on the side) and the criss-cut fries.  They don't have a kids menu and a lot of the regular menu items are a little too adventurous for a picky eater, but she managed to find something to enjoy.    Overall, Other Mama is a 5 star restaurant. The service is always on point. The food is always delicious and thoughtful.  The atmosphere is comfortable and not at all pretentious.   You can tell that the owner of this place really put some thought into the dishes and decor.  Other Mama is my type of eatery!",

    "text": "Came here with my hubby to meet up with my cousin and her husband.   I started off with the Agnes which had a nice hibiscus base and the husband got the Beryl which had a really nice balance of apricot, bourbon and absinthe.   We shared various plates -   Yuzu chicken wings - these were 4 huge pieces. Really crispy and good flavor. I wasnt getting \"yuzu\" from it though, had more of a sweet and spicy gojuchang sauce and some diced onions and cilantro on top.   Shrimp and jalapeno hushpuppies - this was a small plate of bite sized bits. Decent flavor, but was least favorite item.   Pork Belly Kimchi Rice - this came in a hot pot so it can get some crisp bits. This was pretty solid of a rice, tender pork belly.   Amberjack crudo - very good flavor, but smaller than most servings you get of a crudo/sashimi type plate at a Japanese spot. Still, worth ordering as it was a fresh and bright dish.  Asparagus tempura - came with 2 sauces and had a nice light crisp coating to it. Simple, but very good.   The star for me was the oysters. $1- $2 depending on the type. The plus is there's various interesting sauces for it but my 2 favorites were the rosemary mignonette and the pickled peppers and habanero.   My husband has been here before, but this was my first impression was positive. I think it's a good spot for a nosh and a beverage or lighter dinner more than a filling dinner as small plates can rack up. It's not a huge menu, but all the offerings are interesting. I definitely will be back for drinks and oysters and try the rest of the menu.",

    "text": "First off my family really enjoys this establishment. The atmosphere is nice the food is wonderful. My grievances with this establishment is the waiter that took care of us on Father's Day. He made the unfortunate mistake of spilling 3 drinks on my wife, soaking her. Her entire purse and all of its contents got wet. My poor mother was scrubbing in and outside of my wife's purse. All her belongings were out on the table as she had to wipe everything down. Her clothes and even underwear was drenched. The waiter was not apologetic nor did the other staff seem to care about what had just happened. This was at 5pm so it wasn't very busy. They did not have a sense of urgency to assist a patron of their establishment who was drenched. It was unfortunate that the customer service was lacking. Proceed later on that night, My wife was somewhat cleaned up and her new very expensive purse was ruined. The food arrived which was great as usual. As the night ended and the bill arrived, nothing was comped or even slightly discounted considering the discomfort my wife had throughout the night. I had to talk to the manager, who comped a few desserts, but was not nearly appropriate for what had happened earlier. I was just very disappointed at how things were taken care of, especially for the fact that we have been coming to this establishment many times. I hope that the management staff reads this review and teaches their waiters and other staff more appropriate customer service.   Mistakes happen but please make it right. Common sense",

Solid. 3) French toast and cavier. The taste was good, but the disappointing part was that the taste of the cavier barely came through, more on the aftertaste. Definitely by no means a bad dish.  The service was very good--the server, whose name I forget, knew the menu thoroughly, explained it well, and checked in several times. Very satisfying experience.",

    "text": "All I can say is the food here has more personality than the wait staff. I will go out of my way for their spring happy hour menu. The octopus ceviche made me reminiscing of my trip to Cancun but then I got extremely sad because I'm not in Mexico and I have to go to work tomorrow. I think it was served with sweet potato chips but I'm not super cultured so I couldn't say with any certainty. Also, the blue crab hush puppies were packed thicker than my thighs with flavor and are a must eat. We also ordered a naked cowgirl oyster and it didn't look like any naked cowgirl I've ever seen but it slurped pretty well.  Make sure to bring a megaphone with you because I think the staff is trained to mumble. Our server was WAY awkward and I kind of felt like I was breathing her air but eventually she cracked a smile and I was able to confirm she has teeth. 4stars (for the hush puppies)",

It's a small restaurant you have to stumble upon on Yelp, because it's not in a very popping plaza/location nor is it very welcoming from the outside. However, once you're inside you'll feel like you're no longer in Vegas. It has an open kitchen, welcoming decor and a great bar. On my one visit alone I saw a couple of guys here on their own just for the Happy Hour and to talk to the bartenders. It's one of those places!  The food is seafood/sushi/bar food? It's an interesting mix. They had parts of their menu written in Japanese on the wall, however it doesn't have the atmosphere for me to want to eat sushi.  We went with the spicy tuna tartare and waffle fries, calamari, oysters, a couple of drinks and the whole fish. All were really great, but I enjoyed the calamari the most. The whole fish was filling and deboned (YES, no digging for bones), but came out a little too burnt for my liking. Ask for it to be a little less charred! :)  The happy hour is great and I will definitely be back for it. It's a cute spot to sit and chat with your date and enjoy the atmostphere. Easy parking, but maybe don't keep your valuables in the car! :P",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I had dinner here last month during a long weekend in Vegas. Despite a packed dining room, we were able to snag two spots at the raw bar where we proceeded to have a memorable experience - both with the service and with the food. We ordered the spicy tuna tartare, salmon poke, grilled octopus, and some incredible drinks, including the Billie Joe.   The salmon poke was so good I wanted to lick my plate afterwards. Not joking. The rest of the food was outstanding and the craft cocktails were spot on. This is the type of place where you want to graze for hours: chat with the foodies next to you (including the chef from another local restaurant who makes this place his go-to spot), order another item from the chalkboard, and chat up the server for way too long until they're pretty much rolling you out the door.  This place is a must in Vegas. I can't say enough.",

    "text": "Followed them on Instagram after seeing other posts and thought their food would have unique flavors and it'd be just a flavor bomb in my mouth. Finally had the time to try it last weekend. Came on a Saturday evening around 6ish with no res. There were a couple of tables empty but those were \"reserved\" so got the last two seats at the bar.  After scanning the menu, decided on the uni oyster, spicy wings, spicy tuna with waffle fries, blue crab hush puppies and chicken fried lobster. All tasted average. Nothing special about the flavor combinations. The wings were too sweet for my taste and the Chicken Fried Lobster was overcooked and had no depth of flavor. We sat right in front of the sushi station and am so glad we didn't order any sashimi. The woman handling the sashimi seemed inexperienced and flustered with her orders. She butchered the uni even though it was just spooning it onto the plate. Had such high hopes for this place before coming here but probably won't be back.",

We decided to order more oysters of a different variety.  6 blue point oysters $1.50 ea. - get these! These oysters lived a very good life lol! Very big and juicy.  Amberjack crudo HH - server described it like yellowtail. Sashimi had a more firm texture but was delicious. ponzu salsa was amazing, wish I had this sauce to drench my oysters in lol  Spicy yuzu wings HH 5 pcs. - very good. The wings were gigantic and crispy. Wasn't spicy to us at all. The pickled veggies were great with it. They were a little overcooked, some of the meat was dry but I'd rather overcooked than undercooked lol  Miso honey ice cream $3/one scoop - we weren't gonna get dessert but thank goodness our server told us about their house-made ice cream flavors. We were like,  'whaaaat?' when we heard about this flavor and just had to try it out. It reminded me of salted caramel. BF thought it was a little too salty but I loved it.

    "text": "Mom and I ventured out here on our first night in Vegas.  It was a bit of a haul but we finally made it and were glad we did.  We were expecting great food but were pleasantly surprised by the entertainment we were also provided, in the form of two attention-seeking girls who apparently came back after dining there earlier in the evening (\"Yeah, we got our Christmas tree but got home and didn't feel like dealing with it so we came back here!\"). They were attractive (and on the prowl) so definitely garnered the attention of the bartender and chef. I *think* I eyerolled at everything they said. Really?  Fireball shots?  Sorry, eyeroll.  On to the food.  Great food.  It's sushi/sashimi and share plates done with nary a Japanese chef in sight.  However, that was no problemo since Dan, the chef and proprietor did a bang-up job.  Sounds like he's had gobs of experience including training in Japan.  Favorites:   - Caviar on French Toast - Live Clam and Live Scallop: Both very fresh but the scallop was a little anemic. - Uni: Also very fresh; we got two orders and received two pieces total...so 1 order, 1 piece. - Oysters on a half shell, 1/2 dz with 3 types:  We left the sauces up to Dan and they were pretty delicious though I don't remember what they were. - Drinks:  The bartender was very attentive (until the girls came in ha ha).  His drinks were delicious but I really enjoyed the Agnes.  The \"Ok's\": - Oysters Foie Rockafeller:  I thought these were ok for roasted oysters.  The foie melted and you didn't really taste much of it.  Also, they were brinier than usual.  I still ate 3 of them.  Mom had one and wasn't a fan. - Kauai Shrimp with kimchi fried rice add-on:  I actually liked the kimchi fried rice.  Shrimp was ok.  Mom ate a little of this since she was already stuffed.  All in all, a great meal with the aforementioned entertainment.  I would return, likely with more people so we can try more things.",

An expressionless male employee walked over to us and asked if we had a reservation. I told him that we did not. He then told us that he had one table for us and put us in a location right next to the only other couple eating in the restaurant. His attitude was horrible.  The restaurant was also very hot inside.  The workers in the kitchen also looked not very happy to be there.  A friendly waitress came over and gave  us a couple of menus. Glancing at the menu I quickly realized that the selection was very minimal but we wanted to give it a try. We ordered two glasses of Rose at $12 apiece and several food items. The wine arrived at the table and looked no more than a shot glass of wine poured into a wine glass. We told the waitress and asked for the manager. A man walked over to us without introducing himself as the manager and asked us what was wrong. We mentioned the small pour of wine and asked him how many ounces were in there. He told us five. I said I've never seen such a small amount of wine served like that in a restaurant. Again with no expression at all, he told me the best he could do was give us one more ounce of wine. We were shocked. His attitude was awful and we decided to leave.   We will never go back to this restaurant!",

They had a selection of chef's oysters on special.  We ended up eating 1.5 dozen (they were really good), and then trying 2 of everything else they had on the menu (they were good too!).  They rotate what they have, so what we had may not be what is available all the time.  Off the menu, we tried several items.  The two standouts for me where the octopus ceviche and the cauliflower with pistachio and shishito; though I also have to give some props to those \"hush puppies\" which were almost like mini crab cakes since there was so much crab in them.  I can see us going here again when we are back in town.",

Cocktails were unique and quality especially the whiskey manhattans. Good quality craft beers on tap. We sat at the bar and the restaurant was not too busy at 5pm on a Thursday when they open for happy hour. Service was fast and friendly and they explained all their specials very well. I can't wait to go back to this restaurant. Prices compliment the food well.",

And our server was very nice and friendly. So the down fall was that our food took forever to come out. We ordered a few different things.  I tried 2 of each of their 4 types of oysters, which came with a choice of 2 sauces. I opted for some sort of salsa which was great. And I think a wasabi cocktail sauce? Which tasted just like a normal cocktail sauce. We tried the waffle fries which were fantastic. The plum bbq sauce that goes with them was killer! We also tried the Pork belly kim chi dish which came with a fried egg, and some rice. This was very good! Bluemoon, and asahi on tap can't go wrong! We really wanted to try their desserts, but we couldn't as we were pressed for time to get to our show because our food was slow to come out...",

The kimchi fried rice with pork belly was on point! The blue crab hand roll was awesome but the spicy tuna not too much. Ceviche with root chips was a good starter.  For drink, I tried Bessie which was recommended by one of the Yelpers and I do not regret taking that tip. The menu seems to change so my review may only be a momentary comment for the food. But the service was superb. I saw smiles from the entrance to table and through out the meal. Overall, with some expected variance of personal preference, Other Mama deserves 5 stars!",

Very small cuts of sashimi that's not only over priced (I don't mind paying top dollar for good sushi), but also not too fresh. The oysters were okay in terms of freshness, but they were small and grainy. The rice in nigri was not of the consistency of a good Japanese restaurant like Sen of Japan, or even Naked Fish. We also ordered their spicy chicken wings and kimchi fried rice. Bith dishes were okay, but nothing to write home to at this price point. At 7pm on Friday night, this place was dead. Service was good, but server was pretty clueless about Asian food, and didn't know much about what kimchi really was and etc, even though it was one of their dishes.  The only highlight of our more than $100 meal was my cocktail drink. I ordered a rum mixed drink, and it was actually quite good.",

Honestly everything was ok.  The hushpuppies were good but lacked that certain \"made with love\" aspect that they needed for me to really love them.  They were too small, too perfectly round and too uniform.  I mean, the flavor was ok....just lacked that certain homemade quality.  The grilled octopus was the best thing of the night.  For $16 they could have at least put 2 tentacles on the plate. But it was cooked perfectly, very tender with a bit of a crunch.  The side of beans were small and random and the side salad was useless and forgettable with not enough dressing. As for the mains , my boyfriend had the kim chi fried rice with pork belly and egg.  Good, but pretty standard nothing to scream about.  You could get something 10x better in Chinatown or koreatown with much more food for half the price.  I had the organic 1/2 chicken with spinach and potatoes.  Bland super dry.  The spinach was the best part...which is sad bc I could easily make it at home.  It needed a sauce and more seasoning.  The potatoes  were not seasoned and were boring.  In other words chances are you can probably make something identical to it at home for cheaper that tastes better.  Kudos tho to the excellent service and hipstery Brooklyn vibes.  Ps it's mid October and their menus said spring 2017....just saying.",

The inside is smaller than I thought from seeing the pics, not quite as hipster as the sign would make it seem. Wife and I got a bunch of small plates, and were really pleased with the variety. I thought all the dishes were great, my favorites being some mussels in a foie gras broth and deviled eggs with fried oysters. Tried a few pieces of sashimi, these were fresh and tasty. Only complaint, which is probably my bad, is that it was sort of expensive for what we got. Granted, we ordered *small* plates, but they indeed are small. I think it would've been smarter for us to get one small plate and share two entrees, instead of getting like 6 small plates. With two drinks a piece and tip the bill was close to $200, not what I had planned for a weekday out but it was still delicious. Definitely worth a try.",

They had about 5-6 different oysters from different regions. The oysters were so fresh and the ponzu sauce is LIFE. I would put that stuff on everything. We also got the chicken fried lobster which was my absolute favorite dish. The breading was super light so you can still taste the lobster. We also got the broiled shrimp with potatoes (amazing) and the tuna tartare and waffle fries. I am usually not a tuna person but this was the best. It tasted so fresh, I have never had any fish that tasted so clean. Next time we go to Vegas we are making another trip to Other mama. I really don't think you could go wrong ordering anything here, so worth it!  Travel Tip: The Uber tried to make the pickup for other mama behind the strip mall on a dead end street which seems sketchy. You may want to call and let them know exactly where you are.",

Oysters were good. Amberjack crudo was really fresh with great flavors. So fresh, I'll have to try their sashimi on the next run. Had the miso honey ice cream, which was stated was the most popular and tasted like an interesting twist on salted caramel but the vietnamese coffee ice cream was the winner. Noise level was a bit loud but they serve plenty of drinks so it's expected to be loud. Will be coming back for sure.",

Steak, Miso Hollandaise, Waffle Fries: Steak was cooked perfectly and how convenient to have it all sliced up  - Kimchi Fried Rice, Pork Belly, Farm Egg : Pretty dang good for not being a korean spot. I have to say this is one of the best kimchi fried rice I've had in awhile. So much flavor and the pork belly was proportional to the rice.",

Took the food back to my apartment, and the items out of the bag (which were boxed well).  The field greens and chicken fried lobster I ordered were put into the same box, which was a bit of a serendipitous happenstance - the items mixed together were better than either of the items on their own. The cod that I additionally got was flaky, moist, and delicious.  I will be back here whenever I'm in Vegas.",

Nice and crispy and NOT thick, they were like chips.   The service was great and very friendly. Even though it was busy, their kindness made up for the lag in attendance! They have many great suggestions and are great at their menu knowledge.  I highly suggest this place to others and will be back to try everything else.

They have a blackboard that has their specials and believe that I always get the raw oysters.  Their kimchi fried rice is a MUST have along with their NY steak that comes with their waffle fries.  The amberjack crudo is really good as well.  I love Uni & this place (when they have it) has the best Uni in town!  It's better than any sushi place.

The open kitchen is not working to their advantage because the crew was less than enthusiastic & they all looked stoned & uninterested.   We ordered sashimi ... tuna, fluke & salmon.  Fish was room temperature, fluke was not cut appropriately & chewy & tuna was acceptable.    Overall - would not recommend.",

So I thought the service was okay, our waiter didn't seem like she was too knowledgable about the menu but its okay the food made up for it.  I can't even fathom which dish I liked the best but I will name a few that stood out for me. Oysters are a must. It def reminded me of the oysters in Seattle. I haven't found one in town that were just as good as the oysters there until I came to Other Mama.  Spicy Tuna Tartare with waffle fries I loved the texture of the waffle fries with the softness of the tuna tartare. It was a great combination. Prime N.Y.

Recently, the waffle fries weren't as big and wonderful as I recall but it may have been an off night. Still worth starting with. Spicy edamame was finger licking good for a pre-meal start.   Drinks are as good as any mixology bar around.  Sashimi game was on par with the best of Vegas raw fish, at a lower price.   The shrimp skewers and Kim Chi fried rice were average on this visit - but...  The fried chicken was divine.   At Other Mama, it's often about the night's specials, so pay attention to that chalk board.   For dessert, skip the fancy (Japanese cheesecake or panda cotta) and go with flight of ice cream scopes. Don't miss the salted caramel one.  Best of Other Mama is service. They squeezed in our group of 5 at late notice, our server was attentive and even rigged a to-go cup for my Diet Coke when we left out of a plastic container and a punched hole for the straw.",

Amber was amazing I always forget the waiter/waitress name but I couldn't forget her. From start to finish it's one of the best dining experiences I've had in Vegas in years and we eat out ALOT! If you like something different with a Asian fusion kinda twist thing then you will love this place. I honestly can't find one thing wrong with them. A++ .",

He broke down every ingredient and really educated us about what we were eating, our bartender Cooper gave us an excellent choice of beverage. I chose just something simple Hendricks and and water but my fiance she wanted something different. He took the time to ask her what she liked and helped her with the perfect drink. We had the the blue crab  hush puppies and the razor clam ceviche. It was amazing!!! Dillon recommend the kimchi rice with pork belly. He took the time to call explain every ingredient and teach us how it was made. At the end of the night the chef angel came and greeted us. I have never felt more at home . He took the time to hang out and tell us how they hand pick all their ingredients! I felt like we were not just customers but family. I would definitely recommend coming here and there is nothing on the menu that you could be disappointed on . If I could give it 10 stars I would! Dillon was our server cooper our bartender and the chef was angel!!!",

    "text": "When I got word that there's a new swanky place in town, I hurried my tush over with one of my gal pals. This place has everything: oysters, wine by the glass, couples having public freak outs (well, just one on our account).   The staff promptly sat us without a reservation even though they were hitting a dinner rush at the time. We started out with oysters on the half shell, which was superb. My friend had the steak rare with waffle fries (a must try!) and I had the grilled whole fish. The portions were very generous and my fish paired very well with their white wine selection. Half way through our meal we decide to get the Japanese fried chicken and fried mushrooms.  By the time our chicken and mushrooms arrived, the woman next to us starts balling out and stabbing her food. It was awkward, but the food still tasted extraordinary. 1/3 of the way through our chicken (served with some sort of tangy aolie), the man with the balling woman suggests that they should leave. The woman tried to leave with her glass of beer (a Stella, I believe, which they have on draft) and he says, \"I dont think you can go outside with that.\" So homegirl shot guns this beer that's about 3/4 full. What a champ. He didn't know what he's done (they never do).   Anyway. Five stars. Would return for the food AND the drama.",

They specialize in raw fish dishes,  but have other items,  too,  as well as some cool artisan cocktails,  an interesting beer list and some very overpriced wine.   I had the tuna tartare with waffle fries.  Good,  but not all that spicy.  A little salty due to the fries. But a good dish overall. I had the snapper Carpaccio from the rotating menu. It was served slightly warm,  not 100% raw, odd for a Carpaccio. But nevertheless it was quite tasty. But the star was the grilled octopus from the rotating menu.  Amazing.  Perhaps the best I've eaten.   The Svetlana cocktail,  with house infused horseradish vodka,  is quite interesting and very good if you like horseradish, as I do.   Service was a tad slow because they were so busy,  but it was still good. The wait staff and bartenders really know their product.   Highly recommended.   Dinner for one,  3 small plates,  2 cocktails,  tax and 20% tip, $88.",

Alan and Charlotte are amazing and also the very helpful guy behind the bar that was genetically bred from Hugh Jackman and Liam Neeson has the best suggestions for drinks and food. I don't know any other place in town that has such great selection and fresh seafood. Definitely get the kimchi rice last as it will fill you up and you need to take it home to eat it late at night when you wake up hungry at 2am and start binge watching Netflix. I recommend a Hugh Jackman or Liam Neeson movie: Thank you for the great service and food!",

The salty, the sweet, the creamy.. again, I have dreams about Caviar French toast.  2) Please refer to number 1. 3) They were highly accommodating to my 20+ guests who each had their own check, when we took over half of their restaurant on a Thursday night.  4) Fresh oysters - must have and affordable. Great sauces on the side.  5) My drink of choice: The Trixie 6) Oysters fois Rockefeller - COME ON NEED I SAY MORE?  7) Deviled eggs - fantastic 8) Sushi is the hero of the evening. It's what Dan Khromer is known for, and I should have put it first.. except Caviar French Toast.   Thanks for a wonderful celebration, and I can't wait to visit again soon.",

I have been obsessing about coming here for their French toast and caviar for the longest time and on my birthday we did. We got there after 6pm on a Tuesday and they were pretty busy. Well for a tiny place almost ever seat was taken. Without a reservation we seated right away.   The service was pretty good but kind of slow. Got the food slow and got our drinks very slow. The French toast and caviar was more toast then caviar but was good. Little soft French toast bites eggy bread smeared with cream a dollop of caviar and topped with shredded greens very cute yet fancy. The steak with hollandaise sauce was aaaaaammmmmaaaazzzing! Paired with some crispy lattice cut fries that too was also delish. Even though the drinks were slow to come they fast to down and quick to get us tipsy. The Billie Joe which looks completely different then some of the pix on other Yelpers review was good and the fancy Agnes didn't just look good if tasted good and did its job.   Super hip place in a weird location and a bit pricy. I came, I saw, I conquered....well for now! I might be back to try the Bronzino and the pork belly kimchi fried rice and oysters because my bday night was cut short cause of the littles. Anyhow cool place but Exocet to pay Hotel prices.",

Service and atmosphere was great. Had 3 dozen oysters and assorted raw fish dishes. 24 hours later, 5 of the 8 of us came down with a violent case of food poisoning, including one of the children. Complained to Allen, and although he said he was sorry, I felt compelled to post this. He didn't offer any compensation for the $257.00 bill. We as a family frequently go out to dinner and I've never had to pay a restaurant to get us sick.  Come on, you're ZAGAT rated. Control your kitchen and food handlers or you will lose you ratings. Another guy also posted food poisoning that night on Yelp.",

From service to drinks to food! All around a great spot!! The spicy tuna tartare tastes very clean and fresh. Nice twist with it being served with waffle chips! Shishito peppers aren't the usual with a ton of spicy sauces but a hint of lemon, nuttiness. Kimchi fried rice with pork belly, almost what I make at home! And the Rhode Island Calamari which is the best I've had in Vegas!!   Specialty cocktails are just as good.... Sofia being my favorite!

Two people can eat through half the menu easily, not including raw bar and sashimi. Look for seasonal specials, they were the highlights of the meal.   Plan to spend beaucoup bucks, especially if you indulge in the phenomenal cocktails as well. All of the syrups and infusions are made in house, even the maraschino cherries were made in house by the bartender, and they were delicious!

    "text": "5 stars on the quality and execution of the unicorn-like, utterly fantastic Mussels special we ate three (3) servings of last month. Edge-of-shell-to-edge-of-shell, these incredibly plump and delicious mussels were a dream come True. SO hard to find good quality mussels and a chef who knows what to do with them. Bravo!  The oysters here are *expertly* shucked. And for those who scoff or make fun of the fact that I *always* mention shucking skills in my reviews that involve raw oysters/clams - I stand my ground and attest that 90% of the shuckers out there in restaurant world don't know what the hell they're doing when it comes to shucking, and the 90% find a way to ruin raw oysters/clams by getting hard bits of debris (shell bits, ocean crap) into the finished, plated product. So 5 stars for an uber-clean shuck. Every one of the 36 raw ones that came to our table was debris-free. That's hard to do! Molto bravo!  The lighting... the newish Edison bulb lighting is a great effort in trying to warm up the joint, but dimmers are desperately needed to ease the retinal burn, if you know what I'm sayin'. Those fancy unfiltered bulbs are wayyy too bright for naked eyes at normal stock wattages. We kindly asked our waiter to turn off 2 of the 3 bulbs that were blazing away in the floor lamp directly facing the West side of our party of 6. Much better, but with candles already on the table, I wonder if floor lamps are even necessary? There's gotta be a perfect balance...  Overall, a huge win for team Other Mama! We ate and drank and ate and drank to the tune of $100+ per person and loved it. Yeah, not a cheap outing, but we'd much rather spend this in our neighborhood than in a casino corporate joint. It feels good to chow down locally!  Cheers to the fact that when we walked in, we recognized both of the two larger dining parties that were already seated. Yelp really brings 'em out of the woodwork when the noshing's good!",

Everything was delicious that we ended up having, from their selection of fresh oysters, fresh sashimi, crazy-good hush puppies, all the way to our last course - the kimchee fried rice with pork belly and a fried egg on top.  That was an outstanding end to a great meal.  They have a nice selection of wines, beers, and interesting cocktails as well.  Happy hour is definitely worth it as they have a separate menu with enough food items to choose from and nicely-priced beers and house wines.  Reservations are recommended as this place seems to pack up fast so you want to grab that table ahead of time!  Shout out to Allen (the GM) and his staff for a superb dining experience!

    "text": "On our last night in town, the wife and I dined at Other Mama.  Locals are probably already very well aware of this gem of an oyster bar/sushi bar/tapas restaurant/cocktail bar located way off-Strip in a non-descript strip mall on Durango, so this is definitely for the out of towners who appreciate excellent food and drink.  The exterior of the restaurant doesn't scream its presence and could be easily missed if you're not looking for it.  The interior of the restaurant was uncomplicated and unpretentious, giving the distinct impression that much more time, effort, and money was spent on where it matters most...in the back of the house (and it showed based on the food and drinks that we received).  The dining room was smaller than I had expected, with much of seating at the sushi bar overlooking the kitchen and at the cocktail bar.  We arrived right when they opened for service at 5PM on a Thursday in time for happy hour where they offered $1 oysters, drink and food specials.  The dining filled up steadily while we were there.  Needless to say, we binged on happy hour and regular priced food and drinks.  Even at regular price, no cocktail was more than $12 and they were of equal or better quality in concept and execution to anything you'd find on the Strip.  Their selection of oysters, sourced from both East and West coasts, were exceedingly fresh, delicious, and offered enjoyable contrasts in flavor.  They came with four sauces, a ponzu, wasabi cocktail sauce, rosemary mignonette, and pickled habanero pepper (not as hot as you'd think).  The happy hour small bites were made for sharing; we had the Ceviche of Octopus, Shrimp, White Fish, and Habanero ($7); Organic Salmon Poke, Beets, and Avocado ($8); Shishito Peppers, Cauliflower, and Pistachio ($5); and Hush Puppies made with blue crab and jalapeno ($5, think bite sized crab cakes, but with more crab than cake).  There was obvious genius behind the food as it was novel in concept and all delicious.  Hey, anytime you can make cauliflower a worthy co-star in delicious dish takes a keen mind and skill.  The seafood and produce were fresh and first rate.  Not to be forgotten, service was on point.  Dan and Dave, who worked the front of the house and behind the bar made us tourists, feel like locals.  My fellow Vegas visitors, seriously, get off of the Strip and check out Other Mama.  With Uber and Lyft, it's never been easier and less expensive to get to and from this local treasure.  Other Mama may have the best happy hour in town and it's definitely in the conversation of being the best all-around restaurant in terms of the quality of its food, drink, service, and value in the entire city.  We're definitely coming back the next time we're in town.",

This is where some of the great chefs in Las Vegas prefer to eat - and isn't that where you want to go, too?  Other Mama specializes in a dazzling array of seafood offerings, as well as interesting twists on favorites.  If you don't eat fish, there are other items (chicken, steak, veg.), as well. They have a superb fresh oyster bar and great sushi.  Over the years, we've tried many dishes.  My favorites are the blue crab hush puppies, the ceviche, kim chi fried rice, whole fish, chicken, tempura, deviled eggs, and the lobster when it is on the menu.  It's all excellent. The prices are reasonable, as this is not a plush, over the top place but a comfortable environment in a most interesting shopping center west of the strip.",

I ordered the salmon sashimi salad. I asked the waitress if they bottled that dressing. It was a miso vinaigrette. Delicious doesn't describe it enough. It was so good. My husband and I also shared the chicken fried lobster bites and pork belly. Both of us loved them! My husband especially enjoyed the lobster. And he happened to be particularly hungry this night so he also ordered tuna sashimi, and the Kobe beef entree. He drooled over the Kobe beef. Ate every bite. Even the carrots and he hates carrots. The juices were just everything. The bar was also good, I had wine he had a few cocktails. Overall our experience was wonderful and I would go back just for that salad.",

The restaurant specialize in fresh oysters, sashimi and creatively hand crafted cocktails. Fish flown here daily is what I learned.  The restaurant had a casual, relaxed atmosphere and is small so I would suggest making reservations. We sat at the bar and it was the best seats for us as the open kitchen is in front of you. I like the showcase of an array of oysters on a bed of ice.  The menu was very unique and makes me want to try them all. The drink chose was one of the best drink I had called  Penelope crafted with  Vodka, Sake, Lime, Pomegranate Shrub, Shiso, and Fennel Bitters.  From the Happy hour menu ie 5pm to 6pm we ordered:  *Spicy Tuna Tartare, Waffle Fries   *Ceviche of Octopus, Shrimp, White Fish, Habanero   *Shishito, Cauliflower, Pistachio  *Hush Puppies, Blue Crab, Jalapeno    *Deviled Eggs, Fried Oyster    *Spicy Chicken Wings, Pickled Root Vegetables    From the Specials Board Menu:  Fluke Carpaccio  All the foods had so much flavor, good blend of consistency and texture and so freash! Everything we tried had a bit of kick to it and we were a happy camper.  The staff were attentive, efficient and personable  We will be back no doubt!!",

This time we came back for the amberjack crudo (our favorite-- 2 orders), blue crab hush puppies, hot mamacita oysters ( $1.00 and we had 18... we would have had more but we ate them all!), NY strip steak, oh and how could I forget  Calamari with this delicious sauce.... can't remember exactly what it was because I'm happy, full, and maybe  tipsy . Either way, Other Mama has been able to do what it seems other places in Vegas have had some difficulty with... consistency and staying in their lane.

We had the Fried Oyster Tacos, Chicken Fried Lobster and Grilled Fish (Branzino). It was all excellent. You can taste the care and devotion they have for their food.

The name sounds like they are serving grandmas cooking then when you see the signage design looks like western with a Latina looking lady. Then when you enter the restaurant they have somewhat of a sushi bar. The paintings on the wall are seafood and when you look at the menu they have Japanese, Spanish, French, Korean, Italian cuisine. It's a fusion of everything.   We ordered quite a few dish. Spicy Tuna Tartare with waffle fries do not complement with each other. It doesn't give you the distinct flavor of the tuna tartare with a fries. The ceviche is much better paired with sweet potato fries. You can taste the sweetness of the fries and the spicy flavor of the ceviche. The shishito pepper did not have much of a flavor. It is missing something. Hush puppies crab needs more crab and the deviled eggs are quite fine. The kimchi fried rice is very small for an entree. Also they don't give you bottomless lemonade which is quite odd.   I would say this fusion restaurant is ok. I have not tried the other dish so it maybe better. I would suggest if you are going to order wine and you're in a group, a bottle is better price wise. We got the Jollie Folle Rose and surprisingly good.",

Also, we had a fantastic server, she gave us awesome recommendations being that it was our first time. We tried the hush puppies, the shishito peppers (not my fave, partner loved them), the kimchi fried rice, Roasted Octopus (OMG!!), and a sashimi that was phenomenal (her recommendation). She also recommended my lady a cocktail, Geraldine, she loved it so much she had two.. didn't care to try anything else. I had the Cierra and being that I have sampled my fair share of mezcal cocktails, I loved it. The composition of the cocktail perfectly highlighted the mezcal! We can't wait to go back and try the other half of the menu, luckily we live 7minutes away!",

After getting back from Mexico I have been on this fresh seafood kick in which I thought I wouldn't get to experience without paying the high Las Vegas Strip prices.   This place has been on my radar for some time now. A chef I work with actually recommended this spot and glad I took his advice. I will say it was a little bit of a challenge finding this place only because their logo does not really stand out; I love it needless to say though. It offers that shabby/rustic/chic-ey feel. They offer specials of the day and oyster selections may vary based on season.   We started with the sake flight. In the beginning I really didn't care for the taste but as I continued to sip, they got better. We will just say that make sure you have a clean palette before sipping them, it changes the taste completely!   We ordered a little bit of everything - ceviche, octopus, grilled garlic shrimp, mussels in butter four gras and OYSTERS; Kumamoto.   Everyone is so friendly & happy to help! It was a nice change even seeing the GM delivering our food and engaging in conversations.   I left fully satisfied and planning my next date to come back!",

Dan helped us out the whole night, (I think he's the head chef) and he made the carpaccio for us even though it was not on the menu. Ambiance was great, service was amazing, but I'd definitely come back again just for the amazing choices that they have.

I'm not going to really rate anything because there was not one thing I liked more than the other.all I can say is I want to give this place a 1 star rating and hope that I can keep this hidden gem to myself but that would be selfish..I can't wait to eat some more items on this menu!

I tried the bobbie-jo (I think), and it was my usual - gin, cucumber, refreshing. I also had the celina (or something like that??) and it was very cinnamon-y spice-y with a house-infused whiskey and candied ginger. Really liked them both. There is also a short beer list (10ish) and about 15 wines.  The food: awesome! We had some raw oysters (blue points and beau soleils), oysters Rockefeller with foie gras, kim chee fried rice, tuna tartare, Japanese uni, and the chef's choice sashimi. All were good. I always love raw oysters, and especially liked the oysters Rockefeller. The tuna tartare was a really big portion, served with spicy waffle fries, and the fried rice was pretty big too - came with pork belly and a fried egg. I'm not an uni eater, but my husband really loves it, and he said this was some of the best he's had.  The damage: 3 drinks and a bunch of food was $110 total. Pretty reasonable for the quality you're receiving. Blue points were only $1 and beau soleils $2.   The problem: it's not closer to my house!",

    "text": "OMFG FRESH TASTY OYSTERS for under $2 a piece? And you get various oysters to choose from from the east coast? This is what I'm talking about. Vegas needed a place like this on this side of town that's not near the strip.   I did not expect such a hip modern feel from this place. Nice and bright during the day and probably dark and romantic at night. They have a full bar, open kitchen, and plenty of seating throughout the place.   My boyfriend and I had a tasting of all the oysters and found that we loved NY Prime and the Fanny Bay oysters the best. They also come with two sauces that are freshly made! I also tried their Agatha cocktail and it was refreshing and sweet! Definitely will try other ones next time!   We also ordered:  AMBERJACK CRUDO $11: my favorite dish! It was sour and sweet and worked perfect with the ponzu salsa!  SUSHI SAMPLER $15: it was okay honestly. There was a lot of rice and it almost looked like brown rice was mixed in. The tuna was a little fishy also. I liked how the Chef Dan added the mantis shrimp! That's a new one I always wanted to try.   PORK BELLY KIMCHI FRIED RICE: I loved how it came out still sizzling hot! It kinda lacked in flavor and I wished the kimchi was more fermented and had that sour touch to it. The pork belly was delicious though and had many large savory pieces in it! Plus the mushrooms gave it a great kick to it.   Spicy Yuzu Wings $13: Am I the only one who didn't like it? I liked how crispy they were and it wasn't over breaded but it was missing flavor in the actual meat. I honestly didn't like the sauce they used to spread on one side either. It just tasted like sirracha and Yuzu mixed together. For $13 I kinda expect more than 5 wings.   I can't wait to try their fresh live scallops and more raw seafood! Definitely will come back and try other things to see what I like.",

Our party of four began with a dozen of oysters - Fanny Bay, Blue Point and Skookum - and it came with a variety of sauces.  Spicy Tuna Tartare with Waffle Fries was an unexpectedly delicious combination, and Grilled Shrimp Salad came with soba noodles and baby arugula, which seemed odd turned out to be a great assortment of protein, green and whole grain.  Caviar and French Toast with Creme Fraiche was another interesting dish. Unlike the normal toast or baguette, tiny pieces of pancake-like soft savory toast came out and it allowed us to appreciate little by little, rather than swallowing all the caviar at once. We got another batch of toast and I even ate the toast alone - it's that good.  Spicy Yuzu Chicken Wings was the only meat we had, and it played a nice and crispy role in the interim of seafood dishes.  Then the Amberjack nigiri special - it literally melted on my tongue.  And finally, the Japanese Cheesecake with Raspberry Mint Sauce - it didn't really taste like a real Japanese cheesecake, but it's definitely on the softer and fluffier side. I would say, an Italian cheesecake. Tasty piece of it, nonetheless.  The bill came out at $32 per person - not bad at all.  I already have a list of items I'll be ordering next time!",

I came in for a late meal at around 10pm and it was still quite full for the hour.  I sat at the bar and was served immediately and could watch the kitchen and the chef prepare right in front of me.  The way the restaurant works is they have a raw and cooked menu that is always available; they also have a specialty board with daily specials that are limited.  They are also pretty well known for their oyster bar and mix drinks.  I began my meal with a special sashimi platter and then went with the spicy tuna tartare. I also had a sake sampler which gave explanations and tasting notes based on the samples received.  The sashimi was on par with any other top notch sushi restaurant.  The spicy tuna tartare was exceptional.  It came with a large helping of BBQ waffle fries, which were a surprisingly perfect combo for this meal.  This place is off the strip and in the $20-$30 range for a very quality meal.  Come here if you're looking to try sushi but want to venture off the strip and experience a unique vibe.",

So clearly something is on point with the food, but I would say also on point with the the music and the staff.   Go to Other Mama because of the food.  So, it goes without saying, that the food and drink offerings are unique, fresh, refreshing, creative and delicious.  Dan (the owner or one of the owners) is on to something different in the valley and special.  Go because you want to support Dan, his team and his culinary creativity designed for the Las Vegas local.  Know that you have to like fresh seafood, oysters, sushi type stuff, ceviche, etc....this is what they are good at and thus the raw bar concept.    But just when you think that is all they are serving, there is kim chi and roasted shishito peppers that are really spectacular amongst other creative offerings.  There is a huge chalkboard of their daily fresh fish offerings and specials that alone is a feast for the eyes.    Go to Other Mama because of English.  He is a server.  Jovial, tall, really happy to be working at Other Mama and equally passionate about the food and atmosphere of the place.  It is refresing to see serving staff who have risen to the level of loving where they work because they too believe it is great.  English was attentive and friendly and led up down a great evening experience of their best culinary offerings.  He did not stear us wrong and quite honestly, set the tone for our entire evening.   Go to Other Mama because of the music.  So opening at 5PM and staying open late, it is clear they are catering to an industry crowd in many ways.  With that, they have thought hard about their uber cool playlist being pumped into the restaurant.  Capital Cities, Empire of the Sun, some deadmau5, a little Cold Play....it would be what I would choose to listen to and adds to the cool, clean, hip vibe I felt inside.   I will absolutley be back and encourage others to go to!",

I could eat caviar French toast and their foie oysters Rockefeller everyday!  The back bar is stocked with a well chosen selection.  There's some excellent spirits at very attractive price points here.  Cocktail list is a bit overwrought.  Beer list is excellent and pretty well balanced.  I hate the wine list...  Doesn't seem like much thought was put into it.  Where Other Mama falls apart for me is the service (on this visit).  It was abysmal.  The bartender was horrible (I sat at the bar).  She didn't ever actually take my order.  I guess I was fortunate the chef walked by regularly or I might not have eaten tonight.  It began with her discussing her inability to settle an $80 debt with another member of staff.  It continued with her doing a lot of side work and never checking back with me.  I would have ordered more food if anyone had truly cared.  Additionally, I would have left a 25% or greater gratuity instead of the 15% I left just because I felt I had to leave something.  I want to love Other Mama but based upon this visit, I'm not sure what to think.  To the restaurant's credit, the bartender on my last visit was the epitome of an F&B professional.  This one was unforgivably bad.",

Think more dinner combinations.  I had the nigiri combination and the RBC seafood hot pot.  The sushi was pretty good but the size of the fish on top of the rice is on the smaller side.  The seafood hot pot was also okay, but the broth was a bit bitter to enjoy as a soup.  The service was very good.  Based on the how many other good restaurants there are in Vegas now (both on and off the strip), I would not plan on coming back here but would not be opposed if others wanted to do so.",

I seriously prefer their sushi to some of the high end sushi restaurants on the strip and in Korea Town. Everything is extremely fresh and delicious and there are yummy specials on the board every night! My favorite to order is the sashimi deluxe platter, and tonight we added the fried oyster tacos which were so tasty, grilled octopus that was melt in your mouth tender not chewy, and the soft shell crab was lightly breaded which allowed the True flavor of the fresh crab to shine through. The cocktails are always outside of the box, and I love the Japanese whiskey they offer!  The service is always outstanding. Dan the owner is friendly and accommodating, and he takes pride in everything that the restaurant dishes out. It 100% shows. I'm a regular for a great reason!",

Ordered the Kauai Shrimp with Kimchi Fried Rice, Beef Carpaccio, PBR Seafood Hotpot, Oyster Foie Rockefeller, and (off the chalkboard) uni and ikura oysters. While the Oyster Foie was delicious and flavorful, I found the ikura & uni oysters a little lacking. Shrimp with fried rice was decent, as was the carpaccio, but there wasn't anything in particular to rave about. The hotpot was a sour note as it was undersized for what it's priced. Food aside, the waitstaff here were friendly and accommodating; our server made sure to check on the table accordingly.  Overall, my experience here was underwhelming, which is sort of a bummer after seeing that interesting menu. While the oysters were fairly good, I'm not sure if the other pickings here are worth the few extra bucks.",

The place has one of those menus where you want to try everything.. I guess the chef worked under morimoto in philly which makes sense cause everything was top notch.. Got a half dozen oysters with a trio of sauces...amberjack sashimi with blood orange ponzu..mixed seafood ceviche was great.. Octopus melts in your mouth.. Some kind of shrimp, mint, cucumber, ikura roll with no rice.. Really good... For hot dishes, we got kimchee pork belly fried rice with easy egg... Crispy yuzu chicken wings.. And jalapeno hush puppies..    Everything was good, but the standouts were the wings, ceviche, amberjack sashimi with blood orange.. And they also have badass handcrafted cocktails which we had like 4... Pretty reasonable prices too.. I'll definitely be back to try more of the menu.. And cocktails.. And they got anchor steam on draft!!!!",

They use these sweet potato crisps they make that seem to curl up just perfectly. They almost make the dish themselves.  Deviled eggs with fried calamari: nearly didn't order these because I thought deviled eggs would screw up the rest of the food. Girlfriend insisted and they were outstanding. It all fit together so well.  Trout Crudo: wasn't crazy about this. Wouldn't order again. It's sashimi style though so can't fault them too much. Just not my thing.  Honey Mussels with Lobster Broth: off the chain. The mussels are both good and huge. The broth is great, and a nice change from the butter garlic broth you get everywhere else.  Roasted Octopus: the octopus was great. The sauce they use to complement it was too hot for my girlfriend, but she's kinda soft. I loved it, the octopus can be eaten alone its so good.  Ordered a bunch of specialty cocktails. We had the Dalia, svetlana, kiki, ruby and geraldine. They were all good in their own way, just depends on what you're into. Personally Inger the svetlana every time.  Place is awesome, definitely worth checking out. Also nice that it's a small place, so you get your orders very timely, which makes it fine to order piece by piece.",

It is interesting that they call their grandmother \"Other Mama.\" The food here is excellent albeit far from the strip. We had taken Uber all the way out here to try this restaurant. It was really good.  We were trying to celebrate my friend's birthday, but our server was not very discrete about keeping it a surprise. Also, they charged us for the Japanese cheesecake and candle which I thought was a first for me. Other restaurants don't spoil a birthday surprise nor charge for a birthday dessert.  Other than that, the food was delicious. We first started with oysters ranging from small, medium, and large. It was a good variety and very tasty. Then we just ordered a variety of dishes to share including the Shishito with Cauliflower and Pistachio, Oyster Rockefeller, Deluxe Sashimi Combination that included the Amberjack Crudo, Kim Chi Fried Rice with Pork Belly, and Farm Egg, and the Braised Octopus. My favorite was the Braised Octopus. The dishes were tapas style, therefore, you needed to order a couple of dishes to share with friends. Also, I think the pairing of my libation (Svetlana - Horseradish Vodka, Lemon, Ginger Syrup, Becherovka) with the oysters was an excellent suggestion from our server.",

Part sushi/rawbar, part Asian inspired with American influence, part creative cocktail, and part super no nonsense, familial vibe; Other Mama is like the best neighborhood restaurant you've always sought out but never had in your neighborhood.   It's the kind of place where the menu is ever changing, so no two experiences are the same. Where the food has a lot going on, while the menu doesn't say much. Where you're not one of a million customers, and you're bound to know the staff by your second visit.   We showed up on a night they had a private party. I never thought to call ahead to check, but the staff was really chill and set us up with three seats at the bar. Honestly, with a view of the open kitchen, watching them expo, prep, and run 15-20 of the same plates in unison, is the best seat in the house.   This kitchen team is EFFICIENT, and it was impressive. Kinda like watching an orchestra perform. Everyone playing their part, allow us to enjoy pure harmony!   We ordered up a couple dozen oysters (variety changes daily), grilled octopus with a sweet mash, Kim Chee Fried Rice, \"Shrimp and potatoes\" which had 4 huge prawns sauteed in garlic butter and served on a hot sizzling skillet with tiny fried heirloom potatoes, scallop and uni sashimi, and quite a few cocktails and a bit of sake too.   All of it was delicious, and the meal was a helluva lot of fun!   I really enjoyed this spot, and hope more Las Vegans discover it an enjoy it too.   Chef Dan and the team, you rock!  @Nevadabriningco Thanks for the tip!",

I've had the NY Steak, whole grilled fish, kobe steak (specials board), raw oysters, and sashimi platter. I've also tried a few desserts and my favorite is the bread pudding. Haven't had a bad meal here! Definitely recommend and I will for sure be back!",

Asked the server for her top 5 recommendations and without hesitation she banged out great dishes and was very knowledgeable about the whole menu. Of which we ordered at least half of. Cocktails were great service was spectacular. And she was a knights fan, always a plus in Vegas. Recommend to everyone. Too bad they aren't late knight cuz the service industry would crush this place. Tell a friend or three",

Spicy tuna tartare with waffle fires 3. Deviled eggs with fried oyster on top 4. Blue crab hush puppies  Not on the happy hour menu: 5. 1/2 Dozen kunamoto oysters 6. Grilled octopus over a mashed bean concoction  Highlights: Literally everything, except the blue crab hush puppies.  Not a fan of the density of the hush puppies...that's just a personal thing.  The oysters were amazingly fresh and I loved the flavor of the ponzu salsa to put on top.  Our definite favorite was the deviled eggs, the creamy egg with the crunch of the oyster....perfect bite.  The spicy tuna tartare was good, but maybe could have been spicier.  The waffle fries were perfectly crunchy and seasoned well.  The white fish ceviche was really refreshing paired with the sweet potato chips.  The grilled octopus...OMG...most tender octopus I've ever had.  I'm sad I waited this long to come to this place.  Amazing service, my water was always filled and they check on you just enough but not an annoying amount.",

We were seated at the end of the bar. This place is definitely a date night type of dinner! The establishment is small, very limited seating, and has a romantic feel to it.   We ordered the ceviche, chicken fried lobster, and the PBR hot pot. Let me tell you something about this ceviche... IT WAS THE BOMB. Seriously, the best ceviche I've ever had and I've had plenty. The sweet potato chips add a unique flavor to the dish. The quality of the seafood used was spectacularly fresh! The chicken fried lobster was fried to perfection. I should've ordered a side of rice with it because it wasn't really filling lol. My bf really enjoyed his hot pot. I'm not really a fan of alcohol in my food so I didn't like that dish very much. The seafood in it was cooked perfectly though!   The servers & the sous chef at the bar were so attentive and helpful. We will definitely be back & this time with a reservation! I do think the price is a little steep for tapas but the quality is so fresh that it doesn't even really matter. Looking forward to trying out other things on the menu!",

We spent about $68 on food and drinks and were still HUNGRY. This place is great as a night cap or just a starter before you actually go out to a dinner.   The scallops were UH-mazing. Their pricing on oysters are great if you've got a taste for them and just want a few. Prices range from $1-$3 ea.

Our tab was almost $200 for 2 people and would have been more but we decided to leave because she was so rude, dismissive and frankly unpleasant to even speak to. We were being nice but it was hard. It took pretty much sitting and staring for her to acknowledge us, and even then her attitude was \"what now\". I'm so sad too because the food was great and if people wanna try it I would still suggest it but with the added note that you may get treated like a homeless person by the foh. I'm in the service industry and it pisses me off more than anything when you go somewhere to spend your money and feel like you just threw it on the floor and lit it on fire.

I actually passed on the rib-eye I desired and opted for a second wing order with waffle fries. So good that I accidentally on purpose spilled a little sauce on my shirt to lick off later. The Tuna tartare appetizer was fabulous. We loved the pork belly with Kimchi Rice. The whole fish was excellent as were the oysters with bread crumbs and parm. Service was fine. Atmosphere good with a good crowd buzz for a small place. The only beef I had (no pun intended) was the size and cost of my martini. Thus the four stars. I like a martini or two with a nice meal. It makes it easier to pay for the bill. However $16 for a very small martini X 2 plus tax & tip = $40 for two teeny tiny marteenies not served in a martini glass. Wow. I'm not going to let that bother me though.  We'll definitely be back sans the martinis!",

The live scallop was the bomb though.  Dan prepared it right in front of us and seriously, I've never had something so fresh, slightly sweet and velvety.  It melted it your mouth.  So delicious.  The ceviche was also a delicious savory blend of lime and cilantro.  Went perfectly with the sweet potato chips.  The whole grilled barramundi was a nice meaty end to our dinner. It had a light and fresh green salsa on top.  Dave made me a wonderful drink called Agatha which was a sweet way to end the dinner.    It was so nice to talk to Dan and interesting to learn that his girlfriend makes the kimchee for the kimchee fried rice.  We had a sample of the kimchee and it was spot on for kimchee fried rice!

We started with a variety of Oysters ( servers choice), and  Crab hushpuppies ( almost like mini crab cakes). The ceviche was so fresh and tasty , it was served with these sweet potato or plantain chips . We also got the kimchi fried rice and the NY strip. Oh I forgot we also got the spicey tuna hand roll that was on the daily special board, wow was that good ! Much better than any sushi places.  Our server was super knowledgeable about all of the food and gave great recommendations.  I can't wait to bring my friends back so we can try more food! This is a great place if you like to share food, although they don't advertise as \"tapas style\" a lot of the food is easy to share. Thanks for a great dinner and see you guys soon.",

    "text": "Definitely the only table of grey haired tourists there so perhaps I offer a different perspective than other diners. But, maybe not so different.   Like most of the reviewers, a solid four stars. It looks like a \"joint\" from the outside, and the inside is modest. Prices are modest, too. The oysters and beers are a bargain, which even a well-healed traveler can appreciate. The Pork Belly Kim Chi was excellent.  Perhaps could have been spicier for some, but very much to my taste, and the pork belly was like butter but better.   Ceviche very generous and well prepared.  I spend a fair amount of time in Peru so have had it many ways and this preparation is very good. Asparagus tempura was crisp and not overdone.  On a par with that at Raku, a truly great, more expensive Las Vegas restaurant.   The Shrimp & Jalapeno Hush Puppies were not exceptional.  Good enough, not expensive. The Rib Eyes were very good, but steak is steak. So the boil down-  the staff is wonderful.  Enthused and friendly.   Because it was late and they were out of the Foie Gras (seems not the first time) we were treated to a round of drinks.  That was above what I expected and it was appreciated. The food is sometimes a bit cutting edge and that is admirable.   It is refreshing to leave the convention halls and mega hotels and see a chef really working at his craft.  The place is not a bases loaded home run but a lot of fun, a bit audacious, a solid three bagger.  Go with an open mind and you will really enjoy it.",

We have been here twice now, and both experiences have been live-to-tell. To start, our mixologist, English, has been nothing short of the most hospitable bartender I have meet in a long while. Our demands are not uncommon, just something off the menu and specific to his skill level. What he produces are cocktails I would consider classic with a twist. Chef Dan, owner of this fabulous locale, can easily whip up something off menu and delectable to all taste buds. The sashimi platter, though, may be the freshest and most delicious I have ever had. Everything is sustainable or responsibly produced, and growing up in California, that definitely hits home. I will definitely be retuning, with our without friends, because this place is that good.",

    "text": "I heard/read the rave reviews for months and finally made it in for dinner.   Other mama is cute and little. There's only about 6 tables and a bar. The menu is relatively small but there were also 9 specials on the board.   From start to finish, we had great service. They use the team approach - which is nice. Everyone is helping you instead of you looking for your server. They were very attentive and knowledgeable.   I ordered the Francesca for a cocktail. It was described as pear and cinnamon vodka with basil, lime, and bitters. It tasted like lime juice and nothing else. So, they made me a new one. It was certainly better than the first but not as dreamy as the description sounded.   We got lots of food - live scallop from the special board, mushroom tempura, spicy yuzu chicken wings, oysters with mignonette and ponzu salsa, ny steak and whole grilled Branzino and the chocolate pot de creme. Everything was tasty. Nothing was awe inspiring. Unfortunately, I don't feel the need to say, \"you have to go to try the....\" Again, no real complaints, all tasty, just nothing that really stood out. Some nit picky notes: the Branzino was under seasoned and the steak lacked flavor/pizazz. Everything was cooked nicely. I missed the flavored promised by the descriptions here too. I didn't get yuzu in the wings, I didn't taste miso or hollandaise on the steak, just a warm sauce. The fries were delightful. The assorted mushroom tempura was fun and yummy! The oysters were perfectly briny.   So $161 for dinner for two. We did have some food leftover. For an $80 dinner, I'd hope to be singing from the rooftops. Not the case. However, not disappointed either. Just satiated and off into the world. I'm not sure I'll return, but I wouldn't discourage anyone from trying it!",

    "text": "I first visited Other Mama shortly after it opened. I didn't have a bad experience, but I didn't have a wow, life-changing dining experience either. And in a place like Vegas where everyone fights to upstage themselves I left thinking \"meh\". And so today I'm taking a second to admit my shortcomings as a diner, and apologize for every meh comment I ever made about this place. My dinner last night was....f*cking epic (can you type f*cking on yelp?). And to think I almost missed out by not coming back! I think sometimes it's important to admit that we carry our personal issues with us to the restaurant and maybe flavor the food with our own saltiness. I'll admit the last time I came here the company I brought with me was lame and I might have let it ruin my dinner. Shrug. None of us are perfect. But last nights dinner showed me that there's magic in second chances because simply put this was one of the best dinners I've had in Vegas, on or off the strip. The amberjack was amazing...the lobster tostadas..then these lovely little fresh oysters..the Bianca cocktail-so good I had to order it 3 or 4 times just to make sure I wasn't imagining it...this crazy delicious rice dish made with the broth from the mussels and foie gras butter!!!!...and the waffle fries and tuna? My first bite was like the culmination of every great postmates order I've ever had. Who would have thought that waffle fries were made for poke? These guys. The talented, innovative people at Other Mama. I sat there like every obnoxious food addict with an Instagram account, documenting every delicious bite of food. I can't even tell you everything we ate, it's just kept coming in waves of seafood satisfaction until finally our quest to find the best fish in Las Vegas came to an end. It really is as good as everyone says. And then my friends, the miso ice cream happened. I died. And went to foodie heaven. Amen.",

We stayed off the strip and didn't really want to head down there for dinner so I poked around and was lucky enough to find Other Mama.   My recommendation? Just go there. The food was fantastic. You won't be disappointed by anything you order. They would have gotten 5 stars from me if it weren't for the lackluster (and at times terrible) service. But more on that later.  First and foremost, the food was fantastic. Thoughtful composition and spot on flavors. LOT's of dining options on the chalk board. Highlights for me were the Amberjack Crudo with Ponzu Salsa, Deviled Eggs with Fried Oyster (interesting pairing of flavors and texture), a grilled octopus appetizer that was so perfectly prepared I almost wept and the whole grilled fish.  Then the cocktails...oh my gha. The Billy Joe was solid. The Svetlana was crazy. I NEVER would have thought to put those flavors together but...wow. You MUST try one.   The service....well...I'm really disappointed that a restaurant of this caliber would have service that rivaled a mediocre Denny's. Especially given that it was not very crowded in there at all. Our drink order was taken promptly but took forever to get to the table. The apps (ordered when we got the drinks) came out in a reasonable amount of time. Then....we finished the apps...and our drinks....and waited....and waited....and never saw our waitress....and we waited...and waited. Then the when table next to us (who arrived way after us) received their entree's (after they got drinks and finished their apps) I grabbed that waiter and asked if he would take our order. Seriously? Sigh. We were pretty much ignored from that point on. To top it off, when we got the check, they ran my credit card on a different tables check. One that was MUCH more than ours.   ALL this being said, I would go back. But I would order everything the first time I saw my server. Just to be safe. LOL!",

    "text": "I came here last night because I was super curious about the place, and I really wanted some oysters. It's a small place and I'm sure it can get filled very quickly, but for a Sunday night after 9PM, there weren't many people. (In hindsight, I realize this is probably because most people were watching fireworks.) I sat at the bar, since it was just me. I was waited on by two of the waitstaff, a guy and girl, both very friendly and helpful.  I started off with a drink, Billie Joe, because I wanted something with gin. This was smooth as hell for a gin drink. If ordering oysters, you are required to order by 6. Kind of odd, but I suppose if you're getting oysters, you aren't going to get 1 or 2 at a time. They come with 2 sauces, which other reviews mentioned. They were tasty but I could have done without them. To be honest, I preferred the lemon wedged squeezed onto the oysters, and maybe some vinegar. Keep it simple.  After the oysters, I tried another drink, Mavis. To me, this was a new take on a Manhattan. To the bartender, who was awesome, it was his take on a tiki drink that wasn't cloyingly sweet. It was a very light, almost kind of summery, Manhattan. Definitely a winner. I also ordered a couple pieces of the applejack nigeri. It's very, very delicate in flavor, but good. This would be a good introductory fish to the world of nigeri/sashimi. It's not overtly fishy or briny.  It is a bit pricey. It's not a place I would/could come to all the time, but I definitely will return again. I've got to try the rest of the killer cocktails, as well as some of the apps/tapas they have on their regular menu.",

Service was really nice but let's get to the important stuff, the food :)  Shoshito peppers, cauliflower and pistachios - nice flavors on the peppers but not as well seasoned as their other plates. Amberjack crudo - delicious!  Fresh and tasty.  It was so good, we had to order 2 plates. Oysters Rockefeller with foie gras - by far the best thing we ordered.  Foie was subtle and not overwhelming so you can taste the oyster.  Lots of crispy bread crumbs on top. Yum! Beef carpaccio - underwhelming.  Not salted well enough, beef was sliced too thick and the nori Parmesan chips were not savory enough to carry the beef and mixed greens. Spicy tuna with waffle fries - perfect!  Really hit the spot.  The fries were a nice crispiness and worked really well with the tuna.  Definitely eat this one again. Salmon poke and beets with sweet potato chips - another home run.  Salmon and veggies were perfectly diced.  Loved it. Fried calamari - another winner.  It's crispy, tasty, slightly spicy with nice picked pepper slices on top. Miso Honey ice cream - a very rich, thick ice cream that's really interesting in a good way.  honey is the predominant flavor and miso is in there but if I didn't know there was miso in there, I probably couldn't pinpoint the flavor.  Like it said, interesting in a good way.  We had a great meal here and will be back soon.",

    "text": "We have been wanting to come here for a while.  i started following them on Instagram, and their food looked amazing.  Overall this place was good, but they could improve in some areas.  The server we had was not the best.  She was nice, but she did not really sell or describe the dishes well when we asked her about them.  She would also disappear for long periods of time.  Our drink glasses sat empty many times over the course of the evening.  The food was good, but nothing really knocked our socks off (except the deviled eggs and fried oyster, that was amazing).   I think they could have larger portions and some dishes could be more hardy for the price.  I get it that they are trying to be more creative and their plating is nice, but we just had to keep ordering dishes to get full.  We had four people at our table and some plates came with three items on it.  I think, if we have four people, make the dish for four.  Charge us more if you need to.  The place is cool looking and has a nice vibe.  Overall, we enjoyed ourselves.  Maybe next time we will enjoy it more if we get a better server that makes the experience more enjoyable.  We will give it another try, as they have a cool concept going.",

Also, I always give extra points to a joint that serves a whole grilled fish with crispy skin. The steak and potato chips were also top notch, served Japanese style with a great creamy sauce that was light but packed full of flavor. Will go again!",

The ambiance is simple but trendy and the kitchen is open- next time I go I'll request to sit at the bar where you can watch them cook.  Really great daily selection board- lots of options.  This is a great place for sharing- tapas style.  Stand out dishes were the sashimi combo (especially the most insane scallop sashimi I've ever had), the crab hush puppies, the calamari, and the kimchi fried rice with pork belly.  The ingredients were fresh and inspired.  Lots of Japanese influences in the dishes and drinks.  Will be going back to try the rest of the menu.",

    "text": "Came in last night at around 9pm. They greeted us and asked if we had a reservation and we didn't, but they sat us anyway. We were a party of 6. There were two tables sat and two people at the bar in the whole restaurant. Anyway, my sisters had been here previously and had the $1 oysters so we were expecting to get a bunch of those. Our server was a lady and we didn't quite get her name. My friend asked for a certain beer and they didn't have it. My two sisters wanted the grapefruit beer but they only had one bottle left so they had to share it. There were no $1 oysters on the board so we were quite disappointed. We ended up getting an assortment of 18 oysters that were $2.50 each, you have to order by 6. they were really good oysters with pretty good sauces. My husband and I got the hot pot and the pork belly kimchi fried rice. The hot pot was pretty small for $21 and wasn't as good as I thought it was gonna be. They also had these bowls that stuck to the table so almost everyone of us, including our server ended up tipping it over. The kimchi fried rice was the highlight of our night. Really flavorful and the pork belly was nice and tender. Our table also ordered the deviled eggs, oyster Rockefeller, and chicken wings. The deviled eggs and oyster Rockefeller were pretty tasty. We were nearly done with everything when my sister asked our server when the chicken wings will be ready. She had a look on her face but quickly said it should be out any minute now. It came out about 10-15 minutes later confirming our suspicions that they forgot. Chicken wings finally came out and I grabbed one to split with my husband, they were whole chicken wings. It was pretty bloody so I told them to check all the wings and 2 out of 4 was bloody so we told our server. She said that that's how it is and that it's safe to eat. It was too red for us so we ended up just not eating it. With all that said, we don't think we'll be coming back anytime soon. I really wanted to love the place because of all the great reviews and hype but I think it fell a little short on both food and service. With those prices I wanted it to be a stellar experience and it was just ok.",

How shocked was I that this new venue with a great libations menu would blow my socks off! Known for their seafood, with touches of different cultures such as Japanese, Korean, American, and many more this place is a must for a great bite that's also open late. My favorite dish is known as the amberjack crudo. I could eat two orders on my own. This is a wild Japanese yellowtail topped with an orange jalapeno ponzu salsa. This dish makes my mouth water just writing about it. Their spicy tuna tartare is served fresh to order and accompanied busy house made waffle fries. At first I was skeptical of a French fry as a tartare accompany but this hit the spot and gave a perfect mixture of salt, freshness and an impact of flavors. Make sure to check this place out you will not regret it!",

The soft shell crab was the best I've ever had, and the scallop sashimi was incredibly buttery and tender. As the mother of a 2 month old, we don't get many nights out (this was the first since she was born!), but we plan on coming back here.

Other Mama Service:  Our server was on point throughout our dinner.  Even after the dinner rush came and the restaurant was packed wall to wall, the service didn't waiver and the food came out timely.  Multiple friendly servers kept the drinks fresh and the table clear.  Other Mama Cuisine All Stars:  We had a group of 8 at dinner, and I sampled many dishes via family style.  These brought me to a happy place. Deviled Eggs, Fried Oyster:  I love both and this was a delicious collaboration.  Kimchi Fried Rice, Pork Belly, Farm Egg:  Tasty af and complimented any main dish well.  I had the Prime NY Steak with the waffle fries and the lovely Miso Hollandaise.  That is what really brought this home.  All the Sashimi and Nigiri combos I tried were fresh and high quality.  The grilled fish was a hit for me as well.  Other Mama Ambiance:  There's a bar and counter seating as well as table with a light wood and neutral color theme going on.  The red border paint theme makes for a clean look.  The lighting is dim to give a date night vibe and works in any other dining session as well.  Their raw bar and and oysters rotating selection is fantastic.  The fusion dishes are creative and all the ingredients are great quality with excellent execution in preparation and cooking.  This is a great restaurant you can visit multiple times and have a wonderful different experience each visit.  Yes, this means I'll be hanging with my Other Mama soon, enjoy! =)",

The seasonal drink \"Heather\" is probably one of my all time best drinks in my life. Excellently crafted!  We had the skipjack crudo (excellent), the oysters (super fresh and sweet), the hushpuppies (full of crab), the salmon poke (omg those sweet potato chips), and the Japanese fried chicken (I could live off of this). Everything was well thought out and paired well.  I wish we lived here so we could come check out the specials all the time.  Tips: Sunday and Monday have $2 oysters. Order by the half dozen. You can have up to 1 six per person. Happy hour is 5-6 daily.",

    "text": "This was my third time at Other Mama. Third time was NOT a charm. Other Mama conveys a sense of 'busyness', it indeed is a room with a low ceiling and dark walls. I arrived before the others in my party. Yes, indeed I had a reservation. As I glimpsed around I noticed five available tables, as well as available bar space.  I was 'greeted my a female, who apparently requires etiquette lessons and some additional experience in communication.  I inform her I made a previous reservation (she never inquired about the name or how many). A few happenings and horrendous communication transpired for fifteen minutes.  Eventually her response was, we are 'slammed' this evening and motions to a seat at the door/slash 'hostess area', informs me I may sit there and she will bring me a drink.  I glimpse around the room, which is the size of a basement and still see five empty tables (in addition with the empty seating at the bar).  I provided her with an unpleasant tone along with a short and curt reply.  Thinking, one would catch on and have a manager come speak with me- no.  Now, she motions at one of those empty tables,  tells me you sit there then.  I was more than put off at this point.  My fault for not leaving.  The other two in my party arrive, and another server appears. We order drinks, five appetizers, then a bottle of wine (there are three of us). We notice the halibut on the board.  All decide we would like that as our entrees and ordered. Yes, we were still hungry as plates are small portions.   A decent amount of time has transpired after ordering the halibut (should've had the halibut at this point). Our party watches other diners who were seated well after us receive their food and finish entire meals.  Forty five minutes have gone by since ordering the halibut.  I will refrain from my initial thought of what these three halibut dishes appeared to look like.  I will post a picture after writing this. If the objective of Other Mama is to cultivate a clientele they sorely missed the mark.",

Every time I come here, I question why I don't visit more often. Probably because my budget won't allow me to, but this place is worth every penny.  Normally, when I find something I like, I get that every time I return.  Other Mama is one of the few places where I always try something new.  The specials board is like shooting fish in a barrel. You cannot go wrong.  If you made me tell you what to order, what I cannot miss, I'd tell you that you're crazy if you don't order that amberjack crudo.  There's nothing else like it.  Heck, just go ahead and order everything off the raw bar you can fit in your mouth.  So good.    On my quest to eat my way through Las Vegas, I keep returning here because Other Mama is just that special.",

Made a reservation for 8pm but plenty of open tables and seats at bar when i arrived. Started with the West Coast oysters on their specials board. There were 3 kinds from west but i can't remember the names of any of them. All 3 were big & fat(in a good way) and easily the freshest oysters i've had off strip in the last 18 months. Served with a tangy cocktail sauce and an excellent vinaigrette. Delicious! 10 out 10. Whitefish carpaccio - another 10 outta 10. French toast w/ caviar. Gdamn is that dish amazing! 11 out of 10. pork belly, guess what, AMAZING! kimchi fried rice, eh, had better. Didn't embellish the cocktail or wine list but did get a \"house soda which was a Shirly Temple but with blueberries. If it was any sorta representation of how the cocktails are going on here i seriously fucked up by not drinking last night. Kicking myself for not visiting sooner",

    "text": "Rare to dine out on weekdays, particularly a lengthy Tasting Menu beginning at 6:30pm, it was largely out of a feeling of obligation for panning Panevino when a Pharmaceutical Representative suggested it that dinner was sat down to with six strangers on Monday night in the Private Dining Room at Other Mama.  Still a popular destination for locals as well as visitors, even a night when many Las Vegas eateries remain dark finding the dining room more than fifty percent full, it was immediately upon arrival that the same young server present during a similar event in December led guests to the comfortable room adjacent the well-stocked Bar, a menu designed for varied tastes and experiences including one pregnant woman presented and confirmed by the host.  Styled as a medical case review held behind closed doors, no powerpoints but plenty of \"business\" talk taking place in between bites,  it was with most declining alcohol for various reasons that one of Other Mama's  Kiki Cocktails was selected to sip throughout the evening, its creamy base and up-front sweetness doing well in balancing the spiciness of items including a variety of Peppers such as Chef Krohmer's Hush Puppies stuffed with Crab as well as Jalapenos with a sidecar of Remoulade  Veering away from Shellfish compared to past visits, the reason for this decision unknown but potentially at the discretion of those in charge as the primary speaker appeared quite picky, it was as guests worked through steamed Edamame lightly accented by Citrus that course two was presented, the piquant Ceviche surprisingly well-received by most while all including the well-traveled were impressed by the crispiness of Other Mama's Tempura applied to sliced Mushrooms.  Offered more as a progression of small plates than \"courses,\" two long plates of Amberjack in Ponzu again highlighting the quality of Chef Krohmer's sourcing, it was in follow-up to this that pounded Chicken thighs in thick Batter had guests swearing off The Colonel forever though most did not find any comfort in blistered Shishito Peppers presented with a Russian Roulette warning that \"one out of every five or six is really spicy.\"  Continuing the string of complex spicing with Grilled Shrimp and Other Mama's famous Kimchi fried Rice, the former a bit overcooked but otherwise a good balance of char, sweetness and heat while the Rice was expectedly hit n' miss amongst a largely Latin American audience, it was following Pork Belly that all found under-seasoned that savories wrapped, the Steaks expectedly crowd-pleasing while more Chicken was met with a mixed response, all finding the crispy-skinned Bird itself delicious but many turned off by the aggressively flavored Sauce beneath, though those familiar with Mole or Pipian were delighted.  FOUR STARS:  More difficult to rate than many meals, an inability to self-select items and a server's insistence on adhering to the set Menu right up to the point guests were told Honey-Miso Ice Cream had been \"thrown out\" combined with a crowd who'd have been happy at Bonefish Grill equally at fault, the fact that both Pork Belly and Shrimp were flawed makes one wonder if Other Mama has slipped from prior or if this was just a matter of an \"off night\" compared to usual excellence.",

We still did order from the happy hour menu though. The server explained to us in great detail what was in each of the tapas that we were wanting to try. I think her name was Amber, but she was very helpful and also friendly.  With her recommendations included, we ordered spicy tuna tartar with waffle fries, octopus ceviche with sweet potato, Rhode Island calamari, spicy chicken wings, and the hush puppies. They were all small dishes, and it felt like there was more food than what it looked like.  My favorite was the octopus ceviche. The octopus ceviche had a punch of spice in every bite from the habanero. The sweet potato chips that came with the ceviche gave the tapas a crunchy texture and a slight sweet taste. It was a very well balanced plate. I honestly could not stop eating it!! All-in-all I really enjoyed the experience here. It is a little pricey, but it's definitely worth the distance and time to go and eat during their happy hour!",

I came here on a late night with my favorite person and the experience was fantastic.   Walked in and immediately had a flashback to the time I was at Yonaka. No Japanese patron found and place was packed with haole. Usually that's not a good sign for me but I always give the benefit of the doubt. First thing I noticed was how smoky the place was. There seems to be no ventilation of any sort but surprisingly, no one seemed bothered by it.  Atmosphere is  dark and intimate, perfect for the dinner occasion I was at.   Started out with some oysters which are part of the special. They were fresh and plump. My favorite has to be their little skookum oysters which were really sweet and fresh.   Grilled branzino with sweet potato. Holy moly. Grilled and seasoned perfectly. Fish was boneless and was grilled with lemons and bunch of different herbs.   Waffle fries.

It was a creamy aeoli sauce with some tangyness and was perfect with their crispy waffle fries.  *From here, I was a little intoxicated and don't remember the exact name of each dish  Also tried their spicy salmon roll with lemon and caviar. At first, I thought slices of lemon they had in between each roll was just for a presentation but I ate it with the rolls and wow. Flavor parade.  I guess it is good to be intoxicated while trying something new because you get to be adventurous. Lesson learned.  Steamed mussels in a pot. It was a recommended dish but turned out to be ok. Mussels were small and nothing mind blowing.   Fantastic flavorful seafood dish heaven with impeccable service. I hope to be back soon.",

Next time anyone reading this is in Las Vegas (and for local folk!), pop the extra Lyft/Cab Fare to visit this place waaayyyy off the strip.  Absolutely exquisite fresh raw oysters, sashimi, wagyu beef.  The garlic shrimp is to die for.  And the cocktails!  Lovely balance, all house-made syrups and infusions.  Ask Cooper to mix for you.  IMHO, Murray would be pleased.  Footnote:  OMG.  They have a miso-honey ice cream here that's especially with a drizzle of Averna.  Holy Taste-Gasms, Batman!",

There were two in a order. The grilled octopus was one of my favorite dishes . It had the perfect char  and was a big piece . I would definitely go back here, the service was greatl. We went for the 5:00pm -6pm happy hour and the menu had a few items with a few dollars off and beers were 6bucks .",

The tuna tartar with the waffle fries are insanely good. I don't eat tuna, but I did try a bite and was addicted.   We've been to the happy hour around 5pm I think, and order a bunch of things to share and get drinks.  It's a fun little spot in a strip mall area.   Make sure you HAVE RESERVATIONS. Before it was dead when we went so the second time we felt we didn't have to make one. We got there and there was one table seated. They sat us at a 4 top with hard wood chairs... and we politely asked the man at the front if we could sit at the table with the cushioned seats. He said \"NO, those are reserved\" in a very ill-mannered way. Not sure what his deal was ... heavier set guy, maybe 5'10\" to 6\", dark hair.. think he was the manager perhaps. Not a very good one. He's the reason I'm giving this place 3 stars.  We were there for Exactly 1 hour. And they sat one other table while we were there.   The reason we requested a softer seat, is because one of us is 80 years old, the other has Parkinson's which causes major leg and joint pain, and myself with a lower back injury. So we sat there and endured the really beautiful, yet hard wood seats.  Gosh that guy was such an ass... he could've been a lot nicer about it, but decided to just dismiss us. Which I wonder why that is?!  Maybe we're not the type of people he wanted in his restaurant?  Or he was having a bad day?  Not sure ... but 15 minutes into our dinner he's laughing and joking, and shaking hands of other patrons sitting at the bar. And then again with another guy who was leaving from the back. His demeanor completely changed. when you manage or own a restaurant, you treat everyone the same. Respectfully and nicely. There's a giant stick up this dudes butt. Really needs to get over himself. Will I ever go back?  Nahhh, there are plenty of other restaurants with better service and food. Sad that his staff are affected by his actions and lose out on having busier nights. Because I will never recommend this place to anyone.  Hopefully he gets his act together and learns how to treat people.   Oh and did I mention NOT one single group sat at the table we requested???  Yup!  Nobody. We also walked to another business a few doors down and about 30 minutes later went back to the car and I popped my head in just to see. That table was still empty. Get OVER yourself dude. You will demolish this business and make it go under.",

    "text": "If the wait for Palace Station Oyster Bar is too long, come here!! Probably one of the few local restaurants that creates their own specialty every day.   After hiking box canyon, a good cheat meal was what my friends and I were looking for. Found the amazing reviews on Yelp and although it mentioned they are usually busy, we took our chances on a Sunday evening.  The restaurant itself was cute and simple. The tables were set up with glasses and silverware ready for the guests and chalk boards stating all the specials of the day (which was a lot). There was also a bar that you could sit in if you preferred. :)  Service was what kind of ruined the experience. We were served by Santina (they don't have name tags so we just checked the receipt). From the start, her service was already questionable because she was really short with us and it was not busy at all. As a server before, we figured she was just having a bad day. Apparently not the case because we noticed how friendly she was with other guests. When she was dropping off our check with the credit card, she did not even bother to say anything but a quick 'Thank You' and walked away. But thankfully, other servers there, especially the one who ran our food (she has facial piercings) were super friendly and talked to us about the types of oysters and the story of the restaurant.   The food was of course amazing!! We ordered the Yuzu wings, kimchi fried rice with pork belly, deviled eggs and waffle fries to share. Oh and 3 dozens of various Washington oysters that tasted so fresh!! Prices were completely reasonable for the quality of the food. Thanks Yelpers for the amazing reviews that helped me find this!!",

You eat all this raw, natural stuff... \" announces my SoCal poker bud.  \"Oh crap\" I mutter.  \"I'm sorry\" says my Midwest poker bud.   \"Don't be, I perform so much better when I make love\" he proudly announces.  \"That's it, we're curing your raw foodism if only to stop you saying 'make love' ever again\" I say, shaking my head as my Midwest poker bud shudders.  Enter Other Mama.  A cross between Japanese and Mediterranean food that offers a good selection of dirt cheap ($1 - $2) oysters all day and a very tasty selection of near raw dishes.  A rare steak counts right?  To start, a selection of 4-6 oysters daily with a choice of multiple sauces.  The oysters all  fresh.  The Wasabi cocktail sauce (a take on the classic horseradish supercharged cocktail sauce) a great pairing.  Raw fish on your mind?  Standouts include a take on ahi poke with roasted beets and avocado (dressed with olive oil, the roasted beets add a pronounced sweetness that oddly works),  a whitefish ceviche (gentle acidity with bright flavors of herbaceous cilantro and  fresh chili taste of habanero).  Both served with intentionally overcooked sweet potato crisps.  The bitterness adds complexity.  Craving beef?  The grass fed beef carpaccio is very good.  Simply seasoned with salt, pepper and olive oil.  The characteristic, mineral taste of the grass fed beef and it's umame finish is made even stronger when eaten on a parm and nori crisp.  The grilled prime rib with miso infused hollandaise, good eats.  Only a hint of fermented flavor but umame supercharged.  A mild spicy heat ties the dish together.  Be sure to check the specials board.  On one occasion, octopus carpaccio, live surf clams, and uni on French toast.  Fun to try and all great in flavor.  Friendly off Strip service that can be haphazard at times (missing utensils when food is served).  All good as problems are quickly corrected.  Interesting cocktail program.  Off Strip markups.  6+ visits since they opened.  Zero check-ins.  Yes I was trying to keep this a secret.  All said, highly recommended.",

Now on to the food, my boyfriend and I thought it would be best to order a couple dishes to share. We started off with ceviche which had octopus, shrimp, white fish, and habanero ($8), and also the spicy tuna tartare with waffle fries ($9). These two dishes were light, but flavorful. Then for the main course we ordered the American Kobe ($30) and broiled garlic shrimp ($17). The Kobe beef was my favorite because of the sauce, but both dishes had lots of flavor in them.

Branzino was cooked to perfection and served deboned. Paired well with the Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay. The amberjack crudo was an interesting variation on standard sashimi.

The waffle fries are almost worth ordering on its own and will go well with anything.  I guess to help narrow down some choices, you can probably skip on the ceviche, it was good but not memorable.  Oysters were good, loading up on the dollar one is probably your best best since the others weren't too distinctive and sweet.",

The moment we walked into the door, we were greet by a really nice young lady who greeted us to the table. She explained the menu and the daily specials. The specials were kind of far away for where we were sitting so we took a picture so we could go over it in our seats. Everything on the menu looked so good so it was kind of hard deciding what we wanted!  We opted for all three oysters they had at the time. The prices for all three differed by maybe 50 cents so we wanted four of everything. All I remember is that the $2 oysters being too salty for our tastes. So after tasting all of them, we decided to get three more each of the other two that we had liked. We love oysters!!  For the main dish, the boyfriend got kimchi fried rice and I had gotten the steak with miso hollandaise sauce. For being a Korean person, I am usually picky with the kimci fried rice but I have got to say, it did taste really yummy!! There were even two slices of pork belly in it which was different but I loved it! Also, the waitress had said she had actually made the kimchi herself which I thought was really awesome. Home made kimchi for the restaurant! The steak I had gotten came with the miso hollandaise sauce and it was sooooooooooooo good! I was literally licking the sauce off of the plate due to the deliciousness. It had also come with thin waffle fries that also tasted really good with the sauce.   For dessert, we had gotten the pot de la creme and holy shiznits! it was sooooo good. I wanted to get another one but we decided we would get too fat haha It comes in a cute little jar that looks like its meant for candles. IT. WAS. SO. GOOD.  All in all, the atmosphere of the restaurant was also really cute. It reminded me of New Orleans or San Diego kinda, the ambience of it all. The chef/owner? of the restaurant had also come over to ask us how we were doing and asked us what we thought.  I would definitely come here again!!!! maybe 2-3 times a month, yeah! that often!",

    "text": "Don't worry Other Mama, I'm still coming back!  If I could rate this place just on oysters alone, I'd give it 5 stars. The drinks were created with creativity and personal attention. Mixoligist David Steven Stephen English told us all about the restaurant and the concept that Chef Krohmer was aiming for as he handcrafted our drinks for us. And while the chef and owner has succeeded in some areas, others will hopefully improve with time.  Let's talk about the good first - the Oysters. The daily oyster selection is posted on the specials board. The prices are extremely fair ($1, $1.50, $2) for different varieties. They were extremely crisp and fresh tasting and the sauces added a lot to the flavor as well, even though they aren't necessary. I had literally nothing bad to say to this point.  So why am I giving it three stars for now? I think primarily it was the fact that we had a lot of trouble finishing the Chirashi Bowl - and don't get me wrong, we weren't stuffed or anything, it just lacked in both flavor and texture. The rice was overly bland - it couldn't help carry the delicate flavor of fish because it lacked in vinegar flavor. Most of the fish was decent, but the Ikura was severely deflated and/or popped. They looked unattractive and didn't taste any better.  Another dish that disappointed for me was the Pork Belly Kimchi Fried Rice. Now I get that you're trying to tone the kimchi flavor down to please the taste buds not so familiar with traditional Korean kimchi (thus, Fusion?), but the flavor just wasn't there. I mean I'm Korean and I've had kimchi fried rice probably 50 times in my life, and I wouldn't have put the word kimchi in the title. If you're going to put Kimchi Fried Rice in the name, I feel like you're going to have to risk the kimchi being a little strong. That being said, the mushrooms were a great addition, and the pork belly was really nicely done, if only lacking a bit of flavor. I wasn't a fan of how they were sitting on the side, almost as if an aside to the dish. I think I'd love it if it was chopped in and cooked with the rice to push that texture throughout the dish. If they can incorporate a little stronger flavor in this dish, it'll be amazing.  For me, the Yuzu Chicken Wings were the most intriguing of the dishes I had. The light airy and yet crispy texture was unlike any that I've had to that point. However, as others have said before, I didn't taste Yuzu in the otherwise delicious sauce.  Another disappointment for us was the Japanese Cheesecake - others had described it as fluffy and delicate - but to me it was thick and dense. What it was, however, was not overly creamy or heavy, which I do appreciate. However, the texture didn't really come out the way I think was intended. I did enjoy the overall flavor of the dessert though.  I love the decor and the atmosphere that they've created here. The staff was friendly, and the Chef was kind enough to talk to us and allow us to voice our opinions on his food. I'm actually looking forward to trying more of his food in hopes that it can reverse some of the impressions we got during our first visit. That being said, we're already coming back for oysters, and probably all the time.",

We had oysters, ceviche, cherry salmon - awesomeness, octopus and a few other bites. Fantastic service. Cocktails were well balanced. Bartender English was great. Awesome vibe to the place. Everything fresh and made in house.   A little bit of a drive if you're a local not living in central Vegas.  But totally worth it.  Support small business. Support people doing things right and with passion.",

Inside is a well decorated modern beach house feel.  The cocktails on the cocktail menu were inventive and very tasty.  They had cute names too. There was a good selection of beer and wine as well. We tried a bunch of different oysters, and started with the ceviche as well.  We also tried the oyster foi rockerfeller, deviled eggs, yuzu chicken wings, 1/2 organic chicken, shishito peppers, chirashi, togarashi waffle fries, and the kimchi fried rice with pork belly.  The fish was super fresh and high quality, the oysters were fresh and tasty.  We chose the pickled habenero dipping sauce and the ponzu dipping sauce - both complemented the oysters very nicely without overpowering.  I absolutely loved the kimchi fried rice...it was very authentic tasting and came in a sizzling hot pot with an egg and porkbelly on top!  I will definitely going back for that dish alone...and the waffle fries too!  Everything we had was delicious...I'm definitely gonna be a regular here!",

Everything was delicious. Every dish had a distinct and focused taste, texture and composition. The food is innovative and creative.  The flavors are powerful, unique and on point. Ingredients are fresh and of high quality. I can't wait to try the other menu items. It's great to have access to such talent  without having to head to the Strip.  Now the issue with service. The restaurant wasn't that busy. The service has to match the caliber of the food (i.e. SoHo Japanese) otherwise it's an annoyance. The oysters arrived in a timely manner, but things just dragged on and on from there. The service team doesn't seem to work as a cohesive unit, nor are they particularly excited (or versed) about the menu. You pretty much will only get the attention of your server and not anyone else. The disjointed service created a disruptive dining experience. I will try sitting at the bar next to see if that works better.",

My server was named \"English\" (guessing that's an alias).  I think I heard another employee call him Dave, but I don't hear very well.  English did a great job and was talkative, likable, and friendly.  Like some other reviewers, I found many things on the menu I wanted to order...but I was all by my lonesome.  I really need to find some friends!  Here's what I tried:  ---  Oysters:  The oysters were fabulous.  They only had two choices, so I snarfed down three of each.  Great value. ---  Shrimp Mint:  I really liked the flavor combinations but they were a little light on the ikura.  I've had better ikura in North Dakota, so I'm not complaining here... ---  Pork Belly Kim Chi Fried Rice:  I was surprised by how much I liked this.  The kim chi flavor was quite muted.  The pork belly, mushrooms, and fried egg mixed very well with the fried rice.  Every bite tasted better than the previous bite.   ---  Pabst Blue Ribbon:  $3 a pint.  Yeah, buddy.  What's better than a cheap lager combined with great food??  NOT MUCH!!!  Seriously, you ought to try it sometime.  The pricing was very fair, but it sure would be easy to ring up a big tab here.  Another nit to pick - it wasn't hot outside, but it was plenty warm inside the restaurant.  Made me wonder what it's like when the temp is 115 or so.  I would be a regular here if I lived in Vegas.  Would recommend to all but the least adventurous of my friends.",

Chef Dan is a True genius he is a True master at his craft.   As for the menu it's so hard to choose I just want to order everything. Last time I was there I ask my server Jean if she could creat a tasting menu for our party of 8. I'm so glad I did she took care of the entire meal from oysters to sashimi to steak. We finished off with Japanes cheesecake and baileys ice cream. The service was amazing every dish was thoroughly and passionately explained.   I will be back again very soon. I highly recommend Trying this place out. When you have great service, skilled chefs and super fresh menu items. You have a winning  combination.",

Very comfortable atmosphere and a young, hip staff and clientele. Wine and liquor selection is a little thin but sufficient. Can't wait to return. Seriously, this place is really good.",

How often to you have this yin-yang of simple and complex food going on at such an affordable level.  I read a review on here from someone complaining that their mind wasn't blown.  Minds aren't meant to be blown here.  This is meant to be the kind of place that you can drop in and have an absolutely delicious meal of great food, done the right way, without someone attempting to blow your mind and take your money.  I've been there twice now and the folks making the food couldn't be more down to earth than these guys.  They know how to make great food, but they know even better how to make a great place that makes you want to say to your partner, \"Let's skip making dinner and go to Other Mama.\"   In a city that tries to overwhelm your senses at every turn, I, for one, am seriously excited to have a place where I can gather my thoughts and relax.",

But the second you walk inside the feel is vastly different from the surrounding area.  We had the oysters and calamari which were perfect.  Then for dinner the pork belly and muscles which were also great.  Excellent selection of beer and wine with a fully stocked bar and craft cocktail list.  The waitstaff was attentive and friendly with a casual dining atmosphere.  Everything about our experience was awesome.  Fantastic seafood restaurant!",

I was served the wrong beer but couldn't get anyone to come back to the table. So the anotherfriend took the beer back to the bar only to be asked if I was sure it was not correct. PBR and Blue Moon are nothing a like. Most the other items we tried marginal at best. Told the server about the shrimp,when she finally came back, and she just said oh and never asked why. So didn't bother to let her know about anything else.We traveled from Henderson in order to have great meal but wouldn't make that drive again.",

I've eaten in some amazing places, Chicago, New Orleans, San Francisco, San Diego, as well as around Las Vegas, all in the cause of finding great places to eat. Other Mama is my new Las Vegas favorite. The food here is as good as any of the finest restaurants in those other cities, if not better. Don't be put off by the strip mall location or the Ikea-on-a-bad-day furniture. The food is divine. Those hush puppies are something I'll need to revisit regularly (like a little ball of crab cake but way better than that sounds) and the chicken-fried lobster was the best lobster I've ever had. The steak was as good as the best steak I've ever had (which was at The Commander's Palace in New Orleans, except that was a filet and this was Kobe), and the desserts.... Well, even if you had the time to read my description, I don't have the words, and that's a first. The floured cheesecake was heavenly. And the ice cream.... OMG. And I don't ever like ice cream because it's never worth the calories. This one is. Miso and honey. (Pause for fond thoughts and memories of that little gem.) Anyway, check it out. It's the most laid-back, under-fan-fared fine dining place I've ever been to. And it's in my backyard! Forget Fleming's and Vintner's and T-bones. This is the place. Sigh. I don't even want to stop writing about it, it was that good.",

Unfortunately I gave up alcohol for lent so I wasn't able to try any drinks while I was there.  -oysters. meh. but we got the dollar oysters. you get what you paid for. -raw scallop sashimi style: buttery, creamy, deliciousness. LOVE -raw ...surf clam? I think?: sweet, fresh, also excellent. -amberjack crudo: perfectly balanced and beautifully executed. perfect. -beef carpaccio: also perfect. fresh beautiful beef, a little umami from the parm nori chips. perfection.  and THEN there's... -ceviches. had both. both sucked. we had a group of 10. we're all food lovers. only had one white fish ceviche and one mixed seafood ceviche. we had leftovers. they were super ungood. I am a terrible cook and I made better ceviche the first time I tried.  It almost made me angry. Even the sweet potato chips were not good. they were very crispy...but too crispy...as in it tasted a bit burnt. In fact all of our chips and waffle fries tasted a bit burnt. I guess it's a fine line between deliciously crispy and burnt but it was definitely leaning towards the latter. don't get me wrong, it wasn't obviously burnt. it just had that bitter aftertaste. -pbr seafood toban yaki. not terrible. but definitely not ordering it again. tasted like they made a sour seafood stew...and just straight poured pbr into it at the end. rather unpleasant. -prime ribeye miso hollandaise. sounds great doesn't it? I thought so, too. The meat was cooked perfectly. But the miso hollandaise was NOT happening. I almost wished the sauce was on the side so I can just have the meat on its own. -shrimp and jalapeno hush puppies. TERRIBLE. neither shrimp nor jalapenos could be tasted. mush inside. tasted like...mushy cornbread nuggets deep fried. actually, that probably would have been better.  fortunately not all cooked foods were terrible -yuzu chicken wing: not the BEST but most of us enjoyed it. I'd order it again -shishito peppers: well done -kimchi fried rice: not the best but solid. it'd probably be better if they chopped up the pork belly into smaller more edible pieces...and if the pork belly wasn't so overly fatty. I love a good fatty pork belly but ours was alllll fat.   ambiance is...home made hipster. not home made in a homey cozy way. but homemade like they should have hired an interior designer and they didn't and it looks off sort of way. but it's clean.  service. excellent. very very friendly staff  I guess technically if I average everything out, it should be 2.5 stars but they're excellent at what they do. I'm sure I'll end up revisiting this place often because they are EXCELLENT at what they're good at.",

    "text": "Actually astonished.  Walked in at 6:45 to a mostly empty restaurant. Place was essentially free. To be polite I asked the waitress if it was OK to sit at the sushi bar if I was getting a drink and an appetizer.  She said she would check.  Red flag.  Two employees later I was told it was too busy and all barstools  were reserved for a large party coming in. Keep in mind there were no barstools together.   I met with the bartender/manager who confirmed that there was no place for me to sit.  I told him I could have drinks and an appetizer and be out on time for the \"big crowd\" in 45 minutes.  I was told no. Then the bartender/manager put his hand out to shake mine.  What in the world happened to common sense, customer service and knowing how to run and keep the business? I don't rant much but when I do look out!  Bottom line - there are some really abstract idiots out there!  By the way - manager with the handshake David. Think he felt my presence as a professional women alone was a joke so I can't wait to call corporate.",

I finally got the chance to have dinner there and I will definitely be back again.   Drinks: We ordered the Billie Joe and Trixie. The Trixie was awesome, Jameson with honey syrup and candied ginger! The Billie joe was refreshing with gin and cucumber but didn't quite WOW me..   Dinner: We started off with the French toast cavier. Don't think I would order it again but definitely worth a try! Different from anything I've tried before. You have a combination of the saltiness from the cavier and the sweet syrupy French toast.   Blueproint raw oysters. $1 each. They were cold and delicious! Perfect!   Scallop sashimi was awesome. I'm a big fan of sashimi and this did not disappoint. Melts in your mouth!   Lastly, we got the mussels and waffle fries. I thought the portion was big enough for two. The mussels are big and meaty! The fries were good but I would have rathered some bread to soak up the sauce.   I can't wait to come back and try the oysters, Kauai shrimp and amberjack crudo. Thanks OtherMama for a great dinner!",

Odd location, in a strip center, but whatevs.  Crazy cocktail list.  I will say, I did try the Ingrid - vodka, triple sec, strawberry balsamic....it tasted better than it smelled.  The balsamic was a little over powering.  And also, the tiny, champagne-like glass - not good.  Drink doesn't look appetizing at all, and the glass makes it worse - I suggest a high ball glass and ice.  I switched to the their gin/basil cucumber cocktail - very refreshing and visually delicious.  We had the tuna tartare with waffle fries, genius and pretty filling- great portion for two.  The sashimi bowl - super fresh.  And the Amberjack sashimi - delish.  We also got a dozen, assorted oysters.  Great flavors.  The food is super fresh.  As if delivered right off the boat when we got there. Drinks are boozy - our favorite kind.  ;)  There was only one bartender, and not a full night, but he got the drinks out pretty timely - kudos to him!  Nice beer on draft assortment.  Atmosphere - great.  Shabby chic.  Casual.  Strip center parking.  I think the prices are reasonable because the food is so fresh.  Friendly servers.  Laid back staff and attire.  We will be back!",

Sat at the bar and enjoyed the Vera cocktail with some excellent Fanny Bay oysters, followed by the Pork Belly Kim Chee Fried Rice and a Sashimi Platter and a glass of crisp Sauvignon Blanc. A custom made espresso martini for dessert just sealed the deal. Shout out to 'English', the bartender, for his sheer enthusiasm and personable nature. Absolutely no complaints on the food. Fish was spankingly fresh.   Service was fast and personable.   Cocktails are fresh and innovative. Wines by the glass are limited in their selection but you'll find something you like. This local Spring Valley spot deserves to thrive.  I will return. I suggest you give it a try.",

The menu has different plates such as Amberjack Crudo with ponzu salsa and pork belly with Kim Chi fried rice served over wild mushrooms. Every plate I tried was amazing and had bold flavors. An incredible presentation and aroma throughout every dish. The mixology program is on the right path to being one of the best... Can't wait to try what else they come up with.",

The interior is really welcoming. on the darker, romantic side. It felt like something you would find in SF or NYC!  Once everyone showed up, we were seated to a corner table. The menu is a bunch of creative, tasty, family style plates. OK, with 16 people, this could have been a disaster, but our super helpful waitress saved the day by encouraging the \"tasting menu\" ($40/per person)  OK, I know, some of you may feel that $40 bucks is a bit high for an off strip little place, but I can assure you, it was AMAZING! I lost track but I would say they sent over 10+ courses of food for the table. Oysters, Ahi Tuna, Chicken Croquettes, steak, chicken, and on, and on. And everything was really tasty!!  Now the tasting menu is not the only choice, for sure! There were many affordable options on the menu, you could get out for much less...but miss out of trying a ton of tastiness. :-P  I am already planning my next visit!",

French toast was light and moist but held up to the creme fraise and caviar. A very well-balanced dish. Oysters are still incredibly fresh. 6 out of 6 oysters were certainly live. The yuzu salsa, which cones with the oystwrs, is the only sauce you need. Soft she'll crab was good, but not as good as everything else.   The house-made ice cream and sorbets are well worth the calories. I loved the Jameson & ginger sorbet. Pure genius.   Why don't I come here more often?!",

Very small place so either get there early or make reservations. We had a little bit of everything. Oyster sampler was fantastic. They let you mix-and-match. They have a specials board so be sure to check that out. We also had the Octopus Carpaccio, Shrimp and Jalapeno Hush Puppies, Asparagus Tempura, and French Toast with Caviar (I know....but it kinda worked). Make sure you try the \"Bessie\" cocktail and the \"Aunt Opal\" if you like things on the spicy side. Service was great and we didn't have to wait on anything. There were a few minor flaws such as the Hush Puppies being a little overdone and the Carpaccio needing just a pinch of salt but nothing to detract from the 5-Star rating. We will definitely be back!",

The restaurant and menu itself looks very hipster, like it belongs downtown.  Crowd was primarily young \"foodies\".  Great atmosphere and we got good service.   The Ribeye with miso hollandaise.. I swear we got a flat iron streak instead, which is fine, but I don't think I got ribeye as advertised.  The miso hollandaise was savory with the hint of miso flavor, not overpowering.  The meat had a perfect sear, nice char on the outside and cooked a perfect medium inside. My favorite: Octopus Carpaccio... The Octopus was so fresh and sliced perfectly and had that puffed up texture you can only get with a recently live octopus.  The sauce was a light chili and oil.. It was absolutely delicious!   Least favorite: Grass Fed beef carpaccio... Had these nori Parmesan crisps that did not go with the dish.. Besides that, the dish was warm.  I don't like my carpaccio warm. Must try: Ceviche.  Tender pieces of seafood marinated and paired with sweet potato chips which you think is an odd combo but went very very well together. Also, on the suggestion of the server, had a few selections of fresh oysters.. The Zen was a briny sea explosion in my mouth highlighted with a mignonette.   Docking a star because they did not have the Caviar and French toast which initially was the original reason I wanted to try this restaurant, and also while their cocktails were decent, they did not amaze me. Overall, a good solid restaurant that does not match its location or surroundings, however good food with a good atmosphere, a definite must try.  Will be back!",

The broth was incredibly good, and the whitefish and scallop had really taken on the flavor. The dish was small, but so perfect that I'd order it again - if it wasn't for all those other dishes I need to try! A chef in our group also had the Hot Pot, and loved it.   All 9 of us had a great experience. My son, a former chef, finished his dinner with a scoop of Miso Honey ice cream. The flavor was perfect, and I'm going to have this on my next visit.",

    "text": "Sit at the bar at Other Mama and you'll understand how passionate the folks are who run this newly opened restaurant in Spring Valley. You won't meet a friendlier group willing to tell their story. Led by Dan Krohmer, a chef who trained under Morimoto, their team is producing Strip-quality food and cocktails for off-Strip prices without cutting corners. Advertised as a raw bar, you'll find, among other things, oysters with impeccable scratch-made sauces and an amberjack crudo topped with a ponzu salsa. If you're a fan of chicken wings, their spicy yuzu wings will blow you away. A light, crispy southern fried exterior is a great contrast to the succulent meat underneath and each bite finishes with a restrained amount of heat. Always a sucker for pork, the pork belly kimchi fried rice was calling my name. Arriving piping hot, the bowl is full of large chunks of savory meat, spicy kimchi, rice and a fried egg topping it all. Even sorbets are made in house, with flavors changing regularly. Their strawberry red wine sorbet was a silky, sweet way to end a great meal. Their cocktails are equally as good. Their mixologist, David English, is doing some cool stuff with more house-made ingredients.  Calling restaurants \"chef-driven\" has become a cliche, but here it's the real deal. Other Mama is doing things the right way. Located in the same plaza as Zaytoon (a place I frequent regularly), this strip mall might turn into my home away from home.",

    "text": "I was initially interested in going to this place since I had oyster cravings, and saw the price deal for $1-$2/oyster from the other reviewers. I just got back from not having enough amazing oysters on the beaches of Nice, and wanted to fulfill my craving. The short version is: I think I came here possibly on a bad day? Sorta the tail end of their stocked items, hence not as fresh perhaps.    With some stellar, yet mixed reviews on other items, my original goal was to stuff my face with oysters only, but, you know, with all those options in your face, it's hard to walk away with JUST oysters.   Semi-Spoil Alert!  Oyster prices have gone up by 50 cents! Yeah, yeah, i know some of you don't give a crap about 50cents, but, for one that is super stoked with the solid number of $1 and $2, it is a change. Of course, this was bound to happen with increasing popularity and time.   Duck Island- $2   Fanny Bay - $2 Beau Soleil - $2.5 Kumamoto- $2.5  No $1 oysters were available on the day we went and my dream was shattered. We got 2 of each to try them all out.   My favorite was the Fanny Bay out of all of them, so I ordered two more. It wasn't as fresh as I had hoped. Granted, this is Las Vegas, and with transporting that stuff across the land of no seas, it was to be expected, but unfortunately neither mentally expected, nor noted by me.   Amberjack Crudo- 4 stars. This was delicious, and probably the highlight of our meal.   Caviar with French Toast-  1 star.  I read some review after having had it that the french toast was warm? Ours seemed like it had been refrigerated and taken out. It was on the special menu. And the fact that they erased it off the special menu after our order at 5:30 p.m. (30 minutes after opening) might have been a sign that we were having the \"last bit\" that they had left from earlier in the week. Our waiter told as that they \"ran out\" as he was erasing it off the board. I thought it was okay. Definitely not good enough for $19 for 6 pieces. I somehow just found a photo where this dish had 8 pieces, which makes me wonder...did our serving fall short due to them \"running out?\" Or did they actually reduce the pieces they give out. No es bueno, mi amigos. NO ES BUENO.  So, all this stuff and our bill came out to about $70 after tax and tip. And, we were half full.  My husband was in a haze of such disappointment with the meal, that he did the unbelievable. We hit up a another restaurant immediately after in attempts to ameliorate our disappointment, and when the bill came, he realized that he had left his credit card at \"Other Mother.\"   With our heads low, we had to make the drive back to go pick it up.   Perhaps the rave reviews of other yelpers definitely set me up for high expectations for this place. Service was great, with our waiter being super approachable, cool, and waters being full. I even had a nice chat with the chef/owner.  Great interior, open feel, and a nice cool spot that gives a twist with the restaurant name and staff from what one would expect in an Asian fusion restaurant.   Would I go back? Hmmmmm, I think I'm giving up on fresh oysters in Las Vegas for one, and, MAYBE I would go back for the Amberjack, but that's about it. IMHO, the prices are high for what I think it's worth. Oh, the sweet potato chips are definitely worth trying. $3 for a plate and it's a nice snack.",

Logical heads prevailed and our party of 4 was still able to sample quite a bit.  Oysters were mandatory and a great way to start the meal.  They featured 3 types (Fanny Bay, Bluepoint. Skookum) and while I could only tell which was which based on shell, they all went down the same way, deliciously.  The pickled peppers/habanero and wasabi cocktail sauces were my favorites.  Most spots only offer $1-$2 oysters for happy hour, but just like Lionel Richie, these guys are doing it \"All Night Long\", one of many reasons to be a repeat customer.     The \"Caviar & French Toast\" with the creme fraiche was a nice little curveball to the palette.  The toast's warm, buttery softness went nicely with the rest and we even got more of it just to finish the order.  Other standouts were the \"Grilled Shrimp Salad\" with its excellent dressing and soba noodles, and the \"White Fish Ceviche\", which I was selfishly eating straight out of the jar by the end.    A little piece of seafood heaven on the westside for sure.  I could envision myself overlooking the beach while eating their delectable ocean treats.  Luckily for everyone in Vegas, Other Mama is here, and hopefully will be for a long time.",

Friendly and professional staff plus a high-quality menu make Other Mama a success.  Start with the SHRIMP MINT, a mix of shrimp salad and mint wrapped in cucumber and topped with salmon roe. Move on to the not-actually-spicy SPICY TUNA with TOGARASHI WAFFLE FRIES for a fresh-savory combination you can assemble like nachos. Close out the night with the SPICY YUZU WINGS- sweet plus spicy, ask for them extra crispy to avoid the slight sogginess I encountered.  Pricing is on par with the quality served here- the above was just over $40. Cocktails have two pricing tiers, $9 and $16. Plan accordingly. I'll be back for the amberjack and oysters!  EDIT: Came back with the BF for the amberjack, oysters, asparagus tempura (seasonal!) and the shrimp mint dish (again). The amberjack is tasty, oysters have some fun mignonettes, and the shrimp dish is a must-order (obviously). The asparagus was simple but bomb, why don't more places feature it?!",

    "text": "We came in as a group for a bachelorette dinner for the tasting menu. We all left stuffed and completely not ready for a night of clubbing (a nap wouldn't been preferable).   Drinks- I tried the Billie Joe, a gin and cucumber concoction (very nice and surprisingly refreshing) and others tried the Penelope, a sake and pomegranate drink (an upgrade on the sweet girly drink). The bride to be got the drink pairing with the tasting menu -- it included sake (which she wouldn't share because it was apparently too tasty) and a glass each of a red (Malbec) and white (Pinot Grigio) that we're equally good.   Food-  -spicy tuna tartare with waffle fries: the fries were more like waffle chips, but man were they good. I ate way too many. Very tasty combo. Just the right amount of spicy! - ceviche with sweet potato chips: similar in presentation to the tartare, this was a fresh and less heavy alternative. This was probably the favorite for our table (for the entire dinner). - sashimi combination: surprisingly fresh! I'm spoiled by LA sushi, and this definitely stood up to my standards. Gave me an opportunity to try fish I don't normally get (like amberjack) - shishito, cauliflower and pistachio: we had a nut allergy so missed on the pistachios. I love roasted shishito peppers, so I enjoyed these, but they weren't particularly innovative like the rest of the menu.  - Rhode Island calamari: sweet calamari. Tasty on its own, but didn't fit with the rest of the tasting menu :( might be biased since this was one of the last fried appetizers brought out so we were a little tired of *fried* at this point. I, personally, would've liked it better with some spicy kick. - Blue crab hush puppies: I could eat crab for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, so I could be biased, but I loved these. I also ate an entire plate by myself. Once again, fried :( - deviled egg and fried oyster: I don't like deviled eggs and at this point I was taking a break from eating so I didn't try. The tables consensus was that they were ok. None of us are deviled egg people.  - seasonal tempura: it was just tempura. Good tempura, but not something that will bring me back to other mama on its own. Also....fried. - roasted cauliflower: Love. I've been thinking about this roasted cauliflower all week. I also think I ate the entire shared plate of this.... - prime NY steak and more waffle fries! : very tasty steak. Fit nicely with their waffle fry chips.  - whole grilled fish + sweet potatoes: this was different for me, but very moist and flavorful. I'd choose this over the steak again.  - kim chee fried rice: I normally love kim chee fried rice, but I it was a little heavy on onion for my taste.  I will definitely be coming back! Thank you for the wonderful dinner!",

    "text": "Am I the only one without a blown mind while eating at Other Mama? I suppose so. Perhaps I was expecting a lot from Other Mama due to the wonderful reviews, the high star ratings, and a head chef that trained under Morimoto. So yeah, I was expecting some out of this world, mind blowing, and unforgettable dishes ... but truth be told, I was quite disappointed.   My friend and I went in one night for dinner and sat at the bar. We chatted with David English a little about the restaurant and the menu. I started with the Mildred, which composed of bicardi, lime, and a strawberry-mint soda while my friend went with the Beryl, which was a mix of apricot buffalo trace, blood orange bitters, and yuzu tincture. Both drinks were priced at $9. Both were pretty good aside from the Beryl being a little bit too strong due to the whiskey but no problem! English has got it! He added more sugar to it to help dilute it and it helped!   We started off with half a dozen of oysters. They had three types of oysters on special that night: Fanny Bay, Bluepoint, and one other one that I can't seem to remember the name of. We chose to have two of each. And I LOVED them. I simply LOVE oysters and they were indeed VERY FRESH. On top of the freshness, the price point was to die for! Fanny Bays were $1.50 each. Bluepoints were $1.00 each. And the third one, the one with the most brine was $2.00 each. Where else can you get amazingly fresh oysters for this price in Las Vegas? Uh, no where. The taste of the Bluepoints were so fresh and crisp. The Fanny Bays were also a favorite with their slightly stronger flavor.  They pretty much have every type of condiment you would want with oysters ranging from their special house sauces to your traditional Tabasco bottle.    As for some main entrees, we ordered chirashi, spicy yuzu chicken wings, and pork belly kim chi fried rice.   Chirashi: I love sushi. And I love sushi rice. Our chirashi bowl came with bigeye ahi tuna, salmon, octopus, amberjack, shrimp ceviche, ikura, a type of white fish that I forgot the name to, and avocado. This dish made me realize that I really don't like amberjack. It turns chalky in your mouth as you chew on it and ... I kind of don't like that. The tuna had a strange texture, bouncy almost. The salmon, shrimp ceviche, white fish, and octopus were all really good. The ikura, however, was a bit disappointing. Half of the ikura looked popped to me.   Now, as for the sushi rice...it tasted like regular rice. Though, my personal preference, I like my sushi rice to have hints of vinegar because it helps balance flavors of raw fish. It was actually difficult for us to finish this. In the end of it all, the chirashi bowl was possibly the most disappointing dish we've had that night. We did talk to the chef about it and he stated that he liked his sushi rice to be on the more mild side. Therefore, he puts in less vinegar than the traditional recipe, which we understand. However, it is just not our cup of tea.   Spicy Yuzu Chicken Wings: The wings are done really well. The crispness of the wings were really light, which is a plus. However, the dish itself didn't really do much for me. Nothing really jumped out at me. The sauce that they used on top of it ... just seemed like a regular gochujang recipe.   Pork Belly Kimchi Fried Rice: It's comforting to know that the kimchi is made in house. I like how it was served in a hot/clay pot, which keeps the dish warm. It had huge chunks of pork belly with a nice sunny side egg right on top of the rice. The pork belly chunks were HUGE and you get a lot of it. However, I do believe if they cooked the pork belly along with the fried rice as a whole, the flavor would be remarkable. The kimchi tasted like Chinese preserved vegetables and the rest were quite mild in flavor. Once again, I can't say I enjoyed the dish due to how mild the flavors were. It just doesn't hit home.   We ended the night with the Japanese style cheesecake. Japanese cheesecake is airy, fluffy and light in flavor. It's typically very soft in texture. Other Mama's version threw us for a loop. The texture, the look, and the feel of my fork getting a piece of cheesecake all screamed NY style cheesecake. It was dense. However, it was LIGHT in flavor, but quite far from the airy and fluffiness that I desire.   Overall, Other Mama is fantastic for their oysters. Great price for great quality. But a lot of the other dishes were a miss for my taste buds. I'm sure the quality and the dishes are great .. just not for me. When I think Asian Fusion, I think traditional flavors with a twist. From the dishes that we have tried that night, the traditional tastes were absent, and therefore, the twists did not do much for us. But hey, it could be because my taste buds are weird. Who am I to say?",

Once you're inside, it is as if you are taken away from Las Vegas to some hippy yet modest restaurant in a small beach front town.    The staff was always very helpful and friendly.  We usually get a couple dozens of the $1 oysters and are always happy with what we get.  The tuna poke is something to definitely try.  The french toast and caviar was pretty delectable and something different.   We have had the surf clam and the scallops, and both were amazing.  We love this place and will continue to come back on a regular basis!",

    "text": "I like the idea of Asian fusion tapas and fusion fine dining. And other mama luckily did just that in a pretty innovative and tasteful way. Parking wasn't a hassle at all since the area is pretty much dead with the exception of a small bar and sushi restaurant near by.   Inside seating is pretty open as well and I've never seem to have problems being seating because of it being crowded. I ordered the oysters, Korean kimchi fried rice, mint cucumber rolls, tuna poke, live scallop, and the wings. For the most part I really enjoyed the cucumber mint roll, it was topped off with a little ikera, and had a really refreshing taste to it similar to a Vietnamese spring roll.   The kimchi fried rice was okay, but came off as slightly bland especially since I'm Korean and I'm used to eating this dish regularly. The wings also were mediocre to me and didn't seem to stand out, but as a warning they do have a bit of a spicy kick. The oysters are what made this place though for me. I've had oysters at San Francisco so fresh it lack any fishy taste what so ever and was smooth to eat.   This place comes a close second in how fresh their oysters were, and you get to try 3 of their sauces to accompany your sampler. And the best part was we got them for 1.50$ each! Idk if this was a regular price thing or part of their happy hour, but any time I can get fresh oysters for under 2$ i'll always take advantage of it. If you're looking for a new fusion fine dining tapas place to try or grab some oysters by the bar, I'd suggest other mama.",

I like other mama it's different, it's trendy, it has a range of creative appetizers from their amberjack crudo to the Spicy tuna tartar with waffle fries. From sashimi & Fresh oysters to fried fish chicken wings or a steak they appear to have a good menu. I don't remember seeing a big range of different carbs. So I tend to have to order a good amount in order to fill me up so it can get a bit pricey but not everyone eats like I do ! They have happy hour everyday from 5-6. Cool little spot!",

Food: oysters - we ordered 3 of each of the ones they had and our fav was the bald point (i think i remembered that right)  Shishito peppers, cauliflower, pistachios - great flavor and the cauliflower was amazing, wish there had been more.  Ceviche - My personal favorite! Had great flavor and brightness. Loved it with the chips for texture. Ugh, so good.  Japanese fried chicken - little fried pieces of heaven. It was dark meat so it had a lot of flavor and the seasoning in the outside was really good.  Kim chi fried rice - my least favorite. I thought it lacked flavor. It had mushrooms in it that were to die for, but not enough in there to make me like it.  French toast, caviar - my first time tasting caviar and it was very interesting on the custard like toast. I'm glad I tried it, but I won't order it again.   I really enjoyed and can't wait to return.",

It's worth taking a rather long drive from the Strip to come here and tickle your taste buds.  Anyway, my dining companion and I ordered a bunch of stuff to share and we were not disappointed.  FRESH OYSTERS: calm cove, bald point, nanoose bay and shooting point: SUBLIME AMBERJACK CRUDO: off the hook MIXED SEAFOOD CEVICHE: feels like you are in South America.  KIMCHI FRIED RICE: makes you feel you are in Seoul.  ROASTED OCTOPUS: Mon Dieu!!!! CRAB TOSTADA: get out of here! So why only 4 Stars? Service left a little to be desired.   Its just a little bit slow and a little stand offish! Yes you are very popular. But cool it. Friendly and welcoming service is always part of the experience.  So please work on that. Otherwise I would have given you 5 stars.",

    "text": "Such a quirky, esoteric, and wonderful dining secret! This was my 4th visit, and this time I had the luxury to dine acapella (by mysrlf).  I decided to focus on flavors, presentation, and service. OK... service was phenominal! I got to sit at the far end of the sushi bar overlooking the kitchen (a treat)! Several servers chatted with me even though they weren't mine. Wow! I watched prep, plating, and service. Chef Han was 3' from me doing his magic (see pic).  The menu is modest but there were 16 daily specials, so if you come regularly, you won't get bored. I had:  1. Ceviche w. Octopus, Shrimp, White Fish (fluke aka East coast summer flounder, Habanero. It was a complex yet yummy jumble of flavors.  2. Salmon Sashimi salad: tender and firm with a sweet aeoli (unnecessary), pepitos, and a lovely fresh baby green salad topper.  3. Salmon (Scotland) sashimi: buttery tender perfection  4. Amberjack Sashimi: firm and subtle, rich fatty mouth feel.  5. Ocean Trout Sashimi: (Australia): melty, slight oil on the pallette , beautiful touch of brine, divine  6. Blue Crab Tostadas (3): lots of dense, complex, rich palette-pleasers... including a hint of tongue-tingling cayenne.  Best to make reservations but walkins may be ok mud-week or early weekend eves. Also the space is smallish, so the noise level is moderate to rambunctious. Plenty of parking in the Durango/Flamingo Westside strip mall.  I love this place!",

From every bite of fresh sashimi, tender pork belly, upto the last oozing drop of ice cream.  We had the following::::::  -Sashimi Combination  -Salmon Poke with Waffle Fries -Mixed Seafood Ceviche with Sweet Potato Chips -Deviled Eggs with Fried Oyster -Rhode Island Calamari with miso Hollandaise & Pickled Pepper -Oyster Rockefeller with Foie Gra  butter -Griller Pork Belly w/ Charred Cabbage & Onion Vinaigrette -Kimchi Fried Rice / Jidori Egg -Double Ranch a prime New York Strsk with Miso Hollandaise & Waffle Fries  Ughhhh we were all stuffed but how can you say no to the dessert.  Japanese Cheese Cake, Miso Honey Ice Cream that stands out the most for me among the other flavors as it tastes like Salted Caramel. Coffee Jelly with  Vanilla Ice Cream, Apple Empanada, Chocolate parfait with strawberry.   Oh did I mention that they have a wide variety of cocktails too?!  I honestly haven't been there before until last night and I can say it is one of the hidden gems I found in Vegas. I am certain that my girlfriends and I would all agree that it will definitely not be our last time to visit the place so if you come to Other Mama, feel free to say hi to me coz definitely you'll be seeing me there often.",

We also got the garlic chip salmon carpaccio which we had to add some lemon squeeze to get the right amount of sour for our taste. The highlight of our food adventure here was the amberjack crudo with ponzu. It was delicious. They do put alot of cilantro on it but we love cilantro. The service here is ok. We read reviews about the bartender not being friendly. Well for our experience, he wasn't very social. We did sit at the bar and expected orders taken from a bartender, but it was all done from a waitress. I'm fine with that but if you sit at a bar, I expect some interaction with the bartender.",

I ordered the tuna tar tar and the salmon poki and I'm not even kidding the sizing of the portion they gave me in the container was little over one table spoon . I could eat in ONE spoonful. I was very disappointed especially because I was looking forward to eating it so much. I wish I had more considering I was there a couple days prior and ordered it as a dine in and was served nearly double what they gave in the to go container. Thank you for considering my review in the portion sizing for pick up order for your future customers.",

Ultimately from a culinary perspective, everything was pretty spot on. Our server left a little to be desired, she was stale and slightly inattentive. Also as first time diners of Other Mama (we let her know when we first sat down) she could have provided a little more direction on what were the \"stars\" of the menu but, again, the food we ordered we were pretty happy with from a taste perspective.  When the bill came I was a little surprised; for $120+ tip for a couple I left scratching my head and still a little hungry. The small plate items are meager for the price, the service was more miss than hit and the ambiance is something that was a little beneath what they seem to be targeting for a per person spend range. I may go back for a happy hour but for their menu price point I don't think it's worth making the drive; there are overpriced Strip restaurants that you can get an equal dining experience at and probably spend a touch less at.   Oh. And a kudos to the Expo/food runner. He was engaging, knowledgeable and had a personality. Probably the lone positive from the service component of our meal.",

Decor is old fashioned with mismatched items, like an antique store. A few modern pieces with some rustic items that people could beleive have a cool story behind it.   We were seated and greeted by..well everyone! Our table was touched by pretty much everyone at one point or another. Why is thier service so great, simple..they work as a team and its very clear.   Food...ok. Delicious! Loved everything we had. Shishito peppers. Grilled pork belly. Spicy tuna tartare (waffle fries are bomb). Live scallop sashimi.

I think this place is considered \"trendy\" but I will say it's been consistent over the past couple years and until that changes - I'm a fan. I ordered sushi/nigiri/oysters every time! I don't order the steak and fries but someone at my table usually does (and I'm really happy about it) and I steal a fry...or 10. So good!",

    "text": "On our way home from Las Vegas, my boyfriend and I stopped at Other Mama for Happy Hour -- available daily from 5pm-6pm and 10pm-11pm. Interesting hours, considering they're only open from 5pm-11pm... Apparently, though, last call is 15 minutes before Happy Hour ends. Quite restrictive...   From the Yelp pictures (and Yelp's categorization of Other Mama as a \"Sushi Bar\"), we expected to see a sushi menu. At the very least, we thought we'd find the blue crab-caviar-asparagus hand roll that's being used as Other Mama's main picture on Yelp.   But nope! Imagine our surprise when the server dropped the truth on us -- there is no sushi rice made here at all. Thus, no nigiri. No hand rolls or cut rolls. Only fresh sashimi and crudo dishes, such as fluke, ocean trout, amberjack and snapper.   At its core, Other Mama is a raw bar. In addition to sashimi, the place specializes in oysters, artfully prepared seafood dishes, and a handful of hot appetizers. The pictures on the Yelp page are simply outdated. The menu has undergone a massive overhaul within the last couple of years, but those sushi pictures have consistently remained up-voted to the top.   Here's what we ordered...  CEVICHE for $8 - Mix of octopus, shrimp, white fish and habanero.  - Side of house-made sweet potato chips.  - Great blend of fish, nicely complements the sauce.  - Good size for two people to share.   UNI OYSTER IKURA for $8 - One piece per order of sea urchin and salmon egg, served on a small oyster half shell.  - They rotate which oysters they use. We got Kusshi Oysters from British Columbia.  - So fresh and delicious -- gone too soon.   We only had space for a small meal, or else we  would've tried out a few of the other adventurous dishes on the menu.   Even though we were disappointed about the rebranded menu, we have to say that everything was delicious. Pricey, but stellar. Also, Other Mama is about 20 minutes from the Strip. Out of the way, but not too far. Worth a visit, anyway!",

But your must have list begins: Amberjack crudo, fanny bay oysters with Ponzu salsa, prime ribeye with waffle fries, shrimp & mint wrapped in cucumber! And if they have it.. Irish Cream ice cream with baileys float! We ordered two! And the strawberry red wine gelato was even better than I imagined it would be!

We started out with one of their signature cocktails. A little on the small side for $10 but very good.  We moved on to Oysters, tuna tartar, and beef carpaccio. The oysters came with two different dipping sauces that were lighter than a cocktail sauce but big on flavor. That mixed with fresh squeezed lemon and the oysters tasted superb!  The tuna tartar was served with delish waffle fries that were lightly sprinkled with a red pepper. Last we had the beef carpaccio. It was served with these amazing seaweed crisps, arugula, and cherry tomatoes with fresh ground pepper and a drizzle of olive oil( I think, at least that was the base for whatever was drizzled on there...good none the less)   I was full and happy when we finished.  The service was great as well.   :",

Watching the Chef prepare the food at the bar made the whole experience even better. He was Immaculate  at what he did. Even though we only ordered the regular sashimi dish he gave us extra different fish that was delicious. This was better then any high priced fancy restaurant I ate at on the strip and was well worth the short drive. I have to express my feelings to not only the chef but everyone that worked there. Everyone worked hard and was good at their job. Like a All Star team. Great Job. You guys deserve your success.",

From the oysters to the ceviche, hot pot to the tartare, even all the way to the house-made ice creams (the Vietnamese coffee flavor was amazing). All top notch.

We would have been happy to wait for an opening but she said there were only two lower bar seats since we didn't have reservations. She handed us two menus to take to the bar ourselves. We were crammed elbow to elbow with the patrons next to us. While waiting for a server, the guy next to be was so close he probably elbowed me about 5 times. I was so excited to come after trying out a dish from the food and wine festival but couldn't get past how unwelcome we felt. I might try to come back again on a slower night but it'll be difficult to get past our first impression of being \"addressed\" (not welcomed) seconds after walking in the door. You can get a lot of great, modern food in Vegas so I'm not sure the food alone will be enough to lure me back.",

For the sauces, we chose honey and lemon, as well as the pickled pepper and habanero. I liked the honey and lemon, while my boyfriend preferred the latter. The chicken wings did nothing for me. Yes, they were crispy, but the sauce just tasted like a jazzed up gojuchang. Now, I don't know why we ordered the steak. We've been eating so much steak! I guess we were looking for a change of flavors, but it tasted very similar to what I prepare at home. Nothing out of the ordinary. I will add that it was well seasoned and perfectly medium rare. The highlight of our meal was the waffle fries. Who doesn't love waffle fries?! Service was nice and they came regularly to refill our waters. I wasn't mind blown but I wouldn't mind coming back to try some other items.",

This is a pretty small spot and it didn't seem too busy the day I came but It may be on usual days. Personally, I am not a fan of sashimi and oysters which was on their special menu. I also cannot handle spicy food so at first I was hesitant. After looking at the menu, I got the grilled fish. The fish was a little too burnt for me but the inside was delicious, filled with lemon and fresh greens. Their sweet potatoes on the side were SO DELICIOUS! I would order those as a side!!! We got the hot pot ($22) which was VERY SMALL and definitely not worth It. But we also got a sashimi bowl ($33??) and It had 25 pieces of sashimi. We also got the American Kobe (the peas on It were sooo good) and they pre sliced It for us which was very nice. The prime steak was alright but personally loved the sauce on It with the waffle fries. I did not understand the hype until I had It! They made It so It was like a potato chip instead of your usual soft waffle fries. And last but not least, we ordered rice pudding and the walnut brownie (both were $7) and although the portion seems small, It was the perfect size after a very filling meal. The service was nice and the people were friendly, the food took a little longer (probably because of the grilled fish) but with family time always flies. Come here to enjoy a nice meal (even those who don't typically enjoy seafood).",

    "text": "It's kind of a dilemma for me when I want to give a restaurant a five-star rating based on the food alone but then the service fell flat on its nose after starting out remarkably well.  I'd like to write about all the food we intended to order but unfortunately, three dishes did not even make it to our table!    Joined by my co-workers for dinner, we started off with an order of the raw oysters (6 different selections on the board) along with oyster rockefeller with foie gras as well as an order of amberjack crudo.  The raw oysters were some of the best quality in Vegas at an amazing $2 each on average.  Very clean, delicious flavor.  The Beau Soleil oysters were my favorite, more sweet, less briny taste (my preference).  The oysters came with choices of dipping sauces of which we tried Wasabi Cocktail and Rosemary Mignonette.  Our servers were very knowledgable and helped us decide on what oysters to try.  The oyster rockefeller with foie gras was already a must order as soon I laid my eyes on the menu.  This is a cooked version of oyster topped with a spinach mix and some foie gras on top.  I was disappointed when our 2nd order of these never came to our table.  The dish came with 4 good-sized oysters and it was delicious.  The amberjack crudo was equally tasty.  So much in fact that we ordered another.  My co-worker ordered the assorted sashimi platter which they said had very fresh selections of fish and octopus.    Our final dish we were able to try was the caviar and french toast with the creme fraiche.  Seriously amazing.  Perfectly cooked, warm, french toast with a helpful scoop of caviar on top.  This combination was new to me but most certainly welcome again and again.    It was at this time that we decided to order some main entrees (1/2 organic chicken on shishito peppers and yukon potatoes,  also a hanger steak medium-rare) and another oyster rockefeller.    We waited over 30 minutes and attributed the delay (in comparison to how fast the rest of the prior food came) to the influx of people that came after us.  Another 10 minutes passed without servers coming to our table and we finally flagged our original server down (asian guy, top knot, whose name I can't recall).  When we asked about our food, the server apologized saying he lost our ticket and the order was never placed.  40 minutes wasted.  We decided to just end the night here and took the check.   Unaware of the mishap, the manager said \"Thank you!\" as we stood to leave.  I made sure to inform her of the problem before we left.  Besides an apology and a promise to comp a few rounds (of what?) next visit, we left the restaurant still hungry and unsatisfied.     I'd like to give this place another shot but it's no longer near the top of my must-try list.   With that said, delicious food and worth a try if you have not gone before.  Just make sure they don't lose your order.",

    "text": "Other Mama is quite delightful. Keep your eye out on Durango for Brewske's Pub and Other Mama's tucked right behind it to the left.  My friends and I have been wanting to try this restaurant for a few weeks now and finally made plans to go! I was really looking forward to it and went with an empty stomach and high expectations.   The ambiance is very comfortable; dimly lit with a modern-hipster feel to it. The cooks prepare the food in the back (in an open area) so you can watch all of the the cooking action!   The menu is small and they have a chalkboard wall with the daily specials. We didn't hold back and splurged on a variety of dishes to share:  Caviar & French Toast  - A combination that you wouldn't think would work but was one of my favorite dishes. There is something strangely delicious about the sweetness of the French toast and the saltiness of the caviar. After one bite, you want 10 more  Amberjack (Yellowtail) Crudo topped with Ponzu Salsa - My other favorite dish. Raw Yellowtail. Soft, fresh, and very refreshing - doused in something both sweet and sour  Oysters Foie Rockefeller - Baked oysters topped with Foie Gras. Warm deliciousness that melts in your mouth. Rich in flavor and creamy... My third time trying Foie Gras and it keeps getting better   Octopus Carpaccio - My first time trying raw octopus and it was different! A little chewy but I can say I enjoyed it. Our server said it's alive until the chef prepares it. Now if this is True, that is some FRESH carpaccio...   Duck Creek and Blue Point Raw Oysters - Ordered the Wasabi Cocktail and Pickled Pepper and Habanero sauce which were unique and very tasty! As I'm a huge fan of oysters, these were a must. The Blue Point was better of the two IMO  Panko Fried Clams - Juicy clams with just the right amount of fried batter on them. The tarter dipping sauce was on point too   Pork Belly Kimchi Fried Rice - The only menu item I didn't care for. It wasn't bad, but my expectations for Korean food are on another level. This dish just didn't quite meet them. I love ripe Kimchi, don't get me wrong, but the Kimchi in this fried rice was a wee bit too sour...  Jameson Ginger Sorbet and Viet Coffee Ice Cream - Both were incredibly flavorful desserts and the perfect ending to a wonderful meal!  Beryl - I couldn't indulge because I was headed to work after dinner but one of my friends ordered this apricot bourbon with orange bitters. I tried a sip and wish I could have enjoyed an entire glass. If you're a whiskey sour fan, you'd really enjoy a Beryl  The service was great (friendly server and busser who frequently checked up on us) and so was the food. The portions are very small compared to the prices. (I could have inhaled 3 orders of the Amberjack Crudo) but I get it. Other Mama is a place to come for small bites, cocktails, and a tasting experience. Definitely not the place for a big ol' hearty meal.   I enjoyed my experience here and will definitely be coming back! I want to try the Bigeye Tuna Poke, Deviled Eggs, and Prime Ribeye Steak next time!",

    "text": "Sexy. Nautical. Hipster. No, I am not talking about my Halloween costume this year. It is as rare for me to give 5 stars on the first visit as it is to find a little gem like this in the desert.  Mind effing libations and some of the best seafood and perfectly executed meals we have ever had!   Items tried: - Aunt Opal cocktail. Other Mama's take on a Moscow mule. Vodka, ginger beer, lime, and serrano pepper liquer. This has a spicy kick...beware! I preferred this over mine.   - Mildred cocktail. Rum, strawberry, lime, and mint. Nothing too special, but I walked out of there a drunk sailor!   - Oysters (minimum order of 6). We ordered one of each on the specials board (see photo for names). My husband loves oysters and I usually have a hard time stomaching them. Normally, I avoid oysters altogether. I mustered some courage and took a walk on the plank. I tried the smallest, most innocuous one, the Point Reyes. Oh boy, I was not disappointed! My husband thought the oysters were outstanding and barely had an ocean taste.   - Hanger steak with miso Hollandaise sauce and waffle fries. This blows a lot of fancy steakhouse steaks out of the water! I did not expect much from a hanger steak. This was prepared beautifully medium rare and had some crack Hollandaise sauce to go with it. The waffle fries were nice and crunchy and a good accompaniment.   - Grilled wild Kauai shrimp with a side of kimchi fried rice. It was pretty good, but not great. The quality of the shrimp was impressive! The kimchi fried rice was probably my least favorite thing that I tried that night, but it paired well with the shrimp.  Peter was an awesome server who was extremely prompt, knowledgeable about the menu, and super friendly! Thanks to him and his recommendations, we had a wonderful dinner and an unforgettable experience.",

Also it's kind of small so it's imperative to make a reservation or you might get stuck with no table. Service was a little slow. Which didn't make sense because it's small restaurant.",

Don't get me wrong, Other Mama's was good, just not outstanding. But it might be that my expectations were too high.  First, the good: the pork belly kimchi fried rice was fantastic! Flavorful and served in a hot stone pot, so when you mix the over easy egg into the rice, the pot cooks the egg at the same time. The grilled shrimp salad was also delicious! Would definitely order both of these again.  Next, the rest: the jalapeno hush puppies were a bit bland. There was a kick from the jalapeno but something was missing. The caviar French toast also didn't quite pair up well. I see the intent, trying to balance the saltiness of the caviar with the sweetness of the toast, but for me, it didn't work. And at $19, not worth the price.  Service was very good, our server was attentive and the food came out quickly. It's a small space, but we didn't have to wait (on a weeknight).",

But every time I come back, my challenge is to always find something new to do and somewhere fun to eat.   I found this gem on Fortune Magazine as one of the places famous chefs on the strip like to go after work.   You can't judge a book by its cover because the outside is a strip mall full of Thrifty Ice Cream, Karate, Salon Centric, etc. Once you're inside, you're transported to a whole new dimension of Asian Fusion food and beautifully crafted cocktails.   The OM Team from servers, bartenders to managers are amazing. Alan, the manager, is keen on details especially remember names, conversation and faces. He even remembered my voice when I was making reservations over the phone (available on Open Table now).  His food reco's and further beyond OT food recommendations are next to par.  My suggestion would usually rsvp ahead of time. Bar is first come first serve. But on weekends, you'll need this warning as they pack up quick.   Support local and let yourself enjoy one of my favorite dishes: Agedashi Tofu.  I don't live in town and I fly in just to have this EVERY TIME.",

Also I enjoyed the set-up of this place, cozy restaurant with great decor and an open kitchen that's actually appealing to look at.  The bad: service--this didn't impress me one bit. We had the same girl approach two different times to get our drink order that was already placed by someone else. On top of that, the simplest of the drinks-- a coke--had to be asked for three different times, and took about as long as our food to come out. And then, after it finally did come out, 5 minutes later someone else came with another one. And then our waitress apologized and said there'd be no extra charge?? Cocktails however came out promptly.  The \"okay\": the oysters: this really disappointed me but they weren't bad, they just weren't good either. Sad because they were the main reason we came.  Overall, I'd come back for the raw food and maybe cocktails with friends.",

Octopus was blubbery on the bottom, not charred like the top was. Bartender isn't that friendly, I've seen him completely ignore people at the bar. New sushi chef should be reminded not to repeatedly touch her hair and hat while making sushi. Couple next to us at the bar was so upset with their food they left mid meal. Will definitely give them another shot but seems like they are having more off than on days.   Best spot in Vegas for a good variety of FRESH oysters. My fav is the poke served with freshly made sweet potato chips. Menu is creative and not the usual trendy stuff. Japanese inspired but not a sushi place. Great flavors, great dishes. Nice little place. Love sitting at the bar.",

We were incredibly lucky that it was fairly empty for a Friday night. There were only a couple of other parties dining in addition to ours. Our awesome waiter, Dillan, helped us with a high-chair for our nine-month old and recommended an amazing cocktail for me. (Although I completely forgot the name and ingredients later, but it was delicious!)  We tried and loved the kim chi fried rice, shishito peppers + cauliflower + pistachio dish, and popcorn chicken. It was pretty solid portions for tapas style. Alos, it was clear that the chefs put incredible care into every dish they made. The spices were portioned and mixed to perfection, and the crispness of the fried dishes was impeccable.  When we have money again (who the hell knows when that will be now) we'll be coming back for a date day. Other Mama was just amazing all-around.",

In addition to the attached photos, we tried the Kobe skewers, house sodas, chicken fried lobster and dessert. The most underwhelming thing was the plum pear pie...super dry and little filling(not what was expected). Back to the service-our \"deluxe\" sashimi arrived (was taken away momentarily and then brought back to us..unsure why) but also before any chopsticks. It was just dropped off with zero explanation of what the chef chose. Meanwhile the table next to us had chopsticks waiting before their sashimi arrived and were educated on each fish presented to them.  The other issue is how close the seating is. There is no way to have a normal conversation. We were seated between two tables which made it incredibly difficult for us to carry on our own conversation.  As far as the tab goes, most portions of each item are very petite so we had to keep ordering more to feel like we had a sustainable meal.   For that reason, I am not sure we would plan to go back. Included a pre-tip amount of our bill in the pics.",

The caviar french toast is a fun dish with small bites of airy french toast topped with caviar.  The spicy tuna tartare is soft and packed with flavor, pairing perfectly with the crunchy waffle fries.  The shishito, cauliflower, pistachio is a light dish and a great combination of textures.   The specials change frequently, but often include some restaurant favorites.  The chicken fried lobster consists of small, but juicy pieces of lobster with light and flavorful batter, which look like popcorn chicken.  The fried calamari combines sweet and spicy deliciousness.    Of course the oysters are fresh and delicious.  Basically, you cannot go wrong regardless of what you order.  The drinks are great and the decor is a fun eclectic underwater theme.  Perhaps most significantly, the chef and owner, Daniel, is the type of person you root for.  He is personable and humble, yet clearly inspired to produce amazing food and service.  I look forward to trying Daniel's new restaurants!",

Happy hour is 5pm-6pm and you should make reservations. We have eaten ever single item on the happy hour menu and they are all excellent. Our favorite is the tempura mushrooms, hush puppies, salmon, tuna, and the amberjack is a must. The lobster fried steak is sooo good. The 2 different steaks are both delicious and easy to share because it's sliced. The whole branzino is always a favorite. The seafood soup is not my favorite.

The ones that really stood out were the oysters, deviled eggs and the Kobe steak.   Their menu is seasonal and they have their board full of specials based on the market.   The last time we went, it seemed...so unorganized and just overall, the food was not as great.  I had recommended it for a friend's birthday dinner, and I somewhat felt like I had let them down.   Between 6 people, the bill was over $400. The server was almost non existent and seemed frantic. She was not keeping up with our orders, and we never got the 2 Kobe steak special that we ordered. And our silly asses didn't even check to see if we were charged for it or not. Huge mistake on our part, as that would have been an additional $50.   The oysters were still very good, and so were the deviled eggs. Everything else was just, okay-ish this time around. They were out of the hush puppies.  So we had: Caviar French Toast, Crab Chowder, Japanese Fried Chicken, Spicy Grilled Shrimp Skewers, Grilled Pork Belly, Waffle Fries (not really fries, they were like thin chips) and a few other specials that were just not very tasty.   Reluctant to go back, especially due to the amount of money you spend when you go. Mostly, when you have bad service and food is forgotten.",

For example, the calamari is very well seasoned with the miso hollandaise sauce, but for $15 the portion was way too small. The toro roll tasted like mush, that is a crime to do that to Toro. Seems like they took scraps of toro, blended it, and into a roll it went. They oyster Rockefeller was heavily heavily breaded. Japanese fried chicken were heavily breaded little tenders which were priced at $13!! A bit pretentious. I don't think I will be going back. Nice to try for a Saturday night. With a variety of dishes, total bill with tip was $176, I was still hungry after leaving. I wanted to add the next day, the wife had stomach problems all the way up to the late evening. I do believe it was due to the Oyster Rockefeller. They are not using fresh oysters, be weary my fellow yelpers. I do remember the Rockefellers tasting a little funky, but luckily for me I have a stronger stomach.",

    "text": "Finally made it here after bookmarking this place for almost a year. The experience was good, although my friend says that the signature hand rolls this place is known for is no longer. The previous Japanese sushi chef left. :(  Came here for happy hour/dinner one night on a weekday and the place was pretty busy. It's very small and in a non-descript place in a strip mall. Not fancy at all, just looks like a normal sushi joint. Happy hour is Monday to Friday 5-6pm, yes only 1 hour. On monday nights, they do have $1 oysters which is awesome! We definitely took advantage of that. The sashimi combo was ok, the fish quality could be better. We basically ordered one of each of the happy hour menu and thoroughly enjoyed the food!! Service was ok.   Bathrooms are clean, parking was pretty easy in the strip mall parking lot on a weeknight. Overall pretty good experience.",

Other Mama has an amazing arrays of liquors including some of the best sake. For those who are less interested in libations, the food on their menu is as equally impressive.  They have an assortment of large and small shareable plates and a board of fresh fish options. Compared to the strip, the prices are considerable lower since away with tremendous flavor. My favorites for the night? Whitefish carpaccio, calamari, chicken fried lobster, and matcha tres leche cake (desserts are not on the menu as they vary based upon what was made). I would most definitely recommend for those who have a car (or access to a cab/ride share) to check it out.",

My favorite was the blue point which were about $1.50. We decided to order the blue soleil ($2.50) and personally didn't care for them. The wasabi cocktail and pickled pepper & habanero sauces are great. The waffle fries were good, but I feel like i can get that at any other place, but I still ordered it. Crispy and delicious, but not sure if it was worth the price. The cavier and French toast ($19) was way overrated. I felt like the French toast was way too thick for the amount of cavier they put on there. It felt like I was just eating toast and couldn't taste the cavier. What a waste of cavier. I would have just eaten the cavier with a cracker and been happy, or a thinner piece of bread or add more cavier on it? You can get decent cavier of 10g for about $30. The blue crab and jalapeno hush puppies were okay. I love blue crab, but maybe having it hush puppy style wasn't my thing. The Pork belly kimchee was not that great. I don't eat Pork, but I ate the rice. The kimchee was really sour and from what my guests have said about the Pork belly was not that special. It was tough and chewy. Maybe dry? We ordered the ceviche. I have to say it was good. I liked it and it came with sweet potato fries. Overall experience, was a huge disappointment. I would honestly come back for the oysters only and nothing else. I guess I had incredible expectations, with reading the credentials of having worked with chef Morimoto. It fell short for me, but I will be back for the blue points.",

It almost made me forget about the food until we had the pork belly kim chi fried rice and the spicy yuzu chicken wings.. Geez this food amazing..  The head chef use to work for an iron chef.. And you could definitely tell.. Just look at the pictures.. But on top of all of that.. The service was amazing.. They are so nice and they make sure your is experience is one of a kind.. They notice the small details like when you order desert they give you a smaller spoon and fork to eat it.. I think the only small downfall is this  place is a little hard to get too at night but once you find it.. You will definitely forget about it.. Honestly if your looking for an escape away from the strip with great food, great cocktails, and great service.. You definitely need to check this place out.. Period",

We ordered a great variety of things from their Caviar French Toast, Amberjack Crudo, Octopus Carpaccio, Pork Belly Kim Chee Fried Rice, and the Softshell Crab. So at first we just ordered the crab and then we saw that they also made a sandwich! Ok, this Softshell crab had a light batter with some cornmeal in the mix, super meaty, and cooked to perfection and served with a nice ponzu sauce. Now the sandwich.... As if the crab wasn't good enough, they added a nice piece of oh so tender, flavorful pork belly, a nice Asian slaw, and to top it off, a fried egg all served on a soft brioche bun! Can you say mouth-gasam?!  House-made waffle cut potato chips and a smoked ketchup to accompany this amazing sandwich.  Jean was excellent! Changed out our plates and even crumbed our table! You don't find that to often at casual places like this. I will definitely be back again! And soon!",

    "text": "Enjoyable but not too impressed. Wanted to like it more as it is close to home and seems quite unique.   You wouldn't think this was a sushi place upon first entering the restaurant. Decor was more mid-atlantic coastal, odd for sushi but intriguing and inviting.   We ordered a few of the house favorites - variety of oysters, amberjack crudo, tuna tartare, white fish ceviche, pork belly kimchi fried rice, and variety of nigiri.   Server was nice, but we probably would have enjoyed our selections more if they didn't ALL come to the table at the SAME time. No kidding. Is this normal here or were they rushing us out?  Felt more like a buffet or ayce than a fine dining experience. Kind of ruined it for us.  When you pay $100+ for two, you expect better timing of the food coming out.   Crudo was very good, with the tangy ponzu sauce.  Surprisingly, the cheap $1 NY oysters were quite plump and more tasty than the more expensive varieties. The ceviche was disappointing, flavorless other than an overpowering taste of lime. Needed more depth, seasoning and heat. Tartare was better, served with tasty waffle fries, and you do get quite a sizeable portion. Nigiri was decent, but unremarkable, as was the fried rice.   Don't be surprised if the prices have hiked up a bit recently too. Overall decent but not overly impressed. 4 star food, but sadly -1for service.",

Perhaps having some sort of sauce to accompany the waffle fries would provide the extra flavor boost it needs (in general, not necessarily for the tuna tartare dish). Prime rib eye also similarly mediocre with the sauce at times adding to the dish and at other times taking away the steak's natural flavor. The cocktails are good and the desserts were nice. The meat is tender but slightly overcooked for medium rare. The menu is good overall but you're really here for the oysters.",

The server department needs a vital upgrade, as the lady we had every time we came in has been rather slow and incompetent. She even once told us we could not order another drink until we finished our original ones. I wonder what the manger would have thought if he was present hearing such blatant non-sense. Anther thing that needs a much needed adjustment is the clarity on the menu, as well as the happy hour, as it can get very confusing what time is what happy hour; as now there are two separate happy hours, which offer different discounts on food and drinks. The early one from 5-6 is--discounts on apps and drinks--and from 10-11 it's only dollar oysters, and you have no say in which oysters they are, as the cook decides for you. The food is high quality and most everything you order will not disappoint. I have tried most of the menu and everything is cooked to near perfection. They just need to adjust a few things, and this place has the elements to be one of the best spots in town for happy hour, and good food.",

While the hot dishes are terrific and help create a more balanced meal, the raw bar dishes and specials are the stars.  The scallops and the surf clams were perfectly fresh (rotating specials), and the amberjack crudo had accompaniments to best take advantage of the fish's unique taste and texture.  Both bartenders/mixologists we have met are knowledgeable and we were almost as pleased with the dealer's choice -- both during the meal and as after-dinner -- as at a place like Herbs and Rye.  ALSO, BEST DOLLAR OYSTERS WE'VE HAD IN VEGAS.  Blue points with interesting garnishes -- rosemary mignonette, wasabi horseradish.  We will be back as soon as possible!",

    "text": "There were two restaurants that I was most looking forward to on my last trip to Last Vegas, Chengdu Taste and Other Mama. To be perfectly honest, Other Mama was the one that I was most worried about given we were going to be visiting on a Sunday and while most of the feedback about the place was positive, I did start to notice some grumblings about service and food quality, albeit just a few.  So a couple of Sundays ago five of us descended upon Other Mama for a 7pm reservation. The very first impression walking through the door was not good. There was a distinct smell of burnt oil along with smoke wafting all over the place. We were seated at a table in the middle of the restaurant which was almost filled, with what looked to be mostly locals (which to me is a great sign). We were presented with menus and asked if there were any drink orders. When pressed about her favorite cocktails (many have commented about how good the cocktails were there) our waitress just asked us what we like to drink and offered no more. Very little enthusiasm. OK, IPA it is then.  Drinks placed we looked over the menu. Now, here is what I was a bit confused with. Most of the reports about this place has been about the quality of raw fish and how deftly it is handled. Yet looking over the menu, there seemed to be very little in terms of fresh raw fish. So to get things started we decided to order several items and continue to scour the menu and order other items later. We \"started\" with 2 types of oysters (Kusshi and French Kiss), uni, pork belly kimchi fried rice, deviled eggs with fried oysters, spicy yuzu fried chicken wings and the shishito peppers.  Arriving first were oysters and uni. While the raw bar displayed shellfish on ice in the display case the oysters that were brought to our table seemed flat and tired, no plumpness to them whatsoever. And the taste matched the appearance. Muddled brine flavor that reminded me of low tide. The uni was nicely presented atop a shiso leaf. Of the 5 pieces of uni, 3 were of good size and looked mostly intact. The other two were sad pieces almost the dregs of what was left and by no means appealing. Uni is one of my favorite pieces of nigiri. I love the texture and flavor. However these were a disappointment, not horrible but certainly not worth the $7 pp tab they were charging.  Next up were the deviled eggs, pork belly kimchi fried rice and the chicken wings. The deviled eggs were presented nicely with the fried oyster on top. As soon as I picked up the egg I paused as the egg white was stone cold. As I put the deviled egg in my mouth I realized not only was the white stone cold so was the yolk part of the deviled egg. For me this was very off-putting to say the least. The fried oyster was hot and actually very well fried but while some dishes benefit from a warm and cold component together, this dish did not. Horrible? No, not at all. But not appealing and certainly not something I would consider ordering again. The pork belly kimchi fried rice looked fairly appealing with a well executed fried egg atop the rice and pork belly. The belly itself was nothing special as the texture was not crisp nor was it soft like a a braised belly can be. Was was just eeh. Then there is the rice. This rice was nowhere near fried but rather resembled a starchy mess. Given how others have praised this dish I could not have been more disappointed...until I tasted the chicken wings. No reason to go into much here other than to say these were over battered over fried balls of mess. Mehhh.  It was at this point that I leaned over to my friend and said, \"what would feel about pulling the rip cord and going to get a second meal?\"  Check please.  To be fair, we did not sample a lot of dishes. And quite honestly we may have had other dishes this evening but I just don't remember. But when 5 people all decide to leave a restaurant to eat somewhere else I really don't think you can write this off as just a bad night. As I mentioned in another post I am convinced this is an example of the Emperor not having any clothes.",

    "text": "I love trying new places and I was informed this place had some great food.  If I were to just rate on ambiance alone, it would definitely receive more stars, but a restaurant needs more than just decor to be a great place to eat.  There really were not that many people enjoying dinner, a couple large groups some people at the sushi bar, and others scattered about.  I did notice a few open 4 tops that were open and a couple 2 tops that were extremely code to one another, almost bistro style.  My significant other and I were seated at one of the two tops which literally was inches away from a women waiting for her date to arrive. We placed our drink orders and the woman's date showed up. I realize that this restaurant cannot really be held responsible for an overly rowdy couple on a date, but when there are several open seats, you would think placing people inches from one another could be avoided.  Our server was extremely friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered a few different plates to share and one entry that our server recommended was the PBR Hot Pot. Prior to the PBR Hot Pot, we explained that it was my significant others birthday and apparently this restaurant does nothing to celebrate at all, as nothing was offered.  When the pot arrived we were informed that it was hot.   We instantly noticed a rancid smell and it seemed to be coming from the pot. It actually smells like sewage. We thought for sure we were mistaken and decided to try the steaming pot of what could potentially be either the worst or best thing we have ever tried, after a few sips of the broth, we tried the shrimp, I took one bite and had to put the rest on a plate, it did not taste that great. I thought I would give it one more shot and took one bite of the mussel and almost vomited! I actually had to excuse myself and make a quick exit to the bathroom where I spit the disgusting food into the toilet. I tried rinsing the nasty taste out of my mouth but to no avail. Once back to the table, my significant other and I decided that we were pretty disgusted by the last dish and ordered nothing else. I would say within 45 mins to an hour we both started feeling ill, upset stomachs which resulted to several trips to the bathroom, thankfully there are a few at home to use.   The day after our visit we were both still frequenting our toilets and could not shake the upset stomach that resulted in that disgusting \"hot pot\"   I would not recommend this place to anyone and even shared my experience with several friends.   Because I have been sick for the entire evening of our visit and the complete following day and night afterwards, I cannot rate this higher than a 1, food poisoning is not fun.",

    "text": "This is an excellent oyster restaurant - it is NOT a good sushi restaurant.  If you love oysters, you will be in heaven at this spot.  This is a must try spot for oysters.  The restaurant is nicely decorated and I found the service to be pleasant and very well informed.  Hopefully, if you dine here you will have a love of oysters because they are fresh, beautiful, large and a very good deal.  I had a mix of the $1 and $2 oysters with the wasabi cocktail sauce, rosemary mignonette and the ponzu salsa.  All the sauces work very well with the oysters, but the ponzu salsa was tangy and fresh and it was the absolute best.  To be able to have a dozen or two of excellent oysters and not break the bank is the number one reason to visit this restaurant.  I was very let down by the nigiri and crudo at this restaurant.  We ordered the nigiri sampler for $15.  The fish on the nigiri was dried out and sliced too thin for the price.  The rice in the nigiri was flavorless.  So many other AYCE sushi joints in this town would shame Other Mama when it comes to nigiri.  We also tried the amberjack crudo.  The flavor of the salsa on the crudo was amazing, but once again the tiny and thin slices of fish were not acceptable for the price ($13).  I wasn't terribly impressed by the cocktails, and I tried two of them.  They were small and the fascinating descriptions of the ingredients just didn't deliver a satisfying drink.  They do have an excellent draft beer selection and I found that tasted better with the oysters.  The next time I go I am just going to order oysters and beer and it will be a 5 star experience.  I recommend everyone else do the same.",

Very mellow and clean space with an intimate feel. The service was great, and the staff was very knowledgeable.  We ate the white fish ceviche (delicious and oh so fresh tasting)!!!! And even though it's an appetizer, they give such a great portion that I was full. I substituted the sweet potato fries for waffle fries and I'm so glad I did. the seasoning and crispness of the fries were perfect! Also had the steak with miso hollandaise cooked to perfection and smothered in an equally yummy sauce. My only disappointment was the crab, pork belly, egg sandwich. It sounded good in theory but it just had too much going on and was too rich for my taste.  Will definitely come back again and sample some of the other seafood.",

    "text": "Heard great things from our friends so decided to give a try.  First impression the place looked cool, love the look and feel of the restaurant.  We had to wait close to an hour when there were only 2 small parties ahead of us which was frustrating.  To add to the frustration of waiting they don't have anywhere for you to sit while you wait so you're kind of just stuck walking or standing around til they call you.  The hostess was slow.  When she finally told us she'd clean off a spot at the bar for us to sit, that took her another 10 minutes.  Our server came (not promptly) and we ordered a dozen oysters and the hush puppies to start.  Hush puppies not worth the money, come with a bland sauce, nothing special.  Then never saw our waiter again.  We ordered the ribeye dish from the busser that kept passing by.  That dish was AMAZING and probably the only reason I'm giving this review 3 stars.  Meat cooked perfect, the sauce on top was awesome, and came with really yummy waffle fries.  We sat and waited around about 20 more minutes after our meal was finished.  As the hostess passed us, I asked for her help getting the bill.  She then walked around aimlessly for 10-15 more minutes, never told our waiter we wanted our bill... Let's just say by the time he FINALLY realized we still existed we were more than ready to get out of there.  We realized why it took so long to get seated... Because they take so long to take care of the guests that already have a seat.  Disappointed because they have an awesome menu and awesome food and really cool vibe... Decor, music... But the service was just terrible.    Fortunately this is something they can fix easily and this place would be an awesome spot we'd love to come back to if the staff were ever replaced or retrained.",

    "text": "Small Quaint Restaurant With Interest Concept, Friendly Servers, Okay Food  We ordered the Pork Belly Kim Chi Fried Rice, Oysters, Spicy Yuzu Chicken Wings, and the special white fish.  The oysters were excellent and fresh, and I enjoyed the options of having different sauces for them.  The special white fish was excellent.  It was on par with Milo's white fish with a strong lemony, salty goodness that was quite good.  However, that's where the experience ended.  The Fried Rice sucks.  I can't say it any other way.  I overheard another table discussing it and hearing them compare it to KoMex.  I was laughing because I was thinking the same thing.  If you want Kim Chee Fried Rice, go to KoMex.  It's cheaper, more flavorful, and just better done.  As for the Chicken Wings, let's just call it a fail.  I have no idea how they prepare them, but they just suck.  Lotus of Siam has some of the best spicy chicken wings I've tried.  Other Mama's are simply forgettable.    The restaurant was nice to try, but I won't be returning.  There are too many other options.  Also, the layout of the restaurant is awkward for Las Vegas.  It did remind me a lot of restaurants in Nashville mixed with a sushi bar, but it seems like a huge waste of space unless you want most people to sit at the bar.",

My boyfriend and I got seated immediately and our server came right away.   To start off, we decided to go for a dozen oysters and the grilled squid. All of the oysters they had that day were really small - which was a bit disappointing as they are a bit expensive. The grilled squid was delicious - I looked away for a second and my boyfriend already ate half of the dish -_-. For entrees I got the 1/2 organic chicken w/ peewee potatoes and spinach, and he got the Prime NY steak, miso hollandaise, and waffle fries.  My chicken was delicious and was cooked perfectly. The only downside was it being a bit too salty. I think I ate more of the steak than I did of my own dish - cause that shit was good!   For dessert, we got the japanese cheesecake and nutella ice cream. I wasn't really impressed with the cheesecake - but I did notice that it's a bit lighter compared to other cheesecakes I've eaten, still not worth the $7 in my opinion. That nutella ice cream doe. They even added some nuts into it! I would've eaten 2 scoops but I probably would've barfed if I ate any more food.  This place can be a bit pricey but it does offer fresh sea food (thank goodness I didn't shit my pants from the oysters so thats always a plus). Although,I felt like some of our dishes were overpriced for what they were. The service was excellent and we would probably come back just for that steak!",

Oysters were very fresh (no fishy smell) and they had a variety to chose from.  The oysters were individually priced so you can try different ones but you have to order at least 6.  The pricing on the oysters well lets just say best in Vegas!!  Massachusetts Clams, tasted great... lightly breaded and great aioli dipping sauce.  I really like the ambiance, the decor makes you feel relaxed, great place to chill grab a couple of drinks and some food. Music was playing some nice reggae... would like to hear some jazz or some neo-soul but that's just me.   They have more on the menu that I want to try and I will soon. Check this place out ... you might like it!!!",

    "text": "I'm just gonna say it. This is my NEW favorite restaurant in a city full of amazing restaurants. And not just because dining on the strip is for suckers. Do you:  Love oysters? Love fish? Love craft cocktails? Love life?  If you can even check two of those things off, you owe it to yourself to GET IN HERE. A previous reviewer had the gall to compare Other Mama's waffle fries to Chik-Fil-A's fries. This person definitely can't check any of these items off. Especially number four. But hey, enjoy your equality-unfriendly chicken, my man.  We've been to Other Mama four times - once every couple of weeks - in the short time they've been open. Every time we walk out the door in a great mood, and plotting our next visit. We've worked our way around the better part of the menu at this point - but still have some things to try. Without getting too detailed, I'll just say that we haven't had a single dish that we wouldn't order again. No joke. The oysters, at $1 - $2.50 each, are a no-brainer. There are many inventive sauces to choose from and it's a ton of fun to try different pairings. The deviled eggs are the best freaking deviled eggs I've had in my entire life (with apologies to Carson Kitchen). Mixed seafood ceviche is the bomb. Nigiri sampler (which included flying fish the night we tried it) was out of this world. Chef/Owner Dan is incredibly thoughtful in his preparation - the guy blends his own soy sauce, and seasons his sushi rice in a subtly different way to complement that. The result is incredible.  Enough gushing about the food. I'm thirsty. The cocktail program here is also inspired. There are just two bartenders, and they both have plenty of tricks up their respective sleeves. Last time we were there, English was working on a Japanese Hairy Crab infused vodka to be used in a future bloody mary offering (ummm, brunch. Now, guys.) and he let us try it. He also made me a bacon manhattan out of some crazy jar of stuff he keeps on the top shelf. These guys have chops and they put a ton of thought into the cocktails... all of which are named after old ladies. No 'Ethel' on the menu yet - my grandmother's name - but we can dream! Anyway, I highly recommend the 'Beryl' for you dark spirit lovers and the 'Vera' for anyone who loves champagne-based drinks.  No review would be complete without a mention of the service - efficient and friendly. Pro tip - try and sit at the bar, where you'll get a little face time with the mad geniuses that are putting out these dishes and drinks. (shout out to Stan, creator of the Stanwich, which we hope will be on the eventual brunch menu.)  Pro tip #2: make a reservation. There's like nine tables and another 9 or so seats at the bar. Do the math.   Cheers, Other Mama... Vegas is lucky to have you.",

For exampke, the asian wings we ordered: the wings themselevs had no taste and the sauce on top wasnt a wow momement. There are better asian wings elsewhere. The one dish which stood out were the otsters with ikura and uni.  Everything else was just ok. Would not return.",

    "text": "Other Mama! Where has she been all my life?  Walked in on Saturday night around 8:30 PM with a girlfriend. There were a handful of tables that filled the air with light chatter. Music was at the perfect volume level and completed the look of this place. If I could scoop this venue up with my hands and relocate it, it'd be the perfect addition to the downtown Las Vegas area. It had that kind of vibe - cool and boutique-feeling, but not stuck up.   Started off our night right with a cocktail. Gf got the Bessie (Cazadores Tequila, Habanero Honey and Dogfish IPA, garnished with a watermelon slice) and I ordered the Aunt Opal, which was a pretty standard version of a Moscow Mule. I know, uncommon of the Whiskey Woman but I wasn't up for having my usual on-the-rocks beverage and I was actually craving ginger beer! It ended up being the perfect, sparkling introduction I needed.   The Octopus Carpaccio and Amberjack Crudo graced us with their presence first. Both divine and yet simple, but complex. HA! Seriously though, you MUST TRY the octopus. The texture was luxurious and delicate, just slightly cooked from the hot sesame oil and was flavored with ponzu and topped with a touch of raw ginger, sweet peppers and scallion. PERFECTION! Will be back for this dish alone. The amberjack was fresh and the fish looked stunning, adorned with a ponzu salsa.   The Grass-Fed Beef Carpaccio, White Fish Ceviche and Spicy Tuna Tartare were up next. Nori & Parmesan crisps sat daintily atop the baby arugula, giving the carpaccio just the right amount of \"crunch\" character. Nice touch and I also applaud the not-too-much or not-too-little finely chopped onions that would make Goldilocks blush. The Whitefish Ceviche had the right amount of acidity and was presented in a mason jar with a generous portion of crisp sweet potato chips. Can I just say? The Spicy Tuna Tartare had the perfect amount of spice. Just enough fire and flare without the watering of eyes or the desperate panting and grabbing of the nearest glass of ice water. Crunchy, but soft-on-the-inside waffle fries accompanied the creamy tuna and were hearty enough to endure the weight of the tartare. There's nothing I dislike more than weak chips that shatter into a million pieces with one timid bite.   The black chalkboard menu-capitalized Sea Snail special was something I was definitely looking forward to. The presentation was brilliant - front-page magazine cover worthy. It came in the shell it domesticated itself in (I'm assuming, and if not I'd like to keep thinking so) and was served with a ponzu dipping sauce. PORK BELLY KIM CHEE FRIED RICE was brought to our table still sizzling in the hot pot topped with a sunny-side up egg. I immediately chopped the embryo open to let that liquid gold egg yolk run, not walk. Fatty pork belly is truly a blessing and must be used in more dishes in this world.   I LOVE UNI. Any place that has uni on the menu must be approached cautiously, but if they have fresh - and I mean, FRESH uni then you must give it a go. I didn't ask, but I'm assuming from the size of our cute little uni scoops, I'm guessing they were from Hokkaido, Japan (my favorite region of uni producers). I could be wrong. Either way, they were amazing and sweet. I ended up ordering more later as I could not resist. Friendly and passionate Chef came out and jokingly informed us that we ordered the last of the precious treasure. I'm not going to lie - it made me feel a little happy inside that we weren't going to be victims of the \"86\" grim reaper.   We had coffee ice cream drizzled with Bailey's to finish our palate's journey. Our bill came to $140, well worth splitting between the two of us. We had more than enough food and were stuffed to the max.   I'm going to have to bring my biological mama to meet my Other Mama. It's happening.",

The Draft Beer selection is also on point, so much Craft not Crap to choose from! #wookeyjackipa #grapefruitsculpin #greenflashipa   Just a tip, make a reservation, the wait sucks as does the service however the freshness and quality of the food totally makes up for the FOH staff.   All in all the food here is outstanding, the Ribeye, Oysters, Sashimi, and Caviar French Toast was some of the best quality and best tasting food I have had in Las Vegas, I wish this place much success.",

Everything was delicious and so full of flavor....I loved the signature drinks and the mixologist was so informative since I'm picky when trying new drinks , but I tried 2 drinks and both were amazing I would recommend the Agatha and Trixie ...next for apps we got the 4 oysters 2-blue point / 2 fanny bay with pickled pepper and habanero oil and later was convinced to order the Oyster Rockefeller...Wow!!! Best tasting seafood app I've ever had..then the wings came out and looking at them I thought they were spicy but when I bit into them the sauce was well balanced  sweet /spicy and they were soo crispy. Our last app was the deviled eggs with bacon and that was tasty and I added some Sriracha for a kick. Finally for our main entree we chose to share the Ribeye (medium rare) with waffle fries and miso hollandaise...after 1 bite I was bummed I had to share!!! The hollandaise was rich and buttery and melting in your mouth and the ribeye was cooked perfectly!!  We did have dessert and the Japanese cheesecake was the winner it was light, fluffy and the raspberry with mint was delicious...the cantaloupe sorbet was refreshing and not too sweet or filling which was perfect since we ate so much!!! I would definitely be back soon and to try something new, even tho that Ribeye is perfection!!",

    "text": "After hearing about this place from local chefs and finding it on my girlfriend's bookmarks we decided to check out Other Mama the other day and we arrive right at opening and just in time for happy hour.  The shopping center this place is located in is older and may seem sketchy but I find the best restaurants are usually located in places like these and I can definitely see Other Mama inspiring competitors to this lot in the future. Stepping inside it felt like I was transported to a sea side village in Maine or something and I was visiting the local tavern on a stormy day. It's a dimly lit maritime decor and that interior makes you feel right at home.  Service: Our server was great as she went introduced the menu and it's concepts as well as breaking down the Specials wall and going into detail about the more popular or in season ones. She was also on top of our waters and checked back frequently to make sure we were good. Usually at local spots I don't expect 5 star service and I mean it wasn't formal and it shouldn't be, but she definitely knocked it out of the park. I was impressed with her extensive menu knowledge and ability to give good recommendations and reasons why she'd recommend it not just for the sake of upselling.   Starters: Spicy Tuna with Waffle Fries x White Fish Ceviche. Both of these items were on the happy hour and for I believe $6 or something like that it was an absolute steal. And these aren't even half portions, it's the full size. The Ceviche was a combination of different things and paired with some excellent sweet potato chips. The chips were crunchy but not super hard and I found myself enjoying just the chips at times and forgetting about the ceviche which was fresh and flavorful. The Spicy Tuna with Waffle Fries was probably our favorite starter though as the waffle fries were crisp and just the right size. (Before Other Mama I felt like the only place that sold Waffle Fries was Chick Fil A) Spicy Tuna was fresh as well and the portions are very generous as I found myself having enough Spicy tuna left even when the fries were almost done. Great Apps and quite filling.   Entrees: Kobe Steak x Broiled Shrimp. The Broiled Shrimp came out with 4 pieces of jumbo shrimp split open and covered in a searing skillet of hot oil, butter, and sauce. Very Cajun. Just how I like it. The shrimp was fresh and meaty while the sauce just made it so much better. I found myself dunking my shrimp and eventually my steak in the sauce as well. The steak was alright and wasn't anything super impressive. It didn't melt in my mouth and the relish had me wishing it was chimichurri. The sides of asparagus and potatoes were hearty and I appreciated how soft but crunchy the asparagus was.  I feel like the NY Strip would have been been better especially with the bernaise and waffle fries. Will definitely try next time.   Thoughts: This is definitely what I would consider a local gem. I love how there's more of these popping up around town as various chefs from the strip break out to pursue their own ventures.  This creates high quality food at a price point that isn't overkill. If Other Mama was on the strip our meal would have been in the upper 100s but instead our bill came out to $72 before tip. Im excited to be returning here multiple times and trying all of the potentially delicious foods that Other Mama has to offer.",

    "text": "Came to this place randomly around 7 on a Friday and definitely did not expect to enjoy myself as much as I did. The atmosphere of the restaurant is fantastic, it was a great mix of a date night spot, but also a casual place to enjoy others company. The lighting was dim, great music, attentive staff, and the decor really gave the place a relaxed feel. My gf and I were sat at the end of the bar because all tables were already reserved. We had a great view of the kitchen, so we were able to see the chefs working hard to make delicious food. Unfortunately, I felt really cramped and uncomfortable with no room to scoot over because all of the other seats were taken at the bar. This review would be 4.5 if yelp allowed increments. Now for the food!  We ordered the ceviche, chicken fried lobster, and the PBR hot pot. The ceviche is one of the best I have ever tasted. The seafood tasted fresh and even better with the puree they made with the habaneros. It gave the dish a sweet and tangy taste. The ceviche came with sweet potato chips for a greatly paired crunchy element.   My gf ordered the chicken fried lobster, the batter was light and the chicken was juicy. What really made it stand out was the sauce that accompanied it.   The PBR hot pot I ordered was the dish that really stood out me. The broth! Wow, I was slurping every ounce of it. The perfectly cooked seafood and Bok choy took a back seat to the broth. Maybe it was the PBR, or maybe It was the smooth and salty taste of the broth; either way it was delicious. Make sure to order a side of rice with this!",

I think this place would fit in really well Downtown, I almost forgot I was in Spring Valley because the vibe was so chill. We had the steak with hollandaise sauce on top, a half dozen of oysters (west coast and east coast) and the Chicken Fried Lobster. All of it was delicious. My one and only qualm about this place is that it's vastly overpriced. Our three items and two beers came to $104, which is more like Strip prices. We'll have to make this place more of a special occasion location to visit due to the pricing. BUT, I'm glad we tried it!",

It would be considered an incredible hole-in-the-wall because it's a small restaurant in a shopping center, and inside it's a dimly litted charming spot with a very local feel. The inside and the vibe is really great, everyone I take there comments how they love the feel of the place. The executive chef & owner, Dan Krohmer, did such a great job with this restaurant. The menu consists of small appetizers and entrees that are very sharable as well as a raw bar which they are known for. The sushi is good, they only do sashimi though for their sushi options, and I do wish they also did rolls or nigiri. The cocktails are also very unique, the tequila cocktail is my favorite. As far as dishes go, the deviled eggs and jidori chicken thighs are a couple of my favorite menu items!",

Other than that I thought everything was good like the salmon poke which was a little bit spicy. The oysters were good. The honey lemon paired well with the oysters and even my husband liked it even though it sounded weird. We also tried the hush puppy crab cakes, which was just ok and the flat iron steak which was done well. Overall, this place is good for a limited menu. I wish there was more warm foods as it was a cold day. I could have ordered the fried rice but I was more in the mood for white rice. I'm Asian and I'm used to some kind of warm carbs. The one thing I was not a fan of was the French toast caviar entree. Maybe caviar isn't my cup of tea but I didn't like it at all.   The quality of everything was great and service was excellent as well. It did start to get busier so I noticed more and more employees came to start their shift. I ended the night with the miso honey ice cream which was ok. It's definitely not my cup of tea but my husband loved the iced coffee ice cream. I definitely would come back although I was a bit thirsty when I got home.",

For example, I had a fresh oyster, topped with uni and ikura. ..what a creative combination!   Next, I had a Crab and Caviar hand roll. ..wow...I enjoyed the crab flavor, didn't taste too much caviar, but noticed a slight \"kick\" in it - that was fun!  Then, had uni, nigiri style...yum! Don't you agree that uni is like butter from the ocean?  Last, but not least, I had half a dozen NY Prime Oysters. I got a chance to select 2 dipping sauces so I picked Honey Lemon and Ponzu...  great variations for enhanced oyster experience!   The above 4 items were some of the specials of the day. There were more items on the regular menu and I understand that those change once in a while.   They service was excellent - maybe because I sat at the counter.  The ambiance was intimate and quiet. I imagine that it could get busy later in the evening as I had gone close to opening time. I liked the free parking and the cute decorations inside the restaurant!  I'm looking forward to another visit here and have other gastronomic adventures! !",

The sashimi all tasted the same, the fish was pretty fresh tasting but there was no difference in flavor between types of fish. Ehh, probably wouldn't come again",

    "text": "If Yelp allowed reviews with .5 star increments this would be a 4.5/5 stars.  I've been meaning to go and was one of my most anticipated restaurants to go to for awhile. This is what we ordered:  Svetlana - Horseradish vodka was what caught my eye but it was mixed to a point where there was little to no sharpness to it. Still an excellent drink that uses intresting ingredients.  Penelope - The drink basically tasted like a melted pomergranate limeade popsicle with the shiso leaf added that sweet plum flavor to it.   5 pieces of Salmon / 5 pieces of Big Eye Tuna -  very thin and small slices but good quality and uses real ginger and wasabi  Oyster Rockefeller - Very good came with 4 oysters that were mixed with spinach and foie gras butter  Rhode Island Calamari w/ Miso Hollandaise - Calamari was cooked to perfection and that sauce was fire. The pickeled peppers did remind us of the same flavor of the peppers used in orange chicken at Panda Express but just like Orange Chicken...shit is fire.  Prime NY Steak w/ Miso Hallandaise & Waffle Fries - Steak was done the way it should be, medium rare, and the sauce being the same as the calamari was complimented well with the steak. Waffle fries weren't like Chick-Fil-A's at all and was more thinner almost to the point of it being like a chip. If only they had a soy wasabi based steak...  Overall you can taste the quality of everything from the drinks to the condiments and it borderline warrants the price tag of each dish however the non-entree portions and drinks are on the smaller side which makes this place more on the $$$ side then $$. Will def try out more items as the hardest part of restaurants like these is choosing what to eat because the whole menu looks good.",

If you search in the reviews you see her mentioned all the time as being really great.  Probably one of, if not the best servers I've ever had.  Spicy Tuna Tartare w/ waffle fries, 3 different types of oysters, chicken fried lobster, Rhode Island Calamari, Spicy Shrimp Skewers & Kimchi Fried rice were the dishes.  All amazing.  Dessert was the Japanese Cheesecake, Chocolate Panna Cotta & Amber comped us a cup of Miso Honey ice cream.

It's not easy to tastefully buildout a place in a Vegas strip mall without breaking the bank. Other Mama reminds me of the myriad of places in European cities that are a labor of love by the Chef/Owner. Beautiful ambiance for a date or night out with friends.   Then came the menu...also a very unique thing compared to what we are used to. Basically the menu is made up of raw selection (oysters, sashimi etc.), small plates perfect for sharing tapas style, select entrees and daily specials. We hit a number of expertly prepared small plates and one of the specials: Chicken Fried Lobster. It was excellent as were the accompanying grilled pork belly, Kimchi fried rice and Shishito peppers with cauliflower and pistachios. Everything was excellent   We ended a great evening with some desert. The homemade walnut brownie was superb. The rice pudding was not to my taste but you can tell it's homemade and delivered with love. The Japanese cheese cake is nothing like you imagine - more sponge cake than New York cheese cake - but it is phenomenal. Light and very tasty.   What made the whole experience 5 Star was our wonderful server who took really great care of us. She was outstanding through out the evening and really took great care of us. We'll be going back for sure.",

It did not come with the scallop that I was hoping to get (normally). We also ordered the fried calamari cost $15 and spicy tuna tartar cost  $15.

Nigiri is about $4 per piece so going with. the nigiri combo $19 / 7 pieces is a much better deal.  the grilled octopus is tender, well seasoned, and comes with a tiny green salad.    Their approach to sushi is more of a purist.  Freshness at room temperature without overwhelming sauces.  The uni ikura oyster is amazing!  Oyster and cocktails are their competitive advantage in a market full of AYCE, buffets, and top restaurants.",

    "text": "This was by far the best meal we had over a week in Vegas. We enjoyed happy hour and a few things from the regular menu as well. This place is definitely worth a short drive off the strip and the unassuming relaxed atmosphere was a welcome break from the loud and crazy strip life. We had raw oysters, the sashimi plate, the shishito peppers, the beef carpashio, the amberjack crudo, a few other things I feel like I'm forgetting, along with beer and wine. We brought our well behaved 8 yr old boy and I feel like he was welcome there, though I wouldn't describe it as a \"kid friendly\" spot. We were the first ones in the door that night (got there right at opening), and the place filled up fast. All the food was fresh and well prepared, our favorites were the oysters and the crudo, and the service was attentive- however, we were seated and served mostly by the hostess, which I assume is standard operating procedure for them, but she was not very knowledgeable about the menu, nor very friendly. She seemed a little uncomfortable so maybe she was new? No problem, we enjoyed our visit and will return the next time we are in Vegas.",

Creaky good. Then the amberjack crudo which was exquisite. A nice balance of sweet chili and oil in the crudo  A sampling of oysters with the uni plus beau soleil and ikura served together.  Outstanding.    Finally we ordered the ocean trout sashimi. This was the best fish of the night.  Highly recommend you order this",

We had the deviled eggs , calamari, tuna sashimi, peppers , ceviche, and the steak and I have zero complaints about anything . It was all GREAT.

We ordered the blue crab hushpuppies which were very tasty, waffle fries (just right, crispy, well-seasoned), and the roasted octopus (sauce was a little difficult to enjoy and the octopus was a little too salty). I am an oyster fanatic so I ordered 1/2 dozen mixed plate of them on the halfshell and they were phenomenal (calm or clam cove were my favorite).  Only downsides were that they had either forgotten or made a mistake and delivered my son's fries to another patron so we had to wait for an extended time for him to receive them, and that the portion sizes seemed on the small side. I was still a little hungry when I left and we spent a pretty penny. The diner next to us felt bad and offered his plate of fries to my son for free which was very kind after noticing him and the situation (that was all my son ordered). The ambience is nice and laid back, but busy at the same time. The cocktails were good as well, I tried a few different ones and they were all well made. Our server was a little rushy, but things did pick up once we got there seemingly enough so for that, he gets a pass. I would definitely recommend if you have a little extra dough and are a fan of delicious seafood and good drinks.",

    "text": "We came in for dinner on a weeknight. It wasn't super busy, which for us was perfect. We sat at a little rustic table and were greeted promptly by the server. There is a huge menu board with listed specials and all the desserts. The server went over everything with us... Pay special attention to that board, lots of good stuff on there!   The menu isn't overly extensive but there are plenty of options for everyone. We ordered the Shishito peppers... Omg... Cauliflower with the peppers was utter perfection. It was a generous portion and we both couldn't get enough. We will be ordering this dish religiously from now on. I ordered a vegan avocado roll. I thought I had asked for asparagus but I'm positive it was only cucumber and avocado. It was a generous portion and pretty delicious. It wasn't the best roll I've ever eaten... But it was good enough to order again. My boyfriend ordered the pork belly Kim chi fried rice... It came out in a hot skillet... Still sizzling. Being vegan, I couldn't try it... But judging by his reaction and raving review... I can definitely say, he loved it! For dessert... We opted for the strawberry red wine sorbet... WowZa! For only two bucks, they make it in house and it was fresh and full of real fruit. The wine aroma carried throughout each bite. We will definitely be back to try the other sorbet options!   I ordered a Prosecco with a strawberry as my cocktail. It never disappoints. My boy boyfriend ordered the Bessie cocktail. It started out well but ended pretty awful. We probably won't be ordering that one again.   Our waters were always full and our server was very accommodating. She asked the proper questions to the kitchen to ensure my food came out vegan and properly. She also warned me about the shrimp paste in the rice:) nice touch!! The prices are fair and the environment is perfect for a friendly lunch or a romantic date night! We will definitely we returning!",

    "text": "Amazing establishment that's tucked in a not very impressive strip mall.  But inside, the food is beyond impressive.  I've known them for their bar and raw bar, but I had no idea the food that comes out of that kitchen can be that amazing.    Great quality ingredient and simple preparation is the best way to cook food.  And they've nailed it on that concept.    Tried a variety of oysters, clean and fresh.  You pick a few special condiments/sauces you can accompany with instead of the regular basic lemon, tabasco or vinegar.  Point Reyes ones were our fav., you could taste the ocean almost.  Sashimi combo, great quality and good portion.  The prime hanger steak is unbelievably tender and well seasoned.  The waffle fries on the side are perfectly crispy and not greasy at all. The sauce on top is also great and not overpowering, and I am normally not a heavy sauce person.  The bronzino is definitely the best bronzino I've ever had in my whole life as it seems.  The fish itself is so perfectly grilled and cleaned.  Simple salt, pepper, a little season with rosemary and lemon slices.  Not covered in any fancy sauce, no fancy EVOO drizzled on top, it's the cleanest fish, crisp and flaky at the same time.  It's a must order at this place.  The caviar/uni french toasts are also top notch.  Uni and caviars are only the icy on the incredibly fluffy and pillow-like french toast squares.  I joked with the chef that he should make them pillow size that I would totally dive in.    Service is great, price is so reasonable, food is amazing.  It's definitely my top restaurant in town and will recommend it to anyone who's looking for a fantastic meal.  I LOVE sashimi/sushi, seafood and good meat.  I think I've found the perfect restaurant for me that I can indulge in everything that's on my favorite list in one meal.  Thank you, Other Mama for making it possible.",

Garlic shrimp, jalapeno crab hushpuppies, and a great selection of fresh oysters did the trick.  Everything was freshly made- sauces, libation infusions, etc. down to the home made tonic water.  Service was friendly and fitting for the atmosphere.  Look forward to coming back soon.",

Place is small and almost 10 table but there are 5-6 waiters are constantly helping you. We tried half chicken and the whole fish. Both they were right on the money. Will try again for other items they have.       So we went back to try again this place today and things changed and we entered the place. Chubby guy with beard gave us a smile and looked  at our kids and changed his mind to not to take us. How ridiculous is that!   He was looking at the reservation list all crossed out and  told us may be 45 mins wait. Really? There were three table were empty and ready to serve but he might not like kids. So you lost almost $150 on the spot and great client you had. So people who has kids find a babysitter before you try this place.",

I did some research on eaterLV and saw the chef was going to best chef in LV this year. Let me tell you that all the dishes we ordered were delicious! The place is nice and dim and the service is super friendly. We wanted to try a bunch of small dishes, oyster shooter, French toast and caviar, uni nigiri, amberjack crudo, live octopus carpaccio, Rockefeller oyster with foie and the sushi roll special. All the flavored were well balanced! The uni they get is ridiculously amazing! Soooo sweet tasting, order that oyster shooter if they have it on the special menu. My favorite was the French toast with caviar... Oooo this dish was heavenly :)",

    "text": "Other Mama is located on Durango, just North of Spring Mountain, inside the same center as restaurants like Norm's and TC's. The restaurant itself is on the small side and somewhat tucked into the back corner of the complex. Inside you'll find a modern, but homey and inviting feel. There's minimal seating alongside a fairly small bar, and I'd imagine there's going to be a wait during peak times...but, it's worth it.  In addition to their regular menu, they've also got a daily special board that hangs on the wall towards the back of the restaurant. It looks like many items rotate, but on our visit there were some non-standard specials, including $1 oysters. There's plenty of options between the two, and even a few things for those who don't eat seafood. Had my stomach been able to take it, I would have likely ordered everything on the menu. Instead, our party of 3 decided to share a few things...  Spicy Edamame - Per my 6 years olds request, we started we these. Solid starter, but they live up to their name. They've got a kick, and were too much for him. I'm a sucker for spicy food though, and couldn't stop eating them. I like that they use a dry seasoning, opposed to a spicy sauce like you find at a lot of other spots.  $1 Bluepoint Oysters - Juicy, plump, delicious...and cheap. We ordered these with two of their sauces, the Pickled Pepper & Habanero, and Ponzu Salsa. Neither did much for my taste. The habanero flavor was basically nonexistent in the first, and although the salsa had great flavor, I didn't think either were complimenting the oyster well. I see their sauces get great praise, so maybe they were just off on our visit?   Oyster Foi Rockefeller - I'm not one to order oyster rockefeller normally, but with foie in the mix, I couldn't resist. Then they came out, we ate them, and asked eachother \"where's the foie?\". I've seen pictures of these, and ours looked like they had maybe half of the foie others had, maybe less. Maybe just off on our visit, but based on it, I wouldn't order them again.  White Fish Ceviche - Paired with perfectly crisped sweet potato chips, this is a must try in my opinion. Unlike the prior sauce, the ceviche had a very present, but enjoyable habanero kick. The fresh cilantro was a nice balance, and they aren't skimpy with the fish. When you run out of chips, it's delicious on it's own...trust me on this one.  Amberjack Crudo - Quite possibly their most popular dish, and for good reason. Fresh, tender fish and a delicious sauce with a little bit of sweetness, and a little kick. This was my first time having amberjack, and thanks to Other Mama, I'm constantly craving it and will order it anytime a restaurant has it.  Live Scallop - Excellent! Sliced thin, but still with a nice, rich, tender and buttery taste. Absolutely delicious on it's own, and so good that even my 6 year old couldn't stop eating it.   Overall, pretty much everything we had was great, and aside from the oyster foie, I'd order everything again in a heartbeat. Must tries in my opinion are the ceviche, amberjack and live scallop.   Unfortunately, our service wasn't quite as excellent. Our waitress seemed a little rushed, like our questions were bothering her. Since we got seated with only a couple other tables full, it was a bit disappointing. We also had one of the bussers take two of our plates that had food on them, without asking if we were done. Just walked straight up to our table, grabbed them quick, and was gone. Our food was up without a hitch, and our drinks stayed full, but service was nothing to write home about.  A few little hiccups, but still an extremely enjoyable experience for me. Other Mama has only been open less than 3 months, and mine is just one of the many of positive reviews that keep flowing in. If you've yet to come here, stop procrastinating.",

The food would taste better and the waiting we wouldn't mind if our waitress was more polite, but that's what we get for waitress that are pale and pretty from all the servers. She does have the only short hair there. And it's not a racist thing, I'm a server for 18 years. When your in Vegas and there are sushi everywhere, but if the server takes care of a customer and makes you feel comfortable, they will always return. Server 101. Not everything is racist. Bad server is a bad server. Give you an example. An appetizer means, small dishes served before your main menu. My appetizer came after the main menu. When the customer's soda is empty, the server could ask if you would like a refill or purchase another drink. I had to flag my server every time I needed a drink. I have a 4 year old with me, she has not perfected her chopsticks skills, so a very good server will provide a to go plastic or spoon without me requesting one. In this case I had to. I think there were 10 tables and 3 tables was occupied, so I don't think they were busy. 1st in 1st out for server, if you don't get it, google will provide the answer.  If the food is taking a little bit longer no problem, servers usually try to bs that the kitchen is a little busy and the server would probably change the subject by conversing with customer. In my case the short hair girl said \" there's other people here so he's cooking other people's food\". This is when 3 of the main menu is on my table , but no appetizer .So I think this is bad service, not racist.",

    "text": "I would normally rate Other Mama four stars but eating, unexpectedly, with freinds from Yelp, and the service and good fun we had with the bartender, this is a five star review.  I was just sitting at the last chair on the right side of the bar area when I saw Philip T and his wife.  I moved one seat and set next to the corner by them and that was the start of a fun dinner with good food and good conversation.  I ordered a half dozen oysters, two Fanny Bay, two Duck Island and two Beau Soleil. The two sauces I ordered were the wasabi cocktail and ponzu salsa.  Being from NY where we generally had the choice of Bluepoint or Bluepoint, it certainly is nice to have a selection to order from.  For the next course, I got the octopus carpaccio.  Then I got the pork belly kim chi fried rice.  For dessert, I opted for the Japanese cheesecake.  The oysters were wonderful.  While the sauces were both good, I think I enjoy my oysters au naturel without any sauce for the most oyster flavor.  The octopus carpaccio was a thing of beauty and very tasty.  The sauce in which the tender slices of octopus were resting was absolutely one of the tastiest I've had.    Next, the pork belly kim chi fried rice was excellent!  It was served blisteringly hot and I recently learned my lesson about carefully moving hot, cast iron serving dishes.  I also learned how to correctly eat this dish.  Remove the pork belly, break the egg on top of the rice, and use the ladle to mix the egg into the rice and then push the rice against the sides of the bowl to get some of the rice to be crispy fried rice.  I learned this by watching Philip's wife who was a master at the technique!  Thanks!  The kim chi is homemade.  It could stand to be spicier for my taste but it was very good.  I finished the meal with Japanese cheesecake at the suggestion of my server, Grazzy!  A good ending to a very good meal.  Not only was the food good, but the service was good also and we had a show by sitting at the bar.  It was interesting to watch the bartender making some exotic drinks including one he made up on the spot.  If you read the drink section of their menu, you read some of the exotic ingredients in their cocktails.  The top shelf of one cabinet behind the bar held a number of jars with his concoctions (I say that in a nice manner) that are used to make different drinks.  He also gave Philip and me a piece of watermelon rind so we could taste what was in the drink of Philip's wife.  The rind had been softening in a blend of his that contained one habanero pepper.  That one pepper was enough to give the rind a spicy afterburner taste, not enough to bother you, but enough to let you know it was there.  Watching him do his thing and chatting with him truly was a show of his craft at cocktail mixing.  In about two hours, I left knowing I'd be back.  The oysters are so good and are priced very reasonably.  There are other menu items I have to try.  Some many choices, so few days in a week!  One final word.  The music was outstanding.

    "text": "When I first saw the restaurant sign outside, I thought it looked like a tattoo parlor. My initial impression when I went inside: Aww, this place is charming, inviting, hipster, and tiny. Luckily, they were able to accommodate us since the place is tiny and it's recommended you make reservations. Good to know for next time.  I was planning on ordering oysters and maybe a dish or two but who am I kidding? When I saw the menu, I wanted pretty much everything on the menu.   The service was great. One of the guys was friendly and happy to talk about the menu items. We ordered all four kinds of oysters (Blue Point, Fanny Bay, Duck Island, and Beau Soleil) with various, unique dipping sauces, pork belly kimchi fried rice, shrimp and jalapenos hush puppies, Chirashi bowl, white fish ceviche, grilled ribeye with miso hollandaise, amberjack crudo, and the caviar and French toast with creme fraiche.  Holy crap! My favorites are the Caviar & French toast. We liked it so much we ordered another one. The grilled ribeye with miso Hollandaise was incredible. I enjoyed the oysters with the different dipping sauces. Everything was delicious but those three items stood out the most for me.  I'm already looking forward to the next time I will be back to get some of my favorites and try the items that I didn't get a chance to order.",

    "text": "OMG, what an AMAZING meal! Ruben and I agree that it was one of the best meals we've had. It's rare that I'm truly excited about so much in one place, but Other Mama is killing it.  I was intrigued by the menu, especially the raw bar. I love raw seafood. Then, I hear that Owner/Chef Dan Krohmer used to work for Morimoto and I'm really interested. I had to check it out right away.  We sat at the bar and chatted with Mixologist David English about the restaurant and mostly about the amazing Libations menu he created with another gentleman. I started with the Vera ($10) composed of Domaine Chandon, Canton Ginger Basil, and St. Germain Elderflower. Fabulous cocktail. As the night wore on, I also tried the Agnes ($9) with Hibiscus Stolichnaya, Cointreau, lemon, and sparkling wine. First of all, it's gorgeous and second, it's delicious. Another home run. English also created an off-the-menu cocktail for me consisting of vodka and fresh cucumber. It complemented some of the seafood I was eating.  The food, oh boy. Summed up: GOOD. REALLY GOOD. Favorites: Live Scallop, Amberjack Crudo, and Grilled Prime Ribeye. I could eat all these dishes again and again. But really, everything is delicious. I can't wait to try everything else!  Raw Oysters: Fanny Bay from BC ($1.50/each), Bluepoint from NY ($1/each), and NY Prime from NY ($2/each). Served with Ponzu Salsa, Blood Orange Mint, and Pickled Peppers & Habanero. Nice selections. I typically avoid East Coast oysters, but these were pleasantly crisp and the sauces were fantastic. The Ponzu Salsa was definitely my favorite.  Live Scallop ($11): This was easily my favorite dish of the evening. The scallop was HUGE and it was phenomenal. Amazing by itself and delicious with a touch of soy sauce and wasabi. There were 3 scallops available; we had 2 of them. Hopefully they have more scallops the next time I come in!  Live Surf Clam ($13): Two parts of the clam were served separately, the meat and the flesh. This was just okay for me, but Ruben really enjoyed it.   White Fish Ceviche ($13): Served with sweet potato chips. Fantastic ceviche and a really nice portion, too. Also, I am not a fan of sweet potato, but these chips were delicious!  Shrimp & Mint ($9): Wrapped with cucumber and topped with Ikura. Amazing!! This was easily one of our group's favorites; we couldn't get enough.  Amberjack Crudo ($11): Um, wow! I'm a fan of sashimi crudo type dishes and this one is up there. Amazing, amazing flavors. The fish was divine and the blood orange ponzu salsa was perfect. This was another group favorite.  Oyster Foi Rockefeller ($15): This was a Chef-recommended dish that I would have never ordered on my own and it blew my mind. They use freshly-shucked oysters for these delicious treats. It makes all the difference.  Spicy Yuzu Chicken Wings ($13): Fried chicken is all about the batter. This batter was light and crunchy, plus it was flavorful. I didn't get the yuzu, but I liked the spicy sauce on the wings that weren't overbearing and not too spicy.  Pork Belly Kimchi Fried Rice ($11): Kimchi usually sucks at restaurants and I'm ultra critical of Korean food, so I was surprised that this rice was decent. **Note: I love the side order of Kimchi Fried Rice (without the pork belly). It's more my thing as it's more moist without the hot pot. Of course, I love the sunny side-up egg!   Grilled Prime Ribeye ($27): Served with Miso Hollandaise and Waffle Fries. OH. MY. GOSH. The steak was cooked PERFECTLY, so that already got my attention. But it's the miso hollandaise that pushed it over the edge - it's GOOD. Oh, and those waffle fries? Geez.  PBR Seafood Hot Pot ($21): A delicious broth with white fish, shrimp, scallop, mussels, and bok choy. This was another unsuspecting dish that was really great. The seafood was cooked perfectly and the broth was so fragrant! Delicious.  Desserts: Chocolate Pot De Creme ($6), Japanese Cheesecake w/ Raspberry Mint Sauce ($6), and Housemade Ice Creams - Vanilla Bean, Chocolate Chili, and Vermont Maple Syrup Walnut ($2/each). The Chocolate Pot De Creme was delicious! I also enjoyed all the ice creams. I didn't like the cheesecake at first, but now, I'm a fan. It's light, almost the consistency of Angel Food Cake, but still manages to have a moist typical cake-like texture. Its subtle flavor is always paired with a perfectly sweet fruit sauce.  Service was beyond fantastic. Everyone was very nice and attentive. Waters constantly filled, drinks replenished, dishes cleared, and plates/silverware continuously replaced. What a spot! You need to get here! Best time to dine is when they open at 5pm; get a seat because it fills up quickly!  *UPDATE* Favorite dishes: White Fish Ceviche, Big Eye Tuna Poke, Organic Chicken, Grilled Prime Ribeye, Kimchi Fried Rice, Chirashi, Caviar French Toast, and Beef Carpaccio w/ Uni.  Favorite ice cream/sorbet flavors: Miso Honey, Vietnamese Iced Coffee, Jameson & Ginger.",

    "text": "I have certainly had better, especially at these prices.   Fried lobster, grilled branzino, salmon sashimi salad, deviled eggs, tuna sashimi, and a cocktail for $105. Was i satisfied when i left? Not really, as i have had far better meals for half the price for two. The best of the dishes for me was the deviled eggs at $11, but Carson's Kitchen's eggs are better and for less money. The grilled branzino was the typical preparation of lemon and rosemary in the center and grilled which i do myself at home, so i expect to have something a bit more when i come to a restaurant known for creativity? Salmon salad was, just ok as i didn't feel like the greens added much if anything to the small cuts of salmon. Yonaka does a salmon with micro greens with larger cuts of fish and more balance, and again for less money. Fried lobster was tasty, but as another mentioned certainly not worth the price tag for the size of the serving.   I think there is a theme to my review, which is i see/taste your food and i have had better and for less elsewhere. I will pay the money for the right meal and return regularly at that, but this was one of those meals that left me feeling unsatisfied. Maybe the happy hour gets a lot of play, and that's where a lot of the hype comes from so maybe give that a look. But for my dinner on this night, it just wasn't working for me. Side note, our waitress was quiet friendly and was pleasant during our visit.",

    "text": "[This review is mainly focusing on the Happy Hour.]  So my search for great off-the-strip cuisine continued with Other Mama. Although the drive is a bit further out that I expected, the restaurant is fantastic.   +First off, service was SUPER friendly and awesome. Thank you to all the staff who really were quite nice and helpful including (apologies if I get your names wrong) Brittany - the sashimi master, David - the skilled mixologist, and Julie - the Puzzle Fighter aficionado.  Loved how at the bar, you have a full view of the way the kitchen runs and the bar. Love also the interaction/super chill atmosphere (definitely on the darker side indoors).   +Food-wise, the Happy Hour had about 10 unique items to try out along with HH $1 oysters for the later night crowd. I ate WAY too much but had a lot of the items here so counting them down below (about $8-10 each):  *Octopus Ceviche & Spicy Tuna Tartare: Starting off with both of these first because they came in last when I should have stopped eating. Think both were really interesting takes. Something to note is that the Waffle Fries are more reminiscent of chips. Personally, I preferred the sweet potato chips (and although full, I think I preferred the Octopus Ceviche) but not too bad overall.  *Amberjack: A great try to get a taste of their raw selection. Really good quality fish in a sashimi style presentation.  *Calamari: The calamari was very solid and was very surprised it didn't come with an aioli sauce of some kind. In the end, it didn't need any sauce because the calamari was super flavorful and spiced well.  *Deviled Eggs: The fried oyster on top of the deviled eggs were fantastic and think this stood out as my favorite dish of the bunch. Very memorable.  *Their house wines and a few beers are also on happy hour pricing for about $5 as a heads-up. I did get one of their cocktails, which I believe was the Vivian. Delicious and surprisingly strong with unique spirits to boot. Definitely worth a look-see.    (The full dinner menu definitely seems to be full of really fascinating and more full takes on the HH menu - something I can't wait to try in the future.) +On a Saturday evening, it wasn't too busy when I went although I did call ahead to RSVP just in case. There's both plentiful bar and table seating. Parking-wise, there was a private lot.   +/- One random note, if you do have a Lyft/Uber driver looking for the place or driving yourself, at least in the late afternoon, the sign was a little hard to read. When you go into the plaza, just make sure to take your time and look near the end of the plaza after going in to find the location.   Hope to come back again to take on the full dinner menu. Cheers Other Mama.",

Ordered: -Beef carpaccio -Sashimi platter -Spicy yuzu chicken wings -Rib eye prime and waffle fries -Japanese cheesecake -Ice cream (miso honey , strawberry , and tamarind)  Nothing wrong with the food, but also nothing very special. Very expensive for what it is. Service was also a bit slow - we asked for ketchup for the waffle fries and it never came , was gonna flag down our waitress again but she was never found. We ate all the waffle fries anyways before we got to her again. She just completely forgot about it. Japanese cheesecake was a bit disappointing. The only thing that stood out to me (besides the medium rare rib eye prime that was cooked to perfection) was the miso honey ice cream , it had a unique taste.  Total bill was 100$+ , and for a party of 4 they were able to split the bill no problem. Left pretty hungry still though. This is the type of place to just order for taste/presentation.  Might come back to try the oysters and drinks.",

This seafood sushi fusion restaurant is pretty small but cozy probably accommodates 50 people max.  I arrived in time for Happy Hour which is my favorite dirty word!! Reservations recommended although I was able to walk right in. I love the open kitchen bar seating because you can observe the cooks creating masterpieces. The service is fast and the servers are extremely efficient and polite.  What We Ordered: Spicy Tuna Tartare W/Waffle Fries  -Not spicy but fresh and definitely flavorful. I'm a French fry fanatic so I appreciated this fusion. Shishito, Cauliflower & Pistachio:  -The cauliflower was pretty bland & served in tiny pieces almost mike crumbs  Hush Puppies W/Blue Crab Jalapeno  -Served nice and hot! Pretty delicious  Rhode Island Calamari, Hollandaise Pickled Pepper -Best Calamari I've devoured in a while. Crisp golden brown and equally delicious.  Kimchi Fried Rice (W/O Pork) -The Kimchi rice was my favorite dish hands down. I love Kimchi and this rice did not disappoint. I love the chef stayed True the authentic Kimchi taste! Chicken Fried Lobster -I was pretty full close to full by this time none the less the Lobster was great and the presentation was awesome! Sashimi  -Another fresh delicious dish Honey Miso Ice Cream -Highly recommended by a server and this ice cream did not disappoint! Two Glasses of wine   Total: $109.00  I'll totally be back!!!",

    "text": "Yeah, this is my kind of place. A raw bar with oysters as the headliner and a full bar highlighted by a list of creative cocktails. The food menu is relatively short, but every single item looked delicious and I could have easily just closed my eyes, pointed my finger on the menu, and would have been pleased with whatever it landed on. Every item we had was delicious and we placed two extra orders of food after our initial order because we couldn't get enough.  Expecting a wait when we came at 8:30 on Saturday night, we were pleasantly surprised when we were able to sit at the table directly in front of the specials board. The board being in plain view was the primary reason for our extra orders. We were greeted immediately and were given excellent service by the team of servers for the entirety of the meal. There were no issues with the kitchen as everything was timely and with the kitchen being open, we could easily view how our orders were progressing.  We ordered 7 items along with 18 oysters (blue point, Wicomico, and otter cove priced at $1.50, $1, and $2.50 per oyster respectively) served with three different mignonettes. My wife had the dozen East Coast oysters and I had the half dozen briny, otter cove oysters which I thought went very well with the ponzu salsa provided. You're not going to find the selection of oysters of Other Mama, that are priced this fairly, anywhere else in the city, or at least I haven't found anything comparable yet.  My other favorites were the mackerel sashimi, yuzu panna cotta, and the cocktail, Sofia. We probably would have tried another dessert but we decided to pull the plug when we saw the kitchen starting to close everything down. Chef Dan made his way to our table, kindly greeted us, and we briefly conversed. Dinner for two that night before tip was $150 which I have no problem with and would have no problem driving across town again. On the next trip, I'll keep an eye out for any new specials or oysters and will make my way through the rest of the raw items that I haven't sampled.",

Vegas had still been looking for a food identity, and with its opening a wave of independent highly trained chefs came in to the city building a vibrant nascent food scene . The cooked dishes here, like the branzino, lobster, and deviled eggs are great (even the steak is solid)! But what this restaurant really is about is high quality raw seafood, from the Japanese preparations of all of their fresh and rotating seafoods to their amberjack crudo and tartare, this is an absolutely killer raw bar  that emphasizes good ingredients, immersive service, and awesome ambience. It's so simple, yet so memorable.",

    "text": "I've heard of other mama through friends and family. I had a clue where it was, but this place is pretty hidden I don't think plenty of people know about it!   My first impression: wow, the artwork on the walls are pretty cool. And that open kitchen is so unique. The ambience of the place was nice, but it is a small little spot. I had the impression that this place was Italian but when reading the menu I felt like they were more of a seafood/ sushi place.   My boyfriend's the one who took me here. So I let him order.   He ordered  - 2 orders of salmon sashimi  - 1 order of raw scallop sashimi  - kimchi fried rice  -calamari   LET ME TELL YOU!! The scallop sashimi was PERFECT. It melted so softly in my mouth with a bomb of beautiful flavors. If I could order 20 of those I would (but this place is pretty pricey)  And the kimchi fried rice snuck up on me with how flavorful it was. I'm warning you that at the first bite it was sour... but when you take a bite of it with the meat. The flavors made sense! -- these were the foods that stood out most to me.   The only downside I had to say was that it was pretty warm in there. Not sure if it's because we were seated at the bar close to the open kitchen, but I tended to fan myself a lot because of the heat.   Overall, unique and different experience with great service.",

Only to be told by the hostess that she was \"holding\" 2 seats.  Great, conflicting information, a wasted trip in the rain, and a missed opportunity to enjoy one of my favorite restaurants.

The paper menu rarely changes and has a few staples that i absolutely love .. deviled eggs.. hush puppies ... and my all time fav of the amberjack crudo - seriously great eats... and then they have a rotating menu they have written on a chalk board .. oysters always great and their drink menu seems to change with the seasons ( get the Bianca while it's still on the menu*trust me)  It has a great vibe and it's nice and intimate. Never feels rowdy or too loud and the waiters are typically on point throughout your meal. I've never had a bad experience here. I'm personally looking forward to more crudo and more oysters",

Our waitress was nice, the only issue was the lack of menu knowledge and enthusiasm from the server, she was more like a \"meh\" attitude, I don't expect jumps and extreme smiles, but as a first time client I would really appreciate a better menu description when ordering.   Really like the food, beautiful flavors. The french toast caviar is a MUST!  Really enjoyed the kimchi fried rice, Sashimi and the ceviche were fresh and delicious .

Every item we tried I LOVED, not like but LOVED!   Calamari- best calamari I have ever had. It had some spice to it. It wasn't rubbery, it was cooked perfect.   Ceviche- this has octopus, shrimp, white fish and the best part.. habanero. It was so good! That habanero really made this ceviche unique from the others. It came with sweet potato chips. Yum.  Waffle fries- just cooked perfect it was Crispy not oily and just enough.   Deviled eggs- this had a twist though. There was a fried oyster on top. That was a little different. My friends thought it was weird but I enjoyed it.   They have a board that has their specials. The waitress told me that they are daily specials and it literally is Daily. You might see it now and never see it again. One daily special was the Blue Crab hand roll and that was freakin bomb. I'm drooling just thinking about it. It was simple, and it was spicy!   My friend got the Prime New York steak and that was so good as well. The steak was swimming in a miso sauce that was to die for and the steak was cooked to perfection.   All the foods just had so much flavor, so much spice! Everything I tried had a bit of kick to it and I wasn't complaining! I love spicy foods.   Dessert- I ordered the Nutella ice cream that had real Hazelnut chunks in it! That topped off my meal. So good!   Oh and the specialty drinks! bomb. I got the Penelope. It was a good drink it was strong but didn't taste strong.  I will be returning very soon!",

Allen was our server and he was very helpful for providing us details on Oysters and the Specials of the Day.  We ordered a dozen Oysters; a combination of Nisqually, Calm Cove, and Snow Creek oysters. My favorite oyster this night was the Nisqually, but I also really enjoyed the Snow Creek. Our oysters were paired with a bottle of Hakkaisan Sake... slightly sweet, light, crisp and clean...a nice pairing for the posters and Nigiri that would follow.  Next we placed 2 orders of the Nigiri Combination, one for me and one for my love. The Nigiri Combination came with Big Eye Tuna, Amber Jack, Salmon, Fluke, Octopus, Ocean Trout and Stripe Jack. These seem to be fairly consistent options. The Ocean Trout and Stripe Jack were so good that we just had to order more of them.  Our meal was finished with the Grilled Octopus from the Specials menu....look for it on the upcoming fall menu...we were debating between Lobster Tostada and our server Allen made a strong suggestion for us that we were very glad we took.  The music surrounding our time at Other Mama was so perfect...and we will certainly sit again at the bar watching chef Dan Krohmer and Stan working their magic for us...thank you both...and of course Allen.",

    "text": "Even though I only really came here for the oysters, I was a bit disappointed with the overall experience. Let me preface that I really do try to go to local spots during my trips to Vegas because the usual places on the strip get old after a while.   I was really looking forward to the $1-$2 oysters that I saw in some other reviews online. When I got there, every oyster was $2.5. I'm not going to complain too much of not having cheap oysters because these were very fresh. They also had a variety of 6 I believe when I went. I got 3 of each and it was a great appetizer. One of the sauces that came with the oysters was also amazing.  We got a variety of the entrees and none really stood out. I got the steak and fries that are basically in every review of the place, but it isn't something to write home about.   I loved the decor and it really made the restaurant stand out once you got inside. Overall, I doubt that I will come back but I am glad I tried it.",

The quality of craft and ingredient make it one of the best values in town ... servers know what they're talking about and care about your experience... definitely a change of pace, it's a breath of fresh air in a town full of copycat-cookie cutter dining spots. Not necessarily a special occasion spot but if you are hungry and adventurous this is a great spot. Check it out.",

Hush puppies were a table favorite you can see and taste the crab in them, they're also served with a tasty aioli. Another favorite was the octopus ceviche, which was a nice break from the hush puppies and it's fried goodness.   What I really want to focus on the review is the deluxe sashimi combo. The fish and other items were so beyond fresh. My favorite items were the uni, amberjack and tuna. So fresh and it's amazing to taste how differently each dish can be.   Anyhow just go and try this place out. You won't be disappointed.",

I've already been here a few times and I can honestly say it's my favorite go to restaurant when I am craving seafood.  I am a seafood fanatic. Let me start off by saying that they have 1$ oysters on Mondays.  Freshest oysters I have ever had, and I'll be coming very often for my oyster cravings. When I come I  usually get the amberjack sashimi (usually more then one order).  It's so fresh and the sauce on it is so delicious. Also if you like salmon, the salmon sashimi or the salmon salad are both so fresh and good, and the salad is the salmon belly. I also recommend the blue crab appetizer or the blue crab hand roll or the blue crab hush puppies.  The shishito pepper with cauliflower is a appetizer winner, be carful though, some of them might be spicy and some not.  The pokes are also very good and you can get sweet potato chips or waffles chips, they have tuna or salmon poke.  I am also a huge fan of uni, uni has to be fresh and you'll know based on color. Every time I order uni here it is fresh and delicious.  So when I come here I'll order the oyster with uni and ikura on top (to die for!) or uni sashimi is also a favorite. I like that this place has a  very appetizer like menu, it helps with trying different yummy things and not over eat.  Every time I have been here my waitress has always been Amber. She is very sweet and will recommend good things if you ask.  Listen to her, she has not disappointed us yet.",

Well, we finally made it back again, and by we and I mean I actually joined them this time. Holy cow is this place good!  Think small plates, fresh oysters, and incredibly well-made cocktails.  The stand-out for me was the deviled eggs with fried oyster, followed by the shishito peppers, cauliflower and pistachio.  The octopus was well prepared, just a bit bland for my taste.  I was looking for something refreshing and not to sweet, so the recommendation was the Billie Joe.  Spot on! Gin, maraschino, mint, rose-water, cucumber, and lime. It was a complex drink made to perfection. Definitely a do over for me!  Ready for some oysters?  Oh man, you've gotta try the Svetlana with it - horseradish vodka, lemon, ginger syrup, and Becherovka (herbal bitters made in the Czech Republic).  This is a pairing made in heaven!  Enjoy!",

    "text": "\"I'm a Mother Lover You're a Mother Lover We should...\" - The Lonely Island  Other Moma has become a routine stop for us. You will typically find us here because of their raw bar.  They consistently have a good selection of oysters... often at a cheaper than most places in town. Some of our favorite oysters that we've had the opportunity to partake in at Other Moma have included Beausoleil, Kumamoto, Kusshi, and Pickering Pass. Additionally, they have Nigiri and Sashimi sushi that is better than all but the best sushi spots in town...to this point, I can't stop in without ordering some Ocean Trout or Amber Jack Nigiri.  Aside from the Raw Bar, the menu is very good in general... lots of choices you'll be happy with...but perhaps lacking a signature dish that demands my return. Still, because the whole menu is so strong, we usually share several of the smaller dishes for a chance to taste more options. We often enjoy one of their Pokes as well as their Cauliflower with Shishito Peppers. I've been pointed to the Amberjack Crudo on more than one occasion, and found it enjoyable and satisfying, but just not so much that I rave about it to others, still it's worth ordering, especially with a friend or for sharing. If you decide to go for one of their entrees I'd recommend the Grilled Branzino...wonderfully prepared and of excellent quality,   I have been enjoying sake on more recent trips, but the first positive impression that lingered after my initial visit to Other Moma was how good their cocktails were. They do a good job of achieving balanced drinks that are alcohol forward...syrups used in proportion to elevate the drinks, rather than make a cheap liquor palatable.    You could argue the setting to be hipster since we as a culture are still throwing that word around, but regardless of your take on that opinion, it is a setting that has been thought through and feels to fit right in with a menu that is borrowing from different culinary perspectives and presenting engaging and original options that are delicious.   ...a solid 4 stars...worth checking out!",

The team here is really putting forth an amazing effort. Sashimi platters are s great value. Calamari, Cauliflower, Asparagus dishes were all solid. Miso honey ice cream is fantastic.  Thank you!",

    "text": "I've been here several times and I'm always impressed by the quality and creativity of the dishes.    Over the course of multiple visits, I've been able to try a bunch of items.  Here are the favorites (in no particular order): - Spicy Tuna Tartare.   Tune is flavored perfectly and the thin, fresh and crispy waffle fries are the  perfect accompaniment.     - Sashimi Combo.  It's nicely presented, the fish is delicious and cut very well.  Also, it's a good value at $19.    - Grass Fed Beef Carpaccio.  Thin and tender slices of beef.  Really tasty and the parm crisps add a nice layer of texture and flavor.   1/2 Organic Chicken.  The chicken was cooked to perfection, crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. It comes sliced, which really helps for sharing.   It's the roast chicken I wish I could make at home.  Also, the shishito peppers and fingerling potatoes give you the much needed side of greens and comfort.    Specials:  These aren't on the regular menu, so I will do my best to remember the ingredients.  Mushroom Tempura - This dish was delicious!  The batter lent just the right amount of texture over the delicate mushrooms.  Not too greasy, not too doughy...  In the words of Goldilocks, it was just right.    Alaskan Salmon Sashimi - It was sweet, there was basil, I don't remember much else except I could've ordered this 5 more times and called it the meal.  Unique flavors that don't always come with sashimi.  It was a total win.    Spicy Salmon, Tempura Asparagus, fluke and shiso leaf Cut Roll- I can confidently say that this was one of the best rolls I've ever had.  I tend to lean traditional when it comes to sushi (not into the whole cream cheese thing) and this was such a great combination of flavors.  The secret weapon was the shiso leaf - the sweet and peppery finish was perfect.    Ambiance - A Can't imagine how they could've improved that space, inside of a random strip mall.  Love the setting around the bar.  During some summer days, they had some A/C issues, but that won't be a problem as we enter the winter months.  The playlist on our recent visit was nice, some classic blues.    Service: A Consistent attention, always checked to make sure each dish was to our liking, drinks were always being refilled.    See you guys again soon.",

Most restaurants serving small dishes to share are hit or miss, but Other Mama hit it out of the park. Highest quality and care in the execution and presentation.  With each plate, the praise was universal.  Sashimi - so fresh, the tuna really melted in your mouth. Fresh wasabi too.  Oysters - wow! So fresh and flavorful. Fun to try the different varieties.  Crab tostada - I could have ordered this again. The tortilla alone was delicious.  Ceviche - more of a salsa, but sweetened with mango with a little spice. Really tasty.  Chicken fried lobster - perfectly cooked, soft and succulent lobster bits.  Mussels - small but packed with flavor. If I was to quibble about anything, I really wish they had some soft bread with which to sop up the delectable broth which otherwise went to waste.  Caviar french toast - a decadent yet delicate combo, couldn't get enough of it.  You truly cannot go wrong here. Loved it! I will be recommending Other Mama to everyone.",

What makes it worth the 5 stars is the food and the service.  I had again just flown back to Vegas and had been on the United diet all day so I was starved for some good food.      We started off with 12 Holy Grail oysters.  They were sweet and very fresh tasting.  The sauces were a great compliment but the Wasabi Cocktail sauce was the favorite.  We also has the Tuna Poke which was really good.  The hush puppies were unique and delicious.  We had a couple of drinks from the bar - Agnes and Beryl which were like pretty tasty.    For the main course we had the Oyster Rockefeller which was also very good.  Their oysters are very fresh tasting which is really important in the taste.  We also had the Nigiri Sushi Tasting, Kim Chi Fried Rice and PBR Hot Pot.  The Sushi was fresh and delicious.   The Kim Chi Fried Rice was very good and not overwhelmed by the Kim Chi.  The PBR Hot Pot was the wife's choice and she loved it.      Our server was Santina and she was great.  We felt well taken care of and really enjoyed her fun personality.  The bar staff was excellent and helped with our drink choices.  The restaurants slightly dim lighting which adds to the ambiance.  The dining area was well cleaned and inviting.  We had a great time and look forward to another fantastic visit to Other Mama's!",

The decor and wait staff uniforms conveyed casual dining but the cuisine and pricing was upscale which was a little confusing.   The first 2 dishes, Amberjack and oysters Rockefeller were great. The second 2 dishes were disappointing. The crab hushpuppies with jalapenos had zero jalapeno flavor, which would have made them less dense. The beef carpaccio was very bland. We also had deviled eggs and calamari, both good dishes. The dessert was a nice finish to the meal.   I will probably return. They had a chalkboard of specials we didn't order from and the restaurant is close to where I live.",

If you like oysters you can't go wrong with the oysters -- Save room for dessert their ice cream is homemade and the miso honey flavor and Nutella flavors are stupid good! This is a hidden gem in Vegas not to be over looked. The servers were beyond attentive and so knowledgeable--- ohh I almost forgot the craft cocktails are just as good as the food.

We ordered the shishito peppers & cauliflower for appetizers and that was a good start to prepare my pallet for what we were expecting to come with the main dishes.  As well as the viviana 12 cocktail was amazing and gave an instant buzz.    For our main meal we ordered the garlic shrimp from the daily specials board and also the kimchi fried rice with pork belly off the regular menu.  The flavor and taste of the garlic shrimp was mediocre and did not satisfy my taste buds.  The kimchi fried rice seemed to have too much vinegar and souriness.   The pork belly was sort of bland and didn't have the seasoning I was expecting.  The service was great and didn't wait too long for our food to be served.  Overall,  I'll try this place again ordering different dishes and hopefully I can change my review to 5 stars.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, the food network and the ease of yelp has allowed some individuals to believe they are experts on everything food/restaurant related. It has empowered such folks to also moonlight as occasional \"professional\" negative food critics in the comfort of their own homes when they can't muster up the gonads to fix or address something at the dining establishments they so frequently have issues with. I'm usually busy reading and replying to my own restaurants' reviews that I rarely if ever have been able to or find the time to review a fellow restauranteur, but this was long overdue....  To give Other Mama anything LESS than 5 stars in my opinion is ridiculous. These guys have consistently surpassed my expectations on every visit. The seafood is bar none the freshest you will find in the desert. Period. No matter what day I arrive, the chef/owner is there without fail. In the trenches, hands on, with his team, as it should be and it shows. The place is too small for pretentiousness and there is a relaxed yet attentive vibe that permeates throughout the staff and into the menu. Everything can be witnessed from the careful preparation of each dish to the service, all seen by the owner, so it would be a shock to me if a customer had an issue that it wouldn't be corrected immediately.  I've worked in every single aspect of restaurants for 30 years and if anyone needs to be impressed, it's me. I look for every crack in the system, not to critique, but because it's in my blood.... And I'm telling you, these guys kill it. Every detail is touched upon. Do yourself a favor, go here. Sit at the bar and try to prove me wrong. You will thank me. Cheers.",

    "text": "What a find! I come to Vegas once a year to visit family and when choosing a place to eat out, the focus is on local joints that deliver high quality unprocessed food. The owner and waitstaff were warm + knowledgable about the menu. The locals seemed to be repeat customers and enjoyed the vibe. If you are looking to go off the LV tourist beaten path and enjoy seafood that rivals that overpriced strip, this place is well worth the drive!",

    "text": "worth the drive and money to dine here. fresh and raw. delicious! got at 2 dozen of oysters (3 bucks under for them) amberjack was tasty with the salsa or sauce on the dish. it was not fishy at all.  Tuna tartar was good except for the crispy waffle--it was small thin, over fried and salted. kinda disappointed that it doesn't taste like fries but potatoes chips. still a good balance i guess.  hand roll spicy tuna and salmon was great, not fishy. the Japanese cheesecake was dry....never have one before to compare but the raspberry sauce helps a little w the cake.  overall,  it's a decent cozy bar to spend the evening.",

It was close to the house, so I was up for a night of something different. I got just that....Wow!! The dishes, from the appetizers to the steak, were amazing. The custom cocktails were out of this world tasty.  I honestly did not expect much from the look of it on the outside. Inside, however, is a night of drinking and dining that is truly an experience to not miss. Do yourself a favor and check it out.",

I recommend the grilled octopus and an assortment of their east and west coast oysters. If seafood isn't your thing, their steak with miso sauce is amazing. They have a great bar with a great selection of whiskey including Japanese whiskeys and a unique cocktail menu. Service is always on point as well.",

We also had the Japanese cheesecake and cocoanut sorbet for dessert. Everything was delicious! I will definitely be back and so will my boyfriend :)",

    "text": "This was our third visit to Other Mama. Our son was in town from Austin and this was our top spot to show off our relatively new food city. We ordered the Asian wings, the tuna tartare, the branzino, and rib-eye steak. When we ran out of waffle fries, the waiter brought out more. We relished every bite. We love the casual neighborhood feel of this restaurant. At first, the waiter didn't think there was any fish left and we were so disappointed, but alas, he found one for us. I love the lemony taste and the fresh rosemary. This time, we did not order drinks, which can really raise the bill. We will save that for happy hour visits. This restaurant is a must for any foodie.",

    "text": "The short version:  If I were rating solely the food, it would be 4.5/5 stars.  The service, due to wait times (legit 20 minutes) for the last two courses, a cocktail that never arrived, and overcharges for items that were not rectified brings it down to a 3/5 stars for me.   After raving about Other Mama for months, my boyfriend and I stopped in for dinner this Monday evening around 6. There were only a couple of parties seated at tables as well as at the bar, so we were seated quickly. It's their 1 year anniversary so they had some oysters marked for $1 each along with regularly priced oysters, daily specials, and a regular menu. We started to order right away, since there was a movie at 8 that we wanted to see.  The mixed sashimi plate was delicious and super fresh, as were the first round of a dozen oysters (whatever was the $1 option) and half a dozen Beau Soleil. Our server recommended the perfect sauces for our oysters. The waffle fries are really crispy and well-seasoned. The razor clams are not fresh like I expected, but breaded and fried calamari style. My cocktail had good flavor.  Unfortunately, our final course of Blue Point oysters (recently changed to $1 each) took over 20 minutes to arrive, and my second cocktail never did. At this point in the evening, most of the table were filled up and there was only one team of server/ runner working the main dining area. I understand that it's a popular restaurant and would naturally have busier times, but this really brought down the experience for us. Finally we asked for the check and when it arrived, noticed that we'd been charged the regular price for our first and second rounds of $1 oysters.   We let our server know about the error and that the second cocktail hadn't been delivered, and he promised to correct the check. We didn't have more time to sit and wait since it was approaching our movie time, but still tipped a full 20%. We left and expected it to be taken care of.  My boyfriend checked his bank account today and noticed that he was charged the full amount. We enjoy dining out and spending money on great food and service, so this was pretty disappointing. We may return in a couple months since he food was very tasty, but for now it's left a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended).",

Hush puppies are bite size, good crab and jalapeno flavor, go great with the chimichurri sauce they come with; deviled eggs taste like deviled eggs, the fried oyster on top was a nice crunchy addition.  Had the ceviche---came with sweet potato chips, good combo, sweet mango flavor in the chunky ceviche. Also ordered the steak with miso hollandaise and waffle fries---awesome combo, steak was cooked right, super tender and the fries were crunchy. Loved the flavor in the kimchee fried rice. And...   Going back tonight and looking forward to it...",
