    "text": "Honestly..... the Food kinda sucked. The Mac salad was probably the best thing on my plate. The boneless short rib was little tiny hard pieces and way over cooked. Kalua pork was maybe the worst I've ever had. Chicken Katsu was over cooked and hard. If you want a real plate lunch this place is not for you. The dude behind the counter was slow and needed help. Our order took hella long to come out. I hate driving home pissed I spent my money on something I didn't enjoy. We also ordered two ice creams and while we were waiting a man asked for a sample for his daughter and the girl gave him one the same size as what we paid for, before we even got ours! How about fusing your food and service with some quality.",

    "text": "This was my first visit at Fist of Fusion.  I was running late for work.  Decided to try them out. I placed an order over the phone.  I arrived about 10 mins later. My order was ready within 5 mins of my arrival. I ordered a Notorious RIB taco ($2.99), an Island mango chicken taco ($2.99) and a Mixed plate ($9.99): my choice of protein was Notorious RIB x2 +$1 per serving, 2 scoops rice, stir fry vegetables and salad for my 2 sides. Overall order with tax was $19.43.  The chicken was good by itself.  If I have to come back I'll order just plain chicken with just the mango-avocado salsa. The beef short ribs were too sweet for me.  I would have liked it to be a bit less sweet. I couldn't put enough lemon to kill the sweet taste.  Then again it is Hawaiian.  duh! The stir fry vegetables were mostly onions and red peppers and came with 1 slice of green zucchini and 1 slice of yellow zucchini.  They forgot to add the kimchi salsa on my Notorious RIB bowl.    Yes this place is good to hang out and chill.  I'm glad I tried this place out before I took my family and friends here. When I'm hungry and it's convenient I'll come back for another try.",

Even then, the only thing I liked was their Yelp Check-in special of the crispy pork belly.  Everything was a pretty healthy meh.  I got a rice bowl, with the short ribs and the kalua Sisig (based on the recommendation of the cashier) with brown rice, with mac salad and grilled pineapple.  Everything in the bowl was a meh, and my SO def was not impressed.  Liked: Crispy pork belly as a free check in  Disliked: pretty much everything I paid for  Considering the price, quantity, and quality, I rather pay double at Island Flavor, but get twice as much and at a taste and quality that don't make me regret my purchase.",

    "text": "BS + I really tried to like you guys.  I really truly did.  I just left this place today and had to write a fresh review in my brain unlike their side salad.  I been dying to come here since December.  I read about the sisig always running out and at 12pm I couldn't believe you guys don't have it.  Ok first, let's talk about the location and space.  The place is in the corner of Buffalo (in a little strip where 7 Eleven and Sola Salon can be found) hidden in a corner.  The bad thing is there is a new building erecting in front of it and it will block the sign when you are driving by.  It will literally cock block the restaurant.  The place has parking all over it but it's packed.   When you come in you will notice how tiny it is.  57 seating capacity but tighter than a virgin elephant's butt.  I mean you are squeezed in a table.  It's still nice to see the wall paintings and signs.  It's chill.   There are three TV's in picture frames which is so 2000's.  They are blasting Hawaiian artist on them.  The restrooms are super clean and nice.  The decor of the place is nice including the tiles and facade bamboo in front of cabinets.  The waitress who took our order was super smiley and nice.  She repeats your order which is nice.    So now for the bad parts of the rating.  First, you have to line up by the cashier to purchase the food.  Then you have to get up when your name is called to pick up your food.  Something like an IN-AND-OUT.  Which I think kills my experience here off the bat.  I messed up orders because people in my party of 6 wanted a lot of food.  I mean the menu is not huge but the food selections \"seems\" yummy.  So, 20 minutes later they call us.  I ordered the loco moco - super disappointed.  It was served on brown rice which is dope but and it's a huge BUT the beef patties were overcooked and gravy tasted burnt.  It was a 9 out of 10 on the SALT SCALE.  Like seriously salty even  to kill a snail with no contact.  I also ordered the CHEETO corn - it was my first time ordering it and it was fun to eat.  I enjoyed that part.  My father-in-law ordered the Notorious PIG taco - super dry meat and the veggies look old.  Then the infamous SIDE SALAD.  Holy crap for $3.99 all I got was chopped lettuce in a small plastic container.  Are you serious with this? not even a tomato? Carrots? an olive? Damn.  He also ordered corn and he said it was messy but I think he was ok with it.  My sister-in-law ordered some fried chicken since the sisig was sold out.  She said this place was subpar.  She also ordered the corn - regular.  She liked it.  My wife ordered the tofu dish which was average.  She barely ate it since the tofu didn't taste fresh.  My brother in law ordered the Notorious PIG burrito which was huge.  Looked fun to eat.  He was more happy about being there since the decor was nice.  Overall, this place was average in the food if you are not used to eating at spots like ISLAND FLAVORS or my second choice OHANA.  Which to me holds the highest regard for authentic Hawaiian dishes.  I love that place but I wanted to check out local spots.  I heard lots of great things  about this place and really wanted to like the whole FILIPINO-HAWAIIAN fusion thing.  But to me they did an ok job. SORRY GUYS! Hopefully the menu changes.  I wanted to give this place a BS + just because of this and the corn.  I was really not happy  with my food and I hope they listen to this plead.  MAKE YOUR BEEF BIGGER and LESS SALT!!!!  * Boomsauce scale. BW = Dis $@% is BASURA! (Garbage).  Not recommended. BS = it's just O.K. (experience) BS+ = Yo! I like this place. BS++= That's Whoa! This place good. BS+++= Dayumm! This place is fkn DOPE! it's fresh",

Nice small place...clean and lady behind register was friendly.   I ordered mixed rice bowl with kalbi and chicken katsu to-go. I gotta say I was kinda disappointed when I got home. They forgot my katsu sauce which is annoying cuz without sauce it just ain't the same. The kalbi was little too salty for my taste. Mac salad was fine. The portions were small compared to other Hawaiian food spots around town. They gave a lot of rice and sides to make it seem like a lot. Sucks that it wasn't a good experience cuz I live nearby n would keep coming back if food was good.",

Despite the cashier not knowing what he was doing and needing two people and a calculator to figure out that our change was $20.00, everything else was good.  The food was really tasty and lots of flavor. We tried their chicken katsu, short ribs, shrimp plate and the pork belly.  It was really good. We will definitely be back and also recommend it to friends and family. Great to have another restaurant with a taste of HOME",

Ordered the garlic shrimp plate and let me just say, the portion size is VERY generous! They hooked it up with a lot of shrimp! Bomb flavors in one bite. Kalua pork nachos on hit too. Spam masubi also for the win!!!! Loving this place, the vibe and the wall art. All the food is sending me straight into a food coma and it's 3 in the afternoon!!!! Goodnight!",

The interior and the structure of the restaurant is nice and welcoming. The location was not hard to find at all and parking was not a hassle.  I ordered the Keiki size with white rice, Kalbi, and Mac salad. We saw that people recommended the lemonade so we got that too!   Through pictures the food looked amazing, but we were disappointed when we got to try it ourselves. The rice was hard, the Mac salad was bland, and the Kalbi was okay. The only item I really enjoyed was the lemonade. On the car ride home we even started to feel a bit sick.   As far as service, one of the girls there was really nice and checked up on us every now and then. The girl who took our order wasn't as friendly.",

The girl had a \"WHAT?\" look on her face. She incorrectly input our order, we had to repeat it to her 3 times. And she STILL got it wrong. Please.. read our journey...  ORDER: Katsu: ALL BATTER AND OVER FRIED/DRY  Kalbi: The kalbi was flavorful but was incredibly chewy. I can tell it was over marinated. When your oversoak/over marinate meat in a salty brine like kalbi marinade, it draws out the natural moisture and turns the meat into jerky.  Mac Salad: The mac salad had no mayo or that the mayo was absorbed into the macaroni because someone put cold mayo into hot, freshly boiled macaroni. Either way - no mayo, no flavor, just no. Pork Tacos: We got PORK NACHOS instead because homegirl at the register couldn't tell the difference between pork nachos and pork tacos on her screed apparently. DA FUQ.  Experince:  The music was loud. Oh my goodness, incredibly LOUD. And when you're in an island inspired restaruant the last thing you'd think you'd hear is Michael Jackson's thriller... during the summer... on a shuffle repeat with Backstreet Boys, Celine Dion and Whitney Houston. It was very, very, VERY ODD.   We sat and our order arrived but WRONG. Instead of pork tacos we got pork nachos. We said we didn't order pork nachos but pork tacos. Instead of admitting her fuck up, she said - \"oh, it's on the house.\" So thinking it was on the house we tried it but wasted it because it was lacking any salt or flavor. Honestly it tasted like the pork was boiled in water. Such an an insult if they think this is what kalua pork tastes like TBH.   Anyway, we continued waiting for the pork tacos but the pork tacos never arrived because instead of inputting pork tacos at the register, she put in PORK NACHOS - even after correcting her at the register THREE TIMES. So the nachos were never really \"on the house\" she just fucked up the order and was hoping we'd what? Forget we ordered tacos??! I as so upset that I threw away the receipt to see what was rung up. Bad on my part but after correcting her 3 times... I mean, you'd think she got it.  A woman had come out and apologized. She ketp asking are you sure you didn't order the nachos? I KNOW WHAT I ORDERED. DON'T TELL ME WHAT I ORDERED. And if I really did order it, WHY DID YOUR EMPLOYEE SAY IT WAS ON THE HOUSE??????? because SHE fucked up.   Between the flavorless food, the sucky, SUCKY, sucky service and the blarring out of place music - it physically hurt to be there. IT HURT.",

I was so worried because I only had 30 minutes to spare and wasn't aware that they cook the food fresh to order. Thankfully, the girl up front was understanding and helped me worked it out. I wanted to try the garlic shrimp, but that was gonna take 15-20 minutes. She decided for me to do the \"boneless Kalbi\" since there was extra made.  Size: I got the kids bowl, just because I don't really eat that much and that comes with one protein, rice, & one side (I got the macaroni salad).  The bowl: inside the bowl comes with cabbage, topped with kimchi and drizzled with spicy mayo.  The combination is so yummy, I was mixing it all together. I asked for more Kimchi on the side just to kinda give it more of that flavor.  Overall, I like it. The bowls are very customizable. BUT, I'll be coming back for that Garlic Shrimp! The staff were nice and the ambience is very Hawaiian. They even had this big TV that showed music videos of Hawaiian music. I definitely feel like I was eating in the island ;)",

The dressing was amazing. I ATE IT ALL!!!  The Garlic Shrimp was more than filling with 10 pieces of shrimp. Shrimp was excellent. Nevermind \"Peel & Eat\", I ate the shell too.   The finisher was also a surprise. We tried their Furukaki Churros.....OMG...You must try it before you leave.   I will definitely be returning.  Great job...and Mahalos to the Staff.",

We eat Hawaiian food regularly since my boyfriend was born in Hawaii his family has always been big fans, and the portions are so small here compared to basically every other place in town we've been to. We ordered a double bowl with chicken katsu as both the \"proteins\" & when we got the food there was barely any chicken on the plate to the point it was spaced out to almost look like more, and you could see the huge servings of rice on the bottom. Since it was our first time we didn't know better and ate it (I wish I took a photo first since I considered it hoping to leave a good review after I ate, but I was just too hungry) anyways after we ate it we saw another person eating a smaller size bowl with just as much chicken katsu on it as ours, because we were so curious we came to yelp to check, and basically every photo on yelp, even the smaller bowls, had the same if not more chicken than what our bowl had. Overall the food had decent flavor, but didn't wow us anymore than the next place, and because you pay more for less we won't be giving it another chance.",

The fact that he reached out to me shows that he cares about his customers. Which is very impressive. My coworker and I decided to give the place a try again. We were welcomed right away. When we were ordering they walked us through the menu. They offered a drink, dessert or corn on a cob. We felt welcomed. The food was good (I recommend to try the crispy sisig, it was delicious), pink lemonade was also a favorite and the restaurant was clean. I am giving him the 4 stars for taking the time to reach out to me and for the much better experience I received on our return visit.",

They have an expanded menu at this location, but unfortunately, I filled up on the delicious mango salsa and chips, so I didn't have a chance to try everything on the menu.

We had the notorious RIB burrito (local plate lunch wrapped into 1 burrito), loco moco, and the seseme chicken bowl with grilled pineapple, awesome kalua pork nachos, and Kalbi (winnah)  Good feeling for this taste of home being close to home. Can't wait to try out more of the menu. Welcome to the neighborhood!",

It's a small joint but it can definitely be a family place to eat. I got the Tocino crispy spam musubi and the short rib rice bowl (bone in). Pretty damn good food and good portions too. Their story is pretty cool and posted by the bathroom. They also gave us complimentary churros before we left too. Highly recommend giving this place a try. Average pricing, good food and excellent customer service. Would definitely go again.",

I wanted the rib and chicken burrito and I said no kimchi salad as it states on their website that kimchi is included. Sooooo I felt like a dummy. My husband and I ordered the chicken plate burrito and the other chicken burrito with cheese and no Mac salad. Obviously the second chicken burrito didn't make an impression but that chicken plate burrito was delish! I can probably eat that any day if it wasn't loaded with so many carbs! One burrito is def more than enough for lunch and I actually only ended up eating half! The spam musubi was also delish but I was full from my half of the burrito.   Overall, it's a win win. They are opened on Sunday's now and I will be back!",

It was immaculate. It was squeaky clean, new and nice. When we walked in, I couldn't help but notice the high ceilings and bright blue tealish walls. It was eye-catching and made me really happy.  The girl that took our order was super duper sweet. She even offered us a free churro to each of us. I thought my break yo mouth teriyakiburrito packed a punch of sweetness and tang. I must've been really hungry because I enjoyed every bite of it. Also, there's an awesome check in special for a pork belly appetizer. It had little dices of apple which was a pleasant surprise for me.  I can't wait to come back for more good eats and the friendly and fast service.",

We're creatures of habit but hubby and I agreed we're gonna try different things every time we come here. For this visit I got my much awaited sisig, brahhhhhh get it! It's umami in your mouth with crispy pork belly skin. It is a must try! But unanimously our favorite eat of the night is their grilled chicken teriyaki, the secret is in the sauce. Made in-house a process that takes 4 hours which Chef Ronnie is very proud of, rightfully so. It's the best teriyaki sauce I've ever had. Hubby says it brings him back to his childhood days where he and his dad would eat Huli Huli chicken in Nanakuli. That's priceless!   Today we had the pleasure of meeting the wonderful owners of Fist of fusion, Chef Ronnie and his gorgeous wife Lisa. You're treated like Ohana when you come in, Chef Ronnie goes from one table to the next talking to diners, making sure everything is good that's very commendable. They also take pics to add to their Ohana wall, how cute is that! According to Lisa a breakfast menu is in the works, super excited for what's to come, think Macnut pancakes!   We've found our new favorite spot! Go check them out, you won't regret it. Support local. ONOLICIOUS!",

It's more like Braddahs which, conveniently, is no longer in the area .   This place is like your standard taco, burrito, rice bowl type restaurant, but with a Hawaiian style twist. The primary meat selections are a kalbi type boneless short rib, chicken, and pork belly.   For lunch, I had the \"Notorious R.I.B\" burrito which is the marinated short rib meat with rice, Mac salad, and a kimchi slaw. While waiting for my food, they brought out a sample churro. I'm not big on sweets, but it was interesting that it had sort of a coconut sugar on it and some seaweed flakes. A bit sweet for my taste, but I still ate the whole thing.  I also had a fried pork belly appetizer. It comes in a bowl on top of some apple coleslaw type deal. It was really good, but too much food for me at this point. I still ate most of it.   I'll definitely be back once Buffalo is done being torn up.",

    "text": "I was excited to see this place open up walking distance from where I work. Ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl (small) with brown rice and sauteed vegetables, to-go. Made a last minute decision and got myself a tocino musubi and free pork belly app wtih yelp check in.    PROS + good portion, small bowl should be enough to fill me up for lunch without the last minute impulse orders  + friendly staff, big smiles and greeted with \"ALOHA\"; apologized that I had to wait awhile   CONS - put in my free pork belly app order shortly after I ordered my main meal, but felt like I waited a lot longer than I needed to for it (party of 3 after me all got their orders before me) - rice in musubi wasn't sticky enough to old it together, fell apart after my first bite - very small portion of pork belly app, there were only a few pieces on a bed of slaw; it was free but I probably wouldn't order again  TAKEAWAYS * get the small bowl again for lunch, get something other than the chicken teriyaki (short ribs, pork sisig) * get the mac salad, always (sauteed vegetables?! what was i thinking?) * try the burrito, if you're feeling dangerous",

    "text": "Underwhelming to say the least. I've been here twice and both times the atmosphere has been, for lack of a better word, annoying.   And to preface this I am also confused by their name. I thought this establishment's name was Island Grill because First of Fusion is SO small on their building.   Okay, let's dive in... (This is funny, you just don't know it yet)  The first time I ordered a combo plate with shrimp, edamame, and their mac salad which was just eh, in my opinion. I even upgraded to shrimp and felt like I paid more money for less food. I received maybe two pieces of medium-sized shrimp and a whole lot of sauce. I'm thinking the shrimp drowned in the sauce and disintegrated into the sauce? Not sure how else an establishment could serve SO little of a protein that is considered an upgraded charge. I wasn't mad about the amount of sauce because I only eat so I have something to put condiments on BUT id like to feel like I'm inhaling some sort of substance. The mac was regular, nothing to write a review home about. Also, I think the edamame is a waste of a side because there are no special flavors to the pods, not even salt. Get something else.  Flash forward about three months, I saw a mac burrito of some sort on Instagram and saw it was from Fist of Fusion (not knowing it was the island grill I had already written off). Looked super good, and I even thought, wow I've never been here before let's go check it out.   Pulled up and was like \"Oh... I guess let's give it another shot.\" Although I was slightly annoyed walking in, I tried not to let that sway my judgment. I found out the burrito was called The Notorious RIB. I, being the pescatarian that I am, ordered shrimp instead of the pork and paid the upcharge fee of $2. I know you're probably thinking that this review is wasted because I didn't get the notorious RIB the OG way, but if it was so notorious the way it was why would they offer upgrades? If anything I should be getting a better product. After waiting an unusually long amount of time for a counter ordering facility I reviewed my food. It looked bangin, just like the photo, so I was a little more upbeat (even snapped a photo). Took a bit into it and tasted the regular mac salad, cabbage, and no shrimp. Hmm, okay, so I bite around on the other side. No shrimp. That's probably because there were once again only two pieces of medium-sized shrimp inside my WHOLE burrito that was the size of a small child but PLENTY of sauce (please see photo). Once again, I found myself asking if the shrimp drowned in their own sauce and disappeared.   I know I personally won't be back. I see you Fist of Fusion. You can't hide behind your sauce.   2 stars for the reggae music selction",

I did not know what to expect in regards to the level of service and speediness of food delivery so to speak. You order at the counter, then find a seat. They cook the proteins after you order so it does take some time for the food to come out.  The food portions are pretty large which is great considering the lowish price. Good bang for the buck. The food quality was tasty as well. Very flavorful. One minor complaint though. The ingredients in the burrito I ordered were not evenly spread throughout the burrito so some parts were real saucy and others were more on the dryer side. Still pretty tasty though. I would come back!",

I ordered the plate lunch burrito, spam musubi and a drink. My total was $15 and some change. The burrito was amazing. It had white rice, grilled chicken, grilled veggies, cabbage, mac salad, and two kinds of sauce - yum! The spam musubi was standard, but I love spam musubi. For me the food was 5 stars. The service on the other hand needs some work.  When I placed my order, the girl told me 10 minutes but it ended up being around 25 minutes. Most of the food was already cooked, so the workers just had to basically assemble everything. There were only 2 girls working  though and anytime someone came in, one of them had to stop and cashier. I think things would run a lot smoother if they had one dedicated cashier. I almost had to ask for my money back because it kept getting later and later with no food. Seriously a burrito takes like 2 seconds to make, especially since they just had to put the ingredients on the tortilla and roll it up. The musubi was already made. I finally got my food but because it was so late, I had to rush back to work and eat in the car (hence no pictures), so I didnt really get to savor the burrito, but man it was good. I will definitely be back, but I might place my order in advance if I am crunched on time.",

How hard is it to have ordered 3 rice bowls and the next time 2 rice bowls? On the 3rd, it took 20 minutes to wait (my 2nd visit took only 10 minutes wait). It's just that there was a young couple aside from us who just finished ordering.  5 minutes later, a party of 2, then another party of 2, then 1. On the 20th minute they called the first couple's order, then ours came, then probably in 2 minute intervals everyone's orders arrived. Hoping my order was worth the wait, I was observing the staff kinda giggling around while scooping out rice and sides. With the wait, i expected rice to be warm, meat and grilled pineapple still should be hot as I expected because of the wait, but it was not. 1st and 2nd visit, yes my sides were mixed up but the food was hot so I refused to mind it. But this 3rd visit did not meet my expectation at all. Sorry, just being honest.",

I ordered a Hawaiian salad which consisted of greens , fresh pineapple , grilled chicken  cabbage , crispy wontons , and a sweet sesame dressing . It was fantastic ! The chicken was warm and browned , fresh off the grill and combined nicely with the sweetness of the pineapple and sesame dressing . The reason I did not give them 5 stars is that I saw someone eating a pineapple ice cream cone which cost about $4.50 , a little high for a soft serve ice cream but it was large . I didn't want that much ice cream so I ordered a small cone for $1.50. Small cone is an understatement  , It was a cone smaller than sample cones you get for free at ice cream places . A cone about 2 inches high and about 3/4 of an inch across with no more than an ounce of ice cream. A one bite ice cream about one tenth the size of a regular cone , one bite should not cost anything  , that should be the sampler you give customers who want as taste. Don't ruin the experience where everything is priced reasonably and than overcharge for the dessert , it leaves a bad taste in your mouth after a good meal .",

    "text": "Hard to have given 3 stars. We are all about supporting local spots but I'm also all about supporting good food. We drove across town to try out this place. We were greeted as we walked in, nice little atmosphere and loved the island vibe and music. Prices are reasonable. Looking at spending about 23.00 for two meals and two regular drinks. We went to the front to look at the menu and girl ( no name tag) upfront asked if we were ready and I told her we were still looking. She was not personable at all . When we went in it wasn't that busy that she could of made an effort to make small talk with us and give us some ideas of what their top sellers were. She clearly saw us looking at their menu and their choices of elote . Though she did state if we had questions to ask. When finally ordering we tried to order one of their elotes and she said \"oh we are out of corn\". Should of put a sign up or even state they are out when we were looking at the menu.  Also only choice of diet soda was out of order. So what brought us here? We saw some pictures of their food on UNLOKT. Pictures they have posted look better than what the food tastes like. No flavor. Also another friend who is a \"foodie\" stated they were good. I got the chicken katsu meal. 1 protein, 2 scoops of rice, and 2 sides for $9.99. I got veggies and macaroni salad as my sides. Side means two tablespoons of macaroni salad and 1/2 cup of grilled soggie onions, a piece of red bell pepper , and 1 cube of zucchini. Maybe I didn't get their popular dish but no excuse to not have fresh veggies cooked and I had seen containers of food behind counter. Rice and veggies .. setup look like something at chipotle. So you know veggies are not cooked fresh. Definitely not a place to go out of your way for.",

We ordered 2 regular and 1 large bowl. Sesame chicken, teriyaki chicken, and a teriyaki & pork belly combo. You get 2 sides. All 3 of us got grilled pineapple which was delicious. The stir-fry veggies were very good. My daughter had to split open all her edamame pods. The sauce that comes with the bowls is amazing. The rice was delicious. A regular bowl had enough that my daughter and I took home leftovers. My husband ate all his large bowl. I gave them 4 stars because we waited quite awhile. They did give us a free order of the pork nachos which were very good and huge! They seemed a bit unorganized as we had to wait for o e bowl and one piece of pineapple. Regardless of the wait, we will be back. The food was excellent and the staff was friendly.",

    "text": "If I was basing this review just off of what I ordered, the garlic shrimp plate, it would be 0 stars. Shrimp had no flavor (yall ever heard of salt?), rice was hard, macaroni in the mac salad was undercooked, and the second side they gave me was not what I ordered.   But what bumped this up to a three star review is I was having lunch with my dad, and he ordered a mixed plate of kalbi short ribs and garlic fried chicken. The kalbi is really good. I would go back solely for this. The garlic chicken was good as well, very much like chicken wings you would get down the street at Soyo or Bonchon.   As far as service, the girl at the register was not very welcoming, which is a turn off considering this is a Hawaiian place. Ever heard of \"aloha spirit\"?! Someone teach her how please.   Also the portions are kind of small for the price. Even though my food sucked, I ate all of it and was still hungry. And this ones not really a big deal, but the place gives off a young vibe that would be more environmentally friendly, but they use a lot of plastic: plates and covers, drink cups and lids, cutlery. But they do have those brown napkins made from recycled paper, so that's a plus.   Friends who recommended this place to me said everything they had was great, even the garlic shrimp. So maybe I went on a bad day? To the owner: Consistency is key. But I will be back here and try other things on the menu, as well as order that kalbi.",

    "text": "Had this for lunch today. We placed an order online for pick up. Large order and it was ready on time.  Super excited to try this food. I had a large mixed rice bowl. Brown rice, notorious rib, tofu , grilled veggies and grilled pineapple. Also the miso corney elote.   The bowl was soaked in some kind of juice/thin gravy and cabbage all over the top of the bowl. The rice was soaked, veggies soggy. The rib was good but you can tell it is just stew meat. Tofu was fried well well done almost to hard to eat.  I did not eat the rice, veggies or pineapple as they were all soaked with the liquid.  The one thing that they got right was the miso corney elote. Steamed perfect and the seasoning blend was so good. I did ask for it to be cut of the cob but that was not done.   I hope that they take some of these reviews to heart and consider to change a few things and put out some really good food.",

    "text": "I've been here on two separate occasions and I have to say even though this place is way on the other side of town for me, I'd definitely make the effort drive out here for their food. I've tried their Garlic Shrimp plate, Kalbi Short Ribs plate, Uni-Corn and Miso Corn-y. I have not been disappointed yet. Garlic shrimp was not overwhelming on garlic and had a semi-sweet taste to it. Kalbi was very juicy. Depending on the size of plate you want will dictate the amount of sides you get. The regular plate gets two sides and let me just say having grilled pineapple, toss salad or edamame as options makes me feel less guilty about my main dish. The corn on the cob options are very creative and with the prices being $4/each its very easy to get two and not feel ashamed. The service incorporates the aloha spirit from the moment you open the door till the moment you depart. With all these new and delicious spots opening up on this side of town, I may need to relocate soon.",

Besides the terrible rice they serve, I don't like anything else.   Their garlic shrimp is meh. The shrimp they use is NOT good quality. I feel like it's the packaged ones in the freezer aisle. I'm not paying $13 for that.  The spam in the musubi was paper thin, and super plain. Every time I've had musubis at other Hawaiian joints, it's a pretty thick slice and marinated or has some kind of added teriyaki sauce. The ones here is just soggy rice, spam wrapped in seaweed.  Their sisig was decent, but it wasn't anything to rave about.  My least favorite item on the menu are the tacos. The tortillas weren't served warm. They also came straight out of a plastic bag. I got about 4 pieces of meat inside the taco and it was served on a plastic lid. Definitely nothing special and it was easily something I could've recreated at home.   If you live in the area, I'd try Makai or Island Flavor for your Hawaiian craving.",

I got the crispy pork belly and did not enjoy it. The pork was soiled with grease and all I tasted was fat :( They were kind enough to prepare another dish for me since I wasn't enjoying the food, so I went with the Chicken Katsu. I'm not sure if it's because I've never had chicken katsu before and wasn't sure what to expect, but I didn't really like that one either. Maybe I'll try something else on the menu another time, but I would definitely come back for the kalbi.  My food came out in about 10-15 minutes both times I've been there so I can't complain!",

I originally ordered their Mixed plate with pork belly, sesame chicken, Mac salad, grilled pineapple, and white rice. The lady at the counter says they're out of grilled pineapple, no biggie. Double Mac salad it is.   She puts in the order and I pay, while waiting she tells me that she just found out they're out of pork belly. So I substitute for chicken katsu. I figured since I was charged $2 more for the pork belly, when I had to substitute for a non premium item they would maybe give me a bigger portion to compensate.   Once I got my food I was disappointed with the total amount of food I got compared to what I had paid. The food itself was really good, and I would definitely go back to try it again (hopefully I can get the food I originally wanted to order). As a first time experience this was a let down for me.",

    "text": "If this review was solely about the food food it'd be at least a 4 star review! My girlfriend and I came in last night for dinner after a long day and we were pleasantly surprised by how good the food was! I got the plate lunch burrito and she got the garlic shrimp plate, we also shared the crispy pork belly appetizer! All three of which had tremendous flavors! However there were a few downsides to each of our dishes, for my burrito it was sooo poorly wrapped that when I picked it up it was falling apart. I ended up eating it with a fork as if it were a normal plate lunch which was disappointing to me because I ordered a burrito not a plate lunch. As for my girlfriends plate the only downside was the shrimp wasn't crispy it was soggy if anything!  We got the strong garlic flavor however it wasn't crispy at all! Which was a bummer because you need a crunch on that plate of rice and Mac salad! And the pork belly was crispy but it came out cold and the spicy sauce with it all we could taste was Tabasco nothing else!  Sadly this review is about much more than the food so it won't be getting 4 stars today!   When we came in it was extremely cold in the restaurant, the employee working the register was even wearing a jacket. Now I understand you'd want the ac on blast in Vegas but it's September it was only 90 degrees outside and I think someone had just set it too high. (I did hear about 3-5 other people say something about it when they walked in as well)   The ice machine was out of ice and when asked we were told \"sorry we're out\" with a tone as if we were inconveniencing them by asking.    We both really enjoyed the playlist that was playing when we walked in however the music stopped while we were waiting for our food... it was super weird because it was only 7:55 so they were gonna be open for another hour but the dining room was silent. With the absence of music everyone in the the dining room could hear the employees messing around in the back which is what ruined my experience for me... we heard a guy talking about how he got laid last night(good for you dude, but that's not something all your guest want to hear while they eat!), we heard a girl freaking out because she messed up the teriyaki sauce and put way to much sugar!(again not something you'd want the guest to hear) and just a whole bunch of laughing cursing and messing around! I'm not saying that work shouldn't Be fun but when my food is coming out halfassed because young adults can't grasp the concept of treating their work with respect it pisses me off. We left the restaurant in such a bad mood because of the way the employees were carrying themselves. If we come back it'll be for takeout or a call in order which still worries because of the laid back demeanor and carelessness of the employees! You guys are representing not just yourselves but the company as well! Step up your game! It was such a disappointment on the service end!  As good as the food is this is not a place I would go out of my way for. Especially considering the amount of option for Hawaiian food in Las Vegas.",

I ordered a mixed bowl. I got it with white rice, garlic shrimp, stir fry veggies, and grilled pineapple. The bowl was overall pretty good. The garlic shrimp gave the rice a good flavor and the grilled pineapple was a nice twist. My only complaint is there were a few chunks of carrot in the stir fry veggies that didn't seem to be cooked all the way and it threw off the texture for me. I would say without the carrots it would've been better. My friend ordered their kalua pork and he said it was bland and had no flavor. I think I'll go back to this place again just for the shrimp!",

I had the chicken plate buritto which had chicken, brown rice, honey Chipotle sauce, macaroni salad and I think slaw...my man had the rib buritto...the meat was intense...so tender and flavorful. The meat tasted as it was marinated in teriyaki, ginger and soy sauce...it was amazing. He didn't have it with the kimchi or the honey Chipotle sauce...the burittos were so large that I could only eat half and then this really nice man came over to our table (maybe the owner?) Asked us if we wanted to try the churros...on him...so we said yes. They came out hot and fresh...lots of great sugar and a hint of cinnamon and I want to say it had flakes of seaweed on them also. They were spectacular! There were some guys sitting at the table across from us and one had what looked like the bowl with the rib meat in it and it looked delicious...we will try that the next time we go...and the street corn... If you are looking for a great Hawaiian restaurant with fresh quality ingredients and a great atmosphere ....then you really need to come here!!!",

    "text": "This was my first experience at fist of fusion and I was hoping for a better experience. I ordered a loco moco, chicken katsu, short rib, and Kalua pork sisig. The loco moco seemed relatively tough, but the gravy was pretty good. Short rib was tender and mildly flavorful. Kalua pork \"sisig\" might as well been called Kalua pork, instead of capitalizing on a trendy gimmick. But the most unfortunate occurrence was the metallic wire in the chicken katsu (pictured) that in my fiancee's plate. Not sure how it got in there but it was lodged between two pieces of katsu slices. Island Flavor still reigns supreme as the premier Island food hot spot, but I'm hoping for a better experience at fist of fusion one day.",

I went there with 2 of my supervisors and it was just the 3 of us so it wasn't like it was busy or anything. All 3 of us had issues with our orders. One of my supervisors ordered the kalua pig taco. The shell was so oily and it only had a little kalua pig and lots of cabbage. My other supervisor ordered the spam katsu bowl with the tocino sauce on the side. They gave her chicken katsu. She told them it was a wrong order and they remade it with sauce on top which she specifically asked to have it on the side. And I ordered the keiki sesame chicken with edamame as my side. My chicken was cold on the inside, it didn't look fully cooked. And my rice was soaked with water from the edamame and the other side was soaked with oil from the chicken. I'm only giving this review 2 stars because the guy handling all this was really nice and sincerely apologetic.",

Now given that we arrived at after 9p on a rainy night, I'm willing to give them a pass- they probably thought that they were done for the night and then we come waltzing in.   The restaurant is a take out joint, but does have an area to eat in. It is decorated in lots of Hawaiian themed items and Hawaiian music playing. The servers were friendly and polite.  We both ordered the big mouth burrito with the chicken katzu. It's definitely a large portion, so it's worth the $8.99. I felt that my chicken was a little on the dry side, but the side of sauce included helped out. Nothing was particularly seasoned, but altogether it worked out fine.   I may give them another shot if I'm on that side of town again, but wouldn't go out of my way.",

    "text": "So this is Fist of Fusion Island Grill. You'll probably only see the \"Island Grill\" and the shaka parts of their sign outside and assume it's just another Hawaiian restaurant. It's not. It's fusion. What they serve is fusion. You've been warned. I'm not going to hate the fact it's fusion. I'm ok with fusion. I just wasn't a fan of their fusion. Came here 3 times so I was trying to give them a chance.  On my 1st visit I ordered the regular size bowl ($7.99) bone-in short ribs (+$2) with 2 scoops rice, mac salad, and a grilled pineapple on the side.  The pineapple was the best part and all it was was a grilled pineapple. The mac salad and short rib was nothing special. Sure the pic may look nice but I didn't like it it was more like beef jerky to me. I tried to order the free crispy pork belly app with yelp check-in but they ran out. I was there when they just opened for lunch.  On my 2nd visit I took the parents. We ordered 3 large size bowls of various items share. They messed up the orders twice. Once after the order was placed and one more time when the food was ready. I thought it was fixed the 1st time. The end result? One bowl was some bone-in short ribs and this kalua pork sisig with slaw thing. The short ribs were cooked differently this time. They weren't like beef jerky which was better but I still didn't like it.  There was also less pieces than my 1st visit. The 2nd bowl had teriyaki chicken and kalua pork sisig. The 3rd bowl had tofu and sesame chicken. There was bad words said while eating. No one wanted to eat more after sampling everything and the food remained untouched in the fridge over the weekend. The free crispy pork belly app was nothing good also.  The 3rd visit I ordered the loco moco. You can't mess up loco moco can you? There's nothing to it. Rice, fried egg, and gravy. The eggs had furikake on it which is how I usually make my eggs at home. The gravy was different. Needed more gravy not because the taste of the gravy there was just wasn't a lot of gravy in the bowl. A friend ordered short ribs thinking they were getting short ribs with the bone in it, you know the usual way it's served. Whatever was brought out I wasn't going to trade with him even though he was kind of looking at my plate.   They use paper bowls. Seems like they're trying to be eco friendly. A good amount of rice got stuck to the bowls. If you start scraping sure the rice comes off the bowl but with some paper from the bowl. Also it doesn't hold up too well on to go orders. Took it a few miles away and bowls were all wet.  Honestly I'd rather go to the other restaurants around the area like Island Flavor, Ohana, and L & L just to name a few. I'm going to Island Flavor now.",

All the ingredients work so well together and I think it was the chicken that had a little char grill flavor that ties everything together I just can't get over this simple dish ??   I also had the Large rice bowl with chicken teriyaki and the boneless ribs It was pretty good I wish the ribs had some char grill on them to ? that would've been awesome But It was still good it also comes with rice and 2 sides Everything had good flavor nothing was dry The portion sizes are pretty generous for the price compared to some of the other places around. I will definitely be back here My only mistake was I didn't order more chicken tacos !! Haha! Oh the tacos in the picture should've had a cilantro lime sauce but I wanted it on the side",

If you occasionally eat Polynesian food, this place might hit the spot for you, but if you grew up on island food, chances are you'll stick to your go-to spot after trying Fist of Fusion. They've got a cute little set up which totally gives off the touristy Hawaiian vibe.  Ordered a mixed plate which comes with 2 choices of protein. I chose the garlic shrimp that had been haunting my dreams thanks to IG, and kalbi ribs because I figured you can't go wrong with kalbi. It came with a couple different options for sides but in True Polynesian fashion I stuck with rice & mac salad. I feel like you can tell A LOT about a place by it's mac salad. I also opted for Island lemonade. The lemonade was super sweet and in no way reminded me of the islands lol. The food delivered look bomb. I tore into the garlic shrimp first and was so disappointed. Very bland with barely a hint of garlic. The Mac salad was as forgettable as the shrimp unfortunately. Thankfully the kalbi was good. There are plenty of island options nearby and I felt this one was meh. Sticking with my regular spot off of Durango ;)",

We ordered a bunch of food, from loco moco, tocino musubi, tofu salad, pork belly sisig, Teri chicken, kalua pork nachos, etc. they were all ok for us. The mayo mixtures that they added to most of their food as dressing or drizzles for presentations didn't go well with the food. Their chicken katsu plate burrito was pretty great though. Also, they ran out of short ribs! Mind blown! We went there on a Sunday right around noon....just about an hour after they opened. And when we got there there were only two customers. Idk. They might've just forgot to restock or had a big order of kalbi before we got there. Will we be back? Maybe after a while. We'll see.",

    "text": "I was excited about trying the food here after having read amazing reviews about this place. I chose the Mixed Island Rice Bowl ($9.99) with two scoops of Brown Rice topped with Teriyaki Chicken, Honey Sesame Tofu, Macaroni Salad, Grilled Pineapple, and a Tropical Lemonade. My friend also chose a similar order with two scoops of White Rice topped with Teriyaki Chicken, Kalua Pork Sisig, Macaroni Salad, Green Salad, and a soda fountain drink. In addition, they gave us Furikake Churro which is on the house.   Honestly, I'm not happy with the meal I ordered. The Teriyaki Chicken taste okay. The meat isn't as tender as it should be and the portions are quite small for a large bowl. The Honey Sesame Tofu is a bit on the sweeter side. If they could've add a little spice like Sriracha to it, it would've balance the sweetness and make the meal taste better. On a brighter note, I do like the Macaroni Salad and Grilled Pineapple. These are actually sides and are the only ones that taste good.  I was told the Tropical Lemonade ($2.79) had Passion Fruit, Orange, and Guava in it, but all I can taste is concentrated sugar water. Also keep in mind the best quality churro is served warm, crispy, and it's enjoyable to eat. The churros that we were given taste kind of sad, it needed more time to fry, its texture is so dense and chewy, and there is hardly any Furikake sprinkled on it. It's just massive amount of sugar on undercooked dough. I ended up taking most of my meal home. Thankfully I have bottled water in my car and I drank up that water like there's no tomorrow.",

    "text": "This Hawaiian/Filipino spot on the corner of Buffalo and Warm Springs Rd. is packed with island flavor!!! It's only befitting that Fist of Fusion Island Grill whose based in So Cal, opened their 2nd location on the Ninth Island aka Las Vegas!  Step in here and they already treat you like ohana with their warm smiles and \"Aloha!\" greeting.    What's offered up here are some Hawaiian and Filipino favorites served in taco, or burrito form. Island style salads pack some nutritional value, that's next on my list to try!  Or you can choose Island Rice Bowls where you can pick an additional two sides and your choice white/brown rice.  Well since Ive limit myself to not having meat, my go to order here is the Honey Sesame Tofu. The tofu is marinated with sesame miso dressing..So ono!!  Grilled Pineapple! - Get that for one of your sides!! Taking a bite into warm juicy pineapple is so onolicious!  When I ordered the keiki size Pork Belly Sigsig, for me...I didnt get stink eye. Perfect serving size for my post workout recovery meal. Eggs are protein! Pork Belly is brok' da mout!  Ambience - small space but good use of dining area with booths and tables. You got Sammy J playin on the video screen. Their surfboard counter/hi top with stools is where you'll usually find me.  Love staring at the mural.. a homage to Hawaiian and Filipino culture. Whoever the artist is..five stars to you too!! It's beautiful! The window faces the mountains...not quite islandy, but hey everything else here has the island vibe and ono grindz!",

I know that isn't a lot to base the whole restaurant on but it was yummy. I noticed that it did NOT have a strong spell when I unwrapped it, like other restaurants have sometimes. That alone made me want to write a review.   The girl that took my order was friendly and the restaurant is decorated in a cute way! They were pretty busy when I was there. Almost every table was taken at 1:00pm on a Friday!  If I'm in the area again, I will definitely stop by because I wanted to try the fried spam musubi and the pork belly. I just wasn't hungry enough that day lol! I also noticed they have a check in offer right now!",

    "text": "My girlfriend was the one that told me about this place as she drove by a few times and knew that I lived near by.   The next day, my husband and I attempted to go, on a Sunday at 4:59 pm, to which I could see they were closed and sweeping up. I visited the following day to pick up dinner. This is when I found out, this was their soft opening week and Sunday was their very first day.  I also learned from the owner/chef, what the correct hours would be: M - Sat 11 - 9 and Sunday from 11 to 7.  Being filipino and growing up in HI, one would think that I got this, but I honestly can say that the menu is different from other filipino or Hawaiian-style restaurants. For the most part, there's a twist to many of the items on the menu, which is a good thing.  It took me a few minutes to figure out what to order, plus my husband texted me to change his order twice!   With the two times that I have been to Fist of Fusion, I have some mixed emotions as to which are my favorites, because they are all so good. Coming up in first place are the sesame chicken, loco moco, kalua pork sisig taco and kalua pork nachos. For the tacos and nachos, they fry their own shells and chips!!!   The loco moco is made with mushroom gravy. Like real mushrooms. So very good.  My husband really enjoyed their Crispy Pork Belly Appetizer and furikaki churros.  The one thing that is weird about the location of this restaurant, is the parking lot. Make sure you don't back into the mound of dirt and unpaved portion in the middle of the parking lot.   Convenient location, good food, good people, and clean. 4-star rating for me.",

I wanted to run outside and throw up .  After leaving the place I threw up what I ordered in the parking lot.  The food is greasy and did not taste right.  I think I just had food poisoning.  It's not worth it.  If you want your money worth, go to Island Flavor or just BBQ your own food.  Sorry but I had to share my bad experience.",

My friend couldn't decide between the garlic chicken or the Kalua Pork, so she got the large bowl and both protiens.  It was a lot of food, but she enjoyed both meats.  Fist of Fusion is now on our lunch list!",

Everything we have tried here is cooked to perfection, and flavorful. Since trying this on a whim I have made it a regular lunch spot. Eating here at least once a week. I'm personally a huge fan of the chicken katsu, and grilled pineapple. The atmosphere is fun, laid back, and perfect for any occasion. The staff is friendly, and caters to your questions, and needs. Also, for the quality of food, and amount you get, the price is great as well! Two thumbs way up!",

The teriyaki sauce is a little different than I am used to but good! I had the Kalau pig bowl - again regular size is huge! It was good; I could have used a little more flavor. My husband ordered the R.I.B. burrito. He said it was good. I have never seen the mac salad in a burrito before. My sis ordered the spam musubi and spam katsu. The pink sauce was an interesting color and she liked it. They were kind enough to offer us churros! Three had them and said they were good. I would come back again, when I am on this side of town. It is different than the usual Hawaiian food we order and I like trying new things!",

    "text": "I'm one local guy moved here 4 years ago. 1 word  BOMB - local term meaning soooooo ONO - Hawaiian word meaning so good. Recommend it! The atmosphere, the people working so much Aloha please keep that! I'll let everyone I know, know!   Food came out great, flavor was very good. Nothing was soggy during my first experience there, and the shrimp plate was big and fulfilling. Sauces was on point.  First thing, if you are going into an establishment and thing is for you, \"I'm gonna yelp about this\" the first time you step into the restaurant than you gonna look for the negatives. Just go in the place with an intent to enjoy yourself, your friends, significant other, parent etc and eat. And if your critiquing how your sushi burrito fell apart and blame the employees for not taking their work \"seriously\". BRUH it's not a full on Mexican place bruh. Some people place standards way to high, seem to eat out more than cook your own food and know \"Flavor.\" And for the Garlic shrimp it's not suppose to be crispy like one guy complained,it's sauteed. Know your dishes before you open your mouth. I think some people's critique is kinda over the top with this place, like they are expecting some VIP treatment. They complain about the people working talking about their business in the back, when the thing is, enjoy the food and the atmosphere of the place. This is not one \"private\" area and everything gotta be perfect. Enjoy your dinner with laughter and fun with those you love or bring to this establishment. Some should realize when entering this place, it's a nice chill place to eat. The Vibe is local and if your really from the islands you'd understand the vibe. I felt nothing but pure aloha. The cashier was more patient with me ordering cuz a friend of mine recommended this place. And if they say \"im sorry we are out\" bruh relax not the end of the world. This place looks like a new establishment still building itself. So In local terms relax, and enjoy the grinds! Nothing but Aloha  Mahalo I'm actually gonna go there right now in an hour!",

    "text": "What a hidden gem. This place is like a fancy shrimp taco truck you'd find in Hawaii. A little bit of Hawaii in a restaurant... :)  Tried the crispy pork belly rice bowl, mexicorn, garlic shrimp, garlic honey sriracha chicken wings.... the crispy pork... awesome. Only thing is I wish I could've had kimchi or something with more spice to balance out my food. The mexicorn... meh. It wasn't what I was hoping for... not bad but not the best. Best thing is portions are very generous.   Overall it was delicious. The place is a little small so may not be the best for larger groups. The people there were super friendly. They were vigilant in asking if we needed anything else. Music  was in point.   Definitely recommend.",

    "text": "I was excited to try this place out when I saw the sign going up on the building. We tried so many lack luster Chinese styled Hawaiian bbq spots and I thought man this should be interesting to see how a Filipino Hawaiian bbq fusion spot will be. First off the place was well kept and clean, the staff greets you while you walk in, and the menu has just enough selection not to make you overwhelmed with choices. The only reason why I'm giving it a 4 Star is because the crispy pork belly was a little oily like it was fried in oil and not broiled, so the fat just held all the oils. The sesame chicken was good as was the boneless bbq beef. The garlic shrimp was not as how I expected or liked, it was in a goopy sauce that had a whole different garlic taste and a couple shrimps were undercooked. The panko fried spam Musubi was good but I think the price could be a little better for the amount given for sure. They have a super bomb drink here though that will be so refreshing on hot days or just in general, POG ( Passion fruit, Orange and Guava) lemonade. Super bangin. Overall I will be trying all the other stuff they got since it was pretty good.",

    "text": "First impression, pretty basic order at the counter style restaurant. Hawaiian food mainly.  Had the 2 meat combo. Had the Notorious ribs and teri chicken with rice and double mac salad.  The chicken was good, will get sauce on the side next time though because it spills all into the rice a bit too much for my taste. But it was seared well and had good flavor and texture.  The boneless shortrib (basically korean bulgogi) was pretty dissapointing as a korean lol. The marinade flavor was good, but the cooking of the meat was done pretty poorly. Looks like they arent using a hot enough grill, or they are just overloading the grill with too much cold meat. It was basically boiled marinated meat. Zero char or searing on the beef which is crucial in my opinion.   The mac salad was mac salad.   They did give me 2 complimentary churros which was honestly the highlight for me. They should sell larger sized ones for sure.  Overall it was just okay, I didnt really get a warm greeting either which is important to me being a business owner myself that cares ALOT about customer experience. The food was nothing to write home about. Might come back to try some other stuff if Im in the area.",

My daughter ordered the Loco Moco and the pattt was so over cooked it was dry and burnt. She tried to smoother it with the gravy and it still hasn't helping. She asked for ketchup and they told her that they didn't have any ketchup. NO KETCHUP? AT ALL?  Mind you it was only noon so it wasn't like it was late and they ran out. The gravy looked like it came from a frozen food tray and just warmed up. My sisig was overwhelming with whatever ranch sauce they put on it. Not a fan. But on a good note the garlic chicken Wings and musubi are good. But not too sure I'll make my way there again.",

    "text": "Always on the lookout for new spots in town, we decided to give Fist of Fusion a go. Ordered a Large Bowl (2 proteins and two sides) Sesame Chicken and Kalua Pork Sisig. My sides were mac salad and grilled pineapple.  Observing the kitchen in action while we wait for our food, two cooks hustle (not in a good way)to get orders out as there are two people ahead of us and take out orders as well. A good 30 minutes pass and we finally get our order. Wifey luckily ordered a salad, but my bowl was a huge let down.  Filipinos and Hawaiians LOVE their rice. In fact, a pot of hot, fluffy rice is one of the first things you learn how to do in the kitchen growing up. The rice in my take out container wasn't hot, more cool to the touch, and  some grains were hard. Day old rice? Possibly, but that's the kind of rice you turn into fried rice, not serve it as is, especially when hot food should be hot, and for the prices you charge.  The \"SISIG\" was anything but...(simply a play on words)no jowl, no ear, no snout...straight up bland shredded pork butt topped with shredded cabbage and a white sauce. This was barely warm/room temp...its beginning to sound like a CON-Fusion of Filipino/Hawaiian food.  The Sesame Chicken (Chicken Katsu topped with sesame seeds and a sweet shoyu concoction) looked and tasted like it was prepared ahead of time and not made to order Inside wasn't hot, wasn't  juicy at all, and portion sizes for both proteins were on the skimpy side.  To make things worse, the mac salad was a bland mush, and the grilled pineapple was so sour, I spit it out as I proceeded to take a bite. Too many shortcuts and overall taste makes me wish I had read LJ's review first.   Another double edged sword is social media. Food should taste as good as it looks when its posted on Yelp, Instagram, or Facebook, but if you can't duplicate your delicious looking food consistently on a daily basis, then it's a huge disappointment ....NEXT!!!!",

He told us the reason for creating the food and restaurant and it comes down to family and sharing his love of his culture, family food and values to the rest of the world.

If you're ever craving short ribs, FoF is currently thee spot to get them!  Also tried tried the Crispy pork belly this time, and it was really tasty! It had really good textures. The skin was super crisp, but the pork itself was really soft and moist. The cilantro lime sauce also gave the pork a nice kick to it.   And did I mention the guava lemonade? I'm usually not a huge fan of lemonade, but that drink converted me into a fan. So refreshing!  Service was friendly and accommodating as usual. Looks like I'll be coming back, tomorrow.",

    "text": "Fist of Fusion is a great spot for a first date to screen someone for their relationship potential. Long story short, if a guy can hang through a trip here AND you get some action afterward despite the garlic breath from the Shrimp Plate, he's a keeper.   The Steps: 1. Insist on driving. If he doesn't complain about your speed/music selection or repeatedly ask why you're passing several other Hawaiian restaurants on your way to this specific place, that's common sense AND compatibility. 2. Insist on getting the Shrimp Plate. If he doesn't bitch about it being the highest price item on the menu, you're off to a good start. Bonus points if he takes your recommendation and orders the same thing, and then doesn't complain if you steal a shrimp off his order. Sharing is caring! 3. Chat through your meal and if you're still feeling it, refer to the first paragraph. Garlic is amazing and if that's a deterrent for him, he's not worth it anyway.  For real though, the Garlic Shrimp Plate is amazing- ~$14 for about 10 shrimp, doused in garlic, with plenty of rice, a scoop of mac salad, and a little bit of greens. The shrimp are large and fresh, and have been cooked perfectly on my two trips out here so far.   The menu isn't all classic Hawaiian, they feature Filipino and fusion items too. I keep meaning to try the chicken wings and the Notorious RIB burrito (complete with mac salad INSIDE THE TORTILLA) but the shrimp keeps winning me over. They also have elotes!",

I was also able to sub one scoop of my rice for green salad which was really nice because I pretty much have no self control when it comes to carbs.   Mom Rating 3/5 The dine in area is pretty small and even though there weren't many people there when we visited it can get quite noisy. So although we started with a sleeping baby he was up within minutes on entering. However the cuisine and ambience is very kid friendly.",

We have been here TWICE in a week now! And it won't be the last time! You really get your bang for your buck -- the food is well portioned, filling AND satisfying!  The menu has a wide variety of hawaiian x filipino fusion food -- from appetizers, burritos, salads, tacos, entrees, and rice bowls. We both opted for the ISLAND RICE BOWLS: - Choose your size (KIDS $5.99: 1 serving of protein, 1 scoop of rice, 1 side) (REGULAR $7.99: 1 servings of protein, 2 scoops of rice, 2 sides)  (MIXED $9.99: 2 servings of protein, 2 scoops of rice, 2 sides) - Choose your protein (teriyaki chicken, Notorious R.I.B. boneless shortribs, kalbi short ribs, sesame chicken, chicken katsu, kalua pork sisig, crispy pork belly sisig, honey sesame tofu, teriyaki veggies) - Choose your sides (macaroni salad, green salad, grilled pineapple, stir fry vegetables, edamame)  I ordered (large island rice bowl): - NOTORIOUS RIB - SESAME CHICKEN - MACARONI SALAD - GRILLED PINEAPPLE - WHITE RICE  ...and I will continue to get this same order forever! The Notorious RIBs are perfectly marinated & cooked tender boneless short ribs, topped with a tasty slaw -- and the sesame chicken is so crispy & cunchy with a delicious flavorful side sauce that I just want to smother on EVERYTHING! The mac salad is a common necessary side staple, and the grilled pineapple is such a yummy sweet mix to add to the dish! We just barely finish our plate (even on our hungriest days) and just can't get over how satisfying, fresh and filling the food is! (He ordered the notorious rib, chicken katsu, mac salad and mixed veggies... but uses my sesame chicken sauce, haha.)  Will we be back? Without question! (We even had to vow to wait at least a week in between our next visit since we've been here so frequent!) Especially with this gem just around the corner from our house, located on Buffalo x Warm Springs next to the PT's Ranch. I love my order, but vow to definitely try other items on the menu (I have been eyeing the different kinds of elote like MISO-CORNY, or the KALUA PORK NACHOS and NOTORIOUS RIB BURRITO)! =)",

I was only one in line and the girl was so busy as I stood for 5 mins until I asked her \"Hi, is this where I order?\" And I got an Uh yeah look as she said \"I'm busy right now\" with a attitude. Excuse me! Well maybe an \"I'll be right with you\" would've been nice for a \"Ohana\" (family) restaurant. Finally she helped me set with no smile like she wanted to go home already. I get it, it's 15!'ins before closing but you're still not closed yet! Be nice. You're a new restaurant so show some customer service.   Fine, customer service sucked, if the food is worth the attitude then it will make up for it. I got the garlic chicken special they had and the flavor was actually decent however everything was drenched in soooo much sauce. The rice was sooo full of sauce and the salad was full of yucky dressing I couldn't eat it. Mac salad was less than average.   I left still hungry cuz of all the sauce on the food. Of course, no one says thank you when leaving. I don't recommend this place. Sorry to say.",

The pork was super crispy and meaty, like finely chopped lechon. Next I tried the Kalua pork sisig, and the smoked shredded meat melded nicely with the crunchy jalapenos and onions. My coworker got the notorious RIB burrito and wouldn't stop going on about how amazing it was. Needless to say, I've now ordered the notorious RIB rice bowl 3 times since. The macaroni salad is delicious as well as the grilled pineapple. I also like the edamame option. It's easy to order takeout on the yelp app and it's always on time. If you like Hawaiian fusion food, this place can't be beat.",

So I ordered the garlic shrimp plate and I loved it!! The garlic shrimp was full of flavors! I had it with brown rice, macaroni salad and lettuce (salad but it really was just plain lettuce). My coworker got the garlic chicken plate and I tried a chicken wing, it wouldn't say it was the best because I've had better, but it's still worth a try.

    "text": "Fists of Fusion combines Hawaiian food with a Filipino twist. In pictures, the food looked amazing with large-appearing bowls with picturesque protein atop rice and mac salad. In reality, the serving sizes are much smaller. When compared to the nearby Island Flavor, which has become my standard for Hawaiian fare, it falls short.   For lunch, the garlic shrimp plate was reminiscent of those shrimp trucks back on the islands. I enjoyed the heavy garlic flavor, and the buttery finish, but for $14, everything else was quite small and lackluster including the sides of rice and mac salad. I did think the shrimp was cooked better than the furikake shrimp from Island Flavor.  However, when it came to the rice bowls, you get a much better deal down the street on Durango. The servings of protein were small and un-filling. On top of that, the meat including the pork belly sisig and teriyaki chicken were haphazardly tossed together in the bowls. I think this place is deserving of another try for their crispy tocino spam musubi and their colorful elote, but I can only hope that the real deal is as mouth-watering as their social media pictures next time.",

I saw on their Instagram theyd always post their garlic chicken so I figure I ordered that and try it. It was amazing! I licked it down to the bone. It came with rice salad and Mac salad. You can substitute that salads as well. The garlic chicken was so flavorful!! I loved every part of that plate, I sub the Mac for green salad and the dressing was amazing!!! And I ordered their tropical lemonade and it was bomb! Had a tinge of POG in it. (Passion orange guava). The islanders know what's up. I'll definitely be back to try the shrimp plate next time",

    "text": "Checked out Fist of Fusion for the first time. Located in the SW area off of Buffalo and Warm Springs. The small strip mall they are located in is semi new and still construction on going currently.  Parking was not hard to find maybe due to the mall not being overly crowded yet. Entering the establishment it is pretty small inside with limited seatings and a walk up area to order food. The menu has its local touches, being from Hawaii we are particular with our local food selections. The menu does have alot of local touches but how does it taste????  We give it a 4/5....   On our menu today was the Loco Moco, Hawaii folks know exactly what that is. Hamburger patties over rice smothered with brown gravy and topped with over easy eggs ( or however you prefer your egg) i like my yolk to be dripping all over.. mmmmmmmm!!!!! The hubby had the island rice bowls, they have 3 different sizes to choose from dependent on how hungry you are. He had the 1 choice meat (Kalbi short ribs +$2 additional) 2 choice sides (stir fry veggies and mac salad) and of course WHITE RICE but they do have brown if you prefer it! We also tried the fried spam musubi so ono!!!!! And they have a POG lemonade say whattttt!!!! Real good! When ordering we peeped some corn on the cobs with different toppings. Elote, Flaming hot cheetoes were some of the flavors but hubby opted for the traditional butter and salted corn.  The ambience is definitely Hawaii esque. Local jams playing and a beautiful mural of home. I definitely wanna be back to try the garlic shrimp plate little on the pricier side but that ono pog lemonade is calling my name!",

This spot is basically if a Filipino Lady had a baby with an Hawaiian guy, their kid will be Fist of Fusion Island Grill :)   The food was pretty good. I tried some of my friends orders and it was yummy. I ordered the garlic shrimp. I was so excited because it reminded me of the shrimp trucks in Hawaii. (Reason for not receiving 5 stars) The garlic shrimp had wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy to much garlic and was very salty. I didn't even finish my meal.

I observed several mistakes by the staff repeatedly; wrong orders, wrong sides, missing sides, and people going up asking where thier food was. At one point one of thier employees ran in with bagfulls of meat from La Bonita! That just looked terrible, at least walk in from the back? Customer's should not have to see that. This was a huge red flag for me. My order took 25 minutes to come out, plus they gave me the incorrect rice. I ordered the the sisig as my protien and it was pretty bland. Only the sides I ordered (pinapple and macaroni salad) and fountain drink were really okay... My co-workers spam masubi barely had any spam and was stuffed with way more rice than it should have, and her veggie sides were soggy. I also got a rice bowl, and it was honestly more rice than my proteins and sides. I will not be back.",

My much anticipated wait to the restaurant did not fail.  Completely lived up to the video.   Everything about it was fantastic.  From the wall murals, to the music, to the entire island vibe, this was everything I had hoped.  Not sure if the workers were originally from Hawaii but they definitely exuded that True Aloha spirit.   I honestly wanted every single item on the menu. I actually ended up going back into line 3 times just because I couldn't make up my mind and wanted to sample everything.  I went to a fourth time bc I normally just drink water with my meals, but the POG lemonade caught my eye and when I returned to line yet again, the girl at the register comped my drink.  . I ended up getting the short rib burrito, honey garlic sriracha wings (which they catered to my needs of only the flappers!), and a kahlua pig sisig taco.   Oh my GOD, BECKY!!!   Every single thing had my taste buds doing a happy dance.   I wish I wasn't so full because I wanted to also try a shrimp platter and a few more Hawaiian fusion dishes.   I wish this was an AYCE or buffet because my mouth wanted everything on the menu but my stomach could only hold so much, haha.   I even bought 2 souvenir t-shirts!  Back in Vegas again in 2 weeks and cannot wait to return. I've already told my local Vegas friends about the establishment and they can't wait to go.  Two thumbs up, five stars, top notch local dining and I plan to return over and over again!",

Hawaiian/Asian Fusion fits that bill, as you can probably imagine. This is a counter service spot with a smaller, focused menu. We opted for the pork belly rice bowl and a short rib rice bowl. The small was plenty filling for a lunch portion and the flavors all worked. While we ate, a staffer offered us a churro on the house. It was amazing. It is covered in sugary goodness and addictively sweet! A+ for friendliness and helping us with the menu. Check this place out!",

Came with my friends and I and drove 40 minutes to come eat it and I would say it's a waste of my gas and time. The sesame chicken was too hard and the teriyaki chicken tasted and felt like it's been out for a long time. The macaroni salad is very watery also. For the price, it's a small portion and isn't worth at all. I called asking for a possibility for my money back and the lady started going into saying she was a part time nurse and that I would need to get a doctors notes for my $9-10 that I spent on the food. None of us finished our food and it's just a terrible place. I'll stick to L&L.",

It comes with your choice of white/brown rice or substitute for green salad. You also choose one or two sides depending on the size of your order (kids/regular/mixed) The sides to choose from are macaroni salad, stir fry vegetables, grilled pineapple, edamame and green salad. The macaroni salad is my favorite!   The staff here are wonderful! The cashier is always so friendly and always smiling. Songs/music videos from the Common kings , Anuhea, j. Boog, and other island reggae artists are heard throughout the restaurant. It can be a bit loud at times but very enjoyable.   The restrooms are located at the back of the restaurant and always clean!   I highly recommend giving them a try and be sure to check out their Instagram page for specials not on their regular menu!",

In this strip mall are a few places to choose from but I'm glad I came back here to Fist of Fusion Island Grill.  I ordered the crispy pork belly and kalbi ribs combo. Kalbi ribs - moist, tender and very flavorful. Crispy pork belly - oh WOW ... lau lau - yes,that's a ryhme, but, only in Hawai'i ;) Supah crispy brah and matched well with the creamy slaw. Check out the picture of our chicken katsu, kalbi ribs and freshly made churros w/furikake. Ronnie (the owner) was greeting the guests and asking everyone if they wanted to try the churros. Look, air is free and my nostrils are really big sooo ... yes please! Churros was very addicting!  Bottom line ... Great looking menu, can be really healthy because of the options. Lots of parking and as usual, service was very friendly. Mucho Mahalo to Ronnie for his hospitality and paying attention to the little details that makes guests like me become regulars.",

Sesame chicken, garlic chicken, pork belly sisig.  The sesame chicken seemed pretty much like the chicken katsu, didn't really taste any different.  Pork belly sisig didn't really have much flavor.  Garlic chicken is decent, But I've had better. Probably 2nd favorite dish here.  Notorious RIB might be my favorite dish here so far. The regular size is good enough for me since it the marinated ribs on top of a bed of rice, topped off with a little bit of kimchee and a Cole slaw looking salad with 2 sides of your choice. When you ask for the stir fry veggies I feel like they skimp out on the veggies.",

I went with a Mixed Bowl and chose Kalbi Short Ribs, Garlic Shrimp, Mac Salad, and Stir-Fry Vegetables. The bowl also came with two large scoops of rice.

However, I'm NEVER gonna order chicken wings from this place ever again. I ordered their garlic chicken special and they legit served it with a leg with a bunch of feathers on it.  Personally I thought it was kinda nasty. I saved this piece for last and plucked the feathers off and attempted to eat it but I kinda lost my appetite after it.   3 stars because generally this place is bomb for the most part but maybe quality control started to go down.",

    "text": "Looking at the reviews and see the advertised video on Facebook, I had high hopes for this place. I saw their burritos in the video and decided to go after work to get one. I ended up ordering platters instead because there were multiple things we wanted to try. I ordered a couple plates, one for myself and one for my husband. Mine was done right away and I had to sit and wait a good 15-20 minutes for his. There were only 2 other people in the place and one already had her food. By the time I got his, I left quickly because I was hungry and tired of waiting. We opened up our food and it looked really good so I was excited to try it out. And to my disappointment, all my food was cold, waiting for his to come out so I could get home and we could eat together. I wasn't very happy that I had to eat mine cold, especially after I paid extra for the RIB that I added. I'm sure the food would have been a lot better if I would have gotten to eat it hot. If one plate was going to have such a long wait, they should have waited and put both together at the same time. The food itself, was good, good flavors. I loved the RIB flavors.  On top of all this, the service I received when I got up to the counter, was definitely not 5 stars. The cashier didn't seem like she wanted to be there. Every question that I asked, she gave me attitude and made it seem like it was a stupid question I was asking. I'm sorry if it was my first time here and I had some questions. That kind of set the whole mood downhill as soon as I walked in, but since I was already there, I decided to order anyway.  Overall, I was really disappointed in my first experience here.",

The garlic shrimp plate is reminiscent of the famed north shore giovanni's shrimp truck. I sub the rice w salad to feel a little better about myself. And then I ruin it with their SUPER DELICIOUS (and probably very fatty) dressing. Ok then I've got a secret to share. I get their sesame chicken plate, extra chicken obvi, and use the sauce that comes with it and mix it with the salad dressing. voilaaaaaaa. enjoi! My favorite side is the grilled pineapple.  Ok, don't take offense to this FoF, but I think the tacos are good but they need work. The price is a little too high for the value of food. When I think sisig...i think ULTRA crispy and overflowin w sodium and umami.   On to the tocino spam musubi: My only complaint is........CAN U GIMME MORE for one order?   When you're done stuffing your face, you can also get different flavors elote like rainbow colored elote bc you gotta flex for the gram.  I can go on and on because i've tried so many different dishes but I think the standout is the sesame chicken. try it!",

    "text": "A fistful of flavors and a fistful of fusion. That's what you'll be getting at this Hawaiian fusion eatery on the Southwest side of town. They serve a variety of different entrees like traditional plates and the ever popular customizable bowls, but the star of the menu has to be their Notorious R.I.B Burrito. And the recipe for one of the main ingredients, the marinated beef short ribs, is literally the thing that started it all.   You're first presented with the burrito, evenly split into two, allowing you to take a peek of what's inside the stuffed behemoth. It's filled with what's basically in a regular Island Rice Bowl, but with several fusion elements. It's got plenty of the normal stuff, like the rice and chopped cabbage, but further in, there's the teriyaki, the honey chipotle, and the kimchi salsa to add the small kick of spice. There's also a serving of the mac salad in there. Boy, oh, boy was that a good call on them. And last, but not least, the star: the Notorious R.I.B marinated and diced boneless short ribs.  Just one bite into the burrito, and you'll know this whole flavor combination was meant to be. Unsurprisingly, it's got loads of sweetness to it, but with an ample amount of savory flavors and the rice to counteract it. Each ingredient stands out wonderfully, having a taste of the spotlight one by one. I cannot say enough good things about it, except that I wish there was more of it per order.   This burrito might just be my new guilty pleasure and that's saying a lot.",

That's exactly what I got at Fist of Fusion.  The portions are small too.  Each hamburger patty on the Loco Moco was about 2.5 inches in diameter or about 2 ounces in weight.  The side of chicken Katsu was also on the small side and no more than about 3 ounces.  It's safe to say that I am not a fan.   I don't see myself coming back anytime soon.",

    "text": "Decided to try this place out since I've been seeing their ads all over Facebook.   Fist of Fusion - as the name states - is a fusion style restaurant. They fuse both Hawaiian food along with Asian Food and maybe other cultures.   Walking in.. you'll get a little sense of the \"Aloha Spirit\" and \"Cali Vibes\" with music playing and a lot of light coming in through their windows making it nice and bright in there..   Upon ordering.. Staff is very friendly and explained what they had to offer..   Decided to get their Chicken Katsu Burrito and Tocino Spam Musubi and POG Lemonade. (Yes, I can eat!)  Food came out in a reasonable amount of time and everything looked and tasted great! - it did make my stomach feel a little uneasy afterwards though.. (not used to fusion style foods) and the POG Lemonade was perfect for the 100+ degree weather in Las Vegas.   CONS: My other family members wanted to order their Kalbi Short Ribs.. but they were all out!! - on a Sunday at 12pm - lunch time? When they just opened an hour ago? Whaaaaaa? - Either someone came in before us and ordered all their Kalbi.. or a major poor planing/food ordering issue going on.. Not sure about any other days, but it got really busy afterwards and people were getting bummed out that there was no Kalbi..  Other than that, well try this place out again in the future.  Enjoy!",

Secondly, their mac salad was just a little watery for my taste. Other than that...their POG lemonade was delicious and refreshing and their kalbi ribs had amazing flavor. I'll definitely come back and try something new off the menu!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came here last night for dinner after receiving a nice message on Yelp along with a $30 gift certificate from the owner, Ronnie. The second we walked through the door, we were immediately greeted by friendly staff. While looking through the menu, the staff were helpful in answering any questions we had. We saw that the wings were a new item on the menu and one of the guys at the front recommended it to us. Because we couldn't make up our mind what flavor to choose (either garlic or sriracha), it was nice of him to suggest that we could order it half and half so that we could try both. In addition, my boyfriend ordered his usual mix bowl- kalua pork and sesame chicken with mac salad and a green salad (which was also upon recommendation to try) and I ordered a regular bowl- crispy pork belly sisig with mac salad and edamame. We ordered the food to go and brought it home. To our surprise, my boyfriend's mixed bowl was now in a container which made it a lot better in presentation rather than it being packed in a large bowl. We also loved how that there was now an even ratio of meat, rice, and sides. As for the food, everything was delicious. We especially loved the wings. It was crispy and extremely flavorful.   Overall, the food and service here was fantastic! We were extremely happy with everything. We will definitely be back again. Mahalo Ronnie and the staff at Fist of Fusion.",

You have a choice of two sides - mac salad, edamame, veggies or a salad and you can pick either brown rice or white rice. The burritos are also a must! They are huge so make sure you tell them to cut it in half because you will likely need to save the other half for later! Check this place out!",

    "text": "We went for dinner last night, 7/13. First off the service was amazing. The girls behind the counter were awesome. It was our family's first time there. One in particular, who's name I didn't get, but definitely should have took the time to help my dad navigate the menu and order his food. Even though there was a line forming she didn't rush us to make a decision or make us feel pressured in any way. We finished paying and I had forgotten to order the UniCorn for my daughter. She added it on right away with no hesitation whatsoever.   While we waited for our food we got our drinks and my daughter colored with some of the crayons and paper provided.  Anything that keeps her busy while waiting for food is great with me. The wait was a little long but in their defense there was a lot of people who ordered, not only in store, but over the phone and grubhub as well. The food finally came and it was delicious! So worth the wait. We ordered one of each of the tacos, chicken katsu bowl, chicken salad, Notorious R.I.B., crispy pork belly, and sesame chicken. First off the Notorious R.I.B was MEAN!!! I could eat my weight in that meat it was so ONO... the kalua pig was a little salty but the sauce that came with it on the taco mellowed it out.. it was a perfect pairing... overall the food was great.. The girl who helped us at the register checked on us throughout dinner and even gave my daughter a tiny tiny cone of ice cream... she was awesome..I can't say enough good things about her...well done FOF..well done!",

The bubbly delicious Pepsi from their Pepsi fountain was the perfect compliment to lunch- thank you for serving my favorite soda!   Nice size portions of everything! The sesame chicken was very crispy which I love - soggy chicken is never a good thing- and the sauce was sweet and paired perfectly with the brown rice. The mac salad was one of the best I've had- creamy and full of flavor. The green salad was fresh green leaf lettuce with a light, sweet dressing. I saved the fresh grilled pineapple for last and it absolutely hit the spot.",

    "text": "Sooo the wife and I were looking for places near by which had good reviews. I remember having a friend post a picture of the meals he had while he was there, boy did they look amazing. I asked the wife if she wanted to give Fist of Fusion a shot and she was on board.   I ordered the Loco Moco (which I have had at another place close by) and I have to truthful and say that this is probably the best Loco Moco I have ever had! The burger was cooked to perfecting, the egg was tasty, and the gravy with mushroom was absolutely delicious!   The wife ordered the Garlic Shrimp and she absolutely loved it. We placed an order for pick-up online and were a bit hesitant on if they would get things right. But they nailed it, the shrimp was peeled like we wanted and the order was flawless. I got a taste of her Garlic Shrimp and again, I wasn't let down. It was incredible.   I never post reviews on yelp, as this is my first one ever. I want this to be my first review because this place is freaking awesome. Although it's a start to explore more of the menu, we recommend this for all who are in the area and want a damn good meal for a great price.   Great Job Fist of Fusion and welcome to SW Las Vegas.",

Island reggae tunes playing and even the menu looked promising. We ordered the garlic shrimp plate, notorious rib taco, elote, and the kids chicken teriyaki bowl.  Everything was so overly sweet and sugary! The shrimp were kinda soggy and elote was ok for four bucks.  It was worth a try but I don't see myself coming back when there are other solid options available.",

Now that we have, we can't understand the negative ones as this was truly an excellent experience.   We had the Loco Moco, I have had it everywhere across the West Coast during my travels and I say this is one of, if not the best tasting ones I have ever had.  The patties were perfect size, egg cooked my way, and amazing gravy with mushrooms and onions. I had to order a side of gravy for the left over fried rice from the other meal since it was so good.  we also had the Garlic Shrimp meal which had 10 amazing pieces that were delicious.  It was so de to have something that is just outside the norm of the unusual Hawaiian type food.  The people were really nice and the owner/manager, whoever she was delivered my extra gravy and brought us a few ounces of her special Churro creations just to thank us. We will be back to try the rest of the menu items.",

Had to wait in line for a while and then it took 15 minutes for the food to be ready, but it was right after noon, so that's what I get for going during peak rush.   I ordered the large portion of pork belly sisig bowl with brown rice, macaroni salad and veggies. I appreciated the big portions and the everything was tasty. There were a few pieces of the pork skin that were over-fried to point of I couldn't chew them up, but that was not prevalent and I don't want to over-emphasize this.  Bottomline, I'm going to go back again, hopefully when it's less busy, and give it another try.",

(Didn't take long I was just starving) I loved how bright and inviting it was in there. The elote is unique and delcious. I had the uni-corn my bf had the miso-corny elote. Both good but I preferred the uni-corn. The miso corny was a bit bold for my taste. Also this is where I found my love for musubi. The pink sauce is out of this world and I can't wait to go back to try their bowls!",

Got the garlic shrimp plate and garlic chicken wing bowl. Shrimp LOOKED amazing and fried to a perfection, however they aren't fried at all... Whatever that is that's on the shrimp is wet mush, zero crunch. It was disappointing and I feel bamboozled. The wings had an amazing flavor but were overcooked! They were so tough to eat it was crazy, I was chewing so long my jaws hurt. The only thing I ate completely was the macaroni salad because I was so hungry and nothing else was cutting it. I went home a little less rich and still hungry.",

Anyway, the first time I ordered 2 bowls with 1 protein so I chose kalbi beef for one and sisig pork belly for the other. Generous portions and filling! The 2nd time I was telling my friends about it and raving how good everything was so we decided to order out. I ordered the same thing as my first and this time around the portions were significantly smaller, that was kind of disappointing especially after raving about this place to my friends. Now today after a long day at work I placed an order for pick up looking forward to my boneless short ribs & sisig pork belly with white rice... but instead I got brown rice and some breaded chk & my sisig pork belly. I had to check my order thinking maybe I chose the wrong options, but nope I didn't. Totally disappointed! And I think I even got charged extra for the boneless kalbi ribs that I didn't even get. I wish I checked my order before leaving because I'm way too tired to drive there after working a 10 hr shift. But at least they got my bf's order right, I'll just have to eat some of his kalbi beef ribs!",

It is all my favorite kind of food in one place. I can get my Hawaiian, Asian (Dominantly Filipino influences), and Mexican food fix all at one place. The fact they have elotes here is what made me consider coming here.  I ordered the mango chicken tacos but for whatever reason I didn't get the mango salsa on my order. Nevertheless, it was still good. You get to order between corn or flour tortillas.  My husband ordered the kalua pig/sisig and Kalbi plate. I tried his food, and I got so freaking excited! The kalbi had a good amount meat on it; none of those skinny ass ribs you would normally find. They tasted so good! I was blown away when I tried the kalua pig/sisig 'cause it was like no other kalua pig I've tried before. It's a bit tangy, which is what made me literally obsess over it. Almost like a Sinigang tamarind sort of taste.   Definitely worth driving from the north west. We're coming back!",

I'm sure it's good but not ready for this combo.     We ordered the garlic shrimp plate, crispy pork belly sisig bowl, crispy spam musubi and the Notorious RIB taco.  All were delicious especially with the pairing of POG lemonade.  I was kind of sad there was no corn, but heard it was just for today.  We will be back to try the corn!!!

    "text": "For the record, the service was great, but I didn't come to this place to hang out with their staff. It really surprised me how poorly executed the meal was. Like literally it was offensive. The Notorious RIB texture wise came out like mush, guessing someone boiled the meat in the marinade as opposed to sauteing it and probably did it for 3+hours. The Crispy Pork Belly SiSig was essentially pork belly / skins mixed with Kalua pork. Which sadly the kalua pork was so over cooked, it was salty mush, and the pork belly seemed like it was three to four times cooked, because it was so chewy and dry it was actually inedible. And the cilantro lime sauce that was supposed to compliment the sisig? Well I'm pretty sure it was a sour cream base for the sauce because that's all I tasted.   I gave my meal away.",

You had me salivating!).   I had the garlic shrimp plate with steamed rice, macaroni salad, and a side of greens with no dressing (kind of mad I didn't the coleslaw from the pics!). Super satisfied with the shrimp; so big, very great garlic flavor and amazingly seasoned. Macaroni salad looked delicious, but lacked taste, and rice was a bit wetter than I'd hoped.   I took away a star because it was empty, and not busy, but most tables were dirty, and the floors were dirty. It's a turn off to eat in a place where you couldn't get comfy while you ate. The Tapatio bottle was SUPER grimy and greasy, and it was needed for the flavorless Mac salad.   I'll come back again to try the pork or have the shrimp again (with brown rice and no greens), and maybe bring my own Tapatio.",

The place is small, seats about 20-25 people...maybe. A bit congested if the place was full. It has a cool wall painting.   We ordered the R.I.B burrito, a couple of bowls (rice, crispy pork belly, R.I.B meat, chicken katsu, Mac salad), Mexicorn and Cheetoscorn, and Kailua pork nachos. The food was very delicious, good portions, and pleasing to the eyes.   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves Hawaiian/Island food. The staff and the chefs were awesome, great customer service and very friendly. I'll be coming back real soon!",

    "text": "I decided to try this place 1- I'm from Hawaii, 2- the line at the new Fukuburger location was long. There was only one couple ahead of me in line.   I ordered the chicken katsu with MAC salad and grilled pineapple. While I waited, I asked to sample their ube ice cream. That was delicious. Everyone was super friendly, the vibe is chill, exactly what you'd expect from an island joint.   When my order was called, I was a little surprised at how small the bowl was. Typically, True local-style restaurants give you a lot of food. It was $9, which is about the same cost of a plate from Ohana BBQ or L&L's. I also tipped them (for being so friendly.)  The chicken katsu was so underwhelming. It was disappointing. The little cup of sauce isn't even enough to last through your whole meal, and that says a lot since the meat portion isn't generous by any means. (Especially if you're craving chicken katsu, this location is close enough to Ohana BBQ on Durango, you might as well go there. Much tastier and larger portions.) The mac salad was by far, the worst I've ever tasted. Absolutely NO flavor. Even the rice didn't taste good... how do you mess up WHITE RICE at an island spot? Sadly, the best part was the grilled pineapple.   So I guess if you're looking for good grilled pineapple, this is your spot.   but if you're looking for good local food- this isn't it.",

    "text": "Filipino-Hawaiian fusion food is right up my alley so I was excited to check this place out. Staff was friendly and service was fairly quick.   We ordered a keiki size Notorious RIB, the new garlic chicken plate, and a kalua pork sisig taco. The RIB short rib was so tender! The flavors were well developed and it reminded me of something my mom would make. Total comfort food. The bowl came with rice, a cabbage slaw, and I chose the mixed veggies as my side. The garlic chicken plate is a new item that was posted near the register. It had chicken wings coated in the same sauce as the garlic shrimp (per the staff member) and came with rice, Mac salad, and green salad - but we opted for mixed veggies instead. Chicken wings were good but nothing spectacular. It's definitely a flavor I've had at other places. The Mac salad was really bland and greasy for some reason. The mixed veggies on both dishes were cooked just the way I like them - a little on the soft side. The taco had a good amount of pork and the taco shell was fresh. But, it was a kalua pork SISIG taco and none of the tangy, spicy sisig flavors were there. If anything, it was a little under seasoned.   Overall, not a bad meal. There are lots of other menu items I'd like to give a try someday.",

    "text": "Heard about another local food spot just opened in Vegas. Always always stay down when comes to local food not only because from 808 but best comfort food ever two scoops rice, mac salad, and entree. I must admit had my reservations cause over the past twenty years living in Vegas (or locals know call Vegas the ninth island) almost over saturated with local spots. The ones that truly stand out for me is individual family own restaurant nothing to do with chains (not that hater still good). Not only does Fist of Fusion Island Grill stand out writing it or saying it out loud. It truly embodies Ohana. I never had conversation with Ronnie or Lisa but reading other reviews. Chef Ronnie was making the rounds asked me how was everything I had for lunch. A new business when see the owner takes time out to come out get feedback from every guest. Not only does it show his passion for his food, also like past review shows that each customer is not customer but part of the Ohana, and felt like living back in the 808.  So first impression was talk about feeling the Aloha spirit! Not only on the wall with coolest sign that the world needs more of. The staff shouting out Mahalos and welcome. They were consistent with every one that came in the hour chilling having my lunch. It small restaurant but has lot of personality in it. The art work on the wall soon walk in. It pretty much covers that whole wall. It looks very much original. It vibrant colors that screams at you. Hula girl with ukulele. Just chilling on the beach. The shaka sign from the logo to the open and close sign on the door. The sit down counter area. It screams personality but very much 808. Above they have three wide screens. The music!!!! So awesome!!! It totally local style Hawaiian music.  The food the menu has nice diversity to it. It not huge menu. It broken down to bowls, burritos, tacos, salads, apps, and ono grindz. It was my first visit not sure where to start. I know the Crispy Torino Span Musubi. One of the reasons came. I have been in this non spam musubi style kick. I seen the katsu style spam musubi but never had one. Talk about WINNAH. I know seen others that the whole musubi is deep fried. Never had so no going compare. I feel Crispy Torino Spam Musubi. If going katsu style this does Spam Musubi right. Only the Spam that breaded katsu style with the panko action. The rest of it is normal spam musubi. The part that separates Crispy Torino Spam Musubi from nothing had before is the tocino sauce. It perfect compliment to the crispy breading with what tastes like aioli based sauce or am guessing. Good. My entree went with the Sesame Chicken Bowl. The bowl comes in three different sizes. I went with the large. Talk about choke food. I was hungry after morning swim set. The amount of chicken give you is local style, the two scoops of rice is mound not scoop, and bowls come with choice of sides. I went with mac salad (cause dah two scoops rice mac salad need I say more) and stir fry vegetables. The mac salad was solid and the stir fry vegetables was nice medley of all fresh vegetables nice crispy and tell fresh vegetables. I was loved the sauce that coated the chicken and then get some on the side. All good stuff.  Little touch comes details. All the bowls or notice all the bowls coming out that day. They had flower in them. It nice one that see back home. All I was thinking if going out of way make it feel like Hawaii that nice touch.   No doubt plan on coming back because close to my house. The boneless short ribs other dish torn apart to try first. This churro missed out on need try some of that too. Till the next time...",

I heard good things about this place and I knew it was fairly new so here we're going to be some flaws.  I love their menu options and the selection. It's a cute small joint that serves it purpose and does a good job! My only critique is once you place your order it does take quite a while to receive your order. I do understand that they make your order fresh to order, but it does take longer than usual.   I admit the wait was worth it, I love the sweet and salty savory taste of the Crispy Pork Belly appetizer (plus when I came in it was free with a yelp check in!). I order a rice bowl with the crispy pork as well and it was basically the same as the appetizer but I didn't mind it! It was still sooo amazing and yummy! I will be coming back to try more!

That burrito with the kalbi ribs, the nachos, the Cheeto-lote, bowls, everything was PHENOMENAL. CANT WAIT TO GO BACK!!! Although them being right up the street will likely hurt my bank account lol",

The prices are fantastic for the amount of food you get. I could only eat half my bowl and had to bring the rest home it was amazing. I love good service too and they were amazing so friendly and timely I love it. We'll definitely be here at least twice a month",

    "text": "First time eating here and it was sooo delicious! I ordered the Kalua pork nachos and the sauce was to die for! Everything about was perfect and it filled me up pretty quick. I also tried the crunchy spam musubi and I'm normally a person who just likes to stick to the regular musubi but wow this one was a game changer. There's a pink sauce on it that tastes so good and the crunch of the breaded spam was on point! I also tasted a garlic shrimp from my boyfriends plate and thought that was close to the garlic shrimp from Hawaii. Lastly I tried the Ube and pineapple ice cream in a Keiki cup and the flavor was delicious! Totally recommend making room for that after your meal. The shop itself was very clean and ascetically pleasing reminded me of home. The workers were so friendly always checking up on my family and I. 14/10 recommend coming here and spreading the aloha! I'll be back for sure!",

Not only did they reached out and apologize but they also replaced my order with 2 huge burritos and a nice chicken plate!  I can honestly say this is customer service at its best!!Replacing my order would have been sufficient so the extra add ons were truly an unexpected pleasant surprise!!  Thank you Lisa and Ronnie!!",

    "text": "First timer...I usually stay away from anything with the word \"fusion\" in it, ESPECIALLY local (hawaiian) food. My local food should be, well, local food. Call me old fashioned but if I'm craving local food, I'd like it to be how it supposed to be, not \"fused\" It's kinda like having a favorite song you had since small kid time, but then somebody else sings it and changes it up... doesn't sound right huh? But it was on the way home so I decided to try it. I was greeted as soon I came in, the staff is full of aloha, very helpful. Clean, comfortable environment. I asked what was the popular dish and they suggested the notorious rib, so I got that. Took it home and ate it...meh... it's different. They put a sauce on it where the first couple bites were good, but then I got used to the flavor and it didn't appeal to me anymore. Not sure if I'll come back, this is just my opinion, I'm sure a lot of people like it",

There's just a bunch of kids working there and the music is too loud that they probably can't even hear what you're ordering. but instead of verifying with you, they just place the wrong order and you only find that out until you've waited forever just to get the wrong thing. Went in with 2 friends and all three of us had our order wrong in one way or another. The lady who seemed to be the owner said she would correct it, and she let us keep the mistake order...but then we never even got the correct food in the end. Pathetic. We were tired of waiting that we just left. Sucks because we tipped them $5 at the register but this was before we knew what we were getting ourselves into.",

So for you Veggie eaters, there's even dishes made just for your discriminating taste.  Ask for the free Hawaiian style Churros.",
