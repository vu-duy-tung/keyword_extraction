Fairly long line and wait but it was worth it! You can either do a single slice of pizza (each topping extra) or buy a whole pizza. My slice came out to $6 with 3 toppings on it and wished I got two slices! The slices are pretty big but are very thin. They throw your selected toppings on a slice of cheese pizza and throw it back in the oven to cook. It tasted great! Definitely a place to hit up in Vegas if you're craving pizza!",

Staying at the Cosmo, my husband and I decided to take full use of our amazing room and bask in the glory of pizza on our balcony overlooking the Bellagio water show. In about twenty minutes, our pizza was ready and we were on that elevator so fast. The pizza was very good and a nice break from formal dining on the Strip. Highly recommended for those general hankerings for pizza in Vegas.",

I liked white pizza and mushroom pizza.  Also, you can create your own pizza. Crust was thin and crispy, cheese was melting so nicely in my mouth. I want to know how they're make tomato sauce.  While you're wating for your order you can see how they are make your pizza, it was one of interesting part. It's fresh, crispy, and nice pizza ever. I will try again soon.",

Hidden away on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan, completely unmarked, down a long photo covered hallway, Secret Pizza is a heavenly find.  Here, you can buy full pizzas or slices.  Since we were just having lunch, my friend and I both ordered slices and a soda.  Choosing from the options on hand, I got two slices of meatball and ricotta.  They were AMAZING!  Thin, perfectly crispy crust, with ample portions of sliced meatball and ricotta blotches, and just the right amount of sauce in between.  Make your selection and the guy behind the counter cuts your slice and places it in the oven to reheat and crisp up, giving you a beautifully hot, melty slice of pizza goodness!",

First off, the SMELL is different. it smells so delicious, nothing i have ever smelled of in a pizza! The taste is off the hook. A bit greasy you but you need that grease and carb to soak all that alcohol up from partying at Marquee. :p We got the combo, the one with everything in it and it is seriously the best pizza i have ever ate in my life! The crust is not thick but not crunchy thin either.  Pizza came out relatively fast, about 15 minutes for a whole pizza. Time goes by fast though when your having fun. Located on the 3rd floor in a dark hallway next to some store... The floor where they have the pool table along with other old antiquey games.",

Clues: Third floor of the cosmopolitan. If you see the pool table, you're getting close.  Hallway lined with album covers.   This little place only offers about five seats, but guests can grab a seat outside where the pool table is. It also has a pinball machine and an arcade game. Something to keep you busy if there is a wait.   Slices are about 3 to 4 dollars, and are decently sized. There wasn't too much sauce on it, which I fully appreciate. And the sausage was good, and had a bit of kick to it. They have a couple beers on hand. I can't remember the other one, but the one of the selections was PBR. I was disappointed by both choices, and opted out of getting the beer.   Overall, awesome place to go to if you're in the area. I just wish this wasn't tucked away on the Strip, because like most locals - I tend to stay away from the Strip and the tourists [who never seem to follow the crosswalk signs, and insist on crossing the street even if it isn't their turn].",

Just follow the drunk people up the escalator and look for the long hallway (and line).  I happen to adore the white pizza and anything with mushrooms, but honestly  all the flavors look awesome. Yes, the prices are higher than the flyover state you might call home, but you will likely be tipsy and exhausted by the time you make it over so you won't mind.  The very worst thing about this place is standing in line and watching what feels like an endless number of people walk past you with yummy slices. It will take a while if you are in the post club crowd. Don't expect a whole pizza either on a busy night- you could be looking at an hour wait or more (after you wait 30+ minutes in line).",

The guy was also busy making pizza for a large group order. It was cool to see the guy making pizza. He didn't toss the dough. He just flatten and pushed out.   The pizza was really good. Crisp pepperoni surrounded by oozing cheese and perfectly seasoned sauce on a crispy crust. Delicious!   Another friend went at 1am and it took almost an hour for him to get a slice of pizza. He didn't care for the pizza too much.   It's about $3/slice for cheese and $3.50/slice for one topping.  Great price for dining. Limited seats inside but a lot more outside.",

To get to the good stuff, walk down a cool hallway with every square inch covered in vintage albums. Once you've made it to the ordering counter, you're presented with a cool pinball machine and many different kinds of pizzas. There are very large pizzas presented to you along with a few shiny stainless steel pizza ovens along with some peeps to help you decide on which slice to buy.  When I went the first time during the opening week of the Cosmopolitan hotel, I noticed that an authentic Italian pizza creator from a local pizza joint had switched jobs! At first I said to myself, oh no what happened. And then I thought about it. If this guy works at the secret pizza joint now, I'll be able to sample some excellent pizza more often, so I'm ok with that. The pizza creator recognized me and just handed me a slice to test out.

Sure enough, we were drunk and starving after a couple hours of video poker at the bar and a small dinner at Jaleo. My husband usually doesn't eat dairy or gluten, but after five Manhattans, that went out the window. We decided to get a whole pie with olives and mushrooms.  Even drunk, we knew it was just an ok pizza. It wasn't bad, but it didn't meet my expectations. It was pretty pricey too, but I know that's a silly thing to complain about on the Strip.

We got there around 12am and boy, the line was already way out the door!   I've heard many good things about the \"white\" pizza - $5.50 a slice, and was so so glad that they had it !  I thought it was pretty good but nothing out of this world. The blend of mozzarella and ricotta cheese with garlic--- Yum! The crust is thin and cooked well !  They also have other assorted pizza slices -- sausage & pepperoni, cheese, combo, pepperoni, mushroom, etc...",

It's conveniently located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan so you can head on over after dancing the night away at Marquee. It's not on the directory and there's no sign, but that's why you have Yelp for.  Secret Pizza is New York style pizza so it's thin crust, which is my favorite type! I don't think I've tried any other flavor other than the WHITE PIZZA. That's all I really need. White pizza is simple yet delicious. It's just ricotta and mozzarella cheese. I love folding my pizza in half and eating it like a sandwich... so good!  This past weekend I ate two slices but didn't get to finish my last slice and I fell asleep with only the crust left. My friend came back to the room and she was starving so she ate my crust LOL. She said it was delicious still...   YAY FOR SECRET PIZZA BEING OPEN LATE & PROVIDING GOOD PIZZA FOR ALL US DRUNK PEOPLE!",

We were almost about to give up, when we asked one of the folks who works there and found the way. A narrow passage leads to Secret Pizza.  We got two slices of pizza, one is white pizza with different varieties of cheese and another one was with veggies and pepperoni. I liked the white pizza, although I thought both were too oily. I liked the pizzas, but nothing extraordinary about them. Also thought they were on the pricey side.",

I love that they do not have any signs or advertisements for this place. Even the pizza boxes are blank! Now, it isn't a secret because everything loves it! I'm sure Yelp helped!  The first couple of times I have pepperoni but once I tried to white pizza, I fell in love! It's amazing!! If I'm ordering a whole pie, I will get half and half. I like that they have this option to get two completely different pizzas in one!  I recently took my nephew when he was in town and he said it's the best pizza he has ever had! I agree :)  Pizza by the slice available. One slice and soda was about $8. Yummy :)",

The space is tiny because, you know, this place   is supposed to be a secret. So be prepared to rub up against the barely dressed especially at this hour. I was faded so I didn't care.   Staff was on point! They were hustling and bustling taking care of the crowd in a timely manner. Kudos for being open late (because what is sleep in this city).    We went with a whole pie with pepperoni and onion for around $31. It fed four of us, 2 slices each with two slices left over. It took about 30min.  Lemme just say, a whole pie freshly made is way better than buying by the slice. So my take away is to buy an entire pie, eat your drunk self into a beautiful, cheesy carb coma, wake up with a slight hangover and cure that crap with delicious cold but awesome pizza. Plus, if you're splitting it between a few people, it totally comes out cheaper than all y'alls getting your own slices.  4 stars because I still prefer a slice from the pizza joint in NY, NY across the way from The Bar at Time Square.

There's a few seats along the wall to sit at, with some arcade games inside I think. The line, like a NYC pizzeria at the same hour, was huge and moved pretty slow. There was really only one guy taking orders and one making the pizza, causing deathly long wait times. They should definitely have more workers on the weekends if that's the SOP. The pizza is actually pretty good, large slices with a good crunch. Just know you won't be able to grab and go as fast as you think.",

    "text": "Oh what to say about this place?  I have been wanting to come here for years and years, essentially since the Cosmo opened and never did because the lines were always so long which only drove me to want to go there more because of how good it must be.  Luckily I had a concert here the other day and had enough time beforehand to go and grab some of their 'za with a friend of mine.  I guess the easiest way to go from here is a pros and cons list.    Pros: Quality ingredients In the Cosmo which in and of itself is a pro Nice staff The pizza actually tasted pretty good, not amazing as others have stated, but pretty good  Cons: Super pricey, especially if you are hungry.  At least $5.25 per slice?  That's extreme.  Whole pizza for $35?  Not the worst I've seen but still outrageous.  Now, the stupid thing is if you want to make a whole pizza out of 8 random slices, they charge you by the slice which I honestly get but was still in shock a bit.   Drinks are pricey, just like everywhere else in the Cosmo.  $4.25 for water and $10 for a tall beer.   Really long line and wait, easily 40 minutes, even if you want just a slice.   They heated our pizza up back in the oven but not long enough so the majority it was lukewarm.  For all of the hype that I have heard about this being the best pizza in the state and the best pizza people have ever had, I was really disappointed.  I will not be going back and I suggest that people try other places and expand their palates.  I get that everybody has their own opinions but there is better pizza out there and for a way cheaper price.",

    "text": "Honestly this place is probably one of the better eats if you want something quick, fast, and not break your bank prices. But that's not the point. I don't mind dropping a few hundred bucks on an amazing experience in Vegas, but what fell short for me was the customer service here.   When you first walk in 9 times out of 10 you'll be stopped in your tracks due to the line that is down the walk way and could possibly be out the entrance all together. Line moves fairly quick and if you're ordering slices you get the right away but if you're ordering a whole pizza it could take 45 minutes or so. They have many diff options to choose from like toppings or even red or white sauce.   We ordered a pizza and it took about 30-40 minutes.   Pizza was decent size and came out piping hot and had a decent amount of cheese and topping but honestly for the price of $32 for a whole pizza I figured it would be waaaay better.  So reason I will never come back here?  And I wouldn't recommend anyone I know to come back here? Well employees and staff are beyond rude. I understand that they probably deal with a lot of customers who are drunk and or rude but come on, you chose to work in customer service and worse you chose to work in Vegas where you're going to come up against people like that all the time. Nonetheless doesn't give employees a right to be rude to everyone because they know that people are going to come and eat here regardless. One employee in particular named Steven was beyond rude and didn't care that he was openly rude to customers. Makes me wonder if management knows and if they even care.  Don't come here waste your time in line and money. Better to go elsewhere and be treated with respect.",

This place is tricky to find since there are no signs (hence the name) but well worth the trip to visit when you are hungry, FYI its on the 3rd floor of the cosmo hotel. Simple set up, counter, order, pay, eat/leave. They have thin crust(i guess a ny style) pizza as well as a Sicilian style option. During my visit stuck to the ny style pepperoni and  white pizza. Both were delicious, thin and perfectly crispy as i prefer. The service here was friendly and fast, the line here gets long but it moves steadily. For late night eats this is one of my absolute favorite places in las vegas.",

We located it down a long hallway on the 3rd floor.   They give you a choice of several pre-made pizza's and reheat them to order. I decided on a mushroom and pepperoncini slice and a smart water. ($6.50 a slice and $4.50 for the water) The pizza slice was flat and very crisp. The portion of cheese and sauce was balanced so that it did not weigh down the crust or make it greasy. There was a scattering of mushrooms baked into the cheese and the pepperoncini was tossed onto it after it was heated. I liked it and would return on another visit.",

The owners were from statin  island yadda yadda. So I had to give them a try.   Well. Finding the place took a bit. So much so. I ended up going to another place for lunch. That night at 4am we were coming back from the club. Decided secret pizza was the spot. Took awhile but we found it. The line. Was crazy long!!!  It was a good 25-30 min wait in line for pizza. No joke. Everyone was drunk in the line. It was this narrow hallway. One way in one way out. People were saying excuse me trying to get through. It sucked. Finally. We got up to the counter.   One of the guys asked what we wanted. So I told him in from NY. I don't eat any pizza out of state. I heard you guys were legit. Please don't disappoint me. The guy laughed.  He said he was from the island. His brother moved out here and started the business. He talked with me for a few mins. Then said hold on one min man. He turned around. Reached under a counter and pulled a pizza out. Then warmed it up in the oven. He came back and said I'll take care of you man. Apparently. If I'm understanding what he did. The pizza on display and what people were ordering were NY style pizza. The special under the counter local NY pizza he pulled out was there original pizza.  It was pretty cool.   The pizza was really good. I only eat pizza in NY sometimes jersey. But this was the closest thing to NY pizza I have had on the west coast. Really good thin crust pizza just like home.   Overall. I stay at the cosmo every year. I will 100% be back here. Hopefully next time the wait isn't as long. But the pizza was really good",

My friends and I went looking for this place because we heard about it through a friend.  We had to ask for help to find this place...no wonder we couldn't find it.  There's no name posted outside and you have to go through a long hallway.  The line can get pretty long, so the wait of course is long, and you have to wait even longer (30-40 min) until your pizza is ready.  Whole pizzas are nearly 30 bucks.  What a rip.  Since it was pricey, I was expecting good pizza or like the best.  During our wait, my friend and I got water from the water dispenser.  That thing is so slow.  Someone needs to adjust the nozzle.  Just to fill a cup, you have to wait about a minute...how ridiculous is that!  My friends and I ordered a pizza with sausage, dried tomatoes, and cheese.  We hung out outside for a long while...  Finally, when our pizza was done, we ate it and wasn't amazed.  It was at least fulfilling to our appetite.  We ate it at the couches and was approached by a promoter who had just moved to Vegas from London.  Nice fellow...  He's never been to this pizza place before so we gave him a slice to try.  We even gave a slice to our taxi driver when we made our way out.  Maybe they'll decide to drop by this place sometime.  If you don't mind waiting, why not try this place out at least once...",

It's so well-hidden that it's easy to miss if you don't know it's there. You go down a dark, narrow hallway to find this hole-in-the-wall type place. Decor is nice, like the rest of the casino. It has a cute subway vibe and is very clean.   I had a pepperoni and mushroom (red sauce) slice, and my hubby had a spinach and feta (white sauce) slice. The crust was thin and chewy. The pizza tasted good, but was a little on the greasy side.   Yes, it's tastier than your typical Pizza Hut, Dominos, Papa Johns, Costco, or any chain pizza joints. However, $5 for a thin slice is too much. $30 for a whole pie is out of the question. There are so many better deals in Vegas.   I've tried it now (and it is good), but I'm not willing to shell out that much money for a slice of pizza. We left hungry after eating a slice each, but we didn't want to spend another $10 there.  Pricey, for sure.  I don't care how high the rent is - it's not Disneyland or a baseball game. Geez. Not a winner in my book.",

While I wasn't totally blown away I would have to disagree with that and I definitely think it's better than mall pizza like Sbarro's.  We paid $28 for four slices (two with sausage and mushroom, one white pizza, and one pepperoni and mushroom pizza) and two bottles of water.  Customer service was terrible and the place was super packed and cramped so I couldn't wait to get out of there.  Glad to say I can try it but I'm ready to try other pizza places like the Grimaldi's that are going to be opening on the Strip.",

If you look down the hallway and see a vintage arcade game machine at the end, then you've found it.    It's thin crust at $4.50 per slice of cheese pizza with $$ for extra toppings.  I thought it was awfully good....certainly better than the chain pizza you can get around where I live. Nothing fancy at all.....just good pizza.  It will be a regular stop for me from now on.",

    "text": "*Best Pizza in Las Vegas*  I believe that good pizza is very hard to find. It's one of those foods that is often made to be a quick cheap fix, and I find myself calling the majority of the pizza I eat average. I'm rarely ever wowed by a slice of pizza and I've grown accustomed to that. When I heard about all the praise this pizzeria was getting I was a bit skeptical, but I will let you know that all that praise is very, very well deserved.  You need to go on a bit of a hunt to find the pizzeria at the Cosmo. They don't advertise it, you wont find any signs pointing you in its direction, and they don't even mention it on their website. It's located down a random hallway on the third floor nestled next to the Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar. It's a very small pizzeria with only a few stools for sitting and eating. They don't even have a menu. It's all about the pizza here.  The sauce is delicious, the toppings are delicious, and the crust is delicious. This pizza is delicious! It's made New York style with the floppy pizza that needs to be eaten taco style. The sauce has the perfect amount of flavor to accompany the toppings without being overwhelming or becoming overwhelmed. You can tell that the sauce is fresh along with the toppings. They don't have the largest selection of toppings but the ones that they do have are fresh and beyond tasty. The crust is just the right consistency and is one of those crusts that you wont mind eating the ends of the pizza. It all comes together to make the best pizza in town that I have tried so far. It is a bit pricey when compared to other pizza places but you pay for the quality.   I can't stress enough about how good this pizza is. It is one of the very few pizzas that has been able to wow me. If you want to taste how a real pizza is supposed to taste like go to the Pizzeria at the Cosmo.",

We both got the ricotta and garlic and I got an additional slice of the green bell with sausage. I love that the crust was thin but with good flavor and that they serve you your drinks in red plastic cups hahha. Very comfy.  Yeah, there are no little signs to tell you what's what, but the guys there DO speak fluent English so you can just ask! Duhhhh. And if you have such a big problem with talking to people and asking questions, you can just point at whatever catches your eye. There ARE some combos that they don't have on the counter that are on shelves underneath.  You're guaranteed a fresh slice because that stuff is just going constantly.  I love that the place is not marked/listed on any directory and that you have to travel down a long hallway off the main part of the floor to find it.  Makes it feel kinda special.  Definitely coming back to try some of their other pizzas the next time I'm in Las Vegas!",

I've been probably a dozen times since the Cosmo opened and only once has it not been the best thing ever.  Go ahead and bring a friend or two and order a whole pie because a slice only leaves you wanting more.  Plus the people watching is great, especially the nights Marquee is open and all the clubgoers  are standing in line getting pizza at 3 AM.  Also, I've seen Nelly and other celebs there before too so it's not just us little people that like the pizza hehehe",

This is, after all, Vegas. Cosmopolitan or not, you're really just expected to be drunk and high, I suppose.  We walked in, stood in line, and then asked for a combo and white cheese slice. The guy took some pieces, threw it in the oven, then pointed at the cashier.   The cashier asked what we ordered, and we explained that though we think we ordered the white, we're pretty sure he threw in the cheese. We also explained that that was fine. She seemed extremely annoyed by the explanation, asked us to figure it out. After repeating that we weren't certain, she asked the guy who threw the pizzas in, who responded 'yes'. Finally, she tried billing us for three slices, and we told her it was two.  Oh, and guess what? Want to pay with credit card? The machine will ask you for a tip with the cashier watching. AWKWARD. Seriously. A tip for what, picking up a slice and throwing it on the cheapest plate they could find? Giving me a terrible attitude? I hate places like this.  Finally, they didn't have tap water. I didn't even know that was legal in the United States - they only had bottled for $4.50 each. We decided not to, only because they didn't seem worth giving any more money to. I honestly regret leaving any tip at all considering the RUDENESS and attitude and lack of service.  Oh, and the pizza? It's minimum $5/slice, which would be okay if it were, you know, decent. But no, it's really the same as Costco pizza. That's not a complete knock - I like Costco pizza, like, really. But Costco pizza is also like $1.25 a slice and...yeah, forget this place.  GOOD: exclusive, \"secret\" feeling OKAY: food BAD: pricing, no water, terrible service",

The whole \"hidden\" thing still gives it an appealing quality. If you haven't been in yet, it's on the third level across from the pool table lounge area.   The dark corridor leading into the light of the \"hole in the wall\" pizza joint is a pretty sweet introduction to the place. Slices are pricey, but I doubt the majority of their clientele cares much about that so long as they can feed the drunken hunger.   The pizza is really good, though, and it won't take long for you to start stuffing your mouth with it after ordering. It seems small, but there's still enough space to work around the crowds when eating your slice and drinking your beer.",

The pizza that's laid out also isn't labeled so for a first timer you'd have to ask what pizza is offered. They also don't offer cups of water, only bottled so bring your own drink. After you pick your slice, they'll toss it into the oven to heat up a bit for a hot slice of pizza! Anyways onto the food...  Combo Pizza - came with pepperoni, sausage, onion. The pizza was a bit too salty for me but I'm sure it would pair well with a drink. The crust was delicious though! Very thin and crispy, though it can get tiring to chew after a bit. Throw some of that garlic powder (or chili flakes/parmesan) that's left on the counters and you're set.   Overall, the prices are very reasonable (about $5 for a fairly large slice) according to Vegas standards and the taste is A-OK.  I wouldn't wait in a huge line for this, but would stop by if it's late and I'm craving cheap pizza.",

    "text": "We've all heard the phrase...\"it's just the booze talking.\" With many of fellow Yelp reviewers, it appears to be nothing less. The dreadful experience seemed at one point like a practical joke, not only on myself, but on countless inebriated individuals in line here. How silly is it to have to wait in line 30 min or an hour to get a pizza while intoxicated? This test or as I'd call it, a vegas human experiment, focuses on dedication, foolishness and trust of social media.  Perhaps, waiting in line of completely wasted people at 4 in the morning has a certain charm for some people, like people watching or making a last minute effort to hook up after fruitless efforts to do so at a night club. Those dedicated souls who choose to do the latter here are probably going to get the most satisfaction out of this restaurant experience as they'll either exhaust their last resort to go to bed satisfied or, actually get satisfied in bed. In either case, good for them.   Now, what if one was foolish enough to come here for the food despite endless nighttime food options in Vegas. That's where this experience can turn sour quite quickly. I got the white pizza and a pepperoni pizza with Greek peppers. If it was not for the huge wait, i'd give this pizza its fair 3 stars that it deserves. Was not a fan of the crust, but the pizza was decent. It was nothing really bad, but nothing great either, I've had frozen pizzas of similar caliber before. The pizza style is classic American thin crust. However, after waiting in line this long, expectations were a bit high and I can't say I'd ever put myself through such an experience ever again for a very average pizza.  Enjoying it on the couches outside the joint also has some fun to it, you get to converse with fellow clubbers and subjects of this silly experiment. Nobody seemed to like the pizza and frustration with Yelp reviews of this place was rampant. \"How?\" Kept coming up as an inquiry, followed by \"Why?\" People were just lost. It's a vegas prank for the young and foolhardy, fall into it, and Vegas officially owned you on this night.",

    "text": "Legitimate, thin crust, foldable, New York pizza that's as good as if not better than any pizza you could find in New York.  I'm not kidding; these guys could throw down with any pizza joint in NYC, so dropping them in Las Vegas is like winning a gold in the Special Olympics & not being handicapped - there's no contest.  (Why is this in The Cosmopolitan & not New York, New York? Seems like a missed branding opportunity but I digress.)   This place is the best pizza in Las Vegas, period.  It's a tiny hole, with an old school Galaga game, a wall mounted tv, and just a few stools & counters, so you're standing up or you're taking it to go.   Buy it by the slice (around $8 each) or plan on waiting if you need a whole pie ordered because they make it from scratch when you do.  (Yes, if you're wondering, it is absolutely worth the wait.)  Sicilian style or traditional thin crust, they usually have four pies out on display at a time but they turn over new pies in minutes (they're steady busy so slices sell quickly) - there's always fresh pie in the oven about to come out if you don't like your initial available choices.   A \"must stop\" for me every time I'm in Vegas. Relatively inexpensive (not cheap; they have to run a profitable business 18 hours a day, 7 days a week so it's about $8 a slice) but certainly reasonable compared to most of the purchases you make on The Strip ($5.99 for a bottle of water, anyone?)",

My friends and I ordered a whole pizza with pepperoni since we got our money's worth by doing so instead all of just purchasing our own slice or two. Luckily, my friends all like pepperoni so it worked out. I think we paid around $35 for a whole pizza. It was pretty good! It was cheesy, the crust was not too fluffy nor too thin. Perfect amount of marinara sauce. I think it was worth the wait. Next time I come I want to try their pizza with white sauce to see what that's about.  Service was good. Cashier was friendly and all employees looked like they were keeping up with the busy crowd. FYI, they don't give water cups out, you'll have to pay around $5 for bottled water. They serve their fountain drinks in red solo cups haha. But they do free refills.",

A slice of cheese is $4, I usually get a 2 topping slice and it is $5.50, good pizza, but not that damn good. I have eaten here 3 times cause late nite when at cosmo and you are hungry, it's good eats and I make myself forget I am getting ripped off for a slice of pizza. A 2 litter bottle of soda here is $6.50. I never buy the 2 litter soda, but had to note the price to show how absurd the pricing is. A whole pizza with 3 toppings is $30.

I would have never known there was a pizzeria at the Cosmopolitan since there was no sign except a long line! I was a bit nervous waiting in such a long line for a slice I wasn't sure was going to meet my expectations of what pizza should taste like yet to my surprise the regular slice was to die for! The best NY style pizza on the west coast, LOL. The crust was thin and crisp, the sauce was savory sweet and the mozzarella was good quality. I was especially welcomed by the shaker seasonings offered i.e. salt, garlic, dried basil and oregano they had placed on the counter which is typical at a pizzeria in NYC. Lastly, the True test of a NY style pizza is the ability to fold the crust and take a delightful bite!",

    "text": "The fact that it's a secret makes the experience so much better. No, really. I'd even venture to say that the covert nature of this place gives the food more credit than it deserves, but the food itself is still actually really, really good, so it's not just hype at work here.   The pizza is delicious. They make things simple for you, giving you the choice of standard or white cheese pizza and a few toppings. I'd recommend the white cheese pizza with just one or two toppings. You will rejoice, especially if you are a thin-crust fan. It's great. It's not the best pizza ever, and it could benefit from being less greasy - I think people would be much less forgiving of the copious amounts of grease if this were a standard joint, for example - but it's great pizza, and it'll at least be one of the most memorable slices you'll have.   They also serve a few desserts; I've only had the New York Cheesecake, which is pretty good, but is definitely overshadowed by the pizza. It's a convenient, in-theme dessert, more or less.   The staff is a bit split; some of the staff are engaging and receptive, eager to help the lucky wandered-in tourists, while others are surprisingly impatient and blatantly unhappy. In the end they all make awesome pies fresh through-out the day, and it's an over-the-counter place, so it's not too much of an issue. As for the place itself, there's a lot of character in the decor - it's worth a look into the place (if you can find it), even if you're not interested in the food.   Ultimately, the place undeniably gets a bit more attention than it should because of the secretive set-up, but considering everything, it's a great food experience.",

It's sort of hidden in that there's no sign, but on the third floor, you follow your nose down the record-filled hallway between Blue Ribbin and Jaleo.  It's labeled \"Pizza\" on some hotel maps.  Like most stuff in the glitzy part of Las Vegas, it's not exactly cheap, but it is good.  It's also a really small space, and you'll probably want to take your plate back outside ... or up to your room.  The guys behind the counter told us that the crowds tend to come in waves; it'll be perfectly quiet for a while and then suddenly, bam!  Don't think you'll be blown away by it or anything, but hey - it's kind of cool.",

It was the meat combo slice that won me over, however.  What a nice combination of flavors!  I would definitely get this again.  Slices were $4 apiece which is okay I guess but don't you dare order a soda.  It comes in a plastic red cup filled with ice and they charge you $3.25 for it.  No thanks!",

The Pizza: Delicious Giant Slices of Wonderment. However, don't be fooled into thinking you don't have options. They have pizza available that's already out and on display, but things are coming out of the oven all the time and they will add extra toppings to their slices for you. Also everything tastes better with Dogfish Head IPAs. (Which is a beer if you're curious).  Not hard to find if you're looking for it, but you're not going to know it's an establishment if you don't. Tiny little place, no room for seating unless you count the top of the pristine Galaga Machine or go when one of the five seats aren't taken. This place is probably to be avoided if you hate lines or crowds and you go during peak.  I got out of there for $15 bucks: Two Giant Slices and a Dogfish Head. This is a great deal on the strip. Also as a bonus: the girl at the cash register was crazy hot. According to my friends, I of course am not in the habit of oogling random females; they are the childish barbarians.  TL;DR: Cons: No Seating. Pizza arrangement vague. Only two kinds of beer.  Pros: Lots of seating outside. Pizza is spectacular. Beer on tap includes the best of the worst (PBR) and Dogfish Head 60min (the best of the best).",

We had mushroom, vegetarian, white, cheese and something else and I thought it was a good slice of pizza but definitely not nearly as good as the reviews are saying. Maybe it's because everyone who recommended it had it while they were drunk as hell or just don't get out enough and explore with pizza but it was really not all that. They don't serve any pizza with chicken on it nor do they have ranch!!!! How disappointing. My 4 stars is because I feel bad giving them less, and $4.50 a slice is a little steep but I would pay double/triple if it was amazing which it wasn't. I'm sure if you are drunk, it is the best pizza ever, but room service at the Cosmo is WAY better.",

The verdict is that that white pizza is nothing I can rave about. The pepperocini was flavorful. Perhaps if I was super inebriated I would find great love for such pizza but sad to say I was not blown away.

Since we were mobbin' about 10 people deep with some more friends on the way, we decided to order two pizzas for the group. Unfortunately for the whole pies, options are a bit limited, so I was a bit saddened that I didn't get to go cray on toppings or white sauce.   Our group settled for simplicity. Two large pepperoni pizzas that was an additional 1 hour wait after order was taken. LONGEST HOUR EVER, but I think the wait made the pizzas so much better than it really is. It was the greasiest two slices I've had, with pools of pepperoni juice sitting in each curl.  Didn't realize til after we had finished the pizzas, but the boxes can be deconstructed into 'plates' in case you didn't ask for plates. I'm sure that's only doable if someone was sober enough to figure out the instructions. There's pictures, but it may require some muscle ahah.",

You go through this long corridor decorated with photos of old timey musicians and celebrities of the past (maybe they were album covers). Once you get to the front of the line, you can choose a slice or a whole pie of whatever's available. They list the prices but they don't list what flavors they have since it seems to keep changing. Vegetarian combo, white cheese, pepperoni and sausage, etc. the white cheese pizza is AMAZING. Slices start around $5 i think and they are big slices, so one was plenty for me.

And I'm gonna assume that my experience ordering a whole pizza fresh was better than choosing a slice out of the pies that were already made in the window.    We took the pie back to our hotel and oh my goodness! I could taste it now just thinking back to it. I have never had a white pizza before, and I am never going back. It was hot, fresh, and HUGE for like $20. It was so soft (but not fall apart soft) and so cheesy. The ricota was a nice touch.   Everything about it was perfect and the ingredients were so simple. You have to stop here when you're in Vegas.",

But there should be more things to do in the area rather then opening up new restaurants around it.   The white pizza is a must and is the staple of this place.   Price is around 5.50 per slice  Whole pizza was maybe 28 to 32 I think.   Great pizza though",

It's NY style thin crust pizza and the tomatoes added the perfect kick of tanginess to the slice! After finishing my slice I even grabbed the leftovers off my friend's plate to finish hers....heh.

The pizza crust was thin, moist, yet crispy, the cheese and sauce was also very flavorful.      However, I had them again a year later (which was week ago), and it really tasted and looked like they went a couple notches down in the ranks.   The line is annoyingly long as usual after the club and around 1:30-3am, and the customers in line were mostly obnoxious, naked wasted, tired, with a sprinkle of jerks trying to hustle you a $20 slice of pizza.   Prices:  Cheese pizza $4.75 $0.50 a topping   We ordered:  1 slice Pepperoni pizza $5.25 1 slice Sausage and pepperoncini pizza $5.75 1 Coke - Served in a standard red solo cup and no refills $4  Total damage: $15 (for 2 slices and a drink)  As much as I love thin crust pizza, theirs was all sorts of soggy and mushy this time around. Last year, it was actually crisp and held the pizza topping well. Also, they really salt bombed the crap out of it. It was soggy doughy, and salty. Not what I would like to expect from my beloved secret pizzeria.  Plus, there is never any Parmesan in those shakers on the countertops and the countertops are always greasy and filthy from previous drunk people. I never see any employees out on the floor refreshing and keeping the store front tidy.   I'm reconsidering making a mission to come here next time for my after hours pizza pick me up. Well, not unless I'm already in the area.",

After spending so much $$$ in Vegas and when you have had a lot to drink, secret pizza is the best place to come late in the night. Be prepared for a long line and sometimes finding a place to sit is hard but this is clearly the best place for late night (good and cheap) eats in Vegas.  I'm definitely coming back when I'm back in Vegas!",

    "text": "Secret Pizza definitely lives up to its name.  My boyfriend and I may have made a lap or two in circles trying to find this place, and then had to eventually ask someone for directions.  I guess if I had looked at some of the Yelp photos, I would have noticed the hallway with all of the pictures on it and wouldn't have missed it the first or second time walking by.  If you're looking for a cheap and ridiculously delicious slice of pizza...I highly recommend Secret Pizza!  After walking the strip for miles, we wanted a snack and pizza seemed to be on the mind.  After some quick Yelp searching, we decided to stop here on the way back to our hotel.  It's located on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan, down a long hallway.  We waited in quite a long line, but it went fairly quickly and they were popping pizzas out of the oven left and right.  When you choose the slice(s) you want, they pop it back into the oven if it's not fresh to warm it up and give the crust that good crispness to it.  Pizza slices average about $5.00.  I ordered the white pizza and OMG was it good.  I have an all time favorite place in my hometown of Orlando that serves up the best white pizza, and Secret Pizza may have topped it for me.  The flavor of this white pizza was out of this world amazing!  I also absolutely loved the fact that this pizza was not greasy at all and the crust had this perfect crunch to it.    Service was excellent.  I had requested a particular piece of white pizza that had the most ricotta on it, and my boyfriend did the same with his sausage and mushroom slice.  The guy behind the counter was happy to oblige.  The real bummer of this situation though, is that the dude behind us ordered the same pizzas and he grabbed ours and stole them.  After telling him he had our pizza and him rudely saying he didn't, the employee behind the counter that got our pizzas for us gave us an extra slice for the mix up.  Extremely nice of him and not necessary, but of course we took it and ate all of it!  Definitely a go-to spot in Vegas if you're looking for cheap pizza that tastes expensive!",

Typically I wouldn't just wander down unmarked hallways.. but after spotting it we walked down and found it! A pizza kitchen!  It had very limited seating and we ordered 4 slices. Pepperoni, combo, meatball and ricotta, and white. The pizza was pretty tasty and crispy! Everyone seemed to enjoy their slices. I had the white pizza and really enjoyed the creaminess of it!

The pizza crust is relatively thin which I like a lot. The white pie has a good amount of ricotta on it with it being really strong in garlic powder which I also love. It's super pungent and if you like garlic you'll love it. Each slice here is good, they're heavy handed on the cheese which weighs down the dough but you're definitely getting a hearty bite each time you dig in. Cheese slice starts at 5.25 and then add 50 cents for every extra topping.   This is good pizza on the strip. Is it close to New York slice? No, but it's still good. Pizza shouldn't cost this much but if you really want something to fill that drunkard in you then this is the place to be.",

    "text": "This rating could be anywhere between a 1 and a 4, and I will explain why, later.  \"Secret Pizza\" was all I was hearing about ever since I booked my room at the Cosmopolitan.  I am a pizza fanatic, and was excited to try this place out to see if it was \"all hype\" or \"legit\".    My wife wanted a little midnight snack, so I walked down here to get her a couple of slices.  When I arrived, there were maybe 15 people in front of me.  The line was moving along though, so it didn't take too long to get up front.  I arrived at the counter and went with 2 slices of veggie (these were the only 2 slices of veggie sitting out, and they did look a little bit old....this will come into play later).  $13.00 later, I had my slices and was on my way back to the room.  About that....if you ask them to take it \"to go\" they will put another plate on top of your slices, wrap it up, and put it in a bag for you to carry while keeping the pizza still warm.   I got back to the room and my wife started to eat the slices.  I was pretty full from earlier in the day (once again, this will come into play later), so about halfway done with her first slice, I ate the other half, and she started in on the 2nd slice.  The crust was great!  It had a nice crisp crunch, and a good chew to it.  The cheese and toppings felt kind of \"greasy\" though (once again, this will come into play later).  I ate my slice, but didn't feel too great afterwards.   Around 20 minutes later, we went to bed.  I was laying there in bed and could not fall asleep.  I was hot, my stomach was growling and I didn't feel good at all.  About an hour after I had laid down, I had to rush up and head to the bathroom.  Barfed up all of that pizza.  It tasted really sour coming up, too.  As soon as I was done puking, I felt 100 times better and went back to bed.  About the \"incident\"..................  1.  I was pretty full to begin with already, and probably shouldn't have ate that piece of pizza.  Did it put me over the top?   2.  I had smoked a pretty strong Cuban cigar about 30 minutes before I went down to get the pizza.  Was it too much nicotine that made me feel woozy? 3.  I said earlier that the slices looked like they had been sitting out for a bit, and they were the only veggie slices in the case.  When I was eating them, they felt \"greasy\".  Could these slices have been sitting out for hours? Did I choose the wrong slice?    So bringing into account those 3 things, it could have been a perfect storm of the combo of factors coming into play, or it could have just been bad pizza.  My stomach is pretty strong, but if something doesn't sit right with me, I know almost immediately (within 30 minutes or so).  The fact that it tasted horribly sour when it was coming back up, leads me to believe that the pizza was the overwhelming factor of my stomach issues.  Would I try them again?  Um...maybe?  A little too pricey for a few average size slices (I mean, it IS Vegas, but still......), and factor in the bad memory of throwing up within an hour after eating here, that puts me at a crossroad.  Try it again, get a \"good\" slice and have some of the best pizza around?  Or steer clear, save some money and avoid any possible chance of barfing?  Tough call...........",

But then again, that also depends which escalator you take, in which case, good luck.   Onto the food.. The pizza here is v good, like good. And oily but that's why it's good.   Pro tip: call and order ahead. Then brush off all the dirty stares as you walk past all the suckers waiting in line, pick up your pizza and walk past the haters.   But sometimes, they might not answer you and you wait in line, walk up and see them answering their FLIPPIN PHONES.  Mushroom, pizza and sausage on one, can't go wrong. Or pineapple but who puts pineapples on pizzas? Just kidding, I love pineapples on pizza.   Good luck finding secret pizza and enjoy when you do!",

    "text": "This place is as cute as a little retro pizza place at the end of a dark hallway. Oh wait, that's exactly what it is. This place is definitely hyped up because of the secret factor. Yeah, it's pretty cool, I guess. It's not hidden behind a secret bookcase cool, or only open with a secret password cool, but not bad.  Being completely sober at noon and purposely seeking it out, the cool factor was a bit lost. However, I have no doubt 2AM drunk me would've been mindblown if I stumbled into it by accident. On the 3rd floor of the Cosmo, beside restaurants with much brighter lights, is a smaller, darker hallway. And it's here, at the end of this hallway, that you will find not a bathroom or a back exit, but pizza!   The pizza is decent thin-crust pizza. You've got pepperoni, mushrooms, veggies, then more fancy ingredients like sausage, pepperoncini, etc. The only pizza they have \"named\" on their menu is White Pizza, which is a cheesy pizza with garlic only, I believe. Pies are baked in front of you, drinks are served in plastic cups, seating is limited. It's just your typical tiny pizza joint, except it's sort of discreet.   Now, I know this is Vegas, and cheap eats is not what it's known for, but I still find this pizza pretty expensive for what it is. My sausage slice wasn't piping hot out of the oven, so that might be its downfall. It's not bad, just not as amazing as it was built up to be. I thought it'd be cheaper than $5 a slice. I'm not a big eater, but I imagine someone would order way more than just a slice, and that adds up.   Overall, not a bad place for a quick bite. Just don't come during 4AM munchies hour because it definitely won't be worth the wait. Actually no, I can't say that. Tipsy me is a whole other beast that inhales cheese and carbs. Maybe tipsy you is like that too.  (43/100)",

Might have some difficulty finding seating but I think you'd be happy to down the pizza in one go and wouldn't worry too much about where you're eating.

IMO costco pizza even tastes better.  White pizza - Just okay. Really heavy-handed on the ricotta. There was just thick globs of it scattered everywhere.  Cheese pizza - Average. Kinda greasy  Mushroom - Average  Sausage & pepperoni - Probably the better one of them all. It actually had some flavor to it.   SERVICE SUCKED! Pretty much you walk up to the counter and the person takes your order. The lady who helped us was rude. Honestly seemed like she HATED her job. Just gave us her frowning face & asked us what we wanted. The pizzas were just laid on the counter in front of her and it didn't even really look all appealing. But since we made it all the way here, we might as well order. She only warmed up two out of our 4 slices. So our food was half warm, half cold.   AMBIANCE This place is on the 3rd floor of cosmopolitan near the Blue Ribbon Sushi place. But there are no signs mentioning the pizza place. At first, we couldn't find it and had to ask someone where it was. The lady just said to walk down the long halfway & it'll be there. The place is pretty much just a counter with some side counters and chairs to eat but that's pretty much it. Nothing memorable.  Definitely won't be back. Come on Cosmopolitan, I would have expected better dining places!",

There is no where to sit and they do not have a menu of their toppings so when I got up there to order Canadian bacon and pineapple they told me they did not have either ingredients so I got white sauce pepperoni (that's what the friend before me got). It was good, but I was very frustrated with the options and 20 oz bottle of water was $4.50!",

Cazzola's in Coral Gables, Miami, Pin Up Pizza in Las Vegas and this. It's fun just trying to find this place. You'll know what i mean when you go there. It's open   That's it.

It's hard to find a pizza place outside of NYC that is up to par to my standards.  I was happily surprised.  The pizza was DELICIOUS.  It was just what I needed after a long flight and bad airport food.  Great place but a low-key and relatively cheap bite to eat.",

Thanks to Yelper's photos, I found all the landmarks to follow and found our way through the Cosmo.  Within 15-20 minutes we were at the counter to order. Crap. They ran outta White Pizza. Another 20 minutes wait. Shoot me. So, my hubs orders the pepperoni and I get the Sicilian. Big mistake on the Sicilian. Thick, bready pizza crust with just a bit of the \"white\" pizza part - which is mozzarella and ricotta I think. However, the pepperoni was super crunchy and chewy and it totally did not say in the middle (hate that). We liked the thin crust pizza we went back for another slice of cheese. Delicious as well and piping hot. Each slice is about $5 after tax.",

    "text": "Greasy pizza after clubbing? Great idea. Greasy pizza for morning breakfast/brunch? Umm...maybe not as great. =P  Secret Pizza wasn't too hard to find. Just look for people eating pizza slices in the Cosmopolitan. =) True, there is no sign and really no storefront. It's on the third level of the Cosmopolitan, near the big chandelier. The doorway is near a pool table and some really cool/funky seating lounges.  Look for a door that leads down a long narrow hallway filled with pictures and you are there! The inside is sparse, a few stools for bar seating and some pinball machines.   There was 5 of us so we decided to order a whole pizza instead of individual slices because it seemed cheaper. A single slice is about $4.50 without toppings. We ordered a whole white pizza with 3 toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms and olives) for about $26. Plus it was freshly made!   Verdict? It tasted ok but greasy. I had to dab my napkins multiple times before I started eating it. I know the oil is a combination of the pepperoni and cheese but there was nothing unique about the overall taste of the pizza.  I appreciated the crispy thin crust but didn't find it to interesting. Although, I was thankful that the pizza didn't taste too salty and that it was freshly made. Nice and hot. The guy working behind the counter said that the white pizza is more popular than just regular cheese, and the white did have generous portions of ricotta cheese. It felt a bit heavy eating it as brunch. But I could see how this could be yummy drunk food over you come out of the club inebriated. =P  I'm not sure I'd come back. Too many delicious late night eateries in Vegas to still explore!",

Just walk straight and it's right there. All you have to really do is follow the row of people and the smell of pizza. They seem to have about four types of pizza (white, cheese, sausage, and supreme) I got the supreme and the sausage and at first I thought the cheese chunks were goat cheese or feta but I realize it was mozzarella!! It had a crunchy crust which is exactly the type of pizza I like. They also have a deep dish version which is squarish about the size of a toast. Overall, next time I am in the cosmo I'm going to try their original cheese and their deep dish version !",

I thought it was funny that there was not a sign in the Cosmopolitan telling you where to go. I had to ask an employee. Who directed me to the glass elevators. Once on the elevator get off on the 3rd floor. There are two of them so it depends which one you use as to it's proximity. I knew where it was because of the picture of the hall in previous post. Once inside there wasn't a sign telling you that it was the Secret Pizza. There is a nice size black board that has the price list.  Now to the pizza .  I ordered a whole pizza half pepperoni and half cheese. Because of the rave about the white pizza you know I had to order a slice. I was pleasantly surprised!!  The reason I say that is because I am not a big fan of ricotta cheese and thought it would be too much. I took some of it off for my first bite and then left it on for the next. It was a creamy ricotta cheese and complemented the pizza well. It does have a strong garlic taste but I cook with garlic so it wasn't too much for me. One of my daughters liked it but the other refused to even try it lol. Once our pizza was ready we ate it there. We all actually like the cheese better than the pepperoni. The crust was the right thickness with a little chew. The girls liked it so much they wanted it the next day. I will definitely come back when I am in Vegas.",

    "text": "Great pizza. Secret location. High-end hotel on the Vegas trip. Secret pizza has it all. I was told about this secret pizza joint by a friend of mine. When I was in Vegas in May we checked it out. My expectation's were blown away. I thought, could you  really have good New York style pizza in a hotel in Vegas? The answer to that is absolutely! We went at an off time in the afternoon and did not need to wait in line I had white pizza followed by a piece of pepperoni for my husband. Both were delicious and the perfect amount of sauce to cheese ratio and crunchiness of the crust. We love it so much we went back again we were in Vegas just last weekend this time we ordered a whole pie which took about 15 mins. We shared it with our family and they loved it as well. This is definitely a place we will stop every time we are in Vegas.",

If you really like pizza and you're close. If not, maybe better to grab some dinner elsewhere. The employees were very friendly and the place is nicely decorated.   I really just wanted to check in to a place called Secret. I had the white pizza with mushrooms and sausage. It was pretty good. I liked that the crust was thin.",

    "text": "Ok so let me start off by saying me and my fiance are avid pizza eaters and are from NYC. Our go to pizza places such as Joe's, NYC Pizza Suprema, and Prince St Pizza are the standard for great pizza (10/10). With that being said, I was by no means expecting a 10. I saw the NYC pizzeria set up and was hoping it was more then a gimmick and the Pizza would at least be on the low end of NY pizza (an 8). It was not. Yes it was slightly crispy but the dough was not thin and nothing like NYC dough. The sauce was flavorless, even after adding layers of garlic and oregano. And the worst part was the cheese, you could taste it was poor quality. You can tell because it begins to get clumpier as it cools off. That's not normal with good NYC pizza.   Ok cool so if that wasn't enough, the line was so insanely long and they only had one guy literally slaving making pizza pies and one guy serving everyone else slices. Now I've seen this routine before, but never with two guys. This needed at least four workers. Seriously cosmopolitan? You have a freakin ice rink but you're going to cheap out on workers and make these dudes work their tails off. Workers aside you made me wait 45 minutes for subpar pizza. Went back up to my room seriously disappointed. My score? 3.9/10  Extra star for convenience of location and late hours but next time I'll just take an Uber to a legit pizza spot off the strip. If you're completely wasted and literally can not get in an Uber but need to consume some bread and cheese, then this is your go to spot.",

I take the elevator to their flow, walk in, get a whole pizza, go back, and destroy it.  The flavors are spot on, it's not too salty, not too greasy, it's just perfect. The crust has the perfect crisp on the outside and the warm, soft inside.  Can't expect anything more from that on a pizza.  Ambiance: It's a literal hole in the wall.  On the top floor of the dining/shopping area, you'll spot a bright bluish, purplish light in a hallway next to the elevator, that's it.  It's a literal hole in the wall.  As you walk in, you'll see awesome portraits to a NY style pizza restaurant decor.  It's just awesome.",

My dad found this place awhile back because he thought it was a bathroom but people were coming out with pizza boxes.   Place is clean, fast and huge portions!  About $5 a slice.   I've been here twice and the second experience was definitely better.  The first time we got the all white with ricotta and I felt it was too much, it was good but It didn't have a wow factor. It was seriously soaked in grease, I used a TON of napkins to soak it up. My siblings and I felt a little sick.   2nd time, I brought my friend since she insisted she wanted pizza and this time I got the plain one with cheese . got it crispier and that one hit the spot! I've been looking for that NYC thin slice pizza and it was close enough.",

    "text": "WOW! I am thoroughly impressed! Dat white slice game doe!  It was $5.25 for a pretty small/medium sized slice of pizza, but let me tell you... it was a game changer. I grew up around Chicago when I was younger and currently go to school in NYC; I've had specialty pizzas. I've had cheap, expensive, just right... you name it- BUT this baby right here, this whats up.  I love how they don't have a sign or name or anything, its almost like they willing to put their reputation solely on their pizza.  This joint is basically NY style but with some pop on its dough and flavor.  First, the dough doe. The crust was perfectly crunchy and slightly soft just the way I like it. The bread overall was not to thick or too thin. There was just enough for the tastebuds.  The cheese is what you would expect from any pizza house, but the white sauce and cheese was off the hizzle. When I looked at my slice I saw that there was some garlic paste mixed in it, which is what gives the extra kick. Everyone before and after me got regular slices (presumably because of the cost?), but you are missing out if you don't get the white slice.  Workers were nice, quick, and pro. They do the baking themselves. This place is a must when you're in Vegas, especially late night. Hit up 3rd floor at the Cosmopolitan yourself.",

I was in Vegas over the weekend and had some down time to explore the strip and I thought that I would check this place out. I have heard about it from numerous people so I was like \"awwwwweee yeeeee I must check this place out\". I came here on a Sunday around 7 p.m. and there was no line, thank goodness. I wasn't too hungry so I shared a slice with my significant other. We got the mushroom because they were out of the white, and we didn't really care to wait for it to be made. A slice was about $4.50 and was a decent size. To be honest, this pizza was just alright and nothing too special. By no means am I a pizza connoisseur, but I have tasted better. Maybe the fact is that I just came from New York and had the best pizza of my life! But this place is just mediocre. I can see how it's a hit because it's located outside of the club, but most definitely just OK. Its kind of cute and touristy to find it though so I say what the heck, if you are in Vegas give it a try. Maybe it will taste better when you are severely inebriated.",

Not much seating inside, but plenty of places to plop your ass down in the lobby after a loooong night of shaking that boot-ay at Marquee (or wherever). They are open late! Pizza was impressively good. Fresh and piping hot like I like it. The crust is thin and has awesome crunch throughout. I had mushroom pepperoni which was rocking. Friends had a white cheese pizza with garlic, feta, and olive oil. It was excellent too. This beats the street vendor dogs wrapped in bacon after L.A. clubbing anyday.",

But that's not such a bad thing really, as it keeps the location mysterious and 'in the know' plus it makes it kind of fun in discovering it.  The spot is literally hidden from view and the only way I found it was when I saw some dude come out from a dark hallway with a big box of pizza.    I ordered two slices and they were delicious!  You especially have to try their White Pizza with Ricotta and Mozzarella Cheese.  It was my favorite slice.  Take a look at their slices......(<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1CK1fbR&s=b79a38400c8b928fefb51b854709ac62fa1525d9cf8dc11f2c0cca4e9f315dac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1CK1fbR</a>) they're huuge NY Style thin slices.  Very good and actually pretty filling.  The slices can range from $4.50-$6 depending the toppings which are a little pricey but considering that the slices are extra large and are very tasty, the price is pretty much justified.  It's nice to see more quality pizza joints open up on the Strip.  With this spot and La Pizza, I'm glad that I can pick up a slice for a cheap lunch or even for a late night snack.  If you have a big group, you definitely can't go wrong with ordering a pie from here.",

It's cheap, open after your Marquee nightclub adventures, and has lots of options for your liking. Yes, it's a bit difficult to find, and the line will most likely be out the door once you get there, but it is worth the wait, especially with how expensive everywhere else is!

It's a cool little spot that allows you to order and go. Not much space to sit and eat inside, but plenty of space outside of the restaurant in the lobby. The pizza was not good at all, but it's a convenient eatery that's open till 5am. Perfect for when you are leaving the club nearby, or are just starving at that time.",

Then we realized it's a \"secret\"...like the name ohh..We were looking on the directory and for signs to no avail. Checked yelp, people said it was on the 3rd floor straight from the escalator through a hallway. We were hungry and didn't feel like walking aimlessly so we just asked a worker and they told us how to get here.   Small place! But whoa so good! A bit pricey for pizza but very cheap for food in Vegas. We got the supreme and it was just amazing in my mouth. Though I might have been very hungry.   So if you're hungry, and don't feel like paying an arm and leg for food go here! If you can find it ;)",

    "text": "Ah, the late night stumbles after an inebriated strip walk or a long night of clubbing. Nothing hits the spot better in Vegas at 3 a.m. than a little pizza...who am I kidding, than a LOT of pizza.  No matter how many world class dining options Las Vegas has to offer, it always comes down to the basics, bread, sauce, cheese, and some type of wannabe Italian meat. To be honest I don't care where I get it from, just be close to either a. where i am (club, bar, etc), or b. where i am going to be (my hotel).   Secret pizza fulfills all that, and it has a certain enchante about it. Tucked away on the third floor of the cosmopolitan, your first time there is like walking into a closet and ending up in Narnia, or going through the fabled Platform 9 3/4. It's secret (heh) passageway lined with rock memorabilia leads you with the scent of melted cheese, meat grease, and drunkards. A small waiting area and kitchen, Secret Pizza boasts ready made and made-to-order pizza with the assistance of a few pinball machines to burn the time while your pie is getting fired up. The staff is friendly enough, and the pizzas are huge and greasy. There's nothing more a guy can ask for.  If you have any trouble finding it, it's no secret. My girlfriend and I literally just asked a custodian on our first visit, and he pointed us right to it. So end your night right with Secret Pizza and try not to pour half of the red pepper jar on your one slice to prove a point.   Pro-tip: There's plenty of room right outside the place to eat. Couches, sofas, pool tables...other restaurant's empty tables.",

When I mean absurd, I mean like an hour wait to get to the register and order pre-made pizza.  If you go during off hours (not lunch, dinner or after hours) you can go right up and get a slice.  This is probably the best quick pizza you can grab on the strip.  Stay and play a round of pinball. ;)",

    "text": "I will always remember Secret Pizza as the place where a prostitute stole my pizza. Well to be fair, it wasn't intentional. She was standing in line with her \"John\" right behind us and thought the slice they pushed out was hers instead of mine. She tried to offer to give it back to me, which was nice but I had to politely decline since I have no idea where her hand or mouth touching the pizza had recently been.  Judging by the crazy long line, Secret Pizza is probably the worst kept secret in Vegas. The establishment is located on the third floor and has an obscure entrance right in between 2 restaurants. It's not hard to spot because you just have to spot the crowd.  The pizzas are good but don't take my word for it. I was pretty inebriated and extremely starved when I consumed my slice. I just remembered really enjoying my new slice of veggie pizza that was not touched by any ladies of the night. The guy at the counter even gave me one free slice extra of pepperoni since I had to wait longer for mine.  If you want a whole pie, you can actually call it in and walk right up to the counter to pick it up. That should be handy if you're in a large group and are able to call in as you leave the club to head here.",

You can by this New York style pizza by the slice or whole pie. There really is no seating inside, but there are couches and chairs right outside the restaurant for people to enjoy the pizza.

My first time I ordered their Signature White Pizza (garlicky with chunks of ricotta and mozzarella cheese) and instantly became of fan. This pizza was delicious! I really enjoy how this pizza seems to always be perfectly done, including the crust. It is never too burnt, or too doughy. It's just perfect. Although I find their pizza to be amazing, don't expect too much when it comes to the design, this place is barebones inside.   I love this place so much, that this is actually one of the first places I took my wife for some late night grub, and she too became a fan immediately. Now I've created a monster.  This place is Secret (Not so Secret), there aren't any signs outside or anything indicating that there is a business there. It is inside a long hallway, although if you go late night, you'll likely find a long line leading all the way outside of this hallway. It is located across from STK. You may sit and eat inside, although stools are limited and usually occupied, but you may also sit and enjoy your pie outside where there are more seating options, and hey, you may even be up for a game of billiard after you're done with your pizza.  We come here often after leaving our restaurant, and I love how they are open until 5am. So if you're having a late night pizza craving, this place is the place to go.",

All I wanted to know was what floor it was on and what to be on the look out for. We went up the escalator and the hallway was literally right there in front of us. It took two seconds to spot. Knowing it was in the third floor and down a hallway.   We ordered three slices of pepperoni with peppers and a beer. It came out to around 24$ kind of expensive but it's the cosmo in Vegas, you kind of expect that pricing. There are no tables so we took our pizza back to our hotel, Aria, to eat. It was still hot when we got back and the pizza was super delicious! A lot of reviewers said they thought their pizza was too salty, but I didn't think so. However I am a fan of salty foods.   We came around 8 on a Sunday night and there was no line. It's a shame when people come during peak hours after clubs and complain about drunk people with long lines. What did you expect? The crowd doesn't affect the taste of the pizza, just the bitterness that is you.   Overall I would return. If I wasn't so lazy, I would be walking myself over and to get another slice now. Maybe tomorrow night. ;)",

Thanks to fellow yelper, Rod U, I was finally became aware of the secret location of this pizza mecca that everyone seemed to know of except me (at least until recently).  I think the \"secret\" is more the location versus the actual pizza itself.  You'll find this small pizza parlor/station at the end of a very nondescript hallway in the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  After walking past pictures and portraits of various people, you will soon reach the secret pizza.  Order by the slice or the whole pizza.  Go big or go small, it's your choice.  For me personally, I chose a slice of pepperoni and that was it.  Was it the best pizza I've had?  Was it worth the all the wait to finally eat this slice of pizza from the mysterious and difficult-to-find pizza palor?  Well, let's just say when you're hungry any slice of pizza will satisfy your appetite.    NOTE:  Slice of pepperoni was $5.25.  Absence of seating.  Stand and eat at the available counter space or go find some tables and eclectic chairs within the Cosmo.  SERVICE:  Quick, courteous, and efficient.  BOTTOM LINE:  Secret no more!  I'll be back!",

Secret pizza hits the spot, being the foodie that I am it's totally worth the 4 hour drive down to Vegas ( YES, IT'S THAT AWESOME ) and order a box of pie from here. I recommend pepperoni ( can't go wrong with that right? ) and the white pizza, the pepperoni slices are SOOOOOOO good, its unlike what I tasted before, I feel like I haven't had True pepperoni until that day I had it here at Secret Pizza. And the white pie... Oh my god. I've never had white pie before and I'm glad I lost my white pie virginity here LOL, sprinkle on some red pepper flakes and your slice is solid.  This was all i ate on a 3 day trip to Vegas while staying at the Cosmo, every day.. I just wished they delivered :(  The second time I came here wasn't as flavor packed as the first but I still love it anyway :)  As far as ordering goes, I would definitely call in and order ahead of time if you're planning on getting a fresh whole box of pizza. YUM. If not they have a selection of pizzas by the slice you can choose from and they reheat it in their oven for a couple of minutes for you so it's nice and hot for ya. You can even watch them make pizza I front of your own eyes if you get bored waiting, I find it pretty entertaining. The guys that work here are nice and I'm glad that they are, it just makes the pizza here taste even better.",

I'm not going into detail though, because I don't want the lines to get even longer!! ;) which takes me to, not so secret because of the long line you have to wait in most of the time... It's a grab and go kind of place. Buy, by the premade slice or wait 25 minutes for a full custom pizza. No tables and chairs to sit at, only standing shelves to eat at if you're going to eat there. A couple pinball/video games take even more space away from the standing area. Great pizza! Great crust and dough. I had a supreme and a Sicilian slice...both Excellent! I don't eat a lot of pizza, though I love it. Pizza can leave my stomach bloated and intestines crazy the next day due to all the grease and oil. This place didn't do that to me. Despite having full flavor you'd and expect from a good pizza, and it didn't seem to lack on the cheese and grease, it also didn't leave me the next morning regretting my bad eating choices. Lol.",

The guy behind me had a slice of pizza that looked absolutely divine.  The guy who took our order was genuinely friendly and helpful and was able to get me a refill on my diet coke under fire. There is very limited room to sit or even stand and eat yo' pizza, a lot of folks took it down the hall into the lobby, a clue to those looking for this place.  It's pretty easy to find, right next to Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar and Grill and the P3Studio.  I actually liked that they took the pizza and reheated it in the oven, didn't take too long, but I can see if there was a long line.",

I found out about this place from a bellhop at a competing hotel - that's how I knew this place was gonna be good and not unreasonably priced! He told me that this place is so popular that the Aria made its own pizza place to compete, but it just can't compare. The place is cleverly hidden (almost like a speakeasy) and much more low key than the other the Vegas venues. I ordered the ricotta with sundried tomatoes and my boyfriend got the sausage and peppercini. The toppings are robust and the dough is amazing - full and crispy! It was just delicious from the tip to the crust. Moreover, the guy behind the counter is super friendly, and served our slices within minutes. He also didn't let me pay when I was trying to pay for our meal - that's how you could tell he's a real gentleman! He also told us that this place is only known through word of mouth, and it really does live up to its reputation!  There are also a couple of pinball machines, which make a nice touch to being just a pizzeria. Simple, inexpensive, friendly, fast, and delicious - they've ticked all my boxes! Also, beware - we've been told that the line goes out the door during the after-hours bar/club rush.",

It is freshly made with hand tossed dough. with a excellent crispy crust.  GET: the White Pizza(Ricotta & Cheese) this one usually sells out, based on how much Ricotta Cheese they have available.   PRICE:  is comparable to your mall pizza slices(around $5 a slice), I would order a whole pie since the price is $24 which gives you 10 slices. Slices are pretty decently big. But, your going to be eating more than one slice.  OPEN LATE: Perfect spot after clubbing or late night grubbing since its open til 4am. But be prepared for a Long Line in the evening.   \"Secret Pizza\" is no longer a secret anymore\"",

It's stuck between another restaurant and an Elevator that doesn't seem to work sometimes. There's a pool table right in front so if you spot the pool table you know you are close.   The pizzas are pretty damn good. You have to go with the White Pie, they sometimes hide it under the table only because they have a lot of pizzas out already on display. But if you ask if they have some they usually do. And of not, it doesn't hurt to wait. I usually add a lot of mushrooms and sausages to mine. The thin crust is good as well as the thick crust. Honestly you can't go wrong with either or.   If you are looking to get down with some pizza than come to this place. Just make sure you don't gamble all your money away or spend too much money on drinks the night before (or maybe even the night of haha).",

This is my go-to spot after drinking and dancing all night on the strip. I love the not-so-secret-now location and telling my out of towner friends all about it. I really love any pizza with the meatballs and I always have them add some pepperoncini's (sp) to it.  The line can be hit or miss, but I've never waited less than 10-15 minutes every time I go there. It's just a fact of life that you're gonna have to wait a while so don't come here expecting prompt service. At least they have record covers of Italian musicians for you to stare at if you don't feel like staring at the fellow patrons in line. I was reminded that Madonna is Italian and learned that Chuck Mangione is a real person and not just a recurring character on King of the Hill. I tell you hhhwhat.",

Luckily we went during the day at around 2pm...so we missed the lunch rush and didn't have to contend with the after club drunkos.  At first I had no idea where I was going because as you walk down the corridor all you see are pinball machines---so at first I thought I was going to a game room, but then just as I turn the corner---I am greeted by a happy go lucky pizza dude.  I tried the white pizza and hubby had the meat lovers---they were both very good and surprising not super greasy.  We both finished our slices---completely.  The white pizza has 3 or 4 different cheeses including ricotta, mozzarella, and some other cheeses that elude me right now--but drizzled on top if some sort of garlic oil.  Yum!  The meat lovers had sausage and pepperoni.  I didn't want to wash it down with any lively libations or pop, so just asked for water---which was surprising right next to the register at a cold water cooler.  The pizza dude was very nice and offered us up cups of ice.  I will definitely stop by here again on my next visit.  Quick, yummy, and fun to know we found the secret pizza in the fancy schmancy hotel.",

Which was good for me because I found a few hidden gems during our most recent trip including the Secret Kitchen.  I think this place was dubbed \"secret\" by some poor drunken soul who got lost finding it, or lost finding his way back to the elevators. It's located past the large conference rooms on the 3rd floor, and you will know you're almost there because, out of nowhere, you will start to see people heading back to the elevators.   It took us about 10-15 minutes to order and I was grateful that this $5 slice did not disappoint. Thin but crunchy crust with super satisfying toppings (I'm not sure if it was due to late night hunger or too much to drink or both, but I inhaled my slice within minutes). Love the sausage, salami and pepperoni. I also liked that they offered oregano/garlic powder/parmesan/chili flakes at the counter, which reminded me of the pizza places in NYC.   We ate here twice during our Vegas stay and our experience was consistently the same: long line, good pizza, barefoot women.",

But in the end you find out its not really a \"secret\" due to the long freakishly slow line and the pizzas don't taste like something I would treasure.   I've had it three times already in three different occasions because we were staying at the Cosmo and it was late and we were hungry and I was not about to be on hold for 40 mins to order room service (I don't want to get into that cause that deserves whole another review all on its own). On all three occasions I was hungry and pretty inebriated and not once did I think it was best pizza I've ever tasted in my life. Cause everything taste pretty good when your drunk right? Not really... I just ate it and thought to myself \"Okay, I'm hungry, and this will do\".   Just for the hell of it I will give it an extra star instead of one for being there for me when I needed to satisfy my late night hunger.

    "text": "Secret Pizza is one of those establishments that really needs no introduction. At first glance, it is quiet, discrete, and no frills. Yet when you dig deeper and get to know its personality you find something so much more. I am a firm believer that every establishment has room for improvement. However, when I think about it long and hard Secret Pizza really epitomizes all I would want or come to expect of a pizza establishment. I almost dare say that it was the best pizza I have ever had.   Nestled in the Cosmopolitan, you would think it would be flashy and glitzy. Rather, it defies that convention and it sits in a nondescript hallway that you would easily bypass. Not that I am saying you should go down every service hallway at the Cosmopolitan, I'm just saying taking the Star Trek like elevator to the third floor above the Chandelier Bar and walk down the nondescript hallway till you find Secret Pizza. Note, the hallway has photos on it to give you some direction.  Once there, you will be greeted by the beautiful smell of pizza. While slices are available in the showcase, full pizza's are available as well. I'd probably call ahead if that is the case just to avoid having to wait. Since we didn't know any better, we settled on a simple pepperoni pizza. However as we waited to order, the guy working the counter clearly could tell we wanted a white pizza as well and mentioned that we could have a half pepperoni/half white pizza and it came out to be one of the best decisions we made in Vegas. The pepperoni was really good, but the white pizza was much better. Both offered really great flavors that melded in a perfect harmony that would make angels sing. The pepperoni has just the right amount of salt and spice to counteract the fat and sweetness of the mozzarella. While at the same time the white pizza was an amazingly good blend of ricotta and mozzarella cheese. Both on a thin crust that was easy to work with, yet not being very greasy at all.   Service was good with the staff clearly not only knowing their menu but also clearly having skill when it comes to making their pies. They keep the line moving at a carefully timed rate as if it were a well-made machine.  Definitely a great place to grab a bite, while they may not have seating grab a glass of wine or beer with the pie and head on out to the main areas. It is definitely one bite you do not want to miss.",

That did not stop us for sure as Anthony and Justin stood in line to order a full pie! 35 min wait? Psh...no problem. We were starving but we waited anyway. We thought it was worth THAT much. I think due to high demand they ended up making  a hand full of white pizzas and then offered them by the slice eventually.   Oh..the rich cheesy goodness! Loaded with ricotta cheese. Extra greasy and flimsy. Just the way I like it. Sure enough, NY style I folded that bad boy in half and inhaled it in one breath.

    "text": "- The Skinny:  Food Quality: 5 Stars -  Great pizza! Get the Meatball, Pepperoni, or their most popular slice, \"The White\".    Meatball - Large slices of Meatball and globs of ricotta cheese.  Pepperoni - Large slices of real pepperoni, makes pizza chains seem like they are using intimidation pepperoni?     \"The White\" - its all cheese, fresh ricotta, and garlic sauce. There is no pizza sauce on that one but trust me, its good! My wife loves Chicago Deep Dish Pizza and dislikes NY style, but this was the best pizza she ever had.   Pricing: 5 Stars - $5 a slice, if you're hungry, get 2 slices as they are large, but thin (NY style). It costs more than other pizza joints but factor in that it's located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel.   Service: 3 Stars - Nothing incredible but it is just a pizza counter and they are just mashing out pizzas. The workers were friendly and helped me choose some good slices. There is a little bit of a wait but its worth it!  Atmosphere: 5 Stars - Has a real NY pizza place feel. A couple pinball machines and some TV's playing sports. Hallway is decorated with vintage vinyl records and adds some class but once its opens up to the pizza counter, its straight NY style!   Place is really a secret, I had to ask 3 different hotel employees to find it. Its a hallway that is missed in a blink. Its to the left of glass elevator and across from the \"game lounge\" (pool table, scrabble coffee tables, wooden dice seats).   Comfort: 3 Stars - It's a narrow hallway any little counter space to eat, but you will be there just to buy and run so no worries there.   Location: 3 Stars trying to find it but as far as theme goes (being a secret, 5 Stars) - Place is really a secret, I had to ask 3 different hotel employees to find it. Its a hallway that is missed in a blink. Its to the left of glass elevator and across from the \"game lounge\" (pool table, scrabble coffee tables, wooden dice seats). With a name like \"Secret Pizza\", mission accomplished!   - The Fat:   My in-laws were in town and of course we needed to take them out to the Vegas Strip. There was 25 of us so no need for a sit down dinner, especially with many small children. I found \"Secret Pizza\" on Yelp and opt'ed to go there as we made our way to the Bellagio fountain show.   It was tricky to find, had to use my GPS and ask 3 hotel employees to get there but it really is a hidden treat. You will have to wait a little bit, I was there on a Sat night around 11pm and we waited about 20-30 mins?  The pizza is delicious! hot, fresh, and kills any other pizza I had, only rivaled by Grimaldi's Pizza in NY under the Brooklyn bridge. I would go out of my way to go here again. If you are on the strip and want fast, inexpensive, but quality food, go to Secret Pizza!!!",

The quality is good, the variety is great, the lines........depending on when you arrive, may be a little while until you get your hands on a slice.  Question is, WHY is this pizza good?  What's the hype?  As put to me by a friend, it's either the sauce or the crust that defines the pizza.  Truth is, it is very difficult to have one without the other.  In this case, Secret Pizza succeeds in having a light but crispy crust paired with a winning white sauce (if you get the white sauce) and the balance of cheese that doesn't impair the stomach from already having an awesome time in Vegas!  In other words, this is the \"pizza fix\" on the strip.  Can't go wrong with that.",

Beyond those elements, the pizza is delicious & it's probably the cheapest grub on the Strip. I always get pizza by the slice (about $5) and usually opt for the cheese with added ricotta. Its thin crust with a good combination of crunchy to chewy. I usually don't order anything to drink here, but they have beer ($7-8) and wine ($6). If you're hungry and in the area, you can't go wrong with this place. Open late.",

I didn't want any of those fools to cramp my style and get it on the good stuff (I sound like a great friend don't I?). The truth is they're not True Yelpers, so they are not worthy of a secret pizza. Place is tiny. Located down a dark hall with no signage. Just ask one of the Cosmo staff members and they will point it out. I went with a white pizza and a beer. There is no glitz or glamour here. Just a plain old pizza shop; kinda reminds me of a pizza shop you would find in NYC or Chi-town. Seating is limited but it doesn't matter because you will be in and out in no time. Friendly staff and great food. If pizza is not your thing there are tons of fancy shmancy places down the hall. Most importantly, keep this place a secret. Happy eating!",

The girl working the register was super sweet & helpful. The pizza is definitely good for Vegas standards, I got the White. The crust is thin and crispy, and the pizza itself is not too oily, just right. There's nowhere to sit so you'll be lucky to grab some counter space. I think the only downside in my opinion is the price. $5.50 for a slice. I mean I know it's Vegas but dang, it isn't AMAZING in my opinion to spend all that much on it. I think trying this place once just for the one time experience is enough for me. Oh and if your thirsty for some water, they won't give you any lol. That sucked...",

It should be re-named \"Hard-To-Find Pizza.\" Go to the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan and look for the drunk, hungry people. You'll be able to smell this place before you see it.  This is one of my favorite post-clubbing places to eat on the Strip and the best pizza, hands down. The NY style manages to pull off the combo of a crispy crust and loads of wonderfully cheesy toppings with quality ingredients. I like the White Pizza because I love cheese, and with the piles of ricotta, it doesn't disappoint.   As delicious and hangover-preventing as it may be, the lines can be frustrating, especially if there is a wait and you're hungry. They do have video games, or you can take a nap on the chairs outside (and people do), but the best time to go is not midnight-3AM when the club-goers are released, if you can help it.   Slices are around $5 each, pricey but worth it in my opinion.",

    "text": "Secret Pizza is just what Cosmopolitan is about -- Mysterious, a bit of deviant. I mean, where else will you find a pizza joint with no markings or signs of any nature. No Name Pizza Kitchen? Check. This place isn't even in the resort directory -- not on the Cosmopolitan website, nothing! How I came across this place, I have no clue, but I sure am glad I stumbled upon this place. After a journey around the Cosmopolitan, up and down elevators, back tracking and such, the mission was complete. At first, I couldn't find it and thought, \"maybe it doesn't exist\". Walking through the hallways, I smelled the scent of freshly baked pizza dough. Thinking it was an oasis of some sort, I convinced myself I wasn't going crazy. Literally following the scent of that yeasty goodness, I was finally at the small little hallway entrance that led to Secret Pizza AKA NNPK (No Name Pizza Kitchen).  The Inside was interesting. The hall way was filled with framed pictured, side by side. A relatively small place, the inside had a few pinball machines, flat screens, white walls, and hungry diners. Not a hint of Cosmopolitan's design cues bleed into the restaurant -- You are no longer at the Cosmopolitan, not even Vegas for that matter. You are totally transformed into this small hole in the wall pizza joint in New York City.  With each slice near 5 bucks, we opted for a whole pizza. We ordered it half white and half meatball with pepperoni. The white pizza was my favorite which had mozzarella, ricotta, and garlic. The garlic was fragrant and savory and the mozzarella and ricotta gave it a smooth texture. It didn' have any meat, but I preferred the white pizza over the meatball and pepperoni. The meatball and pepperoni was tasty, but it tasted to normal for me. It was a bit salty, but still very delicious. The crust on both pizzas were very impressive. Though not cooked in a wood burning oven, it was as close to a Neopolitan style pizza as can be. The slices were large and thin, and could hold its own compared to any pizza from New York City.  If there were to be a secret pizza joint with no names, no marque of any kind, Cosmopolitan would be the place to have it. But then again, with word of mouth, and the scent across the hallways, people won't have a hard time finding it. I think looking for the place is half the fun of it all. The excitement of trying the pizza, getting your pizza in unmarked white pizza boxes, its all part of the dining experience. I was amazed by their pie, probably some of the best I ever had. All you have to do is go find it. You may be wondering, exactly where is this place exactly? There isn't a sign, but you will find a \"Marquee\". You can always message me for the exact location, or just do some Google searching. I, for one would like to it a secret, and leave that adventure in your hands.",

It's a typical hole-in-the-wall pizza-by-the-slice joint. Minimal seating, loud music, arcade games, people folding slices of pizza and stuffing it unceremoniously into their mouths. There's nothing really special about it, yet there is -- because it's hidden inside a swanky casino. It has a magical quality in that it doesn't feel like you're in Vegas at all. It's noisy & crowded -- but it's the quietest place on the strip. Worth checking out, for sure.   Three stars because the pizza is just okay.",

The fanciest pizza I've ever tasted was anything of the ordinary from the countless pizza parlours of Italy. To me, margherita pizzas were a real treat, gently wrapped in parchment paper at 2 a slice, and an additional 1,50 for sea salted chips.   However, there is something different about Secret Pizza. You can find this little gem on the third floor between the corners at the Cosmopolitan. Purchased by the slice or by whole, the open face kitchen allows you to choose your slice of heaven from white pizzas to red pizzas. When I first tasted Secret Pizza my friends purchased whole pies of everything pizza and a pepperoni pizza, and even at 2am, they were outstanding & melty, just the way I like my cheesy pies. On my last trip here I tried the white ricotta + sausage pizza which is now my only preference. Full of flavour with just the right strength of spice & herbs, this pizza was a winner on my taste buds.   Keep in mind that the line to Secret Pizza is absurd; I think the best option is to telephone in your whole pie only. Although I am not a pizza aficionado like I used to be when I was under 10 years old, I love Secret Pizza so much that I would purchase a whole pie for myself, even if my companion didn't like Pizza Secret! x",

You see a small entrance way and the hall takes you to the pizza place. It's really small. You can call in your order or order there. You can order by the slice or a whole pie. The pizza slices are pretty big.   I was doing meatless Friday the day I tried it out. I ended up just getting a cheese pizza, but it was super good cheese pizza!  I wish I tried the mushrooms.   The pizza boxes are nifty. If you have leftovers (like half a pie), you can tear off the top part of the box and fold the bottom of the box to save some room :)  I'll be back!",

It's literally a small pizza take-out counter at the end of a hallway with no signage whatsoever.  The New York-style pizza was pretty good, but nothing mind-blowing.  Yet in a city where everything is overdone and getting something as simple as a cheap, fast, tasty lunch is hard to find then this place is great.  There is hardly any seating and just a small counter to stand at.  They had a couple freshly baked options as we walked up, including a white pizza that my wife opted for and a special with hot peppers that looked good to me.",

    "text": "For any drunk club-goer in the wee hours of the night, this place is a dream come True. I went to Vegas for work recently and arrived to the hotel at midnight after many delays and hadn't eaten dinner. I was able to run downstairs and get a piece of pizza in 15 minutes. This place is tucked away on the third floor across from Marquee - look for a long hallway with vintage record covers.  I got a piece of the white pizza ($5) - obviously, no tomato sauce, and lots of cheese (almost too much cheese). There was a ton of mozzarella cheese, ricotta cheese, and a garlic oil. There was a bit of a pool of garlicky oil on the top of my pizza, and I had to pick around some of the mozzarella cheese. I loved the NY crust - it was not soggy and was both crisp and chewy. If you're at the club and have found \"someone special\", you may want to avoid this white pizza since you'll have garlic breath for the rest of the night. The white pizza was great, and I was sober and hungry, so I'm sure if you're inebriated, it will taste even more delicious.   I came back the next day after going out and drinking a lot and got the Supreme pizza. It was good, but not as good as the White pizza.  Great for a late night slice of pizza after drinking, or when you need a quick bite to eat. They have a cooler of free water & cups so you can hydrate after a long night out.",

I usually just go plain cheese when in NYC as I love the purity of it, but he talked me into trying some with home made sausage and I wasn't disappointed.  I went back the next afternoon with a clear head and tried plain cheese (awesome) and mushroom (very good).   It is sort of hard to find, it is on the 2rd floor near the east tower.

It's not listed anywhere on their directory. You just gotta believe... and you'll find it. On the 3rd floor. There's a long hallway with a bunch of pictures that lead to this unexpected treasure.  There was a small line when me and my cousins went at around midnight, but looks can be deceiving. It took 10 minutes to reach the front, and 10 minutes is a long time when you're a wee bit tipsy. Come later than midnight, and you're going to have to wait.  I decided to opt for a slice of their white pie. So cheesy and garlicky! It had a ton of cheese including ricotta. And each bite had a nice hint of garlic. Their pizza is definitely on the same level as something you'd find in New York.  Prices are a bit on the higher side, but honestly, it's worth it. They also offer to bake off a whole pie for you if you're willing to wait 10-15 minutes.  No, there's no place to sit, but there's places to stand and eat your pizza. It adds to the experience, I swear.  I can't wait to grab another slice of their white pie when I'm back in town.",

Add to that $3.25 for a plastic party cup of fountain soda? Seriously?! I understand your establishment is in a casino, but soda prices are getting incredibly ridiculous nowadays!  I will give them 2 stars for a nice, hidden location, with amazing scents emanating down the vinyl album lined hallway. The staff was friendly enough, if not a little slow in the service side.",

    "text": "You know, this place is good, but....if one were to believe the reviews here, it would seem as though glorious slices of heaven were handed down from Mount Olympus by radiant angels making water from wine with flour, yeast and pepperoni as someone hands their money over the counter.  It's good....and it was fun to check in here...but it's not the BEST PIZZA EVER!!!  That said, if you're walking on the strip towards the city center and feeling a hankering for some very tasty pie, walk into this casino and look for that tube-style elevator near the back quarter of the casino floor.  It will, once one completes the journey to the 4th floor, deposit you mere feet from the unmarked entrance of this really nifty find.  I wonder, given the success the whole lets-make-it-a-treasure-hunt sort of thing, if other casinos will start to hide random businesses in the nooks of their properties?",

There is no signage stating what it is and when you look down the hallway, all you can see is a game machine.  When you walk down the hallway, there are all of these cool, vintage record covers.  They serve huge slices of pizza for about $5 a slice and drinks in red solo cups.  It's cheaper to get a whole pizza, and the 1 slice doesn't necessarily fill you up, so you might as well get a whole pie.  This is definitely worth a stop.",

It's cheap when compared to most meals in Vegas, considering I spent $15 for a breakfast sandwich and coffee in the same hotel. I also at at the actual restaurant/wine bar DOCG in the Cosmo and I wish I would've gone to Secret Pizza for a 3rd time instead of branching out.   It's very New York style in atmosphere as well as pizza. You wait down a narrow hallway, you get to the counter, pick your pizza slice and any additions, it goes in the oven for a few, you pay and then if there's room you eat there but likely you'll have to leave to eat. We were staying at the Cosmo so we just took it to our room. The pizza was great, some of the best I've had in a while. I had the white pizza, and pepperoni with added pepperoncinis.",

So when my husband and I had tickets to a concert at the Cosmopolitan at a time of the month when my pocketbook always feels a bit light, I knew we should bypass our beloved Jaleo and try Secret Pizza instead.  And am I glad I did! We both had the white pizza and truly, we gorged ourselves on it.  And then my husband went back for more -- although the Stone beer I had made me a bit fuzzy whether he did that right then or after the concert.  It definitely became another go-to for cheap great eats when we're out on the Strip.  Thanks to the pics on Yelp, the place is easy to find if you know what you're looking for...but lives up to the great Vegas building design where if you're not looking it kind of blends right in.    Although it may not be so secret, it's still one of the best fast cheap options out there, and maybe the only thing cheap at the Cosmopolitan!",

I already knew about it I believe from a Food Network episode that I legitimately DVRed prior to going to Vegas so I would know where all the hot spots were! I knew it was on the 3rd floor but did not know much else so when I got on the floor which was approximately 12:30am on a Friday night (completely packed due to Marquee..) I was afraid I would not find it. I was lucky that as soon as I departed the elevator I saw an unmarked hallway past a restaurant and had a feeling that \"that was it!\" and I was right! Anyways, enough about finding the marvel of the pizza place....I had somewhat high expectations but whatever expectations I had were blown out of the water. The pizza is hands down the best pizza I've had in my life. Crust is perfect, not too thick thin or anything just perfect. Cheese is rich and obviously a higher quality and my boyfriend kept marveling over how perfect the pepperoni and how he had never had pepperoni like it before. I bring him up because this kid seriously just gets pepperoni from the deli so you know he's telling the truth. I will miss these pizza as sadly I am not a Vegas resident...but next trip to Vegas I will for sure hit this up.",

As the name suggests, this place isn't really promoted or advertised anywhere in the Cosmo, or in Las Vegas in general. There is not menu, or even a sign in the hotel that says that it exists.   It's actually called the pizzeria according to the cosmo, but its found pretty much on the 3rd flood right by the elevator. Look for a corridor decorated with golden album all over the walls. When you come in there is no menu printed anywhere, instead you just look at the pizzas they have and pick one.  The costs is usually around $5-6 a slice depending on what you get, which I think is pretty price for quick slice of pizza. The food itself is decent, the white pizza is excellent as I am a fan of ricotta, but there are quite a few average pies as well (pepperoni is no different than most other places).   I think the real attraction is the fact that it is pretty much the only place in the Cosmo where you can get food for less than $10 a person. And it does seem kind of 'cool' to go to place that is a secret... But I think that secret is getting out especially when you see a long line drunk kids from Marquee stretching out of the hall way.",

    "text": "You can keep your secret to yourself.  Overrated.  Overpriced.  Open late.    So Secret Pizza hides on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan serving NY style pizza for $4.50 for a slice of cheese pizza, and everyone seems to rave about it.  I guess I'm the exception.  Not that it tastes bad, its decent.  But if I didn't work downstairs I'd probably never go.  Its convenient to anyone in the Cosmo that doesn't want to spend serious cash on an elegant dinner at the other restaurants.  But for two slices of pizza and a cup of soda you will spend over $15.  Which is cheap in comparison to the restaurants, but expensive considering you can buy a large pizza and a 2-liter for the same price at most pizza joints.  Yes, yes, I know its inside a strip casino - it doesn't make me feel any better about being robbed.    OK its NY style, but it tastes nothing like pizza from the north east.  The slices are thin (which is NY style) and sloppy (often falling apart as you pick it up) and sloooow to come out.  The choice is often limited to one or two types because they never have enough pizza ready. The line tends to get long, and even when its short the service is way slower than it has to be.  Be prepared to stand around in this closet sized restaurant (if you can call it that).  There are a few stools at a counter with no leg room if you want to sit, otherwise bring it out into the Cosmo and find a seat somewhere in a lounge.    Maybe I'm spoiled because i grew up in NJ.  I've had great pizza in Jersey, Philly, and New York.  And honestly in Las Vegas I have had nothing but horrible horrible pizza.  So I guess I could say at least Secret Pizza is some of the best of the worst pizza.  But I always leave feeling like I've been had.    The one good thing it has going is the place often stays open until about 4:30am.  You will likely have to ask someone where its at, its down a hallway with no signs.      Bottom line, I've been to this place over a dozen times because of my job, so this review is no fluke, its consistant.  This is average pizza (above average for Vegas), but unless you've lived in the South your whole life (or Nevada), I doubt you'll find it especially delicious or special.",

ANYWAY, we came here twice while in Vegas and it did not disappoint. It was actually much better than some of the expensive places we had. Slices are about 5$ and are quite large. We had a slice of cheese, pepperoni, and white w/ ricotta. The pepperoni was great, they were spicy and flavorful. The cheese was not so great. The white was really good, very garlicky. This place is a great find on the strip! I'd go back for sure.",

The $5 pepperoni slice sure hit the spot after a night of Bacardi 151, Everclear and Maker's Mark.  The ingredients were simple but something about them made this place stand above most other pizza places I've been to. Gooey cheese, giant pepperoni slices, robust tomato sauce and crunchy hand-tossed crust. The crust was crunchy on the outside and just slightly chewy on the inside. Definitely a treat, whether you're going out drinking, coming back from a night of boozing, or just taking a short break.  If it wasn't so greasy, I would have gave it 5 stars. Had to use a napkin to soak up some of the oil.",

    "text": "If I came here 8 months ago when this place really was a secret and all the Hipsters were rocking the joint, I would've given it 5 stars for every possible reason without trying a slice of pizza.  But since it's not 8 months ago, I happen to find myself craving pizza while on the Strip, so I figured this would be a perfect time to get me some not so secret pizza.  So my buddy and I go to Secret Pizza and there is no line, maybe 2 people in there.  So i guess all the hype for the place died.  Then I saw the prices, $5 for a fucking pepperoni slice?  If that slice of pepperoni pizza could actually fuck, then I'd pay $5 for it.  Not even all the concessions stands at carnivals would charge that much for a slice of pizza, and even then those slices were very good and worth it.  My buddy told me he paid around $3 or less for his slices when he went there, and I was sure that was the price 8 months ago.  Either way I asked for a pepperoni slice and the server looked pretty out of it/didn't give a shit.  I know they just give you a slice and there isn't much customer service involved, but throw a fricken smile and be glad that i am paying you 10X the amount of what that pizza slice cost.  I'd be jumping for joy if I had that gig.  The pizza itself; Very good.  Digged the crust and the sauce, great texture, no complaints about the quality.  However, it's not $5/slice good, but very good nonetheless.  But it wasn't very filling either.    I dunno, I felt like the charm it once had that made me want to try it out for the longest time is gone.  This is not a \"little gem\", \"neat place\" or \"hidden secret\", or not anymore.  It's just \"hidden\".  #cynical",

My friends and I waited in line, and they managed to order their pizzas. I was behind them, and the guy taking orders/making pizza looked me over and went on to the next person. I figured I'd have my order taken at the cashier, but no dice. When I got to the cashier, she asked me what I'd ordered, and when I told her nothing yet, she looked to the pizza guy. Dude had the gall to say I'd cut in line? Maybe he missed the fact that a friend of mine ahead of me handed me a water bottle as they were paying for their order. Not sure what his deal was, but my business is better spent elsewhere. Took them about an hour to make the pizzas, too- way too long for anyone impatiently waiting to get their grub on. I'm sure they'll make their money off of other customers coming back from clubs drunk.  PS The pizza's mediocre, but insobriety makes everything better, doesn't it? Not worth the buck.",

On the left coast I would only rate this place and Mulberry of Beverly Hills as being the 2 pest places to score a NYC style slice.   Often imitated but never duplicated... A thin, doughy crust, with a little crispness, easy on the cheese, and a sweet basil tomato sauce.   A real NY pizza expert will start with a slice of cheese. This one made the grade. I was also a fan of the sausage and banana pepper.  The ambiance - Full of drunken Californians mostly. There will be some women walking barefoot and carrying their shoes. Possibly a couple natives from the land of vegas. Feels much more sterile than a NYC place, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.",

We have tried many different flavors including pepperoni, cheese, combo, pepperoni mushroom. They are all amazing. Combo is my favorite but i will take whatever they have ready. It feels like being in a secret society of pizza. We smile at fellow pizza eaters and watch as newbies struggle to find it.

You just look at the topping selection and create your pizza pie, or order by the slice from the selection laid out.  We ordered a whole pizza (half white with an amazing garlic spread and the other half  was pepperoni, mushroom, onion, and bell peppers).  We waited a while for it because there seemed to be only 1 worker at the time who was assisting other patrons at the same time he was building our pizza.

Dubbed the \"the secret pizza place\" it is located on the 3rd floor, situated next to the elevator, in a brown hallway.   We waited 30 minutes for a slice of pizza.  Why the long wait?  People were walking up and ordering whole pies and they couldn't keep up with the demand.  Hence the -1 star.  They should be constantly making pizzas for the customers wanting just a slice.  When we finally got up to the front, they only had a pepperoni & mushroom pizza.  There are two things in life that my husband hates: mustard and mushrooms.  But since they said it would be at least another 10 minutes before a cheese or pepperoni pizza came out, we each grabbed a $4 slice and walked out the door.  We found a seat near the pool table and each took a bite.  DELISH!  Crust has a good chew, good flavor in the sauce and the cheese is fresh.  Pepperoni and mushrooms were tasty too. My husband even ate the whole thing! The slice was definitely a good size and I was full after just one.  It was so good that I have been thinking about it all day today.  This will be my go-to place in The Cosmopolitan for a cheap dinner! :)",

    "text": "Pure genius! Okay, so maybe I am a little excitable, but even if they were serving DiGiorno down this album-decked hallway, you'd have to give the brilliant masterminds credit for hiding a New York style pizza joint on a floor of fine dining in a world class hotel. People love surprises. People love pizza. People love being in on the secret. I love the secret pizza joint!  The set-up is brilliant. Down a long mysterious hall lined with amusing album covers (example Saturday Nite Fiedler), you arrive in a New York City pizza joint. You feel as if you are really in New York standing in front of a pizza counter, peering over the edge to decide which slice was made for you! I felt as if I had just been out clubbing all night on Manhattan and needed to grab a slice before tunneling my way back to Jersey City!   And, the best part, the pizza is goooood. (Yes, that is good with extra o's to demonstrate that it is in fact better than good.) At least one of the pizza makers here is straight from Italy, and he used to work at an off the Strip pizza place where he earned the nickname Picasso for his beautiful, delicious pies. As soon as we heard he was here, we knew we had to go and partake in one of his masterpieces.   I am no pizza expert, but this thin, crispy NY style crust even had the slight burn to it that I have heard pizza connossieurs adore. The crust had a nice, simple flavor, and I thought the sauce was tasty especially with a heavy dusting of crushed red pepper. As for the toppings, this may be the one place where they disappoint. I had a plain cheese. A glance of their buckets of toppings did not inspire me to load up on anything. However, the construction of the pizzas is darn near perfect- not too much sauce, not too much cheese. Each bite is the ideal balance of sauce, crust, cheese, and I think that is a key element for successful pie. Then again, I am not pizza expert, but I am a value expert. $3-ish a slice is a steal when you're on the Strip.   I can see the future, and the future holds long lines for a taste of the secret pizza, so get there now before the secret ain't so secret anymore.",

    "text": "If a restaurant is good, then the word spreads like wildfire. The secret pizzeria in Cosmopolitan is no exception. In two days, I have overheard about this place from a complete stranger while waiting in line at another restaurant, read the stellar reviews on Yelp, and today, heard about it on a morning radio show. I knew I had to try this place ASAP.  Lucky for me, I work on the Strip so my co-workers and I went during lunch. Good thing I did my research or we would've never found the place. It was like a treasure hunt... third floor, next to Blue Ribbon Sushi, down a secret hallway lined with album covers... and there it was!  Once I saw the white pizza come out fresh from the oven, I knew I wanted a slice of it before even hearing what's on it. A slice of the white pizza and a soda cost $7. Not too shabby at all.  The pizza was heavenly. The crust had the right amount of crispiness, garlic and cheesiness. I'm usually not a crust eater but I devoured every last bite. I seriously considered buying a whole box but didn't want to share with the whole office.  The real test was when I brought back a slice of cheese pizza to my co-worker, who is a New Yorker, and is very critical about restaurants that claim to have \"authentic New York pizza.\" He said the pizza was \"pretty damn good.\"   I'm pretty sure you'll find me here at least once a week for lunch. Maybe dinner too!",

I was excited to see a line full of hipster youth and it definitely has a New York feel to it.  I didn't mind waiting in line and checking out the old school album covers on the walls along with the pinball machines and 80's music blaring. The pizza itself was actually really tasty. It was greasy as hell but didn't taste or feel too greasy. At around $3 a slice and red cups for the PBR/IPA this place really took me back to drunken college nights in NYC.   The Cosmopolitan has won my heart as a drunken strip hangout. The fact that this pizza place is hidden just makes it that much more quirky and interesting. Can't wait to head back!",

There was not a long line (just about 5 people in front) when I went (around 7:30PM). A friend of mine recommends me the place cause she knows what Vegas is all about! It took a long time to make the whole pizza pie for 3 people to share though (35 mins), but it was definitely worth the wait. Waiting was not so hard, it's good to walk around and do something else around (gamble). ;)   The pepperoni and meatball are delicious toppings, and the center of the pizza was magnificent. That first bite has the perfect ratio of tomato sauce and cheese, then as you eat towards the crust more cheese! The dough was so good that I ate everything! I normally don't eat the crust but it was really that good to me.   I'm not a huge critic on pizza like I don't really pay so close of attention to how they make it, but I have eaten pizza around NYC like Grimaldi's and Lombardi's. I have a bigger heart for this place. :)",

I came here this past weekend after another shitty night at Marquee dealing with douchey, good for nothing bouncers. Coming to this Secret Pizza joint was the highlight of my night. I got a slice of the combination pizza and as I took my first bite, I regretted only ordering one slice. The pizza was extremely crispy from beginning to end and the meat was quality!   Not only did I get to eat AMAZING pizza, but I met Jason, a bachelor celebrating his last days of freedom, who then ended up being my fake fiance for a couple of minutes. I also met another guy who dared me to do a cartwheel, but instead I tricked him into doing cartwheel down the hall for everyone's amusement. All of this made the waiting in line part a billion times more bearable, so the next time you're here make friends with the people in line to kill the time.   Don't hesitate to come here..the first thought after leaving Marquee should be to venture to this awesome spot.",

Fcuk the pizza.  Was the pizza really that good?  I don't remember.  My buddy liked it. I guess I did too.  Not as much as the Reyka tonics I was guzzling down at a frantic pace earlier. Evidently I waxed two slices, made it back to the room, and gracefully blacked out.   I woke up in the middle of the night with a shivering case of mud butt.  That means two things:    1. It was greasy 2. It was good  I do faintly recall burping up pepperoncinis while on the throne.  I love those things.

First of all, this place should change their $ to $$ because for 3 slices of pizza, 1 soda and 1 beer, it was $30!!! Insane, right? I wouldn't mind paying if the quality was there. But unfortunately, it wasn't.   I love the concept of it being a secret and the fun is finding it. But once we found it, I was expecting to be rewarded with some great pizza. Pizza was salty and a little brunt. The ingredients felt short in quality and quantity. I hate to say this but I would have been more satisfied and happy having Costco pizza.   Secret pizza, you need to start serving better pizzas with better ingredients or just stay a secret but this is one secret no one wants to know about.   Happy eating everyone :)",

I went to Secret Pizza around 11:30am and the restaurant was filled. I ordered a slice of pepperoni and white pizza. The pizza was delicious. The flavor of both slices of pizza made my taste buds smile. The pizza came out hot. The service was pretty fast. The employees were friendly. The restaurant isn't very big and seating is very limited. Secret Pizza has a nice social atmosphere. Secret Pizza is not a secret anymore.

Ok, well I start of telling my friends if they heard of Secret Pizza at Cosmo and then he would then explain the rest.... even though he said he would let me say it.... my bf is weird.   Anyways, the white pizza was really good. The crust was thin and crispy, the topping was oozing with oil but man oh man was it good. I was actually shocked that 15 mins sitting in a bag, the crust and the bottom of the pizza still held its crispiness and crunch. There is hints of garlic and awesome cheesy goodness. I will definitely come back if I stay out late.... just really iffy on paying $5 for one slice of pizza.",

It's so crunchy the crust fell apart in my hand and along the counter area you could see people left the crust (the best part if made right!). There was hardly any flavor to the slices because the cheese and sauce was extremely sparse! I basically ate pizza dough and it is way overpriced at $5.00 for a cheese slice and goes up from there....that's called rip off. The line was very long but reading the reviews this is the norm. There is very limited counter seating. This place is getting positive reviews from everyone coming out of the clubs and other late night partiers (or influenced by other reviewers) so if you are sober you might want to skip this one because your taste buds won't be fooled and you'll save a small fortune.",

The pizza is not the best pizza you will ever eat in your life, however it is delicious and fills a need. It is reasonably priced (especially considering what you will pay for the rest of your meals while in Vegas). Hot pizza at 3am - yes, please.",

My boyfriend liked the sausage and peppers one. I recommend if your planning to buy more than two slices just get a whole pizza it's a better deal deal. The pizza slices can get pretty pizza but that's normal for the strip.  Best to going during lunch or after. It wasn't too packed and we got our pizzas right away. The inside is small there isn't too many seats.",

So I have to give them kudos for location and service and how its open late night after a night of partying it up at Marquee.   I got two slices one plain cheese and the other garlic and cheese.  The slices were not that good for NY style pizza. The crusts were burnt and on top of that oil was dripping off both slices. I would only go back if I really had a craving for late night pizza and couldn't find another place open. I really wanted to like the pizza but I have to be honest to my fellow yelpers.",

The pizza is not cheap.  It probably averages $4.50 a slice and the average person will probably eat 2 slices.  Its made fresh to order and its delicious.  I've never had this sober but I'd guess I'd probably go elsewhere to avoid the line and the premium mark up for pizza.  I got 2 pizzas, with 3 toppings each and the total came to $64.  $32 a pizza would definitely be considered a premium.  It was a good amount for my group of 7 as we barely finished everything.  Its more along the new york style, think crust pizza.  There is limited seating inside but there is some outside seating in the middle of the 3rd floor.  If theres only 10 people in front of you in line, you've beaten the crowd!!",

Upon arrival there was  only one slice of cheese pizza on the pizza line.I asked when he was gonna have another cheese pie on the line because I needed 2 slices of cheese.He opens the oven door to a empty oven and saids no more! So I repeat myself and ask \"when he was gonna make another cheese pie\" he saids u missed it like 5 minutes ago...So I then say okay well I would like 2 slices of cheese pizza.He then reaches underneath the pizza line pulls out a whole pie of cheese and gives us 2 slices and puts it back under there.Not sure if they try to discourage the cheese pizza choice trying to rake in a extra .50 cent per topping per slice.... But for 2 vegetarians cheese pizza is the best and most requested pizza pie!!! SMH",

We ordered the pepperoni sausage and a meatball with ricotta cheese. The pepperoni sausage was more flavorful than the meat ball. Again, the pizza was ok and nothing special.

It's also the first pizza I've had in Vegas, but little Caesars is better (and cheaper) than this crap.  We ordered a half cheese, half pepperoni pie. Cooked made to order (one star for that) but it could've spent some more time in the oven.   Cheese was cheesy, but pepperoni could've been crisper, as well as the crust. I flipped a slice over and saw the bottom of the pizza was plain. In NY we enjoy those burn marks on the bottom. Sauce wasn't anything special either.   The other star I gave was for the decor- pinball machines, tile walls, a mural of what might be a NY pizzeria, and the dollar bills on the wall representing all the fools they've fooled thinking this was real pizza.",

If you order a pizza with toppings like veggies they pour it on like mushrooms are so plentiful you can smell it and it seems they are so fresh. You don't see grease floating on top of the cheese either.",

    "text": "For a group of 4 people (or 2 really hungry people), ordering a whole pie was the way to go. For 2 toppings of pepperoni and mushroom, the total came out to $24 for 8 slices. It's a relative bargain compared to ordering by the slice, which can be up to $5 depending on how many toppings you want.   Everything was just as good as before, except for the soggy middle. Since a whole pizza was made fresh to order, all the cheese and grease gravitated towards the center. Plus all the cheese and toppings just slid right off the mushy crust. It probably could've used a few more minutes in the oven to develop a better crust in the middle. But it was still damn GOOD, and burned the top roof of my mouth way too many times.  If you order per slice, they'll throw it back in the oven to reheat, so you won't have the soggy-crust-in-the-middle problem. So it all depends on your preference. Personally, I like thin and crispy crust versus the soggy version. I've been here well over 6+ times, and it seems like the prices just keep creeping up. \"Secret Pizza\" isn't really so secret anymore.",

This looks like it would be the perfect place for a group to go and order a whole pizza to be made just for them.

It's located in the Cosmopolitan on the 3rd floor, but unless you ask someone that works there, you may have difficulty finding it, since there are no signs indicating what it is, or where it is. The entrance is just a long hallway that looks like it may lead to a restroom, but surprise - at the end of the hallway is a small pizza kitchen. Seating can be sparse, so be prepared to eat while standing.  I don't know if it's my timing or what, but many times, when I visit an establishment, there are only a handful of people around. 10 minutes later, the place gets seemingly packed. That was the case here too.   Got a slice of both the White Pizza, and the Sausage Pepperoni. I can't write too much about the White Pizza, because it's irresistable and now I feel compelled to drive all the way to the strip from Summerlin, just for a slice. It's that good! It's funny observing some of the people in line - the closer they get to the cash register, the more they seem like they are drooling, Lol! As I was leaving, I noticed one of the pizza cooks pulling a deep-dish white pizza out of the oven. Oh... I want that!!! must... delay... gratification...  :P~~",

That guy should be rewarded like a BOSS because having the pizza literally 30 seconds away is about as clutch as you can possibly get.  Again, this is why the Cosmo rules.  Yeah, it's expensive, but what in Vegas isn't expensive?  Usually $5 a slice, and that's before you get into multiple topping slices.  Honestly though, at least the pizza is pretty damn good for $5.  Crust is has good complexion. the cheese is delicious, and the toppings are always quality.  They always make sure to stick it in the oven before they give it over to you, so it is piping hot when you get it.  Ain't no other way to eat pizza than piping hot.  My only wish is that they had chicken pesto pizza, but it's ok...I'll let you slide because your italian sausage/pepperoni and meatball pizzas are bomb as hell.  Staff is great, very understanding and accommodating considering all the drunk, hungry people that pass by here between 2 to 5 AM.  And not just that, but this place gets pretty entertaining because DRUNK PPL LOL.  Last time I went and waited in line, some girl was going off about how she wanted to beat the crap out of another girl, but didn't out of respect for the bachelorette party.  New night, new stories.

Hand tossed, NY style pizza in the desert, that's what you're getting. I love a real thin crust, like so: I go for the \"White Pizza.\" Garlicky good.   There's so many pie parlors to choose from so I'd say definitely come here to try the 'zas, or just come for the gorgeously nostalgic hallway and the black and white checkered floor. Seriously go after clubbing at Marquee. I'd say it's necessary then.",

You will wait for a long time, you most likely won't have anywhere to sit but you had head back out to the lobby area on the floor or just eat it standing up. It's salty, greasy and cheesy- everything you need for a late night drunken meal. Between that and your walk back to your hotel, you might sober up enough to go to sleep and wake without a hangover. All in all good pizza!",

    "text": "I finally found this establishment during my most recent Las Vegas trip. My cousin has been suggesting Secret Pizza forever. It's a little tricky to find. There's no signage to the establishment, and there's no indication on the floor directory near the escalators.  Go to the third floor and look for an open hallway filled with a bunch of pictures.  Anyways, pizza by the slice is about $5 each. It's a good size portion. My two slices and a soda came out to about $15.50. The pizza was definitely tasty. I especially liked the white pizza. If you have never tried white pizza, definitely give this one a try. As for the pepperoni slice, that was okay. Overall, the food was good, but not mind-blowingly good in my opinion.  If you like New York style pizza or need a late night establishment that won't burn a hole in your wallet, consider checking this place out.  4 stars out of 5 for good pizza at a great price, especially considering other food establishments at the Cosmo, or any other hotel for that matter, cost an arm and a leg.",

Thankfully there wasn't too long of a wait around 4:30 PM but I can definitely see how this place would get crowded in the wee hours of the morning (it's open until 5 AM!) Although the pizza hit the spot, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to get it again. It was a little too greasy. I preferred the white slice to the pepperoni and mushroom slice, but neither was memorable. The white did have a nice garlic kick.

It's not becoming a secret anymore, but it's still tucked away in a hall inside the Cosmopolitan. You'll find it if you ask around. If you're planning on ordering a full pizza, I'd recommend calling ahead before you wait in line. But yes, get the white slice pizza.",

How clever LOL. We had to ask one of the employees outside where it was.   The line was pretty long when we got there, almost to the door. It took us about 15-20 minutes to order, and then they told us to come back in 30 minutes to pick up our pizza.   Our group ordered a whole pizza with mushrooms, pepperoni, and sausage. The slices were huge, but a little salty to my liking. I did enjoy how they bake everything fresh.   Overall, the pizza was delicious, however it was a little pricey and the wait was a little long.",

    "text": "Since this is in Vegas and right next to Marquee dayclub/nightclub, most of the patrons are probably at least a little intoxicated when eating here. That being said, it really is excellent pizza! You'll find it down an unmarked hallway on the third floor of The Cosmopolitan, but if it's a busy time it won't be difficult to spot the line. It's meant to be taken to go, but there is a lounge area in The Cosmopolitan outside the restaurant you can have a seat in.  They are well known for their white pizza. This pizza foregoes the standard red sauce for a garlic white sauce, and then tops it with white cheeses. I prefer a variation on this and usually ask them to make me a ricotta and sausage pizza. Their pepperoni pizza is also fantastic and my go-to order if I'm not in the mood for garlic. I order it with mushrooms.  You can wait in line and order by the slice, but the line can take awhile. I prefer to call in my order for an entire pie or two. It ends up being much cheaper this way than ordering the equivalent number of slices, you can customize what you get, and you don't have to wait in line when you pick it up. It usually takes 30-40 minutes for it to be ready when calling in.  This pizza can be in such high demand that I've had someone offer me $100 for my pie when taking it to go. Wasn't enough for me to give up my pizza at the time, but perhaps an idea for a new business model? I debated between 4 and 5 stars for this review since it does somewhat fall under drunk food. However, it's one of the best priced meals in Vegas and I always make a point of stopping here at least once per Vegas trip, so I opted for 5 stars.",

Hidden on the third floor of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, you won't know this little eatery is there unless you follow the record-lined hallway. After passing album covers from Frank Sinatra, Elvis and other music notables on the wall, you're spilled into a tiny, standing room only place.    At the walk-up counter, fresh pizza like pepperoni, cheese and veggie is offered by the slice. If you want a whole pizza to take to your room, it usually takes about 15 minutes. But don't worry, the brightly-colored pinball machine is always a fun way to pass the time if you're waiting. There is a high-top counter to stand at while eating a slice and a few mismatched stools. In addition to soft drinks, a few select beers are available. For seasonings, Secret Pizza keeps it simple: Parmesan cheese, cherry pepper and oregano in old-fashioned spice shakers.",

Secret Pizza is located on the third floor of Cosmo down an unmarked hall.  I had a slice of pepperoni and though I enjoyed the thin crust, I thought the pizza lacked a lot of flavor. It was very greasy and quite honestly, I would prob rather have Little Caesar's pizza lol.   This place is definitely overrated, but I'm sure it's a great place when you're drunk and they're one of the few places next to the club when it's open late.",

Also it helps if you are already blitzed drunk because 90% of the people in line are sloppy drunk.  The white pizza is amazing! It is buttery, garlicky and creamy all at the same time. Their crust is crispy, crunchy and slightly soft. I would recommend it if you are already in the area. Avoid it late at night, the drunks aren't worth the hassle. It's also a little pricey, $5-6 per slice. For being new York pizza the slices are pretty small.",

It's thin New York style so if it's your first time, I recommend getting the WHITE pizza, which has great hints of garlic and ricotta. The pricing is definitely a little steep and I don't recommend ordering a customized pizza unless you're willing to wait 30+ min. However, the pizza will never disappoint and the staff is always super friendly . There's very little room so you can eat it outside or take it back to your hotel. Overall, not the best pizza but definitely above average!",

After enjoying dancing the night away at the marquee, I sat outside the club to relieve my poor little feet when I caught a whiff of the most delicious scent an oven can throw at you at 1:30am: PIZZA. I asked this girl who had a slice where she got the pizza and she offered to show me. The place had no signs. Just a line of people. Semi discreet as I could not tell what they were waiting for at the end of the line. When I asked the guy who worked there, he said it was about 15-20 minutes. Where you wait is this hallway decorated with vinyl CD covers from the 70s-80s and the scent of pizza just hits your drunk soul with desire.   I ended up getting two slices and paid maybe 12 dollars. If you want a whole pie you can pay 28 and there's even an option to make your own. I didn't really know what flavors they had. You may have to ask but you can't go wrong with pepperoni and sausage so that's what I did!",

Their dough seems different than what the competitors use and the cheese has a familiar NY flavor. It may be nostalgia, but I am convinced Secret Pizza has a Secret! It may be that the ingredients are imported, or a secret ingredient is used (salt?)... what ever it is, I love it! The shop is located in Cosmopolitan, you can pass by it a dozen of times and not even know it's there. The blatant \"secret\" of the shop is the location. You will see an inconspicuous entrance, without a door, next to Blue Ribbon, you will walk down the hallway and voila! That's where the great pizza hides.  The space isn't big, you basically order and go. Though there are a couple of stools, in case you wanted to grub and move on. Most people come in for a slice and eat it elsewhere in the hotel.  The times I've eaten here, both sober and clever ;), I've always enjoyed it.  Fun fact, they also have draft beer.  Enjoy!",

When 4am drunk clubbers anywhere within 100 feet of the front door are staggering around everywhere slurping down soggy, greasy slices with pepperoni ... you don't need Kojak or Colombo to deduce there's a pizzeria about.  I guess it was a clever marketing gimmick, though, to not signage the joint, so that everyone staying in The Cosmo will eventually say to everyone else staying in The Cosmo \"hey there's this secret pizza place on the third floor ...\"  I was only willing to stand in line one time here. Because the line takes forever to move. And I wasn't willing to cough up chump change at EggSlut or The Henry ... just for a bite to get me by until the sun rose over Sunrise Mountain.  That long wait, however, was this joint's saving grace as far as I am concerned. Being a lover of all that is mid-Century Modern, I savored, not the scent of the forthcoming oregano, but the quality of the collection of Mid-Century LP vinyl covers that line the walls ... and even the ceiling ... of the long hallway that leads into this pizzeria, holding its queue. As actual vinyl albums pretty worthless, but as mid-Century album art, this nostalgic collection is quite valuable indeed.   I own a small collection of Vegas-themed album art ... and I've since parted with most of my mid-Century Modern album art ... but all of it pales in comparison to what is on display here. Whomever curated these walls sure knew his/her stuff. Kudos well earned. Ironically, most of the clubbers standing in line here will be too sloshed to even take much notice of it.  The pizza was well above-average. Cheesy. Gooey. Flip-floppy, fold the point back, New York style. Greasy goodness. I mean it's The Cosmo, so no surprise regarding quality.   My recommendation is to make a visit at opening on a slow weeknight. So you can get in and get your pizza quick ... then nosh on it as you leisurely stroll out the \"in\" hallway, gandering this amazing historical collection of musical accomplishment.",

(Not really a secret, )We ordered a whole pie, sausage and pepperoni.  Took it to the room like rats that had just raided a dumpster.  Sooooo worth it. The crust was tender and flavorful.  Generously topped and hit the spot after a 5hr flight. Of course our eyes were bigger than our stomachs.  The fridge gratefully held our leftovers.

    "text": "Hey Secret Pizza, when your customer's order is 30 minutes late, could you at least try and and make it not taste like you opened up a can of Costco tomato sauce, spilled the contents of a salt shaker into it, then spread the mess over a cardboard box you found in the back of the kitchen? Oh also, those weirdly tiny-sliced and ultra salty pieces of mystery meat are kinda creepy. Did I eat cat? I kinda hope it's cat, at least that would be one interesting thing about this order. Maybe that's why you call yourself SECRET Pizza?  The bolognese sauce on the orecchiette was probably the blandest, least bolognese-y bolognese I've ever had. And I'm the proud owner of a massive one-pack, courtesy of lots of Italian food. I probably ate more bolognese dishes than most people eat any food, period. How you managed to make bolognese so incredibly bad is another mystery. You guys really work hard to earn the \"secret\"- part. I should stand up and applaud this feat, really.   But thanks for adding the packets of sawdust, errrr...\"Parmesan\" cheese. They could have worked to mask the awful pizza topping, or bring at least some type of flavor to what you pass off as bolognese. Too bad the contents probably expired sometime around the Nixon administration.  Secret Pizza should honor its name and actually stay a secret - to anyone.",

It was a bit of a hike to track it down for as the name suggests, there are no signs to point you in the direction of this place. When we did find it, we learned the secret was out as we had to wait a bit to get our slices.  Overall this is NY style pizza where you pick out your slice and they heat it up and serve it to you. There are literally thousands of these places in the US. I don't know what they do special here, but this was delicious. Definately recommend checking out this place when you are on the strip!",

Sauce to cheese to toppings ratio was spot on. I feel it was a tiny bit overpriced, especially the drinks. We paid $8 for a 2 liter of soda and the bottled water was $4.50 a bottle. This is mostly why I scored it 4 stars because I feel the pricing was a little high. Then again it is inside the Cosmopolitan in Vegas so I knew what to expect. I would go here again for sure.",

Maybe it's because I've been hyping this up in my head since I knew I was returning to Vegas, but I remembered it being a little better the first time. This time I chose a slide of mushroom pizza and a slice of veggie pizza. Despite not living up to my initial expectations it was still amazing. Portions are nice and I stayed satisfied from those 2 slices the rest of the day. If you're staying in the Cosmopolitan, visiting Marquee or happen to be nearby I would recommend Secret Pizza if you're craving pizza, but I would not go out of the way for it.",

The first few visits, the pizza was too soft and greasy. To my pleasant surprise, my last visit here a week ago, the pizza was crispy and DELICIOUS! If this becomes a consistent thing, I might just bump them up from 3 to 4 stars :)  PS The pizza is kind of ok the saltier side so beware!!!",

Like staying at that one casino off the strip called NEW YORK New York... uhhh.. for you tourist don't be fooled not New York Pizza. I found this gem that actually is New York style pizza but you will have do your home work like I did. It is located on the third floor of the cosmopolitan off the strip. This is the only place I will eat Pizza from now on when in VEGAS. This place is hidden that's why it's called SECRET PIZZA.. look for the hallway with pictures on the wall and walk through until you reach Heaven. Don't waste your money eating pizza anywhere else except this place .... True NEW YORK style pizza.. take it from me. I don't have a TV show yet on real New York  style Pizza but waiting for my shot so I can give my reviews. This place should get a ten star********** TEN STAR.",

Once you enter the hallway that's basically it. But it is still fun to experience since there are no signs advertising where it is.   I came here with my friends as we explored the strip and this was our first stop. We got pepperoni pizza and I got the white pizza. I'm not quite too sure everything that was on the white pizza, but I'm guessing feta was a topping, which was amazing. Big fan of white pizza!   Both were good--I'm a little biased though since I'm a fan of most people. The dough was chewy but had that nice crunch to it and the crust wasn't hard like a cracker. It wasn't drenched in sauce, which I prefer because it allows me to taste the cheese and the toppings more. Overall I was pretty satisfied.   The line we were in was long and it doesn't really becoming a secret place when it's 20 people deep and it's leading out to the lounge, but it moved quick for us. Not much seating inside but we snagged some counter space and munched down. Very happy I got to visit this and check it off my LV bucket list!",

I'm definitely coming back again.",

The directions were confusing so we called and  the friendly staff told us they were in The Cosmopolitan on the 3rd floor.  Upon reaching the 3rd floor no signs could be found at all. A nice dressed hotel attendant recognized we were lost and flagged us over. We said Pizza? He directed us to a small hallway and said \"it's a secret\" with a smile,  The line was long filled with lots of young dressed to Party.  We were tired  and debating if we wanted to wait the 30 min. The young couple in front of us said we should as it was there 2nd time back and it was worth it. So glad we stayed. The white pizza was amazing and the crust perfect. We came back again today and are taking a whole pie home. The price is reasonable, the  staff is super friendly at all hours of the day and the quality is superb! Thank you Yelp",

The same night I arrived, my girlfriend and I decided to take a stroll in the Cosmopolitan hotel and went up to the third floor to search for the hallway my friend tipped me about.  Just as my friend mentioned, the smell of pizza overpowered my senses and everything looked delicious.  I decided to go with a slice of cheese and pepperoni while my girlfriend went with the white pizza with mushrooms.  Upon the first couple bites, the pizza was absolutely delicious.  The thing that really put me over was the crust.  The crust was perfectly crunchy and tasty.  I will have to say that this place takes my favorite small pizza spot back in Houston simply because of the crust.  Although it is a couple dollars more than the slices back home, I will consider this pretty cheap knowing that i would spend over $80 for my girlfriend and I had we ate in one of the restaurants next door.  For this, I will have to say this is the best pizza I have had, at least from a smaller/not-too-fancy pizzeria.  We went back to eat here the next night too! Go get you some!",

You can have a made to order slice of pizza... so whatever you're craving for in the middle of the night... it's yours.

I read about it in a local magazine and was anxious to give it a try.   Even though I read where it was I still had a hard time finding it. It is on the 3rd floor near several other restaurants. Literally look for a dimly lit hallway with old record albums lining the wall. If you see a pinball machine straight ahead you've found it!   I lived near Chicago for 11 years so it's hard for me to appreciate anything other than Chicago style pizza (deep dish an/or thin crust with sweeter sauce). That said, this pizza was pretty darn good for thin crust and fair priced at $3 a slice for cheese and an extra 50 cents for each additional topping. I tried a cheese slice and a slice of pepperoni. Both were good but I must admit that I did use a napkin to soak up some excess grease from the pepperoni slice.   The option to just stop in for a slice of pizza is great as long as you can locate it. I heard the beer price is reasonable but I forgot to look into it. I would recommend just running into an ABC store on your way over for a huge beverage selection.   Will definitely remember this place for a quick, easy snack or meal.",

    "text": "My fiance heard about this place when he was at a bachelor party about a year ago. He ate there twice and couldn't stop talking about it. Every once in a while, I love a good pizza. I usually won't indulge in the calories unless I know, for sure that it's gotten good reviews. Always a fan of anything hidden or secret, as long as it provides an adventure to get there - count me in. It was about 6:30 PM on a weekday. My fiance and I were on a work trip. After a long day at work, we grew increasingly hungry and were definitely in the mood to stuff our faces with good pizza. Luckily, because we got there early, we did not wait in line for long. We were able to get helped right away. My fiance got a slice of pepperoni and a slice  of sausage and bell peppers, I got a slice of the supreme-which included sausage, pepperoni, and veggies. They had charged us for three slices, a salad, and water. They served us four slices. I brought it back to the guy and he said \"no worries, enjoy!\" So, we did! The pizza was delicious and each one of them was well worth the calories. The salad we ordered was much better than a salad you would assume would come from a pizza place. Prices were OK. Altogether, I think we spent $30. Not bad at all. Especially, for Las Vegas. It's very casual, there was a lot of people there that you could tell came straight from the pool. After a long day of drinking and being in the sun I'm sure they were definitely ready for pizza. There is limited seating, we were lucky enough to get two seats. Overall, the place is very small. There's a few video games, and a TV that was playing the World Series. Otherwise, a lot of people get their slices to go! You enter down a hallway. There is no advertisement on the outside, it's almost impossible to miss if you don't know about it. It is right around the restaurants Beauty and Essex and Blue Ribbon. Manja, Manja!",

The wait was about 15 minutes which wasn't that bad considering there was a lot of entertainment (aka drunk people interacting with each other ). Between me and the boyfie we ordered 4 different slices. We ordered the white pizza, the mushroom pizza, the veggie pizza, and I think the margherita. My least favorite was the white pizza and the FAVORITE was the mushroom pizza. I loveeeee the thin breading and perfectly cooked crust here. There's a few couches outside of this place, but other than that you're better off taking your pizza back to your hotel. I  am extremely impatient when it comes to food and hanger, so of course we ate them all right then and there :) Pretty sure the drunchies made the pizza taste that much better, but I'd definitely give this place a try when I'm sober too. Me loves pizza!  It was a mission to find this place because there's absolutely no signs. Just navigate towards Milk or Momofuku and you'll be set.",

My man and I were visiting his family over Christmas and he took me here one of the days we got to be \"tourists\". I didn't even know this place existed but I am so glad he showed me. This is the best pizza I have ever had in my life, and I LOVE pizza. I actually got a slice of the white pie and one of the salads. The pizza, oh man. I don't even think I can find the right words to really describe to someone just how amazing it is. It is something you need to try for yourself and you will NOT be disappointed. I promise. The salad that they provided me with was also, nothing short of AMAZING. It just was a little salad in a plastic container, but it was so good! They had all the yummy toppings and the dressing was yummy as well. I love this place. I can't wait to be back in Vegas just so I can go back here and get my fix. My guy got the pepperoni and he loved it. He had also been here before and couldn't even really explain to me how good it was just that \"it's the best pizza you'll ever have in your life\".....and he was right! Can't wait to be back here. I love that this place has no name and truly lives up to the hype of being \"secret pizza\". It is so great and makes it that much more fun to get a slice of pie here.",

This place had great reviews and pizza sounded like great food after running. We checked it out and it held up to the expectations that people wrote about. The staff were extremely friendly, we only waited maybe 5 minutes from the time we got in line until the time we paid (some reviews say it does get super busy later in the evening but we got there at a decent time), and the pizza was really, really good! My husband and I only got the cheese pizza but it was perfect for us - great cheese to sauce ratio (the sauce was delicious), great crust (good crunch throughout the whole pizza), and not a lot of grease. After eating here all my husband wanted everyday thereafter was pizza for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It really is a secret place. There are no signs but it is located on the third floor down a hallway across from the pool tables. The hallway is filled with pictures on the wall.",

    "text": "On our recent trip to Vegas we had the chance to sample the Pizzeria's slices twice  Once as a quick mid afternoon bite. As we walked up they were pulling a fresh meatball and pepperoni pie out of the oven. It was excellent.   The second time was just after Marquee on a late Friday night. When we were in earlier in the week my GF thought to ask about a menu, the woman at the register gave her one. After a quick read through ( it's only two very short pages) we noticed it did not have a phone number. We asked, can we call ahead and order before we left the club ? The answer was yes for full pies, In fact, if your staying at the Cosmo, you can have it delivered to your room. Salvation !!! no more waiting in line with lots of other drunks.  So at 2:30 am before the haze of Grey Goose took over I called and ordered a full pie to the room.  An hour later, just after we got got back, there was a knock at the door and there it was, hot out of the oven. The delivery guy also brought several packs of fresh grated cheese and hot pepper seeds. It was perfect after a night of clubbing.  So put the number in your cell phones now.....you will thank me later  Pizzeria @ The Cosmo direct dial # 702-698-7860",

The pinball and arcade games give it a vintage feel. The pizzas are similar to NY style pizza with large slices. Can't go wrong with the mushroom and cheese pizza. The pepperoni and sausage pizza was also delicious. FYI - The slices are about $7.50 each. Overall, a great place to sober up and enjoy late night food.",

What was good about this pizza joint is the fact that it's New York style pizza and I'm a sucker for crunch thin crust pizza by the slice. I have to be quiet honest though that this place is a tad pricey compared to the normal pizza by the slice spots that I go to in the bay.  Me and the wifey simply came here on a very very small appetite, but the fact that we were in Vegas and looking for something to do, I suggested we searched for this so called \"Hidden Pizza\" spot I can always go for a nice slice of New York style pizza. Anyways we only ordered one slice of pizza to share amongst us two, as I mentioned before that we came here not hungry at all. Well, we ordered a meatball pizza, which was something we have never had before and thought it would be interesting to try something new along with this new place. The taste of the pizza was a bit odd, probably because the whole time I was eating this pizza I was thinking that meatballs can't belong on a pizza. But all in all the pizza was good, and I can't wait to come back here for another slice when I'm in the area. I also like the fact that this place is open late, not a lot of pizza joints that sell pizza by the slice is open this late.  Better believe I'll be back for more, and just maybe this place will get another star.",

    "text": "ORDER: two whole pies: the white pizza (all cheese, with ricotta cheese glops here and there) and one with meatball, pepperoni, and mushrooms (they don't have sausage...or pineapples...sad.), and 2 cokes.  GOOD: + Food: NY style pizza, thin, perfectly crispy crust, delicious! Absolutely one of the best pizzas I've had. And I've had lots of pizzas. (I might even like pizza more than the Ninja Turtles.)      + Drinks: free refills! (and they have a water cooler on the side by the register)      + You can buy by the slice (~$4) or the entire pizza pie (large, ~$23?). I do recommend NOT buying by the slice though, because it's pre-made and lamp-heated.  If you buy the whole pizza, it's freshly made and baked on the spot--you'll get it in 12-25 minutes and taste how good this pie really is. It really differs in comparison. + Tables: there are tables outside of this place to eat. You get to enjoy their pies in the mall atmosphere, with a beautiful ceiling and two areas of lush cushioned seating space.  BAD: - Location: How the heck does anybody find this place?! Seriously. I didn't even really see a name outside or anything. It's just by the elevator, down a long dark hallway... over the hill and around the bush and into the woods we go. - Food: The white pizza was a little tooooo greasy for me (because of baking all that cheese, the oils secreted and oozed and dripped out everywhere giving everyone a nice coat of oily lip gloss), but still was oh-so-delicious. Just shouldn't have too much of it.....      - Also, I really like pineapple. My guess is maybe this is not a traditional NY pizza topping? But still...sadness.      - Drinks: comes in a red party cup, no lid, no straw... and our coke was kind of flat.  For ~$4 for a party cup of flat coke, I was pretty disappointed. (However, the refills were a little more fizzy than our initial drink, so I guess it's ok. Still, I'd like to have a lid and straw...) - Atmosphere: This place is really a nook in the wall. It's so tiny. There's no place to really sit and eat, but there are small counter-tops that line the wall if you want to stand around and eat. Otherwise, you should really get your pizza and GTFO. :) So others can order and try some.      - There are classic arcade games and pinball machines inside, but they don't work? It's really more for looks and atmosphere than anything. It adds charm to the place, but the space could have been used for, oh, I don't know... seats?  They probably did this for two reasons though:           1. For a classic/casual pizza atmosphere, to have some of that Vegas pizazz in that tiny little room in the back of some random obscure hallway.           2. To encourage people to not sit around and stay and just GTFO so they can serve more customers. Geniuses, they are.  OVERALL: Ok, so I wrote more -'s than +'s in this review, but it all boils down to the food, and this is one place I'd definitely recommend to try when you're in Vegas.",

Luckily, I am an Elite Yelper and I pulled up Yelp on the phone, checked my boy Earl G's review because that dude is a cool cat. He told us exactly how to find them. It was like a Yelp treasure hunt.   So, for those who need assistance finding this spot, allow me. 3rd floor, next to Blue Ribbon Sushi. When you see the pool tables, stop and turn to the right. Down that hall way.  Pizza is OG NYC. I don't know the story behind this place, but my vision is like this. A New Yorker had his fingers on the concession plans for The Cosmo Hotel and was like, screw this crappy Pizza My Heart, food court pizza insanity! We are gonna do it NYC style over here!   I haven't been to NYC in years, but I felt like I was there when I tasted the crust at this bad boy.   First of all, Sicilian square slices are legit. Thick square and delicious! The selection we had was topped with sliced meatball, roasted tomato and ricotta cheese. Bomb!! Now, the thin slice was salami and peperoncini and boy were those little suckers spicy! When I got to the end and took a bite of the crust, I was transported back to the good ole NYC. Delicious crust is tough to come by but this place has it all.  A couple of tidbits:  Tiny inside BUT you can eat at the pool table area outside A bit pricey If you have more than a few folks and you order soda, get the 2 liter for $6.25 ask for some red cups and split it cause a single red cup of cola is $4",

It's the best pizza in Vegas, but not the best pizza I've ever had.   The location they have really sucks though. Super tiny and only one register so the wait is really annoying and long. Plus there's like only 4 stools for seating inside and that's pretty much it.   I usually come here on every Vegas trip cuz I'm a fatass and I love Dat cheezzzzz.",

It's always crowded but they do well with getting the line down quick and it's pretty small with no tables just a tall bar along the side of the wall with bar stools. But just right outside of the hallway you can find some couches and seats. It's pricey for just pizza but it's at the Cosmo on the strip, so expect to spend a little no matter where you go ;)   TIP: You won't find this place on any directories.

Anyhow, I digress... this place has amazing pizza. I have had it twice now, both times that I've stayed at the Cosmo, and I can't tell if the Pizza is that damn good or if I've just had the much to drink... or is it a healthy (lol) combination of both? Definitely worth trying... plan on waiting in a long ass line anytime after 11pm, when all the drunk people show up... but the line loves fairly quickly. Don't get discouraged...",

Plus, it's the cheapest food in the vicinity so a lot of the younger crowd who goes to Marquee comes here before and after for a relatively cheap bite.  What is up with this pizza? There's always a line here and I always wonder how and why it happened? I had some pepperoni slices lately and they were like licking a block of salt. There was a weird aftertaste from eating this pizza that no amount of soda could wash out. I think it is too much garlic powder on the crust. The crust itself was thin and tasted like nothing. Nothing special over here.",

Even at a random off hour of 4pm the wait was about 15 minutes and if you wanted a whole pizza we heard others in line get quoted 2 hours since you can phone head.  We went with  the only two options available, a bell pepper, pepperoni, onion, and 2 slices of mushroom.  The experience is what prevented me from giving this 4 stars but the pizza itself was definitely some of the best i have had. This is the Cosmopolitan after all; aka loud, full of drunk party-goers at all hours, and obnoxious groups still sporting their wristbands from the night before as if they just turned 21.  I felt bad for the workers but they gave back as much as they took.  You can tell they are used to the element that finds its way to Secret Pizza.  We saw people trying to hustle the workers by walking away without paying, people whining that they could not get what they wanted, and drunk fools in line; 4pm remember!, trying to become best friends with the guys behind the counter as they just rolled their eyes as if used to the nonsense.  I think it is a good thing there is no seating really, just four or 5 bar stools. If you could just get your slice and run out it is great!  We actually took our slices next door to Bellagio to enjoy.  Again the pizza is great, i guess if i was in college again i might have brushed off the hordes of drunken twenty-somethings.",

We got a 3 topping pizza: pepperoni, meatball, and mushroom. $26. The pizza was delicious, the sauce was perfectly seasoned, if only they give you a side to dip your crust in! It is a thin crust pizza, but not too thin and crispy, very enjoyable to eat. The place is hard to find, it is on the 3rd floor I think down a hallway... when they say 'secret pizza' it really is secret, they don't even have their name on anything! If you have the chance and are craving pizza... this is definitely the place to go!!",

The person that decided this place should be \"secret\" is a great marketer. The intrigue of a secret spot is what pulled me in. Finding this spot is actually pretty easy after a quick Google search.  We came in at lunch time on a Saturday to find that there wasn't a line. We stepped up, peeked in through the window, and selected our slices. My husband had the sausage and ricotta and thought it was awesome. I had the mushroom pizza and also loved it. The crust and cheese were delicious. I loved that the pizza was a little greasy like a pizza should be, but not in a gross way.   The board showed that they offer pizza by the slice and pizza by the pie. I saw people picking up whole pizzas. This would be a good option for someone looking for food to take to the pool or a quick meal to go. Pizza is $5 per slice which isn't cheap, but not ridiculous for strip food either.  Cool concept and great pizza that will fulfill any pizza craving.",

    "text": "THIRD FLOOR COSMOPOLITAN~  The perfect late night munchies after going to Marquee or just out in Vegas. It's a narrow hallway with a bunch of pictures on the side. No sign or anything but if you see a long line and people coming out with slices, you're in the right area.  CUSTOMER SERVICE: 4/5. The only reason I'm putting this is that if it is busy, be prepared to wait a good 45 minutes to an hour for a slice. Especially for boxes. Went on a Monday night at 4AM and only waited about 15 minutes.   WHY I DOCKED IT: The only thing to ruin the experience was we ordered a box of white pizza and they said it'd be 10-15 minutes. So we walked around and came back in about 10 and waited for our pizza. Our pizza was already DONE and the two cashiers who helped us didn't even bother to tell us they were done. A guy that was cooking the pizzas had to ask why we were just standing there. How are you that lazy to tell us our pizza is done? Unless your memory is that bad, what's your excuse? Worst service so shout out to the two ladies that were there chillin' at the register and not bother to tell us our pizza was done for another 15 minutes.  PRICE: $5.50 per slice $28 for a box  WHITE PIZZA: 5/5. White sauce is the best sauce. On anything. Alfredo sauce with a bunch of cheese is what this baby is made of. Love the globs of ricotta and it's thin pizza too! The crust isn't the greatest but still amazing.  OVERALL: 4/5. Go for the food, not the service. OH! AND SHOUTOUT TO THE GUY WHO DIDN'T EVEN HELP US AND KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG WHEN WE WERE JUST STANDING THERE WAITING AND ASKED US IF WE NEEDED ANYTHING. IF HE DIDN'T ASK, WE WOULD'VE NEVER GOTTEN OUR PIZZA. YOU DA REAL MVP!",

The dough is a sour dough the Corp chef's spent months perfecting.  Here is the back story.  When Cosmo opened it wanted a pizza place. Because space was at a premium, they planned this  to go pizza place. Hidden in an used area of the flor. There was a lobby pool table. Now removed, in the lobby area.  The hallway pictures were added to make it feel like you Are traveling to a NYC pizzeria, as was the pin ball and white attire of the cooks.  They had on the menu house made pickled peppers and desserts  sadly missed. But the popular pizza stile the show.  Late nights people but each other slices on line. They will make whole pizzas if you ask.  Really great pizza in Las Vegas",

I just could not understand how the pizza here was so worthy to be praised about soo much; I had to give it a try.    We thought we were gonna go on a hunt, but we found it right off the bat because we saw people walk out of the hallway with their pizza lol.  The reviews are True:  It does take about 20 min or so (although it really depends what you're ordering).  The white pizza is what caused our wait...but it was soooo worth it!  We got a white pizza and a pepperoni/mushroom.  Both were absolutely divine.  We went around 2pm and the line was maybe 10 deep?  It was so good I was craving it again at 1130pm that same night.  My loving husband (poor guy lol) was nice enough to go down and get one...until he saw the line.  It was crazy long and and wouldve taken about an hour.  So they are open late, but it does get highly crowded, probably because of the club.    The workers are fast and very friendly.  We wanted to take it back to our room, so I asked for another plate to use as a cover.  They are so accomodating and were nice enough to wrap our pizzas for us.  We are already planning our next trip back to Vegas and this is most definitely going to be one of our stops!",

Although it's meant to be a secret, the line the goes throughout the hallway sort of gives it away.  The staff is friendly and the service is fast(ish).  It's quality pizza. It's not stellar- again, unless you're hammered and need something to soak up that vodka, but don't knock it, because it's good.  I'm a pepperoni guy, but they have tons of options for you so don't worry, they've got the selection.  The down side: it's super small- super. Like five people inside here makes it feel crowded and there isn't much room at all to, \"dine in\".

My guest and I asked two securities guards and they both looked at each other and said \"it's a secret.....but it's upstairs on the * floor\". I will let YOU figure it out as we swore to not tell anyone ;-). However, it's worth the hunt to find the place. Yes, like any Las Vegas restaurant, it's going to be more expensive, especially since it's inside a casino/hotel. The pizza is amazing though. My guest and I each got a slice and it was more than filling for a snack. The full pizzas are pretty pricey, but if you're hungry, it'd be worth it. Beer and wine is also available to continue your buzz. Seating is limit, but there are tables in the lobby area of the secret location. The final secret I will give is that you will see a hallway of record album covers!  Now go find it!",

    "text": "Giving this place 4 stars because it closes at 5am and serves as the perfect post-Marquee food joint. Otherwise, Secret Pizza deserves more of a 3-star rating.   The concept of Secret Pizza is cute. You have to \"find\" your way to it, since there isn't a sign and it's not on Cosmopolitan's hotel directory map. It took us less than 5 minutes to find, though, so it's not some big secret. Simply go up to the third floor, find Blue Ribbon, and walk down the hallway located to the left of the restaurant. The hallway is covered in album covers.   The eatery itself is tiny. Most patrons don't bother to throw away their own plates, so the two short counters are cluttered with condiment remnants and crumbs. You order at the register and wait for your food to come out. Since it's usually made to order, it can take a while. If there's an already-made pie available, you can just purchase slices.   Prices are considerably high, especially considering the quality. Pizza slices are saturated in so much grease, you'd have to be crazy not to blot your plate with multiple napkins. Each slice literally comes with a pool of grease on the pizza and on the paper plate. We got two slices of cheese mushroom pizza for $11 -- so overpriced. A whole pie is about $30.   But Secret Pizza does its job -- feeding hungry bar- and club-goers who want a quick bite after downing too much alcohol. All that grease suddenly comes in handy when you need something to fill your belly besides alcohol.   Would I eat here on a regular night as an actual meal? No chance. But would I eat here at 2am when I just need something quick and easy? I did, and it was quite tasty.",

Because nothing in Vegas is really a secret and everyone in Vegas is friendly, just ask someone if you can't find it and they will draw you a map, talk you through it carefully, ask you about what else you're doing on your trip, and then walk you personally to the hallway. They have some pinball and a small counter to order along with some additional counter space hugging the walls to eat.   All of the pizza options are delicious. There are also some alcohol options, which taste as expected, but the pizza--the pizza is delicious. My favorite was the white pizza, which I didn't originally order but I overheard a private tour guide talking to a small family about how the specialty is the white pizza, so obviously I had to grab a slice. Dressed in garlic and oil, it was definitely the winner of an already victorious meal.",

I equate it to my 2nd grade Easter egg hunt-- I got tired, I got lost, but in the end I felt like it was worth it. Btdubbs, I literally followed some random stranger through the casino to steal a glance at the name on the pizza box... only to realize they don't have their name on the box because 1) it's a generic box and 2) duh, they're secret. My bad, moving on...  No offense to all the other pizzas they make here, I'm sure they're amazing. But my mission was to devour the white pizza and that I did. The second time we ate here, I actually did some Yelp research and decided to call my order in ahead of time. I was already staying at the Cosmo so the distance travelled is basically nothing, but my a$$ is lazy and the thought of waiting in line again sent shivers down my spine. It turned out to be the move though cause that line was CHUBBY.  I'll be back, white pizza. *Terminator voice*",

I understand the flux of people who are intoxicated are getting pizza to sober up, and I get that. Its understandable. But security there needs to be more knowledgeable how to treat people. Now as far as the staff, oh man. That's a different animal. I shouldn't not have to explain myself about calling a \"cheese\" pizza a regular slice. That would be redundant. It was an older man working there who wanted to have an argument with me over how I should call the pizza. Please! You have no right to start an argument over that, and have your staff come to your Aid because your old man working there. I'm correcting you because your being hostile with your customers. Then when I was arguing with the old man that younger man that was there with glasses, a little bit out of shape, and a pointy nose. He wants to kick me out because I'm correcting this guy for being rude to me. It's disappointing because the pizza is amazing possibly the best in Las Vegas. But the staff terrible. Horrific staff, a nightmare embodiment of unprofessionalism. I recommend no one to ever go here.  Pizza 10/10 Staff -10/10  Red",

We ended up asking an employee, then found It!  We were starving, so the pizza tasted so good!  The crust was crunchy, thin, and tasty!  I had a slice of meatball (sliced) with ricotta cheese ($6.25), and a slice of Combo pizza ($6.50). Yum!  It was filling!  The combo had more flavor than the meatball/ricotta cheese pizza and the crust didn't sag.  I'd get the combo again and maybe a slice of mushroom pizza...that was my next choice.  Just be aware that the Cosmopolitan Hotel charges for parking. After pizza, we walked around the Strip and ended up paying $7 total for a couple of hours.  Secret Pizza doesn't validate.  Tip: park for free across the street at Miracle Mile Shops",

It's probably the best pizza in the area, and certainly convenient if you're at the Cosmopolitan.  2. They have oregano, red pepper, and the other condiments usually only found in pizza places with True NY roots.   If you're from NY, this pizza will be substandard.   Decent, yes.  Cheap?  For Vegas, sure.   But that being said, it's very good for what it is.  A tad oily, as others have mentioned, but not a show stopper.    The line was long when I went there; fortunately, there were cool people in line with me to chat with.    Took around 15 minutes to order, and a whole pie would have taken an additional 30 minutes - and this was at 3pm.   I opted for a few slices instead, which were ready after a quick warm-up.     There's better food in Vegas - and certainly in the Cosmopolitan.  But for quick, cheap, and acceptable pizza, look no further.",

It's through a tiny alley entrance designed walls of music records, located in 3rd floor (above the day club) inside the Cosmopolitan hotel. You'll see the tiny hallway entrance as soon as you go up the escalator towards on the left side in between other restaurants.   Any slice of pizza is good, affordable and medium size for a slice. The cannoli is pretty good too. It's really small space inside, only enough for few people to sit so be prepared to stand while eating. We went right when it opened so it wasn't too busy. But definitely worth the pizza and cannoli.",

Hint: Find a hallway with a wall of vinyl albums. Is it the 1st floor or 3rd? I don't know, guessing is part of the fun. The two guys in front of me looked liked they were fellow New Yorkers so overheard their pick of slices and I trusted their choice and decided to try a slice of sausage and peperocini myself. Wow the cheese, the crust, the tomato sauce all the way to the dripping oil off the pizza screamed NY pizza. The sausage and peperocini were such a great compliment that from now on I will put peperocini on all my pizzas! Note the dining experience is more of a quick grab, eat standing up and go. So if you want to savor the moment I recommend ordering a pie to take out to the hotel rooom. Is it inconvenient to wait in line and pay premium price for a pizza yes, but it will be the best NY pizza you will have in the west coast.",

So, $30 for a pizza sounds high, right?  But when that pizza is bigger than the wheel of a monster truck and you're on the notoriously expensive and overpriced Las Vegas Strip, this is a screaming deal.  One pizza kept two of us fed (off and on) for easily three days and probably saved us from at least two or three $50+ meals.    The key to making it worthwhile is to time the line so there isn't much of a wait.  We skipped this place a few times when the lunch lines were massive, and although we tried once to call ahead and place an order, they never picked up the phone.  But on a weekday at 2pm - no problemo!  We ordered, took a quick wander, came back 20 minutes later and they practically greeted us at the door with our pizza and a big smile.  This place beats the pants off the late night pizza joint in NYNY, and if you've got a fridge or a big group, a full pizza pie is a great option.  For smaller groups, the individual slices are well worth checking out.",

My only complaint is, for a place that is labeled as \"secret', it draws insane crowds, mainly the club crowd late nights as its just steps away from Marquee. I've waited over an hour for a slice but it's totally worth it when all you really want is a greasy, tasty, cheesy slice. It helps they are open 24 hours.  The crowd draw is very \"colorful\", as you have the standard tourist party atmosphere folk, hookers, and Vegas locals...If you do choose to bare the wait, the hallway into the restaurant is filled floor to ceiling with tons of album art. Between that and the barefoot ladies coming out of the club and hookers negotiating deals with potential clients, there's no shortage of interesting things to observe..",

The pizza is quite good and was worth the amusement of searching for it. The actual establishment is quite bare bones.

So everyone who's been here either heard about it by word of mouth or found out about it through Yelp.  You'll completely miss this place if you walk by it.  It's on the second floor of the casino, across from the entrance to Marquee.  Their entrance literally looks like a walkway to an emergency exit or employees only area.    I had the pepperoni and sausage pizza and it was delicious.  We got there at 11am right when they opened so the pizzas were freshly out of the oven.  The crust was just the way I like it - thin and crispy w/ a bit of chewiness.  They open till 4 am so if you're craving for some late night grub after Marquee, this would be the place to hit up.",

We would have been better off picking up a couple slices instead of ordering a large pizza. The pizza was ok, but very greasy. I would eat here again to give it another try.",

    "text": "Literally SECRET pizza. If my friends weren't with me when looking for this spot, I would've walked right past it. The entry way is this tiny and long hallway on the Cosmopolitan's third floor. The hallway's walls are covered in old album art.  Arriving at like 1am, the wait was ridiculous. We waited in line for about 30 minutes to order 3 full pizzas. That plays into the wait, as we had to wait an additional 20 minutes for them to make the pizza. They have pizzas made, where you can buy \"by the slice\", but we had a party of 12-15 people so buying full pizzas was more reasonable. Waiting for pizza while being drunk is not the smartest move, but we really wanted to try to this place.  We ordered their version of a pepperoni pizza. It's not pepperoni; it's some other circular sliced meat on a pizza. I didn't think this was the most amazing pizza I'd ever eaten. I personally prefer Pizza Hut's pepperoni pizza over this one. The meat texture was a bit untraditional and I don't think my drunk taste buds enjoyed it as much as they thought they would. We also ordered their \"White pizza\". This pizza was so much better than the other! It tastes like really cheesy garlic bread that has a slight fluff to its bread. It's also chewy and very unconventional for pizza in a good way!",

Secret Pizza is truly a hidden gem and the line is insane but it's worth the wait when you get to the front and order and you can just see the guy behind the glass hand you a slice of pizza and the world couldn't be a better place. We got the classics: pepperoni, plain cheese, jalapenos and mushroom and the white sauce pizza which they made vegetarian and I am thankful for that. 2 pies cost us $70 after taxes and hey that it is one swell deal for Vegas.   So get your party on and then come get your pizza wait on and then have an after-hours dance party in your room with some pizza.  You have my heart and always will!",

Whether it be at 3am after some drinking and gambling or at 5oclock for a quick slice before i go drinking and gambling, the slices are always solid!  This time i grabbed two slices of pepperoni. This is like your typical slice place. They have premade pies and they grab your slices, throw them in the oven and reheat them. I always ask for well done slices to give them a little extra crisp. These slices came out perfect! All the flavors combine to make a truly delicious slice. I can't give it a 5 because it's not the best pizza you will ever have but it's really good. I could do with a little less grease and the price ($18 for 2 slices and a soda), but it's Vegas so i kinda get it.   I'll be back again and again for these slices.",

We ordered a customized pizza and had to wait about 30-40 minutes. We ordered sausage, pepperoni and mushrooms. It was quite delicious even though we took it to go. The workers there are very quick. If you want to just grab a quick piece that was already premade, you can be out of there pretty quick. They also have a few pinball and arcade machines to play while you wait.   I usually don't eat pizza but when I'm in Vegas I try to make a trip to Secret Pizza. :)",

I would definitely get your slice or pizza and take it to go.  One time they had a slice of white pizza with ricotta.  I preferred that slice, but it was cold in spots by the time I got to my room, and I went straight there.  When I got a slice of cheese pizza, it was also cold.  I don't think they heat them quite enough because they're trying to keep the line moving. Is this convenient?  Yes.  Is it quick? Yes.  Is it fantastic pizza??  No.",

Yes if staying the Cosmo ( as I was) would I walk from Bellagio or across the street from Planet H- probably not- I'd get Joe's. It was 20-30 minutes but wasn't too long.  So my fave pizzas in Vegas are the per piece joint like this one at the HARD ROCK and for a whole pizza the place near the hard rock- joe's New York but those are both east side joints- I didnlike that you can customize your slices. Everyone around seemed happy eating. I would say getting a whole pizza seemed to take a long time- go for the slice ( or try Joe's)  That said, the staff was organized- the line is long but once you get there they don't make it worse. I had a couple of the records they decorate with- heck yeah \"classics\"- I did ask for it to be picked to go- none issue- I was able to charge it to my room. I just wasn't sure some joints like this are cash.   I would say of all the Cosmo eats I had this trip- mostly their new food court this would be my recommend ( fine dining options and the buffet are another story)   That said- it was a way better option that the last late night foot order when I stayed at the Cosmo. I got high, hit a concert and ordered like $100 of nacho daddy after but passed out with like 1/3 eaten lol don't order high! Mexican food unlike pizza does not hold over Igor well lol",

There will most definitely be a long line, so enjoy the company of your fellow pizza lovers. The line moves slowly, and it will feel extra slow when you're extra hungry. Order at the counter - you can order by the slice or by the pie. My friend and I both went for a slice of pepperoni. I will have to say, I was not a huge fan. The pizza was pretty basic - sure, pepperoni is basic, but it's also a classic. It just didn't have that grease and salt factor I was looking for. Other people seemed to be enjoying their slices - perhaps these taste better with alcohol.",

Love that you can just grab a slice without getting a whole pie - especially since whenever Im in Vegas all I do is eat & get something everywhere I go  I got a slice of the WHITE pizza - first thing that stood out after the amazing thin crust was the legit freshness of the ricotta! Not your regular processed ricotta!!!! So soft, kinda whipped in texture & awesome flavor. I should have got 2 slices!!!!! Whole pies are about 30 bucks - a little pricey but worth it. My only disappointment was that I really wanted to knock on some secret hidden door & figure out a password to get in. Fun place with pinball machines - small but large enough & friendly staff. I'm sure we will make this spot a regular slice stop!",

Unfortunately, the wait is always long and of course you have to wait longer if you're ordering a whole pizza... but I can assure you that the wait is worth it.   The white pizza is absolutely AMAZING - it was like CHEESY HEAVEN - I loved how warm and nice the ricotta was on top of the other cheese. Pizza was perfect, not too bland, not too salty either.  Unfortunately, the combination pizza was on the saltier side and was not as enjoyable as the white pizza. It was our first time trying the white pizza and we were hesitant to get a whole pizza of it. However, we will not make that mistake again.   GET THE WHITE PIZZA.",

The people there are friendly and the place is open pretty late too, so if you're hungry after the club and need something grubby I'd suggest going here.

There's cheese, pepperoni, white pizza, white with sausage, sausage, and mushroom. If you want to order a whole, it's about $25.  My suggestion is to order a whole and then grab a seat inside the Chandelier Bar for drinks. Service can be super quick, but lines do build up during peak periods.",

I've been pretty fortunate so far as I tend to come during off hours with a only a few peeps in front of me.  They specialize in good ole NY thin crust but also offer Sicilian pizza.  My favorite?  The white pizza.    You can order by the slice or a whole pizza.  Service is quick and they've got a few chairs where you can sit and eat if you'd like.  Perfect place to satisfy your late night drunkenness or hangover.  Haha.    Open late and cheap, quick eats.",

    "text": "Not much of a secret but let me tell you why...  Saw this place on the TV show, Man Finds Food. He endorsed the white pizza which in my opinion is the best pizza they have! There was quite a line when we got there hence, my reason for stating that it's not much of a secret.  I ordered the supreme combo while the hubby ordered a slice of white pizza and their sausage pepperoni.   Their supreme combo is comparable to Costco's combo pizza and to be honest ( as I should be on yelp), I prefer the Costco combo pizza.  As for their famous white pizza, it definitely deserves its fame! This pizza has one topping and that topping is cheese!!! Why is it so delicious?! I think its the garlic and whatever combination ingredients they used to make the white sauce. Also, this pizza is made out of sour dough which adds to its delicious flavor. Their sausage pepperoni had some good flavor to it as well.  The place is small. Only a few bar seating on the perimeter. The line typically stretches out to the small hallway and ends at the counter where you can order and pay.   They have a small variety of fountain drinks and alcohol. There's also a water dispenser.   Staff are friendly and work very fast.   We ended up sitting on one of the Cosmo hotel loungy areas which wasn't bad at all...  Overall, don't even bother with the other pizza's. Just go for the white one and have your friends save a seat either inside or outside.",

The slices are large and are perfect to fold in half.  The sauce had a nice balance to it that almost took me back to a small pizza joint in NYC.    If you are looking for traditional pizza, with no funny toppings or craziness this is the place to go.  You can get it by the slice or a whole pie.  The service is very quick and efficient.  There are a few stools to sit on, but overall limited seating.",

We had a little bit of trouble finding it because my sister had been there before and we were walking around on the wrong floor too stubborn to ask for help but as soon as we asked someone for help we were pointed in the right direction.   We were a little put off by the $5/slice pricetag but my dad, sister, and I each ordered a piece. The crust came out perfectly and was so crisp without being burnt. I loved that they had shakers of oregano and garlic powder in addition to the usual red pepper and parmesan cheese. My mom decided not to order a piece but ended up taking multiple bites of all of our pizzas because it was so good!   If you want a quick cheap snack, I would definitely recommend Secret Pizza!",

It's so secret that it's literally not even listed on their maps or signs at the Hotel.  There's no sign to the entrance.  It is right next to the Blue Ribbon Sushi Restaurant and near Cosmo's Marquee Nightclub.  They open until like 4-5am usually.  Lines could be long, but this restaurant is a take-out place.  There's only a handful of bar-like stools where you can eat on a counter by a couple of old school game machines.  It's warm, loud, and crowded so I suggest you find a seat outside.  There's a complimentary pool table just in front of the entrance with seats around it.  Our family just ate our pizza there.  Waited 45 minutes for a whole pie of pizza.  It is overpriced, but it was still satisfying.  We ordered half Pepperoni and Half Sausage and Mushroom and it costed about 30 dollars.  They sell liters of soda or beer too.  The pizza was good. I want to come back to try the white pizza slice for sure.  Nothing too special about this place other than the idea that it's a secret. Overly hyped and over priced, but will definitely satisfy your pizza cravings.",

For my 20th review, I'm going to share with you a golden gem secret...The best place to eat in The Cosmopolitan won't cost you all of your night's winnings, and you won't be ready to go buffet again right away! But it's whereabouts are incognito, so I will yelp you out & share the secret! After a long night of committing sins in Sin City, you must find & dine at the clandestine \"Secret Pizza.\"   Secret Pizza is a hidden gem located in The Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, NV. It's a tiny, gemazing pizza joint located on the 3rd floor of The Cosmo next to the Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill. You will see an unmarked hallway that's lined with cool, vintage record album covers that is across from the pool table located in the middle of the room, go down it & enter secret pizza paradise!   Secret Pizza sells a variety of bomb, thin/foldable, NY-style pizzas sold by the slice that are pre-made & they warm up for you in the oven. The price for 1 slice is around $5-6, more if you get a specialty slice or add extra toppings. (Secret Pizza also has a \"deep-dish looking\" pizza slice option, but I didn't try it. This isn't Chicago, stick with the original, thin slices!) You can also order & carry-out a whole pie or customize a cheese slice like I did. My fave was cheese with mushrooms, green peppers & banana peppers, 5 gems!!  When I stayed at The Cosmo, I ended every night/began each morning at Secret Pizza or ate there after an expensive app at Milos! The pizzas are cut into big, triangular slices & have the perfect ratio of thinness while still having some girth; softness for folding with a nice, crispy crust; and contains the perfect amount of grease to equalize the night's BAC! Definitely not the kind of 'Za I typically consume but what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas!   FYI: Secret Pizza also has a free, self-serve/purified water tank, sells beer & has limited seating, only countertops & some barstools, no tables. However, you can sit & eat at the couches by the pool table I mentioned above.  So if you're stayin' or playin' in The Cosmo, win, lose or draw, you will definitely wanna make Secret Pizza your last call! Cuz one thing is for sure, you can bet your ass, ya will friggin' eat it all!",

Hearing about this place from a friend, we opted to call our pizza in and gamble while we waited for our order. They said an hour, but it was more like an hour and a half. But hey...you can't rush greatness!   Another benefit of phoning in an order is that you don't have to wait in that obnoxiously long line. You just go to the front and tell them your name and the sales associate will ring you up. Simple. But if you want just a slice or two, you're gonna have to wait in line, but trust me...it's worth it.   The hallway is decorated with framed record albums and you can pass the time waiting in line  looking at all of them or listening to other people in line talk about how drunk they are and need pizza to survive. Lol!  All in all my experience here was excellent. From the service to the pizza...top notch all the way.   Go. You won't be disappointed.",

We ended up getting a whole pizza (adding about another 20 minutes to the wait) and it was close to $40 once all the toppings were added in.

You can also grab a slice and people watch by the princely lit chandelier OR get a whole pie to go (what's room service when you have this??).",

    "text": "This place should be called \"incredibly packed pizza\" because that's what it is.   Secret pizza was a lot better when it was actually a fucking secret. The 1st time I came here I was able to walk right in at 4am, get my pizza, high 5 my friends & get my drunk ass back to my hotel. Now you walk up and wait in a line for 45 minutes.   All that annoyance aside, the pizza is actually good but you're definitely getting ripped off as a slice will run you a cool $5+ depending on toppings.  They should limit how many pizzas 1 person can buy. MFers be walking out with like 5 pizzas with a line out the door & then trying to sell it for double the price outside.",

    "text": "\"Secret Pizza\" is not the name of this pizzeria.  It actually has no name, but Secret Pizza will suffice for now.  It should be obvious by now that Secret Pizza is probably the worst-kept secret in Las Vegas.  Since everyone knows where it is already, I'll just go ahead and spill the beans -- Cosmopolitan hotel, third floor, tucked between Jaleo and Blue Ribbon Sushi, down the short corridor lined with vintage album covers.  Okay, now that I said it, don't kill me, please?  This isn't Fight Club, right?  I wasn't joking when I said everyone knows about Secret Pizza already.  The lines to eat here are obscene.  It's most popular in the middle of the night, when the post-Marquee crowd drops by to feed their drunken munchies.  However, when a group of us dropped by at 2pm in the afternoon, we still had to wait over 30 minutes just to reach the cashier.    Not that I minded waiting.  I could spend hours looking at the collection of vintage albums.  There's also pinball.  The pizzeria itself is decked out in gleaming white subway tile, in fitting with the New York theme.  We shared a variety of red slices, some plastic cups of PBR, and a slice of cheesecake.  While the pizza was fresh and delicious, it was doused in enough grease to make the paper plate translucent in no time.  (Remember that episode of the Simpsons when Bart rubs his pizza on the wall and then the wall turns clear?  Yeah, like that.)  There is barely any seating inside the pizzeria, so we carried all of the grub to the lounge area outside.  At $5 a slice, it's expensive, but not unreasonably so.  A better deal is ordering a whole pie.  I recommend that if everyone in your group can agree on a single topping.  All in all, Secret Pizza is a solid place to go -- if for no other reason than being able to help all the other confused tourists who are curious to find out where you got your pizza and beer from.  :-)",

Head for a small hallway lined with kooky vintage vinyl cover art and you'll find yourself at one of the best hidden gems Vegas has to offer.  We were starving and broke in Vegas (surprise, surprise) and found our way here thanks to glowing Yelp reviews. Boyfriend and I shared three slices and a PBR between us for about $17. There were no tables, just bar space for about five people, and the bars were taken up. We took our pizza out to the lounge area on the third floor landing and ate between some pool tables and a nonfunctional record player. The pizza was delicious New York style, very flavorful and fresh. They had yummy selections like meatball and pepperoncini. We waited in line for about 15 minutes, but it was totally worth it.  Hip, cheap, and tasty! Nothing more to say. :)",

    "text": "Legit New York style pizza. I wonder if they import the water.  Stumbled into the long, unmarked hallway at three o'clock something in the morning after a night at Marquee. Probably waited 30 minutes with the other drunkards. One of our party fell facefirst into a couch in the Cosmopolitan lobby waiting for us to get his re-up.  Pizzas are $5 per slice. Not cheap, but worth it. The server provides some clever banter while the cashier is all business. I'm a straight cheese, homey kind of guy. Need that red sauce, though. Friend swore by the white pizza, but the cheese was money. Also got that pepperoni, sausage, veggie, and other mix and match optionality. Or build your own pizza and sell it in the hallway.  Why? Because as we left, the line doubled in size. You walk out with your slice, loaded up with parmesan and red pepper flakes, and everyone ooh's and ahh's at the deliciousness. Jealousy abounds.  Sit down on one of the couches or seats in the third floor lobby. Fold that slice long ways: for the paper airplane inclined, that's hot dog style, not hamburger style. Get that sucker in your mouth. Prepare to be amazeballed.  Got our friend his re-up. Not a moment too soon. Another guy was completely passed out and the cops asked if he knew who and where he was. Not our problem; we got our guy. The pizza rejuvenated him...to lose more money gambling. You're welcome, Vegas.  Went back two days later sober to make sure the pizza was legit. No line. Still was.  Third floor of the Cosmo. See Jaleo or STK? It's roughly your six o'clock from there. Long hallway. Get the cheese. Or the white, if that's your style.",

Cool pinball machines and records on the walls and they serve their beer in red solo cups. There is not a lot of room to eat, but if you take it to go and eat it your hotel room that works for larger parties. My favorite pie is the white pie! Its amazing and a gem on the strip!",

It's not on the map or directory at the Cosmopolitan Hotel nor does it have a sign above the entrance saying \"Secret Pizza.\"  It's on the 3rd floor near the elevator.  Enter a long hallway and the place is literally a hole in the wall.  I came here with my boyfriend, and I had the impression that the pizzas would be more unique.  The pizzas are pre-made and each slice is popped in the oven for a few minutes as you order.  We asked the cashier what makes this pizza so great, and she replied, \"It's just good pizza.\"  For $5, we shared one slice of the white pizza, which is topped with ricotta and mozzarella cheese.  I never had an orgasm in my mouth from pizza before, and needless to say, my boyfriend and I should have gotten our own slice.  After devouring that slice of pizza, we pulled out another $5 and ordered a slice of sausage pizza.  That was also very delicious, but I prefer the white pizza.  If you come with a large party, it's best to purchase an entire pizza to share since it's cheaper that way.   Dominos and Pizza Hut just don't make the cut anymore.  This place is truly a treasure serving just really good pizza.  I wish there was another location in Orange County so I can fully satisfy my pizza cravings.",

After wandering around for a while, we finally found this place.   We didn't have much of a line in front of us, so we got our slices pretty quickly.   The slices were good, but not life changing and not worth the hassle of finding this place.   I get it, finding the \"secret\" spot is their gig, but it's not worth the hassle.    Will I be back?

I took a guess when I got to the 3rd floor and just went with my nose and the line of people standing in an unidentified hallway.   I tried the mushroom and pepperoni slice and the white pizza slice. Both were amazing, the mushroom and pepperoni may have been a tad too salty but still great. The cheese was melted on so gloriously but stayed intact enough to take clean(ish) bites, the mushrooms were just what I wanted to go with my meat. The white pizza isn't as greasy because there's no red sauce or meat, but it's still super tasty and probably the best white pizza I've had.  Prices are a bit high, $5.50-$6 for a slice. But hey, just do it.",

Complete with pinball machines and an old school Galaga arcade game, it gave me a feeling of stepping back in time.  You can order a variety of slices, which are quite large, or just a whole pie. The crust is thin, the toppings are plentiful, and the cheese is melted just right. You can even have your slice made with \"white\" sauce instead of \"red\" sauce. In hindsight, it may be smart to ask for marinara sauce to dip your pizza crusts into once you have finished your slice.  One drawbacks - SEVERE LIMITED seating. There are only 8 stools there and limited counter space.",

    "text": "OK...maybe it's not the best pizza on earth. I don't know what is. I don't think I've had it yet, but if you think this is not at least in the running (top 3) best pizzas in Vegas I have a feeling you probably really like a Hot-N-Ready.  You can argue the merits of all the different types of pizza out there all you want...the bottom line is that it's about balance, without going overboard. In my opinion this pizza is far and away better than anything I've had west of the Mississippi. The crust is fresh made, but has just the right amount of toasted crunch from the oven. The cheese is not so overbearing that it's all you taste. The sauce on both the white and the red are amazing.  I like the white, but I really like the full flavor of the red sauce. It tastes more like a quality marinara than it does just pizza sauce. The toppings are all premium ingredients Quartered roma tomatoes, really good and greasy pepperoni, real cheese.  Guess what? Those cost more. It's a complicated business concept I know. Really though...I'm the most price sensitive person I know, but if you think $5 a slice is not an accurate price point, then I would say stick with the 2 slice combo at Costco. Have any of you considered where the hell this place is? It's in the Cosmo...on the strip... Does anybody know how much 2 slices & a drink will run you at Sbarro?  & just in case you think i'm just taken in by the \"secret\" theme of the place. I actually went inside & stumbled across it the first week Cosmo was open. I didn't know it was a \"secret\" until I started hearing people talking about it. Then the only reason I finally tried it was because Angela H. dragged me over there and force fed it to me. Usually im pretty \"meh\" when it comes to pizza. I don't tend to seek it out. If it's there I'll eat it. But this place really does it for me. If you have only been once I say this... Give it another try. Everybody who does the volume they probably do for such a small shop is prone to have an off night.  If you had it twice and just don't like it....well....Little Caesar's is open til 10.",

Got a house special sausage slice, a pepperoni, pepperoncinni and extra cheese red sauce slice, a slice of white pie with ricotta, sun dried tomatoes, garlic and artichoke hearts and the last slice I got was whatever they had readily available, do not remember exactly what it was.    Good pie, NYC style but not the best in the world, had better in LA for that matter.    and yes I said better in LA, we do have good pizza if you out of towners care to look around for it.

All the sauce and toppings stayed put.   I should have got two slices as it wasn't as filling as it looked.

There is a line that doesn't look too bad, but it is deceiving! A tip is to call in before and pick up your pizza to save time. In Vegas, time is money, so save your money!  The pizza is good! They offer a red or white (cost a bit more) sauce and it's all thin crust. You can buy by the slice (which also saves time) or you can get a full pizza which is the better deal if you have a lot of hungry people. They are literally 3-5 stools in the restaurant only because there's just enough room for people to stand around to wait for their order. You can grab a stool to sit if you have few people or just prepare to bring it back to your room. Orrr you can sit in the common area/lobby and be asked where you got the pizza from.",

After finding the \"secret\" hallway, we stormed in like gangbusters, asked the nice pizza man what was \"good\"  to which he rightfully suggested his own \"meat lover's\" version -- a seemingly off-the-menu creation concocted of pepperoni, sausage, peperoncinis, some other kind of meat, and some other stuff I'm failing to remember.  It was SO DAMN GOOD -- the not-so-soggy thin crust was absolutely what we needed, so much, that it got the stamp of approval from the two Manhattanites I was...ahem...dining with.  This WHOLE PIZZA easily fed 3 inebriated people or would feed about 37 models, 4 normal people or 15 people on a diet.  It should be noted that the two latter classes of people really don't belong in Vegas anyway.  There is minimal seating inside, but you can take your pizza \"to-go\" and park it on one of the Cosmo's luxurious couch seating areas in the hall right outside.  Beer and wine only.",

During our first visit to Secret Pizza at 11am on a Saturday morning, there was no line and no wait. Piping hot pizza served to you right away. We grab a seat at the clean and sparkly counter and all is right with the world.  Our second time visiting secret pizza, we head up to the third floor at around 1am. We encounter several people in the elevators all vying for the same pep slice. Some friendly conversation ensues, and suddenly without further discourse, folks start stretching out their legs, warming up pushing their way towards the elevator door. As soon as this door opens in the elevator, I kid you not,  there is a mad dash to the \"secret\" hallway. This would have been epic, however, we are all  stopped in our tracks because there is a line of about 30 people ahead of us. Womp. Womp. The line moved pretty fast. It took about 15 minutes to get our slices. However, the state of the little pizzeria was quite different from our 11am visit. At this point in the night, the counters are littered with pizza crusts, empty drink cups and used napkins soaked in pizza grease. The red pepper and garlic shakers are empty and the woman ringing up your pizza, will tell you \"No\" before you're even done with your question (the lady ahead tried to ask for ranch dipping sauce for her crust). The pizza was just as good though.",

    "text": "Went to Vegas this past weekend and one of the highlights of the trip was hitting up this unnamed (yet not much of a secret) pizza joint in the Cosmopolitan Hotel. Luckily, I've got a friend out there that my wife went to school with so we learned about it almost instantaneously.   The walk up into this place is pretty impressive. The Cosmopolitan is actually one of the nicer hotels in Vegas, and you don't actually get forced in the casino the second you walk in. It definitely seems to cater to a 20 somethings crowd, which I think is very appealing for people that my age bracket, but I can imagine might be tedious for people that are a little bit older.  So, on to the pizza itself. The place is small and down a fairly long hallway. They've got some pinball machines and a counter where you order and pay. No seats, but there's a little lounge back out in the hotel, so it's really not  a big deal. Their pizza is greasy and has a good crust.   It's fucking expensive. Seriously, I don't usually complain much about price with food, but $4 for a slice is absurd. David Chang isn't making my fucking pizza back there, and even if he was I'm pretty sure he wouldn't have the balls to overcharge on a slice.   Bottom line, it's definitely good, and I'm sure it's absolutely fantastic if you're shit faced. It's worth probably once, but unless you're right in the area you shouldn't go out of your way.",

There is limited counter space to stand at, and even more limited stools on which to sit.  They also have some arcade games, and the walls of the mini alley are lined with countless photos which was pretty neat.  My biggest woe is that it took forever to find!  The Cosmopolitan doesn't have any signs up for it, and it's hidden in this alley way to the right of an Asian restaurant, near a non-functional glass elevator, 3rd floor.  Don't bother with Google Maps walking directions either, it takes you outside where you can smell the darned pizza baking but you can't see it!  Talk about a rough night...",

When you pass down the somewhat hidden halway and find yourself in a little nook serving pizza, you know you have the many few who have found the place.  The menu is very simple.  The red sauce or the white pizza.  You can get the combo or ask them to add more toppings to the cheese.  It's a good pizza with a nice thin crispy crust.  Ingredients are top quality and put together really well.  The white slice was also good, but I found the cheese a bit overwhelming on this one.  Its greasy..but thats what pizza is supposed to be!

As for the other pies sitting just there, they don't have that hot out of the oven taste.  The pepper and pepperoncini pizza was not good at all.  Not as hot as the cheese, and the taste of the pepperoncini  kills that pizza taste.  So for the taste itself, one great slice of the cheese, and one horrible slice of the combo, and factoring the high price ($4.75 for the cheese and $6+ for the combo, it was a little disappointing.  Stick with the cheese slice, and you'll be happy.  It's pretty good, but I don't have that urge to go back.  Curiosity satisfied....how much better can a cheese pizza get?  Next",

The customer service was very good, but I wouldn't go there again because the food was nothing special.

Customer service: 5/5 For the place being filled with a ton of overly drunk people, the staff is surprisingly patient and likes to describe the pizza if you ask. Also a shout out to the hotel staff for them helping my group and I find this place (it is really hidden with no sign). You have to be on the third floor near where marquee would be (by the center chandelier bar).  Ambiance: 5/5 The place is hidden and down a long hallway but it opens up to a tiny 5 seater bar with a pizza bar where you watch them make the pizza and cut it up and serve it to you. Amazing! Also, it has an old arcade (I think it had two games, a pinball and an actual arcade game). Cool retro art littered the walls. I loved this place and it's definitely a new fave!

For you newbies, I'm going to keep you guessing, but I would imagine that just scrolling through a few of these reviews would pinpoint this place for you. Hint: Look for the hall...  Plain and simple, Secret Pizza REALLY needs to be renamed. How about Scrumptious Secret Pizza? But really, this place is so damn good. I've been about half a dozen times now and I've had a consistently tasty product. They have various pre-made pizzas, and then they stick the slice(s) in the oven once ordered. Sounds cheap and \"not good,\" but let me tell you, IT'S GOOD. I love their flattened meatballs and their large pepperoni slices. Hell, it's all good. The crust is really what helps make this pizza way above average..crunchy yet a bit chewy and dusted with flour on the ends. Again..yum. Plain pieces of cheese pie run $4.50, and each topping is $0.50. My meat-lover's slice I had in December ran $6 but it was so worth it.   TIP: This place's peak hours tend to be when all the drunkies leave Marquee post 1 or 2 AM (uh...guilty). Be prepared to wait maybe even 30 minutes for that late night snack to soak up all of the alcohol you may have just imbibed in Marquee.  Beware: You want a soda? That'll cost you $4, and it's served in a red solo cup. wait...what?   Unfortunately, I have to take the ambiance into account...and SP is not exactly what I consider pleasing. Yes, I understand that it went for the New York parlor pizza type of replication, but there are some sketchy people in here pretty often (last time there was a pimp...you just know when you see one).  However, the staff I've encountered have been pretty laid back and cool. They'll slice your piece in half if you ask!",

The place is very small so try and grab a seat outside first or take it to go and eat it on the go. They provide you a big box that you can tear into plates. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. We ordered 4 slices of pizza and a salad with salami, which was actually pretty good. They warm up pizza by the slice for you or they can make you one. It's a little pricey at 5+ a slice but nothing in the cosmo is going to be cheap.   Pizza was nice and thin but not too thin. The crust was crunchy and not too thick. The salad was fresh and salami was good with spice. Get the salad to make it feel like you're not too fat.  The place was harder to find because of reading the reviews. Just go up the escalators to the third floor and it's a small hallway with records on the wall, located to the right of the pool tables. It's next to some open walled restaurant.

Came up to the counter to order, however you can only order slices they have at the moment in front. That's the only downside of this  Otherwise great flavors and pizza.",

    "text": "This place wasn't as hard to find as I had imagined. Many of the employees at Cosmo were very helpful in pointing out the directions along the way. The inside reminded me a lot of NYC's pizzerias and they even had those ancient arcade games you hardly ever see anymore.  Though the line wasn't too bad (I came here for lunch), the price for a slice of pizza was a pretty penny. I think ~$5-6 for a slice is a bit pricey, but ordering the whole pizza isn't that much cheaper either, considering the # of toppings.  The texture of my pizza was crispy and thin, I loved it. I ordered the combo slice with all the toppings. Overall, it was delicious, and a great place to stop by with friends.",

Go with the white slice.  I thought it was white sauce (cream) but it was actually no red sauce, cheese, ricotta. Pretty good. I liked being able to add stuff to it (additional 50 cents per topping) but I wish they had some bacon. Better than the traditional pepperoni w/ red sauce that's for sure. And yea, it's thin crust and ultra greasy. If you're going to complain about grease, don't bother eating pizza. Do the world a favor and eat a damn salad with no dressing okay?   I don't get why people order an entire pie and then whine and moan that it takes up to an hour. IT'S A FREAKING ENTIRE PIZZA IT'S NOT GOING TO BE READY IN 5 MINUTES PEOPLE. USE YOUR BRAIN.",

    "text": "For months I have wanted to sample the pizza inside the not so secret back room at The Cosmopolitan, but just never got around to it before now.  But once Tropfest ended, the planets finally aligned, and Diane and I quickly left the Boulevard Pool via escalator and easily found our way to this highly touted haven of late-night pizza at last.  The line to order was fairly long even after 1:00 a.m. on a Monday.    And, I quickly learned that if pizza slices rather than a full pie are sought, what you are able to get totally depends on what comes out of the pizza ovens just before one's order is placed.    But luck was with us on this visit, for we were able to buy fresh hot slices of pepperoni, sausage, and cheese pizza, plus commandeer two adjoining seats at the counter to be able to eat while sitting down.  Although I might have preferred slices of pepperoni & mushroom pizza, no such combination was available when I reached the head of the line.  But getting to try three out of four flavors is pretty good!  I was really pleased with this pizza.  My expectations were high going in, but they were exceeded.  The crust was nice and buttery, with no char on the bottom.  While the wide slices were relatively thin, they were not noticeably so, and the nicely finished crust was chewy, resilient, and foldable.  All slices were just saucy enough, and really cheesy and tasty.  Pepperoni was lightly spicy, and sausage was very mild, just as pizza maker Luigi had indicated when I asked him on my way through the line.  A small amount of grease was present, but to me that was a good thing for this New York style pizza.  Even though they had come out of the oven just a few minutes before I reached the cash register, each slice was given a little more fire before they were handed to me.  So they were hot and gooey, and a True treat to consume whether drunk or sober.  For, I loved this pizza, and unlike many other guests, had only water to drink all night.  In fact, the Secret Pizza establishment graciously offers free cold water out of a dispenser, with plastic cups and utensils provided as well.    Besides probably being the cheapest meal available inside a Strip hotel, IMHO the Secret Pizza likely serves the best pizza on The Strip, and is neck and neck with Biaggio's and Metro Pizza, and just a shade behind Dom DeMarco's, for the best pizza served in the entire Las Vegas valley.  Next time I will be ordering a whole pie!",

Each of us ordered something different: white pizza with ricotta, pepperoni, sausage + pepperoni, and mushroom + sausage + garlic.     - they reheat the pizza - cardboard crust - overly greased with oil  - no flavor unless you add sauce on them - slice of pizza definitely not worth $5",

We go here every time when we visit the Cosmopolitan and then head over next door to Blue Ribbon for a drink. Anyhow, as we were ordering, my boyfriend pointed at the pizza he wanted. I suppose, pointing at the slice he wanted was probably seen as rude at his point of view. BUT... by all means -- he should of never knocked off my boyfriends finger out of the way. I was pretty furious. My boyfriend let it go because he could see he wasn't having a good day. I'm sorry I work in the Food and Beverage industry and I always TIP very well... and I know how stressful it can be but the way he acted was not professional. I couldn't leave any TIP after that. I just wanted to address this issue because he made the crew look bad, that even the lady at the front of the cashier questioned his behavior. I suggest if he wasn't having a good day he should of gone home. I gave 2 stars, the lady at the cashier was nice and the pizza wasn't too bad. Whatever that dude is going through, hope he gets it together and don't let his real life issues affect his performance on the job. Also, he should NEVER touch someone like that again.",

We followed the smell of fresh baked pizza and found this hidden gem. This would be the place to go after 1am. For the price, it's reasonable and good for hangover/buzz. First night, I ordered a whole cheese pizza $26 and it took them 20minutes to baked it fresh. TOTALLy worth it, the cheese was bubbling, the crust was soft and yet crispy. It was perfect!! I downed 2 slices in silence....  On the second night, I speculated that the whole pizza with certain toppings are already made and will be reheated in the oven when you order. I dont think the quality will be the same.  Keep an eye on the fresh pizza as they bring it out and order that!! (hopefully you are sober enough). We ended up getting a slice of sausage cheese pizza and the cashier just handed to us (not a reheat slice.. score!!). I thought the sausage was too salty. I'm still craviing the fresh cheese plain pizzza....",

One place that I kept seeing mentioned was the \"secret pizza place.\" At first I thought it was a joke since people were saying there was no sign for the actual place and were giving vague descriptions on how to get there. Once I found out this was an actual pizza place with great reviews I had to find it! I can't get enough of their pizza! I always get a slice of white and always make at least 2 trips to this place each time I visit Vegas. I did have a little problem finding this place during my last visit, even though I had been here quite a few times. My husband stayed in our room while I ventured to get pizza after several (or more) drinks. I got so lost that I just ended up going back to the room after an hour. The next day after my head was a little more clear I realized I was looking around on the wrong floor, but that was all on me LOL",

Then go straight down the unmarked hallway right in front of you which is lined with old record sleeves. it opens up into a mostly standing room affair with a few stools along the walls, some pinball machines, and 2 TVs with sports.  Drinks are sold from 2 liter bottles and poured into solo cups at something like $4 per cup. This is crazy expensive. Luckily they have a little water filtration machine that you can get free water from in the corner next to the cash register. This is the way to go.  You can order a custom pizza which takes a while, or they can just heat a slice from the already made pizzas. $4.50 for a cheese slice is the base price. You then add 50 cents for each additional topping. I had the pepperoni and sausage for $5.50, and felt like the price was a little up there for a single slice that wasn't even over-sized.   Sausage and peperoni was only ok. Sausage was there physically, but lacked any flavor. I'd skip that topping. Pepperoni was tasty and a little salty. Still not a huge winner, but a good standard slice.  The crust was good. Thin and crunchy, resisting sogginess for a while, and is a great starting point for these pizzas.   The white pizza was by far the best. Ricotta and garlic make this more resistant to sogginess, and the taste combo is delicious. Very subtle ricotta and not so subtle garlic really take this to the next level with the great crust. The white pizza is the one to get. Case closed.",

You should really just order a whole pizza, or a series of slices and go to town in your car or in your hotel room or something!   SERVICE: 4 - They are pretty speedy for the amount of people that they get...but not speedy enough haha! They do have really fun people working behind the scenes though. But they usually don't have time to converse or anything, they're just too busy for that business!   FOOD: 4 - I think that they have the best pizza in Las Vegas. It's semi-pricey..but it's definitely worth it. It's just so delicious, and I don't even love pizza that much...but this place is so bomb!!! If it wasn't such a hassle to get to in the middle of a hotel, I'd probably grab pizza here all the time!",

Reasonably priced since it's Vegas. Definitely can do this place for a full meal or just to get by in a pinch. Large pizza slices and serves alcohol. Don't buy the water. Small (1/2) size cost $4.50, wtf... Better to get beer or bring ur own from the casino.",

The ingredients are so simple and yet each slice of pizza that reaches my tastebuds are so savory! I simply can't help myself so I try and come here each time I am in Sin city. Locating the place is a journey it self and it is always awesome seeing other people trying to find the place...walking past it...and then getting help from those who know exactly where it is.   The inside is small and space for standing to enjoy your meal. Not many stools for sitting, but hey who needs to sit when they have pizza!   I recommend getting a slice with sun-dried tomatoes!!!  The thin crust is great and lets the topping be the star of the pizza.",

    "text": "Secret Pizza (Cosmopolitan) Las Vegas Strip, NV 3pm Tuesday 6th August 2013 Four Stars  Located on the top floor of the Cosmo restaurant/shop area, this little pizza place delivers a great snack.  We enjoyed a $5 slice of Mushroom and $5 slice Green Pepper and Onion.  The crust had a crisp outside and soft inside.  The toppings were nicely cooked.  They even serve beer in red plastic cups.  If you a person who is price sensitive, then here is a tip about Vegas: 1. Look at the Vegas Price 2. Divide it in Half 3. Think: would I buy this for this reduced price at any other place 4. If yes, then Buy  Example: $5 slice of pizza in Vegas is really a $2.50 slice of pizza anywhere else, which is a great deal.  Note: This formula works in a lot of places, such as Disneyland, the Fair, and any sporting event.",

    "text": "Yummm, this is definitely some of the best pizza I've had. My friend who lives in Vegas says the three institutions are: Earl's, Pho Kim Long, and Secret Pizza. All of these places are delicious and Secret Pizza is no exception.  We ordered half white pizza and half sausage, pepperoni, and sun dried tomato. It was just as delicious as that sounds. I still prefer the white pizza though--can't go wrong with ricotta cheese and garlicky white sauce. The other half was a little salty for me, and the entire pizza was dripping in grease, which I suppose can be either a plus or minus. Don't get me wrong, this pizza is DELICIOUS, the crust is perfect, the ingredients are fresh and flavorful. It's a little pricey, about $30, and soda is $4 each, although you do get unlimited refills. But hey, it's Vegas, and it's in the Cosmopolitan. Definitely worth a try at least once, although I'm willing to bet you'll be back for more. Also, if you know you're coming in advance and you want to get a whole pizza, call in advance because it can take 20-40 min to bake depending on how busy they are.  I would definitely try to come here with someone who has been before because it's pretty hard to find. I would try to give directions in my review except I still don't know where it is, haha. Third floor of the Cosmopolitan, then ask for directions! Perfect place to grab a bite to eat when clubbing at Marquee... if you get out by 5 am, that is. :)",

Found it easily enough( for las vegas first timers)  We rang ahead ( using yelp ) and picked our pizza up 30 mins later, the queues were out the corridor but moved steadily, we could nip up to the collection point so avoided the waiting.  The pizza was great, really tasty, all 3 of us enjoyed it, me, my husband and daughter all loved the pepperoni.  The staff were pleasant and courteous despite being slammed busy... Job well done i'd say! :-)",

It was ok for new york style, and I'm sure the drunk people love coming here after a night of debauchery for a bit of pizza.

While celebrating my 25th extravaganza in Vegas last week, I am guilty of being a repeat offender of Secret Pizza. For a bunch of girls (and boys) who revolves our schedules around eating and trying new places, I would say that is quite a compliment!  Here's how it all started. Before we decided to go bar crawling in the Cosmopolitan, a local friend of mine told me that I should get the white pizza at Secret Pizza. Intrigued by this mysterious pizza joint and white pizza, the gang and I headed over in our tight dresses to devour some deliciousness. Being greedy as ever, I decided to go for their famed white slice and a combo. Halfway through, I realized my stomach is much smaller than I thought and had a difficult time finishing. The unique taste of the white pizza (composed of 3 different types of cheeses) had my taste buds jumping for joy but the familiar taste of the combo had me equally impressed.  Secret Pizza makes me feel like I'm so \"in the know\". From the outside, no one would know what the hallway leads to. For those who rarely ventures off into random hallways, well that's their loss! I plan on coming back next time I'm in Vegas, so yelper's-- please keep the long lines as short as possible by keeping this place a secret!",

The interior decoration was fun, a couple machines for people to kill time with while inhaling that greasy yet mouth watering smell of fresh pizza. As I walked closer to order, my eyes widened and spotted the server tossed a freshly made Mushroom pizza in the bottom pizza drawer, I yelled (I think I yelled), I want that! Oh yes, it was filled with lots of fresh mushrooms and great crust. Wish I had ordered more, but man, it was pricy, but you do get what you paid for.   I am coming back again, hopefully more sober so I can actually take a decent picture and enjoy the pizza.",

Damn, $11 for 1 slices of pizza?! This place better be worth it!  The white slice just had too much ricotta cheese for me - as in piles. The crust was thin and was super crunchy, which I enjoyed very much!  The combo was good although my crust was already soggy. BOO!   The slices were filling, but you may just wait to share a pie with someone else. There are only a handful of chairs, a couple of video games and a couple of standing tables. You can bring your slices out to the lobby area to eat, as many people did.   Don't forget to check out the pics along the walls! Interesting!!!",

    "text": "So why is this place a secret? Because it's freaking hard to find late at night when you're trying to wander back to your hotel. XD.  So how do you find it? Look for the rows of vinyl records on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo. Or better yet, follow the smell of cheese!   The place is pretty small, no tables, 4 stools and a few pizzas that were premade. Each time I went, I ordered the white cheese pizza with pepperoni and meatball for $6! Each slice is pretty large so it should fill you up (think costco pizza). As for a whole pizza, it's about $30 plus.  Overall, great pizza for cheap (for the strip). A super popular place once you're done with the club!",

    "text": "It was worth the hunt to track this damn place down! No signage of any kind at this hotel. You just have to know where it's at. At $5 per slice, you get a huge slice that inevitably needs to be folded. This place is very to the point. Pick your slice and pick your toppings if necessary. It's $0.50 per topping.   They typically have the cheese, pepperoni and white pizza (with different types of white cheese). I'd recommend the white pizza and have them sprinkle some of that mushroom on there! Freaking delicious and worth every penny. Walking in here took me back to NY. You order at the counter and wait for them to reheat it and then enjoy. Make no mistake, the pizza is reheated in their massive pizza oven. Not just some sad microwave.   There are no tables in this joint. If you intend to eat there then you'll be eating at the counter that's outlined the entire place. They have a couple vintage arcade games in there to keep you entertained. You can watch whatever sports they have on TV. Otherwise, take the pizza and enjoy a nice game of pool just outside in the seating area of the hotel.  I make it a point to get a slice every time I've come to Vegas. Totally worth the trip!",

I've never been a HUGE fan of pizza, but this thin, wide slice was simple and flawless.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=3cIZSbjXqJxr59N_84xHKQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQp...</a>  Do you remember when Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael (TMNT) ended their adventure by tearing down a slice of ooey gooey cheese pizza?

This place does live up to its name since I had to ask two Cosmo employees to point me to the direction of this place; no signs or the name is not on the directory. The place is small and there is counter space for people to quickly eat their pizza but if you want to have conversation I would recommended just heading out right outside where there are couches and pool table to eat and enjoy your meal.  Now onto the food, I first ordered the sausage and pepperoni and within the first bite I was hooked! What makes this great pizza is their crust, it has just right amount of texture between doughy and crunchy. Because of this I've been back 3 times within my 3-day in Vegas needless to say I'll be back!",

Although it is hidden, it's not too hard to find at all.  Located on the third floor through a hall way full of records.  If you look directly in the hall way you should see a TV and a pin ball machine.    They serve pizza by the slice or whole pizzas.  My friends and I decided to get a whole pizza with 5 toppings.  We got pepperoni, meat ball, sausage, ricotta cheese, and banana peppers on the side.  Cost was $29.  We took it outside and devoured it shortly.  Sitting next to the pool table on the couch.  We added crushed red peppers, parmesan cheese, and garlic salt.  It was so tasty and good.  Yes it's thin crust, and after pulling the slice apart, the cheese stretches and the toppings at the tip falls off.  Greasy but tasty, if grease is a problem you can use a napkin to dab at it.     This has now become a must come to spot every time we come to Vegas.",

However, the quality of the pizza and selection is subpar. (BTW in case you are wandering, this is located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan hotel)  The first time I went, I had to wait in line for almost half an hour and there's almost no seating inside the place and minimal seating outside as well. This makes eating pizza while holding your water cup extremely difficult. This time when i went, at least there was no line. The choices of pizza were whatever and it wasn't that clear you could add toppings onto the pizza. Each slice was about costco but it cost around 6 dollars without toppings and probably more with each topping. The plates they gave us were very flimsy and the oil leaked through. The pizza flavor wasn't very rich and and crust was not good at all. I have had way better pizza and I don't understand the hype here.",

Track down the nearest person with a huge pizza box and ask them to direct you to the secret pizza parlor they just picked it up at. Trust me, it works wonders!  The full pies are expensive, but definitely more economical than paying per slice. Also, when you are craving that chewy, gooey goodness at 3AM and all the pizza delivery boys have been asleep since 2AM, paying close to $30 for a pie is definitely worth every penny.  It may be a bit of a wait (20-30 minutes) if you are custom ordering a pizza, but when you are stumbling back to your hotel room with that piping-hot fresh-out-of-the-oven pizza in your hands and everyone else is staring at you in jealousy, you won't even be mad.    The retro decor is tacky, but we're just there for the pizza right?",

This simple secret pizza joint found somewhere on the 3rd floor at the Cosmo in Vegas is serving crack pizza and they are calling it \"The white slice\"  I don't know what's on it, it's so simple and plain...just some kind of cheese and maybe some garlic? I dunno, but it is PHENOMENAL! I actually ordered a slice with a bunch of stuff on it cuz the \"white slice\" looked so plain, but I took a bite of my friend's and liked it better than the one I ordered! I went back and ordered it 2 more times.   I think they close around 4am because when I first went to try it, it was closed :( I wanted to try it after seeing it featured on a TV show couple years ago and I always remembered it and boy am I sooo glad I did :) I dream about this pizza every night!

    "text": "This is one of my wife and I's go-to late night spots when we come to Vegas.  It's cheap ($4-5 a slice), classic floppy New York style pie, and some scrumptious options are available.  The white sauce pizza has a heavenly bite, it's the slice I'd recommend above all else if you're being skimpy and only eating one.  But this pizza is great and life is short, so you should definitely have two.  The peperoncino and sausage is my backup, and also wonderful to the taste buds.  There's not much to say about the restaurant itself, it's basically just a pizza stand tucked down an alleyway on the third floor of the Cosmo.  They have pictures lining the walls with celebs who've visited, and the staff is friendly and helpful.  The Cosmo is also quickly becoming my favorite hotel in Vegas, because even though I haven't stayed there yet I seem to find myself there on every trip whether it's to gamble, take in the young nightlife, or drink at one of their nice bars/clubs.    so stop on in, have a few drinks at The Chandelier, and fill that belly",

Yes, that's right, Yelperati, you got it wrong.  Normally, I wouldn't be so confident saying so in the face of nearly 3,000 prior reviewers, but due to the fact that it's in Vegas, and it's aimed at the post-midnight and pre-dawn crowd, I feel pretty safe in bringing this to light.    I tried the pepperoni and sausage, meat lovers, and cheese varieties.  Thin, greasy slices are North-Dakota-flat on flavor (sorry North Dakota, you didn't deserve that).  The crust is tough, chewy and literally difficult to swallow.  It's extremely difficult to bite through; think \"beef jerky\" or \"inedible leather\".  On top of that, it tastes like chewy cardboard with cheap, flavorless cheese and meat on top.    I've only had one pizza in my life that I thought was worse than this, and I involuntarily regurgitated that one a few hours later.  Yes, it's suitable for late-night, greasy sustenance, but let's not lie to ourselves: this is NO 4- or 5-star joint.  Not even a 3.  I refuse to believe anyone in their right, non-inebriated mind provides this \"Secret\" more than a 2, and even then, it would have to be about the magical journey of finding it.  For me, it's a sure-fire 1-star due to the horrible food, ridiculous gimmick, and worse value.",

Usually I don't remember pizza unless I've had a good experience with it but I definitely remember this place. The pepperonis were perfect, the cheese and crust were perfect. everything was perfect. I will come here next time in Vegas. The restaurant is kind of hidden. You have to walk through a hall to get there and it can be easily missed. There wasn't that much seating in the restaurant, but it was ok. Great pizza place!",

Take the escalators/elevator, make a slight left and the location is on the right hand side. If you see a big sitting area, you are at the right place. You just gotta go down that mini hallway and you are there.   As for the wait, I think I got lucky both times (Saturday night 6PM-ish before XS & Saturday 11AM-ish before Marquee Dayclub), I barely had to wait 10 minutes for my food. The only waiting I had to do was when they had to heat up my pizza.   As for the food it self, it's pretty good. It's big enough to satisfied my hunger before the club. They have a lot of different topping pizzas, and they make the pizza fresh every half an hour or when they run out of pizza. Although the last time I went, my pizza had so much oil I had to use some napkins to soak it up.   As for the price, it's cheap! Under 10 bucks for a slice! The only thing that sucks was the price went up a dollar within a couple of months (January 2015  $5, April 2015 $6), but hey! It's still under $10 :)",

After a night/early morning of binge drinking, we needed some carbs to soak up some alcohol. The \"Secret\" location wasn't hard for me to find since I vowed to be back. The simplest way to get there is get on the third floor and look for a pool table. And boom! Right across from that is the small corridor to the \"Secret\" location!    I guess we caught a break from the line being very long. 3am and it was smooth sailing. My cousin place two slices of the combination. I wanted  to try the cheese one only, but at this point my stomach could handle one slice. The service was so quick that we were in and out.  The crust was soft and crispy. The toppings of meats and veggies were covering the pizza slices. The cheese was stringy and gooey. A great sized piece to satisfy a drunken appetite.  If this was \"Fight Club\", a lot of people would be in trouble. As everyone should know the first rule of  \"Fight Club\". You don't speak of \"Fight Club\"! But, oh well!

This is our second time here this weekend, and after trying several different slices, this was definitely the big winner. The White Pizza speaks True to its name, having only white sauce, cheese and a ricotta herb cheese dolloped on top. The herb ricotta adds the perfect flavor to this pizza and i would get it again and again! Best part is it's open almost 24 hours so it's perfect for drunchies after hitting Marquee at night!

This ain't a secret.   Try to find it without reading, it will add to the lore of this place. BUT, if you need help..  HINT ONE, it's in COSMO.  The above is super vague, if you can find it with just knowing it's in COSMO, then hooray for you.  HINT TWO, it's on the 3RD FLOOR  Knowing it's in the 3rd floor should shorten your hunt.  HINT THREE, it's in the 3RD FLOOR OF THE EAST TOWER.  Ok, at this point, that is all you should know and try to find it yourself.  There really is no name for this place. It literally is a hole in the wall. You walk through this hallway with ambient light shining out, that you think is part of the establishment next to it (but it's not), and then at the end, you see a small space, with a few bar seats, some arcades, and a place to order your pizza. The paper menu you can grab, simply says \"PIZZA\" in the front.   The price is a bit high for pizza IMO. You will be paying $5-6 a slice. $30+ for a whole pie. Some have said this is reasonably priced in Vegas? I disagree. There are many affordable places.   With the pricing out of the way, the pizza is legit though. Thin crust, good sauce, cheese, and ingredients. It definitely tastes of a quality pizza. A pretty authentic New York style as some others have said. OH, I WASN'T DRUNK OR IN ANOTHER STATE OF MIND, so nothing was altering my taste. I bet this place has such a high review from people who came right after drinking and partying. Don't remember the price, and anything you eat is automatically great. lol  Like I said,  in the beginning. A solid 3 and a half stars. The pizza is legit good, but the price is a bit high, even for Vegas. I would go again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so. I recommend you try and find it yourself with little help, and experience it.  Keep in mind, there is no dining area to sit, etc. BUT, there are plenty of tables and seats right outside in the Cosmo to enjoy your pizza and people watch.",

I had the white pizza due to my addiction to garlic and I can't remember what my husband had, but I would guess two slices of the cheese.  I will admit the pizza was slightly greasy but you don't eat pizza when you are trying to be healthy.   The guys behind the counter were very friendly.  We chatted with them for a bit while we were eating.   We didn't go after clubbing so they weren't too busy, but I would call it a steady stream of people though for a tucked away location.",

Really cool place that makes you feel as if you've stepped out of the Cosmopolitan and into any hole-in-the-wall pizza across America. The pizza was great, but the real winner for us was the cheesecake. $4.50 for a giant piece that easily feeds two hungry people. There was no line when we went (around noon on New Years Eve). The ONLY complaint was there being nowhere to sit, but even that isn't a big deal since there is seating everywhere in the Cosmo.",

I guess they weren't kidding when they named it Secret Pizza.  When I found Secret Pizza on yelp, I bookmarked this restaurant. Suggested my girlfriends to go here during our vegas trip. We decide to go on Saturday night before marquee so we went around 8:30 pm. Got to first floor of Cosmopolitan and looked at the floor guide by the escalator. Looked for \"Secret Pizza\" but nothing. Scanned the board again and didn't see a word of pizza. I got slightly scared that maybe I had the wrong hotel in mind and asked the hotel employee and he joked that it's a secret pizza so it's a secret and he can't share the location. O_O I was one step before panicking and he told me it's on the third floor. phew.  Secret pizza is tucked away behind walls. Can only get to it if you walk into a narrow hallway next to some restaurant. No signs or anything what-so-ever so keep an eye out for a narrow hallway that makes you question where it is leading to! Barely any line at 8:30 pm. Too bad I was already too full from all the beer I drank but still took few bite of the pizza. Like everyone says, it's thin crust pizza with mountains of cheesy goodness. Sure, the pizza might turn out a bit greasy cuz of all the cheese but don't be shy. Just blot it with some napkin and brace yourself for some nice NY-style pizza. :D  PS. Their white pizza is the best. Treat yourself and indulge in the greasy goodness!",

Even when I am not staying at the Cosmo, I find myself there at least once during my trip for a slice...or 10.    You won't find any signs for this place but just follow the wonderful pizza smell down a long hall way on the third floor of the Cosmo near the exit of Marquee as well as restaurants, Milo and STK.  If you see a long line down a hallway, they aren't waiting for the restroom or trying to get into the backdoor of Marquee...it's Secret Pizza doing their magic...",

Thankfully the article I was reading also mentioned the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan and a random hallway.  As I was on the third floor i noticed an unassuming hallway with a pinball machine at the end.  At first I walked past it but after not being able to find any signage i went back and trekked down.  At the end was indeed a pizza shop.  For my lunch i decided to go with the pepperoni and sausage slice which cost $6.  The crust of this pizza was the star as it was crispy throughout which helped to overshadow the seemingly nonexistent sauce.  The cheeses were good though and the sausage was a nice little surprise since it was both spicy and tasty.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I enjoyed the slice that I had and later in the day learned that I could do a lot worse for a bigger price.",

Walking down the hall to a hidden gem is half the fun!  Then there is the fact that you can get a quality IPA on tap.  The wall of records is is incredibly cool, and the black & white tile fits so perfectly.  Pizza + secret + atmosphere + IPA = an easy 5 stars in my book.

You spend decades hearing about it being this great town where you can do anything at any time, but really, so much is closed down at night. Sure you can gamble and drink, but we needed sustenance.   Anyway, we wandered into the Cosmopolitan and wandered to their food court. The \"secret\" pizza place, down a magical tunnel lined with album covers, was a godsend. This wondrous spot, not found on any maps, was the only open eatery we found.   Picked up a slice of white deep-dish pizza ($9) and it was enough to share. It was a bit on the hard side. I'm sure with it being so late, it had been sitting around longer than it would have during the day. All the same, it tasted great.   All the stools were taken up, so Bran and I laid about on the vintage chairs they had in the food court common area. It was quiet and away from the hubbub and Axe body spray downstairs.   Some reviewers mentioned a long line, but at 1 in the morning, we were behind maybe three people.",

    "text": "No frills. No fuss. But some bomb pizza served on probably the best pizza crust I have ever had! The service was friendly. You can order pizza by the slice from what is already prepared, so the options are limited in that regard, but we did not have a problem with that at all! We got one regular cheese, one sausage and pepperoncini and one with cheese, on cheese on cheese (my fave by far)! The slices are a good size and for three slices plus two sodas (free refills if you want 'em), I paid $24.50. For pizza, perhaps a little pricey, but for Vegas, very reasonable. The sodas (and beer) are served in red solo cups which gives you an idea of the atmosphere. A hidden gem that I recommend. Hey, that rhymed! ENJOY, folks!",

They're constantly just baking them so if you're buying by the slice, your options will be whatever they have.  The toppings here are of a good quality so despite the Las Vegas prices, it's still not bad of a deal.  Perfect food for after partying (just hope you can find it if you're tipsy).",

    "text": "Lets say ..I am not a big fan of pizza..I eat it, I somehow enjoy it but you will never hear me say \"oh man I want some ZA\" ...but this spot is the bomb dot com. SOOOO simple, yet soooo good. How didn't they think about a spot like that somewhere else is something I don't understand. But the cosmo did a great job with the concept and the location.  If you ask employees..they wont tell you and deny its existant. I like that..kinda keeps the mood of its \"secretness\" and makes it more exciting. Then when you gt there it's a pizza , soda and beer place ..that is it. But man..it really doesn't need anything else!!  The price can get a little high, but the large pie is pretty big. The wait tog et your pizza cooked can be a little annoying specially if its packed like it usually is. This is the biggest down side for me, because I hate waiting , I hate big lines..but I do understand that sometimes for good food there should be some sacrifices made.  Seats are very limited...actually space is very limited so plan on either standing up or taking your pizza to go.Does it worth it?? For pizza fans def does..for me...well Ill wait if the line is little if not...ill just come another time.  This is a thin crust pizza , with plenty of flavor and character.Def recommending it to you guys . should I tell you exactly where it is?? Nah...Ill let you suffer",

It is toward the end, next to a cafe/bar? I can't remember what it was exactly since I was super excited to see the hallway! Walk down the long hallway with ads/posters on both sides of the wall. It will look like an arcade inside.   The pizza is really good. Of course not as good as the real NYC pizza but I love how crispy the dough is! The homemade sausage is pretty good as well! Can't complain about the sauce either! :) you should definitely give it a try if you're staying at the Cosmo or nearby!",

    "text": "My friends and I will forever thank Yelp for helping us discover this small pizza shop hidden in the upscale hotel of The Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas! New York style pizzza in Vegas, what more could you ask for?  The pizza is executed and prepared so well at Pizzeria. The ingredients are simple but individually are bold in flavors. I got to try most, if not all the ready-made pizzas and toppings they had to offer.  The first pizzas I tried were the pepperoni pizza and the plain cheese pizza. The large slices of pepperoni were perfectly salty and balanced well with the tomato sauce, cheese, and crust. The cheese pizza was rich and flavorful, but I thought it could have used a little more cheese.  The second time I came, which was the next day, I ordered the Ricotta cheese pizza and the  Pepperoncini (banana pepper) and Sausage pizza. Absolutely delicious, they nailed it when it comes to flavor combinations. The mild sourness from the pepper helped breakdown the saltiness from the cheese and just complimented the sausage real well. As for the ricotta cheese, it was creamy and rich which added flavor to every bite. Here's how I rate the pizzas:  Pepperoni & Cheese - 4/5 Cheese Pizza - 3.5/5 Pepperoncini & Sausage - 5/5 Ricotta Cheese Pizza - 4.5/5   After trying the pizza, I told a few of my friends and they went to try it for themselves and fell in love the same way I did. A lot of pizza joints can't do that nowadays! My only critique would have to be that the pizza was a little bit on the greasy side, but in my opinion, some pizza are just made to be greasy -- it helps add flavor!     If I could give one advice to the owner, it would to change the name to  Luigi's Pizzeria in order to reflect its more Italian roots! Also, they should have more signs because I had to ask twice from different employees at the hotel where to find the 'hidden' pizza place.",

    "text": "They say that time heals all wounds.  If you've ever been to \"Secret Pizza\", you'll know that time has a competitor. Pizza.  There are countless reviews and tips on Yelp, so I won't go into the boring details. You can easily find this spot at the Cosmo on the 3rd floor. It's unmarked, but the pictures in the Yelp listing can help direct you.  Be prepared for a line if you are going during nightclub hours. Drunk people love their food.  The pizza itself is fairly basic. You have a few options and a slice will run you about $5-6. It's simply delicious pizza. Greasy, but not too oily. Just the right amount. It's perfect.  My favorite has always been the sausage/pepperoni pizza with the italian peppers.   Take your slice and sit outside in front of STK on the chairs, especially at night. You'll have a front row seat to the Hot Mess Express from Marquee & other parts of the hotel.  After you experience \"Secret Pizza\", tell a friend. Let the legend of this hidden gem live on.",

It was good but not really anything special about it I got the white pizza and it wasn't fresh but still alright. Some people say the line is super long but not when I went. So my final verdict is that if you are staying at the cosmopolitan or a super close hotel you should go there. But don't do like I did and walk a long way just for the pizza",

It is loaded with white sauce, mushrooms, cheese, and more cheese on top. It will definitely punch your taste buds. The slice came out to be $8 but it was worth it.   The mushroom pizza was just a regular pizza. It was packed with garlic flavor and super thin. That slice came out to be about $5.   They heat up the pizza when you order it so it is nice and crispy when you eat it. Only downside is that there were mounds of oil on the pizza. I was not that sober to be health conscious so I was in heaven eating those two slices.",

I felt super heart-broken and regretted letting her go first and also I didn't think of a back up pizza flavor so I lowkey started to get anxiety from holding up the line, but then suddenly a pizza miracle happened. The pizza guy gave me a \"wait you know what I gotchu\" look and pulled out a fresh pizza - meatball ricotta. He said it was his personal favorite and swore I would love it and that was the best pizza advice ever been given. It was so good! I took 2 bites from my friend's white pizza and I have to say, meatball ricotta is way better. I saved half for later and it's just as good as a late night drunchie.   Not so secret Secret Pizza is the best pizza I've had in the west coast! It's not on any directory, but it's conveniently located on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan to fulfill your late night drunchies after getting turnt at Marquee. My friends and I went around 5 pm so we can have it in our room without risking getting lost trying to find it or having to wait for forever when we're buzzed and hangry. The pizza is New York style aka thin crust and big slices and will leave you wanting more!",

A slice is about 5-6$ depending on the toppings. I had the pepperoni one and also tasted the mushroom one. The best part was actually the crust! It was so crispy but not over cooked at the same time. The rest however was just ok... The pepperoni was super salty. Nothing special about the breading or the cheese.  It is one of the cheaper places you can find on the strip, but it's still quite expensive for some average pizza. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.",

Thanks to all you Yelpers, I found the place easily, but there really aren't any signs, including when you're up at the counter. It's just an obscure little pizza bar down the long picture lined hall.  The pizza was super good, and the service was good too like most places in Vegas. I liked the white sauce pizza.

Walking towards the place, all I saw was people walking the opposite direction with boxes of pizza. That's how I knew I was heading towards the rift spot.  Upon getting there, this place really isn't all that secret because there was a line out the door. So we stood in the line and my drunk self was doing calculations on my mind like \"it take each person about two minutes to get their pizza. There's 15 people in front of us so I will have to wait in line for 30 minutes before I can eat. IM HUNGRY AND NEED FOOD NOW.\" But it honestly didn't take that long at all, reality is maybe 15 minutes waiting. We made friends in line because we were all drunk and it was fun.  Ask for a box for our pizza and even my sober self would be this excited! Their boxes are awesome! I've seen it on some life hack interesting design video. The top of the pizza box is four plates if you rip it apart and the bottom allows you to store half a pizza in the Mose space saving way possible.   Back to food, I ordered a white pizza and a Sicilian.. both we're amazingly full of flavors. The bottom crust of the pizza was nice and crunchy but plain crust part was a bit too chewy to eat. It hurt my jaw.",

Now, the more mature drunken me would order the pie (whole pizza) in advance at marquee dayclub or nightclub an hour before I am about to leave the club or have someone in my group to do so if I am not coherent enough :). This way, once we leave the venue, all we do is pay and pick up our box of pizza and leave.  Compared to getting only a single slice, I thought getting the whole pie tasted better. One thing for sure is that, I know the pizza is fresh and hot whereas the single slices have been out on display for a while and not as warm.",

Tucked away on the top floor of the Cosmopolitan, we spent over half an hour trying to find it, as they don't include it on the list of restaurants in the hotel nor are there any signs pointing the way. We finally managed to find it and order. The pizza was amazing, probably the best I had while in Vegas. They had a white pizza that was out of this world it was so good, I highly recommend! The interior was really cute, with one wall being partially covered in dollar bills. The staff was very friendly as well. Despite it being hidden, right as we were leaving a huge mob of people showed up and made a line stretching all the way down the hallway. So it definitely gets really busy at times.",

    "text": "My friend had been yammering for days about taking us to a \"secret place\" for food, saying that it's the best.  On this mission, we were taken up and down, left and right through the Cosmopolitan, and we come upon this hallway with vinyl record labels lined on the walls that had no sign, no nothing, which you can easily mistaken for a hallway to a restroom. Once all the way down, the \"secret\" has been revealed that of a pizza parlor. Hm! This better be amazingly good!  I ordered the mushroom pizza, and was highly recommended to get it with meatball on top. It looked amazing, but right when I picked it up for a first bite, the pizza fell apart. Sad. The slice I had was probably too soggy and the crust was really thin that didn't even feel like it was there. However, that doesn't stop the fact that the pizza is absolutely delicious! Gooey cheese with tasty tomato sauce, soft and earthy mushrooms, and the meatball! Omg, the meatball was amazing! Super tasty, meaty, and flavorful.  Sure, the place is dark and dank, but who the hell cares when you're eating pizza THIS good.  I asked my friend what this place was called, and his reply, \"secret.\" That confused me. Because he's been saying \"secret, secret, secret\" for days, I thought he was still going that, but nope, he said this place is actually called \"Secret Pizza.\" OH! Neat.  I am hooked! One of the best pizzas ever. A must visit on my next venture to Las Vegas.",

They basically reheated the pizza in the oven, so it did not taste \"fresh\" just warmed up. I did like the sausage one but nothing mind blowing. Maybe a whole pizza from scratch may be better.",

Anyway, I've been here before when it first opened and I didn't even know it was a \"secret\" I wasn't into yelp so I didn't take down any notes to review the place. I decided to come back so I could yelp it real quick!  Pizza was alright. I tried the pepperoni with peperoncinis and the homemade meatball slices. The pizza was thin crust, I think? Kinda whatever. There was too much bread going on and not enough toppings!! I like my pizza loaded with toppings!! At first glance, I couldn't decide which slice to get..one had  more pepperoni and the other had more peperoncinis...why can't I just have the best of both worlds?! Well, I lucked out and the pizza guy knew I was torn so he gave me BOTH for the price of one. Score!! Also got the meatball one and it was good, could be better though.  Overall, pizza is nothing special, and you can skip it if anything. But if you want to go for the adventure of finding it, then be my guest!!",

It is secret because this place is hard to find; they don't have any directory to locate this place inside the Cosmopolitan. We found this place by asking bunch of workers around the area; so this is what Indiana Jones feels like when he is hungry and still want to find those artifacts. I love the concept of mysteriousness and lore to find the best pizza in Vegas. It is all worth the effort because not a  lot of people knows this place unless you watch food shows. You'll see bunch of portraits of celebrities and pop pictures before you enter  its secret lair :)  The pizza is all worth the find and the wait.. although it took at least 45 minutes to cook a 2 fresh from the oven New York style large pizzas. 8 of us devoured 2 large pizzas! We ordered the pepperoni with Italian sausage pizza and their famous white sauce pizza. The pepperoni/sausage pizza tasted good but nothing from the ordinary. However, the white sauce pizza what makes this spot set apart from others.   The white sauce pizza has a garlic and mozzarella base. The New York thin crust compliments the melt on your mouth flavor of its cheese. It is almost like eating chicken, but its not chicken but rather the mozzarella chunk on it.

You have to either know the secret...or just ask anyone around and they'll probably tell you haha. I mean, I would tell you in this review, but then I'd have to kill you. ;)  So let's just say that I love how lowkey but not lowkey it is. Does that even make sense? By that, I mean that one of the cool things about Secret Pizza is that it's not really trying too hard, it just is.   And what it is is delicious. You can order an entire pizza or just slices. I've tried most of the pizzas there and whatever you're feeling, you can't go wrong.   PS. It's 1000x better drunk. GO!",

The staff members are really friendly, even after having to deal with drunk people after the clubs close. They're very quick with their orders as well.

Eventually my boyfriend found a hallway of posters that lead into the pizza joint. There were a lot of people waiting in line but it moved quickly.  You can get pizzas by the slice or whole pizzas. By the slice prices start at $5.25, while whole pizzas start at (around) $28. Whole pizzas come with 10 slices.  I love New York style pizza. Basically, every time I eat New York styled pizza I think it's the best thing ever. Ha! So this was like I hit the gold mine and on the plus side, it wasn't too greasy either.",

The pizza is fantastic and the business is practically open from dusk till dawn. Lines and waiting times can be painfully long and stupidly unpredictable, but I usually come here after midnight and have never seen a long line in the wee hours of the morning. The only times I've seen seen very long lines were between 8pm-11pm. But that's prime time in Vegas. Everywhere is crowded and busy during that time.  You should definitely stop by if you're visiting Vegas and have a limited food budget. I highly recommend Secret Pizza.",

As I was trying to decide what toppings to order on my pizza slice I saw one with two types of meat already made and it looked good so I just went with it.  It was delicious.    They have boxed wine for $6 a glass.  I had to try it at that price.  It was very good and paired very well with the pizza.  If you are in Vegas and craving pizza then this is a must visit.",

    "text": "The secret is out!  Secret Pizza is on the 3rd floor next to the Blue Ribbon restaurant in an unmarked hallway.  You'll probably see the pinball machines from the outside and you'll know you're in the right place.  By no means am I a pizza connoisseur but I think it's pretty good.  I'm not sure how great the pizza actually is, or is part of it the hype and the excitement behind it.  Secret Pizza is a Cosmo must visit especially late night when your evening activities are winding down.  Usually this place is packed.  You'll definitely be waiting a bit. The line tends to move somewhat quickly but there can sometimes be a bottle neck when there are indecisive guests in line.  During one of my visits here, the workers kicked out a guy for being too intoxicated (and non responsive) when they would ask him what he wanted to order and he wouldn't answer.  Generally, the workers are really nice and they're there to help you with your food and drink orders.  Usually, they'll have a few pizzas ready to go and you can point out which slices you want.  They'll then heat them up in the oven for a quick couple of seconds.  I'm sure if you're willing to wait a bit you can customize the pizzas to your liking.  I like the sausage and pepperoncini pizza they seem to have there as a staple.  That's a personal favorite of mine. If you order the full pizza, they'll put it in one of those fancy boxes that you can tear apart and it'll transform into a smaller box in case you don't finish the entire thing.  It's surprisingly easy to tear apart as well.  Tip:  be careful when using the Parmesan or red pepper (there used to be garlic powder as well, but didn't see any this visit) shakers.  I got a hold of one where the lid wasn't screwed on tightly and that wasn't a fun pizza to eat.",

There are no signs and can be easily overlooked if you do not know what you are looking for.  It is located on the second floor through a hallway with lots of framed retro magazine covers and ads.  This little spot is worth looking for though.    The best thing there is their popular white thin crust pizza.  It's super garlicky with ricotta cheese.  It's heavenly for about $6 a slice or $28 for a whole pizza.  A slice was more than enough for me.  They come pretty large and are served fresh.  I also have tried their meatlovers one but nothing compares to the white pizza.  It is a must get.  Their menu is pretty basic.  There isn't much other choices besides pizza.  They have two options for salads but I wouldn't recommend that here.    The inside is tiny with only bar seating.  It can get pretty busy and the line can be pretty long.  It goes pretty fast I find.  The people working are usually really nice and I am always satisfied.",

    "text": "Love this place.  My first time here was by total accident, just curious what was down that hallway covered with old record covers.  So excited to see and smell the wonderful pizza they had over here.  They also have beer, cannolis, and cheesecake.  The pizza is priced affordably for where you are and what you get.  They have a little bar with some stools so you can eat inside there.  It is open late too so its perfect for that late night snack.  Love the pizza, may be my favorite in town.",

Because the line is.... out the door, at least when we went, it was like past 1AM and we stood in that long line because we were so determined to get this pizza.  In a sleep-deprived, just-got-back-from-who-knows-where state, I ate what seemed like a pretty better than expected pizza.  AND we got a whole pie, because if we're gonna stand in a line and wait for more than 1 hour, we better get a whole pie, forget a freekin' slice.  Actually, the slice of pizza tasted way better the morning after.  Cold.  Right out of the pizza box in the hotel room.",

    "text": "I'm thinking this is the cheapest thing you can buy here at the Cosmopolitan.   Another amazing recommendation from Kristen C. she said I had to try it after a long night of partying. It's $3-$5 dollars depending on the pizza and it's amazing!!! It's good when you're intoxicated and better when you're sober. It's a New York style pizza in Vegas!! Can't ask for anything better. I love a plain cheese pizza and this is one of the best cheese pizza I've had. Well worth my $3 and more. I also tried a white pizza with garlic parmesan, ricotta and mozzarella cheese YUMM.  I will say it's was a bit tricky to find, there isn't a sign outside and you have to walk through a dark hallway before seeing the pizzeria but if you can find it or flirt w/ a security guard to help you out (lol that's how I found it) then you'll be very happy when you do!!   Yummm, I'd love a slice right now!!",

    "text": "SOOOO Good!!!  Pizzeria is a tiny little pizza joint on the 3rd floor of The Cosmopolitan.  I don't recall even seeing signs for it.  Someone told us about it so that is how we happened to find it.    We first attempted to order on a Saturday night...well...Sunday morning after Marquee Night Club and were standing in line when I was plowed over by a very intoxicated Australian man.  After gaining my composure, he plowed me again.  Before I killed someone, I made the decision to come back later.  So my point here is...if you go late night, your experience may not be so pleasant as this place attracts the overly intoxicated/drugged.  My second attempt, which was late on a Sunday night/Monday morning, was much more pleasant.  The pizza guys aren't very friendly and I am pretty sure not one of them cracked a smile.  The girl who was taking orders, etc. ,though, was quite pleasant and tolerant of the late night clientele.  The pizza is delicious.  It is the thin crust, not overly greasy, cooked to perfection, perfect cut slice kind of pizza that is so rare to find!!!  Some of our crowd went back for seconds and to try different flavors.  I had the supreme and could not have been happier.  I will definitely be returning to Pizzeria for more pizza on my next visit to Vegas!!!",

After hanging out at the Chandelier bar, my friend took me to the Secret Pizza next to Marquee. We were there slightly before the drunken crowd was about to get out, so we didn't have a long line. But it was pretty awesome going down dark hallway and seeing a tiny pizza kitchen! They really have a great business going on, they make the pizza's pretty fast and knowing their main clientele will be hungry drunks, they charge $4 for a slice! Not going to lie drunk or sober, it's pretty delicious. The New York style thin curst cheese pizza was worth it! I don't like eating after a certain time but the pizza hit the spot! Definitely going back to this place.",

When asked whether they did chicken or beef toppings, they said they only did ham and salami and looked at me as if I were crazy!!  What kind of pizza place doesn't have a chicken or beef option???  Weird!  Note that this is not really an eat in place, just a take out joint - well worth it though.",

Just remember its on the THIRD floor, I got lost the first time walking around on the second floor, but thankfully, people were kind enough to guide me there.   The pizza crew here are friendly and seem pretty laid back. They greet you and help you quickly to get things moving. The atmosphere is pretty awesome. I enjoy the album covers lining the walls of the entrance way. There is seating inside the little pizza shop but its very limited. The pizza it self is okay, Its a big slice but thin...even with all the cheese and toppings. I highly suggest getting a whole pizza if you have enough people to share with or you can definitely try to eat it all yourself, you can do anything if you put your mind to it.   Overall, neat little spot to try pizza and check out if you are ever in the area and remember, THIRD FLOOR!",

However, my family insisted on getting the white pizza because it was their favorite when they were there for their last Vegas trip. Boy, I was not disappointed and the white pizza definitely lived up to its hype!  We ordered a whole pizza over the phone about 20-30 minutes beforehand, and it was ready to go by the time we arrived. The pizza was sliced into 10 large slices and was delightfully delicious with its garlic and different cheeses such as ricotta cheese. Between the four of my family, we finished the whole pizza in about 20 minutes. And then the next day, we came back for another whole white pizza!  If you can find the place, definitely try it out! The only downside is that I won't ever get to satisfy my craving for their white pizza unless I want to drive a round trip of 7 hours.",

About 6 years ago (early January 2011), I remember entering the brand new Cosmopolitan in search of the secret hallway (which was located in between the glass elevator and sushi place). Stumbling upon the vinyl album covered hallway for the first time was an \"only in LAS Vegas\" experience on its own.  Looking past the line up of pinball machines against the left wall..you see your prize.   WHITE PIZZA. The perfect combination of ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and olive oil. Pick up a slice (or two) if you're alone or live it up and buy the full pie to share. Honorable mention: Slice of meatball & ricotta. For the Sweet tooth: Try the cannoli!  Since that fateful day in January, my visits to Secret Pizza have been quite frequent. Whether its white pizza for lunch, dinner, or late night snack (somehow, despite whatever club I may have gone to..Secret pizza is always a \"close enough\" walk.)  As this place continues to grow in popularity, the line (especially for the night time crowd) gets longer and longer..but like many who stand in line with me, I will continue to wait in line as I know it'll be worth the wait.",

    "text": "After reading numerous reviews about this pizza I knew I couldn't miss out on this gem. Once I got into the 3rd floor of restaurants at the Cosmopolitan, I knew I was close. I read it was close by to STK so we asked the hostess in STK where the hallway was. It was across from STK near the glass elevator. Yay!   Once we got in the hallway it looked like the pictures. The hallway has music record covers on it. I knew I was getting closer. There was a short line (5 people) when I arrived at 3pm on a Thursday. The place is cozy inside. There were not many stools to sit down at and people stood up to eat. They have a few arcade games in here.  The pizza? So delicious. Big slices. It just melted in my mouth. The crust was just the right amount and the cheese was good. Warning: it is oily, but man oh man...it's so good. I had to ignore that fact.",

Just head towards where all the restaurants are and you'll see a hallway with vintage records that leads to this small little spot.  Our group of 4 arrived shortly after opening at 11:30 on Sunday and there was already a small line. People started filing in behind us shortly after and we were happy to get there early. Had to try the white pizza and I also got a slice with meatball and ricotta.  We took our slices and headed to a corner of the cosmo to enjoy them. Bread was perfectly crusty and chewy and the white pizza did not disappoint. My slice with meatball and ricotta was also super tasty and I was happy with my decision to get two. My bf, a native New Yorker and pizza connoisseur, said it was the best pizza he's had that's not from home. If you're in the cosmo, this is a must!",

The line is more manageable during the day and pizza is still amazing even sober! You can never go wrong with a classic pepperoni, but also recommend trying the ricotta sausage pizza. Overall great pizza.",

One of our friends didn't eat dinner, so he was hungry.  This was the reason why we were here.  I wasn't too hungry, but I don't know when will the next time I'll get the chance to grab a slice.  I ordered a white cheese slice and a pepperoni slice. It wasn't that good.  It was old and very chewy.  Nothing special, I'll be craving for.    Seating inside the Secret Pizza was limited and super-super dirty.  They don't clean up or wipe down the counter.  The trash cans were overflowing.   It's very disgusting to me.  I did see the typical college students spot, grabbing pizza and beer here.  It's probably the cheapest place to eat at the Cosmo.",

The pizzas here are by far the best pizzas i've ever had (and no, it's not because I was drunk lol). We got the original pepperoni pizza with veggies and the sausage pizza with ricotta cheese. Dayumm were they delicious. We brought some back to the room to eat, but loved the pizza so much we were considering ordering 2 whole pizzas. I also love that this place closes late; great place to stop by after the club/bar, or if you're craving food in the middle of the night, you can just walk down from your hotel room and grab a bite here.",

There's a N.Y./NJ simplicity to it and if someone blindfolded and stuck me at the entry way, I would tell you that I was probably somewhere on Church ave in Brooklyn. What makes it special is that they don't seem to be doing anything special. It's just a N.Y. thin slice cooked like any decent pizzeria would make it. I ordered a large cheese pie and nearly had a stroke when I saw how much it cost. I love the idea and the presentation and the pizza tastes really good. Its also cool to take pictures of and to talk about, but I can't spend another $30 on a pizza pie.     I'm going to recommend you visit Secret Pizza. It's worth a trip and the pizza is good and authentic. I defenitely had a good time during my visit and I got what I wanted here. I had a very good pie and for 15 minutes, I was transported back to Brooklyn. Nostalgia goes a long way and they use that to their advantage here.",

There's no sign outside the long hallway entrance, just a security guard in a suit. Seriously?? I guess it's all part of the allure of grabbing some \"secret pizza.\"  People say the line can get backed up during peak hours after the club but we went around dinner time and the line was alright. We ended up waiting around 20-30 minutes which was fine. We decided to split a white pizza, which was plenty for a group of 4 guys. The pizza was thin, came straight out of the oven (piping hot) and the dough was chewy. Their slices are huge and I'm glad to know that our pizza was made to order! There's plenty of feta cheese sprinkled on top of the pizza and I love how the cheese was melted. It was a tad on the greasy side though.  I'd recommend checking out Secret Pizza if you're around Cosmo and looking for pizza. It's a pretty unique experience trying to find a \"secret\" pizza joint.",

Slices with toppings were $5-$6, fountain drinks were $4, and whole pizzas, while fairly large, were over $30. I'd recommend it if you're wandering by, but not worth a special trip. Also, don't forget to use your Identity card here (Cosmo's player card) to earn some points.

After, one of my friends suggested this hidden pizza place that you basically have to find on your own..She stated that this pizza place has \"NY PIZZA\"..hmmmm being from NY it automatically flared a red flag.  I was a little negative about that statement but I decided to give it a shot.  We walked around barefoot (shoes in hand) and asked many security guards of where this place was and the response we got were fingers pointing in weird directions.  YES they DO NOT tell you exactly where it is, you have to find it on your own! (what a pain in the ass) I hoped this pizza was worth it for all this run around BS.  We finally found it and we were greeted to a line of people outside of a narrow hallway...GREAT!...but as soon as I saw the pizza pies lined up against the glass window like NY pizzerias are, I started to think positively of this whole situation.  They had white pizza, regular, pepperoni, sausage..etc.  I had the sausage and mushroom and a small soda, it came out to 5 something and change, ok close to an NY price.  Now the real test..took my first bite.....and YES it was freakin GOOD!  I swear I heard \"Dream Weaver\" play in the background..LOL.  The crust was crisp, sauce and cheese was just right, it wasn't greasy or soggy...ahh man! brings back memories!  I had ONE SLICE...what a mistake! I would get a whole pie next time.. It isn't better than NY pizza but I must say, It is as good as it gets!",

It took a little while to find this place since there are no signs, but since I was a little tipsy and impatient of just walking around, I kindly asked one of the security bouncers where it was and he pointed me right to it.   I feel like people would want to go to this pizzeria only because it's sort of a novelty - there's no sign, it's hidden in a long hallway with old school arcade video games, and you feel special when you know where it is since not many people do.   The style of pizza served is NY pizza - it's got that nice thin crust and large cut slices. The pricing per slice is very reasonable and they're open late for the after clubbing crowd to get their late night munchies.  Only downside is that you have to find a place to sit outside in the general area on some of the couches there - which can be a little dirty with remnants of pizza from the last person sitting there.",

It has no signs, advertisements, etc. You just walk down the hallway with all the pictures on the wall and viola! A pizza kitchen! You might also spot people coming from the \"hallway\" with paper plates lined with checkerboard foodpaper.   Excellent pizza, and at a good price, especially for Vegas. We had the pepperoni pizza and \"white slice\". Would highly recommend both. I wish I had tried the sausage and pepperoni! Enjoy!",

It's pretty simple - there are meat and vegetarian options. No, it's not the best pizza in the world, but where else can you get a slice of pizza for ~$5 between the hours of 2 to 5 AM after a night out? Like I said - it comes in clutch at any time. Drunk or sober, Secret Pizza is awesome. The line can get pretty bad, but it moves pretty quickly. It's not really a sit-down place, so you order, pay, and wait for your pizza to warm up in the oven.   Go to the 3rd floor of The Cosmopolitan and head towards the back. Once you see a walkway into the wall to the left of the elevator and in front of the pool tables, you have made it to Secret Pizza.   Trust me - everyone needs to come here because it'll probably be the cheapest and most bang-for-your-buck meal in Vegas.",

    "text": "I first tried this place a couple weeks ago after a late night in Vegas. It's hidden away down a hallway with no sign or advertisement to tell you it's there. The place has a old school feel to it. In the hallway, the walls are covered with old album covers. They also have arcade games and pinball machines. It's really small, so don't count on eating in there unless it's not too busy.   The line was pretty long when I went especially considering it was 2:00 am, but the pizza was worth the 15 minute wait.  I got 2 slices of pizza ($5.50 each). One had pepperoni and banana peppers and the other had white cheese. The pepperoni and banana peppers slice was good, but the white cheese pizza I think is the one everyone should try if they come here.  Overall, it's easy to see why people love this place: it's open basically all night, there's mystery surrounding it being \"secret\", and its old school theme is really cool. In my opinion, the pizza itself is above average, but not amazing. If this review was strictly about the pizza and the price, then I'd probably give them 3 stars. This is a place I do look forward to showing some friends and returning too next time I'm out late in Vegas. Try them out!",

If you can't find that, just go to the 2nd floor and if you hear a bunch of loud, drunk kids, or see long lines, you've found the spot.    You could buy pizza by the slice, or buy a whole pizza.  Whole pies will take around 15 to 20 mins while slices take a few mins as sometimes they warm em for you.  They have cheese, pepperoni, and a garlic white cheese which was my favorite.  Price wise, for the strip you can't go wrong as everything is so expensive on the strip.  Taste wise, its thin sliced and was above average to me.  I'm sure there are better pizza options, but for its location and price its pretty darn good.    There's no seats in the actual shop, but plenty of seating outside.

The pizza is expensive but they give you a good portion and the smell and taste is actually very close to the New York-esque pizza I'm continually searching for in Vegas.  There is not much space to eat (only a few counter and stools) so you might want to order a slice or pie to go and eat in the lobby of all the restaurants on the second floor of Cosmo.  Pretty much everyone who stays on the strip and digs pizza has heard about this place.

I am definitely a crust girl when it comes to pizza. Crust can make or break a pizza for me and this crust was killer! My brother-in-law doesn't like crust and I ended up eating all of his (oops!). The crust is nice and doughy - super thick - so if you're not a fan of thick crust this is probably not your type of pizza place.  We went in the middle of the afternoon for lunch and waited about 20 minutes for two large pizzas - I consider this a typical wait time for a pizza and it was well worth it. Plus there are pool tables right outside of the place so we shot pool while waiting.   It was a little crowded inside but this is definitely not a place that you are going to sit down and eat your pizza. You will definitely be taking it to go. There are plenty of places to sit right outside of the place but only a couple stools inside.   Only one bummer - they don't have pineapple for pizza. My favorite pizza is easily pineapple with pepperoni and it was a slight disappointment that they didn't have it.",

It is simple, cheap, and tasty pizza hidden away down what one might assume at first glance to be a hallway to a restroom. When you are on the strip it is hard to find something reasonable, when you just want a snack, especially if you are young and on a budget. This was one of many good ideas the hotel had for their guests, or in fact anyone who comes through and finds it.",

    "text": "I can see why people would love this place. This would probably be 5 stars, especially after the club.   It is located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo. There are no signs outside indicating that it is a Pizza place but it is unlikely that you'll miss it. Its basically right in front of you once you get off the escalator (coming from the 2nd floor). There is a long hallway with  pictures all along the walls that lead to the pizza shop.   When you reach the store, you can order a slice or a whole pizza.  Since there was 6 of us in our party, we decided to get a whole pizza. If you have a bigger party, I would recommend getting a whole pizza since a slice is at least $5. The whole pizza comes with 10 slices. We decided on a 2 topping pizza, Italian Sausage and Pepperoni - costing $31. Because we bought a whole pizza, the wait time to make it was about 20 minutes.   The pizza was nice and hot when we finally got it. There is minimal bar styled seating inside the shop, but as other yelpers say, plenty of seating outside in the Cosmo so we took our pizza and ate in the lounge area by the pool table. The pizza was good, but nothing SUPER special to me. It tasted like any other normal thin crust pizza.   I don't know that I would be back for another slice unless I was craving it in the very early AMs.",

I was looking for it and probably passed the hall 3 times without going down it. I finally found it after a late night hanging out at Book & Stage Lounge, I don't know if it was because it was 3:00 in the morning, I had 3 bourbons in me, or I hadn't eaten since 7pm the night before. But the pizza was heaven, I went for good old plain cheese, it's the easiest way to tell if its really good pizza, cuz it can stand on its own. Gooey, cheesy, nice sheen of grease over the top, crust was good for being in Las Vegas. prices were excellent. The staff was fun and friendly.  The \"pizza man\" scolded my hubby for picking up the pepper shaker before trying the pizza, I swear his accent was fake but he was entertaining, made the wait in line easier. I can't wait to go back. If thye keep up the good work I may not get as home sick for the east coast.",

Tasty, self-explanatory ingredients on both. Warmed up and served out of the oven similar to Sbarro's. Won't be going so far out of my way to grab a simple slice of NY-style pizza, but they've definitely earned a spot in the back of my mind should I stay at the Cosmo or wander through during the wee hours...",

There was a long line out the door of a nameless restaurant and from the hints that the yelp reviews and hotel staff, we pinpointed that this was secret pizza. This was our go to spot when we were in a time crunch 'cause it was in the Cosmo next to marquee and in our hotel! I tried the white sauce pizza and just a plain pepperoni with sun dried tomatoes. Both were everything i was dreaming of. Thin, flavorful and chock-full of carbs!   Pleas note, If you don't want something cheesy, skip the white pizza!",

It's tiny, with only four chairs, two TVs, and two pinball machines. We took a look down at the prepared pizzas. Two big slices of meatball pizza and two cups of soda came to $14.

Yelpers came through once again.  The pizza was off the hook at this little hole in the wall.  And when I say hole in the wall, I mean hole in the wall.  The place is hard to find.  The Cosmo does not list it anywhere on their signs.  We had to ask several people before we were guided in the right direction.  Its on the third floor of the hotel toward the back down a long hallway with no signs outside.  Just keep asking and you'll find it.  The pizza was really good and cheap.  Had a couple slices of mushroom and one pepperoni with a couple PBR's.  I'm assuming this is what NY style pizza is suppose to taste like.  The place is super tiny and can only fit like 10 people and they only had 3 stools.  But its meant to be a quick bite, not a sit down type of place.  This will really hit the spot if you're looking for a quick late night meal to hold you over.  Highly recommend it!",

The concept is cool, a secret pizza place hidden at the end of a hallway that's extremely easy to miss if you're not looking. (I didn't even know this place existed and I've eaten in Jaleo and DOCG right next to this place!) The hallway is fun to look at while waiting in line, as it's plastered with old  vinyl record covers.   I had the white pizza slice and another with ricotta and sun dried tomatoes. Both were very oily, and tasted like they had been sitting out for a while. The cheese was not stretchy, ooey, or gooey, but rather sort of dry. Also very salty.   Maybe I would have better thoughts of the food here if I hadn't come sober. But then everything tastes amazing after a few drinks.",

Just for the record, there were 6 of us so no, I wasn't about to consume 2 whole pizzas all by myself.  That would be insane... insanely delicious but insane nonetheless!  I tried the white pizza first and it was pretty freakin' delicious.  Great thin crust that wasn't soggy but actually crunchy.  The mozzarella and ricotta combination went very well together.  All in all, a very good pizza!  The pepperoni was next and it was pretty standard.  Nothing too life changing but the crust was still nice and crunchy.  The pepperoni was a bit too greasy though, which I normally don't mind too much but after a couple of slices, I had to dab some of the grease with a napkin.  The white pizza would get 5 stars... the pepperoni... 4 stars... if I could give 4.5 stars then I would, but I think a 4 is pretty fair.",

I've been here twice and both times I was treated to high quality pizza.  The first time, there was enough of us that we opted to get a whole pie.  We got 1/2 white sauce w/ mushrooms and 1/2 red sauce combo.  They make it fresh when you order it, so there needs to be an element of patience.  About 15-20 min later, we got a HUGE box that wouldn't even close because the pizza was too big.  It was DELICIOUS!  I loved the super thin, super crispy crust.  I especially liked the White Pizza...creamy with just the right amount of garlic.  The second time, I went for a slice of the White Pizza with susage.  Again, it was YUMMY!",

We probably waited a good 15 minutes until we were able to order. I asked the guy over the counter what does he recommend or what's the most popular pizza that people usually order here and he said the White Pizza. So I ordered one slice and it was delicious! It was a bit pricey $5.25 for a thin slice pizza but it was pretty worth it at that time. I think it's a better deal if you order by the pie but it does take awhile for them to make that where as when you order by the slice its already made.",

Hidden at the end of a narrow hallway inside of the Cosmopolitan (I'd tell you exactly where, but then I'd have to kill you),  Secret Pizza serves up THE BEST slices you'll find on the strip.  No matter how long the line is, the service is quick and speedy. The cheese pizza has an explosive cheesy flavor that is seasoned to a degree that I've never tasted eating a simple slice of cheese pizza. Not only are the flavors of the cheese and sauce on point, but the crust is equally delicious. It's crispy and soft in all the right places. If Secret Pizza slices were a woman.... they'd be the perfect woman.",

I chose to get the white pizza . It looked plain but it is soo good! It had a nice garlicky taste to it. I washed it down with a cola ....delicious!

    "text": "I'm not good at keeping secrets, especially when it comes to food. But I'm gonna try my best in this review.   Secret Pizza is a small joint, located down a long, secret hallway lined with music record covers on the third floor of the ___________hotel. Since SP is not listed on the hotels website or in their directory, nor do they have any signs indicating they are even a buisness, they can be hard to locate.   Since SP is open till the wee hours of the morning, most people usually stumble in here in the early AM to cure their drunken munchies. Not me though. I stumbled in here right when they opened at 11am to cure my I just woke up and I'm hungry as hell munchies. All they serve here is pizza and beer. Simple. Delicious. You can buy your pie whole or by the slice. These are the slices my wife and I bought;  1 white pizza slice <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=24ppCiDbltVR9nt4spAUFQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQp...</a> 1 sausage & pepperoni slice <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=UGqPkyYuVIsLsjIN-UaEkg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQp...</a> 1 sausage & Pepperchini slice <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=AwEEKS68Y2WnPRDIJYzHNg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQp...</a>  Since we got there right after they opened, each slice was just coming out of the oven. After waiting a few minutes to let the huge slices cool, I remember my girl Michelle T's warning about burning my mouth, my wife and I dug in. All three slices were great. They had lots of cheese and toppings, flavorful sauce and a nice, crispy crust. At $5 a slice, this is a great spot for a quick, tasty meal.   If you can find SP, you definitely need to check it out. Just look for this hallway <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=JHsPAfv3yu3RrFNFO9qzFg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQp...</a>",

On the third floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel there is no sign for Secret Pizza, just a hallway lined with Italian-American singer's LP's that lead you to the pizza promise land.  It is the best pizza in Las Vegas and there is no debate about that. Dollar for dollar this is the best meal in town.  The space is small and there are only a few stools to sit at but this pizza was made for standing. They are constantly pulling out fresh pies to serve by the slice, or you can order your favorite toppings and they'll whip it up for you.  I got the sausage and pepperoncini, which was right out of the oven and then had them throw some meatball on an existing pepperoni slice to reheat.  They were both outstanding but the sausage won out because of its freshness and spiciness. I will be getting that combo again.  When you come do what you will, just know that if you want to taste the True genius of this place get whatever is freshest out of the oven.  My girl got the white Sicilian square, and because she loves me so much she allowed me to sample. Pretty fantastic.  Dig in and don't let go!  Secret Pizza you get the FlavorBoner trophy on this trip.  I'll be wrapping my teeth around you soon, just not during nightclub hours as I have heard the line is way too insane.  BTW....  When at the Cosmopolitan Hotel, if it is a weekend or holiday, go to the Chandelier Lounge on the main floor. They have a band called MARK and The Martinis and they are excellent. The lead singer embodies all that is classic Las Vegas; he sings, he jokes, he interacts with the patrons. He does Sinatra, Dean and Sammy proud.",

They have the standards, cheese and pepperoni, and deliciously greasy sicilian pizza.  A slice and a drink will cost you around  $6, so it's definitely a steal.

But I suggest that you order it ahead of time cus the wait for a whole pizza is more than 10 minutes.   But the workers are super cool, the location is awesome, ON THE 3RD FLOOR OF the cosmo towards the shops and restaurants sign and just look out for a wall full of records like a collage almost and you'll see it. Or just a bunch or ppl eating pizza you can just ask them. Hahah but the pizza is bomb.   The end",

I wandered over, looked at all the signs in the casino, no pizza places were listed.   Ask a guy at the info counter and he told me to head up to the third floor.   Wandered around the third floor for a while seeing nothing, stopped a guy working and asked where this mystery pizza place was.     He pointed down the hall and said \"go to the right, hallway with all the pictures, you'll smell it.\"    The line the was long and the smell was amazing.   Waiting in the hallway watching people pass by with slices was torture.   Got to the front, as huge, deliciously looking pizzas were being taken out of the oven.  Freshly made for us to take slices from   One slice of cheese and one meat lovers.   My god, this pizza is just good.    I'm a CA chick with a love of good NY style pizza and this place brings it.   I'll never go to another place for pizza again while in Vegas.     My only tip is, call a head and order a whole pizza.   The wait can be long (so worth it for a whole pie) and trust me, you'll want more later.",

I was with a big group of people and Trina D recommended this place. So we went... with over 700 reviews... Secret? It's just hard to find :D  PIZZAS: This is greasy stuff but also DELICIOUS.  Two whole pizzas - $50 (one white pizza and one half mushroom/half pepperoni).   Sooooo good! I loved the white pizza because of the flavors. The mushroom was also addicting tho. It was just really good!  SIZE:  No room to sit but they did have video games. Fun stuff. Donkey Kong.  But you sit in their waiting area  Why 4 stars? The WAIT was killer. It took close to an hour to be done and we had hungry drunks and people sobering up. I was fine. I was just hungry :P  Overall... good stuff. :D",

I came here one night after CES for dinner and couldn't figure out what I wanted to eat so the driver suggested that I try secret pizza.  I walked around for a while and couldn't find it so I asked one of the hosts at another restaurant.  The place sort of reminded me a bit of pizza my heart, where the pizza is already made and baked.  They ask what slice you want and then they heat it up in the oven.  The pizza tasted good and the novelty of finding this place was just great.  I'd be coming back when I'm near the Cosmo.",

Even after stuffing my face at Planet Hollywood's buffet, I had to grab a slice of the white pizza here. Luckily the white pie was the freshest one on the counter. It took no time at all to order and I only had to wait a few minutes for my slice to heat up in the oven.  As an east coaster I've eaten tons of NY pizza and its imitations... And this slice was up there with the best. If only the bottom of the crust were slightly more blackened and cracker-like would it be the real deal.  That being said this was awesome and hands down the beat slice I had in Vegas.",

On the third floor there are pool tables and lounging chairs too so you can lounge around and enjoy your pizza.   My friend and i shared the white pizza, which was AMAZING and delicious. We also shared a sausage pizza with green peppers and pepper jack cheese. That was amazing as well. I devoured the pizza and probably burnt the roof of my mouth since I ate it so fast while it was hot, but it was well worth it.

    "text": "Great for an after clubbing experience.  My group and I had gotten back to our room early at Elara after clubbing, and we all realized that we were down for some food... Where to go? SECRET PIZZA!!! So we hopped over to the Cosmopolitan and searched for the hole in the wall.. it's not on the directory, so you gotta know where you're looking. Just ask any drunkards walking around with slices of pizza. Anyway, we found it no problem, not a newb, but HELL... this is the first time I waited in a long line for it.  Oh and you gotta have some skills blocking people off because there are mad line cutters.  I was able to stop on chick and her friends when i realized she thought we were drunk and could slip by us with \"our friends are up ahead\". Gotcha. Although she was cool and joined us later at blocking off the other douchebags that tried to get through. Some blocked, some got through.. gotta choose your battles.  oh yeah, the food.. bomb.... make sure you sprinkle parm cheese, red pepper flakes, or that green herbstuff(dried parsley flakes?) onto your pizza for extra an special zazz.",

    "text": "I've been here once and if no one showed me where it was, I wouldn't have found it. It really is a hole in the wall kind of place, but that doesn't make the food quality any worse. It's actually really good for a pizza joint. The only problem is the place is slightly expensive, but totally worth it and being in the Cosmopolitan I wouldn't really expect anything less.   It's about $5 per slice, but the slices are pretty decent. I like the white sauce pizza, but they do have the regular red sauce. They have a wide range of toppings, but I usually get sausage or pepperoni but sometimes a combo too.   Once you order they throw the slices in the oven to warm it up a bit so you do have to wait a little bit. So it does come out hot and you'll have to wait a little bit for it to cool down. When my friends and I went, there wasn't a line at all, but it blew up pretty quickly right behind us, which was surprising.   It's a pretty good NY style pizza, I'll definitely be going back soon for sure for some more pizza.",

    "text": "**3 1/2 stars**  IMHO this place is overhyped. I ordered a regular cheese slice, and my two friends shared a white sicilian.   The supposedly \"new york style\" cheese slice: Decent slice? Yes. New York style? Not so much. The cheese was good. It had a complex flavor, a little sharp, and cooked crispy. The crust left a lot to be desired. It was a little hard, chewy, and maybe a little stale (to be fair, it was midnight, but still... c'mon it's Vegas). The sauce was fine, but not enough. Hmm... size-wise, a small slice, not worth the $4.50 Overall: Meh...slightly above average. Hence, the 3 1/2 stars.  The White sicilian: A much more subtle and delicate slice, slightly sweet also. Different white cheeses blended gave a nice flavor. Little islands of good cheese were sweet and refreshing. The crust was soft, spongy, and very thick. It reminded me more of a loaf of focaccia bread. Not exactly a new york style Sicilian, but good. I would give this one 3 stars, only average.  The condiments bar: A new york style condiment counter with oregano and garlic powder, in addition to the typical crushed red pepper and parmesan. I appreciated this, it's nice to have.  The atmosphere: First of all, it's really really hard to find this place. We had to ask four staff members through what seemed like an endless maze and multiple floors. The pizza place itself is a little hole in the wall pizzeria down a long tunnel hallway, which instantaneously transports you from the Cosmo glitz to a no frills NYC pizzeria (ok a fake, touristy, manufactured NYC pizzeria). There's only one counter bar to eat on inside. So, we chose to port our pizza to the retro glam seating area right outside (back into the Cosmo Glam world).  Price: $4.50 for a slice is ok at the Cosmo, but no New Yorker in their right mind would pay that much, especially for such a small slice. (Ok, Ok I know this is Vegas...but YOU try this small slice, and then tell me if it's worth the price).   Bottom Line: The pizza is ok, not worth the schlepp though (or the price for that matter). I would come back if I'm drunk and hungry after midnight. I have a feeling it's good drunk food. *wink*",

Located in an unmarked hallway next to jaleo on the third floor of the cosmo, this place is tiny with no seating, a standing bar area and a couple of old school arcade game machines.   They had a fair selection of pizza. Slices weren't big.  I went for the pepperoni even though they said their white pizza is the most popular because I'm not a big fan of ricotta.   For 5 dollars a slice.. And these are relatively small slices, I thought it wasn't worth my money. Don't get me wrong it was good though. The crust is very thin and crispy and I loved it, but I feel like the location uped the price so much. My slice only had three pepperonis on it. Cheese was decent and kind of stringy.  Also, they don't have water cups. You have to buy water, beer or soda for a drink. A soda is 4 bucks which is a complete rip off.   Ps the games cost 50 cents a play and you can get change at the counter.",

    "text": "3.5 stars and not worth the hype in IMO. I've been here before a few years back, and I recently came to try it again.   If you're stuck at the Cosmo and don't feel like venturing out too far or just ended your ratchet night of clubbing at Marquee and you're dying for some pizza/post club grub, then yes, by all means go here. It's located on the third floor down a hallway of record labels (next to Jaleo). They have a few bar style counters and a couple of stools, and the rest of the people usually end up standing and eating or taking it to go. The pizza itself is good, especially the pepperoni. I like how the dough remains crispy and crunchy and doesn't get soggy at all. They have this garlic seasoning that you can sprinkle on your pizza, and it really enhances the flavor. I also tried a slice of their veggie pizza and sausage with pepperoncini, but the pepperoni was my favorite.   A slice of pizza goes for about $5 a pop, more with additional toppings, and a whole pizza starts at about $30. Soda is $4. I wouldn't say the pizza prices are outrageous, because the pizza is decently sized (about the size of a Costco pizza). You could say it's all about the experience here, but especially for Vegas locals, I think convenience plays a big factor. I don't know if I would want to come back again having to go through the Strip traffic, parking, up the elevators, and possibly have to wait in line just for pizza :/",

At certain hours, it's just always open so you don't really see the wall where it looks like a secret door. It just looks like an open hall way.  Definitely recommend their white pizzas (were super bomb) but in general, this place is a pretty typical pizza place but very expensive (well I guess in Vegas it was normal priced). We bought 4 slices with 1/2 ingredients it was around $30-$40 bucks? The really charge a lot for extra ingredients so just keep that in mind. if you have a big party and you only need 1 or 2 ingredient, it's a far better deal to just order a whole pizza.  Definitely worth checking out, especially after clubbing and some alcohol if you have the drunchies.",

It's just regular pizza that you would pay a dollar in the streets of NYC or jumbo slice pizzas in Adams Morgan DC.    Staff - the person who took the order was efficient.  As for the cashier? He hated being there yet reminded us about paying tip for two slices of pizza.  If anything, I would rather tip at McDonalds since there is a lot more moving hands than this joint.   Price - one Dixie cup soda costs $4... I get it... It's Vegas but at least provide free fountain water? Okay, sorry I guessed I am asking for too much.  One bottle of water, one soda and two slices of pizza cost about $22.  I got better service, food worth the price and unlimited drink (including free water) at in & out.    Suggestion - have a staff who can focus on cleaning the area.  When I went yesterday, there were empty boxes of pizza piled up, empty paper plates and napkins everywhere.  I saw some customers throwing the trash away so they can squeeze a space to eat.    It was a disappointing trip and it was surprising at the lack of service and cleanliness considering this restaurant is located inside The Cosmo.",

    "text": "I'm not a pizza person, but this pizza was amazing. One slice was $6.50, which was about standard to other pizza prices in town. The slices are large, and they have a good selection of pizza options. You can also order an entire pizza, but that takes 30-45 minutes. If you opt for a slice 1-2 slices is enough to fill you up. They had about 4-5 different pizzas to choose from, ranging from standard cheese and pepperoni to variations of meats and veggies.   This is a great spot for a quick bite, as seating is very limited inside, so most people get it to go or sit outside in the casino area.",

The reviews are accurate, pizza is greasy (duh, it's pizza), there's no seating (5 stools tops, but it's a quick-bite kinda place, go walk the strip, you're in Vegas!), cheap (each slice is under $6), and the wait is so long (I would wait an hour for a slice so 5 stars!!).",

My bf and I got the mushroom pizza and were still pretty hungry afterwards so we went and got the meat pizza as well. The pizza is pretty thin which I like and it's pretty good. The price is at $5 per slice which is pretty pricey but that's to be expected everywhere in Vegas so that's not such a big deal. Overall, I would definitely come back here if I was craving pizza, especially late night pizza because they're open pretty late (or should I say early). Definitely worth a try if you're in Vegas and venturing to cosmopolitan, or if you're clubbing at marquee and have the drunchies after leaving the club.",

I came here 2 days ago and I am still thinking about how delicious my pizza was!  Disclaimer - it might have been \"heavenly\" because I was drunk, but my sober friends tell me it was as delicious as I thought it to be.  If the cheese pizza was that delicious, I had to take a bite from my guy's sausage and mushroom (that's what she said). The sausage had a nice pepper kick. It was probably one of the best pizza's I've ever had in my life.  Tip -  You might as well order 2 slices if you're going to wait in this line. This pizza is so damn good!",

I am led to believe that most reviews here were written by those who did not have a 100% sober experience of the pizza (since it seems that this place is frequented by post-clubbers of Marquee). I would probably agree if I were in their shoes as well.  We swung by for a quick bite early Saturday afternoon before hitting up the casino. The place is not easy to find! We had to consult yelp photos to get an idea of where it's hidden. The place is really small, with very few seats. We noticed that most people take their pizza to-go and sit out in the open areas of Cosmo to eat.  Slices are expensive ~$5! The toppings are really limited (usually 1-2) by which types of pizzas they have out at the moment. The line moves relatively quickly, but the pizza is fairly cold by the time you get it since it has just been sitting out. They are pretty hefty in size -- just 1 slice can be filling. I was pleased that the crust and dough throughout were not soggy at all, even if it was thin. Otherwise, the pizza tasted pretty average and most definitely overpriced.",

As a matter of fact, it's just a nondescript hallway with a pinball machine at the other end. We noticed a few people walk in and out. Sometimes with a slice of pizza or without but smile on their face.  We were like, \"What the hell?\" Curiosity got the better of us and we ventured down that dim hallway which is covered with vinyl album covers. Lo and behold, it's a pizza place!! White tiled walls. Marble counters to stand or sit on the very few stools.  Order by the slice ($5 and up) or a whole pie ($30+). Pabst Blue Ribbon beer is $5 a red Solo cup. IPA is $7. Only buy the soda if you are super thirsty: $4 a Solo cup. That's as bad as Disneyland, if not worse. Maybe that's a standard Strip price.   This time, I got a White Pizza slice and hubby and I split a Cheese pie.  OMG the white pizza is sooooooooooo gooooooood! Yummy mozzarella and ricotta cheese on sauceless crust.  Then came the cheese pizza, hot out of the oven. Crispy, chewy crust with tangy tomato sauce and the perfect amount of mozz cheese. Yummy, gooey cheese. Heaven in a cardboard box.  Try it. You'll love it.",

Yeah that is what I heard in the background as I took my first bites. Seriously excellent tasting. I even finished the crust which Is something I never do.  Pricey? Yes. Worth it. YES! A large pie will run you about $20.  The only reason I deducted a star is because there is no seating available, which would be cool if they did. I personally don't like to eat standing up.

Give some props to the pizza makers. They make a good pizza pie. There's some quality ingredients for what you pay for.  If you're around the Cosmopolitan and want to fill up without breaking the bank, definitely check this place out. It's hidden up in the 3rd floor through a hallway behind the pool table area.",

Okay okay, maybe the moniker is because the place is unmarked, tucked away down a hallway next to a sushi joint, and you really will miss it unless you're looking for it. But it's still the worst-kept secret in the Cosmopolitan.  It's thin-crust (but NOT crispy) pizza and for slices, you're limited to handful of choices - cheese, pepperoni, and white pizza. You have more flexibility for toppings if you order a whole pie, but beware the wait. It took us upwards of 35-40 minutes for two pizzas, and save for a half-and-half topping on one of them, we didn't really order anything complicated. I was, however, extremely grateful for the FREE WATER!  The white pizza is the standout here. So much garlic and olive oil that it will leave your paper plate soaked. It was a little on the soggy side because of all of the oil, but at 2am, it's exactly what the doctor ordered. If you're wearing insane heels and you've just finished a night of going big at one of the clubs, you will want to sit on the couches outside of the place to relax and eat.  There is also a Donkey Kong arcade game inside the place. It's a great way to pass the time, but beware the Kong. It will suck you in, beat you down, frustrate you, tease you, and leave you with a hole in your heart. Have fun.",

After all the hype from my friends and seeing the huge line, I told myself it was worth it but was quite disappointed in the end.  After a long night, a group of us decided to come here around 3 in the morning. We were faced with about an hour long wait among the crowd of drunk and hungry party-goers. The slices are all laid out and there's plenty of employees and ovens for them to fill. I still don't understand why the line is so ridiculously long.  I ended up getting a slice of white pizza with mushrooms and sausage on it. Nothing extraordinary here. Cheap piece of dough, scattered pieces of meat, and barely any substance. Honestly, it tasted like it came out of a frozen pizza box you get at Grocery Outlet. I've had some amazing NY style pizza. I've even had out of this world vegetarian NY style pizza, which is rare for me. Secret Pizza just didn't cut it.   What makes it worse is it's $5 a slice. I know Vegas can be expensive, but that's probably the most expensive slice of pizza I've ever had.",

Once there, they had several types by the slice (you can also order a whole pizza to go), and you just point to what you, they throw in the over to make sure its hot and then pay and be on your way.

Second time around was after a Yelp event. I was not hungry, but after all the talk about the pizza I caved and had a piece. No regrets because the white pizza is a must try. Garlic sauce, ricotta cheese, and mozzarella is always a great combination. In fact, I wish I never went to the Spoon and spent that money on two of these pies.   The crust is perfection. I am selfish and go for the dark pieces because that is where the magic lies. That crunch still replays itself as I am writing this.  As always, come with friends, because good food should always be accompanied with good conversation. Sit outside by the pool table for comfortable chitchat and forget about it.",

This is a must try for anyone staying Mid-strip, or on the strip for that matter. Enjoy, I did!!",

To find this \"secret\" place, we did have to be guided to the location by a hotel security guard....who would have thought a long hallway would lead to this \"secret\" spot?!??!

We were told that typically, the line is super long and it could take 20 mins or so before we get to eat.  Lucky for us, we did not have to wait long.  The pizza slice is about $5.50 a slice, and additional topping cost $1 more.  A whole pie (big one too), is $27.

The downside to the secret pizza is the location. It's got to be a secret because the place is tiny. It's hard to stand in there. It has a TV which is nice while you are waiting, but it sucks as it's an incentive to keep people in there as well. There's not much room for much. Plus, the cheese and pepper flakes were running dangerously low and there wasn't a napkin to be found. It's hard to bother the staff as well as there's just like two people there and there is always a line. Regardless, it's not too bad otherwise.  Secret pizza. Hard to find, worth the trouble.",

    "text": "I LOVE SECRET PIZZA. When it's delivered to me in the hotel room, when I have to stand in line, or especially when there's no line at all.  Obviously, it's not so secret anymore & the price isn't exactly \"inexpensive,\" but not much is expected when it's located in the Cosmopolitan in the middle of the Vegas strip.   The white pizza is delicious, the mushroom olive pizza is delicious, and the pepperoni sausage pizza is delicious. A great greasy way to begin the night before drinking (to help with the getting too blacked out drunk) or to end the night (to soak up the alcohol!).   Definitely gets a little bit used to finding this place though, located in between two restaurants through a skinny little hallway filled with frames of records. The place is your typical over the counter pizza place.. but better.",

    "text": "I was very determined not to review Secret Pizza until I've had this place sober!  Always had a little doubt about this place since I've only been here after a night at Marquee.  I always remember it being awesome (or whatever I can remember of it) and all of my friends love this place.  Came on a Tuesday night since I was in Vegas for work.  As expected, sorta empty and just two guys working in the back.  I went with the White Pie while my coworker went with the sausage.    After it was heated up, my White Pie looked as bomb as I remembered it.  In fact, it tastes even better than I remembered!  Creamy, garlicky, and cheesey.  I don't remember it being as garlicky as it tasted but it was great.  You can even add some garlic powder, which I did since I'm a huge fan of garlic.  Added some parmesan and sprinkled on red pepper to give it a bit of kick.  I tried a bit of the sausage but the tomato sauce and the cheese didn't stick to the pizza so it ended up being this gooey mess, but so good.  I did notice that my slice of White was smaller than all the other pizzas there... meh.  Glad to say that when sober, this place tastes just as good, and for the the next time I'm here after a night at Marquee, I know I'm eating a good piece of pie!",

    "text": "Three can keep a secret if two of them are dead.  Okay, I would only maim someone over this pizza... not actually kill.  To tell the truth, I wasn't expecting much when I laid eyes on boxes and boxes of this pizza floating down to the first floor of the Cosmopolitan, feeding hungry oafs watching the Super Bore game. Yes, I was one of the oafs trying to stay awake and hoping the game would pick up - shit, I was hoping that Elway (sitting in attendance) would jump in and take over for Manning.  Anyway, the pizza looked a little \"blah\" and the pepperoni/sausage looked a little grey. Although, I now think it was just the lighting in the Chandelier Bar, where we were posted up.  After the friend and I shared a burrito from the mall across the street, and some very pricey \"street tacos\" from China Poblano (on the 2nd floor) - 3 dinky tacos for $16, I volunteered to go in search of this secret pizza place... why not? All the other oafs seemed to really enjoy this pizza.   I will give you exact coordinates to find this pizza joint: 36.1100 N, 115.1753 W.... or just take the escalator, near the Chandelier Bar, up to the 3rd floor, make an immediate left off the escalator, stroll a few paces past the other restaurant, and veer to the right down the non-descript hallway which appears to be designated for employees only, or passage to purgatory. Tucked away is a little door to some pretty damn tasty and reasonably priced pizza. It's a tiny little spot, smaller than a Kardashian closet - no sitting area, just a couple of small bar tops where you can stand and scarf down.  They sell pizza by the slice, whole pizza, and some kind of obscenely delicious looking fat/chicago-style pizza (but, you have to get your timing right to get your hands on one of these slices - may even be a special order thing). You can also add more toppings to whatever slice you choose. I nabbed a couple of pepperoni/sausage with bell peppers for myself and friend. Damn, I wished we knew about this spot earlier in the day - would have ordered a whole pizza. It was very, very tasty. Can't believe I wasted good $ on sub-par Chinese/Mexican tacos.   I highly recommend this spot not only because the price is right, but this pizza is actually worth maiming someone over.",

A large group of friends and myself rented out a suite upstairs for a bachelor party. We put an order in for 3 pies around 6:00pm, they inform me they should be at my room in 45 minutes. 7:00pm rolls around and I give them a call. They say the pizzas are on their way! 7:30pm comes and no pizza. I call back, they say the pizzas are on their way! 8:00pm comes and no pizza.  Maybe I should try giving them a call tomorrow or perhaps next week and see if the pies are still on their way.",

Located on the third floor of Cosmo, there is no sign that says pizza, just look for the walkway across from STK that has random celeb pics framed. This is a Togo only pizza joint, so don't expect to sit around with friends and eat. I think I saw 3 chairs but I think they were only there for those that were waiting to pickup their phone orders.   Ok, so the pizza was delicious. Thin slice, with thick crust, basic toppings- cheese, pepperoni, veggie, I believe they even had a pesto pizza. If your looking to pick up a whole pie, phone ahead.  I ordered two slices and paid somewhere around $10, well worth it. Can't wait to go back. I love good, fresh pizza with real cheese and sauce, so this place met all expectations.",

The service here is great and friendly but it's not like this was the best pizza I ever had.  You can order individual slices or a whole pie and you can even get 2L bottles of soda.  I had the veggie which was pretty good and the white pizza which was tasty but it was a huge greasy mess since its basically garlic oil and ricotta cheese.  The oil was literally dripping off the pizza and while its garlic flavored its also not very appetizing when it cools down from pipping hot.  This place is pretty darn popular so I think they should change the name to \"was secret' pizza (I kid).  This is an experience you can't skip if you're visiting Cosmopolitan :)",

Not too much sauce and good flavor. Semi soggy first bites lead to a crispy outer crust.   The white pizza was good, but not great. I was hoping for more flavor and it was good but not very flavorful.  (We have a by-the-slice pizza place back home that I'm partial to- they do a pesto pizza that is out of this world! I think all pizza joints need to have one \"special\" pizza that is stellar...)  We only had to wait 15 minutes in the long line to order and the guys working were very nice. Definitely check it out if you haven't!  They offer fountain soda in red cups, or a liter for $8 to go.",

Walk through a hall filled with pictures of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, etc. and you'll find one of the best slices of pizza you'd ever have in Vegas.  I usually like to keep my pizza real simple: either margherita or pepperoni. My friend wasn't hungry but we both got 2 slices of pepperoni pizza anyway. We got our food pretty quickly. My friend thought the shaker he grabbed had parmesan cheese in it but it was actually garlic powder that he just dusted all over his pizza. I did the same thing but only because I like the taste of garlic. It was soooo gooood. The crust was perfectly crisp and not soggy. They're pretty generous with the toppings. It's about $5/slice but it's worth it.  It's a tiny place with a few chairs and by a few I mean about 4-5 chairs. But if you're eating pizza at 1:30am, you must be feeling good and nothing could go wrong.",

It can run a bit pricey as well.  A whole white pie will run you nearly $30, but it's a lot of food, so worth it.  A bottle of water for $4, not so much. If they have a slice of the works available, get it.  Very fresh and a great combo of pepperoni, sausage, onions, bell peppers, and black olives.",

I believe there are maybe 7 seats and 3 video games in this small place. We were able to stand at a counter. We must have arrived at a slow time because there wasn't a line and fresh slices were coming out of the oven.   The pizza. I'm not a huge fan of cheesy pizza. But I do appreciate a good New York style. I had a meat lovers slice and a slice with salami and banana peppers. Both were excellent. The sauce wasn't bland but not overpowering either.   I definitely enjoyed my slices and the uniqueness of Secret Pizza. Also loved the menu - \"no ranch\" - which is a makes me laugh. I know ranch dressing is quite controversial.",

There are no signs for this place so you may need to ask people at the Cosmo hotel to point you the right way.  This place totally reminds me of Roccos in Belltown and Marios up on Cap Hill.  I want to say the pizza is even tastier than Roccos or Marios.  With that said, the reason I didnt give them a 5 was because of the wait.  I think it's just the nature of Vegas, but still.

    "text": "Review #700!    I love NYC pizza with a deep, lustful passion.  It plagues my dreams, calls out to me through windows with its seductive aroma, and makes me yearn for the next cheesy slice.  Secret Pizza is a place in Las Vegas that serves it.  My friend Grace C. went last year when Cella R. told her about it.  Ever since then, I've been plotting my return to Vegas and partaking in this secretive pizza joint.    My fellow elite Yelpers and I made our way over to the Cosmopolitan after a YEE at the Cathouse and ordered 2 pizzas ($50 total): one white pizza and one half pepporoni/ half sausage & mushroom.  It came out to about $5 per person.  Secret Pizza is located up on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan food court next to the sushi restaurant down an unmarked hallway.  There are white tiles and picture frames welcoming you into this unremarkable looking pizza place.  We ordered our pizzas around midnight and got them about 30 minutes after.  It seemed like forever to a slightly inebriated and starving person such as myself.  I was hungry and watching others get their slices before I did, was excruciatingly painful.  Drew M. started to play Donkey Kong while waiting.  Watching his arcade game progression only made me hungrier.    Where was this pizza anyway?!  Why didn't I just order a damn slice?!  Oh wait, there it is.  We brought it outside to the sofas & coffee table.  We dug in.  Silence.  Everyone is chewing and gulping their pizza in a very methodical fashion.  Delicious garlicky white pizza with greasy pepperoni pizza.  I was in heaven.  Was it the best pizza I've ever had?  No, nothing compares to real NYC pizza in NYC, but it comes close.  Too bad the crust wasn't as crispy as I would have liked but the flavor of the white pizza still makes me drool as I write this.  Pizza is the perfect food in the wee hours of the morning when all you want is carbs.  Thanks for making my pizza dreams come True, if only for the night!",

The pizza was delicious, even though I'm sure the alcohol made it taste better.  The crust was doughy and delicious, and a very generous sized slice for your stomach.  The Pepperoni Sausage was a personal favorite!  Gotta go for the meats to curb the appetite.  The only thing I was sad about was that if you wanted to order a whole pizza for yourself, it could only be one kind (as in you can't have half of it be veggies, and the other half be pepperoni salami meat lovers delight).  But fair enough- it helps keep the crowd moving.  By all means, spread this little secret.  It'll make your Vegas clubbing night just that much better.  (Following this you should be going back to your hotel and partying some more)",

    "text": "It really is a secret! But the giveaway that something great is hiding around that corner is the line that builds up.   Went to try this place on our last night in vegas after the edc turn up & was not disappointed. Normally I'd be a bit annoyed I had to wait around 30 min for 1 slice of over priced pizza buuuuuut it was worth it ! The slice is big & the flavor is bigger. If I hadn't been dying & in recovery mode from that weekends shenanigans you can bet I would have bought a whole pizza just for myself.   Every time I'm in vegas you'll find me waiting in that line at some point ! The location is written in some of these reviews but it was way more exciting to look for it on our own ! It's not hard, just follow the pizza trail :)",

Being new to Vegas it took me a while to hear about the Secret Pizza spot until I decided to have the time of my life at Marquee which resulted with a hunger like no other... luckily for me a group of some of the finest women I have ever laid eyes on were talking about pizza and well I was already hungry so I said where we eating ladies, one of them kindly said were going to secret pizza.. which left me curious as to why a Secret? Pizza is AWESOME!!! So I followed them which led me through a lil tight hall full of old school magazines and pictures on the walls which was cool but what was even cooler was that you can smell the pizza at the very end of the path so to keep this short I go there every time I party and I send everyone that visits me over there to try it out as well because it should be a spot to enjoy at least once or twice... take my word on this, it's worth it lol",

    "text": "I had this place bookmarked like forever,  and I've seen a lot of my Yelp buddies have gone to this place called - \"Secret Pizza\".  How secret is it????   Very secret my friends,  and that is why Bruddah Fran is gonna be very generous & give you da scoops, fruit loops!  Honestly, I don't think I would have found this pizza joint if it weren't for my awesome Yelp buddy - Sheryl M.'s review.  Sheryl really gave good instructions on her review on how to find Secret Pizza, but I'm gonna one up it & add more details for you, to help you folks find this pizza joint.  Here it is gang -   1. Of course you need to goto the Cosmopolitan Hotel, because Secret Pizza is located in this hotel.  2. As you enter the hotel, look for the escalator & ride that escalator until you get to the 3rd floor.  3. Of course since the Cosmopolitan hotel is huge, depending on where you enter the hotel (like me), I actually ended up on the 3rd floor but I was by the meeting rooms/convention hall side. As I walked around on the 3rd floor, I was thinking - \"Am I in the right place? Where is this pizza joint?\" Because I didn't see any restaurant businesses around here!  Eventually while walking around on the 3rd floor meeting rooms/convention area, I saw a sign that said - \"SHOPS & RESTAURANTS\".  Head for that sign & as you entire this area you will find retail shops here.  As you past the Shops & Restaurant\" sign, head to your left & look for a business called - \"Blue Ribbon\".   As you see the \"Blue Ribbon\" sign, to the right of it is a secret hallway which will lead you to the Secret Pizza restaurant. Please note, there is NO Secret Pizza sign (that's how secret it is!).  4. If you see alot of record album covers on the ceiling & walls of the hallway, then you've hit paydirt my friends!  You're on your way to the \"Secret Pizza\" joint, as the restaurant was just a few feet away from this hallway.  As I got to Secret Pizza, it was pretty busy. They had pre-made pizzas ready, and as you choose your slice, they will take it & reheat it for you........similar like how  Boston Pizza does it out here in da 808. Now if you want a whole pizza, or freshly made pizza, I'm sure they will do it for you, but I was okay with just picking up something pre-made.  After looking over the various pizza selections, I ended up picking a simple Mushroom Pizza slice.  What can I say about the pizza?  I totally dropped da ball & screwed up here, as I didn't listen to my Yelp buddy - Joyce W. as she told me to get the \"White Pizza\", and like a dummy, I ended up getting the mushroom pizza.  Now don't get me wrong, the mushroom pizza slice was good, but it was nowhere mind blowing great!   I loved the way Secret Pizza did the thin crust, good texture,  and the crust held up nicely for  the pizza toppings, & cheese.  The pizza tasted good,  but like I said before......it wasn't outstanding.   The price for a slice was very reasonable,  as my mushroom slice was just $5.75, a very inexpensive snack for me!  There is no table service here, so be prepared to do a \"grab & go\".  If you choose to eat here, there is limited seating available within the restaurant, but the seating mostly consisted of bar type tables, & stools to sit down on.  Overall a cool pizza joint! If you're looking for a quick snack or cheap meal, you may consider checking out Secret Pizza.",

The restaurant is small, only counter space to eat your pizza, but behind the counter is bustling and busy. The workers are friendly and prompt - you order your slice or get a whole pizza and take it to go or eat it on the counter. I was with a group of 5 which made it tough to get seating for all of us, but eventually we were able to huddle together and enjoy our pizzas.  The flavor is great, the authenticity is there, but I wish I just stuck to one slice, and a simple slice because the supreme pizza (we got a whole pizza) was really heavy and salty. My boyfriend and I had this pizza on the first night we were in Vegas (we were staying for 3), and to be honest it kinda threw us off because of the greasiness and saltiness... after this meal we weren't able to eat much more heavy foods because it just didn't sit well while drinking and gambling for the rest of the night.  Next time we'll know better and order a slice of the mushroom pizza or something simpler!",

The drinks are expensive since it is in a hotel, $4 for a soft drink so we purchase the two liter for $8. A pie cost $36.00 for a multiple topping pizza. A bit pricey and there's no place to sit and eat except small bar like tables against the wall which no one cleaned. Again, I wasn't impressed but it's hard to screw up pizza.",

    "text": "Let's start with location: this is next to Jaleo and the entrance to the boulevard pool, or if you take the escalators that are around the chandelier bar, just go up to the 3rd level and look for the alley to the left of Jaleo.   The inside is small, and sometimes the line runs all down the hallway, but there is a seating area outside the restaurant that is just general seating (not set up by secret pizza).   The pizza is pretty good. It's thin crust and a slice of cheese will cost you $5.25. You can also order a whole pizza (and pick your own toppings), so if you are staying at the Cosmo, it may be a good deal. There are 5 different types of pizza that I counted: cheese, white, sausage, pepperoni, and a mixed vegetable. A soda costs $4, so my total was $9.25 for the slice and fountain drink. Not awful for the strip, and they are open late, so you are able to grab a bite after a show or concert.   As a local, I'm not going to come down to the strip just for Secret Pizza, but it is a fun place to meet or bring friends that come to town because it isn't on any of the Cosmopolitan maps. And if I'm at a boulevard pool concert, it's a pretty good place to stop on my way out for a quick bite.",

    "text": "Hidden gem of the Cosmo hotel.   Nice little tasty secret hidden in the hotel.     Location:   It's up on the third floor down a random unmarked hallway.  There's no signage.  Find the escalators in the middle of the casino floor and take it up to the 3rd floor and at the top of the escalator, look straight for the hallway with the record albums hanging along the walls and you will know that's your place.     About:  Once finding your way there,  it's a pretty no frills kinda place,  just a pizza counter and a few spots to sit down along the wall to eat.  It's literally a hole in the wall.  Slices run about $5  and then cost extra for additional toppings.  Wasn't sure if you could customize, but they had a bunch of pre-made pizzas all ready to go and I just picked a few slices.   I did ask for a cup of water and unfortunately, in True Vegas fashion, you will have to buy your water which a super baby bottle was like $2 and a regular bottle was $4.   So I just opted for a Michelob Ultra, which was essentially the same thing.  Might as well.     Pizza:  Texture is thin and crisp, New York Style Pizza.   Dough was made well and it was in need of folding to enjoy without flopping around too much.   Meat Lovers was good, came with pepperoni, meatball and Italian sausage.  Tasty AF.     But the star of the meal was the white pizza.  It was creamy and garlicy!  Super good and super addicting!  I almost wish I got two slices.   If you like garlic, this is for you.   I'd come here again!",

    "text": "For weeks upon weeks my buddy Arpan kept going on and on about Secret Pizza at the Cosmo. He didn't have many details, so I didn't bother Googling for any. My private hope was that it was a phenomenon that took place on the gambling floor.  Some of you may be familiar with gastropubs that serve surprise cookies at a late hour when the kitchen is closed and the chef just kinda feels like doing it. I had hoped this was a similar kind of circumstance. It wasn't. (I have a vivid imagination alright)   The secret is a corridor that is negligent of advertising. You can figure out what it is because of the long ass line which snakes out into a common area on the second floor(?). I think it's the second floor, it's been weeks since our trip and now back in Chicago, I am a little forgetful. Classic, NY style pizza. It's some good ish.. so get you some.  Another secret to secret pizza; buy a single slice of a plain za pie and enjoy it immediately. Find open seating in the common areas just outside the corridor. You'll find a lot of people out there doing the same.  And if you decide to take a pizza back to your hotel, don't make the same mistakes we did. We thought ordering pies with many toppings would be tasty.. It's a NY styled slice. Thin dough painted with a quick dab of sauce. Minimal toppings are the best way to enjoy it.  As others have noted, yes it's pizza in Vegas. However, it doesn't contain gold. For a slice and a full pie with three toppings I paid $50 dollars. That's a lot of money.. the full pie wasn't as tasty as the plain slice. It came out too salty due to the toppings. You won't get much input from whomever is at the counter, so choose wisely.    These slices are best served hot. I don't advise buying a full pie unless you've got your whole party with you. Most rented living spaces, hotels and such (across Vegas) don't offer cooking appliances. (I've stayed in suites at the SLS and Palazzo, both didn't have'em.) But if yours does and it's a microwave, do this for the perfect slice:  Microwave a slice or two with one shot of water. Place the shot on the side. A steaming action occurs and the za looks fresh with melty cheese! Unlike regular, nuked slices.  After a long day partying at Daylight.. this slice hit the spot.",

    "text": "4 stars and nearly 4,500 reviews. But, shhh...it's a secret.   New York style pizza at it's best here. Now, I'm a big fan of deep dish Chicago style pizzas and actually prefer them over thin crusts, but I gotta admit, the pizzas here are pretty damn good, and dang it!  Now I got conflicting emotions that are messing me up. Lol  Yeah yeah yeah, like everyone says, it's soooo hard to find. So pay attention. Here's the scoop. Take the escalator up to the 3rd floor, look straight ahead and you'll see albums on the wall in the hallway that leads you to Secret Pizza. Super easy now that you know, right?  I first came here years ago, and yes, like many others before me, it was after a night of drunken shenanigans. I'm pretty sure the pizza tasted great at the time, but I kinda don't remember. Hahaha! But I mean it must have been because I knew I wanted to go back for more!  So here I was again after I dunno how many years later and somewhat sober after only having a few beers, and the pizzas were so good! The light and crispy thin crust still had a little chew to it and it was still pliable enough to fold in half and scarf.  But okay, to be fair, the pepperoni pizza is just your average slice. Nothing mind blowing. But do yourself a favor and get the white. It's the best. Cheesy with cheese drag and all! Mm mm mm!  No tables in here. Just counters. Cash or cards accepted.",

My husband prefers nothing fancy, fusion-y or \"creative\" when it comes to food. So I think he'll really like this spot. I know you're thinking it's just pizza but eating this is a really nice treat. Wish I had this back home!",

Even if you're going for just a slice, the line is almost out the hallway and it would take more than 40 minutes just to place an order. Also, there are no signs that would take you to Secret Pizza. It's located on 2nd floor in Cosmopolitan Hotel. Just look for a dark hallway with bunch of old vintage laser disc covers. We had couple slices right after we got the pizza and brought the leftovers back to our hotel, The Venetian. Many tourists asked me to share it on our way back to the hotel. We're giving 4 stars because they're pricey and the wait time was too long. The real question is, \"was the pizza really good, or was it good because it was 3am?\"",

That's good for their business, but it is not so good for us since the lines are longer now. However, the pizza is worth the wait!  When my husband and I visit Vegas, we make sure to come here. It is one of our favorite pizzas! Our favorites are the white and meat pizzas. The quality of the ingredients plus the crust/topping ratio are on point. Additionally, the price is appropriate for the quality of food you get.   I would definitely recommend this place if ever in Las Vegas. Though it is not a hidden gem as it once was, it is still worth going to. Just follow the aroma of their delicious pizza to find the place.",

Like every review says there is a huge line that usually extends out of the hallway.  There are no signs, directions or anything that lets you know this is a pizza place. (Few people thought we were in line for a club). When we finally got to the front of the line we ordered a box of pepperoni.  It came in a blank white box.  Now we were pretty inebriated so at first the pizza was delicious but after a few slices and as the buzz wore off the realization became more clear.  It's not that good of pizza.  It's not a horrible pizza don't get me wrong, it's just not worth the extravagant price and all the hype that surrounds it.  If your looking for good food that is unique to Vegas I would really look elsewhere.  It's just not worth the walk over.",

    "text": "After a few trips to Vegas intending to check out Secret Pizza, I finally made it there! There is no sign for Secret Pizza, and you just have to look for the open hallway to the right of the Blue Ribbon restaurant on the third floor of the Cosmo. Although the line wasn't that long at 12:30am on a \"Friday\" night (the line was about halfway down the entry hallway with the records), it still took about 30 minutes to order. However, you receive your slice(s) pretty quickly after that. I tried:  -Sausage & Pepperoni ($6.25, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Ib6XqU3ePVdm3yg1KiD1TQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>): Yum- this was the epitome of a delicious greasy pizza. The sausage and pepperoni were really flavorful, but I preferred the sausage over the pepperoni. This combination worked well together though- recommended! -White Pizza ($5.75, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=oCcS6v2yHfvIXHZTo1qUyQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>): Good, but I didn't think this lived up to the hype. Worth trying once though, especially if you really like ricotta on your pizza.  A lot of people were ordering whole pies, and you should definitely call in advance to avoid having to wait. There is very limited seating inside, and mostly counter style seating. There's a small couch area with coffee table set up outside to dine at also. I'll definitely be back if looking for pizza late night and in the area.",

No its not cheap, I had my supreme slice with an orange soda for $10, pretty expensive even by New York standards for just 1 slice, but maybe not so much by Vegas standards. BUT, did you know for $4.50 they also have huge slices of mind blowingly delicious SECRET CHEESECAKE?!?!?! This is my second time staying in the cosmo, and thanks to a craving, I hunted down this delectable gem, after speaking to various workers in different restaurants in search of a cheesecake to get my fix before my flight. WOW is it yummy, perfectly chilled, savory graham cracker crust, creamy yet dense cheesecake texture, its sooooo rich. Totally not advertised. You wont even know about it if you dont read this review, or unless you happen to be scavenger hunting down a cheesecake in the cosmo like myself. Dont. Miss it. YUM.",

The crust could not support the fats from the cheese and meats which made the crust completely marry in with the cheese to create this flimsy, greasy slice.  I understand that who makes the pizza makes the difference in the outcome so maybe the cooks had an off day.  I went in at around 1 pm on Saturday on 1/25/2014 and had the white pizza and meat lovers.  There was no line but was told by some that the line is usually off the hook.  There is so much more to experience foodie wise in Vegas, especially off the strip.  If you are looking for a cheap eat in a pizza form Bonnanos on the strip does the job and a much better tasting slice or if you want similar to east coast style pizza  Grimaldis at the Venetian is amazing...pricey but worth it.  Foodies leave this place behind to the drunkards coming off that club high and let the grease soaks up all their sins cuz lord knows this place has enough greasy pizza to purify everyone in Vegas!",

I had to send a PA to pick them up since Secret doesn't deliver but I must say I was impressed that they could churn out that many pizzas in a 45 minute window. Did it arrive cold? Yes, but what did I expect? It was still delicious and I can't wait to try it fresh out of the oven.",

You see a ton of swanky fancy restaurants and the best restauarant in the entire place is this hidden pizza place hidden between all these restaurants. I don't think I have to say muh about how good the pizza and this place is. All the other reviews will do it for me. Just a heads up they only do New York Style Pizza. There is no formal seating area but there is plenty of nice seating outside the actual hole in the wall. Go try it. Its Cheap, fast and good greasy food for your drinking.",

It's one of those places where they charge what they charge because they can. Like when you go to Disneyland and a bottle of water is $6 bucks. If you're desperate enough, you'll pay the $6 and be happy about it.   Consider it a convenience tax.  They have nice pepperoni and they have a bianca with ricotta, which is kind of a dying breed these days.  It's good to have this spot in your back pocket if you're on the strip and dying for hot food and you've only got a hamilton in your pocket and lost all your credit cards.   It's not destination pizza. You don't make plans to come here specifically to eat the pizza. You eat the pizza here because you can.",

I'm personally a 'no meat on my pizza' typa gal, so I stick with the amazing \"White Pizza\". I've heard the sausage and pepperoni pizzas are good as well. They have gran. garlic, parm, and chili shakers so you can top your slice. I love all three on mine. Yeah, I guess you can say it's a bit pricey, but sooooo worth it.

Directly behind her was a soda machine that certainly had a \"water\" button on it. When I pointed it out, she gave me a dirty look and said \"it's broken\". It is what it is if you're not allowed to give out free water (which would surprise me in a place like the Cosmopolitan) but she didn't need to have such a rude demeanor.

It's mucho carb overload that hits the spot while eating after a hard night of partying or gambling. However, you are warned, you (or the person sleeping next to you) may pay the price later.",

Long line plus over priced slices plus minimal seating? No thanks. The first time, we had to walk down towards the event rooms down the hall just to find a place to sit! All the seating outside of the shop was taken! By the time we found chairs to sit in, the pizza was cold. Good, but cold.   The second time was post ice skating. The line was shorter but again... casino/Strip prices for a slice of pizza. Meh.   The decor is very music themed with a NYC vibe, but it really isn't anything special. There are some arcade games, which if they moved would make space for more seating.   The pizza IS good. But the price for a slice is higher than I think is worth it.",

We ended up in the Cosmopolitan more than once because...well, it's beautiful, majestic, and mostly pink!  Secret Pizza is a genius hole-in-the-wall covert pizza joint on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. I give it five stars for the sole fact that it is more hidden than most \"speakeasies\" I've encountered in recent history. OH and the pizza is delicious.  You can't really miss the hallway entryway, located directly to the right of the hostess-stand of a restaurant that has a name which I cannot recall. Anywho, a somewhat discreet hallway adorned with historic record covers leads you directly to Secret Pizza. There you will find several ready-made pies, ready for reheat and consumption.   If the reheat aspect doesn't sound appetizing, just try it - I am a weirdo about leftovers but I am also a realist and do not expect them to bake an entire cheese pie just so that I can enjoy one slice of it.  Seating inside Secret Pizza is somewhat limited, but there are plenty of seating areas just outside of the hallway, where you can relax and devour your pizza with no shame (seriously - everyone is eating their pizza out there).",

    "text": "When you're visiting the Las Vegas Strip and don'tWhen you're visiting the Las Vegas Strip and don't want to splurge on EVERY meal, there's clearly one affordable thing you can eat: Pizza. Even just one slice of heavenly, oily, crunchy, savory, and cheesy dough will be enough to satiate you for hours and fuel you up for a day of partying.   But in Sin City of all places, where should you go for the BEST budget pizza? For first-time visitors and old travelers alike, nothing beats Secret Pizza.   With over 4k reviews, Secret Pizza isn't necessarily a secret but a large number of people have either not heard of it before or have never seen it. Lost behind the more \"must-visit\" places such as Fat Tuesday's or Hell's Kitchen, I'm here to tell you why Secret Pizza should be one of your first stops on the strip.   My girlfriend and I immediately stopped by Secret Pizza after entering Las Vegas since we wanted to pick up food without a substantial wait. Not to spoil too much, but Secret Pizza was located somewhere in the Cosmopolitan hotel, one of the classiest looking ones along the strip. Luckily, it only cost about $7 to park for four hours so we milked our time here.  We came by around 1 pm and it really didn't take that long to find Secret Pizza. I mean what other eatery is going to have an alley-way like entrance? Hint hint. Luckily, the line wasn't too long, and so we were able to reach the front in like 15 minutes? Basically, the way this place worked was that you could either order by the slice or by the pie (i.e. whole pizza). Their bases included cheese, tomato, or the famous white (blend of butter, cheese, other good stuff, etc.). And ingredients ranged from meatballs to Italian peppers. As you'd expect, if you order by the slice the only options available are the ones at the counter; they get re-baked obviously but you can't be like \"I want a white pizza with mushrooms\" and think that they'd make it for you.   Since my girlfriend and I only wanted to share, and because they didn't have white slices available (they run out FAST!), we got a single slice of their tomato pizza with meat and peppers. It ended up costing around $6. In case you're wondering, I believe their whole pies were around $28-$34 depending on the number of toppings.   It took a hot second or two for our pizza to come out, but we thought the wait was totally worth it! We found a seat outside in a lounge area of the hotel (though Secret Pizza did have seating), and immediately dug in. The pizza slice was SO GOOD! Crust was very crispy, cheese was GOOEY AF, ingredients felt pretty fresh, and the huge portion size somewhat justified the above average cost. My favorite part was probably the fact that our pizza came out SMOKING HOT! We both loved it so much that we almost came back again just to see if they had the white pizza.   I wouldn't say Secret Pizza had the \"best pizza\" I've ever had, but we certainly enjoyed our brief experience here. Though the cost is higher than most places for the slice, and it's a hit or miss whether they'll have the white pizza or even the slices you want, I guarantee you'll find solace here - especially because it's practically open 18+ hours a day. Just be sure not to come during prime time (idk when that is) cause I'm sure you'll be waiting forever! I give Secret Pizza a \"Nice-su\" you can take your parents here and they'll be happy\" rating. Guess it's not much of a \"secret\" anymore!   Eat well and prosper :)",

    "text": "Shhhhh! I first found this spot years ago while staying at the Cosmopolitan. On one of the drunken nights I was stumbling around, my friends and I accidentally found this place. If we didn't see people walking in the hallway, we would have totally missed it. All I remember the next morning was the pizza burned the roof of my mouth but it was good. Heck, the pizza box was empty on the floor of my suite so that was a good thing right?   The next time I was back in Vegas, I was craving pizza and wanted to go back. Unfortunately I didn't know the name or even remembered where the restaurant was located. All I knew was it was in the Cosmopolitan. Sad how I could find this gem drunk but had a hard time locating it sober. Go figure the name of the place is Secret Pizza and there isn't a sign for the place. Now I know it's on the 3rd floor straight off the escalator.   They have New York style pizza here and you can either by them by the slice or as a whole pie. If you don't see the slice you want on display, just ask because they have more pizzas below the display area. The slices are reheated so it's nice and hot. I really like the crust here. They also sell beer here and it does compliment the pizza well. Just keep in mind they don't have much counter seating and this place is busy. Hmmm I'm craving pizza now...",

Our first night at Vegas we came here for dinner.  My sister Joyce recommended this place because they had the best pizza in town.  This place would of been hard to find without detailed instructions since there was no sign and the location was hidden deep away through a long tunnel.   The location was tight, a little dirty, the service was friendly and fast.  The pizza was good, I especially enjoyed the crust of the pizza, by far the best crust on a pizza I ever had.  Overall a great experience and will definitely be back.",

I will say that the wait can be long due to the night crowd (can't blame them for wanting this delicious pizza) so just be prepared for that.

Once you walk down this hallway on the 3rd floor that is by the purple lit up lift, you can't help but imagine what kind of pizza is currently being freshly baked. It's a pretty small place with limited seating. People mainly order by the slice or a whole and take it to go. They have several toppings but I've heard the white sauce pizza is the way to go. The crust was nice and crispy and the cheese oozes as you take your first bite. This is definitely the spot to hit up if you are drunk and need something to fill your stomach after stumbling out of a club or simply a quick bite. I knew I had to stop by this place since it was right next to where we were staying at. Prices are not too shabby for Vegas prices.",

But getting here was a chore, especially if you are a tourist and had no clue where it is located. This place is literary hidden, no signage and no directions. Located inside the swanky Cosmopolitan hotel, you need to take an escalator to the third floor and turn left! Look for the popin colored hallway decorated with famed record-plated and you are at the right spot!   Once inside, you will be greeted with long lines, which move at a moderate pace. The space is real tiny with counter tables and no chairs... frenzied atmosphere and zero ambiance. For my pizza, I ordered their popular white pizza and it was pretty good. It consists of ricotta and mozzarella cheese - yep, nothing too creative with the toppings, but the flavors were spot on and I appreciate the simplicity in delivering everything I love in a single serving.  The pizza here cost around $5-6 per slice. Not exactly cheap, but after spending few days eating at the Strip, this place suddenly feels relatively affordable, lol. In All, Secret Pizza was a pretty decent experience; the service was friendly, food is quick and reliable and the best part is.. They are open 24 HOURS! :)",

Exit the 3rd floor elevator and make a right and right into a narrow hallway and bam! A little hole in the wall pizza spot with some delicious options! Slices are about $5-$6 and pretty big! Their red sauce is seriously flavorful.  I couldn't decide so I got both the white slice and veggie slice. Typically I would choose white over anything but I actually preferred their veggie- good sauce to topping radio. Also, it wasn't soggy and wet which usually happens with veggie pizzas   slices were up before we could even finish paying. Came out on a paper plate, nothing fancy. Beer was in a red plastic cup! No more than 4 chairs in the place but you're in vegas so you can eat and drink wherever!",

Sure, but you'll end up waiting more than 30 minutes for it, and by that time, it's not worth it. There is nothing mind blowing about Secret Pizza- not the food, customer service, or beer selection. After waiting in line over 35 minutes, someone who looked like a manager came out and just stood there watch all of us wait. He didn't offer to help. It was simple pizza at best- but at 2am & after waiting in line 30+ minutes, not worth it. Go across the st & find other immediate (& cheaper!) options at Planet Hollywood",

The place is located on the third floor of Cosmopolitan, just locate a narrow hallway once you reach the third floor from the escalator. The slices are pretty big and priced at about $5-$6 each. It's a bit pricy for a slice of pizza, but it's expected since you're in Vegas and also cheaper compared to most places on the strip.   I got two slices and they filled me up. The white pizza definitely lived up to its hype, I was skeptical since it had no toppings, but it was delicious! The sauce was flavorful and perfectly cheesy. The combo pizza was good too, but you can get it anywhere. They also have a self serve water machine to quench your thirst. The only con is that it's too oily, had to get rid of some of the grease with a napkin.   Seating is limited inside, but there are a couple of lounge couches and tables outside to sit. Overall, I wouldn't mind coming back if I'm nearby or craving for some pizza.",

Maybe I needed to be super drunk to enjoy it but I thought the pizza was just regs.  I wasn't too impressed but it was a decent slice. Maybe I'll try one with toppings next time or I'll try it when I'm super drunk.",

    "text": "\"Every once in a lifetime, dreams can come True.\"  That is how I felt when I took my first bite of Secret Pizza. This is one of the main reasons I came to Vegas.  Cheese drag, fat juicy chunks of sausages, and pepperoni that was to die for.  Secret Pizza really had it all. The mystique of not being formally mentioned anywhere inside of the hotel, a cool hallway of music records to give it a chic and classic kind of feel, sports playing on a TV in the corner, and the delicious pizza to go with it.  On the real, though, I don't think there's any way I would've been able to find this place on my own if The Empress hadn't been there before and led me there herself. But, that's Secret Pizza's whole thing, isn't it? I think it's pretty cool! It makes the place feel almost a little exclusive.   Onto the food! The pizza was phenomenal. I mean, I'm by no means any pizza expert or anything, but I do know that that was the best pizza I've ever had; hands down (and I've been to Chicago, folks). The pizza that I had wasn't even a freshly baked one. It was from a hot plate and then put back into the oven for a few minutes. That's how good it was! The cheese, as mentioned above was oh so stringy. Legitimately the most stringy cheese that I have ever had on a pizza, and I loved it. The sausage on the pizza was also just amazing. They were the largest chunks of Italian sausage that I've had on a pizza before, and they were just as flavorful as they were large. Even the crust was nice and perfectly crisp, but soft at the same time. The pizza was spectacular.  To say that Secret Pizza lived up to my expectations would be an understatement. The only thing that bums me out about any of it is that I'm lactose intolerant and could only bring myself to go get pizza there once in the few days that we were in Vegas.  If you can manage to find Secret Pizza, then I absolutely suggest that you make a point of stopping by to get the same experience I did. You won't regret it!",

We always grab a slice on our way back after eating at the Wicked Spoon, since that's in the same hotel. I'm usually stuffed, but my kids can always find some room.  I'd say it's probably better to eat when it's fresh in the place, but my kids also eat it after taking it back to the room and they still love it. We love the pepperoni, but the white pie slices are also delicious.",

    "text": "Tried coming here twice for dinner, once on Saturday and once on Sunday, both around 6:30 pm. The line was super long on Saturday so we bounced for the McDonald's nearby, but surprisingly there was zero line when we tried again on Sunday at exactly the same time!  This secret pizza spot is sandwiched between two restaurants (Jaleo and something else) on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo. You walk down a secret hallway full of a variety of posters, and once you're at the end, that's where the magic happens.  I got two slices of pizza - 1) pepperoni and sausage and 2) mushroom. Both were pretty big slices and tasted okay, but perhaps it was my very sober state of mind, but I didn't think it was worth the all the hype. I can see this being a great late night option for those stumbling out of Marquee in the wee hours of the morning though, since it's right there next to where you exit the club.  Also thought it was overpriced (I paid $11.50 for my two slices), but hey it's Vegas, I shouldn't expect too much.  There isn't much seating though, so you can either try to sit at the 5-6 counter spots they have available along the wall, or do take out and eat elsewhere.",

    "text": "So this was a fun adventure to find. It was worth it! I totally went off Yelpers pictures to find this place. You guys are awesome. :] So once again, this place is on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan. Once you get off the escalator, you go slightly to your left and definitely look for  a darkish looking hallway. I have a picture of what it looks like from the beginning. Once you find that...you're in lol. The place is small and feels like there's way too much in there, besides the people. You wait in a line, but more people come in so it feels like the room is closing in on you. Plus there's also two game machines in the entrance area. There needs to be more sitting area.   Getting to how you order. We were lost lol. We looked @ the menu, but we didn't know the flavors of the pizza. When the girl asked me what I wanted, I came right out and said \"I have no idea how this works, I'm sorry\" She laughed and then explained it. She was cool about it. So I ended up just getting cheese. It looked amazing. So they take your slice and warm it up for you in the oven. For three slices I paid $16.50. The other two slices were with toppings.  The workers here are nice and friendly. They don't get mad when you ask questions or are slow in ordering. They're really cool.  Getting to my pizza, it was one of the best pizzas I've tasted!!! It tasted fresh, not old. It put a smile on face. I wanted to eat it super fast, but then @ the sametime I wanted to eat it super slow to savor every bite lol. I wanted to get another slice, but I was actually full after my first one. My friend got the pepperoni one and she loved it. My BF got the one with sausage and pepperoncini. He said he could have had three more slices of it lol.  Overall, I'm so happy this place isn't such a secret anymore lol. I'm coming back the next time I'm in Vegas! This place rocks my socks! This place is also good to go to since it's cheap and still good. It's a good place for your wallet ;] Also it's open super super late. So if you get hungry @ 3 in the morning (providing you're staying @ the Cosmopolitan) you can get good food and feel happy about it. It's like winning in the casino.  #NotSoSecretPizza #BestPizzaInVegas",

After seeing Secret Pizza on Travel Channel's 'Secret Eats' with Adam Richman, we were on the hunt! Taking a look at hints on Yelp, we quickly found the spot! It really isn't that hidden, but for unsuspecting and not-so-curious guests, it is easily missed. Take a hallway filled with records and old band photos down to a New York style pizzeria with arcade games, a simple menu, and plenty of options!  We ordered the best of course: a slice of White and a slice of Ricotta-Sausage!  Let me start off by saying the crust on these pizzas is superb. fantastic. amazing! So thin yet so crispy, nicely charred, and great flavor! The white pizza was oh so cheesy, oh so garlicky, and oh so fantastically amazingly delicious! The ricotta-sausage was oh so cheesy as well, and the sausage was magnificent! The best sausage on a pizza I have had yet! Nice spice, juicy, and paired well with the ricotta!  This is an absolute must for any pizza lover!",

This vegas strip joint reminds me of the real ny slice found in many places in NYC. Definetly recommend conducting your own \"scavenger hunt\" and rewarding yourself with a slice of pie. They are open late and perfect to stop at before hittin the nightlife. I deduct 1 star because slice is a bit over priced, c'mon its a slice of pizza. They would make more money if they dropped the price by a buck. I ordered a combo slice, pepperoni slice and a drink..$14.",

And I'm not comparing this to brick oven pizza cause it's not.  It's your utilitarian slice pizza and it's supposed to be greasy and please don't use a knife and fork.  Fold it in half!!",

His was nice and hot, but mine was a little on the lukewarm side. Still, it was really good: lots of garlic and cheese. Definitely hit the spot, and given my slightly buzzed state, worth the $5/slice.",

Good for me because that meant I did not have to stand and eat!  I am definitely not into standing and eating.  I ordered a Sicilian slice which seemed to be a deep dish white pizza with sausage.  I am not normally a fan of sausage but for some reason I wanted sausage pizza.  I also ordered a fountain Coke Zero.  Very happy they had fountain Coke Zero- that's a plus for me!  My boyfriend also ordered a Coke and he ordered two slices of a thin white pizza.  Total bill was just over $26, and we left a few dollars in the tip jar.  We barely had to wait at all for our pizza and soda before I could sit down with my pizza as my boyfriend ate and loitered next to me.  By loitered I hope you get that that means he was standing.  Haha- I love being a girl!  The one piece of pizza was almost too much for me to eat and it was actually very good pizza.  Not greasy, not weird dough, not too much or too little cheese.  Next time I would like to try a slice of pepperoni pizza.  I doubt I will ever be here on a weekend because if the lines truly are that long I don't know that that would be worth it for me; mostly because I prefer sitting and eating.",

We asked the cashier what's the name she said \"We actually don't have a name but everyone calls it Secret Pizza\". We were like Wow! They give you free refills on drinks but there's no seating unless you come in the lobby.

We waited about 45 minutes in line and it might not seem too bad but in heels & surrounded by other drunk girls who are suffering in heels.. I wouldn't compare it to Hell, but it freakin sucked. We decided to get a whole 2-topping pizza which cost $31.00. Add another 15 mins for the wait, by the time it was ready I was ready to eat the whole damn thaaaang.. but only ate one slice there because of how mediocre it was. The crust was soggy and in my opinion it was bland. I was so bummed out! I will tell you that we brought the pizza back to the hotel room & it tasted better after it had time to cool a little more; the crust got a little crunchier. Overall, I'm glad that we got to try this place because it's always on TV but I would not go back again. On to the next one!",

I think not. : ) after hearing so many good things about the East Coast style slices, I really needed to taste test this place for myself. as an avid fan of big, thin slices, it was cool to go search this popular joint out n c what the hype was all about!  Secret Pizza is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino in the city of Las Vegas. it's on the 3rd floor of the hotel where STK is. if u c a small, dark hallway with lots of old record covers on the walls. (what r \"records?\")   the space inside is pretty small n dark. there's an area where u pick the slices n pay. there's maybe 3 stools to sit n eat at. thank god there wasn't a line when we were there so we found empty spaces to stand n eat by the wall. we got a slice of Meatball & Ricotta n a slice of White Pizza. for me, the amount of cheese on them was perfect cuz I'm lactose-intolerant. if there was more cheese, I'd probably b throwing it all up an hour later. yep, pretty gross.   I'd definitely go back for another slice if I was on the Strip again. it's probably the cheapest n tastiest meal I've ever had in Vegas!",

Names like Eggslut and Milkbar, and best of all, Secret Pizza which, due to it's tremendous popularity isn't so secret at all.  If you're new , there are no signs, nothing to mark it on the resort maps. You just have to know where it is, which is the 3rd floor down the hall with the framed pictures.  They sell pizza by the slice and it's probably the best pizza you will find anywhere! They make a white pizza that they're known for. Ricotta, mozzarella, and lots of fresh garlic. Get it! So damn good!  I asked the guy what time they closed in case we wanted to go back late, and he said 5 a.m., so you can get your pizza fix as late as you want.  Two slices and a soda will run you about $15. Totally worth every penny! The slices are huge!",

I didn't think it was as good as people say it is but I definitely like the concept of it being hidden from everything else in a little hallway. This was my first time here and I came here only because I was living in Cosmopolitan and my friend told me about it. Other than that, I'm pretty sure this is a hole in the wall that no one really knows about it. Anyways, back to the pizza, I'd say the pizza is only good once it is fresh out of the oven and you eat it right away. If you leave it out for little bit (like it did for one of the slices), it becomes just a really poorly made pizza you can buy for like a $1 somewhere. For the price of one pizza, I would probably not come back unless I was with a group of friends and ordering a whole pizza to split.   It was pretty packed when I came here so expect a line, service was not exceptional but I understand they were busy, and there's not a lot of seating. I'm not too ecstatic about this place and would probably go somewhere else for my meals in Vegas.",

We tried pepperoni pizza and the white pizza.  I preferred the white pizza, but both were too oily for my taste.  I loved the crust though, thin, crispy, and baked perfectly.  It might have been better if I got a fresh baked slice, but I think mine was sitting out for a little while.  I probably won't go back, but if you're a pizza aficionado, definitely worth checking out.  tip:  On the 3rd floor of Cosmopolitan, between Jose Andre's Jaleo and Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar&Grill",

The girl that took our order was really friendly and cheerful. We ordered a whole pizza and it came out piping hot. The cheese was sooooo yummy and gooey. The crust was thin and in between crispy and soft...perfection. I put on all the extra parmesan cheese, red pepper flakes, rosemary (i think) and this garlic salt that was PHENOMENAL. I folded that piece of pizza heaven in half, took a bite and was totally satisfied. Everybody loved it, young and old. We ate out in the cosmo on a leather (pleather) couch with cool dice carved tables and played a few games of pool. This is not to miss if youre in town.",

Soooo good, went there both nights we were there. Late night joint, definitely a lot of the nightlife crowd filling this place up, but I will say, the pizza with the italian sausage was sooooo good. Highly recommend, Secret pizza, not so SECRET anymore, especially when you see a line coming out of a small hallway",

It's not a huge place but the decor definitely reminds me of a hole in the wall pizza joint. The pizza is good, but the only drawback is the price. It is on the pricier side for a slide or even a whole pie. They are definitely known for their white pizza too.",

I think maybe an hour later or longer even, we finally got our pizza. We were starving at this point and ordered a whole pie. Half white and half pep and olive. We walk back down the hallway and everyone is cat calling our pizza. I felt a little guilty because I knew how long those people have to wait but not guilty enough I just kept it walking with my pizza ;) the white pizza is amazing!! I honestly never cared for ricotta but I don't know if it was the alcohol it just tasted amazing the dough is perfect. I was worried because some friends had it their 1st night here and said it was too greasy. I did not have that problem at all or maybe I can handle the grease a little more.

They serve up amazing custom pizzas by the slice or the entire pie. Our group came in during dinner time, so the line was pretty long, but customers walking out assured us it was worth the wait. Our group of five people ordered a custom pie, and it was more than enough to feed me and a bunch of hungry boys! We got the white pizza with five toppings, including a unique apple sausage and creamy cheese. Although the pizza is on the greasier side, it's the perfect indulgent pizza you want to find in a city like Vegas. The dough itself is pretty thin, barely enough to hold up all the cheese and toppings. I'm all about the crust, and this was one was baked to perfection with a crispy, charred outside and a doughy, chewy interior. The pizza is extremely generous in size, leaving me more than full after a slice and a half. I definitely recommend this spot to get some gourmet Vegas-worthy pizza on the go!",

For anyone coming from New York, the pizza will be no better or worse than your average local, while for anyone coming from anywhere else, it'll be pretty good (not great, but pretty good).  The price will be several times as high either way ($15.25 bought me a cheese slice, a veggie slice, and a diet coke), but again, you're in a high-end Las Vegas casino, and the extra $6-10 seems worth the hassle of not having to leave the strip.  Heck, compared to the $7 cup of Illy coffee and $16 sandwich you can have downstairs, or the $35 you'll spend on on a room service club sandwich (to say nothing of the $100 for mediocre sushi you can pay at Blue Ribbon next door), a satisfying, no-nonsense lunch for $10-$15 is the biggest bargain you're likely to find in CityCenter.",

The pizza maker was NOT a happy camper.  All we could hustle was a piece of cheese cake from the freezer...until somehow by the grace of God and our (more my sisters) charm we managed to pull it off.

The directions were easy - 3rd level and look for the hallway next to the elevator. But don't look for a sign - there's not one.  This is a good, no-frills pizza joint that is good for a late night bite. I had a slice of the white pizza, which was very cheesy, large and super-delicious. My partner had the sliced meatball, which was good, but he's had better. Any pizza aficionado has their preferences, so don't expect it to compare to the neighborhood pizza joint you know and love. You go here because it's late, you're tipsy and you need something good and filling to cap off the night. You'd spend probably the same amount at a Sbarro in any of the ubiquitous food courts on the strip, so do yourself a favor and go for the better pizza at Secret Pizza.",

    "text": "The Secret Pizza Place is its real name, I swear.  I was so amped when I found it, thanks to you previous 21 yelpers. I LOVE pizza, and I think I might have found my favorite pizza place besides Grimaldi's. Then again, I came at 3 in the morning, was given a free slice of pizza AND a free slice of cheesecake, AND great conversation so I could be a little influenced but I'm pretty sure it's excellent.  Please try the white pizza with tomatoes. Your tastebuds will thank you. Please make sure you have some gum with you. Your friends and other strangers will thank you.  Nico and Cristos are food artists. 'Artists' would have been italicized if that were allowed.  The slice of cheesecake is pretty clutch, too.  Bring tip money! You'll need it, i swear!",

All were so delicious and distinct tasting whereas sometimes, when I order from chain pizza places, everything tastes the same regardless of what you ordered. Total for 6 slices was $31.50. A bit pricey, but really really yummy. There's not much else I can add that hasn't already been written, but they did give my nephew a free slice of cheesecake because it was his 5th birthday.

This pizza joint is located down a long hallway lined with album covers.  You might be able to spot the \"Vegas\" pinball machine from outside.  It's a very small place.  Once inside, you will notice: -A few stools and a small counter to sit at.   -Pinball machine, and an arcade game.   -Couple of pizza ovens. -Pizza counter with pre-made pizzas, and a handful of toppings to choose from. -Pizza artist and a cashier. -Great pizza!  It's not a full dining establishment.  Pretty much order and go. You wouldn't expect much more from a place with $3 pizza slices in a multi-billion dollar resort.   You can have extra toppings added for a small charge.  If you order a slice, it is tossed into the oven for a couple minutes and you are good to go.  Full pizza's start at $17.  Guest's of the hotel can place an order through room service.   Feeling thirsty?  They have PBR  and Dogfish Ale on tap.    The people who work here are great.  Real pizza artist's with personality.    Check this place out!  It's convenient, inexpensive and open late night until after Marquee Nightclub closes.",

This place is \"hidden\" inside Cosmo but it's pretty obvious when people are constantly walking in and out some hallway with slices of boxes of pizza.   The decor is pretty cool and there's a pinball machine in the corner. The seating is pretty limited but none of that matters because you're here for one and one thing only, their pizza. It's pretty good pizza, NY style thin crust that's reasonably large. It's quite expensive (like most things in vegas, also you're in Cosmo) for each slice and a whole pie. I've done it both ways multiple times and just get what you need. If you're going to feed a large group and can agree on flavors, just spring for the whole pizza instead of getting slice by slice which will definitely be more expensive.   The reason why it's only 3 stars because it's A-OK for what it's supposed to be, quick pizza. One star is off for the price, and the other because of the RIDICULOUS wait sometimes. I've had them quote 2.5 hours for a whole pie, or you're waiting for like 30 minutes in line in heels after clubbing for pizza because surprise! everyone is drunk and hungry and need carbs ASAP just like you and had the same bright idea. My advice, plan ahead and better.",

Someone else in our group decided to wear men's shoes too vs going barefoot.  Smart choice. .  The pizza slices are huge, they equal 2!  Worth all the calories... and it's a lot! We wanted pepperoni and lucky us it just came fresh out of the oven.  We always order an extra one to go... and when you're really hungry..just. call right when you get in line and order a whole pizza. It'll be ready by the time you get to the front.

    "text": "I ended up coming to Secret Pizza as someone had recommended it to my cousin and he wanted to try the place out. Secret Pizza is on the third level of the Cosmopolitan inside a small alley sandwiched between two other places whose names I don't remember. Secret Pizza is more like a take away stand with a handful of barstool type seats along the wall to eat your pizza. The menu is simple, basically New York style thin crust pizza that is sold by the slice (~$6). There are basically two types of pies that you can get the regular peperoni pizza which has the regular red sauce or the white pizza which basically uses ricotta & mozzarella cheese as the base. We decided to get a whole three topping white pizza (~$40) and went with meatballs, half peperoni and half mushrooms. After this it was a 15 minute wait in which time the pie was freshly baked and come out piping hot.  Upon receiving the pie the first thing I noticed is that it was pretty big but the toppings were sparse covering only 65% of the pizza leaving a large outer crust bare. As soon as I picked up the first slice it was clear that it was extremely oily. I've eaten pizza's in NY so I was expecting a little grease but this was way too oily and not in a good way. The pizza itself was great. I don't like super crispy crusts that result from overcooking thin crust pizza's so I was happy that this crust had the right amount of flexibility that allowed you to eat the slice by gently folding it. The ricotta & mozzarella cheese base was excellent and had the perfect amount of seasoning. Unfortunately a tiny amount is put on very much like the other toppings. Pricewise I felt that it was relatively more expensive when compared to other joints on the strip even after giving it the Vegas Strip plus large Casino handicap especially looking at the miniscule amount of toppings.  One last comment would be that this place is super popular and is a testament to word of mouth that spreads by social media. In the 25 minutes that we spent eating the pie on the 3rd floor lobby we were approached by no less than 6 parties asking us for the precise location of secret pizza. Anyway I doubt that I will return for a super expensive slice of above average pizza.",

    "text": "Nestled on the third floor of the charming Cosmopolitan, Secret Pizza is the food equivalent of Platform 9 3/4.  Slice for slice, Secret Pizza is probably my favorite Vegas institution (over the traditional staples such as Earl's, Pink's, etc.) to visit for all my late night fatty indulgences.    Secret Pizza delivers the quintessential New York style slice: a sparing amount of zesty sauce and cheese without an abundance of toppings. The crust is thin and crispy while the base holds up well for folded consumption rapidly.  You should probably order at least two slices.  I've gone so far as ordering 4 slices at once and even a whole pie.  The variety of slices differs by the day.  If you want something that isn't featured on the display, you'll need to go ahead and order a pie.  Always order it with a beer.  My addiction is out of hand.  I once left Hakkasan early just so I could beat the lines and get my hands on these slices (wait times around 2-3 am are approximately 30-45 minutes). On most trips, I'll go at least once.  Other times, I'll venture here two or three times.  When I stayed at the Cosmopolitan for my birthday, I had it three times in one day.  I know - I'm one sick puppy.",

They have everything you need as far as toppings (adding ranch would be a sin) and serve beer as well to pair along. I can still taste the flavor as I type this.. Line or not - this is worth your time and at a fair value at that! Next time I come I'm  grabbing a whole pie to myself while the world judges me.",

    "text": "Why so many 5 star reviews? I guess there are a lot of people who have never had a good slice or they were all so hammered that they thought it was the greatest thing to happen to them. This place is average at best. It is like a glorified Sbarro or Villa pizza. It's salty and greasy. There is a little amount of sauce, which it should for this type of pizza, but lacked the flavor punch needed to really put it above other pizza spots. There was a good amount of cheese and the crust is cooked pretty well; crunchy but airy. It did satisfy my craving for pizza being outside of Chicago, but by no means was a it a game-changer in my book. As you can tell, it isn't so much a secret anymore. This sucks because you will wait a decent amount of time on prime dining and late night hours, but it's good that you're guaranteed a fresh meal. Check it out just to say you did.",

The pizza itself was average, but I found the \"hunt\" aspect interesting. Absolutely no signage and had to rely on review photos to find it.  They had about 6 pizzas out on the counter and heated you up a slice when you ordered.  Very limited seating inside, but the Cosmo hotel has seating outside of the non-descript hallway that is the entrance.",

    "text": "The first rule of Secret Pizza...you talk about Secret Pizza! This retro themed throwback parlor is located right next to the brand new \"Blue Ribbon Pizza\" on the 3rd floor. It's easy to walk past since there's is no signage, no door and it barely even smells! But you know you're close when you see phantom pizza slices on paper plates wandering around.   There usually is a line, so expect a wait, but don't worry, it moves pretty quickly. This is largely because your options are somewhat limited: Cheese, Bianca, Pepperoni, Supreme, Meatlovers. Though you do have the ability to add your own toppings for a charge and can buy by the slice (~5.00+) or by the pie. For a group, definitely order a whole pie...and don't forget the napkins, cuz you'll need 'em!   It's not the greatest pizza in the world, but it's still delicious and reasonably priced! The fun is in finding/knowing the location and it's just about the only place in the Cosmo where you can get a late (or late-late) night munchie without the fuss of sit-down table service. In fact, seating is very limited...a few high top stools and that's about it. So, unless you can snag the couches directly across from the entrance, you're better off going back to your room, or around the corner (towards the convention hall) and sitting there to snack.",

If you want a slice they do have some already made ones one the counter. You pick your choice and they will reheat it for you in the oven then you're good to go. I think the prices are standard for Las Vegas. Drinks also are excellent for the location (Las Vegas). We ordered a whole pie and it's only once size (large) but it's the way to go for a few people and also cheaper. It takes awhile to bake but it's well worth it. Limited seating inside but there are plenty of seating outside the pizza place. It's in the Cosmopolitan on the third level and pretty easy to find. Try it, you'll love it!",

Perfectly toasted with garlic and ricotta.  Definitely recommend the Sicilian slices as well. Best I have had!!! They usually make it around 3PM.   Exceptional service every time.

We stopped by last night around 11 pm and the line was pretty long, we waited for about 20-30 minutes. I ordered a cheese and pepperoni pizza, the pizza is a thin crust NY-style pizza. I liked the thin crispiness of the crust and dough but the garlic flavor was incredibly strong-- I'm a garlic lover but it was so strong it overpowered the sauce.   Pretty pricey at $5.25 a slice and 50 cents for additional toppings and $4 for a cup of soda, but it was worth it to try at least one time, and also a plus that it's open so late.",

Line was to the entrance, but everyone sais it was worth the wait. First of all, it was five in our group, so we want 2 pizzas. The pizza guys were super nice and laid back...the busyness didn't seem to phase them...menu is super simple. We ordered one white and one pepperoni. Those pizzas were humongous!!! 10 slices in each, we were in over our head!! But they were very delicious, worth the wait!!!

We had slices of the famous white pizza and ones of the regular cheese. Both were good but the white pizza was different for me. It tasted great with the ricotta cheese and mozzarrella. Get that for sure. The regular slices we had with pepperoni. Big NY style slices.  Even on a non-crazy busy night here, we still had to wait for the white pizza do be done baking. Otherwise you are left to choose from what they have at the ready. Good stuff. I liked it. Service was indifferent.    Standing room only. Take your pizza outside or stand inside if there is space along the wall. Pick your pizza. Slice or whole. Pick your toppings. Wait. Eat.",

My hubs wanted to go back... ended up getting matching tattoos with my friends as a tribute to our trip... almost was a pizza in honor of our trip looking for secret pizza!!! But at last minute went with something else lol...",

    "text": "Okay. So I'd like to start this off by saying I was a little drunk when we came here so it's possible my extremely positive review is dictated by that. But still.   I had one of those classic Vegas nights out with a group of friends, clubbing and dancing, took one too many shots, and by the end of the night, we ended up here. One of my friends is a frequent Vegas-goer and knew this was THE late night pizza joint to go to, even if it required a separate Lyft drive over.   The line was long and it was pretty late at night, maybe 3am. You can order a slice or a whole pie. I got a slice immediately (no patience and I had to see what all the hype was about) and then we ordered two large pizzas - one cheese, one pepperoni. We waited about 20 minutes until the pizzas were ready, sitting out in an area of the hotel.   My first bite. Pure pizza perfection. I think my friends told me I almost cried tears of joy while eating it. I seriously think I did most of the damage to that large pizza and I have no shame. Based on my memories, best pizza I've ever had. I will definitely revisit this place in the future when I'm in Vegas and need some late night pizza goodness.  COME HERE.",

Also, it's between Blue Ribbon and Jaleo. :p  The NY look definitely brought back memories of my trip to New York from last year.  The prices for the pizza are rather expensive for a New York style pizza, but I figured it had to be adjusted for Las Vegas, so that's understandable.  With that said, I was fine with it, really.  I grabbed a slice of the White Pizza, and it was delicious.  Oily, but still great.  Luckily there was a small line, so the wait wasn't as long as I thought it was going to be on a week night.  Overall though, it's perfectly acceptable for late night pizza, especially when under the influence of alcohol.",

I think that a lot of the reviews hype this place up a bit too much, either that or a lot of these people have never really had NY style pizza IN New York.  That said, it's good, especially for NY style pizza, outside of NY. However, it's far from great, and it's on par for other Vegas pizza joints.    The crust was far too crunchy, rather that that perfect crust for the fold it in half True NY pizza experience, I think if I had folded it in half it probably would've just snapped. The cheese and grease level were perfect however.  The slices are HUGE, which they should be for $4.50 for plain cheese.  Definitely a great find, and good pizza, but if you're from NY, like me, don't go in expecting the best pizza you've ever had and you'll certainly have a much better experience.",

    "text": "When I meet out-o-towners at Book & Stage and (many drinks later) they inevitably tell me they could go for a snack, you can bet I've known all along where to take them. We're going to Pizza.   [As a side note, I don't call this place \"Secret Pizza\" because 1) it's no secret any longer, 2) the take-away menu has a big black circle on the front and the word \"Pizza\" in white letters and 3) because I love such a generic name. I swear if I owned a restaurant, I'd name it \"Food\" or \"Eat\"]  As long as you know where the 3rd floor pool tables are or where Blue Ribbon Sushi is, you can find it. You're going to experience a style and aura here that you just don't see often. The wall of record covers and the Galaga machine are my favorite touches. Well, they are really the only two touches. I've tried to make it to the top of the Galaga score board but for some reason none of the scores stick.  Now for the pizza: It's New York style and it's ricotta and it's foldable and it's soft on the inside with a perfect crunch on the bottom and it's cheap and it's marvelous drinking food. Every slice is unique and has character. Just like New Yorkers! My favorite is the white pizza. I can deal with deli meats any other day of the week, but when a white sauce and cheese can stand alone that well, then I dedicate myself to it. Just don't make the mistake I did one tipsy night and pound the garlic shaker over your white pizza thinking it's parmesan. You and anyone you kiss will reek of garlic for 2 days.  I give it 4 stars because: 1) The service isn't outstanding. For a $4 slice of pizza and PBR on tap you really can't expect Ritz service, but sometimes these guys look like they're going to go either comatose or Angry Birds on you. 2) When it's busy, you won't find a seat. There's more counter space than stools. (Do you think that was a coincidence? I think not.) You're best to go in with your friends, buy a whole pizza, and bring it out to the couches near the pool tables. Everyone else will see your tempting whole pizza with no name on the box and wonder where you got it. Let them in on it if you so choose....",

I don't know what is going on in Vegas but I don't just tip for the hell of it. I earn my money... so should you.

It made for a wonderful almost-drunk adventure. I had been here once before (many years ago) but I think back then I was too wasted to remember where it was. Actually, it's pretty easy to find, though describing the exact location in my Yelp review seems to defy the whole point of visiting Secret Pizza, so I won't divulge.  The staff who works here are super nice for people who have to deal with drunk hungry people all the time. Well, that's my assumption, but we were here on a Monday night so perhaps the crowd was more time. I ordered two slides, one of the white pizza and the other with pepperoni and mushrooms. It was too much for me to eat, but I knew one slide would be too little. I was satisfied by the hot and fresh pizza nevertheless! So glad that my friend and I decided to come here. Such a simple meal and a must-try in Vegas.",

Open until 4am, Secret Pizza is constantly producing hot pies as the line moves along. Some folks ordered slices and others opted for whole pizzas. The meat lovers looked relatively fresh. After a brief stint in the oven, I took a bite of the pepperoni, sausage, and meatball slice ($6.25). I could see the grease dripping down and with each bite, I could feel my arteries clogging. But, I kept eating as it was just so good. The best part was the soft and chewy crust.  Yes, it's a little gimmicky but the pizza is actually good. There are no frills about this place. Drinks are served in red plastic cups and there are a few stools under the counters.",

We entered through this long hallway covered in album covers. Long story short, we ordered couple of slices of cheese pizza. At $5 a slice(cheese only), it was a deal! The thin slices came out in minutes. I think I ate it faster than it took for them to make it!   The slices are thin, almost airy. The crust was tasty and not soggy. The sauce was good and not overloaded with it. I could easily eat two slices but had to visit another eatery located at the Cosmo, so I had to save room!  IMHO, nothing stood out like it should be worth more than three stars?! Heck, add meat? Extra veggies? From the taste of the sauce and crust, no matter what you add, the pizza would still be three stars for me?!",

Not to mention this place half cooks the pie and leaves it out and reheats it when you order it.

Staff was really friendly and even suggested we get a pie instead of ordering slices as there was 4 of us (probably would have figured it out on our own but its nice to know they weren't trying to pinch us for every penny).  Did I mention that it had that \"aroma\"? You know, the aroma of a genuine pizza place? If you are from New York, you know about the \"aroma\". I was sold the second I started walking down that entrance way.  Pizza was very good and the ingredients were quality. No joke, but some of the best tasting pepperoni I have ever had. We had a half white, half pepperoni pie.  Only downfall for me was that the middle of the pie got a bit soggy. Maybe it was the type of pie we ordered, I don't know. But outside of that, I was extremely pleased and despite the price tag (around 25 bucks) it's worth it for good quality product.",

I'm in search of the best pizza!  or like my mom says... peekza.  I been to chicago, miami, new york...  and a bunch of other places.  I got a decent basis for judging pizza. So everytime i go any where i order a pepperoni and then whatever special...  now...  The pizza was average.  The cheeses were not high grade and you can tell because a high quality cheese will melt evenly and you won't see too much of a cut between the oil and the cheese.  This pizza had pockets of oil... so instantly i knew it was a midgrade cheese.  In new york, (which doesn't have the best pizza by the way but are top contenders) they throw chunks of mozarella...  they look like little mcnuggest and boom...  you get this sexy cheese spread.  And no pockets of oil...    The sauce wasn't knock your socks off good...  but it was decent.  Not too sweet. a little on the thin side for me...  But it was a decent slice.  What killed it is the price.  I paid for two slices and a can of orange crush 15 bucks.  I was like... for serious?  Add it to room 1159...   it didn't work no registered guess in that name.  oh well.  So i dish out my card... cry a little bit.  then eat my pizza.",

The wait is always excruciating because once that scent of that damn pizza hits your damn nose you just want to gobble a slice whole right then and there, BUT BE PATIENT you'll get to the front of the line eventually :)",

Only come here if you really want pizza and are really drunk because after the club, this place is chaos and with a 20 minute line, you're going to be waiting for a while. Unless you order a slice but at $5/slice when a whole pizza is $20, who would do that? Not this cheap bastard.  It must have taken me near 40 minutes to get the whole pizza I ordered. On both days I came here. But, yea, it was worth it, because where else in Las Vegas can you get a whole pep at 3 am in the morning without walking around the strip?  Though if you're really in a hurry, Vegas follows the CREAM (cash rules everything around me) rule. But you're going to be paying $20 on top of $20 if you want to bypass the line.",

    "text": "A clever idea and much easier to find than many would have you believe, Secret Pizza at The Cosmopolitan is one of those places that seems to get a lot of praise from all the wrong sorts of people yet curious to experience it myself and without dinner plans until 8pm I decided to stop in for a snack while shopping Crystals.  A small place with a TV and a couple of pinball machines plus the slice counter down a long hall of records the restaurant was perhaps half full when I arrived and with three pizzas ready to serve my choice was simplified dramatically when a fresh Roma and Ricotta emerged from the oven as I was waiting in line.  Friendly in service and low in price for a hefty slice with excellent ingredient quality I've heard many compare Secret to New York slice shops and while the foldable structure and gas oven production is similar I'll simply say that anyone making such claims is a fool - most New York Slice shops are serving low quality ingredients on a subpar crust for ninety-nine cents while Secret is serving top quality sauce without unnecessary sweetness under smooth mozzarella on a crust with a good crunch, great chew, and an excellent crumb.  Admittedly bummed that they were completely sold out of canolis that are, alas, pre-filled but still something I'd like to try I've no doubt I'll head back for the square slice sometime soon.",

Very low key old school vibe, reinforced by the pinball machine and old school arcade machine.   The pizza here is great, if your planning on feeding 3 or more people (or two very hungry people) I would recommend just buying an entire pizza, they make it right in front of you and is way more cost effective.   The service and attitude of the employees is great, which is good because of the six times I went there, I was drunk twice and DRUNK once and they still put up with me.   They have a small beer selection as well which consists of PBR (yuck) and dogfishhead IPA (yum), and I believe their menu even has a entry that says \"slice and a beer\" or something to that nature.  Overall, a great place to start or a end a long night.",

The guy behind the counter prepping the pizzas was nice enough - explained how things worked without a condescending tone.  The girl helping out new to the operation, so there was a bit of a learning curve on keeping things going.  No problem; I've been in the same situation.    However, once the pizza went into the oven for re-heating and the money was in the register, that about ended an otherwise okay experience.  I swear it took like 20 minutes to get our 3 slices.  3 SLICES.  Another guy took over the pizza-making duties and made it his priority to only check up on the full pizza orders.  So when our slices finally came out, they were burnt at the crusts and essentially crackers at the base.  I told my fiance that I was not eating my ONE slice, he had to bring it back and ask for another slice (I told him to take his back too, but he was too nice to do so).  Another slice of margherita pizza that had been sitting there for quite some time that they could just throw into the oven for reheating.  I was really disappointed that they even gave us the pizza burnt - who serves burned pizza?!  That's already been cooked once?  We should've just gone down to Fashion Show Mall and had a few slices at Sbarro for a fraction of the price.  I guess if you want average pizza in a pretentious setting masquerading as hole-in-the-wall (literally) joint, this could be heaven.  Next time I'll check out their burger joint or that Chinese/Mexican food fusion place down the way.",

The sauce and cheese are good quality, the crust and dough was to hard. We did go in the afternoon on an off time, so the pizza may have not been that fresh.  I read how everybody is a pizza expert because they are either Italian or from New York, well being an Italian from the Bronx, I don't expect NY quality pizza from anywhere else other then NY. And I understand I was on the strip so I was willing to get ripped off price-wise but 25 dollars for 4 slices(two sicilians/ two regular) of left over pizza.

The staff is always friendly and fast, even when we order full pizzas at a time, and the prices are reasonable! My girlfriend always gets the sausage pizza, and I get the pepperoni, and even though we agree it tastes the best late at night after a night on the town, it tastes just as good as a snack right when we arrive from Los Angeles for a fun weekend in Vegas!

    "text": "Yes they make the pizzas there in front of you. Had I ordered a fresh pizza I am sure this would have went up to 5 stars. I was a bit put off by the slice selection. You pick your slice off a cold pizza that has been cooked. Then they put it back in the oven to reheat it. Ok I want fresh pizza!!!! I am not sure how long it was sitting there. It had some meat options but the same meat on 2 out of handful of options. One was plain cheese so maybe more of a variety wouldn't hurt. No place to really sit unless your by yourself or at most 2 people. I think I saw 5 sitting stools. The good, it was greasy. That's good for me because if I am going to eat pizza I want some flavor and these have flavor. I would go back but if I was buying a whole pizza. Also this is very hard to find, just make sure to ask someone working in the hotel and look at the pictures some people posted as a guide. One I saw the wall of pictures I knew I was there.",

Like garlic? I hope you do because this place seems to have a serious garlic obsession. But beyond that it's just ordinary but strip priced pizza that's really nothing special. If you're stuck on the strip and don't know where else to go and you're craving a slice this will work. But if you have the time to go anywhere else, skip the line and do so.

Once you see a hallway filled with pictures of album covers follow your nose straight ahead to the scent of the pizza! We went at 6pm on a Saturday night and this place was super busy. They have a very limited selection of pizza and beer including Bud Light on draft. Cheese pizza starts at $5 a slice and you can add more toppings if you wish. You can also order a whole pizza. They have a small standing bar area with two stools so there is not an adequate seating area to sit down and eat. Pizza is NY style with big, foldable slices. The crust is chewy and delicious. Give it a try!!",

It is LITERALLY a hole in the wall though, there's no giant sign to direct you there. There's an alley way inside the cosmopolitan that leads you to the little pizza store. Luckily the line wasn't too ridiculous. They have a variety of pizza to choose from and you can make your own too. My friends and I each got two slices, one white each thanks to my friend's recommendation and one pepperoni, one sausage and peperoncino, and another sausage one.  The slices were huge, like Costco pizza slices, definitely filling enough, 2 each killed us. 1.5 each would of satisfied us just fine. The white pizza was great. It was a variety of cheeses I believe and normally I hate crumbly cheese like feta but whatever was on that pizza was delicious. It was a bit oily but what good pizza isn't. We came here for lunch but it's opened super late which is great for late night Vegas munchies! I used to always go to earls but now I know the Vegas secret ! I'll be back for more secret pizza!   Note: there isn't much sitting space since it's a small store. Usually it's a grab and go, we took our pizza and ate on the couches outside!",

There are pies constantly coming out of the ovens, so if you don't see one you like, chances are it's cooking.

We wanted something quick since we were starving from the long plane ride from the east coast. So the place wasn't that hard to find. Although we didn't see it advertised in the building anywhere. We did know which floor it was on so that helped. We both got meat lovers slices. Pepperoni,sausage,and meatball. It looked delicious as you can see. It was a little greasy so we did the paper towel dab to get some off. It Was cooked medium crispy which is great. The taste was pretty good. Nothing amazing but had good flavor. We both enjoyed it.

Hearing about this place and seeing the hype this pizza place has gotten, we definitely needed to try it. First thing notable is the line. Expect to wait in a line during major meal hours. We waited about 20-30 minutes. It helps that there are vintage record covers decorating the wall. (How retro...?) Any who, right before you meet the counter you will finally see the menu on the top right. Pretty simple - 1 topping is $5 and then more toppings equals higher and higher prices. Well I got the sausage and pepperoncinis and my mom got the mushroom and cheese. Total was about $13. We wanted a drink but didn't feel like paying $4 for a Solo cup-sized soda. Also didn't feel like buying a mini water bottle for $1.50. So finally we ate our pizzas. It was good...But that's about it. Nothing special, nothing out of the ordinary. I realized this was just another hyped up place that was overpriced but perfectly hip for the young people. If you want to pay for overpriced pizza and soda then that's cool. But I will not go back nor recommend it to anyone back in Hawaii. We've tasted better.",

This pizza is exactly what you need in the middle of the night before passing out or rallying before hitting up another club. It is pretty pricey for one slice, but whatever, it is Vegas Strip. I will be coming here for every Vegas trip from now on because its just the kind of place that you have to hit up.",

    "text": "Cheesey pizza?  Check.  Crispy and chewy crust?  Check and Check.  An outrageous amount of delicious grease?  Check that too.  I ordered one slice each of pepperoni and white pizza.  Both were good.  The pepperoni pizza reminded me a lot of what I get back home only with more cheese.  It was good and very hot.  I burned my mouth on that first bite.  Bummer.  Then came my slice of white pizza.  White sauce and a mixture of cheeses make this a very rich slice of pie.  I thoroughly enjoyed it while eating it but it did leave an off putting after taste in my mouth.  I can't quite place it.  It was almost floral.  Maybe it was the basil or something in the ricotta cheese.  I don't really know.  At least it was good while I ate it.  I also ordered a cup of Coke.  The grand total for this cheese feast was $14.  Seriously!?  For two slices of pizza and a Coke?  It seems high to me. That being said, given its location in one of the most high end places on the Las Vegas Strip, I should expect nothing less.  The pizza is good.  Not $5 per slice good but they have you right where they want you and you are at their mercy.  Or lack there of.  And for that I give them props for a sucessful business plan.  Given the popularity and the long line to get a slice of pie, I think a more apt name for this place would be \"Not So Secret Pizza.\"  Though I did have to ask where it was.  So maybe it is still a little bit of a secret.",

    "text": "Pizzeria at The Cosmopolitan nails my very favorite kind of pizza. It's slices as big as your head in New York fashion but the crust is thin and crispy the way I lurve it instead of doughy and chewy. I had my own slice of white pie that I gobbled up so fast Sir Nicholas barely had time to ask if he could have a bite to try it. But, he managed to squeeze in his request. And since he sampled a bite of my slice it was only fair he gave me a bit of his pepperoni, which I enjoyed just as much as my own.  There are like 4 seats inside here so you're probably taking your pie somewhere else to eat it. But, you can play old school video games while you wait like Galaga so that's pretty sweet.  They also sell a few beers and wines next to the sodas, but we went with Orange Fanta all the way when we stopped in for sustenance.   People working here are fast and friendly and this is a great place to stop in for quick, easy eats before you head off to the next run of good fortune, shopping, or general merrymaking in Vegas.",

My favorite slice is probably the jalapeno and pepperoni, a spicy concoction that makes my mouth feel alive.  But, every single  one of the slice choices I've tasted have been quite good.   I love getting a slice and sitting in the lounge area in front of the restaurant. The cool Mad Men furniture, the pool table, as well as the great people watching make this a great space to eat amazing pizza.  Secret pizza is sorrounded by several shi shi restaurants, as well as a cool art gallery, so there's plenty to check out. (My favorite people watching experience there was seeing some dude roll up on a Sunday afternoon in his white bathrobe and slippers, carrying his newspaper, walking around the crowded lounge like he was in his living room...)  Is it pricey for pizza?  Yes it is. But the quality more than makes up for it. It's one of the places I absolutely make sure to visit when I come to Vegas.",

You go down a random hallway and it opens up to what looks like a pizza joint in NYC.  no menu, no anything.

Well, after a few texts back and forth, they weren't coming and we were already in line to try this pizza, so hey, how about we buy a whole pizza and bring it back to the house?  Sure!  We ordered a whole pie - standard pizza - half with pepperoni and half just plain cheese.  I had some of both - the sauce, the cheese, the dough.  SO GOOD.  If you want to attract some drunks and crazies, just walk through the Cosmo and out on to the strip to Planet Hollywood (which is where are car was parked)  We got a lot of \"I'll give you a dollar for a slice\" and \"where did they get that pizza\"  We all enjoyed the pizza, and I'll definitely be back to the random place inbetween two restaurants when I'm in vegas later this month.",

What is said about the WHITE PIZZA is right... the cheese was flavorful and bold, the dough was perfectly crisp and the crust, my favorite part, was extraordinary.  I also purchased a slice of pepperoni and although the dough and crust were just as good as the white, the pepperoni and cheese was very normal on this slice.  If I did it again, it'd be an entire WHITE PIE... which FYI is $27.00 dollars.... lol, I know it's good but still that's a PRICEY pizza.  When your'e in Vegas though, who cares! $4.50 a slice is relative :)  Service was exceptional as well, the servers behind the counter handle the slices w/ care and are extremely accommodating and fast despite the acknowledged stress that comes with a large line.

But, on the day I was leaving Las Vegas I wanted something quick and filling to hold me over until I got back to Phoenix and I hunted this place down.  I guess when The Cosmopolitan first opened it was fun finding this \"hidden\" place. But, the word it out and other yelpers have even posted photos of the hallway to look for.  However, if you aren't paying attention and maybe you're a bit hung over it would be possible to walk right past it.  They mostly serve pizza by the slice with a number of selections available so you can go in, order, eat, and leave.  They'll also make you a pie but you'll have to wait for it.  The pizza is NY style and it was excellent! By Las Vegas standards, not too expensive. Great spot for a good casual meal off the beaten path.",

We came around 1015 pm on a Sunday night, waited 15 minutes, and placed an order for two pies with an additional wait time of 30 minutes. We also added the house pickled peppers for a $1.   30 minutes later, we sat down outside of the restaurant on the couches to a white pie and a meatball/roasted tomato/olive pizza. The crust was semi crisp but also a little bready for a thin crust pizza. The white pie had a light garlic topped with seasoned and herby ricotta dollops. The three combo pizza was straight forward although the meatballs weren't anything to get excited over. And the peppers? They came in a little condiment  cup with more liquid than peppers. Although tasty (slightly sweet but had a nice bite of acid), it is definitely not worth spending $1 for it.   Worth the hype and the surprisingly pretentious staff? Heck no.

It's hard to beat $5/slice on the strip! $22 for the whole pie!  You can find this pizza place inside The Cosmopolitan. There is no sign. There is no name. Just a hallway leading to a small room that serves some damn good pizza!  This place really honors the New York style pizza. Thin crust at its finest! I usually don't like eating the crust at the end, but I couldn't get enough of it! There's just enough crust, but their crust is so flavorful. I could eat just a whole pie of that crust!  Their white pizza is the best!! Three different kinds of cheese with no red sauce. Sooooo good! It's like the best cheesy bread you'll ever have! I love the dollops of fresh ricotta that's on it. Their red sauce options are pretty good also, but the white pizza is the best!  By the way, they're open ridiculously late! Totally awesome after a night of drinking at the club! Unfortunately, I didn't find out about this place until the last day of my trip, so I didn't get to taste how freakishly awesome their pizza must taste while drunk.   There's a line here during peak hours! But the wait is toooootally worth it!",

    "text": "Tip. If your leaving the club and craving some pizza and you think \"Hey...I think it might be fun to go find secret pizza\" and you haven't went back to your hotel to take your heels off....go sit down evaluate your life and try again. My friends and I were leaving some club at MGM and we considered taking a cab to the cosmopolitan wouldn't be too bad so we can go grab some of this infamous pizza. MAN!! First tell the driver what side of the hotel to drop you off on (I believe SP is on the east side of the hotel we got dropped off on the west, correct me if I'm wrong) after a trip on the escalator and a ride on the elevator we finally got to the floor. As soon as you hit the 3rd floor you smell pizza and lovely garlic aromas but you can't see where it's coming from. So like hounddogs in stilettos we painfully inched to this secluded hallway and found the motherland.   It felt like a piece of NY in Vegas. I ordered a vegetarian pizza (only because my feet were hurting I was impatient and didn't feel like waiting for a pepperoni to be cooked) and it was worth every step I took to get there. The service was fast and prompt.  The pizza was gooey and greasy and cheesy. The slices were huge for five bucks. Definitely coming back!! (Next time in flats)",

Once I got my two slices i went outside since  there was no place to sit and I was in pizza heaven. This pizza was the perfect combination of sauce, cheese and crispy crust.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying the pizza is really good.  I cannot take that away from them.  Their service however, will leave you VERY FRUSTRATED.  My family and I have taken the drive down there twice now, both times they screwed up the order.  The first time they left off one of the toppings we paid for.  We had already left when I realized they left one of the toppings off the pie and didn't want to return to get it fixed.  The second time, they did the same thing with 2 toppings.  Normally I'd say $hit happens but after seeing others complain about the same thing, they either have really bad quality control issues or they intentionally do it to rack up extra revenue for ingredients they do not plan on giving to the customer that paid for it.  The second time really took the cake and made me question whether or not I will return.  They left two toppings off the pie.  So I brought it to their attention and they offered to replace the pie.  Sounds good, right?  They even offered to give us a few slices to tide us over until they made another pie. They handed me the first wrong pie and a few slices and said it would be another 20 minutes.   They are always super busy, so that would take another 20+ minutes.  This is after we already stood in line for 30 minutes and another 20+ minutes to make the first pie.  So now at this point, we have waited for 50+ minutes for the wrong order and would have to wait another 20+ minutes.  Since they offered to replace the pie and gave us a few slices to tide us over, I felt compelled to wait and get what I paid for.  So we waited in the pool table area outside of the hallway you walk down to get to the pizza counter.  And waited, and waited and waited some more.  After getting frustrated it was taking so long, I went back inside to see what the holdup was.  I had to wait until the girl behind the counter had a lull in traffic to get access to her.  When I asked when the pie would be ready, she says \"Oh, I gave you the slices and the other pie.  That was it.\"  So why would you tell me it is going to be another 20 minutes to wait, if you weren't making me another pie?  VERY FRUSTRATING!!!!!!!  At this point we had been waiting for about 105 minutes for our correct order and I didn't have enough patience to sit around and argue with them.  So we left.  Should we go back?  We do dig their pizza but the service is so crappy that I don't think the trip down there, parking on the strip, schlepping our way through the casino just to get good pizza and BAD service is worth the headache.  There are plenty of good pizza joints in town.  It's a shame they treat their patrons like that.  Oh well",

Ok...fiiiiine, keep an eye out for the album-filled hallway on the third floor. We stopped by around 3pm, so there was no line, although all the seats were taken.  We selected a cheese slice topped with ricotta and sliced sausage and a cheese slice with meatballs and onions. I thought it was a little pricey for two slices with two toppings each.  I guess I'm just not used to paying $4.50-$5.00 a slice. The pizza was really really good. The crispy crust was slightly charred, adding a touch of bitterness to the sweetness of the crust and savoriness of the topping. Loved. Every. Bite. The toppings were really good. Especially the sausage. House-made?  Water cooler near the register for those feeling a bit dehydrated from too much sun or whatever. Nice touch. :)  BF received a call from his friend looking for Secret Pizza....if a sober local guy needed help finding it, gawd help the drunk!  The front of their paper menus just say \"pizzeria\". :)",

From reading other reviews, it really just sounds like you can get pizza like this from literally anywhere else. Like costco, or even make your own at Blaze?? Anyways, if you're in the cosmopolitan and want a cheaper food option, I guess this is the place to go compared to other restaurants they have nearby, but it's not worth going out of your way for. The biggest cons are the long line just to order (always call ahead for pickup!!) otherwise you'll be dealing with hungry and sometimes rude tourists in line and one slice of pizza is over $5! Eh, yeah if I'm craving pizza that bad, I'll just go somewhere else. Don't get me wrong, their pizza actually tastes good, but with all the hassle it takes just to order a simple pizza, this place is not worth it.",

Go with the OG pepperoni pizza and throw some dried red pepper, parm, garlic pepper and bam you got yourself a drunk slice of pizza that will satisfy you for a couple of hours until you find something else to eat.

It's good pizza for the average drunk person or someone looking for the something quick that isn't fried. It's bread is cardboardish. It's stiff and the crust is too hard to chew even though it's not what I would consider a thin slice of pizza. Cheese is saltier then it should be and sauce is less than should be on a slice. If barstool was ranking this Pizza he would give it a 3.0.",

    "text": "Now this is novelty idea, a \"Secret\" pizza place known only by word of mouth. This is a pizza restaurant located on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan. You can easily pass this by since there is no sign or advertising on the directory but if you pay close enough attention to people sitting down and eating pizza nearby then you will know that this \"secret\" pizza is not as secret as you'd thought it would have been.   There is no sit down seating here, only standing room since the restaurant is very small. I guess since its open till 5am on most days that it is a perfect place to grab some cheap drunk food when everything is else is closed. Thankfully the queue moves smoothly and quickly as they have premade pizzas already and simply just heat back up in the oven.   Staff is friendly and efficient. As for the pizza itself, it is pretty decent. Large slices priced around $5-6. I'd imagine if you were starving in the middle of the night then this pizza would taste fantastic but as a regular meal I would prefer pizza somewhere else such ad Grimaldis.   3.5 stars",

I was happy that got chance finally check out the hype. I know tradition says order by the slice. Since there was three of us. We just ordered whole pizza. Think if you were breakdown the cost per slice paying more for whole pie. We were hungry besides leftover pizza ranks up there next too asian leftovers for me. We got sausage and pepperoni. It was awesome. I like the dough thin crust style. The sauce was solid, sausage and pepperoni tasty, and overall good pie. You can make up your own pie, We just based ours on one of the four or five that can order slice from. They also serve salads but come on now got come here for the pizza. They also serve beer they have two choices on tap and couple bottle beers. We went with gooseneck IPA. Nice beer and good pizza talking about the good life.   As you walking down the famous hallway to no where. Hint maybe that the secret of it! LOL!!!! The old school vinyl albums covers the walls is very very cool. Just the fact that no sign in the whole Cosmo that tells you or guides you to Secret Pizza. Personality. Once get to the end the hall just tiny pizza place. Not really a table to sit down. Just bar stools and counter that eat your slice. Again personality! Like!   Secret Pizza not place that would go out of my way get my pizza urge in. If staying in the Cosmo or in the area looking for quick bite Secret Pizza great idea!",

Asked for the famed Sicilian and a meat lover, and a cannoli. The Sicilian was HUGE! There was so much cheese it made a huge tasty blob on my plate. I meant to only eat a bit of everything-especially because I'm lactose intolerant-didn't care, I was in heaven! Many beautiful women admiring my selection- couldn't ask for a better meal in Vegas. The cannoli? I had just been in NYC, made it a point to visit Little Italy and find the 'Best Voted Cannoli'. This one blew it away.  Fast forward to a couple days later (not 3am) I brought my Mom by to show her the amazing pizza that made every pizza I had previous to that day a disappointment. They threw a couple slices back in the oven to warm them up.... ...not the same. It was good, but not as good as fresh. I asked if they had anything fresh- they did. It was 'almost' fresh but much better than the over crispy crust of the reheated pizza.  Pro-tip: Get the Sicilian, FRESH! Get the cannoli, even if you say you will eat half- you'll eat the whole thing, and try the house made pickled peppers. Just do it ;)",

    "text": "While walking around the Cosmopolitan hotel after a long night of partying, clubbing, gambling or lounging around, chances are that you'd probably be hankering for something quick and that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. (And chances are, you may have already lost an arm and a leg at one of the tables).  In probably the worst kept secret about the hotel, Secret Pizza (honestly, I think the place has no official name and \"Secret Pizza\" just sorta became the de facto name over time) offers people from all walks of life a slice of New York styled pizza at reasonable prices in one of the swankier hotels on the Strip.  Located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan and tucked away in the restaurant area (read, baller food court), you'll see a hallway that could pass as a restroom access area. If you smell pizza and you see some old vinyls decorating the walls, you're on the right track. Just keep going and you'll soon be in line for pizza, made available essentially all day. You can also tell you're in the area once you start seeing more people walking or sitting around with pizza on paper plates.  Secret Pizza has a couple pinball machines to keep people preoccupied a bit, as they scarf down that 'za. The quality (particularly of the pepperoni) is pretty damn comparable to New York styled pizza (for all I know, they could have brought some of the water to Las Vegas).  A big slice and a drink can run you just shy of $10 bucks, which isn't bad, considering where you're at. They also serve beer, served in red plastic cups, naturally. After all, you need to keep that party mentality going back at the suite, right?  My only suggestion is that the place consider a wider beer selection and offer glasses to drink out of. There's a considerable difference in drinking beer out of a plastic cup versus drinking out of a glass. Outside of that, I realized that it's the place's secretive location in a nice resort and design that has made it one of the best known places for a late night slice.",

    "text": "The best nights in life are usually the ones that aren't planned. Starting off on one of those nights, my three friends Jerry J., Matt B. and Gracie C. and I hit this place up last night (6/29/11) after we all got off of work. The plan - get dinner and bring it back to Gracie's place at the Veer Towers to play pool.   After a short little walk from Caesar's, Gracie and I walked right on over  - it's right by the pool table on the third story. Jerry offered to buy dinner - buying a whole pizza is definitely the way to go at this joint - $18 for a huge cheese pizza and an extra ridiculous $2.25 per topping. We opted for 1/2 cheese, 1/2 pepperoni which came with 12 slices for $20 plus some change. It's so much cheaper than buying by the slice, but you'd never know because there's no menu.   We sat around for a bit until one of our coworkers showed up with some people while giving them a tour of the place. There definitely isn't enough seating here whatsoever. After about a 15-20 minute wait, we had our pizza. The four of us then made the trek to CVS to pick up some pop and water.  After our trek to CVS and battling the wind, we headed up to the 37th floor of the Veer Tower chow down on the pizza. It had been at least a good half hour since we got our pizza and it was still relatively hot when we opened the box  I've definitely had better pizza. Metro, for one, is super delicious and this doesn't hold a candle to Round Table. Yes, going to a \"secret\" pizza place might be \"cool\" but their pizza is not even remotely close to the \"I'm a fan\" 4 stars or \"As good as it gets\" 5 stars that so many people are giving this place. Novel concept but again, the pizza is meh. The crust is hard. Not chewy, not crispy, but break your teeth hard. That automatically disqualifies it from getting higher than a 3 star. The cheese was okay, but again, not the best any of us had ever had. We all agreed there was definitely better pizza in Vegas.",

    "text": "The first time I had the not-so-secret pizza was in 2011 or 2012 when Marquee first opened up. It is located next to STK inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel. The only reason to go here is after a night of drinking at Marquee, otherwise you can find better elsewhere. I've stayed at the Cosmo many times while in Vegas but I would usually eat at Secret Pizza for the late night munchies. If you ate it sober, you probably wouldn't think it is that good. I honestly think they could put more cheese on their pizza, and I mean double the amount of cheese. I remember I got a slice that almost had more sauce than cheese on it. And the reason I remember the lack of cheese was because we ate there for lunch one time when we were not drinking hehe. And yes it is True they do not have a ranch like some people say. That's too bad because pizza with ranch is so damn good. Also, since there is no seating, grab your pizza slice and head out to the area in between STK and Secret Pizza, there are a bunch of chairs in the middle to sit on if they aren't taken already.  I don't think it is worth waiting in a long ass line just for Secret Pizza, considering you have to find some place to sit. But if the line is short, go for it!",

Lines can be long but they're usually full of pretty friendly people so the wait goes quickly. Grab a slice of two and a stack of napkins to sop up the grease and you've got a tasty (and pretty cheap) snack on the go. A rare thing in Vegas on the strip unless you hit a food court. This is a far better choice in my opinion!",

This is new york style big ass slice pizza type.  I remember it not having any signs throughout the hotel how to get here.  It was just a long hallway with some guys behind the counter with a variety of pizzas ready for the hungry masses.    They didn't have many fresh type pizzas but simply reheated what was pre made and might make a new one if they run low on a certain style.  They had a few places to sit and scarf down your pizza.  I'd say this had to be one or your cheapest late night options late night in LV.  This was especially great and convenient since I was staying in the hotel.  It allowed me to have drinks, pizza and stumble back to my hotel room.",

BUT, I had to try Secret Pizza since the Yelp reviews and my friends said so. After checking it out, this hidden spot at the Cosmo is the bomb-- BEST PIZZA I'VE EVER HAD!  If it's your first time, try the Great White. SOO GOOD! Secret Pizza's thin slice New York style pizzas use fresh ingredients and are made to order. And it's cheap for those of you who ball on a budget.  Secret Pizza's location is actually a secret for those of you first timers. The Cosmo don't have signs that will lead you to it. But all you need to do is go up to the 4th floor and go down a hallway that you can't miss. It's easy access for those leaving Marquee day/night club.  So definitely check it out. Secret Pizza set the new standard for me.",

Great pizza at a reasonable price (about $5/slice plus extra for toppings).  Also got a slice of cheesecake since also wanted something sweet - it was a large piece for about $4.50 but was just OK.

It's also actually pretty good cold(leftovers), the next morning.  This spot definitely has the NYC pizza look/feel with the quick and easy service and the giant-sized slices. There are several different topping combination to choose from.. I usually just go with what my stomach feels for and what looks most appealing at the time.  If you come here late at night, expect a long line. I wouldn't call it a \"secret\" pizza spot anymore if half of the club go there afterwards!  ...if only a Yoshinoya opened on the strip -____-",

There are no signs that point to their location that I knew of. The establishment itself didn't even have a sign upon entering. I found out that they were   LOCATED on the 3rd floor of the cosmo. There is an entrance hallway next to the pool table and escalators. I should have looked on the yelp reviews but I didn't so I just asked a hotel worker.   The ENVIRONMENT was exactly what I expected, SMALL with no tables to sit. They have a counter and that's about it. They do have an arcade machine which kept my son entertained while we waited. This place gets really busy so you will have to take your food to go (Don't know where though) or eat standing up.   The SERVICE was not a good experience.  We were the only ones there at the time we walked in and we had no greeting whatsoever. Then, it took about a couple minutes for someone to even take our order. Next came the over promising. Since I ordered an entire pie, I was told that there was a pie in the oven and it would be about 10 minutes. That pie that was in the oven...you know the one the guy said was for us...well, it did not go to us. Nor did the second pie. On the third pie, we had to go back to the counter and remind them we were still waiting.  Only then did finally we get it. No apology. That is my pet peeve.     The QUALITY of the PIZZA was such a disappointment.  Since there were 5 of us, we just ordered the entire pie because it was a better value. Each slice is about 5 dollars and the entire pie is about 27 dollars depending on which one you get.  Our choice was pepperoni.  I understand that sometimes people can order the wrong item but, in this case, I doubt it would have made any difference.  First, their pizza is thin crust which is fine. I like thin crust pizza but the crust is very soft and limp which made it hard to eat. Kinda like a new yorker but worse..almost uncooked.  It just kept flapping all over the place and going limp just prior to getting in my mouth. Second, it was very very oily. I'm talking about Pizza Hut type sprayed on oil dipped in more oil. I had pizza juice running all over my hands and mouth.  Some of you might like that, which is totally cool but not for me.   I am going to give it two stars though because I don't think I can ever give any pizza joint 1 star. Plus, the employees did speak in a friendly manner. Even though they did not serve us well.  Bottom line is, the name matches perfectly. Nobody should know about this place.",

    "text": "Inside The Cosmopolitan at a 'secret' location, there are no visible signs pointing you to Secret Pizza. However, just look for a line of people that'll lead you up to a counter filled with meaty pizza pies to take away.  They bake pizzas with various toppings - sausage, pepperoni, mushroom, bell peppers, etc. or just plain cheese. You can take slices or request a whole pie with your choice of toppings. You can also add toppings to an existing pre-made pizza, and they'll pop the slice back into the oven for a couple of minutes.   My friends and I opted for the mushroom and pepperoni pizza, with sausage added on and warmed up in the oven. The pizza was tasty, but i think it would have tasted much better had the sausage been an original topping and cooked from the beginning. it didn't have any smokey flavor that I had hoped for.  I mean, this is a decent place to grab a 'quick' bite, if you'll call it that. We waited around 15 minutes to order and then another 5 minutes to get the warmed-up slices. I've honestly had better. Or perhaps my expectations were just too high.",

I've been to this place every time I've been to Vegas since that fateful day we accidentally stumbled into the eclectic hallway with records all over the wall. Seriously, I went to this place every single night the last time I was in town. The wait is always crazy...but I always leave satisfied. If you can get the pizza with sliced meatballs, pepperoni and ricotta you are lucky. Thats my favorite. You can get it with garlic too. Its probably not worth all the time I've wasted waiting in line for a slice...but its a Las Vegas staple for me and my friends. A little on the expensive side but hey, it is on the strip. I will def be back.",

We were pressed for time and needed a quick bite.. we kept walking up the escalator and the info desk told us there's a pizza joint down the dark hallway... and then we all joked.. two guys telling us to go down a sketchy ally.. RIGHT we went anyways.. it's vegas why not?  Pizza was quick and fast, although the worker seemed like she was not happy that day.  They ran out of the combination pizza we saw and she was not about to make anymore so the only \"vegetable\" they had left was a plain mushroom one which is what I got.  It was greasy, but after  a few dabs it was good. The worker also said she didn't have water on tap so we had to pay quite a bit for the water bottle. My friend who is a vegetarian wanted cheese pizza, but she said she was out of that as well and wasn't going to make anymore. She insisted we just buy the more expensive pepperoni and pick it off.  Well it's a good thing my friend isn't strict and that's what we ended up doing, but the girl definitely did not look like she wanted to be working there.  Other than that, it was good, fast, and relatively cheap for vegas. YUM!",

It wasn't as difficult as I thought to find...on 3rd floor, if you see a random long hallway next to a restaurant...huzzah! You have found it!   We got a custom made 3 toppings large pizza to go (~$30), which was super delicious, but the wait for the pizza after ordering was over 35 minutes...so take that into consideration for the entire pie. The roasted tomatoes topping was my favorite part of the pizza...and the crust! Loooooooove pizza crust. The large size was enough to feed 5 of us, plus enough leftovers as pre-clubbing dinner the next day!",

The places with 500+ reviews usually are just places that drunk college aged kids go because they think it's cool.  Then they give it a good review on Yelp because everybody else says it's good.  Well, I am going to say that this place is not deserving of its reviews.  First off, the line is pretty long regardless of when you go.  Secondly, the pie itself... is average.  The crust is thin, which I love, but it doesnt have the crispiness that normal NY style pizzas have.  We ordered the mushroom and sausage pie for $35.  The toppings were average if not subpar.  I don't think I would go back because of the line.  Again, it's good, but nothing amazing.  And that wait just makes it not worth it.",

It was cheesy and salty and the oily just melted my paper plate. Exactly how I wanted it. My most recent venture to Secret Pizza we ordered 2 whole pizzas to go. The wait was almost an hour, but when we got it that pie was gone in less then 5 minutes. It is just that much better when you have it hot and fresh.  It's cheap and it's open late.

They had all kinds of different pies by the slice and beer to go too.  Go for the white-- So delicious and yummy. Not sure I was a fan of the sausage and Ricotta but it was good enough. Add some parmesan and a light dusting of Garlic Salt/powder on your Pizza for added deliciousness.  It smelled great and we got quite the looks from people as we headed down and back to our condo (We're staying nearby at The Jockey Club) as we traipsed through 3 floors of the Cosmo with Giant NY Style pieces of pizza.

Unharmed by some celebrity chef being paid too much to make expensive food that is rarely worth the cost.   Your food is served on a cheap paper plate, your beer is served in a red plastic college party cup.

    "text": "I am in no way a pizza connoisseur.  You can probably compare my palate for pizza to pure vanilla; I'll eat any toppings, eat any style crust, order delivery or sit in a restaurant...in the end, most of it is just pizza to me.  So in my book, you've created something special when you stand out above the rest.  Now just because I'll eat anything on a pizza doesn't mean I don't have some preference.  I'm always happy with sausage and mushroom on my pie.  During my first visit my buddy and I ordered a sausage, mushroom and ricotta pizza.  This...was...divine (to quote a fellow yelper).  It is a New York styled pizza, a bit light on the sauce, thin and droopy if not folded in half, and has this magical crust that remains soft on the inside and has a bit of crunch on the outside.  Note that I said New York styled; I've never been to New York or had their pizza, so I can't say if it's real or not!  What I do know is that my taste buds screamed for more pizza after that scalding first bite (guys never learn, do they?).    On my second visit I placed two orders, a sausage, ricotta and garlic pizza; and a slice of mushroom and cheese to hold me over until our personalized pie was done.  I will say this: if you order one of the premade slices that is already sitting out, you're in for a lot more crunch than if you order a whole new fresh pie.  So bring a friend or two and go for fresh, if want that easy foldable pizza.  Another thing to note is that on my first visit, the chefs were cutting up actual sausage links for our pizza (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=ZT3AiU5KP2xY-mJsXmNZnQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQp...</a>).  Not so on the second visit  (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=NBkD80-Yb6ykjKGuQctSoA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQp...</a>).  All in all this has become my favorite pizza place in Vegas, one that I perpetually crave for (What?  Can't you go for some pizza at any given moment?)  No doubt about it, this is a repeat eat!",

However we arrived about 3:20 AM after the club and once we arrived the security guard shut the door. We asked what are the hours. His reply was \"I WAS TOLD TO SHUT THE DOOR.\" I requested to speak to someone from the restaurant so we can get the hours and He got the security supervisor. Which I did not think was necessary. He was so rude and he as well did not  give us the hours. So Finally the restaurant manager comes out and TELL us nothing... He kept saying \"we are not associated with yelp, or google\" -_- At this point I gave up. My friend & I got trespassed! Walking to my car and noticed we were followed by EIGHT SECURITY AGENTS\" Just for two girls who asked for hours of operation. We made it to the outside and I go pushed to the pole and the security supervisor puts me in handcuffs   I work in the industry and trust me there are way more serious things that these security agents could have been doing.",

You'll actually see a brightly lit hallway lined with photos as you walk towards the restaurants.

The place is small and only had a handful of bar stools, so not much room for sitting. The pizza itself is...eh...over hyped in my opinion.

I ordered the white pizza and my husband ordered pepperoni and meatball. Both were nothing short of awesome. I preferred the white, it was so simple but some of the best I've ever had.

Sure, I'm here in NYC where supposedly there's lots of good pizza, but so far, nothing comes close to what I had at the Pizzeria at The Cosmopolitan Hotel & Resort. This place is hidden in between a few other restaurants in a shopping & dining area attached to the hotel-- there are no signs, so if you can't locate it, ask around. You won't be sorry.   So what made this pizza so awesome? Well, first off, the crust was just right-- not too crunchy and not too soft... the pizza sauce was perfect and seasoned just right... and the cheese and toppings were fresh and tasty. On two different visits last week, I had a couple of difference slices-- I tried both the pepperoni and meatball. The 2nd time I had them add ricotta to my meatball slice... and all I can say is, \"Amazing!\"",

Then inside there are a couple pinball machines and a Galaga arcade game. There are no tables--only counter space--which is unique unless you want to sit down. This place has a really authentic '80s vibe to it--music and everything.  Also, if you sign a dollar bill, they put it on the wall with the others.  The main reason why it wouldn't get a full 5 stars is because it's somewhat overpriced. The 18\" pepperoni pie was $28.50. We could have added more toppings, but it would have significantly increased the price. But if you take into account that it's at least that amount for two people in Las Vegas no matter where you go, then I guess it's not too bad.   The toppings list was also quite limited, with maybe 10 options--all very common ones too.  It's not the best pepperoni pizza I've ever had--that one would be up for discussion--but it's probably top 5. If anything, the meat could have been slightly less salty and the cheese could have done better to balance the flavor out, but overall it was very satisfying.  I would go back here, but only while in Vegas. If Secret Pizza was in the real world I would have a hard time dropping $30 for a pepperoni pizza--let alone $5 per slice! But since I'm spending a lot of money on food anyway, I might as well pick this place.",

We grabbed up a pepperoni deep dish which was pretty decent, but not close to my favorite. The plus is that its nicely crispy and not doughy, lots of pepperoni  and sauce and cheese in it. Its much more filling than the thin slice so I suppose you get more bang for your buck with that.    We got a slice of white pizza as well. This is one of my favorites here and the BF liked it a lot too. Its also good with their sliced sausage on it. I think if you wan't something besides a basic pepperoni, I think this is the best one they have to offer. Slices start at $4.50 for a already made slice or you can order in a whole pizza as well (I believe the last time I ordered one it was about $20ish for a 1 topping). Of course, having it fresh made is slightly better than getting a slice that's been sitting. They serve a few beers on tap or soda, and there is a water dispenser out with water cups. Other than that, they serve nothing else - just 'za!   I think the \"secret pizza\" is not so secret, but if you aren't sure where it is, it's on the same floor as most of their restaurants. It's right next to Blue Ribbon Sushi, you'll just see a random corridor of albums and you'll see a arcade machine visible at the end. Theres some stools or standing bar. You can walk your slice out into lobby of this area as there's plenty of seating and a pool table even.   Good quick bite when here in Cosmo, a good idea to order a pizza instead of room service, not something I would venture to the strip just to get though. Still, I am a fan and manage to end up here every time I'm on the property!",

Technically, it's not labeled on the directory and there's no sign but judging by the line that stretched almost to the outside of the hallway of records, the secret cat has been let out of the secret bag. That's okay though because it's still worth visiting if you find yourself drunk, hungry, or both in the Cosmo. I'm not going to lie and tell you that the line moves fast but it crawls along just quick enough to keep you hopeful that you'll get something to eat before your morning flight takes off. The price point is in the $5-6 range per slice which seems pretty standard for pizza by the slice on the strip but I gotta be honest, this is literally the best slice of pizza I've had in recent memory! The crust is really what makes Secret pizza excel over other comparable places. Full disclosure, the slices here are slightly smaller than Pin Up Pizza or Pizza Forte at the Hard Rock but the excellent quality more than makes up for the slightly lesser value. Being a Las Vegas local, I definitely don't find myself on the strip all that often but next time I'm at the Cosmo, I'm definitely gonna to get me a slice at Secret Pizza!",

I was leaving marquee nightclub inside the cosmopolitan when a Host told me about this place because I told him I was craving something to eat and I need something greasy to cure my hangover for the next morning. He told me to find the secret pizza place and I thought he was joking at first but little did I know there's definitely was one and it was amazing some of the best pizza I've had in Las Vegas.",

Customer service sucks pizza was blaaahhhh!! an to top it off the seating is very limited. Just because it's on TV doesn't make it great!!  Nothing special or mind blowing about the joint. Who cares if it's hidden and a secret!! Keep it that way it's not worth the trouble to find!!! You want fresh and awesome pizza with great service head to Project Pie inside the MGM!!!",

Worth the wait! The pizza was so damn tasty and light, I got the supreme. Usually dairy and I aren't friends but this didn't cause any problems. The crust was the perfect texture and it wasn't drowned in cheese and grease. People kept asking where we got the pizza and while I didn't wanna share my secret the telltale line gave it away :) it's the perfect late night snack and I wanted to ppl to like me so I pointed them in the right direction and said 'you're welcome'. Definitely gonna go back.",

The layout of the place is pretty small and more than likely you'll end up eating outside at the pool table. While waiting in line you can see the have some cool decor and nice music. Customer service is alright nothing too spectacular at the same time they aren't douches at all.  The wait isn't too bad too, the line moves generally fast. Pick a pizza, choose any extra toppings, pay, receive pizza.  Overall not too bad, I usually come here after a concert.",

So my husband orders for me and ask to get a SLICE of the white pizza and they said they are all out. So he orders a whole white pizza instead for my friends and I (40 minute wait btw). Next my 2 friends order and ask for a slice of white pizza. BAMM, THEY GET THEIR ORDER?! So I go to front and ask for a refund because they basically lied to my husband about NOT HAVING WHITE PIZZA! The worker claims that when I ordered and asked for white pizza, it was not ready yet and they just came out when my friends order after. BUT, my husband said their was a slice right in front of him when he did ask (btw, he didn't know what it was at the time). WOWWWWW. They straight up lied! SO i ask for a refund, cancel my order of the whole pizza and ask for the white pizza slice that is sitting right in front of me. The worker calls for a manager, and the manager is more than happy to get my refund. But because my husband DID NOT ASK FOR A RECEIPT, he has to manually print out the last transactions and manually look for my card. THIS MANAGER LITERALLY PRINTS OUT A LONG LIST OF TRANSACTION FROM LAST 30 DAYS or something!? He is going one by one.... OBVIOUSLY he is trying to buy time... after 5 mins of useless looking... I ask my friend (the one that order right after me) for her receipt and give it to the manager. He's like OMMMG THANK YOU!! THIS WILL HELP! (in my head, i'm like you just need to look for the last 4 digits of my card, BUT WHATEVER). He then tells me that he will refund my money and give me the slice of white pizza for FREE.  After long waited frustration, I take a bit of this \"OMG SO GOOD?!\" white pizza, and was disappointed. THE HYPE WAS TOO REAL. I'm sorry that pizza was not that great. ..but maybe because of the the dilemma.  Was going to give it no stars for the BS they put me through and lying... but 1 star for manager who came through with my refund and free pizza.  Maybe I'll come back and try it again...when it's not too hectic.",

My friend and I ate the green pepper one and it was good. Loved the thin crust style. We were full so I took the other slice and gave it to my brother.  A few things I didn't like.....there are no signs of what pizza is what. Basically, you just point and guess. It was a tad pricey as it was $15 for our 3 slices. Last, the pizza was a bit greasy.  I would still come back though! Good quick bite if you need something to hold down the liquor.",

My friend kept pointing out these pizzas on our first night there so a quick Yelp search the next day brought us to Secret Pizza. I had a slice of their white pizza (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=dDuqmvJHjJe-T5PLelhLjQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQp...</a>) and wow it was cheese-tacular. The ricotta and mozzarella were nice and melted on a nice crisp crust. Fold it up and enjoy! Best $5 I spent that day.   I guess Secret Pizza isn't really a secret anymore but that's to be expected since it's a Vegas bargain to get really good NY slices at low prices. Service can be slow but the wait is worth it.",

Only knock I have is that I have to get something like a Bud Light to drink with my pizza. Wish they had maybe one good local craft beer on draught, then it would be 5 stars.  Atmosphere, although small, is quite cool. I sat at an Arcade game and had my pizza and beer.

There's no sign, thus the secret ;)  You walk down the small corridor and you'll find the pizza along with some pinball and old arcade machines. There's not much seating in the place, so you'll usually find a handful of people chowing down on pizza in the lounge area in front of STK.  Honestly, the pizza is OK. But as a disclaimer, I may have become more of a gourmet pizza snob over the years not having lived in places like Chicago or NY where they have more of those classic pizza joints.   Love the crust though, nice and chewy. Their toppings are also limited to more classics. A bit pricey for a slice, but hey, it's Vegas. We'll usually end up ordering a pie with a pitcher of soda for about $35.",

I've had this place bookmarked for years & finally had the chance to try it as we're staying at the same hotel of its location.  * Verdict: If I could remember, LOL! It was good, but way overpriced for a slice! Gotta pay by the slice.  $5.00 for cheese pizza $5.50 for 1 topping pizza  For 5 slices, I don't know how we ended up paying for 2 slices of cheese pizza because we got 2 pepperonis, 2 pepperoni & mushrooms, & 1 cheese garlic ricotta slice.

Cause mine just did!    I usually pay a visit in the middle of the night (usually after Marquee Night Club) to sober up a bit before making my way back home.  Line is usually long after 1:30AM, and you will usually spot it with people piling along a corridor with others walking out with 1 slice, 2 slice, or even a whole pizza box full of the gooey goodness.    You can't just order any toppings on one slice, it's whatever they have already made, however if you choose to order a whole pizza, you may very well choose any topping to your desire!  They usually have their most popular ones like the white pizza or the sausage and peppers and they always have pepperoni, cheese, or sausage or a meat lovers available.  If you don't see what you want or crave, you can also kindly ask what else they have, because sometimes theres others ones on the bottom that they don't put out until they have sold out of the ones already on display.   There's no sign outside of the pizza place, simply make your way to the third floor, look for the tube elevator and a corridor with lots of record labels and you are in the right area.  Or you can also use your nose to smell your way to the destination. haha.",

Secret Pizza is located on the 3rd level of Cosmopolitan and it's not hard to find since there always seems to be a line of people in a small hallway.  Honestly, I don't even know what slices I've tried but I've enjoyed them all.  I have yet to try their popular White Pizza, but they're all really good.  1 huge slice will cost you about $5-$6. Not too bad considering it is Vegas... and the pizza is actually good! Its always served piping hot and I love how the cheese is all melted and stringy with each bite.  Yum.  No complaints here!  I would say definitely hit this spot up if you're staying at the Cosmo of if you're leaving Marquee !",

As far as the pizza, itself, it's very good; but not the best I've had. I probably wouldn't go back. Finding it was half the fun here.  One word of caution: If you're from the Northeast or Chicago, you will probably say \"this pizza is just average, why is everyone so excited about it?\" And it's not cheap either. It's cheap compared to other Vegas eating choices, but $33 for a whole plain pie is about double what you pay back home.",

Counter style ordering; very few seats inside, several pies to choose from (either full pie or slice).  Even PBR on draft!  Once you pick your flavor, the slice gets sent back in the oven for a few minutes... comes to you warm, crunchy and just delicious!  Pay the man and then either find a seat inside (unlikely) or take your slice outside into the main hotel area.   Along the back wall you can find hot pepper flakes and Parmesan to top your slice off - yum!  The pizza was thin crunchy crust just how I like it and had good flavor!

The white pizza was good too, a bit like amazing thin garlic toast, but I prefered my choice.  The \"secret\" location isn't too complicated; go to the third floor and look for a dark hallway that's not labeled.  It's close to the other 3rd floor restaurants.  There's little seating, we stood at a bar height counter.

    "text": "Underground pizza with underground prices at one of the swankiest joints in Vegas.  It was Monday morning at 11:00AM and the girls wanted to grab some slices before heading home.  Wandering around the hotel, I asked one of the nice Cosmo' staff where the pizza joint is.  Staff: \"Hmmm.. I don't know if I can trust you. This is some top secret pizza.\" Me: \"Really? Because it got a gang of reviews on Yelp. How top secret can it be?\" Staff: \"Hmm good point. You're standing right in front of it.\"  So the pizza place opens at 11:30 and there was a wooden door/wall in between 2 restaurants, so we waited. 11:25 came and there were already people lining up.   Once the place opened the wooden wall was flipped and we walked down the long corridor and finally saw the pinball machine people were talking about.  We were greeted by some young cheery staff members. They had 4 pies ready which included: white, meat with mushrooms, plain cheese and a pepperoni.  As we placed our order, the pizza maker told us it'd be cheaper for us to get a pie.  We decided to do a half white and half sausage/pepperoni/mushroom. It came out to about $24 for a pie.  White pizza. Good if you like ricotta cheese. Very soft texture but very flavorful. The meat/mushroom pizza was just okay to make. The dough was nice and soft with crisp golden edges but the ingredients lacked the umph.  It could be in the marinara sauce. Who knows.  Overall a good pizza for something on the Vegas strip at a swanky place like the Cosmo. I wouldn't say it's to die for (unless you're broke and needing to save all the $ you can for gas so you can make it back to LA). LOL.   There were about 5 stools available so I suggest standing while eating. Staff was incredible - 5 star service!",

If you want great pizza, call the Treasure Island front desk and have them route you to their pizza place - it delivers to any hotel and it is TO DIE FOR.",

The counter lady seemed totally pissed off and pretty much ignored us when we asked about our pizza. It was only 8:30, no drunkies to ruin her night yet. :x   Pizza was just ok to me.

They have good prices for what they serve (got 2 slices of pizza and bottled water for $15). If you're staying in Vegas, you know that's a pretty good deal. They have parm and chili pepper shakers and a garlic shaker if you're that kind of person!",

It's the place to go to after the clubs considering that it's in a secret, hidden opening right across from Marquee on the third level of the Cosmopolitan.  It's a very small alley way leading into a very small shop and there's always a line here.  It's a very simple menu, there isn't much of a variety, maybe four types of pizzas that go in rotation (cheese, mushroom, white, sicilian).  You can order by the slice here or order a whole pizza.  I think you get more options for toppings if you order a whole pizza.  The pizza here is a little on the pricier side at around $5 a slice.  They serve New York style pizza here, very thin, super airy, crispy crust, with just the perfect amount of sauce, cheese, and toppings.  It's a very good and solid pizza, some of the best NY style I've had on the west coast.  It's not heavy and hearty if that's what you're looking for.  I definitely recommend the white pizza. It's like an alfredo sauce with ricotta. It looks very plain and simple but it's delicious.  It's great pizza, I only wished there were more options and toppings. But that's the beauty of this place, good wholesome simplicity.",

    "text": "I've been to this place a few times now and always enjoyed it.  For me, it is the best place to go grab a quick snack at the Cosmo.  Yes, it is $5 a slice.  Yes, it is \"just\" above average pizza (it's Vegas!).  Yes, it is not a secret anymore and there are often lines, and yes, it still is hard to find even after coming here several times (maybe it's just me).    With all that said, I keep coming back and there is something to be said for that.  What? I don't know.  I kind of expect to pay higher than average when in Vegas so I'm ok with it.  I also kind of expect to wait in line from time to time.  Maybe my coping skills are better than some other reviewers.  But, back to the food.  It's just above or slightly above average pizza.  But after a few drinks or a big win at the tables, and it is a slice from the gods.  After a loss at the tables, its the only thing to eat because there isn't much around cheaper or more convenient.  I would say they have a great business model!  Pros: convenient (if you are in Cosmo), relatively inexpensive, not bad quality, can feed you on your last $5 after taking a beating at the tables.   Cons: kind of overpriced for what it is. I hate trying to find this place.   Overall.  It doesn't matter what I say, or whether I like it or not.  If I'm staying at the Cosmo again, I'll be back.  If not, maybe not.  Love their concept though, and the guys working there have always been cool as heck.",

About half a second later, the wonderful smell of fresh pizza hit my nose and, like a beacon, drew me in.  Compared to the other places on the strip, this place is a dive. It's about as simple as you can get; pizza by the slice or pie, limited drinks (some beer) and red solo cups next to a water cooler. That's about it folks. The prices, though, aren't typical Vegas and certainly about the cheapest you'll find on the strip. I think I paid $6 for a \"slice\" of pizza. I say \"slice\" because this could easily have fed two of us (but it didn't, and I ate the entire thing!)  I'll definitely be coming back to this place the next time I'm in Vegas. Just keep it quiet.. there's just standing room only at the counter to eat, and I don't want to have to wait for a spot! :)  Enjoy!",

You'll know you're going down the right hallway when you see a pinball machine at the end.   Honestly, this is the closest to NYC style that I've had since grabbing a slice before jumping through the turnstiles to catch the Lexington express down to 42nd St in high school. The thin crust, just greasy enough cheese, and sauce with faint chunks of tomato skin were all on point, fugetdaboutit. If you love you some NYC style, do yourself a favor and seek this joint out.",

The line was humongous and I could have taken a taxi to and back from spring mt road during that wait, but let me tell you it was definitely worth it. The pizza here is the real deal new york style, the way I like it. The set-up is also classic corner pizzeria, none of that vegas glitz and bling. Nothing else to add, other than the wait sucks and it's like 5 bucks a slice, hence the 4 stars.",

The ladies asked someone at the Concierge's desk, and then we were directed to what looked like a restroom hallway.  lol  When we got to the end, it was (from what i've been told) a typical NY style joint in that the pizza place didn't really focus too much on having much available seating.    We weren't sure how to order at first since they were cooking a bunch of what appeared to be simple pizzas.  I don't recall seeing any kind of signs or food descriptions, or prices for that matter.  We witnessed someone customizing their pizza and decided to do the same.  We started with a naked veggie pizza, and then added on to it.  My wife added tomato slices and meatball slices.  I did the same, but also added some green peppers.  They added the items and threw the pizzas back into the oven to heat/cook the newly added ingredients.    Pricing was okay.  I probably would have enjoyed it more though had the price been $4 instead of $4.75 per slice.  Or I guess a bigger slice would have also made the $4.75 price feel better.  But hey, it was a nice snack to hold us over.  ;)",

A bit pricy for a slice of anything more than cheese but as a visitor in town a couple extra bucks doesn't break me! Head down to the Cosmopolitan for a pizza scavenger hunt! Only downside is parking. One hour free, paid past that, and people who always back up the two exit lanes that make it a press to get out on time if you drive in.",

The entrance, a long unmarked hallway decorated with records, is next to the glass elevator. The restaurant is very small. There are not a whole lot of seats. The decor is a throwback to the 1980s and 90s. Including the music, an arcade video game machine, and two pinball machines. It was not busy when we went, around 2 PM on a weekday. You can order pizza by the slice, which costs around 5 to 6 dollars, or a whole pie. The friendly workers will pop your slice of pizza in the oven to crisp it up. This is a very nice touch. The pizza is New York style, with a super thin crust, and high-quality toppings. The sauce was flavorful, the cheese was delicious, and the toppings extremely tasty. The crust was chewy, but super crisp on the bottom. It really hit the spot! Tastes exactly what NY pizza should taste like, in my mind. We tried three flavors: the combination pizza, the sliced meat ball and ricotta cheese, and pepperoni and mushroom. The combo pizza had the most flavor, but the other two were also outstanding. They also have a vegetarian combo pizza and cheese pizza for vegetarians out there. Drinks are kind of expensive at four dollars for a soda. But hey, this Vegas. Definitely recommend this place if you are a fan of New York style pizza and want a quick and relatively inexpensive bite to eat.",

Take the escalator up to the third floor of the Cosmopolitan and look for the hallway with the record albums and the large wooden door. Down the hallway is magic. As you're walking down the hallway you can smell the pizza's cooking in the oven and given that this place isn't on any map it's fun to be in on a not-so-secret pizza joint. This walk-up restaurant is super small and probably has counter space for 6 people to eat there but when we went we were lucky enough to get a spot. The pizza is quite simply freaking delicious. The crust is nice and crispy, the cheese is savory and it would make the perfect late night snack or meal. I tried both the sausage and white pizza. The white pizza has a fantastic garlic taste and fresh ricotta on top. The sausage pizza was also good with thin slices of aromatic sausage. My boyfriend tried the pepperoni and asked them to put jalapenos on top and said it was also very good. The price is also great for the place. We paid $15 for 3 slices. I will definitely be back for this yummy yummy pizza!",

Upon arriving you automatically realize that your in for a treat with the quaint shop and wonderful aromas. We ordered four slices, my wife had two pepperoni and I had a slice of their White with ricotta and a slice of sausage with ricotta. I happily paid the $5 a slice because I knew that we were in for a treat. I was correct, every bite from tip to the crust was amazing. Since it's precooked then heated up when ordered the bottom has a perfect little crunch. Sauce was light and not overwhelming and added a delicate taste that complimented the cheese and toppings for both of our slices. I was more impressed with their white pizza, I'm used to a blended oil with a quick dusting of garlic powder. Not Secret Pizza! You can taste the fresh garlic which goes so well with the cheese and little dollops of ricotta. Simplicity is perfection when it comes to pizza and Secret Pizza has definitely perfected their slice. My wife and I ate a lot of pizza this trip to Vegas and hands down Secret is the best.",

The slices are big and heavy that after eating two slices I end up not feeling so good but I always end up eating more than I should because it's so delicious. I always get the white slice and a side of pepperoncinis. They also serve pitchers of beer!",

Luckily someone over heard me talking about it and he pointed to where we needed to go. I knew to look for a narrow hallway with records on the wall so once I saw it I knew we had found it. We got there a little before 12 so it was pretty early and the line was short. The place is pretty small so there is not a lot of seating inside but there are chairs and tables outside. The guy who took our order is hilarious and he made our first time experience even better. They do not have bacon or pineapple for toppings so Hawaiian pizza lovers you will be disappointed. They do offer refills on their fountain drinks so that is nice. The cashier guy was super friendly. The pizza was to die for and I hate myself for not buying a whole pizza! The crust is thin and crunchy. The sauce is bomb and the toppings are fresh. They have Parmesan cheese, chili flakes, oregano, and garlic powder or salt for you to put on your pizza. I definitely want to try the white sauce when I come back. I will never enjoy eating pizza again unless it's from here because I've had the best pizza now. I have cravings for this pizza and nothing compares to it. They need to franchise this place and open them up everywhere. It's a shame it's a secret when it's so good. I want to tell the world about this place. I can't wait to go back to Vegas so I can get more of this piece of heaven!",

I have friends that come in from New York City and tell me that this pizza is just as good if not better than New York pizza. I definitely recommend just getting the plain cheese just so you can really taste the True meaning of the pizza. Then I also recommend getting the mushrooms or whatever topping that you normally get. But you have to try the Sicilian  because I just think that it's a disgrace if you don't. Also the coolest part about this place is that they have cool pinball machines here and there and it's always open after the club and much much better than room service.",

It's a long hallway located right next to Blue Ribbon. To be honest I've been here like 5 times and still miss it sometimes haha.  Really great New York style pizza for Las Vegas strip prices, so don't be surprised at the cost of each slice! The slices start at $5 for a plain pizza and go up from there. You get a fairly decent sized slice, though usually 2 does the job for me.  This place is the best to quickly grab a bite before a concert/show or maybe if you want to just fill your stomach up before/after a wild night of drinking. Just expect quick, efficient, and friendly service! If you need to be in and out, Secret Pizza is the place. The pizzas are all really fresh and they have a variety - some with veggies, some with pineapple and ham, some with nothing but cheese.  Definitely on the pricey side but not sure what else anyone would expect when you're on the strip. Love the quickness of it when I am too hungry or too cheap for a sit down restaurant at the Cosmo!",

I hate when thin crusts are too thin and I easily get tired of the doughy pizza that is most places.    The sauce is excellent--that's what makes/breaks most pizza IMO. Cheaper pizzas are either too sweet and bland or have this odd metallic taste.  I also loved that the parmesan was very salty (as it should be) but the pizza itself wasn't. That's also an indicator of bad pizza--cheese that's way too salty like American Cheese.   Just make sure you don't get one that looks like it's been sitting out all day. It'll be dry. It'll still taste good but just dry.  There are only two negatives though--you have to make your way through a bunch of drunk hoes and douchebags to get to the counter. Their inane conversations made me want to put a grenade in my mouth. The other negative is the exorbitant price.",

Then again, its the only spot in this part of the Cosmo  to grab a solid bite without sitting down so I guess you gotta pay to play.  Pepperoni was good, but the highlights were the white pizza and pepperoni/sausage/meatball combo. I will be back for a slice of those next time I return!",

My guess since this would be a convenient place to hit up after a night of partying at the Cosmo, its rating is inflated by a bunch of people who were drunk and hungry after dancing through the night.  (what pizza doesnt taste bomb when you are drunk and starving?)",

By how much he was talking about it, I was getting pretty excited to go try it out. I waited til' our last day in Vegas as a sort of farewell meal. Well, as soon as that pizza touched my tongue, I was absolutely disappointed. The pepperoni was extremely salty and the pizza itself had a literal puddle of grease... No part of being in that little back room shack was enjoyable. Honestly would've rather had a Little Cesar's pizza.",

Pretty damn secret because you can literally walk past and not even notice that they're cooking some bomb pizza here.  Yep, one of those hidden gems.  What's great about this place is you can get a large inexpensive slice of pizza in before or after clubbing right in a central location.  What's not great about this place is that it can get packed during late hours when EVERYBODY piles in line to get drunchies.  Minus one for that, but other than wait time, quality pizza right hurr.  Be aware of bitches who cut in line--Sure, we may have alcohol in our systems and are hungry as hell, I'm still sober enough to follow the line, so get your ass to the back of the line.  It can take a while when it's packed, but chill in line with friends and a beer and you're good to go.",

It is located on the 3rd floor in the Cosmopolitan, right next to Blue Ribbon Sushi. If you walk down the hallway with all of the albums you will run right into it. No signage, no advertising, nothing. But when you find it you will love it!  We ordered the cheese and pepperoni slices and it tasted amazing. The crust was thin, had just the right amount of grease, and tasted just like NY style pizza. They even serve the soda in a red solo cup. I would have loved to try the white pizza, but they didn't have any made at the time. But I will go back every single time I am in Vegas.",

The waft of crusty bread and pizza sauces permeates the halls and the lobby, marketing it's own original advertisement!  It's your typical Pizza Joint, Pies laid out in front with giant stacked ovens in the back; lines of people ordering and paying at the register.  The interior is remarkably chic; Carrera marble counter tops and other beautiful finishes make this the best dive to grab a cheap eat!  I was unfortunately, unable to help myself; a slice of Cheese and Pepperoni + Sausage somehow got onto my plate.  The Pizzas were just right; perfect crust-almost buttery it had both the texture and flavor that makes it an undeniably New York Pizza.  The Pepperoni Sausage was super yummy, and I can just imagine this would be the perfect place for after hours dining.  I had to take a pic of my favorite Pizza condiments: Parmesan, Chili Flakes and Oregano,  missing is Garlic, my frenemy (love the taste, hate the after effects of lingering garlic in my mouth and breath)",

It was good pizza, but I don't think it's anything spectacular. It's thin crusted and a large slice... I had to fold it in half to eat it!  The only downfall is that there really isn't a place to sit and I ate my pizza standing next to a counter...

It's literally down the hallway in between 2 restaurants and it was a lot smaller than I expected. Luckily, there was no wait when we got there and was able order right away.  My friend and I ended up getting a slice of their White, Margherita, and a Sausage w/ ricotta cheese. My personal favorite was the white pizza, but the sausage one definitely had more flavor to it. They fire it up in the oven for a minute or two so it comes out nice and crispy which is pretty awesome. When I asked for some banana peppers, they guy said they didn't carry that and ended up giving me some peperoncino instead (similar, but a little sweeter imo).  Each slice is $5.50 and with a drink our total came out to a little over $20. The slices are a pretty decent size - although they're more on the thinner side. Honestly, the price is pretty steep for a slice but if you're in Vegas...it's sort of a given. Might be back for more, but not if it's out of the way or if the line's crazy long.",

While my friends knew it existed and they've had it, we decided to brave the long line and grab a few slices.  It was past midnight on a Saturday night and the line wasn't getting shorter as we stood in it. People were passing by us with either slices of pizza or a full on box with a whole pie in it.   When you get to the front of the line, you kinda ignore the menu that they have and just point out the ones that you like. Come to think of it, I think their menu just states the prices and some options but that's all I could remember. In any case, you choose from a handful of choices then they heat it up for you. Each slice is about $5-$6. A little steep for a New York slice but I get it since there was an ample amount of toppings on it. I opted for the pepperoni & sausage and a slice of just sausage. I had the sausage that night and it was goooood. They have red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese if you choose to top your slice with it. Without it was still pretty delicious. The boyfriend had his the next day.  We heated it up and it was still pretty good. But it's definitely better if it was eaten the same day it was ordered.   In any case, I would brave the line again and order their other options. It's a pretty good slice of pizza.",

The sauce had a garlicky yet light flavor and the clumps of cheese was spread throughout the slice so evenly. I appreciate the fact that every pizza is so fresh but they also run out so quick that they have to keep making them. The line was ridiculously long around 3am on a Friday, so expect your wait time to be close to an hour. The white slice was amazing and really hit the spot on a late Friday night.",

There line is usually long so it ensures that you are getting a relatively fresh slice and not old pizza that's been sitting out all day.  The sausage pizza was tasty with sausage, onion, peppers and olives. The best was probably the mushroom which had a nice delicate fresh mushroom taste over a plain slice. Slices are pretty big, but you are also paying 4.5-7 a slice.",

And plenty of other reviews here tell you where to look, so I won't rehash that. What you want to know is whether this is a good place to go for a late night snack in Las Vegas. The answer is most definitely yes. It's located in Las Vegas, so it's not cheap. But this is a great place to get a greasy slice of New York style pizza. In spite of its secret location, lines are often long. But Secret Pizza remains a Vegas favorite.",

I will be revealing the exact location in the next sentence. It's on the 3rd floor in between Blue Ribbon and like this round, clear elevator. My bf and I got there right when it opened so the crowd wasn't bad. We asked the guy behind the counter what he would recommend.  We ended up ordering 3 slices; they were $6 each. Think one was the meat lover, one had sausage & ricotta and the other was sausage & pepperoncini. They all tasted okay; expected more since there's a lot of hype about this place. Nothing special about the crust, toppings or flavor. The meat lover was actually a bit salty to me. Small place, a few stools inside and some old school gaming machines like pinball. Overall, it was just average greasy pizza.",

They run efficiently and take your order fast but expect a short line and wait as they reheat your pizza in the oven as it has gotten cold sitting out in display.  They have about 4 kinds of pizza, all NY style so very thin crust and slice but very delicious.  A little high price for pizza in general, but practically free by Vegas restaurant means.

You can tell a lot about a place when they can make an amazing pie without any toppings.  Growing up in NJ, I was spoiled with all the great pizza joints in NJ and NY. It's been tough finding a great pizza place on the west coast.  This one tops my list so far.",

Tiny little place with literally no seating, some old beat up arcade games, we got some pizza in our attempts to sober.   The combo pizza was pretty awesome. Don't know why it taste so good. Could be the crust, the hot mess on top, or the fact that I was blasted.  The cheese pizza was okay. The chunks of melted cheeze/garlic/whatever sauce was interesting...  Definitely worth a check out.",

When you see \"Zuma\" (not built yet as of 12/2016), look directly across and you'll see a long hallway with photos hanging on either side.  You may even see a guy who looks like a bouncer with a blue suit on.  Go down the hallway and you are there!  COST: $5.00/slice for cheese and $5.50/slice for those with toppings.  I highly recommend getting the white pizza if you like garlic.  They serve NY style (thin) pizza so if you're into the regular or Chicago style pizza, this is not the place for you.  I thought the pizza here was REALLY good but I wish the prices were cheaper.  Regardless, definitely worth the visit if you're craving pizza.  As a side note, I'm not sure if \"Secret Pizza\" is really their True name as they bill credit cards under the name \"Cosmo Pizzeria.\"",

The white pizza is absolutely divine here. It quickly runs out and you usually have to wait a few minutes before the next one comes out. The wait is worth it!   I have also had the pepperoni pizza (which was okay) and the meatball pizza (which was amazingly flavorful)! I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves, or even mildly like, pizza! Just go to the top floor of the Cosmo, venture down a hallway of art on the wall and once you start to see a line in front of you, you are pretty much there!   I have to be honest--one of the reasons that I really like going to Marquee is knowing that I am going to Secret Pizza afterward. I have seriously stood in line at 4am, exhausted, heels in hand, pining over how good the white pizza will be once I get it in 30 minutes or so. After getting the pizza, seating is aplenty outside Secret Pizza and throughout the Cosmo!",

Sometimes the crust was thicker on the edge and moist, other slices not so much. I liked it better fresh, late at night.   Even though I find the pizza tasty, it certainly is not the best pizza I've ever had. I also despised waiting in a long, sketchy line without a sign, but, hey, what can you do when you drive all the way from Henderson to grab some slices.  Prices are also on the high end.",

BOOM :-D   It's a little hard to find during the day since it's a small hallway on the Ballroom floor next to the tube elevator and pool table. But it's a whole lot easier later in the night since EVERYONE even remotely around the hallway is eating pizza. Just ask them where it's at :-) Night time wait is around 20 min but you can get in pretty quick during the day.  The pizza itself is really good.

Although the place is not much of a secret anymore since everyone and their mamas could be found standing in the hour + line at 2am after clubbing at Marquee. It seems like the typical thing to do now if you ever find yourself during that time at the Cosmo.   I had the pleasure of staying at the Cosmo for two nights and during the first night I came with my bf at 10pm with no lines and we only waited for about 15 minutes for our customized white pizzas that came fresh from the oven. But during the second night I came with Sidney T. after clubbing and the line was ridiculous! It stretched out into the lobby area! Also, since it took us an hour to even get to the front, we just opted for the pre-made pizza that's been sitting out and I have to say it was just not the same as ordering it and eating it fresh from the oven. I'd definitely recommend ordering it fresh and don't forget to add the oregano and chili flakes from the condiment counter for extra yumminess!",

There's not too much eating space inside -- a couple counters and a pinball machine.  Avoid the rush of the drunk, 2am crowd and I am sure the pizza will be worth your adventure.  What's so good about their pepperoni pizza?  It tastes like a REALLY good microwave pizza -- and I mean that in a good way.  It's greasy, crispy, salty, and hot -- so wrong, yet so right.  It's comfort food. And, you can add toppings of your choice (for some extra $).  They have the basics premade -- cheese, pepperoni, white pizza, and some other choice pie of the day.  When you get your slice, they'll heat it up for you, so that it's hot hot hot.  Pizza is sold by the slice or the entire pie.  It's not cheap pizza -- but think of it this way: In Vegas, the house always wins -- might as well get some pizza out of the transaction.",

I ate here while I was attending a conference and got the late night munchies.  Like others have posted, it's not the easiest place to find, but the instructions posted on how to find it worked for me.    It's a tad pricey, but that's to be expected considering you are in a nice hotel on the strip.",

Needless to say, it tasted like a day old pizza reheated in the microwave, who knows when it was cooked.... Compared to a Lombardi's white pizza, well there is no comparison.  The Secret Pizza was luke warm (that reheating thing does not work for me), the cheese was really chewy (baked hours ago), and the crust was not really that thin like a True NY pizza.  Overall, this place is way overrated and overpriced.  $6 for a slice of pizza is no deal......  This place should stay \"secret,\" BTW, unlike many of the other reviews, I was sober when I ate the pizza....",

    "text": "We Found Sbarro's Cool Cousin at the Cosmopolitan!  For us, it was part of our Las Vegas bucket list. So this place is not so secret, it's a matter of fact pretty easy to find, tucked away in a corner, third floor at the Cosmopolitan. Both my husband and I ordered the pepperoni pizza. The pizza was just ok and that's not saying much since we were sort of hungry. After leaving there we went to In and Out to complete our late night dining experience.  Best way to describe the pizza, just think Sbarro's when you were 13 years old and your mom dropped you off at the mall. You and your friends having a Sbarro's pepperoni pizza was a fun experience and tasted pretty good. However, here are some differences, Secret Pizza is a bit more greasy, more expensive, your old friends aren't there, and less sitting space than at the mall.  They really do try their best to offer the \"cool\" factor, and what could be cooler than a pinball machine and old record covers on the wall as you walk in. For this place, once you have done it, the odds are you won't be back. But a fun thing to do anyhow if you happen to be at the Cosmopolitan. It will set you back about $10.00 for two slices of pepperoni pizza, and they have a water cooler, so no need to buy a soda. Also it is an interesting place to people watch. Both the clientele and staff offer free entertainment. Enjoy!",

Foldable, glorious, NY style pizza. If you handed me a slice on the street I would think it was straight from the big apple. Disclaimer: I'm from NY. The offerings are straightforward; pizza with assorted run of the mill toppings, soda, beer. The beer is even served in red plastic cups, which is awesome when you're nearby but might garner some dirty looks when you're walking around the ground floor.   TV's are around if you can take your eyeballs off of your slice. I couldn't. There's also some pool tables and couches just outside their door which is convenient if your hooves are hurting.   I thought about this pizza 2 days straight after eating it. Definitely swing through for a before or after drinking delight!",

We got two (very large) slices--cheese and the big mamma upside down slice. They were both delicious!! This was the best pizza we had in Vegas.  For under 20.00 we were stuffed.  The employees were super nice, chatted with us and suggested some new places to try while we were visiting.  The service was super fast, but keep in mind they only had two people working and it's a small place.  Also it's cafe style, you walk up to order and grab your food. There is seating along the wall, so not much for a large group.  Some definite bonuses.. They offer Pbr AND free water!",

Friendly folks behind the counter, too. Very few seats- take-out is a good idea- but if you do find a stool or counter space to stand, the dive-y atmosphere is great: a vintage Galaga machine, a couple of pinball machines, and, as pretty much everyone knows by now, no sign, no mention on the casino directory or website... Hence, \"Secret.\"  Just look for the unmarked corridor with the LP covers in the wall.  But you knew that.",

Open almost 24/7, late night grubbers should trek up on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel to find this gem. A dark hallway of record covers adorning the walls can be found near the pool table that will lead you to this tiny and very casual joint.   Serving NY-style pizza, the crust is crisp-thin (eaten folded) and is piping hot from the oven with a good sizzle from the cheese. A slice will cost you about $5 and some change. I say it's a bit steep but for each bite I took, nostalgia overtook me only proving that these were the closest I've had (from the west side) to eating a good ol' NYC pizza. I got their PEPPERONI, a classic that I couldn't resist, and WHITE PIZZA which I think was mighty fantastic. If you only have room for one, I highly recommend the latter. Trust.  I hear ordering a whole pizza can make you skip the line but lucky for us, there wasn't a crowd that one weekday afternoon we went.   P.S. Secret Pizza, please refill your table napkin containers. All were empty when we went.",

We finally found the place when we saw a long line of people waiting in an unmarked hallway. The restaurant is pretty small and crowded so I suggest taking your pizza to-go and eating in your hotel room because there are barely any seating areas.   We ordered a box of pepperoni and sausage as well as the white pizza because this group in front of us was telling us how delicious it was. Tbh, it tasted like any other pizza to me. Pretty overhyped. It was also annoying to eat because the cheese and toppings would slide off my pizza and I had to pick it all up and put it back on my pizza only to have it fall off again. I ended up eating it with a fork.   I must also mention that a handful of my group had stomach problems afterwards but I felt fine.",

It's hard to get good thin NY style thin crust like that in California so I may be biased. But the price is steep! You're better off ordering a whole pizza if you want more than a couple slices.  I like the old school aesthetic with the pinball machine and arcade games and the staff is extremely friendly. Pizza is handmade and they reheat it in their furnace when you order. You can request your pizza to be extra crispy too. What I found disappointing was that none of the napkin holders on any of the counters were refilled; I had to go to the cashier to request some more. And the counters were really dirty too. Maybe that too is part of the aesthetic?  Anyway, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but if you're in the area and craving some pie this isn't a bad option for a splurge, especially if it's late night (they're open until 4AM).",

I hope they don't get too popular.............",

My dad had gotten a slice before our dinner and we knew that we would be in for more. After walking down a hall of records, I came across a white tiled pizza shop with no name.... yes, no name. After walking up to the counter I read the small menu on the wall, and all of a sudden, a worker with a heavy brooklyn accent asked what i wanted. I ordered a slice of sausage pizza, by looking at it i knew it would be good. I was rung up for a total of 5 dollars for a nice sized slice, after we just spent 225 for 4 at jaleo. This pizza was so simple but so tasty. Crispy thin foldable crust, hearty sauce, and authentic sausage. This is one of those stupid pizzas that everyone tells you about that taste so simple but so good. All together this place was great. After  i wolfed down the slice, i asked the lady at the register what the name is. She replied, \" we don't have one, on yelp we're known as secret pizza\". This made it that much better. Everytime im in vegas, i'll know to go here when i don't feel like burning money and i want a great pizza.",

Two things I know about this place is its a pain in the but to find and the pizza is spot on! The title Secret Pizza is definitely True. We had to ask two people where this place was located because there is no sign and no big window. It literally looks like a janitor hallway with a PAC MAN machine at the end. Once you walk to the end of the hallway it opens up into what seems like the smallest pizza kitchen ever. But what this place lacks in size it sure makes up for in pizza and the size of the slices. It seems you may need to custom order your pizza if you don't want pepperoni or just cheese. But I assure you it'll be worth it. I got two slices of pizza and although I was satisfied I probably could have crushed another one in no time. A bonus that I found is that they serve beer and have oregano and Parmesan shakers all around. So not only did I powder my pizza but I got two brews to go. At 9am. Don't judge. It's Vegas.",

Not knowing where to get one at almost 3am, she said to follow her, after going up a couple of escalators and down a narrow hallway the smell of pizza hit me in the face. OMG there is a hidden pizzeria in the hotel!!  Not only does this place have no name, you'll find no signage, and no menu. It's a very no nonsense New York-style pizza counter. To find it, look for the hallway wrapped in vintage records.There was a small line that was forming when we walked up. This place is super small and had limited seats (bar stools and a long counter). You can order a whole pie of just a couple of slices. Minh D decided to indulge in his pizza craving and get a slice which he ended up sharing with me. All i can say is wow this pizza tasted wonderful and full of cheesy goodness!! Ashley ordered a rootbeer (which has unlimited refilled as long as you are eating there). That rootbeer was the best i have had in a long time. Make sure you save your change because they have a classic pinball machine there too!!",

I'd be hard pressed to stand in line around 7 pm again when there's a 30 minute wait. I did however try it again at 4 AM, and 4 AM me loved it.  If you don't mind patting down your pizza like you're the TSA or if you just want to taste the hype for yourself, then by all means try it! I just prefer my pizza not oozing with oil. Like others have said, $6 is affordable for Vegas, but it's pretty ridiculous elsewhere. If you're tryna be cost effective, order a whole white pie for $28 to share with friends (or if you eat it all by yourself, I commend you). Just know that it'll be an additional 20 minutes until you have that piping hot gooey pie in your hands.",

When we got to that floor, I was looking for a sign that would direct us over to Secret Pizza.. then it finally donned on me why this place has this name.  To the untrained eye, there is a hallway between two restaurants that almost looks like a service area of some sort with no indication of a restaurant being located at the end. As you continue to walk up to and down that hallway, it became very clear that there is a pizza place at the end of the hallway.  At the time that we showed up, the line was rather short. But about 10 minutes later, a line had formed up behind us that almost reached the other end of that hallway. $1 for water, $4 for a soda, $5.25 per slice of pizza and for a bit more you can get a whole pizza. I got a slice of pepperoni pizza and sausage pizza. That pepperoni pizza is probably the BEST that I have ever had! If you're in Vegas and near The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, make sure to stop by and give Secret Pizza a try.  TL;DR this pizza is amazing! Just be ready to pay a premium if you want to try several different types of pizza by the slice.",

We also ordered their sliced meatball and ricotta slice, which was just okay (a little bland). When you place your order, they put the slices through a warmer so everything comes out crispy and melty! There is mostly just standing at their counters to eat, but I believe there were a few barstools. There are shakers of parm cheese, red pepper flakes, and oregano on the counter that is easy enough to share with patrons. They also had some arcade games like Galaga! The game was on the tv, so many faces were turned in that direction.  I also asked for a sprite fountain drink and got a free refill. I don't know if I got the refill free because that's how it always is, or if it's because they momentarily forgot my cheese slice and I waited an extra minute for it to get warmed up. Either way, I really appreciated the extra fizz since I had been enjoying myself a bit much the past two days in Vegas.  heh.   I debated coming back here the next day for lunch and/or taking a couple slices home with me, but I was packed to the gills, no room in luggage/carry-on or in my belly. Thanks!",

If you go in a large group, it'd be more cost effective if you order a whole pizza.  ($31 for 1 topping, not including tax...). there will be at least a25 minute wait time bc it is made to order. A lot of people come here to get pizza after a long night of partying/ clubbing/ drinking.  The con about this place is you can't really eat there.  There's not enough seats (usually taken up by people who are waiting on their order). You can find a spot outside in the hotel lobby area... If you're lucky.",

I came in ordering a whole pie and the cashier had the audacity to comment to an employee because of the amount of whole pies being ordered that there are some picky people. I didn't know ordering a whole pie was being picky. So I still order my whole pie. Paid and left a pre-tip which I shouldn't have considering the fact that they gave my pizza when she told me it would be ready in half an hour. I leave because my husband and toddler are outside. Not much waiting  room inside the business. Why ask for my name and then give my pizza away? Why aren't you checking receipts to pizza ticket? Just because I left during the half hour time and came back 5 mins before the 30 min wait, how did you manage to give my pizza away? Yes my toddler loves her white pizza but I'll be taking my business elsewhere. If the employees can't handle the customers to the beginning of the hallway, then how are the employees suppose to handle orders when the line goes out to the lobby?",

The pepperoni is fine but the signature white pie is actually worth the hype: garlicky, cheesy, just a little bit gooey, and those tomatoes just make it extra special. Service is friendly, spot is bare-bones but in a good way, snag a stool if you see one available!  Note: Some people take the \"secret\" part a little too literally- it's not on any maps or even the Cosmopolitan website. Go to the 3rd floor with all the other restaurants, and find the hallway between Blue Ribbon Sushi  and Jaleo.",

I'm inclined to agree - especially since I've had pretty much all the \"best\" NYC pizzas. The pizza here was thin, the crust was thin, and the sauce was sweet and tomato-y. I definitely felt like I was eating a slice of pizza back home in NYC.   Is it the best slice of pizza I've ever had? No. But it was pretty darn good and very close to home. I enjoyed the pizza we had. We had ordered a pie to go and brought it back to our room at the MGM. It was still hot and tasty by the time we got back - I think the walk was about 15 minutes, give or take.   I highly recommend you pay Secret Pizza a visit if you're in Vegas - it's some pretty solid pizza and isn't too expensive either. It's a super delish and quick meal for a low cost.",

Yes the pizza is thin and the cheese sauce is good but that's really all. It's good but not the best. The guys working here are super nice and $5.00-5.50 for one freaken slice of pizza is really not worth it.   I wouldn't rush back I think there are plenty of other options for pizza on the strip.

The best thing about this place is how accessible it is, how fast it is to get the pizza, and how it's unique to Cosmos without having to eat at one of the fast food franchises outside the hotel.   You wait in line to order whatever slice of pizza they have left. The pizza is fresh, and the pieces are nice and large. It hit the spot since I had nothing to eat since I first arrived in Las Vegas. I was happy that I didn't just stop at Popeyes or Subway and decided to look for this place via yelp as I was pretty hungry and tired.  People were okay serving the pizzas. The person behind the cashier counter was friendly though. I can see how this place can be very nice to have when it's really late at night. It's surrounded by higher end restaurants and definitely a bit hidden, but worth checking out if you're at Cosmos or near the area.",

It took a good 30 minutes to get to the front and order. Luckily, waiting was kinda entertaining. They have different old albums and movie covers posted along the walls of their hallway.   For the pizza, I thought it was pretty expensive. It was like around $30 for a whole pizza and around $4-5 per slice. Of course, you gotta factor in that it is Vegas and it is also pretty hyped up, so they get good business regardless. The pizza was done in a New York style. It had a thin crust, a mild amount of toppings, and some good cheese. There was not anything life-changing about the pizza, but it was still a good snack/meal. They make a very simple pizza, but they do it right. Plus it is cheaper than most things in you'll find in Vegas.",

Soon enough, we got on the correct floor and found the long hallway with records all along the wall. Yay, we made it! There was quite a line at midnight, so don't come too hangry. I've ordered the sausage pizza before and thought it was decent. This time, I decided to try the famous white pizza.     I wasn't expecting much, but the white pizza blew me away.

    "text": "It's a hidden gem inside The Cosmo!   No one is quite sure if the Cosmopolitan's Secret Pizza joint was planned, or one of the mega-resort's designers had a coke-binge one weekend & added a secret corridor with no signs for one of the best pizzas in Las Vegas. Located between a glass elevator and the sushi joint, you can see guys who probably were just shipped in from Brooklyn, throw pizza in the air like a pro. The pizza just isn't fun to watch being made, but it is amazingly tasty, crispy and perfect to hold slightly bent and folded like a boy from Brooklyn.    Secret Pizza is a New York-style pizza place with a casual feel. There's no signage in the front and it's not easy to spot if you were walking by. Hidden on the third floor of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, you won't know this little eatery is there unless you follow the record-lined hallway. After passing album covers from Frank Sinatra, Elvis and other music notables on the wall, you're spilled into a tiny, standing room only place.   At the walk-up counter, fresh pizza like pepperoni, cheese and veggie is offered by the slice. If you want a whole pizza to take to your room, it usually takes about 15 minutes. But don't worry, the brightly-colored pinball machine is always a fun way to pass the time if you're waiting. There is a high-top counter to stand at while eating a slice and a few mismatched stools. In addition to soft drinks, a few select beers are available. For seasonings, Secret Pizza keeps it simple: Parmesan cheese, cherry pepper and oregano in old-fashioned spice shakers.  Even though I've always heard about this New York-style pizza joint that specializes in a \"secret slice\" of mouth-watering, delectable, and often satisfying pies of cheesy & sauce-y goodness - I finally got a chance to visit & try their so-called \"secret pizza\". Glad I did! It was aiight, but I definitely had better - although, during that situation, it was a heavenly slice! Haha. On the other hand, this unnamed, discreet establishment - hidden down an unmarked corridor, just seems to fly under the radar of the Cosmos's many award-winning restaurants & dining options. The cheap & delicious slices are gaining a strong following, most especially during the wee hours of the night into early dawn! They're pretty much open throughout the day - opening at 11 a.m., until to about 4 - 5 a.m. in the morning!  Pro-tip: If the line gets too long in the standing-room-only space, you can always pass the time by trying to beat the high score on the old-school Galaga machine tucked in a cramped corner.  Who you will meet: Drunk tourists who thought hallway led to bathroom and hot clubbers pigging on pizza.  Highly recommended! This pizza is even amazing if you get out of the club YOU KNOW WHAT! (i.e. tipsy, drunk, the feeling that you just threw up & need some recovery food, LOL) - don't say I didn't tell you!",

    "text": "I'm a local and I've been coming here since opening.  It's the only place in Las Vegas where I can get a slice that actually tastes like New York.  And I don't know if it's trained into me from my college days in NYC but I MUST have a greasy slice of fold-able pizza in the middle of the night after a few drinks (with a beer nightcap)...  Yeah, it's over priced, that's for sure, but it's also Vegas at a fancy pants hotel AND it's really good.  Commodities are based on market value and hey if people want to pay double what they should for this excellent pizza then why shouldn't the place charge that?  I'm not saying it's right but capitalism.  HA!  You'll find it.  Don't try to hard.  Don't be trepidatious about it either.  Walk down a hallway you don't think you should.  Believe me this place is security-ed up.  If they don't want you in a hallway there will be a door with a sign or someone WILL stop you.  And anyway it isn't that secret anymore.  The hallway is next to Blue Ribbon and has light at the end and old records on the wall.  There will probably be a line so that will help mark the place too.    Once you get there, ask about what else they have.  If it's busy they'll put the other flavors on the shelf below what you can see.  If they have the Sicilian thick crust, get it.  You won't regret it.",

It's fun to see all the Italian record covers. All your guys are there. Frank, Dean, Jerry...  The pizza oven is a beast. It bakes up whatever the guys toss in there perfectly. I had the meatball ricotta pizza. It was amazing. They slice the slightly spicy meatball thin and pair it with the ricotta. It's magnificent. It is what pizza dreams are made of. The sauce is so perfect. Everything you want in a sauce but didn't even know you were looking for it. The crust was thin and perfectly crisp where you needed it to be.   Secret pizza has the right recipe. The line that keeps growing and the looks on people's faces as they eat it tells it all.   If you are in Vegas and want the best piece of pie you've ever had head over to the Cosmopolitan's third level and get in the line in the hallway next to Blue Ribbon. You will not be disappointed.",

Besides all this, the pizza is honestly some of the best I've tasted. It really feels like I'm eating some authentic New York style pizza.

Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and a slight twinge resembling sourdough.   Seating is limited so we took our slices out into the foyer and sat at a large wooden table. Their also is a foosball table with glass over the top so you could potentially sit there, have your slice, and play a match or two. If you do sit outside of the place don't be surprised if people start asking you where the secret pizza place is.

It is better if you get a whole pizza for 25 bucks and is enough for 2 or 3 people, it is huge. The place feels like you are walking into a restroom, but the pizza's good. They make lots of $$$$$$",

The line was long, however it did NOT move quickly at all. I don't see how this is an issue. Make several pizzas. Sell pizzas, sell slices of pizzas. Get the line moving. When we got to the front of the line, it at least sounded apparent to me that someone didn't show up for work. However there were only two people working there.. so does that mean three was considered sufficient? Given the line, I'd say it was not, but maybe they just don't care. I want to give them some slack but my feet hurt, I was hungry and tired and they just straight up weren't making enough pizza anyways.  Anyways, the price was reasonable, but the menu was also unclear to me so I just ordered what I saw. Or maybe what I saw was all they had. I guess they don't have to staff more people because this is the only pizza place and food you can get until 5am. Awesome?",

You see a dark hallway with one of those secret looking wall doors that is wide open, almost as if you were going back in time to those old school pizza places, you see a couple of pin ball machines and thus you have finally arrived at the secret pizza's of all pizzas.   Order the White pizza with ricotta cheese and mozzarella and only this. It is one of the most greasy, delicious,  white looking pizzas that I have ever tasted,   And yeah haha it doesn't really have a name btw or a sign or something that will imply that it's located there. At first I thought it was called Secret Pizza but then when my cousin asked a bartender \"where's the secret pizza was located at?\" He gave us a weird look and said no such thing existed lol so we felt stupid until he told us about a pizzeria upstairs.",

    "text": "Secret 1 - Yes, I was trying to look you in the eyes, but I'm a man and my eyes tend to stray. Secret 2 - I'm a bit shy.  So buy me alcohol and I'll open up a bit. Secret 3 - If you are female and I left you a compliment, it's likely I think you are cute.  Not so for men.  No more secrets!!  I've given too much away--unless you go the Secret 2 route.  Service - 5 Stars Cleanliness - Excellent Price - Approximately $26.00 (The soon to be brother-in-law paid). Seafood - ?? Meats - Yes Vegetables - Yes Dessert - Yes, Cannoli & New York Cheesecake. Fruits - N/A Other - (1) Located on Level 3 of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, (2) You will find it between Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill and Jaleo. (3) Cash and Credit Cards are accepted here.  (4) Papst Blue Ribbon Beer is on tap here.  (5) Avoid the times 1 am to 5 am because that is the busiest times--that is when all The Situations and J Wowws come out from Marquee.    What was Ordered:  Pizza with 4 toppings ($26.00) - A-Okay (3 Stars) - My sister and fiance chose a 3 topping pizza.  One side was pepperoni and green peppers pizza.  The other side was sausage and roasted garlic.  All pizza here is thin crust and the large pizza has 8 large slices.  Here is the breakdown by slice:  *The Crust - Meh! I've had better (2 Stars) - You are looking at approximately a 14\" diameter of thin crust with tomato sauce and melted cheese.  One word comes to mind, \"greasy.\"    *Sausage and Roasted Garlic - Meh! I've had better (2 Stars) - The sausage was good, but I think the Roasted Garlic was forgotten--maybe that's why they charged us the 3 topping price.  Plus, I do not think they gave us enough of the sausage per slice to make it more fulfilling.  *Pepperoni and Green Peppers - A-Okay (3 Stars) - Probably the best combination of toppings that made the pizza tasty.  The pepperoni tasted like it was suppose to.  What brought this slice up a notch was the flavor of the roasted green peppers.    The Secret Pizza is really in a nondescript location--with no signage at all.  If you are near a random billiards table, you are in the right place.  The place is A-Ok, but I've experienced better.  Maybe if I was crazy drunk and just got out of the club, this place would have been rated higher.  Unfortunately, I'm sober.",

    "text": "The journey to the Secret Pizza (No Name Pizza...whatever you call it) is as fascinating as actually eating the pizza itself.  The other reviews pretty much give great hints to finding it but yes, it's in the Cosmo and go up a bit.  After searching a bit, I gazed down that mysterious hallway that everyone says to look for and seeing the pinball machines made my heart go a-flutter.  Entering the Secret Pizza Parlor, there really isn't anything except the menu and a few workers making the pizza (both in slices and boxes).    When I went, the price was around $4.50 for a slice for a cheese or 'white' New York style pizza, extra for a few more ingredients and they have PBR (and something else) on top along with some wine.  You order up and while you wait, there's an old Galaga machine along with two pinball machines and some parlor style chairs.  I ordered a 'white' pizza and a PBR.  The white pizza is a cheese pizza mixed with several piles of feta cheese with herbs mixed in.  What an amazing combination.  That pizza was quite delicious and downing it with on tap PBR, it was well worth everything.    So if you're around Vegas, whether it's in the afternoon or late at night, and you're hungry for something delicious, something cool and something that won't break your wallet - go to the Secret Pizza.  Unless you absolutely abhor pizza, you're missing out.",

Just go to the Cosmopolitan and find the escalator and the directory will tell you its on the 3rd floor.  If your faculty to read has left you (and that does happen sometimes in Las Vegas) just look for the folks who are walking around in the hotel with white, plain pizza boxes and ask them where they got it.  What's really likeable about this joint is that: a.) it really keeps to its mysterious charm. There's no sign, just a dark hallway that you would pass and wouldn't even know it was there if you weren't looking for it on purpose.  b.) Its so unexpected. You'd never think you'd find a place that serves pizza for $4.50 a slice in the trendy and posh Cosmopolitan hotel.  There is nothing fancy about this place - they serve your pizza on paper plates and soda in a red dixie cup!  They also have beer.  c.) The pizza is SO DANG good! Good in a \"Man I'm so drunk and I hella want a pizza right now\" way as well as when you're sober.  The thin crust is perfectly crispy and you know that its really good pizza when it stays that way even if its been sitting out on the warmers and reheated for you.  The WHITE pizza is has no red sauce but olive oil instead, and has a great combo of parmesan, mozzarella and dollops of ricotta.  Super flavorful and super cheesy.  The Pepperoni and Combo slices we got were just as delicious and with just the right amount of sauce and toppings to hold well with the glorious thin crust.  Great to have a slice there and good to buy a whole pie to take back to the room.  Did I tell you that I don't keep secrets very well?  ;)  Not this kind anyway!",

I can't even comment on the other two as we were just dying over the White Pizza. We ordered it because we felt like we \"should\" since it was supposed to be the most popular. It was amazing...a bit oily, but full of garlic and cheese. Loved it.   Probably would be even better after a late night of drinking, but a meal right before driving home was pretty good too.  Its a casual place. Sodas served in red solo cups (for $4...). The unmarked, unadvertised part of it is so fun. And if you've been to the Cosmopolitan before you'll be shocked to see where it is. We've sat there and people watched probably 2 or 3 times and never saw the hallway to the restaurant.",

    "text": "At the end of a walkway hall with records is some hidden pizza. This place has no signage and is located on the 3rd floor of Cosmopolitan. It's hidden... yet tons of people seem to be able to find this place and devour their pizza. Proof that if you offer something good, people will find you.   I came here with my friend after watching Rose. Rabbit. Lie. I had one drink there... but it was sooo strong that it made me feel sick and I was in some dire need of some quick comfort food to ease my tummy.  We looked for this place on the signs... none of which says Secret Pizza anywhere... so I looked on my trusted Yelp for clues. Like I said initially,  it's located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan hotel. It's in a corner... but if you spot the pool tables (which are easily visible) the wall of records leading to Secret Pizza is right in front of it.   The hallway is not too long... but it feels very exclusive/secret at you have to walk this hallway to get to it. Lol. The pizza place itself is very small with very few seats. My friend and I beat the crowd because we were able to get seats and have no line, well, only 2 people in front of me. After I got my pizza and came back to my friend who was saving seats... the place was packed! Even just standing it was packed!  Anyways, as far as it being just one slice of pizza... the price was okay. I'm used to Costco's $2 slices haha. Here, they have pizza with the red sause (tomatoe) or white sauce. A cheese slice is $4.50, white is $5, or red with toppings is $5.50. I had a red slice with pepperoni,  sausages,  and mushrooms. The pizza was good!! Very tasty and the crust was cripsy. I loved it! A nice warm cheesy, crunchy, savory,  and tasty bite each time. The slices are pretty big... so for $5.50 it wasn't too bad! Of course I ate the whole slice and my stomach was satisfied. So glad we came here and got some pizza to counter the alcohol I was carrying in my stomach. It was the perfect counter to drinking in Vegas. Just beware that the slices are pretty greasy... so if you're worried about that, use napkins to soak up some before you eat!  Service here was nothing special. Not good, not bad. Seating is bar style on 2 walls... but there's only like 5 chairs I saw? Definitely not enough for everyone to sit... the rest of your party will have to stand... ot take it out to the pool table area where there are a few couches around. Chili and permeasean cheese are out at the bar area along with napkins. They also have a pinball machine here! I'm not sure if it works as I didnt notice anyone playing it.  This place is open all nigh, and late night too. So it's perfect after a night out in Vegas of drinking, dancing, partying. Its hidden.... but if all the stumbling drunk people can find it, then you can too!! 3rd floor of Cosmopolitan hotel near the pool tables... just follow the wall of records!",

A bit pricey but for a one time fun vacation outing it was worth it. Would return if in a pizza craving mood again.",

    "text": "I must say that this is some of the best pizza I've had in a long time! Crust is perfect- thin but not crispy. Sauce is BOSS- just enough tomato flavor to let you know it's there. And toppings (we had the 3 meat- pepperoni, sausage and meatball) were real sliced meat, not those crappy crumbles you get at some pizza places. After eating one slice, I was asking for a friend to handle the rest. So don't think you will need several slices to get your fill.  Ok, the taste and quality of ingredients would earn this place a 5 star rating with me, but I could only give them 4 stars because there is absolutely no space remotely close to enjoy eating the pizza. I wanted so badly to get that first bite in, and it took forever to find a spot ( down the escalator twice and a random seat in the casino at Cosmopolitan) to eat my pizza. I was so uncomfortable trying to hold my plate and napkins in one hand while folding one slice to eat with the other hand. So my suggestion is to scope out a spot to eat your pizza before you get in line. A pizza this good should be enjoyed immediately and in a comfortable environment. Lastly, I feel their menu is a little overpriced. A whopping $6.25 for a slice with 3 toppings, $4 for a single soda, and $8.00 for a 2 liter of soda, but the good thing is that tax was included.",

I love pizza, so when a group of friends couldn't decide on what to eat, this place was the perfect spot.  There's no signs, just an open door leading into a picture framed hallway. You look up at the simple menu. Immediately we noticed NO RANCH. Dang!! It's ok though. The pizza was still good without it. It's about $5 a slice for a plain cheese pizza, but with 5 of us, a couple dollars more per person got us a fresh whole pie. We opted for the white, which comes with mozzarella cheese and ricotta. It was quite tasty!!! A little but on the greasy side, but that's what happens when you order a pizza that's ALL cheese.   It was a solid pizza spot, but for the pricing and the fact that there's hardly anywhere to sit, I'd still rather have Grimaldi's.  P.S. This would be an awesome spot if I was drunk!",

We came in during the early evening for a quick snack. They actually had a decent selection of pizza slices and their vegetarian slice had a nice variety and amount of veggies. While it didn't blow me away, it's good for what it is: a good slice of no-fills pizza. It's one of the more affordable options in Vegas and good to grab a slice on the go (or after drinking, I'd imagine this is pretty clutch).

Yes the pizza is very good, and you can eat it in a nice area, ( take your slice and walk down hall to the right)but it is 6.00 a slice pizza and similar but not as good as a New Jersey or Philly slice.  If you haven't had east coast pizza you will probably love this pizza.   Employees were pleasant enough, water is 4.00 (really?) . It's Convenient, food is good , and if you don't want to have an expensive dinner it's a good option.",

No messing around, this is the spot. The other slices are good, but the pizza you need to get is the WHITE PIZZA. It's a flavor explosion in the mouth; a little bit of garlic, cheesy creamy ricotta cheese, hints of heaven in every bite.   Tip: there's always a line; call ahead and get the pizza pre ordered. If you can get there 5-10min earlier than the time they give you because the pizza is hot and fresh  I've had this pizza cold, like next day cold but still fire. I've had the pizza sitting out by coming late from the call in order and it's still fire. BUT when the pizza is fresh fresh, it's seriously FIRE. No matter where this spot is on the list of places to visit when you come to Vegas, make sure it's on the list.",

You will probably have some difficulty finding this spot, so I highly suggest asking someone to help you get there. There are no signs and it's literally a sharply right when you get off the elevator. Right when you walk in there's a hallway of record albums framed ceiling to the walls. Reminded me something I would see in New York. Try to get there before midnight. We did and it was perfect timing because once it was a little after midnight there was a line and it gets pretty packed in this tiny area. I wish they had more space for seating. But the fact that they don't gives them that authentic hidden gem feel. There's a great variety of pizza. They also have wine and beer for sale there. We brought our own. Definitely worth it! Especially after a long night!",

    "text": "OMG. After living in New York and moving back to California, I've been on the search for thin, delicious NY style pizza that my heart longs for. FINALLY, secret pizza is it!!!   Located in Cosmo, you won't find Secret Pizza listed on any directory. It's on the third floor (the level above Eggslut) and hidden down an alleyway across from the escalator. Once you're hit with the delicious smells of garlic, marinara, and bread, you'll know you're there. I visited around 4pm on Saturday, and the wait was 20 mins long. The inside is rather small with a few old school arcade games and limited seating.   I ordered a slice of the white pizza, and it was amazing. Hot, gooey cheese mixed with flavorful garlic in every bite. My tastebuds were in heaven. Definitely comparable to pizza I've had in New York! My only regret is that I only ordered one slice lol.",

We went at 8pm so there wasn't a long line. I had a couple of plain slices. The cheese was good and the sauce was ok. The dough was better than most but not as good at the authentic ny slices but this is Vegas so I am ok with that.   They reheated and when I folded my slice the front was a little too soggy and fell forward but I caught it before all the cheese slid off.",

I remember thinking the white pizza was really dry, so I just tried their regular cheese. It was good! The slice is huge as well. Definitely get an entire pizza for a better value.  I think the highlight of this place is when you're drunk. There are lots of drunk people in line to bond with. Even if you're sober, there are lots of drunk people in line for you to watch. One group of guys was clearly on the brink of a black out, but they weren't causing a scene and were just laughing uncontrollably at everything.  I'm sure there is better pizza on the strip, but Secret Pizza has become a rite of passage for anyone who visits Vegas.",

The garlicky taste of the sauce and the cheese just explodes in flavor. This pizza is meant to be eaten right away or if your hotel is super close by. The pizza isn't good cold or to have as left overs. Bummed that it wasn't as good cold. But seriously one of the best pizzas me and the bf have ever eaten (warm and steamy of course).

Expect to wait 20ish minutes and make sure to order a cup of ranch with your order - as it's freaking delicious.  This place really isn't much of a secret any more.  It's on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo and you'll likely see people near the front of the unmarked entryway eating some pizza and contemplating going back for more pizza.  I'd just like to echo the fact that the white pizza is the absolute bomb.  Their regular pies are really good too and you can order by the slice and add custom toppings (most people do this) or order a whole pie (this is the hack).  Slices aren't cheap, but if you have 2+ people with you I'd bet you could crush an entire pizza and you'll save $$ doing this as well.  If you do get a whole pie ask them to bake it a little longer, as the bottom of the pizza can be a little soft (individual slices aren't as they're baked twice).  Be careful though ordering a whole pie as you might get jumped - walking through the casino with that box of smells was dangerous and turned tons of heads.   Seriously - order the ranch.  It's house made and freaking delicious.",

My only issue with this place is that I discovered it on the last night of my vacation!!! I'm already looking forward to my next vacation up to Vegas and this will be the first place I eat at.

    "text": "MY ORDER: White Pizza, Sausage & Ricotta Pizza  TASTE: The White Pizza is a MUST! Really cheesy and creamy, but not to the point where it makes you feel nauseous or want to throw up (as I feel happens with a lot of overly rich, cheesy foods). The Sausage & Ricotta Pizza was pretty good too, but the White Pizza definitely stands out more and has a more memorable flavor. I love that the crust is thin because it doesn't make you feel like you're just eating bread the entire time.  COST: I came with a big party and wasn't the one who ordered the pizzas, but I believe the pizzas were around $30 each for the whole pie.   WAIT TIME: The line was very long, and my party waited around 30 minutes in line, and then around another 20 minutes for our pizzas to come out (ordered 2 whole pies). For how long the line is though, it moves pretty quickly and thankfully, pizza is a fast food to make!  LOCATION: The location definitely lives up to its name, but if you have trouble finding the place, you could ask any of the workers at the Cosmopolitan and they'd be able to redirect you. The place is hidden in a little alley-like area upstairs!",

It's that hallway that always has a long line sticking out of the vinyl filled wall that moves (in my typical East Coaster opinion) way too slow. I attempted to grab a slice FOUR TIMES before I was actually like ok this line is somewhat reasonable I'll stand and wait. Even then it took 35 minutes.   Saturday 4pm - packed. Saturday 7pm - packed. Saturday 8pm - beyond packed. Sunday 3am - beyond beyond packed. Sunday 1pm - finally a line I have patience to wait in.  Pizza was good and I give these guys props. After waiting in line and watching four separate people stage photoshoots with their slices in the process (wish I was kidding but I'm not!) I finally got my ginormous slice of pizza with oversized pepperoni. Props to that. It was good but not waiting in line forever good. Not worth the hype.   The Cosmopolitan should really give them a larger space given that they're not very secret and draw a large crowd.",

This is still one of my favorite spots to grab a cheap, post-drinking, late night bite on the Vegas Strip. Depending on what time you go, the line can either be super short or out the door, but it moves rather quickly. Either way, you won't regret coming here.   Current price per slice...$5.75. A whole pie...$28.75. My personal favorites: The Pepperoni and White Slice. New York style thin crust, with the right balance of crunch and chew. Two slices and i'm a happy gal. I recommend getting a whole pie if you've got 3 or more people in your group. Minimal seating inside, just a long tabletop and with a couple stools, but there is plenty of seating just outside of the pizzeria.   Simple, delicious, and always comes in clutch.",

    "text": "Secret Pizza offers a quick food fix when inside of The Cosmopolitan. It has a \"speakeasy\" hidden vibe when headed there as no clear signage and it being tucked further into a hallway. I probably did not come at peak time as the wait time was decent although busy, I could see this place being busier than that. There isn't that much space to eat there, but if you do find a spot you will most likely be by the ledge where people will grab the condiments next to you.   PIZZA: White pizza and meatball ricotta pizza  The pizza was good, not great. I prefer more sauce than they put, but the cheese and toppings were delish. I think the hype is related more to the hidden gem of finding it and the variety they have. The pricing is decent to enjoy some thin crust pizza when in Cosmo.",

They're pizzas are done in a classic NYC manner where they have the giant pizzas out to view and you pick your slice and they heat it up for you in the oven as you go down the line. They're known for their white pizza but all of they're pizzas are really good! The slices are large, thin, and foldable. You can also take a whole pizza to-go if you're okay with waiting a bit!  Open late and super conveniently located in the Cosmo making it a great post-bar snack!  I would highly recommend it if you like pizza aka everyone who's reading this!",

The white Pizza tastes like a combination of garlic and Alfredo sauce, but it's not Alfredo sauce. It's so interesting and cream and garlicy, it's an incredible pizza slice and they must try. The meatball Ricotta is really good because the meatball rounds taste like sausage patties and the ricotta makes everything so much creamier.   The slices aren't thick so don't be intimidated by ordering a whole pizza. We went through a whole one faster than we thought we would LOL This place really knows how to make pizza right!",

Lines can get long so if you dont like to wait order by phone and go pick it up.

We came here straight from our flight because we hadn't had dinner and it was a place that we wanted to try that was still open at 1:30AM on a Thurs. There's only about four stools inside so it's a take-out type of place. There are long couches outside by the elevators as well if you're lucky to grab a seat.   Greasy food with yummy thin crispy crusts. They have pies on the counter and underneath as well, so if you wanted something that's not on top, just ask! I got here when there was a line nearly to the entrance of the hallway. After I got my slice, the line was gone! So timing's everything here. When I finally got my slices, I was so hungry that I forgot to pat down the slice with a napkin to take off the tons of extra oil. Oh well.. vacation! :D  My order: Slice of White Pie Slice of Pepperoni & Mushroom  I'm fairly partial to red sauces, so I enjoyed the simple pepperoni & mushroom more. Both were really good though.  Note: If you're ordering a whole pizza, I highly suggest calling in because it'll take about 20min.",

You guys can find it on your own next time your in Vegas ;)   Personally I thought the pizza was alright. I mean its great when your drunk. But sober, mehhhhh. If you go at night after the club, they don't have a lot of variety of different pizzas to choose from, so that was a little disappointing. I went here twice after going out and each time they only had 2 choices of pizza =/   I kind of wish I made time to check this place out earlier in the evenings so I could have more varieties of pizza to choose from. I mean looking at other yelpers, it seems like they serve more then just the two choices.",

I was fortunate that as soon as I got to the counter to order a whole fresh pizza just had come out of the oven. Although my fiance' was not so fortunate. The slices he chose to try looked liked they had been sitting there from the night before and then reheated for a short amount of time. I tried a bite from his slices but didn't even compare to the fresh slice I had. Slices are a hit or miss. Will come back if lines are shorter and to order a fresh whole pizza.",

My favorite is the white pizza, vegetarian friendly, however you really can't go wrong with any of the options. The slices are about $5.50, you tell them what you want and they go straight into the oven to be reheated and you received a delicious warm, cheesy, gooey slice of heaven.

A  You can grab a slice or a whole pizza. They have some ready to go ranging from pepperoni, cheese, combo, and white slice. Recently they even had a deep dish version of the white slice, looked awesome but a bit much for me. You could also add toppings to all he slices and they will stick it in the oven for you.    My go-to slice is simple: white slice with roasted tomatoes. The ricotta and white sauce combined with the tangy tomatoes is out of this world.

    "text": "Love this place!  I was in Vegas over the weekend for and our group ended up getting pizza from here twice!  First time we ordered a white pie and it was pretty dang amazing.  Reminded me of New York style pizza where the slices are bigger than your head.  I really can't NOT tell you about the pickled peppers if you haven't had them before.  If you're ordering, ASK FOR THE PICKLED PEPPERS!!  Not sure what they call 'em but they'll understand.  If you like spicy, sweet, sour, pickled peppers.. you gotta try these. With every bite or every other bite of your pizza (the choice is yours).  $1 for a small container full.  If you're planning on ordering a pie, call in advance about half hour and it'll be ready for you for pick-up and you don't have to wait in line.  We did this the second night and just b-lined to the front counter to pay and picked up our pie.  Yes, they do have a free filtered water machine near the cash register but it was down this night.  The white pie deliciousness made up for it though.  Second pizza we ordered was half pepps and half cheese.  Was pretty greasy this time around and needed a couple napkins to dab the oil off.  Still good though.  Will definitely be back.",

Before I knew of this place, I accidently stumbled in without thinking much of it and walked right out.  Four months later, I was told of this must try secret pizza location. And, I was there! In that area looking for food. -_- FAIL!  After hearing about the super delish, must try, best ever reviews from fellow Yelpers, fams and friends. I made it a mission to try it on my next mini vaca in Vegas.  My feedback: Hum.. meh, it was just okay. Maybe I was expecting too much, I am not sure.  I knew for a fact, it wasn't the BEST pizza I ever had. I would say that its the better pizza joint that Vegas has on the strip.   Then the question of: was everyone who had this awesome, epic pizza experiences drunk when they had it?! That's why its the best thing ever?!  I decided to give this place another try when I return back in a month. Hopefully, it would be better.  Notes: Seats are limited. No tables, you can eat outside the place, there is random couches seating area. They do offer pizza and soda deals.",

The pepperoni and sausage one was the best in my opinion. The pizza is a little overpriced as well as the pitchers of beers, but not enough to keep customers from coming back.",

But I will definitley stop short of saying spectacular.  Meaning was is worth the over 1hr wait?  HECK NO.  This place is a bit overpriced.  But I guess when its 2 AM and you're hungry, its all good.  We ordered a whole pie.  Pepperoni.  Realized we'd been waiting over 45 minutes.  Turns out that our pizza got placed into the line and cut up.  The gal at the register, was like, \"Duh, I don't know\" it's coming.  The guy making the pizzas on the other hand....  +1 his Customer Service skills.  I was pretty ticked off, and he got me before I blew up.  He talked me down pretty quickly and actually managed to make me feel sheepish for getting so bent out of shape.  He gave me the next pizza out of the oven, the line had to wait.  Comped the pizza and all the drinks we wanted which was just the 1 two liter we'd originally paid for.  Offered more drinks...  Anyway, I felt bad for not giving him a chance to make it right before I started to go off the deep end with him, I tipped the jar $5 of the money I got back.  Did I have a right to be upset?  Absolutely. Was my issue corrected?  Immediately. Was I happy when I left? Most definitely. Would I go back?  Probably not.  But that's cause I'm not in Vegas to eat Pizza.",

For about $5/slice, this is a great destination for after you've shopped/drank/gambled your wad and are looking for some cheesy, greasy comfort.",

The pepperoni, sausage and banana peppers, and the ricotta were our faves, but you can't go wrong. Not too bad on pricing, especially for vegas. Also it's open 24 hours.  Brooklyn style and the crust has just the right amount if crunch. Staff us friendly. Clean.",

    "text": "Checked out this secret spot right after I saw the free Naked & Famous concert @ the Blvd pool.  Crazy enough, I've passed by this place a majority of the time I've come to the Cosmo but never noticed it.  The hallway is right next to Blue Ribbon, wedged right next to the restaurant on the right of it.  The hallway was clearly decorated with vintage album covers.  At the end of the hallway there were 2 pinball games (a Vegas & Monopoly machine) & a Galaga!  I got the white pizza and my friend got regular cheese w/ mushrooms.  Initially, I didn't really like the taste of the white pizza($4), because whatever cheeses are thrown to them, but after it cooled off a bit, it was actually pretty tasty.  My friends pizza had a nice crispy crust with little sauce but was still really good overall.  This place is a good & cheap spot to go if you're on a budget.",

The restaurant is small (like any little pizzeria that sells slices), and is next to the Sushi restaurant...and they are open until 5am!

I believe that there are redeeming qualities in everyone and everything, so I can't give it 1 star.  2 star's because of the cool Sinatra pictures in the hallway leading to the \"secret\" location.  The pizza and the service were lousy though.  We got 4 slices so we could try one of each of the 4 different pizzas that they had available.  None of them had any flavor!!!  I mean, I was really looking forward to the white pizza based on reviews, but honestly all 4 slices tasted like greasy cardboard.  And the fact that it was WAY overpriced at $6 per slice made it even worse.  $6 for greasy cardboard?!  Be good to your tastebuds and your wallet and go to Pizza Rock or Grimaldi's instead.  This place is not worth the price or the wait.",

Nice, small joint, with a flat screen on the wall, two pinball machines, and an arcade video game.  All of the five or six stools were taken, but I was fine standing at the counter getting my pizza on.  I came on a weekday afternoon so it wasn't busy at all.  I'm sure during the evenings or late-night hours, the place must get crazy packed.  Definitely worth checking out if you're at the Cosmo or just want some seriously delicious pizza!",

Anywho, be prepared for some gooey and greasy goodness in your mouth! The pizza slices are huge and their toppings are yummmmmy. My favorite is the meatball.   Biggest problem is that you sometimes have to wait 30-45 min for a whole pizza, which is what happened to my friends and I last time. I'd say it's worth the wait though!  In terms of trying to find this place, go to the third floor of the Cosmo and it's near the Marquee entrance! If you see the pool table and chairs to your left, the entrance will be the right. You'll see a hallway that has a bunch of cool photos/album covers on the wall and BAM, you're there :)",

    "text": "Great authentic tasting New York pizza on the strip! Okay this place is not on the Cosmopolitan's directory or list of restaurants but it definitely is sought after especially during the wee hours and after a night filled of alcohol and dancing. As it is a \"secret\" pizza place and not listed on the directory you gotta know someone or look here on yelp to find it (it's near estiatorio milos). Just follow the line of people out the hall. They have tons of options and all are good. Yes it's a bit pricey for a pizza place ($11 for two slices) but it's on the strip and available late night and did I mention it's good? You can even call ahead for your order. A must is their white pizza!",

The entrance is nondescript and could easily be missed (see picture). It has no sign outside and when I first looked down the hallway, I thought it was the kitchen for the restaurant next door.  The price for a slice was pretty high, but then again all hotel restaurants are on the strip. Would have preferred a slice slightly bigger (even if cost more) so I didn't have to buy two.

The previous reviews were right- it's on the third floor to the left of Jaleo (if you're facing it) down a small, unmarked hallway. Look for some records on the walls and some pinball machines. Happy hunting and then happy eating!  Each slice of pizza is $5.50. Steep, yes, but you're on the Strip and that is to be expected. I tried the white pizza (white sauce with ricotta) and it was incredible. Brought home a few other different slices for my husband but unfortunately did not get to try them. The meat lovers pizza comes with house made meatballs, though!  Service was wonderful and the dude helping me was SO nice. He Saran wrapped my slices so I could stow them away in my carry on bag. I will definitely return if I am ever back in the area.   This place subsists entirely off of word of mouth is what I heard from the guys working here. There's no sign delineating where it is, so it truly is a secret. Last call is at 5 AM and they're really and truly done serving after that.",

Price: a bit more expensive, but it is Cosmo... so I'd say that it's reasonable considering it's on The Strip. Their drinks are expensive tho!  Ambiance: small, and a grab-n-go kinda place. They have tall bar tables w/ bar stools you can eat at. But again, this place is for a quick bite to eat.  Would I go here again? Maybe",

I still recommend people to try out this place just because how popular it is and how so many people love this place. Nevertheless, based on my friends and my experience, sadly, this place's $6.00 pizza was not worth the money and our time to find this place.",

    "text": "The best part of this place is the scavenger hunt to find it. The location is ridiculously obscure. The hotel doesn't even have it listed on their website. The casino is 3 floors away, and unless you're LEAVING Marquee, you wouldn't have a reason to discover this pizza place.  We found a random hallway with albums all along the wall, and I knew from reading yelp that this was the place. There was a bouncer right at the mouth of the hall, and I was half expecting them to say something, but they just nodded and said, \"Enjoy the pizza.\"  Then things started going downhill. The pizza was over-priced ($5 a slice for cheese) and mediocre at best. I had even been drinking, and it was just a let-down to be honest. The pizza was not a lot of food, and the crust was flimsy and a bit over-worked to have a nice chew/mouth-feel.  The toppings were typical of any hole-in-the-wall pizza place, and the slices waiting to be served harkened a less than stellar Sbarro feeling. The place looked out of place in the otherwise impeccable Cosmopolitan, and the drinks were served in red plastic solo cups. I'm not in college anymore, and I'm not at Circus Circus... please just give it to me in the bottle, or better yet an actual glass.  The line wasn't too bad when we arrived. (Around 9:00pm) But apparently it gets ape-shit when the clubs start to close down. If that was the case, I'd definitely not wait in line for this. But the 10 minute line wasn't that bad.... too bad the food wasn't even worth it.  In conclusion, I'd say you're better off spending your Vegas money elsewhere. It's a unique idea, with a bad product. I'd highly recommend 800 Degrees Pizza in front of the Monte Carlo for a truly amazing pizza.",

However, I will have to say that it's BRILLIANT to design a hole in the wall place with no signage.   Complete with pinball machines and Galaga, it's basically a great little area where there's some standing room to chow down on some pizza.   It looked like NY style from what I could tell and it's decorated in your little 80s pizza place.  Great stuff.  Definitely going to come back here to try it out.",

Think I prefer more of a rustic style pizza that is a litte more burnt around the edges and slightly more chewy.  But it was good and very affordable.  Beer prices seemed good until they hand hand it to you in a red cup... Talk about TINY...  It was like 8 ounces?  Definitely worth a try if you're staying in the Cosmopolitan, but I'd say skip it you're coming just for the pizza.",

If you see a hallway with old, kitschy records (vinyl y'all) and what appears to be a pin ball machine, winner, winner chicken dinner! Follow your nose and prepare to drool.   It's like the hole in the wall pizza by the slice places in NYC. There are no thrills. A pizza counter and guys making fresh dough and heating slices. A single slice is HUGE and is $4.50/$5.00 a slice. Trust me, you'll only need one.  They also sell whole pies, beer, soda, and 2 liters.  My favorite is the White Pie is my favorite. Garlicky, creamy, gooey dough heaven. My second favorite is the plain cheese. How you know the pizza is good? My mama is a New Yorker. She taught me that when you pick a slice up, the bottom half is droopy and the slice can be folded in half (taco shape). Secret Pizza does alllllll of this.  Pro Tip: If you don't want to brave the strip, the same delectable pizza is available on the West Side of town by Those Guys Pies.",

    "text": "It was a pain in the ass to find the first time around, but who can forget a place like this  after trying Secret PIzza's delicious NY style pizza.  We got a white pizza and a pep and sausage pizza when we first came here and with every trip since then, this is the first thing we pick up after finding our hotel room.   I would suggest ordering a whole pizza and eating on the spot if you aren't staying at Cosmo. You'll be able to enjoy each bite the way it was intended right out of the even. Just hope that there is a spot to sit down and eat as it does get pretty packed depending on what time you go. Unfortunately, it was packed one time and we took a taxi ride back to our hotel after picking up the pizza one time. By the time we got back it wasn't as fresh, hot, and tasty.  The down side is that the pizza is REALLY greasy  so if you're a health nut you might want to stay away. If you are going to order a whole pizza, it does take a while for it to come out. Also, if you order by the slice, beware its not going to be as good as when its right out of the oven. My girlfriend and I bought two slices that were sitting out and man were we disappointed. They even reheated it for us in the oven. The price is also pretty high...$20 for a whole pizza if I remember correctly.  In the end, the positives outweigh the negatives. Imagining the tastes of each bite at this moment gets my mouth watering. Secret Pizza is a place I would recommend to anyone who loves pizza and is in Vegas. And if you don't, maybe this establishment will change your mind. It's that good!",

It's probably both.. heh  Anywho, me and my friends usually split the same thing every single time: A white pie with sausage. Why change something you know and love? We've also tried other pizzas but this one has remained True and steady to our hearts.  A pie can cost you around $25-30 depending on what you get and if you add anything. Your choice, your money. Of course, they also sell by the slice premade but we also order a fresh one and just wait, sometimes 20-30 minutes for our pie.  There's a water cooler for drinks as well as beverages for purchase. The interior is a vintage arcade meets pizza parlor and there are several pinball and video game machines for those waiting.   Seating can be a bit meh, but we always just eat outside near the pool tables or on the long tables along the side by the restrooms.

I walked from Vdara (took the tram and walked the rest of the way which took ~ 20-30 mins total) with a few friends after we finished clubbing at the Wynn hotel. The wait was hellaaa long (about 45 mins) so I decided to reward myself with two slices.  TIP: Get your order a lot faster by ordering slice by slice. If you want to order a whole pie, have fun waiting an additional 30+ mins. :X  The slices were HUGE. I swear, one slice could cover my entire face. I ordered the white slice and the pepperoncini + sausage slice.  *White slice - 4.5/5 Mmmmmm... So flavorful it'll awaken your taste buds and keep your breath nice and garlicky for the next 12 hours. At first glance, the slice looked so plain and uninviting with its layer of grease so shiny you could see your reflection. But, it was love at first bite. I just have one suggestion: an acidic component to cut through the grease!  *Pepperoncini + sausage  OMG! There were little slivers of pepperoncini and sausage scattered over a tomato based sauce on top of the yummy carb-y goodness. This was BY FAR my favorite. The layers of flavor ranged from savory, tangy, spicy, and smoky - L. O. V. E.   With that said, I also want to mention that I am not a thin crust type of girl. But, this place won me over.",

    "text": "The not so secret, Secret Pizza, has been in my bookmarks for a long time. Since I'm pretty sure everyone knows exactly where this place is by now, I won't go to far into it's whereabouts. But, if you do happen to have a hard time finding it, here's a little tip. There's a strange little glass elevator on the 3rd floor...look just to the left of that and you'll see the dark, but wondrous, hallway to pizza heaven. You're welcome.  Inside you'll find an arcade game, a few counters to stand at while you eat, and the pizza counter itself. Yup, that's it. After you place your order, you make your way down the line and pay for it at the register. Now, I'm not sure if anyone's really paid much attention but there's well over a grand hanging up on the wall as a decoration near the register too. Maybe a slightly over the top take on the ole' first dollar made thing? I don't know, but it was fun to look at it.  The pizza selection itself is decent. They have single slices in several varieties, including their infamous white pizza, as well as full pies and somewhat of a build your own option. I also saw a few deep dish slices sitting out but they were huge, and at $8 a slice, I didn't think I'd be able to finish it all. So, I opted for just a single slice of the white.   With all the hype, I was actually surprised at how good this pizza was. And sure, it's $5 a slice, but they are so big it was easily justified in my eyes...and stomach. Plus the flavors are great and the crust is on point. I really dug the large clumps of ricotta with the hint of garlic, and it's not overly greasy either. Perfectly foldable, and delicious. No complaints and I'm dying to go back to try a slice with some meat added to it. One of the workers said sausage really adds to the white pie.  One thing I suggest is trying to hit this place up in an off time, if possible. We missed a big rush of people just before 6pm, but as we were leaving, the line was starting to hit the hallway. With standing counter space for only about a dozen people, you might end up juggling your greasy pizza plate and your beer filled red solo cup while tourist play running back to the counter. That wouldn't be good.  If you've yet to try Secret Pizza, what are you waiting for? Surely not a tip on how to find it. Just get down here already!",

Basically, get in that giant line you see going down a hallway.  [[ Slices ]]-- Pick your slice for $5 and I would suggest you get at least 2 so you won't have to wait in line again. If you want a whole Pie, you'll most likely wait another 45 mins for it to be done.      ++ White Pizza: mozzarella, ricotta, and garlic. WOW blew my mind! DELICIOUS and super cheeesssyy which is the way it should be.     ++ Sausage and Ricotta     ++ Pepperoni     ++ Mushroom  I think everything is pretty basic but it's perfect if you're looking for a NY-ish thin sliced pizza that's always piping hot and hits the spot!",

I think one thing for me is that this place reminds me of DC, when a night drinking in Adams Morgan always ends with a slice of Jumbo Slice Pizza.   $5 dollar per slice is way more expensive than your normal Costco slice but there ain't nothing better after a night of fun. Plus, we already sweated and danced all the calories off at the club anyway. Why not indulge?",

So, did my Man and I just happen to eat $200 clams worth of Sushi at Blue Ribbon? (also in Cosmo, see my other review!) Yes! And as we were stumbling along back to our Hotel around Midnight on a glorious Thursday-to-be we saw the wall paper from the Yelp pictures w all the frames of neat stuff lining a hallway framing a long line of hungry patrons looking for a slice to soak up the eventuality of tomorrow's hangover... Being that this felt like a certain privilege that we just accidentally happened upon some Pizza gold mine we waited in that line!  We opted for a White Slice and a Meaty Slice from the line up of 4 semi-freshly cooked Pizzas sitting on the line and the staff was friendly enough... Pizza was decent, albeit greasy but nothing to write home about other than I'm sure we woke up the next day in a better mood than we would of just trusting our night to Sushi!",

Benefits are that they are open late and their per slice is decently price.  If you are planning to order a whole pizza, call ahead. It is much cheaper for a whole pizza but takes about an hour. For another $10 you can \"cut the line\", and they'll push your order forward.   I had what everyone else recommend here. All good, definitely greasy.

I came here with a bunch of crazy fun Yelp Elites to fill our tummies (& mostly to sober) after our crazy night at the Cat House!    We ordered a white pizza and a 1/2mushroom&sausage and 1/2 pepperoni pizza. I gotta say, I prefer the white pizza better. For some reason, the white pizza had a lot more flavors than the sausage. Maybe the meat was too over powering for the thin crust. The ricotta on the white pizza was so smooth and \"FATTY\". When we held the pizza vertically, the fat was literally dripping!  The dough was too chewy for my taste. It was a little bite rubbery, which I don't think it's suppose to be like that for a True NY style pizza. The wait for the pizza was also way too long. We wait around 30 minutes for the pizza..... which is way too long to wait for any food.   Come try when you're in Vegas, but I'm sure you can find a pizza place like this in CA!  CA has EVERYTHING!",

I like this place for their food but can't see myself returning again unless it is with a group of friends, the price is just too high.

I had asked someone that worked at the casino where a good late breakfast early lunch option was, quick. He told me where to find this treasure because you really do need a map to find it. It is down a tempting long hallway where the smell of NY style pizza lures you into its grip. It has about 10-12 stools with a Galaga game and an old-school pizza oven. Pizza is available by the slice and it is really good. Being from Boston, I like thin, thin crust that bends when you pick it up. This pizza did not disappoint.",

Next time we come here, definitely getting the whole pie cause its 5 dollars a slice and between me and my sister getting two slices each, it was already close to the price of a whole pie.

When I was there they had plain, pepperoni, white, veggie, and sausage and peppers.  They also have PBR on tap and some IPA, and a few cans of other beers.  Red and white wines in boxes, and soda, of course.  Pizza wasn't overly warm and nothing amazing, but decent.

It took about 20 mins to get our pie and it was just perfect for our group of 7. The only downside is the limited seating area inside so we had to eat at one of the tables by the pool table.",

Then the guy looked at her and said I can take two slices and scrape cheese off them and put veggies on them with extra sauce.   Wow, this was like stopping the General Motors main assembly line! That's how busy it was. It was March Madness and St Patties day!!    My daughters slices were off the charts good. Crispy crunchy crust with perfectly cooked veggies. Our mushroom slices and white slices were really good too. The regular cheese slice was ok I think mostly because the other slices were so awesome. The regular slice didn't stand a chance.   So special thanks to the Secret Pizza crew!!  By the way if you haven't been here ask where it is cause most likely you won't find it. We found it by following the trail of people leaving with pizza boxes. Otherwise we wouldn't have found it either.   No signs for it what so ever. Not even over the door. Lol.",

    "text": "I remember coming to Secret Pizza like a year ago, so I decided to come here again to see if it was still as good as I remembered it to be. It's located in the  Cosmopolitan on the 3rd floor across the billiard tables and chandelier.   There's an element of mystery when trying to find this place because the hallway leading up to the actual pizzeria has no signage or pizza advertisements. You can easily find it, though, when you see people walking out of the hallway carrying their food out... I felt like Alice going to Wonderland except there's pizza on the other side, and not talking flowers and such. It's kinda cool knowing that this place is literally a hole in the wall, especially since the NY style slices offered here are really good.  The interior is pretty small and it can get packed so fast. There's very limited seating (I only saw like two or three chairs) and then the rest is standing area. There's a few arcade games in there as well.   Overall, the pizza was slightly doughy and had a bit of crunch to the bottom of the slice. I had two slices of pizza: a white pizza slice and a mushroom one.  The white pizza with ricotta was so good. I think the ricotta elevated the flavor of the slice because when I bit into it, my mouth was hit with the rich, cheesy goodness. The mushroom pizza didn't really have that strong of a mushroom taste, probably because the mushrooms were more like small bits scattered all over the pizza slice. It had a very subtle mushroom flavor going on. I ended up spending $11 on the two slices of pizza.   I think the pizza is a little pricey (what isn't on the strip?), but so worth it. In my opinion, I'd say I believe in the hype this place has got. It can get crowded and you may bump elbows with other people if you dine-in, but this place definitely did not disappoint!",

Just head to the third floor and the path will be obvious. I'm not even sure who named the place Secret Pizza. The receipt just says Pizzeria. Now that's hip.   I got a slice of the White Pizza for 550 pennies and was very happy.  Piping hot, thin-sliced, crispy, and real cheesy with ricotta and mozzarella. I tasted a little bit of garlic too.  Very good and highly recommend!  Note you can always add more toppings for extra $$$.",

Well, go to Secret Pizza and you'll start to consider cancelling that flight back to wherever you choose to \"dwell\" (not live, because you haven't lived, until you have this pizza).  Now, I tried to resist. I really did. My friends got the pizza one afternoon and I was like, \"None for me.\" FOOL. I know. FOOL. However, finally, after the Drake concert (and alcohol), I caved. I caved and got the best slice imaginable. I pointed and said, \"That one.\" \"That one\" consisted of cheese, ricotta cheese, and meatballs... Um, hi. I also ordered a water, because health. The crust was perfectly light and crispy and the pizza was just TOO GOOD (I probably said that about 10 times between each bite).  The secret is out as to location in the Cosmopolitan hotel, or you KNOW I would not be sharing that location. All the more for me.  Secret Pizza, can you Post-Mate to SF? Greatly appreciated.",

The pizza is fantastic but it is always extremely crowded. The prices fluctuate. The best deal is to order a pie but with wait times of 90 minutes or more, we passed. There are a variety of single slices with different toppings. Due to the crowd they are constantly making pizza so it is extremely fresh. The hours are phenomenal, but are dangerous for a pizza addict like myself. Proceed with caution:)",

Also, don't be fooled by the selection they have on the counter, because they have a lot more under the table!   Crispy, hot, and delicious mmmm. While it's a bit steep at $5, I'd still come back here!  We went around 2 or 3 on a Saturday and there was no wait. WOO! but I hear the line can get pretty long",

I recommend it for all tourists, especially students, because it's definitely affordable and really delicious. Approximately $6.00 total for a slice may sound expensive, but would you rather be spending +$20 somewhere else for a meal in Vegas? I think not.! It's really really close to the Marquee Dayclub/Nightclub so if you were planning to go clubbing afterwards, I'd recommend getting a pizza slice so that you aren't too hungry or full.  The cashier recommended me the fetuccini and meatball slice, and it was really savory. Every bite was fresh and packed with flavor, and I definitely devoured it faster than the time it took for my friends to Instagram the slice.",

I arrived around 3 pm after spotting someone coming out of the \"hole\" with a pizza box. The short hallway is lined with record covers. The menu had 3 choices but there were more options on the counter. The staff was friendly and did not rush me. I chose the pepperoni mushroom which was reheated for me and I stood at a counter height table to eat it. The pizza was good, not great but it hit the spot since I was starving! It had thin crust and minimal sauce. When I folded it to eat it, grease dripped out, but hey-who's complaining?!? It's pizza!!

You looked magnificent with your large, generous slices-- although I didn't know you had an equally large price to match-- $5 a slice, I still thought to myself that there is a high price for high quality, so I forked up my dollars.   When you arrived and finally met my tastebuds, our love affair quickly came down in shambles... So so greasy, I mean greasier than the forehead of a young teen who is slaving away over a McDonald's grill.   Maybe one has to be extremely intoxicated to begin their love affair with you (as do most Vegas \"love affairs\")-- and I was greatly saddened to know our love would not last.

I solely came here because of the hypes and I left very disappointed. The pizza is a step above frozen pizza - but honestly lack flavors when compare to DiGiorno. I came here during the less busy hours and ordered a slice of Sicilian and pepperoni. The food came ready in about 5 minutes so the waiting time wasn't so bad. I really didn't care for either of these pizza - they were bland, crust was okay nothing to write home about and the sauce was ehhhh...canned tomatoes. I guess if you're from LA you'll think their pizza is the best thing since sliced bread but for New Yorkers and Chicagoans - save your money elsewhere, unless you're drunk and needed some greasy food to sober up.",

It's in such a hidden spot you wouldn't know it was there unless you looked it up or saw people walking out of a hallway with a pizza box! So its in the Cosmopolitan hotel just take the elevators to the 3rd floor and I believe it was on the right hand side, you'll see a long small hallway almost alley like with pictures along the wall just go through there and discover some yummy pizza! So you can create your own the prices varies by how many topping and it will take some time to make of course. Otherwise they make their pizza choices (there's no name, you just point and they give it to you) sounds sketchy but it was so good I went back twice! They are thin pizzas and normally I'm a fan of Chicago style pizza but this might be my new favorite!",

The giant slice at Secret Pizza is perfect for nursing those nasty hangovers, or curing your drunchies! I have fond memories of the white pizza. When I first had it, I was on the third day of a three-day hangover, and food was pretty disgusting to me. Despite this, the white slice was STILL good to me. Imagine how amazing it would have been if I were normal???? The price is kind of high, at $6ish, but honestly, it's the Vegas strip. Tap water at Starbucks is like $1.   I would suggest coming on an off-time (aka daytime) to avoid the post-clubbing line, or just endure it to satisfy those drunchies. I was able to grab a slice in less than 5 minutes, so all was well.   I'LL BE BACK FOR YOU EVENTUALLY, SECRET PIZZA. It wasn't meant to be last time...",

As you can see from the 4000+ reviews, Secret Pizza is located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan. You can find it by looking for the hallway with records or the long line of people standing in front of nothing.   I had the pepperoni slice with olives. Simple, greasy, delicious. It's been a minute since I've been on the East Coast, and that NY style just transported me back to the land of cold winters, late nights and delicious pizza.   There's not much space inside to sit (obviously) so I would have a couple of friends wait in line/grab the pizzas while the rest grab seats in the lounge area right in front of the entrance. Then taunt ignorant passers-by with the tantalizing smell of pizza that you got from nowhere.",

A few of my co-workers and I took an excursion a few nights ago to seek out this cool, hidden spot for pizza by the slice.  We had heard all the rumors, and it was a fun adventure seeking out the \"hidden\" hallway and emerging into the tiny shop plucked straight off a street in NYC.  Many already made pies were waiting for us to choose from, but the staff seemed happy to accommodate other \"custom\" requests as well.  I chose a simple pepperoni slice (my go-to standard) along with a mixed veggie slice.  The crust was dead-on perfect...crispy on the bottom and chewy within, all on the thinner side.  The sauce was mild in flavor, not too tangy or sweet and the cheese was a really nice shredded mozzarella.  Would I return here?  Hells yeah!  Hope I get that chance one day...",

Although in Vegas, there's no time to get lost! The Cosmo is a fun and upbeat hotel and casino so it's one of the few places to enjoy getting lost in. The place was crowded for the size, but wasn't bad. Prices were indeed high for slices. The pictures on the wall that lead you to the pizza place was a nice touch. There was an old school pinball machine, which was broken. For the nostalgia, great, but I actually did want to play. Pizza was actually very good to be honest. The crust was crispy but not burnt. The flavors were very original. Little on the greasy side but still something that hits the spot for the day time strip drinking that most folks do.",

It as if to a college pizza shack, you pick your pizza and get served your drink in a read party cup. There are not many seats they have a TV kind of to make it more of a small hidden hang out spot.  I tried the meatball with banana peppers; it was to die for it had the savory along with the tangy lemony taste giving it a great balance. The pepperoni had an authentic taste as if the peperoni was sliced a little thicker and cured a little longer. This is a must for an in-between meal or even ideal for after the bar spot.

I'm not a pizza connoisseur by any means, but I think it was great and for those who need a late night snack this is the perfect place to go!  PS. Try the cheesecake....a fairly large slice and really really awesome!",

    "text": "Pizza- 5 stars. Yesterday's attitude and up charge- 1 star.  This review is only based on yesterday's service/experience.   I have been to Secret Pizza numerous times, basically it's a must every time I go to Vegas. It's a combination of going after the club, mid-day snack, and even going the morning before heading back to LA. Yeah, it's great pizza, we all know that. However, last night around 11pm, I was so upset with Secret Pizza, I couldn't enjoy pizza because of the attitude and up charge! I went there ahead of my boyfriend as he told me to go first while he cashed out downstairs at the casino. Since it was only 11pm in Vegas, there was no line. Yes! The beauty of not getting Secret Pizza post-club. By the time I was about to order, 5-7 people started forming a line before me. My boyfriend got to me as soon as I was about to order and told me he wanted any sausage slice. The guy behind the counter rudely in a harsh voice told my boyfriend, \"You, go to the back of the line\". I mean, come on, I was going to order for my boyfriend either way. He's not cutting. He came to me to let me know what he wanted. We were not in any way behaving improperly or drunk or even doing anything wrong to be spoken to in that manner. Then when I went to pay for my two slices of pizza, the woman at the cashier said \"what did you order?\", I stated \"one sausage with toppings...\", she entered $6 on the register- understandable. I gave her my credit card and I then told her, \"second slice is just sausage\"...and again, she entered $6 on the register- not understandable. I asked why the $6 charge on the plain sausage and she didn't bother to explain and  charged my card and gave it back to me and moved on to the next customer. I didn't even get the chance to get an answer or reasoning behind her over charge. Thanks.  Overall, great pizza but when service isn't good, great pizza leaves a bad taste.",

Located on 3rd floor and you'll see a large black door with a hallway  when you get off the escalator. Opens at 11:00 am. if you go before, you'll miss it for sure since they close the large door. It's definitely a good pizza but definitely not the best. Probably best you can get around the area but you can get so much better even in LA. $5.00 a piece but ridiculous $3.25 for a drink. Go to 2nd floor store right below and get a soda. we tried mushroom pizza and white pizza.",

Three if you think the pizza is horrible, four if think it's decent (hence my four stars), and five if you think it's great!   This place is just such a novelty at the Cosmopolitan. Like others have mentioned, it's hidden away amongst all the other restaurants on the third floor, with no signage, and I think no actual to name to it. You probably wouldn't even eat here unless you're drunk (which was the case w/my two trips here on a debaucheries LV weekend) or broke (this is definitely the cheapest food you'll find in this hotel).   Like I said, i thought the pizza was decent. Of course I was drunk on night 1 when I devoured a slice of cheese & on night 2 when I had some sort of Greek style pizza (it had gyro meat & feta). They seem to churn out pizzas pretty quickly & there are several varieties to choose from at any given time.   They also have two beers on tap (one is Pabst and I forget the other one, but it's something cheap) as well as fountain soda, which sounds FANTASTIC at the end of the night. Both are served in those AWESOME red SOLO cups synonymous with kegs.",

What I love about the place is that you're literally walking inside the fancy hotel minding your own business and then you encounter this strange hallway with records on their walls...then you keep walking a little further in....and then BOOM! Out of nowhere, You're in a pizza place back in NYC. We found this place thanks to Yelp. The prices are a little steep, but I have to say that it was a great pizza. The seating is limited so it's mostly eating in a counter kinda thing. I don't know if there's a better NYC style pizza place around Vegas but you can't go wrong with this spot. Try it....if you can find it",

Located down a long unmarked corridor.  No map in the hotel reveals its location.   Also opened later than anything else in a area to get good food when you are drinking and hungry  When you walk in the first thing you'll notice is the long line of people..   (The secret is out) Mostly eat-in slices sold (about 5.50 a slice/30 bucks a pie), less than a dozen seats and counter space and twice as many people than seats..  We ordered 2 pies (4 types) and we asked them to pick their most popular mixes...  So the first was the white pie..  Simple, thin crust Mozzarella and ricotta but the whole pie was soaked is an olive oil/ butter garlic mix that was off the hook! My favorite..   The second was normal red Pie pepperoni and sausage.. The pepperoni was great but overly greasy and the sausage was weird looking but tasted good.  Next was a plain Cheese, sauce and mozzarella.  It was good but nothing to write home about except for the fact that this was good east coast pizza in Vegas! The last was a veggie mix of black olives, peppers and onions.. Overall really solid pizza..    Shhhh- 3rd floor off the escalators.  Look for the long hallway..",

The best pizzas we have had were the meatlovers, the large pepperoni and mushroom, and the CORNER slices of the white sicilain with sausage , peppers and onions. Absolutely heaven no matter what time of day you go. only complaint is that a soda is 4$. its a fountain soda. we got smart and like a nj pizzaria, we bring a 2 liter and sit on the couches outside. so good so damn good! id put it up against L&B spumoni gardens in Brooklyn and Benny Tudinos in Hoboken. has pinball and leaves the par cheese out for you to use.",

I can't even narrow it down to 1 or 2 things that made it great, it was a fantastic balance of flavor and consistency. This cheese they use is delicious and the sauce is has the perfect flavor. If you travel to Vegas and don't go here, slap yourself really hard...no seriously, I'll wait.  Let's simplify this for everyone. Figure out how to get to secret pizza cause if you don't you're letting your life just dwindle away with less and less meaning. GO!",

For those of you who haven't had a Brooklyn-style slice, the crust is much thinner and you're supposed to eat the pizza folded hot-dog style, preferably while walking around and grimacing at people. ;)   Each bite was delicious. I only got to try the white pizza and the mix of olive oil, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese was delightful. Nothing that really blew my socks off, but definitely a decent slice for when I'm craving nyc-style pizza!",

It's in a small alley on the third floor in cosmopolitan. Decorations look like a corner pizza shop in NYC. Don't underestimate this hidden gem. Line was long at midnight.  New York style pizza is perfect comfort food late night before or after drinks in this sin City. It is also very reasonable in price. If you want to try something different, their white sauce pizza is amazing. I devoured it in just few minutes. Why I only gave 4 stars, well the pizza is a bit oily and there are very limited seating area.  If you are in Las Vegas, give it a try.",

It's a secret!   We were lucky when we got there since the line was not too long. I ordered the whole pie with pepperoni and sausage. They told me it would take 10 mins but in reality, it took more like 30/40 mins.  As we waited, the line just kept getting longer and longer; glad we got there before the dinner rush! There wasn't much seating available; a handfull of stools near some countertop tables. Eventually, our pizza was finally ready; they even gave us paper plates and cheese/pepper packets without us asking.   Overall, this place had pretty good pizza. The slices were cut pretty big and it was greasy and yummy. The thin crust was perfect with a good mix of crunch and chew.",

I'm not going to go into too much detail, but just know a few things:   - Open until 4am!  - This place can get packed around midnight.  - minimal to zero seating. Get it to go and eat in your room.  - Play some Galaga while you wait.  - $3 - $4 a slice. Amazing deal for the strip.  - They have beers on tap! PBR and a few decent craft beers.  - Located on the 3rd floor. Look for a dark hallway.  - Eat everything!  You officially been informed!",

I mean where in Vegas can you find a delicious good quality slice of pizza for $5? It's a little hole in the wall on the 3rd floor wedged in between all the fine dinning restaurants. It's super cute and unique.   Pizzas are fresh and are ready by the slices so no waiting involve unless you're ordering a whole pie. There are a couple of topping choices, but their famous pizza is the white cheese pizza. We decided to try the pepp with everything and the cheese with sausage. It's thin, light, and flaky! You'll be full with one slice, but if you're extra hangry get two. Crust is perfect! It had just the right chew and crunch. I would definitely come again for a slice whenever visiting Cosmopolitan.",

Their sauce, cheese, and toppings are all spot on but I do think their crust is lacking a salty component that makes you lick your lips and go for more which is why I took off a star. The sauce is a good combination of robust and sweet and the cheese is ooey gooey :)) Not the perfect slice but definitely a good one! We have gone earlier in the night around midnight and it was empty and later in the night as well around 3ish and the line was out the door so if you're not trying to wait then go earlier! If you're ordering a whole pie it takes at least 20-30min.",

This place is delicious, I highly reccomend giving the white pizza a try, it's amazing!  You wouldn't know where to find this place if you were just walking by. There are no signs, and it's hard to find if you don't know where to go. The name makes sense though, it's a secret! The staff was very friendly, and even though the place was packed they were all happy and helpful.  I will definitely be coming back on my next trip to Vegas! I may even come back to Vegas just to get more of the white pizza!",

Step 1.  Find the 3rd floor 'Food Court' at the Cosmopolitan Step 2.  Locate the small dark hallway next to the Blue Ribbon Step 3.  Follow the album covers to a small room filled with pinball machines and delicious pizza slices  SP offers one of the cheapest meal options on the strip at $5.25 per slice of cheese pizza, with each additional topping being 50 cents. Toppings include: pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, tomato, onions, jalapeno, garlic, bell peppers, ricotta, and black olives. I was excited to see that they also have sides of ranch for $1.50 - creamy, delicious, shareable, and well worth the extra price.   This pizza-speakeasy is legendary among the drinking crowd, and will typically have a 40 minute wait around 2AM. Come prepared for a line!  There is limited seating available in the actual storefront, but you can find a variety of shared spaces scattered across the 3rd floor.",

Even in the small space and long line, we got in, ordered, and got our pizzas within 30 min. We took our orders to go (sparse seating) and got back to the car and avoided paying for parking-huzzah!  I was impressed since the line was 20+ people deep in front of us. I got a white pizza and my boyfriend got two cheeses. I loved my choice. It was the right amount of gooey amd crunchy, tart and savory, and proportioned well for the price. My boyfriend lamented that his was salty. It was OK, he said. I'm glad I chose white because I can't stand salty things. But I had a taste and though salty, it wasn't bad.  This place is a nice spot to bring people from out of town that don't like to broaden their palates much (we all know those folks).... or to find after drinking at the club.   Check it out!",

The meatball ricotta is meaty, vegetarian pizza reminds me of Costco pizza (in a good way), the crust is thin and crunchy. It was all good. Nonetheless, hearing all the praises from yelp and friends and having this illusion about how amazing the pizza here is, I have finally gotten to experience it myself and it fell short of my expectations. Please do not believe the hype. Enjoy your pizza just for what it is and it will probably taste infinitely better.

    "text": "After hearing about this place from friends I just had to check it out. My husband found the place during his visit for his bachelor party and this time the door was open so the secret was not so secret when we visited. I wanted to see what it would like with the door closed but it's alright, maybe next time.  The selection is small but don't let that deter you. The pizza is tasty, slices are  big and reasonably priced for Vegas. You get to choose if you want an inside or outside (crust) slice. I had the sicilian pepperoni while my husband had the one with 2 kinds of sausage, goat cheese and peppers. The pepperoni was classic. It was cheesy and had large slices of pepperoni. Be careful when adding stuff to your pizza, I accidentally poured a little too much garlic powder on my slice but it still tasted really good and luckily wasn't overpowering or salty.  I didn't get the same slice as my husband because it had goat cheese but I tried it and actually liked his a little more than mine. The sausage was good and I liked the peppers. Next time I'm going for that kind.  Slices are about $5 for regular slices and $8 for sicilian. Service is quick but be aware the line can get long 12-2am. Good luck finding the place if the \"door\" is closed.",

This place is perfect for those who are staying at the cosmopolitan and perfect for those weakling laggers who cant handle their booze anymore. Why? Because its secretly and conveniently located at the upper floors of the Cosmopolitan by STK and Scarpetta. I recommend the Scillian Slize. This thick crusted bad boy is packed full of flavor and gives it that rustic taste from the oven. In my book, whatever looks more ooey and gooey with cheese is always a winner for me!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  UNTIL THEN!! ^-^",

We threw out the other 80% of the pizza. Literally inedible. Cant believe we blew 35 bucks on this massive salt lick. My tongue still burns from the salt.

I live in Akron, OH, home of Luigi's Famous Pizza, (well, famous to us) and it's hard to compare anything to that in my opinion, but if anywhere was going to pass up my Luigi's, it would be this place. I found this place from a secret blog I found a couple months before our trip to Vegas, and we were bound and determined to find it. It's a long hallway with a couple guys at the end in this little room behind what looks similar to a deli counter, flipping pizzas back and forth the whole time. The \"white\" pizza is by far, THE BEST. Made from an assortment of cheese, ricotta, fresh herbs and well, I'm not really sure of what else, but it doesn't matter because it's AMAZING. It's the definition of a laid-back, pick-up-your-pizza-and-go, type of place. But it has a casual, authentic old-style-italian atmosphere. It looked like a couple of grandson's working for their old-school italian grandpa behind the counter and you can tell by the atmosphere in there, that they love it.  HIGHLY recommend finding this place, and keeping it on the down-low, so that it can remain a low-key (secret), special place, for the people that know about it!",

They see us eating pizza at a table in front of one of the other restaurants on this level and come up to us asking where we got this pizza. I point over to the general direction of the hallway that leads to the pizzeria, and she just gives me this look and says, \"Are you sure you didn't get it from here?\" pointing to the restaurant behind me, which is CLEARLY closed with the bars down and the servers counting down the registers.

And, the door was wide open and there were a bunch of people standing in line. We got there around 2AM and we waited 20 minutes to simply order a pizza. We ordered a whole pizza with 3 toppings (sausage, onions, mushrooms) and they told us we had to wait another 25 minutes. We were so hungry, so we bought a slice of white pizza ($5, ricotta cheese, no tomato sauce) to hold us over. It was unremarkable and the crust was dried out too.  We waited and waited, and finally we got our pie box. It was piping hot. Everything looked amazing. We dove in. And it was unorgasmic. There was nothing unique about the pizza and again the crust was dry and not chewy. I threw on hot peppers, garlic, and herbs to make it more tasty but to no avail.   I'd rate the pizza 3 stars. The price is 2 stars ($26 for a three-topping pie). In conclusion, it is not worth the 45 minute wait. If there is no wait and you're terribly hungry, I'd say go for it.",

It was our last night in Vegas.. and after reading Anthony N., Michelle T., and Jessica Y.'s reviews about this pizza joint... We HAD to fit this place in @ 1am... lol  It took us a while to find this place.. since they're sorta hidden.. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=JXoETn8OGGd-u1jrTldyTQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQp...</a> w/ no sign or name on the directory (I didn't see any..). And I didn't feel like reading all the Yelp reviews to get a clue on how to find this place!!! They're on LEVEL 3 right by the escalators and a pool table area...... :} We saw a group of people in the lobby-like area chomping down big slices of pizza.. and THAT's when we knew we found it.. lol  1 slice of cheese pizza $4.50 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=Aq-DmSdY-vcyovcZ6e06uA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQp...</a> + 50cents/topping <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=LWZIYCJb65OmuhypdFEDzw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQp...</a> $6.00  We got one slice each to take back to our hotel.. And as soon as we bit into it..  We regretted getting only one slice!! It got cold.. but it was STILL VERY GOOD. BF: if pizza is good even when it's cold.. it's friggin good! :}  We'll probably be here every time we're in Vegas.  p.s. My BF loves it when I find great places like this on Yelp.. teehehe  MmMmm... *burp*",

We waited about 40-45 minutes with maybe 4-5 whole pizza orders ahead of us.  Really good thin crust pizza and they use a pizza box that breaks down into plates and folds into a smaller box for leftovers.. they also give you paper plates too, but having just seen the box on Shark Tank, seeing the box in person made be a little excited.   Nice to have another option besides Earls for more affordable food on the strip.",

That will buy you two Powerades at Encore Beach Club.   It is also incredibly yummy. Since I flew into Vegas post pool party, I ate this sober and enjoyed it, but my friends ate it after some drinks and loved it, so no matter what state of mind you're in, you will like this pizza. They have a lot of specialty toppings, like sun dried tomatoes, artichokes, and more. I opted for plain cheese since that's my favorite.   I guess it's sort of hard to find if you don't know what you're doing. The entrance is a long corridor, kind of like when you go to the bathroom in the mall and have to walk past a several unmarked doors that go into who knows where. I think the original intention is to serve the post club crowd, but honestly, this is some of the better food in Vegas, so I'd eat it as a meal- downside is there isn't too much seating. They want you in and out.",

Big slices of pizza for $5-$6 a slice. Fast service. Small cramped place but there is seating outside of the hallway for you to sit. Free refills. Simple menu, they did not let us create our own pizza so you just have to choose from what they have at that time. A bit too greasy for my taste, floppy ends of the pizza, but the crust was yummy! (which I find to be a rarity). Even though the slices are big, I suggest getting 2 slices because they are so good you WILL want more especially if you have a big appetite.",

If you go any time after 2 or so there will be a huge line of wasted people stumbling over from the Marquee. Girls in short skirts who can barely walk any more in their heels, who very well could vomit on you while in line at any time.  Once you get it, it feels like a pizza stand somewhere in New York. They have several selections of slices ready to go or you can wait for a while pie.  The pizza is very good. (even better at 3am). Every time I am in Vegas I go here now. Its delicious!",

Granted, it is a great place eat at 2 am when you're wasted and hanging out at the Cosmo. I felt like the price paid ($5/slice) for the portion size given was unacceptable.  I know it's Vegas, but you can get a slice twice the size for $3-4 in New York City a.k.a. The mecca of pizza. They also didn't have much variety this time.  I had a sliced sausage and pepperoni pizza which skimped on the sauce and the crust was too chewy.      We waited about 30 minutes in the line which we didn't mind so much, but it's kind of a letdown when you're overcharged and don't feel completely satisfied at the end. It's still decent drunk food, but I would never consider going there in any other circumstance.   Being from Texas, I didn't really understand the whole \"No Ranch\" thing.  It's just ranch dressing.  Its not that expensive, you could probably charge a small amount for it and still profit and make tons more customers happy (This is for all of us in TX and the Midwest who require ranch dressing).  Next time you're in Vegas and it's late and you're drunk and hungry, consider Secret Pizza for a fix, but realize there are other options that are just as, if not more appealing (Hash House a go go, Earl of Sandwich, etc).",

I went with 3 friends and we managed to make it more cost effective by buying one whole pizza and a 2-liter vs. separate slices and separate drinks for all 4 of us.  I think that cut $20 off our potential bill haha.  One positive - we went around... 11:30 a.m. (?) so we beat the lunch rush and didn't have to wait in a line.  Once we got our pizza, there was a line of at least 20 people long.    I'd rather eat at Wicked Spoon at the Cosmo and get my pizza from NYNY down the strip!",

And although its called secret pizza place it's not really a secret you can ask for directions if you need them. I've had the cheese pizza here and it is really good classic foldable cheesy greasy pizza. However I recently tried the white pizza on the recommendation of a friend and I have to say wow. I had the white pizza with tomatoes and loved it. Big slices still the same grease level and just plain delicious. I will be going with the white pizza from now on. The only thing about this place is its more expensive then your average pizza place but that comes with the territory since it is on the strip. Definitely still recommend it.  The service: the service at this place is really good the staff friendly they can get busy which can sometimes slow things down just depends on the day. You can get slices or a whole pizza. Not a lot of room to sit but you can always walk and eat. Or grab a slice or pie for the room.",

    "text": "If Secret Pizza were located in any other city, it would probably only get 3 stars. However, in comparison to most of what I've tasted around Vegas, this pizza is pretty damn good. And after all these reviews, it's clear that many visitors agree.   I have to agree with others that the idea of the \"secret\" pizza is pretty cute. My husband and I were quite excited at the challenge of finding this sneaky spot. It's True that there's no sign to be found and it's down a random hallway in a random spot of the Cosmopolitan. However, it's clearly not much of a secret anymore and with the hints other Yelpers gave before me, my husband and I found its \"secret\" location in about two seconds. That was a little bit of a let down. Maybe to keep things spicy, Secret Pizza should move its location around. I realize this may not be the most practical idea, but it certainly would keep customers on their toes! ;)  I'll keep this simple since the gazillions of reviews have already said what needs to be said. The pizza is good. It's not gourmet and it's not incredible, but it's good. I'm sure it's especially good if you're drunk and ready to feed the craving. Unfortunately, like every other Vegas place, the prices here are a bit steep. $24 for four slices of pizza! Oh well, I've come to assumption that good food is hard to find on the strip and this is a quick stop for some tasty pies. I'm sure I'll be back the next time I'm in town.  Thanks to all the Yelpers for their helpful hints!",

There's no sign, so you'll either have to follow your nose or look for the hallway line with framed records and pictures of musicians. Once you find it, head on in.  We had the white slice with pepperoni and the meatball ricotta slice. Both were SO GOOD.  I love the crispness of pizza by the slice and secret pizza really crisps it up.  The white slice was good, but the money was really on the meatball ricotta.  The missus really summed it up... its like eating a slice of lasagna.  It's the perfect end to a late night and is pretty much the same price as pizza by the slice at home. Give it a try!",

The pepperoni and meatball toppings are both winners.  The staff has that New York sass to them, but always provide solid service.

    "text": "Deliiicous new york style, thin crust pizza! Recommended by friends. It's inside of the Cosmopolitan hotel, on the second story, through an unmarked hallway. If you ask a worker they'll point you to it. Nearby is a place that sells gelato... :) we did not go wrong with that combo!  Order a box for approx $24, or a slice for approx $6. A box has 10 slices. They have red or white base. I think it comes with 2 or so toppings. Ea. addt'l topping is $2.50.   They can split your whole pizza into 2 flavors. We did that.   Loved the white pizza with super soft, melt in your mouth ricotta, and garlic which is a store creation. The taste was sooo good, I said I think this might be the best pizza i've ever eaten! Next time i'll try to ask for more fresh garlic on top to make it even more like new york pizza.  For the red pizza, we had sun-dried tomatoes, thin slices of thick round sausage, mushroom, and pepperoncini. pretty good, but the flavor of the white had more depth to me..but i'm a white pizza kinda person.  the slices are huge..i should've been done at 2, but i stuffed a 3rd down. The first pizza's hot grease was super delish. The 3rd's was gettin' heavy & guilty feeling. My hubs ate 4 pieces, and said he could still have another. But I wonder if he was just saying that to prove that we did right in ordering the whole pizza instead of individual slices (which I was tempted to do in order to try different flavors). :D Either way, in the end he was right, because you do the math. $24 vs. $60 for all the pizza we got.  We only took home 3 leftover slices...i'm glad we got a whole pizza!  Oh, and the service is super friendly and patient. We stood there FOREVER trying to decide on what to order! You get to see them toss your dough and stretch it out in the air.   The only thing negative was not enough seating. There were only around 2 parties of a few people each, and we had to take our pizza out to eat somewhere else around the hotel which was a little awkward as everyone stared at us and our pizza.",

I suppose being sober in the cosmopolitan at that time next to the exit of one of the strips most popular clubs doesnt help. But we ordered a whole pie...their white pizza which consisted of olive oil, onions, mozzarella, ricotta, and gahhhhlic. Then we kicked it up with muchrooms and sliced meatball. OMG A. Maze. Ing. It was so good. the new york thin crust and the mounds of ricotta...just a taste explosion in your mouf.   Only thing was it cost quite a bit...30 bucks to be more specific. But it was worth it...it was vegas...and what ever..splurge.   Next day went back and got a slice of classic peperoni. Still...super great and was really good.   Soda and beer are served in red cups (same ones u buy at local costco or wherever) and its free refills (soda). i dont know what would happen if you brought your own from pre gaming in your hotel...  Went to the restaurant next door and played some fooseball...that was a blast. the pool table had broken cues...but what do you expect.

Thanks to previous reviews, it was pretty easy to find. Up to the third floor of the Cosmopolitan, then down the hallway that seems to go on forever. It's a tiny place, not much room to sit down and eat, but the food was fast and delicious. There was also a pool table right before you start the journey down the hallway, so it seems to be a fun place to go late at night when you're looking for a greasy slice.  I had a piece of pepperoni and a piece of \"the white.\" To be honest I'm not entirely sure what the white consisted of but it was yummy. A slice is pretty large so I wasn't completely sold on getting two but I'm glad I did. The crust is super thin and delicious - the pepperoni got a little soggy in the first bites, but I folded it over and voila! Problem solved. We got four slices of piece, a bottle of water, and a beer for $34. Kind of steep price, but no regrets and well worth the try.",

Typical beers on tap; Coors, Budlight, Shocktop.   Give it a try if you just want something quick to munch on and go.",

    "text": "While not the most \"secret\" of places, Secret Pizza is an unmarked hallway on the 3rd floor of Cosmo... you're transported into a random strip mall pizza joint from the 1990s. Inside, it's just an arcade game, a pinball game, and 6 stools.  I'm not sure about \"best in the US,\" but the pizza is very good. It's served in big, floppy slices with a buttery crust, spicy sausage and pepperoni, and fresh veggies. Vegas priced at $6 a slice, but still worth it. They also have thick Sicilian style slices we didn't get to try... it's very good pizza at 6pm, but I'd imagine it tastes 10x better at 2am.",

I was in Vegas with my family during Presidents' Day weekend and wanted to try something new that wasn't fast food or the buffet so i decided to grab something quick and easy which was secret pizza . Not only that I wanted to see what the hype was all about . What I liked about this place is it's inside Cosmo which is such a beautiful hotel & being at vdara for that weekend it was so easy cause I was able to just walk over Cosmo from vdara which is like no more than 5 mins vs taking the taxi or uber i saved a couple bucks from that. I was dreading the wait because I've heard from friends the line here can be pretty long and crazy but good thing I went around 8-9 pm because that's when everyone is getting ready for the club or going to the club haha now I know that's probably the perfect time to go cause I didn't have to wait no longer than 10 minutes in line and the service was quick I was in and out before I knew it. The pizza slices here are ginormous ! I was having a hard time finishing one slice by myself lol. It's actually a good price for a slice too no more than $5. Good place for something easy while enjoying a beer to go along with it and pretty unique how it's kinda hidden.",

    "text": "Secret Pizza, you sneaky little devil. This pizza joint, if I recall, is located on the 3rd floor of The Cosmopolitan. Once you step off the escalator, look for a nondescript hallway, no signs, no nothing but  quite possibly a looong line of people. Congratulations, you've unlocked their \"secret\" venue, now prepare yourself for a good 30 minute wait. I won't lie. It's pretty much torture, especially if you've found yourself here after club hours like myself. You can try your best to entertain yourself with the semi-neato-skeeto album covers but who are we kidding, anytime you get a whiff of that delicious pizza or someone exits the venue and walks past you in that narrow hallway, you're reminded how you're STILL in line and STILL not stuffing your piehole with, well, pie.  After you've managed to snake yourself to the end of the hallway, you can start eyeballing which pie is destined to be yours, individual slices or a whole pie? I opted for the latter and had to wait longer but it was worth it. I got half mushroom & pepperoni and the other half was ricotta and garlic. I enjoyed both types immensely but favored the white pizza and would gladly bathe in slices of this pizza - so good! Uber good!!  Pizza had a nice chewiness and the cheese was cheesy goodness. Definitely hit the spot! I ordered a large pizza and ducked out to one of the open tables just to the left upon exiting the hallway and inhaled my little slice of heaven.  Oh, by the way. You might see some unusual happenings while in line. For instance, one girl got to the cashier, turned around, lifted her dress and shook what her mama gave her. My friend and I turned to look at each other and mentally said, \"Did you just see that?\" while one other patron yelled out \"Does that get you free toppings?\" Hahah, we all laughed.  Anyway, duty called (boyfriend back in hotel room patiently waiting) so I paraded out of The Cosmopolitan and made my way over to MGM. Unfortunately BF was passed out, sad story for him, but happy ending for me: I plopped down in our living room and helped myself to another slice :)  So my verdict?  Worth the wait? Unfortunately yes. Will I come back? Oh you betcha' Will I save pizza for the next morning? No, it's definitely better hot... unless you have access to a microwave!",

The square one was amazingly delicious with it's cheese and meat. It definitely hits the spot and satisfies the pizza craving, especially if you're a fan of a fluffy, Pizza Hut-type pizza. This is by far, the better. The pepperoni was great. I feel that a lot NY style pizzas are decent and this is far better than decent, but not as good as that darn square one. Big fan, will be back again before heading home.",

The slices are big but I decided it's overpriced (you can get this amount at Costco for cheaper lol!), the flavor or pizza itself is average, and I hate how there isn't really any seating. I came back because a lot of people in my party haven't tried it before and nothing else inside this hotel caught our attention/cravings.",

B or B+ rating, four slices and two drinks for just over $30.00. Service was quick and polite, which is always a plus.   Cleanliness, not so great, counters and fixtures on the wall could have been wiped down and / or dusted. There is a Galaga video game and two pinball machines, only one of the three arcade games worked.  Going into this place, We (my wife and I) walked down a hallwall, surrounded by record albums. HUNDREDS OF THEM! Too cool. Then it just stops.  A) I am suddenly in a subway station. B) I am in a bathroom with tile walls. C) I entered a place known as \"Secret Pizza\"  There are NO signs outside the entrance, or from what I saw, in the casino itself. Luckily, my wife and I parked in valet. The attendant asked where in The Cosmopolitan we were headed. When I asked about \"Secret Pizza\" he smiled and gave us perfect directions. When we returned to pick up our vehicle, the lady who brought the car back, asked how our pizza was. Kudos for valet at The Cosmopolitain. They are deffinetly in on \"The Secret\".",

There was a queue when I arrived but nothing too long and considering it was a Saturday night I had expected others to be there.  While waiting the gentleman behind me told me this was his second trip that day and he said he was a 'pizza snob'. I decided to keep it simple and went for a plain cheese pizza. The slices are far bigger than any kind of pizza slice you would get in the UK.  It cost about $5.  It did not disappoint the pizza tasted great! I would recommend to anyone visiting to give it a try. As it is opened late it's a good late night spot!",

My favorite thing is the super old school black felt menu board with the white plastic letters making up the menu.  Crooked and all.  nicely done!  However cheese NY slice we got was TINY!  Others we saw were more normal size.  so young lady cutting the slices.  Cut them EVEN!  For $ 5 bucks for a cheese slice it needed to be bigger.    Old school place.  Trendy because it's secret.  Well not so much at this point.  But in a place that is classy and where tiny drink at a bar costs you 16 bucks,  this is a bargain.  But better slices can be had in vegas for sure.  But if drunk or hungry or wanting to feed the kids sitting on a couch in the lobby or standing at a counter... this be your place.",

A whole cheese pizza and one slice of white pizza came to around $32, not including tip. Pretty cheap dinner for 4 on the Strip. Pizza was done in 20 minutes. Once back in our room, we completely devoured that delicious cheese pie. So good. Everything you want in a foldable, cheesy, slice. My white slice was even better than the cheese pizza. Yummy, creamy ricotta and fresh garlic flavor. I wish I'd ordered 2 slices. We'll definitely return.  My school-aged kids got the biggest kick out of this place. They loved the idea of eating \"secret\" pizza and trying to keep the entrance a secret. They even enjoyed pinball for the first time while waiting for our food.  One note: They gave us paper plates with our whole pizza, but I noticed the pizza box itself was one of those perforated boxes meant to be torn into \"plates\". Neato.",

I've tried a variety of different topping slices here and each have been great.  Are you and your friends planning on getting four or more slices? I'd recommend ordering a whole pizza instead since it'll work out to be about the same price. I think our pepperoni and sausage pie was $24. Not bad really.

My only gripe is that your making enough money on the slice of pies, so why $4 for a cup of soda ? That took all the fun out of eating here especially when I'm having to by 5 drinks for the famiglia. And yes their pizza is pretty good but would have enjoyed it more if we could of been able to have a second round of pizza slices.",

Apparently the people who wrote those reviews have never had NY style pizza before and forgot where they were...  Here's the deal. Is it the best pizza you'll ever have? Depends on where you are from and if it's NY or NJ then the answer is NO! If you are from the west coast then maybe. The pizza is hot, gooey, crispy and hits the spot especially when it's late and you need some food. It's definitely not the best pizza I've ever had. The pizza is slightly too salty and one dimensional. You don't get that slight sweetness of the tomatoes in the good pizza sauce from NY/NJ. Yes it was greasy. Whatever, just use the napkin dabbing trick to remove the grease! You will not get any pizza better than this around here unless you drive to Settebello.",

Got a pepperoni slice & regular slice. It was fresh out of the oven. There was only 2 people in front of me and 3 people in back. The pizza was overly salty and there was this one super strong tasting herb that didn't taste so good. The cheese was not oozying, but the pizza was mad oily and it was not crispy but soft. Only the crust was crispy because it was burnt.  I will go to Enzo at Venetian. Asked many of my friends from NYC and they rather have Enzo pizza too.",

This place is jammed packed with a line to the front of the long hall around the middle of the night when people are tired of Marquee. Expect slutty dresses, stinky feets, and people who can't stand straight and jibberish talkers. However, if you're like me and also one of these club go-ers, then it's just a hot spot for a late night snack before heading back to the room. :)  Pizza can be sold by the slice or as a whole. By slice is about $4 and is comparable to the size of Costco's pizza. They have a higher end quality in toppings than Pizza Hut and Domino's. The lines may be long but usually it moves fast, unless of course you got someone in front of you whose so drunk she can't tell she's at a pizza place. But what are the chances of that happening, right? Haha. Considering the prices of nearby food places, especially in the Cosmopolitan, Secret Pizza is the cheaper choice.   But, there's still some of us who prefer the late night steak and eggs special in other various Vegas locations!",

It was a lot of fun to find and I love the concept of the the best kept secret, but this really is not what it is.  The service to start with was pretty shitty and probably discriminatory. My friend and I are in the service industry so we would never be one of those rude or extremely picky guests so I know it had nothing to do with our personalities. We witnessed guests in front of us receive friendly service from the cashier lady's good side. With us, she rolled her eyes and rushed us. I was prepared to let that go, given extremely good pizza.  Annnnd the pizza was okay. It was nothing to rave about. I might be bias because I favorite NY style pizza and this was just not close at all. The crust was plain, not enough sauce or cheese and the topping was okay.   It was a fun little hunt inside the Cosmo though, just wish the treasure tasted better.",

Yelp had built it up so much that I was a bit nervous. But one bite of my slice of cheese pizza and I was instantly transported back to my days at NYU. It was the perfect slice of NY-style pizza. So hot it burned the roof of my mouth. So greasy that I went through way too many napkins. So big I did the fold maneuver.  And major props for having beer too. Just two handles - Pabst and a Dogfish Head (I didn't see which one). Totally awesome that they have Dogfish Head.  And big ups for having plastic forks and knives available. For this first try, I had to eat with my hands and be all authentic. But typically, I am a knife and fork girl, so I appreciate it when casual eateries with \"hand food\" also have the proper utensils for those who want them.  Great staff, great food, and great overall vibe (loved the feel, the music, etc.). I will definitely be back,",

After getting some expensive munchies at China Poblano we were ready to fill the rest of our stomachs for a lot less, and Secret Pizza delivered. You go down an unmarked hallway on the 3rd floor and it leads to a teeny little hole-in-wall pizza joint like ones you find on virtually every street corner in NY. The guys keep the huge pies coming, which you get by the slice. A slice will run you about $5, depending on toppings and with a draft of PBR it's almost $10 but that's really a bargain in these parts. 'Sides, the pizza is legitimately good. Big and floppy but with a crunch to the crust, it really made me feel nostalgic for the NY slices I used to get. There was a bit of a rush when we got there but the turnover's pretty fast so you should be able to squeeze into some counter space, unless you get there late night, when the real rush is on, with everyone wanting to get some grub on after clubbing or whatever. I did end up coming here again after such a late-night venture and it tasted even better, naturally. If you find yourself in the Cosmo, your visit isn't complete without a slice from Secret Pizza.",

We came here around 2am on a Tuesday, and luckily there wasn't too much of a line.  The staff was friendly but...interesting.  The spent about 2 minutes \"play arguing\" with each other at the counter before they finally decided to take our order.  Once we were ready to pay one of them couldn't figure out how to use his cash register and had to call his coworker over for help, which prompted another couple minutes of them play arguing/flirting.  Like I said, they were pretty friendly, just bizarre and they kinda seemed like they were on something!     We got half pepperoni and have white pizza.  The wait was about 20 minutes, which isn't too bad for a fresh pizza.  Plus, we had the super wasted girls stumbling about in heels with their dates to entertain us while we waited!  The actual pizza was pretty tasty.  The pepperoni half had a good amount of pepperoni on it, and wasn't overly greasy.  The white half was absolutely fantastic!  It was nice and garlicky and had plenty of cheese(ricotta?).  I think if I come back here, I'd come back just for the white pizza.  Overall, not the best pizza I've ever had, but it was very very good!",

We were told it would take 30 mins...15 mins each pizza. And that the first would be ready in 15.  We were in a bit of a time crunch and starving, but we were down for waiting.  After going up to check on the status of the first pizza, they said that it would be another 15 mins... So instead of telling us that one pizza would be done in 15 minutes, they should have said that both would be done at the same time.....ah..what are you gonna do.  So come when it isn't mid-day on the weekends and you'll probably see a shorter line. But it seems like it's always poppin.  I'd say it's worth it.",

I got cheese and my friend got mushroom. The server warmed up our slices in the oven for us.  I took my first bite and was blown away! Traditional NYC pizza. Simply marvelous.

I don't know how he found out about it, but apparently this place had really good pizza and was hidden somewhere in the Cosmo.  Oh it was hidden all right.  When I jumped on the Cosmopolitan hotel website to find a list of their restaurants....no listing for this place.  Luckily I stumbled on it here on Yelp, listed as \"Secret Pizza\".  I followed other reviewers' directions and hints for finding the place: it's down a sorta-hidden hallway next to the pool tables on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo.  We could smell pizzas in the oven once we got to the 3rd floor, so we knew we were in the right place.  Even in the hotel there was no mention of this pizza place and no signs pointing towards it.  Even the restaurant is unnamed!  But my friend was right, the pizza was delicious (although I think its novelty partially adds to the taste, haha)!  Crispy crust, fresh-tasting dough, and a delicious blend of cheese/sauce as topping!  I got the white pizza (feta and mozzerella cheeses instead of tomato sauce) with mushrooms on it.  I guess because mushrooms aren't a super popular topping, the chef just put raw mushrooms on a slice of white pizza before sending it through the oven to heat it up.  It's okay; still super good!!  White pizza with mushrooms - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=RcmzA0Mj4T73Ytmdtj-ByQ#RcmzA0Mj4T73Ytmdtj-ByQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/secr...</a>  We lucked out coming in at 2pm, which I guess isn't part of the lunch crowd, so there wasn't a line.  However, I've heard there can be a pretty long line for this place, especially in the wee hours of the morning when the nightclubbers come out of Marquee.  Good luck! :)",

    "text": "The allure of knowing something that only the \"in the know\" know has played into human behavior in seeking out food and drink since the time \"Joe sent me\" got people through the speakeasy door. Given the pizza joint at The Cosmopolitan is not listed in any of the hotel's customer collateral nor is it advertised on property and one has to both know it is there and how to get to it, my hubby and I figured this would be more the myth of \"secret place\" hype than good pizza. Happily, we were wrong.  Finding ourselves at the Cosmopolitan about 1:30 in the afternoon one day last week and hungry for just a little something, we went to the Pizzeria. What we discovered is this teeny place makes really good pizza. In fact, my Brooklyn born and reared hubby thought it a good rendition of New York style pizza and coming from him that is high praise. It was the chewy, foldable crust, he said, and just the right amount of sauce and cheese.   A generous slice was about $3.50 so a good value for Las Vegas eats. Pies are sold whole too.   The VERY little pizza shop has standing at counter space for maybe eight - and another two spaces that are low enough to be used by both people in wheelchairs and shorter people...love universal access like that.   But you could not get my claustrophobic self to stay in that little space to eat, so we walked to the lobby outside the Pizzeria and enjoyed our slice in that \"game room\" setting with a pool table, board games, low tables, chairs and sofas scattered about and multicolored glass lit ceiling above.   And here goes a nod to the very nice Security guy who walked over to talk to us. \"Oh oh\" I thought, \"we're probably not supposed to be eating pizza here.\" But as it turns out, he wanted to simply ask how we liked the pizza and being from New York himself, he agreed with my hubby that it was very good indeed. He introduced himself as Chris (Cosmopolitan staff do not wear name tags - a tactic that is part of a service strategy to get the employees to introduce themselves to guests) and asked if he could answer any questions about The Cosmopolitan for us. That kind of friendly approach from customer facing employees was consistent with every one of our experiences at the hotel, by with way, with the exception of the staff at the Chandelier Bar on the second floor.  ( But that's another review.)  We made sure to leave the lobby table as clean as we found it.   Pizzeria opens at 11a.m. and stays open until sometime in the wee hours of the morning.   Here's how to get there (see photos included to illustrate):   a) Take the elevator near the Chandelier Bar to the third floor. When the doors open you'll see the lounge with the pool table in front of you.   b) Make a hard right hairpin turn as you exit the elevator and you'll be in the short hallway that leads to the tiny Pizzeria.  You'll see a pinball machine at the end of the hallway. ( If you make only a right turn as you exit the elevator, you'll end up at the hallway that dead-ends in a concourse of meeting rooms. Ask me how I know that. :-)  A hairpin right is the thing. )  c) The pinball machine you'll see in front of you as you make the hairpin turn is actually at the entry to the pizza place.  So there you go!  Mangia!",

There was a long line that felt like was moving really slowly, but maybe I was just tired from standing in heels all night. There's no seating area to sit and eat apart from a couple barstools, but outside of the place there are a couple chairs and couches in the hotel.  You walk in, stand in a queue, and further inside you can watch them make the pizzas through the protective glass. I must admit...one of the guys working there was especially edible...lost interest in the pizza after some point ;)  I ordered the thin crust white slice which was good, but nothing special. I've had better and cheaper (in NY!!). It was extremely greasy, I had to use a couple napkins to blot it so it doesn't drip all over me and make a mess. It definitely hit the spot though! They also had a Sicilian white pizza which looked amazing, but I wasn't feeling reckless enough to order it. Especially since I need to squeeze into a bikini the next day. Maybe next time. It's a decent place for a late night slice, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it (maybe for the guy making the pizza though...:p)",

I definitely recommend also the people that work there are always very very nice but just prepared to stand in a line but the line goes quickly and it is worth it there are nice comfortable seats to sit outside in the hotel to eat your pizza and watch people walk by",

I love hole in the walls and speakeasies, but I thought this place was a ripoff.  The pizza is SUPER greasy, they don't have any variety (your options are pretty much cheese or pepperoni pizza), the pizza tastes a bit like cardboard, it costs $5 per slice, and they also charge $5 for a bottle of water (outrageous).  There's also really nowhere to sit (just awkward stool seating).  They are also not open before 11am. Boo. So many things wrong with this place.  We were super hungry after my friends' long road trip from LA to Vegas and after my disappointing experience at Jaleo, but I'll know better next time...",

The size of the slice, the thin crust, the pepperoni was flavorful, there was just enough cheese and sauce - there was even just enough grease to make it a bit messy and gooey.  It was the perfect combination of everything that makes pizza great.  My husband is a native New Yorker and believes he knows his pizza (True to the arrogant New York stereotype) and even he said it was simply A-W-E-S-O-M-E.  Perfect slice - starting at $5 per slice.  Sodas are waaaay overpriced ($4 per cup). A bit much for me so I'll be bringing a water bottle or a soda from the vending machine. I just can't do it!!",

So they all left, no one wanted to eat! BOOOOOOOOOOOOOO   Next day.... Walked in during  lunch.. 2 people.... Ordered a whole pizza! Mushroom, green peppers, and pepperoni!  Took them about 25 min to prepare it, and the pizza was huge!!!! I mean I can eat, but that was really big...   There wasn't enough mushrooms on the pizza which was a little disappointing to me! and there was one string of the green pepper on each slice! Good amount of cheese and ok amount of pepperoni...... It was waaay too oily for my taste... I had to dab it down with napkins to soak up the oil...  The crust was amazing though... we ended up eating half of the pizza and took the other half to go... at night while I was having my red bull vodka, I was taking the crust off of the rest of the pizza (which no longer looked appetizing) and it still tasted great...   Overall the place is ok! With a little less oil and a little more ingredients it could be a 4 star place...",

With a variety of slices to choose from, even white pizza *GASP* they didn't stop moving. Their pizza was THAT good!  They've got beer on tap and soda too. Prices affordable.

The line is long cuz they have to heat it up. I got the meat one with pepperoni and meatballs and the white sauce which is like a creamy delicious one. I really liked each because I needed meat but the white was yelpy. The crust is thin and I devoured 1.5 easy. It cost about $12 or so.

The pizza my friends and I got from here just seemed to be grease on pepperoni on grease on cheese on grease on grease-softened dough. Notice a trend there?  Yes, the pizza is huge, and yes, maybe the fact that one needs to weave through a couple of corridors to find this place is a little exciting, but the quality of the pizza is mediocre at best, subpar realistically speaking. I've definitely had better.  As for the atmosphere, it is not a place to sit down at and talk. In fact, there are no tables to sit down. The place was very hectic when I came, with loads of people standing in line and others bustling around to get to the cheese and eating utensils. It reminds me of a fast food joint that people hustle into late at night when there are no other options just to leave it as quickly as possible.  On the bright side, the service is quick and efficient as would be expected in a fast-paced casino environment on the strip. I still would not recommend this place.",

The sodas were $4 for a solo cup size but the nice cold water fit the bill to wash down my slice.   I wish I'd waited for my slice to cool a bit before I went after it. It was so fresh and hot that picking it up caused the toppings to slide around. I went folded style and it was greasy good.   I'll try it again next time and chill out for a minute while it cools!",

It's a bit hard to find in the afternoon when there isn't a line of drunk clubbers leading you to the hole in the wall. It's also cleaner in the afternoon when there aren't any drunk clubbers throwing napkins everywhere like a bunch of animals. The lines during the night however is savage. It makes people angrily stomp away, drunkenly slurring \"I'm not waiting 2 hours for f***ing pizza!\"  Then you breathe a sigh of relief as the wait time weeds out the weak and the long line gets shorter. But it does get hard with people walking past you with the delicious smell of pizza pies being waved in your face. Then your stomach starts to eat itself from the lack of pizza in it.  The employees are quick and the ovens can only work so fast, it's the people who order that are slow and absolutely inconsiderate (did they forget the rest of the people behind them??).  The pizza is usually thin crust, which is good, nice and crunchy. They also have a deep dish one too. The sausages are pretty salty, especially the sausage with peppercinis, which is good for the drunken animals that roam Las Vegas when the clubs are closing. But my favorite is the regular cheese pizza or the white cheese pizza. Soooo frickin good. Get yourself a slice! They're pretty big slices too. I heard people commenting about it reminding them of New York pizza, but I've never been to New York so I can't really tell.  I'll remember you secret pizza when I'm drunkenly stumbling around Las Vegas to look for some food.",

What I loved most was that staple flavors, like pepperoni, cheese or veggie, were just what you'd expect but SO flavorful!   The white pizza was amazing. No sauce - mozzarella dotted with heaps of herbed ricotta, slathered with a buttery garlic sauce.   The sausage with onion and green peppers was perfect too. Spicy, thinly-sliced Italian sausage made for some perfect bites.   Love this place. Highly recommended for any time of the day!",

It's really no secret that the secret pizza puts out some of the best late night eats this side of the strip! But most importantly, if you're staying at the Cosmo, there's no need to trek out in inclement weather or battle the strip crowd for good grub either.    Thankfully, on the late night I stumbled in, the line wasn't too obnoxiously long. Be warned, on certain nights when the Marquee or Chelsea has an event, you could be waiting for quite awhile for your slice, so plan accordingly!   Overall, the pizzas are very tasty. Thinly sliced NYC style (for you to fold and eat) with a variety of topping options. My personal favorites are the works and white pizzas. They've got loads of condiments like oregano, granulated garlic, cheese, chili flakes etc for you to customize your pies, well.   Happy Eats!",

The flavors and kinds of pizza rotate which means that once it's your turn if you don't see anything that you like, well it sucks for you. Go back in line and wait another 30 mins.  I got myself a pepperoni slice thinking that since it's the most basic pizza, it would taste alright either way. It did taste alright mostly because it was 3 am and I was drunk and starving. But I gotta be honest and say that I wouldn't go back there because of the wait and because the pizza isn't fantastic at all.   And for the service? I came here on a Saturday (or rather early Sunday morning) at 3am after the club and so did a bunch of people and I think the workers are fed up with us. Understandable but come on at least fake a smile.",

It's basically New York style pizza that you can order by the slice or by the whole.   The menu is simple and you can ask them if they have any other flavors, since they have other pizzas hidden and not on display.  I went there twice and one night there was absolutely no line and the other night, there was a long line out the door. I would anticipate a line if you come here really late at night.

There is little to no seating at this place, however there is a small lounge area right outside. Think about buying a pie if you're with a large group.",

The line was mercifully short (only wound around once and ended before the hallway) and moved quickly. I couldn't decide between the white pizza or the mushroom and got both. (Hey, it's Vegas!)  Zero regrets. My friends and I took seats in the lounge area right outside to enjoy our late night meal. I had to suppress audible moans as I dug into the crunchy, tasty, perfectly seasoned, not too oily masterpiece that this place is famous for. Worth every damn penny.

The pizza here is thin, a little on the greasy side, generously cut and oh so delicious!! The place is tiny so you probably will not have anywhere to sit, we just stood and enjoyed our slices of heaven. Great pizza at great prices (for Vegas anyway)!",

The much vaunted white pizza is just white cheese on thin crust, nothing all that tremendously unique or special.

My boyfriend decided that I should try this place since we were staying at the cosmo. I've always heard really good things about this but have never actually been because I always end up at Earls after getting out of the clubs.  Found our way around in this hidden gem through a short alley. It wasn't a long line thank goodness. With literally 4 chairs in this hole in the wall your best bet is to scoot next to someone elbow it down and eat your pizza among those others. I ordered the combo/supreme and my boyfriend had the pepperoni. Omgggg it was delicious the entire crust of the pizza was crispy and the cheese and topping just married together. Add some pepper flakes and garlic powder and you are set my friend. I'm so happy I finally got to try it! Next time we are ordering the whole pie. More cost efficient :) plus more pizza nom nom!!",

Let me tell you hipsters something: it's not a SECRET anymore if you have to wait in line for 30 minutes behind every fake-glasses-wearing jackass in Vegas and his whorey, vodka-drenched, barefoot sister to get in. It's pretty f*ckin' mainstream by that point!   Still, there is a True GEM to be found here. But it's not the pizza -- it's the WINE! They'll pour you a huge plastic cup of some improbably genteel boxed wine for $6. It's enough to last you all night!  The pizza is actually pretty good, too (and I detest pizza): big slices for around $5 each, with lots of nommy toppings. But whatever! No one wants to sit around eating pizza all night.  My advice is to get a big old plastic cup o'boxed red and then head down to one of the other, more pretentious \"mixology\" bars in the Cosmo...where you can get soused in style, smug with the secret knowledge that you're getting totally f*cked up for less than the cost of one of those lame blocks of \"art\" they sell in the ripoff trending machines -- I mean VENDING machines.  Let the mixologists whip up complicated overpriced \"libations\" for the bebe-clad idiot masses...boxed wine is good enough for anyone who's REALLY cool. But if you INSIST upon being a hipster...you can use the money you saved on drinks to buy one of those lame blocks of \"art\" from the vending machines nearby. Sucka!",

    "text": "Secret Pizza is good. Thin crust, freshly baked and a simple menu. This place really was secret! We had to ask for directions to get to the place. Since we went at 3am when all the drunk clubbers start to stumble out in search of food, the line was pretty long; 30 minutes. So maybe this place is not so secret anymore... We waited at the end of a dark hallway covered in old record covers and loud music. I certainly enjoyed the casual atmosphere, giving me a break from the usual extravagant atmosphere of Las Vegas.   We ordered the 3-topping pie ($26 for a large size). Pepperoni, mushrooms, and ricotta. Made to order thin crust. It was delicious. Definitely flavorful, without too much sauce, and not overwhelming. My friends and I kept the leftovers and ate them for breakfast the rest of the weekend! Great pizza place on the Strip.  For reference, If you have ever been to Home Slice Pizza in Austin, TX, I would say Secret Pizza is 1-2 steps down from that.",

The pizza was GREAT, i'm from the northeast so, no, it wasn't the BEST i ever had, but it was REALLY good.   The price was ridiculous. Whoever said it was cheap is cray-cray. $5 a slice? LOL in jersey that gets you a half a pizza.   So -1 for the price, +4 for the pizza itself. I thought the guys were OK there, kinda like the people at home, here's your pizza, gimme the money. I don't mind that in the least.",

The white pizza is good and the pep is good as well. The slices are $5 and served ready to go on a paper plate and a checkered greasy wrapper thats going to slide off the plate as soon as you pick up your slice.    Secret pizza is ideal for stopping in, getting a slice and leaving, but it is also a comfortable place because its decorated with a lot of cool stuff.  Too bad this place is in Vegas because my hometown L.A. has few and far i between spots a brotha can get a good pizza slice.",

There are no signs. You have to walk through a small hallway, so it kinda reminded me of those bathrooms in the malls which are tucked away 2 stores.   Of course there was a line. We waited about 15 min to order at 2pm on a Sat. The pizza is NY style pizza where the pizza are precooked, and they reheat the slices as we ordered. I shared slices of combination, pepperoni, and sausage with my friend. The pizza was ok. Nothing good and nothing bad. However, it was so greasy. We had to dab the oil off with a napkin before we ate it.   This is probably perfect for eating after drinking, but I'd imagine the lines being ridiculously long with Marquee being right there.   If I ever come back, I would like to try the white pizza. My other friends had it and it looked delicious.",

I will say that expectations can tend to get high when you wait 30-45-60 minutes in line for something, but SP certainly delivered.  The pie was so delicious and I'm pretty sure I woke up with a burnt mouth because I didn't even want to wait for it to cool down.  I guess I should have rated SP a 1/5 and said it's the worst thing out there so less people would show up...  Can't wait to go back - Vegas needs more late night food spots like this one.",

The crust is chewy, crispy, and you want to eat it on its own. The sauce is not sweet in True NY fashion and tastes like real tomato not some slapped on tomato paste concoction. And cheese that has that perfect melty, salty, greasy, stretchiness. It's the kind of pizza you get mad when your full cuz you just want to have more.",

Only thing better than the pizza itself is the hotel it's located inside of! the @cosmohotel is by far the nicest hotel I've ever stayed and they always go above and beyond to make the stay an incredible 1! Secret pizza is a must try tho, I was sooooo impressed that I legit went back for dinner after having it for lunch the same day! Do not hesitate to try it and do not let the long line discourage you from going... It moves FAST",

It was bland and tasted as if it came from a can or jar.   The cheese was decent but not impressive in both quantity and quality.  After paying 38 dollars for 4 slices (2 cheese, 1 white pizza, 1 mushroom) and 2 cans of Stella Artois, I expected more.   Oh well.... it got the job done but definitely wasn't worth the expense.",

I believe this secret pizza parlor is located on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan and right in between the glass elevator and the sushi(?) restaurant. They have pizzas prepare but they slide in what slices you order back into the oven to warm it up, which is ehh but I'm not that picky. Pizza is pizza. But their white pizza was actually being made in the oven so the crust had the perfect crunch and it was so freaking bomb.",

About $5 for a slice of cheese, but its an additional $0.25 for toppings. It takes about 15 minutes for a whole pizza and its much cheaper to buy a whole pizza. Pizza is like NY style (my favorite style of pizza) and they kind of got it right!",

    "text": "I stumbled upon this gem by a recommendation from one of my cheap friends who opposed spending money from overpriced food.  Obviously if you are in Vegas, you can go so far from stretching your buck to fill your stomach.  Nonetheless, he recommended me this pizza location which is located on the 3rd floor of Cosmopolitan and boy was he was already first in line and ready to wreck havoc on his chosen slice of pizza.  At that moment I realized he did not care about the price that he usually grumbles about, but that he was head over heels about that slice.  ONIONS, JALAPENOS, and SAUSAGE - First and foremost, a cost of delicate cheese pizza is $5.00.  Any toppings on top of that is an additional $0.50.  3 times $0.40 that slice of pizza is going to cost me $6.50.  Quite pricey, but as expected I conformed as my pal had such rave reviews about.  Going, there were a few selections of pizza out there, toppings essentially are made as is and if you wanted other toppings you'd probably have to wait for those pies to come out fresh from the oven.  I decided to follow my friend's decision with the OJS, and got me a slice of that.  While waiting in line to get my payment, I saw one of my favorite toppings pepperoni and cheese pizza freshly baked, but by the time it was out I had already been paying so I could not switch it up.  Hot and sizzling on that to go plate, dang it looked nice. As a reminder, I did not anticipate any amazing taste whatsoever.  BUT, the moment I placed this slice of pizza in my mouth, it was amazing.  It brought back so many memories during the time I went to Brooklyn for their specialty pizzas.  It was very similar, piping hot, thin crust, savory & excellently cheesed up.  Sprinkle in some grated cheese and peppers and my senses were running wild.  It definitely hit the stop, I did not expect that much flavor from such simple ingredients.  I definitely admired the all three toppings piled up together.  The grilled onions, jalapenos, and special sausage evenly surfaced on that pizza and brought a wondrous smile out of me.  I really enjoy the slice and downed it immediately.  I really wanted that second slice, but my group were on the go so it was bye bye for now.  I now understand why there were so many people with pie boxes coming in and out and they were not wrong for that.  Definitely will be coming back here to feast on another slice whenever I visit Vegas.",

Yes, it may be the whole hype that got my expectation up but it was okay... good... but definitely not something that i care to go back to.    It was more of a place you go once to go and then you never have to go again lol  The slice was thin which I adore thin crust... but it was pretty doughy which I dont like and it shouldnt be like that! Its suppose to have that crunch on the outside with the soft interior but nope! not this slice I had or the bite I stole from my fiance (and it was two different type of pizza so its not one of those \"you got the bad one this one time\").",

    "text": "Like Johnny Cash, I've been everywhere, man.  I've had PIZZA everywhere, man.  And Secret Pizza is, hands-down, the best pizza I've had ANYWHERE.  A few days ago, my fiance and I got into a random conversation about what we would want to eat for a last meal if we found ourselves on Death Row.  Both of us were kind of stumped.  Now we know.  SECRET PIZZA.  In fact, if Secret Pizza was ONLY served on Death Row, I would commit atrocities against society to get my slice.  I would.  Finding the place was kind of fun.  I had an idea of where it might be based on other Yelp reviews, but I found myself tugging on door handles that do not open and trying to push on panes of glass that looked loose.  I guess I expected it to be so secret that I would have to prove my worth in death-defying feats of strength or manifest the entrance with the power of my mind.  Oh I figured it out alright, but not before I made a total ass of my dorky self in front of lots of scantily-clad club-goers.  My fiance started freaking out first.  For him, it was love at first ooey-gooey sight.  I heard nearby diners launching expletive-laced raves about how it was the best \"mo-effin' pizza ever.\"  Yet, until I took that first bite, I didn't believe.  Now I have seen the light... I have come to Pizza Jesus.  During the entire consumption of my portion of our pie (pepperoni, sausage, and pepperoncini), I giggled like I did on my first date with my fiance.  It was so good that I found it almost hilarious, especially since I just now found this place and I'M MOVING AWAY IN JUNE.  Oh, the cruel, cruel irony.  It's a cold world indeed.  We had plenty of leftovers.  On the way to the car with our ginormous pizza box, my fiance and I argued over how I was apparently \"mothering him\" by making him hold our precious treasure with two hands.  Maybe he has a point - maybe I need to have a baby to detract from my abnormal attachment to inanimate objects (like pizza).  But I digress.  Oh, and we had to remove a shelf in our fridge to make the box fit.  I'm not even sure it was meant to be removed.  I actually think it's broken now.  Oh well.  It's worth sacrificing the security deposit on our apartment to preserve the pristine state of our perfect pizza.  EDIT:  FYI, the REAL secret of Secret Pizza is that you really need to order the whole pizza so it is fresh and hot.  It isn't nearly as good if you just buy whatever slice is hanging around.  Take my word for it.  Buying the whole pie and having it piping hot takes this pizza from around 3 stars to 5.",

Get the white pizza.... love, Love, LOVE the ricotta cheese on them.  It's about $3.50 a slice, but big thin crust slices.

It's located on the same floor as STK, almost directly across from it. It doesn't have a sign to tell you it's there and it's located through a small little hallway, so it may be a little bit tricky to find.   This place has New York style pizza. You can order by the slice, and if you want extra toppings on it, just ask and they'll put it on before reheating it in their oven. Very simple pizza but tasty. It's a very small place, and basically standing room only. This place is more of a grab and eat on the go because you can't really dine in. Worth checking out if you're close by, and who doesn't love pizza when they are drunk?",

    "text": "Secret Pizza is a great addition to the culinary group that the Cosmopolitan has to offer, and here are a couple of reasons why:  1. If you are looking for something cheap, easy to eat, and convenient at odd/normal hours, this is the place for you. After a night of gambling and walking the strip all I wanted was some comfort food and I knew exactly which alley way to turn into.   2. They limit your selection -- meaning it isn't a vegas buffet in which you way 30+ bucks and have billions of things to choose from. It's more like you have 10 bucks and you should just choose 2 huge new york slices that will satisfy your tummy for a while...unless you can handle more but that's all you!  3. They have a unique white sauce pizza that has a dollops of ricotta cheese and tastes like high caloric heaven, but is worth every bite.   4. The beauty is in the simplicity. A simple menu, simple products, simple food, simple happiness. There isn't an easier key to great food. Yes there might be a long line of drunkies at 2am, but that's why you plan ahead ;) Seating is an issue because the place is literally a narrow alley, but the great thing about pizza is that it's a walk and eat kind of item.   5. If you think that the slice is missing something you can add individual toppings for a cost and they will do it begrudgingly, for a SINGLE slice! Something I think that other pizza places can definitely learn from.   Definitely a must visit in Vegas and it is in on the my favorite hotels on the strip, a perfect fit!",

You can get a big slice for under $5, I believe it's NY style (thin crust).  Service has almost always been with a smile, and it's so convenient either before or after visiting Marquee.  Hmm... I wish I could speak more of its awesomeness, but I guess I've said it all.  My yelp buddy Rod U said it well, it's not the best pizza in Vegas, but it's an experience.  Hip and trendy, you'll spot a lot of other clubgoers hitting it up.  For its convenience, and quality, I am definitely a fan.",

Found this place in April thanks to my fellow \"Yelpers\" and we were NOT disappointed.!!! We checked in to our hotel and we were hungry!!!! We both said at the same time \"secret pizza\" !!!!  Walked out of our hotel and went straight to \"Cosmopolitan\" to the Best pizza ever!!!!  Place was very busy but the pizza was worth the wait!  I can't get beyond the \"White pizza \". It is awesome!!!! You can choose from their selections or make your own.  Wait time was like 5 minutes. Staff is friendly and helpful with suggestions. Can buy by the slice or a whole pizza.  One slice is rather filling. Only about 4 seats but counters to stand and eat. So if you are looking for a fancy place not here. But you will not be disappointed if you like pizza.  Price for two slices was like $11 bucks.......but this is Vegas so not bad.  We had not eaten all day and we were good for the rest of the night!!!!   Made a second trip for this pizza later in the week...needed a pizza \"fix\" for the road!  A must try if in Vegas!!!!  If you are a late night party person, this place is open until 5 AM!!!!!",

I had to ask one of the front desk men where it was! There is no sign whatsoever, so asking is the safest way!  WHEN: I have no idea when it closes, but it closes late! We went at 2am, and there was still a line to order!  WHY: Thin-crust pizza is the way to go, THAT'S WHY!  WHAT: Standing in the line, I was looking for some sort of menu, but there actually wasn't one! I was somewhat confused because I am so used to there being a menu explaining it all!  When you get up to the counter, there are toppings you can choose from to make your slice of pizza to your liking, or there are also pre-made slices you can get! I just chose one of the pre-made slices that looked pretty interesting!  On my pizza, along with the mozzarella cheese, there was another type of cheese that I didn't get to remember, but it was REALLY GOOD! I also had mushrooms and green peppers.  I did get to try the White Pizza from my friend!! That was actually one of the most unique slices of pizza I have ever tried!! Instead of marinara sauce, there was some type of garlic sauce under CHEEESE, CHEESE, AND MORE CHEESE! =D  *NOTE: Try it out after all that partying one night! The line might scare you off, but it's okay- the line went by fairly fast!",

We went here before we went to Marquee because we needed something quick to eat before we drank, so we didn't get too effed up.   It's a hidden gem, it's called Secret Pizza after all. The pizza is actually really good. They make it really easy to purchase by the slice, because that's all I really needed to eat to get me through the night. Someone needs to let you know where this joint is, or you're going to have to walk around searching like a crazy person. If you find it, it's worth it!",

Located on the 3rd floor where all the restaurants are concentrated, it was easy to find since there was a long line propagating in the \"hidden\" hallway. I was somewhat annoyed that I had to wait for the pizza, but the pizza was decent. You can tell that the dough is quite fresh and had an authentic Italian taste to the crust. If you can avoid waiting in line for this place, it is even better. They have a water dispensing machine by the cash register, but that device does not work properly as it barely trickles any water. You are better off purchasing a drink than relying on their water dispenser. They had some vintage pinball machines in this pizza joint, but they were non-functional. Also, my pizza was somewhat cold so if you are getting slices of pizza, make sure to ask them to reheat your pizza so that it is piping warm.",

    "text": "Mouth. Watering. Pizza.   I can't tell you how good this pizza is. It's a great combination of salty and cheesy goodness. I always get either a slice of their mushroom pizza or white pizza. Their mushroom pizza is delicious + a little bit of added chili flakes makes the saltiness of the pizza all come together for a flavorful bite. Their white pizza is probably one of their more famous pies and with good reason, it's delicious! It's a mozzarella (and parmesan?) based slice topped with ricotta cheese. At first, I thought it would be too much cheese for my liking but it all somehow comes together as cheesy goodness.  Now, the crust...it's all about the crust!! The pizza itself is thin with a slight crunchy bite to it. The crust is crispy but with a doughy inside that I love. The slices run pretty big so it's worth the price! ($5/6) Usually all it takes is one slice for me to be done, two if I'm super hungry. I've never had to wait in a long line to place my order (my wait is usually like 5 mins) but I've been told it can get pretty crazy late night when the clubs close.  My only complaint about the pizza is that it can be a little too oily. Seeing small puddles of greasiness is kind of gross, but nothing a pat down with a napkin won't fix. Just wish I didn't have to perform this messy task before eating it.   Seating is available inside (best for parties of 2, not so much for bigger parties) & all around the lounge type area but it can be difficult to find an open space during a busy night. The pizzeria itself is located on the 3rd floor of Cosmo, down a hallway across from the escalators.",

I ate here twice, once when I was pretty drunk and once when I was sober, and it tasted the same both times I came--slightly burnt and overwhelmingly greasy.

I'm starving for pizza at about 2AM... thought of this place and in the freeZing 59 degree night (I'm from Hawaii so I was freezing my tail off) and walked over to Cosmo and went into Secret Pizza!!!! Loved it! The mushroom and pepperoni pizza and mushroom pizza were great!!! The other pizza with sun dried tomatoes was great as well (or so my boyfriend says lol)!",

I expected the worst, not trusting anyplace that relies on a gimmick. But this is darn good pizza. Not exactly the best I ever had in my life, but up near the top. Thin crust , with the right balance of crunch and chew and a bit of char on the bottom. Tangy sauce that gives a taste of tomato. Mozzarella in abundance and just enough olive oil. A pleasant surprise, worth a trip.",

The wait is usually torturous and the prices are kinda high but the thin crispy bottom, the molten cheese, the pepperoni, all marry into the perfect post club drunken food.  Of course I forgot to take a picture because I couldn't wait but I can guarantee it looked like whatever was in that suitcase in Pulp Fiction. Pure deliciousness.  We also had some leftover from the night before so we microwaved it and ate it in the morning. Still dank.  Oh and I also saw YG while eating the pizza at the benches outside. That was brazy.",

They have a long hallway full of pictures that lead to the back where all the secrets are! The place is very small. No tables inside for seating besides a small standing area. They have a couple old school video games.   They have slices ready to choose from or if you want a whole pizza it could take 15 minutes or more. We had just arrived to Vegas so we were starving. We each went with two slices. They place them in their oven for a few minutes to reheat them and then we took them up to our room.  I got one with everything on it and thought it was just okay. With so many ingredients I still found it lacking flavor and sauce. I also tried the feta cheese one. I again was not impressed and it was bland. My hubby got a sausage one and he loved it. He also tried mine and liked mine. So maybe it was just how I prefer my pizza, I personally just didn't like it.",

Depending on what time you go, the line can either be super short or out the door. Either way, you won't regret coming here.  As the name suggests, the location of it is a little secret. That is, you really have to know where you're going or you'll easily walk by it. To be honest, the easiest way to get there is to go to Marquee nightclub and then take the glass elevator up to the third floor. When the elevator doors open, Secret Pizza will be to your immediate right. (If someone knows of a quicker way to get here please let me know!)  My personal favorite here is the white pizza which has alfredo sauce and a variety of cheeses for toppings, but if you're lucky I definitely recommend the deep dish Sicilian pizza--is it TO DIE FOR!!  The cost of a slice can vary from $5 and upwards and you can expect to wait a couple minutes if you order a whole pizza as well (but can you blame them? Its fresh)!  One note: they do offer complimentary water but after a certain hour into the evening they stop doing so.  (27/100)",

I've been here for 3 years and am always at the Cosmo. Shame I would have went here more if they had a sign or I knew about it. I guess being a secret is a better concept lol.  After walking in it is a totally normal pizzeria with a Brooklyn flair to it. Again just pizza, no garlic bread or knots. Nothing on the side just pizza. A tad over priced pizza. $6 for a slice seems steep when a pie is usually double that price but I mean I forget it's strip prices. I was going to get two slices but was not paying $12.   The slice I got was a white pizza. It was very good. Nothing over the top but still good. I'm from NY so impressing me with pizza is hard to do.   The staff was nice and friendly and pizza didn't take long. If you can actually find this place try it out. Only if you want pizza though. GOD SPEED!",

Some people may think the staff is rude but they're just straight forward and busy. With a line of 100 people, when it's your turn, know what you want! It's not cheap but the slices are big and the ingredients are high quality. Place is small so it's doubtful you'll be eating there. Check it out if you want authentic New York style pizza with great toppings!",

They make sure your slice is hot when you get it.  Slices are around $6 each depending on toppings. They are pretty big slices, too. The crust nice and chewy. I personally like greasy pizza, so I liked this. Good flavor.  My only complaint was the lack of seating. There was 3 arcade/pinball machines taking up valuable eating real estate.",

The wait was average, at about 20 minutes, but we were very hungry so it seemed like forever. Each pizza was 10 slices, and since there were five of us, we each got four slices.  Not eating the crusts, I was barely able to finish my four slices and felt extremely full afterward, which is uncommon for me. Most of my friends were not able to finish their slices as well. The pizzas were not too expensive either, so the price to portion ratio was great.  I absolutely recommend checking this place out. Besides the good food, the place itself is an experience. I won't spoil too much (although I'm sure the pictures online will), but just for the environment this place was worth it.",

I'd hope that they would give you a larger slice for that price or put a couple more pepperonis.. I had visited last time in January and now April. I believe it used to be $4.50 for my one topping pepperoni. Sigh..best deal is to get an entire pie and save it for leftovers if you're not going to be able to consume it all right away.

I had to look at the yelp photos to make sure it was the right place and indeed it was!   Get the Super Deluxe slice because you could add up to 6 toppings (I think) for $6 iish bucks. I only went with 4 toppings: mushroom, sliced sausage, dried tomatoes, and olives. YUM. They basically cook your pizza by the order. Their sliced sausage is so flavorful! It's pretty thick cut too.

So now that you know the \"secret\" I'll go on with my review...  I was worried about even finding this place since it's supposed to be a \"secret\" but all the restaurants mainly being on the 3rd floor give it away a bit.  You'll find the secret pizza shop down a long hallway lined with album covers.  It's a very cool concept really!  Hide the cheapest option in Vegas so you feel like you've \"hit the jackpot\" when you score a New York style slice for $3.50!  I was a bit confused by the menu.  Well, it's not even a menu, it's a sign that says slice of pizza $3.50 and whole pizza XX amount (sorry, can't remember the whole pizza amount).  Since a lot of the business I suspected was by the slice, my idea was you can add on toppings and they'll \"bake\" (reheat) it on the spot.  Not the case...  There's around 4 or 5 pizza's sitting out that you choose from.  Better hope you like what's sitting out, because that's your only option by the slice.  I love mushrooms, so I wanted a cheese and mushroom pizza.  No luck for Rachel.    I instead ordered the white pizza with tomato and spinach and I thought they'd pop it into the stove for a couple seconds to heat it up.  No such luck.  It's served to you right then and there.  I think that's why it came out a little dry and underwhelming for me.  It wasn't \"right out of the oven\" but out of the oven a couple minutes/a while later...And that really made me not a fan.  But I really think I would have thought differently about it had it been right out of the oven.  So order the whole pie and do it the right way!",

Inside have a couple of pinball machines and doesn't have a seating area.   Service: Okay.

The Ricotta makes it Da Bomb!! Might be slightly greasy on the top, but nothing with a little bit of napkin pressing won't fix. I normally like my pizza with more toppings but this one was really good by itself!  Combo Pizza - $5 It was up to par. Tasted similar to Costco pizza.  Price: Okay.  Overall: Great place for a quick bite or even a late night snack after the clubs.",

Late night study session, putting the finishing touches on a major presentation, hard night of clubbing, end of a 24 hour session of hard core grinding on the green felt.  You crave it.  You gotta have it.  Once you do, you're smiling and loving life.  That said Secret Pizza is more about the experience than food.  Decent New York style thin crust with a good balance of quality ingredients.  Tasty sausage, good quality cheeses, ripe acidic tomatoes.  Generous toppings but not overloaded.  Never too out there combos (ie,  CPK).    Is it the best pie in the US?  NO.  Not even the best in Vegas.    Inexpensive for the Strip (less than $5 a slice).  You get to play the cool, adventurer as you seek out it's goodness (exactly what the Cosmo is all about).  The best part, you can take your slice and eat it while walking through the casino and watch the envious drool.  One of them might even ask you where you got it.  The answer is obvious, \"it's a secret\".  Sometimes, to experience the adventure is more important than the food.  Recommended.",

After the mess it took to check into our hotel, find our reservation, get to our room, etc., all we wanted to do was sleep but we were hungry and only had a limited time in Vegas to explore so we hit up this place.   Secret Pizza is located on the 3rd floor of Cosmo across from the night club. Just look for all the drunk people stumbling toward this place and a narrow hallway with vintage records on the wall.   Inside, this place is super tiny but the staff keeps you entertained with grand shows of spinning pizza dough etc. We were tired but fully awake after their friendly banter. Pizza isn't cheap but then again Vegas isn't exactly cheap so be prepared to pay $5 a slice. We each got the supreme with a variety of meats. Drinks are also expensive so we opted for water.   Overall, there's a great selection of pizzas (and seasonings!) and you can see them being made fresh. It's open late for all your cravings.",

I think it's the best I've had since new york! I had the sundried tomatoes, pepperoncini, and green bell peppers. Their slices are huge, but with my HUGE appetite I had two slices and I was STUFFED!

From the pictures on Yelp and even up to the moment where I was standing in line ordering the pizza, I thought to myself, \"meh.\"    Kristin C. raved about the pizza while we were eating lunch at the Cosmopolitan and my boyfriend and I were a bit skeptical that pizza could be THAT good.  Well, we ate our words later that night.  After catching a show at a neighboring casino, my boyfriend and I cabbed it to the Cosmopolitan to meet up with everyone who was at Marquee enjoying Kaskade.  Unfortunately, we never met up - but fortunately, I had a really good slice of pizza! The crust is chewy and the tomato sauce is flavorful. AND, the pizza is relatively cheap for Vegas/Cosmopolitan prices (around $3/slice of cheese).  While we were standing in line for pizza, a FIGHT broke out! That's how crazy good the pizza is.  Take my word for it.  The best part of enjoying the pizza? It's too small and cramped to eat inside the actual Pizzeria, so venture outside and people watch.  Not only was Kaskade djing at Marquee that night, but the Strokes had played a show at the Cosmopolitan.  My boyfriend and I played a fun game of \"Marquee line reject or Strokes fan?\"  Surprisingly not as easy as you think! Platinum blonde, short mini dress, stripper heels and CHEST TATTOO. Marquee line reject or Strokes fan??? YOU TELL ME!",

It's sliced up in bigger pieces plus the cheese just melts in your mouth!  Really small and seating can be a problem. Seems like its more of a grab and go kinda thang.

The same is the case with this pizzeria.  The pizza toppings themselves were tasty enough but the fine details of a great thin crust pizza were missing from my experience.  The magic wasn't there for me.  It just wasn't crusty and chewy enough, and there wasn't enough yummy smokey taste that comes from a slight char on the belly of a perfect slice of thin crust pizza.  Was it because it Saturday night at 12 pm wasn't prime time for pizza?  Conclusion:  I am definitely going to be the minority opinion here *bracing to have tomatoes thrown at me*....The Pizzeria at the Cosmopolitan didn't quite hit the mark, but if left with middle of the night munchies, I still welcome it as an option for late night pizza.  My favorite thin crust pizza is still at North End Pizza over on the Northwest part of town.",

The cafe on the ground floor is good if you can beat the line.  Now DO NOT go here after the clubbing hours. Its madness, the pies get picked up almost immediately and it takes forever to get a couple slices because people just want something in there tummies to take the buzz off or kill the hangover that is going to come the next night.   GIven its next to Marquee - all the clubbers will hit this spot immediately after partying.  I have met the chef here, and he was real friendly as is most of the staff (Unless its post clubbing time - which is crunchtime for them)! I recommend the white cheese pizza and a simple Pepperoni. But if its late - good luck whatever comes out of the oven first is what you are going to get - but alas - the pies here are all good. I have tried 5 or 6 flavors and none have dissapointed me.   Here's a secret - if you are staying at the Cosmo you can order a whole Pizza and they will deliver it to your room. It takes about 45-1 hour but it beats waiting in line with the rest of the drunkies!",

I first stopped in due to pure rumor of deliciousness and was led there by its intoxicating aroma.   When you first walk in you'll be greeted by a staff that makes the word gregarious seem modest but they have an obvious passion for pizza making and their quality ingredients.  What I was most impressed with is the made to order style and due to my dairy allergy they were able to make a \"Red\" pizza with all the toppings and still very satisfying.    A key thing to remember is you better hit up the ATM after an evening out since this is cash only and be prepared to wait if you're asking for something fresh and made to order.

NY style pizza? with how much I have been missing my home lately I needed to get my crack pizza fix. After walking all around, hunting, and putting my super pizza senses to work my friend and I found this place. 3rd floor. hidden back with a walk along vintage album covers. I am giving it a star for all the top secret pizza business going on, but to be honest I was let down with the pizza. The employees were eh and after waiting and looking at each other for a few minutes they asked if we needed any help. I ordered the margarita pizza while my friend just had the cheese. It was thin like nyc, but very hard. I had to work to fold my pizza. (yes, i am a folder. stop judging me las vegas.) i'm use to my pizza being so hot that it burns the roof of my mouth leaving me with a reminder for days of that glorious pizza i consumed days before. This one was warm but not hot. It lacked a certain flavor, but I couldn't put my finger on what. My friend said his basic cheese slice tasted no different then sbarro's, I was mad at myself for paying 4 bucks for this slice, but what can ya do? the hunt was fun and maybe this would be good pizza after an evening of drinking inside the cosmo, but coming from a new yorker this is not new york style pizza. sorry super secret pizzeria, but you didn't win over my heart.",

Like most newbees I had a hard time finding it here is a post that helped me find it :   \"Take escalators to restaurant floor (third floor). At top of escalators you will be facing Jaleo. Immediately on the left of this restaurant is a (narrow by Vegas standards) hallway - the pizza place is down this hallway. You'll see people indulging in pizza by the pool table in this area and know you've hit the right spot. :)  best,  the pokerfoodie\"  If you stay on the strip and don't hit this place at least once your missing out big time!!!!",

It takes at least 30 minutes if you order a whole pizza, so to curb your hunger you can just grab a slice... although, the freshly baked pizza is really worth waiting for if pizza is your thing.  My one issue? Secret pizza is not really secret. On Saturday night it took 30 minutes to get through the line, then another 30 ,inutes as my friends and I ordered a whole pizza. At 3am - we were drunk and hungry so this was not happy time.  Granted, it was Saturday on Halloween weekend so maybe it was especially packed. But if you don't want to wait in line, avoid post club hours as everyone from Marquee just makes there way over to Secret Pizza.",

Yes, it tuck away in a hall way between a restaurant and non-operating glass elevator, and it was a side of a Pinball machine which guided me to the path  of their kitchen.  I'll give this place this much, the sauce and topping was very good, but my crust was very questionable at best for a East coast style Pizza.    The dough toward the middle of the pizza is too thin, and because of this..it was way too soggy from the grease of the cheese, and sausage..    It sagged when they put it back in the oven to reheat for minute, and still sagged when I tried to bite it..    I always felt the pizza dough is the heart of pizza, but for some reason, this didn't work for this slice.   Perhaps, I had a bad pie.  From the past reviews, they have jacked up their prices quite a bit, but If I was jonesing for a slice of Pizza on the strip; I might come back to this place, but remember this, it's a little pricey for what you get.",

The pizza was a little pricey but being in the cosmopolitan it wasn't too bad for a whole pizza at $32 in my opinion, especially since it was pretty big and had I think 5 toppings on it  The pizza tasted great and all the toppings mixed well and it had a lot of cheese which was nice as I hate it when my pizza doesn't have enough cheese. My only complaint is that the pizza is thin crust here and I am not a very big fan of thin crust pizza. But I was still very happy with it as it tasted great, hit the spot, and put a little something in my belly before a night of drinking and raging at marquee",

    "text": "We were wandering The Strip, trying to decide where to go for dinner .We opened Yelp and found that Secret Pizza had good reviews and was located at Cosmo, which was a short walk from where we were. We arrived to find that this place is no secret, as the line was beginning to extend into the long entryway. We figured that must be a good sign, that people must like it enough to wait so long. So, we waited with them. We wound up standing in line for about 40 minutes before it was our turn to order. We got one slice and one beer each. The seating on the inside is limited to a few barstools and a small countertop that wraps the corner. Unfortunately, the counter wasn't very clean. However, the lounge area outside the restaurant was full, so we decided to stick it out. The pizza was decent, but nothing I'd go out of my way for again. It was pretty much your average thin crust pizza, with a too-high price tag. I felt like the hype was out of proportion for the quality and wait time.",

The place definitely has a buzz, because it is secret, because it caters to late night party goers, because everyone is excited to see what comes out of the oven. It's a pick a slice of whatever comes out fresh at the moment.  It's thin crust pizza with your regular cheese, pepperoni, veggie, sausage, etc options. It's a bit pricey with $11 or so for 2 slices. Though, it's fun to be in on a secret. Plus, there is a such an interesting variety of seating choices outside. There is a pool, couches, tables from various other restaurants. It's fun to pick a place to sit.",

It's garlicy, cheesy, and delicious. The dollops of ricotta cheese on it really take the flavor to 11. If you can get a slice of this then I would do so.  Otherwise the pizza is really average, borderline underwhelming. The crust is nothing special at all, and really the pizza amounts to something warm and cheesy to munch on.  If you happen to be in the area, say cruising the shops or gambling nearby, and you want a linner, then you might consider this place. Otherwise it's not worth going out of your way for.",

    "text": "If you're lucky enough for the guy behind the counter to remember your order, then remember to make your pizza after having to remind him twice and then have the time to wait over an hour for you pizza, then you may like this sort of place.  Don't get me wrong - the pizza here is pretty good, but if you come here on a busy night, don't be too shocked if the above scenario happens to you.  After an hour of waiting for my pie, I inquired with the gregarious guy behind the counter (who encouraged me to order a whole pizza in the first place) as to its status.  He then said something to the guy making the pizza, but 15 minutes later, still nothing.  I then decided to cut through the middleman and ask the guy making the pies myself.  I then saw him take a plain cheese that had been sitting out for about 10 minutes and throw some toppings on it and then into the oven.  After waiting for that long, I didn't care that my pizza wasn't even fresh, but the icing on the cake was that they didn't even get my order right.  There was a guy in front of me whose order was messed up too.  Honestly, if I hadn't already paid, I would've left or if I hadn't already left a 20+% tip, I would've left nothing (and I've never left nothing!).  Try to avoid coming here on busy nights.  Otherwise, good luck.",

    "text": "So, finding this place is really a fun adventure in itself.  I sort of like the mysterious theme, and the long walk down a record-cover filled hallway with the lingering smell of fresh pepperoni and mozzarella cheese wafting the whole way.  When you do finally find it, you might notice that the prices are a little absurd for a slice of pizza.  And toppings make it even more.  If you're with a group, and none of you are particularly addicted to meat or veggies, I'd suggest just getting a full cheese pie.  Your wallet will thank you.  Apart from the high prices, the pizza itself is really something special.  I'm originally from the Philadelphia area where, next to cheese steaks and soft pretzels, it's the pizza that we pride ourselves on.  Even in Los Angeles where I live now, I have yet to find a truly comparable pizza place.  But Secret Pizza absolutely delivers on that expectation.  Maybe that's the secret afterall.  In any case, totally worth the price of the pie.  The individual slices are a little small, so I can't say with confidence that if you bought by-the-slice, you'd be satisfied.  But it's definitely a tasty, east-coast-style pizza.  My only other reservation is in regards to the seating area.  There isn't a lot of it.  And if you're not staying in the Cosmo and planning to take the pizza to your room or something, you might be hard-pressed to find a place to rest your bum.",

    "text": "Awesome pizza. I got a slice of white pizza with extra pepperonis on top! They cooked mine a little longer than my friend's (who got the same thing) and mine tasted significantly better because of the extra crunch to the bread and pepperoni. I suggest asking them to keep it in a little longer if they can do that.   Definitely worth the search. The slice is pretty big, so one per person is pretty decent. It isn't too expensive either. If you get one whole box, it is a little cheaper per slice. I suggest getting this if you have a bigger group who doesn't mind getting the same thing. I thought I heard that this place also had a \"sweet\" pizza, but when I got there, there was nothing like that on the menu.  The inside is nice and bright. All the walls were white with some photos hung. There were also two pinball machines inside. Not sure if they were just for decoration or not, but maybe you can check it out when you're there! :]    Overall, the pizza was delicious, inexpensive and totally worth the scavenging. If you really want, you can ask around. There will probably be at least one person or group also trying to find it, or have already found it. If you're really not down for searching, just look at other yelp reviews to help guide the way. (Hint: It'll probably be on your left side! The hall looks pretty dark, and definitely hidden)",

Very basic pizza, tastes good if you're drunk with all that grease. Ate it again when I was sober and found myself not wow'd by the pizza. They don't have Hawaiian pizza. =[ Cousins & I ordered a whole pizza in advance, asking for pepperoni, mushrooms, green peppers, and basil. They gave us a pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms, and olives??? We didn't want to wait any longer to get the right pizza, but come on... but yeah, bottom line, convenient if you're drunk in the middle of the strip and it's late and you want some decent pizza to help sober ya up.",

My goodness, I urge you to go on the treasure hunt to find this place and try one of the best pizzas in the Vegas area. The pizza here is NY style so expect a thin and somewhat crunchy crust. The cheese actually stays on the pizza (when hot) when you take that first bite. Expect long lines pretty much all night long, but it's worth the wait. I advice you to know what to order when it's your turn to order - just to keep the line moving. As of 2/2015, it's still $5 per slice, well worth it.

After a little wandering around I managed to find Secret Pizza's location. It was somewhat of a let down because I didn't really care for their pizza or beer selection. I guess I am not hipster enough for cheap beer in plastic cup. I don't remember exactly what the choices were but it was the mass produced watered down stuff like Bud, Miller, Coors, etc. The pizza itself was pretty greasy and tasted like most (if not all) of the ingredients had come out of a jar or can. Don't get me wrong, it probably would hit the spot after a night clubbing but for a dinner after a long work day it was a big disappointment. On top of that there is not much seating and there were some very loud children playing with the arcade games that are in there. I ended up taking my pizza and plastic cup back to my room and leaving half a slice in the mini fridge when I checked out the next day.",

Yes, Secret Pizza is better than going to Sbarro on the Strip or hitting up whatever other pizza chains are in the area, but that's about it.  I had a pepperoni slice and a mushroom slice, which came out to $10.  It would have been another $3.50 had I gotten a soda, or $5 for a cup of PBR or $6 for a cup of IPA.  The pizza is totally acceptable, but doesn't compare to a place like Hot Lips in Portland, or [insert random place in your neighborhood here].  To be clear, it is better than average, and I have no issues with the overall taste.  It just didn't blow me away.  If you're at the Cosmopolitan or in the area (especially late at night if you're hungry) I would say to stop by if you're in the mood for pizza, but I wouldn't go out of my way walking down the Strip to get here, or get lost inside the Cosmo looking for it.  It's a cool looking joint once you make it inside.  So, Secret Pizza may not be special, but it's definitely \"A-OK.\"",

This place is a hidden gem in the Cosmopolitan for the ones who want to spend less on food. The staff was awesome and friendly and the pizza is greasy and good the flavoring and spices are just right. One of the guys mentioned that the line sometimes goes out the door after walking down the hall to this place i'm like if you are hungry that will be a good amount of wait time for a pizza so plan accordingly i'd probably say your best bet is early lunch time or late night. I will def be back for pizza here again.",

After a late night of partying at Marquee, this place was a lifesaving (literally, I think for some members of my group) late night eating haven.   Talk to me when its not 4am and I haven't been drinking vodka cranberries for hours on end, and I'd probably give the pizza a 2. However, as a late night bite is concerned, the cheesy goodness on the pizza along with the sausage I had on mine, definitely hit the spot and was worth whatever price I paid for a slice. They were really nice and gave me a cup of water for free, because let's be honest, that was needed. My first and only free water in Vegas!   If I find myself in the Cosmopolitan next time I'm in Vegas, I'll head here for a nightcap.",

    "text": "The existence of this place probably went something like this:  John, the 20-something estranged culinary chef protege-dropout, came into the final meeting for the architect's last proposal on the hotel to borrow some cash from his father, Jeff.  Jeff was following the pitch quite well from the design firm, but was starting to drift off.  The architect continued, \"We can probably put a bathroom in here, but it won't be very big.  I propose that we just scrap--\"  An idea hit the little hipster like a flash of lightning.  \"Dad,\" John interrupted.  \"I want a pizza kitchen in there.\"  Jeff: \"Sorry.  But you've never owned a restaurant.  You'll fail.  There's hardly any room.  We can't afford any more signage to get people in there.\"  \"Dad,\" John repeated with a confidence his father had never heard before, \"I want a pizza kitchen in there.  I'll run it.  It will succeed.  It needs nothing but my skill.\"  \"Oooookay, John.  If you say so.\"  And Secret Pizza was born.  --  So we're sitting at a party and it's been a while since I was in the Vegas area and a friend of mine says, \"Have you had Secret Pizza?\"  And I was instantly intrigued.  \"Huh?\"  An hour later, we came up an escalator and found (though no sign, rhyme, or reason pointed to it) a dimly lit hallway.  To my surprise, sure enough, I am greeted with a \"Welcome!\" Welcome to what?  Where am I?  How did the pinball machine get here? How come the arcade machine is broken?  Are we seriously watching the Clippers?  How come I'm asking myself so many questions?  And so we order a pie from the New York accented worker and 20+ minutes later I'm chewing down on the best pizza I've ever had.  I've been to New York.  I've been to Italy.  It could have been the surreal nature of the place's existence, the hype that goes with it, the excitement of finding a hidden treasure - but it was.  the best.  pizza.  We sat and watched people come and go.  Their non-brand Word processed menu was simply titled \"PIZZA\".  Yep.  Looks right, to me.  If I have any friends visiting the area, I'm sending them here.",

I also don't recall what we ordered and how we ordered exactly, but we ended up with a large pie, half mushroom and half pepperoni with extra tomato sauce after flirting with the guy working the sauce station.  After about 15 minutes of waiting (it might have been shorter.  time always seems to go by slower with alcohol) we received our amazing NY style thin crust pizza, which we devoured in under 5 minutes.  Such simple toppings, but it was definitely the best NY style pizza I've ever had, even better than some that I had in New York.  A greasy must-have to sop up all that liquor you just filled up your body with.",

We hadn't seen anything that appealed in Planet Hollywood.  I suggested we step into the Cosmopolitan to see what we could find.    All the restaurants here were more upscale than we were looking for.  We were just about to give up, when I noticed a hall way lined with album covers, and remembered reading about a hidden pizza joint, so I headed down the hall.  Her Majesty thought I was headed to the restroom again.  At the end of the hall you are greeted by a small, brightly lit space lined with white subway tiles. There is a menu board on the wall.  Pizza by the slice, or by the whole pie, sounds like lunch to me!  The pizza is NY style; thin and floppy with a puffy edge.  Very tasty, and reasonably priced considering it's Las Vegas.",

I will keep it in mind for when I am on the Strip and want a slice or two.

Most of the enjoyment for me was knowing that this place is tucked away on a certain floor of the Cosmopolitan with no name, no sign - nothing indicating that it's even there- knowing that made my experience fun.  Having a drunkard unattractive man in a suit telling me and my friends while waiting in line that the pizza isn't good and he found a hair in his pizza and to eat the pizza at our own risk was pretty lame especially since him and his buisness partners left hellah trash everyhwere with not even a single crumb of the so called nasty pizza anywhere. They were seated right near the trash can but sadly were just too darn intoxicated to find the trash can or they were just slobs.  Anyhow, don't be too shocked at the $4.00 price for water - if you ask for a cup they have water in a filtered jug for you. The pizza was good but not the greatest - I still love Settebello!!! But the pizza was still better than many other pizza places. Not cheap but I guess if your comparing the price here to other places in the Cosmo it's most likely the cheapest.  Not many places to sit except for stools - I hate stools only places-  Forget about remembering the Titans - just remeber the short people!!! They do have a Galaga arcade game!!!!  I love Galaga- Wanna challenge??? All in all I wouldn't go out of my way to get pizza here however if I find myself at the Cosmo I wouldn't hestitate to come back here either.",

This is a MUST GO if you like authentic NY style pizza.  Get either the regular slice or the \"white\" pizza. Both are my favorite. The other ones with toppings are just okay... The slices are huge and are 2 are more than enough to fill you up.   I love the fact that this place is small, not overly crowded and the guys behind the counter heat up your slice and hand it to you to eat. It really is that good.  The prices are decent... $5/slice is not horrible.  Just remember... it's on the 3rd Floor fo",

Cheese only is $5 and each additional topping is another $0.50 per topping. Got the slice with three different types of meat. It was pretty good, a tad bit oily though. These pizza slices are New York style. Not bad if you're hungry after going clubbing and want something to eat besides Earls.   I thought the pizza was okay, nothing too special for me. Just thought it was super pricey.",

    "text": "In full disclosure, I'm a sucker for any spots who play the speakeasy card.  So even before my experience here, I was already a huge fan of the Secret Pizza concept.      My friend and I waited in line for about 20 minutes on our visit.  When we reached the front, I was a little surprised at the size of the operation....or rather lack there of.  It's basically all kitchen and just a few seats along a counter and a pinball machine.  No bathrooms.  No nothing.  Just walk up, order, pay, get pizza and that's it.      In other words, don't expect to come here for a leisurely sit-down meal.  Rather it's more take-away style where as the song goes \"you don't have to go home, but you can't stay here\".    I removed one star in my rating, as I really like having the option to sit down and relax for a while.  Rather than just getting the boot after ordering and then having to solve a new problem of being hungry with delicious food in hand, but no where to go.    Luckily, my friend is a rockstar and he found two spots at the counter for us...right next to the pinball game.  Pro Tip: if you unplug the pinball machine, it will no longer play loud annoying music while you're trying to enjoy gourmet pizza.             Like other reviews have mentioned, the quality of Secret Pizza is fantastic.  I'd love to go back to try more of their creations.  This was a fun memorable experience and I'd recommend to anyone with an appreciation for quality pizza and some tolerance for waiting in lines with potentially cramped areas.  i.e.: my father would not like it.  But you're not my father...so go ahead and enjoy!",

They have no signage, but just some awesome records that lead down to this pizza oasis.  I honestly wish I would have eaten here one more time before I left.   They have pizza's that are premade and you can add your topping. I got the Sicilian pizza and added tomatoes and mushrooms to it. They had a white, pepperoni, and cheese option while I was there. I ended up just ordering one pizza and added the magical spices they had on the side. Thankfully someone I was with didn't eat their second slice of pepperoni with green peppers on it, so I got to eat that too. The crust is perfect - not too thin and not too bready. The cheese and sauce were just the right amount and all the toppings were so fresh. The crush was amazing though. I could have eaten that all day.

These pies have all the right ingredients, the crust was perfectly thin, the spice in the sauce was full of flavor and covered the pizza perfectly for both types of pizzas I tried two of the different types of pizza both wonderful! It was the white pizza ricotta and mozzarella and a deluxe pizza with all of the meats (pepperoni, sausage, green and red bell pepper with mushroom and olives. Both were absolutely delicious and satisfying.    The beer selection was slim but tasty. I was very happy that they had Shock Top.   I highly recommend anyone to stop at this place.",

After my many vegas years, I don't know how many times secret pizza was a godsend after leaving marquee.  I met so many random strangers in the long hallway full of old records and it always went by fairly quickly.    I typically get the white pizza, but will usually just get whatever they have leftover.  I've never custom ordered a while pie, cuz that would take too much time and I'm not a patient person, especially when drunk.   They have plenty of condiments for you to use, but very limited seating... Id recommend getting your food and if you can't find any set as inside, sit on the leather chairs outside.   They have a growing wall of dollar bills, i'm not sure I'd they'll add more to the collection, but it's intersting to see how come people would donate a 100 dollar bill to write a few notes on it...",

A couple of months ago, a church member of mine told me that I HAD to get Secret pizza when I came here. My honest opinion: I could've saved my money.  It's over priced and overrated. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't taste bad, but it wasn't out of this world fantastic like people make it seem. I texted my sister, who was here last month and didn't get to try it, that it reminded me of the pizza you get just because it's available late at night and you're hung over. Most food is good when you're hung over. I've had some good, even great pizza in my life, and on a scale of 1 to 5, I honestly give this place a 3 based on taste.  Maybe I missed something, but I was disappointed. I had the white pizza as a slice of the sicilian pizza. It was average.",

I got the pepperoni pizza and the white pizza just for the heck of it... and at $5 a slice... it was pretty cheap because the slices are huge!   The pepperoni was good... but really, for me, nothing to dance about! Granted I've never been to New York (YET) so I can't compare... but it really didn't do anything for me. I had a bite of the white pizza but threw it away... it tasted... off... for lack of a better word. :( Wish I could give this place more stars s but I just can't... I'll have to swing over to Earl of Sandwich (which I never got to try) next time!  Oh... and the cashier (skinny tall blonde)... needs to work on her customer service skills!",

No.  *Fast and efficient?  Yes.  Classy?  No (red cups, Pabst Blue Ribbon, boxed wine).  Friendly?  Yes.  Relatively cheap?  Yes.  If you have trouble finding it, take the escalators to the 3rd floor and ask any of the neighboring establishments and they'll point you in the right direction.  Manufactured aura aside, the NY style pizza is one of the best I had.  In fact, buddies and I came here on 3 different occasions within a span of 12 hours.  Slices are served scorching hot so be prepared to scrape the roof of your mouth if you're famished and can't wait.  Trust me, well worth the 2nd degree burns.    *If you don't want to wait more than 15 minutes, pick from the selection there or call ahead and order a whole pie.  Counters only, no seats but plush love seats are available about 15 yards away.",

Ironically, when you get off the plane, and advise your Taxidriver not to take the long route to your destination (as all Cabi's internationally always try and do) all you can think of is not the clubs, not the restaurants, not the shows,  just the Pizza at Cosmo.  When you select your hotel, close enough to make it an easy walk to Cosmo Pizza, thats dedication.  Cozy simplicity and always good eats.    The hotel sadly, a gamble by the Germans, is not built to last.  It reminds you of a - of - a mall. Kiddie corner from this Pizzaria is where all the action is.  A few interesting restaurants, not your usual fare.",

Their sausage and peperoncini slice was delicious.  The sourness of the pepper cut the savory sausage - a winning combination!  The thin crust is so crunchy and has a nice bite as well.  Enjoy!",

But not anything out of the ordinary. We came here for a quick lunch before starting the day (around 1pm - Good Morning, Las Vegas), so there wasn't too much of a line. Took 20 mins to get a mushroom pizza. It was a normal pizza - nothing to complain about. I think the appeal of the place is mostly its secrecy and the fact that it's conveniently located/open to service the drunchie-driven crowd pouring out of Marquee during the wee hours of the morning.  If you get a single slice at $3, it's a pretty expensive piece of pizza. However, the large pizza was split among 6 girls and came out to about about $2.50 each. They had told us the pizza was 12 slices so we expected 2/person, but there ended up being 9 huge slices. Maybe someone cut it wrong? In any case, we ended up with one and a half big slices per person.",

That accompanied with pictures from yelp and knowing it was down a long corridor I was able to find it... after the many beautiful distractions that the Cosmo has to offer.   It was a fun little adventure to try finding the place. The pizza was in a better version of pizza I've had before, but not drool worthy. The experience as a whole is what made it worthwhile.  Oh and the old school pinball machines and galaga game totally helped keep up the fun factor.  Definitely recommend trying to find it all on your own.

This is right there with it as far as the dough and sauce combination if you ask me for pizza.   Granted, the majority of folks at 2am are probably just as buzzed as we were coming from the nearby clubs in the Cosmo, but that didn't stop me from walking to this spot & ordering 2 slices. The only thing that messed up my pizza was me. I thought I grabbed the parmesan cheese shaker and instead grabbed the garlic one. If you know about parmesan shakers, you're aware it takes some serious shakes to get it going... not the case with garlic. No worries, I used the napkins to get most of it up and downed them both. I wasn't a big fan of the red cups for fountain drinks but I should have asked about a refill (not sure if they do them or not) but you gotta head out into the atrium to grab a nearby custom wood-worked table to park your rear & enjoy.",

Once we found the location (which was fun in of itself) we walked into the hallway filled with old records and smelled a slightly strong garlic smell. The line was not bad (Saturday Afternoon) the staff was so polite and cool and although the space was small the pizza was well worth it. Especially the pepperoni. All in all a great experience.",

The pizza portions were huge and the white pizza was not shy of cheese including ricotta which is one of my faves.

There's no sign, and it's not on the website or maps anywhere. Once you find it though, you're in for a treat.  The place has a great vibe- retro pinball and arcade games line the back wall, sodas and beer are served in red solo cups, and the staff is warm and friendly.  The pizzas are hand-tossed, crispy thin-crust style served in slices fat enough to fold in half- the perfect New York style pizza that I absolutely love. Ordering's confusingly easy- you walk up to the counter, see what's available by the slice, and pick. Or- you order a whole pie. Best of all, prices are around $5 a slice. You can buy yourself and 4 friends dinner for the cost of one hand at Blackjack downstairs!  As a bonus, they open till 4 or 5am, so drunk eating's definitely not frowned upon here. So go, and don't tell anyone about this place. It'll be our secret.",

There's only one other I find is just a bit better due to greater convenience, time of service, and price that's 15 minutes off the strip (check out my review on Mama Depalma's pizza & bistro) but if you're on the strip you won't find any better! Their pizza is thin crusted served hot and has the allure of being tucked away down an unmarked hallway on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan casino. You'll know you're at the right place though when you see dozens of album covers and a long line of people waiting to pay top dollar to see what all the buzz is about. It's a unique Vegas story you can tell your friends about and the well seasoned and in my opinion just amount of oily pizza is just as good of an experience. Be willing to spend 30 minutes at least getting to it and waiting in line and around 4-5$ a slice to enjoy it :) Vegas specialities on the strip come with a price!",

    "text": "So I used to be obsessed with the white pizza here and made sure every trip we would make it a point to go eat here but in all honesty this time around disappointed me. It was nothing special anymore. I feel like ever since the secret has been reviled so did the amazing pizza. I can make better pizza at home. The crust was bland in comparison. They need to possibly oil their crust in my opinion. I give them a solid 4 stars because although I'm complaining I want to make it a point to say they are still good pizza but the price you are paying it should be greeeeeeat pizza lol",

The place is very hard to find and I actually had to call them up to see where they're at.  Once there, it's a lot smaller than I thought it would be.  It suits much better for to go than to eat in.  I ordered plain cheese and a sausage.  Both are very good and comparable to NYC pizza.    As for price, well, you are inside Cosmo and will pay the price for that.  If you want cheaper, you need to eat away from the strip.",

This pizzeria is really cool, it is hidden on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan, there's no sign or anything, just a long hallway that leads to pizza heaven.   They sell the pizza by the slice or you can buy a whole, there is a couple of beers on tap as well. Slices are decently sized and thin and very good. I was going to get a regular pepperoni pizza, however I was quite intrigued when I saw the ricotta cheese pizza. I wasn't sure if I would like the taste, so one of the employees was kind enough to let me try some of the ricotta to make sure that I would enjoy my slice of pizza. After trying the cheese and discovering how delicious it was I decided to give it a shot. I ordered a Pabst Blue Ribbon and a slice of the ricotta pizza, pizza and beer is always a good combo and the pizza did not disappoint. There is a counter, some seats, a couple arcades and televisions to keep up on the sports.   Overall this a good place to stop by for a quick eat, and something very affordable without emptying your wallet like so many places in Vegas will leave you.",

There are 10 slices to the pie, and it comfortably fed myself and 3 of my family members.   30 bucks for a dinner for 4? I dare you to find that anywhere else on the strip.   What's more is we enjoyed playing ms. Pacman and their pinball machines while we waited! The lack of seating is a bummer, but we got the only 4 chairs in the place so we were fine.

We weren't incredibly hungry after a gluttonous meal and a whole bottle of wine, but I was intent on trying the pizza again after so long. I never go to Cosmo very often, so figured I'd take advantage. We ordered a slice of white pizza to share and some beer. Feeling tipsy, this pizza really hit the spot. We both enjoyed the flavors, although it was a little dry for my taste. I usually really enjoy pizza crust but I skipped eating this one because it wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked.

    "text": "The New York in me loves Secret Pizza. It really does. It's probably the closest I'll get to having a NY slice (that doesn't mean that their pizza is spot on though!)  Why 3 stars then? Well, I went on a Tuesday at around 1:45 in the morning and stood in line for 30minutes. Not too shabby. I wouldn't say that they were extremely busy and they seemed to be well staffed too. Thing is, it was DIRTY. The parmesan, oregano, chili flakes and garlic powder was scattered all over their counter tops as if they were having a party. I don't mind dirty when you're slammed and short staffed but there was absolutely no excuse for dirtiness that night. Especially since there was an employee stuck to her phone in the corner. She didn't even TRY to crouch down so that no one could see her.   Not to mention the fact that the guys there didn't seem too enthusiastic about being there. I know that I wouldn't want to be at work at that time in the morning but, come on. At least be a little pleasant? Anyway, if I didn't have to consider their employees they would've been a solid 4 and a half stars.  Don't let my review scare you though. Pizza dough was crisp and the small burns that it had was still enjoyable. There was a good amount of cheese and, was perfectly melted. Pepperoni had that juicy yet still crispy feel. Their Blanca slice was OK. Nothing too special but you definitely see and taste the ricotta.   I would definitely go back since the pizza's great. I just hope they step up their customer service.",

There's always people in line and that's understandable because the kitchen is so small and there are only 4 workers.

I would say call in the order but we tried calling in our order and the phone kept ringing and ringing. Going in person though is much better. While you're waiting in line u can strike up random conversations with people all standing in line for the same thing...PIZZA!!!!!

Inside this secret pizza joint it's super tiny, they had maybe 4 chairs to eat at the Counter, but other then that it was filthy, counters were gross, beer spilled everywhere, looks as if they hadn't cleaned it since the night. We decided to eat outside on the couches which seemed a little more clean.   Wait time for pizza wasn't too bad. They said about 30 min, came out in 15-20 so that's a plus. We had the plainest pizza ever lol, pepperoni and olives. Yeah next time Ima order something out of this world! But the pizza was good wasn't dry, it reminded me of bostons or something. Anywho, secret pizza I'll be back for you.",

On a recent bachelorette trip my friends and I decided to make it our personal mission to find this secretive pizza joint after hearing about it from the bride's fiance. We navigated the area based on some Yelp photos and were actually very closeby when we got \"lost\". Imagine our excitement when we found THE HALLWAY!! We decided to each get 2 humongous slices of the pre made combination, pepperoni, and cheese toppings.  -The cheese was very tasty with a slightly thin crispy crust. It was indeed pizza heaven for us UNTIL we decided to sprinkle too much parmesan...making the sodium level skyrocket and our mouths dry as a desert on our drive home to LA...hence my minus one star. -The combination was pretty decent but nothing too special topped with big slices of sun dried tomato, bell pepper, olives, onions.  At $5-6 a slice its really not too bad so it'll be fun to bring along new people as a little joke.",

Tucked next to Jaleo on the 2nd floor of the Cosmo, it's really not that hard to find, unless, I guess if you are super drunk. But there was a pretty decent line for this Secret pizza place, reminds me of the lines at the jumbo slice places back here in DC after a night of partying, but no one really minded the wait with the main prizes on their mind and taste buds.  The pizza itself? I thought it was great, I mean I blinked and it was gone. Maybe it was the fact that I was starving and had a few drinks, but I remember it having a distinct taste, nice and soft, not too soft or floppy, freshly baked dough and crusts and a good helping of toppings on each slice. I got two slices; one white pizza with cheese and ricotta cheese and a second slice with mushroom and pepperoni and they sure did the job.    Prices were standard for Vegas ($5-$6 a slice I think).   All in all, Secret Pizza lived up to my hype, I would definitely come back here when I am back in the area and recommend it to any pizza lover, especially for later in the night.",

After waiting in line for about 40 min, we ordered:  2 litter of soda: $8 2 topping pizza (sliced sausage and pepperoni): $31   They said our wait time was going to be 25min. It took about 15 min so we were very pleased with that.   We took it back to our hotel room to eat it. Pizza was still hot. Getting the sliced sausage was definitely worth it. It added some zest to a basic pepperoni pizza.   Definitely recommend getting a whole pizza over slices. More bang for your buck.",

The cheese was lacking and was nothing out of the ordinary, the staff was somewhat rude (just stared at us when we walked up to order and was not engaging), and the price for what you get was pretty high. I'm not a fan of thin crust (and didn't know that's how it was), but the crust was not crispy on the bottom like most thin crusts, giving us really floppy pizza slices, so the cheese slid off trying to pick them up. Watch out for the grease, too. At least it was prepared and baked quickly.   I get that hotel/casino restaurants run that sort of price, but for the quality and amount of food, we should have just looked off the strip for a better pizza place.",

    "text": "Ate here twice this past weekend - it was easy to find thanks to the reviewer who said to make a hairpin turn right off the elevator near the Chandelier Bar.  If you go at night, take the elevator instead of the escalators so you don't have to wade through the ridiculous crowds waiting to get into Marquee!  Go down the dark, narrow hallway that's completely lined with picture frames...if you get off the elevator, the hallway is immediately on your right, probably less than 10 feet away.  If you pass a restaurant with a row of sushi chefs wearing little white hats, you've missed it!  Turn around!!  Looking at the menu pix that other reviewers have taken, prices have gone up a bit.  They start at $3.25 for a simple cheese slice and up to $4.75 for a combo slice ($0.50 for each additional topping).  Full pies range from $18.50 to $28.00 ($2.25 for each additional topping).  The pizza was delicious - large, flavorful, NY-style thin-crust slices.  If you're picky about grease...just blot it off with a napkin.  They have glass shakers of oregano, red pepper flakes, parmesan cheese and garlic salt on the counters that line the walls.    My fave was the white pizza w/ fluffy, soft ricotta & mozzarella cheese, second fave was the pepperoni & meatball.  Sausage & pepperoni was delicious as well...the only one that was kind of meh was one with pepperoni and green peppers (possibly because I'm anti-green peppers?  I thought they were thinly sliced jalapenos!).    Their drinks are a bit pricey - $3.25 for a red plastic cup of soda!  It was freaking hot outside the second night we went though, so I sprung for a cup of root beer.  Take advantage of the free refills!",

    "text": "PIZZA.  The greasy kind. The hot and cheesy kind. The nothing special kind.   This is it.   I managed to end up here for dinner not once but TWICE on my recent Vegas vacation, and we were only there for four evenings total.  The night we arrived our flight had been delayed a couple of ours. It was 3 AM our time and we were tired, groggy, and didn't feel like making an adventure to anywhere for dinner. Secret pizza seemed like a good solution. It was actually pretty easy to find- the hallway with album covers leads you to the pizza. I had a slice of sicilian and my boyfriend had a slice of the meatball & pepperoni. Total cost for the two of us was $14 - considering most dinners in Vegas start at around $20 a person, this is a good deal! There was no line when we went. The pizza itself was nothing special. I would say it probably tops Sbarro but wouldn't go far beyond that.  The guys serving the pizza were really nice too- so thumbs up for that.  Then another night, we were all very drunk by around 9pm because we had been KILLING it at a craps table and hey...they kept bringing us drinks. We were definitely in no condition to survive a meal at a regular restaurant without knocking over a few glasses or napping at the table. So secret pizza it was. We stumbled there from the casino- luckily it was just a short escalator ride. My very drunk friend was VERY excited about the fact that they had mushroom pizza on deck. I think I got a slice of cheese but can't remember exactly....I remember just looking at all the options and pointing at the one that looked most delicious. I have no clue what my boyfriend got that night but I think he got just one slice. I paid...drunkenly, because I found the receipt the next morning. It was just over $20 for our three slices. I actually don't remember eating the pizza that night.  So I think what we can say from this experience is that the pizza wasn't spit-it-out terrible nor was it moaning-worthy good. It satisfied my need for non-liquid calories and  that's about it.   This place gets 4 stars because it serves a need that was not previously met on other visits to Vegas. I'm pretty sure the servers at Jaleo are counting their lucky stars this place exists right next door and they don't have to serve all those drunken people. It's nice to have a place to grab a quick bite and a decent price (compared to other Vegas places).   Long live Secret Pizza!",

Perhaps Slightly Hidden Pizza, or No Signage Pizza - that last one begs to be said while touching your thumb and forefinger together and shaking them as you say the name in your best Italian accent.  Other names come to mind:   1) Tasty Pizza. Full of garlic and cheese, this name is far more apt than \"Secret\".  2) Food and Drinks for Two for $19.50 Pizza. A big mouthful for sure, but so are their slices.  3) Opens at 11am Pizza. It's pretty popular with the late night crowd, but at 11am we had the whole joint to ourselves. I'm guessing all the 3am pizza eaters are still sleeping at this hour.  4) Near a Pool Table Pizza. There is a pool table out front. Nobody kicked us out, or charged us a penny for shooting a game of pool while we waited for Secret Pizza to open, so we shot a game of pool on the most entertaining landmark you will see on your way to the best pizza on the strip.  5) 4.5 Star Pizza. I'm really stingy with my 5th star. If it wasn't for a Pizza I had in New York this would be a 5, but once you've had the best, all other pizzas just try to mimic them. Still, I'm teetering on the 5th star. I will definitely come back - this is research worth doing!",

    "text": "I heard great things about this place from a friend, but was greatly disappointed.  I went here with a group of 12 people.  The place was easy to find since there was a long line and I think the hidden door was open.  The place was fairly small with not much dining area.  We divided into three groups to order three different pizza.  We received our first two pizzas in around 30 minutes, which was fine.  The pizza was  mediocre.  They were fairly large and soggy in the middle area of the pizza.  I was content.  Our issue with this restaurant was our third pizza.  The first two we received in a timely manner, but not so much with our third.  I sensed a problem when people after us were receiving their orders before we did.  I checked with the cashier and he said, it's coming.  About 12 mins later, I checked the status and another employee said, it's the next one out.  About an hours, 8 people in our group finished their pizzas and 4 remaining were still patiently waiting and were starving.  I was worried about them and ascertain the status.  I talked to the same person who said it was the next one out and she said it's coming out.  I was having a bit of an argument with her because she lied and was making excuses of it being busy.  I found out later that they broke the pizza as it was completed, so they had to make a new pizza and we had to wait double for it to finish.  All they had to do is tell me that they were sorry and it will take longer because it broke.  I was not notified and they tried to sweep it under the rug.  I detest liars.  This was unacceptable and very unprofessional.  I asked for a refund and it took a long time for the manager to come out.  We paid cash and just needed cash back, I don't think we had to wait that long for a refund.  Such a waste of time and this place is so overrated.    In summary, greatly disappointed from a bad experience.  They lied.  I had better pizzas and am not impressed.  I will not return.",

    "text": "Heard about this place from a co-worker and decided to track it down during a trip to Vegas. You'll find the unmarked hallway in the back of the restaurant area on the third floor. Check down the hall and you'll see it's lined with old record album covers, finished with a pinball machine. Make your way down and the smell starts to put a smile on your face.  Great recipe creations, I love pepperonis but decided to go for a sausage and pepperchinis slice, what an excellent decision. If I wasn't so lactose intolerant (thank you lactaid pills for allowing me to eat this slice of pizza) then I would have had another two or three pieces. I happened to run into my cousin on my Vegas trip and showed him the restaurant after he'd told me he'd never heard of it.   If you're looking for a quick lunch or delicious late-night snack, look no further than Secret Pizza, you'll be thrilled to have an inexpensive, delicious meal",

The toppings are just oozing with perfection, and the crust is really gives this ol' pie some bite.  Just the right amount of crunch!  You've got to try this place whenever you're in town.

Grab a slice and go sit by STK and people watch...if you can remember what happened it's usually some pretty good people watching at that time of the early morning.

Definitely worth a try even at $4.50-$5 a slice.  Service: 2 Stars. Guy in the (SF) baseball cap was quite rude. I get that this place is not really a secret now and they probably get tons of business from foodies and Marquee club goers. However, good service goes a long way and this time around, the bad service prompted me to decline my second order on my second trip.  Secret pizza is definitely not the only pizza game in town.",

    "text": "I'm super sad to report that my experience at Secret Pizza was pretty mediocre. In fact, the 3rd star is because the price was cheap compared to most other food places found on the strip.   Located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo next to the pool table, Secret Pizza is not only making some serious dough (in both senses of the term), but is also quite a bit of a wait at any time during the day. Three of us opted instead to get a whole pizza (some sort of supreme concoction) and a slice of the square cheese pizza (CHZ). The cheese square was basically cheese bread; delicious, but when was the combination of cheese and bread ever a bad idea. We got our pizza a few moments later and decided to eat it right outside in front of the pool table. We ended up only being able to eat one slice/ea because they were so massive (except for the guy in our group who ate 2) and took the other half back with us to feed the rest of the  crowd we were with. The pizza was super salty (from the sausage topping, I think), super oily (BARELY saved my clothes from a stain of a lifetime!), and the crust was pretty dry.   Overall, the pizza's just aight. Cheap, efficient, but nothing special.",

If you're coming up the escalators, it'll be almost directly in front of you.  I've had their pizza a handful of times and have always enjoyed it. Today was no exception. I went with something simple: Their white pie (garlic sauce and healthy chunks of ricotta cheese) with sundried tomatoes. Deeee-licious! Their crust is fantastic (LOVE thin crust). Now, it's not my absolute favorite white sauce, but it's still damn good. And if you're not a white sauce fan, their red sauce is fabulous too. Also, if you're not on the go or in a hurry, get the whole pie and take it home! Worth the savings (a slice of white pie is $5 compared to a whole white pie for $30). Oh, but pass on the fountain drink though; it's a red Solo cup for four bucks. Yikes.",

    "text": "After years of clubbing at Marquee and having Secret Pizza bookmarked, I finally got the chance to eat here during my last Vegas trip in October. We'd gotten our stamps at Marquee and with re-entry privileges, we decided we didn't want to wait in the club for Porter Robinson to go on and should grab some food 'cause we were starving.  The entrance of Secret Pizza is through a tiny hallway on the 3rd level of Cosmopolitan, in between this restaurant and elevator outside the Marquee ticket holder entrance and re-entry line. There was a short line at 11:30 pm, which moved quickly. I got a slice of NY-style Cheese and Craig P. went with a slice of deep dish. Tasty and pretty standard in terms of what you'd expect. Way later in the evening (morning?), some of my friends brought back an entire Secret pizza to the hotel for some amazing drunchies. Cold, but still very good!  There's no seating, only standing room with counter tops along the wall for you to stuff your face. However, you can eat in the resting area right outside; there are plenty of sofas and chairs, as well as a free pool table.  Great option if you're clubbing and hungry during or after.",

    "text": "Ended up making a few stops at Secret Pizza on our most recent Vegas trip. It is truly a one-of-a-kind spot in Vegas. A hole in the wall pizza counter in a chic, upscale hotel with no advertising or signage anywhere on the property, that provides a relatively quick and affordable (by Vegas standards) lunch or snack. You could easily walk right by without knowing it's there....secret! They typically have 4 or 5 pizzas to choose your slice from ($6/slice) or you can order a whole pizza.  There are only a few counter seats, so most people take it out in the seating area on the 3rd floor or back to your room.  I tried a variety of the slices during my stay, but the simple white pizza slice was the best, which was topped with a healthy amount of garlic, olive oil and cheese. The meatball slices on the meatball pizza are full of flavor.  Only minor challenge with this spot would be if you showed up when they were really busy. They aren't the most efficient at the counter, so I could imagine there are some long waits to order and get your food when busy.  It's definitely worth a try if you are in the area and need a snack/lunch and don't want to spend $30+ per person.",

It's down this remote corridor with no signage or anything. There was also a bit of a line, but boy the pizza was worth every minute of the wait.  The slices are a decent size and the flavor is awesome. the crust is beautifully crispy. I would eat the crust by itself as a loaf of bread. That's the secret to an awesome pizza in the first place. Add to that flavorful fresh ingredients and you have a winner.  Just an FYI - don't expect a restaurant type setting. There are a couple of bar stools, but basically it's a take it to go type of place. Again, the win is in the food itself. Really good.  I highly recommend Secret Pizza to anyone visiting the Vegas Strip.",

Favorites include cheese, pepperoni, and sausage. The line can get REALLY long. Like 20 people in front if you long, so be ready to deal with that. There are a few barstools and chairs to eat inside the place, but I like bringing it out and sitting in the lounge area the Cosmo hotels provide. If you have an extra dollar to spare you can add it to the wall where people leave messages on money and mark your trip.",

We asked the manager about it and he told us it started out as a small kitchen just to provide room service, but just before they opened, they decided to open it to walk ins, but made the choice not to advertise or market it. They're doing $5 million/year now. Pretty good for no marketing.....

While it's not really a secret, I still felt cool locating the unassuming (who am I kidding, it's covered with album covers) hallway and emerging in a cozy little pizza parlor on the other side.  Kind of like Alice in Wonderland.  Usually I can finish 2 slices of pizza without a problem, so I ordered 2 this time.  They were huge! I was stuffed halfway through the second one.  The pizza was very good, not mind-blowingly good but still crisp and fresh (don't let them give you a reheated slice, there were pizzas that were pre-made and just waiting to be reheated), very welcome especially in the AM.    Slight Cons:  Workers were not very enthusiastic while taking my order, and there is nowhere to sit, you'll just have to take it to the couches outside or elsewhere.

    "text": "Hell yea.. I love strategic deconditioning stage, but man I've been taking this too far. 6 slices later and i feel sick again, but in a good way i guess.  I rounded up some troopers to on embark on a journey with me to pop my Cosmopolitan cherry one late night, but really i just wanted to get my pizza on since i was having mad fat man-i-tis cravings.  After searching throughout the casino we finally made it to the our destination and the people here are very inviting. *Hint* Look for a pinball machine at the of a hallway.    The register lady claimed that their White Pizza is their 'bread and butter': Ricotta, mozzarella cheese, parmesan, garlic, basil, oregano, and NO sauce.  You have the option to top it off with slice tomatoes an alternative for a sauce which is highly recommended by Nico, our pizza guy.  The tomatoes helps brings out the flavor of the White Pizza more and are place on after the pizza is removed from the oven.  This is a little different from the norm, so I didn't want to fully commit.   Nico overheard our dilemma and normally he wouldn't do this for anyone, but for us he was more than happy to modify our pizza. . Half White, half Pepperoni and Sausage.  Score!   My first slice i was in loved, but after my second i thought it was too much of the same dry cheese ricotta taste.  It was good, but i wouldn't be too quick to go back for 3rds.  The sausage and pepperoni pizza were freakin' good.   The slice sausage and pepperoni has a greater caliber than your typical pizza joint.  The oil from the cheese and pepperoni goes so well with that lightly burnt crust, and the sausage had a nice bite to it.  I saved one of these for my last slice ;P  You can ordered by the slice which they will reheat one of the premade one or you can be fatties like us an order a whole pie.  Takes about 15min.  Fun little inexpensive adventure if you're looking for something to do late night.  Not much seating inside, but outside the hallways there are plenty.   *Useless fact* 1942 does not move diagonal.",

I don't think you can go wrong with any pizza here especially if you are buzz. The pizza costs $5 per slice and it's worth it!  There were plenty of seating and  a big lounge area outside of the parlor. If Marquee is not popping, the wait is minimal and you can feel a bit more relax while scarfing down the slices. If it is, be ready to wait a bit!  There's no signage so look for a hallway covered with records!",

You should be able to find it after leaving the Marquee nightclub. There's no signs for it. Only a weird walkway with vintage images on the wall. The great thing is the cool factor about asking around to find this place. The adventure and finding your treasure makes it awesome!   The pizza here is okay. It looks similiar to a NY thin slice pizza.. Only it doesn't taste as good. If your drunk then this thing is amazing. I had the white pizza. It had a lot of garlic and a bold cheese taste. It was a little too greasy but hey it's pizza.. so why am I even complaining...I would definitely eat this again when I'm looking for a slice of pizza. It's not expensive and probably the cheapest thing to buy inside the Cosmopolitan.",

So maybe it isn't \"hidden\" anymore, but it is still a gem. We ordered a whole pizza to go (pepperoni and green pepper), waited about 20 minutes, then took our whole pizza over to the Chandelier Bar and enjoyed. I have to say, even if I hadn't been tipsy, this pizza is legit. Thin crust, but not too \"floppy,\" flavorful crust (hard to find on thin crust pizzas), and the toppings were fresh and tasty. I was certainly pleased enough to write this review and give the pizza 4 stars, so there you go.",

I remember this place being the BEST but I am now convinced that it had to be the fact that I was completely wasted every time. We waited in a huge line that moved so incredibly slow. I'd assume most people are getting slices so I have no idea what the hold up was, we must've waited 30 minutes. Once we finally got up to order there was about five slice options. I got pepperoni and it is a decent sized slice. The price for all slices is 5.50$ o believe which is an ok price for an on the strip property. Their Parmesan and pepper shakes sucked and you literally can shake them for hours with barely any reward. The people watching can be funny or annoying, probably less annoying the more you drink. This place is TINY and there is no sign for it so you kind of have to know where it is. There is also no seating inside but right outside the hall there is a seating area (pretty crowded). Overall ok place for cheaper? drunk food, but there's definitely bette pizza in town.",

Katie B. took the words right out of my mouth because the best part of this place is watching and talking to the inebriated individuals that have no clue what they're saying while bumping into you left and right. Entertaining? I think so. I seriously think having such a narrow and long hallway for waiting in line isn't because they want people to feel claustrophobic, it's because they want to make it easy for the confused drunk people to stand in line. Don't expect to eat inside, there are like four chairs and people standing everywhere waiting for their pizza. We tried the white pizza with ricotta and the peppers pizza. Both were delicious, but I had to remove the layer of oil sitting on the pizza. Come here for a good time and satisfy your pizza cravings while you're at it!",

Being in Vegas where the night life is always on point, after all that drinking and walking around a nice greasy, yummy pizza, will kill a hangover any day!!! I don't know I am pretty noisy and noticed a line outside of the Cosmopolitan and wanted to know what everyone was in line for. So my crazy nosy self-got in line too!! I didn't even know what I was in line for, I just knew I wanted some too, lol. As my man and I continued to walk further and further inside of the place, I begin to smell the oregano, sauce, cheese, sausage and everything else that goes on a pie! I was in love by the first scent.  We finally got to the front and ordered four slices (2 each) and a coke. Oh my, we should have ordered a whole pie!! It was good, fresh and straight to the point if you are into a classic New York Style pizza. The customer service was on point too. Everyone there was nice, and upbeat! I love love love this place and I am happy it's a secret. Let's keep this gem a secret, everything that is a secret is always good!!!",

I'm sure Grimaldi's, which is in New York and fantastic I might add, would be less than happy if I, or let's just say someone I knew, stumbled in and wished to settle my debt for the food ordered with a fistful of one dollar casino chips. Secret Pizza, on the other hand, is properly trained and equipped to deal with these \"free-spirited\" individuals.  Here's some questions one might have, that I will in part answer with questions: 1. Would I take my sons and daughters here for pizza night?  Do you think it's still safe to leave your kids alone at Circus Circus with a sackful of quarters like your parents did when you were young? Do you live in Vegas? Why are your kids here? 2. Should I bring Meemaw for a nice casual sit down dinner? Did Meemaw have mommy when she was 15? Is her sunrise tattoo on her lower back, now a sunset? Is she currently stumbling in her high heels after having spent the last 5 hrs inside Marquee living her missed youth?  White Pizza; That's all.",

Doughy crust, cheesy goodness, thin crusted on the bottom - what more do you want? Grab lots of napkins and fold in half for ultimate nomz.

The pizza dough is ultra thin, and the combination of cheesy goodness and tangy tomato sauce makes this pizza mouthwateringly great!    I usually get the pepperoni.  It's a oldie but a classic!

We had walked by it like at least 30 times!  It's great for late night or a quick bite. The pizza is super tasty and reminds me of grabbing a slice in NYC. They generally always seem to have margherita pizza, a white pizza (mozzarella, ricotta, garlic, spinach), pepperoni slices, and pepperoni and meatball slices.   It is a bit pricey for a slice, but that's to be expected in Vegas and especially in the Cosmopolitan.   Like all great pizza places, the line is out the door once the clubs let out.",

We had passed by this obscure corridor a few times and had no idea that was the entrance to Secret Pizza.  Well I guess that's the secret.  Try finding this place at about 2 am is a lot easier, there are tons of post night clubbers, or other late night eaters trying to get their grub on.  You'll most likely see a line into the hall or at least bunches of people scarfing down pizza near the entrance.  As for the the pizza,  it's not like there are crazy weird toppings or anything.  It's just a plain and simple good pizza.  They are constantly baking them so they are coming out hot a fresh.  They are just under $5 a slice, which may seem like a lot, but they are large like Sbarro, but wayyyy better.  Keep in mind you are on the strip trying to get food.  They also sell beer on tap and soda too!  I love the white pizza, but I usually select whatever just came out of the oven, and haven't been disappointed yet.    Overall, it is something to experience once.  You feel like you a part of a secret club, secret pizza club that is.  I can almost guarantee that after trying it once you'll be back again.",

A slice of pizza is about $8 from what I remember ( hey it was 1 am lol). Oh... they open really late and for being in vegas... it's a hugeeee plus !

I'm not about out to drive onto the strip and deal with that madness for a slice of warmed up Pizza. So... Now I have snacks for the rest of our road trip.   Bonus: they allow half and half. As a pescatarian wife of a meat devouring Husband, we usually have to order way too much food to accommodate both our tastes.  We did half white and half sausage/pep and the White was SO GOOD!! The garlic is divine.  Husband was pleased with his half too. And yes as others have said, it's greasy. ITS PIZZA!",

All were amazing. I think the best though might have been the cheese. Flavor was great, greasy thin crust goodness. And I'm normally a deep dish girl.   I brought 4 others with me and they all LOVED it. One actually got back in line for a third... And a canolli! normally I'm not a cannoli fan, but this one had super thick cream, almost a cheesecake consistency... Pretty good. But come for the pizza!  Love this place!

Now, I don't mind a long line, as long as it keeps moving. We stood for probably 5-10 minutes without moving, so we went elsewhere.  Strictly speaking in terms of the food, it's great. Although, it's not so secret any longer, and it didn't seem like the staff is accustomed to working with a large crowd.",

Even the white pie is the best I have ever had, and I'm not the biggest fan of white pies.  The wait can be long at late night drunk hour so go during the day when it's slow.  The price is cheap when you consider a vodka soda and a bag of chips costs you 15 dollars in Vegas.  Look at the menus posted on the restaurants that surround Cosmo pizza and find something you ate at one of these places that was any better at any price.  Sometimes the best food is cheap.  This is one of those times.  If you enjoy good food, you must go here.",

    "text": "I think I'm giving this place 3 stars because I was very dissatisfied with the fact that the veggie pizza that I had ordered did not includeThe onions and the tomatoes that were on display on the pizza in the window. I specifically ordered an entire pie with pepperoni, with half of the pie as a veggie and pepperoni pizza. All I got was bell peppers, mushrooms, and olives. Tomatoes and onions are nowhere to be found. So I'm a bit confused as to why it was made the way it was. I also didn't notice the lack of ingredients until I was in my room and honestly too hungry to go back down and complain.  The pizza itself was okay, crust was nice and thin, but I would've appreciated more sauce. It was a bit too salty for me and I did notice that there was a lot of grease even though there wasn't very much cheese. Honestly for $36 I feel like I was overcharged, but hey it's Las Vegas and those are the prices you can expect to pay on the strip. As a local, I feel like there are other places around Las Vegas that have better pizza.   Only way I'll come back here is if I'm drunk. It seems like 88.1% of their customers are clubbers anyways.",

It's not listed in the guides, or on the instructions or signs, don't bother looking. Hotel staff will kindly direct you to the 3rd floor where a non-descript, low ceilings hallway (so un-Vegas), lined with vinyl album covers and rich in rock and roll music you've found this hole in the wall in a sea of Cosmopolitan Hotel flash and glitz.  If your nose notices the rich odor of spice and dough, you've found the X marking this spot...   I had a slice of cheese (heavenly with some powdered garlic) and a slice of the meat lovers... Only downside is the price, but if that's bothering you, why are you in Vegas - to clip coupons??? Still a $4 soda is kind of silly in a hole in the wall pizza joint, but that's Vegas Baby...",

    "text": "I really like the pizza, but does the hole-in-the-wall, dirty, grumpy, loud vibe seem a little too manufactured to anyone else? I mean, I'm sure those pizza makers are GENUINELY grumpy, they have to serve up a steady stream of pies all day long, deal with stupid questions, drunk hotel guests, people bringing in giant crowds AND people who whine about them not having their kind of pizza ready.  But the brick walls, the white t-shirt and apron outfits, the old pictures, and the pinball machine (which is obviously just there to help develop the ambiance because there is NOT enough room for it to be there) are just a bit forced. I mean, everyone knows LV is a place of many tastes and cultures, but I'm a little off-put by fabricating a NY pizzeria in the middle of your hotel/casino. I think my problem is, that while LV has a ton of recreations of things and places, they are all loaded up with kitsch, and secret pizza keeps the kitsch minimal- like they are going to trick us into not noticing what they're going for.  Okay, if you've read this far, you're probably like \"Why is this girl giving them 4 stars if she's just gonna complain about stuff?\" And to you I say, \"SORRY- had to get it out of my system.\"  Anyway, the pizza is good. I wouldn't say it's the best pizza I've had in my life or even the best Pizza west of NY, but it's a good pie. I know everyone makes a big fuss over the white pizza, but the homemade sausage they put on top their pies is SO good.  If you're in the cosmo and you're drunk, hungry, or even if you think you can't eat another bite- GET A SLICE!  drinks are a rip off and come in a red cup that is super hard to handle if you're juggling slices of pizza, a bag, children or whatever in your other hand.",

The mushrooms on my wife's slice were very fresh; she added red pepper and parmesan cheese to complete her pizza bliss.

We will definitely  be back for a whole pie to take on the road home, or have for dinner if we lost our butt at the tables.    If you're in the Cosmopolitan casino leave there and go to the mall area.  From there go to the third floor and find a pool table.  You should see a hallway with vintage albums as wall art.

Using the pics from other Yelpers, I was able to navigate up to the third floor and find the hallway that leads to this pizza joint. I ordered a whole pie with meatball, sausage, and mushrooms. After waiting for about 20 mins for the pizza to be done, I walked back to Vdara (where I was staying) and went HAM on this pizza. It was so good! First of all its thin crust, I love thin crust pizza. The toppings were well balanced because I know the meats were rich in flavor so I had to have mushrooms to balance that out. The best part was I was able to bring it home and enjoy this wonderful pie in the comfort of my home while recovering from the week long rage fest in Sin City!",

To make it easier for everyone it is located on the third floor. As you come off the escalator from the second floor to the third floor you will be facing the sushi restaurant towards the left and to the right of that you will see the long hallway lined with records that will take you to the small hidden area. We ordered two slices of mushroom pizza and two cokes. Our slices were put in the oven and heated up and we were eating in no time. The crust has a nice crisp chew to it and the cheese and sauce were well balanced. Nothing too crazy and we doctored up our pieces with a little sprinkle of Parmesan cheese, oregano, and garlic powder. The sodas have free refills. Overall it was a good slice of pizza and to tide us over for lunch. We also broke down and got two pieces of cannoli. The cannoli was rolled, baked, and stuffed with a creamy sweet ricotta filling. Overall it was very good. The slice was good and four stars is probably right. Service was engaging and friendly.",

Since we were usually not looking for food, we never bothered to ask anybody about it. Second to last night in LV, a drunken roommate, and a pizza craving finally allowed us to discover the hidden tunnel that leads to this magical place.   In case you didn't know, it's on the third floor of the Cosmo between Blue Ribbon Sushi & Jaleo. Make sure you go with time, and patience, because the line is usually down the hall, literally!   Being a native NYer, the pizza was decent. Although it wasn't AMAZING like most places back in NY, it was definitely worth the wait after a full day & night of partying in Vegas. It was exactly what we needed before heading to the airport at 6am.   Try it, trust, you'll thank me later.",

I usually find myself wandering the streets of LV with co workers on a nightly basis (usually during the months of April - June) and usually not the same ones every night either, so every night is a new night. And one night someone suggested \"The Hidden Pizza Place at the Cosmo\" so intrigued (and hungry) I said \"MEOW\" which in our terms means...well a number of things, but in this instance it meant ok.  So being that only one person had been here and more than likely was intoxicated while going, only knew how to get us to the Cosmo, after that it was like Beer Feast where I thought to pour a liter of Goldschlager down his throat to make him remember so I didn't have to stand between a rave bar and a place that smelled delicious. But forward we went with our caravan of folk in tact.   Upward and onward, through the chandelier bar, past Marquee, and around the corner from burgers we had found it. . . like the bright tunnel of light you see after you die....   I love it for a few reasons and here they are:  1) No signage to show were it is, makes it kinda mysterious  2) The pizza is actually pretty good, I mean not like \"NY, NY\" but still pretty close, I know that my NYer friends liked it.  3) There's a cool little lounging area with a pool table to chill next to whilst you eat your pizza.   Worth it? I think so. Nightly visitis? Hells yea!  Enjoy!",

I think the crowding problem were the people that were trying to find a place to eat there, waiting for counter space to open up.

I pursued it and believe me it was worth the hunt. The pizza was excellent, with the crust crunchy to the center and the toppings were generous. I swear, it was like playing hard to get, the more I could not find it the more I wanted it. If you are out downtown and are able to drunkenly find it, it will taste even better.

Don't look for any signs or information on the website: you won't find it.  Matter of fact, the only reason I found this place was because I did a search on Foursquare of local spots.  So the only way you'd find this place is by knowing that it exists.   Basically, it's on the 4th floor, next to STK.  You'll see a hallway of album covers.  All along the walls and the ceiling.  Walk down  that hallway and turn the corner and you're there!  It's not very big.  They have a few bar chairs and a ledge but if there's 5 people eating then you better take your pizza elsewhere.  You can buy a whole pizza or by the slice.  I personally had the white pizza, which is just as good as it was promised to be, and added toppings.  A slice, a couple of toppings and a drink will probably run you about $7, making it the cheapest meal you can have in the entire hotel.  So make sure you stop by and spread the word!

I can't say this is the best pizza ever (not even close) but a good and (relatively) cheap bite to eat. (\"relatively\" because it still seemed pricey to me for what it was).   Oh!

It took about 30 minutes or so for the pizzas to be done but it was worth the wait.  The crust was nice and thin, although I do prefer it to be a little more crunchy on the bottom.  The cheese was delicious.  Overall, great pizza and good at room temperature as well!  The Prices --- It was a little pricey.  I think the cheese was $24 and the other one was $29 or something.

    "text": "Now that Cosmo built out so many restaurants, it's not really too hard to find the 'secret' hallway to Secret Pizza - its between two restaurants and there usually is a long line of people waiting. Came by here yesterday with friends for an early dinner before heading out to the airport - it's NY style pizzas, you can order by the slice or a whole pie. Tip: Ask the pizza guys what's ready soon (the cooked pizzas that are stored underneath the table that will be put up once there's room) because when we asked there was a few different choices not visible (mushroom, meatball and ricotta, supreme). The pizzas are good, not oily, thin crunchy crust, and you can get a beer or soda to go. Seating is limited around the counters or outside if you are lucky. Pizzas are better if you happen to get it fresh out of the oven but not a bad deal if you're looking for an alternative to the full restaurants.",

It's a walk-up counter to order, and you can either get the order to go, or they have a few bar-type seats there.  After you order, they warm your slice in the oven for a few minutes, and call you out when it's ready.   It is affordable, of good quality, with friendly and efficient service.

    "text": "Secret!?  This place is about as secret as the fact that Donald Trump has a comb over...  Okay, Secret Pizza isn't secret, but they make some surprisingly legit NY-style pizza.  They serve three kinds of New York style pizza here: red, white, and Sicilian.  I'm still Jonesing for the Sicilian (they were out the two times I visited trying to get a slice); of the other two types, I think they're both exceptional examples of NY's finest.  My favorite of the two so far was the red, with Sausage, Pepperoni and garlic.  Both red and white slices are made with premium, super-sized, toppings and the crust is great tasting, chewy, soggy at all, and shaped exactly the way NY pizza should be shaped.  There are no signs announcing either the presence or location of Secret Pizza.  Legend has it it started out as a room-service pizza source built for guests, but it was decided before it opened to allow walk-ins from outside the hotel as well.  My friend had read about this place on Yelp and knew where to look in general. However, if we had not known beforehand to be on the lookout we likely would have never found it. It is located down a dimly lit corridor with framed album covers hanging on the wall.  Secret Pizza may be hard to find, but once you do, you'll be a very happy camper!",

I was in line with wifey and Sarah-Marie, and all 3 of us had planned on getting white pizza which obviously is a popular one. I look over to see how many slices there are and we see one slice left.. The two parties ahead of us don't order any, and just before it is our turn to order, the last slice is taken. Meanwhile, there are THREE COOKS behind the counter. Tweedle Dee is running the register and popping slices in the oven, Tweedle Dumb is moving like molasses, making a pizza at cruise control speed while the line is growing even longer, Sarah Marie asks if more white pizza is gonna be made and  Tweedle Dumber's answer? \"No, not any time soon.\" Really? All the ingredients are staring you in the face and you couldn't hustle to get another one in the oven? Wifey and Sarah Marie got other slices cause he was to lazy to get another one going.  After BS like that, I wish There was a way to give no stars. Nico took all of them when he left...ALOHA!!!",

    "text": "I really wanted to experience this place ever since seeing this on the Travel Channel and recently I had the chance to try this New York-style pizza hidden down an unmarked hallway that's buried deep within the Cosmopolitan hotel. Keeping in mind, I've been to New York City quite a few times and have had authentic slices; so my expectations were quite high for this place. Although it's supposedly \"Secret\", felt like everyone knew about \"secret pizza\". It was quite a good 20-30min wait around 10pm for just couple slices. Once at the front counter, you'll see pizza already pre-made for you to choose from and then the pizza makers will throw it back in the oven to reheat. However, 10secs isn't long enough to reheat pizza. My slices  (meat lovers slice & mushroom slice)came out \"luke-warm\" and crust was hard as cardboard. My fiancee' was lucky and was able to try a slice of the white pizza that had just come out of the oven(which was quite delicious. One of the best white style pizzas i've tried).  3 slices came out just under $20.   Cons: -long line -long wait -drunk people in line -expensive slices -no place inside to dine-in  Pros: -only worth trying if it's fresh out of the oven  Overall: First experience was meh. You are better off getting a slice somewhere else. And if you are eager to try this place make sure you order a whole pie because it is not worth having reheated [($5per slice) save it for the craps table] for mediocre quality(unless you're drunk).",

Hands down the best pizza I have ever tasted. So good I went two days on a row and will go back. I've never been a fan of thin crust till now. The pizza has three cheeses giving it the right consistency and cheesy flavor. The cheeses are probably mozzarella, Parmesan and a softer cheese I could not figure out.They also drizzle a garlicky buttery dressing. The pepperoni does not taste average, you can taste the spices. The best part is the Italian sausage its sliced and the edges come out of the oven crispy on the edges. The crust is baked perfect crispy on the bottom not burnt raw or chewy.  It's not over hyped or over priced. Good quality ingredients attention to the small details is what counts. You get what you pay for and this is a bargain if you consider a flight to New York City just for pizza. Pizza Heaven for sure.",

If this were on the corner in your town, probably 4 stars.  Walking into this place, we half-expected the small crowd to turn with a welcoming cheer, like, \"you made it into our club!\"  We felt like the Coors Light ice climbers were about to pop up with 2 beers for our hidden party.    It was almost comical...but also super simple.  The counter where we order suggested the Pizza Re-heater Guy might belt out a \"No pizza for you!\" if we strayed from any specific club parlance.     This was like a bonus while staying at Cosmopolitan.  If we weren't staying there, I'd definitely have walked down the strip late night for a slice or two.  Or three.",

My boyfriends friend is in a band called Secret Pizza so we wanted to check this place out. Each slice is about $5+ so we came here for a quick and yummy lunch. This is a NY style pizzeria which is hard to find. It was yummy and we appreciated all of the cool decor. Vegas food can be pricey so give this place a try if you are looking for a quick bite to eat in the middle of the strip!",

At least i get to see why this place was oh so secret haha since there are no signs or even a name to let you know it's here but I guess seeing a bunch of people lining up for no apparent reason is your sign of knowing where secret pizza is.   Fairly decent price for how big the pizza is when you order the whole thing. I actually really like the pizza...my favorite toppings to go along with it right now is probably pepperoni, onions/mushrooms, and garlic. Man the garlic makes the pizza absolutely delicious!!! I really like the thin layer crust even though it doesn't exactly get me full :p but as long as it taste delicious then there isn't much to complain about. I guess my real only complain to secret pizza is probably the amount of oil you see on it which i should of use my napkin to soak it up because i remember i had a stomachache the next day...you know the rest. #tmi  BUT YEA make sure you use the napkin to lessen the oil and you'll be fine as it is a delicious pizza to enjoy.   What i also love about secret pizza is that it closes at 4-5 am and that is just 2 major thumbs up for me. #nightlifeeating :)  I find it to be a place you should come every time you're in vegas. :)",

What is surprising is that, despite being located in one of Vegas' trendiest casinos, Secret Pizza (if that's really what it's called) does not include the usual mind-blowing wallet smack.  For 26 bucks, you can get a 3 topping pizza (they only have one size by-the-way) that blows away every other za in town. I highly recommend the sausage and the meatball as two of those toppings. Not that hungry? Then just grab a slice or two.  Add 5 bucks for valet parking, take the great glass elevator to the top (just don't press that special button Charlie) and you can be enjoying one of the best slices of pie you've had since they threw you out of NYC.

It was pretty easy to find due to directions from other fellow Yelper's reviews. Once I found them I saw they had maybe 5-6 pre-made pizzas you can order a slice from. I'm sure you can order whole pizzas with your toppings of choice as well. I chose a slice of mushroom pizza. I think it might have been $6 plus tip and tax. The annoying this is that I noticed that most, if not all, registers on the Strip now ask you to tip automatically when you pay by card, even for grab and go places.   Anyways, they heated up the pizza slice and served it on a thin white paper plate so I ate it at one of their limited counter spaces. It was just alright though. It was thin, greasy, and salty. I really had to fold it in half to eat it.",

Being a biased New Yorker most pizza doesn't compare, but Secret Pizza definitely sets themselves apart with good flavor, texture and more importantly CHEESE. I love the hunt to find the restaurant too, it made the pizza even more satisfying. I could go on but all you need to know is, this is a must stop when you go to Vegas if nowhere else. I will definitely be back any and every time I go to back to Vegas.",

Arcade games & nice music.  Today Crystal helped me she was absolutely nice and they take the time to talk and socialize with their customers.  Third floor up the escalator next to the Blue Ribbon restaurant and go through the hallway.  Pictures will help enjoy and thank me later",

There is no signs or labels to this place and you just have to know where it's at or ask someone that works there.  The slices are very large and very greasy so be prepared for that, but it's a great tasting pizza pie.  We went when they opened at 11am so there wasn't a line and we got out pizza right away and it was very hot and yummy.

The white pizza that everyone was raving about was okay - it was a bit bland and I had to douse it in pepper to make it a little more interesting. It was also waaay too greasy! There were puddles of grease on top of my slice.  My boyfriend had the white slice and the Sicilian. He thought the Sicilian was too meaty (in a bad way), and also too salty.  We left feeling pretty fat, lol. All the regrets when we went to XS that same night -___- Definitely should've only ordered one slice each, or skipped out on Secret Pizza altogether.  The crust was pretty good, but nothing to write home about. Definitely one of the better pizzas I've had, but it's way overhyped. I'd probably come back for some drunchies, but otherwise, I'd skip out.  Also, $4 for a red solo cup of soda?! Rip off :(",

You have choices of a full pie or slices: $5 slices? Expensive but your in the Cosmo but hey they back it up with some bomb-ass pizzas. What I saw is that they have some pizzas ready in the kitchen, the choices: white, plain cheese, pepperoni, meat lovers, and supreme you choose a slice then they reheat it for you or you can order by request and customize it made fresh, which there is a pizza guy who makes pies in front of you, and to top it off they offer free re-fills on soda purchases.  The first visit my choice was the meat lovers, not as dry, but the flavor still holds up. Same thing goes on my second visit still flavorful and all I had was a white cheesed pizza. Their pizza dough ain't old, and stale that leaves it bland like other joints but it's so opposite of that. It's NY style pizzas here that makes you wanting more.  This is the first place that I've used garlic powder for pizzas which is provided on the counter along with crushed peppers and Parmesan.  I've learned that the garlic powder adds taste and seasoning to an already awesome pie, it compliments it and thanks to this place Ive learned something new.  This joint is small, only two chairs inside , you might want to hangout where there is a pool table outside  if its not crowded theres a few sofas to get comfy. I found that if your coming from the second floor just take the escalator to the third floor go straight left were you see a small hallway of portraits. Very hidden I must say, no signs here, but worth finding.  If your just coming out of a club and your wanting to wash away the drunkeness, I recommend this place this pizzeria will be that anti-hangover.",

OMG this pizza reminded me of MY slices i was in PIZZA HEAVEN. i love the hallway walls covered with various albums, it took me down memory lane since i love music..when we arrive the line wasn't too long, we waited approx 30 mins. Service was fast and the staff explained the pizzas they had and were willing to answer questions. I love the cashier, she was funny and had a great personality. we came back the best day and she remembered us haha..I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying the pizza we had was GREAT!... hubby and I both had a slice; him, sausage and me pepperoni and mushroom. Crust was thin and crispy, sauce was yummy and just enough to not make the crust soggy. Pizza I would give 4STARS.  Loses a star since it had been sitting there and was reheated prior to serving to us.  Again, it doesn't take much from taste... it was very good.  REASON FOR 3 rating!... 2 (slightly smaller than a Costco size slice of pizza) $16!!!  Really?!?  That's a lot!  They're menu is very very limited.  If there were other options aside from cheese, pepperoni or sausage, you wouldn't have known it because it didn't say that anywhere.  The set up of the place is that of a grab N go... very limited seating.  It's not a pizzeria.  I'm not knocking the hole in the wall that it is, hole in the wall eateries are beat known for their food.  It was just unexpected.   Another thing we found as an irony of sorts... it's called Secret Pizza... UH YAH!, you can't easily find the place!!  We were told it's on the 3rd floor.  Ok fine... get out of the elevator and walked the entire floor and didn't see it anywhere... no signage or anything.  Apparently we walked right past it twice.  So again... good pizza but because it's priced high, limited pizza options, set up as a eat and go and prior to all that we killed 20mins trying to find the place; I was left a bit disappointed to say the least.",

Just head up to the third floor of the cosmopolitan and search for the tiled hallway immediately to the left of Jaleo. It's open pretty late (4 am the night I went), so it's great for an after-bar meal. I stayed at Caesars Palace the last time I was in Vegas and I was craving it badly enough to make the walk across the Bellagio at 2am for their white top pizza. They have by the slice options as well as entire pizzas. The line does get pretty long so I would definitely recommend going either really late or really early in the evening.",

I wanted to come back here for their Sicilian pizza but they said there was a 20 minute wait for it. So we ordered a cheese pizza added with mushrooms and sausage, white pizza, and one they had on display, which was a cheese with meatball and ricotta. Out of the three, the white was our favorite, and the meatball and ricotta was delicious too. However, the mushrooms on the cheese pizza with sausage was way too undercooked. It was a disappointment. Maybe it was because we asked to add them as a custom order.   Service was slightly rude. The guy taking our orders seemed grumpy. The tables were also very messy and we had to clean up the cheese and napkins scattered over the tables ourselves.   I'd come back here for the Sicilian pizza if I'm around the strip.",

The Cosmo is a quick walk from Planet Hollywood which was nice. None of the signs inside the hotel mentioned Secret Pizza so we were skeptical about it being there and had a little bit of a hard time finding it (it's on the third floor next to the glass elevator). Prices were weird- a slice of pizza started at $5 which is pretty normal, but it was $4 for a SMALL fountain drink? I ended up paying almost $20 for a slice of pepperoni, the white slice, and a drink. It hit the spot though and was really good! Tables had parmesan sprinkled all over them, empty wine glasses, and used napkins. There is also hardly any seating, we were lucky to find a spot at 3 a.m. The staff was very friendly and quick to serve us.",

If you come at peak hours, expect to wait 30 minutes in a line that runs down the hallway. Ordering a whole pizza will take an additional 20. I always opt for the single slice and almost always get the white pizza. Out of all the options that are offered, the white pizza is probably the most ugliest and unsavory looking pizza, but it's the most delicious. No meat, no veggies but an amazing combination of cheese. They also don't have free water, only bottled water. Overall, I love coming here and recommend it for anyone who is nearby the Cosmo hotel!",

Your best bet is to find somewhere right outside to sit and enjoy your pizza. You have the option of either getting a slice for around $6 or a whole pie for $30. My most recent trip I tried the white pizza, and it was good but not my favorite. Really cool place to check out!",

Although part of the cool factor is the undisclosed nature of its location, it is not too hard to find when you see the crowd of people on the third floor with slices of pizza in their hand...  ;)  When you walk down the corridor, you are invited by the smell of pizza wafting in the air.  It is a surprisingly lively joint that is reminiscent of an old school pizza joint lined with pinball machines and a huge oven to heat/reheat pizzas.  Whenever I come there is usually a line of some sort so be prepared to wait a little.   There are several ways to order here.  You can either get a whole pizza or get it by the slice.  From there, you can order one of their set pizza slices or create your own.  One slice was pretty filling but if you have a big party then it may be worth buying a whole pie.  It takes about a 10-15 minutes for them to heat up a slice if it has already been made but that wait is well worth it when you get that nice hot slice of pizza.  As implied earlier, the service is decent and fast.  There isn't really much seating inside but there are seats outside in the Cosmo area.   If you are in the hunt for some good pizza while you are at the Cosmo, Secret Pizza is the way to go!",

Luckily when we got there it was only us and we were able to grab a couple seats. I got super crowded after we ordered so something must be good. I just went with a couple sausage slices. The pizza was good. New York style pizza is my favorite and this spot rivals other pizza spots I've been to. I also had a bite of someone's white pizza... delicious! That's what I'll be getting next time I go.  Remember you're in Vegas so don't expect a bargain when coming here. This is the strip so it is what it is. Still a good option to grab a couple slices and be on your way.",

However, it was fun finding the place and walking through the hall of record covers and listening to the amusing pizza chef with the thick accent yelling \"pow! pow!\" as he waxed poetic about his white cheese with ricotta and cold slices of tomato pizza which he dubbed the \"waiting for the sunset\" pizza.  It's a great place to grab a cheap late night meal if you don't feel like leaving the hotel.  Free refills on soda is a big plus as well!",

You won't find the location on any of the interactive maps at the Cosmopolitan. At check in they told us about this place and we literally walked around on the third floor for 5 minutes just trying to find it. I am not even sure this place has an official name although it has been tagged as the Pizzeria. Pizza is served piping hot from the oven NY Style. Drinks are served from the fountain in plastic cups. The lady who took our order was confused about the pizza choices which was actually quite impressive given there were only 4 on the table and two of them were clearly cheese and pepperoni. I hope her food knowledge improves or she may be stuck here a long time before she makes it to the Outback. Apparently this place is pretty busy at 3 am in the morning for the club crowds and is good for a late night snack. Search this hidden gem out in the Cosmo. You won't disappointed!",

This \"not so secret\" NY style pizzeria is located on the third floor of  Cosmopolitan down the narrow hallway by the pool tables.  The pizza is amazing, especially the white pizza and whatever sausage special they have. Prices are fair at about $4/slice.  Go ahead and order 2 slices from the get go, you won't regret it.  They try to move the line along as quickly as possible. It's probably worth leaving the clubs a little early to beat the rush.  The pizza was so good, that we actually ended up there 2 nights in a row.  First night, we got the pizza to go and took it to our room.  My advice would be to just eat it there while it's hot and fresh.  They also serve a couple beers on tap, in case you didn't have enough vodka red-bulls at the club.  This is probably the best late night snack in Vegas.",

After a night of clubbing in painful 5 inch heels, walking around Cosmopolitan to find a slice of pizza was never a priority of mine. During my recent trip to Vegas, my friends dragged me here and I couldn't be happier.   Located on the third floor of Cosmopolitan between Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar and Jose Andre's Jaleo. If you enter from the strip, see a giant red shoe sculpture and take the escalators up -- you're going in the right direction! There are NO signs, no banners, nothing to indicate where you are, so just look for the hallway with a line of people. Leave it to that long, long line in the hallway to make you antsy and even more hungry as you see other people leaving with their slices of pizza.  We decided to order an entire sausage and pepperoni pizza, which took about 40 minutes to make. To kill time, we went down into the Cosmo casino and gambled for a bit. Once the pizza was done, we took it back to our room to be devoured. It was not the best slice of pizza that I have ever had but hey, it was 3 am, tasty and hit the spot. Thin crust pizza, somewhat greasy, and fair amount of cheese and toppings.  If you are in Vegas and craving pizza over everything else, give Secret Pizza in Cosmopolitan a try! Good luck finding it :)",

    "text": "I have been recently initiated into eating from Secret Pizza. I went to Las Vegas to celebrate my 21st birthday and my boyfriend strongly recommended that we go to Secret Pizza. So in a slightly buzzed stupor, we made our way to the Cosmopolitan on the Las Vegas Strip. There's no point in asking the hotel or Casino staff because the location is low key and they even act like they've never heard of a pizzeria in the building. Did you think that the title Secret Pizza was a joke?    So we went up 3 flights of escalators from the casino floor. Next to a quiet lounge area and Marquee nightclub's exit, there is a dark hallway with decorated art tiles. From Friday-Sunday night, this place is super popular and some might confuse this line for being a bathroom. However, once you see the literal light at the end of the tunnel, it is a small pizzeria with white walls. The whole pizza box orders shuffle out in blank white boxes to maintain secrecy. Even the receipts have no brand or address printed on them.  Prices are higher than most pizza places on the strip but the quality is top tier. I ordered a white slice with sausage and mushroom and my boyfriend ordered a white slice with pepperoni. The slices were topped and reheated to order. The surrounding bar stools and eating area has powdered parmesan cheese, oregano, and chili flakes to sprinkle on your pizza.  Despite being a Friday night at 1:00am, the place was poppin with customers. We went out to a closed restautant's lounge area and ate there. The pizza was crisp and the ingredients were really fresh. This is better drunk food than you can possibly imagine. This might've been one of the best pizza slices that I've ever eaten. So much that throughout my entire stay in Las Vegas, I wouldn't shut up about getting more secret pizza",

We tried the basic, cheese for me and pepperoni for my bf. Both were dry and not very flavorful. Maybe we tried the wrong toppings? Maybe when you get pizza that's freshly made it's better and we just came at an off time?",

To make things difficult, my friends and I were already tipsy and to make things even more difficult there are no signs to be seen to direct you to this place. They leave customers to explore the hotel on their own as they find sort of a secret passage way leading down a narrow hallway as they're awarded with an amazing smelling pizza sold by the slice or whole pizzas. I recommend this place if you're down for an adventure after a night of clubbing while in Las Vegas. Worth the money.",

We had 8 people and it filled us up perfectly. One pie was the white pizza while the other is the supreme pizza with everything on it. I wasn't too crazy about the supreme, which would taste even better from any pizza chain. But the white pizza is covered with ricotta cheese and other white cheesy heavenly ingredients. The slices are huge cuts and two slices stuffed me.   Be aware that there's only a small counter here with two seats, but you can find some couches and a pool table outside to sit and eat.",

Find a hallway outside Marquee and let your senses (or people walking out with slices) guide you to the inside of the shop.   The most popular flavors are white and meatball & ricotta, according to a staff member. We ordered a slice of white pizza and a slice of pepperoni & banana peppers. Both were excellent, with a thin and chewy crust, but certainly not the best we've ever had. We may be tough critics, but living in New York for a few years set the bar high.   Luckily, we didn't stay at the Cosmo, for easy accessibility would have been dangerous. Till next time, Secret Pizza.",

    "text": "When a friend told me about a secret pizza place we should check out in Cosmopolitan, my first inclination was to Yelp it.  Not so secret with 3200 Yelp Reviews, I thought.  Whether its for pure marketing strategy or for a nobler cause of filtering the unworthy from pure pizza aficionados, we didn't really care.  We just wanted a good pizza.  So off we went to the overly modern, sparkling Cosmopolitan Hotel on a Friday night with the street roaming masses in search of their famed New York style pizza.  Despite having looked it up, it still took two asks on two floors to find the spot.  Both staff members seemed well prepared for the question and soon we were walking down a narrow hallway decorated with records I'm pretty sure even my parents were too hip to listen to.    The first thing I saw entering was the video game Galaga from the 80s and a couple of pinball machines in a very small square room with no tables and chairs and a busy counter to order from.  Gratification was quick as we moved with the line.  They had four different pizzas ready to serve: cheese, pepperoni, mushroom, sausage and peppers. And basically if you want more topping, they just grab one of these and add whatever topping you want to add.  So it makes it quick.    The pizza.  Oh the pizza was quite good.  So good that despite my low carb obsession of late, rules had to be broken and I asked for more.  More. More.  Ingredients were quality despite the low price.  As the noise, decor, and the visual overload of a very diverse group of customers nearly tested my sanity- the gooey, greasy, meaty goodness of this pizza blocked it all out for me.     I was in my happy place.",

Secret is a solid pizza place and probably isn't much of a secret anymore but you will find that it's a hole in the wall with a long line leading through it. The pizza is pretty darn amazing after a long night.   How it works is you wait in line and when you get to the front you can either create your own and order a whole pizza or you can choose from the slices they have out. Somewhat greasy but when it's 4AM, who gives a damn! Honestly you can't go wrong with any of the precut slices. The line also moves at a decent pace so don't be scared, it really isn't bad.  Definitely slightly pricey for pizza but it's the strip and basically one of the few places for cheap eats on the strip. Only warning is if you don't like ricotta, make sure to order a slice without ricotta.",

The thin crust is perfectly crisped and the cheese is ooey and gooey. You can pick your slice and they warm it up for you.

Secrets are kept and reasons retained under lock and key.  Whatever it may be, I dedicate this one to thee.  After seeing so many reviews of this worst kept Vegas secret, I finally ventured up two flights of escalators in the City of Sin, where whispers stay and never leave closed lips.  The Cosmopolitan hide-out comes to light as one ventures down a dingy hallway of framed magazine covers dimly lit by spotlight halogen lights (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#4bjZhYMwuBLPOZoW6DI9MA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/secr...</a>).  It's but a small 60'x60' room filled with a few pinball wizards and people patiently waiting for a slice of heavenly pie (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=o7wcJPIoRt13Dx7coGNEtw#o7wcJPIoRt13Dx7coGNEtw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/secr...</a>).

For those with a more voracious appetite a pie be available with prices ranging from $25 to a deluxe of $35.00.  Pie additions cost $2.50 each.  Quite expensive, but not on my \"Lost Wages\" radar, as I wanted it by the slice and by the slice I did receive.  The toppings looked plain and just nominally adequate as they sit in their aluminum bins just waiting to be tossed sporadically on round pie pans laid with golden flour.  The prices of drinks are on par with private Taoish bars:  Sodas 4 bucks, IPAs 7 bucks.  Good Ol' PBR sewer agua a ghastly 5 bucks.  We asked the chef what be best in his opinion.  Although we weren't really impressed with what was presented, we opted to go with his picks of white, deluxe, and veggie-tar-e-yan (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#VpTrXV0-B3IXvr2iCQiTtQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/secr...</a>) (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#ns2AT1cd63Rihd8BiVwDqw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/secr...</a>) (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#Kh_DKlGnEKPQcgDBnzmw2g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/secr...</a>) (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#yYP2x9gRAHoDEx9R5E_1dw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/secr...</a>).     Various choices to choose: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#qCog__OGMqN2fhJxaHZx7w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/secr...</a>) (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#q3VPFuV-SQjXhIab6f_9aQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/secr...</a>)  We paid and waited just as patiently as others, noticing everyone kept within their small cliques, or busily eying their mobiles (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#c9cbpz6hdIG_qINg5huokg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/secr...</a>).  The slices returned to the broiler and there they sat, until our names were called and then it begat!  No idea if I be drunk or needed to be buzzin' to enjoy these hot tempting pie slices, but whatever it was, it really worked for me.  It was but a warm slice of heaven that was on par with some of the best I've put in my mouth without worrying about spitting up some hairball.  The crust was just crisp enough with the flexibility of NY-stylin' that wrapped around my hand.  Just enough grease and just enough cheese, the deluxe was nothing but 5-star tasting'.  We ate at the small alcove bar to take in and enjoy the happening surroundings.  I actually think the re-heating is probably the key to getting the crust texture just right.  It was such a pleasure to finally unravel your secret, and while the surroundings are a bit crewed, as long as you're with friends or loved ones this place can satisfy any of your late night whims.  I will loyally keep the secret of this unnamed hallway as faithfully as a yelper should.  The last buck stops here (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/secr...</a>)!",

I didn't have to pay for the pizza, thank God for being a girl in Vegas... but these guys spent $70 bucks on 2 pizzas for us. Can you say OVERPRICED? And the pizza wasn't even amazing. It wasn't even good. It was whatever and I was drunk. That should tell you something if greasy pizza when you're drunk is not good.  And don't worry, I've had it when I was sober too. It just wasn't worth the time you have to wait and the price you have to pay.",

    "text": "Possibly the cheapest meal you will find in any of the casinos on the Las Vegas Strip.  And this unassuming and \"hidden\" pizzeria, which is not even what their name is (according to the man I spoke to behind the counter) is located in the newest luxury casino to opened in Las Vegas.  It is on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan, across from the escalator and located next to Blue Ribbon Sushi.  There are no signs indicating that there is anything down the short hallway adorned with album covers, besides of course the pinball machine and flat screen televisions mounted on the wall clearly visible to anyone who bothered to look in.  But instead of finding a hidden alcove of arcade games, you will find a counter where you can order your pizza by the slice or by the whole pie, and work space where they prepare the NY-style pizzas from scratch.  Prices are reasonable.  Slices starts at $3 per slice (plain cheese), $3.50 (one-topping), $4 (two toppings combo), and for $6 (you get a slice of plain cheese pizza and domestic draft beer).  18\" Pizza by the pie: $17 (Cheese), $18 (White Pizza - Ricotta & Mozzarella Cheese), $22 (three-toppings), or $25 (five-toppings).  Available Toppings (in alphabetical): Black Olives, Extra Cheese, Fresh Garlic, Green Peppers, Meatballs, Mushrooms, Onions, Pepperoni, Ricotta, Roasted Tomatoes, Sliced Sausage, Spinach, White Anchovies.  Beverages: Coca-Cola Brand fountain drinks, beer and wine (domestic and premium draft), Illy Coffee.  The cup of soda is pretty small, but you can ask for refills. :D  Desserts: New York Cheesecake Slice and Cannoli.  Also if you are staying at the Cosmopolitan and too busy/lazy/important/lost :p to make your way to the \"Pizzeria\", you can ring up the hotel to have someone deliver your pizza order.  BTW, the concept of selling pizzas by the slice has been around for a long time, just ask any UCB students, but to implement this concept inside a mega luxury casino is as Misti (LV Yelp CM) stated, \"genius\"!  ----2/15/2011---- Holy cow!  I have no idea this place gets so packed at 11pm on a Tuesday night!  And their cheese-less pizzas with extra garlic oil added to the pizza sauce is dope!  I am glad I ate the last slice that no one else wanted, even though I was rather full already :)  Decor: 4.5/5 Pizza: 3.5/5 Price: 4.5/5 Staff: 5/5 Friendly and nice to the guests.",

    "text": "One of my friends mentioned she was craving pizza as we were leaving Marquee, and to that, my roommate whispered \"secret pizza.\" To be honest, I thought she was just drunk until she took us upstairs to this place.   It's literally a hole in the wall with cool old school decor. There's a small area with bar seating for maybe less than 10 people, so it's really a grab-n-go kind of place. I saw people ordering whole pizzas to take back to their hotel room.    The pizza is about $5-6 a slice. I thought it was a little step at first, but the slices are HUGE, probably about double your normal pizza slice. I got a regular cheese pizza slice, and my friends got white pizza. It was SO FREAKIN GOOD... probably the BEST pizza I've ever had at 1AM, tired, and coming out of a night club. Only pitfall was that it was a little oily, but I mean, what pizza isn't? That's what makes it so bomb. I would have gotten more slices if I didn't care about fitting into my dress the next night.   AND WHY AREN'T MORE PEOPLE MENTIONING THE GARLIC POWDER? Holy canoli, that stuff's basically crack. The first time around I thought I accidentally poured too much on my slice, but then I tried it and got hooked. It ain't no accident the second and third time I went in for the powder; I covered my whole slice in a thick layer of that stuff.   Terrific pizza, not only for the drunk and hungry but ESPECIALLY if you're drunk and hungry. Listen to me and douse that pizza in garlic powder. You won't regret it.",

Dude, $4 isn't even gonna get you water in Marquee!  The guys in there are hilarious always chatting up the folks, drunk or sober. One of 'em even told me the story of why they call the white pizza, \"the sunset..\" Let it be known that the cheese are the clouds and the tomatoes in the middle are the sunset...So romantic *blushing*  Even though mushrooms are my favorite pizza, I really love their white pizza. And all it is is cheese, sauce, and tomatoes. It's sooooo simple and yet, oooohhh so good.  In fact, I was debating on writing this review because I don't wanna tooo many people to crowd my fave food spot in Cosmo. But, this was too good not to share!",

I am still recovering from my pizza trauma, if I may call it that (I ate pizza, inferior quality at that, at least three times a week for about a year and a half). When my cousin suggested pizza for lunch, I tried to kill this idea until he said \"it is a secret place that not even all locals know about, and the pizza is great. Las Vegas is number 2 in TripAdvisor's top 10 American cities for pizza, you know. \"  Secret?? With a dash of fighting words?? Do count me in!  And yes, the pizza was great! It could get pretty crowded as they don't have a big space nor a lot of staff. But the pizza was indeed delicious. The crust is thin and flavorful, and every bite was quite tasty.  If you are in the vicinity of the Strip and want some delicious pizza, do try to find this \"secret\" spot.",

(I just asked someone who worked at the Cosmopolitan. I'm lazy~)   Most of these people are people dealing with a long night of party-going, drinking, money spending, or whatever Las Vegas-type shenanigans has to offer and ending it with a nice slice of pizza. The line moves pretty steadily, most of the time. If it's slow, it's probably the customer, not the workers. Just a wittle \"for-your-information.\"  Pizza is about 5 dollars a slice, but slices are huge. You even see people walking out with boxes, and I mean BOXES of pizza here. (For 2-3AM, and to be willing to spend more money on this place, you know the food is good.) I, myself, enjoyed the slices, and I certainly shared it with my two friends. We were good with just two slices. Water is free there and they have a filter machine next to the counter.  Atmosphere is great, service is hardworking and diligent, and honestly, I don't feel so bad about what Las Vegas did to me that night once I look around at others. I'll be back again sure enough~ Thanks guys!",

My favorite was definitely the white pizza.  Who can resist white sauce, ricotta cheese, and GARLIC on pizza?  It was also the one that was the least soggy and held up the best.

Staff is SUPER friendly, make you feel like you grew up there with them.  Loved it and can't say enough good things.  The pizza is NY style with a great thin crispy crust.  Piping hot, molten lava cheese.  Just do it, you won't regret it.",

The pizza was pretty good, not the best ive had but good. Then again, I wasn't  drunk when I had it, but I would recommend checking it out for the fun of it. There really is not a place to sit inside so plan accordingly. It is like $30 for a whole pizza, I'm not sure who considers that cheap, it seems like full price to me.",

I had heard about Secret Pizza from an episode of Man Finds Food and thought of this place. Secret Pizza is located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan through an unmarked hallway and had a loooong line. It was around 2:30am with not much else open, so we chose to wait. We waited in line down the long hallway for about 30min and were tortured by everyone walking by with their delicious looking pizza. It was finally time to order and I went with the Sicilian white pizza. I'm not usually a fan of Sicilian, but this slice looked so good I decided to take a risk. The pizza was delicious (as a former New Yorker I'm very picky about my pizza). The crust was cooked perfectly and was full of garlicky flavor and creamy ricotta. It was also huge, I could only eat half. Next time I'm in Vegas I will be sure to come back for some late night pizza.",

Luckily in the same trip we decided to check it out again and this time there was almost no line. I didn't see a menu so I just looked at what pizzas they had available. I opted for the pepperoni/sausage slice. From what others said, they usually pop it back in the oven for a quick reheat, but I think with the turnover and how quickly people were coming, the pizza was still fresh out of the oven and didn't need a reheat.  This place makes no sense. There is no sign and the hallway is super long. They even have like a pinball machine? Totally doesn't fit the lavishness of cosmo either. It was like 3-4 dollars a slice and served on weak paper plates.   Although a bit greasy, it was really good. Totally hit the spot and even though I wasn't hungry, I really wanted to get another slice. We ate right outside the pizza joint because it was too small and crowded inside.",

It deserves every one of the 5 stars I have given it! I mean the pies are pretty damn good, but it just goes beyond that with everything else.   From the moment you walk in & are greeted by my Paisan, Nico until you leave, you just can't help but feel giddy. When you step up to the counter, Nico just lays it all out, as only he can, starting you off with the pricing & some playful banter & all the different magic you can make with your slice or pie. The magic is definitely limited to your own imagination ;)   However, I went with the basics, a slice of cheese & a slice of pepperoni & washed it down with a Barq's. My date du jour had a slice of cheese & some water. At which time, we took our place on some stools along the counter & did the good old pizza fold & chowed down!   We strolled in about 2 am-ish, after catching a movie at Rave. I was totally craving a slice! It wasn't too busy at all, fortunately ;) It looked like there had just been a crowd in there, as it was a little messy. But that only adds to the charm of such a place.   The most magical part of this late night pizza craving was, that it was all \"on them\"! Unfortunately for us, or them, depending on how you look at it, they couldn't take cards at that particular time, which was all I had on me. So yeah, SCORE! Cuz, I do likes me some FREE eats ;) However, we did leave a nice tip for them in the tip jar.   Overall, an awesome place to grab a slice or a whole pie. Definitely a cool vibe & not something you would expect to be in a stunning place, such as the Cosmo. You gotta really look for this place when you get up to the 3rd floor. Which is all I'm saying :P You will have to read the other reviews on here to find your way. Lol!",

My problem was that I was here around lunch time, no alcohol in my system but maybe some caffeine and I wasn't starving. I just wanted to try the pizza everyone else was raving about.   The place is very nice and clean, it wasn't busy at the time so I can't tell how log the pizza was sitting out there. I ordered a slice of the white pizza and the guy took the slice and put it in the oven to warm it up. The pizza came out good, the bread was a little too toasted almost like a cracker and the topping wasn't bad but a little bit too garlicky for my taste, it kept coming back, everything I ate after that had a garlic taste all through the day and conversations were kept short. Although the pizza was good, that \"special pizza\" everyone talks about was not delivered, I can assure you that there are a lot of better pizza places in town. So here's \"the secret\"......the five star pizza that they serve here is actually a three star pizza.  Now you know, and for the very first time I'll agree....the book is better.",

If it wasn't for other reviews on Yelp it would have taken us a long time to find it by ourselves since it is not listed in the directory and there were no signs. However, I get the whole \"treasure\" hunting idea, which is unique, but when you are hungry or have a tight agenda you don't have time to spend looking for food. Just in case you don't know where the pizzeria is, it is located on the 3rd floor in between two restaurants. We came around 9:30 in the night and didn't have to wait long. The options for pizza are limited but it is good in size. The price is fairly high about $5 to $6 plus any additional toppings for a slice. But you have to take into account that this is Las Vegas!",

    "text": "\"Belee dat\"  I can officially confirm the hype.  It should be Pizza Counter With No Name and not Secret Pizza... not important though.    It was fun tracking through the Cosmo with my swerve on trying to find this place.  It took about 45 minutes.  We ordered the white pizza.  The crust is thin and holds up well when folded.   The crust was crispy on the bottom and had a slight chew to it.  The crust was perfect.  I would like a comforter made for my bed from this crust.  The pizza was topped off with a perfect melody of garlic and ricotta.    If someone stole my car and left me 2 of these pizzas in the parking spot, I think I would be happy.    Later that night I dreamed I was in bed with Selma Hyeck.  She was wearing a white tank top with no bra and my boxer shorts. We were watching Married With Children laughing having a good time.  I was eating a whole white pizza from this Pizza Place With No Name.  She reached inside the pizza box and tried to grab a piece.  I quickly moved the box from her reach and said \"My Pizza.\"  Then I kicked Selma out of bed, and said \"go sleep on the couch CRAZY!\"  She apologized and slept at the foot of the bed.  In reality, this place gets a lot of attention because most pizza joints in this town suck!  With that being said, The Best Pizza in Las Vegas.",

The owner served us our slices hot and fresh. The variety was amazing. The price was almost nonexistent. We took our slices out to the comfy and chic seating area in the atrium at The Cosmopolitan and STUFFED our FACES! So tasty. Slim but wide slices without all the dough, just the right amount of grease so I could imagine it would be ideal drunk food. They're open until some ridiculous hour like 4 am. Good thinking! I hope they're making a killing$$ I tell everyone going to Vegas they MUST try Secret Pizza!  Every time we visit Vegas we research what we're going to do this time. Who wants to visit such a city and stay drunk and lose money the whole time? Secret Pizza came up in our research. Finding it at The Cosmopolitan felt like a treasure hunt, which is part if the fun!  Ok. So the only reason I can't give this place 5 stars is because it leaves no room for improvement. Businesses must always improve!",

It is a no name advertisement little pizza establishment in the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino they all say.  Well being when I stayed in the Cosmo for two night, I had Secret Pizza 4 times within 48 hours.  Maybe it was the dough or the awesome staff which kept me coming back but I was sold on the first bite.  I love NY style pizza and all the way in the desert thousands of miles from NY, NY, come a slice secretly made with imported NY water.  Try the white slice and tipping big helps you skip through the line.  dp",

Line was quick to come go and order.   Simple enough menu one or multiple topping pizzas. Calzone and a Sicilian pizza were also available. Most basic pizza ready. Custom or added topping only a few minutes for slice. All slices had to be reheated for variety of toppings on hand. Irregardless of pizza order, all slices reheated. Still good not great and not so heavy. Priced like the other small pizza places around.   We ordered and shared a Sicilian deep dish enough for two persons. Pepperoni, sausage, olive among deep stack of melted cheese. Good flavor. Reheated correctly and good on a budget.   Overall enjoyed the quick grub. Great on budget. Okay on flavor. Hearty are the slices. Would likely come back. Only three stars as the slice is already made and reheated. Not as fresh as can be and service was okay. Nothing too stellar.",

The placement of the hallway leading into the restaurant looks like it could've led into an exit or restroom, but the walls are decorated with jazz and big band albums from the 50s-70s.  You can't go wrong with either a white pizza or a classic cheese with any toppings of your choosing! I got a mushroom topped single slice and later tried the white. Garlicky, flavorful, YUM.

You may even giggle here and there with some of the selections you may see. Once surpassing the hallway, you enter this white room which can probably fill up to 20 people max. It is pretty much cafeteria style where you choose what slices are laid out in front of you, will warm it up, and then serve it to you. I recommend their white pizza. OMNOMNOMz. I could just gobble the whole pie. What I don't recommend? The supreme pizza. It pretty much tastes like a Costco combo pizza, which I'm not hating. However I'd rather spend $1.99 on a slice of that in Costco than at Secret Pizza. Lastly, you MUST order a slice of cheesecake. MUST. Their cheesecake is mind-blowingly amazing. I'm not a fan of cheesecake as it is very dense, but they brought it to another level. Very light, crumbly, sweet, melts in your mouth dessert. Every time I go to Vegas I will come back just for this slice of cheesecake.",

    "text": "While in Vegas, I was really hankering for some pizza and found on TripAdvisor something called Secret Pizza. It is more of a well-known secret than a best-kept one and I really wanted to try it!  After dinner with a good friend, a few shows, some gambling, daiquiris from Fat Tuesday and a Bellagio water show behind me, I finally made my way to Secret Pizza around 1am. This was probably a bad idea because it's the time everyone starts getting out of clubs and lining up for pizza as well!  Secret Pizza is located inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel, on the 3rd floor behind the free pool table, and I'm not gonna lie, I got a little lost finding it. If not for Yelp and TripAdvisor, I probably would've never found it.   Right away, I noticed a fat line of drunken people in the hallway and thought \"great...\" The line was actually moving reallllly slow and the hallway was as loud as a market. A lot of people also came from Marquee nightclub in the same hotel, making the line twice as long by 2am.  After about 40 minutes, I was starting to wonder if I really wanted pizza that badly but by now, the line was starting to move and I was almost to the front.    Once I actually got to order, I got about 4 slices to bring back for people at the hotel, two pepperoni and two white sauce (which Yelp said was the best flavor). The pepperoni was really good but the white sauce was extremely tasty!  A little heavy for thin pizza (there was a lot of grease) but it's late night food, so what do you expect? Next time though, I think I'll line up a little earlier and beat the crowd. Maybe buy a whole pie to share.   For 4 slices, it came out to about $20, kind of pricey but cheap for Vegas.   If you do get pizza after midnight though, make sure to bring something to do or go with lots of people to keep you company since it is a long, long wait.",

Awesome staff are super friendly and ready to whip up your slice of choice and toppings. I love the old video games but too small of an area to play them. Plus I was too busy stuffing my face with greasy pizza! Mmmm. So glad we found this place.",

Mostly thin crust, but I think they do offer Sicilian style.  I've tried their pepperoni and cheese - I'm indifferent to either one. The pizza that gives this four stars is the White pizza (Ricotta, mozzarella, and herbs). This is probably the only one that will keep me coming back.   It's wonderfully greasy, chewy texture of melted cheese, and the salty, garlicky goodness makes the pizza addicting.  NOTE: It can get packed...be prepared to stand in line for a while if you hit a busy period.",

It's even better the next day. A whole pie can easily feed 4-5 people. I know this because 5 dudes from New York came in and ate the whole thing! Yes, it totally reminded them of pizzerias from their home town of NYC! That says a lot!  Yeah, you can have the high end stuff outside of this place, but the satisfaction will be the same and the pizza will be cheaper! You'll love it! Trust me! If they added more seating, 5 stars easy!",

    "text": "This review begins my mini project of reviewing all the pizza by the slice places on the strip and maybe one on Fremont. I decided to start here because Secret Pizza is my all time favorite. It's just good, trust me. Its the kinda good you don't have to be drunk for, the kind that makes you want a few slices or a whole pie.  Ok, so one thing that's totally awesome about Secret Pizza is the fact that you can add ingredients to the slices. I almost always add ricotta cheese to mine, unless they have a slice with it already. I see people adding onions and peppers etc etc. Still just as fast, but freedom to customize... Huge plus.   They also offer a white slice which is excellent, but a tad garlicky... Just a tip for those trying to pick up a date afterward ;)  they usually have a wide variety of slices to choose from, and like I said you can add on ingredients.   The price point is typical of the strip.. I usually pay around $6 for my slice with 3+ ingredients. It's a large slice and it fills me up, though I do see many people with 2 slices.   I think the value is good... And the line is almost always long. This is my pizza of choice on the strip..by a long shot.",

Ironic that the place is called Secret Pizza, because if the line at 3am is any indication, someone just told everyone about this place. Luckily, both times I went we beat the rush... or should I say set the trend (since a huge line formed right behind us both times hehe). I've had two types of pizza here the White Pizza and two item combo of Sausage and Pepperoni. The White Pizza is my fave, its toppped with ricotta and mozzarella cheese, and we usually add sausage to it. I like how there is absolutely no advertisement of the place on the Cosmopolitan website. But I guess they try to keep it a secret for those who have yet to find it. I have to admit, it was quite an accomplishment when we stumbled upon secret pizza.",

Go try it for yourself. If you can find it....   It's on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. Just go up the escalators by the Liberace Rhinestone Rolls Royce on the first level or the escalators by the All Saints store on the second level. Look for the pool tables and there will be a hallway lined with vintage record album covers. It's next to a sushi restaurant.   The service is always quick and friendly. The prices are a little steep for pizza and a drink. Almost $20 for 2 slices and 2 sodas.   Please try this please and tell me if I'm wrong! If this is not the best pizza you've ever tasted...let me know where I can find better pizza!!",

We were walking around the casino and noticed a long line down a small dark hallway. We decided to poke our heads in to see what this commotion was all about. It turns out it was PIZZA! At this point we already ate our dinner but we decided.. What the heck, lets get in line and get a slice! We waited in line for approximately 20 mins until it was finally our turn. We ordered 3 slices of the white pizza.  While waiting in line we were thinking. Why are we waiting in this long line for a slice of pizza in Las Vegas when we are from NY. The state of the BEST PIZZA IN THE US. We were surprised, but this place was EQUALLY as GREAT as the pizza from back home! It was $4.50 for a slice and worth every single penny!! Being in Las Vegas it was comforting to have a taste of home in a hidden pizza parlor in The Cosmopolitan. I cant wait to head back to LV next year. This will be our first stop next time!!",

Obviously being said \"best pizza ever\" I must try it for myself.   It was inside the cosmopolitan and it was sure hard to find. It was also my first time stepping in Cosmo and it was really pretty chandelier looking hotel. Definitely a plus for the location for the pizza place. As we were walking we almost passed it because it was inside a hallway, would've passed it if it weren't for some guy coming out with a box of pizza. (Mmm pizza...)  We went at 3AM(they close at 5!) my boyfriend and I both got a slice of pizza. I believe it was $5-$6 which is decent and the size wasn't bad either. Only problem was it was a bit overly oily, like you can see the blotch of oil on top of the pizza. So I had to put a napkin over it to soak it up. When I took a bite into it, it was a damn good pizza, the crust was even good and I don't usually like it. Overall, the pizza may be the best I've had in Vegas. I wish there was one where I live.",

    "text": "As someone who grew up around NYC, I know good New York Style Pizza. And this fits the bill perfectly. The thin crust has that nice crack to it when you fold it and is crispy enough to hold the end up in a triangle so you can eat on the go. The wait wasn't bad when we went, under 20 minutes from the middle of the unmarked hallway on a Saturday night. That makes me think that unless a ton of folks are ordering whole pies, even a line out the door is under an hour.  I applaud them for not offering ranch - that's some weird midwest or west coast topping that folks put on pizza to mask how awful it is. Unnecessary for NY Pizza!  $5 a slice seems pretty shocking at first, but it is in a hot casino in the heart of Las Vegas Blvd, so I won't hold it against them. $4 for a Coke in a Solo cup is lame, so we bought the 2L bottle for $6.50. What a markup!",

Okay, I think it's, what, $4-$5 for a slice of pizza.  So what?  Order a whole one for under $30 and you can split it with your friends and get the most of your money.  Their crust is SO GOOD.

Each slice is huge though~ so you should be good after 2 slices, but I guess it all depends how hungry you are ;)   During the 3 nights we stayed in Vegas, my friends and I went to this place 3x!  Of all the different pizzas I tried, the tomato, ricotta, sausage, pepperoncinis one was my favorite!!!! It was absolutely delicious. My mouth is watering just thinking about it ;P",

    "text": "The best slice of pizza in Vegas.  Lines vary wildly, so there is an element of luck beyond arriving at odd times.  Personally I don't like waiting for much of anything in Vegas (there is so many options, just keep walking and you'll find something else).  The usually have a lot of good options and note there are additional options hiding just below what is on display.  So if you don't see what you want, it's worth asking what else they have.  The charge by the slice and number of toppings, so it's not usual to see pizzas with lots of random toppings (hence higher price) on display while plan pepperoni is hiding underneath.  Ordered: 2 Slices of Pepperoni Pizza  Overall: Best slice of pizza in Vegas.  Finding the place is part of the fun.  In my picture, the entrance to the pizzeria is right in the background (third floor of Cosmo, walk straight ahead after getting off escalators from second floor)",

It's been a good two years since my last trip to Sin City and I'm proud to say that it's still the real deal! I took a girlfriend here with me on our first night and at 3am it was still open and still in the same spot on the 4th floor of the Cosmo. She marveled at how there's no signage, no listing, and I replied \"That's why it's a SECRET! Lol\" Even at 3am there's a long line but thankfully everything moves pretty quickly. True to Vegas party scene everyone in line with us was pretty much wasted and the folks behind us were obnoxiously drunk.   We finally got to the front and the pizza guy chit chatted with us about what slices they were offering at that time. I honestly marvel at how nice everyone is at Secret Pizza because if I had to deal with all the tomfoolery I don't think I'd be nearly as patient. We each got two slices and a Coke to go. The prices have gone up from $3.50 to $4.75 per slice with an additional $.50 per topping. Still not so bad when you consider that you're in a very touristy area and it is 3am.   Overall still a really great experience and literally a \"hidden\" gem on the Las Vegas Strip. We came back the next night again for Secret Pizza as we were hanging out at the bar and my girlfriend came back a third time the next night because she wanted to make sure she got another slice before we headed back home! Now THAT is some gooooood pizza folks! May you be very lucky during your trip to Vegas and may your stomach be blessed with the deliciousness of Secret Pizza!!!",

Hard to find- go upstairs when you are in the Cosmo and it's in an alleyway across the way from STK. If it's 2am or later, expect to wait awhile in line. If you want to order a whole pizza, add an extra 45 min to your wait.   Each slice of pizza is a little over $6. Yes, they are not the smallest pieces of pie, but goodness, I was still hungry after one. The pizza itself, I will repeat, is good but NOTHING SPECIAL.   For the combined wait, hype, quality and price- I bestow 3 stars to you, Secret Pizza. Its number one pro being that it is open late.",

Of course I got a slice of the white pizza and a slice of mushroom. 2 slices, $10.50. Not super cheap, but average.   After being heated, they were super oily, you have to dab and dab to get all the grease off. The pizza was good, the white pizza a little heavier, lots of ricotta, but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. I personally like ASONY in San Jose way better. My friend wasn't impressed either. Maybe our expectations were too high, but I can see this is the place to go if you want some pizza after a day/night of drinking.",

That explains the name of the shop, duh? It's in its own alley way between 2 restaurants. Pretty cool I'd say.   Pizza slices were huge, but since I went with a group we decided to get a whole pie for $28 which was a better deal anyways. We had sausages as our topping. The pizza was freshly baked, served super hot which was nice. The crust was crispy  and thin, not super doughy which I liked. Quite oily though I must say - I had to use napkins to tap out some of the oil on top of the pizza. You can sprinkle some chili flakes and extra cheese on top, just bare in mind the chili flakes were actually quite spicy. Overall the pizza was tasty! A good pizza joint if you want to grab a quick bite.",

We go into the Cosmopolitan, look for \"Pizza\" or something like it on the directory, and NOTHING! No mention of anything regarding pizza. So we went to ask, and they said 3rd floor. We take the escalators, go through the Marquee stampede of people, and see nothing related to pizza! My boyfriend was pissed haha I asked a hostess from a restaurant and she took us right to the long hallway.  Lined on the walls with old vynil record art, a 20+ foot long hallway will lead you to a vintage arcade machine and VOILA! PIZZA!   The slices are pretty big, BUT the prices could be better considering how thin they are!   Seating areas are very limited! They have bars where you can just stand at and then about 4 stools (first come first serve!)  We had slices from pies already made which were of mushrooms and one of tomato with ricotta.  Also ordered a diet coke, which was $4 yet came in one of those red plastic cups you buy for parties.  They were good, yes, pretty good!  How do you really judge a pizza? Hmm... I guess I like mine thicker and saucier and cheesier, so these were just alright and I probably won't go again :-(  Womp womp wooooomp",

Admittedly, it IS one of the more affordable and accessible food options at the Cosmopolitan. it used to be a hidden pizza bar, but with their increasing popularity, it's not so secret anymore (especially with the huge line congregating by the entrance).   After the near 45 minute wait in the dimly lit hallway, we finally made it inside. You choose a slice, and they reheat it in the oven for you. The slices are a good size, but very salty. Seating inside is near nonexistent, so be prepared to eat your pizza standing up.  Aside from the price and location, there is nothing particularly special about this place. I'd eat it again in a pinch, but definitely not my first choice.",

Outside the long hall there are a few random seats by the pool table. If you thought seating was brutal snagging some napkins can be a lottery.

There will be a line, but you will still have trouble finding it. It is down a very mysterious hallway right beside the sushi joint. It is truly tiny, but so perfect after a night of debauchery! There are just a few seats and a couple of pinball machines inside. Luckily, there are couches and a pool table right outside.  You can get pizza by the slice or wait for an entire pie. They continually crank out the pizzas here. The meatball and pepperoni is one of my favorites. Their sauce is delicious and the crust is thin. This is the type of pizza that you definitely have to fold in half to eat. There will be grease, but True New York pizza is also greasy. The meatball is so flavorful and fantastic. I do find the pepperoni to be a bit too spicy for my taste, but I like that it is not the generic circular pepperoni. Last night I had the opportunity to try a white slice, which was good and garlicky but seemed a little more like cheese bread and a little less like pizza, which is always a risk with white pizza.   There aren't tons of options, just your basic slices. It is cheap for the strip, but actually a tad pricey at $5 a slice! The pizza is good, but you would only be paying $2 in New York. It is fun to be in on the secret and if I need a late night snack on the strip I know exactly where to come.",

My favorite here is the white pizza (it has ricotta cheese). Add a sprinkle of red pepper flakes and the pizza is perfect!  The wait can be long depending on when you go, but there have been times when I waited only a few minutes bc it was an off time (e.g., 5PM). Pies/whole pizzas can't be ordered while in line (esp. when they are busy), so if you're interested in getting a whole pizza I recommend calling ahead.",

    "text": "\"Secret Pizza\" (I believe this is an unofficial name...right?) is located down an unmarked hallway on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo.  I felt silly asking someone, \"Excuse me, where is Secret Pizza,\" but thankfully he was in on it and directed us there.  Walk down the 30 foot hall and you're transported from the glitz of the Cosmo into what looks like a small-town pizza joint.  There are no tables (just a couple counter spots) and the decor consists mainly of 2 pin ball machines.  I just had a cheese slice. (Slices are $4.75, + 50 cents for each topping. Standard Vegas prices, but I could've easily turned those 5 bucks into $5,000 on slots).  The pizza is very good, similar to a slice you'd get in New York.  The one problem we had is that our slices were not heated up enough, and were on the cool side of lukewarm.  I don't think there's any reason for Secret Pizza to be a \"destination\"...but if you're staying in the hotel or happen to be passing through, it's a good spot for a slice.",

And we found Secret Pizza so we hurried our butts over to The Cosmo. The narrow hallway (Vegas narrow) in between 2 big restaurants was the dead give away. There were a lot of people in there but the line went super quick. I got the pepperoni, sausage and meatball pizza. I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!!! No wonder people say it's the best pizza!!! It REALLY is the best pizza in Vegas. It's worth any amount of time you have to wait for it. If you get there right when they open, THATS the best time to go! It's so fresh and it tastes even more amazing!!! And, best of all, the price was right!!! Pizza ranges from $4-$8 for a slice!! We've decided we're going to eat there at least twice every time we come to Vegas! Great find and perfect for people on a budget in Vegas!!!! THANKS SECRET PIZZA!!!!",

Located next to the sushi restaurant, it's well hidden and literally a hole in the wall since there are no signs that direct to it. Once you see the pinball machine in the alley then you have found it!  Well it's a cool spot, they have two pinball machines at the front. The pizza is really great and they're open until 5 in the morning. This is one of the True hidden gems on the Las Vegas strip and the pizza is affordable which is great considering how expensive the food on the strip can be.  Highly recommended!",

After eating such expensive lunches/dinners at the strip, it was definitely refreshing to find a pizza place for $3 per slice! I mean it's still pretty pricey but hey - it's vegas! But the pizza was amazing and delicious! I ordered two slices and I thought it wouldn't fill me up, I was wrong! The slices are pretty big and it fills you up quickly!   The place is nothing fancy and there are barely any chairs in the restaurant. They pretty much warm up your pizza and serve 'em on paper plates. The drinks are uber expensive though, I think 3 bucks for a cup of soda or whatnot.   It's also all kinds of shocking that this pizzeria is tucked away at the Cosmopolitan Hotel and it's on the 3rd floor.   Next time I visit vegas, I will definitely have to stop in here for some pizza!  I can definitely see why this place is rated 4.5 on YELP.  The atmosphere is very chilled/relax. There's even a pinball machine for you to play a game while you wait for your pizza.   You definitely have to stop by if you have never tried this place before!",

I stayed at the Cosmo my last trip to Vegas and since we got there around 230 pm in the afternoon, we wanted something to eat that wasn't too heavy.  Well, since I read about this place on Yelp, I decided i had to try it.  We went down to the second floor and had to ask around a bit to figure out where it was, third floor, across from the pool table.  The hallway to enter is filled with old pictures, you gotta walk all the way down and be transported to a New York style pizzeria.  You can order the whole pie or by the slice with whatever they have that day.  I had the meat lovers while K had the pepperoni and mushroom.  The pizza is thin, can get a little greasy but oh so good.  Crunchy, salty, with the perfect blend between sauce, cheese and toppings.  This is what New York style thin pizza should be like.  The prices are ok, about $5-6 per slice, something you expect in Vegas but since it's open practically all day, great place for a snack.  If i wanted something to fill up with in Vegas without the extreme Vegas prices, this is my go-to",

    "text": "First off I must give you directions on how to find this place because it took me forever! This place is inside the Cosmopolitan on the third floor. Once you exit the elevator you walk straight out and you'll see a tiny alley way on your right. There are no signs. This place is not listed in the directory. It is truly a \"secret pizza\" place. Walk down the alleyway and it will lead you to the best kept secret in Las Vegas!  Once you get inside you will notice it is a very small place. There's no waiter service. There's very little room for you to sit and eat. You might think to yourself \"WTF? This is just like any other hole in the wall pizza joint\". But don't let that fool you!   This was my first time here. I only came here upon my friend's recommendation. I decided to skip the fancy buffet to try something new. When I first walked in I have to admit I was a bit disappointed. I was expecting a large fancy pizza place. I thought to myself \"why is this place so popular?\". There were no signs that said \"we're famous for blah blah blah\". So I asked the employee what they were famous for. The guy told me this place is famous for it's \"White Slice\".  I recommend getting the white slice with pepperoni. The original white slice itself will not come with any meat or toppings. The flavor and taste of the white slice is quite unique. It is something other pizza places do not offer. It is a taste unlike any I've ever tasted before. If I had to describe it in words I would say cheesy, garlicky, and damn good! All I can say is you have to try it to believe it. After the first bite I understood why this place is so great when it comes to pizza.",

It was neat to be able to grab a slice at a drunken hour to get some energy for the next adventure. Slices were reasonably priced, if you want to sit down to eat there are a handful of barstools inside the pizza joint, but there are also chairs to sit on the second floor.   The pizza - it was okay. We got pepperoni and vegetarian. I think our mistake was not trying the white sauce pizza. I am guessing that is what all the raves are about. Next time I will try the white sauce pizza.",

Most of the times I've had ricotta it's usually a little bland with not a creamy texture but this! This was different!

We had heard rumours that best cheap eats was at this place, so we set off towards The Cosmopolitan in search of it. This place definitely lives up to its cool, speakeasy, \"only know if you know\" vibe. We couldn't find it at first, but we ran into this cool couple who pointed us in the right direction( look for a hallway with old music records on the same floor as Milk).  When we found it, a casual counter-style restaurant awaited. Fair warning, this place is very small so if it's late night and crowded, be prepared to take your pizza to go and eat out in the Cosmo's lobby area. I ordered the special of the night--- a sausage and ricotta slice-- which totaled to $5 (STEAL ON THE STRIP). My goodness, that slice was heaven--- crust was on point(NY style), the ricotta was fresh, and the sausage was the perfect amount of spicy. The slices are pretty big but if you're Strip Party hungover hungry, perhaps get two.",

Once you see a hallway with pictures, you know it's for this place. Not only that, you can smell the pizza fuming in the hallway.  The pizza slices are large. The slices are heated in the oven before serving you. The pizza isn't overly salted like domino's or pizza hut. It has a crispy crust. It does its job. Now, there is limited seating so be prepared to eat standing up or taking back to the room.  There are a lot of people coming in and out at all different times of the day so there will be times that it is crowded to even stand as people are wild when drunk. Besides that, this place has decent pizza with late night times and the grease is increased for hangover help.  If you're staying at the Cosmopolitan, then this is a good late night choice.",

Not enough toppings for what they charge but whatever. Even the leftover slice was good eaten cold the next day. Remember to season your slices with oregano shaker.

    "text": "Deliciously cheap! With all of the other options in the Cosmopolitan being fancy restaurants, it was a nice surprise to land on Secret Pizza. With no sign out front it's easy to miss, but check out the photos here and you will see which signs to look for upon arrival. Also, it's obviously not that big of a secret if 5 of my Yelp friends from all over the country have all reviewed it before me. In any case I found myself here after arriving in Vegas starving from a morning flight with only Bloody Mary and light snacks to tide me over. My friend (the bachelorette) gets super hangry when she hasn't had food so we were on a mad dash to fill her tank.   The nice folks at check-in directed us to Secret Pizza and we pretty much ran over to it. At 4:30pm there was next to no line and the people working there were super friendly. We each had two slices - me the mushroom slice and white pizza, my bff a pepperoni and white pizza. We both ordered a bottle of water to go with our food and sat down after paying the $30 total for everything. That's nothing to scoff at when the other options for sit-down meals would have easily been double that. Anyway, we sat for a minute, chowed down, and then made our way back to the hotel room to setup for the weekend.   The bride to be went down for a nap and I began unpacking and setting up as I noticed a rumbling in my tummy. It should be known that I am lactose intolerant and sometimes get stomach-aches when I have too much ice cream, or milk in my coffee, but I don't usually have issues with cheese. That evening I had major issues with whatever was in my pizza slices - I have to imagine it was the ricotta or whatever else was in the white pizza. That is the reason this is a 3-star review instead of a 4-star one. My friend wanted to go back there the next day but I had to pass after the pain I suffered the day before.",

    "text": "Secret Pizza may be the worst kept secret in the Western World; even worse than the \"secret menu\" at In-N-Out Burger.    The myth of secrecy now completely debunked, let's start with directions to Secret Pizza: Take the elevator near the Cosmopolitan's Chandelier Bar to the 3rd floor. You'll see a lounge with a pool table in front of you when the elevator doors open. Make a hairpin turn (hard right) as you exit the elevator and you'll see a short hallway completely plastered with vintage record album covers; this is the hallway that leads to Secret Pizza.  They serve three kinds of New York style pizza here: white, red, and Sicilian.  On my most recent trip to Sin City, I visited Secret Pizza twice - once on Friday night and once on Saturday afternoon.  On Friday night the line was all the way down the hall; we waited for over an hour to get to the counter.  On Saturday the wait was really short, but they were out of Sicilian :-(  The main idea behind my Saturday visit that trip had been to try the Sicilian, but they were all out when we got there!  However, both the red and the white pizza were surprising good, so my pizza Jones and I made due.  I ended up trying the red and white slices both times.  The toppings I chose were Sausage and Pepperoni on the red slice, and sun-dried tomatoes on the white.  On my Saturday visit I added garlic to the red and the white; both are MUCH better with garlic!    Let's talk about the pizza in detail.  The classic NY pizza is a simple slice of cheese pizza that's shaped and sized a certain way, with the crust discernibly thicker on the edges.  It's also got to have what I like to call \"independent suspension\".  This means that even with a decent load of toppings, the crust most be firm enough to eat with your hands either as-is, or folded in half.  The crust at Secret Pizza is totally legit; it's shaped exactly like NY pizza is supposed to be shaped and it's got wonderful independent suspension.  The toppings are premium; super-sized, and very tasty, and the crust is chewy, not soggy, and tastes great.  Strangely enough, the pizza was better on the Friday night when the line was colossal; the slices didn't get cooked enough on Saturday, even though the lines were short.  The slices were still pretty darn good though.  Despite how exceptionally busy the staff is, they're efficient, good humored, and informal.  How informal?  I brought my own bottle of wine and asked about a corkage fee; the dude behind the counter just handed me a corkscrew and said, \"go for it!\"",

As the name suggests, this is a \"secret\" place; there are no signs to help you find it.   The hallway to the place is lined with records, which gives it a cool vibe. The place itself is cozy; there is a raised bar along the walls with stools for you to sit and eat your pizza. The slices are generous in size and there are condiments (parmesan cheese, pepper flakes, garlic powder, etc). If you are in Vegas for a few days, this isn't a bad place to grab a quick bite to eat for lunch.",

I definitely recommend calling ahead to order a whole pizza rather than waiting in line and I normally do this. Last night, I went in to pick up an order I called in an hour earlier, and they did not have my order. And then the situation escalated- I spoke with the manager and rather than fix the situation, security was called and I was escorted out. At the time, I was explaining to the manager that I had placed an order and he kept repeating that they don't have an order ready for me to pick up, told me to go wait in line to order and essentially accused me of lying about placing my order in the first place. I have never experienced such rude management in my life. I get that they are busy and have a long line, but if your staff makes a mistake, rather than accusing a customer of lying, they should probably apologize and fix it. After explaining my situation to security, the security guard apologized for how rude the management was, but unfortunately, he couldn't do anything to remedy it and I was left without any pizza at the end of the night. I will NEVER be coming back here after this incident and I am really disappointed in how horribly rude both the manager and staff were.",

If you peer through the hallway and see a red pinball machine, you've found yourself some bomb ass pizza.  Don't worry about the toppings, it's not about the toppings here. It's about the crust and the sauce, both of which this little pizzeria knocks out of the park.  The sauce on this pizza is perfectly seasoned, and there's just the right amount. But the best part is the hand-tossed crust. People usually like thin crust because it's crispy. People usually like pan crust because it's doughy. THIS crust manages to be crispy AND doughy. We figured that one large (10 slices) was enough to feed 5 of us (3 girls, 2 guys), but this pizza was so good that we had to order another large to go.  The prices here are a bit steep ($4 for a 2-topping slice, $22 for a 3-topping large), but the premium price will definitely get you some premium pie.",

That only makes it all the more authentic to me. Just enough attitude to make it interesting but not enough to annoy you. That's why I keep coming back.   So a slice will (as of this writing) run you about $5, which ain't cheap for pizza. But it's very well made, slowly baked and they'll reheat it for you without even being asked. So I knocked off one star for pricing but in fairness, they DO give you a free cup of water if y ou want it. Also keep in mind it's standing room only and no place to sit but plenty of counter space to stand and eat along the walls.   Love the atmopshere, 80s music often blaring in the background with a few vintage arcade games from that era as well. It's like a time warp back to my teen Generation X years and I love it. Some great art and photos on the wall as well. All in all, a lot packed into a little place.   Definitely stop by this place - if you can find it. But finding it is half the fun.",

The drinks were in Red Solo Cups, and I'm pretty sure they were $4-5 each for one fill up. We left hungry. We bought drinks at a downstairs shop, and made a note to never come back.",

    "text": "- No sign telling you where you are.  - Open until 5 AM. - They sell PBR dispensed in red cups - The irony of having a restaurant that sells $5 slices of NY style pizza next door to places like Jose Andres' Jaleo and Estiatorio Milos. - Limited amount of seating.  Everything about this place screams hipster, and normally I would avoid places like this like the plague, but turns out that it's pretty damn good. Someone bought a whole pizza for the room, and after we come back from the clubs at like 6 in the morning, I find a half-eaten, cold slice of pepperoni and sausage buried under some paper...still amazing. This pizza passes with flying colors on the time test.  Later...instead of eating at Jaleo, I get a strong hankering for pizza. Hot and fresh out of the oven...effing delicious.",

Tucked back away around a corner of the third floor escalator that looks like a hallway to the restroom, one can tell you have found the correct place by the sweet, bready smell of freshly baked pizza, not quite New York-style pies and slices.  If you have three people who can agree on toppings, it's cheaper to get a complete pie and have possibly leftover for snacks in your hotel room or post-strip party \"hair of the dog\" recovery meal.  A good find if you can get to it.",

I would say, yes try this place no matter how long the wait is. Deep dish pep. And Supreme slice,with 1 drink $18. No sharing, slices are not that huge,good size. OH man the deep dish was on a sour dough bread,crunch bottom. Must try!",

It's good when you're sober, but even better when you're drunk. TRUST, it looks kinda plain (my initial thoughts) but it's packed with flavor. The ricotta cheese is super creamy and the garlicky goodness is what makes this slice of pizza one of my all time favorites. The only thing is that one slice is about 6 bucks or so, so I only get it once in a while. I've also had a build-your-own with red sauce and it's good, but not as good as the white pie. The line can get long sometimes, especially at night, but just know that the wait is sooooo worth.",

    "text": "My absolute favourite pizza place in the world. Well, I have not been to Italy to try real pizza. But this is so far the best pizza I have.   I am actually not a big fan of pizza, more for weight watch reason. So I want it good when I have to spend my calories on it. And this worth every bite as much as every single calories on it. My favourite is their sausage jalapenos pizza. It's just simple, thin crust and so so so flavorful. I don't even understand what they put in there. I like that the crust are crispy and thin, yet the pizza is still very moist. With the pamasen and chilli flakes, I can eat half a pizza if I have burn it out in marquee dance floor before hand.   Being said, it is in the comospolitan hotel, on the 3rd floor, above marquee. If you look for the escalator by all saints, you pretty much just walk straight once you are on the 3rd floor and look for an entrance that has lots of vinyl covers on the wall. Love how hidden and low key it is but yet it's such an popular place. So they close at 5 am, but the worker there says, don't come at 5 and count on it. It will be either super packed with people with ling out of the door because of the after clubbing hunger or it would be very slow that they decided to close early. So if you don't want to miss your late night pizza, come no later then 4 am. So hungry just thinking about it again.",

I'll decode it for you: 3rd floor where the pool table is, look for the hallway dressed in album covers & voila! Secret Pizza found!   The first time I came here was in Jan but since enough alcohol will erase your memory, I couldn't remember a thing about that experience...except that a certain someone I was with, in all her drunken-ness, was claiming to be heiress to the hotel & all the equally-drunk boys around us believed her...  I came here again last week, this time sober & therefore, able to write a (somewhat) coherent review.   I had a huge slice topped with mushroom for about $5. Thin crust, not too oily & dee-lish with a few sprinkles of garlic powder & crushed pepper flakes. Limited counter seats, so be prepared to eat standing up. Uncover this yummy secret for yourself!",

It's located on the third floor of the Cosmo with other restaurants (I think it's the level with a pool table on it), down the hallway with all the pictures.  There was no line and we were able to get our pizza right away. Each slice is preheated, and one of the disappointing things is that both of our slices were overly salty.  The slices were good, but no where near the hype. And not anywhere near the quality of an authentic slice from NY.  I think the slices were $5-7 each, and beer was $7-8.  The service was OK and there is virtually no seating. The atmosphere is nice (arcade games, bar top seating, etc). But the pizza was just OK. We found the slice at Flour and Barley (at the Linq) was much better.",

I looked at the cardboard box with all that oil from the pizza that I just consumed with disgust.  Also docking stars off the rating because the people who work there are extremely rude! So my friends and I were standing there debating which flavor toppings to get... then suddenly, we heard a loud pop. We soon found out that someone in the kitchen knocked down a bottle of Coke and caused it to explode everywhere (with the bottle hitting the ceiling and cap flying our way). If we only stepped one feet closer to the register, at least one of us could've been hit with the bottle cap (and maybe in the eye too!) Fortunately, our indecisive personalities saved us from harm. Then my friend looks at her clothing and found that it was splattered with Coke. During this whole time, not one of the three workers was apologetic about the situation. None of them said sorry or anything. RUDE MUCH?? At that point, we didn't want to say anything because we just ordered our pizza (so we didn't want them to spit in our pizza or do anything of that sort), but we definitely did not leave a tip and gave them the death stare as we were walking out (after we got our pizza).   So get your act together, because soon enough, you'll be fired. Just sayin'",

Yeah, this pizza got that pizza \"juice\" (not grease).  Cheesy, greasy, and deletable meatball topping.  Yum!

The other pizzas looked just as amazing. pizza was a little on the greasy goodness side. The thin, NY style crust was tasty but not spectacular.

    "text": "Last week, New York Firefighters retired in Las Vegas were talking about the best New York pizza in Las Vegas while planning a Sept. 11 Event. Many NYFD insisted, \"We drive and wait in line for the Sicilian pizza in a hole in the wall at Cosmopolitan outside of Marquee.\" Wait? Stand in line? Deal with traffic along Las Vegas Strip? The firefighters insisted the pizza at Secret Pizza was the best at the same level as Bambino's Pizzeria in Summerlin. There was even a little dispute. Cosmopolitan or Summerlin? I went directly to Marquee on Saturday night. The line was 45 minutes for a slice. Plus there were guys and girls standing in line from Texas, people approaching me in Marquee asking me about the pizza, and there were other restaurants like Egg Slut, Wicked Spoon, still diners wait almost an hour for a slice from Cosmo's Secret Pizza. Two customers said the quality of the cheese and toppings - Large, round slices of pepperoni, salami, sausage, thick mushrooms covering the top so you cannot see the cheese or white - The entire top of the mushroom slices were mushrooms. These people had money. Marquee is not cheap. Yet they stood in line for Secret Pizza. These customers gambled tens of thousands of dollars, there are dozens of restaurants with award winning chefs, but the chefs leave their restaurants to eat at Secret Pizza. Secret Pizza is an adventure. Each slice you taste becomes party of the Las Vegas experience as if Hunter S. Thompson ate inside while writing his famous novel, \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\". Go to eat at Secret Pizza when you visit the Las Vegas Strip, especially if you dance at Marquee Day or Night.   Las Vegas Secret Pizza @ Cosmopolitan",

    "text": "Secret pizza is delicious. Definitely a hidden gem... Although I don't know if it is really a secret anymore, as any time I go there there's a line around the block.  I'll admit waiting in line can be fun. The late night line (the only kind I've been in) is usually filled with drunken out of Towners and club goers. Everyone is usually is fun spirits, don't expect to make laying friendships, but definitely a enjoyable way to wait for your turn.  Staff is fun & friendly, major respect to them for that. I'd hate dealing with all the drunks, if I weren't drunk myself that is. The pizza speaks for itself, simply delicious.  If you are at the Cosmo, hungry and have some time, this is the place for you.",

Other than that, I thought the photos and memorabilia on the walls was pretty cool and the waiting space was plentiful. Once you get into the kitchen area it's still a long wait. The pizza ended up being pretty delicious and a great way to cap off our late night. I'd visit again if the line was a little shorter but that's a tough feat in heels. Love the secret little finds in Vegas, this one included! :)",

My wife totally craves this place when we are in Vegas, so we try to hit it at least once per trip.  I usually try to get the meatball and she gets the sausage and mushroom.  The pizza is tasty and hot and they are usually making pizzas for take out while you are waiting for your slice.  There is not a lot of space to sit inside, but there are big couches towards the entrance where you can lounge and eat.  I would definitely recommend you go at least once.....just for the hallway of albumn covers.  I also think it is worth it because this joint is the cheapest meal at the cosmo.....  See ya there!",

Some positives, it's open really late and the pizza is decent, the crust is really good, just my opinion the red sauce could be better.   Two slices of pizza was about $13 the slices weren't that big either. But it's quick and for a pizza place on the strip overall not bad.

This was all because the review I saw on Yelp said it was on the 2nd floor... or maybe I read wrong due to the Fat Tuesday I had with me?  So yes it is on the 3rd floor, near the pool table! There is a door with no sign or anything, but behind the door there is a long walkway covered in Italian record cover art, and as you pass it, boom! Its a small pizzeria! I ordered two slices, one pepperoni and another with sausage and ricotta cheese. The pizza is very good, big slice and NY style... where you have to fold the pizza to enjoy it. The pepperoni was good but the winner for me was the sausage and ricotta. OMG. That was amazing. Next time I definitely will be ordering a box of that.  The pizzeria is again small, with a few stools to sit on and also a few pinball machines. It was fun talking to some of the people there who were also enjoying their pizza. Pricing was fairly high compared to your local pizza place (like $4-5 a slice) but hey, it's Vegas and also at the Cosmo, the \"it\" hotel at Vegas right now. A whole pizza is probably the best bet, as its around $22 for a whole pizza. Also they are open til 4am for all the drunkies! lol.  Overall, a cool \"secret\" pizza spot in Vegas! Definitely try it for some late night eats!",

We came here one late night from a friend's recommendation, whom we thought was trolling us the entire time, but it turned out that this place exists! The place was pretty packed. We waited for about 45 minutes to get our three whole pizza orders. They were sooooo worth the wait! They were NYC style pizza (we tried the Chicago one too but it wasn't that good). The slices were big and the cheese was oozing out of the pizza with every bite. It might be because we were hungry too but everyone in my group thought the pizzas were excellent! We'll definitely be back here on our next trip to Vegas!",

Like the other reviews said down a hallway lined with record covers to the left of the sushi place.   For about $4 a slice it is pretty reasonable. It is NY style pizza so it's large and thin. I thought it was okay, not the best but for the price in Vegas makes it a lot better. They do charge you just as much for a red solo cup for pop which is a little ridiculous, but I guess anywhere for drinks is pretty pricey for the most part.  If you're in the neighborhood I would stop by but wouldn't recommend going out of your way to find this place as I saw lots of equally delicious looking pizzas on the Strip.",

    "text": "Giving this 4 stars mainly because of the pizza, not so much the service.  A friend told me about the \"secret pizza\" place, so when another friend and I set up a date to meet, I suggested we try it.  Good thing that friend did some research, otherwise we may not have found it!  She knew it was near another restaurant and that it was a long hallway.  At the end of the long hallway was a pinball machine, making it look like an arcade or something.  We went down the hallway and it wasn't quite what I was expecting:  it was basically a counter with a menu board, and mostly seating facing the wall on bar stools.  For some reason I expected a sit down place, or at least something with more tables.  Fortunately we were there when it wasn't that crowded.  I found the menu a bit confusing - it sounded like you could order slices with customized toppings, so my friend and I were trying to figure out what we wanted since we didn't want to order a whole pizza.  Then we noticed that they already had pizzas ready to serve by the slice - we looked at them and decided on 3 slices:  pepperoni, sausage & mushroom, and cheese w/ white sauce.  We each also ordered a soda.  The total came out to just under $20.  We cut each slice in half, and that was a good amount of food for us for lunch.  And the pizzas were all quite tasty!  It was definitely worth it, food wise.  The service was just okay - nothing bad, but nothing good either.  I wish the menu board was easier to figure out, maybe describing the ordering process or something.  The seating area isn't that great either, and it was pretty filthy.  When we first got there, it was slow - it seems like one of the workers could have quickly wiped down the counters before it got busy again.  But, nonetheless, it was good pizza, and I'd definitely go back again (but maybe do like what some other people did and take it out into the lobby area to eat).",

I tried three joints all within an hour of each (piasonos, metro, and finally the secret pizza at the cosmopolitan.  The first one is not it, Metro had a good flavor, I would go there again. Now I get to this Unknown place in this beautiful casino nice atmosphere and chef was cool. Well the pizza had a nice crust which is one of my favorites. I had the white pizza with the different cheeses, the flavor was a little short of what I was hyped up on, but I can say I wasn't mad. I should have chosen something I could give a more honest opinion on like plain cheese or pepperoni. I'm sure I would've liked one of them, but I'm not that happy reading reviews and being hyped up on what other people are bragging so much about, being that I'm a Chicago native and I know real pizza. Maybe next time I come to Vegas I'll try one of the other styles of pizza to give this a more reasonable review.",

No name, no sign, just a hallway loaded with framed photos and first thing you see at the end of the hall are 2 pinball machines and a flat screen tv hanging from the wall. At first I thought this was one of those casino arcades but my sister assured me theres a pizza place inside. Going all the way in, sure enough it's there. Pretty small area, no frills, one of those menu boards where you can snap plastic letters onto it. Board did mention they have house made pickled peppers but didn't try those. One downside there was no open view of the toppings or posted anywhere unless I totally missed it. They sell by the slice or 16\" whole pies so they had a few pies you could see over the counter. The sausage and pepperocinis on white sauce looked intriguing. We ordered half of that and other half had sun-dried tomatoes. Ricotta comes on top of all white pizzas too. The pizza is NY style and it didn't disappoint in that aspect. It was very flavorful. Slices were big n floppy. Nice and thin, crust was nice and chewy. Edge crust still had a nice slight crispness on the outside. Pretty good if you're looking for a decent NY style pizza fix on or near the strip. A bit pricey($34.50 whole pie 1.5 topping)but theres not alot that isnt on the strip. White garlic sauce was good with the ricotta but I'd probably still prefer the Gilroy pizza during happy hour at Sierra Gold tavern. Especially when its only $10 for a whole 16\" during those special times and an awesome pizza to boot.",

Unexplainable, chees-y, garlic-y goodness. The entrance, without any discernable signs, \"could\" be mistaken for a line to a bathroom. But you cant really miss the club-goers carrying out their whole pie or eating a slice as they lounge on the sofas. I mean.. come on. Hence, the lines/wait can get a bit long.   Ever since my first experience, I cannot call it a night out in Vegas until I've had my Secret Pizza Fix.  I can hit up a club on the other freaking side of the strip and still take a taxi to the Cosmo to get a slice. It is safe to say I am HOOKED and hands-down my favorite pizza place in Vegas, or even LA for that matter. (suggestions for great neapolitan pizzas in the greater LA area are welcome!!!!)  FYI.. the other pizzas (cheese, pepperoni, etc.) are fine.. its just you will wish you had like.. 3 slices of the white pizza IMHO.  The Salad is pretty good too so.. if there are any vegetarians/someone on a diet in the group.. well there you go. and OMFG WTF I cannot believe I forgot about the peppers. They have the best pickled peppers so you must ask them for some.. a little bit sweet, a little bit spicy, omy~ YUMMMMMMM  I cannot wait to go back to Vegas!!

My husband is not a crust guy, so I usually eat his.    Not this time.   He ate it all.    We got a large pepperoni and mushroom pie.   Before we left we ate two slices each.    On the way back to MGM we encountered a homeless woman on the walkway between NYNY and the MGM.    We shared our pizza with her.    When something good comes into your life you must pay it forward!",

Like I said, we were starving.  We headed up the escalator to the 3rd floor and found the hallway and headed on in.  One slice for $3.75 was the most perfectly cheap and delicious appetizer to tide us over.  I mean, wow!  The slice was big and the crust was very crisp.  It tasted great!

    "text": "As many note, Secret Pizza is not so secret anymore.  But, given that it's a business and businesses need to make money, it would be my guess that being \"Known Pizza\" is preferable to the owners.  So, I'd think they're okay with the additional foot traffic.  If you are having trouble locating the hallway down which Secret Pizza is located, the smell and music help.  Additionally, you'll likely see people eating pizza near a pool table, which lets you know you're in the right vicinity.  When we arrived (Saturday around 12:15), there were already around a half dozen people either eating, ordering, or waiting.  So, given the size of the place, this made it kind of crowded.  There is a bar which circles the edge of the room, but only 6 bar stools that I counted.  This is why people leave and eat on the couches near the pool table.  I had a slice of Sicilian with sausage and a NY slice with meatball and ricotta.  These slices are not cheap when compared to other pizza joints.  A regular slice of cheese thin crust is $5.50.  Fountain drinks, served to you in a red solo cup, are $4.  But, you at least get refills, so there's that.  Both slices were good, but I preferred the thinner crust.  The crust was crunchy yet a little chewy, and the meatballs were FANTASTIC.  I want this recipe.  They went really well with the only thing I would call a bargain at Secret Pizza:  the dollar order of pickled hot peppers.  They aren't too hot, so if you don't like heat, don't be turned off on ordering them.  Nice addition to your slice.  The sausage on the Sicilian was also very good quality, and the pizza had a nice crunch on the crust.  It needed more cheese and sauce, the ratio was off.  This became more noticeable given the thickness of the slice.  I'd absolutely return, and recommend you do so as well.  It may not be so secret anymore, but a good slice of pizza is always welcome.",

Also, this is the only reasonably priced restaurant in the Cosmopolitan.  They serve large New York style slices - very greasy and delicious. Keep it mind, it's still not the authentic slices you'd expect in Manhattan. For Vegas standards, I'd give them 3.5 stars, but that's not an option here, so they get 4 stars.",

The lines get really long at night as everyone is eager to cure their late night munchies, many of them arriving straight from the clubs.  They offer New York style, thing crust pizza with the usual toppings. Slices start at $5 and +$.50 per topping. My favorite toppings are the sausage and ricotta.   Pretty solid pizza and reasonably priced.",

My gripes with this place: - Long lines and slow service (like really slow) - They were out of plain slices, and a new one was going to take 15 minutes. Too long! - I was given a sausage slice and I asked for a sausage and ricotta one instead, but once it was placed on the paper plate the guy refused to change my order. Something magical about the waxpaper on the plate perhaps that binds you to your choice. - Slices were served ice cold. - $5 for a plain slice is steep anywhere you look.  The good: - Pizza was tasty even though it was cold. - Open late. - Cool wall art. - Video games.",

We've eaten at the other restaurants and never knew that this pizza place was always there. This place is located on the 3rd floor next to the sushi restaurant. It's close by the pool table and lounge chair they have setup. You walk down a hallway with pictures on the wall to get to this place. They have a few old school video games and pinball machines to play while you wait for your food.  They have pizza by the slice and you can order a whole pie as well. We ended up getting a cheese pie to share. The boxes they used were from Shark Tank too! It's the one you can tear apart to use as plates and to make a smaller box to pack up the leftover pizza in. The pizza was pretty good. I think the next time we go back, we're going to try out the other toppings.  This place is a good find and is open pretty late. If you're in the Cosmopolitan and are looking for a quick bite to eat, definitely try this place out! Just don't get lost...",

Also don't plan on eating in because there's no seating--but most people are drunk anyways so they don't mind and head out to go find another location to eat.

Crust was somewhat without taste, and was rather soggy in the middle resulting with an inability to pick the slice up neatly. As an aside, the pinball machine didn't give me a play for the money I inserted, and the response from the guys behind the counter was a shoulder shrug. Tacky way to make another 50c on a $24 pizza. BTW: Try the pizza in the back of O'Shay's Casino (located on the strip between Flamingo and Imperial Palace.) We think the crust was tastier, crispier, and the pizza not as greasy.",

    "text": "Outstanding tip, Yelpers! Found this place hiding (as described, Cosmopolitan Level 3, unmarked hall between Blue Ribbon Sushi & Jaleo). Friendly staff, good beer (they had switched to Stone IPA from the Dogfishhead that another Yelper said they used to carry; the PBR was still there). They also have wine by the glass. Ordered a custom pie for our group; it was ready in about 20 minutes.   As remarked on by others, limited seating (& ambiance) in the venue itself, but we were able to go back out by the entrance where there are pool tables, dominoes, and other games, and put some of the small tables and chairs together for a nice meal.   Pizza was hot and tasty; obviously not going to be better than the best pizza parlors of New York, but definitely solid). It was a great way to get a good meal and a nice price while still in one of the Strip's hottest hotels.",

    "text": "It's a nice little change-up off the beaten path and it's a little refreshing to find a quick bite to grab something to eat that isn't all stuffy and overly priced. For being in the Cosmo, if you want something quick and good, yeah I could see its high rating, but I wasn't five star amazed. Upon first bite the pizza was chewy, the sauce was the right amount of tang, and I do have to admit that it is one of the best pizzas by the slice in Las Vegas ...but that was upon first bite. After those first couple of bites, the bread and crust was burnt and charred.   I tried three slices: regular cheese, ricotta cheese, and cheese with beef slices (not sausage, some other type of beef). The regular cheese was greasy enough for me to use up the entire napkin dispenser and the crust was crispy black at the ottom so 1 out of 10. The ricotta cheese was a 10/10, if all the slices were this good I would definitely give this place a better rating. The beef slice was good, kind of what you would expect so 6 out of 10. The employees were nice, it was cheap, and like a lot of other people I'm a fan of its location, album decked hallway and close proximity to the pool table and dominoes board but the pizza really was just a little off. I may have come on a bad time and I should give them another chance but still I would have to say that I would never go out of my way to the Cosmo just for the pizza but I'd have it if I happened to be at the Cosmo and craving pizza.",

Groups of women with their fancy skirts and guys over sprayed with cologne and funky shirts. You know the routine everyone is in Vegas Mode standing in line for the exclusive clubs like Club Marquee trying to bribe the doorman to let you and your friends in. If you give your brain a second to clear itself out you will notice people walking around with cheap paper plates and a huge slice of pizza. At first I didn't even notice but I kept seeing this. It was odd seeing people holding $20 drinks in one hand a slice of pizza on a cheap paper plate in the other hand. Finally, I asked the huge security guard bouncer dude what is that and he points towards a hallway that looks like a bathroom hallway in the mall. No sign and not even a clue whats down the hall I walk down this hallway and at the end a Secret Pizza place with a bunch of what looks like hand made pizzas being put in the giant oven! Suddenly I felt transported from Vegas to my old hole in the wall \"The Pie\" pizza parlor from college when I went to the University of Utah. It took me back I mean way back! I ordered a slice and a large Coke and I was smiling. Find it, eat it and smile! If you get lost ask the big guy outside.",

Go to 3rd floor of Cosmopolitan hotel and find the free pool table. Look directly across from it and you'll see a long narrow hallway next to another restaurant.  It's at the end. I ordered 2 slices with mushrooms. Expensive but the slices are huge so it's worth it. 4.50 for a bottle of water tho? Anyway, not the best pizza but damn good. Just the right amount of grease and the cheese was not runny but it was gooey. Glad I went. I got there right when they opened at 11am and it wasn't crowded which is good bc it's tiny. Only has about 4 stools and standing room for a few more. Great pizza.",

They then tried to charge us TWICE as much money for the cold pizza that they had behind the counter. The manager told us that we didn't understand their business practice. We told him that you're right, we don't understand being screwed twice as hard for cold pizza, although we would be happy to pay full price for the full cold pizza so that we could leave. Horrible service and rip off pricing for some underrated greasy and limp pizza. Order Chinese take out instead and save your time and effort!",

However the customers are very rude and the staff let 3 people cut us to \"order\" while we were ordering. What??? I didn't realize until it was over what was going on. Get a handle on your business and suggest they use the line dinguses.  Tasted okay, toppings pulled off immediately telling me it's old or not cooked enough. Crust atv the top is over an inch so the slice isn't as big as it appears. 2 plain slices = $12. ALL additional toppings are .50 EACH. Skip it. you're better off going to Joes for a whole pie. 1 cheese pizza is $26!!!   I had a headache after eating along with cramping that kept me up all night. Next morning I overslept and felt nauseated, weak and gasy.   Brace yourselves, took 3 trips to the bathroom! It was B-A-D. I have no food allergies and it was the first thing I ate in several hours so I KNOW it was the zah.

It may take you a while to find it because it's a secret, but you'll be happy to eat their pizza:)  Their pizzas are fresh made in front of you. You by the pizzas by slice and they reheat your slice as you buy them. A slice runs about $6 depending on what slice you get. A whole pizza is about $35 and a 15 minute wait. If you're wondering what's so special about Secret Pizza, I highly recommend the White Slice. The White Slice is goes really quickly! If you don't see a pizza that interests you on the counter, make sure you ask what pizzas they are hiding below the counter!!!  If you go during a busy day, you can expect to be in line for a while. There really aren't many chairs, just a few stools at a table top. Secret Pizza is more of a grab and go kind of place.",

My friends and I decided to stop by here to try out the secret pizza spot. The place itself is fairly small so there's very little seating. If you come at a busy time there will be a very long wait for you. Luckily we got there before the rush. It's not to disappoint! I got the white slice with pepperoni. The white slice is one of their famous pizzas where they don't use any tomato sauce and it tastes kind of garlicky (: I enjoyed it a lot. The only thing is that it get pretty oily and the crust is pretty dry. The pizza was pretty cheap too considering how expensive other pizza places around here are. For mine it was only $5.50. I'd consider that cheap!",

Two stools to sit at with easilly 100 people in line, sports on TV, crowded with others waiting on orders. Ordered cheese pizza for $26 which is pretty steep but considering the location I wasnt suprised.  The pizza was good but nothing to write home about.  I know they were rushed and I probably couldve had a better experience when they werent as busy but I also know I can go to leftys or verrazanos and get better pizza for half the price but nit at 1am",

The nightlife was out and about so there was a mix of people in here.  Food: We grabbed a slice of pepperoni and a slice of the great white pizza. I wasn't blown away by it. Grease was dripping for days but we were starving and this hit the spot.  Service: Walk-up and order. Depending on what slice you want it's probably already out waiting to be handed to you so I can't comment on another beyond that.  Overall: I definitely think this is a great place to grab a bite if you want something quick whether its a late night meal or you just need some drunk food.",

Don't forget to grab some red wine (box).  Seriously, this is a lot better than I am making it sound.  See, the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Vegas is the very definition of big-and-glamorous. And expensive. And fancy. And overkill, too, but the entire strip is overkill so why penalize the Cosmo for that?  That's what's cool about Secret Pizza. You walk down a hallway that is decorated with old vinyl covers for wallpaper (mostly Italian crooners, but not all). Then at the end of the hall, you end up in a hole-in-the-wall, NYC pizzeria. It's what most of the hotel isn't - unassuming, simple, and comforting in a way, but that's probably because I grew up in Queens so I spent a lot of time in places like this.  They even had a Galaga upright arcade. How can you beat that? You can't.",

The prices were pretty reasonable for the location it was at (Cosmo).  I think it is some of the best pizza I have eaten in years.    The crust has just the right chew and crisp.  A single slice would be sufficient due to the size but since we had a busy schedule planned we had to eat when we got the chance.  The cheese itself is bursting with each bite and never once bland.  It has the right amount of igredients to help curb that hunger on the strip.  The salami just oooooh damn I'm just drooling as I'm typing this up.  Screw the over priced buffets and bland drinks at the clubs - just give me another slice already!!!!!",

I love me a good slice of pizza and this pizza is out of this world! They're famous for their \"white pizza\" which is all around cheesey goodness; a must try! Recently, I had their meatball pizza that was a house made meatball combined with their white pizza. I seriously could not stop eating it even though I was stuffed! I made sure I got every last bit as it was that amazing. The meat ball topping was packed with flavor and had a nice kick. Along side with all that cheese just took it over the top. I also like to sprinkle some garlic powder on top of my pizza as they have that available along with the regular parm cheese and red chili flakes. When I found out about this place, it was definitely a Vegas trip game changer. I go out of my way to come get a slice of pizza from here. Also, it's super convenient when you're a staying at Cosmo as you can order a whole pizza to your room. Literally, so heavenly and sinful at the same time. No regrets. I love this pizza here forever and always.",

Located in the ultra-douchy Cosmopolitan Hotel (way more than a little bit of wrong), 3rd floor in between Blue Ribbon and Jaleo. Trust me, late nights this place is far from a secret as the line will stretch all the way from the counter down a really long hallway that's adorned with record covers. Naturally said line will be filled with drunken loud mouth assholes, ignore them and keep your eye on the prize and you shall me rewarded with greatness.   The service is kind of rude but I guess I would be bitchy too if I were dealing with stupid drunkards all night long. Anyways, they had Stone IPA on tap for $5, hell yeah! Now I can be a drunkard too with skunky IPA breath! Anyways you can order up huge slices of pizza from whats already on the counter or you can order a whole pie. We usually opt for the whole pie and adorn it with mozzarella, meatballs and fresh garlic, no sauce. It comes in a box, natch, but this box is super portable.. you can take your pizza to the area over by the conference rooms where there are tons of lounge spaces and not a soul around.   My gawd this pizza is amazing! The crust is perfectly chewy with just the right amount of crispiness along the edges. I love the stringy melted cheese and thick slabs of meatball in every bite. Slurping my IPA along with this killer pizza made the wait all worth while.",

If you go to the third floor of the Cosmopolitan and look for the hallway lined with old record albums, you've found it.  It's open late and is conveniently placed on the same floor as the exit for Marquee Nightclub to satisfy those late night munchies.  So plan on waiting in a line if you go during late night hours.  Pizza can be bought by the slice or whole.  Pepperoni is always a winner, but if you want something fancier, their Meatball & Ricotta is a tasty option.  Slices will range from about $5 and up depending on how many toppings you want.  Besides being one of the \"cheaper\" food options within the hotel, the pizza is actually good.  The crust is NY style, so it's thin but not too thin and with just the right amount of chewiness.  Once you eat here, it's no secret that you'll be back for more.",

I sometimes have cravings for their white pizza, cheese on a garlic white sauce, chunks of ricotta slightly melted on the crispy yet chewy crust.  You're probably going to wait.  Just be prepared for that.  It's worth it.",

Our group intended on getting breakfast from eggslut but being the line was incredibly long and the time limitation we had, we opted for pizza for breakfast.  The menu is limited. Types of pizza aren not listed on the board, you basically just look at whats available. I'm a fan of the White Pizza and the meat lover. Two slices were plenty for myself. Any more than that and you mayyy hate yourself. Heard this place is open late as well.",

For anyone who doesn't know yet, it's located on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino.  Just look for the unmarked hallway, lined with albums on the wall.  That's part of the fun that brought me here, the hunt for it.  What keeps me coming back is the decent priced pies and the great quality.  I'm no expert, but to me, this pizza is really good.  According to my cousin from Boston, it's really close to what they have there and in New York.  On this trip though, it seems the secret is out since at all times of the day and night, there seems to have been a line of people waiting to get their slice.  And they're open until 5:00 am.  A testament to the pizza they serve.  On this visit, I ordered a pepperoni, sausage, olive and bell pepper slice and a slice of their deep dish cheese pizza.  Both were as good as I remembered and I got my late night pizza fix just before the sun came up over the Las Vegas strip.  I highly recommend visiting this place, although you'll probably have to wait in line, now that someone let the secret out (wonder if these reviews had anything to do with it.  Hmmmm)",

If you go at a slightly off time the lines are a lot shorter.  It's not the cheapest, but it's a pretty good pie.  I lean towards the pepperoni with mushroom here.  Although the sausage and the meatball is good too.  You can order up a pizza based on what you want, but it's faster to see what they've already baked and then have them toss it back in to heat up so you can pay and go.    There's only a few counter seats in the place and some arcade games, so don't expect to sit and eat.",

Like most Vegas-goers, I spent a majority of my long weekend in the city inebriated in multiple ways, and it is also safe to say I was in no mood to drive and get food after two days in the area. That was when I stumbled upon Secret Pizza on GrubHub (at least, I /think/ it was GrubHub...).  The delivery was cheap, and the pizza came fast. But let me say what impressed me the most. At the risk of several suggestive jokes, it was the size! These bad boys are YUGE. I mean, this is seriously a lot of food for the price.  The pizza itself was absolutely delicious. It reminded me of many 2am stumbles down alleys in Manhattan to get a New York slice. The crust is quite thin, and ours was also pretty crispy. Yummy! It was exactly what I was looking for. I am quite boring when it comes to pizza, and we went with just plain ol' cheese, so I cannot speak to the quality of any toppings, but the white cheese pizza was rich and delicious.  In fact, this pizza was so good, we stuffed half of it into our checked bag and brought it home with us. Warmed that bad boy up the next morning and had it for breakfast. It was still better than 90% of the pizza I get in the Bay, and I wish I was kidding. I suggest you find someone who is willing to go that distance for you if you won't be in the area for awhile.",

We heard about secret pizza from a friend who went 3 times in one trip even though there are tons of other restaurants on the strip   It's a small place down an album covered hallway on the third floor of the Cosmo. There are a few spots to sit at and couple arcade machines if you want to play while waiting... or after you eat.  The slices are large, thin and floppy in typical New York fashion. I ordered a slice of the white ricottta and pepperoni. The pizza is pretty fresh but if it has cooled off a bit they will throw it back in the oven for you.  Pizza came out hot, cheesy and just the right amount of crust to hold up the large slice.   Can't wait to try more of this next time I'm in Vegas!",

I've read the zillion reviews and the enthusiasm as how Secret Pizza has the best pizza in Sin City, hmm if so, Vegas has very low standards for pizza. Okay, to be fair my slice wasn't bad, but it wasn't near mind-blowing like some say to expect. I've had New York pizzas, and yes, Secret Pizza offers NYC style. Yet, my enthusiasm stops after my second bite.   There are many positives going on here. One is the cost for the actual pizza at around $5 - $6 for a large slice. The location at the end of a dark hallway  (decorated with vintage albums) makes it cool & mysterious. It is located in the Cosmopolitan which makes it sorta easy to find. Yet, if we're talking the hype, plus the cost of the drinks, plus the taste of the pizza... hey, it was just a'right by my book.   So I enter the Cosmo and immediately ask for the secret location. Sorry not in the mood to hunt. It's on the third floor, down that dark hallway, past a few shirtless John Travolta albums, yup there's the 4,000+ reviewed Secret Pizza! So obviously no longer a secret lol. Yet, maybe the anticipation for \"Vegas' Best Pizza\" dampened my enthusiasm.  I enter with a line maybe six deep, others already ordered and awkwardly stand near the order line, some already eating away on counter tops, and a couple playing a round of pinball and eating while playing. The crew was fast, polite, and seemed happy to be there. And before you know it it's my turn. I actually already knew I wanted the White Pizza slice @ $5.75 - I heard it was \"to die for\", it was \"amazeballs\", it was \"the bomb\". I order a Mountain Dew @ $4.00. Secret Pizza does offer a limited amount of beer on tap @ $7 and up. Bottled from $6 and up. House Wine too. Yet, it comes down to the actual pizza to make the review.   After my slice is heated up I manage to find a counter spot to enjoy it! Again, it wasn't bad, my slice had good flavor, good crispiness, and it was a generous slice. But Best in Vegas? I really hope not. It was good, just no cigar. Maybe I got caught up reading too much reviews, maybe I should've just stayed with the standard Pepperoni, maybe I should have brought my own drink in... maybe, maybe.   In the end, a good New York style pizza with heavy hype. Not bad, just didn't knock my socks off! I still recommend taking that voyage down that dark hallway to enjoy pretty okay tasting pizza. Just don't expect mind-blowing and avoid the shirtless  Travolta and maybe you'll enjoy it more than I did...",

The white pizza may be the best white slice west of the Mississippi, but you can't go wrong with anything. Tonight, on what might be my 500th venture to Secret Pizza, I snagged a slice of white and an \"all meat\" slice.  The white slice is a olive oil liner bread topped with their cheese blend and dollops of premium ricotta. Personally, I think a few shakes of red pepper and for some heat and you have a slice of heaven.   The all meat was great too. The sausage had a great texture and deep flavor, the pepperoni added some fat and the meatball slices really brought the meat flavor to the party.   As far as the pizza itself: Thin crust, simple toppings, and a lot of love. The first is thin, with the perfect crisp that isn't overdone. The cheese is the right temperature but not scalding hot and the toppings all legit.  This place is a little price ($5+ for a slice w/9 toppings) but it's sandwiches between two places that could both cost you over $100 pp for a meal so considering the competition it's a steal.   Go on this adventure and experience the glory that is secret pizza.",

It's located on the third floor of the cosmopolitan right next to the sushi bar.   As expected there was a line but it moves at a pretty good pace. You can order by the slice or you can order a pie for about $28. We ordered ordered 3 slices of the pepperoni and mushroom pizza and took it back to the room to enjoy.   At first glance the pizza looks amazing but I was so disappointed in the taste. It was just a dry slice of  pizza with cheese, toppings and very little marinara sauce. I've definitely had better elsewhere :(   I think people come here for the fun of the hunt and are to drunk to notice what they're really getting. Or maybe I just received a slice from a bad batch. You should come to cross it off your Vegas bucket list but don't have high expectations unless you're really really drunk.",

A friend and I went here 12:30 on a Saturday night (geez that's so early in Vegas), and we just beat a long line of hungry people.  There's a long and narrow hallway which helps control and organize the big crowds.  I noticed that the walls were covered in vinyl record album covers of only Italian artists.  I thought it was neat.  As you inch your way closer to the cheesy goodness, you enter a very small restaurant that is packed.  You order pizza by the slice.  It was a little over $5...which is okay when everything else in Vegas is so expensive. Best way to go is get your slice, pay, and get out of there as there's no where to sit.  Your better off wandering around looking for a table/chair in the casino or walk to your hotel room (if the pizza can last that long).  It's the perfect late-night spot after a long day of shenanigans.",

No tables for sitting but there is a counter where you could eat your food.  It has an old school feel to it because of the arcade machines and memorabilia on the wall.

By this I mean it's literally hidden, and that's the most exciting thing about it. Unless you find this place on Yelp, you will only hear about it through people who frequent the strip and have spent many drunken nights waiting in the long line with tens of other people at 3 a.m., after a night of clubbing.  My boyfriend, one of my best friends, and her boyfriend, waited for about an hour around lunch time on a Friday. I can't imagine how long the line is at the early hour of two in the morning, with a bunch of drunk people who all know this is one of the few places open late. The pizza itself is a very average New York style pizza. When you finally get up to the window, you can either order a whole pizza with up to six toppings, or you can choose a slice from four already-made pizzas, alternating the toppings with each new pizza. The prices are decent here for the strip, and that's really the only other pro of this establishment. There's really no where to sit down inside, especially when it's busy, and the crust is a little dry. I would probably only return if I was really drunk and really hungry, and it would have to be so late that nothing else was open. Cool place to come across if you hadn't heard about it, though.",

Sometimes we just get the whole pizza and save the leftovers for post clubbing, or breakfast the next day. It always still tastes amazing.",

    "text": "Who doesn't love pizza?  So grab one after the club. It's literally the closest thing to Marquee after hours. Ill admit it's a cool kid hangout before or after the club since there's a pool table to play on and it's free. It's near the bathroom so that's always nice. Pizza here runs about 5 bucks a slice, you won't be breaking the bank and the slices are huge.   However the reason why I'm not in love with this place and jumping for joy is because the wait here just sucks. Since Marquee is also a day club, getting pizza here during the day takes some time as well. The pizza here is good, not great nor amazing. So I can't validate waiting in line for 30-45 for a slice of pizza. It's a long hallway and people stand in line for each other, and hungry and long waits just don't go together. They also don't serve ranch here either but it's not the end of the world.   If you're Rollin with a crew after hours then def grab a whole pie, they provide u with plates as well. Still a cool place to hang out. If you've been turning up the whole night and your drunk, I wouldn't mind waiting. But being sober... The wait for the pizza may be a bit of a disappointment",

My family wasn't in the mood for an overpriced meal, so we just wandered around the hotel looking for places to eat.  Then we saw a weird little hallway that kind of looked like it led to a bathroom, and I needed to pee so we checked it out. But luckily we found secret pizza!!  The white pizza is delicious, and all the others are as well. It's cheap for Las Vegas, and at night you just want some greasy pizza. My family ordered a couple of slices and just ate while standing in the store, but we decided to get a whole one to take back to the room, so we got the deluxe (or supreme, forgot which) pizza. It was really good! Crisp crust, even delicious the next day when it was cold.",

    "text": "If this is supposed to be a secret it must be Vegas' worst kept secret with 1900+ reviews. Officially this pizza shop doesn't have a name...  Many a Yelper have just accidentally stumbled onto this pizza place in the Cosmopolitian en route to something else. Unlike them, I cheated, using Yelp and the Internet to do the dirty work for me. It also helps that I saw other people just randomly going into the 3rd floor with whole pizza boxes. Once you hit the 3rd floor, look between Jaleo (the Spanish place) and Blue Ribbon (sushi) for a small hallway filled with records.  The pizza place is supposed to be small and simple; No1DP notes that it's reminiscent of the pizza joints he used to frequent back in NY/NJ. There's seating and counter space only for ~5 people and there's only 2 pinball games. The concept's really simple: pick pizza for slice or customize a whole pie.   No1DP was craving pizza as Japan really doesn't know how to do a good pizza. I was there for another reason: to try the concoction known as \"white pie\". Crust: Thin and crunchy, which the No1DP says is the way to do a New York-style pizza. The pizza gets cold quickly so eat it while you can. No1DP says that this is why you see people eat this pizza fast - there's not much crust to absorb the heat. -Veggie Supreme: Came to ~$8.00/slice as he had lots of toppings. He says that this is the best pizza he's had in a while and can easily put this in the top 10 pizza joints he's visited. -White Pie ($5.50): The No1DP said to me that each pizza joint does their white pie differently, but in essence this is a cheese pizza with NO tomato sauce. When fresh off the oven the cheese is stringy but it held together well. I really liked the garlic and they are generous with the ricotta - this soft cheese literally just melts in your mouth!   Definitely a must for late night eating, especially if you've been clubbing all day!",

    "text": "My friends and I were sitting around in the hot tub in our hotel trying to figure out what to eat for dinner when someone suggested \"that secret pizza place near Marquee.\"  \"Oh, what's it called?\" \"I don't know. It's just the secret pizza place?\"  Yes. Apparently it really is just called \"Secret Pizza.\"  I had always heard of Secret Pizza, but had never figured out exactly where it was. If you're searching for it, you will find it, but if you're just casually passing by, you probably won't even notice it's there.   How to find it: Go to the Cosmopolitan. Find the entrance to Marquee and take the escalators one floor up. You should be smelling the deliciousness of freshly baked pizza by now. Straight across from the escalators there's a narrow corridor. Follow your nose. This is where the smell is coming from. This is where the secret pizza is hidden away.  You'll probably spend a while stuck in the hallway, being taunted by the smell of ahmazing pizza wafting over you. When you turn the corner of the hallway, you'll be greeted by what looks like an ordinary pizza counter. But do not be fooled.   You can get a slice of pizza for about $5, which is actually fairly decent since each slice is huge. And delicious (trust me, try the white sauce! Zomg. So gooooooood.) If you're trying to order an entire pie, beware, the wait is most likely going to be terrible.   There's two TVs, which makes the wait somewhat more bearable. There's also barely any seating, so most people end up just dumping on the cheese and peppers and taking their slices to go. This seems to be the way to go because we grabbed a seat outside on the couches/stairs in front of Secret Pizza and someone had already snuck a cheese and pepper shaker outside.  Also, for those who enjoy a little late night snacking post-Marquee adventures, Secret Pizza is the place to be. But again, the line, the line! Beware.  tl;dr: If you're in Vegas and searching for a truly delicious piece of pie, Secret Pizza is the place to go. But beware the line! (Because for a secret pizza place, it sure is poppin')",

Do you know how many top-shelf Italian options there are here in Vegas? Five/50 is better. Grimaldi's is better. Etc. Etc.  The whole \"secret / speakeasy aspect\" of this place is also overhyped - almost a nonstarter with the huge queue that can form and late night eaters / party peoples dashing in and out of the corridor.   Now that being said, give credit where it's due. This place is authentic NY style in that there are 1,000 joints like this on the East Coast for a quick and greasy pair of slices to pre-empt the hangover or begin/end a quick date that blossomed late night at one of the nearby drink and or dance establishments.   And they are open late, which is awesome.   But being in Vegas and coming here explicitly for incredible world class pizza is silly.",

I'm right in the middle on my decision...  I arrived at Secret Pizza about 10pm last night with my tequila boyfriend (my best friend, since my fella is not a tequila fan) and some Yelp friends...and some new friends we had made at the AWESOME margarita festival at the pool.    We were very intoxicated, and in need of pizza!  The wait wasn't bad, especially since we got a whole pizza.  Service was pretty standard...not overly friendly, but not super happy to have a room full of drunk guests.    At my level of drunkenness, I think the pizza was the BEST pizza I've ever eaten.  Now, you also have to keep in mind that I've been dieting for 8 weeks, and have been craving pizza, too, so I'm sure that figured in a bit.  It was hot...it was greasy, it was smothered in garlic...(well, that was our fault...didn't realize the \"Parmesan cheese\" we were putting on the pizza was actually garlic salt!)...it was good!  Now, I'm going to have to try it again stone sober to see how I feel about it...you know how everything tastes good when you're intoxicated...I'd like to make sure that I don't need to drink 26 margaritas again to enjoy it.",

    "text": "So I had read about this \"no-name\" pizza place prior to visiting Vegas this time 'round, and I was determined to find it. And find it, we did! (It wasn't difficult. The front desk clerk advised us, when we checked in, that the hallway to this pizza place is on the third floor, beside Jaleo restaurant).   We had heard this was the best pizza in LV, so our expectations were rather high. And it did not disappoint! Sure, it's a no-frills place, where you stand in line and order and pick up your pizza. There's barely any place to sit down inside there, but right outside the hallway there's a big open space with lounge chairs and end tables (along with a pool table with two tip-less cues. Cosmo people, can you get new cue sticks for this table? Please?). We ordered individual slices: hubby had a meat-based slice (pepperoni and other meats), kids had white cheese-based slices with some veggies on them. They said they were the best pizzas they ever had, and if we lived nearby, they'd be here every single day for pizza. Knowing them, they would, too!  We didn't encounter a long line, like the other reviewers mentioned. We probably came at an off-time (although if it wasn't noon on the dot, it must've been within the hour, as we all get ravenous by then. Maybe we were just lucky. There was no line to speak of).   Excellent pizza, great price, fun experience. Who needs more?",

I got the white pizza, which had ricotta cheese and a nice garlicky flavor to it. I would get this again in a heartbeat.

The pizza wasn't bad, it just didn't live up to the hype.  There were some good points.  The pepperoni was nice, big and thick.  It had a really great flavor.  It was cooked nicely and the cheese didn't slide off.  But, nothing wowed me.  In fact, I felt like it was a little under seasoned.  It just came off as a typical normal New York slice.  When I added some pepper and shake cheese the flavor was greatly enhanced, but still no wow.  The place is kind of cool.  They have 1 or 2 old school arcade machines, but once again it felt like a gimmick.  The place was also pretty dirty and most of the staff was standing around doing nothing (no one was in line and it was around 1 in the afternoon.)  Overall, great place for a quick bite to eat after a long night of drinking, but don't go out of your way for it.",

    "text": "There is no sign.  There is no label.  There is not even an inkling that Secret Pizza exists unless you look for it.   It's on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, next to the elevators and this really red open restaurant.  Order pizza by the slice for ~$4.50. YES. IT IS  $5/ slice (added toppings at 0.50 more each). MEH.  Despite the ridiculously steep by the slice price,  it does serve up some delicious thin crust Manhattan, NY styled pizza -- really crispy through and through crust with very ooey, gooey cheesiness.   There is a NOTICEABLE difference between freshly made and those sitting cold on the counter (they reheat when you order). The crust is fuller and softer. Try to wait for the fresh ones to come out (though, the reheated one was not bad). The reheated one kind of...cut the top of my mouth. mmmhmmmm  Pizzas are greasy, oily and unforgiving, but for those who crave the real deal, you sop up the grease because it's unfortunately.. delicious. It is much saltier than most pizzas I've had though, which probably is due to the need to heighten taste since all your other senses are already bombarded.   They also sell whole pizzas ... to go ... with boxes that have no name on it, of course.  Why blow a perfectly good cover? :)  **pst.. this place is very small -- so don't expect to bring your posse of 20 billion friends and expect a seat. You'll be lucky to score a seat for both you and your date. Most people come, order and eat on the way out.",

This was after the Jermiah Dayclub so you can't blame me :P But from what I remember, it hits the spot when you have the drunchies or for a late night snack! The grease and savory-ness will satisfy your late night cravings!  Our group decided to order a whole pizza and it ended up taking foreverrrrr before it was done. I don't blame them though since they're always floooded with tons of customers.   The cool thing about the box they put it in is that it can be disassembled so you can use it as plates!",

It's hard for me to remember... even though I've been here dozens of times, I'm not sure that any of them were sober. Once you've seen the pool tables though, know that you are very close!! Follow the record cover decorated hallway.  Pizza slizes are between $4 & $5 bucks, a whole pie starts at $28 and they are HUGE. I'm pretty simple so I tend to stick with cheese or pepperoni slices... so I can only really speak on those - and they are delicious!  I think goodness that I had a coworker back home who was kind enough to direct me here. It took a few tries for me to find the place but that made finally eating here ridiculously fun.   It's worth the hunt, promise!",

My one problem was that I really wasn't that good at finding anything that's \"hidden\".    Well, lucky for me my boyfriend was around and it really wasn't that hidden.  Just follow the smell of pizza and the trail of people with paper plates.   So it's pizza by the slice any way you want it and it is by no means cheap but it's Vegas and it's in the Cosmopolitan, are you really surprised?  The pizza is really good, not top notch but pretty damn good.  It's got that nice crispy crust with the ooey gooey cheese and whatever the heck you want on top.  The toppings are fresh and delicious!  Seating isn't great and depending on how busy it is it could be a hot mess.  They've got counter seating and it's extremely limited.  You can always walk it out to the couches down the hall and have a seat there.  Boyfriend and I managed to score seats next to a couple of drunk idiots, but hey it's Vegas.",

My feet were killing me so my friend an I found a table to sit on while the boys bought the pizza. I was looking for a sign but didn't see anything. So I Yelp*ed it and it popped up as Secret Pizza. The line was extremely long, it took the boys around 45mins to an hour to come out with the pizza. It was a Friday night, and there was a big name DJ spinning at the club downstairs, but being hungry and intoxicated made that hour seem like forever!  The pizza was pretty good. Nothing to go crazy over. Maybe we shoudve tried something different? We had a traditional meat lovers type.. pepperoni, sausage, ham.  Would I go back? Probably to try something different... It's nice to have a pizza place open that late... when I'm drunk... and hungry :]",

But when you're like us and need your pizza fix quick status, you will search through all reviews to find on exactly how to get there.   You could just smell it walking towards it, mmmm. Sure, there's a wait and you notice you can't really sit down there. There are a few stools and arcade games if you are waiting for you pizza to be ready. After only 20 minutes, our pizza was done.  Delicious. I love their sausages best. Everything from the crust to thickness to cheese to subtly of the sauce, made this place memorable for me.  I craved pizza the next day and all I kept thinking was,  I just want Secret Pizza. I cannot wait to go back.",

I thought maybe it was psychological, because of the pseudo-\"exclusive\" nature of a place called \"Secret\" Pizza, and maybe the retro-80's pizza joint setup, complete with checkered pattern, a Galaga arcade cabinet, and pinball machines.  So I took some pizza with me back to Cali for lunch on the next day.  Also made sure to call up SP to find out the temperature to reheat my slices (450 degrees F).  Even reheated in the toaster oven, the slices were still really great.  Just taking a wild guess that maybe they put olive oil in the dough?    The only down note I'd have to give this place is the price for a slice ($5 is on the pricey side).  It's not out of line considering the location of this place, but I guess the fair value of a slice of NY-style pizza in a casino hotel in Vegas is $5.",

The pizza is only okay, it's nothing I would write home about.  The last time I was there, I had just a slice of pepperoni pizza.  It was SO greasy, which I wouldn't mind at 4am, but it was only 10pm.  I didn't quite have enough to drink to soak up that grease.  And the service is super slow.  I mean, the pizza is already prepared, how long does it take to put it on a paper plate and hand it to someone?  Also, I know that it is the strip, but paying $17 for 2 slices and 1 beer is pretty ridiculous.  I do love that they have reasonably priced beer here.  Not that I feel OK about paying $6 for a Stone IPA, but it's better than the $10 they charged for the same beer at The Chelsea.  The best thing about this place are that they are open super late, so it's a great, quick(er) bite to eat after a night of partying and gambling.",

While I was hoping I'd see them freshly prepare the pizza in front of me, I suppose re-heating it suffices too.  The selection is pretty basic, you got your plain cheese, pepperoni, or sausage.  To that, you can add simple ingredients like mushroom, onions, bell pepper, etc.  Toppings will cost you extra.  The overall taste was purely simple and glistening, the way on-the-go pizza should be!  The most important fact to know about the pizza is how the crust is perfectly thin and crispy.  I almost prefer it this way!  If you are coming out of the club or lounge, $5 a slice won't matter much, you just want something good and quick to help you sober!",

This tiny lil pizza spot, is a hidden gem, within the FABULOUS walls of the Cosmopolitan, serving up slice after slice, of mouth-watering thin crust pizza genius!  They don't call it \"Secret Pizza\" for nothing, you've gotta sort of hunt this place down. Even the staff of the Cosmo, is in on it. They'll give you some vague hints, as to the whereabouts of their exact location, but, the rest is up to you, to find the joint! Also, I'm not here to tell you where it's located, I'm here to tell you, you've GOT to go!  Small and tiny, but with nice decor (the walled corridor leading to the actual pizzeria, is lined with album {mostly Italian} art). The actual pizzeria is TINY, with MINIMAL SEATING SPACE! Think, stand and eat, not sit down. NOT a good place, for large groups!  The pizza, is DAMN good! I'm still upset that I didn't get a whole pie, instead of a slice! It's crispy thin crust, NY style! My style!   You basically pick a slice from their selection of ready made pizzas, and they'll heat it up for you, or, you can order a whole pie. Just be on your toes, because, when you're slice is done reheating, they just assume you'll come to the front, to take it. They don't call out numbers or names or anything. So, if you're not there, someone else may snag it!  I came in at around 2PM, not AM, but PM, and even then, it was terrific people watching! Drunks EVERYWHERE!  The price is pretty damn good too, considering, you're in a 5-star resort.  If you're in Vegas, and you're in the mood for pizza, DON'T forget about this place!

I came around 1:30 p.m. on a Saturday, and it wasn't too busy but I can certainly see how it can become packed as the space is pretty small. All in all, if I'm ever in Vegas again I'd love to return.",

The girl that took my order forgot about my pizza that she was reheating so it got pretty burnt on the bottom. It just tasted like charcoal and the cheese seemed old. But I was exhausted and hungry so I ate it anyway. They also raised the prices. We asked for a cup of water but they said their machine broke. Last weekend they were charging $4.50 for a water bottle, so we passed on the water.",

This place is so good that people actually make line probably 20-35 mins I know it Sucks to wait but it's worth it I guarantee you! Shout out to the manager Ruben he was extremely nice and helpful and so was the rest of the staff amazing place every time I go to Vegas I stop here! You should definitely try the supreme pizza! It is delicious and a little tip they are located in the 3rd floor across the elevator ;)",

If you're headed here right after Kaskade, you're going to have to wait in line for the longest time ever. Deal with it because it's so worth it, I promise.   Oh, and ladies, while waiting in line please keep your heels on. Thanks.  Instead of ordering a whole pizza (which takes some time to make), ask for a box and get an assortment of slices, it all tastes the same by this time anyway.  My favorite is the all meat pizza (apparently, I'm a vegetarian only up until 4am and champagne wasted) - topped with gyro meat, it doesn't feed the drunk much better than this!  Note: if the sign says \"NO RANCH,\" there really is no ranch. So sad for all of you ranch dippers, I know. Someone would make bank opening up a Hidden Valley Ranch stand outside of the hallway.",

There is not even a sign for the place.  The line stays pretty long all night, but it is so worth it!  I tried the Meatballs and Ricotta cheese slice.  Unbefreakinleavable.   Prices are reasonable at about $4.00-$6.00 for a large slice.  Customer service was great too.  Cooks were obviously working their butts off moving the line as fast as possible, but still having a good time and joking around with guests as they waited.  When some drunk guy tried to cut in line they kicked him out right away.  So satisfying when you see people working hard and not putting up with BS like that.  Will definitely be returning, if I can find the dang place.",

After my sister and I finally discovered the hidden hallway, we were happy and shocked at the same time. As native New Yorkers, we are used to paying like $2.50-3 for a regular slice but Secret Pizza wants to charge $4 a slice and $5 (or $5.50, I forgot I was tired lol) for a white slice. But when you're hungry in Vegas and you're staying in the Cosmopolitan just take a stroll and find this hidden place. The best time to go is in the afternoon. If you go between 3-5 am expect at least a 30 minute wait and be ready to hear crazy drunken stories.",

Don't be fooled by the 3 stars (I was contemplating 4), the pizza is tasty, but I've had better...especially in NYC if you want this style of pizza.  But maybe on the west coast this is as good as you're going to get.    From what I remember pizza slices ranged from $4-6 a slide depending on the toppings.  And you have to choose from what they have if you want slices.  If they happen not to have plain cheese at the moment, well your out of luck and have to choose something else.  It's a refreshingly inexpensive option for food in Vegas.  If your hungry or drunk or nearly broke or a combination of any of the aforementioned qualities you should make a stop here.",

The only downfall is it doesn't list toppings. But that detail is so minor compared to the rest of the experience. They have made to order pizzas for you to choose from. Or you can order an entire pie. My group picked the white pizza, combo, sausage and banana pepper and I picked the pepperoni and mushroom slices.  We ordered our drinks. The boys picked some beers and us girls went with wine, which was $6 for a large plastic cup filled. We were thrilled! Nowhere ever gives you that much wine for $6.. Let alone in Vegas. Our pizza took about 5 min to come out. And every pizza looked and smelled delicious  but then eating it was even more amazing then what my first two senses were showing me.   After we finished our slices we went back for one more slice of the white pizza. IT WAS THAT AMAZING!  I will be back to Vegas in 2 weeks. And will be back her for sure!!",

Great option to soak up the alcohol after a night of clubbing at Marquee. Very limited seating, but you can just grab a slice and head outside to the communal area to play pool. Late night eaters can sit along the Jaleo's patio seats, since the restaurant is closed.",

    "text": "A \"hidden\" gem among all the fancy stores and restaurants  this pizza joint was a very guilty pleasure of mine.   They had perfect nostalgia with the fact that it is a hidden restaurant down a long dark hallway, the staff are casually dressed with backwards baseball caps, and there is a working Galaga arcade game set up next to the counter!  Now, the reason for me being so impressed is the fact that it is in such a \"classy\" area and the amount of joy you feel when you find this joint is priceless (of course it's on the Cosmopolitan hotel map but still it's like a treasure hunt).  Oh, and the pizza was pretty good, definitely a nice stop after some fun at the Marquee Day & Night club.",

I have been to the cosmo twice already and never seen this place, so I had to ask around, and they pointed me toward a long hallway all hidden in the back.   So it being hidden doesn't seem it gets a lot of customers, but I guess from the reviews it's doing good.   No menu, so you just have to look at the pizza and decide. This place is crazy small. It might fit 15 people. Only like five seats so it's a race to find one. I stood up and ate my pizza because I didn't want to walk around cosmo trying to find a place to sit.   The pizza was pleasant, nothing bad about it.   Trash cans are full, so napkins are stacked high.  It seems like only two guys are running this place so it's hard.   The prices are the same everywhere in Vegas, so I am use to the 3 dollar bottle of water and the 4 dollar slice of pizza.",

Maybe it's 3:00am and you're leaving a club, and need to eat. Or, in my case, maybe it's 10:00pm and you're starving for dinner, and you just really want pizza. Whatever the case may be, take my advice. Head to the Cosmopolitan. Go to the third floor. Find all the restaurants, and the pool table. Find Secret Pizza down the secret hallway lined with music records. Eat. Be happy! I have to admit, I didn't find this place on my own, or even through Yelp. I was sitting next to a really nice guy on the plane ride in, who told me I just HAD to try the pizza here. Best pizza in Vegas, he said. Is it? I can't judge that, because it's the ONLY pizza I've had in Vegas. However, it's one of the best pizzas I've ever had. I went with the white pizza. Absolutely the most mouthwatering slice I've ever had. Gobs of ricotta, perfectly crisp/chewy crust. Sprinkled with the (I think) garlic powder they have on the counter, and a little parmesan. I was in carb heaven and it was WORTH IT. Definitely will be back next time I'm in Vegas. Which will be next month. I'm already counting down the days till my next Secret Pizza visit.",

I can see why they would originally name this place Secret Pizza (the lack of signs, location, etc), but there was no way they could keep this place a secret for more than ten minutes after their grand opening.  The pizza is ridiculously good.  I loved NY pizza so much, that I literally had a slice (or three) of it every single day I lived there.  There have only been a couple pizza places outside of NY that I would even consider eating daily, and this has to be one of them.  I'm hoping they change their name to Deliver Anywhere In The World Pizza, or Now Open in Southern California Pizza, ASAP...  If they do, I will be the first customer to sign up for their auto debit and delivery program (which isn't even real).  There really is no need to go over prices, or describe their pizza in detail.  Just know that if you are in Vegas, you need to try Secret Pizza.",

All I can say for location is to follow the pizza. You will see people coming from the same direction and just head their way and you will reach the magic kingdom! The hallway you walk through is super cool too with records all over the walls and once you get in there are retro arcade games as well! When it was my turn, I wanted to try the white pizza but didn't know if I'd like ricotta cheese so while I was discussing my decision with my cousin, the guy cut me a sliver to try - so nice! I ended up loving that sliver and getting a slice myself while my cousins got the pepperoni and the one with everything.  Let me tell you, this pizza is not for the health-conscious. It is super super oily and cheesy but hey, what good pizza isn't? The pizza is literally one of the best thin-crust pizzas I've had! It is definitely better  than Lombardi's in NY in my opinion but tied with Artichoke Pizza in NY for my favorite pizza ever. & super affordable!  Definitely a must-try in my opinion! I tried all 3 and the white pizza was my favorite! DO IT GUYS.",

I placed the order about 20 minutes before my expected pick up time.  Upon arrival the line was already out the door (Friday night at 11:30), I was a bit confused as I thought people would still be out partying but I guess its vegas and maybe people were just jet lagged.  Either way I cut to the front and check on my order and it turns out they had not even started it.  I was upset but the guy started the order right a way and offered me a slice as compensation.

Each whole pizza ordered is specifically made for you in 45 minutes to the Tee and it was worth every minute not including the line to wait and order but still worth trying the secret hype.  Yes, it's not a secret but you'll still need to ask where to find this spot because you won't find it since they didn't put a name to this place hoping it was kept a secret exclusively to YELPERS. Hahahahahaa...Jk!   Great hidden sinister gem in sin city...MUST bookmark.",

Oh man, they were either going to like it or hate it!!!  For myself, I liked the pizza and that they offered PBR on tap.  It's a cheap quick meal in a casino/hotel that didn't have a lot of budget friendly options.  The NY friends of mine had mixed reactions.  A few said it was legit and very authentic and some didn't really care for it.  The one key about the pizza is the crust...it's crunchy and not soft/doughy.  That \"crunch\" is a rare thing...the crust wasn't dry but still had a nice crunch.    I appreciated that they took credit cards for paying but it's always a tossup as to what pizzas that they have available for slices.  The only way to know is to ask when you order or to look over the counter to see what they have.",

    "text": "The name alone grew my curiosity.  Once I tried it, I thought, 'damn, I wish it were still a secret!'  Unfortunately, everyone and their mothers knows about Secret Pizza.  If you don't, then you need to go upstairs from Chandelier in the Cosmopolitan and look for the Vinyls.    Once you walk through the hallway lines with record covers, you'll see this little quaint slice of heaven.  The place always has a line, there's a few stools to sit on in the back and a few vintage arcade games for your pleasure.  What I really like is their wall of money by the paying station.  The top row is lines with $100 bills.  Bawlllerrrrr!  LOL.  When it's your turn, choose the pizza they have and they'll reheat the already cooked slice.  Usually runs about 6-8 dollars depending on the type of pizza.  I was with a group of 4 peeps.  We all the Chicago style pizza square with sun-dried tomatoes on top with 4 PBR drafts.  Total came to about $50 which was a little steep, but soooo worth it!  The pizza was full of cheesy goodness and the bottom of the crust was super crispy.  Every bite was amazing and it really filled us up!  Beer was crisp and very cold.  Perfect Sunday meal.  If you're smart enough to find this place, you deserve a slice of heaven.  That's my motto for this place.  If you need help though, just look for the pool table and you'll see the hall of records close by.  You're welcome in advance.",

However, I wish I paid better attention to the show because I forgot which floor it was on (hint: THIRD floor) but once we found it, we thought it was totally worth the trouble. Everything that everyone says about this place in point: You'll miss it if you blink, no frills food & service and the pizza is absolutely superb. We had the popular white pizza (at $5.50/slice it seems inflation is hitting this place hard as the prices go up with each review) and it was delicious. With liberal toppings and an amazing crust I could have eaten a whole pie by myself. The lines DO get long but it moves pretty quick as you're there for a coke & a slice, not a steak dinner.

Crust? Falls apart when you try the Brooklyn fold, and it doesn't have any flavor. Sauce? Can't taste the fresh tomatoes. Cheese? This part is pretty spot-on. Service? Asked for two regulars and a sausage. Got a pepperoni and a regular. What? Their sausage is of great quality, but that's about all I can say. Slices aren't large like Brooklyn ones, and this isn't a secret anymore. Is it decent West Coast za? Definitely. Is it the \"perfect NY slice\"? Not even close. Tony's does it better, as does Slice of New York in San Jose. Moving on. Next.",

    "text": "While doing a tour of the Cosmopolitan, we stumbled on a place called Secret Pizza. It is down a hall tucked away and hidden from the glitz and glamour of the Cosmo. I knew we had to try it the second I found out about it. After hearing that even locals seek out this place to devour on some New York style pizza, it settled it. We walked down the hall and started to smell the aroma of the cheese.  I love cheese. The place was quite smaller than I anticipated.  They really only have seating for a few people, but it looks like most take it to go. I ordered a slice with pepperoni and black olives.  My favorite as a child.  I would have gone a little crazy with the toppings, but they are a bit pricy when adding more stuff to your pizza. An average pizza from this place is roughly $40.  Typical for a Vegas restaurant, but still hurts the pocketbook. The pizza was pretty good. Not sure if it is worth $40 for a whole pizza, but a slice for $5 isn't awful. I will return to try other toppings, and maybe if with enough friends, get a whole pizza.",

It's definitely not worth waiting an hour for, but if it's your first time and your drunk friends hyped it up for you, then you should at least give it a shot.  What sucks is the wait. The line is atrocious, especially if you're starving from being drunk. People will cut and make their way to the front. The last time I went, it was as if there were 2 lines.  If you're confused on how to order, just pick the type of pizza you want (white pie, Sicilian, etc.) and then tell them you want to add some shit to it. It's 50 per topping.  It's a little hard to find, so keep your eyes peeled. Or just ask.",

With no real sign, you walk into a hallway and find a simple kitchen and a few pinball machines, and the cure to your hangover the next morning. NOT for the health conscious. Only for the drunk, the hungry, the desperate.  I typically get the regular marinara pizza with hella meat: pepperoni and sausage. Best way to have it esp at 2 or 2 in the morning. For the veggies in the house, the white pie is best (ricotta cheese, not sauce), with just bell peppers, mushrooms, and onions.   It is pricy considering how a slice of pizza the same size in NYC is $1. But it's Vegas, you're most likely intoxicated, and you just want something in your stomach.  Yes, you can enjoy this without having alcohol or other illicit things in your system. It's a solid pizza place. Buuuuut, it's much better after a night of debauchery with good company.",

Look around and find a long alleyway/corridor that is lined with framed pictures. This is your tunnel to a pizza haven. I had to ask someone where exactly it was when I saw her sitting by the pool table with a large, delicious looking pizza (as a tip, this is where you can sit when the pizza joint is filled with customers). Thankfully, I came in the afternoon so there was no line to wait in. As it was my first time, I decided to ask the workers for recommendations. We ended up getting a white pizza with mushroom and sausage, and a traditional red pizza with sausage. Both were delicious and satisfying - sometimes you just need a good slice of pizza as a break from all the rich, fine-dining type of food in Vegas. At first, I thought just one slice wouldn't be enough. But wash it down with an ice cold beer and you have yourself a meal.   Prices were decent, $4 - 5 a slice depending on the amount of toppings you add. They have beer on draft too, which made the whole experience remind me of my undergraduate days. Overall, an excellent pizza joint for your afternoon, evening, and post-club munchie needs.",

As you make your way closer, you begin to smell the wonderful scents of dough being baked alongside the hint of pizza sauce.  There's not much to this place except that pizza will be pizza and regardless of how crappy it is, I think I will always eat it. For real though, I will eat it. Here's what the girlfriend and I had that evening:  -sausage & cheese -pepperoni & cheese -white pie  Out of the three slices, the white pie was our number one choice.

I quickly dispatched my handy Yelp app and searched for \"late night food\" (it was 2AM after all) and noticed the intriguing title of \"Secret Pizza\".  Not only were we already in the Cosmopolitan but it also was highly rated.  Finding this place was an adventure, partially because it's hidden/not listed anywhere and also because I was already three sheets to the wind and would probably have a hard time finding it even if I didn't have anything to drink.  Alas, do not discount the determination of two twenty something males with a craving for some late night pizza.  The actual pizzeria wasn't terribly big and thankfully wasn't crowded when we went so ordering and paying for our slices was relatively fast.  I ordered a slice of the white pizza (effin delicious) and another equally delicious pizza (see photo) which name escapes me.  Both slices were amazing from the toppings right down to the crust...which I ate all of.  The cost of my fourth meal was $11 (verified by the credit card receipt in my wallet the next day) which was not only reasonable but totally worth it.",

It was much better than the NY style pizza I had in NY this past winter. I can't wait to go back to Vegas just for this!!",

I mean I don't go out of my way to come here because driving on the strip is a bi...atch, but if I happen to be at Cosmo I will do ANYTHING within my power to stop by Secret Pizza.   Their white pizza is the definite winner. The gobs of different cheeses that they use are just too delicious. Pepperoni and sausage is a close second! They use thick slices of sausage that just complement the rich tomato sauce perfectly. Their crust is chewy and crispy at the same damn time.   If you come here you have to order an entire pizza regardless of how many people are in your party. Nothing beats a freshly baked pizza! Just be careful to wait a second so you don't burn the roof of your mouth.   Now excuse me while I go reheat a leftover slice of white pizza in my kitchen.",

    "text": "I have never worked so hard for a slice of pizza in my whole life!! Without a sign anywhere to be found, anyone could have simply just walked past this pizza goldmine! It was so hard to find that my group and I had to help direct a couple of customers in the right direction because they too were puzzled and lost as to where it was located!   Food: During my visit here I got the sicilian pizza and I must say this may have just been the best pizza I have ever had! I am not exaggerating it was just that good! The crust was doughy yet crispy and they didn't cheap out on the toppings either! My slice in particular came with cheese, tomatoes and some deli meats on it! The portion is also huge so you definitely get your money's worth.   Service: I came her after Marquee dayclub and there was already a pretty long line that formed when we arrived. This is why there is a one star deduction for the review. I think in total it took about 30 mins or more to get my one slice of pizza. I hope that they find a more efficient way to get people in and out faster in the future!   Another con is the fact that there is no seating, if possible can you guys furnish the place with some tables and chairs so we can eat in peace! If you need a place to sit then go down the hallway, there you will find some comfortable one seaters! In the end, a majority of us had to just plop down on the floor because there were not enough chairs to go around.     All in all, love the pizza but hate the slow service and lack of seating !",

We ordered a few pizzas (at $20-25 dollars each): - 1/2 White with pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms. and ricotta cheese and 1/2 regular cheese - Pepperoni and sausage - Sun dried tomatoes  The slices are huge and delicious! The white pizza with the ricotta cheese = amazeballs, no lie. You have to try it!  The restaurant itself is pretty cute - there's no sign outside like normal restaurants. It's just a semi-hidden hallway-like area. There's a huge wooden door that can close to make it look like there's no restaurant at all. Pretty cool!",

My cousin and I were out on the town, having drinks, and people watching on the Strip.  At around 4:00am, the munchies started to kick in lol--I thought of this place! OMG, the line was crazy long.  Marquee had just closed, and a bunch of drunken kiddoes singing EDM songs filled the long hallway that lead to the pizza.  So my suggestion is to go there before the club closes avoid the lines, buy a fresh pie (~$28; ~$5/slice) and a cold beer, and take it to the couches outside of the restaurant and JUST. GRUB.  It's the perfect way to end (or start) a night ;)",

The line was about 25 minutes deep on Friday and about 45 minutes deep on Saturday at about 3am to 4am.  With a very few food options open late at night, people do wait this long and pay $5 a slice. I even saw some people that got a full pizza for like $25 trying to slang slices for $10 a peace outside of Secret Pizza....True hustle. I guess they were trying to get back that lost gambling money or get more liquor funds.   If you want something besides pizza and maybe a shorter wait, try The Henry  on the first floor, they are open 24 - 7 and have a solid late night selection.",

It's located on the 3rd level of Cosmo, down a long hallway, by the elevator. Barely any space to stand or sit in there. There are couches and a pool table outside where you can sit which was fun, but there's no guarantee you'll find a spot.   It was $28 for a whole pizza which has 10 slices. We shared among 5 people so we got two slices each. I didn't even eat my second slice... The pizza was extremely greasy and it kind of looked like it was sat out for awhile.

Very easy menu with pizza (whole or slice), salad and drinks.  That's all folks.   I had the white slice with the fresh mozzarella cheese, ricotta cheese and garlic.  I added mushrooms to it.  They have the pizzas premade and they put your topping on the slice and bake it again.  $5.50 for a slice of heaven!

    "text": "If the lines at 3:00am are any indication, Secret Pizza is THE WORST KEPT SECRET in Vegas.  If the first rule of Secret Pizza is to not talk about Secret Pizza (right Yvette??  Haha), someone definitely wasn't paying attention!  Not that I have a problem that they did...because now I can write my review without having to feel guilty about it.  Tucked away on the third floor and with no signage to point it out, finding the entrance is to literally look for a hole in the wall.  Once you do though, it's just a short trip down a hallway until you find yourself in a small room and in front of their pizza counter inside.  They offer a variety of pizzas by the slice at any given time, as well as whole pies that you can customize.  Since there was about ten of us there, we opted for two large pizzas - one with pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom, while the second had mushrooms, sausage, and green peppers (I think...didn't try that one).  All in all, the pizzas were pretty solid.  There was a generous amount of tasty toppings and I liked how there wasn't a ton of sauce.  I certainly wouldn't say it's the best pizza out there, but it was good and a lot better than I had expected.  The best part of all though was their prices - at about $4-5 a slice and $22 for a three topping pizza, they're comparable to what regular pizzerias would charge and definitely budget friendly for the Strip.  As far as late night/post-partying food options go, Secret Pizza is a solid bet.    BTW, a word of advice from my friend - in your potentially inebriated state, try to remember to wait before taking that first bite.  You might not feel all that hot oil burning your mouth when you're drunk, but you'll definitely feel it when you wake up the next day (\"Dude, my tongue REALLY HURTS\").",

The pizza is above average but it's not super-mega out of this world awesome.  If you are getting late night eats then expect a long wait (both in line and while they make it).  I think we waited in line for 25 minutes and another 20 minutes for them to make it.    Seating is limited so you might find yourself eating in the lobby just outside (especially if you are rolling w/ a large group).",

My friends and I ordered a whole pizza with white sauce, veggies and sausage. It was roughly $30 and some I think? I maybe wrong since my friend paid for it but forget the price and I'll explain the pizza. The pizza came out super hot and yummy. Be very careful bc you can burn your lips or tongue. You should first try it without cheese/pepper and if you need some, go ahead and add it. You're basically creating your pizza and you can tell them what you want. The guys working there are super cool and nice. The only downside I think was the crust. I know some may say the crust is the most important part but I wasn't very fond of the crust. I'm more of the thin crust type of person so the pizza here has a bit of a thicker crust. It was still good though. I'll be back!",

I tried pizza in two other places - Flamingo (gross) and Flour and Barley (good, but not amazing) and found Secret Pizza to be the winner by far.  If we are anywhere near the Cosmopolitan again we will be back!  Cosmopolitan Hotel 3rd floor unmarked hallway just to left as you get off the escalator.  I had no trouble finding it.",

Not surprising, being in Vegas and all, but man, that place was dirty. There were only two workers manning the fort, so I guess cleaning their oily, crumby countertops wasn't a priority.  I don't know if their pizza was mouthwatering by its nature or because I just stumbled my way from Marquee Day Club. Regardless, I remember my mushroom pepperoni slice being crispy with a gooey satisfaction. Not too satisfying though, to be worth $5. I really wanted to try the white pizza that every yelper seems to rave about, but they only had three selections available: pepperoni, mushroom pepperoni, and sausage pepperoncini.

Even with our hint we nearly walked by the place. We only found it because of the 80's music blasting down the hallway.  This place is like what I would expect Panucci's Pizza from Futurama (except much more sanitary) to be like.  The pizza is greeeasy and served by the slice. You've been warned. But it hits the spot with a cold beer. Not a lot of seating, but this place is a secret...so you can't expect it to be huge.

Came here around 1am and there was about a 20 minute line. We ordered a whole pizza with ricotta cheese and pepperoni. The pizza was good, although we were all so hungry we couldn't wait for it to cool down so we tried eating it with some toppings sloughing off the sides. That was no fun. Plus it was piping hot. Ahh, curse your lack in judgment after a night of drinking. And to top it all off, I mistakenly dashed my slice with tons of garlic powder thinking it was parmesan cheese. *Face palm* My friend made that mistake too though, which makes me think that they should really label those condiment dispensers. Hah. We had a good laugh about it though and I was able to blot some of it off. It's great that this place is open until 4am or 5am every day, definitely convenient for partygoers in Vegas.   I would definitely give this place another chance (and wait until the pizza cools down next time). Good luck finding it though, 3rd floor of the Cosmo is the best I can do for ya!",

Forced me to buy a bottle of water for 4.5 dollars. The staff didn't bother help fix or provide an alternate source even after repeated requests. Recommended for the pizza only.",

    "text": "About a year ago, I was aimlessly strolling thru the Cosmopolitan, taking in all the beauty that the hotel has to offer.  While walking around the Chandelier Bar on the upper floors, I stumbled across a long hallway lined with album covers, with a questionable ending.  What could be at the end? Narnia? Or the Springfield Mystery Spot, complete with Ozzie Smith? Of course, being the quizzical individual that I am, I walked down the hallway.  Couldn't believe what I saw...a walk-up pizza joint!  Anyway, with over 500 reviews, I don't know how this is a secret anymore.  No sign, no advertising, but excellent NY-style pizza.  At $4.50/slice, with the Strip-markup, it's a pretty good value for wasteepants late-night munchies.  And if you're not ready to end the rager, they have beer and I think, boxed wine.  This is obviously a place to go after a night throwin elbows at the club.  At times, I've seen the line full of button-down shirts, fist pumps, sky-high heels, and dresses that leave little to the imagination.  Sometimes the line is long, which is understandable given its popularity.  But they try their best to keep the line moving swiftly.  I'm glad I stumbled onto this place, as it has become a staple when I visit.   I applaud the Cosmopolitan for this inspired idea.",

Come, get your slice, devour it with your friends and be on your way. You will enjoy it.

    "text": "They say X amount of folks can keep a secret if X-1 of them are dead. No. Not an algebra problem but you know how it goes with secrets - once too many people know it sure ain't a secret. Once you mention a place like this on a TV show that's just as good as advertising on billboards on every highway leading to Vegas. So one night when I was free to roam on my own for dinner I made a beeline for this place. I didn't see the TV show but a friend did and he's a pizza connoisseur and recommended this place. Third floor of the Cosmopolitan - there's no sign but I think most people would be curious to see where this hallway leads to anyway so I wouldn't call it \"hidden\". 3000 plus reviews also suggests you'd have to amass a rather high body count before this place ever becomes a \"secret\" again. When I got to the end of the hallway there was a line and all available spots to hang out and eat your pizza were occupied. I got a Goose IPA and one slice with ricotta and meatball and one sausage pizza slice. Priced just as any other place in Vegas but I've had pizza at food courts in various hotels in Vegas and the pizza was better than any of those. Worth the trip however long the walk on the strip to get here is. Not sure what the place is really called - my bill just had the generic \"pizzeria\" name on it. As always, your mileage may vary. Open till 4AM and some nights even till 5.",

It took us a few minutes to find this place but once I did I now know why this place is a secret. The food is very good here. I don't want anyone else knowing that this place exists because it's that good.   The crust is even good.  I flew into vegas straight from NY and I have to admit that the pizza here was better than any pizza I had in NY. Not joking.  Now go on an adventure and find this hidden secret pizza place in the Cosmo.  FYI, there are no signs to this pizza place, just a long hallway into pizza heaven",

We took our first bite into what we thought was about to be the best pizza on earth, only to find that it was still pretty cold and distasteful. Fast forward the next day, I wanted to give the place another shot because second chances are cool, and to no avail the quality was still the same, but a little hotter this time around.

On the 3rd floor of the Cosmo, almost in line with the escalator, is a dark hallway that seems to lead to nothing but some pinball machines. But once you get there, you'll find a hole-in-the wall pizza joint run by some really nice, hard-working fellas who love serving gigantic sized slices of red or white-sauced pizza topped with mushrooms, sausage and/or pepperoni or whatever you want for ~$5/slice. Get a drink and the cashier will tell you the \"refills on me.\"   -Sausage is my favorite - not too salty or oily. -Mushroom is a good veggie option. -\"Meat Lovers\" - combo of pepperoni and sausage was really oily. Maybe good for the hangovers but a bit heavy after having the above 2.  There's a TV with sports on, a couple of chairs to sit and eat on, but mostly standing room only. It's definitely a good spot to stop by for a quick, cheap lunch by Vegas standards.  And because I can't stand people like this, I have to rant: To the lady with the designer bag, it's a hole-in-the-wall pizza joint. No one hangs out there for too long so stop complaining about the lack of seats and how you can't eat standing up. There are plenty of sofas out on the hotel floor. Also, throw your own trash away! You didn't even leave tip for that.",

Plus when you've been at the pool all day with your tiny ass euro swim trunks, eating at places like Scarpetta or Blue Ribbon Sushi just isn't possible.  Pizza is ultra greasy and heartburn-inducing but it does the job of sopping all the overpriced fire-water you've been chugging. I pretty much live at the Cosmopolitan and this is about the only option you have if you need a quick fix.  The sausage and mushroom pizza is my personal favorite so it should also be yours, pretty darn good. If you plan on getting filled up I'd suggest getting at least 2 slices.

Can't spoil it too much for everyone right?  We had seven people in our group, so we waited, and waited, then waited some more. It took a while to reach that point in line where you could see the menu and prices posted on a wall. I realize that they also fulfill phone orders from the hotel's guests, but we were practically forced to order individual slices because waiting for a whole pizza would take an hour. Anyway, we each finally got our $5 pizza slices after at least 30 minutes, then walked out to stand around and munch on 'em.  To be frank, the pizza was decent, but overhyped and not worth the wait or price.",

There's no door or sign, just a long hall way (see Yelp photos).  If you get to the elevators, you've gone too far.  Anyway, I stopped by around dinnertime for a quick meal.  The line moved pretty slowly, and I can only imagine how much worse it probably is late-night when everyone is drunk.  There was a 45 minute wait for a whole pie, so we just ordered slices of regular pepperoni.  The pizza is good, thin crust, but nothing particularly special.  The red sauce pizza is on the blander side, so I recommend getting toppings.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again, but I'd definitely stop by if I were already at the Cosmopolitan and hungry.  As far as drunchies, I'm not sure if I could deal with a long wait time, especially with Earl's across the street.  Overall, Secret Pizza is not my favorite cheap eats spot in Vegas, since there's nothing particularly remarkable about the pizza; however, it's a nice addition to the Strip.",

You wait in line, order up a big slice of whatever they have made in the last 10 minutes, and find a little counter space to enjoy pizza and wine/beer.   Every time I've been here they I've gotten through the line quickly, the staff  has been friendly, and the pizza has been good. It is a bit pricey for a slice but you're on the Strip so that's what can be expected. If you weren't being overcharged then it wouldn't be a Las Vegas restaurant.

Friends brought me to this location or my growling stomach (I can't decide which) and I had no idea what to expect. It's a pizza place in Vegas so my expectations ran high. To my surprise, the pizza was actually pretty amazing. From the sauce, to the cheese, to the crust....mmmm too much flavor for one slice. I also like how large the slices are because one can stir up quite an appetite while drinking the night away.",

After you get off the escalator, it's this long hallway to the left of the first dining place you see when stepping off the escalator. Hope this helps since I was searching through multiple Yelp reviews to find any bit of info!  As for the food, ordered a slice of the combo pizza and the white pizza. Both slightly greasy, but delicious ($4.50 each). Also ordered a cannoli (around $4) for dessert. Really hard to find a place to sit and eat when it's packed. They have bar stools lined up against the walls (not a lot) and a pinball machine or two.   Would come back for another slice. Picked up cups of water as soda was $4 each!",

And then there is the name...\"Secret Pizza\"...that did it for me...I had to try it.  I was immediately impressed with the fresh ingredients added to my  slice opting for onions, 'rooms and 'roni.  The crust was as close to the east coast as is possible out here in the desert.  It reminded me a bit of Pepe's in New Haven even though they use a modern gas fired pizza oven to cook their pies.  The service was great for a pizza joint.  Any cashier that volunteers free refills on the soft drinks is getting my business.  The only thing holding this place back is the lack of tables and stools.  We made due with the limited counter space.  This gem, just seconds off the strip on the third floor of the Cosmo, is a sure thing and a great, casual alternative to Pink's Hot Dogs across the street.",

Don't even bother using those electronic maps around the casino for help, because you won't find it listed under restaurants or dining/food. It's called Secret Pizza for a reason.   If you want to come here to eat and not just to quell your drunchies, then come out lunch. The post-clubbing crowd always makes the line go out the door. Avoid that crowd and come during lunch. I like the white slice the best. Add some sausage and sundried tomatoes, and perfection! They have a new one called the sicilian slice which is similar to the white slice but a deep dish version loaded with what looks like 5lbs of cheese. Kind of pricey for a slice of pizza ($5.50 for white slice, $5 for red, $8 for sicilian), but they make up for it by giving you a good sizable slice.  TLDR: Clubbing at Marquee and got the drunchies? Go here! The line can get ridiculous, but come during lunch if you want to avoid it or suck it up and wait in that line to sober up and get your pizza. On the pricier side, but large slices!",

Big tip: if you going with a group better call them and order otherwise you would  overpay for slices also when you try to reach them they don't pick up a phone so you definitely should wait until some one will answer the phone. Line after Marquee hours is getting insane so be aware of that but overall pretty tasty pizza when u really hungry!!!",

Walking in, the joint was tiny and packed so I was excited to try the pizza. I walked up to the counter and of the bat I was disappointed. There were only a few options to try from. Nothing special or different about their pizza than any other I've tried.   I got a slice of the pepperoni and a slice of sausage. I was quite upset with the amount of toppings on the pizza. Only a few pieces of sausage and pepperoni per slice was not what I expected.   As for the taste, the crust was the highlight of the pizza. It was flaky and crispy all in one. Quite delicious. The cheese was also very tasty and these two factors are the only reason it got 3 stars instead of 2.   I would try it regardless.",

Well, yeah, it is a damn good secret to be found. And well worth \"the search\"...  I was no mood to be searching for Secret Pizza. So thank goodness my Yelp friends are not as mysterious as the blank rectangle on my Cosmopolitan hotel map. After reading through some tips & reviews, I found the long, mysterious hallway - ok, well, I lied, I just followed my nose and smelled the pizza deliciousness wafting down the corridor. Thankfully, there was no line and five pies to choose from. Hubby and I chose the White Pizza and a Combo slice. I must say, the White Pizza is the way to go. I'm pretty sure my husband was bummed that I suggested we try two because he would've loved to eat that White Pizza slice all by himself. Don't get me wrong, both were excellent choices, but the White Pizza is a mouth explosion.   Besides the pizza, I'm thrilled to share with you that they offer all-you-can-drink FREE filtered water. Yup, #waterfanatic here and trust me, that water was YUMMMMM.  So, fill er' up!  My advice:  YES, check out Secret Pizza No, don't wait until 2 or 3am YES, go at lunchtime - there was little or no line No, don't go looking for signage - there is none YES, you know you've found it when you see pinball machines No, don't plan on sharing YES, #alwayshydrate (free filtered water FTW!)",

A place like Secret Pizza was much needed in the City Center, more specifically the Cosmopolitan, for those late night cheap(er) snacks that aren't $50 or greater a plate. Though the $5-7 a pizza is still a bit pricy. The pizza itself is good but not the best you will ever have. When they are busy the line is going to be really long so I would not recommend ordering a whole pizza or you will be waiting another 30-40minutes. If you are drunk and hungry, see the slices that are available and a get one of those and dont be \"that guy\" and take forever. It will be busy any Friday and Saturday night after 8pm.",

It also helps that the people at the hotel will tell you as well.   Anyways, it's really small place, sort of reminds me of places in NYC....each slice is $5, which is the only downside since I can get the same kinda pizza and same good taste for $1 in the city...but I'm in Vegas!  Pizzas here are all made fresh and the cheese melts right off. The slices aren't too thin and they're not too thick. Perfect for a good night after drinking!

Everything tasted fresh and was delicious. A slice will set you back about $6 and a pie about $30 with one topping each. The pie has 10 slices which makes it worth it if you're there with at least a couple other people. The seating accommodation isn't too great. They only have bar style seating.

    "text": "If you are looking for a quick afternoon or late night snack at Cosmo in Vegas, you gotta check out Secret Pizza.    After a day long meeting, my friends and I were hungry for an afternoon snack to hold us over until a big work dinner.  One ordered the meat lover slice, the other ordered pepperoni, and I ordered the vegetarian slice.  It was the perfect experience for several reasons: (1) Its pizza, and everyone loves pizza. (2) Secret Pizza has a good selection of slices. (3) Because they have such high traffic, the slices are fairly fresh out of the oven. (4) It's quick, easy and relatively cheap by Vegas standard. You walk up, order, pay, and eat. (5) Last and most importantly, the slices are tasty.  It's NY style thin crust with a bit of cornmeal crispy texture. (Secret Pizza also has deep dish style as well.)  As for beverages, Secret Pizza offers soft drinks and beers.  The perfect pairing for slices.   Secret Pizza is on the third floor of Cosmo and can be a tad difficult to find because it is located at the end of a non-descript corridor - perhaps the reason for the name Secret Pizza.  Just ask any of the restaurant hosts on the floor and they will point you to a satisfying snack.  Enjoy!",

Best part is that you can customize and get a fresh pizza made to order. There was some seating outside of the place and we enjoyed sitting there and enjoying our piping hot pizza.",

The line was extremely long and it took a long time for our pizza to come out so be prepared! My group was all in heels and our clubbing outfits and SOBER so this was probably not the best idea in hindsight.  However, when our cheese pie came out it was GLORIOUS~ I killed 3 slices in 10 minutes and it reminded me of the pizza back home in Jersey so you know it was good.

Located in the Cosmopolitan hotel 3rd floor in between boujee restaurants. Look for a hallway with vintage pictures and white lights peeking through. Ok maybe this place is not so secret anymore once you find it.  My 1st impressions of this place are that the pizza slices are huge and prices were reasonable around $4 to $5 a slice. We ordered a cheese slice and a veggie slice. The veggie was good but the cheese one was the best. The cheese slice was melted well, had a good mix of different cheese flavors and wasn't overly salty. The veggie just lacked that extra cheese flavor it tasted more healthy.  Great place for a late night meal as they are open as late as 5 AM. I will return if I'm in Vegas again.",

    "text": "2 words. One and done. Basically its overhyped. They call this place \"Secret Pizza\" because there are literally no signs for it. The entrance is located inside the Cosmopolitan on the 3rd floor in between Blue Ribbon Sushi and an elevator. You go down the hallway and they are at the very end. Its a small place where where only several people can sit and eat for its a bar type setting.  Since there were 3 of us we were pretty confident that we can finish a whole pie so we got a white pizza with mushrooms, pepperoni, and onions. Wanted pineapple but that was not one of the choices. The pizza itself is a decent size. I thought it was not bad. The only thing that stood out negatively was that it was a lot greasier than im used to. Yes, I know pizza is supposed to be greasy and if you ask me, the more the merrier but this one seem to have extra for some reason. Had to wash my hands twice for the napkins I used to wipe my hands didnt do anything.  As for the wait times you have 2 options. Either you pay separately for slices (which are ready to go, they just have to throw it in the oven for a minute to heat it up for you) or you can order a whole pie which can be anywhere from 20 minutes minimum to 45+ depending on if a whole bunch of other people ordered whole pies ahead of you. Yes you pay more in the end for separate slices but dont have to wait long. You save money if getting a whole pie but wait times fluctuate.  Service was just just ok. I asked the cashier why they dont serve ranch. He seemed annoyed and said \"Because pizza and ranch just does not go together!\" Now I can understand if you guys dont wanna serve it and people probably ask why all the time but you dont have to give me a crappy attitude about it.  So in the end I can say that I have tried it but dont plan on coming back. I think its overpriced for just mediocre pizza. $50 bucks and change for 1 whole pizza is a bit much. If you want to pay for overpriced pizza that is actually worth it I recommend going across the street to Pin Up Pizza or Grimaldi's at the Fashion Show or at the Venetian.

You can also take it to go and they pack it well. Entire pizza is like $28-$35 and easily feeds 4-6 with the option of eating in or boxed to go.   My favorite is the white pizza with ricotta, topped with crush red pepper flakes. Service has always been great as well. Friendly crew with engaging personalities. See ya next trip Secret Pizza.",

I've been to the Cosmo a couple of times so I'm shocked that I never noticed this awesome pizza spot (shame on me as a pizza lover), but honestly maybe we should keep it that way because it's delicious!   There's no sign to lead you down the hallway but if you are able to find it you'll be led to this small joint that has a couple of bar stool seats across the way from the cashier. It does get busy, but so happy it was still open at 1AM for a bite.   For $4-$5 a slice you can get a yummy slice of NY style pizza that is piping hot and melts in your mouth with each bite. Compared to other Vegas restaurants this is a steal and you can even get a whole pie for ~$25. We opted for a box of pepperoni & mushroom pizza and it was the perfect way to end the night!

My boyfriend and I had heard about Secret Pizza and always meant to visit but just never took the time to search it out. We made a point to find it today for lunch and I'm so glad we did.  I'm not sure what to say that hasn't already been written by fellow Yelpers, but this pizza is really good. One slice was enough for me for lunch. I ordered the sausage and peperoncini and thought it was great! My traditional guy had the cheese. Both had a thinner, crispy crust that New York-style devotees will covet. Both slices were hot and fresh. We also appreciated the friendliness of the staff and just how kind they were (makes a big difference to me... not sure how others feel about that). Our server was so polite and went through all of the available pizzas with us with patience. The prices were reasonable, even though I think they may be more than what has been mentioned in previous reviews. A potential downside is that there were only two chairs in the entire space, so this may be better as a \"grab and go\" option. Still, worth a visit! Super fun to feel like a Las Vegas insider as you effortlessly walk down the \"secret\" hallway.",

Gyuup only cool people know where this is located :P.   I was Ice skating at the Boulevard Rink and decided to grab a bite to eat, was starving! I ordered a meat lover's pizza for $5 bucks a slice, The slices are pretty huge and I love how the crust is so crusty loaded with garlic.. The pizza was awesome customer service was great, it was a quick in and out kinda pizza joint. The only thing i did not like about this place was if it gets too crowded in their people will be all up in your space! :P overall enjoyed my experience.",

The wine and white pizza are the best combo any time of night. The prices are affordable, and the fact that it's somewhat hidden makes it even more fun to encounter! It may take a while to get your food depending on when you go but its soooo soooo good! I wish they had more locations!",

Was stopped by an employee saying they were closed, I was perplexed as their hours of operation states it is until 5am. Asked to speak to the manager, blonde girl with glasses, she was no help. It's obvious that they just wanted to end their night early and not provide decent customer service to their guests. Absolute disrespect as they let others in before our party of 4. Will not be visiting this place ever again, it is unfortunate as the Cosmo is one of my favorite places to visit in Vegas.",

If you can't find seating inside there's plenty out by the pool table to relax and enjoy the atmosphere.

Cheesy without being overwhelming and heavy.  1 slice is all you really need to reach contentment unless you're someone with an over-sized appetite.  Pizza is always coming out fresh.  Huge globs of ricotta, total score.  I prefer my white pizzas a little on the creamier side, but this was good enough.  Can't complaint about a $5 slice if you're in Vegas.  Great for late night eats especially if you're staying at the hotel.  OVERALL:  Great people, love the man behind the counter.  Quick service as well.

I lived in PA with a east coast style pizzeria 50 steps from my front door. secret pizza is as close as it gets on the west coast. Even the hubby, who grew up in PA, said it was pretty darn close to an east coast slice. The pepperoni is a sliced a little thick, but other than that, it's spot on. The crust is soooooo good. Buyer beware! East coast pie is super greasy. That's how they roll. So, if that's an issue, this is not the place for you. I liked this place so much, that we will being stay at the Cosmo next year (annual trip to Vegas) because I learned I could have a pie delivered to my room if i stayed in the Cosmo. Can you say, 2am pie!   The line was pretty long, but they move quickly and are super friendly. Trust me, it;s worth the wait.",

I couldn't find the name anywhere but I did see a Yelp sticker on their glass pane so I knew the name was floating somewhere!    I literally thought we were going to grab a slice of pizza from the restaurant next door that was visible but don't be mistaken!  If you're looking for this place, it's in the same lounge area as the STK steakhouse near the pool table next to the restaurant with the wooden decor.  I just realized how ridiculous that sounded.  Anyhow, try the white pizza.  White sauce and balls of ricotta make it rich and heavy but perfect for a late night snack.  This slice was $3 and well worth it.  It's NY style but if you're not going to eat it that way, it could be floppy so fold it.  The crust is nicely crisp with a slight chewiness.  I hope that I and the 643 other reviewers weren't too incoherent to give it an accurate review but I think I know good pizza when I taste it!",

Food: The pizza is great, very flavorful and tastes extremely fresh late at night, early AM. I highly recommend the white slice.  Service: Service is great too, the lady behind the cash register was really nice and friendly to us, especially since it was our first time.  My only complaint was that I felt like $6 a slice wasn't really worth the pizza slice I was getting. Maybe if it was half the price, I would've given this place 5 stars.

Just wow. I've never tasted a pizza so good in my life. Seriously, a lot of moaning was going down with each bite I took. The pizza is pricey but really worth it. After finishing my first slice, I stood in line and got another. If I'm being totally honest I would have ordered a whole pizza pie for $28.25 if I knew I didn't have to share with my friends. 1,000% recommend.",

As everyone mentioned, it's located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan's Boulevard Tower.  If you're taking the escalator up to the floor, it's just straight ahead as you get off.  There's no sign.  Just a hallway filled with old LP covers.  There's some really good album jackets on the wall, might I add.  Personally, I would recommend grabbing a slice or two of their signature pie.  It's so simple, yet oh so delicious!  It was so good, I had to grab another slice that night after I stuffed myself silly at Bacchanal Buffet.",

After a long night at the nightclub or a long day at the dayclub, this pizza joint located right upstairs from the club is the perfect place to get your munchies on!   There always seems to be a long line but the lines move pretty fast. They give fatty slices of pizza and the cheese just melts in your mouth. Usually one slice already fills you up.   The only thing that I don't like is how much oil it contains. The pizzas are drenched in oil. Once you dab the oil off, its still good! For a whole pizza, its around $30. So definitely on the pricier side.",

The white pizza was a mixture of cheese and it was a crunchy, salty and garlicky piece of goodness. The sausage were actually slices versus little pieces.   We're trying to figure out how we can bring a box home with us on the plane.   So so so so good.",

Located in the third floor next to zuma-walk down a corridor that's looks like it is leading to a restroom, when in fact you will find a nice little diner with pin ball machines and arcade games! Seating is minimal - mostly for take away.   The pizza portions were huge going for 6$ a slice. I had an all dress pizza (3/5)as well as their ricotta cheese pizza with home made meatball slices (4/5-interesring touch with  the ricotta, balanced out the salt vs spicy kick I got with the added chillies). You can choose to get additional toppings. I ordered a draft beer as well, shock top, was perfect to have a cold drink with warm freshly baked pizza!  Service was so friendly! I believe it's a family owned business - definitely a local checkout to add to your list on the strip!!",

    "text": "While it's not much of a secret at this point, Secret Pizza is one of the Cosmo's most popular establishments despite no signage or listing on any of the directories. I don't feel like airing out the location completely, but try following the line of club goers on any evening to the restaurant floor of the Cosmo, where eventually they'll queue up in the hallway of records. It's not hard to find and as for the pizza, it's totally worth it.  This might serve as drunk pizza for some (or most), but the quality is definitely above the subpar slices on the Strip. This pizza is airy, thin sliced, and features the kind of ingredients that make it semi-reminiscent (#1) of stuff I'd find back in New York. I was impressed with their white pizza and regular cheese pie, though I was less fond of the pepperoni and the premium \"deluxe\" option. The latter is their signature pizza, which while tasty, isn't going to win over any diehard NY pizza lovers. Sobriety will really determine a lot of the emotional responses to these slices.  While it's clearly busy on the weekend nights, it's nearly dead in here during any week day afternoon. The staff and even the pizza is at its best around these times, and the secret spot is a good place to kill time over retro arcade games and the occasional drink. The lines aren't always a bad thing, but here's a pro tip: call in ahead time and just pick up the pizza later. Bonus points if you decide to let room service handle it all.  It's pricey for pizza at $5+ a slice (depending on topping) and ranges from $30-37 a pie. This is the Cosmo, where even a standard breakfast plate / potent cocktail is $16-20. The hype is more real here than most other eateries and certainly worth its weight in tastiness when the cravings get real.  _________ (#1) Keyword is \"Semi.\"",

The pizza here is sooo good though, you really don't mind the wait.  They have several toppings ready. You tell them which one you want and they heat it up. The pizza is thin crust and heated to perfection.  Now this is not just a place to go when you're drunk. Went around 12pm just a little after they opened and was still super good! They also have ample amounts of seasonings to sprinkle on your pizza - cheese, red chili flakes, oregano, and GARLIC!

My only beef with Secret Pizza is that it cost us a whopping $23 for 4 slices of pizza... The fact that it is open late just ups their game.  Secret Pizza is truly secret...it is not listed on the Cosmopolitan website...and there are no signs around the hotel telling you where it is. You have to find the hallway of album covers...which will lead you down the path to the gloriousness that is PIZZA! (Hint: It's located on the 3rd floor of the Eastside tower.)",

There is always a line after midnight, I've waited more than an hour before. Don't go too late though, they start running out and just give you the leftovers when it gets close to 5AM.  White pizza, topped with ricotta cheese, kinda garlic-y and I LOVE that they use ricotta cheese...so different, SO amazing! Meatball with ricotta pizza, a pairing you would never think of but trust me it's good! Banana peppers with pepperoni pizza, i love spicy pizza!!! Mushroom pizza, wonderfully small pieces of mushroom incorporated into the pizza, not just placed on top!",

But it's existence is no secret. (but you guessed that with the 3K something reviews, right?)  Anyway, we went here for late night and waited maybe 30 minutes in line. The reason it took so long was that folks were ordering whole pies and clogging up the pizza oven for those of us that just wanted a slice. WHAT GIVES! (jkjk)  I ordered the white pizza and at first didn't think it was much to write home about, but now look at me, days after my trip, still pining over it.   So yeah. You should go. Wait in the line.

Located inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel on 3/F (it's at the end of that funky tunnel), Secret Pizza opens until 4-5am pretty much every night, and is my #1 go-to spot for drunchies in Vegas.   You can order pizza by the box (your choice for toppings) or by slice (depends on what they have made). There are two kinds of pizza--thin slice or thick slice. I ordered 3 slices (don't judge...): a thin slice of peperoni, a thick slice of peperoni, and a thick slice of veggie w/ ricotta. To be honest I could barely finish one slice...the generous size of the slice and amount of cheese and toppings makes the pizza extremely filling, I only ordered this many slices because I was starving after dayclubbing for hours at marquee XD I prefer the thin slices, actually, because I feel like the thick slices are waaaaayyy too much and even though it's delicious, it made me feel a little gross afterwards.   Overall, I could give this place a thousand stars if I could and everyone NEEDS this pizza in their belly right now. :D",

Big, satisfying slices, with good quality cheese, the right quantity of sauce, and plentiful toppings. The pepperoni was meaty and delicious, and the mushrooms were great, if chopped a little small.   Sure, it's a bit of a gimmick, but it's fun. Check it out. If you can find it. :)",

It could be months, even years, between Vegas trips and yet Secret Pizza is that go-to joint when you need great tasting grub that is cheap and will fill you up. Its especially the place to go late at night.   First-timers in Vegas will ask you where you got that huge pizza slice. Its a nondescript shop with no signage so for anyone wanting to find this place you pretty much just take the Cosmopolitan escalator all the way to the top floor, spot the narrow entranceway where people are walking out with boxes of pizza.  If you go before people are let out the clubs, its a brisk stroll up to the front of the line and the pizza comes out as soon as you put in your order. The combo deluxe slice is my favorite ($6.00) but I had the Veggie too and it was not bad. Seems like all their pie slices hit the spot. Plus, its always comforting to see the same dude in the New Era baseball cap working here every time I come.   Not really a secret anymore but still churning out great pizza. This place is awesome.  Except that one time Joe Thornton from the San Jose Sharks was a douchebag and tried to cut everyone. Thats a story for another time...  Tip: There's a nice spot with couches around a pool table where you can enjoy your pizza away from the cramped close quarters of this narrow pizza joint.",

Absolutely loved this stop on my tour of the Cosmo  Food: 5, Atmosphere: 4, Service: 4 Cost to worth it rating: 3 Return worthiness : yes! Eve award: one of the best slices I've had  Highlights: - Pizza: amazing. Perfect chewy yet crispy crust, fresh tomato sauce, and tasty toppings. I'm gonna go out and say it's one of my favorite ever and one of the best things I ate on this trip. It's so good, I can't do it justice in the description. - Toppings: stoked they had meatball and ricotta. Thinly sliced huge circles of meat were fantastic  - Open late: we went at 3am on a Sunday  - Atmosphere: small spot you get to in a long hallway with a few pies out for slices and pinball machines.  Lowlights:  - Wasn't in the hotel we were in and didn't discover it until our last night there so only had it once :-/  Loved this pizza and can't wait to have it again!",

Took quite a while to get our pizza pie of half cheese half pepperoni, but overall it was a pretty good deal - 10 slices for around $30 rather than one for $4.50. However to me, it's just your average pizza, and nothing special stood out to me. Not too greasy, thin crust, and a good amount of cheese...maybe I like more hearty pizzas myself...  In trying to understand the hype, it must be rated so high b/c most people that get food here are likely drunk or really hungry from clubbing...to me, the best thing wasn't the pizza, but rather the secrecy aspect - with no signs indicating where it is, I like that a parlor like this can be inside the Cosmo. Kind of like a pizza-speakeasy I suppose ;)",

I have to say, the pizza is amazing. The white pizza is a must have when going here. The only thing is that it's quite on the pricey side (like everything at Vegas), so don't expect to be full after a slice or two. Per slice starts at $5 and goes up from there. Also get a fat tuesday or soda from the street, because soda is $4 a can here.",

The line took around 45 minutes and we ordered two pizzas which took another 45 minutes to make. We ended up getting the pizza around 5AM.   Food: WHAT?!? I waited that long for that kind of pizza?! It wasn't horrible, and maybe it's just because I was extremely tired but I wouldn't wait more then 20 minutes for that ever again.   All pizzas are 18 inches and 10 slices.   White pizza ricotta and mozzarella cheese: I love cheese and this was super cheesy! The pizzas are very thin. When you pick it up, it might just fall all over your lap. It was definitely not as flavorful as I thought it would be. $18  Five topping: Sliced sausage, pepperoni, green peppers, onions and black olives. This pizza was a little better, but it still lacked something that could just put it all together. It was also pretty messy with all the toppings falling off the pizza. $25",

It's located by STK and Scarpetta. The wait can be long especially late night after clubbing. However, it gets pretty empty during lunch hour.  There are a few stools along the walls of the restaurant, but don't expect to sit. It's not what you call a dine-in restaurant. Moreso a grab and go type of establishment.  The pizza is thin, crispy, and pretty good. At times the toppings slides right off which is a little irritating, but I always end up folding it in half anyhow.  Suggestion: supreme. And for some reason ordering a whole pie tastes a whole lot better than ordering just a slice. We ordered a whole pizza and a drink which ended up costing 50-something. With those prices, I'd expect amazing, but it was just good. That is why Secret Pizza gets 4 stars instead of 5.",

If you think that, you obviously have either never been to NY, or were unfortunate enough to eat at one of the bad pizza spots. The positive reviews for this place must come from people who were completely obliterated when they ate here; that is the only way I can imagine anyone believing this to be good pizza. I came here with my husband after having a few drinks recently because Holstein's, our first choice, was closed. After waiting in line for 30 mins, we finally got our two slices. He ordered pepperoni and I had a regular slice; both were the most bland, dry, unappetizing pizza I have ever tried. There was next to no sauce on the pizza, and it tasted as if it had been under a heating lamp all day. Being that the place was extremely busy, the pizza coming out should not taste this way. Coming from NYC, I admit I have high expectations for pizza, but I've tasted better frozen pizza from Walmart. Not only did we have to stand in line for so long to get this disgusting food, but we had to eat our food standing against a wall because the place is so tiny. I would never waste my time, money, or the calories on this pizza again.",

I had a pepperoni and sausage pizza slice and another slice that had meatballs, sausage, green peppers, and olives.  The latter was recommended by one of the workers there.  The pepperoni and sausage pizza was ok.  The other slice didn't really have much taste.  I had an oily film-like taste on my tongue that I couldn't wash down with Coke, but went away after 45 minutes.  haha.  This place is designed to be like a small pizza joint with a couple TVs to watch sports.  They just had a few side tables with 5 barstools.  If it gets a little busy, you just have to find space and stand.   The only cool thing about this place was that it was hidden and had an interesting time finding this place.  Note, it didn't take long after asking the concierge.  =)  As a local, it wasn't worth going to the Strip just to go to this place.  Factor in the Strip prices for food, I would not go back to this place, unfortunately.   Grimaldi's is still the best in my opinion.",

Next to the Blue Ribbon Sushi restaurant on the 3rd floor, there is a hallway decorated with old album covers.  Walking down this hallway will lead you to the pizzeria.  You can order an entire pizza or get a previously prepared pizza by the slice.  You can also add toppings to a slice of cheese pizza and they'll warm it up and blend in the extra toppings.  They have PBR and Dogfish 90 beer on tap.  The restaurant is inexpensive and the pizza is delicious.  The pizzeria is sparsely decorated with a few chairs, a pinball machine and some stand up bar tables to eat your pie.  This is the best place I've been to on the strip to order a quick inexpensive slice of pizza.  The employees are very helpful with good advice on what to order.

Be careful if you choose to end your night there...there tends to be alot of drunken club-goers...which is great for people watching...most of the girls are a mess...they're either drunk, or acting drunk, shoes are off, hair is a mess, makeup all smudged and the spanx has given up!

    "text": "They really need to put a sign up, because this place is darn near impossible to find without asking someone.  Maybe it's their secret way of keeping the place hidden and away from all the tourists.   Just find the public billiard table in the open floor, and then look for a long dark hallway which seems like it's a private entrance for staff.  Once you walk the long dark hallway, you will walk into a small pizza shop, and the smell of fresh pizza will immediately engulf you!  My friends split a cheese pizza, white pizza, and a pepperoni, olive, and mushroom pizza.  The line can get long, so be prepared to wait!  Once you order, the server will take your slice of pizza and bake it in the oven for a few minutes to get it nice and melty.  I believe a pizza slice comes out to be around $4 per slice.  I thought the price was slightly high since it was a super thin crust, and the slices didn't seem all that big.   The pizza was pretty good, but definitely not as good as the stuff served in NY.  I did not care for the white pizza, but the cheese and pepperoni pizza was pretty good.   Also, the crust was slightly chewy, which I did not like, but I really liked the cheese and spices they topped on the pizza.  One slice of pizza is like an appetizer, so I would suggest you order 2-3 slices a person, if you want to actually get filled up or eat it as a dinner.    I'd come back for a late night snack or an afternoon appetizer if I'm in the area, but it's not something I would walk from Wynn to Cosmo to eat.  Pretty good pizza, but not good enough to crave, especially with all the other eats in Vegas.",

I had to eat it the next morning because I fell right to sleep because I was drunk.  I got popped in the microwave and it was good!!  So the next night after another night of partying, but this time I wasnt drunk.  We bought pizza.  It was delicious!!   The first night, we were at Marquee partying and of course we were hungry.  We went to the 3rd floor and saw a bunch of girls eating the pizza and had to ask.  It was in a hallway and there is no name or poster or anything indicating that a pizza place was there.  But you can smell.  This was a saturday night and it was a long line.  We waited about 20 minutes.  The pizzas looked good.  We got about 10 slices of pizza and paid about less than $40.   The next night which was Sunday, there was no line at 3am.  We waited a couple minutes and ate it right there.

The sweet smell of cheese and tomato sauce isn't helping, just follow your nose and it will lead you to the secret hallway to the place they call Secret Pizza.  If you found the secret because the line is a mile long, sorry it's going to feel like a century to get in. I would avoid it between 12-2am, but they close at 5, so get your timing right! You can always call for a whole pie. The prices are pretty cheap for Vegas.  For those not staying at Cosmo, it's great because there is plenty of seating outside.",

This place was a recommendation of some friends of mine who found it earlier this year when staying at the Cosmo.  With the help of Yelp reviews for this place, I was able to find the mystery hallway without much issue.  And lucky for us, at 3am this past Friday morning wasn't a busy time.  Waited 5 minutes to get our slices.  The pizza was piping hot, and went down fast.  Very good, possibly assisted by having  late-night munchies, but I'd come back again on another trip.",

My friends and I left Drai's Nightclub to take a cab to the Cosmopolitan and seek out this hidden gem. We waited ~40 minutes in line.  I don't really even know what I ordered, but it was a slice with red sauce, pepperoni, mushrooms, and some other toppings. It was really good. But I might just think so because I had a good amount of alcohol in my system. As soon as I finished my slice, I grabbed the crust off of my friend's plate and finished that as well. Heh...  $6 per slice. Not much seating. Take your precious pizza and go.  By the way, it's located on the 3rd floor somewhere in between two restaurants... not sure. I was intoxicated. Just follow the drunk people!",

The line for this place was nearly out the door when I came on Christmas Day, which was also my very 1st visit here. I can see why the lines are so long...because it's the only affordable place to eat inside the Cosmo! The pizza itself is decent depending on what you get. I got 2 slices: pepperoni and sausage/banana pepper. The pepperoni one was alright...I've definitely had better at cheaper price points. the sausage and banana pepper one was pretty damn good though and it was a good combo together. I'd come back for that one.  Slices range around the price of 5 bucks each depending on what kind you get. Cheese slices are under $5, while ones with tons of toppings will push the price closer to $6. Whole pies are around $26-30 and may be a cheaper option if you're wanting more than 4 slices. Drink selection is sparse here, and bottled beer is 8 bucks! I guess it is the Strip though...They had a water cooler there but it was broken. Thanks for putting a sign on there to let us know because a few customers and I tried messing with it and wondered why nothing would dispense.   I would come back here but only if I were already near the Cosmo. It's definitely not worth the drive down. I'd much rather drive to Metro Pizza or Costco for cheaper and more tasty pies.",

There's that so-called pizza place.  We came here with Stephen's mom and each got a slice of something different. We wanted 3 diet cokes, and the guy suggested getting a 2-liter of diet coke for $6.50 versus 3 separate cup of cokes for $4 each.  Wow, what a nice guy!  He could have easily had a $12 sale on drinks, but saved us $5.50.  So 3 slices plus a 2-liter came to $22.  We took our slices down the hall and watch snotty 12 year olds attempt to play billiards.  Secret pizza is, IMHO, the hidden gem of Las Vegas.",

There is a long line, but its worth the wait because the pizza is sooo damn good! The pizza reminds me a of a new york pizza. Its big, thing and the crust is super crispy. Its about 3-4 dollars a slice and my oh my it is totally worth EVERY Penny! I got the pepperoni and meatball pizza, and a peppericni, bell pepper, and turkey?? slice. They were all delicious! And on top of that, I was short 50 cents on cash and the guy was nice enough to just give me the two slices for 9 dollars. THat is really good customer service :)",

    "text": "A few of my friends kept raving about this pizza place inside Cosmopolitan.  Telling me I had to try it.  So in the middle of our clubbing session at Marquee we left the club to go get some pizza.  This place is hidden on the second floor in between Blue Ribbon Sushi + Jaleo.  It's hidden, if you were just walking by, you'd never know it was a pizza joint down that long hallway.  Once you reach the end of the hallway you go into this little area with a Galactica (is that how you spell it?) arcade game and a pinball machine.  The minute we walked in we were greeted by the pizza maker, Nico.  He was very personable and explained what would make a good slice.  We start off with a basic cheese slice, a pepperoni slice or a white slice and make \"magic\" at the end.  We told him to surprise us so he made us a white pizza w/ roasted tomatoes and basil + garlic.  Second slice was meatball w/ green peppers.  This is the BEST pizza I have ever had.  I used to love Rocco's pizza in Summerlin, but now that I've tasted this, it is ultimately the best pizza.  The price is very reasonable.  It's $3.00 and $0.50 per topping.   This is a great go to place after clubbing.  It's hard to explain how good this pizza is.  I'm not a big pizza eater, but this place makes me want to eat a whole pie.  Definitely worth a try if you're ever at the Cosmo.  Remember, it's on the second floor in between Blule Ribbon Sushi + Jaleo.",

It's not much of a secret, seeing as though I've heard about it a long time ago, but I guess the \"secret\" comes from no signage and it being down a long hallway on the 3rd flor of the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas. The pizza was very good. I had a slice of white pizza and a slice of sausage and peppercini. Now, the pizza was very good, but this is in a city full of horrible pizza. Also, the pizza is pricey, about $6 a slice, and $30.00 for a 16inch pie... Worth checking out if you're a Vegas local or a tourist in the area. There is no seating in the shop but plenty of seating in front of the art gallery/showcase common area a few feet away from Secret Pizza's entrance.",

    "text": "I wish this place could stay a secret forever.   Had it not been for my fellow yelpers I would have never found this place. Like everyone else has said-it's down a long hallway of album covers with a pinball machine at the end thinly sandwiched between 2 other restaurants on the 3rd floor, behind the game area. If you really need anymore help, just go to the Cosmo's website and look at the building floor plans. It can be pretty hard to find.   At the end of the skinny, slightly creepy hallway, it's as if you've set foot in the type of pizza shop you see pretty much everywhere except Las Vegas.  It's $3.00 a slice, which may seem steep but by the standards of The Strip that might as well be free (The Strip is the place where bottles of water can be as high as $4.00 and the dollar menu doesn't even exist at McDonald's people).  They offer parmesan, oregano, garlic powder, red pepper flakes and pepper on the tables, which is perfect but at the same time rather unnecessary - this pizza is good enough without flavor enhancement. The crust is so good, it's burnt enough to be really crispy, but not burnt enough to just taste.....burnt. The cheese was bubbly and piping hot. My only gripe is that it was a little bit too greasy, but I'm willing to overlook that.   Two slices of pepperoni pizza and drink (with as many free refills as you want) came out to be: $10.81. Not bad at all for The Strip.  Let's hope this stays a ~*secret*~ for as long as possible, and let's hope that when it eventually stops being a secret that the owners won't see that as reason to jack up the prices. *sarcastic grin*",

    "text": "Let me get the logic behind Secret Pizza.  They're opened to 4-5 a.m.  The drunk and partially drunk slur their way in to get that \"sober me up munchies\" on.  Wouldn't you want a sign up to attract more customers?  How passively cruel is that to the wobbly and incoherent?   Wandering like zombies seeking to feed, one could only chuckle at the priceless visual as they search for Secret Pizza.    Contrarians (sober people) would say signs would defeat the purpose of their marketing goal...it wouldn't be called SECRET PIZZA...logic is never logic if drunk.  Through the corridor on the right of the Japanese restaurant within the Cosmopolitan, you'll find Secret Pizza.  There I said it.  If that's not enough, you're probably too drunk to even eat.  Within this hallway is a massive collection of interesting prints of musicians.  I think they were musicians.  The pizza aroma pulled my attention away from the pictures.      My monstrous hunger, which developed from searching the menu, told me to get two slices.  Give up looking for a poster board list menu or what have you.  Just ask, because there are none.  Peering down through the glass, I eventually chose the meat lovers and the cheese with white sauce.    Pizzas are the thin crust.  My crusts were a tad burnt on the edges after the oven warm up; each crispy bite was filled with a healthy (so to speak) dose of cheese and ingredients.  Both slices were delicious.  Both had surprisingly good taste considering since they were just thrown into an oven and reheated for a minute.    No time for a sit down dinner, want a quick slice (or whole pizza), or need some grease to relieve your drunkenness.  Secret Pizza can be a strong option.  That is, if you can find it.",

SO, ordered a sausage, green pepper, and garlic pizza pie. Yes, it cost around $20+ but it was sooooo worth it. The menu is simple and your not gonna find a whole lot of fancy food items, just the regular stuff (Pepperoni, sausage, cheese, peppers, onions, etc.). Did I mention that they serve beer? Sure, the cheap stuff, but you cant go wrong with delicious pizza and cheap beer. The joint is small, AND I MEAN SMALL, a couple counter tops and a few arcade games and pinball machines. I recommend taking your order to go. If you want, theres a small game lounge area across from the entrance where you can sit and enjoy your delicious pizza.",

Sounds like a stupid movie: Me: Hey, where are we going? Friend: Secret pizza place. Me: Oh? What's it called? Friend: It's Secret Pizza place. Me: Yeah, you said, that, but what's it called? ...... And the endless conversation continues.  Me, being in a Vegas state of mind, didn't really realize what they were all talking about until I saw a whole bunch of pizzas in front of me.  Smelling in the delicious aromas, I quickly came to and got to difficult task of choosing my slice.  But was it ever really a choice.  White pizza with meatballs please.  Yes, that was definitely the right decision.  I enjoyed every bite.  The crust is perfectly savory, and the cheese and toppings combine for a perfect treat for your tastebuds.  I almost wish I got two slices, but the line was too long to get back in, so I settled for just one.  As for the location of this \"secret pizza\" place, I could go all Gossip Girl on you and say \"Well, that's a secret I'll never tell\", but honestly, even I really have no idea where it is.  Maybe next time I'll map this place out for all you yelpers out there.  Or just read the other reviews as it seems some other people on here were actually coherent when they came here.  Just find it.  It's worth it!",

My boyfriend stumbled upon this place some months back and would not stop raving about it to me. \"Have you heard about the secret pizza place at the Cosmo?!! IT'S UNREAL!\" I loved how he genuinely \"found it\" while exploring the Cosmo, considering how we are accustomed to relying on Yelp on finding new places to eat now. We recently had a chance to visit Vegas together and omg, he hit the nail on the head!  The White Pizza is basically cheese pizza with roasted garlic...super simple. However, the cheese will make you swoon. The mozzarella was perfectly melted and the mounds of light ricotta will make your eyes roll to the back of your head. I believe there was a bit of fresh basil on the slice as well. I'm usually not a fan of most pizza crusts but this was perfectly thin & crunchy. SO GOOD! I have to note that I was NOT drunk at the time, so take my word ;)   *Couple of notes: -Open VERY VERY late! Great place to hit up after Marquee. -$5 per slice, but you can order a whole pie if you'd like.  -It's secret for a reason. Try not to read the Yelp reviews for the location and find it for yourself. The search for it is part of its charm :)",

I was at Marquee the night before but didn't go... but I could see how it would've tasted amazing at the time.  Got a whole pie for $30 Sunday around noon and there was barely a wait. The pizza was pretty good but definitely not the best I've ever had. We also got some of the pickled peppers which were pretty good though slightly sweet. Four of us split the pizza -- at $8/person it's a pretty good deal for Vegas, and you'll definitely feel full.",

    "text": "So, are you going to troll through everyone else's reviewzzz to find out the exact location?  Nah.  Just read this.  I'll give you precisely what you need to know.  Cosmo. Third floor. Just behind the pool/billiards table with retro lounge seating and shag rug. Between what is (at the moment) Blue Ribbon Sushi and a cylindrical mini-elevator. Down the little hallway lined with kitschy music memorabilia. And... you're there. (Not So) Secret Pizza.  After a couple of years, it ain't much of a secret anymore.  And it's cashing in.  What once was only three Georges a slice, is now at least an Abe per.  Still, probably the least expensive, hot-- or at least warmed-- meal in this mega-hotel.  Pizzas are already baked, sliced and, oddly, re-distributed and... arranged miscellaneously back into pizza rounds??  Yup.  Presumably so you can see all the varieties in one glance at one pie.  Just peruse the mish-mash of slice variety and choose what you want.  They then throw it in an oven for a minute-- and only a minute, in my case.  Move to the left, pay the cashier.  Dispense some agua from the cooler, gulp it down, then step back and wait for your order.  Sausage slice was quite good.  The everything with green peppers was nothing special.  There are *maybe* three seats next to the counter where you line up.  Usually taken though.  Or just take your Secret Pizza back out to the pool table area.  You might have a smidge better luck snagging a seat there.  But if not, just stand there and chomp your slices, it's kool.  Guaranteed, someone around that lounge area will hit you up.  Conversation at the very least.  Ah yes.  Nothing like a kid getting his first legal taste of alcohol in a public environment.  Classic.  Just standing around, dazed, taking swigs from a giant malt liquor bottle.  \"Hi where you guys from... I live here, yeah in Vegas... never had a f*k*g drink before... I f*k*g just turned 21 so going out tonight getting f*k*g wasted... these my friends we're just hanging getting f*kd up actually I live here in vegas.  No f*k*g way, you look like you're 23.  Do you drink.. f*k*g never had f*k*g alcohol until tonight do you do weed, no.. oh okay that's okay, i f*k*g do it all the f*k*g time it's the f*k*g best.  yeah i'm in some f*k*g classes, i go to paul mitchell salon school uggh shittt it's ok, nah, it sucks... well it's, no i f*k*g hate it, hate school.  f*k*g live with my mom it sucks... f*k*g hate it because she's with some f*k*g d*k f*k*g a-hole now.  do you have kids, no... alright, that's so kool, i f*k*g hate kids they're so f*k*g obnoxious f*k*g hate 'em, my f*k*g mom's trying to have more f*k*g kids and i f*k*g can't stand the sight of them so f*k*g annoying give me f*k*g headache all the f*k*g time.  f*k*g kids are the f*k*g worst.  well nice to meet you, have a good time here.\"  And with that, he just wandered off with his friends.  Zachariah, wherever you are:  glad it was a memorable 21st.  You won't remember watching us pig out on Secret Pizza or talking to us.  Probably won't even remember being at the Cosmo.  Buck up kiddo, you got your 25th to look forward to someday; you don't want to be too high-- for some of it anyway.",

This time, I'm eating here, damn it! I've heard so much about you, I'm coming in for some grub! =]  Literally, located in a hole in the middle of nowhere (well, next to the pool tables in the Cosmo), there is no sign, no nothing, but a long long hallway that seems to be perhaps a janitor closet or something. Walk in, it's officially a hidden pizza shoppe, like BAM!!!!!!! Simple, straight forward, and loaded with oils/fats. This is definitely THEE perfect place to go to after drinking and partying your ass off at a club to sober up.  However, for my friends and I, this place was a tad too greasy (sorry, had to minus a star for that! XP) for our sober middle of the day breakfast/lunch/brunch. Yet I can see the appeal of such greasy goodness in the middle of the night, when you stumble drunk like no other out a club, and crave some hot, fresh out the oven pizza.  In essence, a good pit stop to try out for sure, better when you're drunk, but if you're sober, bring plenty of napkins to sop up the grease! =]",

We were in the Cosmo late and found Secret Pizza. The line was long but it wasn't terrible. While part of me was expecting salty greasy cardboard I had high hopes because of the great reviews- and I wasn't disappointed! 4 stars instead of 5 because there isn't really much seating and the selection of pizza styles was pretty limited if you just want one piece vs an entire pie. While $6 is pretty steep for a slice, it's not bad for a meal in Vegas- especially one that is open so late!",

The huge pepperoni slices and sliced meatballs was filling, but it would have tasted better with ham.   Not very many seats and it gets crowded because of the small space inside. We ordered a fresh made whole pizza and took it outside to sit on the large couches inside Cosmo. It was much more comfier outside and less noisy.   I liked it, but I wish they had ham.",

It's a great place to get pizza after everything else is closed (or even before) whole or just a slice, though getting a whole pie is cheaper than getting a few slices, and you get to look cool coming out with a pizza box. People will envy you. The white pizza is really good, and so is the plain cheese. It gets pricey when you want to get drinks and dessert from them as well, and sometimes, depending on the time, you might have to wait for a while. The staff has always been very nice; one time we ordered a whole pizza, and the guy ended up burning one half. He gave us the good half and made another one, so we got half a pizza for free, but had to wait a half hour extra (if you get a whole pie be prepared to wait a while). Overall the pizza is pretty good for being right on the strip, and it's great for late night hungry pains.",

    "text": "This joint is not trying to bring Grimaldi's, John's, Totonno's, or any of the other notable pizza restaurants in New York to Las Vegas.  Instead, it channels those \"street slice\" pizzerias you first stop at because you're hungry when you walk by, and then later because you know it's there.  You might not even know the name; it's just \"That pizza place on Bleecker Street.\"  The unmarked entrance on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan echoes the phenomenon perfectly.  For many twenty-somethings, stopping for a slice after hitting the bars has also become a way of life, and this place brings that experience to Las Vegas.  Of course, it does so at Vegas prices, which means you're paying an outrageous $5 for a slice of pizza.  More problematic is a potential wait in excess of 15 minutes thanks to the raging popularity of this place.  The pizza is actually decent for what it's trying to ape.  It looked like a greasy mess when it was handed to me, but the crust is vaguely crispy without being crumbly, and the cheese actually adds some quality flavor instead of just adding weight and texture.  I've had far worse pizza-by-the-slice in New York itself.  Las Vegas has so many good eats that I can't really recommend making this a destination you go out of your way to check out.  However, if you're passing through the Cosmopolitan or you're stumbling around and get the urge to show off your hipness, you can grab a slice and then write a 5-star review on Yelp calling this place \"Las Vegas's Best Kept Secret\" too.",

I thought the pizza was definitely great quality and tasted great and the slices were pretty big, but was it worth the long ass wait? I think not. Glad we got to try it, but I feel like you could probably get something of equal yummy, greasiness for a shorter wait and more reasonable price.

At $4.50 a slice served on paper plates, I expected to be wowed. Not even the help serving were cordial, kind, or even gracious. I've been treated better at Sbarros and paid much less. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. There is barely a place to sit, unless you want to perch yourself on a makeshift shelf and unmatched bar stools.",

He told us, which is a good thing, as it's not marked, nor  obvious when you pass the hallway leading to the pizzeria, nestled among very nice restaurants on an upper floor.  That fact alone made it fun.    We had some late night slices which were cheap and very, very tasty.  So much so we went back the next day for lunch.     If you're in the area and want a great, NY style slice, seek this place out.    I'm a definite fan.",

    "text": "When you're drunk and you've just stumbled out of the club at 3AM, there's nothing quite as welcoming as an enormous, warm, cheesy slice of pizza. I'd heard of Secret Pizza from both a friend and by reading around online, and my friends and I had to try it post-partying at one of the clubs nearby. It's on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan - I think the elevator dumps you just outside the corridor that leads you straight to heaven/the restaurant (just follow the delicious smell all the way down!). It's cafeteria style - you walk down the line and ogle every different kind of pizza they have, and then pick which slice you want. My favorite one was the supreme (I think...I'm sorry! It was 3AM! The facts are fuzzy). I think it ran about $6 a slice, which might differ depending on what pizza you get.   There's a few seats right there in the tiny room, but most people congregated over to the couches and chairs just outside the corridor entrance. The guys working there were super nice and funny; I'm sure they deal with the drunk crowd all the time, so they sure know how to deal with them. Definitely a great little Vegas gem - open late, inexpensive, and PIZZA. What more could you ask for?",

    "text": "Thank you Yelp for introducing me to this sweet little hot spot in Vegas! While doing a restaurant search for my surrounding area this place popped up with 4 stars and over 500 reviews. So I thought, \"500 people can't be wrong, right?\" And I was right!   Once we got into the Cosmopolitan we had to ask someone how to get there because there are literally no signs- not even on the outside. So for future reference, you go up to the 3rd level on the escalator. Once you get off the escalator there is a weird tube-looking elevator directly in front of you. Then, just to the right of that is an inconspicuous little hallway- it's in there! Follow your nose!  This pizza is crispy thin and the slices are HUGE! I had 2 slices and it was plenty! They also have this really yummy white pizza made with lots of yummy cheeses. I would say this is the top 3 best pieces of pizza I have ever had and I have been to New York AND Chicago!   The only bad part is this place is real tiny and there isn't much room to sit. Other than that, GO! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!",

    "text": "Labor Day Weekend. Driving into Vegas 1:30 am and general consensus was that we were all mother lovingly hungry! Way too late and way too lazy for nightclubs so this seemed like the best decision. Couple friends from Norcal haven't had the chance to try it and assured them we were definitely gettin' it in!!!   Was late into the wee hours of the night but man the line was damn knarly! First time I went it was in the afternoon and there was definitely nothing like it was at that moment. Line was wayyyy out the hallway (which where the name Secret Pizza name empasizes) into the hotel walkway. Even with such a long line, wait didn't seem so terribly long... That always seems to be the case though when you're surrounded by good company and drunk people!   There were six of us and at $5.25 per slice, we opted for buying a whole pie instead ($28). It was and extra 20-30 minute wait but price wise would say it's definitely worth it. We went with the White pie and you can't go wrong with a crowd favorite! Came out piping hot! But I'm sure it always does since it's always does since it's always so busy... Something about an entire pie dedicated to you that makes it taste THAT much better.  That white sauce instead of a traditional red sauce was amazinggg. That light and airy ricotta cheese crumbling all in my maofz... So good. Slices were very large and we were still left with 2 extra slices which I had very little hesitation taking since the girls didn't want to eat much since day club the next day! (Score for the dudes! haha)   We ended up coming back the next day and was just as good even though we were no where near as sober! Highlight goes too the awesome soundtrack going on that night! Singing Phil Collins rendition of \" You Can't Hurry Love\" with a hallway of strangers was the best feeling everrrrrrr!   Great spot to make as part of the Vegas experience!... Or to get some really good pizza :)!",

Apparently, my friends were able to have their pizza delivered to their room here once but we weren't able to do that this time. So a couple of tips...call in your order if you're getting a whole pizza so it'll be ready to go when you get there. Go during the day when lines are non-existent or expect at least an hour wait when you go after the clubs close.   I'm bumping them up to five stars because the prices are fair, the pizzas are fresh....AND they hooked it up with free samples last time I was here. FREE SECRET PIZZA?! Are you friggin kidding me? That's like winning the jackpot!",

Be sure to ask someone where it is located since their are no signs pointing you to the pizza place and once you are there, no logo, but you see a bunch of people eating pizza outside which points you in the right direction.  The place is very small and and has only 4 chairs. They have some pies ready made, once you choose your slice they will reheat them and hand them over to you.  Slices range from about $5-7 depending on the toppings. Whole pies are over $25  Drinks are refillable Parmasian, oregano, red pepper offered at stations.  Will be back!",

It's even better if you are conveniently staying at the Cosmo or find yourself starving there after a night of clubbing at Marquee.  I agree with Jessica Y., Earl of Sandwich has some competition for best late-night, cheap eats hot spot.  Be warned though, the line is out the door (narrow unmarked hallway to be precise) come 2am.  I highly recommend the classic pepperoni.  Perfect ratio of sauce to cheese to meat.  Their crust is thin and crunchy.  White pizza is also really good, but you might want to consider adding some meat to it because sometimes cheese doesn't cut it.  You can order by the slice or order a whole pie, but it will take at least 30 minutes for them to make a whole one for you.",

We ordered a whole pepperoni $28.50. We were there at 6ish on a Tuesday. No line.   The service was cool - not sure what the name of the super chill guy was who took our order or the gentleman who made our pizza but they were awesome.   Mr. Order Taker looked at Mr. Pizza Maker and said \"What, 20 min?\" cook shook his head \"Nah, 15!\" Sweet! & sure enough 15 min later we had our pizza.   They'll do 1/2 orders too - half white half what have you.   Flavor:   The Pepperoni used was SALTY and gave me this bitter after taste. It's weird.. It has a great flavor but the salty was too much. Or was it the cheese?    Can't taste the sauce. It's almost only there to keep the pizza from getting dry. I'm a big sauce person so this was a downer. Maybe next time we'll try to get extra sauce.   Crust was good and.. Er.. Crusty. I love crust. I love carbs.   So, overall... Eh. Buuuuut... I wasn't drunk. Maybe that's where I messed up? Hahaha. And I mean, like I said \"next time\" so, I'll come back & I'll try the white sauce.   I give it a Three, my Hubs gives it a 4 - but he can get his own Yelp account =P",

    "text": "It was a late Friday night (heck who are we kidding it was early Saturday morning haha) and after a day of driving/watching NBA Summer League, followed by a night of gambling, my hunger was showing itself in the worst way. I remembered coming across this pizza place on Yelp that was apparently some secret spot inside the Cosmopolitan, so I decided to try and find it. Well, let's just say it was pretty easy to find. The line of people extending beyond the vinyl cover-laden hallway totally gave it away! While my stomach was dying for me to ditch the 30-minute line and go somewhere with quicker service, my desire to try this pizza based on the reviews and pics on Yelp prevailed! I finally got to the front of the line and ordered a slice of the meatball pizza. The thin crust hit the spot and the meatballs tasted super authentic. The cheese was the perfect quantity and not overly greasy. Everything was top notch! My wife ordered a slice of cheese pizza and enjoyed it as well. They don't have many options outside of pizza (they serve salad but were sold out by the time we got there)--but hey, if you're coming here, you better be coming for the famous pie!",

This place is perfect for vegas because pizza is the perfect quick meal before AND after the club. One bad thing about it is that everyone else agrees to this so the line gets pretty long late at night. But if you go during the day for a quick lunch, you should be fine.   I got the mushroom pizza and also the veggie. Both were excellent. $5.50 per slice of $28 for the whole pan to share with your friends. We loved it so much, we made 3 trips!   The entrance to this place is already chic to match the luxury of Cosmo Hotel. It's a narrow walkway with the walls decorated with classic record covers and there's a few seating inside but also an awesome lounge area right outside. It feels like you're chilling in a $2million apartment in uptown NY if you get a pan of pizza and eat it in the lounge area with your friends.   I love the fact that it's a \"secret\" place but more people should know about this place because it's fabulous!",

It's open into the wee hours of the night which makes it a great spot to come to after a fun night of Vegas shenanigans. Expect a long wait if you're going to Vegas on a big holiday weekend or during the summer though (I've had to wait close to 40 minutes in agonizing pain before...thanks, heels).  They offer a variety of pizzas, and I always go with some sort of meat combo. It's served NY style and is a perfect thin crust. Slices come out to be around $5 or more depending on the toppings your pizza has. Affordable for Vegas, but $5 for a slice of pizza is pretty ridiculous elsewhere. Their slices are also pretty greasy which is a downside and definitely doesn't sit too well especially when you're drunk off your butt; delicious for the time being but regretful afterwards.   All in all, it's a good spot to come to when you're in Vegas and want a decent slice of pizza. The fact that it's \"secret\" and is located through a corridor also makes it a pretty cool spot.",

It's such a secret that it's not listed in The Cosmopolitan Casino directory and there is no restaurant sign with the name. So how does one find such a place? There's three options:  1. Yelp  2. Ask customer service 3. I'll tell you the secret! It's located on the 3rd floor of The Cosmopolitan between Milo's and Blue Ribbon Sushi. If you see a dark long narrow hallway with walls covered in Vinyl records, you've discovered the Secret Pizza!  This menu is as simple as it gets. New York style pizza by the slice or pie.   Regular cheese slice $5.00 White slice $5.50  Additional toppings  $.50 each Sicilian $8.00 Regular cheese pie $26.00  White pie $28.00 Additional toppings $3.00  We each ordered a slice of pizza topped with pepperoni, sausage and mushroom. Thinly sliced, crispy crusted, extra greasy melt in your mouth pizzagasm! It's a pizza lovers dream come True. If your not a fan of pizza like myself, you'll definitely be one by the time you leave.  The secrets out! Secret pizza has discovered the secret how to make the best pizza. Hands down one of the best pizzas!",

I can't even get a slice that good for that little at home, nevermind anywhere in Las Vegas on The Strip!   3rd floor.. that's all I'm saying. Follow your nose!",

    "text": "4 stars only for the pizza....  First lets talk about the pizza. I had heard of this place from yelp and it was on my list of spots I had to try. Well there where 10 of us in our party and we decided pizza and beer would do for dinner. We made a trip down and found the pizza place. Everyone is right, it is down an unmarked hall to a little counter with an oven and pies sitting out if you buy a slice. Small menu board, but they do have PBR on tap ($5 for a red cup) We ordered 3 pizzas with a variety of toppings. OMG this was damn good pizza. The slices where massive, but with a very thin crust and a very thin but crunchy outside crust. All very good and we only ended up with 4 left over slices.  Price, I do not agree with the other reviews about value. Each pie for us was $23-24. While these are large pies they still seemed expensive. I know this is vegas and I know it is going to be more expensive, but this just seemed over the top for me.  There is virtually no room to sit and eat, a couple of chairs, a little bar, and another little bar to stand and eat. If you have more then a couple of people be prepared to stand and eat.  Now on to the service. This gets a 2 star. We walked in and reviewed the very simple menu. We wanted to ask a couple questions about toppings because nothing was listed on the board. The girl helping us was not helpful at all. She just kinda spewed out some \"answers\". Not sure if she was having a bad day, or if she does not really give a shit.... i lean towards not giving a shit. The manager offered to bring them up to the room for us as soon as they where done, we where told 30-40 min.  After over an hour and still no pizza we made a call. After getting handed off to 2 people we still had no answer and no pizza. At almost the same time the manager showed up at our room, brought the pizzas in and gave us a hand getting the pizzas out. He even brought up a stack of napkins and plates. What kinda annoyed me was he then asked for a tip for bringing them up. He never said sorry for being late or anything else. If he had of called to say hey we got busy it will be a bit longer then I would of gladly handed him a tip.  Overall I would 100% go get a slice and a PBR, but really don't expect much as far as service.",

I would have never known about this place if it hadn't been for the nice concierge on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan while my mom and I were wandering around. He walked us over to this huge door and swung it open to reveal a hallway with a pinball game and loud rock music.   The set-up is similar to a NY pizzeria in that there are no tables, just bars where you can stand and eat or grab an empty stool. I ordered a cheese slice for $3.50 which is unheard of in Vegas. The slice was really good! We went back there a couple of times during our visit when we didn't want to spend an arm and a leg for a meal.",

It was fun trying to find the \"restaurant\" (not that hard, actually -- if you're coming from the pedestrian walkway, just take the escalator to the third floor and walk to the little hallway in front of you).  The pizza itself is $5 a slice, but one slice was sufficient for me. There is seating down the hallway from the pizza shop. I was there on a Wed for lunch, so there was no line. All in all a good, casual lunch.  By the way, I snagged a cannoli to try it out, and they definitely add some kind of orange flavor to it. I'm more of a traditionalist when it comes to my cannoli, apparently, so I wasn't over the moon, but It did have nice texture!",

The pizza is frickin' awesome.  The crust is thin and perfect.   And for the price, including a drink, it's an amazing value for a quick bite, or for some late night gnoshing after some drinking.  Don't think that you'll be able to go and gather around a table.  It's not a pizza parlour.  Stools.  Counter tops.  Pizza.  Beer.  Awesome.",

Nice crust that is crisp on the outside.  Has a slightly tangy taste like sourdough.  Just means they let the dough rise slowly and didn't rush it like so many places do. Cheese was nice as was the sauce.  But the main attraction for me was the pepperoni.  Nice and spicy.  And the guy put a lot on there.  Really hits the spot and a much better value than a taco for $4 or a chinese bao for the same.",

My girlfriends had never been in here before so I took them to the secret location and they were already in a trance by all the vintage album covers lining the wall. Once inside we discover we are the only girls so that always helps.   The guys working behind the counter were down to earth and super sweet. I ordered the slice of white pizza and they put a cold tomato on it once it comes out of the oven. The pizza guy was real cool so I think the slice was around $3 and I tipped him $7. As I am approaching cougar age I find I tip younger guys more.....First sign of a cougar, maybe? Shhh. Let's not talk about it.   Back to the pie. Hot damn that was good. I could have pounded down four more slices easily. The garlic, the cheese and the contrast of the cold tomato worked wonders in my mouth. I also tried a bite of the cheese slice with red sauce. Also dynamite.   I'm hooked on this place. I have spent big bucks on a couple of  Cosmo's fine dining restaurants and I have to say the best meal I have had came from the secret pizza place.... I will be back. Oh yes, I will be back.",

We arrived in Vegas around midnight and started getting ready to go meet some friends that were over at Marquee.  Unfortunately they ended up leaving after we were all ready to head out, but they ended up bringing back this huge pizza for both of our suites.  We had the combination pizza and normally I will pick off green peppers and mushrooms, but I gobbled that whole thing up with no hesitations.  Most pizza places will get stingy about toppings too, but they lather that baby up just the right amount.    I wouldn't mind eating this pizza every day if I lived in Vegas.",

I have read that lines can be very long here however we must have gotten lucky when we came because there was only about four people in the entire restaurant. They have very interesting decor inside and on the walls.   When you approach the counter you can see their menu board. However they can also custom make certain pizzas for you. The pizza slices are all moderately priced and the selection is very big. When you choose what kind you want they warm it up in the oven for you. Now I dont know if this oven is magical or the ingredients are super fresh, but the pizza was one of the most delicious tasting slices I have EVER eaten.   I highly recommend checking this place out and I will be sure to always stop by during my Vegas adventures.",

They throw the slice in the oven and while you pay - it's ready. It's served on a paper plate. I got a slice of pepperoni and a slice of the white pizza. The pepperoni was good but the white pizza was amazing.   You can order pizzas by the entire pie if you order ahead - or wait in the line and then wait for the pizza. There are only 3-5 seats at a counter but there's several lounge areas in the hotel near the restaurant.   This place is definitely worth a visit.

I am pretty sure that is why I didn't enjoy it.",

A few months later, I ran across Yelp reviews on Secret Pizza and threw it in his face-I wasn't dreaming it up! So the next visit to the Cosmopolitan, I had to find the pizza. I asked an employee and he looked around, replied in a whisper to tell us how to get there.  It really was a secret. How would anyone know to go down an unmarked hallway? The hallway is pretty sweet-it's lined with pictures of old album covers. The actual pizza joint is pretty small with only a few barstools and counter space but it works because really, how long does it take to eat a slice or two before you're off to gamble again?   The customer service was great, prices are reasonable and they even have Galaga to play. If you don't know what Galaga is, you probably weren't born during the time it was popular. Anyway, the pizza itself was good but nothing to write home about. The crust is thin but I think what's great about it is that it's not greasy and it's quick and simple so that you can be on your way and get back to gambling, partying and all of the other sinful things you do in Las Vegas.",

It's been a year, my apologies for the late review, but while in Vegas this past weekend I was reminded of this place and realized I'd forgotten to give my two-cents on Yelp. Our excuse for going on the Secret Pizza quest was not a late night or too much alcohol, it was simply the challenge of finding what some call \"the best pizza in Vegas\" and it sure felt great to find the place! The aroma of the pizza filled our room and not only tasted great fresh, but just as delicious the next morning :) - when in Vegas. Even if you're not staying at the Cosmo, I dare you to follow your senses and find this place on your next trip!",

The pizza is somewhat expensive per slice and is pretty basic - thin crust and pretty normal toppings.

People usually just eat their pizza and leave, they may play the arcade games but if not there is some space to eat your pizza.   Service: Their staff is friendly, they have one person taking orders, one person who works at the register and a few making the pizza. Because It is in such a small space, the demand on pizza seems high.   Price: It costs $5 for a slice of cheese pizza and each additional topping is $.50. I personally think It is pretty expensive but for a hotel, It is the average price of what you'd expect to pay.   Food:  I got 2 slices of pepperoni pizza and 1 slice of sausage pizza. I personally think that It was really greasy and I felt really sick after eating the pizza. It may be because I don't typically eat food this greasy but It was delicious while I ate It.   Notes: It is hidden in an alley way so if you ride the elevator up, It is on the third floor to the right.",

I am a fan of the whole concept of this place, even if it is probably contrived by the Cosmos to contrast with the other more sophisticated places around.   If you are debating whether to get a slice or a whole pizza, definitely get the whole. It's 10 pieces for around $26 or ~$5 for a slice.  The white pizza is good if you like ricotta cheese. Otherwise the standard pizza with your choice of toppings is very satisfying. Get meatballs on your pizza no matter what.

We learned of this place and were so excited since it sounded perfect.    I was so disappointed. Mostly with the service- totally unfriendly, you couldn't even see/tell what kind of pizzas they had available at the time (for instance, it looked like they didn't have any cheese so my friend didn't end up ordering that. then someone did order it and it turned out it was below the counter?). The pizza was very meh- okay but nothing special. When I asked for a to-go container to take my second piece back with me, they handed me a paper bag? Which was kind of bizarre. And I know some people on here have said it's not overpriced for Vegas, but if I buy overpriced pizza it better be great pizza. And this was not. It's too bad because I really do love the idea of a pizza place like this being hidden away in the Cosmo. But it's not worth it.    (Note, I think of places like Antonio's in Amherst, MA where you grab a drunken slice after the bars and OMG the superiority of that pizza compared to this).",

Meaning a long line to get in the later it is in the night. I waltzed in at 11:30, didn't wait, and I'm having two amazing pieces of pizza.  I'm sure they're all good but I can't imagine getting anything but the sausage and pepperoncini or the pepperoni. #%*} amazing.",

Every time I am there, I always stop by to grab a pizza!  It is inexpensive, good decent size of slice and the best part, there White cheese pizza.    Here is the only questions is I am not sure if you now have to order an entire pie for the white cheese pizza or if it was just because this last time we went (MDW) they were requiring you to order a pie, but you know what I will anyways.  What's also great is you can add additional topping to your white cheese pizza...last time I had a slice I added pepperoni, green bellpepper and onions.  OMG it was delish!  A MUST visit place whenever you go to Cosmo!!!",

I had the white pizza which was excellent and I'm not usually a white pizza girl. I couldn't resist the large mounds of ricotta dotting the slice. My husband had the white and a sausage slice which was also good.   Great for a quick bite.",

    "text": "Monday, October 3, 2011Secret Pizzeria at Cosmopolitan, Las Vegas   I will start this review with the following disclosure: The following Pizzeria does not exist. It has no menu, it has no website, it has no signs advertising a family meal deal. It is also not down a long hallway lined with old music album covers on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. It is not one of the best deals on the strip. It is also not the Best Pizza on the Strip. I HAVE KEPT THE SECRET.  Now onto the food review... for the best pizza and best pizza deals in Vegas you need to find the secret Pizzeria at Cosmo. The cost is almost two dollars less per slice then any other pizza joint on the strip ( including my other favorite at the Wynn) and the super thin crust , fresh taste and general New York ambiance just can't be beat. Although thin , the crust is still sturdy enough to bend without breaking and strong enough to hold any toppings. Speaking of toppings... unless you order ahead of time ( is there an actual number to the place?) then you will be having your pizza topped with whatever the chefs whim is. There is no formal menu.  On this day Simone and I had our choice of 5 different pizza pies. We both choose for our first slice portabello mushroom pizza with red sauce. With meaty fresh thin sliced mushroms, sweet fresh tasting marinara creamy mozzarella cheese and a crispy blistered crust this one was a winner. Savory till the last bite it leaves you wanting more... so I obliged. This time when I went back to the counter looking me in the face was a white pizza with fresh roasted garlic, Ricotta Cheese and Olive Oil. This one may have been better then the mushroom. The crust was sauce less and had even more crunch. The garlic was sweet, the Ricotta Creamy and slightly melted and the Olive Oil was the icing on my pizza experience.   The Pizzeria does not seem to offer any sides and I didn't ask because none were needed. They do have fountain drinks and beer. Parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes can be found at the stand up bar that you can eat on. Without any other choices, The pizza definitely stands alone (although three days later we went back and tried a cannolli for dessert and that was delicious as well). New York thin crust pizza is what its all about here at The Cosmopolitan, and these guys are the best at it.",

The pizza if you order by the slice ($5 each) is reheated in the oven.   So NOT fresh and good.    We also got a whole pie that was a bit better because it was made fresh but it still wasn't great.  I personally like the pizza place in NYNY better.  This pizza actually tasted better the next day, cold.  Not much of a secret anymore.  It's on the third floor. Look for a big wooden door but it was kept open when we went because the line was so long and took forever.",

They use great quality cheese and tomato sauce and you can get whatever toppings you'd like.  Order by the slice to expedite the order.  Not cheap, but then nothing is in Las Vegas.  Oh yes, blot out a little oil on top with a napkin, the best tasting pizza somehow always have a little more oil on the surface than my stomach can handle.

But it can be hard to find after the club if you're not too familiar with its location beforehand. THIRD FLOOR OF THE COSMO.  Bf and I circled the 2nd floor a few times before I went back on Yelp to figure it out where it was. Once we found out it was on the third floor, it was easy to find with the seating area full of used plates and napkins and a loud group of drunk people waiting in line at 4AM (the photos on Yelp should help you figure out which hallway it is). The line was pretty long, but good company always makes it bearable.  White pizza is definitely where it's at. Getting a whole pizza with a larger group is definitely better.   There isn't much room inside to sit and eat comfortably, but the seating area right outside the hall isn't too bad.   During the daytime, there wasn't much of a line and wasn't as chaotic. Had it sober and it was still a delicious pizza. At $5 a slice, it's probably the reasonably, deliciously priced item in Vegas.   Secret Pizza is a MUST-TRY when you're in Vegas and especially after the club.",

    "text": "First time experience and it was ~meh for me...   I got to try their white & meat pizza slices... Pizza itself was pretty good but nothing extraordinary or amazing... Just good slice of pizza if you are hungry.   There were a few factors that made my first time experience at Secret Pizza whatevers... 1) Hard to find! I know I know it's in the name... But when you are hungry and tired at 12am you just want to find the damn place for some food... Eventually figured out where it was after asking hotel staffs and asking random people where they got their piece of pizza.  2) Long line! We waited 1.5hrs in line to get 1-2 slices of pizza. Um... the pizza was not worth that wait... esp at 12am when you're hungry. By the time we got our food and started eating it was 1:30am!!!  3) Price! It's around $5/slice of pizza... Just decent pizza... Not worth it! We can get a whole pan of pizza at Costco for ~$10...  My first time experience was definitely ~meh and I've experienced better... But I'm willing to try it again to give it a fair shot...",

Okay, first off...... i don't think this place is THAT hidden. keep it simple. walk into Cosmopolitan, go up the escalator that is in front of the juicery and Milk, then walk straight ahead into a small 'hipster' looking hall way, then tada. unfomtunately, my friend and i literally walked alllllll the way around then realized we made an entire circle. i mean. cardio for the pizza, right. got the classic white pizza and took it to go, made it back to our room at the aria, maybe 15 min later? and it was still decently warm. i haven't had a pizza in almost 2 years, so judge me if you want. But it was reallllyyyy good.",

    "text": "One of the better places or maybe even the best pizza place in Las Vegas. But that really depends on what type of pizza you like. What makes me love Secret Pizza is their cheese.   I'm just going to keep this real short.  Secret Pizza isn't much of a secret. You'll notice where it is as soon as you see people eating pizza while in the sitting areas. It's an awesome place for food when you're drunk or right after you get out of the club. Or any time, really. I usually go at night.  Their cheese pizza is best. Stringy, gooey cheese.   Their pepperoni is really salty and covers the taste of their cheese. Good if you like pepperoni. Not good if you want to just taste the cheesey goodness.   If you're with friends, get a whole pie. Split it. Much more cost efficient and you get more pizza that way.  One slice is around $5-6. One pie is about $28-30. That is assuming you're just getting a cheese pie or pepperoni. The more toppings you get, the more expensive. Price is average to be honest, especially compared to places like Grimaldis.   If you haven't tried it, try it. Always start off with a slice of cheese pizza.",

    "text": "There is a reason why people all over the US open New York style pizzerias. There's few things more delicious than some cheese, tomato sauce and bread put together. And secret pizza combines all of these items traditionally and beautifully. New York style Pizza should mix fresh ingredients, a nice crunchy and doughy crust with tasty cheese, and this spot is definitely the best New York style I've had west of the Mississippi. If I close my eyes, I'm transported to a more innocent time, of accents, train rides and being back home. This pizza is worth the trip to vegas even if it's super expensive for a slice.  Oh by the way, it's located on the third floor of the cosmo near the shops and restaurants side, not the convention side. If you see a Japanese restaurant there should be a half right next to it with records lining the walls!",

    "text": "Secret Pizza may at one point have actually been a secret, but it's definitely a sought after spot when you're at the Cosmopolitan. They don't have it marked on any of their directories, and the front desk staff will remind you where it is with a hand drawn circle in an empty space on the property map.  We arrived around midnight and it wasn't too crowded. I was more in awe of all the old records on display down the main hallway you walk down to get to the small pizza parlor. If that wasn't cool enough, they had some retro pinball games waiting for you, too. I had total ADD and couldn't focus on the pizza and I was too busy scoping out the room. It's not like I really had to pay attention to what I was ordering - I knew i was going to get pizza, and I was okay with making a last minute decision and pointing at the one that looked the most appetizing.  With that being said, I went with pepperoni and sausage and they warm the slices up to you while you're waiting to pay. Once you've finished your transaction, you're given a hearty slice of pie served piping hot. We took ours back up to our room as seating is pretty non-existent, and if you do find a spot, it's probably going to be standing room only.  We must've made it right in time, because minutes after arriving, there was a huge line down the corridor we had just entered, and it was wrapping through communal restaurant spaces pretty quickly. Again... not so secret, especially since it was a Wednesday night!  We enjoyed our late night snack. Slices range from $5-$7 depending on what you want on it. Just note, if you're buying multiple of the same slice, it's way cheaper to just buy a whole pizza! Someone was doing the math while in line, but it also takes a while longer, so you gotta weigh out those pros and cons.  Staff was really nice and they had a good system of getting people in and out pretty fast. I'll be back when in Vegas!",

After placing our order and noticing all the other groups behind us they where leaving we were asking the group in line, how did they leave first. They responded they slipped an extra 20 to get our pizza. Then when asking the crew what's going on we were met with defensive an unprofessional behavior.  We requested a manager and when I asked how did the other 10 people after us leave before us, she had no response but claimed they may have ordered sliced, however the people leaving with slices leave with paper plates not boxes. The people behind us left with a box.  After asking the manager to explain, she had nothing to say for it. I said just give me my pizza and I'll be gone. Cosmo, please fix the attitude of your workers and making sure no favoritism to extra money, cause it ruined our night. Shyler was the cashier, Michelle was the manager on duty. BUT  the girl who was defensive decided to take her name tag off, so me being a manager from another corporation, that shouldn't happen if she believes she was telling the truth. So please fix   UPDATE: contacted Comsopolitan still waiting for a response it's been weeks....",

I'd read heaps of articles about this place saying how sneakily hidden it was, how difficult it was to find, how only those \"in the know\" knew the location. Total BS. Aside from that, this place serves kick ass pizza for a reasonable price... which is why I had to stand in line for 45 minutes at 4.30am on Friday evening/Saturday morning waiting for my chance to try it out.  I ended up being super boring and predictable and got one slice of their cheese, sausage pepperoni pizza. I didn't bother coming up with my own combo, I didn't bother mixing and matching- my feet were aching and I was so ready to be done with my evening. Really liked the pizza, it was tasty and not crazy greasy. 10/10 would wait in line for a slice again!",

You also got to see the staff prepare your pizza, which is always neat.  The pizza itself was excellent! I've had some pretty good pizza before, so it's hard to say if it tops the charts for me, but it's definitely in my top three pizza places. My party got a white pie with two toppings (mushrooms and pepperoni) and it was loved by us all! The mozzarella was the highlight of the pizza, and received the most compliments from us all.

    "text": "My friends and I hit up Secret Pizza on our last trip to Vegas, and it surely didn't disappoint! We had heard so much about it from friends, and on our last night out we stopped by around 2 am for a slice. The line wasn't real long when we got there, but it was out past the hallway by the time we left! The whole experience is pretty awesome. You can't smell the pizza outside of the hallway, and there is no sign, so it feels like you've made a quirky little discovery when you pop in. I am a pizza purist, so I stuck with a regular pepperoni. It wasn't the best pizza I've had, but it was pretty great! Not too much cheese or sauce, and it was so hot and fresh. We waited a couple minutes for a fresh pizza because they had just run out of the pepperoni, and it was so worth it. I definitely recommend Secret Pizza to anyone, whether you're looking for a bite after walking the strip, or you've got the munchies after a few hours of partying. It's cheap, fast, and delish!",

Prices are EXCELLENT for a large slice of heaven. Great pizzas by the slice, the perfect food after partying it up late night Las Vegas style. Careful, there can be a big line depending on what time you go. Check out the album art on the walls. Very cool. This will be my late night food stop whenever I am staying at the Cosmopolitan.",

The \"Speakeasy\" style of the joint (accessed through an unmarked hallway next to Blue Ribbon) adds a bit to the experience, but the pizza....I went back twice during a three day trip.  A couple of slices will cure any hangover, munchie attack, or longing for NY.  Hanging out in the restaurant could prove to be a bit cramped, so unless you are open to eating standing up look for other options.  We took our slices out to the game area of the Cosmo which provided great people watching, access to scrabble, pool table, and comfortable lounging.  Definately check this place out!",

I had to wait about 30 min for the line, and I ordered a full pie and normally it takes 25 min but they messed up a few times and ended up waiting 45 min. I was extremely hungry but it's understandable that sometimes people make mistakes. The worker did give us a free 2 liter bottle for making us wait extra.   I got the normal Cheese pizza, size of this thing is HUGE. It was 25 bucks even split between 6 people which was less than 5 bucks a person! Definitely a good price for something in Vegas  I woke up wanting more of this deliciousness. will most definitely come back again and try calling in my order next time. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

I prefer the straight cheese pizza, but their specialty is the \"white\" pizza, which is also very good.  takes about 20 minutes to get a pizza, or you can opt for a slice or two.  If it's after the clubs start closing down, who knows how long you'll be waiting.    It's on the 3rd floor in a small hallway to the left of Jalio (or however its spelled).  Small place, basically stand and eat.  They do have Hipster brew on tap though.  Reasonable prices and great flavor.    Also, the Cosmopolitan in general is probably the swankest place in Vegas right now.  I really dig it and it's a fun place to hang out.",

At any rate, the line may seem long but it moves pretty fast. I wouldn't say it's exactly like NYC pizza but it comes pretty close.  We tried a slice of the pepperoni and the white pizza.  After a few bites of the white pizza the ricotta and mozzarella became cheese overload for me.  Definitely go with the pepperoni as a no fail choice.

I was pretty tipsy and all I remember was going through different sets of elevators and escalators, past swanky lobbies and convention rooms, and suddenly I was walking down a hallway of vinyl records filled with other drunken people.  You'll smell the place before you see it...IF you see it!  Was led to Secret Pizza by Mr. Dubs for some late-night munchies to soak up the booze that wouldn't leave my system.  I had a hankering and Pizza was calling my name.  Heeding Siren's call, this place was suggested to me after Mr. Dubs' own drunken adventures with his crew.  We ordered four slices and took it back to our room.  Eating pizza on the balcony of your Cosmopolitan suite is pretty amazingly epic when it's 4 in the morning.  Am I Chrissy Teigen?  Maybe it was the alcohol but sinking my teeth for that first bite of cheesy meaty goodness was amazing.  New York style thin crust, some cheese drag action, and a generous helping of toppings.  I'm in Heaven.  It's not the best pizza ever or even the best slice on the Strip but it's pretty darn good and nicely priced!  At $5+ a slice, it was great.  The slices are gigantic and I only ate one slice out of the two that I ordered.  Passing out in a food and booze coma afterward resulted in the best sleep ever.  Hurray for Secret Pizza!",

Looked for signage while in Cosmo or a sign outside the place and found nothing.  Sneaky!  But luckily, the place isn't hard to find because once you get on the third floor, you see a bunch of folks munching on their pizza.  Came a little bit after midnight on Christmas and luckily it wasn't packed.  Waited about 10 minutes and was able to order a slice of pizza.  Ordered a slice of the white pizza.  At first, the server (or do you call the guys pizza slice giver...he doesn't actually serve you...) looked and they were out of it and said we had to wait 15 minutes but luckily, the pizza maker told him that they had one ready in the back of the oven.  Winner winner pizza 4th meal dinner!  Fresh pizza right out of the oven.  For around $6, you get the ricotta with garlic and mozzarella.  Looked for a place to eat inside on the counters but it wasn't particularly clean so we decided to just take it outside.  Split this with my sister and we both thought it was OK.  I can see how this can be AHHHHMAZING if you were drunk (Almost everything is).  I didn't drink so it was just OK.  The dollops of ricotta were the best part of the pizza.  Very creamy when biting into those places where it had ricotta.  The pizza was hot and the cheese was melty but I couldn't get over how salty it was.  I felt the burst of salt pellets with every bite.  No bueno (again... probably great after a night at Marquee or any other club in town)  A good place to come and say you have tried.  With all the other places throughout Vegas (and after a night of clubbing), this place wouldn't be on my list.  The place has its gimmick but the pizza is just decent and the place needs to be kept up a bit better.  Counters need to be tended more often, Napkin holders need to be refilled...",

The white pizza is my go to and second would have to be meatball. They have a limited selection sometimes based on what is available so I tend to get different ones every time! They are open till the AM so come on by and get a slice of delicious pizza!",

    "text": "I haven't had pizza in the longest time ever because my diet's pretty low carb, but in vegas it completely went out the window! Anybody that personally knows me, knows that I'm one indecisive girl when it comes to food cause I wanna eat/sample everything. We were staying at Aria and they have Five/50 pizza bar there which I wanted to try, but I also wanted Secret pizza. Luckily, my bf was sweet enough to run to both places to buy slices and bring it back to the room at Aria for us :)  Normally the line is crazy packed out the door, but luckily my bf didn't have to wait long. We ended up getting the white pizza w/ sausage and mushrooms. I was surprised the pizza was still nice and warm when he got back to the room. I was a bit scared at first because all the reviews kept saying it's super oily, but this definitely was NOT the case for us! Compared to Five/50 pizza in Aria, Secret Pizza was way better!!  I've had really good pizza in NY and the pizza here was a NY style big slice (big, foldable, and not too much sauce). It held up the toppings and everything nicely. The crust had the perfect crunch and texture. They were also generous w/ the toppings here especially the sausage. I mean you can see the whole sausage link on my pizza. I really liked the cheese on here too, it didn't have the stinky cheese smell. The roasted garlic spread smothered on the white pizza was sooo robust and good!! The white pizza consisted of various cheeses as well, the ricotta stood out and tasted fresh.  FYI: We came here once after clubbing and got lost trying to find it. No wonder it's called secret pizza lol.  -It's located at the very top floor of cosmo (3rd) where all the fancy restaurants are. Look for a hallway w/ vinyl CD records and you'll find the hidden gem! -It's more of a go in & grab a quick slice place, there aren't chairs for you to sit",

And it takes FOREVER. It can sometimes be close to an hour wait. The slices are expensive but definitely tastes delicious.   But here's why their service is not good... A stranger walked up to us and offered to buy us our pizza when we were near ordering towards the front of the line. We didn't think anything of it at the time until the cashier lady scolded us for letting him buy us pizza. He cut the line, bought us our pizza and some slices for himself and then left. I'm just wondering why WE were the ones who got in trouble instead of the man that cut the line. If they really did not condone people cutting in line, then they shouldn't have served the guy. She should have told him to get to the back of the line or tell him to leave. But no. She sells him his pizza and doesn't say a freakin* word to him. Then turns to US and tells us that she'll kick us out next time if we let someone cut the line...  I get it, we shouldn't have let him buy us our pizza, but it was our first time there. I'm sure she sees that kind of stuff all the time so why didn't the employees of Secret Pizza protect their customers? Why did they allow someone to cut the line and take advantage of another customers gullibility? Yea, I fell for it and I've learned my lesson, but seriously, why scold us for the other guys actions. I'll come back here again, I just feel used and picked on when we were the victims here.",

After a long night of drunken activities at Marquee, come here to sober yourself up a bit.   They have already made pizzas you can choose from or you Can order a whole pizza. I don't think there's any choice in the size of the pizza. There's just one size and that's LARGE. I ordered a whole pizza and that thing was freaking huge but it was bomb dot com.  It's got just the right amount of sauce, toppings, and cheese. It all just goes well together and I'm speaking about all the different toppings.   The staff is very nice as well. It's very small place so you can just order your pizza or slice and if there's no room to eat it in the actual restaurant you can just walk out and there's a bunch of couches right outside you can hang out in. The actual pizza place probably has about 5 stools where you can sit in.",

You also don't go here for beverages- there selection is limited. You go here for the pizza and that's it. It took about 4 minutes to get our slices. Well worth the trip down to the Cosmopolitan for this pizza!!",

Because heck I wasn't so sure where the location was to this place aside being in the Cosmopolitan hotel. I almost gave up on finding it. Then clever idea hit, read the reviews dork.   I was still skeptical too after I read it since there was no sign for this place. Luckily, I found it. Great yummy pizza. Good thin crust pizza and delicious bread with a hint of a garlic taste to it. Not bad, but a bit pricey for a slice $4.50 plus additional 50cents for an extra topping that is kinda cutting it right there.   Anyway will return one day again when I have more money to spend or maybe just get a whole pizza.   Just remember 3rd floor lol.",

Once the delivery guy got to the counter to order for us they said it would be a 45 minute wait.  Fine, most pizzas take about that long when you order them for delivery - no problem.  However, for some reason, it took 2 hours from the order being made to the handoff from Secret Pizza to the delivery guy. When I opened the box, it was thin, greasy and ice cold. If the pizza had really taken 45 minutes (or whatever) to make, why was it not at least a little fresh or lukewarm and why did it take so long for Secret Pizza to give it to the delivery guy who sat there the whole time waiting? Clearly someone had forgotten about it. But that's just the delivery experience.   The pizza itself, even if it had been hot and fresh, was nothing special. Certainly not worth the $30-odd. The only way this pizza would have been good is if I were drunk and hungry and happened to be passing by.",

You see all these record covers on the wall leading into the place. So you get there and there are funny men behind the counter making pies and joking. It just puts you Ina relaxed mood and gets you ready for a slice. I am a pizza purest at hurt. Meaning I judge a pizza place by a simple cheese slice. If that is executed well it's a good sign of what's to come. So I ordered cheese and pepperoni.  Did I need two slices? NOPE... I am miss piggy so I had to get them. The cheese pizza was right up my alley. The thin crust with a decent amount of cheese and sauce ratio. You take your slice and sit on one of three few stools they have or you stand. Still you don't mind because that big slice of pizza is smiling at you. You have to smile back. Another spot that will be a Vegas staple to visit.",

    "text": "Secret pizza is the place to go for moderately priced pizza in Vegas. Its kind of hidden (hence the name). It is on the same floor as the pool table at the cosmopolitan. My personal favorite is the white pizza with sausage. Its a thin crust pizza with the perfect cheesy flavor the sausage are legit sausage slices and not the kind from dominos. The normal red pizza is also really good too and typically they have more options for it available.   It tastes extra good after you're done doing your business at marquee and have those drunchies. But the line is pretty long because everyone from the club goes there after. So if youre not going out at night I would recommend eating before 2:00 am because you will be stuck in a line full of less than sober people.   The pizza makes it all worth it though.",

    "text": "3 1/2 stars to be honest.   Not too shabby, Abby!  Ended up going here after the Yelp event at Chino Poblano a few weeks ago.  Even though Jose Andres and his crew did fill me up with the great goodies and libations, the lady and I were curious about how good this 'hidden' pizzeria at The Cosmopolitan was.  After gambling off the buzz we had (boy does losing money sober you up quick), we were off to the 3rd floor.  Folks were right on the money, you'll see the hidden hallway going to the pizzeria right near the pool table.  One massive line later (damn was it busy with people dressed in sequins for some reason) we were finally at the front.    I had no clue what to order since most of the slices looked pretty good.  I went with what a lot of yelpers said was tasty, the cheese slice with ricotta.  Must be pretty good because when I went to order it, the cook took out a hidden pie from below from what was already out on the counter!  Kinda like a secret menu item, eh?  Back it went into the oven for a quick reheat.  I'm not big on the reheating of a pie but I guess there ain't much choice here because the line seems constantly busy.  The price?  $11 for 2 slices, kinda ehhhh for me on that front (I guess I'm a cheapie.  Sue me.)  because at a place like Broadway Pizzeria you can get an entire large pie for nearly the same price.  And yes, the pizza at Broadway is a good NY style thin crust!  The 2 slices of cheese and ricotta we had at The Cosmopolitan?  Luckily, they were pretty good!  Good flavor and a crunchy crust pleased me pretty well.  I liked my slice even better with red pepper, oregano, and garlic on top.  However the slices seemed a bit smaller than what I've recently seen on the reviews here.  Economic crunch perhaps?  Price and portion made me had to knock off a few points here.  It really left me wanting a bigger slice.  Although considering this is the Strip it's not too expensive for a meal.  The pizza pie is good, but I think it's cheaper if you and a few folks go in and just order an entire pie around the $20 range with toppings.  Save some dough, and then eat it!  Service was fast and friendly, but pay attention to the prices!  Good thing for Yelp, I avoided the overpriced drink in a small red cup!  Seriously, almost $4 for a soda in a regular red party cup with no lid?  I'd rather buy an extra slice of pizza and live with the minor halitosis from the extra shake of garlic I'd be putting on!  Ha Ha, does the pizzeria know folks get a Heineken from the casino downstairs for just $1 tip?  Ooooh, good idea!  I think I'll do that next time!  Pizza and beer.....winning!",

Too bad it's really not a secret anymore. :(  Anyways, secret pizza probably has saved me more than I realized. Especially on a drinking night, you gotta get that pizza fuel to get you through the night. What better way to end your night of drinking, dancing, clubbing but with some hot fresh pizza?!  It's a better deal to just get a whole pizza. A 5 topping whole pizza come out to be around $35. For Cosmo standards, I think that's freaking worth it. Even if it's just for two people, just order a whole pizza, eat your couple of slices, then take the rest up to your room. And voila, you have breakfast the next day. The greatest thing about the Cosmo rooms is that they have microwaves inside the kitchen area so you can nuke your pizza the next morning for some hot breakfast or be like me and eat it cold.   Also, if you get lazy and you're staying in the Cosmo rooms, they also deliver. How awesome is that?   Anyways, their pizzas are actually pretty tasty so it's a win win for all!",

After the long trek from the Bellgio to the Cosmopolitan, we saw the crowd but got in line nonetheless. After waiting for more than 20 minutes we decided that in order to make the most of it we should order a whole pie. Well some other people had the same idea and they had been waiting for 45 minutes.

Cheese Board in Berkeley is definitely better, but that's quite a distance from this place when the 3am drunchies hit. If you order a whole pizza, I would recommend getting half marinara and half white sauce, just so that you can have the best of both worlds.

So basically every night after drinking, a group of us would bring back a few boxes for everyone to share.  The white pizza was my favorite.  They have legit toppings, especially the sausage.  GREAT LATE NIGHT DRUNK FOOD!",

Blame it on the A-A-A-Alcohol! No, but the Fat Tuesday probably had something to do with it. My brother and I got here eventually. It's a tiny hallway in between two bigger restaurant (can't remember the names). The hallway is filled with pictures frames of old school favorites like Frank Sinatra and J. Travolta. Don't forget to capture a few photos in this Hallway of Fame.   Pizza pizza pizza! Lightly crisped with a constant chewy texture after. Get the white cheese! That's all I can say. Didn't realize how fast I ate that slice. I love me a good slice of pizza, and now I have a pizzeria to go to in Vegas if I'm ever having a pizza craving.",

It could be good if you're drunk and hungry, but as for pizza goes, it's pretty disappointing.  Thin oily crust and coagulated cheese, uneven slices.  One piece I had was about 50% larger than another, but cost the same price. 3.  The place is a mess.  Garbage is laying all over the place, with grease covered condiment shakers and empty napkin holders and virtually nowhere to sit because they have about 4 barstools up against the wall. 4.  Very limited drink selection.  Soda, wine, or choice of 3 beers.  If you want some real good pizza, don't go here.  If you just want some drunk filler food in a place that attracts the young (20-some) crowd, you may like it.",

Called to ask if they had  white pizza and how long it would be to order a whole pie .. Joe answered was super nice and helpful .. told me to head there in twenty min or 35 for a whole pizza .. was worried about time since there was some traffic so opted for four slices.. got there in ten .. I luckily the pizza hadn't come out of the oven yet b.c there was quite a line .. paid for four slices $20 .. waited ten min .. inhaled a slice and they packaged three for me to go ... with transportation these four slices costed me $15 a piece .. but I still love this pizza and so worth it .. and I don't even like pizza   Tried to find white pizza in Seattle .. pfft .. Costco pizza is their best pizza -.-",

It's near many of the other restaurant but there's NO signage ANYWHERE for this place.  Hence  the secret I guess.    We went to check it out when we first arrived to possibly get a quick lunch but it doesn't have places to sit and eat so we decided to try it later.  Bad move!   While there during the day, there was  no line, but things changed at 3 in the morning.  There was a serious line.  But what are you to do when it's the only place open and you need some grease?  Line moved fairly quickly and we got the slices we were eyeing earlier.  We tried the white pizza and pepperoni with peppers.   Pizza was bomb!  Loved that it's all thin crust.  Had some good flavors going on.  The white pizza with ricotta/garlic was my favorite!    Highly recommend if you're in the area.",

Appearance:  Sadly (or maybe fortunately?), I was unable to experience the long line and see the place myself. My group went to the Marquee club before and we promised each other that we had to eat here afterwards. Two of my friends actually left the club early. By the time I left the club 40 minutes later to my hotel, I actually ran into her on the strip! It was such a weird experience since I left so much later than her! She told me she was waiting in line for the pizza the entire time, and the line was LONG. I guess the lesson learn is that this place gets hella crowded so expect a long wait. And maybe get a friend to get the pizza for you?? Just kidding. I really wish I was able to see the place.   Food: SO EFFING GOOD. I tried the sausage and pepperoni pizza. At first, I was thinking that the pizza didn't look anything special. It just had sausage....and pepperoni...what's so great about it? But when I took a bite...idk if it was because I was slightly tipsy, tired, and hungry,  but whatever the case, this pizza hit the spot! The pizza had loads of sausage and pepperoni in every bite, and you are able to taste the cheese and the sauce. You know it's a good pizza if you can taste e very component! Even the crust was good!   Overall, it was bomb. This was my first time in Vegas, and I was very lucky to try one of the famous foods of Vegas. I recommend going here if you love  pizza!!",

I got a slice of white pizza and even though it was good (albeit being on the thin and floppy side), I needed more variety than garlic all the way. I suggest trying different toppings as well.  There was no wait when we went, but it was early on a weeknight. Might as well go for the novelty of it. The place could use more seating, but what I liked most is that it felt like just a casual pizza joint. You're just grabbing a relaxing bite to eat. No pretentiousness that goes along with a lot of other things in Vegas.",

    "text": "Late night foody call? Secret Pizza is like your go-to foody call that you have on speed dial.  While it may be as good as a booty call, (not that I live that kinda lifestyle) let me break it down to you.  Location 3rd floor next to the Sushi joint. All you really need to know is that it's on the third floor above Marquee and the shops. Chances are you will see a line crawling out of the unmarked hallway and people entering pizza nirvana on the surrounding chairs and couches.   Skip the lines and call it in ahead. Plan for a 20-30 min until the pizzas are ready. Order a pizza pie or 2 or 3. Walk to the front and feel like a VIP as you pass the hangry people in line to pay. No need to explain yourself as there are those people who think you're cutting in line. If you got the pies, just find an open table or couch and start chowing down. If you feel like eyes are gazing at you out of jealousy because you have pizza & they don't, offer them a slice especially if it's an attractive member(s) of the opposite sex. Besides, who doesn't like pizza?  I like the pizza here because it resembles a NY style: thin crust. Awesome in the sense that there won't be the carb overload for the fitness-minded. The pepperoni & sausage is a killer one-two combo. It has just the right amount of grease that plays in a good way when you've been pounding drinks all night. The slices may be a flimsy so you better have a game plan with how you eat a slice (the fold, the roll, etc)  It may not be the best pizza I've had but when with a buzz & late night munchies, this is the go to spot in the wee hours of the morning. This cracks my top 5 Late Night Foodie Call spots.",

My friend had never been to Cosmopolitan and the City Center area so we went there looking for food since it was early for Sin City standards, many restaurants weren't open yet and I completely forgot about Secret  Pizza. I've been wanting to finally check it out and I happened to remember on the whim. Luckily, trusty yelp and friends gave me the tips to find it (next to Blue Ribbon sushi, in a hallway with album art). We just got there around opening time and there was a line already. They had 4 types of pizza ready to go, so I got their white pizza and a pepperoni with spicy sausage. Both were solid and hit the spot. Yummy! And I ate it like a Californian, as my New York-born friend pointed out.",

As you exit the escalator, there is a hallway directly in front of you to the left of Jaleo (tapas restaurant).  Follow this hallway until it ends and there you will find some of the best pizza on the Las Vegas strip.  Seriously, I saw people waiting in line for crap pizza outside, when they could have easily come here for pizza that is 100 times better.  Sold by the slice or whole, this small spot offers a variety of pies to choose from.  Although it's primarily a counter, there is a small amount of space to eat at.  If not, just go eat in the lounge area directly outside the hidden hallway.  I ordered two pepperoni slices for $5.25 each.  They had just come out of the oven so they were hot.  The cheese was really good and gooey as was the pepperoni itself.  This is definitely worth a visit if you're in the mood for a few slices of pizza.",

The white cheese is a ricotta I think...and it's scrumptious, especially when you're drunk.   PEPPERONI just as yummy....but I like the white a little better. TIP: get half and half.

I don't know if I agree with the pricing structure tho... Each slice is 5 bucks (okay, fine, we r on the strip) but if u want to order a full pizza (8 slices), you have to wait an additional 30-45 minutes (after already waiting in line). OR you can get 8 slices in one large pizza box, each slice for 5 bucks, right then. They charge you less if you wait the additional time, so I guess some people don't mind. But perhaps they should form a separate line for those who want a full pizza?",

    "text": "It was 2am and my crew and I were at the Bellagio with our stomachs growling.  I made a suggestion of getting some slices at Sirrico's Pizza at the New York New York resort.  We would be cutting close and our friend suggested a new spot at the new and shiny Cosmopolitan.  I took to my faithful Yelp app and we were down with its near perfect five stars and late hours (until 5am!).  First and foremost, The Cosmopolitan might be the new Wynn.  It's beautiful with hot girls everywhere. The bars are plenty, the resort is bustling with nightlife and good times everywhere you look. We look for a hotel guide and interestingly enough, the pizza place isn't listed.  Odd.  We ask a staff member and up we go on a glass elevator that Tony Montana would have in his mansion.    The pizzeria is nowhere to be found, but the hint of party-goers with paper plates and slices gives you all the info you need.  We head down a dark hallway and make it to our final destination.  The parlor is busy and cracking with hungry customers at all hours. The pizza place is still relatively new and it shows.  There was a small line and we waited a good 10 minutes in line.  As I approached the glass, they had a few pies, which included a combo, veggie, cheese, peperoni, and some other odds and ends.    I went with their veggie offering and a cheese and ricotta slice. The cute cashier (Christie) rang me up and the damage was about $12 for two slices and a Pabst beer.  A set of stools offer a seating area for a few patrons, but expect them to be used at all times.  Fortunately, there's plenty of seating areas nearby. I took my first bite and the pizza was delish! The cheese was gooey and hot.  The veggies were fresh and had that contrast I looked for with the cheese and crust.  Overall, the pizza is great and the \"secret\" location adds a nice cool factor.  The pizza place itself is four stars, but the fact that it's open until 5am and the secret location bumps it one more star.",

I loved the plain cheese with garlic and onions..sprinkle on some oregano/garlic salt/crushed red and magic in your mouth. Bonus-they are open late...like really late 3am-5am ish depending on demand. March 2012 we stayed in the Cosmo and went exploring the 3rd floor for a snack. We would see people in random places enjoying (really enjoying) a slice of pizza. Something about h the pizza and the people eating it put us in the mood for a slice even though all the other places looked great as well. O.k....where is the pizza coming from? While looking for this pizza joint my eye caught a glimpse of a pin ball machine at the end of a hall and I wanted to check it out. Low and behold it was the pizza place. We got a couple slices and fell in love. I didn't see signage anywhere for a name but assumed it was too new for a name? Later that night we wanted to order a whole pie to bring to our room and couldn't find the place on the Cosmo TV directory. I said \"Its like its secret or something\"...my hubby called the desk and asked them and he said \"yeah it has no name..it sa secret..glad you found it\" I think its a very cool and mysterious concept. Anyway he connected us to their phone and we ordered a whole pie for our room....we also each had one more slice as we were getting in the cab to go to the airport to fly back home. Anyway...go you will enjoy it :)  If I could give 4 1/2 I would only because none of their offerings (at-least they weren't yet) are organic and that's a bummer for me. However its vacation and I loosen up a bit.",

    "text": "First off, thank you to everyone on Yelp giving directions to this \"secret\" spot - my brother made it sound very mysterious, so when visiting Cosmopolitan while walking the Strip, I told everyone we had to check it out. We lucked out going around 3pm with barely a wait (I'm sure late night it is crackin'). It's a cool concept, I'll give them that. The fact that there is no signage and the corridor is only marked with records makes you think you are going down a hallway to a restroom or back alley. But the blaring music and everyone outside standing around eating pizza slices makes it a dead giveaway.   For its prices, it's decent pizza. They have a handful of slices to choose from, so I went with my typical white pizza - how I wish they put spinach or another type of green on top! My friend's husband got one with meatball topping and my boyfriend got traditional pepperoni. Our slices were warmed up quickly (my boyfriend lucked out with a fresh slice) and we grabbed our drinks and sat outside the pizza place near the pool table.   Crunchy thin crust covered with decent toppings and lots of cheesy goodness - it's hard to go wrong. But I've had great pizza slices all over New York and San Diego, so I can't say its the best pizza I've ever had. I would love to give it more stars, but with all the pizza places that serve slices late night around Vegas (the one in Aria is just as delicious), Secret Pizza has some competition.",

    "text": "Hidden little gem in Cosmopolitan hotel! This place has no signs, and they do not advertise it. It's one of those... if you know about it type of thing. Funny thing is, I learned about Secret Pizza in an airplane, and knew I just had to try it for myself.  It's tucked away in a little hallway, full of people who just got done clubbing. I guess some can easily say it's drunk people food. Absolutely not!! I believe they do not advertise it because it is \"Secret Pizza\" after all.. I think this place would appeal more to the young adults. There are no actual tables, and just a little bar counter with a few stools and chairs... maybe five? There wasn't really a place to eat, and it would have been pretty awkward to eat there while the line of people stare at you because of the way it was arranged. I recommend getting take-out! Long line, but they do try to get you out of there as quickly as possible. The crust is extremely thin I assume so it can cook much quicker, some of the veggies are pre-cooked in advance, and the mushroom is sliced paper thin to reduce cooking time.  I've eaten pizza from here at least 10 times, and I think it's safe to say it's my absolute favorite pizza joint!   The pizza is delicious! I think it's one of the best one's I've ever had. I still crave it...... WHYYYY do you have to be sooo far away!?!? Well I think only in vegas will I be willing to cough up $40ish for my pizza. Worth every penny though!! The slices are very big, and they are pretty generous with their toppings. I ate at almost every eatery/ restaurant in Cosmo, and I must say, this place was my favorite! I had to eat here twice, and still craved for more!! The menu is literately typed and printed on normal computer paper. The cover of the menu simply says \"Pizza\"  I ordered a Five Toppings \"Pie\"  $29.00 -18 inches, 10 slices. Each Additional topping was $2.25 Toppings Pepperoni Sliced Sausage - Yum! Meatballs Roasted Tomatoes Fresh Garlic- Added a very nice touch Green Peppers Mushrooms-sliced so paper thin to reduce cook time..almost couldn't taste it! ): Onions Ricotta  Overall, I can't wait to go back!! I would highly recommend this place, enjoy!!!",

    "text": "After yelping pizza in vegas, this little \"pizzeria\" came up.   Everyone said it was hidden (read below), and boy was it ever. It's impossible to find without asking someone and is located down a very little hallway between all these fancy restaurants on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan.   Finding it alone was a little adventure, but even more rewarding because the pizza was tasty. I tried a slice of the plain cheese and a slice of the white (so much garlic). Would go again!",

    "text": "This looks like a typical New York pizza joint in Manhattan (in Brooklyn and New Jersey we have tables) - the glass counter, the ovens, no space, a narrow counter on the side with a couple of stools if you refuse to stand up and eat your pizza.  I had a plain and also a veggie.  The pizza was good, but not great.  Unless you're from Fargo, ND.  You can take the pizza place out of New York, but you CAN'T TAKE THE PIZZA!  It is acceptable for Vegas, even good for Vegas.  But it ain't New York pizza.   Still, if you happen to find yourself at the Cosmopolitan - a place I absolutely adore! - and you're on a budget, you can get a slice or two and be perfectly satisfied.  Budget is a dirty word at some of the other restaurants up there on Floor 3.",

    "text": "Directions from other yelpers were spot on.  We had no problem finding it.    We lucked out with our timing because we were the only ones without pizza when we walked in.  Straight to the register and we went simple... 2 pepperoni slices and side of the house made pickled peppers (a must if they have it).  It was delicious and I would definitely go back.  If you appreciate pizza and the simplicity, it was spot on.  I wish I had more room to try other slices but I had been on a food fest since arriving.    Also, it's worth it to come here just to check out the hotel.  Gorgeous!  Felt like I was in some NYC boutique hotel.  Of course the gambling area is like any other.  But the lobby and hallways and shops... it's worth it to come see a beautiful hotel.",

It's great Brooklyn style pizza honestly wish I'd had another slice by the time I got to where I was staying I was hoping they delivered but being a \"secret\" I assumed not.",

    "text": "Stopped in for a weekday lunch. There was a small crowd when we arrived. No menus here. Slices start at $3.00 and it's 50-cents for additional toppings. A full pie is $17. Pizzas are pre-cooked, you make your selection based on what's available and it's tossed in the pizza oven for a few minutes to heat it through and crisp the crust.  We tried the pepperoni, the onions and peppers, the white pizza and the sausage and meatball. The total with two diet cokes was 22.16.  We stood at the counter and enjoyed our slices. Nicely crisp (slight char) chewy crust, light sauce and gooey cheese. The least favorite slice was the sausage and meatball -- bland meats. The favorite was the onion and pepper slice.",
