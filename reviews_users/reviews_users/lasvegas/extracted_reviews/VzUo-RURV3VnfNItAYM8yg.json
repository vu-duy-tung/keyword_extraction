Since I was there with my laptop, she checked on me a few times and see how's everything. Plus, she offered me a sample of their mango slush. Big thumbs up for the service.  However, they kept the door opened for so long and that day was raining and freezing.   Menu/food: They have a wide range of selection on both drinks and food. I got a jasmine milk tea w/ 75% sweetness and chicken chow fun dry. The drink was not too sweet and had a hint of tea flavor to it. For the noodle, I didn't have much expectation for it but it turned out pretty good.  Will go back to try out other drinks and food in the future!",

This time I ordered a Hot Jasmine Milk Teapresso regular sweet w/ honey boba. I really like how you can taste the distinct tea flavor of the jasmine tea. Next time I would get less milk because it taste a little too milky. Other than that, I can say they improved on their drinks and added TVs. Also the taste of the boba improved which deserves a  I've been eyeing this place out before its grand opening and I like to try different boba places. I've heard good things like they have a 20% off during the month of October. Their stamp card will start in November.  SERVICE My server Chung is really nice. He would check on us and how our drinks are doing. He was knowledge on the drinks, and you can try a topping before getting it in your drink as well.  DRINK I got a White Grape Oolong Tea with honey boba and Peppermint Green Milk Tea with honey boba. The oolong tea is strong because they use a teapresso which is like espresso but for tea. The white grape flavor is good and light. The peppermint green milk tea is okay. It's not my cup of tea. The peppermint flavor is strong but that's probably because of the green tea. Their honey boba doesn't have much honey flavor and the texture was not good. I had to wait around 10 minutes, which was fine, but my expectations were disappointed.  CONCLUSION I will be back to try different drinks and food.",

And anyone who lives on the 9th island knows that family and friends visit often. The last 2 times we've come the service has been a little slow but it's ok, the food is great.  Tonight we left with our take out order, drove 15 minutes home and sat down to eat, minus one of our appetizers. When my boyfriend called they said to come back. No way we're coming driving 25-30 minutes round trip for a $6 appetizer. The next answer is that they would call him back, 30 minutes later no call. He calls again and asks for the charges to be reversed and was told they would call after they got ahold of the manager.  Food is great, especially the pork belly moco, but the customer service really needs an upgrade",

They were both very good. I always crave for a good dry chow fun and they do a good job here, not over oily and tasted great. The cake noodles are thin chow mein  egg noodles pan fried crispy (cut into squares) with a sauce on the side. This was also very good but I believe it could have been even better if I had eaten it there (it took me 15 mins. to get home). I also had their taro slush with red beans while waiting for my food and it was one of the better taro slushes I've ever had. They let you choose the sweetness and I picked 50% sweet which was pretty sweet already. Lastly, the girls that are working there were really nice and polite and made me feel welcomed.  No need to have to drive to Chinatown for good authentic quick Chinese food or boba drinks anymore. With all of the good reviews, it looks like they are appreciated.",

The boba was nice and chewy but not rubbery like some places. The coffee was freshly brewed with a perfect amount of sweetness. You can choose your level of sweetness btw.   The food is Hawaiian themed with several of my favorite dishes growing up in Hawaii. I decided to only have a spam musubi since I had already had lunch. It was well made with a lot of seaweed. I love when that they use a lot of seaweed! It adds a great additional flavor to the spam, rice, and sauce. I'm definitely looking forward to going back to try some other menu items.   Service was great too and the island theme of the restaurant brings back nostalgic memories of home. Great job Boba Hut!",

After reading so many great things about this place I just had to see what everyone was raving about and let me tell you, it definitely deserves 5 STARS!!   My girlfriend and I walked in Boba Hut and there was already people dining in. A good sign. Speaking of a sign, you couldn't help but to notice there was a huge logo of \"Boba Hut\" on the wall which was cool because it had pictures of customers who had been there.   There was a foul smell but I'm guessing maybe the place was next to a sewer or something but it doesn't take from the 5 star review.   The young lady at the desk was very helpful and helping us choose our boba. I ended up getting the \"Hawaiian Slush\" which had mangos, pineapple and some other yummy stuff in it. The most exciting part was the mango popping boba. You slurp it up and the flavored boba burst right in your mouth! Sooooo amazing! My girlfriend got the Black Tea Milk with egg pudding and honey boba which was also delicious. We also got the spam masubi candy spam masubi, the loco moco and the fried donuts. Everything was soooo orgasmic!!! We ended up spending $30 lol   Overall, the food was yummy and the service was fast, friendly  and efficient. I definitely will be returning to try more Boba and I highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone!",

    "text": "First time experience at this establishment. It's in a small strip mall. Was in the mood for boba and dropped in. There were special drinks on their chalkboard so I decided to try the Coconut Ube smoothie, made with ube ice cream, and I added honey boba, .50 extra. I like that you can choose your level of sweetness from 0% 25% 50% 75% or 100%. I chose 50. I also got an order of sesame balls. 5 per order and I think they're the best I've ever had. Light and crunchy outside and just enough of the red bean filling. They have Hawaiian food like L & L but I wasn't hungry this time. I will definitely be back.",

I wasn't a big fan of the fact that there was only one size being offered because I like to get a small size when I'm trying out new places. You just don't know if you'll like the taste so it can get wasteful if only a big cup is being offered. When it comes to the taste of my drink... I've definitely had better ones. The strawberry milk tea tasted way too sweet and artificial for me that the color of my drink was literally hot pink. I was surprised to find out after getting my drink that I could've controlled the sweetness level.  Anyway, I've had better boba but I've also had worse.",

Though the name and menu mostly focus on drinks (hot/cold, caffeinated/non, tea, smoothies, etc.), there are also a few Chinese-Hawaiian dishes for small meals and snacks.  The green tea with peppermint and boba, 25% sweetness, was strongly flavored and nicely sized, while the green milk tea with peach and coffee jelly was a little too weird for my taste. Added on a breakfast musubi (spam, egg, and candy bacon) and it knocked my socks off- would come back to try other dishes, quality of food is better than similar spots that offer quick-reheat options.",

    "text": "I came for the wintermelon milk tea and they sure met my expectations! Another great addition to Rainbow Blvd's awesome Asian food lineup.   Boba hut offers different drink flavors, combinations, and toppings you cannot get anywhere else in Las Vegas. They are able to stand up to the stiff competition, no doubt!   This is a Chinese Hawaiian fusion place serving up legit brewed tea boba drinks and Hawaiian comfort food.  Their tea game is strong and they use a Teapresso machine.   The way to order your drinks is to: 1) Pick your base ($3.00): black tea, black milk tea, green tea, or green milk tea. Available in hot or cold.   2) Add flavor ($0.50): plum, peach, mango, lychee, grapefruit, cantaloupe, pineapple, strawberry, honeydew, passionfruit, wintermelon, and peppermint!   3) Sweetness level: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. *Their drinks are pretty sweet here. Personal recommendation...I order either 50%-75%.  4) Add toppings ($0.50): honey boba, rainbow jelly, mango jelly, lychee jelly, coffee jelly, red bean, egg pudding, grass jelly pudding, crystal boba, aloe, and popping boba.   Other drink menu items include: specialty drinks like taro milk tea, thai tea, teaspresso drinks, and more! Also, slushes, non-caffeinated drinks, and smoothies.    If you have a sweet tooth, they have 6 different desserts like malasadas and various tofu puddings!   Here's what I was able to try: - wintermelon milk tea w/ grass jelly - lychee black tea w/ honey boba - white grape oolong teapresso - cake noodles with chicken - popcorn chicken - spam and candy bacon musubi - crystal boba (sample)   I thought their drinks were really good, but needed fine tuning on my part. If you are familiar with wintermelon tea, it is very sweet on it's own. I ordered this at 75% sweetness and it was too sweet for me. Next time, 50% should perfect it! Their tea is strong and very refreshing! The tea does not get muddled at all by flavors or toppings. Crystal boba is not for everyone. I did not like it. It's not starch based like honey boba. It is just a flavorless, clear agar jelly.   Food was hit or miss, but shows a lot of promise. I am super picky with popcorn chicken and this was a miss. It was very bland and missing the seasoning that I am used too. No spicy levels either, just plain ol' popcorn chicken and some fried basil.  A Chinese Hawaiian comfort dish I was able to try for the first time is the cake noodles with chicken...and it was really good! The spam and candy bacon musubi was good, but could use a thicker piece of spam, due to the ratio of rice.   I am pretty amazed with this place and the friendly and prompt service I received. All food and drinks came out in a timely manner. It is pretty spacious compared to other boba places.   Some items I look forward to trying: - Hawaiian slush (pineapple, mango, li hing mui) - Pork belly loco moco - Drunken noodles - Saimin/macaroni soup - Desserts!   I wish I could keep this place a secret, but I love supporting small business and so should you! :)",

Fried to perfection and sauteed with a little jalapeno peppers. They gave them just that perfect little kick. :)  (5/5)  Then I got the stir fried udon noodles....these were flavorful. Udon noodles stir fried with cabbage and onions.  I got this dish with chicken and their chicken had little bits of cartilage still in the chicken. . .did not make for yummy chewing. . .as I was spitting out a lot of chicken with cartilage.  Towards, the end I was just eating the noodles and skipping the chicken.  Minus 1 star for the all the cartilage that I found in the chicken. (4/5)  I also got their drunken noodles.  These were a tad bit on the too dry side and I was really missing the basil flavor in this.  I also got this with chicken and the same issue. . .I just ended up not eating the chicken again.  (3/5)  Brew Tea Bar has them totally beat on the flavor of the milk teas BUT when I am hungry and wanting a milk tea. . .I will probably come here so that I can kill 2 birds with one stone.  =)  At least I am not having to drive all the way to Chinatown for some decent Asian grub, , ,LOL  (5/5) just for the convenience factor. . .=D  On my second visit, I got the drunken noodles again BUT this time I got it with fried tofu. . .it was a special request.  And they were able to meet my needs.  =)  Yes I went back a second time and got the dish that I did not like as much to see if I had gotten it on an off night as I LOVE drunken noodle.  Well apparently I had. . .as the flavor was much improved and I could actually taste hints of the basil running through the dish.  It is a dry noodle dish but this time. . .there was still a little moisture so that the flavors really came through.  This was NOT the best drunken noodle that I have ever had. . .BUT it was pretty darn good.  (4/5)  I also got a Breakfast musubi. . .a musubi with spam, friend egg and BACON!  Need I say more?  Who's got some bacon love???  =)  Let's just say that I ate it the next day for breakfast and it was delicous!!!!  But then again. . .it had bacon. . .=)  And just for the ppl who are bacon fans. . .this was not your think crispy bacon. . .this actually had some meat on it.  yay!!!  =)  (5/5)  Staff was completely friendly!  =)  Both times I was there. . .very friendly and very helpful.  =)  So overall, I gave them 4 stars. . .I am definitely looking forward to going back trying some of the other dishes on their menu.  =)",

I didn't get to taste the pork belly loco moco but I'm assuming it was legit since the fiance devoured his plate. I've had cake noodle before and yes, it was just like back home...I just wish they added more veggies!!!!

This thing is amazing! If you love pork belly as much as me, you need to stop what you're doing and head straight to Boba Hut. A large order is two scoops of rice with about 5 of 6 slices of sweet pork belly covered in a slightly spicy aioli and topped with two eggs cooked to order. Together it's sweet, spicy, savory goodness served with a side of mac salad.  If you want more pork, get the pork belly buns. An order is two buns, each with a slice of pork belly, pineapple, and cilantro. If you still have room after that, get some tarts for dessert. Made by Ono Sweetz 702, the assorted order of a dozen gives you a variety of Hawaiian flavors.  4.5 Stars",

    "text": "I came back to Boba Hut for a study session. I am glad to see some improvements and this time around got to try some of their food. My final verdict is...this place is not bad, but not my most favorite.  SERVICE A lot more welcoming than the last time. Unlike the attitude I got from a girl on my last visit, this guy at the counter was friendly and helpful in deciding which drink I should get. He personally handed the drink to me and told me I can make adjustments to my drink, which is something the girl never said in my last visit.   DRINK/FOOD Drinks I have tried so far:  Jasmine Milk Tea- 100% is too sweet for my liking but still my favorite out of all the drinks I have tried. 5/5  Whitegourd Green Milk Tea- ordered at 75% sweetness and added honey boba. Despite the ridiculously sweet taste of white gourd, I still tasted tea. I must say they brew some good teas here. 4/5  Coffee Milk Tea-100% sweetness was good. Strong black tea with few shots of espresso. Perfect for all-nighter. 4/5  White Peach Oolong Tea-just ok. I was surprised to see how much ice they put in this drink. Very subtle peach flavor and strong oolong tea. 3/5  White Grape Oolong Tea-pretty good! Very light grape flavor and tea flavor but refreshing. 100% sweetness was bit too sweet for me. Unique flavor that I haven't had in other places. 4/5  Cantaloupe Milk Tea-75% sweetness turned out to be too sweet once again. Similar to Honeydew Milk Tea, maybe a tad bit sweeter. 3/5  Taiwanese popcorn chicken was something different. It came with seasoning which was on the saltier side. Their popcorn chicken, French fries and sweet potato fries are perfect snacks to order on the side.  CONCLUSION Their teaspresso is amazing. No matter what flavor you get, you can always taste a hint of tea. I personally think their teas are brewed stronger than Brew Tea Bar or Kung Fu Tea. Try their teas! Also, go 50% or 75% sweetness level as many of the drinks they serve are extremely sweet to begin with.",

    "text": "As I was browsing through yelp looking at all the boba spots in town, I came across this place. Instantly, I was interested in trying the place out because I saw that they also served food! Hawaiian food in particular.   I entered on an afternoon and it was packed with a bunch of high schoolers. Despite the crowd, I was still noticed and immediately greeted by the cashier who was certainly a friendly face.   For the most part, the boba places I have visited here in the desert does not ALWAYS offer egg pudding or red beans as your topping. So I thought that was cool or perhaps I havent been to too many boba shops to notice. Random thought as I was waiting for my drink because it did take a bit to come out (they were pretty busy so they had a ticket out of this one)...why is it called a 'topping' if it is at the bottom of the drink. Retarded question, but it was like an epiphany as I was zoning out. Lol.  I'm not a milk tea drinker. I go green...I go black...tea! So I can't review on such. I did cheat on Tea Time by trying what I know best, which is the strawberry black tea. Told you I like to live life on the edge. I opted for no boba which I somewhat regretted because my drink, suprisingly, needed the boba. My taste buds felt like it was lacking something, and if you've read my other reviews...I'm not much of a boba eater so that says a few thangs.  The drinks come in 1 size, a large size that is. You can pick your level of sweetness that goes 0, 25, 50, 75, 100 percent. I chose 25 and found the sweet level to be just right for me. The cashier said if it isn't sweet enough then she can sweeten it up for me. Didn't need her to, but glad to know they honor such adjustment. The strawberry flavor was certainly present, and I can even taste the black tea. Awesome! I just didn't like the strawberry base they use so I wasn't estatic.  Ordered the husband a taro milk tea with red beans. He loved the red beans, but said he couldn't really taste the rainbow...I mean, the taro.   Overall, my drink wasn't that bad and I suppose my husband felt the same. I wouldn't come from the North side all the way to Spring Valley for it. They do serve food in which some items on the menu did interest me. Pricing is pretty reasonable and is similar to most places both boba and food.  I definitely love their menu options. Perhaps if I ever return while i''m in the vicinity I can explore more to give a better review based on their food. For now, that's the best I can give you. I will say give it a shot if you happen to be driving by and want boba at the same time. However, I won't recommend a person who has to drive across town for their boba itself. There'd enough boba spots across the valley to get your fix.  Definitely kid and stroller friendly!",

I was chatting with a friend and they really appreciated the light as well as how there wasn't any music (since he likes to study and relax). This may vary with some people who might prefer to have music.   Management is open to any opinions and suggestions so feel free to let them know! Drink adjustments are encouraged if you are not happy with your drink.   They only have one size for their drinks and it's a large. For the price they charge, it's competitive with other establishments. Don't forget to grab stamp cards!  Not every food item is available since they just opened but definitely try out their food and see how you like them! I prefer the beef with chow fun noodles myself :).",

I was getting a car wash and decided to place an order for pick up.   When I got to Boba Hut, I expected the inside to be basic like a L&L or Ohana BBQ. I walked in and was surprised to find it to be very modern. Inside is very clean and well kept. I picked up my order with ease. I didn't have to wait and it was already ready for pick up.   I ordered the Pork Belly Moco and the Pork Gau Gee. I didn't set high expectations since Pork can be over cooked and end up being dry. I was impressed as I ate my Pork Belly Moco. The Pork was moist and not dry. The sauce on The Pork Belly was a very good pairing. The gau gee was good and the sweet sour dipping sauce was tasty.   I am sold as a customer and will come back for sure.",

Originally I just wanted a Boba drink, to my surprise they   had plenty of food too! I ended up trying the Chicken Katsu and a Passion fruit  Green tea with lychee boba. Not a bad meal and drink for a little over $10. The Katsu was delicious, I have had this dish at plenty of other places and this one is my new favorite. They used very fresh and lean cuts of chicken, the breading was crunchy and the gravy (or sauce) was sweet and flavorful. The Tea was delicious as well, this was the first time i have ever tried lychee boba (recommended by the very polite girl at the counter) and it will definitely not be the last time I order this exact drink. The restaurant is super clean and tidy. Which I guess is to be expected with a location that just opened recently, but still, got to love a squeaky clean dining room. There is only one one thing I would change, the chicken katsu was served in a styrofoam container (check out the picture) and the order was not \"to go\" and maybe its just me but I have a strong dislike of styrofoam food containers. However, for the price and quality of the food and drink I will definitly be back.....often!",

Really hate to do this, but it's been over an hour and a half  since I left Boba Hut without my Fried Tofu after waiting 30+ minutes for the order to be filled.  When I called, the kid who answered knew exactly what I was talking about, but his solution was for me to load my toddler into the car and drive back to the restaurant for an appetizer that would be sitting under a heat lamp.  Sorry, that won't fly, not after a 14 hour day.  I suggested he could send it with one of the Uber Eats drivers who kept going in and out (3 while I was waiting, undoubtedly contributing to a long wait time, there was no one else in the restaurant) but for some reason that wasn't agreeable.  He took my name/number, said the charges would be reversed after he called the manager (not on property, I guess).  35 minutes later, and no response. I called back, he said the manager couldn't be reached.  Sorry, that's just piss poor business practices.  I told this poor kid I would have my CC cancel the trainsaction if I didn't hear from someone in 5 minutes...its been 35.  Maybe my reaction is a bit much, but that tofu is awesome.  Accidents happen, people make mistakes but you really stand out when you Own Up to it and make a person feel like you give a damn.  This sucks, I really like Boba Hut but now they're dead to me.",

The area around the shop is pretty empty; it's right next to a huge tattoo parlor and barbecue restaurant. So there's plenty of parking. When you first come in, the atmosphere is modern with a hint of Asian culture with the bamboo trees around the front; you're also greeted by a friendly cashier! The store is extremely clean which is pretty hard to do when a ton of high schoolers constantly come and go!  My server and cashier today, Taimane was very friendly and a lot of help getting me accustomed to their menu! I forgot my card up at the front and she came to the table to return, which I thought was so much better than yelling across the room (props to her for being polite!)   The menu on screen is pretty decent but on the paper menu, it has such a variety of foods! Today I ordered a green tea peach with honey boba with the sweetness level of 75% which was BOMB! It wasn't too sweet and the boba wasn't frozen! I also got spam musubi and their seaweed was crispy and the spam was super warm!   I'm looking forward to coming in more often!",

    "text": "Up until recently we've only been making the drive down to Boba Hut just to pick up yummy Ono Sweetz 702 desserts that are sold there. This past week we decided to actually order some food. And to our surprise the food was good! I say that we were surprised because like most Boba places the food is always borderline good/bad with the food coming in second place to the drinks. We tried a BBQ Chicken Plate, Diamond Beef Cake Noodles & Lobster Balls. We feel that if the most basic food on a menu comes out flavorful then that means that everything else will be flavorful as well. Their ( basic) BBQ Chicken was bursting with flavor & was delish! The Diamond Beef was flavorful & so soft - topped on fried noodles cut into little cakes were a perfect compliment to eachother. I enjoyed the little lobster balls but it wasn't enjoyed by everyone- maybe an added sauce would be better. We also do not like Boba so we tried 2 drinks minus the boba. He got aThai Iced Tea 50% sweet & I got Tiger's Blood made with normal sweetness. Tiger's Blood was delicious! It was enjoyed by everyone else as well. Tiger's Blood is Strawberry, Watermelon, Coconut Slush made with Sweetened Condensed Milk. That drink is a winner! A must try! Anyways, I hate that Boba Hut is not close to me, a bit of a drive but we look forward to trying other food items. On a seperate occasion I did try a breakfast musubi made with Candy Bacon, Spam & Egg. Candy Bacon is Awesome Sauce! Just say'in!!!",

I ordered the lychee black teapresso and it was delicious, the fact that I was able to chose the level of sweetness made it better. Also, with the boba drinks they add the right amount of boba unlike the other boba places where the boba basically over powers the drink.",

There's private parking so you don't have to park on the street as well.  Some cons are there are no bike racks for you if that's how you commute. There's no outside dining area either.

With that being said, in my mission to find awesome cake noodle in Vegas, Boba Hut has been the best so far.  The cake noodle itself is done near perfection. Portion is generous. Price is reasonable.   So what's the problem? The sauce and the meat. It was too sweet and lacked the hole-in-the-wall Cantonese flavor. It was like putting teriyaki sauce and teriyaki chicken on top of the noodles. Not what I was looking for, but again the noodles alone were enough to give this a 4-star rating.  Bobs Hut is clean, well located and has friendly people there. I didn't try anything else though I'd definitely come back to sample some other things.",

Being from Hawaii it's hard to find good quality Hawaiian food in Vegas. Loco moco ..amazing! Pork belly loco moco ... yes yes! Spam Musubi with the candied bacon... best I've ever had. Pork Belly buns are delicious and the bun was perfection. Chicken Katsu was not what I was expecting but it was amazing! Over all extremely satisfied and will definitely be ordering again.   Adding a second review to boba hut cause I guess I can only leave one review on yelp.. unbelivably good! Again! If their food is this good after being made, picked up and driven 10 minutes... I can't wait to actually go in and eat. Tried the Lau Lau and standard katsu. Best Lau Lau I've had since living in Hawaii. Hands down! Whoever is preparing and cooking in that kitchen knows their stuff!!!! Katsu was awesome. Sauce could be a tad thicker but flavor is spot on. Kalua pork was a amazing! Only suggestion is the Mac salad noodles are a tad too soft. But every Mac salad is different so it's a personal preference. Still amazing flavor. Yum yum yum! If I could give 10 stars I would :)",

After school is the worst time to come here because it's to damn crowded with kids asking for free food or drinks.  The drinks are pretty good here too but the boba could be better, with a name Boba hut I would expect this place to have banging boba but it's mediocre. I can't knock the place though since they do make some pretty good priced food and it does come out quick too.",

    "text": "Does anyone else smell an off-setting scent in the building? It's always the first thing I notice when I walk in.   In my opinion, drinks taste very powder-based. I've recently had the Hokkaido milk tea (prefer Brew's) and Okinawa brown sugar (tasted just like regular milk tea) and I'd only stop in for drinks again when the location is convenient. There are better milk tea options.  On the bright side, Boba Hut does have a lot of food options that are quite tasty for a great price. Their pork belly options are abundant- you can get them in a bun, with rice, or in an onion pancake. There's also teriyaki and katsu chicken along with soup and noodle options. They all taste pretty unhealthy but that's where the taste comes from :-). Tarts from 702Sweets (I think) are available. Please make the li hung Mui ones again! Those are amazing.  Seating has always been open when I've come in.  I do wish that not every food item was served with styrofoam, as that prevents me from wanting to try more dishes. They are pretty accepting about using my own reusable cup and containers though.",

    "text": "Admittedly, I didn't put too much thought into my first review here because I was in a bit of a hurry, but I honestly come here so often that I think it's only fair I leave them a more thorough review.  First and foremost, I HAVE to stress this to you: if you have been here before and know what you want, you probably know to call in your order instead. The wait time from paying at the register and waiting for your food/drink is ridiculously long most of the time.  With that being said, tonight I did not have enough time to call ahead so I had no choice but to wait. I ordered my usual Oreo Oolong Milk Tea 100% sweetness (you have the option to keep your drink at its sweetest or lessen it) with no toppings, and 2 candied bacon spam musubis. At 9:03pm I paid, at 9:20pm I received my order. With no one ahead of me, I don't understand how that could take so long. 17 minutes.  I love coming here. It's close, I love my milk tea here, and they have tons of food choices. I just hate that it takes so long that I'm compelled to call my order in all the time.   For every drink you purchase you get a stamp on a stamp card, after 10 stamps you get a free regular size/priced drink ($3.50 I think?). What bothered me today was that if you check in on FB you get 10% off but they began this new policy just this week it seems where if you check in on FB for the discount, you don't get the stamp on the stamp card. To me, that's stupid and doesn't make sense as those are two completely different things.   Regardless of how long their food takes and the stupid policy they've implemented, this place is still my go-to boba place.",

    "text": "We were inspired to come today purely by the Ono Sweetz deserts b/c she no longer had deserts over at Paina Cafe, so here we are, lol. After hearing about it, we came straight to Yelp to check out other menu items before heading over since it is across town from us.   To our surprise they had food options too, wha-aat?  Boba Hut is a Chinese & Hawaiian Fushion restaurant serving you appetizers like Crab Rangoon's, Potstickers, your typical Spam Masubi to Spam & Candy Bacon Masubi. You can also grab a Hawaiian Plate (katsu, Okonomiyaki Katsu, Loco Moco, kalua Pork etc) and they also have their Asian Plates/Bowls (Sweet & Sour Chicken, Beef & Broccoli, Mongolian Beef, Cake Noodles, Chow Mein, Chow Fun etc), Saimen and Burgers too! Phew!!!!  We ordered the Crab Rangoon for an appetizer. We were super excited to see that they were HUGE compared to other places we've tried. The outside was Cooked to a golden brown perfection, the filling lacked a little flavor. Definitely missing the crab flavor and the ratio of filling to wonton considering they were larger than normal, could have been more. From the Hawaiian Plate Menu, we ordered a large Chicken Cutlet which comes with the gravy on the side, 2 scoops of rice and yes, Macaroni salad. The Cutlet had the perfect fry and color to it, nice light & crispy. The gravy was dark and thick with just the right amount of seasoning. Taste homemade like my grandma used to make it. The Mac (I'm not a Mac salad kinda gal, BUT I tried it! and for me, I tasted too much celery and onion, so that was no go for me.) and from the Asian Plates we ordered Mini Chicken Cake Noodle. The chicken itself was so flavorful, I could probably eat that on its own. The noodles were cut up into small square pieces which I assume for easier eating, usually it's fried down in one cluster. The cake noodle sauce was a little on the saltier side for my taste buds but otherwise tasted good. We also had to order an extra sauce b/c the amount they gave us was not enough to get all the noodles soft.   Lastly, the Boba!!!! Since we ate in, I got a Peach Green Tea w/ 50% sweetness which I probably could have got 25% and would have been more than enough sweet for me. My boyfriend got the Hawaiian Slush ( Pineapple, Mango & Li Hong Mui) guess what? He really liked it!!! That says a lot when it comes to Boba drinks b/c there are few that he actually likes.   P.S The True reason we stopped by was for the tartes. No where to be found? Maybe they get delivered on certain days?   The rundown; overall 3/5 stars for Boba Hut. The food is good, there are items on the menu that you can definitely find at other Hawaiian restaurants in the valley but they do have quite a few different menu items that I'd come back to try.   Customer service and menu knowledge is lacking. The first cashier when we asked, what was the Okonomiyaki Katsu, she couldn't tell us anything about it, had to grab the other girl who didn't really know herself. We were asked if we had Katsu and then asked if we had a different dish (I can't remember the name. which we never had?) and then said it has stuff on the top which we asked what kind of stuff? B/c we really didn't know and there was no description on the menu. She then proceeded to say oh mayo, seaweed and some sauce?? Okay? Maybe next time? Then considering we were the only ones in the place, it took quite a while for every thing to come out. I feel like they have some kinks to work out but once they do, I think that everything else will get better. So that's why I knocked off a star.   Happy Eating!",

I got my favorite, which is honeydew with honey boba. There is only one size for boba tea.  I'm so spoiled. I've grown accustomed to warm honey at the bottom of my drink and lots of boba. That wasn't the case here, but it was still very good. The honeydew slush was chunky and bright green. It was watery and super sweet. Too sweet. In their defense, you can adjust the sweetness level, but i had nothing to compare it to since this was my first time.   The eatery was pale and had a central tall ordering area. The trash can was a little caked with food, but overall it seemed clean. The lady who took my order was quick and friendly. She had a line so she asked me nicely to step aside. I waited and and received my tea. Overall I was happy, just not wowed.   I think I would go back, but I will tell them to make it a milk iced tea with honeydew and not so sweet. That should do the trick.",

It's pretty good boba and they seem to have ongoing specials. I ordered the strawberry slush and my husband ordered the Thai tea. I also like that you can choose your level of sweetness. The service was pretty quick, too.",

The noodles were fine, but the gravy that it comes with was way too thick and it tasted like chlorine! Sooo nasty, I just threw it away. The Hawaiian slush was also not as good as I remember. The drink was not blended well and I kept crunching on big pieces of ice.   I had other things to do, so I wasn't going to drive back there to complain and then wait a long time to get them to re-do everything. Sadly, this was the only place I know in town that had good cake noodles, but I refuse to come back!",

I ordered their breakfast musubi and cake noodles, which to my delight was delicious. As a local from Hawaii, musubis' are no stranger to me and having tried a few hundred or so in my life, this one was surely unique. It had your usual spam and egg but it also came with candy bacon which I thought was interesting. The portions were decent and the price was fair but what really made my experience here special was the free boba drink I received from the owner for being a local from Hawaii.

The first time I tried this place, I ordered off of grubhub and when I went over to pick up my food, they said they didn't receive my order because their grubhub thing was down. I was disappointed because I was waiting pretty long but they took my order and I was out of there within 10-15 mins.   Although their food is really good... I didn't like the coconut milk tea. I got it at 25% sweetness and it was just way too sweet for my liking. :(   But overall, great place. I will continue coming here especially since it's literally 5 mins away. Hopefully I won't be disappointed trying another boba drink.",

    "text": "Wow. What a find. We were in Vegas visiting and found this jewel. Craving some Hawaiian food, this place hit it on the money.   The drinks are amazing. Hubby ordered the honeydew slush and I opted for the strawberry slush with the strawberry/lychee popping balls. The best so far that we've tried.   We also ordered some Hawaiian dishes. If you ever been to Hawaii, you definitely know how authentic local food taste like. I've been to plenty of places and only a few have actually tasted the same.   We ordered the loco moco, the Hawaiian mixed plate, and spam musubi. This place was on point. Food tastes just like it would in Hawaii. I wish we had one of these back home. Vegas is a lucky place to have them.   Service was very friendly and the wait time was minimal because things have to be cooked fresh. I ended the meal with red bean sesame balls. Wow.  Super pleased and will miss this place. Definitely will come back to them when I am in town.   Keep up the awesome job!",

I told the cashier it was my first time, and she kindly went over the top picks of this place. I ended up getting the BBQ Mix Combo, come hungry cz they pack up this dish up.

    "text": "Talk about more then Boba! All the recent Boba places opening around town and even been noticing existing restaurants now serving Boba. I just assume Boba Hut was another Boba place getting in on the mix. What I found out was a tiny family run restaurant that serves nice diversity of food, great great value for the price, most dishes under ten dollars, and good local food.   The diversity of the menu. Half of the menu is local comfort food from 808 like chicken katsu, kalbi, and really most part see at any local Hawaii style restaurant. The other half has nice selection from typical Chinese dishes like Drunken Noodles, Chow Fun, and then asian fusion with the pork belly action done few different ways. Some traditional Taiwanese dishes. So if looking for asian comfort food Boba Hut has you covered pretty good.   My first visit went with comfort food ordered the Kalua Pork with Cabbage. The Kalua Pork was Ono. It had nice salty taste, cooked perfect, nice portion of cabbage (nice big cuts sometimes see cabbage cut thin blends in with the pork), and had two scoops rice and mac salad. The Mac salad honestly ONLY thing that stopped me from giving it five stars. Mac Salad to be honest was one of the worst ones ever tasted. Mac Salad that huge part of any plate lunch. The thing I was not fan of was the mayo or dressing lacked flavor, seasoning, water down consistency, and not very good. I also ordered the Pork Belly Bun with Cilantro and Pineapple for appetizer. Talk about solid. Steam buns find it to be hit or miss. Usually been miss for me that it not come out hot or moist. Next thing know biting into hard outer crust steam bun, not moist on the inside or hot, and kills the whole dish. Right off the top the steam bun was nice moist, hot, no crust, and could eat dozen buns by itself. You add the grilled pork belly that tell marinade for while and the flavor was awesome. Fill it out with sprig of cilantro and pineapple. It add nice little sweet citrus and cilantro balance out soy based (just guessing the marinade) spot on. No doubt one appetizer will be ordering again.  Second visit want try one of the noodle dishes. I ordered the Drunken Noodle with Beef. I don't normally order Drunken Noodle so have no idea if authentic or not. All I do know it was very hearty. Good. Not just only noodles. Bean sprouts, onions, nice amount of sliced beef (not skimpy of the cuts), and think even eggs in it. One thing watch out if not fan of spicy. They add small thai peppers that sneaks up on you with the heat. Another dish would order again.   I mention earlier nothing really over ten dollars. The value one dish is all you need and even then might end up with leftovers. Friday and Saturday it open late till midnight. I think is awesome. Most local places I know close at 10 so if looking for late night local food outside California. Great option. They do love yelpers. I had no idea until the cashier told me with your check-in on yelp get 10% off the bill. The s staff is awesome. Both times went cashier is friendly, attentive, and they remember my face second visit. Details.   It in the same shopping complex as the Dickie barbecue. It tucked around the corner of the building so not as visible off rainbow.   I love the fact its right down the road for me. I definitely plan on coming back again again.",

    "text": "A new launched Boba / Tea / Asian & Hawaiian Fusion on south Rainbow, Clean and Spacious. Its grand opening will be in November.   Their brew tea is made to order from the TEAPRESSO equipment, and you can choose your preferred sweetness level and ice. But the flavored tea will come with at least 50% sweetness if you need to know. They also have various toppings for the customers to choose, such as jelly, crystal boba and popping boba (they all come with diverse flavors), egg pudding and red bean.. etc.  We tried 4 different flavored tea and 3 dishes there:   - Passion Fruit Tea with Red Bean: This is my favorite! Great passion fruit taste with the perfectly brewed tea, fresh and impressive. The red bean is soft and well-cooked, too.  - White Peach Tea with Lychee jelly: Extremely fresh taste with rich flavored Lychee jelly, just perfect for summer time or to wake you up like the breeze.  - Taro Milk Tea with Crystal Boba: Great milk tea with beautiful color from taro. Crystal Boba is interesting to try if you haven't had it before.   - Black Milk Tea with Boba and Egg Pudding - I think they make the best Boba in town, chewy and not too hard.   Too bad that they ran out of Grass Jelly, I am sure I will go back to try it next visit. Wish them to  provide the real milk instead of just creamer to make the milk tea tho.   * Cake Noodles with Grilled Chicken: This is something new to me, and I haven't seen any other restaurants having it. It is really good, especially if you were a big fan of HK style noodles. The chicken is so juicy and tender. Highly recommended!   * Drunken Noodles: It won me with the saporous basil favor!    * Mango Fried Rice with Cashew and Chinese Shredded Pork: Fried Rice is something simple but requires excellent skill to cook. I believe they have really talented and experienced chefs to make the fried rice flavorful but not greasy.",

I would highly recommend giving this boba place a try, the menu allows you to adjust the level of sweetness and add additional toppings to specially customize your drink.

I had a lychee green tea with 75% sweetness and a full order of chicken katsu.  Awesome flavor! Drink wasn't too sweet and the katsu was not over fried nor over breaded which I love!  Will definitely come back.  Oh! And I love that they have WiFi :)",

    "text": "Summary: Go here if you're an iced tea snob, milk tea with boba lover, or if you're hungry for good Hawaiian or Chinese food. Bring friends, because there's room for them too! :)  Background for this Review: I've interviewed the owner to get some insight on their background and history and tried some of the food and drinks. I've not tried everything yet. The interview information is at the bottom.  -Promotional Soft Opening Discount - There's a promotion going on! 20% off everything until the end of the month. So you can decide if you like it or not and not break the wallet :)  ---------------------------------------------- MY FIRST EXPERIENCE- First Visit - Oct 18th, 2015 - Dinner time  I visited on the first soft opening day. No music yet and when I asked about it they said they're putting in speakers and music soon. So if you go and it's still quiet, they're working on it xD  Decor is Modern/Contemporary. Cute glowing balls hanging from the ceiling. Size is good for groups! They'll be adding more seating later too after establishing occupancy limit.  My Teapresso order: I ordered the Osmanthus Oolong Teapresso! (Iced, 100% Sweetness).   Why that order? I ordered it because I looked up osmanthus and it's a floral note. Flower xD And I've been into floral notes on teas for a while now.  Tea Speed: The Teapresso came out pretty quickly. Maybe 3-5 mins max? I was talking with friends so I didn't time it but it was really quick.  Tea Flavor: The flavor was great. I'm picky on tea lol. The floral notes and the Oolong flavor were great. A little sweet but the flavor of the tea was not overpowered at all. The espresso machine does a great job lol. I recommend with a less or no sweetness if you're not too into sweet teas. I'm usually a fan of no sweetener or just lightly sweetened.  I also tried my friend's jasmine milk tea with boba. Jasmine flavor was great ^__^  I also ordered some appetizers: I tried the Bbq Chicken Musubi and the Onion Pancake. It was their first day and it was packed so it took a little while to come out but not too long. Maybe 15 mins. The musubi was awesome xD just how it should be. Great flavor and hot. The Onion Pancake was huge. Not a lot of flavor but that's what an onion pancake is like lol. Maybe try it Pork Belly style. My friend got curry fish balls and I dipped it in the curry and that was awesome xD I suggested it to the owner so I hope he adds that in lol.  MY FRIEND'S FOOD My friend got the loco moco and a breakfast musubi (spam, egg, candy bacon) and he loved them xD and the curry fishballs lol.  P.S. The chairs are a little squeaky on the floor right now when you move them around. They're aware now and will work on it :) ----------------------------------------------  MY SECOND EXPERIENCE -  SECOND VISIT - Oct 20th, 2015 - Lunch Time  I visited the 3rd day of soft opening and there were a few people there. The owner was there and I told him I tried the Osmanthus Oolong Teapresso last time and I liked that. And I asked for another recommendation so he said definitely try the Peach Oolong Teapresso. I did and I'm not disappointed :) I lowered the sweetness level to 50%. That's enough for me. Came out pretty quick :) It was great ^__^ peach flavor is nice with the Oolong.  After sitting here for an hour or so on my laptop, lots of high school kids nearby dropped by to try it out. The line got long lol.   Oh. WIFI is free. Just ask them for the password :)   ----------------------------------------------  INTERVIEW INFORMATION BELOW  SPECIALTIES  The following information is information derived from my interview with the owner: ---------------------------------------------- The Teapresso - Tea in various flavors made using an espresso machine for a stronger flavor, for tea snobs and casual tea lovers alike.  Tea Quality - They went through a lot of trial and error choosing their teas and I'd say they did great. Before opening they did extensive taste testing with a lot of testers. Decide for yourself if it's up to your standards ^__^  Boba Quality - Fresh honey boba! I would talk to them if you experience anything different.  Hawaiian Food and Chinese Food - The owner is a passionate chef who comes from a family that owns and runs successful Chinese and Hawaiian restaurants. You'll find the best recipes from both worlds :)  Catering - Yes! They do catering. Various kinds of Hawaiian style chicken, pork, beef, and sides. ----------------------------------------------  -PRICING (menu in pictures)-  DRINKS range from $3.00-$4.50 with options to add toppings and flavors for $0.50 each. Adjusting sweetness level is free :)  APPETIZERS range from about $2-$6.50 on average  PLATES/BOWLS from $6.50-$11ish depending on the dish and size you choose (small/large)  NOODLES/RICE dishes around $7.50-9 and some soups and burgers with Hawaiian flair.  Catering pricing around $40-90 for meat. Cheaper for rice and sides.  ----------------------------------------------  Thanks for reading!",

The food and drink came out looking amazing.  Overall, my friend and I had a great lunch here. Will definitely recommend to everyone to stop by and grab a drink and something to eat when you're around the area. I will be stopping here on my way into the work or on my way home in the future for sure!",

The food came out in about 15 minutes but there was a full house so to be expected",

Although I was standing right in front of the cashier, she proceeded to ignore me and pass out the menu to the group behind me. Now I know the cashier was trying to streamline everything by doing this action; however, I felt a little insignificant since she didn't even bother to acknowledge me until the group behind me had the menu in their hands. This is something I'm sure she will learn with more experience but I personally would have acknowledge first and ask the customer in front of me if it were ok I pass the group behind me a menu. This way everyone gets served properly and no kn  The food was good but a bit salty. 25 minutes is a little long to wait for food. I see why people do phone orders now. I seen 4 sets of people walk in specifically for a phone order. I will prolly do the same as well the next time I come.",

Place is manini so not a lot of tables-- just a heads up.   I usually have a terrible experience when I attend soft openings but today has been nothing but awesome. Being Asian, I think I'm programmed to be a boba critic and Boba Hut blew my mind. With their various tea selections, flavor add-ons, sweetness level adjustments and multiple toppings, you will definitely find something you like.   I had the Lychee Black Teaspresso drink with Honey Boba and was in lychee heaven because they added lychee pieces! Also tried their Honeydew Slush w/ Lychee Jelly and it was super sweet. Probably my least fave but the boyfriend loved it. Haha. And finally the Hawaiian Slush w/ Honey Boba-- Pineapple & Mango slush w/ Li Hing Mui powder. Yes, fellow Hawaiians, you will be so pleased with this one.   Onto the food: Delicious! Came out warm and very plentiful. They do half half combos. Had the Chicken Katsu & Kalua Pork while the other half had Chicken Katsu & Orange Chicken. Katsu was crispy and moist while Kalua pork was piping hot, with cabbage and just the right amount of salt. I typically don't like orange chicken but this one was lightly sauced so it wasn't overwhelmingly sour/sweet.   The customer service was excellent! All the workers were very friendly and attentive. Greeted us, served us and bid us goodbye with smiles. Already thinking about what to get next time I go on a fatty date here. New fave place for sure!",

Their drinks range from roughly a dollar cheaper than all other boba places I've been to in town.  They're located right off Russell and Rainbow across from spring valley hospital, and parking is very abundant and easy.  I tried their mini chicken cake noodles which was extremely good, the chicken was tender and moist and very flavorful. Portions are also very generous for the price, I shared it with another person, and it was enough for both of us to get full off of.  For my drink, I got the grapefruit green tea with normal sweetness. It wasn't overly bitter at all and still was able to retain just enough sweet and sour flavor to be refreshing and enjoyable. The owners and workers are also all extremely friendly and attentive, while the inside is very clean and comfortable. In short, Boba hut gives the 5 star treatment so I only see it fit it gets my 5 star rating.",

My first inclination is that they only serve drinks but the food menu is surprisingly large for a a place whose name suggests only boba.  I've had the house milk tea with boba and green milk tea with boba and recommend the half sweetness since they use honey boba.  The half sweetness level is just right in my opinion.  As for food I've only tried the BBQ chicken plate which satisfied my hunger but the flavor was mediocre and the chicken itself was a bit tough and not tender.  Plenty of parking in the shopping center and service is decent since it's a walk up counter.  I did have an issue waiting for my food and drink one time as there was only one person ahead of me but I waited about 15 minutes for a house milk tea and BBQ chicken plate.  Overall a nice place for boba drinks and Hawaiian/Chinese snacks and dishes.",

Here you order the base of black or green regular/milk tea, then you order your flavors, and lastly you adjust your sweetness level and any toppings you want added to your drink. I ordered the green milk tea with lychee flavor, at a 50% sweetness level with strawberry flavored popping boba (yeah that's a mouthful)  But don't get me wrong, the drink I got was really good, definitely on the sweeter side than most drinks I've gotten before, an acquired taste personal to me.

My 5 star review is based on their food, price, and service (sorry, not a bubble tea drinker). I ALWAYS get their pork belly moco and leave satisfied. Their mac salad is one of my favorites and I've tried at least 5 other Hawaiian BBQ joints since moving here. Plenty of variety and have Chinese type dishes available as well.  HEADS UP!

I had to scrape off most of the sugar that was on there. It was good yet just WAY too much.  I also had the white peach oolong teapresso no pearls and 50% sweetened. Glad I ordered 50% cause it was slightly sweet. It wasn't bad yet it made me wonder how sweet it was if I had ordered it regular.   Tried their masubi spam & Portuguese sausage. Spam was great fair enough slice of spam but the Portuguese could use a bit more meat in my opinion.   It was really quite and chill till the high school students was out of school then it got crowded.  Restroom is really clean. Service was great. I would come back again and try other choices on their menu. They do offer a reward stamp card which is cool since I'd be back. Nice place to just hangout but plugs aren't easily accessible if you wanted a recharge.",

She's like oh yes, you bought one drink, right. Speechless, but I said yes lol it doesn't matter as we don't wanna give them another chance.

This was not it! The gravy was super sweet and so was the minute chicken. Minute chicken has a more soy sauce flavor not sweeet teriyaki!

I shouldn't have to do it but when you live 30 minutes from the place, you just make due and not drive back there to waste time and gas for a slip up they made.  we did check our to go bags before we left and assumed the gravy was already poured over the cake noodle - the to go plates had what was in it written on it.

It's really real coffee guys not only is the drink itself oh so yummy, but so is the boba which is a major plus. Cause it seems that a lot of boba places forget that BOBA is the real star of the show and tend to over soak their balls in some sort of honey and sugar concoction which doesn't appeal to me at all lol. Not here, the honey and sweetness of the actual boba is very subtle and I enjoy it very much.   Customer service is great and the food options sound appetizing too.  **EDIT** So the last week of our stay in Vegas I made sure to come back here as often as I could. The drive from my in laws place is about 5 minutes so YASSSS I went there everyday for 5 days straight until we sadly left :( Anywho I ventured out of just ordering my usual bubble drink and got to try the loco moco, cake noodles, malasadas, and the pork belly loco moco. Guys out of all the Hawai'i like eateries I've tried there in Vegas, I'd have to say that Boba Hut is the closest you'll get. Everything was delicious and although I can get them here easily in Hawaii, I seriously cannot wait to come back to Boba Hut and get my fixes. But for now, I'll be dreaming of here and counting down the days till we'll be back.",

Now that we're all graduated, we don't come anymore :-( I always ordered the Thai tea or the osmanthus oolong teaspresso with boba. The drinks were pretty good and the boba was good too. I did try their Hong Kong fried rice, the spam musubi, and the chicken Katsu. I found that they were very generous with the portions. The spam musubi was cooked fresh, and I seriously had to order a few every time I came.  The service was always consistent but it was always super busy. It kind of sucked having to stand around for your order and then having to leave elsewhere to enjoy your drink.",

We got the 2 drinks fairly fast and decided to sit down to wait for our food. Keep in mind we were the only 2 customers in the store. After 10 minutes another customer comes in and order, then after 10 more minutes one of the lady in the back brings the other customer 2 spam musubi's and said \"we had an extra one so you can have 2\". My wife decided to tell them we had ordered one and they replied \"ok, we'll make one right now\". All we can hear is the 2 young girls chatting and laughing. I've been there before, when you're young you just need a job to get you through school, but they've got to have some kind of respect and do their job that is paying them(though not a lot). After waiting for another 15minutes we decided to leave. I don't know how long it should take them to make 1 spam musubi, but I know it's not 30mins. Especially when the store is empty.",

    "text": "Had lunch at Boba Hut a couple of weeks ago because I was hearing a lot of good things. And i have to agree that it is good Chinese restaurant with some Hawaii-style options.  I do want to start with that I grew up in HI and so when I'm searching for comfort food, I want what I had from the manapua truck or working in Honolulu. So I'm not being snooty about this, but if someone from HI is reading this, I just want to set realistic expectations.  I ordered chow fun which was typical of a Chinese restaurant, good, but not Hawaiian-style where you have the fish cake and char siu in it. I also had the crispy gau gee which was almost as good as the HI famous Waimalu Chop Suey, but not as thick.  While I was there, I loved the amount of order pick ups from Uber and GrubHub. So I know I'll be ordering from here because of the convenience.  FOR THE OWNER Hope the owner or management still reviews Yelp because I have some helpful information for you: 1. It may be because it was lunch time, but I do have to say that the wait time was a little too long. I thought it was me, but I timed how long it took a woman and her child to get their lunch and it was over 10-minutes. 2. Pork Hash in HI is a large pork shumai! I made a mistake once at another Chinese restaurant and ordered pork hash. When it came out, it was just ground pork. Needless to say, I was highly disappointed. So when I asked your counter-help, she confirmed that the Pork Hash plate you have listed is ground pork patty. I kindly let the counter-help know, that in HI, when someone orders Pork Hash, it is pork shumai that we expect.   If you can get the chow fun and the pork hash right, I would be so grateful.",

I like the texture of their boba as well, not too mushy! If you are here often like I am, then you should get a stamp card. I have tried a couple of food items from here.

Fortunately, this time around I was able to enjoy the food and boy, was it a splendid time.   Boba Hut is not only a fun play on words but an actual dining experience. Although it's touted as a boba shop, just like the utilitarian ways of most Vegas restaurants, they excel in many different culinary aspects.   The drinks themselves are great if you like the fruitful bouquets and flavors. Your choices are black or green tea with milk options. You can customize the sweetness of the drinks by percentage so if you don't like drinks too sweet or you're a sugar fairy you can get your sweet game on.   The food has personality too. The drunken noodles are absolutely fantastic! Think of a very good chow fun with a bit of zest and you'll love it. No added seasoning necessary. It slides warmly down your gullet and makes your insides feel like a welcoming Christmas fireplace. You can really taste the passion of cooking with this one dish which is also why it's a dangerous dish because if you eat it first it can make all the other dishes feel a bit bland. Loco Moco? Good stuff but you're not drunken noodle. Pork buns? Hi there. I'll eat you later when the taste of drunken noodles is gone. That's how good it is.   As far as service goes, they were friendly and very helpful. They knew we were on the fence about the sweet factor with our drinks and said if we don't like the way it comes out they will fix it. That's not just great service but a good attitude in life.   I know six months ago I was incredibly disappointed by this place. I expected so much and didn't even get a sample. But now that I've tried I can say I'll be glad to return.",

I ordered for pick up.  Got the small Loco Moco and the BBQ mixed plate.  My only critique is that I asked for double mac (instead of rice and mac) for my mixed plate as you can see by the receipt but they didn't give me double mac.  Not a big deal but it's attention to detail that keeps customers coming back.  I'll will be back because it's right up the street from my house.",

I did a quick yelp for places around the area and settled on this place. This was 3 days ago. I've eaten here 3 days in a row.  I ordered their Beef Chow Fun. It was delicious and authentic; so many places butcher it but this was one of the best ones I've had in a long time. There's so much meat and it's so tender. What was surprising was the affordable price. In Chinatown this dish will sell for $10.00 easy. But it's way cheaper here.  Next day I ordered their Saimin noodle soup and man oh man it was so delicious. A large helping of noodles in a perfectly flavored broth.   Today I had their drunken noodles. As expected, it was bomb as fuuuuuudge.  Every day I get the typical Boba Milk Tea, I'm a classic dude, but they've got wicked different combinations of different teas and add-ins for some Boba variety.  Their service was genuinely nice and cheerful and very good.  They're a new business and I wish them great success because the food is amazing and so affordable.  AND they close late. (Midnight)",

    "text": "If you love Loco Moco & Pork Belly, come here and get their Pork Belly Loco Moco. Super delicious flavors! Probably my favorite thing on the menu. Not a fan of their Mac salad.. Seemed watery, and wasn't well flavored like other mac salads I've tried. (Personally, L&L Hawaiian BBQ's Mac salad = still winning. :p)  My friends and I also tried the \"Pork Belly Onion Pancake\" and expected an actual pancake with pork belly stuffed inside. But what we got was just pork belly rolled up with what looked like a tortilla. Was kinda bummed about that so I ended up just eating the pork belly itself without the pancake. The \"onion pancake\" part of the appetizer did not taste like anything.. So I really just felt it was similar to a tortilla.  I love the fact that you can customize your drink to your liking. But I was being pretty basic my first visit and got a peach slush. Was just looking forward to their food. Probably will come back to have a customized drink to go with my pork belly loco moco!    *update* The food still takes a very long time to come out every time I've been here since my first visit.",

Had the house milk tea with boba, BBQ chicken noodle soup and chicken katsu. Lets just say I am picky when it comes to boba or any other food. I like right texture, taste, and etc.. With boba, if not make the right way it wont taste or chewy the right way how boba should be. Saying that, their boba was made perfectly and to the right consistency!  One thing special about this place is, that they ask you how sweet you want your drinks to be. So for those who don't drink much sugar or want alot of sugar in your drinks then here you go. I was not prepared for that but now I know for the next time lol The food was okay my sister's chicken katsu was good but my BBQ chicken noodle soup was little sweet. Should've gotten the HK style soup. But overall good place looks like a family operated. Will be visiting more often now I know where its located!",

My favorite boba is the \"Oreo Oolong Milk Tea\", the only boba I get and still my favorite. Ask them for less ice if you want more tea, that's what I usually order. This place location is nice since it's near my house and I would go there to study sometimes. The only flaw is that the tables are dirty and need to be cleaned after someone has ate there every time.",

I'll keep on looking for other restaurants, not here!  Oh yeah, the Kau Yuk was meh (over cooked and unrecognizable)!!!",

The only problem I had on my first drink was that it was a little bit too watery and I couldn't taste the oolongness of my drink. But my boyfriend ordered a thai tea, with boba, that was actually pretty good! I ended up just drinking his..  The second drink I got, was also oolong but I ordered it with no ice and @ 50% sweetness level. Again, the drink tasted too watery or what-not that made the taste of the oolong fade a little too much. (& They forgot that I had ordered no ice, but they corrected it YAY ty.) Then this time my boyfriend got the house milk tea @ 100% sweetness and it was reeeally good! The honeydew boba slush was eeeh.. I wouldn't order a slush here tbh. I think it's their teas are where it's at! Lol.  Other than that, I think I'll keep trying out more flavors and find the one I actually really like. I'm looking forward to going to this place a lot more, since it's a lot closer than china town boba places. & Looking forward to trying the food as well!",

Pudding tastes like it's made with dollar store flan and water. The food is just ok. The pork belly moco is better than the moco loco but the servings are so small for the price and adding a scoop of rice is $1.25! Just for rice? It also comes with a single scoop of macaroni salad which is extremely mushy--the pasta had no texture like it had been boiled 10 minutes longer than it should have been and it was swimming in flavorless mayo dressing. Highly disappointing.",

The osmanthus oolong is really good, as well, with some crystal boba. For the food, I highly recommend the pork belly loco moco. The aioli ties everything nice with the cut thick pork belly. You absolutely cannot go wrong with it. You can also mix your options, so I would also recommend the garlic shrimp. The only thing I didn't like was the spam musubi. Such a simple dish but can be done wrong so many ways. The spam and rice ratio was a little off and the sauce was nothing special. Other than that, the place is definitely worth the trip. The service was also excellent and the servers knew the menu very well.",

    "text": "Boba Hut specializes in Asian Fusion type dishes, with the main specialties being Hawaiian and Chinese food; however, the name of the place makes it known that they also specialize in tea and boba. They're also part of an expanding chain where a similar restaurant named Curry Hut has just opened in Vegas.   My cousin is a fan of their slushie type drinks and brought me one afternoon to give it a try, knowing that I enjoy boba. Boba Hut is located on Rainbow Blvd in a decent sized plaza around the corner from Dickie's BBQ.   They have Hawaiian plates (BBQ chicken, Kalua pork, Katsu), appetizers (potstickers, popcorn shrimp, French fries, etc.), Asian plates (Kung Pao chicken, fried rice, stir fry) as well as macaroni soups and burgers.   We all shared an order of the Drunken Noodles with chicken ($8.10) - beef costs an additional fifty-five cents. I thought the dish was pretty tasty. Very similar to the Asian \"beef chow fun noodles\". The dish was pretty large, served in a Styrofoam box that was able to feed four people. Not too oily and there was enough \"wok hei\" to give it that good flavor. Good amount of chicken - and adding Sriracha made it taste that much better. I would recommend trying this out.   As for the drinks - you can customize your drink by picking a base, flavor, sweetness level, and toppings OR you can choose from their specialty drinks, slushes, smoothies, etc. I went with a safe choice and tried their green milk tea with honey boba ($3.65). With the blender going off every other minute, it seemed like they really did produce quality drinks; however, when I tried my milk tea - it tasted incredibly bland. The color was not right and there was no flavor in the drink at all! It actually tasted like a watered down milk tea. I went to the counter and asked another worker if this was the green milk tea. She apologized and took my old one before reaching into the refrigerator and pulling out an already made green milk tea ... so they had messed up my order and had given me a boba milk tea instead. The new green milk tea did taste better than the first drink, but not by much. I don't think I have very high standards for tea, but the drink was pretty pricey yet the quality was subpar - I would put it below Quickly. Not much tea flavor - boba was cooked pretty well, but didn't get that \"honey\" to the boba either.   Maybe their slushes and smoothies are better choices. I saw a ton of people ordering those, and my cousin seemed to really enjoy his pineapple slush.   tl;dr - Would not recommend ordering any milk teas from this place. Maybe their other drinks are pretty good, but the milk tea and green milk tea were both pretty disappointing. Drunken noodles are not too bad, but I don't think I'd return to this place if I had the option.",

I've had both their specialty dark roast oolong and their osmanthus oolong teapresso hot with 50% sweetness. Perfect for this frigid Nevada weather right now! Now having moved here, I realized that I am a huge sucker for spam musubi and this place makes some pretty decent ones. I usually go with their spam and egg musubi option, but it seems like a lot of people on here are raving about the spam and candied bacon musubi (which I will try later with an updated review). Also, I loooove that they have a free delivery option that I can utilize for those lazy days. You got yourself a repeat customer, Boba Hut!",

I literally stood there for 7 min before she even acknowledged me! Now to be fair she wasn't ignoring me per se, she was paying attention to the 3 iPads that kept dinging. The iPads were the online orders for amazon, poshmark and ubereats (I think). She kept ringing those in while I just stood there. I'm not sure but to me in person customers should take precedence over an online iPad where the customer isn't even there. Moving on...  I ordered. The pork belly buns are amazing!!!! So good. Actually thinking about them now, LOL. Candy bacon spam masubi?!  It sounded so good when I read it on the menu. It was a bit sweet so I couldn't finish it all.

First time, I ordered off Postmates, the driver arrived and informed me my order had not even been prepared. So I had to cancel my order and file a claim to get my refund. Second time, they forgot three things off my order, which were all on the receipt. Idk what's going on but I won't be ordering boba hut off the app anymore which sucks because I don't live close so i won't be a frequent customer as I'd like to be.",

In both of my visits this place was pretty empty, and it's kind of hard to miss considering the size of the place.  I am absolutely in love with the design of the menu that they have and their logo. Keeping in mind that I saw their menu before I went to the store I was kind of really excited to see their decor and environment boba hut had to offer.  Basically I was too exited, because seemed like a half decorated shop.  On my first visit I had the oolong milk teapresso hot. The cashier had a hard time pronouncing the name, which  asked how to say because I was curious (lol) I was expecting a really strong tea flavor, but no. Not at all. Watered down oolong with ....watered down milk? The boba was also very mushy.   On my second visit I went with two other people and since some of my friends had said that their food was a lot better than their drinks (even though the place is called BOBA hut) I kept my hopes up. We all ended up ordering a lot of food.  Spam misubi Hawaiian bbq mix  Chicken katsu Drunken noodles Popcorn chicken  Most of the dishes came with rice and macaroni salad.   I guess the only thing that was \"worth it\" ended up being the spam, which I didn't even try.   I felt like most of the dishes were just overwhelming with strong flavors. Maybe it was garlic? Pepper? I don't know. But it overpowered all the food, covered up the taste of all the protein.  Along with the food we ordered the following drinks  Thai tea w/ popping boba 50% sweet Coffee milk tea w/ pudding  White grape oolong tea  I was disappointed in the Thai tea, maybe I should've gotten 100% sweetness  And the peach popping boba definitely did NOT component the drink (whoops, my bad choice)  The coffee milk tea was pretty good, nothing to rave about though.  And I think I liked the grape oolong best, even though it didn't taste like oolong.   Service was 5 stars, everyone was really nice  They came to our table about 4 times while we are to ask if everything was okay. I didn't enjoy anything that we got but I also didn't want to be rude. The cashier seemed very knowledgeable about the menu.  Better luck next time?",

Ordered our food at 8:55pm it's now 9:39pm and still waiting on our food, got a cheeseburger, hamburger steak and bbq chicken (not very time consuming things to make). Workers taking multiple grubhub orders from the tablet while lots of us in the dining area haven't gotten our food. Cmon boba hut...take care of us in the dining room first please!

When a boba joint also offers food, it doesn't mean their food alone, is worth coming for.   GMonkey do:  GAU GEE CAKE NOODLES- Gau Gee good but ran out of hot mustard sauce that must accompany it. Cake Noodles just crispy, not chewy in middle and watery gravy sucked  LOCO MOCO half Hamburger Steak half Pork Belly- spicy aioli entirely takes away the terrific taste of pork belly. Gravy has no taste, but Hamburger Steak is awesome!!!  That alone, carried this Loco Moco!     COFFEE MILK TEA- is okay, but why upcharge boba at boba hut??  GMonkey had high hopes for Cake Noodle at boba joint. Stoopid me. Great location next to school for disposable income and across from hospital for easy takeout. Otherwise, not worth my journey in search of local food.",

This place was delicious! Definitely the best pop in meal I've had in a really really long time! I had a Hawaiian slushy with popping mango and peach boba, and Gau Gee cake noodles!!!! My friend got the Pork Belly Loco Moco eggs over easy. Both of them were fantastic! Honestly I'm already thinking about what I'm gonna get next time... plus it's so close to my office!

The breading on the chicken katsu was soggy. There was no sauces for any of the meats. Lastly, the potstickers were just horrendous. Absolutely disgusting and I didn't know there was such thing as a \"bad potsticker.\" (Frozen potstickers are better!) I will never EVER order Boba Hut again. And no one else should either unless you're okay with below par food and a side of plastic.",

After about 30 mins I saw this place that said Hawaiian/Chinese mix and wasn't sure but clicked on the food photos. I was immediately interested. I called and ordered the pork belly loco moco, the orange chicken and the crab Rangoon. The crab Rangoon was perfectly crispy and the sauce was delightful with a unique flavor than most generic sauces that come with the dish. The orange chicken had good flavor I wouldn't say the best I have ever had, but would for sure get it again. Now to the main and most talked about on yelp the loco moco. I can not say I have ever had such a dish so it's hard to rate it. But I will say the flavor was delicious and  the large was a great portion. I am not a huge lover of chewing on huge chunks of fat so I cut most of that off. But all and in all it was good. I am actually really excited I know about this place now since i live right around the corner.",

First I asked the cashier lady which dish could be made fast, cause I need to be back at work at 1p, then she told me Hawaiian plates only took 5 min, and since I was the ONLY customer at the moment, my order was gonna be fast.  I tipped them $2 in advance, even just for a to go order and the plate only cost $7, cause I was planing to be a regular guest since they are close to my office. Now I regret.  I ordered it at 12:24, and then I waited till 12:40 to had my food. I saw the kitchen staffs are having their earphones on, listening to their music, chilling at work without realizing the need to get their work done on time. If they were keep busying, I wouldn't even be upset.  I'm giving them two stars because the food wasn't bad, but they really need to take their job serious.  They could just be honest and told me it's gonna take long, that way I can either come back for next meal or order through phone next time in advance, please don't tell me the wrong information just to keep me there.  I am truly disappointed.",

Their Laulau was on the little dry side but their Kalua Pig was ONO!! I'm happy I tried then again and I'm thankful they used a delivery service to deliver on the Strip!! Again, it was Yummy!  This is my first time here, I heard a lot of good things about this restaurant...I decided to give it a try.  I had the hamburger steak, it was ok...a little too much pepper for my taste.  I guess I will need to go back and try another dish... Hopefully I'll try some of there boba",

The cups are my favorite.. they upgraded their cups a short while ago and I now have an entire cabinet full of them lol There are options of sweetness if you're into the whole \"super sweet\" boba tea.. apparently they make food as well so on going to have to try something off of that menu... curry hut? Dont mind if I do..  One thing I didnt like about this place is I stood there for some time waiting to order because the one person kn the cash register answered the phone for a phone order. Perhaps someone else can answer the phone while the person at the front can take orders because I stood there a little longer than I wanted to just waiting to order.

Also one of the very few places that serves cake noodle in Vegas. The food, boba tea, and slushed have always been good.  I rated  because of the slow service. I ordered dine in and it took them 20 minutes to make my jasmine milk tea and 30 min for my food in an almost empty restaurant. In fact it disturbed me a little bit when a couple of other people come in and order and received their items 5-10min after. But mistakes happen probably. The staff was nice.   I'll come back in a month and see if it's the same. But in general, if you're looking for Hawaiian/Chinese fusion food... this is the place!",

    "text": "First time here, had the late night munchies after only a late breakfast and long day so we  ordered the pork belly loco moco with eggs over easy to share  ... it is a game changer! So good! I grew up in the islands so even the quality of the rice is important unlike some other \"hawaiian\" joints here whose rice isn't up to par (not the right sticky rice consistency, usually not sticky enough!). This place knows how to cook their rice!  the pork belly was so good and the addition of the spicy mayo like the kind used in sushi or poke is really nice.  I recommend using Door Dash to order for delivery or pick up. Order was ready quick! We picked up on the way home. If you haven't used Door Dash, take advantage of first time user discount and free delivery.  My friend wanted boba so he got the Oreo Oolong Milk Tea with boba, coffee jelly and egg pudding, 25% sweetened. He should have gone zero sweetened because it was pretty sweet probably because of the Oreo. He insisted on trying it. We're not huge sweet tooths but we love boba and like that they can adjust the sweetness. They don't have nut milk options  or sweetener options like Stevia like our fave Brew Tea spot. Would've preferred the regular boba over The Crystal boba balls which is more like a firm gelatin vs chewy and bouncy. But that's a personal preference. They don't skimp on  the ingredients though!   If you live in the SW and crave boba late and Kung Fu Tea and Brew Tea are closed, Boba Hut is opened on Fridays & Saturdays until midnight. Price is reasonable here and they open late. Want to try the Okonomiyaki Chicken Katsu next time!  I haven't been here often enough to give an extra star.",

My DoorDash driver actually picked up and delivered quickly but I feel DoorDash took a long time assigning someone to pick up my actual order, which isn't the restaurants fault, but I would've waited if my food was prepared a little later.   I ordered a small order and it was plenty of food. I couldn't even finish it all, especially since I had a huge Thai Tea in the side. The food was delicious for being cold. Also, I had to transfer the food from the container it came in to a plate because of all the condensation that was built up from my food sitting in the container. I'm so happy that when I opened it none of the liquid leaked on my food because it was at least 1/4 of a cup of water in the lid.   I would try this place again, but possibly in person.",

I highly reccomend the candied bacon musubi and the standard.  Lunch from the menu option I chose was the chicken Katsu. 10/10 delicious chicken fried and breaded perfectly.

Tried the Hawaiian slushie too which was very sweet but tasted very tropical and refreshing. :)   The bbq chicken Hong Kong style macaroni soup was surprisingly good. Nice and warming, a bit oily but delicious nonetheless. I liked the broth, noodles, and scallions more than I did the chicken though.   Such a good place for comfort food & delicious teas. Definitely try this place if you haven't already. Will be my go-to for awhile... dreaming of candied bacon spam musubi...",

I came in right when they opened so the boba wasn't ready, so i had my lychee with my house milk tea and not much of a difference from the other boba tea house.  Place was very clean and neat..just simple marble tables and woodedn chairs..not much of a decoration yet because they have just opened 2 weeks ago but i see a potential of them making good business in this neighborhood specially when the place is next to Durango High School.   Owner of the place was pretty young, haven't had the chance to talk to him about the place..Roldan is his name basing of the instagram they told me to follow.  A grand opening is happening on November 15th, they are giving free milk tea, a great way to start the place.  Overall, great place, excellent teas and perfect customer service, I will definitely recommend this place to my other Boba/Food critics :)",

WIth the weather recently, a hot milk tea was just a perfect way to end the day.  I always order my tea with 25% sugar level but it always turns out to be really sweet (I can only imagine the 100%). I might try ordering with 0% next time and see how that turns out.    The food here is pretty okay. I cannot totally speak for it altogether. I have not tried enough of their \"fusion\" food to judge it. We always ordered take out too. Even though, I believe that the quality of food should not suffer whether it be dine in or take outs - sometimes it just can't be helped. I will try eating there when I find the time.  I do love their Pork Belly Moco. It's very unique and very tasty. A little fatty but I sure that's what makes the dish taste that good. The chicken katsu is good too and so is their Pork Lau Lau and Kahlua Pork. I love Hawaiian food so I can be pretty bias.   I will definitely be back.",

It also went really well with my Jasmine Milk Teapresso! Not too sure what a teaspresso is but I asked for 75% sugar and it was the perfect sweet Jasmine flavor I was looking for.   I also had my friend's Osmanthus Oolong Tea and it was pretty good too although I prefer my Jasmine. Overall, this place has solid teas which is what I appreciate because nowadays, too many places taste like straight up syrup and that's not cool. It's also nice that you can adjust the sweetness.   And again, that crystal boba. This is a boba place I'll have to always visit every time I'm in Vegas!",

    "text": "So I've tried this place three times and each time has been disappointing. I usually don't like doing bad reviews and don't really come across places I feel like I need to write a bad review but I'm extremely dissatisfied after the third time of me trying them. The first time I ordered some sort of noodle cake which was ok, the sauce was flavorful but they were so hard and chewy that I could barely bite into them.   The second time I had my boyfriend pick up an order for me. I was on the phone with him as he ordered so I know that he ordered udon and what I got when he came home was not at all the same dish.  I actually have no idea what they really gave me so I can't tell you but it wasn't bad, it just wasn't for me and wasn't what I ordered.   That brings us to the third time. I ordered a simple salmon teriyaki bowl off post mates. I live pretty close to this place so they said it was a 25 to 30 minute wait. It took about an hour for them to deliver my food. I know it wasn't the delivery man it was the restaurant that took forever to prepare my food. When I got the food, it was much smaller than I expected and the salmon was so hard that it resembled more of the texture of chicken. I couldn't even eat it with a fork it was so over cooked. Maybe that's why the food took so long to make because they were busy fossilizing my salmon. Not only that, there was also virtually no teriyaki sauce, only A tiny bit on top of the piece of salmon and there was literally two tiny pieces of broccoli and three slices of cabbage over plain white rice. That is what I waited for for all this time? I would have made white rice at home if I knew that it was going to be like that instead of spending $13 altogether with delivery and tip.   I really wanted to like this place but I don't think that I will be ordering from them again.",

I love their customizable boba menu, especially that you can choose the sweetness level of your tea. They have a great variety of flavors and boba to choose from. When I asked a question about their lychee jelly the lady behind the counter really quickly offered me a sample. She had great recommendations based on their most popular drinks.   I tried the rose flavored green tea with lychee jelly and really loved it. 25% sweetness was perfect for me, but I have a crazy sweet tooth. If sugar isn't absolutely your thing, I would recommend 0%. (Definitely going to try 0 next time, will update this when I try it.)   I love that this place has a spot on their menu listing caffeine free drinks, and they have a surprising amount of options!",

I grew up in Hawaii, so I like to get my fix whenever I have the craving. The Hawaiian slush (with extra Li Hing Mui) is soooo good. I also really like their spam musubis. They're just a basic staple that I like to get there. And for dessert, you can't miss with those malasadas! All-around good food. A must-try.

The guy in front of me in line spoke with a very strong pigeon accent and the girl reminded me of so many of my friends from home: sweet, kinda and a huge smile. The brudda IZ was playing in the background  We ordered the Hawaiian barbecue combo, the Kalua pork and rice, and of course the cake noodle. Cake noodle comes with either option of minute chicken or beef. Broccoli comes with either option. I got the beef. The cake noodle was BOMB!!! I mean not as good as the ones in hawaii. But for being the ONLY ONLY ONLY place that makes it in Las Vegas, I know I will be eating this again. The BBQ plate was delish and the meat was cooked great: Combo of BBQ chicken, Kalbi and Shreaded Teri Beef. My hubby got the Kalua pork large plate: 2 scoops rice, 1 scoop mac salad, and lots of lots of kalua pork and cabbage- Def enough for 2 people. With a coupon from their flyer, we got 10 free malasadas- good but not as chewy as the ones from Lenoards. Still, fried  sugary goodness.  The only bad thing I have to say about this place is that the cake noodle did not have enough sauce even though I asked the girl before I left for lots of sauce. And the beef in the beef brocolli mixture was super super sweet. Regaurdless I still devoured the whole thing lol  Next time I need to try the boba. Sooo many options for hot/cold, black tea, oolong, green tea, peppermint tea. Boba has many flavors like honey, they have grass jellies and red bean as well as egg pudding. The drinks are around 3.50$ if u want milk tea of some sort, but the slushies which I love are an extra 0.50$. Why? Idk why? To blend my smoothie with some ice? Kinda absurd to me for an upcharge.  I will be back for the Cake noodle!!! And have been back at least 4x for the beef broccoli cake noodle.  Total tip: anything over 25% sweet is what would be considered \"normal\" at any other Asian boba place. So if you don't like sweet don't get over 25%",

The breakfast musubi is one of the best musubis I've had the candies bacon in it gave it a nice sweetness. And the pork gau gee was super crispy and in the inside was super juicy.

The chicken was fried to perfection and the orange beef was very tasty. We loved this dish. The other dish ordered was mango fried rice w/cashew and shredded dry pork. We were informed that they ran out of shredded pork, so we had Chinese sausage instead. The fried rice was lack of flavor and too moist. This is why I'm not giving 5 stars. We chose to dine in and their service really is 5 stars. This place has fairly extensive drink options. You definitely will find something you like. We will return in the future.",

When I go, I usually get Green Tea, with either Peach, Mango, or Watermelon, 75% or 100% sweetness, and I top it off with Honey Boba, Mango Jelly, or Egg Pudding. A minute or two after I sit down, my drink is quickly and politely served to me. I also went last night and it was my first time ordering their Loco Moco and I liked it because they cooked the egg just how I asked - over medium - and they are generous with the gravy. My favorite thing about Boba Hut is that all of their employees are really nice and communicate well with their customers. I only go at night on the weekends, but they always make my nights with their politeness and personalities.",

The flavor of the tea tasted like mixed taro-flavored powder and milk but the honey boba was just how I like it. I didn't finish the boba drink though. I'm not sure if it was just because it wasn't anything special or the fact that it came in a large size (one size for all drinks). I've had better milk teas but, maybe I'll be back to try their food and specialty drinks.",

After moving to Vegas, I've founded such a limited number of choices that I tried my best to convince myself that I no longer needed it in my life. But nope...I need it like I need water!  I was in the area and found this place on yelp. I needed to grab some food for dinner so I thought I would drop in to check it out. I ordered the Drunken Noodles, chicken katsu musubi, milk tea, and a strawberry smoothie. The strawberry smoothie was,  \"This is EPIC.\" The milk tea was perfect since you can adjust the sweetness and the girls that were working there were friendly and sweet. They made sure to follow up and ask how the drink was. Drunken Noodles were a little salty for my liking but that can always be adjusted! Oh and they had the perfect amount of kick!  I'm definitely coming back to support this shop!",

Any how super friendly service and super awesome drinks. I tried their new Cherry Blossom green tea with a 25% sweetness and it was perfect. The tea was very had a awesome floral but prominent tea flavor which I liked and the sweetness came mostly from the honey boba which was cooked perfectly.  The softness was great it was just sweet enough and chewy but not soggy or hard. All in all the tea had me so I really want to come back for their food item. Oh by the way they have malasadas! The price is great not a rip off like other places and oh if you come during HH 4-7pm you get a free topping.   Definitely a winner for a boba food joint!",

I wanted boba and she explained how they have different sweetness levels to cater to different people's tastes (LOVE IT!)   I got a Thai Tea boba with a 75% sweet level and their chow fun. The first time I tried their chow fun it was VERY SALTY but the other couple of times I ordered it after my first visit, the flavors were balanced really well. The boba was delicious, I really liked how I was able to be in control of my sweetness level to obtain my preferred drink taste. My boyfriend got a Pork Belly loco moco, portion wise it was small for the price stated but it tasted great! They also have stamp cards so just ask for one!",

For my Yelpers with kids, I saw that they have one high chair, so that's nice they accommodate little ones.  On their menu they offer levels of sweetness( 0-100)  of your tea/drink, toppings for your drink ( jelly, boba, etc), their appetizers, and Hawaiian food ( basic - I.E. Musubi, bowls, terri chicken, etc.). I ordered one food item, tried the crab rangoon. It was ok, kind of greasy. The inside had a mix of cream cheese and pineapple (maybe to give it that Hawaiian touch). If it wasn't for the service, I would give them 3 stars based on food, and drink was alright ( ordered the jasmine teaspreso, like a Jasmine milk tea ). I'll probably give them another try.",

There were no customers before me so it's unexplainable how it takes that long for an order. Also, FYI the people working here are not local or from Hawaii, but all Chinese. Not a racist thing, but simply stating the truth. The Chinese guy behind the counter was also giving me some hard looks.",

Google maps totally took me too far.  Though I already had my fav boba, I had to get one tonight since this place is more around my neighborhood.  If I truly like it, I can stop over here for my boba fix.  Love that they have the option of sweetness level for my boba.  So for boba. I chose the winter melon oolong with grass jelly.  I just took my first sip, ummmm, dude, yuuuuum!   As far as food goes, I like that they have photos of the menu items, but the menu is missing on the board.  I had to grab myself a to go menu to really take a look at what there was to offer. Idk if having a stamp card is a good idea.  Lol, means I'll be stamping it up a lot!  I did bookmark this place because I was intrigued by the candied spam musubi, so that was my appetizer.  Jesse and I split the chicken cake noodle and the pork chop rice plate.  For my daughter, she had the HK Mac soup.  We did eat here, the food took a bit long.   My cake noodle wasn't so bad.  Jesse really didn't like his pork chops.  I had a piece and I agreed.   It was over cooked and didn't have much flavor.   The soup, it pretty much a macaroni saimin with a piece of BBQ chicken in it.   Service was great,  but a bit of a miss on the food.  I'd give it another try to find their specialty.",

They have a wide variety of Boba drinks they also have food, I like the fact that you were able to customize your Boba drink to your liking and control how much sugar goes into it which for me is a huge plus.  The Boba itself tasted very good nice and refreshing on a warm day like today which was 86 a way better and healthier option then any soft drink.  Customer service was really good I receive my drink in a very timely manner and overall just a good Boba, and good experience.I will definitely stop here in the future.

I called after 45 min asking about an update and again the young girl who answered said \"oh sorry, were just now seeing your order\". The third time i ordered from this place, they didn't have one of the drinks i ordered so they have me a refund on my drink instead of calling me asking if i wanted something else. When i called to see about the refund, i asked if i can just switch the drink and the young girl says \"ummm i don't know\". Then i said \"can i just give you my card over the phone so you can charge me for another drink and send it with my original order, and again the young girl says \"ummm i don't really know what to do here, i don't know I'm sorry\".

The chairs were already upside down because floors probably just got mopped.    Aside from the usual flavors, what I found interesting was the customized concept.  You can pick from 4 different flavors of tea, then another flavor, then the kind of boba or jelly, then the percentage of sweetness...  you get the idea.  Or refer to the picture of the menu.  Anyway, whenever I'm confused or don't know what to order, I always ask the cashier what is the crowd favorite, and this place was no exception.  So in addition to my standard house milk tea, got the store favorite which according to cashier is the White Peach.  Ordered both with the standard honey boba at 75% sweetness.  Both drinks were amazingly good!  I could taste the \"teaness\" in both and whatever flavor they should be, and comes in a good size.  My only complaint is that there wasn't more boba in the cup and the fact that I didn't make use of the 10% off Yelp Check-in because once I'm in the store I forget all about offers.  Grrrrr..  Service was good and friendly.  Nice and clean atmosphere.",

My group enjoyed the Hawaiian slush with popping boba. The spam musubi and spam musubi w/egg was delicious and much better than most places in Vegas. They have a good amount of food selection with sizable portion to the price point.   A great place to pick up lunch or dinner with family and friends. It's like a combination of LnL Hawaiian BBQ and Tea Station in Chinatown. The atmosphere is open and spacious with basic tables and chairs.",

Which is always hard when you're hungry and have the courage to gamble. Their weakness is inconsistent cooking and quality. And their strength is the exact opposite. The pork belly moco and pork belly buns are excellent depending on the quality of pork belly you receive that day. My favorite is the orange beef. Crunchy beef with a good orange glaze and proper seasoning. Last time it did not taste fresh. We also ordered over the phone last time waited 20 min to go pick up and when we got there we had to wait another 20 min. I'm hoping they address the inconsistencies because I will be back. It is a great fusion restaurant with great variety.",

I waited 30 mins to get my food. So much for my lunch break. Finally back at my desk and I feel like the sauce lacks flavor. It's not something I'd order again. I don't even want to finish it.   The place itself is simple and nice. Avoid going after school is out as I was surrounded by young annoying teenagers. Not very relaxing at all.   The staff was sweet and super apologetic for what happened, even provided me with a card for a free drink. For the sake of fairness I'll go again.

My friend also had their wintermelon aka white gourd and it's the best one I've have in Vegas! Way better than the white gourd at Kung Fu imo.
