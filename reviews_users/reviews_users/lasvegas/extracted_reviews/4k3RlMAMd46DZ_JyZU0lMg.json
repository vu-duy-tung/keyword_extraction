One minor complaint is that the tamago was overdone. My only comparison with Monta, since I read that the two places shouldn't be compared food-wise, is that Sora is much roomier and there was no wait. We will be back!",

That bowl is the best I ever tasted and well it's not only packed with flavor, but with authentic flavor. Not just noodles drizzled in saracha sauce or spicy oil. It has it's own unique taste which is not comparable to other ramen places",

Let's support restaurants in the Valley that is worthy in saying in business.",

Although there is a warning that additional flavor can be added to the bowl, I've never been to a great ramen shop where any additional flavor has to be added to the base broth. If you end up here, definitely order the extra flavoring with your meal. I don't think I would come back here unless there were no other alternatives for a late dinner. If you are desperate for some ramen, hit up Monta down the street.",

I'm not a fan of miso based broth, but Sora's miso changed my perspective. It has a smooth and perhaps pork-like flavor. Too bad they do not have have Tonkatsu flavor. It is either Shio or Miso. Ordered the cha-siu Ramen. The pork slices are melt in your mouth tender infused with tasty fat. Prices IMO are on the high-side for a bowl of Ramen (I'm spoiled by Big Wong). The one thing that turned me off is that if I wanted extra green onions, they charge a $1.00.",

This time it was meeting up with great friends from high school in Japan for a much needed girls weekend.  Being that we grew up eating ramen picking it for lunch was a easy choice.  Ramen Sora serves up all broth type ramen froms shio, shoyu, tonkotsu and miso.  They state they serve Sapporo Ramen which is miso based.  It is def one of my fave broth flavor that I grew up eating in Japan including the instant kind by sapporo ichiban!  Obviously the toppings at each ramen house varies but typically a bowl of miso ramen is served with chashu, bean sprouts and corn.    Deluxe Sora Ramen ~ <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramen-sora-las-vegas?select=0vjKNr87LblVN2JuatKoTg#hCJU9RRGp3DKxDTlDB3YSA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/rame...</a>  You get to pick the broth choice and I decided to go with miso.  The bowl came out nice and hot.  Broth had a great flavor not salty as some can be.  Good ajitama. The chashu was nice and fatty and soft.  It was sliced on the thinner side but it was very good <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramen-sora-las-vegas?select=0vjKNr87LblVN2JuatKoTg#D-VllyZqgYKzpRSSEh7PBw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/rame...</a> The noodles were the yellow curly chijiri type.  It was cooked perfectly and not mushy.  They offer 2 bowl sizes (regular and large) and additional toppings are offered for a reasonable price.    Gyoza ~ <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramen-sora-las-vegas?select=0vjKNr87LblVN2JuatKoTg#eaaQo6H7y5Ob4t3j7ydoeg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/rame...</a> Fried up with a decent char.  The filling had a good flavor.  They have a premixed sauce so no guessing on the soy sauce to vinegar ratio.   Ramen Sora is located a few blocks away from Monta.  Driving by this place in the evening you might think they are closed due to the tinting they have on the window but rest assured they are open.  The single building is of decent size and a good number of tables however I felt they could have used the somewhat open space with another communal table.  Depending on the time you get there you will def have a wait as we did albeit a short one.    Eyes ~ Nice bowl of noodle goodness! Nose ~ Smells so good!. Ear ~ Happy chatting and eating. Mouth ~ So very very good!. Tummy ~ Satisfied!",

    "text": "Items Selected: Gyoza Spicy Miso Ramen Corn Butter Miso Ramen  Fancied by legions of fans around the world, and certainly seeing a renaissance in America that goes beyond the 25-cent cups commonly seen around college dorms, Ramen Noodles have never really held much interest to someone that really does not love soups with clear broth, but attempting to understand a trend that generates lines in America and Michelin Stars overseas it was with a friend that Ramen Sora was visited for 6 o'clock dinner, the small shop on Spring Mountain supposedly Las Vegas' best.  Small and dingy on the outside, the sort of place passers-by could easily blink and miss, Ramen Sora cites its Sapporo heritage with signage at the door and once inside the scene brightens substantially, several tables laid out with good spacing while pop-music chimes over the din of the crowd.  Smallish in menu, a few appetizers joining soups in one of three styles of broth, those arriving during peak hours should expect a short wait, the staff friendly and efficient with bowls emerging from the kitchen at a relatively rapid rate.  Opting for water and tea service, a few alcoholic selections also available to those choosing to imbibe, it was mere minutes after orders were placed before five pan-seared potstickers landed on the table, a ground chicken filling nicely textured and exceedingly juicy with a sesame based sauce served alongside for those desiring an extra bit of umami.  Onward to the soups, noodles of the pre-packaged variety and thus no different than anywhere else, it was at the advice of our waitress that the 'signature' miso soup was selected for both bowls instead of Shoyu or Shio and with a description of 'creamy' the pork infused broth was indeed rich, the spicy beef addition leaving a tingle on the lips while a small knob of butter added even more depth to the corn studded version that trended ever so slightly sweet.  Happy to see an egg and shoots added for texture, the noodles springy but rather redundant bite-after-bite, it perhaps should have been a sign when the table adjacent added several pieces of Chasu to their four-person order, the four bites of pork belly included in our bowls easily the most memorable part of the meal and so tender that it almost melts on the tongue.  ***Potentially underrated by someone whose basis of comparison consists of less than a handful of noodle houses to date, it is simply difficult to get excited for something based on pre-packaged starch and pork broth served in a gigantic portion no matter how good, a menu with more options or at least more room for customization potentially something I could grow to understand and maybe even love.",

Mind you it's a hole in the wall kind of establishment with minimal seating so you should definitely expect a wait. I believe my friends and I waited roughly 45 minutes for a table for 6. This was our first time here so we didn't really expect to wait THAT long. Our waitress didn't really stand out as friendly or rude, she answered our questions, gave recommendations and brought our food out promptly. This is probably my second time eating ramen so I am not familiar with the serving sizes but I felt there could have been more noodles. Their broth is good though! Overall, I may have to try a few more ramen places to really get a feel for portions, service etc but try it and judge for yourself.",

    "text": "For Ramen, this is THE place for it in Vegas.  There are no better alternatives.  In a small cream color building, they really decor the place quite well, it really had a Japanese ramen cart feel to it.  They are located on Spring Mountain Road within blocks of Chinatown.    We had some Seared Chashu for starter, they were excellent with a perfect balance in tender and crisp.  They serve Hakata style ramen, even though Tonkotsu was originated from that region, we were in the mood to try something else.  For the daring souls such as myself, you cannot go wrong with the Killer Spicy Shoyu Ramen.  The broth and spices just go so well together, and the level of heat was at the right level for me.  We also had a bowl of Deluxe Miso Ramen, and the miso broth was quite tasty as well.  Their chashu was quite big compare to other ramen joints I visited.   Ramen Sora, most likely the only place I know for sure that I can get a nice bowl of ramen in Vegas.  The server was excellent, and their tables turn over so fast, there were already a few groups waiting at the door after we were done eating.",

    "text": "Full disclosure: this was my first time at a ramen restaurant and I am by no means a ramen expert.    I might just not have a 'sophisticated' enough palate, but I found my ramen dish to be so, so gross. I took one bite and would not eat any more. I got the corn butter ramen with the shio base, and the main note in the aroma was reminiscent of just straight hot cat pee. I was gagging before I took one bite of noodle, but in the interest of being, you know, brave and well rounded and all that, I was committed to trying at least one bite of noodle. I found the noodles to be gummy/tacky and almost stale tasting.   My husband, on the other hand, hand the shoyu base and he thought his was excellent.   Other reviewers commented that the service was rude - we didn't find that at all. It's a very, very small restaurant and the turn tables quickly so don't go here expecting to have a nice leisurely meal. They put menus and instructions right up front, and the idea is that you should be ready to order immediate upon being seated. They ask you three rapid-fire questions and then they're gone so read the menu and instructions up front and be prepared.   I am going with 3 stars to split the difference between my 1 and my husband's 5 star opinions.",

Monta's soup is too salty and thick. Fukumimi is too plain.  Some nights, Ramen Sora can get so busy and depending on the size of your group, sometimes you end up waiting for almost an hour. The plus side is that once you order, you get your food in less than 10 minutes.   Ordering the regular size keeps you satisfied. Get the large or super size if you're REALLY hungry.   Service is okay. They're not rude, but not super friendly/helpful.",

The broth is made with bamboo shoots and the taste and smell is quiet unique, I would describe it as \"dirty clothes smell\". I'm sure lots of people love it but I couldn't eat it. We asked to taste broth without bamboo and they were nice to give it to me to try it. After tasting broth and a little of their Shio sauce (salt) my face started numbing up and I found out they added msg for taste. So peers, if you are allergic to msg, stay away! We also ordered gyoza for appetizer and it tasted great. Overall, this place is dirty considering its Japanese and should be impeccably clean. The service is very slow, didn't get even one water refill and had to ask for napkins at the cashier counter.",

The building isn't very inviting, but that's to be expected in Chinatown. The inside was decent but can get quite loud if there are a lot of people with such a confined space.  The ramen itself, I thought, was very bland and lacking flavor. I didn't like not having the option of different noodles as is with many other ramen houses.  I really wish they would offer the garlic and pickled ginger on the table as well.   As far as service, not too bad.  After we were done eating, no one came to check on us or bring our check so I had to go retrieve it after about 15 minutes. Other than that, they were friendly and had no problems with the order.   All in all, we tried it but probably won't be going back. There are too many other ramen houses to try.",

Overall, it was a decent meal and not overpriced.",

Literally....they all shout out a greeting in Japanese! :) There aren't very many tables, so luckily we went during an off time, but even so, they were still at half capacity by the time we left.  I enjoyed their Delux Miso Ramen, and the bf had the Butter Corn ramen. I normally just order the tonkotsu, or super pork ramen at most other places. This place uses tonkotsu as a base, but you have a choice of Miso, Shoyu (soy sauce), or Shio (salt) flavored broth. The pork flavor still comes through, but with delicate miso overtones. I think I will try Shio next time, just because I really enjoy pork flavor, but this was delicious. The pork was melt-in-your-mouth tender. The butter corn ramen was very good too. It really tastes like sweet buttered corn! :)The portion size is generous as well. Its not the biggest bowl of ramen I've ever had, but hey.....sometimes bigger really isn't always better! The broth is rich and decadent, so it was the perfect amount. (And I'm a BIG eater!)  I will definitely be back next time I'm in town. :)",

It must be dry n hard to chew. I dont think I'm gonna like it. I ate the first bite of the chasu. Wow!!! The chasu so soft and not even dry n hard as what I thought.   I also ordered their chasu bowl.  I have the same thought as i saw their chasu cut in a big chuncks of pork and the color so dark. I took the very little chunck of chasu that i could saw to give it a try. Oisy!!! Very tasty!!! It's super soft and melt in my mouth.  I missed the broth. Their pork broth is very good. I would say it similar with daikokuya. Their broth is not smell at all even though so thick of koteri.  Over all, what can you say? Ramen is all about the broth, the noodle and the chasu. This place is great!! Helping me if I'm home sick of LA's ramen.",

I am by no means an expert connoisseur, but it's the new top pick on my short list of Ramen places in Vegas.  The restaurant is cozy and bright.  It was very busy at lunch time on a Saturday(and probably always is).  I was by myself, so I was set at a big table with other single diners and couples.  I had the miso ramen and a melon cream soda.  The ramen broth was hearty and perfect.  Full of flavor, and not greasy or too thin.  They offer larger portion sizes, but the regular size was more than enough for me.  I walked out fat and happy.  As for the soda, it is better than it sounds.  I don't even like honeydew melon, but I wanted to try something different.  It was really good and refreshing.  I thought it paired really well with the taste of the ramen.  Melon and cream, who knew!?  If you find yourself in China town and want some hot, filling, well-prepared delicious food for around 10 bucks, you can't go wrong with Ramen Sora.",

Jan 1, 2017 * 7:12pm my elderly mother, 2 elderly aunts, myself and my fiance arrive at the crowded restaurant on a very cold and windy night. Wrote our name on the waitlist and waited in a very confined space, blocking exits and clearly in violation of fire escape routes.  * 7:32pm finally was able to speak to the hostess about estimated time of wait, said it would be 30-45 from our arrival time.  * 7:58 still waiting, my mom and aunts were cold and hungry, I had my fiance order a soft drink for them to share while we waited (our party was next to be seated) and they made him pay for the drink rather than start the dinner tab * 8:11 finally seated after nearly an hour. Had the hostess take our order right away bc we were not going to wait for them to come back later.  * 8:17 server brought our water to the table * 8:48 still no food yet, no water refill, the server came to tell us our food will be coming soon. She told us the cause for delay was that they ran out of miso and had to cook a fresh batch. Aren't you a ramen restaurant??? On a busy night, shouldn't there be another batch ready at all times? * 9:06 food finally arrives: Miso Ramen, Spicy Miso Ramen, and 3 Nori Miso Ramen. The food was delicious, fresh miso tasted amazing, but at this point, my family was so miserable from the long wait. No one was happy.  * 9:08 had to go up to the counter to refill my aunt's water myself.  * 9:12 finally get a visit from the server to ask if everything's ok. It's so moot by now, I just nodded my head so she would go away.  * 9:15 my fiance walks up, pays the bill, and we leave shortly after. The plan was to eat and then hit the casinos afterward, but after the exhausting wait, party plans were canceled and we came back tired, grumpy, and miserable. This restaurant ruined our only evening of our short one-night LV trip.   In summation, this establishment has been chopped.",

    "text": "Another good Ramen shop in Vegas!  I love it.  As many have mentioned, Ramen Sora is on a par with Monta Ramen.  The shop is easy to find and is spacious... though part of this spaciousness comes not from the actual square footage of the shop, but because the interrior is designed in such a way that there is considerable open (and wasted space in the middle.  One thing that Monta had going for it is the variety if menu items other than Ramen, like Cha-han (fried rice), etc. But when it comes to Ramen, I think that Ramen Sora rises above Monta.  My wife and I went on a Monday afternoon, around 2 pm. There was no long wait list, though by 2:40 pm, there was 4 or 5 groups waiting for seats. Once seated, and order taken, the food came out quickly. I ordered the signature Deluxe Sora Ramen, Miso flavor, and my wife had the Shoyu Ramen.  What I think sets Sora above Monta for me is the broth.  The broth at Sora is not too salty, gentle, yet complex flavor. My tonkotsu miso broth had very gentle flavors, with almost a peanutty aroma. I was able to finish the whole broth without feeling it being too salty. My wife's Shoyu broth was the same way. You could taste the pork bone broth, hint of shoyu, a bit of sweetness and some herbs.  Very nice.  I find Monta's broth to be too salty at times.  The tonkotsu broth at Sora is on the very light (not thick) kind which is very refreshing.  The noodle is medium thick wavy noodle with sufficient chweyness.  I give it a 10 out of 10.  The cha-shu is melt in your mouth tender, though this is where I felt a bit excess of saltiness. Still very very good.  We also had the gyoza which is very good also. Tender filling, lots of juice, and again, not too salty... in fact you could really taste the sweetness...   All in all I think that Sora may be my new favorite ramen shop in Vegas.",

    "text": "**Summary**        - Ramen - Their ramen is a bit thicker than your average ramen. It's suppose to be an original recipe from Saporro Japan.        - Flavor - Their barbecued pork is unrivaled in its tastiness. Since practically everything on the menu includes it, you'll probably try it in one of their dishes.        - Saltiness - All the dishes were a little too salty for me, but all the good ramen places in Vegas seem super salty. With that said, it's less salty than Monta, which was my previous ramen place.        - Super size - You can order a large version of the ramen bowls for $1 more. **Ramen**        - I got a bit confused with the menu when I first looked at it, so here's my explanation of the ramen.        - Two things main things make up the base. One is pork and the other you have a choice of Miso or Shio (Salt).        - They all come with half an egg, one piece of pork, and menma (bamboo shoots).           - Chashu Ramen has 2 extra pork pieces.           - Menma Ramen has extra menma.           - Spicy Ramen has a ground meat/Rayu (Chili oil) sauce scoop added in to be mixed around. It's not spicy at all. Taco bell mild sauce is spicier.           - Corn Butter ramen had corn and a slice of butter added.           - Nori Ramen has seaweed added to the side.           - Negi Ramen has a piece of fish replacing the pork.           - Deluxe Sora Ramen has 2 extra pork pieces and nori (seaweed) added. **Ordered**        - $10.00 Deluxe Shio Ramen (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg?select=bs_GyeafgqHE1QlNfTP69g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/4k3R...</a>)        - $8.50 Spicy Miso Ramen (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg?select=J6COHikJJ6CviUN8mzSoiA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/4k3R...</a>)               - Soup - Both soups are slow-cooked in pork bones. You can see the pork oil floating in the soup. It really adds a deliciously meaty flavor to the soup.               - Miso - The miso soup is thicker and heartier than the shio.                - Shio (Salt) - I much preferred the shio soup. The consistency is less thick and the flavor a lot more clean.               - Chashu (barbecued) - The meat literally falls apart it's very tender and the pork is literally a flavor bomb.        - $2.85 Mini Chashu or Chashu Curry Bowl (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4k3RlMAMd46DZ_JyZU0lMg?select=OWti3brKP7toeyxM1L0XGg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/4k3R...</a>)               - Mini Chashu Bowl - Their signature chashu pork on rice. Out of the soup, it really allows you to taste the full flavor of the meat, though it's a smidge saltier than in the soups. Even though meat the rice ratio was a little lacking, it makes for a delicious snack.               - Mini Chashu Curry Bowl - The chashu pork in curry over rice. The serving of meat is less due to the curry. The curry is so-so and a bit salty. Added with everything else, I think it's a bit too much. I'd prefer the regular Chashu Bowl. **Recommendations**        - I'd recommend this place for a nice authentic ramen restaurant.",

    "text": "Thank goddess a decent ramenhouse has opened in Vegas. I used to live in Cali and went for ramen several times a week (yes, I am an addict). I'm very picky about the quality of my ramen, and Monta, Shuseki, Ichiza, etc. just don't cut it. (Personally, I think Monta is highly overrated. I gave it at least 5 visits to make sure, and it still does nothing for me. But that's for another review.)  Finally Vegas has something that lives up to the better places in California. I would rank it in my top five ramens, having explored San Francisco, San Mateo, San Jose, Santa Monica and Los Angeles.   Like any typical ramenhouse, Sora's space is limited. Most likely you'll have to wait for a table, and they don't take reservations. Your best bets are to come either early or late into the peak dining hours. But please don't go right before closing. If you've ever waited tables, you know how annoying this is, especially when these latecomers assume they can hang out for hours after closing time when all the chairs are put up and floor mopped. And then tip 10%. But I digress.  On opening night, we ordered the fried rice with special sauce, an interesting combination. The special sauce was a thick, opaque cornstarch-ladden concoction, a little salty and tinged with chopped scallions. It somewhat reminded me of the more rural Japanese breakfast noodles dipped in \"slime.\" If you're not into this type of texture, then steer clear away from the special sauce. Overall, it gave an interesting contrast to the savory fried rice and pickled ginger (the red slivered kind, not the sweeter sushi kind).   The gyoza was decent, nicely crispy bottoms with a chewy skin. But what blew me away was their homemade dipping sauce. I haven't had this good a sauce in so long. It was a perfect balance of soy sauce, sesame oil, vinegar, garlic. I couldn't get enough.   My entire table ordered miso, half of us the spicy version. I do agree with other reviewers that the spicy was not very, but it did have that little extra karamiso kick prevalent at some other ramenhouses. No need to supplement with a side of kimchi here (which they don't offer on the menu anyway). The broth was succulent, rich and oh-so flavorful with bits of fat dotting the bowl. Oftentimes the richer the broth, the less they tend to give you, and Ramen Sora makes no exception in that. Personally I would prefer just another half-to-one more ladle of broth, but what they DO serve you will be pretty sufficient for most people.  One of the highlights of my heaven-in-a-bowl was the chashu. Thick cut and hearty, yet so tender it almost disintegrates in your chopsticks -- let alone melt in your mouth. You can tell the pork has been well-cooked for a good length of time, letting the fat render into the succulent meat itself.  The noodles are the other highlight. Thick, hearty, perfectly-cooked...in a word: amazing. Ramen Sora's noodles are deliciously chewy, making a nice mouthful after mouthful.   (One of the most disappointing things about MONTA is their style of noodle. Admittedly, this is just my opinion, but I do not care for their sliver-thin wimpy noodles. They hold no flavor, and the texture reminds me of oversoaked bean thread.)  The servers are friendly and attentive, and I'm was quite shocked at how slammed they were on opening day. Word of ramen travels fast anywhere you go.  I stopped by after work today to get a couple orders to take home. Not surprisingly, I was their very first take-out order. I was amused to watch them explore how to pack their wonderful ramen for travel. Unfortunately, because the eggs are only parboiled/partially cooked and are meant to complete cooking when served in broth, they weren't able to supply me with egg. I asked if they could give me a fully-boiled egg, but the chef wasn't able to at this time. No biggie. Instead, I opted for extra menma (fermented bamboo) because I love the flavor and \"chewy\" crunch. I'm sure they'll work out this small detail in the future.   The noodles held up well hours later, as well as a stovetop reheating of the broth. The flavors were all there, and at home I can slurp in comfort!  Some will come to Sora and knock it down because they're only familiar with Monta. Others will become complete converts. Whatever your preference, I still highly recommend you give all styles of ramen a try. It is diversity that makes life interesting after all, isn't it?",

    "text": "Finally a good ramen shop in Las Vegas!  I've been to every Japanese style restaurant that serves ramen in this town from junk (Anime Ramen is just so gross) and the Ramen Yokohama Kaigenro use to have. Right now this is by far my favorite ramen that I can get in Las Vegas. This place has the best ramen, seriously. Great portions and for a $1 more you can get a large size that goes a long way in the end.  Things I would recommend to anyone are : Curry Bowl Chashu bowl Gyoza Shio Ramen Miso Ramen  Though to be honest with everyone, I would stay away from the fried rice. It's very bland and a little greasy .  In the opening week I went here twice, so this place is going to become a regular spot for this ramen fanatic.",

    "text": "Hooray! Another ramen-ya in the valley! So after much anticipation, I finally got the opportunity to try this place going home from the airport.  The menu is relatively simple, they offer all the ramen staples: miso, shio, shoyu. There are specialty bowls of ramen such as negi or nori, spicy, deluxe, chasu, etc. Finally, you can order extra negi, or nori, or noodles. I did say relatively simple didn't I? Anyway, if at anytime you have a question the waitstaff is very patient and will gladly help you order.  I opted for a regular sized bowl of negi ramen. When she took my order, the waitress also asked me if I wanted extra noodles, that way she could time the cooking so they would be ready when I finished the noodles in my original order. I declined, but I thought that was a very nice touch. My order came with a slice of fatty, melt-in-your mouth chasu, half a soft boiled egg, and a large pile of negi!  The noodles were cooked nicely, they had absorbed some of the broth but still remained chewy. The broth was not too salty and was very rich, heavy, and a bit oily. That is my only complaint and it's a personal one. Considering this ramen chain originated in northern Japan, the heavier soup makes sense. I can definitely see myself craving this place on the cold autumn and winter nights, but not so sure during the summer time. Who knows, maybe they will come out with a special tsukemen at that time. Let's hope so!",

    "text": "As I pulled into the parking lot 5 mins after opening, I saw 4 other Asian cars parking so I quickly parked without paying attention to if I was anywhere within the lines (holding True for my  bad Asian drivers) and bum rushed quickly inside.  Within minutes the place was packed with several parties waiting. We may have been the only non Jap party there.  The ramen offers miso or shio soup - no tonkatsu but they do offer a spicy option. We ordered the Delux Shio Ramen which came with 3 pieces of chashu, egg, manma, nori, and chives. In addition we ordered the Spicy Miso.  The noodles were perfectly cooked al dente and had the perfect bite.  The noodles are similar to the texture of the Miso Ramen at Monta, not the thinner noodles from their Tonkatsu. I ordered both broths to see if they offered more noodle selections but it seems they offer one. Nevertheless I prefer thick cut.  Both of the broths were super rich and full of flavor.   The kurogoma dango dessert was decent - u could tell it was made at least a day in advance. With the consistent flow of business, maybe they can make it fresh daily and it would def be better.   So is it better than Monta? I would say no but I always order the Tonkatsu and enjoy the intimacy and atmosphere. But it's definitely a competitor and I'm all for more ramen offerings!",

    "text": "My 2nd visit here in a week.  So I was there about 12:15pm, and the parking lot was 75% full.  Fortunately I was able to be seated with no waiting, but the place was pretty much full.  This time, I tried Spicy Shio with extra green onions and gyoza.    Gyoza:  pretty good.  But I would have to give this gyoza battle to Monta.  It's very possible they Sora will get better as they have been open only a week, but Monta's gyoza had more flavor and juice.    Shio ramen:  I'm not a big fan of shio ramen, but I have to admit that this was pretty good.  simple, not oily, with some of the tonkotsu flavor coming through.  Spicy Shio is a weird concept as it makes it somewhat spicier and fattier, which is somewhat like ordering a veggie burger with extra cheese.  I  think I'd stick with Miso personally, but I do like their noodle.  Al dente, slightly chewier than Monta's miso ramen noodle, and wavier.   I think  it is more like a traditional miso ramen noodle from sapporo.  People who are not fond of heavy, kotteri type broth will probably prefer shio ramen.  Not me.    Service:  today they had a one Chinese lady waiting the table, and other two were Japanese.  This is somewhat disappointing for an authentic ramen house, but it's not that big of a deal as the menu is short and simple.  However, the service seemed to be faster today.  Perhaps they are getting used to it after the opening week.    As I was leaving, there were a few people waiting to be seated and the parking lot was full.  There is plenty of space to put in a few tables, and I really think that they need a counter space as all authentic ramen houses should have.  I'm just surprised at how quickly the word has spread and so many people have discovered this place.    It's hard to say who is better:  monta vs Sora, but I'd go to Monta if I\"m feeling for tonkotsu, and Sora if I'm in the mood for miso.    There are no other Japanese ramen house that come close to these two.  If you disagree, please keep going to the place where you get served by faux anime characters.",

We had previously like Monta but it was closed for some reasons so Ramen Sora is a great option.  My sister had their miso and thought was just OK.  Their spicy fried rice was quite spicy.

Do not charge the premium for an extra large bowl if you are not going to serve the extra large portion. Very disappointed to come home with 1/2 the food I happily paid for. The serving was easily less than a regular sized bowl that dine-in customers would receive.   Additionally, do not put your business phone on do not disturb mode. It is incredibly unprofessional to talk to someone in the restaurant earlier in the day to only receive busy signal for 30+ minutes trying to place an order. The only reason I came into the restaurant to place the order was because it was my fathers 50th birthday and this is his favorite restaurant.   I've only ever eaten in the restaurant before and it has always been a 5/5 experience. Tonight, not so much.",

Parking is located in their small private parking lot or on the street.  Ramen Sora is a great place to go with less wait and super yummy ramen.  The pork bone miso soup is very rich but it's not too salty. It was by far the best pork bone soup I have ever had.   The ramen noodles was cooked perfectly and chewy too.   We also ordered the fried rice with shredded chasu pork.  The fried rice had the right amount of flavor and not over cooked where the rice had a soggy texture.  Service was attentive and nice.   Overall, we had a wonderful experience and plan to come back here again.",

She is from Japan and she only live here for less than a year. Still, she chose this place above any ramen joint. By the way, my favorite ramen joint is this place and fukumimi. Just my opinion.",

It's about 15 minutes from the Las Vegas strip and it's the perfect place to eat regardless if you are hungover or not. I would recommend the miso ramen base. I don't have any other ramen places to compare to in Vegas but I can compare to places in Southern California and Oahu and I must say the ramen is pretty damn good for a fair price. It's not the very best I've had but it is still very good.  We came in on a Saturday night and our group of ten (yes TEN!) were quickly seated. Our waiter was very kind and brought us all waters and at the very end, split our checks without us even asking! I was surprised and amazed. Great service and great food.

The restaurant is small but their service is extremely quick. This is more of an in-and-out kind of place. People come in, eat and leave within half an hour to 45 minutes max at this place. Their spicy miso ramen is to die for. The noodles are fresh, toppings are delicious and the broth flavor is bold and flavorful. If you like very spicy food, try their killer spicy ramen, just make sure you have a glass of milk with it. I like spicy food but their normal spicy ramen is already pretty darn spicy in my opinion. They do not have a big menu; but whatever they do make, they make them well here. My husband is not that familiar with Asian food but I took him here once and he's hooked. We will absolutely and definitely come back for more delicious ramen at Ramen Sora. No Ramen No Life!!!",

Food came out fairly quickly.  On to the food. We started with the osumami platter, which didn't have any flavors that stood out. Chashu was well made though. Melt in your mouth good combined with a smidgen of char. The Ramen was a situational type of food for me. The broth is very thick, so you're in a bind trying to reach the bottom of the bowl. While the first few bites are good, the next few bites get really heavy. Perfect for a cold winter night or even a sick day, but you'll definitely feel fatigued eating this in the summer. To balance out the heaviness, I added a bit of curry to my broth. DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE the aroma and the balance that the curry provides. It is an excellent pairing.  Overall: Good Will eat again!",

Im not a big fan of the spicy meat they put in since its a bit bland. However, once mixed, it was okay. I think the deluxe is a lot better. The meat i prefer to eat is the katsu. Their katsu has a bit of fat in there so it puts the review back by one star. The broth is a bit more salty than usual. However, overall the ramen was good!   Another reason why i put this a 4/5 is because the waiter never came by to refill my tea or water. This place is so packed that you barely get service. The waiters that did come by were very rude when spoken to. When we asked to split the check, she gave us an attitude and was like: im not sure what you guys want! Who ate what?!  And im just like: im sitting right next to you, you dont need to yell. I know this place is loud but im not deaf...  And the way she asked everything was like excuse me?  The old servers were much",

We all got their number 1 which came with 3 pieces of chasu (pork), 3 pieces of seaweed, some bamboo shoots and half an egg. We all got different broths. They have salt, soy sauce and a miso broth. What I like about this place is that you can ask for light broth, which makes it less salty. I don't usually eat ramen because I don't like salty things but their salt broth (less flavor/salt) was perfect! I thought the noodles were perfectly cooked. However, while they gave us enough meat, the pork I felt was a bit tough. It wasn't as soft as I'd like.  Our server was friendly but she got too busy to check up on us after we got our food and didn't stop by until after we finished everything. My friend went to the cashier to put in an order to go. For 2 regular number 1s & 2 large number 1s, the total came out to be $45 before tip.    I prefer this place over monta ramen! The broth here is definitely better and the meat to noodle ratio is perfect IMO.",

I typically go with miso since i feel like it'll have the most flavor.  i was able to sample the button corn ramen and the deluxe sora ramen. both are good, and are distinct.  they also don't skimp out on the meats... which i find really surprising.   they also have small rice plates if you're a fatass like myself.    lines can be a little long during lunch as some people prefer to eat/drink ramen after a night of drinking to cure their hangovers.    one of my friends told me this...when you get older, you go to vegas to grub and not to club.  lol, so True.",

This time around I figured we venture out to somewhere new and remembered that Sora was just around the corner from us.   Nice and quaint, probably reminiscent of a low key Japanese pub (at least of what i've seen in televised visits by Anthony Bourdain) and maybe a tad bit bigger than Monta.   The menu was short and simple, you can start off with the basics and add a la carte, or just pick from a bunch of named bowls. The 'Screaming for Vengeance' had my eye, but (sorry for this) having 'firebutt' later on in the night in 100 degree plus weather didn't seem like a great time. The spicy ramen with the miso would suffice.   The ramen was nicely textured, had a great bite and picked up the flavors of the ramen nicely. The broth had a nice spice to it. While the waitress kindly nodded as to how spicy the Vengeance might have been, I'd definitely try it next time. Otherwise, perfect balance and wasn't overpowering. It was great, cause it was super warm inside, slurping along side the many other ramen enthusiasts. This place was among the best we've had anywhere.   Maybe the only thing I regret was not ordering the large. The regular was definitely smaller than I've seen for that size, but that's probs because they want you to order two, or get out so they can usher in the next crowd. Either way, can't miss!",

    "text": "First time trying Ramen Sora after a recommendation from a friend. The taste of the broth was well balanced. The noodles had great texture and didn't happen to be too chewy or such. Chashu was also expertly prepared, but there was one issue with the whole meal. There were very discernible differences between the temperatures of each item. An example I could provide is that when I took a bite from the egg, it was as cold as my ice water. Anything touching the egg was also effected, but the noodles were really hot. I can tell that the noodles were cooked, then the broth was added and everything else too which were prepared beforehand. This could also be due to the fact that I came in during the last couple hours before closing so I speculate they were just trying to close up shop soon. Overall, the bowl of ramen, excluding these deficiencies, was well made. Thank you for the fast service, but probably next time let items sit for a little with the hot noodles.",

But I really wasn't surprised since I've heard a lot of great things about Sora.  It really wasn't a hard decision for me to decide which Ramen Bowl to order.  The Deluxe Sora Ramen had everything I needed.  The only tough decision that I had was deciding which broth to pick since they had 3.   I went with their Shoyu Broth.  Deluxe Sora Ramen with Shoyu Broth --  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1v0IrNi&s=09a4cbf791ae2ae01c2180e7245ac724fed1e4423b6dd10e624b0f4393874ebc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1v0IrNi</a> Good broth, nicely roasted pieces of Chasu Pork, and good noodles.  It's a real solid bowl of ramen.  Is it the best ramen I've ever had?  Maybe not, but it's definitely a lot better than most ramen joints I've been to.  I'd order this again!  My favorite ramen spot in Vegas still goes to Jinya.  But Sora is pretty close.  I love the simplicity of their menu and would love to come back here again in the future to try their other Ramen Bowls since they all look delicious.",

It's hard to compare the two b/c we did tonkatsu there and that option isnt avail here.  Instead we asked for their most popular options, which were the house and the spicy, so we opted for the latter and chose a miso broth (shio and shoyu were the other options).  For on $1, we upgraded to the large, which is like kaedama.  We only ordered one bowl to share bc our past few days of gluttony is catching up to us!  So I like the noodle here a lot more.  It's thicker and not over-cooked.  And even though I always prefer tonkotsu, this broth was delish!  And the spicy is not wimpy at all.  As for the fixings, there was a good amount of it, and the chashu was even tastier than Monta's.  The soft boiled egg was a bit overdone, but still good.  I was surprised how quickly the restaurant fills up. We got there at opening, and a line quickly formed.    I enjoyed my experience at Sora.  Def better than a lot of places I've tried on the East Coast.",

In Battle Ramen Vegas, the contenders are widely considered Monta and Ramen. I am no ramen expert, but I have learned that these spots serve up different types of ramen (Hakata vs Sapporo). Some contend they should not be compared, but if thin crust vs deep dish is a fair fight, so is Hakata vs Sapporo.   And, the winner for me is the Sapporo-style delight being served at Ramen Sora! I would actually return for more, please.   I ordered the Nori Ramen with miso broth. (Based on my rapid Wiki education, miso broth is the signature broth of Sapporo-style.) I passed off my egg to my husband and removed all of the bamboo shoots, and from there on out, it was edible bliss even on a 103 degree day. I rarely finish an entire bowl of soup, but I slurped every last drop of the rich, flavorful broth. I also devoured the curly, slightly chewy noodles. I was even a little sad when I finished off the last bite of pork. It wasn't too fatty, and it had the taste of the finest pork BBQ in Texas. Oh, and I have recently developed cravings for seaweed, so the crunchy sheets lining the bowl were a wonderful treat. Alas, it was gone too soon.  I also enjoyed the atmosphere. It is clean, airy and cool. There are numerous seating options, and the service is super quick.     Like pizza, I think that ramen is probably a strong personal preference, but personally, I haven't had a finer bowl of soup than this miso broth beauty in quite some time.  Random notes: They have alcohol-free Sapporo beer, and for all you spicy lovers, they have a Killer Spicy Ramen which we heard is pretty insurmontable.",

Maybe I am biased because I tried Monta Chaya first. I'm not sure. I ordered the miso Ramen with extra chashu pork. I asked if they can sear the pork, but she said no and that it would be an extra $4.00 to do so. At Monta, they will do it if you wanted it seared. Also, we asked for soy sauce because my friend ordered the chashu pork bowl, and the waitress said they didn't have soy sauce. That's unusual for an Asian venue. On a good note, I got my meal fairly quickly so that was good. I'm not sure if it's common or not, but my chashu was partially cold as if it had just come out of the fridge. Eventually it got warmed because of the broth. The bamboo shoots tasted weird to me...What I did like was the broth. Miso broth was good, but by my tastes, it didn't taste better than the tonkatsu-shoyu broth at Monta Chaya. Overall, it was a decent meal.",

I'm usually not picky with my food, especially if it's ramen or any type of noodles/soup... But I forced myself to finish at least 3/4 of the bowl, just 'cause I hate wasting food. My fiance didn't finish his bowl either, and he eats everything and anything, so that's saying a lot, lol.

I order shio soup base and it is just right, not salty or greasy.  The ramen is great, not over cooked.  The best is their chashu..... OMG, it is just PERFECT! (Yeah, I went there two days in the roll!). Even their curry is better then the curry house in LA (curry house is a little salty for my taste.)   Only bad part about this place..... Service is a little slow.",

Basically there are four flavors, miso, shio, shoyu, and killer spicy.  I ordered  the miso ramen, the deluxe I think.    The broth, was not salty, but wasn't as hot-temperature wise, too. The noodles are the thicker type noodles.  The deluxe has a slice of a boiled egg, three pieces of nori, 3 pieces of chashu, and green onions.  I found two small slices of bamboo so that was the only veggies I could dig up. I asked if they had other veggies and the waiter said they basically didn't have any.  Ok? At least get kimchee or bok Choy or sprouts, idk, something.    Also ordered the gyoza. it's only three pieces, just your average gyoza.  It wasn't completely horrible, but perhaps not as impressive as the other reviewers made it to be.  I still plan to come back to give it another try.",

I ordered the Shoyu ramen, my favorite. Trust me, I was very tempted by their spicy options but in order to truly compare the two noodle shops, I had to go for the classic. I really liked it! It was a little saltier than the broth at Monta and the noodles were thick and chewy. I was fine with these things, but I must admit, I would still pick Monta as my first choice. Don't get me wrong, I will be back to Sora. I guess it just depends on which of the two I'm craving since they're different. They have a couple of dessert options, so with my sweet tooth, this is a definite plus. They have mango mochi and Kurogoma Dango. I didn't get to try either one on this trip, but I shall try one next time.  I liked the fact that Sora's dining room is spacious and not quite as busy as Monta's. Service was fast and everyone was very nice. I'll definitely be back. I must try their spicy soup!",

Excellent noodles and the broth is balanced. If you ask, the staff might say that the miso ramen is the best, but i would definitely say the shio ramen is the best. My boyfriend agrees with me, after having the miso ramen the first few times. All of the flavours are delicious, dont get me wrong, but the shio is an amazing savory broth without being too salty. Killer ramen is super spicy so beware. If you like it hot, try spicy ramen. Its spicy but also flavourful. Their gyoza are also good. I come here whenever i get the chance. The place can sometimes get busy at night but it is usually worth the wait.",

This broth is super flavorful and salty, I mean really really salty and flavorful. If you are totally crazy about eating salty food, you'll love this. The dish comes with half an egg, chopped green onion, strips of bamboo shoots and some form of meat which I wasn't able to identify but I assume it may be pork.   It is a very hearty soup with oily soft noodle in an oily meaty broth. Although it isn't something I'd want to eat regularly due to the high calories including the high fat and cholesterol content, I'd imagine many people would love this dish and obviously this place. It is decorated in a modern Asian style with nice lighting, a nice ambience and a spacious interior.   For fans of ramen, this is a five star rating kind of place. For someone like me, I will pass on ramen noodles.",

Contrary to other reviews here, my boyfriend and I think that Sora beats Monta by a tiny bit due to Sora's broth and toppings. I'd say come taste it yourself and you be the judge. It's very subjective after all.  Last note: I'll be bummed if I move back to San Diego because we don't have awesome ramen places like this. Tajima sucks! Will have to go to LA to get a good one.",

    "text": "Ramen is all the rage, and new Ramen-only restaurants seem to be popping up every month now in Vegas. Ramen Sora is the benchmark of this resurgence of Ramen. It is no longer just the dry brick of fried noodles you try to cram into your hotel room coffee maker.  I'll just go ahead and say it: Monta Ramen is salty. I never finish their broth, and I feel like I need to eat their noodles just to counter the salt and the odd viscosity of their soup base (too thick). Just like Pho Kim Long, Monta Ramen is the celebrity chef/critic favorite for what seems to be no valid reason. Maybe they pay their PR agencies the best - I don't know. It's 'cool' to like Monta Ramen. Well that sucks, because Ramen Sora is King. And Monta Ramen is that mean Prince who tries to trick the good Prince but ends up dying in the end trying to do so, and the crowd cheers!  At Ramen Sora I get the Nori Miso Ramen every time (w/Large Size upgrade for +$1.) There are times when I polish off 2/3rds of the broth before slurping a single noodle. It's that good. The noodles are great, but the broth is the star. Red stars unite, we have a clear Ramen winner in this town.",

    "text": "I'm no Ramen pro by any means.  In fact, I've only had Ramen a handful of times elsewhere and was told that real Ramen is only found in Chinatown.  So, here we go.   I originally thought that I haven't been here before.  It wasn't until I looked at their menu and used their restroom that I realized I have been here before.  My previous experience was before I started Yelping and don't remember anything negative.  So, I will consider this my first visit.    Met here with a couple of Yelp friends (Terri R. Chad S. and Nelson S.). Also met up with some new friends that Terri R. originally invited here.  My first thought before I dive into my Ramen taste test...I better ask a pro.  So naturally, I seeked out the advice from fellow Yelper Tetsuro P.  Tetsuro didn't hesitate and was willing to give me suggestions.  He, along with another Yelper Angela T, suggested that I stick with just their Miso and avoid their Shoyu and Shio.  I took his suggestions and I wasn't disappointed. I ended up ordering a large Ramen Miso (minus the meat), added seaweed, and two extra eggs. Only reason for the extra eggs was to compensate for the meat/protein that I had taken out.  I got their large and even though it was ginormous, I was still able to finish it because it was so good.  The Ramen itself went down smooth and also had a soft or creamy texture to it. I think this may be due to the miso broth. I didn't need to add anything else to my Ramen because I felt that it tasted good as is.    Service at this joint was at point.  There was a total of 7 of us and we all came in different times.  Because of this, our orders were not taken until all of us were present.  Overall, I think 4 stars is fair only because I really don't have anyone to compare to.  After my Yelp Check In, a gang of other Yelpers gave me suggestions on what to order and where else I should go.  I thank you all, especially to Tetsuro P. for his detailed suggestions.",

We came on Sunday for lunch and waited probably 5 minutes and got seated at the bar. The staff was really nice and welcoming. My boyfriend and I both ordered the Chashu Ramen with the miso soup base.  Comes with three HUGE pieces of chashu.  It was so tender that it melted in my mouth. Also comes with half a soft boiled egg, bamboo shoots, and green onions. The last time I came I got the Spicy Miso Ramen which comes with the spicy ground pork, which was pretty good too. I wish that they just had the spicy miso paste though..   They do have other items on their menu, just not on their actual menu (or I didn't see it at least). I know they have a chashu bowl and fried rice, because the couple next to us ordered HAHA, but damn that chashu bowl looked soooo good.   + Affordable $10-$15/person + Yummy chashu",

I had my wife taste it, she immediately called the waiter over and complained. My wife told the waiter not to take our word for it, and she insisted that he taste it himself. The waiter apologized and took the fried rice back. Wife noticed a young new cook in the kitchen and the waiter told us that it was that guy who was making the fried rice. I hope it was one time incident because we really loved their fried rice. Making matters worse their credit card machine went down so they had to resort to the old hard copy method which we had to wait extra 20 mins to pay.  Sorry ZERO TIP tonight from me.

Im trying to collect all the good ramen joints in the valley so i can show visiting friends. So far there are just a couple of places that stand out and this is one of them. The noodles are cooked well but being on the softer side, the different broths are very tasty. The temperature of the dish is good, i hate warm broth and scalding hot noodles, it shows that they gave it a quick mix before serving to circulate the broth throughout the noodles. Their charsiu has good flavor, a little on the thin side(not a bad thing, just a description), nice portion. I like to sample all of the broths and update but for now the miso is not for me, the shoyu i had the first time was good, nice savory broth that was a bit cloudy, im not sure if they have a base Tonkotsu broth that they flavor with soy sauce but it wasnt a straight \"shoyu\" based broth or at least i dont think it was, but it was still good. I'll definitely be going back many many times.",

I am a vegetarian, so I didn't eat ramen, which was fine because I wasn't too hungry... I did have the garlic edamame and OMG, it was the best garlic edamame that you will ever have. Soooooo delicious!  I got a second to-go order for the next day at home. There is about two appetizer items for vegetarians on the menu. My daughter Ashley is a \"ramen connoisseur\"  and this place is her absolute favorite. She has tried many here in Vegas. We moved here in November and she has been trying them all. BUT she always comes back here over and over. She's obsessed. Get there a little early because there is usually always a little bit of a wait but it goes pretty fast. I think it's because people eating, know that other people are waiting, so no one hangs out too long after they're done eating. The service here has always been great we've never had a problem and everything has and does come out delicious and fast.  We moved here from California and my daughter loved the Ramen there, so thank you thank you thank you for being such a delicious Ramen place for my daughter to enjoy Ramen at while we are here in Las Vegas now! You are my husband and daughters favorite here!",

We discovered Ramen Sora a couple of years ago, using YELP and have been going there at least once every time we're in Vegas.  There is always a line here from the moment they open their doors in the morning, so don't expect great service.  The servers are always busy and it's hard to get their attention, but the food makes it all worth it!!! We have tried several types of ramen, but my favorite has to be the Spicy Ramen with no bamboo.  I can honestly say that the only thing I didn't do is lick the bowl clean (although I am always very tempted).  From the first bite, the broth, the ramen, the egg, the butter and the pork were excellent!! The gyozas were also very tasty. I like that the restaurant is off the strip and it's easy to find parking.  I really wish I could find ramen this good in San Diego!",

Being that we woke up super late, we expected await... surprisingly enough? No wait time at all? PLUS! My favorite thing about this place? They don't close midday! This was one of the few ramen spots in Vegas that was a decently priced and open!   We also found this place through Yelp, thanks!  Going back to what I said earlier, YES. EVERYTHING IS GOOD! My BF and I were so hungry, we ordered a number of things: the Mini Chasu bowl, the Mini Curry Bowl, the Nori Ramen, and my BF being a huge spice lover, he got the Screaming for Vengeance Ramen.  The pork in the mini Chasu was soooo tender. Each bite literally fell apart and it was sooooo good. It almost felt like it was melting in my mouth, super duper good! Also, my most FAVORITE dish here had to be the mini curry bowl. I'm a sucker for Japanese curry. If I knew how delicious this was gonna be I should have just ordered than instead!   As far as the ramen goes, the portions are super huge and the broth was really flavorful! I also remember it being a little bit on the saltier side for me, but other than that, this place was really great! With just one visit, I'm a super huge fan and will be coming back!",

I think i've been to about 5 different Ramen joints. But I only remember about 3.  I got the Spicy Miso Ramen, it looked nothing like the picture when it came out lol, but it still tastes good. Wish I had ordered the gyoza, its my usual go-to appetizer. Probably will if I come back to this place again and order the screaming for vengeance ramen (lol). The Spicy Miso Ramen wasn't as spicy as i would've liked it to be. It comparable to like a teaspoon of sriracha mixed into the bowl in terms of spice.  Of the 5 Ramen spots I've been though, of the 3 I remember, this is my 3rd... LOLOL sorry, it was really hot the day I came, maybe it had an effect on my judgement.",

This place is always packed but thats understandable considering how good the ramen is here. Even with my fair share of ramen in Los Angeles...somehow this place tops it off.   I ordered a buttered corn miso ramen since I was sharing with my oldest daughter. Nothing too complicated since we were having a late dinner upon arriving in Vegas from LA. Even though it was a late dinner, theres still a line to get into this place.   I love how flavorful my bowl of ramen was. It was like heaven in every bite. And the best part is.. my daughter loves it. She devoured everything in her bowl leaving it empty. Service was a bit slow though but again it was busy for a friday night so no complaints here. And its great for a cold night to warm up with a hot steaming bowl of ramen.",

The price is a bargain compared to jinya and Monta. The dining area is roomier than Monta and less so than jinya. The ramen is rich, fatty, flavorful, and filling. The chashu in the rice bowls make the rice bowls well worth it and the pork fried rice is pretty good too. Enjoy!  I recently feel in love with Screaming Vengeance. If you consider scoff when your friends say something is spicy this is the bowl for you. I recently went to a newer ramen place on Jones that was pretty proud of their habanero bowl and Vengeance runs circles around it. Unlike a lot of dishes that only seem to care about lighting your mouth on fire, this one is actually as flavorful as it is spicy. Although I got through it with no regrets, I burped while on the way home and nearly had am accident. It's as if the bowl didn't want me to be cocky. I'm going to have a hard time ever going anywhere else for ramen after this visit.",

I've also noticed that my family from Hawaii always sends me a picture whenever they come here as well so that's always a good sign.  I usually order the large spicy miso ramen when it's my first meal, but sometimes I'll just order the regular if this is our second meal while my son goes for the extra large killer spicy miso ramen.  This was my nephew's first time here so he went all out and ordered the extra large killer deluxe miso ramen.  I actually felt kind of bad watching him suffer, but he wouldn't admit that he was having a hard time finishing his order.    I wasn't sure whether it was because he ordered too much noodles or if it was too spicy for him, but I wasn't going to ask the kid anything that would make him break down and cry.  After he finally finished his ramen, he said he really liked it.",

My only wish is that they would serve the roasted corn butter ramen here, but the corn butter ramen is still amazing!",

There was a lot of foot traffic coming in the restaurant but when people heard it was a 45min wait they left.  I recommend getting the Miso Broth. There was a lot of flavor. I also loved the noodles they were chewy and slightly thicker.  Overall good experience. I would go again. I like it more than monta ramen.",

We came in waited about 7 min to get seated which is absurd! Then it took them a good 10 min to even take our order! There were others around us who have received better service! I've asked all three women working as servers for a refill on our water. LOL its a fucking joke! To have the women go around the entire restaurant filling up everyone elses glasses but ours. I've asked for my check TWICE! They never handed it to us. We had to physically walk to the counter to pay unlike every other individuals who it was just handed to them. People may argue that we were perhaps rude or disrespectful during our visit, but I guarantee you we sat there enjoying our ramen.  If I could give this restaurant zero stars I'd love to! First and last visit. I didn't even leave a tip. Just gave them an exact amount.",

COCKTAIL SIDESHOW AKA. VALHALLA RAMEN) ...' I loved it anf swore it as the best ramen ever. Now, after a second visit, I know why: it is basically the second best ramen broth ever. The second best chashu pork ive ever had. The second best noodles.... it is a close second in every category.... what that means? It meana that in any two - or more categories - of ramen, itis in the top two. Meaning its the best overall of any ramen. Other shit has great broth, great pork, great noodles, great atmosphere..... but thats it. This place has almost great EVERYTHING",

I don't remember what it was called, but it's under the appetizers part of the menu. The meat was so tender and saucy. The ramen was very flavorful but not overly salty like most ramen places.

Service is nice and the food comes out really fast, but we don't really eat there during busy hours.   What we usually eat: Chashu Ramen (Miso or Shoyu) Killer Spicy Ramen (Miso)  My only gripes are with how they serve drinks aside from water.

I personally ordered the large curry bowl since: 1) I've been craving curry for a while and have been too lazy to make it myself at home and 2) I was having rice withdrawals (if you grew up eating jasmine rice on a daily basis with every meal then suddenly stopped for a few days, for a vacation for instance, you know exactly what I'm talking about). It honestly was the best curry dish I've ever had in my life! The food was so good that I ended up eating my entire plate, finishing my sister's ramen, and all of the gyoza that we ordered (don't judge me, hahah)! The food is reasonably priced here as well! Definitely check this place out!!!",

Sure, while everything runs smoothly, they are borderline decent they.....But have one problem with the food or service and all of that goes out the door.  My girlfriend is Vegetarian and I had been wanting to go to this place for years. We ordered her fried rice and asked for them to make it vegetarian, without any meat, when the food arrived, to my girlfriends surprise she bit into a big piece of meat!  She almost threw up aince she hadn't eaten meat in 16 years , we asked to have it redone and the manager, female Japanese said she couldn't guarantee there would be no meat in it. At this point my girlfriend asked to cancel the dish and the manager said no that she would have to pay for it or replace it for something else of equal value... we then asked if they could make a vegetarian dish for her then and they said no, only what's on the menu!??is this real life???  We ordered her mochi and a soda and left.. literally the only thing vegetarian on the menu.  Today I tried to eat there again, I brought my girlfriend take out and went inside and asked the manager if it was possible for us to bring in her vegetarian dish and explained the story that  I had been wanting to eat there for a while but couldn't since they don't have one single vegetarian dish.. They said no, and that they wouldn't have anything vegetarian, I then asked if they could possibly think about making a vegetarian Ramen or dish in the future and the tall male server who had been listening in an noticed I was frustrated even though I was explaining how much I wanted to be able to eat there,  stated in a sarcastic voice, \"probably not\" with a smirk.  I was planning on taking out but after that I just wanted to leave..  I can't stand small/close minded business owners.  Can't have egg after 11am.. can't substitute items on diahes. Etc..",

I opted out of the miso broth, which I later regretted since it was a bit too salty to my liking.   A couple things that I did like were the meat and the service.  The meat was very flavorful and at its perfect texture and ratio of meat and fat.  Service was excellent; we didn't have to wait more than 4 minutes for our food, and our tea cups and glasses were never empty.   I would go back again just to give it another whirl (maybe try the spicy ramen) and just because there are only a handful of ramen shops in Vegas to go...   Slurp away!",

I can tell that it is just like homemade, boiled for a long time with all the bones and pork and etc. Light, subtle and very tasty.  2  The Ramen - Just right Al Dente  3.  The choices -  All sorts of choices, additional toppings, larger size with more noodles and etc.  4.  The key points - I like the pork tenderloin in any ramen. I also like the flavor of green onion sliced and cooked to perfection.   5.  Parking - Has parking, in it's own lot, however, the traffic direction seems to be a bit odd, seems that the entrance is two way, yet large enough for only one car.  6.  Service and Seating - Small, be prepared to wait, nice service, and very busy.  For a Ramen place, very nice. I have been to many Ramen shops in Japan and in San Francisco, so having this place as an option is nice.  GK says, check it out.",

The food is hot and consistently on-point!  I always order the Screaming for Vengeance shio Ramen with fried rice, gyoza, and the mini chasu bowl. All a delightful taste sensation...  Don't trust my reviews on spicy food if you have low tolerance for spicy food. For my tastes, Screaming for Vengeance is just above a medium level of spiciness. I'd say it's about as hot as the xxtra flaming hot cheetos in the black bag. It'll make your nose run, but it's highly tolerable and still has flavor. One of my dining partners did not share the same sentiment. He thought it was insanely hot and he basically chucked the rest of his rice and tea down to calm the burn... My tip? Let it cool down temperature wise and the spiciness won't be so intense.",

I always get extra chasu because the corn butter comes with 1 piece only (wtf!) but to add chasu is relatively inexpensive so its worth it. The way the butter melts with the corn gives the ramen a creamy finish thats to die for. This place isn't without fault, its small and most nights theres a slight wait but it hasn't been inconvenient enough for me lose interest in ramen sora. Their soda which I noticed is common in the china town area is by the can but I actually like that, it leaves little room for flat drinks.  They do have spicy meat if you need that little kick which is nice and even the killer spicy meat isn't too overpowering over the dish. I'm a big fan of Ramen sora and will most definitely be back.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying I really do love the food here. I've been coming here since they've been open and I always order the same soup because it's so amazing. Their miso broth is probably one of the best I've tasted and their eggs are always cooked perfectly.  The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because of their service.  I went to Ramen Sora yesterday around 6:30 to 6:40. Pretty much during the dinner crowd. I had 5 people total in my party, but it only took them a few minutes to get us a table. So far, so good! Our waitress was an older Asian woman with glasses, and she took our drink orders, came back, and took our food orders. We all ordered ramen, but my boyfriend and I always get the Screaming For Vengeance miso broth with extra seaweed, extra egg, and no green or white onions. I'm very aware that the miso is cooked with onions and it tastes delicious, however, I cannot stand the texture of onions so I prefer to leave them out. I don't mind if there's a few left, just not a heaping pile of it. Anyways, it took about 6 to 8 minutes after we ordered to receive our food. Well, I mean, my party's food. I had yet to receive mine. So I waited.... and waited.... and waited some more. It took between 15 to 20 minutes for my food to come out, and I was not happy. By the time I got my food, the rest of my party was already done with theirs. The seaweed had been sitting in there too long, and it was a little too cold, but I don't like to complain when I'm hungry. I ate it and we received our check which came to almost $70. My tip to them was $3. I get it. It was busy, there was a lot of people. I'm very unhappy because the waitress didn't really seem to care, just gave me a quick \"Sorry\" and disappeared until the table was cleared. Anyways, another lady comes and grabs the check and looks inside, makes a face, and motions to our waitress. She points to me as if I wasn't even there, and our waitress rolled her eyes while they're pretty much badmouthing me.  We got up, and our waitress had the audacity to shake her head at me. That really made me upset. Not only is that very rude and disrespectful, but it's extremely unprofessional.  I did not appreciate that. I get that waitresses live off of tips. I live off of my tips as well. I am not going to reward bad service. My tips to someone are a privilege, not a right, and workers here in Las Vegas seem to not realize it's not your right to receive a tip. If you're going to badmouth a customer, as least do it out of sight. Or don't do it at all. Sadly, I won't be back to this place, which breaks my heart since I truly love your miso broth. But I'd rather spend my money at a place that doesn't talk smack and shake heads at their customers just because I left a $3 tip. Judging by your reactions, I'm pretty sure you deserved it.  Edit:  I decided to come back to this place because I can't stay away from their amazing killer spicy miso ramen. I'm glad I came back. Haven't had problems since. I just avoid the two ladies who were rude, and thankfully I rarely have to see them. Definitely try all their food. It's pretty great.",

    "text": "In comparison to the many Ramen joints I have had, this one definitely fell short.  The best I can say is it was still good for what it was.  I would not turn down a bowl here if I had no other choice.  I still enjoyed it for the most part.    One positive is they do offer various flavored broths.  Secondly, they offer cheap ($2-3) mini rice bowls that you typically see at Ramen joints.  You can order that as a side item to compliment your slurping meal.  Third, there are various toppings like corn that you can add as an extra cost.  Usually when I try a place for the first time, I always attempt the classic flavors so that it serves as a basis for comparing to other places.  So I elected for the chashu bowl in shio style (salt).  Unlike my favorite places, the flavor was not as \"popping.\"  When you eat Ramen, the broth has to shine.  I would say it was mediocre at best.  The noodles themselves was also different from what I'm use to.  A positive note however is the sliced chashu pork was pretty good!    The mini rice bowls I got to try were the grilled pork and grilled pork with curry.  Both tasted very good and easily finishable if you are hungry.    There was a wait for my group but it was not terrible.  The joint is kind of small.  The service was pretty friendly and attentive.  Also, they yell like real Japanese.  Arrigato Sora for a 3-star experience!",

Their menu is simple with includes pictures of the different varieties of ramen and offers three choices for broth (have the Miso version, that is my favorite). The ramen comes in two sizes: regular and large. The regular size is large enough for most peoples' appetites. I would go again and have the miso broth ramen.",

    "text": "I've been eating a lot of ramen these days and Ramen Sora is just one of the places that I happened to check out. I've been there twice so far, but this review is a reflection of my most recent visit.  We arrived on a Sunday evening and the restaurant was not full at all.  There were plenty of empty and cleared tables available.  However, they insisted that we write our name down and wait.  A few more parties arrived after us and they were also instructed to write their name down on the growing list.  (Hmmm...why can't they just seat us?  Don't they see that we have a toddler in hand who is attempting to touch all the business cards and paper junk they have at the front register while we wait?  We could entertain him a lot better if we were seated!)  I could only assume it's because they are understaffed.  Are they hiring?  If not, they should be.  When we were finally seated, putting our order in takes a good while too.  Be prepared to wait!  But when you do get your order in, it comes out super fast!  So, that's definitely a plus!  We ordered the Nori Ramen - Miso ($8.50) and the Butter Corn Ramen - Shio ($9.00) and upgraded the latter to the larger size ($1.00).  We thought the ramen was fine, although the Husband preferred the broth at another ramen joint we had just visited the day before out of state.  On our first visit, we also tried the Mini Pork Chashu Bowl ($2.85).  It's a cute little tiny bowl that is very kid-size friendly or an add-on to your ramen bowl.  3.5 stars",

The first time I came here almost a year ago, it was forgettable. I don't remember liking it or hating it. But I tried it again a week ago and it was Fan-effin-tastic.  I was blown away.  My friend and I tried to go to Monta for lunch, but the line was crazy-long so we hurried over to Sora.  There was a line here as well, but not as long.  We waited 30 minutes and finally got seated.  I have to say, the servers and hostesses are impressive the way they turn the tables over.  They are quick and do not waste a single minute getting people in and out of there, and yet we never felt rushed.    We both ordered the spicy ramen with shoyu broth. I added nigori and extra chashu.  The flavors were amazing.  I could not believe how much I loved this bowl of ramen.  I've alway been a huge fan of Monta but I'm afraid to say I will probably never go back to Monta after having eaten this bowl of delicious spicy ramen.",

I don't like the vibe here; if you're looking for the energetic, late-night bustle, you'll find happier places with happier people.   What I do like is the miso ramen, though. Ramen Sora is Sapporo-style. Sapporo-style is Miso Ramen. MISO RAMEN!! That is all.  (No, really. When all you care about is getting a glorious bowl of miso ramen, just order it from Ramen Sora, super-size.   Skip the chashu. It's unimpressive, and pops up awkwardly in between mouthfuls of miso. Don't suffer the distraction.  Gyoza's good. Get the gyoza. Get two orders.  Oh, and don't forget the green onion and seaweed.)  Closer to a 3.5, but rounding up because best miso ramen.",

If you go afterwards, expect to wait at least 30 minutes.  Basic ramen starts at $7 and up to $10.  But you can customize by adding extra meats, noodles and such for extra couple of dollars.  I usually get Deluxe Sora Ramen with miso base and supersize it (double the noodles) for $2 more. Soup is so flavorful and yummy.  I wish I lived closer to this restaurant (or if they would open one in San Francisco area) so I can go more often.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place but since the other ramen place had overly salty broth the last two times, I got turned off eating ramen all together. There was a odd day of constant rain and cool temps in this blister which needed to be celebrated with some soup. Made for a perfect excuse to have something warming.  I grabbed up a miso ramen and the BF went for spicy ramen and on the recommendation of the server for a \"lighter\" broth got shoyu base. The miso was savory and buttery (has some oil floaties, but enough to be a deterrent) and not overtly salty. I really like that it comes with a soft boiled soy egg, the thicker rustic roast style cut of chashu was tender and the ramen was rightfully chewy. This is a bit different from the traditional Sapporo toppings I'm used to as it normally has corn, bean sprouts, pork, and garlic. I suppose I could add those toppings next time. I took a taste of the BFs shoyu spicy broth and it was fairly good. Still a bit porky, but much lighter since it isn't creamy like the miso and the spicy crept up to a medium burn.   We got a mini chashu bowl to share. It was much smokier than the chashu in the soup so it seems they throw it on the grill before serving and top with a drizzle of sweet soy so it's a different experience. I like this preparation. I wish they offer some vinegar as a side condiment as the little bit of acid would be nice with the sweet.   We came within the last hour of being open so I figured that's why service is quick, but hope that it soup comes out that fast regularly. Our server was friendly and didn't make us feel rushed.   I definitely prefer this over the other ramen place. Somehow my BF got it in his head he doesn't like ramen so even though I like it, it may be a trek I make again alone.",

    "text": "Food for thought, some say ramen is a derivative of the Chinese dish, laomien...remember most oriental ethnicities are distant descendants of China and the Japanese pronounces L's as R's...interesting huh?  Moving on, I dropped in this place when they first opened and later left since it was cash only at the time.  So I managed to return with the main squeeze since she recommended trying the place out, why not?  Do keep in mind that there is a small parking lot at the rear that can be tricky with people coming and going, so be careful when exiting to the street.  There was a 5 minute wait, which I told myself must be a good sign.  Once seated, we were sharing a large table with another group separated with a makeshift partition that was also a special menu.  Kinda like a science project board or something of the sort.  Anyhow, I read on Yelp that a lot of people enjoyed the Killer Spicy Ramen A.K.A. Screaming for Vengeance...so I had to give it a try, in shoyu broth.  Apparently they offer shio (salt), miso (fermented bean), and shoyu (soy sauce) broth...I wish they had kotteri.  In addition to that, my girl got the Deluxe Miso Ramen while I added a Curry Chashu Bowl, Gyoza and tall Kirin Ichiban draft beer.  What's puzzling to me is that if this type of ramen originated from Hokkaido, why isn't there Sapporo on tap?  It didn't take long for the food to come out and began nibbling on the Curry Chashu Bowl immediately.  Its yummy but was quick to notice that their chashu is doesn't melt in your mouth like it does at Monta.  It is, in fact, very similar to Fukimimi Ramen chashu, a little bit chewier but there is a grilled or smoked flavor that was received very well.  When the ramen arrived, like all soups, I like to take a second or two to taste the broth by itself before loading up any condiments or additives.  I was surprised to learn that the broth was not that spicy, given the name...it was more like whispering for vengeance.  I was praying that it was a creeper and would live up to its name, but unfortunately that never happened.  Thick ramen noodles were included versus Monta and Fukumimi, which is not a bad thing for me.  If I had to choose, ranking would be Monta, Ramen Sora, then Fukumimi, when it comes to ramen noodles alone.  I am not sure if it is handmade here either.  The ramen was pretty disappointing and tasted very much like a mad scientist concoction of instant ramen packets with a heavy dose of togarashi.  My girl was not very please with her \"Deluxe\" as well and we decided to get it over with and get our fill before heading over to the Ice Skating Yelp event at the Cosmo, thanks Misti Y. for the free tickets...well Darlene R. thanks you, she was the Elite member to receive them.  I left the place full and can admit that the only good thing in the ramen is the red fishy chili oil sauce used to garnish the bowl of ramen, other than that, probably will have to rank  this near the bottom of the pack in terms of ramen.  Some  katsuobushi, wakame or togarashi would be nice too.  I still want to come in for the butter corn ramen since it was my initial pick.  So lesson learned, go with your instinct Yelpers.  LOL.  Oh yeah, another thing, when it comes to ramen and pho, I came to notice a lot of people are very particular to certain flavors, so much of this is to each his/her own.  I like to do research on the whole culture to know what I am searching for in good ramen or pho.  Also, forgot to mention that those that like ramen may want to try Taiwanese and Chinese noodle soup as well...Wendy's Noodle Cafe & Yi Mei Champion Taiwanese Deli.",

This is by far my favorite ramen to date; I love the Sapporo style ramen they serve here, with it's rich flavor and chewy, al dente noodles.  Having tried a few other spots in Vegas, as well as spot in LA and San Francisco, Ramen Sora remains my favorite!  The pork is always tender and flavorful.  Eggs are always cooked perfectly.  Plenty of topping combinations are available, but I usually go for the Nori Ramen; you're pretty much getting a Deluxe Bowl minus the extra pork for $1.50 less.  The miso broth is my favorite, and offers very rich flavors.  Not too salty, just rich.  Rich like Bruce Wayne going on a yacht with the entire Russian ballet.  The miso at other places is rich like Bruce Wayne doing the Batdance with Miranda Tate on the floor of a giant mansion with no electricity...it could be better.  Are those references even accurate?  I don't know.  But I do know that you should give Ramen Sora a try, even if you are already devoted to another ramen shop in town.",

    "text": "When it comes to Ramen in Las Vegas I've read all the reviews for the 3 main places. But I held off on trying any because in the back of my mind ramen is the stuff you find in styrofoam cups or bricks of dried noodles wrapped in cellophane. Ramen Sora is not that kind of Ramen at all. Not even close.   Ramen Sora is pushing it distance wise for my lunch choices, but I went anyway. (Gotta love Desert Inn - Super Arterials equal SPEED so getting past Las Vegas Blvd is not an issue!) The place is very clean, even a peek through the door into the kitchen showed it to be almost spotless. Service was fast, friendly, and most importantly very helpful. I can't recall everything I ordered, Green Tea, a side plate with eggs, Charsiu, and other yummy stuff, and a bowl of Miso Ramen.   I have to say I'm typically NOT a pork fan. But when it comes to Charsiu...OMG I have never had anything like this before. Tender, easily pulled apart with chopsticks, and with a flavor I have rarely associated with pork in the past. Charsiu is incredible, more like mind blowing and it certainly adjusted my mindset on pork and how it can be prepared. But as good as the Charsiu was, the bowl of Miso Ramen was beyond incredible. Ok, I admit I didn't eat the egg they put in it, but that's the only thing I didn't eat as this was one of the most flavorful dishes I've had in a very long time. I can't really describe the complexity except to say I have never sat down with a noodle type dish before and finished with a smile from ear to ear because it was so damn good. Until now.   I have a new found understanding on what True Ramen is, and how great it is. And I thank everyone who has taken the time to post on Yelp for helping point me towards one of the more incredible food experiences I've had to date since moving to Las Vegas. I will be back, I will bring others, and yes, this place is as awesome as others have said.   5 Stars, without any question or hesitation. TRY IT!",

I ordered a side of spicy meat added in my soup and it was a little too spicy for me, even though I normally can eat spicy. Also, the meat was cold, but warmed up after I stirred it into my ramen. We also ordered two orders of gyoza for our party of 4, which we ate quickly. We went around 4 pm on a weekday and the restaurant was empty, I was expecting a wait so I recommend going during that time for minimal waiting. Highly recommend this spot for flavorful ramen.",

There's like one place that I know of that serves it, and it's overrun by a bunch of wanna hipsters.  Well, the noodles were a little too hard.  It didn't seem like it was cooked enough.  The price was good though.  I will admit to that.  There's something to be said about the menu system.  There was the basic Ramen, and then there were add-ons like all places, but some certain combinations of  add-ons actually resulted in \"another type of Ramen.\"  I felt like I was confusing the waitress by asking for the \"basic\" and putting in X,Y,Z add-on and it ended up being some \"other Ramen\" that was on the menu.  Am I making sense at all?  No?  Fine.  S'all good.  Go to LA.  If you can't, go here.",

I ate the whole bowl, so I must have liked it.  However, maybe I was spoiled by Monta down the street, because I was bummed to find they had so few choices of add-ins like chili oil or pickled ginger.

I mean I know it's a small building, I just thought they would have had more chairs and tables inside.  I have been wanting to try this place since it first opened and I finally did one day during my lunch break. I arrived shortly after opening time and it was quiet but boy oh boy did that place fill up very quickly.  I ordered the spicy hot soup (can't remember the name)  with shoyu broth but very similar to the deluxe. I added bean sprouts to my soup and also ordered the gyoza.  My Ramen was just okay. I don't know if it was the reviews that I read that let me down or if I am a Ramen snob. Either way, it was just okay. The broth was good, flavorful, the noodles were neither here nor there for me. The noodles I was not a fan of. I love a good chew to my noodle but these just didn't work for me.  The pork belly in my soup was so tender and good though. The seaweed I wanted more but refused to pay $1.00 for 3 sheets. My egg could have been cooked less but needless to say, I love egg in my Ramen so not too much of a gripe for me.  The gyoza however, hands down some of the best I have ever had in my life. Simply put: they were cooked perfectly, moist and flavorful on the inside. I felt like I won the jackpot with this dish.  Would  I go back? Yes, why not. I would love to try their miso broth and I gotta go back for the gyoza. But I am not in a big rush to return.",

The prices have gone up about $1 or so per item in the last year and there are no real options for vegetables.

Who said that? All I was saying in my head was, this ramen better be good or else a special someone will definitely get an ear full from me!    This ramen house was highly recommended by my Vegas connection.  He has yet to disappoint me on his foodie suggestions may be because he has known me for like forever.  Anyway, I am certain he is probably rolling his eyes as he reads this review thinking he knows better ramen than I do.  Hahaha!  Ok.  Like most ramen house, it was a cozy place so most people were waiting outside.  It was definitely a cold and windy November day.  We waited about 25 minutes so not too bad for a popular ramen spot.  Once we got seated, I ordered right away since I didn't want to waste my time and theirs for any further delay ;)  Corn butter miso amazingly delicious.  Packed heavily with deliciousness, al dente ramen, and believe me, I slurped every bit of that broth!  I don't even think I took a sip of water during my meal.  Yessss, it was that good.  Definitely one of the best I have ever had.  Tonkotsu ramen was just as flavorful and yummy! Great savory broth, cant help but finish everything to the last drop.  It would be wise to go in a group so everyone can taste the best of both worlds.  Which in our case we did and glad we did.  I'd love to have them both again on my next visit to sin city!  Gyoza was for extra credit.  Get it.  Its worth it!  As I have mentioned in the past,  there are only certain things I would ever wait in line for.  Amazing and delicious ramen I definitely would.    Hint:  Daikokuya in Little Tokyo is not even worth waiting for.  Ramen Sora is!",

This restaurant is located on Spring Mountain between Arville & Decatur.    I got the shio ramen for $7.50 and added corn for $1 more.  The broth was hot and flavorful, the chasu was tender, and the noodles were perfect.  It was absolutely everything ramen should be.  I loved every hearty spoonful that slid down the back of my throat.    The $5.85 pork fried rice was one of the best things I've ever eaten.  I shy away from bacon and pork usually but this was AMAZING.  The pork was salty and tender like pot roast and my mouth is watering right now thinking about it.  This is a must-order!!!!

    "text": "I have only been to a ramen place two times before so I don't have a great deal of experience.  Some family members were in town and since they had watched a movie called \"The Ramen Girl\" they wondered if we had any ramen places in Las Vegas.  Sora has been bookmarked for many months so that's where we stopped.  We each ordered a different ramen.  I got the spicy miso ramen (size large) and a diet Coke.  The ramen was delivered in a few minutes and it was very good.  The broth was rich, the chasu was very good, and the egg was perfectly cooked.   I added some extra seasoning from the table and this turned out to be a very filling late lunch/early dinner.    As we were finishing, one family member asked if I wanted to try and order of dumplings.  Why not?  We got an order of gyoza and they were good.  The sauce served with them was outstanding!!    Service was very good.  The price was good.  Soup is always good.  All served up in a small, comfortable restaurant.",

    "text": "Ordered the miso chasu ramen with extra bamboo shoots. Broth was rich and flavorful and NOT super salty.  Unlike the ramen I tried in Fukumimi. The True seller here is the chasu. The slices of chasu are super thick and tender. I've never had a ramen that had such thick slices of chasu, you definitely get your money's worth. Also I'm in love with the bamboo shoots. I like how they are thick, chewy, and juicy. The way they're supposed to be eaten! Most ramen places give very thin slices of bamboo. The ramen noodles tasted ok, they were also thick and wavy, nothing too special about them. I'd wish they offer chili oil on the side,  it would've made the broth even more awesome. They do have chili powder, however I find it doesn't really offer much of a difference in flavor.    The only downside to this place is how crowded this place can get. Seating is limited. We came around 3pm, it got packed fast. Another downside is how stuffy and hot inside it was. I was sweating in there! I'd wish they turn on the AC full blast or something. Eating hot bowls of ramen especially in Vegas weather, not very comfortable. Parking was plentiful though. I would definitely come here again if I ever have an urge for ramen again. The quantity and quality of the chasu and bamboo shoots definitely won me over for sure.",

Correct there is no tonkotsu style choices here, but I tried the Deluxe Sora in Shoyu flavor. In short great al dente noodles, nice egg but the highlight was the char shiu. Some places cut razor thin slices, some places give you chunks, darn it I like chunky slices and wow wow wow did they exceed my expectations on that. A mere $2.50 for another generous three slices? I'm in! I admit it was gluttonous but oh so worth it. Flavorful broth, very good portions and the char shiu upgrade to me is so worth it.  Yes our friend said this place is just as popular as other highly reviewed ramen joints in LV, so avoid peak hours or you may have to stand in the hot sun.",

I have to say that the last few times have been a little disappointing. The quality of the Ramen has fallen off a little bit. Seems to be more broth and less Ramen, pork and other ingredients. Lots of broth. Still very tasty. But I have noticed that they seem to be cutting back. Please don't do this. You have the best tasting Ramen in town. Lines of people every day.

They helped us with the menu since we were unfamiliar with the bases of the ramen and my girlfriend does not eat pork. Note, they do only serve pork (unless I was informed wrong). We ordered the gyoza & 2 orders of the spicy ramen shio (salt) base. Also note that the spicy ramen is only spice due to the spicy meat (also pork). Our waitress offered to have the pork of my girlfriend's ramen on side in case I would want it but this would also mean her bowl would not be spicy. Though they do have spicy seasoning on the side. The gyoza was great, the filling was flavorful. Nothing out of this world though. The ramen was great. The broth was good and wasn't too salty. The noodles were perfect. The pork meat was very soft & tender. Everything worked out great. Even if my girlfriend's ramen wasn't spicy it was still good.",

We looked at the menu while we were waiting so when our waiter came around we put our order in. My bf and I got the chashu miso ramen which was good. The pork was fatty and tender. The noodles were thick and had a good chew on them. The broth was also fatty and salty but had a strong dried shiitake mushroom flavor. Not a complaint, I like fatty and salty and didn't mind the strong shiitake smell. The only thing I didn't like was the weird signing in situation. They kept taking the clipboard away when there were a few people that needed to sign in, including me, and I didn't want to have anyone cut in front. Otherwise, I'd come back.",

The broth is super flavorful and the chasu just melts in your mouth. At a lot of other places, the chasu tastes straight out of the freezer and every piece is the same size. That's definitely not the case here, it's super authentic. You can also upgrade the size of your bowl from a regular to a large or extra large which is nice. Not many other places offer different sizes.  Their gyoza is also phenomenal. It has great flavor and color to it with the perfect amount crispness. Their gyoza sauce is also super tasty.  I do wish the restaurant itself was a little bigger. More often than not, there's a bit of wait here. But that also goes to shows how delicious this places is!",

I ordered the nori ramen with miso base broth and did not add any other toppings on the side. However I was content with what I got in my ramen bowl! Noodles was just the right texture and had the right bounce when you bit into it. Egg was delicious, and the chashu!  I also ordered the melon creamy soda. Super yummy!! I also tried their curry bowl, fried rice and gyoza. All tasted really delicious!!!  If you love ramen, I'd say give this place a try!",

It's a small place and popular too, we also went during a peak hour so the wait was to be expected. We had great customer service and the food was delicious. I had the corn butter ramen in miso base and my roomie had the deluxe. She also had an order or the gyoza and I had the mini curry . The gyoza comes with 5 pieces and the you can also get a side of the curry and make it a large! So glad my friends brought me here. Prices are fair for the quality of food! Hope I was able to help and I hope you enjoy",

Best to get there early especially if you are starving, believe me it will be well worth the wait!  The staff are always super friendly and quick with service.   Our favorite picks are of course the ramens, the chashu bowl, gyoza and spicy pork fried rice.  Ramens have an assortment of soup bases and ingredients, I'm sure you'll find something you'll enjoy. I always go with the miso and chashu ramen. Can never get enough of the chashu here!. My hubby prefers the spicy ramen. I have been trying to convince him to try the killer spicy ramen but he is a little afraid he may not enjoy it! I think he'll be fine.   The chashu bowl is AWESOME!!!!! My fave and i always take a bowl to go (covers eyes) i dont regret it one bit!   If you want a good ramen spot this is totally awesome!!! Never a disappointment!!!!",

So it had the perfect amount of crisp. The ramen was really good. The broth and noodles were awesome. I've had better pork in at other ramen places. This was more like a roasted pork belly (like a pot roast) and the texture was a little different because of that. Still really good. Great balance of fat and meat on each slice. Price point was good.   I've had better tasting ramen with more depth in flavor of the broth and more flavor in the pork, but this was still really good.   Also the Melon creamy soda was super delicious.",

One of my companions is also someone who you'd never catch in a ramen house/restaurant, but he was very very impressed and satisfied with the butter corn ramen and so was I. I got the chashu ramen and the broth was amazing. The chashu itself was also very packed with juices and flavor while the noodles were just the right amount of chewy. We also got gyoza as an appetizer, but that's all it was in my opinion--nothing too special that'll make your jaw drop. Anyways, If I'm ever back in Vegas, I would come back here most definitely. I've already recommended this place to a couple of friends :-)",

I've had Ramen Sora bookmarked for a little while and decided to grab some to go after work the other week. Ramen comes with thick egg noodles (my fav), bamboo shoots (I get extra - it's the fermented yummy kind) bean sprouts, scallions, soft melt in your mouth chasu, half of a seasoned boiled egg, and ground spicy pork. Broth is flavorful and the heat is perfect! Portion is great - I've ordered to go twice now and wasn't able to finish the bowl both times.  Take out orders are quick (10 min or so) and the workers are always pleasant.  $11 for a filling bowl of delicious ramen is well worth it - I will definitely have to dine in sometime!",

The broth was ok but I was disappointed that the food was not piping hot. However, the really like the pork belly, talk about fatty goodness.

    "text": "Las Vegas residents should feel privileged that in our town we have the very best Ramen-Yas in America. I grew up in the largest Japanese Districts of Los Angeles county where the so called \"best ramen\" comes from. Nothing in Little Osaka or Little Tokyo can compare to the Ramen we got here in Las Vegas. Back in LA, all we had were Hakata Ramen-Yas. There were literally a thousand of them. We had two Tokyo Ramen-Yas(Koraku and Chin-Ma-Ya), and one gigantically overrated Sapporo Ramen-Ya named Santouka. Here in LV, we don't got a Santouka but we got something that is a million times better, RAMEN SORA!   We all know by now that the 3 Major Ramen Variations are: Sapporo(MISO), Hakata(TONKOTSU), and Tokyo(SHOYU). Here in Vegas our Ramen scene does not follow that generic formula. The scene is dominated by an extremely rare Osaka Ramen-Ya(Fukumimi), and a unique Kyushu variation from Kurume(Monta). The only traditional Ramen-Ya we have is a Sapporo one, which of course is SORA RAMEN. For decades, SORA has been a very popular ramen-ya in Japan. Yoshi-San, who owns and operates many of the better Japanese restaurants in town, decided to make a deal with the owners of the original SORA and acquire the rights to the secret recipe. Thanks to the great Yoshi-San, the most popular Miso Ramen recipe has finally come to America. And to make things better, it came to Las Vegas! Thank again Yoshi.  I wanna give credit to Ian, for always providing excellent service to us. Ian has incredible ramen knowledge.. maybe even more than me.   For the longest time, SORA was the only Ramen-Ya in Las Vegas that served Shio Ramen(recently Koraku came to town). But, nobody cared because the only people who eat Shio ramen are geriatric Japanese people who bitch about how Miso isn't supposed to be in ramen(My Dad). But, in all seriousness, there is actually a reason why many Sapporo/Hokkaido Ramen-Yas serve Shio. A while ago I was talking with a local Japanese hero at Sushi on Rainbow, who told me that there is a port city in Hokkaido that is world famous for their unique version of Shio ramen. And today many Sapporo Ramen-Yas will present a \"knock-off\" version of this unique recipe. We always assume Hokkaido Ramen is Miso, but I guess that's not entirely True.  So don't feel embarrassed to order Shio at a Miso ramen restaurant, you are still being True to protocol.   Curley noodles! Miso Ramen is supposed to have curly and thick noodles. SORA is the only ramen-ya I have been to that gets this right. Santouka has straight noodles even though they claim they are Sapporo. Monta, recently decided to get their act together and began serving \"curly\" noodles with their miso. I appreciate their attempt to be more authentic to the Sapporo style, but Monta's noodles are way to thin for Miso.   The Killer Spicy Miso Ramen is what I usually get here. Out of the 10 times I have ordered it, there were 2 times when I couldn't finish it. When you order this, you need a lot of water refills and extra napkins. The spices make you sweat profusely. When Ian is working, he will remember that you are taking on the Killer Spicy challenge and will come around often to refill your water. The other servers unfortunately don't, making the experience more difficult.   People in Los Angeles think they know what good or \"authentic\" Miso Ramen is. In reality, they have no clue. We here in Las Vegas have the very best Miso Ramen-Ya in America. In the past, all the big name restaurants in Japan decided to open up their American locations in LA, so it was really awesome to finally get one here in Las Vegas for a change. We got lucky this time... and yeah, f*ck you Los Angeles!",

There was a lot of people waiting to be seated but customers left very quickly after they had finished their meal.   As quickly as we were seated the waitress gave us the menus and asked what we liked to drink. I ordered miso ramen and my boyfriend ordered spicy miso ramen. Both dishes came out quickly and I dug in as soon as it came.   It was very delicious. I've been craving ramen for days! I've always just had top ramen and any packaged noodles from the grocery store but never had this type of ramen in a restaurant. But knew that the noodles would be a bit harder and chewy here. The pork literally melts in your mouth! Everything about the dish was delicious. I can't help but say that I felt something was missing. It was probably the fact that I was still hungry after. I'll definitely try one of the chashu bowls next or eat it along with my ramen. Great place to eat. Highly recommend on a cold and windy night!",

The only reason I mention patience is because this place is usually packed and you may expect at least an hour wait to get a table. As soon as you get seated though, you'll be guaranteed some great ramen.  The miso broth is just the right amount of saltiness and serving of noodles is decent. My only complaint is that due to a shortage of chashu pork I was unable to try their popular ramen bowl so it's a good idea to be their as soon as they open. Nonetheless I enjoyed a nori ramen and received great service from the servers.",

I've always get Screaming for Vengeance, spiciest ramen in town. Used to give me runny nose from the spiciness but now I can barely feel a thing. It's spicy but not like you can't taste your food kind of spicy. They need to step it up and make it more spicy for me. Lol.  My boyfriend's favorite is corn butter ramen. It is quite delicious. I guess most things with butter taste good.  You should definitely try this place when you are in Vegas. Better than Monta Ramen",

Maybe they make the noodles in-house, I'm not sure, but it tastes like it. Their broth are very full bodied and tasty, specially the miso. And their chashu is what really tops it off. Getting extra chashu for only $2.50, gets you 3 extra slices. These are very generous slices. And for an extra $2.00 you can upgrade to a Superbowl. There's more but I'll stop here since it's making me hungry. Just thought I'd contribute to my favorite ramen spot",

That's why my friend and I have decided to order the most famous Miso Ramen and the Cashu Bowl.   When I asked the waitress how big is the mini Cashu Bowl, she told me it was about the size of a bagel. This's too small for both of us, so we thought it would be better to order a large Cashu Bowl, since we were starving, and they only offer mini size and large size. When the Cashu Bowl came, it was huge. We were so shocked that we stared at each other for a few seconds, speechless. Fortunately, the Cashu Bowl was really good that we've finished it even though we were super full. The Miso Ramen was good too, but the Cashu Bowl has definitely over-shined the Miso Ramen.",

I'm a little selective and bias with ramen as I've had my share in Japantown in LA.   No doubt, Ramen Sora was worth the pit stop. First, we were seated right away as we arrived after 130p (after the lunch rush). All tables were still occupied. Our order was also taken quickly and brought out quickly.   My husband and I ordered the large Chashu bowl with miso base and spicy pork fried rice to share. Let's start with the Chashu bowl- miso base soup was savory and hot. The noodles were also cooked well, not too soft just right (like al dente pasta). Like any of the reviews the Chashu could be softer, the type that melts in your mouth. However, there were 3 large slices of Chashu included in the bowl. So no complaints there. The spicy pork fried rice was a nice compliment to the ramen. Nothing special, but had a good kick of spice to add that bite while eating your ramen.   Definitely returning the next time I am in Vegas.",

I finally finished all the noodles with like 5 cups of water, but the leftover soup was too good to go to waste, so I took it home and ate it with rice. It was that good.

    "text": "There are a few distinct styles of Ramen those of which I am not well versed.  However I have been to Japan and the first thing I craved when I returned was Ramen, I know right?  Anywho if you question the statments above then go with Cup O Noodle if you don't then enjoy a True cup of ramen soup...   Before the days of Las Vegas Ramen I used to have to travel to LA to visit friends and OMG please EAT RAMEN!  (Feed Me!)  Now, in the newer days of Vegas Ramen the argument will continue of \"who is the best Ramen\"  I cannot answer this question but I will continue to eat some of them because I love those I choose for different reasons.   Ramen Sora let me list the ways I love you...  1. I love your noodles best, firm but not hard.  Extremly well hand made (the reason my boyfriend loves this place and I have grown to respect is the noodles, before him I would have never noticed the difference).  2. Cha Sui/ Char Sui Ramen depending on who you speak to these are two different    things but like I said I am not well versed enough to tell you that.  Yours is one piece of delightfully cooked, basically melts in your mouth but I wish I had more of you.  3. Shoyu (\"soy sauce\") ramen, love the broth however what I really want is not here but like I said I come here for reasons of its own as stated above but I am always satisfied whether it is Shoyu (\"soy sauce\"), Miso which involves a chicken/fish and strong salt base.  There is one more choice at this place but I have never ordered it so I cannot speak about it.   Last but not least is not at this restaurant so I will not continue.  A couple of other notes is I LOVE the corn butter ramen however my body does not.  So I order the corn butter ramen with extra nori (seaweed good for your skin and so much more), extra onion and hold the bamboo.  When it comes I take the butter out (I eat very little red meat and even less fried food and butter it has to be a special place to have me eat it!)  But not as much to make me sick.    I am always full satisfied and really really happy when I leave.  There may be a small wait depending on the night and sometimes there will be no wait.  It depends on the time of night and the night.  The most I have ever waited was 20 min, well worth the wait in my mind...",

Another of my friend got the mini curry bowl with a a order or gyoza.  The gyoza were too greasy for me and not crispy enough on the bottom but the mini curry bowl was good.

That won't stop me from going back, because I now understand COMPLETELY why people line up inside and outside!  :)  The food lived up to all the hype and I found myself craving it again within hours.  We started with gyoza and found them to be some of the best we've had.  I had the Miso Ramen and hubby had the Spicy Miso.  Both of us really loved the broth!  The noodles are amazing and the pork is spoon tender.  I was a bit unsure about the egg, but found that it added wonderful flavor.  Who woulda thunk?  The \"regular\" sized bowls are FILLING and way big enough for both hubby and I.    The table service is super friendly and FAST!  All in all, if we didn't live so freakin' far away, we'd be there 3-4 times a week!  As it is, we're determined to be back at least 1-2 a month.    Long live, Ramen Sora!!!",

Had the Screaming for Vengeance ramen. It's the spiciest ramen they offer and boy was it spicy!  The ramen was perfectly cooked with that slight chewiness, ramen broth was thick and savory. The char shiu pork was so tender.  The different broths are pretty high in sodium but what ramen isn't? I recall this place also offered a low sodium broth for those with dietary restrictions or for those not wanting to be swoll like a stuffed sausage trying to fit in that LBD for the club. I'll definitely be back if I'm not getting my pho fix down the street.",

Also ordered a miso ramen which was shared ( large bowl 1dollar more)  Service: server was helpful on how to order our bowls. He checked on us to see if we liked it and he kept our waters full.  Price: excellent - my large glass of Kirin was 5 bucks ( small was 3.50)  my chashu ramen was 9 bucks and it came with an egg. The large mission ramen was 7.50 but larger bowl added a dollar to it. Actually the regular size is good to share unless you're really hungry.  Definitely coming back here..parking lot was well lit at 10pm. Good lighting and Good music playing inside the restaurant.",

    "text": "I was sick and congested and wanted my cure-all for any illness: pho.  But my husband suggested ramen. What? No, I don't want a 30 cent cup of salt from Albertsons! I'm sick; take care of me!  Little did I know he was talking about real ramen, of which I had no knowledge.  We arrived around 8 and surprisingly there was a wait, but it wasn't too long. When we were seated, the waitress immediately asked what we wanted. I hadn't even looked at the menu yet!  I guess most people here are regulars and know what they want.  I decided on the deluxe ramen so I could try a little bit of everything. I got the miso base and my husband got the shio base.  One bite and it was like fireworks went off and angels starting singing! Ramen may be taking over pho as my favorite soup da loop.  The miso base is slightly creamy with such a flavorful burst.  It's everything I want pho to be after I add fish sauce, hoisin sauce, and soy....but I didn't have to add anything.  The pork in it fell apart like butter, the noodles were chewy, and the egg was a nice surprise that I was slightly wary of but ended up loving.  The shio base that my husband got reminded me of egg drop soup.  Less flavorful if you wanted to taste the meat more.  But what I really loved (and this is so stupid!) were the utensils! No cheap break apart chop sticks, no, there is a container of real chopsticks that are so pointy that they were the easiest chopsticks I've ever used.  The spoons have a lip so that the spoon doesn't fall in your soup and it has a notch near the spoon for resting on the bowl so you dont have to put it on the table.  Don't ask me why that impressed me so much.  I took off one star because of the service. Along with the immediate wanting to order, we had to hunt someone down for a water refill and our check after waiting a long time.",

    "text": "I am a HUGE ramen lover.  Like seriously, I could probably eat it everyday if it wasn't so high in sodium.  I just love the broth and chewy noodles.   I ordered the Spicy Ramen with miso base and it did not disappoint one bit.  The broth was very flavorful and savory.  I enjoyed each and every sip of the broth.  The chasu slices were fatty but not as tender as I would have preferred and the noodles were chewy but slightly overcooked in my opinion.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed my bowl of ramen and it definitely hit the spot after a long weekend of heavy drinking.  My boyfriend ordered the Corn Butter Ramen also with miso base and that one was also really good.  Butter?  In...ramen?!  It sounds truly odd but don't knock it till you try it.  It actually makes the broth creamier and it just works.  Don't question it.  And you can never go wrong with corn in your ramen.  I think this would be even better if they could make the miso base spicy!    Gyozas were just okay...it should've been pan fried a bit more.    Service wise....eh.  My friend had ordered the chasu bowl but they brought out a curry bowl instead.  When we told them that it was the wrong order, another server took it back and apologized for the mistake.  However, the server who took our orders came back to bring us our ramens but had a very mean look on her face.  After that, she never came back to check up on us even when all 4 of our water glasses were completely empty and we were just sitting there staring off into space because we had finished eating.  Not sure if she was upset about the order mix up or what, but her body language said alot.    Sooo overall, 4/5 for food but docking a star for the attitude from that one server.  I would definitely come back though to order a bowl of the butter corn ramen for myself.",

    "text": "Went with a big group for a friend's birthday.  We didn't make a reservation but put ourselves on the list around 6pm.  There was a little bit of a wait because the place was small but not too bad.  Parking can be hard too because their lot is on the smaller side.  I think it might be the smallest lot I've seen in Vegas for restaurants haha.  Service was good.  They brought us water and menus right away.  I ordered their special ramen.  A lot of my friends got it in a large because it was only 2 dollars more and the bowl is a lot bigger.  I was happy with mine though because I barely finished it.  The ramen was good.  Noodles were nice and soft and the broth was thick.  Not as rich and flavorful as I hoped it would be but it was decent.  Lacked some level of rick pork flavor though.  I don't want to give it a low review but I just think that i've had much better elsewhere.  This palce is really just OK with me.  This is my first time having ramen in Vegas...so I can't really say how this compares to other local spots.  Maybe after i try other places I'll update my review since i'll have a better comparison.  Beer is a good deal at this place...I think a pitcher is for 11 bucks?  We ordered 2 and had a great time.  We didn't order much appetitzers except the gyoza.  It was yummy...like all the other restaurants hahha.  Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  I tried my friend's spicy ramen and it wasn't too bad.  They just add some spice to the miso paste.  The spicy ground beef was good but wasn't too spicy either.  I usually order no spice with my ramen because I love the rich flavor of the pork broth but since the broth wasn't spectacular, I asked for chili oil to make it better.  I would definitely go back to this place again and give other ramen places a try but if every place in vegas is like this..i don't think I'll be craving ramen all that much.",

    "text": "Ramen Sora has become my go to place for Ramen. Yes, I choose Ramen Sora over Monta any day. Why? Well first even when Ramen Sora is busy you only have to wait about 20 minutes give or take a few. This is far better than Monta's wait times. Second, the atmosphere is Ramen Sora is more preferred over Monta's cramped, crowded, and extremely loud atmosphere. While at Ramen Sora I have never felt rushed and have always had friendly servers that kept my water filled and made sure I enjoyed my meal. Lastly, I have never had to play the hide and seek parking game that you have to endure when you go to Monta. Ramen Sora has plenty of parking around the back and even if that becomes full there are spaces available to park on the side street. Now as far as the ramen goes, the broth is a rich and creamy pork broth that is bursting with flavor. I always order the Miso Ramen that comes with slices of pork, bamboo shoots, and a soft boiled egg on top of a bed of noodles. Prices are fantastic here and you can always add extra toppings or supersize your bowl for only a few extra dollars. Also they have Kirin on draft for cheap! a large 24 oz is only $5. Pair your hot bowl of ramen with a large draft for an exceptional dining experience!",

The pork chasu is so juicy and tender, it just melts in your mouth. I can't find any other ramen place that can come close to Ramen Sora. If I can give 10 stars then I would.",

So far, no one compares to Sora. The noodles are thick and hearty, the broth always full of flavor. The best thing that no other restaurant compares to, though, is the chashu. I don't know what this place does that's so different, but it's a thicker cut of pork, and is so tender, one little poke of your chopstick, and it crumbles. The fat on the pork belly actually melts in your mouth when you eat it. It's incredible.",

I have been to a couple of other Ramen places here in Vegas, which were HIGHLY recommended to us by our friends and we found them to be eh, average (so my response to that was..what was all the hype about guys?...waited in a long ass line for this?!?) And, by far Ramen Sora blows them out of the water (my opinion). My husband and I frequent this place often (sometimes date nights) along with our kids (and, will make the extra trip to bring out - of - town guests to this establishment, just so we can have an excuse to go).  We always order the Miso Ramen with curry and bean sprouts (Why fix what's not broken?)The consistency of curry makes the broth just right! Hearty and slightly thick. Just talking about this dish is making my mouth salivate. You can never go wrong with this dish! I wish I could eat ten bowls!!  So, give your other Ramen places a break and give Ramen Sora a try. You will not find fancy decor or anything flashy. You are here to eat not to gawk at patterns of wallpaper on the wall. They have a great staff - very friendly. And, the prices are reasonable.",

They opened on time and seated us right away. I could see why there was lines of people: it's a small restaurant.   I ordered the Chashu ramen and it came out quickly. It was presented nice, so I took a picture. But I was under the impression that we would get fresh food but the first piece of meat I bit into was COLD. I mean, we got there early, why would the food be cold? I really wanted to enjoy the food so I didn't say anything since the rest of the meat was hot. The broth  was great, it was probably my favorite part of the dish. But, I've had better ramen. It was mediocre at best.  The price and food wasn't terrible so I might be willing to try again but then again, I don't like being disappointed twice.",

There were 2 tables which seated 4 people being occupied by only 1 person along with only 2 people being seated at a 4 seat table. Simple elementary organizational skills would have alleviated a 45 min wait. They lacked leadership and the ability to arrange seating to maximize the restaurant capacity. The young man from Japan who took our order was a good kid but forgot several things. A simple fix is have a trained and experienced host to solve the wait issue. Looks like we'll have to go there on historically off hours.  Enjoy!",

Even though it was 9pm on a Tuesday night they were packed and we had about a 45 minute wait.  Once we were seated however they were quick to get our orders and the food came out fast, hot, and delicious!  I can see why they are so popular.   Definitely a place I want to return.",

While it looks beautiful, the few times I went just didn't impress me. The shoyu soup base was lacking in complexity and tasted a little basic. Also I like when the egg in ramen is a little runny but usually here it's pretty hard boiled. The chashu is great, melts in the mouth like butter. I would go back for the vibe of the location for a quick lunch as their service is very fast.",

I wouldnt be surprise if their kitchen staff is a part of the scam. Their backdoor was open, probably working as spotter. We asked ramen sora to review their security tape and they told us that it doesnt work or we could have got the license plate of the culprit. We reviewed the security camera from the restaurant behind them. Again, i am pretty sure ramen sora has a one or multiple staff in on this. Too well coordinated and happens too many times...n security camera still off at the right time",

I would honestly label it as a budget friendly ramen place. Don't let the great prices fool you, the taste is pretty spot on. Their small size Deluxe Sora Ramen really made me feel full borderline bloated and I'm a big dude. Their chashu pork is a melts in your mouth experience.   The place looks a little run down but has adequate space. Speedy service and attentive waitresses.   To be honest, the only reason why I didn't give this place a full 5 is because I prefer a different place. Other than that, there's no reason for you to not visit / like this place.

It says the broth has been boiling for a day and you can tell. Definitely go for the miso base!  The nori, egg, and bamboo shoots I got in the Deluxe Sora Ramen were delicious as well.  The noodles are good, not the best but not bad. They're a bit on the thicker side and have a great bite to them! They're also very generous with the portion.  The pork chashu is really what was disappointing. The pork pieces they gave me was basically just fat. It was really hard to eat. I wanted some pieces of leaner meat to eat with the already fatty broth, but they didn't give me any.  It gets CROWDED in here so be prepared to wait. Otherwise, staff is really nice and it's definitely worth a try if you're in Vegas.",

The noodles were still great, and the meat was delicious, but the saltiness of the broth just ruined the bowl for me. My date had the spicy shoyu ramen, which tasted great. We also had the gyoza, which is highly recommended. I wanted to give the place a lower rating because of the salty miso ramen, but I'm chucking it up to a bad batch or a bad day.

    "text": "My roots have ramen (or saimin) listed as my Number 1 comfort food. On cold wintry days, on days when you're not feeling well, on days when your night turned into day, on simply any day! I can enjoy a great bowl of ramen.  So here is my story. Enjoying Las Vegas waiting for the imfamous Super Bowl Sunday, I somehow forgot that word \"rest\" or \"sleep\"... and my night turned into day.... Not wanting to wait in line for any restaurant in the casino, I get in my car and head OUT....    Onto Spring Mountain Blvd I head into the Las Vegas Chinatown.  HUGE GIGANTIC sign! RAMEN SORA  RED AND BLUE NEON SIGN  \"open\"  open OPEN.  All I want is a regular bowl of ramen please, miso broth, extra nori, no egg, green onions please.... OH WAIT. and I'd like a Kirin please!  Oh! A small order of gyoza (small order = 6 pieces)  Broth tasty! HOT! Steamy Hot! The way all ramen bowls should be served. And the noodles? OMG... if there is such a thing as al dente chewy! (exactly as I like it) is what I got.    Of all the ramen shops on Spring Mountain  Blvd.? This is a definite must try.   Note: depending on the time and day you try to dine - you might have a wait period... I assume that because of the sign in sheet as well as the chairs in the waiting area....",

We only came here because I wanted to taste it so I could compare it to all the other ramen joints and also because we figured it would have the least amount of wait time out of all ramen places..  We still had to wait about 20-30 minutes.. Even though there were tables available.   We had an order of gyoza and the deluxe miso ramen & deluxe shio ramen..  The gyoza was not good to me it had a weird almost iodine taste to it..  The miso broth was nice.. very deep and creamy..way better than any other miso broth I've tasted.. also I did like the chashu.. very melt in your mouth good and they don't skimp out on it in their deluxe ramen..  I liked the chewy consistency of the noodles but personally, I am more of a fan of thinner noodles.. My ramen also had that same weird taste to it.. I think it was the taste of the menma.. So I must not like the taste of their bamboo... & The tamago didn't really have any seasoned taste to it.. The service was not good at all.. Our waitress never checked up on us.. She never even refilled my water. BOO!  So as of now Ramen Sora is at the bottom of my list~ Sorry SORA, My cousin's name is Sora, HAHA but you need to step up your game. ;ppp  If I come back here I will probably get the miso ramen with no menma & no tamago but with extra chashu and hopefully the service will be better~!!!",

    "text": "I saw the talk thread on this and decided to swing by here after work for a quick dinner.  I got the spicy miso ramen bowl.  It was very tasty, but not spicy.  The ramen noodles were nicely cooked.  Very hot broth, which I hear is a requirement.  The broth was also very tasty, but fatty.  It's pork based (by boiling black pork bones, to be specific) and I could see the oil floating in it.  But that's not a bad thing.  The ramen came with two pieces of pork, an egg, green onions... there was some ginger in there... it was hard for me to identify all the goodness.  The pork was so delicious.  The egg was perfectly cooked.  The thing I like best is that it was not as salty as Monta.  I didn't wake up in the middle of the night to chug a gallon of water.  Oh, and their spoons have little notches that keep them from falling into your soup.  It's the little things that count with me.  I also tried Kurogoma dango for dessert which was mochi balls stuffed with red bean paste and rolled in black sesame.  Three for $2.  Delicious!  It was about half full when I went - pretty good for opening night.  Service was fast and friendly.  I also like their hours, 11:30am to 11:00pm everyday - very convenient and easy to remember.  It's close to my work and I like that I can get a ramen craving at 3pm and get it taken care of.  Four stars for now because they don't serve beer yet.  Ramen without beer can be a little depressing.  But they have Sapporo listed on the menu, Sapporo glasses, and Sapporo paraphernalia all over the place, so it's only just a matter of time.  Also, if my husband gives it his seal of approval, I'll bump it up - beer or no beer.  Looking forward to many visits to this great find. Thanks Mike H. for starting the talk thread on this!",

    "text": "Ramen noodles are thicker and chewier; shio broth is flavorful but not too salty; the chashu is generous compared to most, if not all, of the local Las Vegas competition. Good reason to come back for more, not to mention that the wait staff are friendly and will get the answers to the questions you ask about the food and restaurant, if they don't know the answer.  I dropped by Ramen Sora after seeing the new signage on Spring Mountain Rd, and was waiting for it to finally be opened.  What can I say, I love ramen to the point that I actually went to a Ramen Museum while visiting Japan with friends I met during college. I have developed a certain personal preference for what I considered great ramen, and the thinker noodles served here is one of those pluses in my ramen critique formula.  The broth has good flavor without being overly greasy or too salty.  The chashu is pretty good, almost melt-in-your mouth tender, and the portions served in my Deluxe Ramen was more generous than the competition.  Although the overall portion is on the smallish side for me, and I definitely need to pay the nominal fee for the extra noodles.  Or order one of the side rice bowls.  Anyway, they seemed to be off to a decent start, already earning 4.5 stars on 7 reviews on Yelp in the first 2-3 days of opening.  The staff is friendly and the service is quick.  I definitely would recommend this ramen restaurant, which is their first US store to open, making this an international ramen chain with two more locations in Sapporo, Japan (Hokkaido area). Being a Sapporo-style ramen-ya, their miso ramen is a definite must try, since it originated there and uses akamiso (red soybean paste).  Food:  4/5  The best, or the top two ramen option in Las Vegas.  Service:  5/5  Friendly, not too pushy, and attentive.  Value:  4/5  Generous with the chashu, but the regular bowl of ramen is not that large.  I definitely need to exercise the kaedama (extra noodle) option.  Location:  Not too far from the Strip on Spring Mountain Road.  Parking:  3/5  Private lot, but it is not that big.  But there are usually street parking if the lot is full.  Repeat visit probability:  Fairly high",

    "text": "Konichiwa!!!!  Hello my ninjas!!   The location for Ramen Sora is not hard to find.  There's adequate parking and also street parking on the side if the parking lot gets full.  The parking structure could get complicated though because of the way the lines are lined up.    On to the food, during my second visit here I came by myself since I was on my way home from a friends house.  Service this time around was lacking.  At one point I made it look like I had fangs with my chopsticks while waiting for someone to come by and ask me if I wanted dessert or my check.  But the service was impressive the first time around.  What happenedddd?    During this solo visit I had the extra large Miso Ramen (additional $2 will get you extra).  After I killed the ramen in my bowl I asked if I could get extra noodles on the side (think Monta) but I forgot that they didn't do it like that so I asked if I can have a regular Shio.  They looked at me funny like I was speaking to them in Hawaiian.  5 mins later they came back and asked if I really ordered a second ramen bowl for here and not to go.  More waiting.  The broths for both ramen bowls is night and day.  If you like your broth flavorful and thick then go with the miso ramen.  If you like your broth clear and light then go with the shio.  Fair warning though, the broth is greasy.  I have to dip my spoon down deep and blow the top of the broth to clear the grease when I scoop up.    The one thing that bothers me is the same small window where they serve food and pass dirty dishes.    But after killing my second ramen bowl I decided to get the kurogoma dango for two bucks.  It was good.  But sitting around and playing with my chopsticks seemed to work for getting their attention.  And mind you there was only 3 other tables occupied at the time.  No excuse for crap service.  I didn't even get the extra chashu that I ordered, but at least I wasn't charged for it.    Overall good food.  Will definitely come back as there's a lot more room in here than at Monta, if the wait is rediculously long.",

    "text": "Sora is my place for the \"Shio Ramen.\"  I've tried their Butter-Corn Ramen which is shio based soup, and it was very good and authentic Hokkaido style.  However, for their Miso Ramen, which is another traditional Sapporo (Hokkaido) style soup, I've had better ones in my days.  I can actually make a better one myself.  Cha-shu was very thick and not very tender, but it tastes good and it's homemade; so, I don't mind that.  Everyone has their own style of making cha-shu, and I have fun trying them all.  I love pork. LoL    I also like spicy food, so, on one occasion I was brave enough to try their \"Spicy Killer Ramen.\"  It looks awfully good in the menu, but it sounds like a soup made from habanero, so I was always reluctant to try it.  I asked the waitress how spicy it is, and she said very, very, very spicy.  'Is it more spicy than kimchee?' I asked.  She replied 'It's much, much more spicy.\"  So, I got the idea.  She recommended me ordering a regular size, but, I went with the large size sho-yu base.  The killer ramen came to the table, and it looks very appetizing, and it smells good.  Before I dug into it, I sipped and tasted the soup.  It was delicious!  But..., made my eyes tear.  The level of \"spicy\" was way off my scale.  The bad part was that it tastes good.  I thought it was their best ramen there.  I just couldn't quit!  I finished it all and drank more than a half of the soup.  The guy sitting right in front of me was just cracking up watching me tear and sweat and suffering from the torture.  Yes, I knew..., I knew I was going to regret it the next day in the bathroom.  That \"Spicy Killer\" probably is not your best choice to eat during the summer season.  It would probably taste even better during the winter season.  So, try if you dare. LoL",

After having phenomenal ramen in the Bay area, I was curious about how Vegas would compare. Luckily, at least here at Ramen Sora, it's high quality and delicious and really hits the spot. The broth especially just totally makes it here.  Got the deluxe sora ramen, regular size, miso, for my first visit. BF isn't a fan, so he got the large curry bowl. His came out first, and it was just right- large portion for the price ($6.50), flavors were spot on and it was definitely comfort food. He inhaled the dish. My broth was rich and delish, the chashu pork plentiful and flavorful, and the bamboo, nori, and egg really complemented one another. Noodles were plentiful and nicely chewy, but slightly thinner than expected, given that someone told me they were thick? Guess we have different expectations. I am bummed that I only get half of a (usually overcooked) egg in my ramen here.  EDIT: have returned for both the spicy ramen and the nori ramen. Can't rave enough about the nori one, which is the most unique one I've tried so far. The spicy version will clear out your congestion in no time flat, perfect when you're feeling under the weather.",

They have a bit of a kink to them as opposed to the thin and straight ramen noodles I am used to.  They also don't have the strong egg aroma of the usual ramen house ramen.  Broth is good but there is not much else here if you arent in the mood for ramen.  Otherwise good, rumor has it the extra spicy ramen is not for those who cannot handle their spice....those who claim to tolerate hot have trouble as well - caution!",

We ordered the deluxe sora ramen, otsumami platter, pork fried rice, gyoza and curry bowl. It is one of the best ramen place in town. Otsumami, pork fried rice and curry bowl were very tasty! Not a big fan of their gyoza.   We will definitely come back if we are in town.  We were starving and forgot to take pictures of other food.",

Most places don't do the salt ramen and those that do, usually over salt, to the point of not wanting it anymore. While not as good as I've had in multiple cities in Japan. It was delivered with the greatest enjoyment I've had stateside. Service was great. Line out the door busy. Still having polite service with perfect presentation.",

I got the basic ramen bowl with extra pork in a miso broth , it was excellent,  very flavorful noodles and the perfect balance of flavors in broth not too salty . The pork is an amazing compliment to the dish , it was a little fatty but I loved it !! I also had the gyoza and the charsu pork bowl , the gyoza are little bites of heaven with a pork and veggie mix, the pork bowl was wonderful start but that was a bit too salty but nonetheless great . My friend had the butter bowl with a soy sauce broth and I will definitely be back to try that next time , he said it was excellent!! All in all a great visit and for two people with two apps, two bowls and two soft drinks it was 32$ . We left with full bellies !!",

The broth and noodles were delicious however the pork chashu was extremely fatty-like falling apart in my ramen. So if mouthfuls of fat are your thing you may enjoy it. The egg and corn added were served cold and the corn tasted like it was old. The bamboo shoots were also a bit hard. I wouldn't come back",

    "text": "I seriously loved the ramen more than most places. The miso broth is pretty thick and flavorful, one might consider it a meal on its own. I ordered the super size sora bowl with a mini pork bowl for a side. All together this meal ranged about $15.   First the ramen was a curlier type noodle that most ramen spots do not use but i absolutely loved it. The curls gave this texture to the bite that made every mouthful a pleasant. The fatty pork belly literally melted off the cutlet into strips which made it easy to grab and boy was the meat soooo flavorful, i haven't had such good pork in ramen in quite some time. the veggies that came in my bowl were perfectly matched and accompanied the authentic ramen very well.  the mini bowl was $2 and had loads of meat in it. I really cant stress enough how much food you get for the price, not to mention the taste. I really like this spot and is the best when you're near.  if you're in Las Vegas gambling please take a break and come here.",

Ramen Sora has officially become a go-to ramen joint! I love how they have a large menu with various choices with their ramen bowls as well as their side options. Like many ramen places, it is quite small, so anticipate for a little wait. But once you're seated, service is really quick and they're very attentive!!   So far my favorite is their Spicy Miso with corn. Ahhhh, so freaking good with the right amount of spice. (Not too spicy!!) I forgot which other ramen bowl I've tried but I've noticed that all of their bowls are so good. I would try whatever my friends get and I'm excited to try more. Their broth is so rich and their noodles are perfectly cooked. Absolutely love the flavor! I definitely recommend to try them out!",

Ramen Sora was insane. I can't remember what time we arrived, but I'm thinking it was around 6:30 and there were already a million people waiting in their tiny lobby area. By the time we were seated nearly an hour later, I was ready to eat the table!  I had the shio ramen and a mini chashu bowl (see, I told you I was starving!). I think the serving size of ramen here is a little on the small side (possibly because I was starving). I think they have three sizes - regular, large and extra large. Unless you are a light eater or you're going to get something else, I would probably go with the large next time. Their ramen was pretty good and I really like the chashu. Actually, I think they were rationing their chashu because my dad tried to order the chashu ramen and was told they don't have it today.   There are actually several decent ramen places in Vegas now and apparently they're all crazy packed. So yummy on a cold day!",

I guess your change in taste evolve as time passes. Who knows. Anyway, I ordered their nori ramen with shoyu broth and added a slice of butter. The broth was flavorful but not too rich, just how I like it. The butter added extra creaminess. The noodles were thicker and chewier compared to other spots, which I like as well. My favorite part was that the chasu wasn't all fat. I know I'm probably the only one who doesn't like the fat, call me strange. I just prefer more meat. I think next time I'll opt for the $1 charge and upgrade to the larger size. All in all, solid ramen spot and for sure I'll be back in the future.   P.S. Only reason why I didn't give a 5 star ration was due to the fact that we felt rushed to pay.",

He said the chashu was one of the best he has had.   I got the spicy miso and it was the perfect amount of spicy! Everything was so delicious! The slice of pork I got was way too salty tho, and that was my only negative.   Beware: this place is pretty small so not ideal for big parties!

I sometimes start drinking all of the soup before I even get to the noodles. Ugh their food is just heaven.   You can order a larger size of the ramen which is significantly more for only $1.00!  I do like ordering it to go and enjoying it at home more. But, the ambience inside is wonderful as well. It's really small and personal.

I had the spicy miso with extra chasu, because who doesn't love extra helping of fatty pork.  The broth had a nice flavor but a little on the greasy side, edge Monta.  All in all, a good meal with a friendly staff.  Misses are the small menu.  Which isn't a big deal in Asia, but westerners generally prefer more variety. Secondly, the broth was a hair on the greasy side.",

    "text": "Tried their shio ramen along with a side order of curry rice.  After sitting down, order was taken quickly, and my hot tea was topped off three times before my meal arrived.  From there, things started going downhill a bit.  I had to move myself to a different spot on the table because it was so dark, I couldn't see what was in my bowl.    The first sip of a bowl of ramen did not trigger all those wonderful memories of good ramen experiences.  For a shio ramen, the broth was definitely lighter in texture, not unlike cup noodle soup.  I know they say it's stock from over 24 hours of boiling black pork bones.  But the taste is definitely infused with too concentrated tastes of a variety of vegies.  And the after taste hung around too long on the palates, not like the deep seated after taste from savory fats, but from something more like MSG, or concentrated condiments.  If shio ramen is oil painting, I believe they served water colors.  My tongue was confused, and thirsty from the soup, and now that I needed tea, it stopped coming.  The high notes of vegies did not stop there.  The curry curiously had a strong carrot and tomato paste taste, unlike any Japanese curry.  At the end, I had to ask the waitress, is the chef Japanese?  Like all foods made with instant condiments, or chemicals, it actually \"tastes\" pretty good.  I do not have any evidence that their food didn't go through long hours of preparation so if I have offended anyone, particularly owner or chef, I do apologize.  But I do challenge that in the tradition of a good ol' bowl of ramen, the convenience of offering customers, hey if you think it's too light we have stuff to make it heavier, or if too heavy, we have stuff to thin it down, etc perhaps is too wishy washy.  Take a stance on Ramen Sora's take of what a shio ramen should taste like and present us with That.",

    "text": "Finally, We've got other ramen restaurant other than Monta, (personally I do not consider Anime Ramen as a ramen restaurant, I haven't been there and I actually do not wanna visit). I visited twice and this place is crowded, but the dining area is spacious and I like the confortable area. I also like Monta's environment, it's small and feels like a traditional japanese ramen shop, but I hate it when you seats near the entrance and those who are waiting will stand next to the dining area, it make me uncomfortable if I were seat there. I've tried the Shio, Spicy Miso, Pork Fried Rice w/ house special sauce, Premium Pork ChaShu and Kurogoma dango. The first visit of my Shio ramen was totally tasteless, I am not a fan of heavy seasoning, so the ramen soup is almost no favour at all, but the Spicy Miso was good. I also ordered Kurogoma dango with my girlfriend, it looks pretty but not really like it. I ordered the Pork Fried Rice w/ house special sauce, Premium Pork ChaShu, and Shio ramen on my second visit. The Shio was pretty good, much better than my previous visit, but they forgot the order of my extra egg. My girlfriend and I love the premium chashu, they are delicious but also expensive $3.98 for 2 pieces!? I was like \"are you kidding me?\" anyway, the pork fried rice was just ok, it's tasteless and I like monta's fried rice better and i was kinda curious of the house special sauce because my server told me its just grave sauce, but I didnt taste any grave in the fried rice. Maybe the grave is supposed to put on top and they forgot. The menu of Ramen Sora is meaningless, it looks like they got a lot of choices, but if you pay attention and you will find out that they only have FOUR different ramen with TWO different soup bases. if you order the Shio ramen and add the topping of green onion it became Negi ramen. it applies to all the others. its really not a necessary put to different ramen with each toppings on the menu. I found i like monta better",

    "text": "Rating: 3.5/5.  Satisfied my craving for ramen for a pretty nice price but I have had better. I'm picky about my noodles!  I ate at this restaurant coming back from a day trip coming back from Zion National Park to Las Vegas where I was staying since I didn't want to eat another $50 dinner on the strip.   The first impression: the restaurant is small, very busy, and service a bit slow. I got there starving and was seated within 15 minutes after signing in on a clipboard. The food took a bit to come out since I ordered miso base soup and they had run out since it was popular. I noticed that there a quite a few locals/repeat customers who come to this area so I was feeling good about my impromptu choice.   The food: I ordered the regular deluxe combo bowl (the one blown up on the menu with all the fixings) and a mini curry char siu bowl. Compared to NY ramen bowls, this place is not bad, but not the best either. The (miso) base of the deluxe #1 ramen is creamy and rich but a bit salty for me. The noodles were kind of soft for me (I prefer them chewy) but maybe my noodles were slightly overcooked. And the char siu was very tough and overcooked on the lean portion, although I appreciated how much meat I got for a $10 bowl. I also really like the small tapas-style \"mini bowls\" you can order - around $4 for a mini char siu curry bowl and rice was not bad in my opinion.  Overall my craving for Asian was satisfied eating here.",

    "text": "If I go a week without Ramen Sora I begin to have painful and longing withdrawals. This has become my favorite little place with the best and most delicious ramen l've ever tasted.  If you come down to this little hut in Chinatown, prepare yourself for at least a 20-30 minute wait. Of all the times I've been to Ramen Sora I've had to wait (especially during the lunch and dinner rush) except for the time I came at 10:00pm. (By the way last seating is 10:30) BUT DONT LET THAT STOP YOU!!! This ramen is WELL worth the wait.  To my fellow vegetarians, there is no True \"vegetarian\" ramen available here. Although, if you don't mind having pork broth, you will still enjoy it. If you're picky then order yourself some fried rice no pork (still yummy, but you're missing out). If you don't mind the pork broth, make sure to ask for no chashu, the little pork bits.  Now on to the food. I always get the same thing. And no, it is not repetitive nor is it boring. I get the corn butter ramen, miso broth, no meat no chashu. Hands down, the best, most amazing, most decadent ramen you'll ever taste. Im so happy with my choice that I've never ventured off to the shoyu broth. If you want spicy, the lovely waitresses will bring you chile oil and sriracha.  UPDATE: I have now ventured and tried both the shoyu and the shio broth. The miso is the strongest flavor in my opinion and the texture is creamy and delightful. Still my favorite but now o go without the butter. :)  If you are in Vegas and you don't mind waiting a bit for excellent food and great service, stop by Ramen Sora and get yourself some awesomeness in the form of miso ramen.  As they say at Ramen Sora, \"No Ramen, No life!\"",

    "text": "Can a bowl of soup be life changing?  Yes it can.  I am an absolute sucker for a bowl of legit ramen. Unfortunately it's impossible to find in the part of the country where I currently live. More than that, most people around here don't even realize ramen is a thing beyond the cheap instant noodles. But I digress...  Much like most of the places I ate on a recent work trip to Vegas, I picked Ramen Sora based on reading reviews on Yelp. I'm so very glad I did.  The restaurant is incredible. The soup is superb. The pork broth, all thick and marrowy, is beyond compare. The slices of pork in the soup melt in your mouth, and I don't mean in that in the figurative sense. I mean that if you were to live in some culinary fantasy land where you could cross breed a pig and a stick of butter, this is the texture its meat would be. They aren't stingy with the portions at all... unless you're downright starving or sharing with someone, ordering a large is completely unnecessary.  You people who are local to this restaurant need to thank your lucky stars; I'd honestly pay $50 for a bowl of their ramen if I could have it here.",

If you order the regular, it would've been fine. The pork tasted really good and the egg was cooked very well. If you want something a little more salty, the soy based soup would be best to get. I'd come back here again. It was a nice stop on a cold night.",

    "text": "For a hot bowl of noodly soup, Ramen Sora is a pretty solid choice.  Me?  I'm used to eating Top Ramen for 10 cents a bag, and adding toppings like boiled egg, green onion, and Tabasco to make it my own.  I ate the crap out of cheap ramen when I was in college and I still take a trip down memory lane every once in a while and indulge in a heaping bowl of Top Ramen.  Until recently reading it can cause cancer!  What the Hell doesn't cause cancer?  Ramen Sora was a good (but decidedly pricy) alternative to the miracle in a tiny plastic pouch.  I like the place - small, quaint, close, cozy (we could hear our neighbors talking about their dog ha ha), pretty comfortable.  If you don't mind a lack of privacy then Ramen Sora will suit you nicely.  On a cool night, some warm broth was on order for the wifey and I.  Wifey is like many others, \"What is the deal with a bowl of noodles?\"  She doesn't get it, but didn't mind going along for the meal anyway.  I myself have delved deep into the psyche of the bowl of noodles.  The broth - how it should represent a culmination of the land & the sea.  The noodles - how they should create just the perfect 'slurp' sound when sucking them down.  The chasiu - how the fattiness should infuse the soup with its...PORK.  OK, OK, I admittedly watched a snippet of 'The Ramen Girl' and went along with it.  But yes my friends, there are those out there that take their bowl of ramen seriously.  Didn't bubble your broth all day long?  Forget it.  Didn't use pork bones from a Kurobuta pig?  Psssshhhhh.  No green onion from the Hokkaido prefecture?  Uh-uh!  I admire all that goes into making that perfect bowl of ramen but damn, I'm not gonna go all preachy about it!  Just let a guy eat!  Thankfully, the folks at Ramen Sora did just that.  Wifey got the Deluxe Sora Miso Ramen.  Honestly?  She ended up not liking it much.  I had to make her understand that a miso broth would probably be pretty salty, especially if you're sensitive to it.  Which she is.  The noodles for her were different as well.  Had to tell her for different broths come different styles of noodles.  Her noodles were a bit thicker than what she was used to in a bowl of noodles.  She did like the pork because it was tender and juicy, but refrained from finishing all the slices because they were a tad too fatty.  Which overall made her bowl of ramen not just salty in her taste buds, but too rich as well.  Wifey only managed to finish about half her bowl.  Yay...more leftovers for me!  I had the Shoyu Ramen in a large so I could have an extra helping of noodles.  Big bowl!  For me, the broth was good - rich but not thick, flavorful but not overly salty.  I did overall like the broth but I was wishing for a more porky undertone.  The ramen noodles were excellent, very slurpable, great texture and chew, good flavor.  Cooked just right and not soggy.  I just about finished the entire bowl.  I do only wish that I had more chasiu in mine, as well as a bigger serving of menma too (pickled bamboo shoots).    We also got a side order of their house gyoza.  That stuff was killer, on point!  Chewy skin, crunchy on the bottom, healthy amount of pork filling.  Very tasty, very dippable!  5 pieces for under $4, not badly priced.  Good accompaniment to our bowls of ramen!  Will probably be back again soon now that we're in winter mode, and I'm sure the wifey will probably pick a different broth in her ramen.  I myself did like the shoyu flavor and will just opt for a deluxe with more meat, and also an extra helping of noodles.  Then again I keep hearing there are a handful of great ramen places in town now so maybe we'll hit them up for a try.  No Ramen...No Life!  Did Brittany Murphy say that in the movie??",

Our Aunt laughed when one of our cousins told her where we ate, bc typically, they think \"Top Ramen\" where they add an egg at the end of the cooking process-- sooo not the same as this.  You first start off by choosing what type of broth you want: Miso, Shoyu (soy sauce) or Shio (I forgot what this one is bc I don't get it) based. From there it's a choice of more fillers- noodles, scallions, pork, etc. The noodles are chewy and full of flavor and go great w/ my choice of soup: Shoyu Ramen. You have the choice of regular and large size, I usually get the regular and my hubs gets the large. We also place an order for gyoza.   This is our favorite Ramen place in town, gets me through not being able to go to our fav spot in SD. ;)",

I also ordered a large sake.   The broth was delicious the noodles were perfect. Wasn't a fan of the chasu it was too much fat for me ( that's my preference though) I loved the light spice to the spicy miso. It was very satisfying..  The reason why it's 4 stars instead of 5 is my BF went to go to the restroom and while he was gone the waitress snatched our bowls up without asking and we still had a lot of broth left! We wanted to finish the broth together and by the time I could say something she was already walking away!! Ask first! I know there's a line of people waiting, I get it but give my BF enough time to come back so we can quickly finish our broth. He came back with his bowl gone and was upset.   So if we come back I guess we have to chug the whole thing down quickly before she takes our bowl? Idk I may choose another restaurant for that reason next time.  Food was great but taking our unfinished bowls without asking was a big NO NO.",

Ramen noodle tasted a little firm just in the way I like it to serve. Chef was pretty generous when serving ramen with chasu. (each bowl came with 3 pieces of chasu) I personally like their soup base a lot better than Monta. (Monta's soup base is too salty to me) I also tried their Gyoza.

I think the broth is perfectly flavored, noodles are nice and a little chewy, and the pork and veggies are great.  The best thing for me is that the soup comes out piping hot.  I know everyone has there own opinion, but Ramen Sora is my spot for ramen in Vegas.",

    "text": "Finally got to try Ramen Sora this evening and the food is good! I ordered the deluxe shio ramen while the wife tried the miso ramen. We also shared a mini chashu bowl (omg!) which is very tender and perfectly sized for an entree. The ramen broth is very rich and savory, typical Sapporo style (a friend pointed out to me that Sapporo gets tons of snow and people need fatty, heavy stuff when there's a blizzard outside), and the noodles were cooked perfectly firm absorbing the broth's flavor just so. Since I opted for the deluxe, my ramen is lined with extra slices of the tender-buttery chashu (pork belly), a good heaping of nori, negi, bamboo shoots, and half a soft-boiled egg. As an added surprise, we were glad to see a familiar server (Hi Mimi!) from the now closed Brian's Beach Sushi an AYCE we used to frequent. Definitely going back to this joint to try the rest of what the menu has to offer.",

I live in San Francisco and in the Bay Area we have a ton of great ramen, but I hadn't tried out the options in Vegas much until this previous trip and Ramen Sora is the real deal!  I tried the Miso Ramen and the Spicy Miso Ramen and both were delish.  I also added chasu to both b/c their chasu is ridiculously tender and tastes amazing.  Check out David N's review for more details since he goes into great detail.  The gyoza I had was great with the nicely crisp bottoms and the meat was juicy and the sauce had the perfect amount of zesty tang.

Their slices of chashu are thin, tender, buttery pieces of roasted pork, atop a savory miso flavored broth filled with just the right amount of ramen noodles (actually a little too much for me, but I managed to scarf it all down).  Somebody wanted to know which place I liked better--Sora or Monta.  Well, I like certain things about each, but I think I would head to Sora more often because of a number of things--easy parking, friendly servers, more seating options for 2+ groups so it's faster to get in, love the broth/ramen/chashu a touch more than the other.  And, yes, I'm an actual  reviewer, I don't work at the competition!",

Me and my coworker ventured here on a hot summer day because oddly, some ramen sounded like a much needed comfort food at that moment. And it fulfilled its promises of homeyness and solace in a bowl. The regular sized ramen was more than enough for me. I ordered an extra serving of bean sprouts because that's how I roll. Service was a bit absent. It was almost like a turn and burn type of feel from the staff. I didn't observe any socializing or interaction above the order taking. But the food quickly made up for it. As soon as it was dropped on our table, my friend and I did little talking ourselves. Even with it being steaming hot, we still devoured our noodles. The soup base was not overwhelming and carried enough flavor to spread its love to the noodles. I tried to eat it all ladylike and proper but after my first bite, I chomped and slurped away. Not my finest moment but it was worth it. And the prices for the regular bowl is normal at $8. I will definitely have to stop by and try the other options they have on the menu. Just an FYI, this place is small and has about 8 tables and one community table and with delicious food being served, it does get busy so be prepared. The YELP app tells you how long the wait it's always a good idea to check that out first before heading down.",

I had the No.1 deluxe Sora ramen $10.25 with the shoyu base (soy sauce). In my opinion it was a little on the salty side. And when something is salty and you keep eating it, it just gets saltier. So that kind of bummed me out. It wasn't the best ramen I've had but it was the worst. We came here on a Saturday around 4pm and we definitely beat the rush. You can sign in on yelp to be on the waitlist. I'll definitely want to try this place again to try their other items such as the curry bowl, fried rice, gyoza and chashu bowl.

It's small place so I can see this place getting slammed so plan ahead.  When we walked in there was a sign in sheet which in convenient.  Great service, great food, why not go again.

The staff wastes no time with getting you seated and your ramen to your table asap.  Everyone moves with a sense of urgency to increase the covers served.  Sora's Ramen:  The menu makes it easy to build your ramen bowl and my favorite is the Deluxe Sora Ramen and I'll add extra chasu and extra egg.  It's #1!  All the ingredients are fresh and they don't skimp on the noodles or the extras in the ramen.  FYI. The broths here are a little saltier than you'd typically come across.  Nothing extreme at all and I enjoy it, but it may not be for everyone.  The gyozu here is tasty and you can't go wrong with any of the rice bowls.  Sora ambiance: Decor is traditional Japanese Ramen house which makes sense but the seating is limited.  There's a middle community table which they'll seat two parties if necessary.  Timing is everything to avoid a wait.  The Ramen and non-Ramen dishes have always been solid through the years.  Timing is everything with avoiding the wait list before sitting down.  There were numerous times we left because the wait was too long.  If they had more seating I'd probably be here more often.  Until then, may the odds forever be in your favor. Enjoy! =)",

Our group of three had to wait about 30 minutes for a table, so keep that in mind if you're in a rush.   Other than the wait, I have no complaints really. In my opinion, this is the best spot for some delicious Miso Ramen. I tried their Shoyu Ramen once and thought it was just okay. Everyone in my group ordered Miso Ramen (with some extra toppings here and there). I personally like adding corn and/or chashu depending on how hungry I am. Their chashu has an amazing, rich flavor. Service is good and the orders come out blazing fast. I only wish they had Tonkotsu Ramen because that's my favorite order everywhere else.   They have a small parking lot directly behind their little building, but if you can't find any spots there's a lot of street parking in the residential area behind the restaurant as well. All said, if you like Miso Ramen, you should give this place a try.",

    "text": "After spending all morning at the pool drinking, I was starving! The boys and I met up some friends for lunch at Ramen Sora on Thursday, May 11th around 12:30pm. Luckily, they were already seated at the communal table, so we joined them and made a party of five. (I saw some people waiting outside, so I'm glad we didn't have to wait.)  We started with a couple orders of Gyoza ($3.85) which I enjoyed. So much so that I ate more than half of one order! For my bowl, I got the Spicy Ramen ($8.50) with Shio Base (Salt) and added Corn (+$1). I was actually debating getting the Killer Spicy Ramen since I love heat, but we drank so much in the morning, I didn't think my stomach could handle it. I was kinda bummed after I got my bowl as I didn't think it was spicy at all. The broth did have good flavor and the noodles a nice chew. If you're a big meat eater, I'd suggest adding 2 Pcs Pork Belly Chashu ($2.35), Spicy Meat (+$1), or the Killer Spicy Meat (+$1.50). Or all three if you're super hungry. We also got a couple pitchers of Kirin Draft at $11.50 each. If you have multiple people drinking, it's best to get a pitcher as a large glass is $5. Way better deal. I believe a friend of mine got the Deluxe Sora Ramen ($10.25) with Miso Base (Soy Bean Paste), add Corn (+$1) and made it a Large (+$1) or Super Size (+$2). Not sure how much bigger he made it, but he seemed to enjoy it as he finished the whole thing.  Good place to grab a bowl of ramen. Only next time, I'll do the Killer Spicy. And of course, add extra meat!",

Friend said miso was ok, shio was just ok too.  The chashu was pretty good! Very large slices. But the egg was also lackluster to me. Not as sweet as your typical onsen tamago, and a little overcooked. Server seemed to forget about us after bringing out our food.

Their broth is rich and flavorful which is perfect. Not too salty and just the right amount of fat. Their bamboo shoots are also super tasty.   It does get busy here so expect to wait no matter what time you go, but you can also call in and order to go. Skip the wait in line and enjoy your bowl from the comfort of your home. I'd also recommend their pork fried rice and also the goyza if you are sharing or have extra room in your belly for some extra goodness",

    "text": "I am on a mission to try every ramen place in Vegas and this place is one of my favorites!! It is a small restaurant in Chinatown so there is often a wait, but it is worth it! We ordered the garlic edamame and gyoza for starters. The gyoza was just ok, but the garlic edamame was some of the best I have had. It was flavorful and melted in my mouth. Next time, I need a personal order of it because I didn't want to share.  The ramen was equally as delicious. I enjoyed that you could customize your ramen to suit your desires. I was a little hesitant to order the spicy ramen (my go-to) because there was no spicy sauce, but instead used spicy meat which I was not used to. Once you stirred your ramen up, it was perfect. A delicious thick broth which is my favorite and you can customize the broth flavors along with the add ins. This may take the place as my favorite ramen spot in Vegas. I will definitely be coming back and trying more ramen combinations.",

My husband and I ordered the spicy miso ramen - the ramen here doesn't taste all that great. The noodles are thick, broth was overly overly salty, oily and seems like they put what ever spicy flavor in there to make it spicy like red pepper flakes. Which I thought was funny, cuz I've never seen that before.  And there eggs isn't soft boiled :( and they don't give you enough broth.   Chashu fried rice - it had a different flavor, didn't do it for us. Had to pack it to go and had it for dinner, cuz I didn't want to waste money :(   My little man had the mini pork chashu bowl - meh :/ to much fat and burnt meat. Flavor wasn't there. My baby didn't like it so we asked the manager to take it back. The owner was rude and seems to have an attitude.",

In the U.S., we tend towards the stronger, more flavorful broths, which is a reason why tonkotsu became so popular.  If you try their Miso ramen, you'll experience a rich pork based, miso infused broth that's just absolutely delicious!  I passed on Ramen Sora so many times during past trips to Vegas because well, how good can a ramen place be when it's located next to Chinatown?  How wrong I was, and as a ramen lover (as a baseline, Ichiran in Japan is my all time fav), this place is legit!  TIP:  The waitress recommended having the killer spicy meat on the side, and it was a great suggestion!  This way the ground beef doesn't get lost in the broth, so you can enjoy every single last morsel with your noodles.",

My only gripe is their chashu, it's a little thin and it falls apart quickly (this is where Monta wins). So far so good. I'll have to come back when the weather gets colder to update my opinion on this place. Hopefully it doesn't disappoint.",

The gyoza was not bad however it wasn't anything to rave about either.  As for the ramen, we both found it enjoyable for a price that was not overbearing.  Pros: -Super sized portions for you noodle lovers -Screaming vengeance option was really spicy for you spicy lovers, unlike those bs 'spicy miso' fakes -Good clean broth (get the butter please) -Chasu, although small, was tasty -Prices are reasonable, two drinks, one app, two ramen with fixings = $34 before tip  Cons: Egg really sucked for ramen standards  Will try out the other ramen places in Vegas before I come back but it was a good place to start.",

I would go here every day if I could. Love it. So delicious.",

Service was OK, nothing more than taking your order and bringing your food.. But that's all we need anyway..",

I had high hopes as my parents have gone here a few times and told me great things so I was somewhat looking forward to trying the ramen. When I did finally try Ramen Sora, I ordered the Miso Ramen, gyoza and pork fried rice. The gyoza was gyoza - it's hard to mess that up - so I enjoyed it. I really liked the pork fried rice, so kudos for that, but when my miso ramen came out... man, what a disappointment. I liked the noodles in it, the pork belly was cooked well, but the flavor of the bamboo shoots ruined the whole thing. I don't know if they didn't boil them to remove the rancid smell/taste, but it completely ruined my ramen experience. The broth tasted like the shoots too, after I had removed them from the dish. I just couldn't eat past the flavor and normally bamboo shoots are my favorite.  Who knows, maybe it's a regional preference of that flavor that I'm not familiar with because everyone else in the restaurant seemed to enjoy their yucky bamboo infested broth and ramen, but I am not a fan, so unfortunately, I will not be returning here for my ramen needs.",

Wait staff was as good as can be expected from an Asian restaurant in Vegas, in other words shitty service. Now to the ramen... The fragrance was of manure and rotten eggs when I initially put my nose above the steaming bowl. The pork was funky tasting, had a strong chemical taste and the broth had no flavor, along with noodles that were overcooked and too salty.  Now, all of this I would not have noted or written a review. But, just an hour later I started experiencing digestive distress.  I thought I was just having a bad day until my friend informed me she was having the same problems.  !!!FOOD POISONING!!! Now, a full 24 hours later and I have the sweats, chills, lots of digestive issues, and can't hold any food down. My friend is experiencing much the same reaction.   SO... Unless you want a great case of what feels like dysentery, I advise you to stay away from Ramen Sora.  Pitiful service, bad food, and a lasting memory never to be forgotten of ceramic commodes and profuse bodily explosions.",

I preferred the shio. My bowl had a lot of oil, though. Most of it naturally from the pork or whatnot, but still, it wasn't pleasant to look at. I definitely liked the noodles. But that's mainly it. Noodles in the shio broth, that is.  Service was awesome -- our server was very friendly. They have large and XL sizes (big bowls) for those interested.  Will I be back? Yeah.

I usually come here for dinner when i feel up for Ramen, I usually get Tonkotsu Ramen,(simple i know) i love my pork. Sometimes the broth is very tasty , other times it's average. It really is kind of a gamble here from my experiences. Still, the price for ramen is worth it. Good portion, as I leave content and full.

I went in today and they were quite busy, there were 3 party of 2, and party of 1 (which is just me), after they seated the party in front of me, I saw the island in the middle has 4 empty seat left (the seats that no one wants to sit like in movie theater), I kindly told them I don't mind just sit in one of those rather than wait for a table, the waitress just smiled to me and nod.  I waited and waited, 10~15 minutes past(not to mention I've waited 10 minutes since I came in, so 20 minutes total), they finally cleared off a 4 person table and seated me there, YES, they seated me on a 4 person table all by myself, even though I already kindly offer to sit in one of those empty chair by the bar 15 minutes before.  So when I sat down, I told them I want my noodle but with CLEAR broth, waitress told me but I only have 3 choices, either shoyu, miso or shio(yes of course I know that), then I told them I I usually had extra light flavor before but they always made it TOO salty for extra light flavor and can never get it right, so I just want clear broth from now on, then the waitress acted like that I'm a crazy maniac, and told the other waitress to host me instead and she just walked off, HOW RUDE! by the way, this is not the first time I did this, I order with clear broth for maybe about 3 times with other waitresses and they had no problem with it.  After I got my order, I noticed something wasn't right, but I'm not sure what it is, so I kept eating anyway, during these time, they kindly ask me if everything's ok, I said yes.  But when I finished and getting ready to pay, I decided to go check the menu, and noticed they didn't even give me menma(bamboo) in my soup, so no wonder I noticed something not right since the beginning.  I didn't hold the grudge on them, but I did want them to be aware of this mistake they made, so before I leave, I just put down \"they forgot to put bamboo in my soup\" on the receipt, then as I was getting ready to leave, I was stopped by that rude waitress again and she told me I could've told them something's wrong when they came by and they could've fix it and I wouldn't have to write that note on the receipt, BUT like I said before, I didn't REALIZE it till AFTER I finished the soup, shouldn't they be talking to the chef instead of me? I cannot believe they hire such low quality waitress at the store, they don't know how to properly seating the customer and trying to blame me for writing a note on the receipt.",

Not a big deal for us Americans, but the Japanese tend to be very punctual and not flexible(my observations during the 6 years I lived and worked there), so I was grateful and glad that they sat us. We ordered(deluxe Ramen for me, negi shio for the wife, and a deluxe to go for my mom who wanted a taste since she was keeping the little one during this excursion) and the food came quickly. It was delicious. Thick, juicy, flavorful slices of pork, delicious broth( not as creamy as some of the other reviews talk about), and plenty of food. The wife enjoyed hers as well. I really liked how they prepared our to go order. The broth was in one container, the noodles, meat, etc were in another, and the seaweed was wrapped separately on top of both containers. Total for all this came to $30, and it was well worth it. It is still slightly below our favorite place in L.A., but I liked here and would come here again. Though I haven't had Ramen anywhere else in Vegas, I don't think you could go wrong eating here. Try it!",

What can I say, the ramen is good, my face is the shoyu, they have super spicy ramen too, but the char siu pork bowl is the main reason I keep coming back for more! They don't advertise it on the menu but you can supersize that baby! Prices are very reasonable here too and the place is much bigger than monta! Definitely give this place a try!",

The meat in the curry was extremely salty, and the curry itself was bleh - would not order it again. Nice place to stop at and try the ramen, but compared to couple other places on Spring Mountain we've tried, this isn't the best for the most flavor-packed rich ramen.",

I was debating between Sora and Monta, but after seeing several Monta reviews about its saltines, we opted for Sora, and boy are we glad we did.  We got the shio ramen and man oh man, it was goooood!!!  I'd compare it to Santouka in Los Angeles. Yep, that good. I think I actually like Ramen Sora a tad bit more than Santouka (I know I know, heresy!). Prices are very very reasonable and service was quick and efficient. We got there on a Monday night around 4:30PM and there were already about 6 groups in line, but the wait went quickly.   The husband got the chashu ramen and I got the deluxe, both shio broth.  Both were excellent, but mine was better because it had more toppings. The gyoza was the one thing that was a let down, because it tasted like the generic frozen type they just fried up, so skip that. Also got an order of the grilled chashu, because we love love love the grilled chashu at Hachi. While Sora's wasn't bad, Hachi has the edge because of the charcoal-grilling.  Sora was so good that we ordered two large shio ramen and the pork fried rice to go, which we had for dinner Tues. night when we got home. Can't wait to go back!",

The Deluxe Ramen with Miso was probably my favorite meal of the week! The pickled ginger on the side was a perfect compliment as well (my friend requested it, so I don't know if it automatically comes with meals or only by request).  It is the best ramen I've ever had. Granted... I have only tried ramen at four restaurants including Ramen Sora (one in Los Angeles, and two in Atlanta). However, the soup, the meat, and the noodles were perfect: the soup rich, the meat tender, and the noodles chewy.  The wait was a bit long on a Tuesday night, but it was definitely worth the wait. No complaints otherwise.",

Our initial intent was to go to Monta, but the line being ridiculous as it generally tends to be, we decided we would not wait. I remember Ramen Sora was right down the street and was also pretty highly reviewed. Although skeptical, my husband decided to go along with my idea. The wait was about ten minutes, and the interior about 3 times as large as Monta's.  There was a constant influx of people. We were seated by a window and it being 110 degrees out, it was a bit warm. That is my only gripe.   We were promptly served water and the refills kept on coming. We ordered two sides of the seared pork belly which were delicious and I would highly recommend. I went with the Chashu Ramen and added corn with the shoyu (soy sauce) base. My husband ordered the Corn Butter Ramen with the miso (fermented bean paste) base. The portions were great and there was double the pork belly than what I have found at Monta. I generally opt for the tonkotsu (pork) base, so this was new to me but nevertheless extremely flavorful and delicious. The noodles are a bit on the harder side than at Monta, but I quickly grew to like it.  I liked the fact that many of the options came pre made and you did not have to do a billion add ons in order to get a generous serving of ramen and the additions. I would dare say that Ramen Sora beats Monta on every level.",

We usually would have to wait since it doesn't hold much seating, and it is typically busy...on nights we've gone. I really enjoy my shoyu ramen from there. My noodles aren't ever over-cooked and the broth is pretty on point. I usually give up my meat to the hubby. I'm just one of those folks who enjoys their ramen real simple.   Husband usually gets the deluxe or miso ramen and he lerrrvvves it! The broths are so hearty.   I believe there is a Ramen Sora in Japan that are from the same owners. Perhaps the authenticity of it makes their ramen so enjoyable.

I suggest everyone checking this place out. I had no idea Ramen could be so good.",

The girl working gave off such a salty attitude that I even thought my ramen might have tasted salty.  The place wasn't even busy, when I walked and told her how many people were in my party, she rolled her eyes and walked away so a different waiter had to seat me. After I got my ramen, I asked for grated ginger on the side..(this is what annoyed me and my bf the most) she gave me about less than a teaspoon. *see picture* and when I asked for more she said no \"the ginger is very hard to grate for her\" okay???????????? Then I asked for more water twice and it never came, she would walk past and glance down at our empty cups and ignored it. My bf and I had to stare her down while she was behind the counter taking to her coworker for about 10-15 min (we timed it) for her to get us water. We tried getting more water afterwards but it just took too long, so we paid and left. This was overall the worst experience at Ramen Sora.",

    "text": "This ramen joint has become one of the go-to places for my friends and me whenever we're hangover in Vegas. The facade gives off a janky, run-down and small little restaurant, but everything else once you enter inside truly delivers. The employers are natives and very friendly as they provided us with water and took our orders. I usually go for a Spicy Miso Ramen, but decided for a change and got the Corn Butter Miso Ramen ($9). I enjoyed the variety of ingredients that came with the ramen topped with slices of chashu, bamboo shoots, green onions, corn, butter and a perfectly runny egg! In entirety, the bowl of ramen had great flavor. Make sure to melt your butter under your noodles while it's hot. I added a lot of their spicy seasoning on top, which gave it the spice I was looking for if I had got the spicy miso, so I still had the best of both worlds. The food came out quick and our drinks were constantly refilled. You can also get hot green tea for free, which was nice. This is a great spot even if you're not hungover.",

    "text": "Ramen? You mean, ramen noodles...the stuff you buy at the grocery store for like $.10 a packet? No, absolutely not, it's nothing like that. I quickly found that out after having dinner here with some fellow Yelpers. This was my first time having ramen that didn't come out of a wrapper with a little packet of seasoning...and yes, I'm a fan. A huge fan!  So, we came in here for dinner on a Friday night. From what I read in reviews, I was surprised to see that we got seated so quickly. It's actually a good thing that we did because by the time we were done, there was a line out the door. This is a really small restaurant with limited seating, so if you plan to come here, get there early and give yourself a better chance of avoiding the rush  Since this was my first time eating ramen, I felt like a kid asking all our more experienced Yeeps what everything was. What's a miso? Corn and butter? Hard boiled eggs? I had no idea what was going on and while that menu is only a single two-sided sheet, there's no shortage of options. If you've never been to ramen, I definitely suggest going with someone who has for your first time.   After much thought and questioning, I found out the Miso is kind of like the \"safe\" option and decided on Spicy Miso. Wow, this stuff is delicious! The noodles are plentiful and cooked perfectly, the pork is tender and having that egg in there is so good. But the best part of it all is that broth. It's rich and is so, so flavorful. I literally wanted to pick the bowl up and drink it cereal style...it really is that good!  Let me just say, if you were questioning yourself on trying a ramen spot, stop and come straight to Ramen Sora. I may not have much experience in ramen but I can tell you this place is worth the visit and I can't wait to come back!",

However, this ramen place has become one of my favorites. I went with a friend who told me that I had to try it before deciding what I thought was the best and man was he right. The ramen here is excellent. The flavor of the broth is delicious and the noodles are cooked perfectly. They have a really good taste. Also, I really enjoyed the Chasui Bowl. I like Chasui so long as its cooked well. I don't like it when it is so fatty that when I'm chewing it, it just is bleh. The Chasui both in my ramen and in the chase bowl was cooked really well and I enjoyed it.   The service is good but the place is almost always packed. Although, the food makes up for it.   I think the reason why this is 4 stars is because of how busy they are but they aren't always busy (only a majority of the time). I don't really like to wait so I always call before to see how busy they are and if they say the wait is about 25 mins then I decide to go somewhere else. But the food is delicious and worth the wait when your not in a hurry like I normally am.",

Parking in Chinatown is usually a little crazy so we came expecting the worst, but the parking lot was actually fairly easy to get in and out of.   The restaurant is a little small so we had to wait about fifteen minutes to be seated at around 10pm on a weekday night. That was no problem though because the food came out very fast.   We ordered one basic miso ramen and a deluxe miso ramen.   The broth was a perfect balance between thin and thick and had an awesome flavor. The deluxe ramen was pretty much the same as the basic with just a few extra toppings. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the chashu pork was nice and tender.   This is one of the first restaurants we've been to that has nice quality, reusable chopsticks available. (Instead of the usual wooden ones wrapped in paper)  This made my boyfriend very happy; however, the first one I pulled out of the container was all gross and dirty.   We were able to get in and out very quickly with decent service. The ramen was delicious and very affordable. Definitely going to come back!",

    "text": "Pros: Insanely delicious ramen, chashu that just melts in your mouth, friendly and quick service, inexpensive Cons: Tiny restaurant gets crowded on peak times, parking lot is odd, not a lot of side dishes/appetizers if that's what you're into before you eat ramen  I recommend: Deluxe Sora ramen (miso broth is my favorite) upgraded to large size for more broth  This has become my favorite ramen place in Vegas so far! The chashu is just so tender and delicious and the broth is savory, but not too heavy. It definitely hits the spot when you have a ramen craving. The waiters are very friendly, attentive, and helpful.   Like others said, the restaurant is quite small so if you're going for dinner (on any day, from my experience so far), you'll probably encounter a wait. The parking lot is kind of odd; if you're entering the parking lot from the back of the restaurant on Eldon and drive around to the side, the parking spots are diagonal in the wrong way (but the correct way if you're entering from Spring Mountain) so it will be difficult/impossible to park in those and you'll have to exit onto Spring Mountain and loop around. Not a big deal, but on more crowded days it can get a little hectic when everyone is fighting for spots.   All in all, a really great, authentic, delicious ramen restaurant that will definitely hit the spot. On busy days or days that I just want to sit at home in my pajamas and eat ramen, I like to call in my order. They're pretty accurate with the wait time they estimate for you and I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes to pick up my order :).",

I also ordered Edamame not only was the curry low-quality they did not refill our drinks once during the time we were eating. I never got the edamame that I ordered. The only thing I have good to say about this place is at least the waitress informed me that everything was filled and based in pork that was nice of her to be honest with us. $35 dollars wasted.

    "text": "Absolutely Delicious. I found this place via Yelp (Thanks Yelpers!) and it did not disappoint.  Situated in a little Chinatown among a plethora  of Asian restaurants, there are so many other options to choose from if you are driving down the street passing every other Asian restaurant in an attempt to find Ramen Sora but don't give up. It is worth it.   The price is perfect, about $10 or less for a bowl of Ramen depending on what you choose. There are not that many tables inside so depending on how many people there are, do expect a wait but it's worth it. We waited about 15 minutes, not too bad. Any longer and I probably would've tried another Ramen place bookmarked on my iPhone.    There is bench seating along the wall which is good for children or large people. I hate being cramped while eating or not having enough space on the table for all our food but this place was fine. We ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen, Deluxe Sora Shio Ramen #1 and Corn Butter Ramen. They were all delicious! So flavorful, rich, and creamy, tastes like it's been cooking for days which is the way traditional old school Ramen should be. i read the \"tips\" and they give you some type of thinning broth or hot water to thin it out if you don't like your broth so ultimately rich and creamy, although I do.Toppings seemed fresh. Ramen was not overcooked or undercooked, just the perfect amount of body/bite while still soft. I always compare every Ramen place to my hometown \"Ramen Parlor\" which has the best Ramen or to Ramen I've had in Hawaii and this place is delicious. We each ordered our own bowl but were still hungry so we added on another bowl at the end which we split among us just to top us off and completely satisfy.   The place is clean. The waiters check on your frequently. It is not hard to flag em down since the place is small. Will definitely be back.",

    "text": "We knew we had stumbled upon something special when the place was packed full of Japanese-speaking locals within half an hour of opening. They specialize in Hokkaido-style miso ramen. Choice of soup base consists of shio, miso, and spicy miso. Spicy miso isn't really spicy and adds a scoop of ground pork. They use yellow ramen noodles which have a nice chew to them. It comes with a single piece of chashu which is better than most, but for a nicer treat, order the premium chashu. For an extra dollar you can get a large bowl, or two dollars for super-size. Extra toppings such as negi, nori, and menma are available for an additional cost. Prices are reasonable as long as you don't go overboard with extra toppings. Service is decent with a nice ambiance to match.    While not quite as tasty as our fave, tonkotsu ramen, this is the current top ramen spot in town hands-down. Finally a Vegas ramen restaurant worth returning to!",

Once you are seated, service is attentive and fast. I ALWAYS order a deluxe large ramen with light miso broth, an extra egg, extra chashu pork, and extra green onions. Sometimes I add a side order of curry sauce to my soup when I'm in the mood for it. I practically eat here every day when visiting Vegad, because I haven't been able to find ramen as good in the bay area. To avoid a long wait, try it out for lunch or go for an early dinner (before 6pm).",

I've never had any complaints about the service, because when the restaurant is busy the severs are trying their best to keep up. My favorite is the cha shu with miso because I like the thicker saltier broth. Tried the screaming vengeance once, and I will not order it again. Too much heat to enjoy the broth, unless if you like that kind of thing. They are very busy during prime lunch and dinner time so plan accordingly because they do not have much of a waiting area.",

    "text": "This review is long overdue. Ramen Sora is by far, my favorite place to go in town for some delicious Japanese history in a bowl. Other than Fukumimi, this is my default ramen place. The Miso broth has a special place in my heart. I pretty much order it every time. It is thicker, cloudy, and a little bit hardier than the other varieties. I also always order the Deluxe \"Sora\" ramen when here. You get so much tastiness packed into that bowl! There is seaweed (nori), half of a hard boiled marinated egg, green onion, chashu (the softest pork ever), menma (fermented bamboo shoot), and of course, noodles. I always add a pad of butter to it, just to make it extra rich and creamy. With the butter added (extra $1), you get all that for just $11.   The decor is intimate and cozy, and you are always greeted as soon as you walk in the door. About half the time you visit, there will be a 10-15 minute wait. The environment being as \"intimate\" as it is, you have to deal with limited dining space. Often times, the wait is only about 5 minutes, so just be patient! You will be rewarded for that resolve with some of the best ramen around.  Everyone always raves about Monta, which is not too far from where Sora is located. But I urge you to continue down Spring Mountain and give Ramen Sora a chance, at least once. I'm not saying Monta is bad, but I personally think Sora just has that extra something special. Who knows? Maybe you will stick to your favorite, or maybe you will realize the awesomeness that is Sora and be converted. I know I was!",

    "text": "I've tried a lot of different ramen spots in Vegas. All of which, have ranged from the mediocre to the very awesome. After devouring a bowl at Ramen Sora, I'd rate their stuff somewhere in my top 3 bowls or ramen around Vegas. It's definitely worth checking out. Here's what I got:  -Mini chashu curry bowl: I was amazed at how flavorful their Japanese curry is. Lots of savory deliciousness packed into a mini bowl. It makes for a great starter. -Spicy miso ramen: The broth has a great flavor to it, though I was expecting it to actually be spicy. Noodles were really good too (touted to be made from a recipe straight from Sapporo, Japan). I sampled the shio broth from others at my table. I'd have to say that I preferred my miso broth over it. -Kurogoma Dango (Dessert) - Tastes like homemade mochi with a sweet bean filling inside. It's something either you like or hate. Doesn't hurt to try for $2 (3 pieces).  The parking is pretty convenient since it's not part of a strip mall, the interior is spacious for a ramen spot, and staff is really friendly and welcoming. It's safe to say that it's all enough to keep me coming back.  Quick Notes: -They don't serve alcohol yet, but they are working on it! -Order a large bowl ($1 more) if you're hungry. They don't do noodle refills.",

For those who live in South Cal, it is not a problem because all you have to do is go to Torrance or Gardena and for sure you'll find places that serves good ramen. But at last I found a place that I can finally say serves the ramen that I've been searching for here in Vegas. Ramen Sora is a small place located on Spring Mountain Rd. and Arville. I gave it four stars because of parking. If you come here during peak business hours a.k.a. lunch or dinner, you might find yourself parking on the street. Ramen Sora's parking lot is small. When you get inside, you'll find a few tables and a counter (like a bar). Fortunately, my friend and I came at the right time and were seated right away. I ordered the corn butter miso ramen, large with extra cha-shu (pork belly). My friend ordered the Sora Deluxe Ramen. I really liked what I ordered. It had a very tasty flavor, the soup/broth was \"silky\" (I think it's because of the butter), the noodle had the right firmness to it, and the cha-shu was so tender that it just melts in your mouth. Yum!!! I'm glad I came to ramen sora today and for sure will be back for more and try the spicy ramen next time.",

So last night was my very very first experience with ramen **gasp!** - well, aside from the $0.10 packages you buy at the grocery store. To be quite honest I didn't know what to expect. I should have known I was in good hands with a group of Yelpers.. many of them of Asian decent. (Is that PC? Christina W. where are you when I need you??)  The wait was long, but I take that as a sign of quality, not weakness. We did have a party of 12 so what does one expect? I was just grateful that my fingers and toes were able to thaw from our Yelp Helps event.  The menu was complicated for someone who didn't know the first thing about ramen, in that there aren't really descriptions for anything. But I was pleased to see that every ramen offering had a photo. So really my decision was a matter of what looked the tastiest or least complicated. I settled on Miso Ramen $7.50. I figured it was a good basic and if it was yummy I could try something more adventurous next time.  The noodles are handmade on location and were thick and tasty - not at all like the store bought packages I grew up with. The meat was tender and fell apart at the slightest touch. I wasn't starving, so I took most of it home to the bf who gobbled up the leftovers (his first time with ramen too). I was pleasantly surprised at how good it really was.  The service once seated was top notch. Our waitress was patient, split our checks and got everyone's order correct with the exception of one missed green tea. Not an easy task when dealing with 12 yelpers who were taking pictures and taking notes.  Hooray for ramen I say! A great way to warm up on a cold winter night!",

It was still in a giant cluster when my bowl came out and I had to put it on my spoon and slice it apart with my chopsticks. Normally, I can just swish it around easily with my spoon. This cold meat totally ruined my meal. I hope it's better next time because Ramen Sora is seriously one of my fav ramen spots!",

I ordered the Screaming for Vengeance. I'm obsessed with spice and can never resist. I also typically order tonkotsu broth too, which wasn't offered at this location. I can never choose the shio, shoyu, or miso when there's so much more decadent options available! I couldn't find this information on Yelp when I was looking, but the difference between Screaming for Vengeance and Spicy Ramen is that SfV has spicy added to the broth as well in addition to the chili paste and spicy ground meat, whereas just plain spicy ramen is regular broth.   It was fantastic! It was the perfect hurt. It didn't have a very spicy forefront (more of a slow painful build), and it did make my nose run! No sweating though. The noodles were such great consistency, on the thicker side with nice chew. Make sure you have plenty of water to cool yourself off!   I took off a star since we had to get the waitress's attention several times since she wasn't checking on us.",

    "text": "Before I give you my opinion about Ramen Sora, let me give you some insite into Japanese ramen. There are many different styles of ramen in Japan just like there are many different styles of pizza in America! Many people I speak with will say that Monta Ramen is way better than Ramen Sora. However, that's an unfair judgement because they are different styles and come from different regions of Japan. Ramen Sora reflects more of a Northern Japanese style ramen using miso, shio, or soyu broth with thicker noodles. The ramen you get at Monta is a tonkotsu style which is a richer pork broth generally using thinner noodles.   With that said, Ramen Sora is pretty good when it comes to their ramen. I would recommend the Miso out of all the broths as it tastes rich with flavor.   The reason I gave them 4/5 stars instead of 5/5 is because I feel that their chashu pork fall a little short. Japanese ramen style chashu takes a lot of skill to prepare correctly. If it's done right, it should just melt in your mouth. Ramen Sora's chashu is very tender but i'd say it fall behind Monta's chashu. A few reasons why I think their chashu is not perfect is because they do not roll their slab of pork belly when preparing it. This causes more moisture to escape from the pork during the cooking process. You'll notice Monta's pork is rolled and melts in your mouth.   So all in all I give Ramen Sora a 4/5. Not bad for ramen found in desert!..and incase you were wondering, yes I am Japanese! Happy Eating Folks!",

    "text": "This place wasn't what I expected. It was tiny but roomy inside. There isn't a lot of tables so I suggest going at a time you believe might not be crowded. We went around 2ish. 3 tables were taken. People started coming in after our food arrived.   The food was great. We ordered the regular and spicy miso ramen along with gyozas. The regular size bowl was just enough for me. I left content. Not full, but not hungry still, with room for dessert elsewhere. The pork was delicious! My 6 year old had the shiyo(?) ramen. She had a lot left over and didn't look as if she was enjoying it too much unlike the way she would kill a bowl of pho. I think she just didn't like that soup taste.  This was our first visit and I would definitely come back to fulfill my cravings for ramen... And try the curry instead of the order my daughter had.  Price-wise, affordable. I think our regular size bowls were under $8 per. A dollar more for a size up.  Also, I appreciate the Japanese way of greeting their customers as they enter/leave. Felt like I was in Japan again. Sort of :)",

After a good look at the menu, our orders were placed.  I got the shio ramen, it was small but flavorable with a couple of big pieces of chashu pork.  The half boiled egg was still slightly runny, and the noodle was what I call True ramen noodle, at least what I had been used to getting in Hawaiian Ramen shops.  Overall, a good bowl of soup, but it didn't fill me up, so either order extra sides, or make it large, or you're gonna leave hungry.",

The A/C was not working well, and they had a portable unit inside, though it could not keep up with the heat. Service was very quick. We started with pot stickers, which were fine, but nothing special. (Same with the Mini-Chashu bowl) As for the ramen, I had the Shoyu, and my wife had the Miso, and both were tasty.

The next two times, within the past month, I couldn't eat it. It was so spicy that it made me cry and I had to commandeer my friends leftover broth in order to have something to rinse my noodles off with. It was so painfully bad. My face and lips hurt afterwards. The last time I went I was told that the meat gets hotter the longer it sits in the oil that makes it \"killer.\" I was told it wasn't too bad today and it wasn't as bad as the last time but the amount of chili oil in my bowl was ridiculous. I may just switch to the spicy ramen so I can go back to enjoying my meals  still highly recommend this place over any other ramen restaurant though.",

I came here with high hopes hoping this would be thick, flavorfulass soup that Asa or Santouka would bring but alas. It was more on the thin side and the spicy miso that I chose was made differently. It did not come as a paste as it normally does, this was infused with pork, so my pescatarian friend was unable to eat it :s  The noodles were very chewy and the egg was okay.. I liked that it was runny but it wasn't mindblowingly good like other places that do not come to mind.   The pork was super thick. It was on the tender side and was marbled with bits of the luscious fat but it didn't make my eyes roll back..   Service was aite. There was a wait on a Saturday afternoon at 2pm, prolly like 20 minutes..   In terms of quantity, it was very, very filling. I had to togo it so that I wouldn't get kbbq full.",

I had the Chashu Ramen with miso broth (3 pieces of pork) and it was delicious.  The broth wasn't too salty and the savoury flavours of the meat and noodles was a symphony in my mouth.  My friend's spicy ramen was well appreciated and it disappeared in a hurry!  Prices are reasonable (bowls are under $10) and service is fast and friendly.

It was really heaven in a bowl and I f*cked it up like a savage!!! The Pork Chashu bowl is also a favorite of mine and has changed my life. It's probably one of the best overall eats I've had in my entire life. Seriously! The pork is so soft and melts in your mouth. They have it down to a science! I've tried Jinya, and Fukumimi which I absolutely love, but Ramen Sora has my heart. This place is amazing and I always get great service here. The place is a little small though, so expect a wait if you come on a busy hour. I'm a Personal Chef so it takes a lot to get my props and they definitely did the job! :-)",

It came with one piece of cha-siu thick cut. I prefer Monta's thin cut. Sora gives you half an egg where as at monta you would have to pay extra but Sora's prices are a bit more than Monta's so there's that. Also, Sora is more spacious and bigger. The parking is a lot better since they have their own parking. Can't go wrong at either place.",

It's been a while since I have been to a ramen restaurant and this place didn't disappoint. My wife chose the miso. I thought it was amazing. But it wasn't really her cup of tea (or soup in this case). She was happy to eat the chashu on rice. With the smokey flavor and sweetness of the sauce it was a hit. I got the crazy hot shoyu ramen with extra nori. I love to eat habanero regularly so wasn't expecting it to be too spicy, once again not disappointed. The heat started just right and I was soon tearing up by the end. We got some edamame two soups some appetizers and left paying less than 35 dollars. It was fun. And despite the dislike of miso for my wife, she even said she would come back.",

I like the charsiu ramen with killer spicy meat and corn. That was perfectly spicy. The heat tends to come with what tasted like Thai chilies. Obviously not something I thought I'd find in a traditional Japanese dish, however, it was good & I LOVE Thai chilies, so no complaints here. The noodles had a nice bite to them. And the pork was rather tender and savory.  The service was friendly and accommodating to my rowdy yet fun group of friends. We left them a very nice tip for their troubles, because we did feel they earned it. I think most of the guys wanna make this the \"last stop before skipping town\" on Vegas trips from now on. Great after a night of partying.",

I just came from Japan, where I lived for the last 7 yrs.  with that being said.... There is a trick to this 3 rating...  Ok so my Japanese wife is with me, and matter of fact she has only been away from our home in Japan for about a week, and already missing the food... So she yelped and found this spot. As far as authentic, she blessed off and said yes it's really Japanese ramen... However, it's not like the best.  Her exact words were, \"this is good, for America.. You know if this place was in Japan, it would get some business...\" So on a 10 pt scale... Including Japan, this ramen is about a 5..... Like Tenkaippin... HOWEVER... (Here's the catch)... As far as USA ramen places go... It's like an 8!!  So I figured... 3 stars would do. Even Sakino JUST said to me, ehhh I don't mind coming back... Pretty good stuff.  So don't really worry about my picky opinion. I'm a die hard True blue 110% loyal to my #1 favorite ramen spot in Okinawa and honestly nothing will ever compete... But Sakino is Japanese, from Japan, and vouched for this place. Again, she gave it a Japanese 5 but a USA 8.... And since we're obviously on the US right now.... This is the place to be.  We both got the spicy ramen, rice, mochi ice cream. The SUPER spicy one was like crazy hot...lol. The regular spicy is just fine... No need for more.  The rice was decent. Mochi was fine. Service friendly and nice and quick. No issues with the staff or facility! And again, I can't go above 3 stars cuz honestly TASTE wise, it's a 3 star place... But that's cuz I've been to the ramen Mecca and back... So for here, you more than likely will NOT find better ramen than this place! Take it or leave it....  ",

We arrived shortly after they opened and the line of people started as soon as we were seated.  Score!  I tried the regular sized Deluxe Sora Ramen with a miso base, $10.  The portions were bigger than I expected.  I'm in love with the chewy WAVY noodles!!!  Rarely do ramen places serve wavy noodles.  The chasu could be more tender but they give a lot of it!  I counted four pieces!  The broth was good but a tad salty.  I wish the egg was a bit more runny... it was still good. The hubs commented that the price is steep but I think it's more than reasonable.  Most ramen places charge extra for most toppings.  At Ramen Sora, the Deluxe Sora Ramen came with everything I listed above in addition to green onions, three large pieces of seaweed, and bamboo!  I think it's a steal.  The hubs was sweating from the Screaming for Vengeance ramen, $10.  I tried it and it was very spicy!  But I think my spice level has gone down.  He said he wouldn't order it again though, haha.  Not because it wasn't good but because it made him very uncomfortable and sweaty =D Biggest gripe is that I wish they offer a tonkotsu base broth.",

I seriously missed the broth and all its glory after every gulp, slurp and bite I had, not to mention I was left wanting more.  Screaming for Vengeance has the most extra ingredients in it so you might not have to.  If you are a big eater get the large trust me you won't regret it.    You really can't compare the noodles or the broth to other spicy ramen and I have had my share of them.  Orochan Ramen in little Tokyo doesn't even come close to how perfectly spicy and flavorful Ramen sora made theirs, but Orochan Ramen is way spicier, now having said that I still wouldn't want Ramen Sora to change a thing.  I am really glad my friends and I tried this place out and found a gem.  It literally doesn't get better than this and I may have to attribute the balanced flavors to the noodles that were pretty eggy in flavor but hands down its probably what contributed so much to making it right, spicy and delicious.    The restaurant is small so the capacity isn't very big it could probably fit around thirty plus people.  Come early or wait and if you do wait keep waiting because its well worth the wait.  I can't wait to come back next time I come around to vegas.",

However, WOW now I understand why people are so into ramen.  I have not had good ramen so this is by far the best ramen I have ever had.  My boyfriend and I were on our mini vacay when a friend of ours recommended going to this place.  Like I said, we were hesitant.  All the places we have gone to at home was quite a let down.  Nevertheless, we were pretty please with this place.    Ramen Sora is a small restaurant with limited parking behind the restaurant.  To get seated, you have to sign yourself in on list.  This is actually very common for a lot of Asian restaurants especially in California.  I find it quite annoying because you never really get greeted.  Anyways, it wasn't long for us to get seated and for us to order.  I ordered the spicy ramen with miso broth and my boyfriend ordered the deluxe ramen with miso broth and an additional spicy meat to make it spicy.  The deluxe ramen has additional toppings, but the size was the same.  The ramen was delicious; unlike any I have had before.  However, I must say it is a bit greasy, but I much rather prefer this than all the other ramen places back home.",

As we ate, more people rolled in so that was a good sign.  Our waitress was very nice, and helped explain the menu to my friend, who really needs to see a photo to understand what she is ordering hahaha. I chose the Miso based ramen and she choose the salt based one. Delivered quickly and very hot, I thought both were pretty tasty. My friend thought mine was much better and wanted to trade, but I laughed and said \"not a chance\".   Prices were cheaper than Manta, and it was pretty good, although not something I'd order on a hot summer night. I need to get my friend to try things like salads.  Overall, I'd go back.",

The meat was very fatty and lesser quality than most places, but the killer spicy flavour was great. The noodles were cooked good but something was off about them. The gyoza was the best part, but wouldn't return for it.",

Funny how so many places I've visited lately repulse their customers out the door by inflicting their obnoxiously loud music on them. I won't go back to Jinya Ramen for the very reason.   Aside from the music volume, I liked this place. The miso broth was tasty! Noodles perfectly cooked. Spice level great.   The dining area could use a scrub down and paint job, however. Cleanliness factor is only 3 stars. I hope the kitchen is cleaner than the dining space.",

    "text": "Ramen Sora is a solid ramen store, but with Monta right down the street, there is no comparison.    I came to Ramen Sora starving one night with my roommate and fellow ramen connoisseur Andrew N.  We were in search of some filling ramen.  We both got the Deluxe Sora Ramen with Shio broth.  We both found the broth to be a little bland and not as flavorful as we expected it to.  To be fair there is a note at the bottom of the menu that clearly states to ask for the Shio concentrate if you want more flavor.  But why shouldn't the original broth have enough flavor to begin with?  The toppings were plentiful, there were three pieces of pork a soft boiled egg and plenty of veggies.    I wish that there were more soup broths to choose from like a Tonkatsu or pork flavor or even a Shoyu flavor.  I also wish I could add in some corn without having to order the corn butter ramen.  One more thing, $10 for a deluxe bowl of ramen that wasn't that big?  I killed that bowl... imagine what damage a big dude could do.  Over priced for the amount and quality.  Overall a good meal but if you want ramen go to Monta for the real deal.  Sorry Ramen Sora.",

I also prefer a spicy soup but I don't care for the spicy option at Sora. The broth and noodles are consistently delicious. The parking sucks. The seating is limited but the folks are friendly...well, at least I assume they are because they shout out greetings when we walk in. What they shout out is not in a language that I understand but I like to think they are saying something like Hello, welcome to our restaurant...could be - Oh man, more Yelpers, we gotta step up our game.

    "text": "Short review: When it comes to ramen, this is almost as good as it gets.  A detailed review is below.  I was in Vegas for the holiday and on the hunt for a good food-spot.  I thought first of Lotus of Siam, my by-far favorite restauraunt in Vegas.  But it was closed.  So I decided to see what kind of ramen Vegas had to offer.  I did what I always do when I want to figure out where I should eat: Yelp it.  I checked a few places out.  But I settled on Ramen Sora, as it had several reviews that praised its spicy ramen.  When I showed up, I was surprised by how small it was.  I was even more surprised by how many people were waiting outside.  And when I went inside, there were even more people waiting.  Also, I was right, it's a small place.  There's probably only room for forty or so people (max) to be eating at any one time.  To get a seat, you have to write your name on \"the list.\"  When I did that, there were already 15 people (which can mean ay number of people in the actual party) ahead of me.  It took about 45 minutes to get a seat.  But that's not because the staff or kitches is subpar.  This place is one of the most efficient restauturants I've ever seen, especially considering the never-ending demand.  I ordered the Gyoza, as an appetitizer, and the \"Killer Spicy\" miso-ramen.  My company ordered the regular spicy miso-ramen.  The food came out in no more than 10 minutes.  It's the best Gyoza I've had.  The filling was bursting with flavor.  It was crispy yet soft, the perfect combination.  My only complaint is that one order is only five pieces.  First, that's not enough.  Second, that makes for a fight when you have company and have to figure out what to do with the fifth piece.  Now to the ramen.  I could tell once I got my bowl that it wouldn't be the best ramen I've had.  But it looked promising.  The noodles were firm, not chewy.  But they were a bit skinny for my liking.  The chashu pork was flawless.  It's the most flavorable chashu pork I've had.  It also, was extremely lean, which is important to me.  The ramen comes with bamboo, which adds much needed texture.  Now to the most important element of ramen, the broth.  It was as spicy as promised, which made me happy, but it was too thick.  I like finishing off my broth, and this turned into a watery gravy.  (The broth of the regular spicy had a much better consistency--I stole a spoon full to taste.)  I haven't been to any other Vegas ramen joints, but if a friend asked where to go, I'd strongly recommend this spot.",

The broth had nice flavor too it and noodles cooked just right. Honest overall still rank Monta as the only place too go ramen in Vegas. Not that Ramen Sora is bad I will still go back feel like mixing it up or if Monta wait is too long. I love my gyoza with my ramen (tradition two together) and not notice it on the menu here plus no one compete with Monta gyoza anyway. They do have charzuka (sure spelled it wrong) bowl which I ordered like my side dish. The meat was very tasty seared on top bed of rice in small bowl.   The waitstaff is very friendly, courtesy, and greet you right when you walk in plus throughout your meal. The restaurant not very big I though Monta was small but this place might be just as small. The parking can be hassle depending time you go. Only ten or so stalls around the back of the restaurant then you would need too park on the streets.   Overall miso ramen was winner but still have too place Monta above but whenever need get ramen fix sure Ramen Sora on my list!",

    "text": "When it comes to having out of town guests visit, we usually try to introduce them to Vegas' Ramen options because, at least in SF, good ramen means a long drive and headache finding parking for not-out-of-this-world ramen. I still don't know which ramen I prefer, Ramen Sora or Monta Ramen, but I think I have come to the conclusion that both are delicious in their own right, Ramen Sora is just easier to get a table at, which means we end up eating their more often, which means I get tired of it faster. BUTTTT.. I'm still a fan. It's really hard not to compare the two locations and I thought it was really sad during the Aki Matsuri festival that neither restaurant's booths got much love/patronage during the event.  Some pros for Ramen Sora: -Broth is really, really rich -I prefer their Chasu rice bowls over Monta Ramen (they even come in mini sizes) -Gyoza are always cooked well -Tables are easily moved for large or small parties -A couple of TVs if you really want to catch a game -Wait is definitely a lot shorter than Monta Ramen -They don't charge for hot tea, which Monta Ramen does  When it comes down to it, Las Vegas is lucky to have so many solid ramen options nearby and you can't go wrong with coming here.",

So warm, so chicken, so doge. The noodles were perfect in every way. Not too soft and not overly chewy, I can just easily slurp them! :) the pork was really tasty too, it was made so you could easily break it into pieces, or just have it melt in your mouth.

There was quite a wait only because we had a big group but we were just happy to be indoors. Normally, if there's only 2 people in your party, you get seated rather quickly.  I normally get gyoza with whatever ramen I get. There's enough meat filling and the wrapper isn't thick/ chewy with one side toasted for a nice crisp. I've tried their shoyu chashu ramen, miso ramen, nori ramen, shio ramen and the spicy miso ramen. Unfortunately, they ran low on chashu the last time we went - each person could only have 1 slice of pork belly each. Sad! But their chashu is soooo tasty so I'm not surprised. I like to add iwanori (seaweed flakes) and corn on my ramen. Mmmmm...the hot rich broth, the firm ramen noodles and hard-boiled egg + chashu on a cold day. I couldn't want more than that. You can wash it all down with beer, hot tea, iced tea or Ramune.  Our server was patient with us despite special requests and complications with splitting the bill. I can't think of a time I had a bad experience here.",

She remembered after only my first visit and always makes sure to say hi even if she's not my server.   The deluxe Ramen is the way to go with miso based soup and you can ask for it to be made with low salt! The portion sizes are the largest in town and the flavor is a blast of delicious goodness. The ramen noodles are the perfect thickness and crinkly curly. The chashu slices are large and juicy never dry or too fatty. You get way more ingredients in your soup than other places and they don't charge much for add ons. Expect to wait at least 20mins because  there is always a line but this place is well worth it and Foodie approved! You won't ever leave hungry and it's not too pricey.",

So there's no pressure to come up with your own combination amok ingredients BUT YOU STILL GET FREEDOM TO ADD WHATEVER YOU WANT! Toppings include spicy pork, corn, eggs, broth and so much more. The upgrade from regular size to large only costs $1. The difference is that the regular is one pack of noodles and the large has a pack and a half plus more broth but no extra toppings.  I ordered the regular spicy miso ramen and it was plenty for me. The spice level was perfect for me but forbmy friend who eats spicy food \"sometimes\"  it was too spicy. It came with one large slice of pork, spicy ground pork, half egg and bamboo shoots. The broth was delicious and the meat was so tender. I love the ground pork because it adds texture and if course protein.  The only down side to this ramen restaurant is that all their broths and dishes include pork.

    "text": "We used to go to this place a lot because of their really dank curry bowls. We would usually order 3 to 5 bowls with a tamago each and take the leftovers with us to eat at home. It was our ONLY go-to place in town where we know that there's good and fast service and we're not gonna be sick after eating. We live an hour away from Vegas and have to fight another 30 minutes of Vegas traffic just for their curry. However the last two times we went the curry bowls were nowhere near as good as they used to be. It seemed like they changed the recipe so they can throw it together when someone orders instead of preparing them with care that they used to. The meat especially tasted different. Before it tasted like they were smoked to this utter perfection but the last two times the meat tasted almost like roast beef and it was too fatty. We are really sad because it's our date spot in town too. We're gonna go there one more time to see if they were just having issues with their equipment and had to improvise and if the curry bowls tasted like how they used to be then we will happily update this review because those curry bowls are worth more than five stars.",

Now I see and taste why.   This is a tiny joint on Spring Mountain in the heart of Chinatown. Don't ever under-estimate places that aren't the \"highest rated\". This place was the best I've had by far. From the broth to the toppings; everything was amazing.   I had the Miso broth - chasu ramen and I had them add extra chasu. Horrible idea because I was crazy full. Which I didn't even care at that point because it was so freaking delicious.   Love this place and I can't wait to bring my momma there.",

    "text": "It's about time I confess... I love ramen more than I love life itself. Especially ramen from Ramen Sora. A few years ago I had ramen for the first time at some sub-par restaurant that made me stray from ramen for a while. A year later I gave Ramen Sora a try. It was glorious and I fell in love. I love their ramen in all its salty & flavorful broth, thick noodles, crunchy menma(bamboo), and umami chasiu.  During the time I've known Sora, I've strayed from my loyalty and tried multiple other ramen restaurants around the valley (& some in California!), but I have yet to find another that compares to Sora's rich soup, flawlessly boiled egg and the perfect fat-to meat ratio of the chasiu. Shio (soy sauce) broth is light and salty if you don't want a thick soup. Miso is thicker and flavorful with what I think are hints of ginger. Spicy pork is not too spicy, and ask for chili oil which delivers a nice kick. Screaming for vengeance is hottt and comparable to a crazy night out- you'll feel it more the day after if you know what I mean. Sora even has delicious and good sized portions of chasiu bowls and curry bowls if a ramen doesn't fill you up.  There's usually a bit of a wait at dinner time, but any wait is worth it for what Sora has to offer.  Sora has everything I could've ever wanted in a love and more.  My heart, and stomach, belongs to Ramen Sora.  Til death do us part.",

I don't go out to eat ramen too often and I only have had Monta up to this point, and I need to familiarize myself with different restaurants around the valley and I know Ramen Sora is another popular choice, so I decided to pay it a visit.   It is a small place and the parking can get a little hectic since they have a small lot and you might have to park in the adjacent street. When you go in, don't forget to write down your name, or you're gonna be stuck looking like an idiot waiting for someone to help you out, like I did.   I was promptly seated with my party and it didn't take long before they came to take our order. I got the ramen deluxe with corn, and I feel like that was a good value for its price. They have larger bowls, but the only thing you get more of is soup and noodles. That's up to you if you believe it's worth the extra price, but I stuck with the normal sized bowl.   I enjoyed everything in my bowl from the noodles, to the broth, to the egg. I have no complaints with Ramen Sora and I will be making another visit to this place in the nearby future. I recommend this place if you just want to eat at another ramen place in Las Vegas, or just somewhere to get some hot soup, especially during winter!",

The broth wasn't heavy like it is in other places, the noodles aren't over piled in your ramen, and for the sizing of the bowls, it's really decent. Very fulfilling and satisfying.

We had checked out of our hotel room and had a few hours to spare before most of the girls boarded our plane home.  We arrived about 10 minutes before Sora opened, so there was definitely no line and we were the first group seated.  The rest of our crew arrived about 20 minutes later (11 total).  The place filled up fast by noon time so I'm glad we were able to get our big party seated before the rush.  After reading reviews of Monta vs. Sora, I assumed Monta ramen would be better.  Imagine my surprise when Sora ramen knocked it out of the park. The broth is quite flavorful almost too intensely salted.  The menu mentioned the capability to dilute the flavor with more broth if needed.  The noodles were my favorite - fresh, chewy consistency that was absolutely delish.  That's how real RAMEN noodles should taste! Go with the Delux to try a bit of everything.  I loved the thick broth and variety of toppings. Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely make a pit stop here again.",

Plus you can see an immense amount of oil floating on the soup.  YUCK!  I was also disappointed they didn't have shoyu ramen as an option.

I normally go to Monta Ramen, it is still questionable if one was better than the other, i'd say it depends on what your taste buds are looking for. Sora provides spicy and flavorful broths. You can order broth bases such as Miso or Shoyu, and they have a wide selection of extra ingredients you can add. I must say, I love their gyoza! Cooked perfectly; crispy at the bottom, where it's been pan fried, and moist and juicy everywhere else.   I ordered my miso ramen with cold draft kirin. Best combo ever!",

And it's hard to find anything better than the ramen at Ramen Sora.  I went with the spicy miso, there was so much going on in that medium-sized bowl of noodles, pork, and broth.    What seperates Ramen Sora from other restaurants of its ilk is the service.  As a big, goofy-looking white guy, let's just say that at many Chinatown restaurants, sometimes service is.......well........less than friendly.  Not the case here, everyone was very nice.    This will be a regular spot in the rotation and I'm looking forward to trying different menu items.  You should do the same!  :)",

This is a small place, so make sure you have some time to wait, especially if you have a big party. The staff is delightful. When I gave a decent tip (~25%) for excellent service, the waitress tried to return it as she thought it was \"too much.\" Their food was delivered quickly, everyone was friendly, and the quality of the food was stunning.  The broth--there is no better tonkatsu broth. They use a slow process to make the broth from black boar bones over days, and it really shows in the flavor.   Even thinking about this place is enough to make my mouth water. I wish I lived closer to Vegas, a town that I loathe, just so I could eat at Ramen Sora a ridiculous amount of the time. As it is, every place I've been to since has been dreadfully, dismally disappointing.",

It can be overpowering, but I found that it was just complex and hearty.  I had started with the small bowl of charshu curry. I will be the first to admit that I have had my fair share of bad curry, especially of the Japanese variety, and have develop a phobia about trying it again. I got so many shocked reactions due to my declaration against it that I had to try it again. It was actually very good. I like their pickled radish here. It is slightly sweet and paired well with the curry. A few days later, I made a curry for a potluck and I might not dislike the Japanese version as much as I initially thought. I was still ravenous and ordered a bowl of the menma ramen as well. I am a huge fan of bamboo. It can be fresh, cured, or dried. If it is an option, I am ordering it. Especially if it is the main component of the dish. I ended up stealing all of my friends, too. Sora offers a solid bowl of soup.",

Unfortunately, there is a point of hungover-ness that cannot be cured, no matter the cure you end up choosing. This was one of those days.   I ordered the deluxe ramen, which came loaded with half an egg, chasu, and seaweed. I was able to eat maybe 25% of it tops, but that was enough for me to make a worthwhile evaluation. The broth is excellent, extremely fatty and much more flavorful than other ramen establishments that I have tried. The chasu was fatty as well but the meat was not as lean as some places that I have had in LA. The soft boiled egg was indeed soft boiled which is good, but it was was still cold and not heated up yet from the soup so that could be improved.  Overall I would definitely come to try this place again when I am capable of finishing an entire bowl.",

    "text": "I've been to both Monta and Sora, and I have to say that Sora is the better one of the two! Sorry Monta, but you don't have as much variety and space compared to your rival.   The corn butter ramen with miso base is the best! Adding the butter makes the broth more creamy less thin, and it tasted like heaven! I was skeptical at first and thought they were crazy for adding such a big chunk of butter, but I was wrong!   Service was great, because we came in during their slow hours and there was no wait. Our server constantly refilled our waters and checked up on us. The only bad thing was that they didn't give back our change after we payed the check. Even if it was just a dollar and something cents, I would have liked for them to give us back our change instead of assuming that they could keep it. Customers usually leave the tip on the table after they give back change!",

Having passed it by before I warned my mother that it was not a big place and looked like a \"hole in the wall\" type of restaurant. But sometimes, those places are the best and this was one of them. We knew it when we arrived 15 minutes before it opened and already there was a line, and this was the day after Christmas! Fortunately, we were the second to last to be seated once they opened their doors.  The restaurant was clean and despite that there were only two servers, service was pretty good. Two tables were already being cleared as we were being seated. This is a ramen place afterall, order it, eat it (slurp it) and leave so the next person can get a table. I've driven past there several times since and have not once passed by without seeing a line out the door. It's that good.   I haven't been to a ramen shop since I lived in Japan over 25 years ago. I thought the flavor and presentation were very authentic and would recommend it to everyone. I'll certainly be back!",

The pork inside the broth was amazing. For the people that enjoy the runny yolk with the egg white, this is the place to go.

    "text": "The gf and I were exploring the Chinatown area.  We'd had our banh mi appetizer and decided to find some ramen for our lunch main course.  Once again, we referenced our Yelp iPhone app and two names seemed to be head and shoulders above the competition, Monta Ramen and Ramen Sora, based on the sage advice of Misti Y, Janel S, and Yuhi K.  We made our way up W. Spring Mountain and Ramen Sora became our default choice since it was a shorter walk from Mr. Sandwich.   Ramen Sora doesn't look like much from the outside or inside with its dive-ish exterior and generic furnishings, but it definitely sounds like a Japanese ramen shop with the shouted greeting \"Irrasshaimase!\" as you enter the place and the slurping of noodles and broth.  The menu is pretty straightforward with descriptive photos of items offered.  While the Spicy Miso Ramen sounded intriguing, I went with the regular Miso Ramen with Chashu ($9) since I had recently had a similar bowl of miso ramen at ramen shop in DC from which to base a comparison with Ramen Sora's.   Three thick slices of pork belly rested atop a bed of nicely cooked noodles, which were bathed in a generously-sized bowl filled with flavorful, but not too salty, miso broth.  The broth was a bit greasy, but it was a result of the fatty pork belly, and not a detractor from the overall bowl.  Ramen Sora's Miso Ramen with Chashu was not quite as good as the bowl I had at DC's Toki Underground (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/toki-underground-washington#hrid:J5z59CPghtxPxofmaWWhdw/src:self\">yelp.com/biz/toki-underg...</a>.), but it was appreciably less expensive and offered incredible value!  Ramen Sora really delivered!  Next time, I'll have to try the Spicy Miso Ramen.",

    "text": "Looking for a bowl of ramen? Ramen Sora offers a solid serving. I had the Nori Ramen with Miso broth and of course, a side of gyoza. The ramen was solid, probably won't be the most memorable bowl of ramen you will have eaten but you will not leave feeling unsatisfied. While tasty, I felt the miso broth was either missing some umami or additional saltiness. A side of additional garlic may have also helped but by itself, I had myself wondering what it could be while eating. Inside the bowl was a piece of char siu which was very tender, falling apart as soon as it hit my tongue, nori and bamboo. Very simple and satisfying. The noodles were slippery good and cooked to the right degree of al dente. The gyoza were also very good but also missing something to make it truly memorable, perhaps a little more sesame oil would be more toward my taste. They were also not served super hot, a la fresh out of the pan, which is how I like them. Probably a minor complaint for most though as many people eat it over the course of the meal anyway when it will get warm. All in all a solid ramen eating experience if you're craving a bowl of ramen while in Vegas.",

It's located across the street from my house, obviously making it incredibly convenient but I always know that there will be a line. I don't like to wait. People may find that selfish of me, but I choose not to. I mention that because I never mind waiting for Ramen Sora. They have a sign in sheet, which I saw only had three in front of us. It seems more traditional with the seating, meaning, you may be sitting at a long rectangular table with a couple other parties if you don't mind. We sat after about ten minutes and were served within five. We always order the same three things a pork belly bowl with rice to split, Killer Spicy Ramen, and Spicy Ramen.. Always more than we can eat, which is downstairs now, but delicious on a level that you savor every last bite. You have many options that range from what you'd like in your ramen, to the type of broth you prefer. It's a made to order dose of smiles and full tummies.  Try it out if you ever visit the two block range of Las Vegas' China Town.. It's well worth the wait and make sure to have a chilled glass of ice and a cold can of oolong tea.. The creamy melon soda is a must for me too.. It's a vice.",

Ramen Sora has what it takes to satisfy that craving! We came on a Friday afternoon and there was no wait.   We ordered their deluxe sora ramen with miso broth and it was so GOOD. The broth is hot and rich in miso flavor, but it's not your regular store bought miso flavor! Sora's miso broth has depth and a fatty pork richness flavor as well. The noodles are chewy and thick. It's the perfect consistency that I love in ramen noodles. It went very well with the rich miso broth. The charshu pieces were thick and flavorful. It has a very nice charred flavor. The seaweed and bamboo pieces were all great.   The only thing that could be better is their soft-boiled egg and the broth gets too salty after several slurps. My egg was a bit overcooked.   Other than that, this place was awesome! $10 for a delicious bowl of awesome ramen. It can't get any better than that!",

Broth at the bottom is always hotter, so be sure to mix everything up so that the temperature could be even. The Gyoza was ok. I love home made Gyoza so I always give it a shot anywhere I go.. hoping that they are not the frozen Chinese market kind . It wasn't terrible, though . Service went pretty fast, and courteous .",

The broth was overly salty and I couldn't taste anything else. The noodle was decent but the ingredients were very lacking, the meat wasn't very good, and there was too much green onion. Supposedly there should be bean sprouts in my soup, but there was none. And my soup was lukewarm when I got it. My buddy's bowl tasted alot better.   Very disappointing.",

As we walked in they all greeted us in Japanese. Restaurant was a little small maybe a max sitting is 50 but not sure.   Since it was lunch time there was a wait. We only waited for like 15-20 minutes. We ordered gyoza(really good) and my wife ordered the deluxe Sora ramen(large bowl) and I ordered the spicy ramen(large bowl). I loved the ramen best I've had in awhile. The spice level was perfect for me and my wife's ramen was good too.  I would recommend this place to anyone and I would return back to Ramen Sora. 5 stars from me",

    "text": "I enjoy ramen but it usually isn't the first choice for noodles for our family. But this time, we had a guest with us who made the final call for Sora. I'll always lean toward something with a little more heat and Sora has the spiciest ramen I've ever had called the Screaming for Vengeance.  We had a 15 minute wait for the very small dining room on a mid Saturday afternoon, but there's seating inside and a bench outside for you to relax once you put your name on the list. Service was friendly and fast for us as we were in and out in about 45 minutes. It's a pretty small menu with no tonkotsu. You can choose to have a bowl that's focused on a specific topping such as nori, negi, or menma. The \"deluxe\" is the way to go if you like all the toppings.  As for my miso Screaming for Vengeance, don't let the heavier broth with a nice lump of killer spicy meat fool you into thinking this is some kind of docile animal. It's a beast and the heat hit me midway, at the end, and stayed way past its welcome all the way until a couple of hours later when I could still feel some burning in my stomach. I'd give it an easy 8/10, pushing 9 to the point where I needed every napkin to dry off the lingering effects of the heat. I still enjoyed the noodles and the chasu, but the heat was right on the border of too much.  Also ordered were a miso ramen and two shoyu chashu ramens. All bowls were slurped up quickly and without complaint. The total was $43 for four. Next time, I'll ask if they charge for buckets of water so I can have one readily available to dump over my head.",

We went here on Saturday night and there was a wait, probably about 30 minutes? Once we were seated, service was quick and friendly. Most of our party ordered the Butter Ramen, but I opted for the Chashu Miso Ramen - the pieces of pork were so soft and melted in my mouth and my bowl came with 3 pieces of Chashu.  My boyfriend got the Spicy Miso Ramen which came with one piece of meat and he preferred mine - just due to how delicious the Chashu was. We'll be back soon!",

We got a table for four people, as we had two more people in my group coming. The server was quick to take our order. Which consisted of two orders of very, very yummy Mochi ice cream. Only one flavor which was mango. I am a huge fan of mango so that was perfect! Then the Otsumami Platter, a combination of seared Chashu (Pork belly), Menma (Bamboo shoots) and two soft boiled eggs. The food was great, if you're not into salty foods, be warned. The meats are seasoned to perfection, however after a while, you can really taste it starting to become salty. Unfortunately we didn't get any ramen. We were still waiting for our friends. The workers were sweet about it, encouraging us, even when the two others didn't show. They allowed us to keep the table (it wasn't busy at this time) until we finally gave up on the others coming. We made sure to thank them very much for that. Great food, great staff, priceless service.",

The pork was amazing, it literally melts in your mouth. We were all thought the food was great. I recommend getting the large size if you love eating ramen. I am disappointed by the fact their green tea comes in a can though. The staff here were really great when I went, very friendly.",

I'm no food critic, but I know what pleases me. I got the Screaming For Vengeance and was pleasantly surprised with the heat and flavor. The broth was thick and flavorful and the noodles were thick and absorbed the flavor well. If you're going to drink, get the pitcher. More bang for your buck. Right now this is my go to ramen spot in Vegas, but I'm currently on a quest to try them all in the Southwest side of town until I find the best.",

It's pretty much kitchen sink ramen.  It's hard to find a sink that tastes good, but this place has it.  The noodles are done right.  The chashu is really good.  It's a thicker cut which I'm not a fan off, but I liked it a lot.  My friend had the butter corn with spicy meat.  I know that I'll be ordering that next time.  It had a slab of butter on top when it was served.  There's no way that can taste bad.  I can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "Small, busy ramen joint tucked awkwardly in between two major roads. I'd call it a hidden gem but it seems enough people know about it such that it's not really all that hidden.  I had the deluxe ramen, with the shoyu base. Now, this is a taste preference but I'm a big fan of tonkotsu as a base, but I didn't see that as an option. For me, anything else just lacks the special something that a homemade tonkotsu brings to the equation. So while I will drink all the broth in a tonkotsu, I mainly left the broth go and concentrated on the meat and noodles.  Here's the good part, an order gives you three nice pieces of chasu. Certain other places will give you two, or one and some ground pork, but Ramen Sora doesn't skimp on the portions. Yay! The chasu was definitely the highlight of the meal. The noodles were solid. The other ingredients, a bit more meh, but they nailed two of the three essentials, and if you like the soy sauce base, you'll probably enjoy it more than I did.  Overall though, the dinner didn't entirely sit well with me. So, I think it is a three star experience for me. There's a decent chance it'll be better for you though.",

Even for miso ramen, which is already quite thick to begin with, this was molasses-thick. I like how they include a soft-boiled egg; so many places nowadays nickel-and-dime you for every single item. However, the broth was on the overly-salty side. I tend to salt the hell out of my foods but this a bit too much.  I also split some side orders with a friend. Seared premium pork chashu was delicious; savory pieces of pork chashu with scallions. Just the right amount of char and a good balance of fattiness to give it that extra flavor. Pork fried rice was a good complement to the pork chashu; not too salty but still enough flavor. My only gripe is that it could've used a bit more pork, skimpy amounts.  All in all, I won't complain too much because it's not bad for the price. Small parking lot in the back, or look for street parking.",

    "text": "Located off Spring Mountain Rd. In Las Vegas. The place from the outside looks like an old building not decorated or neon lit like some places. Parking lot is tight and can fill up fast. Inside the place is not big kind of your typical ramen place a few tables and space is limited. They have some choices of ramen to choose from bowl sizes are from regular to extra large no small lol. The service was great and pretty fast. I got some edamame and the corn butter ramen. I know you're thinking corn butter all it is a scoop of corn and butter on top that is on the side of your ramen in top of the noodles. The ramen was good and tasty. Overall I recommend this place for ramen if you want something away from the Strip or Downtown LV areas.",

I was surprised that there was a whole slice of butter in it that melts and makes your broth extra creamy as you mix it in. It's probably not the healthiest thing, but you completely forget that as you're tasting the broth. The butteriness also helps to coat all the noodles as you're shoveling them in their mouth. And the noodles are cooked exactly the way I like ramen noodles; they're soft and a little wavy in texture, but also have a nice medium hardness. It also comes with corn and a soft boiled half egg. I miss this bowl already!  Bf ordered the Killer Spicy ramen, which I only took a bite of, and the broth was really spicy and peppery. He's one to handle spice, but yet he was reaching for his water pretty often.   Sizes are regular and large, and the regular was smaller than most. I didn't come super hungry, but I could still finish the entire bowl. Small parking lot also in the back.  Highly recommend the Butter Corn!",

My daughter had the fried rice, it was also great and very flavorful! Ramen Sora is now my favorite ramen place!! I've been to Monta, Jinya, Kobo Ramen and they were all more salty then Ramen Sora. My daughter use to love Jinya because they had corn and Edamame, but the soup base was a little more salty. Now we've found a place that has both and the soup base is also delicious and reasonable. Jinya was a little more expensive, but it's about the taste too and now here's a place that has both taste and also quite reasonable too! Hope this helps someone looking for a fantastic ramen place!!",

I actually like ramen more than pho! There is not much left to write about this place, because everyone else is already said everything. My favorite ramen is the miso based Ramen Deluxe. I eat this if I am really hungry, otherwise I just order the regular bowl, but always the miso, and always adding extra butter. That's how I like it! Also like their Gyoza appetizer. Very flavorful, tender, never dry. Canned drinks are served, so there is no refills!  This place is always so busy! But it's worth waiting! Last seating is 10:30pm, so make sure you arrive accordingly!",

The menu was fairly easy to order. If you add an additional $1.50 you get an upgrade size and then $2.50 for even super large size. We had a table for 5 and we thought the wait would've been long and it wasn't. The longest we waited was like 15 minutes. I love spicy and the KILLER SPICY ramen was over the top spicy. I can still handle it but do I enjoy it? Not really... I wanted a kick to my ramen and to taste their broth so next time I'll settle for the lesser spicy ramen (Spicy ramen ) instead. Do note when I get Japanese curry, I give myself a  #10 and it was perfectly spicy. For those of you who want a kick to your ramen but still wanted the miso taste, I would opt for the Spicy Ramen and not the Killer Spicy Ramen. Wonderful service overall and it's a big plus when all their staffs in front of the restaurant are Japanese.",

Whether you're coming with a small or large group, I recommend arriving a little before they open for lunch and you're guaranteed to be seated quickly. Sometimes even if you arrive right when they open or only a little after, there could be a wait already. My favorites to get are the deluxe, corn butter, and spicy, all with miso broth. The portions are perfect, although the deluxe is a bit more filling (obviously). The broth is so flavorful and thick, super delicious. I've come here at night a few times, and there has always been a wait. If you're really craving for some good ramen, it's worth the wait. The service is good, pretty quick considering how busy they get. Definitely one of my to-go places for ramen, and one of my favorites in town!",

My choice for dinner was the miso ramen deluxe (large size, because hey, who am I trying to fool right?). The broth was divine. Such a complexity of flavor, and just enough to keep the soup-to-noodle ratio perfect. The noodles themselves were the consistency that ramen should be; slightly chewy and smooth and slurpable. The deluxe comes with charsiu, which is sweet pork. Sora's is thick-cut, very juicy and not at all dry like it is at some restaurants. Then there were pieces of nori (seaweed), menma (bamboo shoots), negi (green onion), and a boiled egg. The menu offers plain versions of the ramen dishes for those who prefer a more simplistic approach, but I enjoyed everything that was going on in that bowl. An order of gyoza accompanied my ramen, and I was completely full after that.   Our table split the bill, and with our two large deluxe bowls, one super size deluxe bowl, and two orders of gyoza, the price came out to $15 each (including tip). Totally affordable and it sure did hit the spot. Save a table for me next time, Ramen Sora! I'll be back :)",

Now for Ramen Sora it's not bad for Vegas but I actually like Monta better than Ramen Sora. Sorry Sora but their broth is better. You will be the place when Monta is packed or closed.",

I was thrilled to find out that Vegas' China Town has PLENTY of other great ramen spots besides the super popular (and yucky) Monta Ramen.   When I was here I ordered myself a bowl of the Corn & Butter Ramen with a side order of spice (which basically means a heaping scoop of spicy meat, yes, meat!).   I'm glad I decided to come here for a random late lunch because I can tell this place also gets packed. Especially since their food is ON POINT.  -Ramen noodles are THICK baby and cooked perfectly.  -Broth is BOMB. Not too salty and temperature is HOT, not lukewarm like what we experienced over at Monta Ramen. -Soft boiled egg also delicious. -Any bowl of ramen with corn automatically gets bonus points from me.   I seriously still dream about the ramen I had here. Thank goodness I vlog ever so often and was able to capture this deliciousness the weekend I was there: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DqTRkO0AT9sE&s=b0e8424891ecf93b6fc6912f82ca66b07b50752c9c12dc98e48c0f1879cbabba\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=qTRk...</a>",

Service is quick and fast and the employees are always on top of it.   I ALWAYS get the Large Deluxe sized Ramen with either miso broth or shoyu broth depending on my mood. Most of the time, I get the miso broth. I always request to take out the bamboo shoots only because it has this weird texture... but that's just my opinion. They have regular, large, and the big boy \"super sized.\"  Parking can be a hassle on a busy night but that is expected. It is also expected that the line will be out the door on a chilly night. Give this place shot. I, myself prefer Ramen Sora over MONTA because of the broth in my preference. The broth here is way better and isn't creamy or thick.",

I get seated in less than 3 minutes even though it was a busy day and the menus have several different types of Ramen flavors. I picked the Shoyu Ramen with seaweed, egg, some bamboo shoots, a piece of meat and scallions. It was delicious!!! I ordered the iced green tea and this was a great experience for lunch break.

Decided to go here since the other Japanese restaurant was closed. As we walked in, they shout out a big welcome chant and take us to our seat. I think our timing was very lucky, we came in around 6ish pm and there was no line. This place is pretty small cant really have a big group here if you're planning to have a party of 8+ or 10+ during dinner.   So they have so many choices to pick from. I went with Deluxe Miso Ramen and for an extra $1 -$2  for super size was worth it, if you're really hungry. The miso broth was very good and full of flavor. I was be ware of their \"Killer Spicy Meat.\"  Thank god i order it on the side in a separate plate. Barely nip a tiny piece of meat and i was breaking into  sweat and i could really feel the heat in my mouth.",

When we asked for the bill since we were with a friend we took separate checks. She finally asked at that time if something was wrong when she saw a full bowl of ramen sitting there in front of me. we told her I did not like it and I do not want to change it to something else since I tasted my husband and I did not like that either. My husband did not like his ramen he said it was a weird smell and taste to it. His ramen was also warm almost cold.  I was still charge for my meal and I know its a business so I decide to pay for the dinner I didn't eat. Just the fact that she saw me not eating and not bother to come was what pissed me off the most horrible service not accommodating restaurant.",

Parking is right in the back with a huge lot!   Thankfully when we came in the place wasn't to crowded, we waited only a few minutes for a table. The workers greeted us upon walking in. As much as I love ramen I just couldn't eat a lot so I shared a bowl with a girlfriend. We got the spicy miso ramen but extra spicy. The noodles are on the thicker side which is what I like, and the broth was so delicious and nothing to oily for my recovering stomach. It came with ground meat and boiled egg. The prices here are reasonable and they do give a good amount of serving. I'm definitely coming back here again the next time I'm in Vegas.",

I was expecting some major heat, but it failed to live up to its title.  Even so, I've been back twice because at least their hotter than the others. All the ingredients are fresh, and the chasu is tasty.  As for the service, I've had extremes.  The first time I went during lunch, the waitress was short with guest and didn't ever come by to refill my tea.  I had to walk to the counter and ask for more tea and water.  When I did, it turned out everyone needed more water.  She went through 2 pitchers. When I went back in the evening, it was a much better staff all around.  I'll give them 3.5 the first time and 4.5 the second time.",

Can't recall the last time I was here, but I'm sure as heck don't ever remember seeing anything with a warning IE Spicy Ramen with a Vengeance.  Hehe well okay then, YORO motha-bitches!!  For plan B I ordered a side of pork belly as well because im down, but not THAT down.  I'd opt for the shio version but between you and me it makes no difference.  You won't be able to taste shit after the 3rd bite anyway.  How were the noodles cooked?  Better yet, how was it even possible that none of the ingredients weren't disintegrated? Long hair don't care at that point.  The only thing i was thinking about was the lesson the next time my brain decide to have something soupy ever again.  Bitchass.  I did managed to finish the bowl; however, i didn't go as far as pouring the rest into my eyes.  Down but not that down.  Besides, i was seeing shit already and my butthole was already loosening up.  +1 on the chopsticks for coming through tho. They held their shape rather well even after all that abuse.  Since I couldn't taste I'll just tell you it downright smell like bellybutton lint.  That's right, reek of fungus and bacteria.  Doesn't sound too pleasant either does it?  Don't believe me? Swab your hole prior to ordering and see for yourself (For you \"outies\" out there find someone with an innie and ask for a sample). Then tell me IF IT IS VENGEANCE YOU STILL SEEK?!!! *hi-yah!!*   Okay, maybe it wasn't that bad, but for sure it wasn't any good BY FAR!  I'd never doubt it would've been really, really spicy, but i was expecting some glorious flavor along with it.  Instead i was presented with a bowl of pure chili oil, noodles, and other fixings; soft boiled egg, nori, ground pork, char siu etc .  A normal person would have died already, but your boy came through to tell you it's not all that.  Rather it's the Miso that makes Sora a respectable Ramen-Ya in the valley.   But not vengeance. Nothing good ever comes from revenge.  Not even the spike in weight reduction was worth it.  *protip*  Poop at home for the next 48hrs if you can.  Also buy some odor spray for your feet because they will be handing out roundhouses all day long!",

This place only has a few tables -- so during lunch hour, prepare to wait to be seated. It's always packed. Their waitresses are pretty attentive, and ordering Take Out is always super fast too. 15 mins tops to get your food.. Noodles are cooked perfectly.. so far, I'm a fan.",

The chashu is super tender and full of flavor. When you come here, definitely eat your ramen with a glass of melon cream soda. It pairs so well together.",

Sora is simplicity at its best:  - One bowl of perfectly cooked, slightly chewy ramen.  - Two choices of  flavorful broth (salt or miso).  - Three topping combinations:  basic (excellent chashu, soft boiled egg, and veg), Sapporo  (basic plus butter and corn),  or \"American\"  (basic with three times more chashu and/or nori).    - Like it spicy?  Add a Thai garlic chili paste.  - Sides?  OK fried rice, OK chashu bits on rice, OK curry on rice, Good but oily gyoza. (NO TONKATSU)  Efficient service.  It's Japanese fast food after all.  Pushing the limit for Vegas cheap eats at around $9.00 a bowl but well worth it for the quality and uniqueness.  Try it soon.  It might not be so great when its 110 outside.",

Food (4 stars):   There are three different type of broths here: 1) shio (light clear salty) 2) shoyu (soy sauce) 3) miso (creamy salty) There are also three different sizes 1) regular 2) large (1/2 size added to reg) 3) super size (1/2 size added to large) --- The regular size is perfect for me but the fiancee ordered a large size and he was content. There is an extra $1 added to each size up.   I can vouch that the spicy miso ramen is the best ramen here, especially for those who love spicy food! The creamy spicy broth melts in your mouth along with the soft wet noodles. The spicy miso ramen comes with a huge piece of chasu, bamboo shoots and chopped green onion, 1/2 an egg, and spicy ground meat. I tried the shio and shoyu ramen and it was alright.   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramen-sora-las-vegas?select=0vjKNr87LblVN2JuatKoTg#Nb98rm37EeqWqQEKGmsh2A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/rame...</a>  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramen-sora-las-vegas?select=0vjKNr87LblVN2JuatKoTg#4gO-6jvqmarA2wYn8mgKTw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/rame...</a>  The gyoza also smelled delicious.   Service (4 stars): The waiters were quick and attentive.   Ambiance (3 stars):  Its located on the corner of S Eldon St and Spring Mountain. If you make a right on S Eldon St, the parking lot on the right side in the back of the building. We went at the end of May and it was 90 degrees in Las Vegas and the restaurant felt like an oven. I was sweating as I was eating the ramen. I think they should turn the A.C. on higher. Theres about 8-10 tables of 2-4 seats and I can imagine how pack it would get during rush hours. I would recommend coming before dinner rush hour around 6pm or earlier to avoid the wait. The restaurant is very dimly light so I opt to sit closer to the window.   Overall, if I am ever in town, I would definitely come back if I am craving spicy ramen!",

It was pretty casual and we weren't exclusive, but I finally pulled the plug when I got fed up from waiting in line EVERY time and just WASN'T GETTIN' ANY.   I don't want you to think you were some rebound though - it was some time before I decided to stop by for a visit, but I have to admit that when I walked in and saw there weren't hordes of people jonesing for a table, I wondered if you were my type. After being seated right away though, I perused the menu and knew we'd hit it off.   Pulling my usual first-date move, I opted for the miso ramen and it was love at first bite. Your bowl of piping hot broth housed a generous portion of noodles that was bedazzled with tender pieces of chashu pork, crispy menma bamboo shoots that snapped with every chew, nori strips for a good crackling, an egg boiled just right, and other veggie toppings. After a few more nights out with you, I came to appreciate that we could be spontaneous with each other. Sometimes I wanted a different broth, or wanted to add other ingredients like corn, butter, or extra pork. Other nights I'd be in a chashu rice bowl mood. Either way, I liked that you were always game to MIX IT UP.   Let me know when you are ready to make it Facebook official. Text me.   XOXO, Sandy",

The menu is very simple and easy to see the items and it's contents. So far this is my second experience of the spot and always pleasant to see the staff engage with they're customers. Ok, now for my review of the ramen itself. This time I have wanted something spicy and I choose the spicy shoyu soy base broth. The noodles itself is good but could be a little bit more chewy and soft but still holds its consistency. The broth is is superb not salty at all very well balanced. The braised pork is nice and soft but a over cooked and falls apart as I picked it up with my chop sticks and still packed with flavor.  It overall it's still a good spot to get you're fix or in my case last minute fix! Hopefully this doesn't discourage anyone from looking for a good ramen spot. They still got me coming here so it's all good but I can live with out the small stuff!",

    "text": "Now I understand why everyone raves about Ramen Sora. I first visited a couple of years ago and now I'm kicking myself that I let so long go by before my second visit. This is some amazing ramen.   The restaurant is very tiny and always busy. Once inside you'll add your name yourself to a clipboard on the counter. There are a couple of benches inside and a bench outside to wait until your name is called. It'll be worth the wait. Once seated our waitress didn't waste time in getting our orders taken and delivered to the table. She checked in often to refill our waters and see if we needed anything.  I ordered Spicy Ramen with Miso Broth. This was five days ago and I'm still thinking about it that amazing flavor. The broth is what really makes the flavor on this dish. The pork and spicy sausage are very flavorful. The whole dish comes together well for a very flavorful and filling dish. We also shared the Pork Belly Appetizer which was smoky and tasty.   The restaurant doesn't really have an ambiance to speak of, but the food is really great and reasonably priced.",

I've tried their other broths but miso is my favorite. The ramen comes with 1 slice of pork (it's thicker than some of the other ramen places I've visited), bamboo slices, green onion, and half an egg. You have the options of adding various side items such as corn, butter, etc for an extra fee. Sometimes I'll get the mini chasu bowl as well because what's better than pairing pork than with more pork? The pork pieces in the chasu bowl have that burnt bbq taste that I love so much. Overall, I highly recommend this place and I will continue to come back.",

I didn't finish my soup, I couldn't - neither did Ness.    We had the butter corn and deluxe miso.  I thought it was just my order of miso that was salty.  Not True.  But people love this stuff.  The family next do us even ordered for to go.  I know growing up my family always salted their food.  But shoot that's why health problems run in the family; high blood pressure peoples...  However, the ramen NOODLES seemed a lot more chunkier and the texture was nice.  So I like the noodles and the soft egg.  Everything else was too salty, like it left a burn feeling - maybe my lips were already mummifying.  Customer service is quick.  They're all nice!  But also busy its difficult to make eye contact to get their attention.  When the crowd slowed a bit, they offered water when we finished our green teas.  Much needed water!  Cannot say I'll have ramen here again.  I think we already have a winning restaurant for our ramen preference.  They gain enough business for people to love eating here so I don't doubt their continued success.  I may try their grand opening restaurant though - Hachi!",

Pick one of the eight ramen choices from the menu (deluxe or spicy are great), one of three soup broths, then the bowl size (regular, large, super-large). Besides add-ons and extra toppings, you can also adjust broth and spice levels.

The food took a while to come out and when it did, they had everyone's ramen except for mine. The waiter taking our order had explicitly written down all of our orders, but failed to put mine in their system. Furthermore, when everyone else had gotten their ramen, none of the other servers noticed that there was a missing ramen for the table (they brought everyone's ramen at the same time). It took me sitting there for a while, as I had hoped it was coming but it wasn't, for me to mention to the server if he could check on my order. They did not seem apologetic and the waiter who took our order never came to our table ever again.   The food was okay, nothing to write home about. It was not spicy and the meat was low quality. Overall, I'm sure there are better ramen spots in the area.  Not to mention nobody ever came to check on us, refill water, or give us our check. Seemed funny that no one checked on us when we were sitting around waiting while there was a wait out the door. It's like they create a wait on purpose. We had to go up to the front to pay.",

It was good and reminded me of Japan's curry.",

Broth was not ok salty.  The noodles were thicker and chewy the way we like it. Service was quick.   We went right before dinner rush 545pm on Tuesday there was no wait. But when we left at 630 there was a wait.   The one less star is for amount of meat I could have used more than one slice and when most places add corn here you have to order it extra.",

You can get on the Yelp waitlist in advance, though, which can save you some time.   The inside is very, very small and cramped.  And noisy.    We tried the gyoza which were very good and perfectly crisp outside with a hot, juicy filling.  I had the deluxe ramen.  Nothing terribly fancy in terms of presentation but a solid tasting broth, and the pork was tender and actually not too fatty.  We also tried some of the fried rice.  Very, very good and not too oily or greasy actually.  Why not finish with some mochi ice cream?  Fairly standard but just the right portion for something sweet after a salty meal without packing on the calories.  The staff were fairly friendly.  Soft drinks are sadly served in cans instead of a soda fountain, so you won't get any complimentary refills.  A little disappointing when eating salty ramen.  Overall a crowded and loud place but some very good ramen!",

This place does it simple, tonkotsu based broth with a choice of shio, shoyu and miso flavor. I always get the spicy miso ramen or the chasu Ramen. I tried the killer spicy ramen once, and only once! The broth is amazing but on a scale from 1- 10 for spiciest, it's a 12. It's a burn you month numbing hot, but it tastes so good, you can't stop eating it.  The spicy miso ramen is so good! The chasu is super tender and the egg is a perfect soft boiled. The broth is what really sets this place apart from other ramen places. It's so savory and flavorful without being overly salty. If you're looking for a good app, definitely try the garlic edamame. You won't be sorry!  I recommend this place highly and can't wait to get my ramen on once more!",

Our friends decided to try something new and picked Sora to be the winner this time around.  The atmosphere for lunch time on a saturday was very chill, not too packed and we got seated fairly quickly. There was about 6 of us. We were then given the menus which had about 6 different ramen styles I believe and then some appetizers on the backside. The waitress came and took our drink and food order within 5 minutes of us sitting.  There are 3 sizes, normal, large and super large. Super large is 2 ramen servings. It was a challenge to get down. I think regular is good or a large if you're hungry. Super was a bit too much and not enough meat.   I had the miso broth which was rich in flavor and bold. I had others with the other broth but, they all said they preferred the miso over theirs. I got this #1 special or most sold one and added spicy meat to it and corn. It filled all of us up good. I would come here again after a night of drunken partying.",

My friend and I were originally going to go to Ramen Hashi but Hashi closes their kitchen at 9:30 PM despite closing at 10 PM. So we decided to drive down the street to eat at Ramen Sora.   We got there at around 9:50 PM and we were seated promptly. There wasn't a wait for us since they had a table for two already open.   Ramen Sora has three different broth bases for you to choose from: miso (soy bean paste), shoyu (soy), or shio (salt). So you pretty much choose whichever ramen bowl you want and let them know what base you want with it.   My friend got their chasu ramen bowl with miso base and I got their corn butter ramen with shoyu base. They use the thickish wavy type of ramen noodles, which is definitely my preference!   It didn't take too long for our bowls of ramen to come out and when it did, it looked pretty delicious! My bowl came with a slice of chasu, corn, green onions, bamboo shoots, and half an egg. It's quite unfortunate that it's the thick slice of chasu versus the thin. I prefer thinner slices. The egg was also overcooked but that's pretty normal around here. The noodles were pretty decent! It would have been perfect if it was a tad bit more firm.   The shoyu broth's flavor was pretty good. Enough flavor and not heavy/oily at all. It went great with the noodles. Although I'm not sure if the butter did much to the flavor haha. I also tried my friend's miso base and hers definitely bursts with flavor but it was also on the heavier side. If I had gotten miso, I probably would not be able to finish my bowl due to the heaviness.   Overall, pretty decent! Not too bad. Definitely a thumbs up that I could finish a bowl of ramen  here. A lot of ramen places make their broths too heavy and too salty and it ends up making me sick. Ramen Sora doesn't! I wouldn't mind coming back to try their spicy ramen :)",

She gave wonderful suggestions and answered all of our questions.    We ordered the fried rice, gyoza, garlic edamame, miso ramen with corn. Everything was truly wonderful. I was surprised by the rich flavors.   Interior is quaint. But there is several tables with booth backs, and a large family style table with bar stool type seating in the middle. Pricing was beyond reasonable, with good portions.   I would def recommend   Location is Spring Mountain / Decatur - parking is a small lot, but there is street parking.",

My bestie got the Miso ramen and she liked it as well! Good flavor overall. The staff was friendly and the service was quick.   I'd recommend this place to anyone wanting some good ramen!",

    "text": "Best ramen in Vegas? That's what Ramen Sora claims to be. Although I can't say for sure if they are the best, I can certainly say that it is one of my favorite ramen spots now.  Ramen Sora is located in Chinatown, which is a competitive part of Vegas. They have their own parking lot and the place is small with around 10 tables. However, there was a substantial line when I arrived, so given that, I took it as a sign that it must be good.   The menu is pretty simple. There are three sizes: regular, large, and super size. There are three broths to choose from: shoyu (soy sauce), miso (soybean), and shio (salt). There are a few ramen choices, but they all contain pork from what I can remember.   Although the wait to get a table can be long, the food comes out pretty fast. I ordered a curry bowl appetizer and it came out almost instantly. My ramen came out before I was done with my curry. We ended up choosing the chashu ramen with the shoyu base and the ramen sora deluxe with miso base. I recommend the first for meat lovers. It's pretty hefty and will fill you up quickly. The miso base was my favorite of the two. It was very light and refreshing.   I really liked the customer service. Every employee was polite and greeted each customer with a traditional Japanese welcome. Another thing I wanted to point out is that each table is equipped with chopsticks and hair bands, so if you forget one, you can tie up your hair no problem so it won't end up in your ramen.   Cute and small place with good, quick service and even better ramen. Not much else I can ask for.",

    "text": "My coworker told me this is the best place for good ramen and he is right! We came here on a Friday evening and honestly, I did not know what to expect. Outside the building looks a bit run down, parking is limited, and there are post signs and red flags reminding customers not to leave their valuables in the car. As soon as I got inside the restaurant, the one thing that came to mind is Ramen Girl. If you have never seen the movie, go watch it.   The great thing about this restaurant is they have a helpful illustration board that gives you visual instruction on what to do and what to expect when you walk in. First thing, write your name on the list and then wait to be called. While you are waiting, decide on your broth (miso, shiyo, or shio) and bowl size (regular, large, or super). Then once you get seated, they will hand you the menu and ask what drink you would like, and tell them the soup you want. Don't forget it's not just ramen, they offer appetizer and dessert as well.   My coworker had the Melon Creamy Soda ($2.85) for his drink, a small bowl of Mini Chashu Curry ($3.50), and Basic Shoyu Ramen ($8.00). As for mine, I ordered Green Tea and chose Corn Butter Shoyu Ramen ($9.50). My green tea is serve hot and it taste so pure and very calming, I wish they would give me more in a teapot instead of a cup. When they brought my order, my coworker point out the bowl is suppose to be a large and they gave me a regular. The nice lady did offer to fix it, but I told her not to worry and gave her assurance that I'm okay with it. I give credit to my coworker though for convincing me to try the noodles here, because my ramen actually taste delicious!   I have never been to Japan, so I would not know what ramen looks like over there. But in my bowl the noodles are thick and wavy, the shoyu broth is hot and savory and not salty. It has sweet corn with a slice of butter, bamboo shoots, and soft boiled egg, and the roast pork is juicy and tender, it just melts in your mouth. For a regular ramen, the noodle portions are just enough for me to feel satisfied. Even if Friday is their busy night, the service staff is attentive and they are quick to respond. The restaurant is small and seating is limited. If you are planning to arrive as a big group, I highly suggest you call first. The wait time can be a hassle and I notice more people coming inside. I have not tried any appetizer or dessert and that gives me all the more reason to come back, especially for more ramen!",

    "text": "Went here because you know who had a wait out the door again so I thought I'd give this a go and I have to say that I was very surprised. I think this place beats out Monta. The ramen here as described by many others is a little heavier and has that al dente bite to it. The chashu pork is thicker and isn't a small little sliver. And I know this is super weird to say but it actually feels good in there temperature wise. I know many may think who the f- cares, but that's huge when it'll be the summertime soon and you're trying to put down a bowl of hot ramen. At Monta you're right where the kitchen is and sometimes the sun hits that window at that perfect magnifying angle where its just hot (insert hooker in church joke here) but Ramen Sora doesn't have that issue so I like that. Additionally, the service is friendly and quick.  The only thing I can say that Monta beats them out on is the broth. The broth didn't jump out at me like Montas tonkotsu-shoyu ramen. Also, theres no napkin dispenser, they just lay down one napkin. I know weird, but when you eat with a messy eater who keeps spilling soup all over himself like he's literally trying to wash his face with it, one napkin won't cut it. (Dont worry,  your sloppy table manner secrets are safe with me Steve). Outside of that though, I will definitely stop by this place first when I'm craving ramen.",

The hair was obviously not  mine because it was black and no one in my party has black hair. I explained I would take a small replacement as opposed to the large I ordered since I ate some until I found the hair. She then had to check to see if she could since they wear hats. Kidding?! Needless to say, I will never go back. Not even a sorry...just an implication that it had to be me cus they wear hats. What a shame...",

Depending what time you go there is almost always a wait - not long unless you get there at prime meal time. The service is always on point, but the location is small, but cozy.  All the broths are delicious. Would recommend if looking for a ramen spot to call your own.",

Ambiance: 3 - I like the casualness of the place, and how it looks like an actual ramen joint! There's not much seating, it can probably seat 30-35 people at a time. It is plain and clean, but not very interesting inside.   Service: 5 - Loved the service and our server! It was a nice change to see someone who wasn't Asian serving at an Asian ramen place! He was actually really helpful and really kind. They were fast at bringing our food out and filling our water. They are always checking on you and always available to service you!    Food: 4 - I liked it, but I didn't like it. Just like I said earlier, I feel that I'm pretty picky about the soup I slurp! The one thing that I really enjoyed is that every order, though it might have the same soup base, has a completely different flavor, which I really enjoyed! Because of this, I can't say that there was a favorite or a soup that was better above all the rest, because they are all tasty/interesting on equal levels.   I just can't recommend one, so my advice would be to close your eyes, spin around, and point your finger at the menu! If you're a soup lover, you'll probably enjoy the flavor no matter what you choose!!",

Came in about an hour before closing and it was still pretty busy. Service was kind and friendly. Sat my family of 5 in about 10 minutes. The place probably isnt good for parties bigger than 6 if you want to all sit together.   I wouldn't describe the place as small but more as intimate lol. The tables were close together but you definetly had space to eat and talk with whoever you're with without bothering other people.   The food itself, amazing. Ah. Ma. Zing. I got the large deluxe ramen with an extra egg. I usually get tired of eating ramen by the end of the meal because I get too used to the taste but this was different. The soup was rich and the pork slices were the biggest slices I've ever seen. Just thinking abou eating the seaweed with the noodles after its been soaked with broth is making my mouth water .  I will definetly be coming back here whenever I go to Vegas.",

Waiter was really nice and patient with my \"are you sure this isn't salty\" comments. lol He recommended the shio (least salty) broth; and since I like spicy, I added that to the mix. My BF had spicy broth with spicy meat.   First taste was a True pleasant one =) Broth was spicy enough to my liking and NOT SALTY ----- YAYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!! Noodles were soft but, not too soft. Which is, also, to my liking. Needless to say, I drank up alot of the broth...and had the BF kill the rest of my noodles.  Waiter asked if the broth was good and I just smiled and thanked him with a fat tip. It aint GomaTei but, I'm still beyond excited to have a ramen spot in Vegas to call my own.",

Moving on towards the food, they have three types of soup bases, miso, shoyu, shiyo! (I think it's shiyo) the selection was very pleasing, I had a hard time choosing! But in the end I got spicy ramen with a shoyu soup base and some gyoza! My boyfriend got the super spicy ramen (which is what they're known for) and so did our friend as well.    They expected it to be super spicy since our friends warned them that they would get a stomach ache but in the end they said it was not spicy at all. Maybe our other friends are just weaklings to spicy! Lol!   I liked my ramen a lot! It was not too spicy, it was more like a mild type of spicy. I really enjoyed the chashu pork though! Very thick and flavorful slices. I could almost just eat the pork itself as a dish! (They do have a chashu pork bowl! I'm getting that next time). My gyoza was good as well. Nothing too fancy, the dipping sauce was very sour but in the good way!  Service was quick and simple so there was nothing to complain about.   Overall my experience was pleasant. I wouldn't mind coming back here again if we were in the area. (I live closer to fukumimi and they're just as good!!!). But no doubt about it there will be a next time for this place! My mouth is just watering thinking about the chashu.",

Wait time at 2:30 on a Saturday was still 20 minutes.  I do think this place is hands-down better than Monta and highly recommend eating here. The noodles are toothsome and good. Portions are big, so those 80-pound Asian girls that eat twice their body weight can still walk away with a full belly.  The meat in the bowls is flavorful and has a little more texture than Monta's.  If you had to pick one of the two famous ramen shops in Vegas, I highly recommend this one. Has more room, more flavor in the food, and bigger portions. Also, there is a really big table that can accommodate a party of eight or more.  The only weird comment I have is if you sit along the wall. It's right against the exterior, and I don't think it's insulated well- it's like sitting on a slab of rock in a Japanese hot spa since it's really warm on your butt and back. While consuming hot soup during the summer, this leads to a toasty experience, but the food is great, so I would make sure you get a glass of ice water with it and wear a tank top, and you'll be fine. ;)",

One week, their ramen will taste great. The next time, it will taste average. The next time, it will taste bad. Then it will taste good again. However, the great times are few and far between. One time I even got miso ramen with NO MISO IN IT. I don't get it. When Sora does their miso ramen correctly, it is amazing. However, I do have to say that it is very oily. That is the one thing that Sora is consistent about - their ramen is very oily and nearly greasy. Especially this last time I went. Also, their shio ramen and shoyu ramen are very poor. They don't taste anything like actual shio and shoyu ramen, which is a shame because you really can't find shio ramen in Las Vegas except at Sora.  Lastly, when it comes to ramen shops these days, I have a system by which I judge their ramen. If I would rather eat Japanese Instant Ramen (Instant ramen from Japan is really excellent quality), then the ramen at the shop isn't good for me. I would rather eating Japanese instant ramen than go to Sora.",

The broth had plenty of depth, just enough salt to pique my tastebuds, well seasoned and tender slices of pork, and thin wavy noodles with plenty of chew to them. An order of gyoza comes with four dumplings. Beautifully crispy on the bottom but leaving an oily aftertaste.

I'm glad another staff member checked up on us to remedy the situation. Apart from all of that, the ramen was fantastic. I got the spicy ramen, which was spicy enough to make me sweat but the spiciness did not overwhelm my tastebuds. I'm happy I didn't get the spicier version. Broth was a winner in my books, and I enjoyed it more than many offerings in LA and NYC. I would recommend the extra drive out of the strip for everyone.",

I called and spoke to the manager the very next day and explained how all of us were sick. She immediately referred me to speak to their insurance company and still did not offer me any type of refund. Like really? She can't handle it herself, she has to push it off on someone else in their \"insurance company\". This sets off a red flag with me, it makes me think how many times this has happened for her to have the insurance company information readily available for me to call...  I just found out from another yelper a couple days ago, Ramen Sora's health grade has been recently been decreased to a C from an A. If you now anything about the food business, you will know that takes ALOT of violations /demerits for that to happen.   Hmmm I wonder why their grade dropped....maybe because of their UNSANITARY conditions as one of the reasons....??",

It's the best one in my opinion,  but then again I have yet to try the miso and shoyu (soy sauce) ramen.  The broth is delicious!  I always end up drinking all of it. The noodles are cooked perfectly. The tamago is great! The yolk is still gooey and the whites absorbed all the good flavors.   They also have the best chashu! The chasu in the ramen is a great balance of fat and meat. The chashu bowl is bomb! They have two sizes, mini $3 and large $7.  I usually get the mini one since I have ramen too.   Overall, great food and great service.  It's definitely one of the ramen spots that I would recommend to everyone. Remember to stay hydrated! The salt ramen will make you thirsty haha.",

I also had a curry bowl and while I am familiar with Japanese curry, the flavor here was too much; it overpowered the chasu and there wasn't a good balance between the rice and the sauce.   The service here, however, was on point. They will not seat you until your entire party is here and if you're wondering why - it's because the place is small and seating is limited and it gets busy quickly. We went on a Monday at 11:30 am and it was 50% filled. There are sets of tables of 4 and then one large table that I think accommodates 10 people (maybe 12). It is a community table, so be prepared to eat with strangers. By the time we left an hour later, it was 90% filled with 3 groups waiting for tables.   All in all, it was ok. I recommend the spicy ramen bowl and the miso broth.",

By 12 it was packed with 10+ people waiting.   Ambiance: Kinda reminds me of some of the ramen places in Japan.   Food: We have dined here twice in the past. The first time the ramen was not hot. On our second visit we asked to make it EXTRA HOT and it was... hot enough? This time we again asked to make the soup EXTRA HOT... It was not extra hot.   There was no steam coming off the soup. The menma (bamboo shoots) were still cold(!?). The soup was kind-of hot, but not nearly hot enough. With mostly japanese workers and japanese clientele eating Ramen you would think they would understand that the soup should be served AS HOT AS POSSIBLE. I want to use my asbestos lips and burn a few layers of skin off the roof of my mouth as is tradition when eating ramen. We told the staff and they touched our bowls to check the temperature? Weird.   Besides the consistent temperature issues....  The chashu's dominate flavor is soy sauce. It lacks depth. The soup is rich, although plain. The noodles were simultaneously clumped and broken. It was one of the worst ramens I have had.   Do not recommend.",

I have also successfully converted 8 of my friends so far and they agree the ramen is pretty damn tasty.  I am from southern California where there are at least 50 ramen shop and I have to admit this is my favorite place. Here's why:  Service- there is usually a 10-15 minute wait because it is popular and good. The waiters are very nice and the food comes out in a timely manner.  Food- this is what I want to talk about. The broth is flavorful and not salty. I usually order the number one and they are generous with their meat, it comes with four pieces. The noodles are a perfect consistency. Ugh I am craving it right now as I write this.  Price-reasonable. $10 for the special which comes with seaweed, egg, mushroom, and meat. They also offer large for a dollar extra and xl for two dollars. They are pretty generous with their portions. I struggle to finish a large and I find the regular size to be perfect.  Location- off the strip in Chinatown. Looks sketch at night but you'll be alright!",

I decided on Sora for one reason and one reason only.... they had a spicy option. I like my ramen spicy. Anyway, a friend and I came here and both got the suicide ramen (or something to that effect, it was spicy broth paired with the spicy meat). It was spicy, which I enjoyed, the noodles were not over done and the meat was tender and tasty. It was a little odd that the spicy meat was served on the side and cold, but no matter.   My main issues with Sora are the following: A) no tonkatsu base... I like the richness of the tonkatsu and feel that the soy base is too salty B) The giant piece of seaweed they stuck in my soup made it kinda fishy and I'm not down with that  I would like to try Monta for a proper comparison, but I have had several ramens in Phoenix that top Sora's (and Phoenix isn't exactly known for ramen so....). On the plus side, the portions were large and the prices were not so large, gotta like that!",

    "text": "I would like to start this review by saying DON'T order the Screaming Vengeance ramen if you are on a first date or still in the early awkward nervous stage of your relationship. My girlfriend had recommended I try this place so we stopped in for dinner. After careful review of the menu I decided to order the Screaming Vengeance to impress my girlfriend and show I was a strong, tough guy machismo. WHAT A HUGE MISTAKE! It was delicious but ridiculously spicy. I ended up sweating as if I was in a sauna and went to the bathroom twice to rinse my mouth with water. I'm surprised they didn't charge me for the stack of napkins I used to wipe off my sweat. My girlfriend had a very concerned and confused look the whole time as i was trying to hide the pain. This ramen lives up to its name and is not for anyone who can't handle heat.",

All in all, and great place for ramen. Only downside is that it is a small space. Was there on a sunday afternoon; so it wasn't crowded. But I imagine that dinnertime might involve a wait.

    "text": "We went to Vegas in mid-December where the weather was pretty cold so we decided to have ramen (Japanese noodles soup). One of my sister's friends recommended this place. From the outside the place is not in a good part of Vegas. The inside looks small and old. However, the ramen was super good. The menu is very simple. My tolerance for spicy food is considerably high so I had their spiciest ramen called \"screaming for vengeance\" which is spicy but not too spicy where I could not finish. The soup is very tasty but a bit too salty for me still. We came in a group of 13: my family, my sister's & my cousin's family. We all like the food so much that we all came back the next day. This is definitely a place for you to eat when you visits Vegas. The fried rice is delicious. I tried Orochan in LA but their soup on the spicy ramen is so salty where I can't finish without drinking water to dilute the salt. I found a new ramen place in Arcadia (Yukinoya ramen) and their soup is scrumptious and not too salty. We come to this place a lot.",

    "text": "Short: Pros: Great ramen.  Cons: Loud, fast- moving atmosphere so don't expect a friendly chat. Not the best prepackaged noodles, and a tad overpriced. Do go here if you're interested, it's worth your time.   Long: Went here with a friend and it was good that we arrived early; they got packed quick. We were sat down, ordered our food. One of the downfalls here is that the place is small, and as it's a ramen joint, it's expected of you to eat quick and get a move on. The place is loud with chatter, and you don't have much time to really sit down and comfortably chat.  Food arrived quick. For $11 for their special in a large, it's good proportions, but I don't see where all that money went--especially since ramen elsewhere is a budget outing. Soup was great, the meat was as tender as all hell, sides were great, BUT, the noodles weren't the best pre-packaged and that just crashed the whole deal for me. They're good, but I think the whole dish would be better with cheapy ramen noodles off the store shelf. As the main ingredient for ramen, I can't overlook that.  Still, 4 stars for good ramen. If you want to try this place, I can't see why not.",

It's unassuming from the outside, so GPS it to ensure you don't miss it.  Once inside, the restaurant has an authentic japanese noodle house feel to it.  Ramen Sora isn't that big so expect to wait at least 15 minutes before you'll get seated.  Once you get your food though, be prepared for one of the best bowls of ramen that you've ever had.  In the words of Drake... the miso broth is \"the best I've ever had, best I've ever had, best I've ever had.\"  I don't know what they put in it.  But I clearly finished all of it and had nothing left in my bowl.  The noodles are the cooked perfectly.  The corn added texture with every bite.  The pork was suprisingly tender and the best I've had in comparison to other ramen places.    Aside for the wait, this place is money.  My sister swears that it is the best place to go for a hangover cure as well.",

The only reason it lost a star was that their gyoza wasn't too great.  Not bad, and pretty well priced, but I've had many a plate of superior gyoza. That said, the pork was very flavorful, the soup was very rich, the menma added some very nice flavor, the waitresses were courteous and refilled my water very quickly.   If you're a fan of ramen, definitely give them your business, but be warned, this is northern style, so it could be a bit rich for you like it was for me.  That said, I'll definitely be back to have my friends try it, they just still haven't stolen the number one spot in my heart from monta...  Well, the number 2 spot, number 1 is ramen stadium back in hakata.",

As for the Gyozas, they're the best along with their dipping sauce that make this combo the best yet!

Buuuuuuuuuut, I gotta say that Ramen Sora is right up there, and actually eclipses Monta in some aspects.   Needless to say, you can't go wrong with either one of them, but let's just focus on Ramen Sora.  I love hot stuff, so obviously I ordered the Screaming for Vengance.   I gotta say, it was hot, but I've had hotter.   Not saying that I wanted it hotter, but in my opinion, it was just enough heat to make you say......Damn!   But not enough heat where you couldn't actually taste the food you were eating.  I loved the texture of the noodles and the chashu was very tender and tasty.   The gyoza was good, but I didn't like the fact that you didn't have the shoyu, vinegar, and chili oil on the table to make your own gyoza dipping sauce.   Not a deal breaker, but I typically like the sauce more acidic than how their's was.   Our friends ordered pork fried rice as well which was very tasty.   This spot is super busy, and unfortunately since everybody waits inside, you can't help but feel rushed.   At least at Monta's the long line is outside......hahaha",

Chef vaguely remembered me from a couple years ago when I photographed a new ramen dish right in his working restaurant, for his ad campaign with Las Vegas weekly magazine, a photo he also uses on his menu and that lives on my website  www. stevenjosephphotography .com/food  I asked to try the bowl I'd photographed. He said \"very spicy, OK?\" My stomach said \"not OK\" so I tried something mellower from the civilian section.  This place is small, comfortable, cozy, but not crowded. Lots of room between seats.  Again, I'm a noob, but I think this place is the real deal. The fact that I'm one of the few gringos in here suggests it is autentico.  Now that I've found it again I'm bringing my family here!",

We put our names on the list (party of 2), with one couple ahead; they were seated within a few minutes. As we sat there we watched them clean 4 (FOUR) tables and 2 (TWO) waitresses come to check the list of names. They both looked at the clipboard with only my name on it then looked at us (while I, a female, held hands with my wife) and scurry away. We waited a few more minutes only because the food is so AMAZING!! We were finally seated ONLY AFTER another woman came in and was seated at the many open tables BEFORE us. They gave us dirty beer mugs and dirty serving plates. Then ignored us for most of our time there. This is the first time I have ever seen them slow and thought tonight would be a quick and pleasant visit. I would like to hope we weren't treated so poorly due to us showing a little affection towards one another. But feel as though that is the case.",

    "text": "Ramen Sora's, \"Screaming for Vengeance\" ramen bowl is for people whose stomachs (and egos) love feeling the burn.   It's like their spicy ramen, except two large pieces of dried seaweed are included, and the broth is red from all the mouth burning spices -- that should be a good indication of what to expect. The broth is incredibly spicy, and I have to agree with our waiter that it's as intense as an 8 or 9 in regards to Thai spiciness levels.  As you continue eating, the heat from the spices does intensify. I didn't \"scream,\"  but I was sweating like I was in a sauna. If you like the burn, then I say accept the challenge and order \"Screaming for Vengeance.\" If ya can't take the heat, I was told you can send it back to have the broth diluted.  Bumping my 4-Star rating up to 5. Not because of the fiery ramen, but because the food I've ordered on each of my visits has always remained consistently good. Plus, unlike other ramen places that I love, which I've only given 4-Stars to, I don't have to wait for an hour for a seat to open up.",

Once your ramen is on the table, they couldn't care less about you. If you're lucky you might get a refill of your drink, IF it's a soda or a beer. If you have water, just forget about about it. They can't be bothered to bring a check, or even give you a to go container for an unfinished meal. When I brought this up to the waitress, who's been there for several years, she just gave me a condescending smile and repeatedly said, \"Oh so sorry.\" Couldn't have cared less. Well, I guess I couldn't care less about that tip I was going to give her. Anyways, The ramen is 5 star, definitely, but the service is 1. We have too many ramen restaurants with great service in town these days to accept crappy service from Sora.",

They have a good variety of choices also, with plenty of choices of toppings and side plates. The place is pretty small but the vibe is nice and the food comes out fast so they turn tables pretty quickly. My ONLY complaints would be they need to pay attention to their refills. On 2 different occasions with 2 different servers they left my water empty. Also, we ordered the pork bowl for my daughter and the flavors were so delicious but the pieces of meat were literally all fat, so all that all that was edible was the rice. All in all, it is a fabulous little place and I will definitely come again!",

I got the regular miso ramen and my boyfriend ended up getting the spicy miso ramen. The chasu here is delicious. Nice and tender. The broth is super thick and creamy, but if you don't like it like that you can ask them for some thinning broth. We ate it as is. It was different, but yummy!

The broth warmed me up from the inside out and the noodles were al dente.   We had also gotten the gyoza which was delicious as well.   Fast forward a week later, we go back again and we both get the Chashu Bowl and it is massive! For around $8 we got a bowl we could hardly finish. The pork was covered with some type of soy based teriyaki sauce and over rice. Everything mixed together was delicious but a little too salty.   Definitely a place to go if you want something that will fill you up and inexpensive.",

There isn't much seating, but the ramen does indeed come out fast, and the service is speedy.  I had the spicy miso ramen, super bowl was big enough to share with my mother. The chashu was super tender and the best part of the whole bowl. The broth itself was good. I wouldn't consider it spicy at all. I wasn't kicked by it one bit. The noodles were \"al dente\" as my mother would call it, and their noodles are allegedly handmade so I gotta give them props for that. Other than that, the dish wasn't the best ramen I've had - but it was tasty, nevertheless.  As for the Gyoza, I hate to say it but it was one of the worst gyoza's I've had. I starred at the gyoza and wondered if it was homemade or if it came out of a shirakiku frozen package. Don't waste your time with these dumplings. They're not known for it anyway.  All in all, a great ramen experience. I would DEFINITELY come here for the noodles, but it isn't worth the wait.",

How are you going to a Ramen spot to order a rice bowl? I mean, come on.. right?   So we order and the chasiu pork over rice comes out as the appetizer. I didn't even take a picture of it since it didn't look that great. It was kinda charred. Once we started eating and OMFG.. I take all my words and bad thoughts I had about my so called friend. At that moment, I initiated her into my foodie group. This rice bowl was freaking AHmazing! So amazing that I'm back here again the day after to eat only this dish before I head to the airport.  The Ramen is pretty damn good here too!! Best meal of my short trip here. Thanks, Kit!!",

For some reason my special sora ramen was a little salty compared to what I am used to.   Servers were super nice and helpful.   Crowd there is mainly young people and atmosphere was casual.   Parking is limited so maybe look for street parking.  Price is around $8-$10 per bowl.   Not a bad place to check out if craving for ramen when visiting Las Vegas.  Pretty good choice for lunch on a cold day.",

The reason is because Ramen Sora is so freaking delicious, that when you have Ramen back home, you will be dissappointed that your local spot doesn't live up to the very high bar Ramen Sora has set.  We were passing thru Vegas on our way to Zion, and met up with a friend for dinner. He highly recommended this place, and it was obvious why. When we showed up, the place was packed and there was a 30 minute wait.   When our table was ready, we were seated and we all ordered the Chashu Miso Ramen. When I took my first bite, I was transported to another world. The noodles had a great texture, and the broth had a very delicious and complex flavor. And the pork...Sweet baby Jesus it was out of this world. Moist, with a flavorful crust. Simply amazing.  Ramen Sora is reason enough for me to pass thru Vegas on my way to Zion in the future. In the meantime, I will try to find Ramen that is as amazing as this place closer to home.",

    "text": "Anytime someone talks about ramen in Vegas, it's either in reference to either Sora or Monta. I finally tried one of the two rivals last week. For me, ramen is graded on three components: the noodles, the broth, and the ingredients (usually the pork and the soft-boiled egg). How does Ramen Sora measure up?  There were a number of different broths to choose from, but I decided on the basic shoyu. Right off the bat, the broth was pretty thin in terms of both flavor and depth. I was shocked to later read that you could add a slice of butter to your ramen. That's not something that you want to see at a ramen joint. The noodles were average at best. My favorite part of the ramen was actually the barbecued pork and perfectly soft-boiled egg.   How does the competition down the street compare? Stay tuned for the review on Monta.",

    "text": "We were tired of the buffets and food on the strip, so we decided to find some good asian food. With Yelp's recommendations, we headed to Chinatown!  Like other reviewers mentioned, this is a small, hole-in-the-wall type of ramen place. We arrived late at 9:45pm though, and the wait was not too bad... a little over 20 minutes for our party of 5. They have several tables for twos and fours, but for groups larger than 6, they offer to split your party up. We ended up sitting in the big middle table with bar stools. Even with all the people waiting, the servers had a really fast turnaround with cleaning the tables and getting people seated.  At first I was worried about eating hot soup for dinner since the vegas temps were really high (111 in the afternoon and 105 still later in the evening), but after waiting for a table we all got acclimated to the light air conditioning, and we weren't sweating trying to eat our soup. Problem solved!  Food: There were three main types of broth here- soy sauce, miso, and salt (shino). Four of us opted for the salt ramen and my dad tried out the sora deluxe ramen. We also got a side order of fried rice, which was really flavorful! The salt ramen was very good; not quite up to par (and a little watery) in comparison to the excellent ramen available in the West LA and Irvine area (Sankutora, Tatsu, etc.) but for Las Vegas, it's pretty good. The rest of my family, who only eats ramen occasionally, loved it and my dad enjoyed the deluxe with miso broth. My soup did not come with mushrooms like ramen sometimes does, but it did come with a half egg at no extra charge, which was nice. The noodles were chewy and cooked perfectly.  Everything came out to around $40- an excellent deal considering the quality and location. Four stars!",

If you look for this quality ramen in CA, you would have to pay $4, 5 more.  I will definitely recommend anyone who loves ramen!",

I stayed in Vegas for two weeks this past summer and went here four times, that's how delicious it was even though it was 110 degrees outside.   They have three types, shio (salt), shoyu (soy), and miso. My goto is the Spicy Shio Ramen with extra chasu. Even better accompaniment is the Melon Creamy Soda that is perfect on a warm day. I can always go anywhere in Vegas to get a decent bowl of ramen, but nothing warrants such a craving except Ramen Sora. The broth is memorable and the chasu is soft and juicy.   I only wish they were open past midnight...",

Very tender and flavorful, melts in your mouth.  The service: The service is always good, the wait time however... isn't. The longest I've waited for a seat was 45 min. Which seems extreme considering once your sat, your usually done eating in 30 min with how quick the food comes out. I, however, never mind waiting. It's always worth it!

However they're very accommodating to seating you separately if necessary.  Definitely try out the Deluxe Ramen - Miso style. The broth is very rich and flavorful. The pork cuts are extremely tender and not rubbery at all. The bamboo shoots are authentic as it gets. Definitely a 5/5 tasting ramen.  Getting the Shoyu or Shio can be a bit salty so watch out.   I think the corn butter ramen with miso broth lacks flavor. The small Curry side is average, nothing spectacular.   Parking is on the back.   If you're super hungry, make sure to order an extra large bowl.",

Even though I was not a fan of the shio broth myself, I really feel that others would enjoy the light broth. The floating oil droplets didn't bother me at all and I thought overall it was pretty good. I did enjoy the thick chewy noodles but the broth however was light and actually tasted like chicken soup to me. =x    The service was excellent! My bf and I had some questions and the server took the time to explain everything to us. Water glasses were also promptly refilled. A+++ for service!  So I guess Sora is the place if you want a lighter brother and with a thicker chewier noodle than Monta.",

The service was attentive and efficient. I had my bowl of soup in short order.Im not a master ramen person but I do enjoy a good bowl of noodle soup especially with chashu,which is what I had,I like the fact that you can pile on extra noodles too,I went for the 50% bigger,that was perfect! i think it was a bit more expensive then I remember from similar in los angeles,but by no means was it exorbitant. 15 bucks all in for soup and a coke. all and all I appreciated the whole experience and will return.",

The younger [I can't say Asian because all of them are Asian] lady server came up to us and said \" Can you move over to this table so I can seat a party of 4?\"  I WAS SHOCKED!! I didn't want to embarrass my husband so we moved over as told.  Our ramen came out and it wasn't what I expected.

The noodle was cooked perfectly, their pork was tender, and best part has to be the boiling egg that to me was cooked just right, tender on the outside with a runny yellow... my mouth water just writing about this.. I had try out other ramen joint, and ramen sora will be one of my top choice.. so if ur ever in vegas, craving for a ramen, even on a scorching hot day, go to ramen sora and have yourself a bowl.. until my next trip..",

This place is going to be good.  We were seated and handed a menu, which is small but interesting. I ordered the Spicy Shoyu Ramen.  As we were placing the drink orders we ordered 3 waters and a hot saki. This must have been inconvenient for the waitress as we only received two waters and asked 3 times for the third water. We get our food and don't see our waitress again until it comes time for the check. The ramen itself was decent, the only thing enjoyable was the spice and hard boiled egg. Other than that, the broth was a little salty.  My waters needed to be filled, nobody asked us how the food was/if we liked it/if we needed more. By the time we were seated the business died down so I'm not to sure where our waitress went or what she was doing while we ate for 45 minutes.  I'm not sure what was going on with the staff.",

I've had plenty of ramen after living in NYC and the Bay Area and this was not the best I've ever had, but tbh, maybe this is as good as it gets out here.   Got takeout from here and it was a zoo in here on a Thursday night -- glad we ordered over the phone in advance (but I could barely hear a thing during the call, not surprising though).   The menu is sort of confusing and redundant --  We got the chashu ramen, spicy ramen, and the miso ramen (everything between 7.50 to 9.25, which is pretty reasonable for a decent quality ramen), but each one has the choice of miso, shoyu or shio soup. I don't know why there's a different choice of soup for the miso ramen or why I was even being asked to pick a soup (what else would it be?), but in any case, I just picked miso soup for all of them.   Pros:  Chashu was indeed good and melt-in-mouth tender Price point Soup had good rich flavor  Cons:  Servings aren't the largest but I guess that's reflective of the price.  Pretty salty and greasy (while that's expected with a ramen soup, more than so than most)  Overall, fairly good ramen and glad to have this option on our trip to Vegas for family.",

My buddy told me to and an extra egg or two to balance out the carbs. He's a healthy guy and skinny. I did it. I enjoyed them a lot. If you like spicy, get the spicy meat or the extra spicy meat.

I lived in Vegas for two years and my husband introduced me ramen because he lived in Japan. The thing is, Ramen Sora ruined me. I've been to a lot of ramen places all over the US since and this is by far the best!  We always get a pitcher of Kirin beer (It's only $11.50, gotta love that) and the spicy ramen with the miso sauce. The noodles are the perfect consistency for this warm soupy dish, the pork is high quality and melts like butter in your mouth, the spicy flavors make you crave more! After 3 years away from Vegas we drove into town last night and came straight here! Enjoy it while you can! And don't be scared off by a little line. It goes fast and again, this place is well worth a 15 minute wait!!",

No wonder this place is always busy regardless of the time of day.   I've tried their spicy miso ramen and recently had their spicy ramen with the shio broth. The shio broth was amazing, very clean and simple yet really flavorful, and it really brought out the spiciness. I don't remember enjoying a bowl of ramen as much as I did this time. I also didn't expect it to be that spicy, but I actually broke a sweat. And from what I remember the spicy miso wasn't that spicy, maybe because the heaviness of the miso broth absorbs the spiciness idk. I'm gonna have to try the Screaming Vengeance, one of these days...  The fried rice and gyoza are pretty good as well, and service has always been on point. This will definitely be my go to spot for ramen.",

    "text": "My cousin recommended this place for some good ramen and while in Vegas we couldn't resist and try this place out before heading back home to CA. This place is located in Chinatown and not far from the strip. Place is small and if you arrive during busy traffic around lunch time or dinner time, expect to be on the waitlist.  Luckily the place wasn't too busy and waited a quick 10 minutes, only because we wanted our town table, versus sitting on a long table with others.  Their menu is short and sweet, and exactly perfect if you know exactly what you want. You chose base soup you want and then the type of bowl you want. The bowls vary in what kind of ingredients in there, some with more chashu, no egg,  with egg, etc, they even have a vegetarian bowl. I went with the Spicy Ramen and my boyfriend got the Deluxe Sora Ramen both with the Miso base, and also the Large Chashu Rice Bowl.   Food came pretty quick and by the time we were finished, we were both stuffed. I really enjoyed my Spicy Ramen. It wasn't too spicy at all, just perfect. The Deluxe Sora was also really good. They have generous amount of the chashu. The rice bowl was ok, but we did finish it all.   I'd definitely come here again when in Vegas and looking for a meal to warm me up and highly recommend this place for ramen fans visiting the area.",

There's about 4 or 5 different Ramen you can order with larger size or additional toppings. I got the miso Ramen but it had spicy kick to it so I traded with my family member. So I ended up with shoyu base Ramen. Yes, any little spicy kick won't work for me. Nevertheless, I enjoyed their curly ramen noodles. It's rare Ramen places serve curly noodles like the instant ramen texture. The soup was just right not too salty or bland. Shoyu Ramen was perfect for me. We also ordered chashu curry and gyoza.  The 3 lady servers ran this busy place really well. None of them seem stressed or overwhelmed even though people were waiting for tables. I didn't have to flag them down at all. They came around to make sure we were all taken care of. I would definitely come here again.",

The noodles were also very fresh and tasty. The regular size was just right for me and only around $8.50-9.  This definitely has to be one of the top 5 ramen places in Vegas.

    "text": "Currently as the Duke (as of 2/8/2012 7:37PM) of this fine establishment, I would like to welcome Ramen Sora to my wallet.  The Short: Get the Miso ramen, upgrade it to a large, order a Sapporo (when they have their license), and go into a food coma.  The Food:  Shio: Reminds me of Chinese noodle broths, slightly clear and savory, includes 2 pieces of pork with strong flavor (soy?), seaweed, half an egg, and some fermented bamboo shoots. Everything seems to go well with each other and came out at the perfect temperature somewhere between hot and really warm. The saltiness of the broth was not overwhelming or made from someone with a salty palette. I think even my parents who dislike every other non-Chinese broth will probably enjoy this.   Miso: The toppings are the same as Shio and I feel like this broth is the winner and the prize here. Supposedly  their style of made for the colder weathers, therefore it is rich, thick, bursting with umami or savoriness. I fully agree, except that I'll most likely be here during the summer's triple digit weather devouring a bowl of the Miso ramen. What I enjoy most is that black pig fat floating on top adding to the deliciousness. A Spicy Miso is also available with the spice equivalence to a big red pepper.   Of course additional toppings can be added such as more bamboo shoots, onions, pork, egg, and noodles. Noodle upgrades however don't come in a separate bowl (kaedama) for you to add later like Monta.   Curry Bowl: Unfortunately only comes in a mini size, but anyways it is a thick brown curry with carrots, chashu, and pickled red ginger (mhmm). A great snack if you're really hungry and waiting for your ramen, or.. if you're not that hungry, but don't want to feel weird with your dining companions.   Fried Rice: If you're considering this, I would say stick with the ramen. There are two options for the fried rice, one with the house gravy sauce and one without it. I think this is the one item that is a bit overpriced, and towards the end was somewhat greasy. The house gravy (looked like egg drop soup) came in a bowl which you're suppose to add to your fried rice, wasn't my thing though.   Drinks are pretty standard can tea, soda, Ramune, water, and Sapporo in the future when the elusive alcohol license comes in. Perhaps the wizards in the kitchen can create a \"real\" Sapparo beer ramen when that comes haha.   The Service:  I can't bag on them too much for service since it has been mostly good, and they are not even a week old yet. For what it is worth I did experience a bit of a hiccup from the manager whom forgot to process our order and quirky service, but it may have to do with them running out of broth by 2PM causing her to accumulate stress whenever she had to turn away customers. I'm sure once they get things sorted out everything will be dandy.   The Location:   Ramen Sora is located \"behind\" Sura Korean BBQ (hard to miss, but if you're coming from the strip its going to be the building right after Macy's Home Furniture). Parking is entrance specific, but quite adequate for the amount of seats they have available (more than Monta if you're wondering). Air conditioning seems to be working strongly too.   Lastly if it matters for whatever reason I have always seen \"nationals\" in here, so I assume it must have their approval in authenticity.",

Ever since then, never really wanted to go to any Ramen place in Las Vegas. Glad that I gave Ramen Sora a chance!  It's really more a 3.5 Star but I rounded it up because the wait time is not as crazy as Monta :) I got the Spicy Miso and it was good but not really \"spicy\" lol.  I think I'll have to try the \"screaming for vengeance\" next time just to see. Not sure if it is just this time, but the eggs were a tad over-cooked instead of the soft boiled egg I'm used to for Ramen.",

It's a decent size ramen house, however it gets busy really fast which makes the wait time ridiculous. I ordered the miso ramen with extra egg and nori and I thought it was delicious. They are very generous with that nori. I do like the size of the place better rather than being squished next to people at Monta. They are a little more expensive but if you think about it, at Monta all of the extras add up to the equivalent or even more than the price of these pre-set ramen choices.",

    "text": "Eh, maybe I'm a tough critic but this place met my standards for a DECENT Ramen joint. I've eaten a lot of Ramen from Las Vegas to So-cal and Nor-cal. I've even attempted Man vs Food's challenge at Orochan Ramen (Little Tokyo's) Spiciest & biggest Ramen bowl. So I know my Ramen, and this place was A-OK but I've tried better.   Ramen Noodle:4/5 I liked the noodles, it was a bit thicker and chewier than most Ramen joints I've tried but I didn't like how chewy it was. Thicker was a plus but chewy no.   Broth Spicy Miso: 3/5 I ordered the SPICY MISO RAMEN which was actually not spicy at all. Even though the soup turned red after mixing it a bit, but don't let looks fool you. The broth was a bit greasy you could see the oil bubbles this was definitely a turn off. The broth was very light, I felt like the broth was missing something.   Broth Chashu Miso: 2/5 The broth was very light and oily. Once again I felt like it was missing something, NOT ENOUGH FLAVOR. I barely tasted the Miso and everyone knows Miso is salty which made the soup not as salty as most soups I've tried.  Chashu: 2/5 The Chashu pork, if you know what Chashu pork is its really Pork belly. That's simmered for about an hour slow cooking so its soft tasty and chewy. The pork belly they used was more pork less fat which was okay but everyone knows the flavor is in the fat. The Chashu pork was a bit chewier than most I've tried but also remember it was more meat than fat. My order came with one slice so I ordered extra Chashu because I love chashu pork, but I'm not a fan of theirs.   Tamago (egg) : 0/5 REMEMBER! The order does not come with a Tamago, even if on the menu there's a picture of one. I guess I assumed on the menu the picture was exactly what I was ordering. I usually like 2 tamago's so I ordered 1 extra. Not knowing I was ordering just HALF of an egg. So When I got my miso ramen I was sad to see I only had 1 half of a tamago. THE TAMAGO was TASTELESS! No flavor at all. A real tamago is kepted over night in a soy sauce based sweet sauce. But this was NOT A TAMAGO. The Tamago WASN'T EVEN BROWN! The Tamago is my favorite part of my ramen and they totally ruined it.  Alcohol: 0/5 Currently they don't have their liquor license which makes it such a tease on the menu because who doesn't love to enjoy a Sapporo beer with their Ramen. Instead I was forced to enjoy my Ramen with a glass of water imprinted with the Sapporo sticker (even more of a tease)  Service: 2/5 The waitress and the waiter were super nice but not so much the manager. My boyfriend eats a lot, so he ordered a large which was suppose to have more noodles and more soup but it wasn't enough for him. So we asked and offered to pay for more noodles since he still had a lot of soup left but they said no we would have to buy a whole new bowl which was a big disappointment because at MONTA my boyfriend always orders more noodles with no problem    Parking: 5/5 The place was dead, when I pulled in there had to be 2 other cars there. They have a small back parking lot which is a plus.   Wait: 5/5 THERE IS NO WAIT! Which was awesome because I was hungry when I got there. I was seated quickly",

I have enough of it..! That we wanted just to leave the place..and before i left the restaurant,i spoke to this Lady and ask her whats her name.,and she reply why.!?? I told her she have a bad attitude and bad service.!! I wanted to talk to managment before i leave.. and Ms, Sunny, i guess the manager or owner, and she nicely apologize with me for what happen and to her server staff attitude..! Over all, i would not ever, ever step on this place ever again..nor recommend this place..Even if you have the most delish ramen on planet.! If you have bad service and dont know how to take care of your guess.. u be in the list on most worst restaurant in vegas.!!

I got the spicy meat on the side per server recommendation and glad I did. Wasn't even halfway through before my nose got stuffy and my eyes started watering from how spicy this bowl of ramen was. Took breaks from the inferno that was my broth to devour the perfectly cooked pork and egg. My face is still tingly as I'm on my way home and I can gladly say my ramen/ spicy craving has been fulfilled. Will definitely be back to experience this strange yet delightful ramen induced pain again.",

    "text": "Get ready for some vengeance!   I like going outside of the Vegas strip and tourist attractions to see what amazing food adventures we can stumble upon. Well, with the help of Yelp, I searched for ramen and bam! This was on the top of the list! It must be really good, oh wait, it goes by distance...oh well. Anyway, from the reviews I read, it is a really great place that many locals seem to go to. Great, I thought, that means we can get great quality ramen minus the high Vegas pricing! This place is in the heart of Chinatown. The reviews are right! Thank you locals for helping me add this into my food adventure! Plus, anything within range of a university means 1.) cheap food and 2.) amazingly delicious food! Score!  The place is small and can probably fit about 30 people. The wait can be long, but we got there relatively early and were seated within 10 minutes. It is a very cozy setting and the staff is very friendly. They gave great recommendations. The menu was easy to follow and had really good pictures and descriptions of the food items. I like 2 sided menus because that means that there popular items are all that matters and everything flows well and that the restaurant focuses on it's specialties. I got the spicy miso ramen which was filling and provided great warmth considering it was freezing outside! My cousin got the Super Vengeance, which is supposed to be a very spicy miso ramen. She tells me it's not that spicy, but she has a pretty high tolerance for spicy food! I loved the green tea that they served because it was hot and crisp and felt very clean. The soups were very delicious and not as salty as some other ramen places I know. Glad we found this place to fill our bellies but to also keep us warm.   It was great meeting the locals as well for they gave more recommendations as to where to find good eats (bookmarked!). I felt like Andrew Zimmerman on the travel channel...SO dreams do come True?!?",

    "text": "This place left me SPEECHLESS. I am a huge Ramen fan, and this hands down one of the best places I've ever tried. I do not know if this place can be found in Southern California, but when I went to Vegas for the first time last week, I was blessed by this place. I recommend those who go to Vegas for fun to stop here. The ramen fixed my hangover!!   Parking: A small parking lot, but we were lucky to find a spot right away! Not sure how it is usually since it was my first time here.   Appearance: When my friends and I first drove up to the place, my initial reaction was: the outside looks like a shack. I had high expectations of this place because my friends kept saying this ramen place was really good. I took a deep breath and walked inside....and it was pretty cool. The feel felt...welcoming? <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FIt.is&s=72f46e083da47d684afdad64f330658892b2c3e43c9953f9a2bc31d2a162a125\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">It.is</a> a very small ramen shop, but it didn't really bother me. People aren't elbow to elbow or anything and the place was perfectly clean, roomy (for a small space), and air conditioned. The wait can get long since it's so small; our wait was about 15 minutes.   Food: I knew I wanted to order their corn butter ramen. I've never heard of putting butter before, although I have heard of cheese! The waitress recommended the miso broth so I got the regular miso broth corn butter ramen, and omg....the everything just melts in your mouth. The butter made it rich and creamy and since miso is also creamy, it was just a melting heaven in your mouth. Even the chashu melted in your mouth because it was on the fattier side. I can't even describe how good it was, but as I am writing this, I am drooling. My friend had the same thing, but she got the shoyu broth instead, and she said it was a bit bland.  My recommendation is to use HALF of your butter since they give you a hearty amount. Or you can take out the butter and add it little by little on how creamy you want it. I was sorta watching my intake of butter, so I decided with half. I would also get the miso broth since it is more creamier, which was a golden combo with the corn butter ramen.  If it's your first time, I  would also get add-ons on the side since adding anything to the original will change the entire flavor, and you should definitely try the original flavor first; it is to die for!  Service: I just noticed that the waitress never forgot to give us water. She was also nice and clear at explaining the broths to us. Nothing to complain about.  Overall, amazing. I want to come here again if I lived closer",

    "text": "First things first: I feel like I must weigh in on the age old (okay 6 month old) debate of Monta or Sora?   I.... I....  I'm giving it a tie.   Boooooooooooo!  Yeah, I can't call it.  Decided to finally visit Sora this past Friday and had been extremely intrigued by all the yelpers who prefer Sora over Monta and vice versa.  I actually convinced myself that Sora probably had better Ramen because even though I love Monta's version, I've sort of gotten bored of it and find myself ordering the Pork Belly Bowl more often.     Decided to go with the Spicy Miso bowl and was also fortunate enough to be able to try the Shoyu Ramen as well.  I really liked the noodles at Sora, moreso than Monta as I felt they were more al dente than what I've had at Monta which is what I prefer.  The pork and egg gave me the same pleasurable dining experience that I get from Monta.   As for the broth, in the beginning I actually thought it was a little bland, even after I tried to mix it all up.   With each bite, it became better and better and by the end of my bowl, I felt it had a lot of depth.   The next time I go I actually think I'm going to hold off a few minutes before digging right in as difficult as that will be to do.   The longer those ingredients, and in particular the spicy ground pork, stew in the broth, the better.  I think overall I found it to be as enjoyable as my favorite broth at Monta, the tonkatsu.  I also tried some of the Shoyu broth and actually wasn't impressed with it.   I thought it tasted fairly thin and not nearly as flavorful as Monta's version. I do need to explore their side offerings some more before trying to break this tie, but for now it is what it is.   To the owners of Monta and Sora: I accept bribes (to the Yelp Elite Council:  just kidding)",

It's difficult to avoid comparing this place to Monta but Ramen Sora stole first place as my favorite ramen joint. Ramen Sora is bigger than Monta which means more seating and less wait times. We went on a Saturday evening around 6 and barely beat the rush.   The menu is pretty basic - when it comes to ramen they had items I've never heard of like Corn Butter Ramen so I was too scared to try it. I ordered the Shoyu Ramen and upgraded to a large for $1 more. My husband got the regular sized Miso Ramen. (Tip: You will definitely want to upgrade to a large!)  My husband and I argued over whose broth was better. I loved my Shoyu and he loved the Miso. I can't pretend to be a ramen connoisseur but I know the broth wasn't too salty and was full of flavor. The ramen was perfectly cooked. I enjoyed all the accompaniments like bamboo shoots, seaweed and especially the egg.  Service was good and friendly. After the dinner rush though, we had to flag someone to get our bill. I saw a \"now hiring\" sign so its good to know they're going to resolve that issue. This place is only going to get even busier now that its sweater weather!",

I am from LA and I have been to a few ramen places in little tokyo and in westwood and this place cannot even be mentioned in the same sentence as them. I am not sure if vegas lacks good ramen places but to rate this place so highly is confusing and disappointing. Santouka ramen, jinya ramen, daikokuya, tsujita and many other ramen restaurants make sora ramen unnecessary and a con operation for people who have never tried really good ramen. Worst than the food, however, was the attitude of the server who I later found out was the manager. I accidently wrote our name on the second page of the waitlist because i did not see the two columns of spaces to write down names on the first page. That was my mistake but still i notified them of my mistake and that it was my turn to be sitted. The manager, her name is Shinaya or something like that, hestitantly took me to be sitted at the bar but I wanted to sit at a table. Then the manager rolled her eyes and gave me attitude for wanting to sit there. Upon talking with the manager because my appetite had been ruined by the managers rude behavior she tried to justify her actions by telling me she let me sit there instead of another couple of customers who came after me. The manager said this couple are regulars and that they didnt want to sit at the bar either. Even when I told her that i came before her she still insisted that she did me a service by giving me the table instead of them. BTW there were other tables available it was not too busy at the time. The manager did not apologize until I reminded her she didn't even apologize for ruining my experience there; she just kept trying to justify her rude behaviour. She refused to give me the name of her superior and would not give me the name of anyone else who I could speak with regarding her terrible attitude to a customer. So for whoever decides to go here for a less than mediocre bowl of ramen just know the manager, SHINAYA, is unprofessional and dont expect too much from this place.",

One thing I have noticed is it seems to me they have changed the recipe, the meat I remember used to be thin sliced and fatty and Lott's of noodle in regular size bowl. Now they have thick meat that is kind of dry to me I wish they would bring back how I remember it. The dinning room is small and this place is always busy they should make the cashier area into a ramen bar in my opinion so people can sit around the ramen bar and eat when it gets super busy. The last visit I took my two brothers one orders a large and the other a regular I got a regular size bowl too. Seems like if your wanting more noodles large is the way to go. I finished my bowl before them and they couldn't finish there's so I poured both of there's in mine and eat all of it because I am Naruto and I love ramen and the broth here is still really good. I doubt my review will change there recipe back and the next time I go I see that fatty thin slice meat I remember and love, chances are I will be returning and who knows maybe I will be surprised and will have my favorite ramen shop in Vegas back if this happens I will be updating my review for sure. Good day and if you eat here hope you enjoy.",

    "text": "I decided to stop by here after a friend of mine said that someone from Ichiza said this place was better than... well, better than the ramen house that seems to have started a new ramen trend in this town.  As the long time (until recently) duke, they've set a gold standard for me, and so for the purposes of this review, I will be calling them \"the other ramen place\".  You all know what I'm talking about anyway.  This review is a comparison review.  Sorry, but it's the only way I know to review a ramen joint at this time, and Ramen Sora holds it's own!  The building is a lot more spacious than the other ramen place.  It's more comfortable.    There's also not a 15 minute wait.  In this case, that's a good thing.  Like the other ramen place, service is fast, friendly, and professional.  I ordered the spicy miso with extra chashu.  The broth was very flavorful!  Much more savory than the other ramen place.  A lot less salty.  The spiciness had only a little kick (I eat a lot of very hot Thai food though), but it was enough to give a well rounded flavor to this thick, tasty broth.  If you have a problem with the salt levels of the other ramen place, this might be your go to restaurant.  The noodles were better, I thought.  They were thicker, and \"meatier\".  Very well prepared.  The chashu was tender as if it had been soaking in broth all day.  It fell apart in my chopsticks.  Yum.  The chashu slices were a little thicker than the other ramen place, although perhaps not quite as tender.    I may dare to say that the overall quality of the ingredients is a little higher here than the other ramen place.  It definitely has a more bold flavor profile, at least in the miso.  I love both places, really, which should say a lot about Ramen Sora.  The bottom line here is that Ramen Sora has added a new flavor to this town, and it is worth while to check out.  It may not become your favorite ramen house in town, but I think it is definitely a great addition.  Thank you, Ramen Sora!",

    "text": "This place is officially my favorite ramen spot. PERIOD. For a multitude of reasons...  1) Most importantly, I like my food spicy. I don't mean \"spicy-tuna-roll-spicy\"... I'm talkin' fiery hot, but the flavor has to be there too. It can't taste like those atomic hot wings tossed in chemical-like hot sauces. Ohhh ramen sora, thank you for having the PERFECT idea of spicy :). The killer spicy ramen is my dream come True broth.   2) I enjoy variety. The mini chasu curry bowl and an order of gyoza are perfect side dishes to ramen. They also provide a great list of toppings for ramen (extra chasu, corn, etc).   3) Ramen is NOT supposed to be expensive! Honestly, it can be just a tad cheaper but compared to most spots in Vegas, this place is the most reasonable. :)  4) Friendly workers. The service is always fantastic. I never see the bottom of my water, and trust me this is very important when you're enjoying a super-sized killer spicy ramen. Most Asian restaurants tend to neglect glasses of water and we are forced to wave down a waiter for a refill. Not Ramen Sora, they're on top of their game!   5) Space. I didn't really want to compare Ramen Sora to Monta too much, but man, Monta really does need to expand for customer convenience. You won't have as much problem getting a table/seats at Ramen Sora.   6) THE RAMEN HERE IS JUST PLAIN FANTASTIC. Great broth, amazing noodles cooked to perfection (not too soggy and just a tad thicker than Monta's), and several options for the broth: shio, shoyu, miso. Flavor reminds me of my favorite ramen spots in NYC, which says a lot.   In conclusion, THANK YOU Ramen Sora for being present in Vegas, and so conveniently located as well ;) I only wish you'd offer delivery...",

This place is definitely happening as it is almost always packed and it didn't help much that about a dozen of us wanted to sit together last time we came here, but they were very accommodating including separating checks for us which is almost always frowned upon everywhere else.

I decided to go with the Shio ramen and I had asked for the Shio sauce so that I could flavor it more knowing that it wasn't as flavorful as the Miso. My husband ordered the miso ramen.  I took one sip of  the broth and it tasted like water....so I tried to add more of the potent Shio concentrate (basically salt water in a bottle) but after a couple of squirts my broth and ramen still tasted flavorless. I was so bummed out and disappointed. I ended up trying the Miso ramen and I wanted to tell all of the people there not eating yet to order the Miso which was SOOOOO much more flavorful than the Shio....like 100 times way better. I tried adding miso broth to my shio broth, but it just didn't make it taste any better. Their pork is good, but you only get one slice unless you order the extra pork which is like $3.00?  Overall, this place is nicely decorated and service wasn't bad, but I was just not a big fan of the Shio Ramen. Miso ramen is definitely a must have when coming here.",

This place is a small Restaraunt (like seats less than 20 people small) but is worth the wait! You are immediately greeted and seated with smiles, and the staff is more than happy to assist with answering questions about their specific brand of ramen.  I suggest the corn butter ramen with miso base, as this provides a pop of flavor, and the butter gives the broth a silky flavor and texture that I have yet to see matched in the ramen community. They also have options for spicy meat (or the more sinisterly named \"killer spicy\" meat for those who dare) if you want an extra punch of flavor. I also appreciate the firm, not soggy, noodles that are curly - not straight.  Stop in on a weekday before noon for faster seating, and faster eating!",

So on our one Chinatown afternoon visit in Vegas, I was outvoted from my choice of Trattoria Nakamura-Ya (well, a good excuse to go back one day soon). But I found it better than expected. The pork and broth were quite tasty and the noodles themselves had a nice texture. My wife and son both said it was good, and would happily go back (whereas for me, there's too many places I'd want to try first).

Maybe I should've gone with miso broth. In any case, it was a bit bland, other than the strange animal taste, though I'm thankful I didn't try any of the spicy flavors as my SO's spicy ramen was too much for me! I had the mango ice cream blobs afterward, and they were awesome! I'd never experienced ice cream in that format before, where it's encased in some sort of doughy pod... Good stuff.",

Kind of hard to ask for utensils, napkins, straws, etc. They also had to wash more chopsticks before they could give us some. We all ordered ramen since that's what we came for, but we also wanted to order their fried rice. We were told that it would take 20-40 minutes to make since they ran out of it and will have to make another batch. We finished eating our ramen, and the fried rice finally came after. Service is a bit slow since they're busy, but not a bad place for ramen in Las Vegas. Food was decent, pricing is reasonable.. Slow service is my only complaint.",

I will definitely be back here to try more of their ramen.",

    "text": "For my own Battle Ramen, Sora was my last stop. My fiance, Ruben had already visited Sora several times and raved about the Killer Spicy Miso Ramen. That sounded scary and knowing his tolerance for heat, I wasn't going to go near it. Anyway, even after taking him to Monta, he still liked Sora better, so I had to see for myself.  We visited one afternoon with his co-worker, waiting eagerly for them to open. Then, we were seated immediately. Both of them knew exactly what they wanted - Killer ramen bowls with the option for more noodles and broth. I went for a Miso Ramen. I really liked the flavor and everything about my ramen was delicious. Oh, and of course I had to try the Killer broth. It has that really deep chili flavor that lingers in the back of your throat. But wow, it was so, so tasty! I actually added a few spoonfuls of the Killer broth into my ramen! It was great.  At the end of the meal, my only problem was that I couldn't decide which ramen house I preferred (between Monta and Sora; I eliminated Fukumimi). They have different styles and I enjoyed both of them. What it came down to for me was the noodles (I prefer Monta's thick, wavy noodles), preference of Tonkotsu over Miso broth, and the availability of chili oil to control the spice level. So my favorite ramen offerings are Monta, however, I like Sora's miso broth better!",

The last place I had been for True Japanese Ramen was Ippudo in NY so this had a lot to live up to!    They have a few other things on the menu but come here for the Ramen.  It is a noodle soup dish with added ingredients of pork, seaweed, corn, eggs or greens.  Really your choice.  I opted for the Deluxe with everything in it and was not disappointed.  The key to any ramen restaurant is the soup.  I have read some of the other reviews that felt the broth was hit or miss but on the night we were there it was spot on!  You want to save the broth it is so good and you will find yourself licking the bowl after you drink from it!    Compared the restaurants on the strip this place is dirt cheap!  Great food at a great price... very refreshing in Vegas.  This restaurant is located in the China Town.  Really not that far the north end of the strip.  It is located on Spring Mountain Road which is just West of the strip from the Fashion Mall.    Take a cab, or rent a car.  Heck walk it!  Just try it you'll like it!",

    "text": "Whenever someone ask me \"What's a good ramen place?\" I recommend Sora ramen. I can't believe I haven't wrote a review since I come here all the time ever since they opened. Yes, I understand ramen is not the healthiest but I'm sure we all have that sudden ramen craving :)  Service I have never, NEVER received a bad service here. They always welcome customers with \"Irassyaimase!\" and a big smile. Wait time can be long at times, especially during the winter but once you are seated, servers are attentive and fast. I'm always amazed at how fast my food arrives. Never waited longer than 10 minutes which is a huge plus (considering I waited over 30 minutes for my ramen at Misoya and Jinya).  Food I have tried both shio and miso ramen and personally like miso ramen better. You get a few slices of chasyu that melts in your mouth along with ramen noodle and egg cooked to perfection. I like how the broth is not too salty like how other places can be sometimes.   For the appetizer, I have tried their mini chasyu bowl which is amazing. It's a perfect size if you are not that hungry. It's almost like a snack since it's not really a meal. I have also tried their gyoza. I'm very picky with my gyoza since my mom cooks amazing gyoza. Sora's gyoza wouldn't beat my mom's, but it is good compare to many other places I tried.   At the price range of $8-$10, the quality of food you get here is awesome. From my experience, people in Vegas either like Sora or Monta for ramen. I have tried both places but I personally think Sora is better.",

    "text": "All the other reviews nailed parking etc so I'll agree it's a lil bit sketch, as me and my boyfriend were pulling in and straight saw someone back into another car in the lot and just drive away as if she wasn't responsible. Fortunately and unbeknownst to her as she didn't care to check, the bumper only got a slight scratch. But still.  Anyway...check yo car on the way out. Service was friendly and fast as we were meeting people already there and who go there regularly. I asked for no meat in my Ramen but did get gyoza which was good and reminded me of my best friends' who is half Japanese. My man loved his..I can't even tell you what we got, something w seaweed obvi, but pix(sorry). Four stars because when we first got in the music was loud but talkable, barely. Then it got so loud as we ate I wanted to look around for the DJ and flashing lights because dang! I could barely hear my man next to me. And I asked for hot tea but received pre-kettled and poured hot water lightly scented w tea. And while every one else really loved this food...I did not like this. Neither  the noodles(texture) nor broth(salt seemed the main flavor), or the fact that the bamboo shoots were so over cooked they were barely recognizable as bamboo shoots (a grayish brown string)and were cut long and thin like fries. Good thing I didn't order extra bamboo shoots. The egg also ends up gray for the white part..even though the broth isn't gray?  Again...I didn't like it but enough people do so that my review won't hurt them. I just don't get how people think overcooked bamboo shoots are good?",

It has the spiciest ramen in town hands down ( if that is your thing) and all three broths-- miso, shoyu, and shio-- are made hot and very tasty. They don't have as many add ons to your ramen dishes as other places, but with all the essentials you can order yourself a perfect bowl of ramen.    My personal favorite is the large miso deluxe (which comes with everything!) The drinks and sides are all very reasonably priced, and if you want to try the gyozas here you will not regret it!    I have been here many times, and every time has been a great experience, whether it is to take out or dine in :)",

Since then I had tried 2 others in Vegas and have decided to return here to dine again with my new Yelp buddy! She's just as exited and happy to dine here as I am!  Ramen Sora's location on Spring Mountain Road is convenient and easy to find.  The free parking is close, safe, and clean. The ambiance is still authentic, comfortable,  and fun!  The food remains yummy,  memorable and beautiful. ..just like a first crush!  During my last visit,  I had the Nori Ramen and the 5 piece side order of gyoza for $3.75 - yum!  This time, I ate the Butter Corn Ramen.  Both times,  I enjoyed the cha siu that just dissolved in the mouth with an edge of salty spice and melty, soft fat in between the tender meat! The noodles were firm and slurp worthy.  The broth was tasty with a just right goodness!  Re: the Butter Corn Ramen this visit... I really like corn: corn flakes,  corn chips, popcorn,  etc., so BUTTERED corn for me is a double treat! Yummy!  The half of a hard boiled egg was like a cherry on top of an ice cream sundae! Mmm!  Maybe I'm a bit of a romantic because I can remember my first crush.  It was 4th grade. ..a time when life was simple. ..like corn, butter,  and noodles! The basic food groups!",

I like how it's in it's own separate vicinity, which means they have their own parking lot, which also means no angry Asian lady ripping her hair apart trying to get a damn parking spot. I also like their miso broth, jam-packed with umami, and from what I know, most akin to my taste-buds.   Usually, my visits end with a good feeling in my mind, heart, and tummy, but I couldn't quite stomach that same feeling during my last two experiences.   Perhaps it was because I decided to try new bowls apart from my usual corn and butter bowl, but I ordered the deluxe bowl from one visit and the chashu bowl on another visit.   On my first visit, the service was just lacking greatly. Water wasn't served until 15 minutes into our seating and I doubt the waitress heard my order correctly because when I asked her why there wasn't butter on my ramen, she had a look as if she didn't know there was even supposed to be butter in the first place.   On my second visit, when I ordered the chashu ramen bowl, everything tasted great except for the star of the bowl itself! Usually Ramen Sora's chashu is almost creamy, if I say so myself. Like other reviewers quote, a \"perfect ration between meat and fat.\" It's almost like it melts in your mouth. Two out of the three pieces in my bowl were just the opposite of tender, and left me giving them to my partner since he'll eat anything. Ruined my appetite.  Despite these two recent experiences, I still have to admit that Ramen Sora is good at what it's supposed to do, and that's to make a good bowl of ramen at a decent price and experience. I won't let these two blunders affect my rating as I know how good this shop can be when it really tries to, despite their obvious inconsistencies.   Next time, I'll just opt out of so much chashu, and stick to the same old one amazing piece that you get in every bowl.",

Finally spoke up louder and got said servers attention. Never got refills. etc etc. Ask for the bill and waved the server down to pay, and server never came back. Walked to the front and payed for the meal as doing so, I spoke to the person upfront and they seemed like they didn't care. Wont come back 0/5.",

    "text": "I'll readily admit, I'm a ramen noob.   I've been to one other ramen house, exactly one week ago.   Saturday night, after moving  friends all day in the heat, my fella and I decided that we wanted to give Ramen Sora a go.    We drove over, and there was a bit of a line, but the wait wasn't bad at all.   The restaurant is open, and spacious, but has an intimate feel.    The server was super nice, taking time to explain the differences between the broths to us.    We ended up ordering an appetizer \"sampler\" of the flavored egg, bamboo shoots, and seared pork belly.  We also ordered gyoza.   First of all, I have to toot my own horn: I successfully ate my egg with chopsticks.  On the first try.  :D    The egg was delicious:  with the yolk just a tiny bit under hard boiled.  (Solid, but not dry). I loved the bamboo shoots, but was nervous about the pork belly, and almost didn't try it.  I'm SO glad I did!  It was smokey, and tender, and juicy...really delicious.   Our ramen arrived next:  Mine was the shoyu (soy based) with corn.  Morgan had the shio (salt based)  They were phenomenal.  I loved mine so much, I actually drank all of the broth.    I loved the service, and how polite everyone was.    So...for the rest of the night and all day yesterday, Morgan was talking about Ramen Sora.  I started feeling really under the weather yesterday, and felt just as bad this morning...and the only thing that got me out of bed was a trip back to Ramen Sora with friends!  We got to try the miso broth this time, as a friend ordered it...it was awesome.  SO rich!!  Service was spectacular, and the food was just as delicious as it was Saturday night.    I definitelly have a new favorite place to eat!",

The only thing not cooked with pork was the fried rice. No beef or chicken, just pork. The broth is soaked in pork bones for one day. They have no vegetable or beef broth and you can see the grease in the broth, look at all of the posted pictures. The food smelled foul. I had a hard time getting anyone to really eat the noodles because of the smell, so we ordered more rice and began to fight over it. We brought most of the noodles home and threw them away the following day. My son eats almost anything and he would not touch the leftovers. If you are not a pork enthusiast, stay far away from this place. The service was mediocre. We sat at the table next to the bar and had a hard time getting water refills.The prices are more than reasonable. They only have about 10 tables or less in this place. And, it is very dark.",

But seeing as I'm a fan of cheap prices and bargains...  Sora's prices are a little more expensive (everything from the drinks to the ramen) than Monta's and you only get one slice of chashu pork in your soup.  (Even better, if you want really inexpensive and tasty ramen order a bowl ($5) from Big Wong)",

I like my ramen with some spice, so I noticed that they started to offer a spicy sauce upon request. So spicy ramen with chachu it was. It was good but in the end some thing was a bit lacking. The broth had flavor but not a rich taste and the spicy sauce was ok a bit weak in my opinion. Couple of days later, next stop Sora Ramen. Ordered the same, the difference is  noticeable the broth here has a deep rich pork flavor wether it is miso, shoyu or shiso. Even the flavor and look of the chachu has is better here. As for the spiciness? You can ask for a scoop of \"Killer Meat\", which is ground meat cooked in, from what I'm told, 15 different types chili for a long time.  This gives it a nice deep spicy flavor that gives a bold flavor but won't leave you crying . In my opinion Sora tops in all categories from basic to spicy. They offer a variety of add-ins such as corn, butter and extra meat. If you go, get there early as this place gets packed. Highly recommend.",

No problem we were seated quickly and our orders were taken with no problem. So the service there is cool nothing exceptional but cool. When the ramen came out I noticed my miso was a little dark and I couldn't figure it out at first the. I started eating... Yup shoyu in everything... It overpowered the miso and by the end I was getting disgusted... (I did get the large bowl, maybe if I got the smaller one if would have been ok) all in all it was bad, if they were in Arizona I would go back cuz Arizona has nothing good at all!  In California I wouldn't come back...  I guess if I come back and crave ramen in Vegas I would try to find Hakata style... Or some really good Tonkotsu! The place is about 2.75 in my book not quite a three... But once again I don't care for northern style",

The noodles are much thicker and chewier than Monta's and the miso was more complicated and heavily seasoned. The shio was clear and light.

    "text": "CONDENSED IN A SOUP CAN:       It boils down to personal preference. Sapporo peeps will love Ramen Sora for its chewy noodles and its seasoned miso broth.  And though this goes against the general tide, I'd have to say I am a Kyushu or Kurume sistah.     THE MEAT:      There are a couple of popular types of Japanese Ramen named after their region/city of origin, 2 of which are now big players in the Vegas scene - Kyushu, or more specifically Kurume ramen (served in Monta Ramen) and Sapporo (served in Ramen Sora).  There are differences in the preparation and quality of broth and noodles, but both places offer the same general toppings - thin slices of roasted pork, egg, green onion, corn and bamboo shoots or wood ear mushroom.      I can't give a review of Ramen Sora without comparing it to Monta Ramen, which was my first love.  The noodles are curly and chewier, and although I liked the soft thin strands of Monta, I enjoyed the bite of Sora very much.  The Sora miso broth is generously seasoned, and I believe the red specks are Togarashi, red pepper flakes that are available on your table - it has a very distinct flavor, somewhat smoky and a tad tangy.  The Sora broth was more complex, and maybe I'll like it more once I am accustomed to it.        For now, the foodie prude in me misses the conservative broth in Monta, rich in meat and egg flavors... and though the broth may get cloying, I love the no fuss straight up lard goodness. All in all, both ramens rock, and will cure any hangover and hit your spot.   I'M STILL DIGESTING...      How some folks expect a toddler to go out of their way instead of them accommodating a 2 year old.  Which do you think is the easier task?

The food was pretty good, but I could not get over the smell of the ramen bowl. I'm not sure what it was, but it smelled like spoiled something. I pushed through the smell and kept eating though because it was tasting very good. All in all, I would say my bowl was okay.  The one thing to note is that there is nothing for vegetarians here since all the broth is meat based. My SO had to get friend rice with veggies and it was not good at all.",

Our latest challenge was Ramen, and I'm happy to report that I won with the help of Ramen Sora. He said it couldn't be done. He said there is no better Ramen in Las Vegas than Monta Ramen. I proved him wrong.  This place is fantastic. There are no words to describe how perfect the ramen is, every time. The noodles are not too firm, not too soft. The broth is expertly prepared to just the right flavor. The meat is so tender, it falls apart with a gentle tug of your chopsticks. Who could ask for anything more?  The service here is also top notch. Your soup comes out fast and just how you order it, every time. The servers are friendly and happy to explain the different types of Ramen to you if you're a first timer. I told my server I like spicy, but don't like ground meat (which is what makes their spicy Ramen bowl spicy). My bowl came out with a side of chili sauce so I could flavor it to my liking.  The only downside is this place is so good, it can get crowded fast. But, it's worth the wait for the yummy yummy Ramen.",

While I haven't really tried the other broths, the miso one they have which I guess is as close to tonkotsu as it can be is 10/10.    My only suggestion would be to improve their eggs. While I had never had any problems before, the last time I was there, the egg was slightly overcooked.  If you are in a hurry, you can call ahead and order food for pick up.

The atmosphere is quieter than your average ramen house, which was refreshing. : ) They use plastic chopsticks here, so if you aren't a pro-chopstick guru, ask for a fork.

They also have the option of getting a larger size for only $1 more.   I like the broth here A LOT.  They have three different broth options: Miso, Shoyu, and Shio.   My favorite broth is the miso because it is savory and full of flavor. The noodles are really good and the soft boiled egg is my favorite!   The spicy ramen is alright, it tends to get extremely spicy after having eaten more of the broth.",

    "text": "Man, I wanted to be able to say this place doesn't deserve five stars. The waitress really pissed me off. So I'm going to vent about their bullshit and then tell you how they still got five stars.  So we showed up about thirty minutes before opening and there was still a line of about 6 parties ahead of us. Now We were a group of six and there was one big party ahead of us. The rest were broken up into smaller groups. It was a Saturday so one would figure they'd have enough staffing for the rush.  Fast forward to getting seated. The host had seated the large group in their one seating area. A portion of the restaurant was blocked off because apparently they couldn't handle it due to limitations on staff. Pairs were seated in areas that could have easily turned into 4, 6, and 8 tops but because of the odd distribution of parties, there were no tables to combine without moving folks. They split us into a party of four and two. We did say that was okay.  When we sat, asked the folks at the table next to us if it would be a big deal if we switched our two for the two of them. They were very quick to oblige. It wasn't that long after we sat down that this happened, we hadn't even ordered.  So we called the waitress over who proceeded to chew us out and say that it would be \"too complicated\" for the kitchen and that they wouldn't allow it.   Look, I get it. It doesn't make life easy when people like us do that. We could have just said we would wait longer for a large table (it would have been an additional 20-30 minutes based off of how long the big table moved out). What pissed me off was the rudeness and the fact that they could have avoided this situation with proper staffing. At a Japanese restaurant no less. I expect more from them.  I think I could just stop my review here. I mean, they pissed me off and I'm still giving FIVE stars. The ramen is that good. It's a hearty, rich tonkotsu broth. The noodles are a little thicker (not Hakata style) and have a nice chewiness to them. Great job on the eggs, the chashu is amazing. Gyoza and fried rice both complimented the ramen. Trust me, it's good.  Here's an insider tip though. As a man who loves miso ramen... order it with butter. It goes really well. But this is my trick. Instead of completely mixing it into the broth, I wrap the butter with the hot noodles. This allows you to have the broth plain to start and then you can pull from the noodles when you want the buttery flavor. As you get further in, it becomes richer.  It may sound crazy but believe me, it's flippin' delicious.  Cheers!",

Needless to say I downed this bowl quickly.  I may have even took a breathe in between bites but I am not sure. Service was fantastic and quick. I highly recommend this place for noodle enthusiasts.",

    "text": "Oh how my opinions have changed. Over the past 6 months or so, I'm finding myself craving Sora over Monta. I must have had a bad bowl the first time I dined here because every bowl after that has been ramen perfection.  As always, I continue to order only the miso ramen. Shoyu just doesn't do it for me. The miso broth here is rich and flavorful. And that creaminess that I used to get at Monta is no more and has found itself in my bowl of Sora Ramen noodles. The noodles here are special too as they are thicker and chewier than those skinny, limp noodles elsewhere. If you generally prefer an al dente noodle, these will be right up your alley.  After living in Vegas my whole life, I've come to appreciate the fast life. And by fast life, I mean little to no wait-times. In the 24/7 city, things are done in the moment. And when you're stomach is about it eat itself after a long day of work, you want a quick bite to eat--not a 40-minute wait to eat 15 minutes worth of food. Sora has a relatively large, spacious dining room which allows them to serve more people in shorter time. Summation: Little to no wait times.  Location  |  Not that this should be a huge factor considering its only 1 block closer to the strip... But Sora is 1 block closer to the strip. If you're coming down Spring Mountain, a bowl of noodles at Sora is 2 minutes closer to you than Monta. Just saying.  Battle of the Ramen(s) has officially come to a close and I'm pleased to say Sora is #1.",

    "text": "Ramen Sora doesn't really need my review, but here it is:  It is honestly the best ramen in town.  Prices are good. Options/add-ons are good.  Now for the issues: WTH is up with the service here????? Sora has been uber popular for like 3 years (or more?). In fact, we showed up 5 minutes before opening on a Saturday and there was already a line! You would think they were super-practiced and efficient since it's basically ALWAYS like this. And when you see all the signs about ordering quickly and how to place your order, you really do think it'll be efficient. But it's not. Despite being there before it opened (and with plenty of open seating), we were not given a table for 10 minutes! Then our order wasn't taken for 10 minutes, then the ramen (very surprisingly) took 15 minutes to come out. We all got in the door at the same time (right when they opened), but somehow the table next to us was finished, bill paid, out the door before we even got our food. It took over an hour for us to eat ramen, when we're usually out the door in under 30 minutes. For that reason, I probably will never drive across town to eat here again.",

    "text": "Ok, so I know my first review was harsh...but I was mad at the time.  Maybe I should remove it...but maybe not. Anyways...  Finally got around to giving Sora another try!  We had a much smaller party, and came during the day, so getting an immediate table was easy.  (This was my issue last time around).  Started off with some pork on rice :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramen-sora-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#VkgcZaYqSkhBws2i-R_dnA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/rame...</a>  And then ordered their Deluxe Sora Ramen at a $10 price tag...it was a little spendy, but there was a large portion sitting in front of me, and lots of pork and goodies inside.  It was very good...noodles a little thicker and broth a little saltier, but good nonetheless.  Probably my second favorite in town so far :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramen-sora-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#7kcOrxTs-DRWz0CllfQHDw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/rame...</a>  Also ordered the EXTRA spicy ramen....and it was HOT!  They don't hold back...it was delicious, but it was spicy!  It is really hard to compare ramen vs ramen since they have different ways of creating the magic inside your bowl, but since it is essentially similar overall, this is my 2nd favorite of the \"big three\" in town.  I'll be back!  /Arnold Schwarzenegger",

    "text": "A rainy day must! 11:30am and already a line waiting outside. What is this recent ramen obsession of mine? I used to be content eating Cup O Noodles with a cracked egg...don't judge, we've all been slummin' at some point. A friend of mine recommended Sora and I'm glad to say I can still call her a friend. First off, I appreciate the quick service and slightly more ample seating. The servers were on their game and quickly delivered the goods with a smile and thorough explanation of the menu. I initially expected to pay a la cart for tamago, chashu and spicy meat like at the other places. But for $8.50 I can get a SPICY MISO RAMEN with all of the above...what a great deal! Of course you can get extra portions of these items for just a $1 or $2...again not a bad deal considering some other ramen houses charge much more. SPICY MISO RAMEN was perfect! I loved the spicy meat that should be a ramen staple...lean ground meat with a slight sweetness and once mixed into the rich, not too salty miso broth, completes the ramen experience. Chashu is a newly acquired taste for me as I wasn't a fan of fatty pork belly, but in a steamy bowl of ramen is now an unctuous treat I crave. Chashu, slow braised pork belly that takes hours to cook to achieve that tender, melt-in-your-mouth texture. The only thing I didn't like and will probably always have an aversion to is the fermented bamboo shoots..menma. I think it ruins my perfect bowl with its stinky presence...sort of like the uncle no one likes who keeps showing up at dinner. I must remember to omit it from now on. I enjoyed the simplicity of Sora's ramen that didn't try to pack in everything and give you ramen ADD with adding things like black garlic, chili threads (offenders know who they are). Ramen is a simple bowl of comfort food meant to satisfy and warm the soul. Sora achieves this and is what a good Obaasan (grandma) would approve.",

The meat wasn't that spicy but it had a good flavor. I also ordered steamed gyoza and a cold sake. No one had any food left in front of them and it was pretty quiet while everyone was eating. Another good sign of good food. I recommend Ramen Sora to those that love ramen.  Next time I'll try out Monta Ramen and compare.",

The \"spicy miso\" ramen gets it's spicy from the scoop of meat that is added to the bowl.  The texture reminds me of a sausage.  I had a few really hot bites and if I order it again, I might get it on the side to control the level of heat.  The sauce is mixed in with the meat so once you stir it or let it sit, it gets in the broth & you've committed to that level of heat.  Tasty but I had two moments where it got me good!",

The broth...hooomaigoshhh. They do miso justice here.  I always get the spicy miso and it's perfect. The right amount heat...dangerous, but enjoyable. *rawr* (last time I checked there is an exxxtra spicy version too, for those who can handle the heat!) The right amount of salt...this is super important because there is that fine line between bland and too salty.  Noodles are thick, wavy and al dente, never ever soggy! Last but not least, the Pi-chashu...I choose you!  *giggle* Ramen Sora makes the best chashu. I don't know how they do it, but no other place can compare. The slice of pork is meaty, lean with less fat, fall apart tender, and oh so tasty. *note: it only comes with one piece* I totally regret not ordering extra chashu.   It's officially fall in Las Vegas. I can wear boots and scarves without feeling silly. Naturally, I'll be drawn to eating more ramen this time of year.  There's just something about ramen that warms the soul. Looking to try the deluxe ramen next :)",

They would have two people bus the table when you only need one person to do the job. All the servers were running around and not getting a lot done. One of the server was blowing her nose by the chopsticks that were just washed, she threw the napkin in the trash, wiped her nose with her hand and then grabbed a handful of chopsticks, put them in the holder and put it on a table for guests to use! After we were seated a family of four sat next to us and the guy proceeded to blow his nose at the table, there is nothing worse than being in a crowded restaurant and people unload next to you.  The ramen was way too salty, bad quality ingredients,  the noodles were good, but not good enough to return.   The curry plate was very salty, lacked in flavor. The pork was over cooked and was not hot, it was bearly warm.  Hot tea was not hot at all. Gyoza was just ok.",

Bf is meh about thick noodles so for him this was probably just another good bowl of ramen  Broth - flavorful, just the right amount of froth and oil and flavor... and served extra hot! This is key people.... nothing spoils of a bowl of ramen for me like tepid/warm broth. I need my broth scalding hot  Pork - thick cut pork slices that melt in your mouth .... they only give a few slices but that was more than enough for me  ....and the icing on the cake?

At first, the look of the spicy ramen does not look appetizing. But once you taste it, you totally forget about that.    It's very meaty and you can fee the liquified fat in your mouth and boy does it taste good.  The egg could have used a little more marinating but it want bad.

It does have busy times with lots of costumer and there is limited parking space behind the store itself.  If you ever have a craving for good Ramen, one of my ramen shop recommendation in Las Vegas would be Sora Ramen~  I've been to Sora Ramen a couple of times and they haven't disappoint me in ramen quality.  Having actual, fresh handmade Ramen in my opinion is way better then instant ramen~ For me, once I had real Ramen, instant ramen wasn't the same.   They have other side dishes that you can have with your ramen.  My friend usually gets Curry with hers.  The first time I went there I got the Deluxe Sora Ramen.  It was delicious! I love the other ingredients they have in the ramen like bamboo, egg, meat, etc.    Now, I usually get the Nori Ramen Bowl.  After I ate Nori, Japanese word for Seaweed, with my ramen, I have to have it with my ramen.  The Nori Ramen has pieces of seaweed surrounding the bowl and the usually egg, bamboo, and chashu (kind of meat).  It is so delicious! For Sora Ramen, you can choose from having Miso, Shoyou, or Shio as your soup base.  Miso is soybean base I belive, Shoyou is soy sauce, while Shio is salt base broth.  I like to change it depending on what I feel like having.  It depends on your preference.",

    "text": "Ramen Sora is hands down the best ramen house in the Las Vegas valley. I've tried all the other ramen places, most of which are much pricier than Ramen Sora, and have not found a place that came close. I usually order the Miso Ramen or Deluxe SORA Ramen with the miso base... and the flavor of the broth hits the spot every. single. time. The selections here are super affordable & have generous portion sizes.  One down side is that this place is tiny and is ALWAYS poppin. So if you come on a busy time, expect to be waiting for a while. The parking lot is also tiny but there are residential areas around you can park at. This is so worth the wait and I always look forward to coming back when I'm home, whether it's 115 or 50 degrees out.",

    "text": "This place is definitely overrated. Prices and portions are pretty decent here, but if you've had ramen from Japan, this is nothing like it.  I've never had such thick ramen (in soup) before. I would say it was half as thick as udon, 2-3x as thick as ramen from Japan. I don't mind thick noodles, but the thick ramen was kinda like pasta to me.   The eggs were overcooked. The soft-boiled egg is probably one of the most important parts of authentic ramen and they boiled them for too long! The entire yolk should be liquid, not partially.  The broth was quite salty and filled with MSG. The Miso soup was actually a little spicy, but not mentioned in the menu. To me, the shoyu and shio broth were pretty much the same.  The chashu here was probably better than Japan. In Japan, the chashu were thin, dry pieces of pork but here, the chashu were thick and tender. Probably the only thing I actually liked from this place.  We were seated at a table where one side of the seats was against the wall. THE WALL WAS BURNING HOT! Around 42C that day and there was barely any AC, only a few fans. Keep in mind the ramen was also hot.",

Every single bowl of ramen is always delicious and fresh. We ordered some gyoza and garlic edamame as appetizers. They were so fresh and amazing. I would definitely recommend trying both. The ramen is just incomparable, the homemade noodles are the perfect touch. It tastes like some home comfort soup that can help with a cold or anything else that is bothering you. This place is definitely a must try if you are in Vegas.",

The *Tonkatsu Curry* is delightful, especially if you're a huge fan like I am of Japanese curry. It's not spicy so won't kick you in the face, in case you were wondering. Also good are the *Gyoza* potstickers, which are pan seared. Something different is the *Otsumami Platter* which includes seared chashu (pork just like in the ramen but way more savory), menma (bamboo shoots), and flavored egg.  As for the main stage event, the *Deluxe SORA Ramen* is super hearty. Hits the spot! That special fatty pork is thicker than the usual thin slices, and this bowl comes with bamboo shoots, green onions, soft boiled egg done perfectly with just the right texture, and seaweed. I added corn and garlic for a little extra charge. Totally worth it. I absolutely love all that garlicky broth!  Service was prompt and attentive, and all orders were delivered correctly. The ambiance is of a standard Ramen place, and is clean and well kept. Definitely recommend this for your Ramen recovery regimen.  TIP: The ramen here is very filling! Be prepared for a potential waddling situation.   DATE TIP: Lots of appetizers and very reasonable prices. In other words, you can keep your date happy and not break the bank!",

You won't find a large list of options or happy hour and trendy music here like its competitor JINYA.  Just solid classic ramen.   I will preface my review with I am not familiar with the authentic ramen restaurants of Asia.   Be prepared for a wait as the restaurant is tiny and always packed.   Their menu offers three bases for soup:  Miso - all the way get this base  Shoyu - need to try Shio -salty and bland. I don't recommend.   I will start by saying I initially tried shio base and was thoroughly disappointed. Salty, bland and quite frankly did absolutely nothing for me. After trying a spoonful of my friends spicy miso base soup I was \"that\" person and returned mine to the kitchen and asked for miso base instead. Feel free to roll your eyeballs at me here.   After my initial setback the amazingly delicious spicy miso ramen hits the table. Noodles perfectly al dente. Switching out my soup  was the best decision I made.  the soup was spicy and had a kick but not too hot to take away from the complex flavors - perfectly executed. I see a lot of complaints of the hard boiled egg being over cooked in other reviews but it was perfect for me today.   I took one star away for service - the waiter got pissy with me. Also for ambiance the interior of this restaurant didn't really have much to it.  Definitely give this place a shot for a solid bowl of ramen.",

Different style, different flavor but awesome quick service and as usual this place had a line waiting outside just like Monta but not quite as crazy.  Broth and noodles both excellent, not sure if they make their noodles from scratch but they are delicious.  The charsu appetizer was excellent and had a smokey flavor to it.   For sure will be back as this place was just that delicious.",

I'm typically a tonkotsu base ramen eater, but they don't offer it here. I settled for the miso based no. 1 deluxe which tasted amazing. The base was creamy and it transferred to the noodles. The pork was tender and everything else in the dish was good. I also had the gyoza which was the standard. If I lived in Vegas I would def be a regular, but I will def stop by when I visit!",

There are people who go straight from the airport directly to Ramen Sora. I would say expect anywhere from a 20-45 min wait.   My personal favorite is the Miso with corn and butter. A lot of people are often deterred from miso based broths (I was) but this is honestly the only ramen I can keep eating and not get sick of. The noodles are perfectly chewy and the broth is rich and savory. The bamboo shoots here are the only ones I like since most places use canned bamboo shoots that taste like a**.   Other notable mentions: -gyoza is a must (mix your own sauce soy, chili oil and vinegar. Holy trinity.)  -chashu bowl. A hearty dish served over rice and overall heavenly.",

The broth is the perfect amount of creamy. It's so flavorful and even if you're full, I swear you can stop! I have never everrrrr finished a bowl of ramen before. Like soup and everything! I usually order an extra egg and bamboo. I recommend the nori bowl with miso base. There is something about their miso base where it is just delicious! I took a few colleagues here and they loved it as well. The service is quick and very friendly which we really love.   My husband got the spicy meat in his ramen. If you like the ground beef style meat, you'll enjoy it! Brings a lot of extra flavor and a mild kick to your soup. Cheers all!",

This is review is about the last time I went here. I was grabbing lunch with a coworker. I ordered the Deluxe Sora Ramen. I remember when the Chasu used to be sliced to perfection with a smooth texture, the broth was not salty and the noodles had the right crunch. I'll be honest I don't if it was the 110 degree heat that day or if the air conditioning was not turned up high enough or if the cooks were in a rush. But the noodles tasted like it was soaked for a while, the meat was not very chewy and the broth tasted like they just added premade powder to a big bowl of broth. The only reason why I have it 3 stars is because in the past, the food quality was up there, but after my last visit, I hope they have improved.",

I've had the deluxe ramen which came loaded with flavor and meat!!  I requested hot sauce on the side so I can spice it up. Being Korean, I have to add spice to most everything :).   I've also had the buttered corn ramen too.  It smells and tastes amazing!!!     The broth at this restaurant was very decadent. If you're looking for a low-fat meal, this may not be ideal.  The broth is made from not only bone broth but some fatty bone broth!  It's not too much where it comes you heart burn or anything, so just welcome all the decadent flavors from each part of the ramen bowl!    The service is also pretty good. If we needed a water refill or more napkins, we just asked any server and they happily brought something over. Good team atmosphere from the staff, which I appreciate.  They also sell cool t-shirts too.   Just make sure you get there before typical meal times if you want to avoid a line.   Definitely worth the wait though!  They are open until 2:30am too!!!!

Service was quick and efficient, with an easy-to-read menu for first-timers.   I had the chashu ramen with miso (you can also get it with shoyu or shio), which was amazing. Tender pork, rich and filling miso broth, perfectly cooked noodles, bamboo shoots, and egg: it's a bowl of tantalizing flavors, delicious from the first to the last spoonful.   I can't ask for anything more in a comfortable ramen joint. It's far enough away from the Vegas strip craziness that you can hunker down with your bowl and warm up your bones as you try to forget about losing the kids' college fund at the craps table.",

The location is nice as they have their own parking lot which makes it easy to find a spot to park most times.  On don't go on the weekends as it can be crazy busy and the wait times can be atrocious.      I usually order the Deluxe Ramen Sora with the Miso broth.  The broth has a good depth to it and you can tell it took them some time to get it to be so tasty.  The Chasu is very tasty and plentiful.  It is so tender and not as fatty as other spots in Vegas.  I like the fact the Deluxe Ramen incudes an egg.  The egg to me is an integral part of Ramen and theirs is perfect and a great addition to the Ramen.    I have ate in and ordered to go.  On the weekends I order to go to avoid the wait times.  The inside is simple and the tables are eating are nothing special.  The point is to get in and get out as there is always someone waiting to get some delicious Ramen.  The service is always good and they are always friendly.  Even when they are busy once you sit down and order your Ramen and side orders are quick to arrive.

Their miso broth is very rich and full of flavor, you gotta believe it when they post on a sign that they cook this overnight.  The noodles are thick and chewy, cooked to perfection.  I ordered my deluxe with miso and extra noodles for $11, it's a pretty good deal in my book.  Note that I came at 3PM, completely off hours and it's decently busy.  Expect a long wait for prime time.",

Ramen Sora has unique flavors, and I like them. I'd heard good things about the Gyoza. It didn't disappoint. It's the best I've had. Since it was the first time here, the four of us all had the Deluxe SORA Ramen. It did not disappoint. There was an even split as to if this is better than Monta, or not. It's certainly excellent food in a perfect environment.",

A few highlights: - I REALLY loved my bowl at Sora. Great noodles, amazing broth, the best part was three huge slices of fatty pork belly. Hard to compare with Monta because I tried Monta last year, but I think I preferred the deluxe over Monta's tonkatsu which was a little too rich for me.  - Sora's seats more than Monta, but the wait is comparable for a weekday lunch (~15 min).  - Service wasn't the best, and didn't appreciate smokers by the front door and lack of ventilation, but overall I would definitely come back!",

    "text": "Just went here for lunch and my experience was just as good as the first time! This is definitely one of the better ramen places in Vegas and I would recommend checking it out if you haven't done so yet.  I have tried the Deluxe Sora Ramen ($10.00) and the Chashu ramen (for $9.25). The only difference between the two is that the deluxe one has 3 square pieces of seaweed which probably isn't worth the extra $0.75, but if you don't really care about cost then go for it! The pork is really flavorful and tender and not really fatty. I normally don't like eating pork, but this is one of the few exceptions because it is just that good! Also, most places just give you 1-2 pieces (i.e. Monta), but this place actually gives you a good amount. I actually had to finish my pork at the end by itself since I ate most of the noodles (which normally doesn't happen!). The broth is also really good and my personal favorite is the Shoyu (soy sauce) one. They also have miso which has a creamier texture and shio which is just lightly salted.   The restaurant itself is pretty clean and the staff is very nice. They are always smiling, enthusiastic, and willing to help if you have any questions. They also play the the of music you would hear in clubs lol. This place does have a wait time during peak lunch and dinner hours since it is popular and the restaurant itself it pretty small. It is worth the wait unless its over an hour.",

We understand the demand during the cold season. However this time around we wait awhile as usual, finally get called to sit. The lady seats us at a four top table because that's all that was available. We sit side by side so we can be close. Another waitress now takes our order. We are now sitting and talking while we wait for our order...we get interrupted by the original waitress who sat us at the table to ask us to move to a two top table. We looked at her confused. She then says she has \"3 persons waiting!\" And says we can still sit side by side at the two top table....really lady?! Was definitely not good customer service!  she is the one that sat us to begin with than asks us to move because she has 3 people waiting! When we waited patiently like everyone else. And as we were waiting we did noticed there was a single person at a four top table...but they didn't ask that person to budge. Definitely if you are looking for a good customer service restaurant, you won't find it here! Just rude and then thinks two people have enough elbow room to eat at a small table! I don't think so!",

As for the soup, it isn't oily or have some fat floating (due to the slices of the pork) in it like some other places have it in town. The menu isn't that big, but they have different items to fulfill everyone's craving. If you want normal favored miso to extreme spicy, they got it!  The pricing for the items on the menu are also pretty reasonable. I would recommend this place to anyone that wants a great bowl of ramen!",

    "text": "Recently came to this ramen spot on an impromptu ramen tour with my boyfriend when we were visiting Las Vegas. I would consider myself a ramen connoisseur of sorts. I tend to seek out new ramen spots frequently. I've been spoiled with the likes of Shin-sen-gumi and Santouka so I have standards set pretty high.  Per my fellow Yelpers positive reviews for Ramen Sora I visited to taste their ramen.  Experience as follows:  -Ambience: great spot, friendly staff. Nothing in particular stands out, typical privately owned Japanese ramen shop. We went around 2 for a late lunch, place was not full.  -Service: service was prompt and mostly friendly. I wouldn't say they went out of their way to give us great service, but I have no complaints on quality or speed of service.  -Food: we ordered the pork fried rice, shoyu ramen, and the shio ramen. We aren't particular for toppings so we usually go plain (bf) or with negi and egg (me).  *pork fried rice: it tasted great. Perfectly seasoned, great balance of pork and flavor. Rare is the day when we get a delectable side more appetizing than the main course.   *shio ramen: broth was weak and had an undesirable aftertase. Noodles were nothing special and the seasoned egg was flavorless. I was very disappointed in the broth.  *shoyu ramen: this was my bf's meal. His words: \"it's plain\". I believe one thing that makes ramen delicious is its ability to give you complex flavors. When a broth is nothing more than dashi stock and soy sauce, you've got a problem.  Overall/last remarks: while the ramen wasn't particularly good or special, I don't think this is a bad spot. Anyone who likes to have a variety of broths/styles would come here. But for me, I'm very particular about a ramen spot to take pride in their ramen. Generally that's done when a spot takes care to perfect a particular broth or soup. When they stretch themselves too thin their ramen tends to suffer. I would recommend this place to newbies or anyone looking for a decent lunch spot.",

Thankfully, my party of 7 came here at a good time and was able to get seated fairly quickly. Just be wary that if you do come here with a big party, it is a very small place.   I liked that their menu was simple and didn't have an overabundance of options. Typically, I have high expectations if a place has a small menu because they should be specializing and perfecting in those dishes. I ordered the Deluxe Sora Ramen. However, I never got to taste it, and here's what happened:  Me and two other people in my party ordered the same thing, but instead we were brought out the Killer Ramen (their spiciest ramen) which was previously called Screaming for Vengeance, I believe. When we brought this to the waitress' attention she said \"no, this is what you all ordered\" to which then proceeds to show us her notebook of what she wrote and justify the situation...Um, okay there's 7 of us here and we all heard each other order Deluxe Sora. Instead of trying to fix the situation, she kept justifying herself and said, \"well, I repeated the order and asked you if you were sure you wanted a large..\" First, we didn't hear her. Second, we later found out why she asked if we were sure...because the Killer Ramen is extremely spicy. Be more specific about what you are trying to confirm. We just stared at the mistakes cause it wasn't what we wanted, and she just star ed at us like she didn't want to try to fix it, so I got frustrated and said we'll just keep the mistakes. Thankfully, I handle spicy food very well (my friends claimed so too) and the ramen tasted yummy, but 2 minutes into it, they were drenched from sweating. Yep, make sure you mean it when you say you can handle spicy. I felt bad for them.  Lastly, we asked the check to be split four ways, and the waitress gave us a dirty look and said \"why don't you guys just split it 2 ways\". Well, obviouslyyy we're grouped up differently, so it's easier for us to pay that way. I wish this was a biased judgement of how the waitress treated us, but everyone in my party noticed it too.  I'll be back for a second try with an updated review since the ramen was good, but I couldn't fully enjoy it. I hadn't eaten all day and the killer ramen killed my stomach...",

    "text": "Ok so let me start of by saying ummm mmmm who doesn't love ramen!!!  Seriously?!   I am most definitely a suckered for some good authentic ramen.  Which is something hard to find in my neck of the woods.  I love the different variations of ramen that Ramen Sora had to offer.  Now I know your probably thinking about that quick ramen you get for 15 cents at walmart. But no this is not what I'm talking about. I am talking about a beautiful dance of noodles in a flavorful soup with fresh ingredients. OK so I had the corn butter ramen which is as amazing as it sounds. It is ramen in soup with butter and corn and ginger and veggies.  Honestly the best I've ever had!! The fact that there are minimal ingredients is the best to me because it allows you to fully enjoy everything without being overpowered by any one thing. I enjoyed the feel of this restaurant because it was cozy and I felt like a local.  It makes you feel like your in someone's home. Now this place is fairly close to the strip so your probably wondering well why don't you just go to the strip you'll probably  find something top notch?  The reason?  The best places no matter where you go are where the locals go.  Yes I do understand that some of the best chefs in the world have restaurants on the strip or they come to cook there but honestly good luck trying to first get into said restraunt and man are you gonna pay a lot.  This in no way takes away from these amazing chefs at all but sometimes where the locals go is where you should go. I highly recommend coming to Ramen Sora because ya just need to to.",

This ramen was some of the best I have ever had: noodles with just the right amount of chew, The shoyu (soy sauce broth) was flavorful and not too salty. Everything was great.  Now let me tell you what BLEW MY MIND..   Whatever you do, don't pass up the appetizer menu. The Seared Pork Chashu ($4) was one of the best things I have ever eaten. Period. Seared and smoky on the outside, tender tender tender on the inside. A little ribbon of fat that just melts in your mouth. Sauce that compliments the meat perfectly with out overpowering it. This is the kind of dish that converts vegetarians. This is the kind of dish that pigs dream about becoming.   Forget the strip, forget an overpriced buffet, just don't forget to get here early.. the place fills up fast.",

Today, my husband and I happened to be in the immediate area and we really wanted soup. We took our chances and decided to go back to Ramen Sora.   I'm sure glad we did! We both ordered the Deluxe Sora miso ramen. This has everything in it: pork, seaweed, bamboo shoots, and an egg.  All I can say is wow. The miso pork broth is absolutely delicious! I can see why this place is so crowded. Then again this is a very small establishment and only has but maybe 10 tables.   I would highly recommend this place. Just get there early when they first open, not unless you don't mind the wait. Not a great place to come with a big party of people.",

That should tell you something. This place legit even as far as LA standards go. I had the miso deluxe ramen with an order of gyoza and it was very good. Service is fantastic.  For all of you Monta lovers out there, this review is by no means to say that this is the best ramen in LV. Sora is a different style and I like Monta too. It wouldnt be fair to compare the two.",

If people are in this Vegas heat and still waiting to eat hot soup... That says a lot. People ordered a melon soda drink while they waited. (they serve alcohol as well ) I ordered the miso ramen and my fiance had the spicy shoyu. Both were amazing!!!  The noodles were cooked perfectly but still chewy.  The broth was rich but not over powering.  Customer service was amazing.  Those women were on top of it.  They all helped each other and everything was insync as they sat us down, someone did the ordering,  the other women helped serve other tables.  Im glad I didn't have to wait for our specific server to bring it cause she had help.  Overall.... Great ramen shop. And now my only ramen stop.",

Until then, all we had tried was the Tonkotsu-Shoyu ramen from Ramen Monta and since we loved that one, it really was hard to go somewhere else for something different.   And \"different\" was the word that describes the Miso based ramen we tried. This was my first miso ramen and I ordered it spicy. What I didn't know was that spicy meant \"spicy meat\"? Unfortunately, I found out that I didn't like the spicy meat flavor so much. I thought it overwhelmed or spoiled the actual miso flavor a little and it felt a little like eating spaghetti bolognese - but what do I know, right? Plus, it didn't really add extra spice - side note: hubby and I are both crazy spicy food eaters, so that could be why.  But I'm learning something new almost everyday when it comes to Japanese food and now I feel like every restaurant makes this dish a little different. I need some Ramen education for dummies or Ramen 101 to learn about all the different kinds. I think so far I like the pork based broth the best but it is also only one of the two I have tried so far.",

Didnt really appreciated my duty station nor the host country as much as i should have but Ramen is one thing you could count on when you just squandered your paycheck at the bar and you're tired of eating at the mess hall.  I remember my first time at a Ramen house in Hiroshima...From the outside looking in through a foreigner's eyes what caught me was the wax display bowls of noodles through some glass. It looked good enough and i was hungry as hell so why not. I dont remember the name of the place, most likely because i cant read nor do i understand Japanese but the wax bowls was good enough. Ordering was a bit of a pain as i had to leave my seat, walk with the waitress over to the display and point at what i wanted but when it came out...WOW. The broth was rich i mean REALLY rich, the noodles were firm and chewy and slices of pork were perfect. Perfect both in taste and meat to fat ratio.  Ramen Sora doesnt exactly replicate the same taste or sensations but then again how could i expect them to? The perfect replication of New York style pizza has to go as far as it analyze NY tap water and recreate it to even begin to mimic the crust. Do I expect Ramen Sora to hire a bunch of scientists to cough up an exact mineral analysis of Japanese tap water in order to recreate authentic ramen in Las Vegas? Well yes but when that comes i wont complain about paying over 20 dollars for a bowl.  Long story short, compared to other ramen houses which i will not name (completely dedicated to ramen not 'oh look they have ramen on the menu even though they specialize in Japanese import auto repairs'), Ramen Sora is as close as i'm gonna get without going back to Japan.   Compared to what i remember of authentic Japanese Ramen, Sora is a bit on the bland side but their menu choices as well as optional sides well make up for it. The pork they use is so damn close it's almost scary to me.  So far i've had the Miso broth and it was damn good if not a little bland due to personal preference, and that didnt stop me from devouring the entire bowl.  I would definitely go back to try out the other broths and HIGHLY recommend this place as well as return to in the winter when it gets colder.",

I didn't want go, because 1) I don't eat noodles 2) I though it would taste only a notch above those packaged ramen noodles that cost 25 cents a pack, so why would I pay about $10 bucks for the same thing?  I came here because I had a pushy guest from NJ that wanted ramen he had in LA.  So I selected Sora based on Yelp reviews and my husband once got ramen at Monta and it wasn't good beside they were shut down once for health violations.  Service was a little choppy, but all 4 of us were annoying \"newbies\" with several questions regarding our dietary issues (no red meat, shellfish allergy, low carb). So I understand since she was the waitress and also the cashier and the only one working the front. Anyway, the waitress would stop taking our order to serve other people and come back and continue with our order.  I was very pleased that I was able to order my shio deluxe ramen with the noodles on the side.    All of us loved our ramen choices.  The shio broth was so rich, simple, and comforting.  The noodles looked good and fresh, my guests ate all my noodles, in addition to theirs. So I I take it, the noodles were good. The sliced pork was tender and with the perfect amount of fat that just melts in your mouth.  I've been craving this, ever since I had it.....MUST. GO. BACK.FOR. SOME. MORE!",

The Sapporo style ramen noodle is slightly thick, curly and complements the fatty broth well. Since the noodles are slightly curly more of the broth coats the noodle. This makes for a fun splurpfest.   If you come on a weeknight or after 6:40pm, be prepared to wait 20 minutes.",

    "text": "It's very easy to find this place. In fact, it's isolated from the plazas of Chinatown because this place is in its own building. There's also a sign that pretty much screams out its name. The parking lot is small and I can just see the annoyance of getting out of the lot if the place gets very busy. In this situation, I think parking on the side streets is optimal than deciding to park your car inside of the tiny lot. It's also angled awkwardly, but it's nothing to get annoyed about.  Once inside, the decorations gives a sense of familiarity if you ever went inside a ramen restaurant. They also play EDM music which is good for those who just finished partying on the Vegas strip. The waitress was friendly and was patient with my group so there were no issues with service at all. The price range is about average on what to expect at a ramen place. For myself, I ended up ordering the Deluxe ramen bowl with miso soup. The bowl itself is ten dollars, but was it worth it?  Yeah. I was never a huge fan of ramen, so I'm not some otaku that cries out \"sugoi\" for every ramen place I eat at. However, compared to other places, it was pretty good. The pork blended well with the miso, the egg was great, and the noodles weren't too hard nor were they too soft. Instead, they were just right. The miso itself was average in terms of saltiness.  Just like most Vegas restaurants, you're likely to come out here after a night with a huge hangover in hopes of a recovery from food. It's open almost 24 hours and it's definitely worth a trip to Chinatown.   So come to Ramen Sora, it's one of the many Pho and Ramen places that engulf the Chinatown area, but does a good job at separating itself from the rest.",

    "text": "A year was too long to wait for a return visit. I've eaten quite a bit of ramen since then, but none of it was at Ramen Sora. I corrected that mistake today.  I had to experiment by ordering the simple Miso Ramen ($7.50) instead of the Deluxe Sora Ramen. I needed to see for myself how well the basic order held up. It was in large part the same, with a flavorful broth (didn't seem as salty this time), good bamboo shoots (not fresh, but most don't use fresh shoots anyway), al dente noodles, and green onions. The egg yolk was not runny, which is strange to me because I expressly noted it last time. However, I really missed the nori and especially the extra chashu offered in the Deluxe. The chashu here is meaty but incredibly tender, and it's flavored with a little ginger. It's superior to the equally tender but fattier versions that other notable places serve, and it's why I will stick to the \"go big or go home\" philosophy in future visits.  As I hinted above, I want to describe this place in the overall ramen landscape.  Ramen Sora is still one of my two favorite ramen restaurants in Las Vegas alongside Fukumimi (hence 5 stars), although I still haven't made my mind up on Jinya Ramen or even visited Ramen Misoya Tomi.  The Deluxe is still not the best ramen bowl I've had in town. That honor would go to one of two varieties that I've eaten at Japanese Cuisine by Omae (a prix fixe dinner restaurant, but they've served ramen lunches at times).  Finally, it's certainly at least a notch below the best ramen that I've had in California (Santouka, Ramen Yamadaya), but it's still worth a try as long as you stick to the miso broth. I might try the shio (salt) ramen here in the future, for science of course, but shoyu (soy sauce) is a consistent letdown wherever I go.",

The parking is vey limited for a place that gets very busy so if there's little parking, you'll have to park on the side streets. Inside is crowded so you literally have to push people aside just to get through to either the restroom or to your table (if it's ready for you). I'm not going to lie, we had a big family to accommodate with kids, too. [Talk about 10 people so I understand that it was challenging for the workers especially on a busy Wednesday night with little seating trying to help everyone else].  When we were seated, they were being really pushy about what we wanted to eat. There was no sense of patience and when we asked what was popular on the menu, one of the ladies rolled her eyes and said \"everything that is ramen\". Okay?   My cousin could not have anything because she does not eat meag and was also allergic to a lot of the ingredients on the menu. When she asked if she could get food elsewhere and bring it in, they told her she had to eat it outside because it was not \"welcomed here.\"   As for the food, the ramen was salty and the noodles were hard. Not good at all and will not plan on going back. Would not recommend especially with the bad service and rude behavior we were given. Get your ramen elsewhere.",

The ramen comes with decent portion of Chasu, the egg and the usual: bamboo, onions... I usually add corn too! The Chasu here is thick cut which is amazing, other places give you the thinnest slice you can imagine!!   Always quick and good service! The food here is just amazing!!",

It's nothing that will blow you away, especially if you're a ramen addict who typically eats at top spots in Japan or at least in cities with bigger Japanese populations - but it is a very reliable and consistent spot that gets the job done. So it does deserve the 4* in this city.  I typically get a deluxe with a miso base and add more bamboo shoots and seaweed. I also like their pork fried rice, but the portion size is very small, especially for $6. I'd pass on the gyoza. At times, they do have off-menu special apps or drinks (usually a handwritten sign on a wall somewhere), so keep an eye out for those.  I would probably go elsewhere if you are not going for the miso base or corn butter ramen.",

We placed our orders quickly and the food was ready and at our table within minutes. My bf got the killer ramen challenge which he loved. The meat itself is what's spicy, by the end he was sweating enough to have to take his hat off. He would've gotten seconds if he hadn't been so full. I got chasu pork ramen in a soy sauce base with extra chasu, butter and corn. O. M. G. So freaking delicious. The total came out to under 30 bucks.

I barely touched the ramen, and for a ramen enthusiast, this rarely happens.  In addition, they wouldn't seat us till our whole party was there, but it wasn't peak hour and the place barely had anyone in it....  I also ordered a side of Japanese pork fried rice, that was good and the portion was quite big.

The place is quite popular, so be prepared to wait. The crowd keeps moving pretty quickly so the wait is not too long. We had to wait for like 7-10mins but that actually helped us to read through their personal ads for what they recommend you to have while you are there. We ordered all there recommended items - Chasu Bowl, The Miso Ramen with Spicy Meat and the Pan Fried Dumplings. The dumplings were very fresh. Loved the ramen - it was perfectly spicy and the broth was fabulous enough to cure a sick man. The Chasu bowl was also very nice - loved the favors and texture of the dish overall.

Ramen will never be the same for me....  Came here on a weekend night and came in right before a huge rush of people. The restaurant isn't very big and the place seems very popular. I ordered the spicy miso ramen with extra chashu. The broth was amazing and it wasn't too spicy. It was just enough to give it extra flavor without burning your mouth. I don't know how to describe this broth. It was warm, rich, and absolutely delicious!! The chashu was cooked perfectly. It was tender and practically melted in your mouth with the miso broth. I also thoroughly enjoyed the bamboo shoots that were still a bit crunchy, perfection!  I tried the shoyu broth as well, which was good, but nothing compares to the miso broth. If you come here, don't even contemplate about getting anything but the miso. It is a MUST! The ramen comes in regular or large, and by large I mean ginormous. It's a pretty big helping, so you've been warned.   The service was on point. We were seated immediately. The waiter was very attentive and informative. He was able to explain the different broths and the different menu options. Everyone was able to decide what they wanted rather quickly after he educated us on the menu and everyone was satisfied with their order. So job well done. I can't wait to come back to satisfy my ramen cravings.",

    "text": "Not the best ramen in the world. Maybe I am just saying that coming back from Oahu where the Japanese influence is insanely strong and the ramen is tonkatsu driven and viscous and creamy and delicious. It was miso style which is nice in its lightness but the pork belly was undercooked, very fatty, the broth was either too salty (in my mans case) or the toppings were too cold (in my case). Also, it is mostly communal seating, which isn't a bad thing if you are there with a large group, but as a two-top we felt crowded at our large table filled with homecoming gowns and tuxes.   It should be noted though that the service was great. We were checked on frequently. They were very nice friendly and helpful. The place, the tables and the bathrooms were immaculately clean.   All in all, if you are looking for inexpensive casual ramen for lunch or with a large party, this place is great. Otherwise, maybe look elsewhere.",

You get three choices in broth, and the noodles are supposedly direct from Sapporo.  I've never been steered wrong here, but just be aware that the Killer Spicy ramen is legit spicy...even with my south Asian palate.  My favorite is the shoyu-miso broth...it's a good middle of the road broth.  The dining room is chill, comfortable and casual.  Parking can be a bit of a pain, but there is a residential neighborhood right behind it, so you can park on the street.  All in all....a solid 4 star review.",

    "text": "I can say I enjoyed my visit to this establishment. The restaurant is tiny and gets very busy quickly. I would recommend coming when they open to avoid the long wait.  The broth for the ramen comes in 3 different choices: shoyu, shio and miso. I had ordered the miso Screaming for Vengeance ramen bowl. It had chashu pork, menma, seaweed and bean sprouts. It's supposedly the most spiciest ramen in Las Vegas. I can say it wasn't nearly close to being spicy that burned. It had a slight kick but it wasn't, by my standard, spicy. But the broth was very tasty. It was a pork based miso broth. I slurped up the entire large bowl I had ordered. I loved the texture of the noodles. It wasn't too chewy and it certainly wasn't over-cooked. It was perfect to me. Perfectly chewy and enjoyable. The chashu pork was melt-in-your-mouth goodness.  I recommend anyone checking this place out of you're in the area.",

They only have the three basic soup bases of shio, shoyu, and miso. I got the special and my girl got the chasu ramen both in miso.  Wow! It did not disappoint. I got a regular size but I could have easily finished a large. The broth was rich and flavorful. The noodles were nicely cooked. The chasu melted in my mouth. Lots of fatty content on the chasu. Very delicious and well worth a try. I usually don't drink all my broth but I almost finished all of this one.  The only downside is that the place is tiny. If you have a big crowd you will have to wait. You could see a lot of oil floating on the broth too. Just FYI for people afraid of oil. Next time in Vegas I'll be back for sure",

I'm sure this is a great place if you are new to ramen, or am not as picky as I when it comes to ramen. I'm sure there are many who love this place, as I do see by the reviews.

I had the miso ramen, my personal favorite with extra seaweed. They put these delicious, fabulously textured slices of pork in the ramen. This pork sets them apart from other places.

Ramen Sora serves Sapporo style ramen, which is a little thicker and chewier, but I like it, it feels a little more substantial.  They have two main broths, a shio (salt) or a miso based one.  The miso broth is a little thicker, but tastes really good, especially with the pork and veggies.  The shio broth is much lighter, both in color and flavor, but as the waitress described it, it's perfect for summer.  The pork was delicious, and they don't skimp on the serving size either which is nice.  I got the deluxe bowl which pretty much comes with everything, which was a plus and minus for my first time.  I discovered that I do not care for nori in my ramen, as I didn't like how it's flavor paired with the pork.  I also thought that the hard boiled egg I had in my soup was slightly overdone, but that could just be a preference of mine.  I also got the gyoza, and just so everyone knows, it takes 8 minutes to cook, so order when you sit down or you'll end up getting them after your meal.  The gyoza were fine, crispy on one side, with a very nice dipping sauce.  They give you a ready made dipping sauce, but you can also make your own if you like.  On the whole, a very pleasant and somewhat inexpensive lunch experience.",

It's calling for that savory umami brothy goodness that is cooked for days on end that with one taste brings you to an eye rolling ecstasy.What is the only place that comes to mind when I think about this? Ramen Sora. Hands down the best ramen I have ever had.   It starts when you first enter the door. You get greeted with a loud and warm \"Irasshaimase!\" and for that split second you get sucked into a vortex and transported into Japan.   The ramen? Killer. The broth? Exceptional. The chasu pork? Tender and flavorful. Mix them all together into one bowl? A flavor combination that will have your head spin. Get the miso ramen and the umami level goes up to 11. It's a pure delight to have one of these savory and rich ramen dishes all at a small price of  $10.   With the cold weather upon us, this will be on my return often list. I can't get enough of them. They win. Take my money!  Get out of the way Monta there is a new king in town and it's called Ramen Sora.",

It is actually better than Monta in my opinion.",

I didn't want to take the Ramen home because wanted my Ramen experience to be in the Ramen Sora restaurant the next time around. So ordered the large pork chashu bowl and the Kurodoma Dango to go. The staff was very nice and my food didn't take long. When I got home to eat the pork chashu bowl was so good as well as the dango!! I really have to visit Ramen Sora again to try the ramen. I sort of kicked myself now for not staying in to try the ramen when I was there.",

Rich, salty, thick and hearty... perfect for rainy day or anytime a ramen craving hits.   Watch out Monta... Ramen Sora is taking over!!!",

They offer well portioned size bowls that already come with a variety of toppings included with the option to add more to your hearts content. This place can get busy during peak hours and weekends but wait times are usually not that long. I am a big fan of their miso flavored ramen and I do recommend you try them! I would also recommend their pork chirasu bowls. In my opinion their chirasu is the best in town!!!! My only gripe with ramen sora is that they do not allow you to order extra noodles on the side like other ramen places in town. 4 stars for great food!",

As soon as I tasted the broth I was in Miso creamy broth heaven.  Taste was on point; not too salty, but salty enough for salty lovers like myself.  Pork melted in my mouth as I ate the 3 generous helpings, and the seaweed was a beautiful compliment to the bowl.  The noodles here are cooked the correct consistency, and not starchy to taste at all!  Loved every inch of my bowl!  I felt I needed more green in my meal so I ordered a side of perfectly salted Edamame.  So far, this place beats out super salty with over priced add-ins at Monta Ramen, and super bland and shady on the meat on super starchy noodles at Anime.",

    "text": "Years ago I moved into china town..well actually I moved into an old neighborhood in Las Vegas area that slowly became china town. (I was here first!) I saw the whole transformation, I saw my favorite video store and other favorite places turn into massage parlors. but before all that, when I first moved into the area while exploring the neighborhood I walked from my house to spring mountain and ran into this little place called Mario's hair salon at 4490 spring mountain, decided to give them my business and got a haircut.....and this is where the story begins.   I had the worst haircut of my life at This place! and I was so upset and pissed off that in a moment of rage I cursed the place!  Mario went out of business and so did all the business that followed him after that. I've seen restaurants in this locale come and go and even though I never tried any of the previous restaurants I think is time for me to finally return to the place of occurrence, besides what's the worst they could do? ruin my lunch? They can't ruin my hair anymore, not even Mario, most of it is gone! so after all this years, I walked into the place again...    I didn't know how big Ramen is in japan, I always considered Ramen as fast junk food, or something you would eat when broke but with all this ramen places popping up in Chinatown I decided to venture outside my world of instant ramen noodles and try the real thing, so I followed the wave of fellow yelpers to Ramen Sora to see for myself what is the big deal with this place.  Ramen Sora brings the traditions and recipes of Sapporo Japan, they take their ramen very seriously making the stock by boiling bones for almost a day. ( not the three minute wait that I was used to.) the decor is minimalist but functional since the place is kind of small every square inch is taken advantage of, atmosphere is very relaxing and you feel like you are seating with the rest of the other customers because everyone is so close but do not worry enjoy your ramen and slurp freely! ( my neighbor did) The always smiling waitress Taeko, recommended me the shio ramen which ended up being surprisingly good, it was light and not too fatty, although I wish they had seafood ramen but hopefully in the future they'll expand the menu to more choices. They will also be serving alcohol in the near future, and I can attest to that since I was in the same hearing (for a different matter) when the owner asked for permission in front of the board, and it was approved! I'm glad Ramen Sora is the new resident of 4490 spring mountain, I was always afraid another massage place would take over like all my other favorite places in the area. I really liked the food and the service and I believe this place will be here for years to come. For my part, the curse has been lifted, good luck Ramen Sora!  and thank you for the happy ending!",

    "text": "The Skinny: finally! a really decent ramen house in Las Vegas! I would pass on the dessert though (4) service: went during the first week of opening, a little disorganized but it's still pretty good given the Japanese efficiency (3) value: it's not bad as long as you don't order extra toppings which seem relatively pricey (4).  We came here opening week to try out their miso ramen and within a few days, we were back for more. It was really reassuring to hear a bunch of Japanese spoken in this joint by both the customers and the staff. You know that likely this stuff can't be that far from legit.  Here's the menu items we have tried so far: miso ramen, spicy miso ramen, mini chasu bowl, premium chasu side order and a order of their mochi dessert.   Breakdown of the broths: the underlying broth has a robust, decadent pork flavour to it. Throw in the miso ($7.50) or spicy miso, you have a well balanced bowl of homey goodness. The spicy miso ($8.50) adds a judicious amount of heat to round out the taste without detracting from the underlying taste of the soup. Very subtle and well done. I think of the three broths, spicy miso might be my favourite.  The noodles are in the standard ramen style and cooked perfectly. Slightly thicker than your standard fare, I really loved the mild chewiness of the noodle which speaks to its freshness. Really, a mouth full of joy.  The egg was ramen perfection - hard boiled with a thin layer of soy permeating on the outside, a precise ratio of cooked to runny yolk on the inside. Loved it. Could have eaten at least three of those eggs alone.  If there is a weakness in the bowl, it's with the chasu. Even though the chasu does have a good texture and flavour, it could be a little bit more melt in the mouth. A little too thinly sliced for my liking, it is worth the upgrade for a few extra slices ($2) to make a more satisfying meal.  If it's your first time here, I wouldn't recommend getting a menma ramen ($8.50) or a corn/butter ramen ($9). Considering the price of these additions to the regular bowl, it's rather expensive factoring in the relative cost of the product. I mean, really, $1 for extra green onion? You can buy 3 bunches of that in the Chinese grocery store across the street. Stick to the extra chasu and maybe the tamago if you're an egg fan - you won't be disappointed.  We did try the premium chasu side order but was rather disappointed that it was served stone cold with some congealed fat on it. That certainly detracted from the texture of the product and I would not recommend ordering it.  Instead, get an side order of the mini chasu bowl ($2.85). The chasu, cut into chunks, is layered with negi (Japanese green onion) over rice with a light sprinkle of the marinating soy broth. Very stick to your ribs kind of food and highly satisfying. The chasu fared better in this instance given the way that it was served but again was not quite the perfect texture. Regardless, given the price, it's really worth a try.  Finally, the dessert. We tried their mochi balls filled with red bean and rolled in black sesame ($2). Given the great quality of the dishes here, it really fell flat in comparison. While the filling was okay, the mochi itself was overly dry. I'd pass on this menu item because there are so many other great things to fill your belly with.  Overall, I'm so happy that this place opened because we used to drive all the way out to LA to get a half-decent bowl of ramen. Now my husband can spare me the 4 hour drive there and satisfy his cravings at Ramen Sora (4).",

Sora dose the clear broth perfect, their soup is not too thin and not too thick, and when it comes to ramen, i love perfect clear broth.  Mota dose the tonkotsu base fairly well, but my personal reference, i like the Sora soup.   Noodle is thicker than what i like but their noodle is thick \"chijire\" (means wiggly and not straight) and gose really well w. the soup.   service is quck and loved that they serve tea at the end. I will keep going back here when i'm in vegas",
