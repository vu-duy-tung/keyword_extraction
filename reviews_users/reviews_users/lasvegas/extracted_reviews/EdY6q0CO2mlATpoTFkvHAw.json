Red bean ice simple yet delicious.  So far my only gripe about this place is the price but considering I don't have to drive 30-45 minutes to get here, I'm willing to come back here over and over.",

    "text": "I was craving some good Dim Sum, but haven't had any luck finding a place that is nearby, great tasting, or clean. I found this place only 10 min from my area in Summerlin. This place has a huge sign of big blue letters that you can't miss it! We ordered the steamed shrimp dumplings , har how, chicken sui mai, won ton soup, and the HK style shrimp pan fried noodles. We also wanted to order the broccoli stems, but were strongly persuaded by the server to get the snow pea stems (3x price of broccoli stems) instead. The pan fried noodles had just the right balance of crispy noodles and noodles immersed in the sauce, wasn't greasy, and very flavorful. So far, the best pan fried noodles I've had in this neighborhood! We were a bit surprised that the snow pea stems were the most expensive dish on our bill, but we were satisfied with the garlicky stems which had a nice crunch to it. I don't mean to be harsh, but Dim Sum is just not their speciality. The pieces we ordered were all over cooked and bland. Not bad but tasted frozen. They don't come in carts and just order each one. I noticed that most people around me were having the $7 lunch plates and it looked good. Overall, we were very happy with the service, cleanliness of the place, and with our noodle and vegetable dish. Will definitely be back for the noodles and other dishes.",

They cannot have carts go by as there is not a crowd, to have the food sit on them all day, somehow this place is not in a good location, people will just pass it by ,, they need to do something to bring in the crowd, improve food taste, reduce the cost on the noodle,food dishes and or increase the portion...

I think the same goes for most Asian or ethnic restaurants including Dim Sum Cafe. If you can get past the dingy walls/floors and forgetful, slow service, you will be rewarded with hot, fresh and delicious Dim Sum devoured at a leisurely pace and good price. I'm no Dim Sum expert (I'm not Chinese), but the chow mein was not too oily with refreshing, crunchy cabbage peppered in; the mushroom shu mai was satisfyingly savory; the BBQ pork bun was more hot, fluffy bun than the seasoned filling it contained; and the egg tart, although a little soggy at the bottom, was a perfectly sweet, relatively smooth custard. Although the service was slow, I didn't mind waiting because I was catching up with a friend over lunch, sipping tea as we waited for each filling dish to come out. What they lacked in service they made up for when I got the bill--About $13 for the four dishes and tea we had ordered. I look forward to spending more lazy brunches here and trying everything on their menu.",

I love beef chow fun (dry) and beef and broccoli and use those two items to determine whether if this is a good restaurant. Those two items were superb. One of my favorites and I eat a lot of Chinese food. The dim sum was average, nothing spectacular but it curved the craving I had for it.

We will definitely be ordering from this establishment again!",

I was ignored the moment I stepped into the restaurant, despite the fact that they were not busy. I ordered har gow, shrimp noodle, chicken feet, beef tendon and shark's fin. My shrimp noodle was bland. The har gow was tough. My beef tendon lacked a lot of flavor. Chicken feet and shark's fin are the ones i enjoyed. Their food is not the best, but it's somewhat edible.

    "text": "After sampling a bunch of different plates, I'm honestly surprised that their ratings weren't better. DSC will probably be my new go to for Chinese food, EVERYTHING I ordered was delish. Even as take out it was still better than most places in Vegas. The curry cream cheese rangoons were a welcome break from the normal rangoons that have so much grease you could lube your car with them. They were crispy, light and tasty. The dim sum approach of less is more definitely works here. I took one bite of the baked sweet cream buns and saved the rest for dessert. They were incredible, light, flaky with custard that wasn't too sweet or overdone inside. Just a taste was enough. I love udon noodles and cook at home with them often, so I'm partial to this place as they don't just offer them in soup. The combo udon lo mein with shrimp, beef and chicken was perfect, not too salty or sauced with the noodles still firm and plenty of shrimp. Most chinese places try to save $$ by calling something a combo or shrimp dish and then giving you only 1 or 2 shrimp and loading it with cheaper beef or chicken. Not DSC.  The lemon chicken was light with a bit of zest, not too sweet or drowning in sauce like many places offer. My only gripe was that I would have liked a little more sauce in it, but ordering a side of extra sauce is an easy fix. The cashew chicken was loaded with vegetables and hot, filled with tons of chicken. While a pretty standard offering, it was done well. Bonus was that all the chicken in all the dishes was clearly white meat, firm and cooked perfectly. Almost every chinese place I've been to in this town uses dark or thigh meat that's chewy and gristly to save $$$, and it grosses me out.  I'm extremely impressed and looking forward to eating there to get the full-on dim sum experience. All of the staff were very friendly, more than I would have expected for a take out meal. Nothing but good things to say about them. They have very large menu that should accommodate just about any taste or flavor you can think of. Kudos.",

Not very close to the Strip and Aria Resort where we stay, but well worth the Uber ride there!! We are used to the great Dim Sum restaurants in the San Gabriel Valley in Southern California so know what we like. Turned out that our local friend had dined here before and loves it. The restaurant sits in a commercial center and has easy to see blue letters sign. Once inside it's nothing fancy, but warm and comfortable. The dim sum menu and Chinese food menu is HUGE!! We came for the dim sum so only ordered from that menu. No roaming carts with cold food here. Everything is made to order. Usually when you order tons of dim sum you are bound to find a few not up to par, but not here. Everything was fresh, hot and delicious AND at a very fair price for the quality. Our service was great so no issues there. Definitely on a must visit again on our next Las Vegas trip!!",

We started off with some Dim Sum/Apps: Pot stickers, Cream cheese won ton and baked BBQ pork buns. They were all delicious, well presented and reasonably priced. We then ordered the Mongolian Beef lunch special (7.95) which comes with 1 egg roll and a cup of egg drop soup. Usually the entree is spicy hot and I asked to have it toned down a bit. The soup and egg roll were very good and the Mongolian Beef was prepared just the way I requested...not too hot. Just enough kick to make you sweat a little. All in all it was a nice experience and good food for a reasonable price. The only thing that I noticed that was a bit disturbing were all of the surveillance cameras inside the restaurant  ..about 9 or 10. Kinda strange for such a small dining area.",

All the dim sum we ordered - chicken shu mai, chive dumplings, shrimp stuffed in mushroom, baked BBQ pork buns, Chinese brocolli - came out piping hot and, were quite delicious! We've certainly had better tasting dim sum but we were pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste.  We rarely order Chinese brocolli from the carts because they often are woefully undercooked and barely edible but these were tender and yummy.   We also ordered the roast duck, which was perfectly crispy, and chicken chow fun, which the kids loved. We are looking forward to trying the other things on the menu as the food tasted more \"authentic\" Chinese than the takeout places we resort to given the lack of options in Summerlin.  Service was attentive, the place was clean and we left feeling very satisfied. Definitely our new go-to place for Chinese food and dim sum in the neighborhood - and they deliver!   Give this place a shot!",

    "text": "I'm Asian and I've eaten at many dim sum restaurants, and this is my take on the Dim Sum Cafe:   The variety of dim sum dishes is good. You might think that this restaurant doesn't carry as much variety as other dim sum restaurants, but that is because this restaurant only has several carts circulating around the restaurant at any given time, so it looks like there is less choices.  However, they do not have the more traditional dim sum houses choices like preserved duck-egg congee and tofu/ginger.  The quality of dim sum is good. Thumbs up for taste & freshness. No difference in portion size, and dishes were not greasy. The chicken steamed buns were a bit dry & doughy, but all other choices were excellent.  Price is comparable to other dim sum restaurant. Our check for 4 was the same as other dim sum places.  No pushy dim sum cart lady coming by every minute disturbing your meal. The cart comes out maybe 2-3 times total in the whole meal. Only a few of the staff is Asian, which is OK because the non-Asian staff appeared to be knowledgeable about the menu and was attentive. This might be a good dim sum starter restaurant for those who want decent dim sum but don't want the hustle of Chinatown.  The decor is clean with some fish aquariums, but there is absolutely nothing Asian about it. You wouldn't know you're in an Asian restaurant and thought you were in a really clean Denny's. Perhaps restaurant management can put a couple of inexpensive Asian-like items (lanterns, bamboo, red color, etc) to be consistent with the restaurant's name.  Crazy menu needs to be refined. What is with the hamburger and sandwiches? Not sure why they feel the need to stick American breakfast stuff and other items in the menu, and why customers will go to a dim sum restaurant to get American food.  This is very confusing and gives the impression that management does not know what they are doing.    Their dim sum is good, it's also the name of the restaurant, so they should clean up the menu and stick to what they do well...dim sum!",

We ordered, steamed bbq buns,  siu mai, beef tendon, sticky rice, rolled shrimp, rolled noodles in xo sauce which was super oily, fried rice, Mongolia beef and hot and sour soup. Some dishes were not good and some were. So for me the main dishes are ok, dim sum not so much. Probably not coming back here.",

The reason this place doesn't deserve 5/5 is the service was terrible. Our waitress sat us, served us water, and forgot about us for at least 15 minutes. It honestly wasn't her fault either, they're just so obviously understaffed",

    "text": "Disappointed I didn't go to a True dim sum restaurant on Spring Mountain.  Like other Yelpers I thought I'd give this new place a shot. I was first excited about a dim sum place close to our Vegas house but then I was let down when I saw the menu. Their name \"Dim Sum Cafe\" implies that they know what dim sum is...but this place has little idea what they are doing.  The serving staff is predominantly non-Asian and had no clue what cheong fun noodles and traditional dim sum fare are.  I explained what I was looking for \"beef cheong fun\" and the server said they have it. When the dish arrived it was beef noodle stir fry- not even close to the flat rice noodle filled with beef, pork, or shrimp.  I ordered 2 and those plates never touched my table- I sent them back as soon as I saw them. It's like I went to a so-called hamburger stand and they had no clue what a cheeseburger is. Gawd. It took a while for them to figure out we need plates and I guess they didn't have chopsticks ready.    $4.25 eggroll (2 pieces): you think it would be good or large for the money, right? Wrong. It seemed like they just fried some eggrolls from Ranch 99 and charged $2 a piece. Super rip-off because the eggroll was not very tasty. Adding insult to injury my kid ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and they didn't have cheddar cheese so she got a grilled mozerella sandwich. Yuck.   Confused menu: small dim sum collection, American breakfast of oatmeal, waffles, french toast. Salads, spaghetti, and fish.   Wait staff was slow to figure out we needed place settings and our server acknowledged that they were having many customers complaining about the menu. Restaurant was clean (it's 2 weeks new) and the TVs on the wall still had the Energy Consumption sticker on them. No fish in the tanks yet, either.   I hope these reviews serve as a wake-up call to the owners. Vegas is not the kind of place that supports or tolerates a bad restaurant- especially one that leaves customers feeling tricked and overcharged. I would love to pay good money for good food, but this place is like its indoor wooden trellis: the structure is there but it isn't polished and leaves people asking the question \"Why?!\"  I'd skip this place until they get many of the wrinkles ironed out.  Hopefully they do it soon before the Grand Opening turns into the Grand Closing.",

You're welcome with a friendly smile and the typical asian mom figure trying to upsell the flounder; not in an offensive way, but the kind of charismatic way that actually makes you want it. The food has been a hit with me. Favorites are chicken feet (warm, sweet, soft, chewy), tripe (aromatic, gingery, soft), the shrimp ball (crunchy outside, soft inside), and the snowpeas (lightly aromatic, and palate cleansing). Very nice. This is my go to in Vegas atm.  Come with friends, enjoy the tea, enjoy the conversation, leave with a smile and an full stomach.  Will eat again!!",

Customer service was not bad compared to other restaurants.   It's a reasonable priced entrees they offer. Some entrees were kind of a disappointment and most were not bad.

I've passed by this place for a few years and kept on driving by. Auspicious move. I tried out the cuisine. It's ok. Nothing to write home about. The chicken legs are kinda small and tastes ok but not very flavorful. The tripe is too syrupy for my taste. I am not sure they are supposed to have starch in them but here it is....starch. It's got some ginger in it but the tripe is limp and not crunchy. I like them with a bit of a small crunch to them. The char siu bao, or BBQ buns, are decent. I guess if you are too lazy to drive to Spring Mtn road and have a craving for dim sum then come here, else spend the extra 15 min and head east young man/woman.",

    "text": "Came here because of Yelp review.  Wanted Sunday dim sum. This review sticks to the dim sum and not the entrees.   No carts here, made to order.   Overall there are hits and misses.   Good: C2 shrimp har gow. B12 bean curd skin roll. This was probably the most satisfying dish.  B14 daikon cake (lobakow).  Good flavors. Fell apart easily so that means they didn't use a lot of fillers and binders.  B11 mushroom shumai.  This is borderline. It had good flavors but we only got two shitake mushrooms when the menu pic showed four, one for each meatball... The meatballs we're tasty. So I bumped it up from meh.  Meh: C16 BBQ pork rice noodles.  The pork lacked flavor and the skin texture is off.  C9 chive dumpling. My wife loves chives but it was a meh.  Note it has SHRIMP.  We told the server she is allergic to shrimp and was never told.  The earlier shrimp siao Mai was for me so we knew that had shrimp.   Ugly: G2 fried calamari.  Batter was THICK and it tasted like old oil was used.  Note we came in at the opening of the day. No excuse for old oil. I would avoid all fried food here based on that.   Price:. Typical pricing similar to what you find in LA Chinatown or Alhambra.  3 stars for meeting expectations and a fair price. Plus and minus for mixed quality. So net 3 stars for me.  If you stick to the better dishes you will be happy. So, ymwv.",

A party of 3 ordered: Beef fried rice $9.25, Snow pea leaves with garlic sauce $11.95, Chinese sausage bun (2) $3.50, Pork Shu Mai(3) $2.5, Chicken Shu Mai (3) $2.5,Steamed BBQ Pork Bun (3) $2.5, Coconut Roll (2) $2.5, Baked sweet cream bun (3) $2.5, 2 Steamed Pork spare ribs $3, Steamed Pork Dumpling (3) $3, Pork porridge with preserved egg $4  Taste: Hot, delicious, and fresh. Server recommended the snow pea leaves and they did not disappoint; I believe we will be ordering that from no won as our \"green\" for the table. Baked sweet cream bun were so good. Honestly, I could finish an entire order of 3 buns on my own.  Portions: Most dishes were portioned out for 3 pieces...perfect for a party of 3. Beef fried rice and Snow pea leaves were served family style & we were able to box up plenty to go.  Service: This was my first time ordering dim sum vs. stalking the rolling carts for specific foods. Our family size plates arrived first and were soon followed by all of our ordered dim sum in quick succession. It was nice having all of the food out on the table to choose from (as opposed to usual experiences where you are waiting on your proteins to pair up with your sides).  Menu: Well organized with prices listed. Also had a photo menu which made ordering easy, especially if you don't know what the dish is called or if you are feeling adventurous. Listing the dishes is also more food-allergy friendly. There was no question as to what each dish included (so I was able to keep my epi-pen stored).  Overall: I'll be back because Sundays are for Dim Sum & Dim Sum Cafe meets my needs.",

It's Wednesday night, I'd say Wednesday is a great night to go: our server was polite, sweet, lovely, wonderful, attentive everything you want in a server. I asked her when she works and she said she only works Wednesday nights! I'll post some pictures, the inside of the place is clean, pleasant. I like the blue colors. kids love the fish tanks, I wouldn't call it a \"wow\", but I would call it a nice clean place for family to eat. By the way, no alcohol service at all. So if you like wine or beer with your Chinese food, my suggestion is order for takeout. Especially liked the deep fried crab balls, and the salt-and-pepper shrimp!",

My husband and I were so extremely dissatisfied with the food here that we just paid our bill and left with most of the food untouched.  If you are looking for a good dimsum place check out the one inside the RIO hotel.  Promise you won't regret it.  Save your money,  don't go here.  You're welcome",

I was stunned that the portion was small. Plus the tasting was below ok. Compared to the food from this restaurant and other dim sum restaurant I usually go to in Las Vegas, the other Dim Sum restaurant is better.  I would recommend going somewhere else than this restaurant. The food has no flavor and seems the food was microwaved.",

Second every time I drive by there's hardly any cars there so with dim sum where it's usually high volume, how is it possible to serve fresh dim sum? They must be serving week old dim sum?  Well took the chance and as I walked in on a Sunday morning at 11:15 which would be prime time in spring mtn, I walked in to an empty restaurant.   We decided to give it a shot and ordered 6 items including steam beef tripe, ha gow, siu mai, pork steam noodle roll, congee, and steamed beef spareribs.  Other than the ha gow which was literally whole baby shrimp compressed together, everything else was pretty good.  My favorites were the steamed beef spares and the beef tripe.  Total was under 20 bucks and I left satisfied.  Maybe I went in with the absolute lowest expectations - that's prob it.  But if I'm in the area and want a quick dim sum fix and lazy to make the 10-12 min drive I'll come here.  When we left they did get 3 more tables and had 2 to-go orders so this place is managing to survive.   Give this place a shot if you've had the same skepticism.  It's decent.",

My favorite is the shrimp dumpling and chow fun. They have individual dish plates available (family style) as well as their dim sum dishes. It isn't traditional where waiters roll around a cart and ask you what you want, instead you just let your waiter know what you want, and they bring out the items to you. Portions are okay in my opinion. Although they have 3-4 pieces per bowl it actually adds up and satisfies you. Their menu is categorized by prices: cheapest to most expensive so it accommodates diners on a budget!",

It's a relatively new restaurant, but the reviews that I read we're encouraging. I especially liked the quick video clip made by the restaurant emphasizing the freshness of their Dim Sum, because they are made to order vs. sitting on a cart.   I came here on a Sunday with four other family members at around 11:30 AM. Parking was easy since they have a parking lot. We were greeted and seated immediately. The restaurant interior appeared modern, very spacious and clean. They even had two big flat screen TV's!   We ordered numerous Dim Sum dishes (including the usual Siu Mai & Har Gow). The dishes came out hot, freshly made and in a timely manner. We all felt that the dishes were delicious. We even had a separate order of Tomato Beef Chow Mein (Hong Kong style-crispy noodles). It was done right & it was flavorful. In talking with our waiter, he told us that they are affiliated with the popular Orchids Garden Restaurant. Even though Dim Sum Cafe is relatively new, I feel that they are worth a try...Check out the photos I posted.",

I highly recommend their seasonal snap pea leaves with garlic sauce! She recommended it and it was fantastic! We had the pork shumai, shrimp ball(with sugarcane), sweet rice cake, the dim sum noodles, Chinese broccoli, the snap pea leaves with garlic, beef broccoli, steamed shrimp dumplings and the mushroom/spinach steamed dumplings!!!! Yes, we over ordered but it was good leftovers!  Nice clean place with cute wall aquariums and clean bathrooms!!!!! Highly recommended and will return!!!",

    "text": "Ok so for being a dim sum lover I have to say this place kindda gives the main places a run for their money.   So it's not the biggest and busiest dim sum place but it was clean the people were nice and the food was GREAT!   To me when you go eat dim sum you want to experience the whole cart table service and crazy mad house atmosphere if it was your first time having dim sum ok, but if you just want some food and go about your day then this will satisfy your fix.   It's all about the food anyways and they have very good dim sum. The service was pretty fast and you order exactly what you want and it comes out all at the same time instead of waiting for a cart to come by so you can fight for what's left.   But here at Dim Sum Cafe you can choose from an awesome menu they have everything and then some just as good as a menu as the busy dim sum places if not better and the prices and portions are perfect.   All I have to say is that for an off the stripe local neighbor's location it was just the right place for me. You should totally try it because you won't be disappointed.",

The small fish tanks need to be removed strange power cord mess ( electrical hazard.) must be pain to keep the fish tanks cleaned. The entire space needs to be remodeled more OPEN would be nice.. Strange they have 30 security cameras inside and outside when the location is in Summerlin its NOT the ghetto... P.S. they do have a HELP wanted hand written sign posted on the front door if you want help them redesign and make it more open and friendly or maybe some super KUHL ASIAN FUSION DIM SUM...

There is a little wait depending on what you order but the food is good. My kids don't eat dimsum too often but they do like this place.

Of course I turned to Yelp and picked the closest 4 star to me, once again you all did not disappoint.   Stand outs: Soup dumplings, must try, they are smallish enough to pop in your mouth whole. Most places I have been to serve them much larger and accompanied by a soup spoon. I didn't mind being able to take them whole. Very good.  Curry cream cheese wontons, very very subtle curry taste which I appreciated because I wanted plain ones. Delicate, crispy, perfectly fried. Very good.  Chow mein, it was a nice accompaniment, solid choice.    Just oks The eggs rolls were ok, slightly undercooked for my personal taste. I'd get them again but ask for a bit well done.  Pork ribs my hubs loved, me not so much. If you like cartilage you will like them as there are bits of soft bone and gristle to work through. Similar in texture to chicken's feet. If that's your thing, rock in and order these. (They also have chicken feet FYI) The flavor of the meat was wonderful just not my preference.   Hard no Rice paper pork, no go for me. I don't like a slimy texture and even though it's normal for this dish I personally wouldn't order it again.   I'll be back to try their regular menu items as this review is strictly dim sum menu items. Thanks again friends!",

We were craving dim sum and the 30 minute drive across town to our usual spot didn't seem ideal, so we checked to see what was nearby and found this place in half the distance. SCORE!  But you know how they say, \"Stick to your bread and butter?\" Aka, stick to what you know?   Well... I don't want to completely bash this place. The location is convenient and near the freeway, and the venue itself has lots of seating, is very clean and is decorated well!   But at the end of the day, the food just didn't do it for us... at all. We ordered a handful of things from the menu (shrimp shumai, shrimp har gow, sharksfin dumpling, curry cream cheese wontons, baked sweet cream bun, etc), and while everything was presented well -- everything was \"just okay.\" It all really lacked flavor or just... wasn't good. We did NOT eat everything we had ordered AND we did NOT take it home (even though our server kept insisting we finish eating before she cleared the table).   Needless to say, we would rather do twice the travel time/distance to Orchid Garden and will not be returning here. Sorry!",

Overall, l had a very relaxed, nourishing, and comfortable dining experience - which was such a relief compared to the normal pressured hustle and bustle of other dim sum restaurants.  I really appreciated the quiet and calm atmosphere (it's simple and straight forward casual dining).    The servers were all friendly, patient, and kind.   The food arrived in great timing, a dish or two at a time, allowing me to enjoy hot fresh dim sum fro the whole dining experience.  My table was regularly bussed, and my server (Ryan) came to check on me just enough times throughout the meal.  He's an excellent waiter- he answered all my questions ( I have a very particular diet) and even recommended items that I might like based on my dietary restrictions.    This place is also vegetarian friendly!!   The mushroom dumpling, pan friend vegetable dumping, and stuffed eggplant were my favorite of all the dishes I tried.  I will definitely be back again, and soon.",

Then we ended up waiting for 15-20 minutes for our last dish after already finishing all our other dishes. We had to ask about the last dish a few times and even tried to cancel the order but was told \"it'll be right out\". It then took another 10 minutes to get the check. Overall, it seemed like they forgot about us.   Location: 4/5 - Parking wasn't an issue, though we did get there early. Restaurant was pretty clean.   Price: 4/5 - Total of $18 for 5 dishes. Pretty reasonably.   Overall: The food was great but ultimately the service ruined the experience for us.",

It's small on the inside and not traditional where you'd see a lady come up to you with a variety of foods from a cart where you can pick your dim sum from. Instead they provide a menu with pictures which was nice since we don't exactly know what we're getting when we do get dim sum from a cart anyway.   We choose quite a few dishes and I enjoyed most of them. We got the pork shumai, Steamed shrimp dumplings, shrimp hargow, pan fried chive dumplings, shrimp rice noodle, crab claws, sugar cane shrimp, and the waitress convinced us to try this snow peas vegetable.   Overall, I was full after all the things we ordered. My favorite was the crab claws. They come like the shrimp ball but on crab claws which is cool. The snow peas vegetable reminded me of the Chinese broccoli we usually get but without hoisin sauce. I'd come back to try other things on their menu in the future.",

If you go here you must get the chicken feet it is savory not sweet and had so much flavor. You also need to get the usual suspects: Pork Siu Mai, Shrimp Har Gow and Fried Taro. But some that stood out for us was the Steamed Pork Spareribs, Steamed Beef Tendon and the stuffed eggplant.  Lastly make sure you order the Baked Sweet Cream buns to go.",

Steamed bbq pork buns 5/5 these are a MUST! Super delicious! Mushroom spinach dumpling, 4/5, the wrapping was a little weird, but the filling was really good, I'd recommend it.

Let me start by fully admitting that I'm rating this as 5 stars relative to what options and pricing are available in the area.  Yes. I've had better dim sum & Chinese food in Alhambra (CA) and Vancouver. But let's be honest here. You're considering because you're in Summerlin and not planning on hopping on a plane to Hong Kong, Vancouver or even California.  I'm pleasantly surprised this little gem exists here in Summerlin. Staff is friendlier than most staff I'm used to seeing at dim sum restaurants and the taste and quality of food is better than the average dim sum place.  I've been here a total of 5 times. Sampled almost everything from their dim sum menu and it's all average to above average.  The best part is you can get dim sum even for dinner.  The only downside is the menu is pretty basic. The menu options are the typical choices non Chinese/Taiwanese people will order.  Also their dim sum menu has pictures so don't be afraid to come if you've never had dim sum.",

I live so close to this place and thought it could be a \"go-to.\" My husband and I dine out a lot and when we find somewhere we like we become frequent goers and loyal customers!   The service was ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. From the moment we walked through the door the middle aged man who sat us and waited on us was impolite. It didn't bother me at first. I considered it was due to a language or cultural barrier. Then I saw him interacting with an elderly couple who sat in the booth next to us. He wasn't exactly bubbly with them but he sure treated them with a lot more respect than he did us. The slightly younger gentlemen who looks like he might own the place, also began helping the couple next to us, asking them if he could get them hot sauce, soy sauce, etc. While our cups remained empty and no one ever returned to ask how we were doing or if we would like anything else, even though we kept the menu after our initial order and indicated that we would order more food as we went on.   The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the food wasn't terrible. It wasn't out of this world. It was... mediocre at best. Had our server returned to our table, I could've had more of a chance to judge the food. But so be it.   I was really hoping this would would be an amazing place!

Well I think the quality of the food makes up for all of that! Even the beef and broccoli off the regular menu was delish! Everything from the sauce for egg roll to the steamed pork buns and rice noodles was just so tasty. Some yelpers pointed out that most dim sum places have the food out on the cart so long that it's not really fresh and some are probably even microwaved. I totally agree with them and actually really enjoyed the made-to-order freshness of the food. Best Chinese food I've had in a while!",

I was a little doubtful about this as I'm a dim sum \"cart\" guy but I've now seen the light.  I highly recommend the fried chive dumplings. I've had these in plenty of places and this was the best I've had.  What makes this place such a good deal is the size of their portions along with quality. Most dishes come with 4 pieces instead of the standard 3. Much  better deal and flavor than Orchids which I consider to be massively overpriced and overrated.  Highly recommend the fried chive dumplings and the chicken baos. Actually all the baos were very good and a steal at $2.50 for 3. The seasonal snow pea \"leaves\" were excellent but a bit pricey for a vegetable dish. Very good though.  The shrimp har gow and siu mai were average to me although ymmv.  Restaurant was very nicely furnished and QUIET. If you go to regular dim sum places you'll know what I'm talking about. A bit out of the way in the very nice suburb of Summerlin.  My new must visit place when I'm in Vegas.",

They've focused more on their identity as a restaurant & got rid of the random menu that included burgers n such. So here's what to order:  The Chinese broccoli is a huge portion and worth the money. The leek dumplings, chive dumplings, & bbq meat pastries are pretty good. ALMOND COOKIES. Stay away from the sticky rice in lotus leaf and turnip cake. Definitely head to spring mountain for those.",

    "text": "Ok so it's been awhile since I've had dim sum and mainly because of my last experience years ago at a location in Chinatown, where all things that could go wrong....WENT WRONG. However, I've been wanting to find a place where people have loved and tried out before I went to one again and when a customer recommended I check this place out, I did so the very next day! The ambiance needs a little work.. booths and seat are outdated. The ceilings/roof tops are creative but fall short of reaching an actual design and the dinnerware and.tea cups needed to be washed again. So that's the bad now here's the good: place felt and smelled clean! The restrooms were amazingly clean and comfortable to be in your own individual stall and the design of it was so nice I wish they carried out the same flow into the restaurant but maybe somewhere down the line.. the food: BOMB!!! Clean, fresh, seasoned perfectly and delicious!!! Overall I gave it 5 stars because the good outweighed the bad and their service was attentive and pleasing! We will be back soon! Hopefully the decor will be updated? Lol",

    "text": "They have some things to work on, but I'm giving 5 stars because I've never gone to a dim sum place in town that I really wanted to go back to of my own free will.   First, a little history of my dim sum perspective. Since I was young I've gone to the best dim sum restaurants in San Francisco with my parents, and since coming to Las Vegas we've also tried practically every dim sum joint in town available. Cathay, KJ's in Rio, PingPangPong, Orchid's, Chang's.... The only time I go is when my parents are in town and it's all the same to me. The best communication is in Mandarin or a dialect, otherwise its pointing at things. There are a variety of dishes, lots of shrimp based things, many dishes are very salty, very heavy, very oily. I don't like any of those latter points.   I'm not saying that Dim Sum Cafe food is bland. Not at all! But in comparison to all the others, it is not so heavy that it makes me want to stop eating after a few tries. It also seems to be less oily and heavy than other places I've tried.   One big thing I really like is that you can order dim sum any time of the day and they make it to order so its hot and fresh, not on a cart for who knows how long. This does mean it will take a little bit for your food to come out, but it's worth the wait to me. I was initially a little wary since another review said it was a sister of Orchid Garden, who gave me cold dim sum so I never went back. Fortunately, nothing was cold, stale, or old here. The quality seems to be quite good, and everything tastes great.   There are some Chinese only speaking employees there, but they do their best and mean well. It did take a little while to be noticed and seated, and service seems a little bit slow depending on which server you get. It might be a little bit of language barrier, a little shortage of staff, a little less experience with customer service, but whatever it is a little training or hiring of experienced servers would smooth these bumps quickly.   For a Saturday night there were not many people there. I don't know if it was the location or that it's still a new place, but I hope they can make the right improvements and stay in business so that I can keep having dim sum that doesn't overwhelm me!",

    "text": "Why is everyone giving this place mediocre rating? Cause there are no carts?  I personally loved my dinner here at Dim Sum Cafe. I love the location! Not on busy Spring Mountain Rd! Finally, a close Dim Sum spot by my place. The servers were really nice, all of them smiling & very helpful.  You pretty much order all the Dim Sum you want on a menu. As hungry as I was, I wish the food came out quicker but I appreciate & love the fact that they cook it & the food is not simply sitting on a cart.  I thought the food was delicious too! Not bland at all & seasoning was just right. I think the bad reviews stems from people having delicious Dim Sum outside of Vegas but think about it, we really don't have an extensive list here in town in the first place. Honestly, I think this place is underrated. The atmosphere was nice, the lighting was bright, ambiance was welcoming, seats were comfortable, the whole place was clean.. & most importantly, the food was not bad at all.  Of course, if you want your food fast, then go to Orchid Garden or something. This is just a place I'd go to when I want good quality & clean Dim Sum without having to travel too far.",

    "text": "After reading others' reviews, my curiosity proceeds me.  A new restaurant needs more time to proof themselves.  Hence, I ordered a take out and check out their dinning area and exam the restroom as I awaited for my order.    1.  the bean curd skin roll     Rate: 1.5 Note: The bean curd skin roll tasted old- more of the boarder line spoilage taste.  2. Sticky rice       Rate:0 (yes, it's a zero star)  Note: The sticky rice had too little stuffings.  Most stuffings are pork fat with very little meat.  It has a very mild rotten meat kind of sourness taste which is rather unpleasant for me.    3. Shrimp dumpling      Rate: 3 Note:  it tasted average. Neither bad nor impressive!   Facilities:  Restroom  -5  The bathroom was dusty, things were broken everywhere. There were one missing light bulb, one broken paper towel feeder, one very dimes light bulb.  A very dusty soap bin and sink counter.   The sanitation standard is not up to my standard.  My biggest pet peeve for a restaurant is dirty restroom.  If they can't keep that room clean, their kitchen won't be any better.    Overall-I would give negative stars if allowed.    Sorry, I won't come back and strongly recommend others to think twice before coming here.",

We also ordered potstickers and shrimp sumai which my family said were delicious.  The restaurant was very clean and the bathrooms were very clean as well.

All the dishes we ordered (beef chow fun, har gow, steamed pork bun, baked custard bun, sticky rice in lotus leaf, fries taro dumpling) tasted as it traditionally should but was not as greasy, actually. If come again for dim sum fix in the neighborhood. The selection is pretty good but not as much as a trad tea house. For that I give 4 stars. Also, very reasonably priced.   Him: The chow fun tastes almost as good as my grandpa's. It's really good. It's kind of weird my mommy speaks Chinese to the waiters. They're from Hong Kong. The pork buns are good and different because the meat is not small and dry but chunky and juicy. I like the siu mai too because it was really meaty and juicy and not fatty. The bathrooms are so clean, I went twice. I faked it the first time to inspect and then the second because I really had to go. The sticky rice could have had more flavor but my favorite sausage (pork wine \"lop cherng\") was in there so that was good. Order the Siu Mai. Gets 4 stars because no carts of food for fast-eating like other dim sum places.",

    "text": "I live in the area and was excited when I saw a Dim Sum place opening up.  Sadly food is borderline inedible.    The Mushroom Shiu Mai....the mushroom it was served on couldn't be cut!  It acted like rubber.  You put a knife to it and it would retain it's shape once you lifted the knife from it.  I've never seen a mushroom do this.  Needed to make serious effort to cut through it.  I tried a small taste  and had to remove it from my mouth.    The shrimp dumplings/potsticker seemed old.   The shrimp in the dumpling was mushy and fell apart.  It was not seasoned and was bland.  Took one bite and left the rest.    The one cart of food they were selling looked old.  The egg rolls did not look like they were made in house.   When asked about some of the other dim sum on the menu the said that was made to order as it doesn't hold well.   Which gave me reason to believe the food on the cart wasn't made right away and looked its age.    The pork buns were \"OK\" nothing special.  Could use a bit more filling in the buns.    The Chicken dumplings were average.  They were actually the saving grace of the experience.   Found it odd you had to actually request the standard sauces that are served at normal dim sum places.   We had the hot mustard and the red chili.  Both sauces were good.    The ice tea was fresh......I wasn't offered a refill or asked if I wanted another drink.  I don't think the place will be there for long.",

You must go and try the Dim Sum, Shrimp fried rice, Mongolian Beef, Eggplant, vegetable egg rolls, etc Great service and Outstanding fresh ingredients = a great dining experience  I have to add to this review. Everything is fresh and delicious. You can carry out or eat in. You must try this restaurant",

Not something I'm used to at a busy Chinese restaurant.  We came on a Monday morning and had to order dimsum a la carte, which is fine. I thought their dimsum pastries were absolutely delicious. But the meat dishes (i.e. har gow, xiu mai) were rather disappointing. Their prices were higher compared to what I'm used to in Chinatown.  Clean place. Quick service. Lovable servers. Delicious pastries. Ok prices. Disappointing dim sum.  I'd still come back though cause there's many other things on their menu to try aside from dim sum.",

We ordered baked bao and after a half hour wait, told the waiter to cancel it since we were done with our meal. When he settled the bill, the brought us the order, on the house!  definite should try spot",

We started off with the lunch menu egg dlop soup. Total crap. I put some soy sauce in it to perhaps add some flavor to no avail. No one at the table ate all of theirs. I had Orange Chicken -oh joy! There was so much breading on it that it resembled a walnut, and as hard also. The orange sauce was mediocre also. My wife had sweet and sour chicken. It came with an egg roll(eh!) and egg fried rice. Since the fried rice was tasteless she asked the server if she could exchange it for steamed rice. The server's reply,\"Why you no tell me before\"? (well, basically because she didn't know that your fried rice sucked). No comments from my friends on their meals. On the positive side, the prices were inexpensive and the place was absolutely spotless. But, lousy food and an unfriendly server earned it a well deserved 1 star.",

Do we look like we were done eating in?) at the same time, she was looking out the window (idk why) while we ordered. I had to ask her if was ok & got our order.    Food: mediocre. 3 of the food we wanted for dim sum were not available (out of stock). Then why have it on the menu or better yet, mark it unavailable or let the customers know what you don't have that's in the menu. Their fried shrimp was waaay too salty, pork buns hardly had any pork (all buns), the sugarcane shrimp just fried shrimp with a stick of sugarcane in it (nothing special in taste).   I guess people come here to beat going to China Town for a decent dim sum. Would I recommend? NO!",

It is located on Twain and Hualapai in South Summerlin area.  The place is clean and laid back. There is no steam carts rolling around but your food is made fresh to order.   My favorite in order are:  Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf $4.50 Sharkfin Dumplings $$3 Red Bean Sesame Ball $2.50 Steamed chicken feet $3 Steamed Beef Tendon $3.50 Pork Porridge $4 Fried Smelt $6.50 Fried Chicken wings $6.50  The service is great, and they speak pretty good English :) The food is fresh and up to par. Just a couple of plates were flavorless and you need to add chilli sauce or soy sauce.  The prices is a few cents more like 20c-30c more compared to the Dim sum restaurants in Chinatown, but to avoid going that far with busy traffic, parking hassle, I prefer to come here.",

The interiors is a little bit off for me, having the blue color motif is something I've never seen in any Chinese restaurant here or in other countries.

Also I actually prefer ordering from menu over choosing from carts - I know what I'll get, and they are made fresh from kitchen.  Steamed Chicken Feet (5/5): Up to now, this is the best steamed chicken feet I've ever had. I've lived in Hong Kong for years and went to yum cha on weekly basis - so I really mean it when saying \"it's the best\". A little bit of spiciness made it stand out from other mediocre chicken feet.  Fried Taro (4.5/5): I like both crispy coating and the stuffing. The size is also reasonable - I don't like huge fried taros that take up too much space in my stomach.  Baked BBQ Pork Pie (4/5): Definitely nothing to complain on this one.   Mushroom Dumplings (4/5): Savory. It fulfilled everything I'd expect from a mushroom dish, and the little dumplings are really cute. Glad that server recommended this to us.  Stuffed Mushroom (2/5): It's a disappointment as the stuffed mushroom came bland and greasy. Somehow I feel these small mushrooms aren't the best choice for stuffed dish, unless the stuffing is very well-seasoned.  Beef Rice Noodle (2/5): There was too little beef - even though rice noodle was very smooth and moist, I didn't really like the dish overall.   Steamed Beef Tendon (1.5/5): Tendon failed to absorb in seasonings, making it very tasteless.  Service was quick and attentive. Will definitely come back again to try other items!",

But again, service was slow for ordering and food to come out. What made it worse was my friend finding a piece of hair in their shrimp har gow. There was another similar post about someone finding a hair in their order as well. Hence they literally should call it shrimp HAIR gow. By then we were turned off by it because we did order 2 orders of it. So patrons, beware of ordering that. Other then that, probably wouldn't go back. Their salt and pepper pork chop sucked but everything else like siu mai and chicken feet was ok in my opinion.",

I will start by saying the service isn't the best, but it is not the worst service ever. We are always seated immediately.  We have tried a variety of dishes including; steamed pork dumplings, steamed BBQ pork buns, curry cream cheese wonton, fried taro, and baked egg tart.  Of the dishes we tried, there were only 2 that were misses. The curry cream cheese wonton just wasn't what I was expecting, it definitely had the curry taste so if you like curry it is worth trying. The fried taro had meat in it, which we just weren't prepared for.  Now for the hits! The steamed pork dumplings are AH-MAZING! I call them soup dumplings. They have a little bit of broth on the inside and are served piping hot so proceed with caution. They are bite size if you are daring, like me. It is perfectly seasoned and does not require dipping in soy sauce.  The egg tarts are flaky and full of flavor. I easily eat an entire order by myself.  The steamed BBQ pork buns are soft, filled with meat, and delicious! My boyfriend loves them so much he requested to come back the next day. We loved the dumplings and buns so much that we went back 3 days in a row. Everything we have tried was served hot. The food is delicious and the price is definitely worth it.  Bottom line: Test out your chopstick skills and scoop up some of their steamed pork dumplings!",

    "text": "You won't find dimsum in carts here but Dim Sum Cafe has good dimsum and more!  We especially like the chiu chao style dumpling, sticky rice in lotus leaf and the chicken feet.  We were also happily surprised to find Bitter Melon with Beef -- tender and tasty beef with thinly sliced bittermelon in black bean sauce!  We will also order again the Singapore Noodles.  There are other dimsum items we would like to try next time.  What we would not order again:  Stuffed Mushrooms and Stuffed Eggplant.  Good service, spacious and nice ambiance but if the Dim Sum Cafe management is reading this, please turn on the airconditioning much earlier.  We came in shortly after 11:00 yesterday, it was 103 degrees outside and it was not cool enough inside the restaurant.  We left shortly around 12:15 pm and it was still not really cool... and we were not the only customers who had asked about the airconditioning.  We were told they had just opened and so the airconditioning was just turned on.  This is not acceptable.  Good food and nice ambiance inside the restaurant but we would have enjoyed it better if it had been cooler inside.",

    "text": "Quick synopsis: Not as bad as people first thought when they opened, but not as good as dim sum restaurants in Chinatown (yet).  I can't even remember what this location was before it was Dim Sum Cafe, but I eagerly waited their opening. With the bad reviews coming out as soon as they opened, I decided to hold off coming here until they could find their groove. I finally paid a visit here last weekend. The restaurant is clean and spacious, but the table tops are a bit bare for a dim sum place. If you want soy sauce or any other of the condiments like hot sauce you normally see at a dim sum restaurant, you have to ask your server to bring you some.   As far as the food, it satisfies the craving for dim sum, without having to drive all the way down to Chinatown from the westside. Their fried rice is a small serving for the price, but has good flavor and is enough for 2 people. My husband enjoyed their fried shrimp balls, which came with a generous serving of mayo. The filling for the stuffed eggplants was tasty, but the skin on the eggplant was tough and inedible. Baked BBQ pork buns weren't too flavorful and lacked filling. Pork suimai  had melt-in-your mouth meat, but the wrapping fell apart when trying to get it out of the container. Unfortunately they were out of the baked cream buns, so I'll at least be back to try those out. Service was very attentive and my water never went unfilled. Menu shows that charge for hot tea, but we actually were not charged for, which I appreciate. I think this place will continue to learn from it's mistakes and get better.",

    "text": "Every once in a while.... like once a week, I get a hankering for some dim sum! I didn't want to drive across town and was hoping there was something nearby when I remembered there was Dim Sum Cafe a few minutes away. Perfect!   Upon arrival, the restaurant was clean and tidy. There were about 5 people dining in, which I thought seemed normal since it was 7pm and dim sum is usually enjoyed as a breakfast food. We were seated promptly and were handed menus as the server took our drinks. I love the fact that the menu included pictures of the dim sum to make it easier to order. Upon review, here's is all we ordered:  1. Rice noodle roll 2. Pork shiu mai 3. Shrimp shiu mai 4. BBQ pork bun 5. Sweet rice cake  6. Shrimp har gow  7. Chive dumpling 8. Cream cheese curry wonton  9. Daikon cake 10. Beef tendon (we never received).   Alrighty, here it goes... 1. The rice noodle roll came in hot, as well as all the dishes. It was served with a tasty soy like sauce, but not as salty. There were small chunks of BBQ pork throughout the entire roll. Not my fave.. it tasted a bit bland and somewhat watery. I'd probably enjoy it more if it had a stronger pork flavor.  2. Pork shiu mai was hot and juicy. Nice delicate flavor, but again was a bit bland.  3. Shrimp shiu mai was also juicy with a nice shrimp flavor, but once again bland.. see where this is going yet? 4. BBQ pork bun was fluffy and full of flavor but nothing special since it tasted like most pork buns I've had. I just wish there was a bit more filling. 5. Sweet rice cake was fluffy, moist, and sweet. Perfect as a dessert. 6. Shrimp har gow was ok. In need of salt and was overpowered by the dumpling wrapper. Tasted a bit watery as well.  7. Chive dumpling was my favorite of all the dishes! Pan fried on both sides and gave a nice crunch when bit into it. The dumpling didn't need any sauce to go with it since it was delicious on its own. A word of advice... let all your dumplings cool down!!! They are hotter than the devils ass! 8. Cream cheese curry wonton was pretty good. Pretty simple and the curry wasn't too over powering. 9. Daikon cake was nice and crispy on both sides. It gave a nice crunch but was a bit too soft, almost runny on the inside. It was ok.  10. Beef tendon... we actually didn't receive it.   All in all, Dim Sum Cafe was just ok to me, nothing special, and definitely not better than KJ kitchen at the rio. I left full, but not satisfied as I had anticipated. The only reason I gave 3 stars and not 2 was due to the tasty chive dumplings, pork shiu mai, and pork buns, and friendliness of the staff as well as the cleanliness. I hope to be back one day, since I like to give restaurants a second chance especially since this place has such great reviews!!! Maybe it's just me or perhaps it was an off day for them. Regardless, I can't wait to return in hopes of giving them 5 stars!!!",

The Shrimp Har Gow is steamed and really shrimpy, if that makes sense?  It's not gross if you like the taste of shrimp like me!  The Sesame Chicken was recommended by the person taking our order over the phone and it is a good amount of crispy and saucy- the sauce has good flavor, too.  Unfortunately, the BBQ buns have a lot of breading (like 3/4 of an inch thick) and not a lot of filling.  That's too bad because the filling is the best part!    I'll definitely order from Dim Sum Cafe again, especially because they are so fast!  The delivery guy also said, \"Enjoy your food\" which was friendly, too.  When you're giving your order over the phone, they're very friendly and helpful (I wasn't sure what to ask for when trying to order shrimp dumplings).  Thanks for great service!",

We were in town for 6 days.  3 visits were warranted.  This is order dim sum so everything is piping hot.  The holy trinity of har gaw, shui mai, and cha siu bao more than passed the test.  The cha siu so (baked  bbq pork pastry), the stuffed eggplant, and the pan seared chive dumpling had to be repeated at each visit.  We managed to crow bar Singapore  Noodles in, too.  Like being home.   Friendly staff (we ordered a type of tea not on the menu and they didn't blink). Clean place.  You can spend hours there sipping tea and ordering as the fancy strikes.  Our son lives in Vegas.  We now have 2 reasons to make the trip.",

I highly doubt they will ever be on dirty dining unlike those other Chinese restaurants on Spring Mountain. They have excellent and quick service.  The ambiance is relaxing with real fish tanks and the sound of running water. There are also TVs and daily food specials . Overall, this is a great place to eat and hang out.",

The service we received was prompt and friendly.  Our food came out in a timely fashion...and it was very tasty.  I typically dont care for egg drop soup, but it came with the lunch special, so I tasted it...then I finished the whole bowl.  The broth was delicious.  The egg roll was super good and the amount of chicken lo mein was enough for two meals, which I did take home....because it was totally worth eating a second time.   We also had the bbq pork buns, they werent the best ive ever had...but still worth eating and enjoying.  I will be back again...I hope its just as good.",

Everything from egg tarts, har gow (steamed shrimp dumplings), stir fry, fried rice, red bean paste deep fried pastry and all the regular dishes u would get at a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown is well executed. A no frills, clean, nice ambience ( for an Asian diner ) and surprisingly good service for an Asian place. Prices are aok (I.e. Higher than Chinatown but its in summerlin so it is on pricey side). It's a keeper and my favorite local go-to place for a good Chinese meal. As a frame of reference for this eval, me and my family have lived in Hong Kong, Thailand, Sydney, New York City and lived/traveled around the world (including China, Singapore, Vietnam - so we have sophisticated taste buds, and know a good honest Chinese eatery when we experience one. Hope this place is here to stay. Highly recommend.",

I recommend this place to people who enjoy Chinese food with less sodium. However, if you are like me and enjoy food with flavor, unfortunately I do not recommend Dim Sum Cafe. The Shrimp Har Gow was flavorless and small. The Combo Fried Rice taste was plain, its meat and seafood lacked flavor. The Pan Fried Chive Dumpling lacked garlic. The Chiu Chow style dumpling, I'm sorry, was disgusting and tasted like throw up. The deep fried Shrimp looked bigger in the photo. FYI the shrimp was the size of a dime. The Honey Walnut Shrimp was okay because the walnuts were coated and crunchy, and the shrimp was pretty good, not over cooked, did not drown in the sweet sauce, and about the size of a half dollar coin. The War Wonton soup was the main reason why I wanted to go to Dim Sum cafe, but I was fairly disappointed. It lacked what the other dishes lacked.....Flavor. Salt, pepper, and soy sauce can only help a little. There was no garlic, herbs, onion, etc...nothing to boost the flavor of their dishes.",

I like carts for dim sum, but that seemed unnecessary with less people at our table. Since you order from a menu, and the dishes take a little time to come out, I would guess this place could be slow when more crowded. The plus side is most of the dishes were really hot when brought to the table, however. The taro puff was nice and crispy, unlike other places where it can be soggy and cold. Daikon cake and egg rolls were also good. Pork shumai wasn't bad. Baked cream buns were also good, as usual. The egg tarts were probably the most disappointing dish we got in that the crust wasn't great. Not the best dim sum ever, but also not the worst. The food overall was good, standard dim sum fare. I'd return again if looking to go on a less popular time and craving dim sum!",

We ordered to go: shrimp siomai, pan fried chives, chicken feet and baked cream bun.   shrimp siomai - wish I got the pork one instead. This one had a bread-like texture, kind of rubbery chive dumpling - just okay. The best among the other stuff we ordered. chicken feet - good.  baked cream bun - had high expectations on this one!

They bring out the items as you order  * Price: Same as other dim sum places. One major pro, their menu shows the items w/ their price!!!! Most dim sum places don't show this, which results in a surprisingly high bill.. That's not the case here! You know exactly how much your bill will be before you get your check.  * Customer service: Their servers & employees are a lot more nicer & polite compared to other Chinese restaurants, so that's a major pro!",

The food was tasty and the service was mediocre (there were 4 of us including 2 kids), but decided to give it another shot because the food was good. The second time i brought more people, and the service was worse than before. The food is good...once they bring it. It seems like the service isn't as good as other dim sum places I've been to around here. MY favorite items are the pork buns, sugar cane shrimp, and dumplings....which is what i normally get at all other dim sum cafes. Nothing special about this one. I probably won't be back to this dim sum restaurant in vegas. There are tons more here!",

    "text": "The good: Wide variety of dim sum and regular menu  The bad: The food was barely average Service was horrible  The Skinny: I'm not coming back unless someone threatens me and pays  I was in town for business and this was close by.  I love dim sum, and have eaten lots of it, In Chinatown in LA, San Francisco, Oakland, and Hong Kong, Monterey Park, Montreal, NYC, and elsewhere.  I only ordered 3 items because I thought it would take less time and I can keep my weight under control.  Sadly, after taking my order, and bringing the mediocre pork sui mai within minutes, it took another 18 minutes for the to bring the Chinese Broccoli and the cold rice cake the probably bought somewhere else, like so many dim sum place.  In fact, I work with warehouses that tell me that they sell a lot of pre-made FROZEN dim sum sold to dim sum restaurants.  So, unless you see them preparing their stuff, you can't be sure if it's pre-made.  Not necessarily always bad, but I love open kitchen and places where you know they don't just heat their stuff and sell it, like with many restaurant appetizers.    One reason I prefer the dim sum places with carts is that they usually have stuff taken warm from the steamer.  Here you order from a menu.   I LOVE warm sweet rice cake when it is soft and gooey, with the right amount of sweetness.  Their rice cake was hard at the edges, and had the texture of cardboard.  Had it been steamed, even if purchased elsewhere, it would've been better.  Their Chinese Broccoli (gai lan) was warm, not overly cooked, and good, but they serve it with oyster sauce - I prefer plum sauce.  The reason for two stars?  I asked for my bill 3 times.  They didn't refill my coke until after they brought my bill. Finally the third time my bill of $14 was brought out after 5 minutes. Total time in the restaurant - 1 hour for 3 items.    I have not given two stars in over a year, and I eat out several times mid week and 3 time on weekends.",

The dim sum is available all day, every day, and made to order rather than served on carts- having the large selection is nice but it would be cool to see carts on weekends or during their busier times, it's part of the experience!  We ordered a ridiculous amount of food- dumplings for days, several types of shumai, rice noodle, stuffed eggplant and peppers, pork buns, egg tarts, and even fried smelt, which I haven't seen many places in town. The food was served as ready, hot and fresh, and was well made. I really liked their house-made chili oil on the table, which I added to almost everything. The staff were good about keeping up with our orders and drinks, and were able to provide suggestions for a couple ladies with dietary restrictions. Also, the pricing was great: under $20/pp including tax and tip (mandatory group rate) for a huge amount of food.   Despite the name, they also offer a large regular menu of soup, noodle, and entrees dishes, if you're there solo or wanting something different. They also do phone-in orders or advance ordering through their website.",

I have eaten dim sum all over the U.S., and in HK, and I consider myself a qualified dim sum foodie.  I ordered four different items off the dim sum menu and found all 4 items (baked cha shui bao, pork shu mai, cha shui flat noodles, and 1/4 of a roast duck) to be bland and reheated.  There was little taste to any of the items, and other than the shui mai, the food was lukewarm.  The duck was clearly reheated and dried out.  The service was slow and inattentive.   I had to ask for a server to take my food order.  I truly don't know how this restaurant got a 4 Star rating.  Truly, something is not right.",

The complimentary hot tea that I drop a packet of sweet n low into brings me bask to Chinese restaurants on the east coast. They have a \"regular\" more Chinese American menu as well with lunch specials. The soups are good but usually need a little salt to help them out.  Service is shoddy depending on how busy they are. Sometimes it's nice and attentive and sometimes I feel ignored. The restaurant itself is pretty clean and the prices are very reasonable.

My boyfriend always gets the General Tso's chicken and the Singapore Street Noodles.  It's probably for the best that we don't live near this place. I'd be there all the time.",

Here it is: I was in a huge hurry and started getting HANGRY around 1:10 and I had an appointment at 1:30... saw this place, popped in and no kidding... great grub, super fast (if you need them to be).  Looking over the lunch menu, it was all excellent choices and when my food arrived at my booth (super fast I'll add) it was perfect!   Service: Outstanding Food: Excellent (both choices and taste)  Price: Super Reasonable   I left VERY SATISFIED and I'm actually meeting a friend for lunch today and we picked this place because it's perfectly located in the middle for both of us to get to. I'm looking forward to taking a little more time and relaxing while I have lunch today!   Thanks guys! You've nailed it on all points",

I love dim sum growing up in California and even though Las Vegas has so many restaurants and places to eat there has always been limited spots for dim sum. I enjoy not having to go to Chinatown or the strip to find good dim sum. Great variety from pork shu mai to bbq pork buns. When you're here, you expect people to be pushing the carts of dim sum to each table but they do not do that here. They bring out from the kitchen always seems hot and fresh. They also have great lunch specials. Service is good. Everything seems reasonably price and we definitely will continue to be regulars!",

Baked Honey Glazed BBQ Bun: I LOVED these! They came out fresh from the oven. Warm, super soft and the perfect ratio of filling to bun. The BBQ pork wasn't fatty or oozy and had excellent flavor. I had to order a few to take home to share.  Har Gow: I liked them. Ok they might not be the traditional dim sumy kind but 2 orders of them (4 pieces/order) found their way into my tummy.  Sweet Rice Cake (honeycomb cake). I felt like a kid going to the Bakery in Chinatown with my parents. I haven't been able to find these cakes and it was exactly the way I remember. Slightly sweet, glutinous honeycomb, bouncy texture with a hint of fermentation. I love that my daughter got to try it and likes it as much as I do.  I'm giving 4 stars to encourage my Yelpers to give them a shot. It's nice having a dim sum place near school outside of Spring Mountain. Dim Sum Cafe definitely \"touched my heart\".",

Unlike lame tapas places where you order something delicious for $8 and you only get 2 small bites, these portions are much better and each one could be a satiating snack in itself.   I kind of went nuts and ordered more than I could eat but it was worth it: Fried Shrimp Ball, Pan Fried Chive Dumpling, Stuffed Eggplant, Baked BBQ Pork Pie, & Chicken Shu Mai. I liked the Chive dumpling and BBQ Pork Pie the best. The crust around the pork on those is pretty weighty and dense so they'll fill you up. Delicious!",

You order off the menu and the food comes to you instead of food carts moving around and picking out what you like.. Food was amazing tho.. Very flavorful and fulfilling..   Service was ok.. It started out great with a guy being polite and answering all of our questions.. And getting us everything we wanted.. Until a lady started cleaning our table at the end.. I was disappointed at the fact that the lady didn't ask if we were done with our food yet because I wasn't.. And she started clearing our table and I was felt that we were being rushed out.. I wasn't done drinking my tea and she already took the tea pot away when there was still a lot of tea left.. and the worst part.. she just stood there about a few away from my table and stared at us making it really uncomfortable..  Thanks for the experience of how rude and awkward this place can get..",

I'm gonna start picking my servers like gladiators from now on. There's an older south East Asian lady that won't stop talking and the stuff she comes out with is just plain old awkward. She once stood at the end of the table telling everyone how I looked Chinese. I'm European. I think she meant the way I used chopsticks but like I said, you could hear crickets. There's an older south Asian guy that works on the floor too; he just comes across like he's really unenthused to be there, you have to wave him over constantly and he's the reason I'm writing this review.  The owner and his sons are really friendly and hospitable but between the rest of the people working there it's a real crap shoot.

Our waitress, however, is the reason why I took out two stars. After a few orders, she stood there and pretty much watched us eat. That was awkward! The worse part is, she took our plates and utensils even if we still had food on our plates! And as she took our plates away, she didn't ask if we wanted to order more or if we were done. She took them, went to the back and then came back and stood there and watched us again. Creeper status. Lol. I was still hungry so I waved and told her I wanted to order more. At this point, my husband had lost his appetite and wanted to leave. I had just a few more bites after my last order came out and asked for the rest in a take-out plate. Regardless of the service though, I may consider coming back. Just hope we don't experience the same situation again. It's hard to enjoy your food if someone's watching your every move.",

They have pretty much all of the popular dim sum dishes and they also have a Chinese main menu and Chinese traditional dishes menu. Service is always fast and friendly. The prices are great and they accommodate take out orders~   The only thing that I've recently noticed that needs to be fixed ASAP are the steamed dim sum dishes. They keep coming out over steamed and way too soft... Ugh. Hopefully they fix this.   HOT TIP: Look at their daily specials board! Some times they have discounted dim sum...

The BBQ pork buns, the pastry had a strange taste.  And last but not least the straight up disgusting shrimp roll.  I can't even describe the strange starchy texture of the exterior or the off putting shrimp inside.  Eek, this was just a hot mess.  We left a little queasy in the stomach.  The atmosphere is pretty sad feeling as well, think old struggling diner.  If your Chinese, you probably will not enjoy your meal here.

    "text": "Dim Sum is my jam. But after living near NYC and London Chinatowns, I've developed a picky palette for places elsewhere. I like this place for its clean open atmosphere and for its fresh servings.  The ordering style does not involve chasing carts, but more like choosing tapas off a menu so food is made to order and therefore steaming hot when it gets to you. Har Gow (shrimp dumpling) was done right, and any dishes with buns were meaty and surprisingly very fresh! The pan fried chive dumpling is a popular pick, but it wasn't my favorite - too oily and average.   Dishes are reasonably priced IMO, making this cafe a hidden gem. Service is friendly but may be a bit pushy/influential? - if you know what you want, order it. I've only had Dim Sum when making a visit, but they have a full menu of Asian entree dishes - including lunch specials from 11am-3pm.",

I can see where some of the meh reviews on certain dishes might come from but this place does my favorites right! See below for more details.   Har Gao - always freshly cooked, filling is flavorful but mild if that makes sense, wrapping is chewy and wonderful.  Shrimp Ball - Wonderfully crispy exterior and delicious filling inside. Possibly one of the tastiest things on the menu.   Red Bean Sesame Ball - Has the perfect texture of crunchy as you bite in then chewy, then soft red bean filling. I've ordered this every single time and it's consistently good. Red bean not as sweet as others I've had, but overall still great.  Pork ribs - Tender and savory. I would say the sauce is a little thin, or I've had it with a bit more flavor at other places, but it still hits the spot.   Stuffed Eggplant - Again the shrimp was very tasty and the eggplant was cooked really well. It was a little oily, but the flavor was there.",

    "text": "After reading negative reviews on yelp, I was hesitant to give this place a try. I was craving for dim sum and was going solo. Didn't want to go to my usuals (Orchard Gardens and Ping Pang Pong) by myself.  I do not eat much and it would be awkward with few items on my table.  Anyhow, let's get on with my review for this place. I liked it. Due to all the low reviews I made sure to pay attention to customer service, timeliness, food quality, inspection of all items to make sure no hair or unwanted objects.   Most of the servers were attentive and came  by to check on me. One did not, she would pass by and twice I had to stop her. Once to take my orders. she amazingly memorized all 8 items without writing it down. 2nd time, I was sitting back, plates pushed away and again had to stop her as she slowly walked by to ask for to-go boxes and the check.   Food came out fast enough, one or 2 items at a time, no more than 5 mins apart.  Many of the items I've ordered all tasted good, except for the egg drop soup which was bland. Nothing that can't be fixed with salts.   My orders, listing them in the orders it came out:  Egg drop soup $2.50 (bland) White rice $1 (perfect, not too dry or too sticky) beef tripe $3 (crunchy and very tasty) Chinese broccoli $4.50 (oyster sauce to dip) Chicken feet $3 (my favorite) Shrimp fun roll $3.50 (okay) Tofu shrimp paste $3 (good) Tofu in ginger syrup $3 (okay)  I will certainly be back when I get the cravings and not going in a group.",

Always arrived at our table with a smile. Really made us feel welcome. I was surprised to see some reviews complaining about the service.  We ordered a number of staples. For the first time in my life, I did not order har gow in a dim sum restaurant.  Saw there were mixed reviews.  We liked the beef tendon, taro ball, pork shu mai, fried smelts,  pan fried chive dumpling,  stuffed eggplant, baked sweet cream bun and other dimsum. Also ordered pork belly with preserved vegetables which was very good. Got a beer which was ice cold, good sign! As there was only 3 of us, there was only so much we could try.   While it may not be the best dimsum we ever had, it was pretty decent. We thought the prices were great!  Will definitely be back.",

All the dim sum I ordered was flavorful and the prices are great! Most of the dim sum plates usually range from $2.50-$6.50 which is cheaper than other places. The only thing I wish they would work on is having one waitor/waitress for a certain section. We came across 3 different staff members bringing our food or asking us if we've ordered or wanted to order more. Service itself was just okay. Sometimes it was hard to flag down a staff member. Other than that, the place is clean and lots of people go there especially during lunch time. They also have lunch specials for $7.25. I'd definitely come back!",

It is overwhelmingly middle of the road and straightforward.  It is dim sum.  In a cafe.   After weeks of being pestered to go to dim sum, I finally caved.  Ended up ordering the following: -Shrimp har gow -Shrimp shu mai -Chicken feet  -Sticky rice in lotus leaf -Chinese broccoli  -Combination HK style chowmein -Calamari  While everything tasted fresh and well prepared, it lacked...umami.  Nothing about the meal was particularly inspiring.  My companion and I both agreed that there could have been a more generous treatment of salt across the board.  The most delicious thing ended up being the chowmein, which still needed a bit of soy sauce and chili to really hit the spot.  The only thing we both concluded was adequately seasoned as-is was the calamari.   Both the har gow & shu mai ended up being a bit dense and bland.  The chicken feet was under-rendered and gelatinous and the sticky rice didn't quite impress.    This dim sum cafe did have a few highlights however- the service is attentive and efficient and the interior is clean and tidy.    Maybe I've been spoiled by mind-blowing Dim Sum in San Francisco and elsewhere, but I would really only recommend this place if you're looking for dim sum you can get, and forget.",

Last time they were unfortunately out of the crab claw, but hopefully it will be back next time I visit.

    "text": "Came here for brunch after playing tennis with some friends on Sunday afternoon. I was originally planning on eating at Costco since i needed to go there for grocery shopping but since this was also on the way from the park, i decided to go with them to lunch  Apparently my friend and his family likes coming here periodically after church for dim sum  Im pretty sure i had heard about this before but was quite skeptical on how it would be.   Located just south of Hualapai and Twain, it is the last place i'd expect a dim sum place to be (considering everything else is more towards the strip or at chinatown)  Quite the large restaurant and we were sat at a large table immediately after entering. Granted it was 3pm on a Sunday afternoon, I didn't expect it to be busy. There were a few other tables of people which was mildly surprising as well  The pros already, the price doesn't change after a certain time, like some other places in town who offer \"all day dim sum\".   Price ranges from $2.50 up to $6.95 but most of the stuff you'll most likely be ordering are in the $3 range.   My friend did most of the ordering since they come here often and i assumed they had a \"set order\". My other friend and I just added to the order.   $2.50 2x Steamed BBQ Pork Bun () - my friend's older son favorite. im sure he had 3 himself. LOL he couldn't wait for the buns to cool down so he threw a small fit when he couldn't grab it because it was hot  2x Deep Fried Meat Ball () - they didnt cut it in half. Maybe they forgot. Was ok. Could have been hotter? Flavor was a bit lacking in the filling.   $3.00 4x Pork Shu Mai () - decent. not stiff like some could be.  2x Chicken Shu Mai () - decent. not preferred of the two.   $3.50 2x Shrimp Har Gao () - flavor was decent. shrimp was decent. the skin either was because it was frozen previously or oversteamed. Falls apart 2x Pan Fried Chive Dumpling - surprisingly this was really good. Probably my favorite out of all the items ordered. Came out SUPER hot !  2x Shrimp in Rice Noodle Roll ()- like the har gao, the noodle aspect falls apart. unknown if its because may it was previously frozen, or maybe over-steamed 2x Chinese Sausage Bun - seriously? LOL i guess i cant judge considering i grew up with similar. Didn't get to try this as i was quite full LOL  $4 2x Pork Porridge w/ Preserved Egg - Pork and egg was quite diced in small pieces. Flavor was decent. Rice was bloomed. Not as thick as i prefer though.   Friend had ordered a Thai Iced Tea, which was very surprising when it was brought to us. Apparently its served in a clear to blue gradient cup, so we thought they put something blue in the drink. LOL   Apparently experiences may differ. Had a friend who mentioned ridiculous wait times. Another person mentioned horrible tasting food. One who loves coming here and has been coming here often. SHRUGS.. YMMV LOL   They were pretty attentive for our table during entire visit. Quite friendly as well. Kept our waters filled (quite dehydrated after tennis lol)   Overall, quite the decent experience. LOVE that this is so close to home. Mildly dangerous actually. I kind of want to try their \"salted fish and chicken fried rice\" but at like $11, mildly hesitant.",

    "text": "This place is super convenient if you live in the spring valley area and don't want to travel to china town or the strip to get some good dim sum. I liked that there wasn't a long wait at all even though it was during peak hours. The service was friendly, but a bit slow in the beginning to get our first round of dishes out since the waiters don't walk around with ready to made dishes to order.   Among my partner and I, we ordered a large variety of dim sum dishes. I really like that they have a special dim sum menu which includes pictures for not as experienced Chinese eaters like myself. They offer most of the basics when it comes to dim sum, but I was a little disappointed to not see xiao long bao or sweet egg buns (some of my favorites), however they do offer alternatives like the pork dumpling.   The Pork Shumai and Chicken Shumai were very flavorful and didn't need any sauce to pair with it. The Steamed Beef Tripe was among the best I've had because of the flavor they infused in the dish. I also really liked the Shrimp Har Gow, Pan Fried Chive Dumpling, BBQ Pork Bun, and Beef Rice Noodle (which came with a yummy sauce). I loved their Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf and the Chow Mein which came with a generous serving. Lastly to the Egg Tart Bun for dessert, it was so delicious. The pastry was extra flakey and buttery and the egg was smooth and sweet.   I think this place is 5 stars because i have no complaints after leaving here. Convenient and casual, this place sure knows how to satisfy a dim sum craving!",

The staff was friendly and attentive except for when I wanted to order. Then again, don't think I waited that long. I was literally there for 40 mins from when I sat until my meal was paid for.  It was a great price for 9 items. Just like any other dim sum places, they came with 3-4 pieces. Either I wasn't hungry enough, the food was that filling or I drank too much of my drink that I was already full and had leftovers. There was 2 of us that shared and we both were full!   I'd definitely be back when I have a craving for dim sum again.",

We went there around 4 pm on a Wednesday. I believe there was only one group at a table when we got there so we didn't really have to wait to get a table. I'm all about the dim sum so I ordered the steamed BBQ pork bun, shrimp shumai, pork shumai, daikon cake, pan fried chive dumpling, sticky rice in lotus leaf, bean curd skin roll, and sugarcane shrimp (suggested by the waitress). The hubby ordered baked BBQ pork bun, deep fried meat ball, egg roll, salt & pepper fried calamari, house combination fried rice, salt & pepper fried shrimp, and one of the rice noodles. It's a lot of food and there was three of us. We had leftovers to bring home. lol.   I wouldn't get the egg rolls again. I feel like it's not worth it. You can go to the store and buy a box and it'll be cheaper and prob taste better. Everything else was pretty good tasting though. I was hoping they would have a bean curd seafood roll, but they only had a bean curd roll with veggies in it. The sugarcane shrimp was similar to the shrimp shumai because they both had ground up shrimp. The main difference between them was the sugarcane shrimp was deep fried and the shumai was steamed. Next time, I'll prob get the shrimp dumpling instead. I'm hoping that one has whole pieces of shrimp in it. The steamed pork bun was as expected. It had a good taste and had a sweet, soft and moist \"bun\". The sticky rice was pretty good. Loved the daikon cake and will be getting that again. I wouldn't mind going without most of what the hubby ordered.   The total with all these and soft drink came out to a little over $100. I have to say that I really liked the staff there. The whole time we were there it wasn't too busy. There always were open tables. I really liked that even though we were done and paid, we stayed longer to hang out and talk. They kept serving us drinks and make sure everything was ok even after paying the bill. We didn't feel rushed or anything. They were super nice and I would definitely go there again just because of the service. I'm hoping one day I'll find the perfect dim sum restaurant that will fulfill all my needs. But this one is pretty close.   Btw, the only thing I kinda didn't like were the restrooms. We went to the restrooms right before we left, and although they were pretty clean, the smaller stall was too small. I hit my head on the door. lol. Other than that everything was pretty good.",

If you dine in, expect your food to take a little longer.. It's because they make their food fresh. Everytime I go here it is always busy. If you are in a rush it's probably best to just call your order in for pick up. Based on my experience, they've never taken longer than 15-20 minutes. Just make sure to check your order before leaving.",

Ample parking and a friendly welcome put us onto a good start. This place is also very well sign posted so it's hard to miss.  Despite being a busy dinner time, we were able to be seated right away at a very comfy and private booth. My partner was a little disappointed that they don't have a cart with dishes that comes around the restaurant so he can pick something out, but the menu they provide has a picture of every item so you can still pick something that you like the look of, but that's made to order and just for you!  We went for a few small plates and an entree each. Entrees were the honey walnut shrimp that my partner really liked but thought that the taste of honey was very subtle, I went for the fish fillet in black bean sauce that was on the specials and it was plentiful and delicious! Melt in the mouth and full of flavour. Highly recommend!!  Small plates we picked were the BBQ pork bun which was so fresh and soft, deep fried shrimp with a sauce which was great and a big portion! Also the pork dumplings which were a little watery but still tasty and a great little snack!  Food came out in no particular order and as soon as it was ready, which meant that it was all hot and fresh and we were able to start eating straight away.  Although we didn't have enough space for dessert, what I liked about DSC was that they don't just have a matcha or vanilla ice cream scoop which is what I find in a lot of Asian inspired restaurants, but they have a good variety of sweet buns, breads and other fun and great looking desserts.  We loved it here and will have to come back again to try some of the desserts, as well as the other delicious looking plates we couldn't manage this time around.  Great local dim sum with excellent variety and good service!",

The major advantage to this is everything comes up fresh and hot! The menu is clear and easy for any novice with pictures and prices.   They have all the classics and favorites and they are done well! They have specials as well to keep things interesting.   There are fish tanks in the wall and it's big and open inside. Service is friendly and sufficient. I have yet to see it packed so you can sit and eat right away.   Dim sum on the west side for the win!",

A personal favorite was the curry cream cheese wontons, which were downright excellent. Good portion sizes (what you would expect from a Dim Sum restaurant), great variety and most of all, it was cheap. With drinks (soda) and food enough for two people, we paid $30 on our first visit and $20 on our second. Our third visit during the week had three of us out the door for $50, and that included drinks and enough food to fill the table.  The staff were friendly and prompt. The restaurant itself is far enough out of the way that traffic getting there was a complete non-issue on each visit, and there was always parking right out front. It'll definitely be a must-visit place whenever I find myself in Vegas again.",

I ate at MANY highly regarded Dim Sum Restaurants in both places with my Chinese friends and colleagues. I also ate at highly reputable Dim Sum restaurants in Chinatowns of New York, San Francisco and Toronto and also ate at arguable the best Dim Sum restaurant in Las Vegas, Ping Pang Pong.  Dim Sum Cafe is the closest Dim Sum restaurant to my home and I have been meaning to try it for some time.  I will say I was HIGHLY disappointed on MANY levels. I waited to be seated for almost 10 minutes while there were MANY tables empty.  I waited another 5 minutes before I received a place setting, menu and asking for my beverage order in the mean time a party who arrived 10 minutes after me received it all from the same waitress.  I ordered tea and received a pot of tea with LUKE WARM water and ONE tea bag.  A TEA BAG in a DIM SUM restaurant.  The tea was diluted and got cold quickly.  I had order Shumai, Har Gow and BBQ Pork Rice Noodle to start off with.  The Rice Noodle arrived 5 minutes later warm at best.  It took almost 30 minutes to get my Shumai and Har Gow.  I was about to leave.  This was the worst Dim Sum I ever had given my experience above, compounded by the wait time, bad service and cold weak tea. I will never go back. I will drive 3x as far and go to Ping Pang Pong.",

But once you order from their menu (which one menu is all traditional dim sum dumplings and another with Chinese dishes) there's not one food item that is not so tasty and made very well, and this is coming from a person who lived in San Francisco for 5 years near Chinatown, and visited New York's Chinatown's Dim sun.

It was pretty quiet for a Saturday, so I was a little scared. The food wasn't bad and the servers actually spoke English. It was a tad bit more expensive than what I'm used to, but overall it was a good experience.",

    "text": "So, looking to eat Dim Sum on Chinese New Year in Chinatown is probably going to cost you at least a 45 minute wait. Let's not forget the Saturday/Sunday morning/brunch rush.   I found this place as a desperate attempt to skip lines, get good service, and most importantly, stuff my face with the glories of dim sum awesomeness.   This isn't your typical \"authentic\" dim sum where you'll see carts coming around. Yeah, I like that part of dim sum, too, but, having had eaten here, I've come to appreciate the beauty of a sit-down made-to-order dim sum.   For the first time in my life, I was able to be present during my meal, focusing on what was on my plate and appreciating every bite of what was happening to me  rather than having my eyes darting all over the place, looking at what the next cart has to offer, frantically attempting to grab every goodie from each cart.  Pros:  No wait here. No lines.  Fresh items that are cooked just for your order.  Lower possibility of over-ordering, because my eyes are always bigger than my belly.  Good pricing.  Delicious Quick/good service  Cons: No cart people walking around?   Items ordered:   Pork Porridge- 5 star. Who knew porridge could be so good without adding soy sauce. The broth was so delicious, I was amazed at how they had made this.   Stuffed eggplant - 5 star. OMG. Do it like Nike, because this stuff is sooooo good.  Steamed pork Dumpling - 5 star. It ain't Din Tai Fung, but, you can't compare anything to that standard. This is as good as it gets for a dim sum spot.   Pan fried chive dumpling - 4 star. Pork Shumai- 3 star.   Chicken Shumai- 3 star.  Egg roll- 2 star. Good, nothing extraordinary Combination chow fun- 3 star.   Red bean sesame ball- 5 star. Crisp, light, fresh, not too oily.  Steamed bok choy- 3 star. It's veggie. What can I say.  Radish cakes - 4 star (special menu). My fave, but not on regular menu :(.   I can't believe in my dim sum history, I'd pick a sit-down place to be one of my fave and best moments, but, yes, I think I have found my spot. I shall report back after I have tried the other famous spot at the Rio casino...but, till then, I give this place my solid 5 star.  Oh, and I hope they carry white vinegar in the future. I can't enjoy dumplings to the fullest with red vinegar, which is apparently all they have for customers to use for the dumplings.  Don't forget to pick up an almond cookie for 50cents on your way out. This isn't that cheap, nasty, hard almond cookie you can get at CVS or in a box. It tastes homemade, and crumbles in your mouth.",

This is chinese food, not American chinese food! All the dim sum is cooked to order and not sitting in a cart or in the back. When you order it, they go and make it, so everything is fresh and hot.  The look of the restaurant is not chinese at all. Appears to have been some other kind of restaurant before, but it's very clean. It's in a little strip mall away from all other things asian, but that's fine with me. No longer eat dim sum in the hotels or along Spring Mountain.  We had a car so we don't mind driving around finding places to eat. Plus we're staying with family out in the Summerlin area so it was about a 20 minute drive via the freeway.  Told my brother about it so we all came for dinner 2 nights later. It was yummy! Ate other dishes but was so excited I forgot to take pictures.",

We were really amazed and proud for Mrs. Wong that her son was following in her (and her husband's) foot steps of running a 1st class establishment. We were treated to some of our old favorites, the shu mai and the turnip cakes, which were tasty, tasty tasty!!! We ate so much wonderful dim sum, topped off with jin dui (sesame balls) and hot tea for desert. Outstanding!! The prices were very reasonable and the service was great!! We will return!!",

The one thing I was excited about, Miso soup, was gross! I've never had bad miso till now. The seaweed was clumped and weird colored, the soup itself had no flavor! How is that possible?! So we will not be going back to this place again. Better luck for others.",

He came back in a good amount of time and took our orders. We got our food about 10 minutes later, which we thought was great. As we started to eat.. We realized we had no water. So we had to ask twice for water. And as we bit into our delicious looking food... We found it wasn't as yummy as it looked. The noodles were too fat, the veggies were cut wayyyy too big and it was almost impossible to grab them and chop it in half. The decor is amazing and the iced coffee was good, but don't eat here unless you want soggy noodles in a slow joint.",

    "text": "Was expecting this place to be a frequent future haunt but no such luck sadly. After reading the reviews and living not too far from this area, was banking on it given the amazing Chinese/Taiwanese food scene in Las Vegas. I added almost as much chili sauce in food weight to get any sort of a flavor or desire to eat. So bummed.  Ordered -  1.) Baked bbq pie (Char Siu Soh) - Commercially made and pre-frozen. And, if they did make and then froze, where's the pork? Yikes. Had two bites. It tasted like pre-made canned puff pastry that hasn't been cooked enough and had what I call, 'The Sheen'. Horrid.  2.)Hot and Sour Soup - Clearly the base for all soups is used and they forgot which soup was ordered. It was the worst hot and sour soup I've ever had, and that's saying a lot. The soup also had 'The Sheen' and tasted as if re-heated several times with oil and water. No flavor aside from oil. Ingredients were old.  3.) Baked bbq pork bun - We were getting desperate to like something. It reminded me of fast food Chinese bakeries. The dough is like sponge cake and it had been pre-frozen. Would be surprised if onsite creation.   4.)Shrimp shu mai - We were in need of liking something and this was okay but not fresh and pre-frozen fast food taste.  5.) Beef and Broccoli - Luckily for my kid, she was neutral on this one due to hunger. Ate some of the beef but the broccoli, as she noted, tasted weird. At first thought it was her pickiness, but the dish was tasteless, the broccoli had a rancid taste, and again w the beef, 'The Sheen'. Carrots were also commercially frozen. Given it was 9.50, could have done so much more.  Am giving an extra star because the staff were so friendly. It was takeaway, and the sauces were placed first in the bag under the food which looked like Jackson Pollock got a hold of brown toned oils and went crazy in a plastic bag and all over all the styrofoam food containers.  Still mourning. Ambiance of place was quite pleasing, though there were only two tables occupied and that may have been a sign. if they completely re-vamped their culinary situation, they would be packed.",

We got the Family Dinner A, which came with 2 egg rolls, 4 wontons, 2 egg drop soups, and an entree of both Sesame Chicken and BBQ Pork fried rice. We also got 2 fountain drinks to go. It all came to $20.   The food was prepared quickly and packaged well. Once we got it home, it tasted great. The egg rolls definitely beat out the wontons, though, so if you're picking one, go for those. The entrees were both really tasty and plentiful portions.   We will definitely be going back to Dim Sum to explore more of the menu.",

Wow was that a great choice. No they are no carts but the made to order appeals to me more because the food is fresh and fast. The food tho! Amazing honestly we both looked at each other and had these faces of WOW! So I recommend this place if you are looking for delicious and authentic dim sum. Added Plus on parking and fast service.",

This just means the food comes out piping hot and fresh. The selection of dim sum was excellent, at least for the items I usually order. The service was average, but they get kudos for being attentive.  The food was delicious. Prices are a little higher than our usual dum sum place.  The only criticism was there were two items we ordered that they ran out of. It is a major pet peeve of mine when you have regular menu items out of stock, it implies someone is not doing their job at inventory when you are out of multiple items. One is understandable, but three?  Overall, a good experience and we will probably be back again.",

Upon walking in to an entirely empty restaurant, we asked for a bigger table with the lazy Susan l and were denied. Told we're only a party of 5 and the smaller table was a better fit for us. If you do decide to take the gamble, avoid the elderly female waitress. I'm not sure what's worse, her or a car salesman. You try to order something, for example the $4.50 Chinese  broccoli, she will tell you it's not good and that the snow pea leaves with garlic is is better. Which is a $12 plate. She also rushes you while you order which we also found pleasant. Then after eating, while a younger girl cleaned our table. She looked at us like we we're absurd to ask for another bag and 2 more to go boxes. She hesitated and came back with 1 box. I had to ask again for another box as originally requested and she again stared at me before going to get another box. Like wtf? I'm not going to stack my food and mix everything together so you can save your 10 cents. To our waitress that stared at us as we left, we left a tip that we thought you deserved. So now you know :)",

    "text": "This restaurant is one example of why I can't trust Yelp very much anymore.  If I were to rate this cafe, I'd give it 4.5. And like most users, that .5 stars is merely because they market themselves as dim sum, but does not have the carts to give you the \"full dim sum experience.\" But you know what? Who cares if they don't have a bunch of old, middle-aged, rude Chinese women pushing your food around?  Here's the deal Yelpers, it blows my mind that most of the reviews take out so many stars or give this place a bad review because of the lack of carts. Let me inform you guys that this place serves the best dim sum food in all of Vegas (bold statement, but True.) The reason why this restaurant does not cart their food around for you is because they know they aren't located in Chinatown with millions of customers everyday, but they want to preserve the quality of their food, which is why they cook their food fresh for you. I can guarantee you that even the other great dim sum places in Vegas (Cathay House, Chang's) will sometimes microwave your food, or heat up leftovers for you to eat.   Oh and \"how's the service?\" You might be asking. It is incredible. It may be because I came for a late lunch, but we had the most excellent service ever at any dim sum. Waited a reasonable amount of time to be seated, then had kind service through my whole meal. There are simple key things that waiters and waitresses should do (say \"May I...Please... Thank You...\") I mean very basic things that most restaurants don't accomplish, but it takes you a long way. The waitress was even kind enough to hold the door open on my way out. I won't say to expect these kinds of things at peak hours, but they definitely do put a lot of care into their customers.  TL;DR don't come here if you are looking for cart pushers, come if you want some quality food.",

    "text": "It's our typical day after drinking, lazy Sunday and the boyfriend and I were craving dim sum. After getting a business card for Dim Sum Cafe from Orchid Garden, our usual go-to spot for dim sum, we decided to try it out and apparently Dim Sum Cafe has the same owners as Orchid Garden. Dim Sum Cafe skimped on the normal dim sum cart experience and instead provide a menu to order off of.   We ordered the following dumplings: -Har Gow (steamed shrimp dumpling) -Pork shumai -Chicken feet -Shrimp noodle -Pork spare ribs -Fried chive dumpling  Har Gow has been my most favorite dumpling since I was a little girl and in all honesty, it's hard to mess it up and tonight it did not disappoint. The shrimp noodle, chicken feet and fried chive dumpling didn't taste any different than any other I've had before so it's safe to say that it satisfied my cravings. With that being said, the shumai and pork spare ribs lacked in flavor. The sauce for the spare ribs were more liquified than the usual thick, stick to the meat sauce. I do want to say though, where the food lacked in flavor was made up by the customer service and mouth-burningly hot food, which was a plus! To me, the next best thing to flavorful food is super fresh food!!",

A friend of mind had told me that the owners were the same as Orchid Garden, so I was quite weary to try this place only because I am not the biggest fan of their dim sum. However, I figured I'd give it a go and the bf and I ordered...  - FRIED TARO 8/10: Really yummy savory taro filling with a delicate fried outer shell. Bf said it was a little salty.  - PORK SHUMAI 5/10: Did not taste like the shumai I'm used to. It had a weird smell, kinda like a dog, but it tasted okay. The bf did say he liked this. - BEAN CURD SKIN 9/10: I actually quite enjoyed this one. It had vegetables on the inside and wasn't too salty. I would come back for this! - SHRIMP HARGOW 2/10: I've never had hargow I didn't like until today. Shrimp was not fresh and had a weird texture. The bf and I didn't want to eat more than 1 bite.  - RICE NOODLE w/ SHRIMP 2/10: this is usually my fave dish anywhere I can get dim sum, however the rice noodle was over cooked and was soooo mushy. - SWEET RICE CAKE 7/10: This was good! I even brought some home to my mom since it's her favorite. My only complaint is that it's not as moist as most other places. - RED BEAN SESAME BALL 9/10: Served hot and fresh, really yummy.  I think I'd definitely come back to try the other dishes. Service was friendly and attentive and I like that the dim sum is made to order.",

Everything is piping hot so you don't have to worry about old food. One of my favorite things to eat at dim sum is Shumai and Fried Taro Puffs. The pork shumai was pretty good and juicy and the taro puffs were very bland. The Hargow was ok and chicken feet was ok. My wife liked how clean it was here and for that reason alone I maybe coming back but as far as flavor i feel I'll never have as good as an experience for dim sum comparable to LA,San Fran, or NY",

    "text": "As far as dim sum places go in Las Vegas, this has to be one of my favorite spots. The consistency and the overall quality of the food is what keeps me coming back.  They have the standards on their dim some menu. The shrimp har gow is pretty amazing and so is the salt and pepper shrimp. Others that I've gone with said the pork shumai and the BBQ pork bun were pretty stellar as well.  This last trip we had the har gow. Served in the traditional bamboo steamers, the wrap wasn't overly sticky and held together pretty good. Can't stand when they are overlooked and the wrapper sticks to the bottom. My friend had the mushroom dumpling. These were made to perfection. Funky diced mushroom in the traditional wrapper and seasoned very well. Also had the salt and pepper shrimp. The amount of shrimp you get on the dim sum menu for 6.50 is pretty good considering the portion size and the fact that usually it's about double the price for a dinner portion. Also tried the curry cream cheese wontons. If you're a fan of curry you'll love these!  The wait staff was very courteous and helped with all our decisions. Service is pretty quick and when we went it was lunchtime. They had an ample amount of tables filled but they still were very attentive and very courteous.   This isn't one of those Chinatown places where they have the carts being pushed up and down the isles by someone. I actually prefer the menu style of ordering dim sum. Some people tend to like the traditional carts. Every so often for Sunday brunch I'll go to one of those spots but for day to day dim sum I like the convenience of ordering from a menu.  All in all if you're looking for good sim sum in a clean and good restaurant this is be place. Like I said, not the traditional carts but the food is pretty good and the prices are amazing. This will continue to be one of my go to's for that dim sum craving.",

After looking over the menu, I told the waitress I wanted a cup of hot and sour soup and an order of braised pork belly with preserved vegetables.  She gave me an odd look and then said, \"Those are dried vegetables.  They're not fresh vegetables.\"  My response was, \"Yes?\"  She then told me again they were not fresh vegetables and she added, \"I don't think you'll like that.  You should order something else.  We have fish and....\" and she gestured to other items on the separate, non-main menu.  I just got profiled because I'm not Asian.  I won't like it!!  I don't think she'll like this 1 star review!!!!  I looked over the menu some more and opted for the curry chicken.  In a short time, the curry chicken was brought.  Note that since I didn't say hot and sour soup a second time, it was left off the order.  In a few seconds, she brought the small bowl of rice.  They use plastic chopsticks and I have a difficult time with heavily sauced Chinese food and plastic.  I should have gone to the car where I always keep a pair of wooden chopsticks but I put the plastic ones down and started using my fork.  The server saw this and asked, \"Do you want a spoon?\"  My answer was a quiet but firm, \"No!\"  In a few moments she came to the table with a small plastic spoon that looked like a child's spoon.  The chicken was OK.  The sauce was heavy.  There should be more curry flavor.  This was my fourth time here (and last) and I have always gotten Singapore noodles and after the first time I've had to stress heavy on the curry.  That was my mistake this time.  I finished my meal, paid, crossed off the line for tip, signed the charge, and left.    As you can tell, the service experience was awful.  But I would like this server to know that if she ever came to my restaurant, I wouldn't tell her she wouldn't like the scrapple.",

A girl brought tea and water, didn't say a single word, didn't smile, then walked away. 20 or so minutes later, the host? came back to take our order. We were wary at this point.

My review as I come after my massage (medical massage next door at Body Kinetics). I've been twice and I'm a major lover of Chinese food. This did not disappoint. For quite literally next to nothing you can eat a whole lot of dim sum. They are quick and terse (not really service with a smile) but when they are that busy and running around you can't blame them-especially with these prices.   A few tips-don't rely on photos as they aren't always the same as the food served-for the most part yes but if you don't do dim sum ask, also the spare ribs are quite nasty, not the red long spare ribs seasoned as you may be accustomed to but a little bowl of fatty, very little actual meat and embedded bone (got it twice so I vouch for this). Also TIP-an egg roll is a SPRING ROLL. I knew this and they clearly show it but if you are looking for good old fashioned DEEP FRIED, CRISPY, PORK AND VEGETABLE EGG ROLL-go to a Hunan restaurant.  All said I really think for $20 to get beyond full is a bargain-especially when the food is good.",

We normally go to Chinatown's Orchid Garden for good Dim Sum.  But found good reviews for Dim Sum Cafe and it's in our part of town.  Needless to say, this place is awesome and we now have no need to go to Chinatown for authentic Dim Sum!  Here's what we got when we were there:  Vegetable Fried Rice (it has egg in it), Chinese Broccoli, Veggie Chow Mein, Red Bean Sesame Ball, Mushroom Shumai, & Vegetable Eggroll.  So, from what we ordered you can see we didn't actually have a ton of Dim Sum.  Based on the Dim Sum we received I know for a fact this place knows what they are doing.  We eat a lot of Dim Sum but due to the dietary restrictions we've recently took on we were a bit conservative on what we ordered.  Overall, this place is a great value for the price.  The location is extremely clean and stylish (compared to Orchid Garden in Chinatown).  The food is excellent and has a bit of the Hong Kong flair to their cooking.  The Dim Sum isn't sitting on steam carts which mean it's way more fresh than we're used to.  And surprisingly for someone that doesn't eat meat there are a lot of options.",

I liked that they had pictures, sometimes it can be hard to decipher what each item is just based on the name. The service was great. I was greeted and given ample time to look at the menu. I was also offered water while I waited. I ordered the beef tripe, shrimp fun rolls, pork porridge, turnip cake, calamari, and the steamed chicken buns. My favorites were the fun rolls, tripe, calamari, and steamed buns. The turnip cake was slightly different than what I was used to, I believe they used a radish. It was good, but broke apart easily and made it difficult for me to dip it in chili sauce. The calamari was flavorful, I could taste the 5 spice and really liked how they deep fried it. It wasn't as greasy as it can be, I hardly sauce any excess oil soaking through the shredded lettuce. The pork porridge was just ok to me. I felt like I needed a lot more than soy sauce and chili oil to flavor it. Overall not a bad experience, but definitely not the best dim sum I've ever had.",

The shrimp har gow was decent. The shrimp with bell pepper tasted fresh. But even the chili sauce at the table had little chili and just drenched in oil. Just a horrible experience to be honest. You don't even have the rolling carts with the dim sum in it. Thank goodness the bill was about $20. I was still hesitant to pay that much for it. What a disappointment. Too bad cause it's so close as location and more convenient. But the flavor is not worth the miles.",

And my favorite was this fried noodles that were crispy but once mixed with the sauce it was perfect! I usually am not a fan of that but the sauce and noodle ratio was just right.  I cannot wait to try more of their main dishes.",

    "text": "If you want good Dim Sum, drive a little farther and go to Las Vegas Chinatown.  They were located on S Hualapai Wy/Twain in Las Vegas.  They are open 7 days a week from 7am-4pm.  When I walked in, there were about a dozen employees standing  behind the counter for a staff huddle.  One gal seated me and a another guy brought me water.    They had 3 small flat screen tvs and 5 fish tanks.  The booths were really hard.  They didn't have much cushion to them.  Where I was seated, I could hear the kitchen staff and the servers behind me talking and hanging out.  They had nice laminated menus.  The only problem was that they didn't have enough menus.  A woman tried to pick up my menu after I ordered.  But I wanted to hang on to it in case I wanted to order more.  They offered 15 Dim Sum options, breakfast, salads, sandwiches, noodles, fish, From the Wok, and soups.  I ordered 4 Dim Sum dishes.  Fried Calamari ($6.50):  There were 9 lightly breaded rings of calamari served on a saucer plate.  The server asked if I wanted sweet and sour, hoisin, hot chili, or soy sauce.  I choose sweet and sour sauce.  It was served in a little plastic container.  It was watery.  Stuffed Mushrooms ($3.50):  There were 4  piping hot mushrooms stuffed with tasteless ground shrimp and calamari served on a saucer plate.  The server brought me hoisin and hot chili sauce in a little plastic container, and a bottle of soy sauce for the dumplings.  Pork Shiu Mai ($2.50):  4 pieces served on a saucer plate.  They were filled with ground pork and mushrooms.  Steamed Pork Dumplings ($3): 3 dumplings served on a saucer plate.  These were the best out of the 4 items I ordered.  They could at least invest in proper serving plates, offer chopsticks, and have little jars of condiments on the table.  They need a website and a Facebook page.  I paid at the counter and left. Paying $18 with tip was way too much for what I got.   I won't be back.",

Ever since moving to vegas I have been hunting for a place to satisfy those dim sum  cravings.  This place did it for me!  Is it the best Dim Sum place I've ever been to? No - is it the best I've been to in Vegas? I think yes.   Also try their Won Ton soup! It's reeealy good. & I'd stay away from the shrimp har gow, the steamed ship dumplings are better. Also the steamed pork dumplings are SUPPER JUICY BUT they do not come with the traditional sour sauce for steamed pork dumpings. Still I would HIGHLY recommend them. :)",

Perhaps the hour was strange - 4PM or so - but the place was empty. Fortunately we were quickly seated and helped out.  The food wasn't bad, but also nothing too fantastic either. The service was alright but our waitress remarked how nice it was that I knew how to use chopsticks...perhaps it was because of the company I was with but it seemed like a strange thing to say out of the blue.  At least the custard buns were $2.50.",

This place has its perk as it is near where I live and it serves dim sum hot. The taste of the dim sum taste is pretty good. I would come here again.",

    "text": "I stopped by Dim Sum Cafe for lunch last week and it was a disappointment.  The menu has everything from American breakfast, Dim Sum, Salads, Sandwiches/Burgers, Spaghetti/Ramen, Sweet/Sour Pork to Fish and Chips.   When I saw the menu it seemed funny to have so much of everything that was not Dim Sum. They did not have a lot of Dim Sum on the menu, maybe 15+ items...no Har Gau (shrimp dumpling), a must have for any restaurant wanting to serve Dim Sum.   I ordered 3 different types of Siu Mais (Chicken, Pork, Shrimp), only the Shrimp was okay, the pork and chicken both needed flavoring. Imagine flavorless pork, yuk. I also got the chicken pot stickers (made from store bought pot-sticker skin) which was also tasteless. The eggrolls, ehhh...stuffed mushroom/shrimp ehhh...and a fake sharkfin dumpling (was told that's what it was) also ehhh.  The waiter said all their Dim Sum is made to order or heated up when order...it all came out not very hot. I had a red bean ice to drink, that was okay but not enough since it came out in a short glass.   This restaurant just opened a week ago and I think they are trying to be jack of all trades and unfortunately they have not even mastered their namesake (Dim Sum). If they named the restaurant Dim Sum Cafe, you'd think they serve really good Dim Sum, not so here.  The service was okay and the restaurant was clean and bright but I would not venture to this place if you are serious about Dim Sum.",

Therefore, all of our food was fresh and delicious. And the price is unbelievable, probably payed a lot less than I would have at any of the Dim Sum restaurants near Chinatown. I think I've found my all time favorite dimsum restaurant :) will definitely be coming back soon!",

    "text": "Probably my favorite dim sum place in Vegas.  I love the fact they don't use carts. You're orders are made to order so you have fresh & hot dim sum no matter when  you come in. I wish the baked char sui bao were made to order but that's hard to do, they just weren't that hot.  Our favorite of the night are the har gow, stuffed eggplant & pan fried chive dumplings. My favorite was definitely the pan fried chive dumplings,  they were The best I had since moving heren The place is beautiful & very clean. I appreciate the fact that they have a picture menu do those dim sum virgins in our party were able to see a picture before we ordered. If we had one negative I'd we wish most of the orders had 4 pieces instead of 3. Other than that we highly recommended this restaurant",
