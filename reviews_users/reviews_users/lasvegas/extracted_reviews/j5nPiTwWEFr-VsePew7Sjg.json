I think what they consider chu and what america calls chu is chu different. ha ha bad joke!",

    "text": "went here to try to satisfy a craving for japanese food while on a weekend getaway with my boyfriend. decided on it after reading through reviews on both this place and raku. it was a saturday evening and raku didn't have any space for hours, so ichiza it was. casual, friendly environment, slightly noisy as we were seated at the bar which looks into the kitchen (which is sort of fun to observe); there were also regular tables and chairs as well as low tables to sit at as well. service was prompt. the menu was extensive as already noted, with a vast array of offerings beyond the printed menu. i was probably over-eager, and we ordered the agedashi tofu, red snapper carpaccio, salmon fried rice with mushrooms, spicy deep fried chicken, spicy tuna roll. i also ordered the much-hyped black cod in miso but thankfully there was an ordering mix-up and it didn't arrive -- i say this because the portions were very generous! not your typical japanese calorie-controlled portions. the only disappointment was the fried chicken (which is usually a revelation at these small japanese joints that churn out lots of fun dishes), which was dry and somewhat flavorless. i don't think they put any thought into the seasoning, and the batter was overly thick. the spicy tuna roll and agedashi tofu were standard -- very solid. the salmon fried rice was pretty original, taste-wise. maybe a bit too much rice in there, though. the red snapper carpaccio was my favorite. fresh and a nice combination of lemon and a slightly sour salty sauce drenching slivers of onions. finished with two pieces of mochi ice cream, which was really all we could stuff in at that point -- we eyed the honey toast being served to another table, and i was definitely intrigued -- hopefully there will be a next time! i think the strength of this place is the number of selections and a combination of decent portions and good flavors. i wouldn't say that the place is a revelation or that i'm totally craving one of the dishes i tried that night, but i would definitely go back b/c i have confidence in the kitchen to offer up many more dishes that i would enjoy choosing and trying -- all without breaking the bank.",

Something about being white, middle aged, and vacationing in Vegas brings out the worst in people. Add sake and gen-u-wine Japanese food, and you get fourty-somethings licking food off of each other's bodies (and then applauding each other's courage for doing something so indecent in public) while opting to forgo the wearing of footwear (and not as a display of respect, but as a display of drunken negligence- who walks around in a parking lot without shoes @ 2am?) While the menu at Ichiza is dynamic, drunken tourists are always on the menu. Yes: Kirin on tap, seared salmon belly, miso butterfish, kimchi fried rice, seared bonito, sashimi, rolled sushi, braised pork belly, mixed mushrooms, honey toast.  No: hamachi collar (salty and dry), skewers (blach- greasy), octopus and cucumber (not so fresh), anything with egg in it.",

That first experience was so bad I couldn't even bring myself to write a review I just wanted to forget the whole experience. One night my friends really wanted to try this place out, I was very hesitant and insisted that we go someplace else. But of course they had heard great things of this place and wanted to try it out. Like I said earlier the ambiance of this place is awesome. I tried the oysters all 3 or 4 styles. OMG it was amazing def. had a lot of flavor very fresh LOVED IT. Then I had the Yellow tail sashimi with jalapenos, the cuts were awesome the sauce was incredible. I wanted to try the raw beef but they were out. I had the spicy tuna hand roll instead. This was def not the type of spicy tuna they have in a tub and just scoop it up, it was very fresh and you could tell they just prepared it. My overall experience second time around definitely changed my mind about the place, the service could use a little work. Not that they weren't nice they just didn't come as often as I would have liked. I look forward to going back and trying out some new stuff!",

I've been to several izakaya in Japan over the years and this place just brings me back there immediately.   My japanese buddy in San Francisco is jealous of this place to give you a little perspective on my claim.  The food is incredible and you'll find yourself hard pressed to try everything they have to offer as new items come and go all the time.  I recommend damn near everything on the menu.  If something scares you, ORDER IT, and you'll be pleasently surprised everytime.  If you do try this place, make sure you get a members card, as you will definately be returning.  For every 5$ you spend you get a stamp.  The initial card saves you 5%, fill it up and you save 10%, fill up a second card and you save 15%.  This is permanent by the way, you can use it for every visit.  SO GO THERE ALREADY, and I'll most likely see you there as I am there 4-5 times a week.",

As a japanese food nut, i appreciate the variety of the Ichiza menu (spending nearly $100 between 2 people)  but none of the items really knocked it out of the park. They weren't bad, mind you, but they weren't memorably good.  Im always one to say ''support the little guy\"'....so the next time you are thinking about going out with some friends and want a departure from traditional restaurant/bar chains, give these guys a try...i think you will like it...  one other thing...make a reservation!!!",

I had the best beef ever!!! Even better than Korean BBQ...wait, nothing can beat korean bbq. Anyhoo, it's called \"Beef Tataki.\" For like $6, it's a tiny dish with several slices of this deliciously flavored meat. I would rather have several dishes of this stuff than some plain boring american steak. Another fantastic dish: \"Crab Fried Rice.\" Around $7, and it's a perfect size for one person. I think it's fake crab meat, but it's the best fried rice ever! They used some magical oils for sure. Not oily, just incredibly flavorful! This place uses fresh ingredients and makes every dish soooo intense with flavor, but still healthy!! I had the red snapper carpaccio as well,very fresh thinly sliced fish with some eggs and some veggies, but it felt too light like salad without much dressing. But seriously, I will come back to try everything :) I trust their taste. And the Japanese girls that work there are so cute and sweet. The manager is also very personable.",

There was a host of things to try including menu items written on the walls.  Somethings are a little on what some might consider the bit experimental side:  bits of this animal and that animal, e.g. beef tongue.  Still i had a great experience.  One thing they should do is take all the items on the wall, and incorporate those into the menu cause there were far too many and some were out of range to see.  My favorites were the bbq squid, the hamachi nachos, and the tofu salad (the exact dish name I can't remember).  We ordered pretty much everything we wanted to eat and then some including sake and the final price per person was only $33 each.  I think this place beats a lot of the places on the Strip hands down.  Taxi drives don't know about this place so be prepared to provide directions and an address when you go.  It was about a $10 cab ride from the Strip.  Service was definitely friendly and attentive.",

You can taste the flavors  distinctly when eating their dinners! I like their ramen. As for dessert, people have told me they have the best honey toast in town. I was super excited to try it after knowing what honey toast finally was. And to my dismay, it wasn't. It was just okay. I wouldn't get it again since I know somewhere else that has the best honey toast in town. It's not bad for the price, but I don't think it's that great.

Ichiza hollows out a whole lemon and puts the uni into the cavity of the lemon with cucumber slices, ponzu sauce, and fresh wasabi. The sour and salty flavors were so yummilicious that it had me moaning like a \"walker\" from \"The Walking Dead\". Mmmnnnguuuhhh!  The red snapper carpaccio was fucking genius. Consisting of red snapper sashimi with shiso, daikon sprouts, and roe atop a bed of sliced lemons. This is the dish to get if you want raw fish.   The wasabi octopus consists of chopped up raw octopus marinated with fresh wasabi and other flavors. This dish had a cooling aspect that I really enjoyed. I would have given them bonus points if the octopus had been alive (fuck you PETA!).  The yellowtail tar tar was good, but hard to eat. I have a pretty big mouth and was barely able to fit a whole piece in. Looking around, I realized that maybe you were supposed to eat it in pieces. Regardless, the combination of fried chips, rice, salsa, marinated raw yellowtail, and avocado is something that I think I may have to implement at Casa del Ricardo. Thanks Ichiza!  The deep-fried soft shell crabs were tasty, but what really made the dish was the ponzu/daikon sauce. I ended up drinking the sauce and asking for more. Also, I am a huge fan of gobo and the combination of grilled pork and gobo was pure bliss.   Only two of the items tasted meh. The pork belly and shiso was just so-so and the spicy fried chicken had to be the worst dish we ordered. It consisted of fried chicken marinated with \"gochu-jang\" (Korean chili paste) that made the chicken way too salty. I think we should have just gotten the JFC (Japanese Fried Chicken aka karaage).  However, I saved the best for last. The fried smelt. Yes it's simple, but it's just so fucking wonderful. In Western cuisine, the animal aspect is taken away from fish. I mean, you order fish filets at restaurants and there are no fucking bones. You order fish and chips and that fish is so deep-fried you have no idea what type of fish you are even eating. Well, with Ichiza's fried smelt, this is not the case. You get three whole smelt fish in all their glory from head-to-tail. What was amazing about these little fish were that they were exploding with roe. In fact, the fish were like 90% eggs! Don't think twice, just put them in your mouth because they are motherfucking oishi!  ----------------------------------  On the way back to our hotel, I kept referring to Ichiza as Ichiban (Japanese term meaning \"the shiznet\") to our Filipino cab driver. I think he must have gotten annoyed because he turned to me and said, \"It's Ichiza, sir.\" And in my drunken stupor I replied, \"It's both... it's both manong.\"  ----------------------------------  Wife just reminded me that despite her pinching me, my drunk ass told the head chef at Ichiza that he was Ichiban as well and that I told the server that the food was \"cho oishi\" in broken Japanese. ROFL.",

We had made a reservation in advance since one of our friends had been here before and we knew it would get packed quickly. It's located upstairs in a vanilla strip mall, but don't let the exterior deter you!  It's already been a few weeks, so I can't remember all the dishes we ordered. A few highlights:  Miso black cod: Nice and subtle flavor. Lightly broiled.  Garlic steak fried rice: Sooo good. A must. Better than the kimchi fried rice.  Honey toast: Save room for this. You'll thank me later.",

Some things were under seasoned like the calamari and fried baby octopus but overall everything was pretty good. The salmon carpaccio is delicious and bright, fresh tasting. The buttered mushrooms were CRAZY salty so I couldn't actually finish that. Cold soba with mountain yam was really yummy.   I think some of the best items on the menu are actually the items scribbled in Japanese on the walls.",

It was also pretty good when it is fairly cold during the winter months in Las Vegas.   Overall, really good late night eats. I will be returning!!!",

Having been to Japan where freshness, presentation, and simplicity of the entrees (meaning they don't mix too many ingredients that it takes away from the main ingredient in the dish instead of complimenting it) are what is showcased, this place truly matches up.  Try the sauteed beef tongue (or just beef for the less adventurous), tofu steak, Jalapeno fried rice, and tofu mousse for dessert. There are so many other things on the menu or off the wall  that are great, that you can try a new dish every time you go and you wont be disappointed!",

If you are willing to read all that, prepare your glasses and take a walk. I would check yelp first since many items on the wall are already introduced WITH pictures (although prices are often wrong).  But still, servers can help you to pick so tell them what you feel like eating today. Servers there eat their food too so they can tell you what they think about the item you're about to order.  Lastly, it's better if you tell the server about your allergy or veganism. (i.g. Jalapeno fried rice comes with some shrimp heads on its plate.)  Hope this helps!",

    "text": "Difficult to order, servers that don't speak English, and food that's gone down-hill over the years. At this point, I'm finding Ichiza izakaya over-rated.   FOOD: Running around the restaurant trying to order off-the-wall hasn't been easy or successful. My usual for the past few years has been the ahi tuna tartare, mackeral nigiri, and Ramen DX. They are permanent items and not on the ever-changing menu plastered around the facility. After a recent visit, I discovered the ramen no longer tastes the same and the cha-siu has lost the flavor I found so addicting. I was obsessed with the mackerel nigiri (saba) from here because it was cured with a unique balance of salt & vinegar and melded with a bed of yellow fish eggs. Not anymore, its plain old mackerel now and isn't special what-so-ever.  AUTHENTICITY: My friend from Japan worked at Ichiza a while back. She told me stories of under-washed vegetables, a caterpillar in a bowl of ramen, and how the recipes and ingredients are just NOT what the Japanese consider really good food.  SERVICE: Maybe its just me, but I get incredibly angry when my order can't be taken correctly. I speak up, I speak clearly, and I speak in an un-complicated way that should be able to be understood. The girls here don't understand simple restaurant requests and quite frequently get my order wrong. I have little to no patience for people in the service-industry that cannot speak or at least understand English well enough to perform at an optimum level.  For the sake of my belly and sanity, I probably won't elect to come here on most occasions. Ichiza is no longer the only place for izakaya!",

On our last trip, we made at least 2-3 stops here for grub after drinking.  I would say I was a lil buzzed one night, but the other nights, we were just hungry and looking for grub!  Even when you are full as s#&8#t, you still wanna come here!  Their food is just amazing!    I love me some Udon noodle soup and I will eat this dish be it on a hot day or a cold chilly night.  They have an Udon dish on their menu, but that's not what I had wanted so I simply asked them for beef udon and they gladly said they would make it for me.  Man, something about the broth of the soup, the beef so tender, the texture of the noodles just right.  It was definitely amazeballs!  Of course, from the first night in getting this dish, I got it repeatedly after that.  I'm so looking forward to another bowl on the next trip.  Drool!    We also ordered a special sushi roll from the wall menu, I don't even remember what it's called now..but it had some bbq eel and some deep fried yam/shrimp thing on top and man it was bomb diggity.  The sushi roll itself and the eel and fried whatever it was went perfect together.  Mouth full of goodness is all I can remember.    We also ordered a couple appetizers as well, I believe one of them may have been the squid dish.  Then as you move onto dessert, you know you gotta get the all time famous honey toast.  A big block of toast, warm, soft and yummy tenderness with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and honey... It is the perfect ending to a great dinner.    Friendly staff, place fills up quick, small joint, reasonable prices, great grub!  Looking forward to seeing you again real soon!",

We arrived at 1:30am, yep a late night spot. The place was a little busy, we got there just as everyone was about to leave. The hostess sat us and we were basically sharing a table (that would usually seat about 8-10 people) with two other patrons (nope, no idea who they were) right across from us. If you're uncomfortable with this, I really don't think you'll like eating here. Since the place is so small, they try to cramp everyone into every available seat.   Eats-- I just don't get what the big deal is about. We ordered spicy tuna, and some eel roll that the waitress suggested and wasn't on the menu. They were both, OKAY. Nothing that would make me want to order again in the future.   There service could've been better. As I said, we arrived just as everyone was leaving so there were only a hand full of people in the restaurant, so why did it take 20 mins to get our check? Seriously?   If I'm craving some late night Japanese eats, then maybe I'll try this place, but there best not be a wait, or I'm getting back in my car and heading else where.",

    "text": "I was visiting a friend for a day this past weekend out in Las Vegas and for a late dinner, we ended up going to Ichiza based on a another friend's recommendation. Good recommendation indeed. We didn't have to wait too long since there were a lot of seats available...although we were seated at the bar. The restaurant has placards of the items found on the menu all around the restaurant in Kanji characters as well as in english with Japanese pop music playing in the background. Very casual fun environment.  I ordered the tuna tataki, agedashi tofu and one of the specials (beef fried rice) since they didn't have the Hamachi Kama (which was highly recommended). The tuna tataki wasn't anything too grand, but it was still good. The agedashi tofu, a favorite appetizer of mine at Japanese restaurant establishments, was good. I have a preference where the outside is little bit more on the crispy/crunchy side, but I guess most places do theirs differently. My friend ordered the fried chicken, not quite chicken karaage, but more-so a deep frind version. Chicken was very good. Altogether, dinner was good. I'm wondering if there was a hint of MSG in their food, though. Should've checked the signs or the menu. Lol  We skipped dessert even though I really wanted to try the Honey Toast. I was just too exhausted to eat anymore. Next time, I'm getting that Hamachi Kama and the Honey Toast!",

    "text": "Where have you been all my life, Ichiza?  Sushi, Ramen, and anything else Japanese? In one little space?   I was intimidated by the wait at first, but what started as an hour wait ended up being only 25 minutes when several other parties cancelled. And thankfully, this appears to happen A LOT. But just remember, while it's not required, reservations do come highly suggested.  As a party of four, we all went in on the menu! One friend got sushi, another got mackerel, I got Japanese-style chow mein and gyoza and the fourth friend got something that begins with \"oppa\" (not sure how it's spelled). It's all perfect for sharing. I liked everything except the mackerel (and I don't like mackerel in the first place so the restaurant is at no fault for that).  Everything on the menu is really cheap by itself, but be mindful that everything does add up really quickly. We were quite surprised by our bill at the end of the meal.  Oh and did I mention I loved the ambiance? Between the low tables, the backless chairs, the small space with warehouse lighting, the large crowds and the Japanese written all over the walls, I really did feel like I had just been transported to Tokyo, and not just an Asian-themed strip mall in Las Vegas.  Pros: The ambiance Menu has loads of variety and very reasonable prices Frequent and friendly service who won't get annoyed if you add more and more to your plate  Cons: Small space leading to (possible) long waiting times to be seated and served While each individual item is inexpensive, it can all add up really quickly if you're not paying attention  Return Factor: I'd love to",

This dish was fantastic - the pork was sauteed perfectly and the tastes of the pork, kimchee and fresh cabbage blended perfectly. I would come back here for this dish alone.  My other dish, a Spider roll was just okay but I'll try others when I return.  They also had a good selection of beers on tap including Kirin and Sapporo.",

If you really want sushi go to one of the many AYCE sushi joints in town. When you first enter you know you are somewhere special. Even looking at the menu will make you think what the hell should I order.  We usually order something with 8 legs and something different cause there is always something different. I wish i could go more often. Have fun with a new experience. I would tell you of all the different things I ate but I think you should have the adventure of your own.",

My girlfriend really enjoy the yellow tail tar tar and tom yum roll saying that they \"had just the right amount of spicy-ness\".   The only thing that will take some getting used to is wandering around to look at the menu items on the wall but if that's the biggest problem this place presents I'll happily eat here as often as possible.

Red snapper carpaccio was served on lemon slices and toped with grated yam and salmon roe.

I searched yelp on my phone in a moment of desperation for a Japanese restaurant that was open and in the area and thanks to you guys, we found out about this cool little place.  I got excited when I read it was an izakaya. I currently have a secret love affair with an izakaya in my area so I was looking forward to checking out another place. The yakitori was good; nice healthy portion. The piggy in me noticed that a lot of the pictures on the walls of their rolls consisted of four or five pieces and I tend to like a big, fat roll. We went ahead and ordered the squid and uni roll anyway. The uni tasted nice and fresh, the squid was another story. I usually love squid, but I just hated the super slimy texture that it brought to the roll.   I thought the whole menu thing on the walls was a cute and quirky aspect of the restaurant; however, it got kind of annoying because I have horrible eyesight and I couldn't read stuff across the aisle. No way was my lazy ass going to get up and read everything on all the walls either. I think the honey toast is worth trying. Reminded me of a different version of the brick toast you can get at Guppies, but a better version! Reasonable prices, something rare in touristy Vegas.",

Its a medium sized joint with 2 big table areas for large groups.  The 2 big tables are carpet stools/stand things so ppl take off their shoes.  I heard about this place on Yelp and had to stop by.  We made a reservation for 10pm and the place was pretty packed around that time.  So reservations are definitely recommended for late night eating.  Now on to the food.  The food and drinks are decently priced compared to other vegas eateries off strip.  So obviously we're in vegas...so we ordered a few pitchers of beer and guzzled that down.  Honestly...when you're in vegas and thirsty...all beer pretty much tastes good.  So no complaints there.  I ordered the Mapo tofu which i didnt expect much from but this was actually one of the better versions that I've had.  It was a good brown gravy with a nice spicy kick to it and I didnt feel jipped on the lack of meat either.  Meat was plenty.  My friend ordered the Jalepeno fried rice and that probably was one of the best fried rice dishes I've ever had.  I love spicy food and that thing awesome.  Rice was moist, beef was easy to chew and the jalepeno's really just brought everything together.  Definitely something to order!  A couple of us got a chicken and egg bowl which was ok but a disappointment compared to the other 2 dishes.  The biggest surprise of the night...HONEY F-IN TOAST.  I kid you not...I could've sat there all weekend eating this thing over and over again.  Its such a simple concept...honey, toast, and ice cream...but they must've put crack in there cause I was addicted.  We had 2 orders of this thing even though we were already stuffed from the beers and entrees.  I think this place is totally awesome and I might just have to add it to my places to must stop by when visiting vegas...",

Anyway, maybe authentic asian food in a pretty authentic overseas asian setting (dumpy American style strip mall with sticky tables) isn't their thing, then they won't like Ichiza.  Some recommendations are: Ikayaki Red Snapper Carpaccio - the lemon garnish is perfect Tanmen Ramen - stir-fried ingredients gives it a full off the wok flavor, like Korean champon.  Many other ramen places do a Miso-yasai ramen that is also stir-fried first also Shabu Shabu salad - shabu style pork over mixed greens, roasted eggplants, seaweed, etc. with shabu style mixture of sesame and ponzu dressing Tofu steak - I like stir-fried bean sprouts Fried oysters - perfectly breaded to seal in the sweet oyster juices  Their lunch menu is limited to bento sets, donburi, ramen, and combos, which are good too.  Prices are very good, especially compared to hotel offerings at the Wynn or Palazzo.",

    "text": "I  Love  You  Ichiza  After watching The Beatles LOVE at The Mirage, our group headed over to Ichiza after reading rave reviews on Yelp prior to this trip.  This place did not disappoint!  I'm thinking...finally (extra stressed), GOOD, affordable and unpretentious Japanese food in Las Vegas.    You see, I'm not the type of gal who likes to dine in fancy, upscale and overpriced restaurants (maybe once in a blue moon), so I was really happy that Ichiza offered the quality of an upscale place (speaking in terms of the food) at such an affordable price and casual atmosphere.    Service was quick.  We casually walked in and were seated right away.  Our waitress always checked up on us and was more than happy to offer little tidbits of information on the menu and specials hanging all over the wall.  The ambiance is very authentic.  I felt like I stepped into a restaurant in Japan.  We ordered the following: 1.) Beef tongue skewers 2.) Fried Baby Octopus 3.) Three Ramen DX 4.) Udon Noodle Soup 5.) Spider Roll 6.) Miso Butterfish 7.) Fried Calamari Rings 8.) Fried Quail Eggs 9.) Three Lemon Shochu  Phew, that's a lot (granted, we were extremely hungry), but this accommodated a group of four very well.  Time to break down the taste and flavor!  I was actually a little hesitant to eat this because I've never had beef tongue before.  After taking the first bite, I was hooked.  It was chewy, juicy and packed with a lot of flavor for something so relatively thin.  The fried baby octopus was crunchy on the outside, but chewy on the inside.  It tasted lightly salted and was accompanied with lemon juice.  Yum.  Then, there's the miso butterfish.  Ohhh myyy goshhh.  Screw halibut, I'm going for butterfish now!  It had the same consistency as a halibut for a fraction of the cost!  So buttery and delicious.  Mmmm.  The last meal I ordered was the ramen dx, which I'm guessing means deluxe, though, I'm not sure.  This bowl was huge and comparable to Shinsengumi's Hakata ramen.  But, I think I enjoyed this ramen more.  They offered more toppings and bigger pork slices (with the fat attached, yum).  It's not extremely salty either which is nice.  Everything else, my group ordered, but from the looks of it, they seem to have enjoyed their meals very much. =)  For a group of four people, our bill came to a little over $100.  Pretty good I must say.  I'm definitely returning.",

In a city that replicates everything, this is literally the only original dining experience I've ever had. This is a True Japanese diner. The food is simple. The atmosphere is simple. The weight staff is simple. And in a city that is gilded, such simplicity yield perfection. The food was so good I ordered literally like 10 things. They were: tuna and giant oyster sashimi paired with anchovy sauce (holy shit good), red snapper sashimi paired with ponzu, lemon, and onion. Grilled skewers: ginkgo nuts, bacon wrapped potatoes, gizzards, tongue, deep fried quail eggs. Please please for the love of all things holy order the tongue and gizzards, miso soup, and tofu steak (meh, my wife wanted them). I paired this lovely feast with an ice cold draft beer. My final check was $40. No really $40. I know mind blown twice.",

Decided to return with the parents in tow as they haven't been back in some time. I can say that the quality and the selection of plates are not quite what they used to be. We had a number of dishes, too numerous to cover in this review but overall, it was all just average. It's a bit of a shame really as this place used to be so much better. Not sure what happened but the food lacks excitement and uniqueness. I do hope they can get back to their previous levels. In the meantime, if you are looking for really great izakaya, you're better off at either Hachi or Go.",

We ordered the Tom Yum soup (should be called Tom Yummy!), Beef Bowl (I finally found a place where I can get a Yoshinoya type of beef bowl. Finally!) and Crab Fried Rice. All delicious. I have tried other ramen places but their broth here was soooo good. I definitely recommend. The only reason why I gave it a 4 star is because of their customer service. We came early (about 4:15 pm, they opened at 5 pm) and it was very windy & cold afternoon.... they saw us outside the door with my 7 year old daughter, they didn't even bother to let us customers in since it was crazy windy & cold outside. If I were them, I would up my customer service game and let the customers in at 4:45... get comfy, give them water and start taking orders at 5 pm. But that's just me. There were about 3 parties waiting outside, we were all totally disappointed how the hostess treated us. Plus, the tall one didn't crack a smile the whole time. Every time we said \"thank you\", she would just walk away annoyed. Other than that, I would definitely recommend to eat here.",

Skimmed a few reviews before ordering, will com back to try more.  BEST:  Baby bok choy in garlic soup. The soup makes this dish, broth tastes like black garlic ramen and the fact that it's a veggie dish in a sea of fried options is also a plus. Not to mention it's a mere $4. Favorite dish of the night. Salmon sashimi comes 5 pieces to an order, good cut, thick and fatty. May come again to try other sushi options.  OKAY:   Grilled ika. Had a tiny bit of a sauce, seemed a little overcooked and tough, but this is a dish I normally love. There's a place in Henderson that does it better. Shabu Shabu Salad. Flavors are springtime fresh with fresh produce, chicken, eggplant?, and a light dressing. Good fresh option on the menu.  SKIPPABLE: Takoyaki. Overly breaded. Woudn't get again. Seemed undercooked.  Service was polite, quick, and attentive. Sit at the bar to watch what goes on in the open kitchen, or sit at one of the old-school tables toward the back.",

Trusting me with the items to order, I had them try our favorites- Grilled Beef Tongue, Tom Yum Roll, Buta Kimchi, Takana Fried Rice, Uni Ponzu, Grilled Mackerel, Grilled Squid, and Bacon Wrapped Mochi.  The men decided to wash all that goodness down with a pitcher of Kirin on tap, and the ladies opted for their refreshing Grapefruit Soju. Plates were clean, everyone was stuffed, but we still had room for some Coffee Jello and Honey Toast. Still one of my favorite late night spots. ALOHA!!!

It was a little annoying to find consistent information about when they are open, their website (on the home page and the contact page) and yelp have different times listed. Their door says 5pm-2:30am with the last call at 2:30am. I guess this means they don't have happy hour anymore?  I went with one other person, we sat at the bar. It's an open kitchen, so we can see what the chefs are doing the whole time.   We ordered and shared: beef tongue skewers chicken yakitori skewers crab meat fried rice yellowtail tartar tuna tartar salmon sashimi beef tataki  Everything came out perfect. The tartar was so yummy, we had to order both the tuna and the yellowtail. The salmon sashimi was the best I've had thus far, it was so buttery and fresh. Our bill came out around ~$70 because we ordered two large beers, but it was definitely worth it for the quality. I'm probably going to come back here every time I'm in Vegas now.  It's located in a small plaza with limited parking during dinner time.",

They also have an area where shoes aren't allowed! The atmosphere was fast paced and loud and I loved it.   We ordered a sushi roll, a yellow tail tar tar, and beef tataki. All were absolutely fresh and phenomenal.   We had a bottle of sake as well. It was super yummy!   I Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Izakaya in Vegas? Sure, why not?  Some of the advantages about coming here early (like 5 PM when the store just open) are plenty of available parking spaces and none of crazy waiting line. Nothing superb about the service, staffs got the job done and we all got our food in an orderly fashion.   31. Garlic Baby Bokchoy (stir-fried baby bokchoy with garlic soup - $3.95): Simple and decent dish. Tasted just like how my mom would cook it - garlic soup wasn't too crazily salty, but I do think $4 is a bit pricey.   45. Kushi-tan (most tender beef tongue - $2.25 each): A huge hit. Beef tongue was grilled perfectly with just the right seasoning. Now that's something you don't get to enjoy everyday.   52. Black Cod Fish Fillet (Black cod fish [butterfish] marinated with miso-sauce - $9.95): Definitely a miss for me. Texture is pretty good, but simply too salty. I would rather exchange one black cod for four beef tongues.   91. Ichiza's Ramen DX (Ichiza's ramen with kakuni and half egg, half size): A hit for me. This ramen reminded me of champon ramen at Hana Ichimonme in Los Angeles (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/hana-ichimonme-restaurant-los-angeles\">yelp.com/biz/hana-ichimo...</a>). Broth is milky and flavorful. Kakuni wasn't too bad and I can taste vegetable in the bowl here and there. Not the most amazing ramen, but I was pretty impressed with it.   More hits than misses - just stick with Yelp's recommendation and you will have an enjoyable experience.",

I'm always neutral about this place because I haven't had a dish that makes me drool when I think about the place.   Okay let me get to my complains first. The waitress that served us yesterday was rude and idiotic. She was short and annoyed from the start when she was taking order of the drinks. And my second complain was they charged $3.50 on the damn green tea but you can't get refills which makes absolutely no sense to me. Third complain was they charged us a fee to have birthday cakes. They don't even serve cakes in there and they are not a high end restaurant. It's ridiculous to me why they would charge a fee.  They have a lot of stuff written on the wall that's not on the menu. If you go to this place, make sure to read the wall too.   I like tacoyaki( octopus with batter and fried), tofu and tuna salad, kimchi pork, grilled octopus and their assorted skewers.   Their food is not bad but at the same time not the greatest either. I still love Raku the most. I don't think I will return here anytime soon with this kinda service unless someone else wants to go.",

I came with about 14 of my girlfriends and they were able to accommodate our table right away as there was plenty of seating. The waitresses are very friendly and prompt. I ordered the ramen DX and I highly recommend it! I wish it had a spicy option but I was able to add some peppers in it to get that kick I wanted. I definitely would come back and get that bowl again. The portion is very large so it might be a great one to share with someone while you order other appetizers to share. My friend ordered for us the tom yum sushi roll- which is killer! It has a tangy, sour taste which reminds me of the soup itself. I'm not sure how they make it but it's one of my favorites. I didn't see it on the menu under sushi and sashimi but i'm sure if you order it they'll gladly make it for you. It comes with shrimp tempura, cilantro and lime zest. I didn't order much else but will surely be back to try other dishes!",

Sadly their past success has now been replaced by disappointment.  What used to be quick friendly service is now slow and indifferent.  During my last visit after a 50 minute wait I had to flag down my server to get a refills and get our order in. Our food came out in waves and thus not everyone at our table was able to start/finish at the same time.   As a well publicized repeat offender with the Health District, I am starting to thick twice about stepping foot inside here. The food quality has dropped off noticeably as well. My chicken and egg bowl was close to room temperature when I got it and a few of us noticed the reduced portion sizes.  What used to be the darling of foodies looking for their Japanese fix, Ichiza has been spiraling downwards for sometime and I hope they can clean up their act.",

Lots of delicious, small plates that are meant to be shared with others.  I came in a group of 6 people and ordered almost half the menu. The most memorable items were the ones not listed on the menu, but scribbled all over papers on the walls. My favorite dish was the wasabi octopus--raw octopus cut into bits and in a wasabi sauce--DELICIOUS. Other memorable items were the shabu shabu salad, grilled octopus, agadashi tofu, griled chicken gizzards, grilled beef tongue. The small plates allow you to try a bunch of different thing as they range from about $1-$10 per plate.   This place is located upstairs inside a plaza and can be spotted from the street. Look for the letters in yellow. Tons of parking but can get pretty hectic as multiple restaurants are located inside this plaza. Try the back if no parking in the front.",

We started with edamame and sashimi salmon. The sashimi salmon was very good. When eaten it just melts in your mouth! So delicious. We then ordered the yakitori (skewered chicken) and let me tell you, that was one of the best yakitori I've had! It was very well prepared. Then we shared the jumbo meat patty steak (one of their specialties). The sauce on it was so amazing! It really complimented the whole plate. And for our last order, we got the fried calamari. One of the best calamari I've ever had and I always order calamari at every Japanese restaurant I visit (highly recommend).

Unless you're able to reserve the low table tatami seating in the back, don't come with a large group b/c the restaurant is pretty tiny.",

    "text": "Don't get me wrong. I LOVE ICHIZA and have been here probably hundreds of times no joke. But seriously, how many times can they get shut down due to failing of inspection from the health department???  I think it's like 6 or 7 times in the last few years. Tried to go there 2 nights ago and it was shut down AGAIN.   As much as I love the food there and I know most people do too and probably don't care they kept getting shut down as long as they get back and running again soon, so we can all enjoy their chicken skewers and honey toast....etc. Doesn't it make you wonder if I (or we) should keep going to eat at a place that clearly doesn't give a crap about their cleanliness and what are they feeding us?????  Ugh. Get your stuff together and clean up for good!  Please. So we can all enjoy yummy food with a great piece of mind.",

This time we added salmon belly, garlic book choy, and stir fried pork with napa cabbage and shitake mushroom. All are yummy! The salmon belly melts in your mouth the second you put it in. And of course you have to end it with the honey toast! I don't give 5 stars because the place is always too crowded and they're always overwhelmed. You always have to get their attention every time you need something.",

I love coming here because you can order a bunch of items and not get toooo full because the plates are smaller. Many of the great items are on the wall so be sure to check them out!  We got:  Yellowtail Tar Tar: My all time fave. Even after all these years of being away, they still do it right. The bf isn't the biggest fan of yellowtail and liked this.. so that should say a lot!  Miso Butterfish (black cod): AMAZING as always! We had to order two so we wouldn't fight over it. It's THAT good!   Asparagus Bacon: Mehhh... could do without next time.  Baby Octopus: too salty. pass!  Fatty Tuna: Delish!! For $18 you get I think 5 pieces and they were soooo melt in your mouth wonderful.   Seared Tuna w/ponzu: This was good until we got the fatty tuna.. haha   Honey Toast: Simple and scrumptious! Get two scoops of ice cream if your SO isn't in to sharing *ahem* you know who I'm talking about! lol  On a Saturday night around 9 there was no line. If you come during regular dinner hours be prepared to wait!",

Good thing I did becauSe there would have been a wait. It is a restaurant w sushi, seafood  Small tapas, etc, so my friend and I ordered a bunch of stuff all At different times.  I was impressed w the service. Waitstaff Is great, and the food comes out fast.   My friend ordered most of the food So I can't really tell u everything we got. I did not like the vegetable Pancake very much so I will not get that AgAin. I loved the seaweed salad !! And The honey toast was delicious! I wish this spot was 24 hour because I would totally come here after a night of drinking to eat the honey toast.   I wish I had gotten all of our servers' names. They were awesome and deserve recognition. It was very busy and a lot going on, And none of our orders were ever forgotten. I served tables for many years and I know how hard it is during a dinner rush.   5/5 stArs, I will definately be coming back and I will bring my friends and family :)  Ps. Parking sucks. Park in the shopping center next door and walk over !!!",

We shared a table with another quartet.  We ordered too much, but it was all great.  The food came out as it got ready - fine by us who were starving, so order was a little random.  Pork Udon, beef bowl, beef curry, squid - fried rings and grilled whole, pork katsu - all great, none tasted like restaurant food, but like home (if your home was Japan).  Want to go again today!",

The instant you go inside you're surrounded by dozens of hand written signs in japanese with english sub-titles below it with prices (and some with pictures). I could not decide what to order so just went crazy and ordered anything that seems tasty. Came around 1 AM and the place was still packed.  (1) Nasty --- (10) To Die For  - Whole Spanish Mackeral sashimi. (8) - Breaded meatballs. (7) - Deep-Fried Garlic. (7) - Green-Tea ramen. (5) - Special super Eel sushi Roll. (9) - Sour Stir-Fried Noodles. (6) - Grilled Chicken Yakitori. (8) - Grilled Salmon Collar. (8) - Honey-Ice cream Toast. (10)  The sheer amount of options you have is staggering and I can't wait to come back next time I'm in Vegas.  Tips: Order off the walls, the menu is ok, but the specials are much more adventurous. It's not catered towards american taste as much as other japanese restaurants, so don't be surprised if it's not what you expect when you order the same dish as your usual japanese place. Must, must, must try the honey ice cream toast. Have fun, try new dishes. =)",

    "text": "I USED TO love this place.  I USED TO enjoy coming here and even have to wait for a table to open up.  The service USED TO be better!!!  However, my friends and I have noticed a BIG decline in their service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The servers (mainly women) \"pretend\" to NOT understand what you say or ask for.  I think it is ridiculous that after you have been seated, you have to wait more than 15 minutes before someone even comes up to your table to take your drink order, much less your food order...which we always already know what we want to order since we have been regulars here for a long time now and always take guests from out-of-town for the food.  Don't get me wrong, the food is still great, which is the only reason that I still come.  But food quality and busyness of the establishment IS NOT AN EXCUSE FOR BAD SERVICE!!!!!!!  This review is clearly all over the place, but I am extremely angered and disappointed about my experience here with a friend last night, because we came specifically for the food, which we were craving!!!!!  But what did we get, BAD SERVICE again!!!  First of all, after we were seated, we made several attempts to try to get a server's attention (and even the guy at the front who looked like he was in charge of seating people, and also the same guy who made eye contact with my friend who was trying to motion him that we were ready to order but just seemed to ignore us for the next 10 minutes).  Finally, we got the attention of a server to let her know that we were ready to order, so she went and got another server to take our order, who then never came back to check on us the rest of the night.  Their wait staff just seems so disorganized, because different girls kept walking by and our food was brought out to us by various girls.  We ordered our food all at once because we knew it would take a long time to get a second order in if we wanted.  Our food came, some items before others; so we ate, pretty much taking our time and enjoying our food, during which time no one came up to ask if we needed anything or to refill our waters or my hot tea.......but instead, three times three different servers did come up to take a bowl that was pretty much empty but had more sauce in it which we were still working on, but without asking if we were done with it and just trying to take it off our table.  I mean, JUST ASK FIRST if we are done before taking plates away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  SO ANNOYING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Then, we still had two more dishes that we were waiting for, which my friend had asked two servers to please check on the remainder of our order.  But I don't think they even did.  Because when we were almost done with our meal and pretty much full, we still hadn't gotten our last two dishes.  So, my friend asked another server to cancel our orders of the tempura and butterfish (which the girl said, \"ok let me check\"....but we countered and said, \"can you just please cancel the orders because he have been waiting for it and we are almost done eating here\").....but she still went to go check on the order (which again, we had asked them two times prior to check on while we were mid-way thru our meal)......then immediately, she came back with both dishes.  My response to her was \"oh, how convenient that when we are almost done and ask to cancel our order, you bring it out right away\"....she just smiled and shrugged.  OBVIOUSLY, they hadn't forgotten about our order, because she brought them out too quickly, which made us believe that our food had been done and it was simply due to the sloppy service and inattentiveness that they brought the rest of our order to us that late......much less why my friend's shrimp tempura was already soggy when she got it!  INEXCUSABLE SERVICE, which is why we didn't feel the least bit sorry when we decided to leave a tip of less than 10% of the bill.  I MEAN REALLY....... I totally get that you guys are always busy.  But you should already be used to it and train your employees better, as far as being more organized and ready for such a rush.  Also, with that many people on staff (I'm thinking there were at least six servers last night, which if you think about how small the place is, should be enough to cover the tables and provide better service and attention to your customers), no one should experience such CRAPPY SERVICE!!!!!!    I now come for the food alone and NEVER WILL I EXPECT GOOD SERVICE FROM ICHIZA'S.......which overall should make for a bad review!  Places like this, who really have a huge following and whose food is exceptional and worthy of coming back to, should be ashamed when they don't deliver in quality of service....and even more so when their SERVICE SUCKS OVERALL!!!!!!!",

    "text": "Amended on 10/11/2010: Went there a second time this past weekend and tried more dishes. Still didn't get close to tasting everything. But what we did try, was delicious.   The simple sashimi we had was fresh and full of flavor. My friends had 1/2 order of Ramen, and it looked very tasty.   Oh, also, they open up an hour earlier now. I think the new hours are 3:00 pm - 4:00 am. Weekend hours may vary.  -------------------------------------------------  I just went here for the first time (Aug. 2010). I've heard about this place for 1+ years, and finally made it. AND the food was very delicious and well worth finally eating here.  First, please note they are only open from 4:00 pm to 4:00 am. So you won't be eating lunch here. But you will be eating here after a late night of clubbing or gambling.   The menu is only one piece of letter size paper with both sides filled, but the walls are covered with plates not on the menu. Take time to look at all the photos on this review page, as well as on the walls. If you don't you're gonna miss out on a ton of other offerings.  We ordered the Uni in ponzu sauce and Tuna Tar Tar, both of which we not on the menu. But on the walls (and we ordered these because of the photos on this page).  The Uni was delicious, rich and flavorful, it is served in a lemon skin. the ponzu sauce and lemon really added to the flavor of the Uni.  The Tuna Tar Tar was served on what looked like tortilla chips, (they are not). The top chip was covered with the Tuna and avocado mix. And a second bottom chip housed a rice and lettuce mix. These are a little sloppy to eat (as the chips kept breaking apart for me), but nonetheless, they tasted great.  You will have to keep coming back to sample all the eats they have, cause there is just too many to eat for one visit.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.   Also, if you are a party of two, they don't take reservations for you, as they can usually accommodate you immediately or within a very short wait.",

    "text": "AN OFF THE STRIP HOLE IN THE WALL THAT WAS VERY SATISFYING...  During my best friend's bachelorette party weekend in Vegas, a fellow bridesmaid (who uses yelp religiously for good eat recommendations as well) suggested to dine here. Luckily we had a minivan that could pack in 9 girls and take a 10-15 minute drive away from the strip.  ICHIZA is located on the second floor of an Asian strip mall. In comparison to the other Vegas restaurants on the strip, this was definitely no fancy place (a bit of a hole in the wall) but definitely had character. Since we arrived early for dinner we got to eat in one of the two group tables in the back where you take your shoes off.  I can honestly say I've never been to a Japanese restaurant like this before....when we looked at the menu we were all a little taken back (I guess I'm a bit sheltered when it comes to authetic Japanese food).....what no bento boxes? no large sushi menu?.....then what do they serve? This place was everything but ordinary....On the walls they posted signs with the various small dishes that ranged from $2 to $6 and various things on the menu I've never heard off. Each lady ordered 2-4 mini appetizers or dishes and we all just shared everything. It was super fun getting to sample alot of things in one siting. We kind of played it safe because alot of the choices sounded a bit scary. From what I remember we grubbed on:  -Japanese style crab fried rice (yumm) -Kimchi with pork (This was one of my favorites) -Grilled mackarel -Grilled bacon wrapped Mochi (sounded so weird we had to try it) -Sweet grilled corn -Deep fried chow mein (kinda like pan fried noodles) -Fried calamari -Mini fried chicken pieces -A couple sushi speciality rolls (unagi & scallop) of the few choices they had -And can't forget about the famous HONEY TOAST (SWEET BREAD ALA MODE)!!!!....Note: It does takes about 15 minutes to cook and we ordered 3 seperate ones so that there was 3 people to each honey toast. This dessert really topped off the meal and is probably what pushed this to a 4 star review!   The waitresses were overall friendly but kind of hard to understand since I think they were more fleunt in Japanese than english. By the time we left the place, which was about 8:30pm on a Saturday night this small place was packed with several costumers waiting outside...so again it was comforting to know that it can be a popular place during peak dining times.  Although we were skeptical when we first walked in, this ended up being a memorable dinner with the ladies for $25 a person (which inlcuding us treating the bride to be). So if you are tired of the Vegas buffets, want something more authentic, wanna try something new, and have a car (as I don't thinnk it's necessarily worth a cab ride from the strip), I'd definitely recommend giving this place a shot if you wanna dine with all the locals.  THIS UNIQUE JAPANESE-STYLE TAPAS PLACE HIT THE SPOT!!!",

The menu selection included a wide variety of dishes. My family and I ordered udon, gyoza, chicken, and rice bowls. All in all it was we were happy. The portions of the food varied on what you ordered. Even when we took our order, our waitress shook her head and told as it wasn't even. So, we ordered more, taking her advice. It proved to be a good amount of food, and we finished it off. As a dessert, we ordered the highly raved honey toast. Let me tell you, it was HUGE! A giant glob of ice cream, drops of honey, and butter, all on a big cake-ish toast. It was more like a loaf than a slice.",

    "text": "This place is truly a different dining experience.  I guess that is why there are so many reviews.  I usually consider myself adventures with food, but this was totally different.  Thank goodness for yelpers!  If it wasn't for the other reviews, we wouldn't have known what to order.  Ichiza is located in a tiny strip mall with crappy parking.  It's upstairs, so if you didn't know to look for this place, you would never think to stop here for food.  Especially because there are about 3 other similar food places in the same strip mall.  This restaurant is tiny!  It has a few stools at the counter and then some low tables to sit on the floor and then a few regular tables at the front.  There is a menu and then there are food selections around on the walls that are written in Japanese with some English descriptions.    So we based our order on recommendations from fellow yelpers and they were right on.  I played it safe and had the beef bowl.  It was really good with a decent portion size.  We finished with the honey toast and I gotta say, that alone was worth the trip.  It's this dessert that looks like they baked a loaf of bread and cut it in half.  Then they cut a square out of the center so the outer crust is separated from the inner soft bread.  Then they pour honey inside and top it with vanilla ice cream.  WOW!  I highly recommend trying Ichiza!",

    "text": "you know you've been to vegas a lot when you start to venture off the strip. buffets and fine dining are great, but after a while you want to see what else is out there. a friend told us about this place on spring mountain, it's hidden on the second floor of a strip mall. inside it's all authentic izakaya.  i was unfortunately preparing for a juice fast when we came here, so i didn't gorge myself as i usually would have, but from the items i tasted, i know i will be coming here again and recommending it to friends!  we didn't have to wait on a saturday night, and the menu is pretty extensive. there are laminated papers and wooden plaques hanging every where with different menu items written on them, it's kind of fun to look around and see what other hidden treasure you've yet to taste.   the beef tongue skewer, butterfish, grilled squid, tofu salad with sashimi, and honey toast for dessert were stand-outs for me. the tongue was sliced thick, something you don't see a lot, and it was juicy and perfectly cooked. not chewy at all. the butterfish, aptly named, was melt in your mouth delicious. plenty of fat and collagen to make your lips literally smack. fire grilled squid can do no wrong. tofu salad is fresh and simple, and delicious. the honey toast, oh god, the honey toast. a dieter's nightmare, it is heaven in a box of toast, then covered in honey, and then topped with ice cream. what do i really have to tell you about it besides that?  we also had the yellowtail tartare but it suffered from too much rice (could've omitted it all together), the ramen must be pretty good since my friends got two orders of it, and the raw wasabi octopus, although not my favorite, was a huge hit with my table.   if you're looking for something different and more authentic, i would definitely make the short trip to ichiza from the strip, if not just for the honey toast  :)",

We were a bit afraid to order the fresh oyster, but did it anyway.  We did not regret it!  We ordered it with ponzu sauce and it was so heavenly and really fresh.  I haven't gotten sick from it yet, so it should be fine ;)  We also ordered the grilled smelt, tofu salad, stir-fried spinach w/enoki in garlic butter sauce, yellowtail sashimi, salmon steak, shiitake mushroom skewers, just to name a few.  I found it all delicious.  My favorites were the oysters and the mushroom skewers--so simple, yet so delicious.  The best part is that we were able to come here at 1:30am!",

    "text": "If you've ever had your mind blown to bits and pieces by a restaurant experience, then you will know how I felt by going to Ichiza.  I was in Vegas for a wonderful weekend with a group of friends, and honestly, this was the best part of my whole group's trip.  We drank merrily, soaked up the lively atmosphere, and stuffed our poor tummies with the most delicious of authentic Japanese food.  What a complete treasure, and I am so jealous that I don't have anything like this in Dallas.  My friends were weary at first, because they were wondering what I was dragging them into.  But I love doing my research before going to a town, just to see where all the locals eat.  I frequent Vegas at least 2 times a year, and although I've eaten at the most famous and luxurious restaurants, I really wanted to get off the strip for an authentic and (cheap) meal.  Jackpot.  Everything was delicious, from the tofu, to the fish, to the honey bread!  The sushi was wonderfully fresh, and the flavors of every dish we got were amazing.  We will definitely be returning.  The atmosphere, which might seem suspect since it's in a strip mall, is so charming and quaint.  The service is friendly, and the atmosphere is alive.  It's like everyone in the restaurant is so happy to be there, enjoying their little kept secret.    I suggest trying a little bit of everything off the menu.  You will not be disappointed.  But order that honey bread early, bc it does take a bit of time.",

The wilted Spinach with peanut sauce (?) was good, too -- but could be skipped.  The Chicken gizzards were good as well.   For desert we all (4 men) shared this sweet bread with ice cream on top, and there was still some left. Very Good!  The only turn-off (and the reason this isn't 5 stars) was while sitting you notice the cloth-covered seats showed all the \"history\" of the place, if you can imagine what I mean. Blech. But that's the price you pay for authentic Japanese.   Get off the strip and check this place out!",

If it isn't \"authentic,\" it certainly feels that way--on the second floor of a post-trendy strip mall with little else to attract you (though Zizzy karaoke bar downstairs has its charms).   Yes, there is a general standard sushi--ramen-robotayaki menu here, but that isn't what you should come for. What you should come for are the random daily specials that are posted on pieces of paper all over the walls, which could be...just about anything edible! Come to experiment, come to be daring, come to have fun. Service is friendly, by cute Japanese girls, though it's not necessarily helpful. I wouldn't necessarily recommend those with food allergies take their chances here.  And finish with the decadent honey toast dessert, big enough for...two? four? six!",

    "text": "A few doors down from Crown Bakery (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/crown-bakery-las-vegas\">yelp.com/biz/crown-baker...</a>) is Ichiza. Creative, packed, and a vast menu selection help this izakaya stand out from many other Japanese restaurants. Different menu items are posted Japanese style all over the dark walls. Tons and tons of them. Strips of paper with kanji and their English translations. It definitely has a great atmosphere.   Let's start off by saying that reservations are a must. This place was loud and packed. Additionally, from what I hear, it is always packed. The patrons are a eclectic hodgepodge of ethnic backgrounds. This is a place where the rules of \"see a bunch of Japanese in a Japanese restaurant, then it must be good\" is thrown out the window. It's because almost everything here is good, no matter who is eating it. I won't lie, it will help immensely to have someone who speaks Japanese though. We went off menu for one dish. Just a note that many of the dishes aren't just based in Japan. We ordered a (off)menu Kim Chee fried rice that was really good. One of those that you KNOW you'll have \"issues\" later on, but you eat it anyway.  So in addition to the fried rice, the Aburage, Karaage, Tofu Salad, and Tonkatsu were all good as well. None of them stood out as mind blowing, but they held their own. The Misoyaki Butterfish with Tempura Hasu was really light and let's say, \"buttery\" (duh) and flaky for lack of a better word. I'm not a butterfish guy myself, but this was really good. Add in the rarely served hasu and it was a winner. We also ordered the Hamburger Steak. For those of you that don't know, there are real differences in a HS from America and ones made like the ones in Japan. This one was more Japanese, with a spongy and fluffy texture, like if you added plenty of bread to the meat mix before making your patties. It's really really juicy and soft in texture.   The one misstep was my own \"bad.\" It was the Tataki Sashimi. This one was odd. It was different from all the tataki sashimi I have ever had. It was still on the skin and was chewy and difficult to separate from the other pieces. It was like it wasn't cut well enough to separate. It was also overly fishy. Definite thumbs down on that one, but it's all about trying things out. Right?  The final topper of the night was the Honey Vanilla Toast. It is really good and is similar to Shokudo (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/shokudo-japanese-restaurant-and-bar-honolulu\">yelp.com/biz/shokudo-jap...</a>) in Honolulu, but better. The toast is more crisp which to me makes all the difference between the two. Add on the fact that they dump gobs of honey into the toast cavity and you've got a delightful dessert. Although to fill up on toast at the end of a meal is a tall order. It's best if you have a large group to share.  The service is really good despite the fact that it's nuts inside with tons of patrons packed into a small restaurant and groups of people waiting outside. We were there late night as well.  Parking fills up fast during dinner, so I'd say make your reservations earlier if you can. Again, reservations are highly recommended.",

We ordered:  Shishito - big and has a bite to it, however, it wasn't grilled long enough.  Beef Liver - to thick, pasty and sticks to your tongue...aaahh  Grilled mackerel w/miso - full flavored but way too many bones and fats.  red snapper cappacio w/ponza - tasted like feet even with ponzu sauce. Salmon egg on top were slimy when you pick it up with your chopsticks, indication of not so fresh seafood  Chicken meatball - (appetizer given to everyone - chicken tasted good, but the sauce was COLD omg, who wants to eat cold meatballs???  Grilled whole squid - I like this, tentacles and all!  My bf wasn't too crazy about it either and said that we are way too spoiled when it comes to sushi since we've experienced the best in LA, nonetheless, I was really disappointed that it wasn't what I had hoped for. The worse part was walking in and there was a huge sign that they were out of Honey Toast!!!   This place was much easier to find than I thought, but if you're just visiting LV, there's a big chance you will not find a cab on your way back to the strip. We ran after a cab in a strip mall..",

I sat at the bar on both occasions. The hostesses are very kind also on the farewell. The servers have both been pretty good with their English and their manners, always smiling and happy to explain the menu. Of the things I've tried 1st visit... the ramen with pork it was delicious; the sashimi platter (great portions for one as a main meal); the Tuna Poki was soooo good!; the crepe with banana was great too. Had other items but can't remember! Everything was delicious though.  On my 2nd visit I was just craving sushi, so I went and tried to order a roll but on the menu there are only 3 rolls. So I asked the waitress, she pointed a the wall above the bar and there were the sushi rolls... in Japanese!  So I simply told her I'm allergic to shellfish and if the chef could make me a roll with fish such as tuna/salmon/yellowtail it would be great. She spoke to the chef and a few minutes later BHAM! the perfect roll! The chef is a psychic, I thought! Salmon/cucumber inside, rice outside, tuna/yellowtail on top outside, avocado and masago on top of the each cut piece. Just what I needed at 2AM! I just love the freshness and the texture of their fish, it's very high on the quality meter!  They have a good selection of Sake, beer, and wine (yumm!). I'm so lucky to live near China Town, I'll be coming back for more!",

Ahi Poki - Perfect blend of meaty ahi tuna, kelp, and [I believe] sesame and ponzu sauce.  Taste and texture was all there, fish was the freshest I've had for a while.  Seared Mackerel Roll - Meaty slabs of mackerel!  Rice was cooked just right.  DROOL...  Sakana Pinchos - Mistakenly labeled 'Pachinko' in the pictures section.  This is a perfect treat for those of you who wished for a meatier roll.  I am personally a carnivore, and couldn't have dreamed up a better roll.  Uni Roll w/ Squid & Beans - The pre-requisites for loving this roll are (1) You enjoy uni/sea urchin, and (2) You like the fermented beans.  I only satisfied #1, but I still really liked it.  Yellowtail Tar Tar - Excellent variation of a crunchy roll, comprised of something like a yellowtail \"poki\", crispy wonton wrap, and their awesome rice.  Honey Toast - If anyone has ever been to a Guppy House, and had the brick toast, it's the same concept.  It was good IMO, not amaze-balls, but a very good way to conclude the meal nonetheless.  I think that's it. It was freezing that night, so we saw a lot of ramen going around, and it looked and smelled good, so I guess I could recommend that too.  5 Stars. GO.",

You could get a meal here for 2 and not spend more than $20 with the tip included! Of course I'm a piggie so I tend to spend quite a bit more.  You can get anything from sushi rolls to udon to ramen to chicken katsu. The last time we went, I got the yellowtail tar tar, hamachi kama, spicy tuna spinach roll with fresh wasabi, grilled ika, eggplant and shrimp and a few other things I honestly can't remember. All were excellent. THEN came the Honey Toast! Frankly, I don't get excited for bread, ice cream and honey, but man was this delicious!! Definitely something I recommend!",

Ichiza.. please replace your cushions for the love of god.  NOW FOR THE FOOD!  GIZZARDS: super chewy, but nicely seasoned. DEEP FRIED BABY SPANISH MACKEREL: I think they gave us about 20 of these things. We dipped them in their spicy mayo concoction. Not bad, not bad at all. SPIDER ROLL, SPICY TUNA ROLL: Meh. Nothing spectacular. I found them pretty mediocre, even though fresh. UNI & SQUID ROLL (WITH NATTO): First, the uni was good, so was the squid, but the natto was awful. The spider-webby feeling was difficult to swallow. The smell was rancid. And under the uni was this raw potato mush that was super gooey. Definitely not my favourite. RED SNAPPER CARPACCIO: Not bad.. but it had that potato goo again. Bleh. YELLOWTAIL TARTARE: If you've been reading about this here on Yelp, you need to know this is like a Mexican-inspired tartar. The tuna is mixed with avocado and placed atop a fried tortilla sandwiching sushi rice and some fresh pico de gallo. It is a strange combo but it works. Really well. UNI SASHIMI: Delicious. Fresh. Tasty. BUTTER OF THE SEA! For $6.75 you get about six pieces of good uni. I was impressed. HONEY TOAST: Man. We devoured this friggin thing. The bread was perfect - had that chew you need to sop up the honey/butter/melty iced cream, and the outside was toasted nicely. Mmm.. thinking about it makes me want it.  Pricing: fair Service: good Place gets packed.. even after 9pm on a Thursday night.  P.S. Have fun reading their menu!!",

I love their yokitori!! The best I have ever had. I'm from the bay area and also Hawaii! I tried many Japanese restaurants in HI!, they are good, but also pricy! Bay area, sorry, so far I haven't found anywhere is satisfied! There's a good yokitori place called, Yakitori Kokko, foods are decent to above average, but somehow pricy, we spend about 50 each person each visit!   At Ichiza, foods are better. We had four people and  basically tried the whole menu! We ordered a lot! and ended up paying around a little over 20 each with tips. Of coz price is not the main part. foods are excellent. They have unique menu, and cook/prepare in a very authentic way! The uni w/ panzu is my fav!   anyway, long story short. It's not pricy, why not to gather 3-4 friends together and try the whole menu together? =]   Miss the food now, =[ will definitely be back.",

I completely forgot about the jalapeno fried rice, grilled squid and all these other delicious dishes until I read them off the wall again.   And I had some of the salmon sashimi and o.m.f.g.! It melted in my mouth. It was so good! Next time I have to remember to order some of that again.   MmMm! Everything was so good. Our bill wasn't too bad for four. It came out to about $98 and we ordered a lot of food plus dessert.  I keep remembering all the things I have to come back for... but I also have to remember all the things I need to try too.

As a half Asian I am not too concerned about service (it's a culture thing) and am used to waitresses that are too busy to really give you great service, having to share a table with other people, etc. But Ichiza has never done me especially wrong service wise.   What I love about this place is the variety, Not only food-wise but price-wise as well. There are tons of things to choose from and if you want to get full for around $10, you can. If you are feeling a bit more fancy and can to spend more to get a couple dishes, you can.   I never get tired of going here because there is always something new to try (plus so many things that I have not yet tried). I have heard from other friends that the food quality has gone down, but in truth I have not really noticed it.   Love it!",

My friend who lives there recommended Ichiza, but didn't tell me that it was on the second floor of a Las Vegas Chinatown strip mall.  When you enter, it is a small place, but they make good use of the space and somehow have configured the tables to maximize customers.  Since our party was six, we were seated in one of the tables where it looks like your sitting on the floor but your actually seated like on a bench.   The menu items look unusual and not your usual tonkatsu, shrimp tempura, vegetable tempura, etc.  The dishes are mostly ala carte so you can enjoy your meal family style, but some people might want to eat their meals in a \"set\" style.    I had the salmon steak with a California roll sushi and both were very good.  Salmon steak looks basic but had lots of flavor.  The oyako donburi were pretty good sized bowls with lots of flavor.   Be prepared for a crowd if you go there on there as this place appears to be a local favorite.",

    "text": "Unfortunate circumstances left us at UMC all afternoon and evening without any food and by 1 AM we were starving. Ichiza was open late night and any hunger pains we had were definitely curbed. We can add another location to our late night options.  There was no wait when we arrived at 1 AM on an early Wednesday morning, with the bar, community table, and the all of the booths except for one being occupied. The servers were running around at a hectic pace, yet were still able to greet us immediately and provide great service for the entire meal. They were moving so fast that I didn't have a chance to ask what they gave us for a complimentary appetizer. The menu is large and covers a wide spectrum of food, but items are numbered to make the ordering process simple with less room for error. A daily special menu is given to add to the difficulty of narrowing down what you want.  We were hungry, so we wanted to try as many things as possible: Ichiza's ramen DX, chicken and egg bowl, garlic chicken gizzard, beef tataki, salmon carpaccio, and beef tongue, chicken gizzard, and chicken skewers. There was no extensive wait for the food and my wife and daughter polished off the chicken bowl and ramen pretty easily. My wife gave the entire piece of kakuni from her ramen to me and it was so tender and flavorful. The Copper River king salmon carpaccio was my favorite for the night. I'll always take the bait for king salmon.  For dessert, the honey toast is the way to go, the large order was way too much for us three. If you're running low on stomach space by the end of your meal, the small version is the better option. $65 was the price tag for our late night dinner with the raw items being the most costly. For a late night option, we had a satisfying meal and will definitely keep Ichiza on the radar.",

Service: 4/5 I came on a Wednesday night in a party of 4 and we were seated after a five minute wait, even though the place was packed. I thought this was not only a good sign of the food, but also of the quick service.  Interior: 3/5 I thought the interior was really cute but there was an evident coat of dust on the ceiling ornaments.  I ended up trying the ika-yaki (whole grilled squid), sakana pinchos (sushi roll), shrimp tempura bowl, and the honey toast.   Ika-yaki: 4/5 Cooked to perfection. Not chewy at all, but tender. I thought the flavor was too subtle for my taste since I like my food to pack a punch, but it was still really good.  Sakana pinchos: 3/5 Presentation was on point, but all of the flavors didn't necessarily go well together. The tamago was really good, but everything else was just okay.   Shrimp tempura bowl: 3/5 The shrimp tempura bowl comes with four pieces of shrimp on a bed of white rice and drizzled with tempura sauce. Although it was good immediately served, it became soggy really quickly from the rice and the sauce.  Honey toast: 4/5 Super huge brick toast with two scoops of ice cream and a generous amount of honey. I shared this with three other people and it was enough for all of us! I made my boyfriend eat my portion of the crust, while I enjoyed the nice and gooey inside ~  Price: 5/5 I thought it was really, really reasonably priced for the quality of the food and especially for Japanese tapas. For 8 items, the bill came out to $75.   Overall: 4/5 The selection of items is overwhelming. You have the main menu, today's specials, and the numerous items posted on the walls. Usually, a large menu may indicate that they value quantity over quality, but this place does both. I'd definitely come back to try all this place has to offer.",

There has to have been an ownership change. We will not be returning.",

My must order list:  -Red snapper sashimi/carpaccio -Yellow Tail on tortilla chip w/ rice & pico de gaillo (can't remember what this one's called) but it's on their menu -Buta Kimchi -Fried Quail Eggs -Spinach & Enoki Mushrooms in garlic butter  I will occasionally deviate from my favorites and try something dangerous. Everything is good, but my belly is only so big, so I have to be picky. -Tuna Tartar w/ quail egg on half avocado (exactly as it is described) no frills -Sea Urchin w/ ponzu, again very simple, no frills -wasabi green beans, this one was \"meh\" just tempura greenbeans  Take a Pass on these items: They are Good mind you, but not their specialty. -kimchee fried rice -all ramen bowls -kushiyaki: gizzards, hearts, tsukuni. It's always tough, I've tried several times  Come early, or late, this place is always packed. Good news it's open till 2:30am!",

    "text": "Probably one of my favorite Japanese restaurant in Vegas.   Environment: the restaurant is very traditional, they have table seating, bar seating, and a large table where you sit pretty close to the floor. The restaurant is very social where people can enjoy good food, but also have some sake and beer. Every time I have been here, there has been some groups that are drinking pretty hard (I can't like, it is probably me every other time)  Service: they don't have too many waiters or chefs, but they all work really hard and bring the food out quickly as well as get to your table to get new order and provide you with water.   Food: I absolutely love the food here. It really reminds me of Japan. They have a variety of options, and similar to restaurants in Asia, their menu is everywhere from the menu in the booklet to the ones on the wall. Also don't get appalled when you see the menu, the food is also faded in the picture so it is hard to imagine what food you are ordering. I usually order a lot here, and with the tapas nature, you can try a lot of food. Everything here is super fresh and I love the sake here, doesn't have that soy sauce taste.   Overall, I suggest everyone to try this restaurant whether you are from or visiting Vegas. It is a great spot to socialize and enjoy different foods. The price is pretty fair for it's quality as well. Definitely worth trying!",

On our last visit we were the first customers in at opening and we ended up being the only ones in there the entire time. We were very disappointed and noticed that the place has gone down hill in terms of cleanliness and atmosphere. The main sushi chef who we were seated right in front of and has seen as many times, was very aloof and did not bother to even acknowledge our presence, in spite of having always left 25% tips. Food was not fresh and was poorly prepared. In addition to  our large food order, wife had two large beers and I ordered iced tea. The iced tea was it a very small glass with little ice and to my amazement when I asked for more I was told they do not give free refills on iced tea . We are locals and have never experienced this in any restaurant in our entire lives that was definitely the end for us  we're spending $75 in their restaurant and leaving 25% tips and that's the way they  choose to treat us??? They obviously don't value their customers. They need to learn that there are an increasingly large amount of new, nice restaurants opening on Spring Mountain, in addition to those already there to choose from. GOODBYE FOR EVER TO THEM!!",

I came here with 12 people and they sat us at a large table, and we were asked to take our shoes off so this place is super authentic. I have been to Japan but don't speak Japanese but it would help if you do when ordering. Their menu is not that large but they have specials hanging all over their walls, and I would highly recommend ordering from their wall specials. My two favorite items were the 4 mushroom stir fried in garlic butter and the chicken Katsu, both were delicious and stick out after a night of drinking. The service was awesome as well and our waitress was very attentive. The only thing I didn't like was the honey cake desert but other people at my table loved it so to each his own.",

We had the live fish three eats which consisted of sashimi, nigiri, and choice of fish bone miso soup or fried fish bone.  The kinds of fish they brought in from Nagasaki were mostly white fish like breams.  I prefer the softer melt in your mouth kind like aji.  The fish was quite fresh, however, unlike yellowtail or aji, whitefish typically lacks in flavor.  It was very mild.  The fried fish bone was a disappointment as it wasn't deep fried enough that you can eat the entire bone.  I ended up with a mouthful of bones so I would not recommend this but chose the fish bone miso soup instead.  Other dishes I recommend would be the fried squid cartilage, broiled squid, and salmon kama.",

It's not so good during peak hours because you will wait a long time.    The food is not quite 5 stars but I think it's my fault because there are so many menu choices that I didn't know what was best to order.  Also, my expectations were super high after reading all the stellar reviews.   I'm still a fan because the flavor of the food was good, there's enough menu variety that I need to come back and the value is fantastic.  Ramen had a nice broth and the uni was fresh as well as the few fish dishes we ordered. The honey toast was delicious.   Service was good.",

The only thing that was really weird is that their full menu is not on the menu they hand you. They have parts of the menu posted on the walls/chalkboards, so we had to get up to read them. That was strange... I was like hovering over a group of people seated at their tables, enjoying their food. But anyways, I got a grilled fish - so good. Baby bok choy - simple but delicious. Yellowtail tar tar - deeeelicious. Honey toast - wow, some parts were completely saturated with honey, and other parts not so much. it was so saturated to the point that we couldn't eat it, except for C who has a crazy intense love affair with honey. It was good, but the ice cream to toast ratio was not high enough imo. I wouldn't get it again.  We could have easily come back for another meal.",

It is a bit overwhelming, but everything is priced so reasonably, that you can easily order a few (or several) things and still pay less than you would on the Strip.  I ordered the crab fried rice (yum), the deep fried octopus (same thing as fried calamari), and sampled a bunch of things that my friends ordered (raman, grilled squid, mackerel) . I was pleased with everything. They also have an extensive sake menu. I tried the \"reisling style\" sake, and the presentation was very strange. My glass was inside of a little box, and she overfilled the sake glass so it overflowed into the box. So, when I finished my glass, I just poured the liquid in the box into my glass. Odd... The sake actually tasted just like Reisling, so it wasn't really worth $10, but oh well...  Next time, I'll be more adventurous and order some other, less conventional, items. I enjoyed my time here, though!",

Back in Hawaii izakaya eateries are common, being heavily influenced by Japanese culture and all, so I did not expect a GOOD authentic izakaya restaurant like this, in Vegas! I honestly loved the food and atmosphere and would not hesitate to eat here again and again.  Anyway, we ordered a ton of food. No nigiri sushi here, or at least the night we visited, but the sashimi and grilled items were so delicious. I won't list everything but these were my faves: beef tataki, hamachi sashimi, pork belly w/ shiso skewers, red snapper carpaccio, miso butterfish, pork ramen, grilled garlic, and shiokara. There was so much more from the menu that I wanted to try but I could not fit any more food in my tummy!  Prices are really reasonable compared to other izakaya-style places I've been to. And the cozy atmosphere made me feel right at home. It was a busy night, but the waitresses were really friendly and helpful.   Will see you soon, Ichiza!",

I wanted to take the Lover for a nice authentic Asian food experience. During our stay in Las Vegas, I searched for places where the locals eat and stumbled upon Ichiza. When we got there, the place was packed for dinner. There were menus scattered all over the four walls, all written in Japanese with English translations for some. To make this short and simple, we ended up visiting Ichiza twice during our week-long stay in Sin City. It was THAT good.  Below are what we managed to taste at Ichiza:  Potato crisps = with a mayo wasabi sauce dip. A complimentary appetizer we got for our first visit.  Skewered sweet peppers = It was a little bitter for my taste but it had some nice texture and worked with the Sapporo.   Skewered beef tongue = Oh, I really can't express how good this one is. You just have to find out for yourselves. Perfectly seasoned.  Garlic grilled baby bok choy in soup =  I'm on a mission to perfect this dish. Had a little bit of fresh crunch on the outside but perfectly steamed inside. The soup broth was AMAZING. It is really mouth-orgasmic.  Beef tataki with ponzu sauce = again, AMAZING. The beef was so fresh and tender that it just melts in your mouth. Well seasoned and you can taste the layers of flavor. Definitely a MUST-HAVE at Ichiza. FYI, I don't even like rare beef!  Skewered beef livers =  I can eat this for days. Don't be scared to try it. I promise you'll never look at beef livers the same way again after tasting this one.  Stir fried chicken gizzards with garlic sprouts = the Lover's favorite. He finished 70% of the plate. The lemon juice really complements the dish. An awesome \"pulutan\" (finger-food, often served alongside alcoholic beverages) for those of you who just want to enjoy a couple of Sapporos.  Kaku-ni = Deeply boiled diced pork belly with egg. So bad for you but it was sooo delicious.   Red bean mochi ice cream = I think this one might just be the best mochi I've tasted in a while or maybe I might have just forgotten how awesome they taste.  Fried whole garlic bulbs = The Lover insisted on getting these. It was flavorful but I wasn't a fan of smelling like garlic afterwards.  Sushi = We ordered an assortment of fish from mackerel to tuna to squid. Fresh, melts in your mouth sushi. Nothing fishy here.  Sweet honey toast = SO GOOD. Definitely a perfect way to end a meal here at Ichiza.   You can find some of the photos on my page. Enjoy!",

    "text": "So I was here on a business trip and the regional team in Vegas asked me what I wanted to eat.    Vegas buffets were out since I'm trying not to eat my weight in food and all I really wanted was some yummy sushi.  So while they briefly considered taking me to a sushi buffet where I could also eat my weight in food, I'm glad they decided to take me to Ichiza instead.  Now, I was a little skeptical.  Even though I wanted sushi, sometimes I know that sushi in a landlocked state can be...questionable.  But this is Vegas, and goodness it was good!    SO!  Let's start off with the fish quality.  It was absolutely delectable!  I know places along the coast that don't have fish as fresh as Ichiza.  The sashimi was delicious and the couple of sushi rolls that we did have were creative and had great flavor.  I'm not sure what the name of the roll we got was, but it was on the wall.  It was something with eel and a fried sweet potato and a California roll.  Sounds a bit odd, but really it went together really well.  The spciy tuna roll was not particularly spicy, which is a good thing for me since I can't handle the heat.    We also got the shrimp fried rice and that stuff is addicting.  I mean, I was trying to stay away from it but I kept winding up with more on my plate.    The beef tataki in ponzu sauce was great as well, but not exciting enough to write home about since we have similar quality things back home.    This place gets packed so get there early, but when I'm in town and want sushi, I'm definitely coming back here.",

    "text": "Ichiza is the most authentic Japanese food in Vegas.  That is from a Japanese friend of mine.  I have been going there for about 10 years.  I like authentic atmosphere and sometimes that means \"attitude\" when in china town, but not this place.  Some language barrier, but I like that aspect.  It makes me feel like I am actually doing something cultural in Vegas.  Food is amazing.  Waitstaff is always smiling.  Always on target with delivery and timeliness.  Their deserts are famous but I'm not really that into desert.  Favorites Ikayaki (grilled squid), tofu salad, and the draft Asian beer is good.  All the rolls are good but they don't focus on rolls.  All sorts of fun things and menu changes daily.  Very casual, picnic tables and shared large tables.  Really loud chatter makes it fun too.  I should knock off a star for a restroom without a locking door and only one person can go in at a time.......?  Hello ?  Seriously.  But it is my favorite restaurant so I have to give it full 5 stars.",

    "text": "Perfect place to go when you want to try Japanese food that doesn't have the words \"teriyaki\", \"sushi\" or \"roll\" attached. I've been to Ichiza on a couple of occasions, and each time the place has been busy. Add to that fact, the restaurant is small with limited seating; but people don't seem to mind because the food is good and the atmosphere is unique. Ichiza isn't trying to win people over by turning up the \"fancy\" switch like some Japanese restaurants do; they are about serving their customers authentic Japanese cuisine. The regular menu is nice, but the real reason why people keep coming back to Ichiza (besides the Honey Toast) is the special Japanese \"tapas\" menu written on paper and then attached to the walls.   I guess I don't practice what I preach because on my most recent visit here, we ordered strictly from the regular menu.   First up, an order of Takoyaki- 6 balls of dough, similar in consistency to pancakes, but crispy on the outside and soft (almost undercooked) in the inside, and filled w/ pieces of octopus and veggies. Topped w/ Japanese mayo, takoyaki sauce & bonito flakes. Yummy! Perfect snack food.   Next, we ordered a bowl of Ramen- lots of veggies, large delicious pieces of char siu (pork), full-bodied broth & nicely-cooked ramen. No complaints  Finally, we ended our meal w/ Monjayaki (We wanted Okonomiyaki at first, but they didn't have it and recommended this dish instead)- a thick pancake w/ fried eggs on the bottom, kimchi and pork in the middle, and topped w/ the same Takoyaki toppings. This was my least favorite dish of the evening. It wasn't memorable, but it wasn't bad. It was just a so-so dish, and definitely on the heavy side.   I've tried the Honey Toast here, and while definitely Yummy w/ a capital Y, it's a very easy dish to make at home at a fraction of the cost.   If you're in Vegas, you have to check out Ichiza (at least once). Don't miss out on the hottest thing to happen to Chinatown...",

    "text": "Great and yummy as ever.  The interior is decorated very True to Japanese tradition, service is friendly and consistent, menu has a variety for casual and adventurous eaters alike.  For starters, I had the grilled pike fish, which I ordered accidentally but it was still tasty anyways, thankfully.  I helped myself to a dish of Smelt Fish which is probably my favorite dish on the menu.  Next, I had Fried Rice with mushrooms and veggies, and the sauce had a silky texture to it.  It was weird, but it didn't taste bad either.  Ended the night with some strawberry mochi and the bill came out to be about $40 for two people.  Very reasonable!  The only con I would have is that the waiting time can be a little long.  I went there around 6:30pm and it wasn't very crowded, and yet it still took us about 15-20 minutes to get our first dish.  However, the food is a yummy experience, and the location is just right off the Strip in Spring Mountain so it's a perfect place to eat before heading out to play in the night time.  Definitely one of my favorite joints to eat after I've been out all night.  PRO: Service is great, food is awesome, vibe is energetic CON: Wait time for food can be a bit long",

But after eating here a couple times, I really don't care if the correct nomenclature is applied because the food is just so damn good.  Rolls: Amazing!  And there are soooooo many to pick from!  The deep-fried California roll is super yummy.  The Rainbow roll is missing avocado ... All the other Rainbow rolls I've ever had included avocado, but the one at Ichiza was missing this CA favorite.  Still yummy though. Drinks: Everything from draft beer to plumb wine and soju drinks  ;) Wall menu: Branch out and pick a menu item off the wall.  Trust me, just do it.  Start with the tar-tar yellowtail.  You might ask, \"What's up with the menu stuff on the wall?\"  To that I answer, \"Who cares that the majority of the menu is on the wall?  It's all good, so pick something and eat up!\"  I'm slowly making my way through the wall menu one visit at a time ...",

    "text": "Oh snap, I just gave a 2-Star Review. Sorry, but I am not a fan of Ichiza. I realize many people will probably stare me down in disgust, but I will not be held to liking a place just because so many others do. Perhaps I am just not on board with the traditional Japanese dining experience this place supposedly offers. I am not a fan of the menu on the walls. Why can't I get a menu? They are hindering those of us who happen to have prescriptions, but sometimes do not like to wear our glasses for a night out, as was my case on the night I went here.   I went with a friend for her birthday (and I was picking up the bill, hurray!). She had been here many times before me, so I let her lead the way. First off I was incredibly disappointed with their service from the get-go. They offered us a table, but let us know that the table would be needed in about an hour for a large party that was coming in. Um, okay, then why offer us the table? Why not put us on a wait list for a table that is not going to be needed? ANYWAY, we figured we wouldn't take over an hour to eat since it was just the two of us and we were starving, so we took the table.  I had no idea what to order, and especially since I do not know Japanese food that well, the menu was a little scary for me. I mean, I am very apt to try things I've never heard of, but the server wouldn't even come around to explain some dishes. My friend ordered us a pretty decent salad. Something else that had a BUNCH of kimchee in it, which I quickly had a bite of and ignored.   Lastly, we ordered the Honey Toast dessert, which I absolutely adored and ate half of because I had had barely anything for actual DINNER.   Oh right - dirty silverware I had to have taken back and brought out to me, but waited for it for about 20 mins. This place is over-hyped and you can tell because it gets incredibly packed and very loud. The service is mediocre at best. All in all I would not make a return visit.",

And sure beats the Japanese options I had on the Strip.  My awesome friend took me here and we had a blast trying the small dishes - all very tasty and unique.  Sorry we didn't get to try the chicken gizzards and beef tongue!  ;)  The variety of dishes can be overwhelming as the choices are plastered along the walls, just like they are at izakayas in Japan.  I would certainly return to try more dishes - all very flavorful, cooked on the spot, and enjoyable.  One of my favorites was the Tofu salad with tuna sashimi.         -Tofu salad with tuna sashimi -Yellowtail tartar -Grilled shrimp -Fried chicken cartilage -Red snapper carpaccio -Pork and onion skewers -Beef tataki -Honey toast -Coffee jello with cream",

    "text": "I finally decided to finish up my review for Ichiza.  My first trip consisted of trying the ramen.  Here's what I had written for that visit:  \"The ramen at Ichiza isn't the best that I have had.  After visiting Monta so many times, I guess i was expecting something more flavorful.  The broth is pretty bland, although it is probably healthier than the Monta broth.  The veggies and meat were all fresh.  However, I like the noodles better at Monta as well.  This is more of an appetizer to share with friends rather than a main course meal.\"  My opinion changed after I went with a few friends, and we tried lots of stuff.  I didn't have time to record everything we ate, but I remember enjoying nearly all of it. We had a few rolls to start off with, california rolls, a sardine roll, etc.  These were pretty standard rolls, and very tasty.  We also tried a pork belly bowl, which we all thought was amazing!  It was so tender and had a perfect flavor.  The fried octopus was about the only octopus I have had that wasn't rubbery.  So many dishes, and all of them were great!    If you haven't been to Ichiza, go with a group of friends that like to try different things, and give this place a try.  It is a local Japanese favorite, and for good reason!",

Call that soup lines for those with too much to spend! Yes I know there are upscale restaurants like Fleur de lys etc but as I mentioned in other reviews I am no VC or hedge fund guy and I dont work for Google. I did not come to Vegas for punishment.  Viva Ichiza, YOU ARE A BREATH OF FRESH AIR IN THE DESERT!!!  Great authentic \"in ya face\" Izakaya style Japanese food. Fast and efficient service. Affordable prices. Fresh fish (in the desert?!?) YES!  Fresh tuna (as evidenced by the Tataki and Tekka makis) Order from the wall, that's the specialty du jour. Be adventurous.  Everything tastes good.  We had our Christmas eve dinner there, far from the madding crowd.  Lovely experience.  Word of caution:  For those who are not driving, request the hostess to get you a cab when you get the bill. Taxis will not stop on the street where the strip mall is, as the owner explained it to us. Also call ahead of time to see if they are fully booked, happens when there are trade shows (CES, Interop) where Japanese Kaisha-ens would flock to this place.",

I stood in front of owner/manager for about 5 minutes while waiting for some sort of hello, right after walking in. It was a bad start and I almost walked right out again.  The clientele range from loud, obnoxious tourists to pretty Cosplay girls and their Vin Diesel wannabee boyfriends.  The food was exceptional for the price. And I mean exceptional...for the price. It was tasty. Very cheap compared to LA. As was the alcohol. And there was not one thing that was not memorable. Service was super fast. Everyone was helpful and polite. And the manager completely redeemed himself by the end of the night.  All in all, I would live here if I lived in Vegas. 4 stars as a restaurant. 5 stars as a Japanese restaurant in the USA.  If you can deal with the sea of touristy idiots surrounding you, you will have a good time. Just listen to their conversations. Who knew that \"like\" was a verb, adjective and noun.

Repeated and gushy kudos to yelpers for making this place known, and as we stopped in yesterday, we were treated to a cornucopia of delicious and authentic Japanese cuisine;  a little sushi, a little asparagus wrapped in bacon (!), a tactile bowl of rice, chicken and egg and we left not only happy, but nearly deliriously so.  You sometimes feel like you're cheating the house when you hit up a genuinely and ethnically spot-on stop like Ichiza, but thanks to you guys who found this place first, it was totally worth the cab fare there and back.  If we had more time here we'd go back, and the next time we're in town, we are going back, definitely.  What a treat.",

If you go there as much as I do, you can get a 10%+ discount by joining their free membership.

You may want to bring binoculars to read them or walk around the tables to read it. You can plan a reservation 2 hrs ahead - that's what I do because the wait may be long on busy nights.",

I was on my wife's Blackberry searching for SUSHI in the remaining 3 hours i had before my 8PM flight back to SFO.  I didn't want to eat on the strip and I didn't want to eat at a restaurant I've tried before.  Doing a search for \"sushi\" in Las Vegas on yelp! brought up Ichiza in the top 10 listings.  The 13 reviews all with 5 STAR ratings set very high expectations.  So I recommended it to my cousins and wife that we try this place out.  I'm so glad we did because the food was excellent, the service was fast and friendly, and the prices reasonable!!!   Our party of 4 adults and 1 two-year old tried a lot for $85.     I had and enjoyed the:  Beef Curry ~$6.00  Okra Tempura - $4.50 Aspara-Bacon - ~$4.00 (?) Green Tea Ice Cream Sapporo Large   I would absolutely return!!!  It's worth the trip!  more laters...",

When I lived in Japan, gyudon was one of my FAVORITE things to eat. You could get it at truckstops, 7-11, and it was always gourmet status. I hadn't had much luck finding one that lived up to my expectations from Japan. It's so simple...but Ichiza managed to replicate it very nicely!  I was in gyudon heaven. Paired with some iced coffee and kirin, a bunch of fun side orders....and you're set. One of the best meals I have had in Vegas!!  Tip: Buy the cooks a beer...then you'll get the hook up!",

I was anticipating a long wait but when we got there, we were immediately seated at the sushi bar/counter. Im glad that I checked Yelp for suggestions before coming here since their menu is practically plastered all over the walls of the restaurant!  We ordered the Shrimp Fried Rice, Sakana roll, Uni in Ponzu Sauce, Mochi wrapped in Bacon, Fried whole Garlic, Chicken and Gizzard Yakitori.  The Uni and Sakana were sooooo good and by far are my 2 favorites from Ichiza. The Garlic was not strong and tasted really good with the salty paste it was served with. The chicken and mochi skewers were very tasty and moist!  Of course we have saved room for their famous Honey Toast which was absolutely to die for! The honey and vanilla ice cream were a perfect combination on top of the big crunchy chunk of bread.  This place also gives me a happy vibe and combining that with the good food for a great price, Ichiza earns 5 stars from me :)  We will be coming back to try other items on their menu the next time we are in Vegas!",

    "text": "Believe the hype.   I've been going to Ichiza for over 6 years, and for a damn good reason. It is a very popular, often packed Japanese Ikazaya restaurant. The joint is pretty small, as it can only fit no more than about 30-35 people at once. They presumably have close to 200 different options for food, and I have tried just about everyone of them. The enviornment is great, as its almost 50% of the reason why Ichiza is so great. Everyone simply comes to here to enjoy the great food, let loose, drink and have fun. Theres nothing more I can really say about this place except some the dishes I recommend you try at least once.   - Grilled beef tongue (Kushi-Tan) - Grilled garlic, deep fried whole garlic - yellowtail tar tar - red snapper carpaccio - bacon wrapped mochi - beef tataki - wasabi tempura stringbeans - skewered pork with shiso leaf - tako wasabi - fried oysters - and of course, the infamous honey toast.",

    "text": "I used to visit Ichiza more often when they weren't as packed. 5 years ago, at least, we'd go 2-3 times a month. Since they have become the darling of the Las Vegas Japanese food scene in the past few years, popping in unnanounced is nearly impossible. So yes, make reservations. Still expect to wait. Service can be slow, but friendly when they are packed and they -always- are. NOTE: This place really does feel like an izakaya in Tokyo. Packed, very very noisy and with many drunk, or getting drunk peeps here at night. So for me, not the best place to bring kids under 15 or 16. But, it is amusing to see the drunks get drunker and spend SO MUCH $$$ here. Good on them!  Food is great, no doubt about it. But, I always get the same thing: mabo tofu, gyoza or aspara-bacon skewers and honey toast. They do make the tastiest mabo tofu in Las Vegas, nice and spicy with just enough black beans used for a great, rich flavor that can't be beat.  The honey toast is well-loved for good reason: it's MAGICAL. So very simple, so rich, so perfect. it's waaayy too much for one person to eat, share it with your table or at least 1 other person. I tried to eat it by myself and got sick. The things I do for food...(I was sick in the very best way possible!)  Ichiza is great, but you'll wait. You will have a very noisy dining experience. You will be around lots of drunks. Go with that knowledge and you'll have a great experience!",

    "text": "I think these other reviewers have all the bases covered!  I give this place a rare 5 star only because it has no other competition to speak of in Las Vegas, as far as I know.   I have lived in Torrance, Tokyo and now live in West LA (near Sawtelle of course!), so I think I know a thing or two about Izakayas.  This place even has the specials on the wall and runs out of things as the night goes on like a proper Japanese place always does.  I think a lot of people have caught on to this place too, since it was pretty busy.  I think it is a good idea to make reservations.  I had made some, but arrived an hour early.  This place is really tiny, so if you make reservations, be so kind as to show up, because they actually put a sign up and keep standby customers waiting.  I am pretty tired of Hamada, that Japanese place in Bally's near the sportsbook or Sushi King (still sad to see that place go... sad to see the great Stardust shutdown in general) for my Japanese fix.  It is nice to have a pretty good alternative.  Incidentally, I found this place by looking in the phone book.  I just avoided all the Japanese restaurants that had tacky names that a normal Japanese restaurant would never use, such as \"Shogun\", \"Samurai\", \"Sumo\" or similar names.  One last thing, the prices are pretty reasonable as Izakayas go.  I went crazy and ordered a bunch of meat dishes such as gyu-tataki, shiro-maguro-tataki, katsu-o tataki (seeing a theme here?), a few drinks and bunch of other things for three and the bill was still around $100.  I was stuffed to the gills.  And yes, I do have a very hearty appetite.",

I think it's the perfect place to take a date.  Just grab an intimate seat for two at the Sushi bar, get a little sake action going, and get adventurous when you order!  I recommend the squid rings, not the fried ones though.  The Agedashi Tofu, the mochi bacon, which is just sticky rice wrapped in bacon, but it's so good.  You must order the three kinds of Sashimi, which is Yellow tail, Tuna, and Mackerel.  Just stay away from the Wasabi Octopus, or anything w/ Ramen noodles, opt for the Udon noodles instead.  And don't forget the Mochi Ice Cream...the perfect little sweet treat to share w/ your date!",

Don't know about you, but the last time I actually paid to eat facing a wall...Well never, so I certainly was not about to start now...It was kinda of obvious that my business was not wanted...I just walked out without saying anything...Too bad, cause the service was usually OK, but I kept coming back for the food...Now it seems like I will not come back for a while...",

Reasonable prices Tasty food Excellent service  I have taken many friends here (see MANONG P.) and they all come back. Its a good place to eat thats quick and easy, EVEN WHEN ITS PACKED!!! I have eaten here for almost 10 years and its the same as it ever was. They have all the classic Japanese late night food. Ramen Udon  Unagi  Beef Tongue Flied Lice Gyoza Soba Kara-age Lots of unique desserts I have recently heard of the HONEY TOAST...and its supposed to be another culinary gem.  NEXT TIME. They even have fresh SUSHI!!! I can say fresh because the place gets packed, so you know turnover is proper.  Anyways, my main dish of choice is the TEMPURA BOWL. Tempura deep fried perfectly crunchy and golden with a sauce to match the appeal.  Add a large bowl of steamed rice and within 1 hour you will have a self induced food coma.  Mmmmmmmm good. I have been eating it for years.....but due to current conditions in the financial markets and the connection to my gastronomical tract.... I chose the safer Sashimi, a bowl of rice and a bowl of soup. Last time I was there, the waitress mentioned they have BLUE FIN TORO. Now usually I would not try it from a restaurant that I dont trust but due to the standard that Ichizzle has upheld over the years I felt comfortable and went ahead and ordered the TORO.  BAMMM!!!!  POOOWWWWWW!!!!!!  ZING!!!!!!!  WOWOWOWEEEEEEE!!!!!  EXCELLENT TORO! I sat at the bar and the sushi chef gave me my order and I must say even the presentation was excellent. SIMPLE and CLEAN.  That was it. That was the final straw. After eating here for years and years. I finally had to write a review.  Its that good folks. Do me a favor and make sure you take care of this place Yelpers.... Its a keeper.  Enjoy and Repeat When Necessary.",

I wasn't too hungry or adventurous, yet again.  Ordered only the veggie tempura, but was surprised that it was more like an onion loaf and it also had little baby shrimp intertwined.  It sat on a bed of rice.  It hit the spot.  My friends ordered the tuna tar tar roll, some kind of salad, jalapeno fried rice, beef tongue, and some kind of pork dish.  Sorry I can't be more specific, I'm a bad yelper!  The only thing I tried of theirs was the beef tongue and found it to be chewy, but wasn't sure if that is just how it's supposed to be.  My friends BF is a line cook at a steakhouse on the strip and said that if properly marinated and cooked, beef tongue is super tender, so I don't know?  They both liked the jalapeno fried rice, but I wouldn't touch something with jalapenos in it with a ten foot pole!    Anyways, I'll keep going back and trying new things.  Maybe one day I'll even be so brave as to tell the waitress to \"surprise me\", like many of my fellow yelpers have!",

    "text": "My parents were visiting from LA and out of all restaurants I chose Ichiza. Big mistake. Wow! I am in shock with the service we got tonight. I've been here about 3 times and never had a problem until tonight. The moment we walked in the waitress sat us by the door and my parents didn't want to sit there because they were cold. So we asked to sit somewhere else, she would not move us even though half the restaurant was empty. It was confusing and did not make sense.   Then we continued to order and there were two specific problems we encountered. 1- we ordered garlic bok choy. Granted I never ordered this before, but for 4.95 you literally got 3 bites of bok choy. I can honestly say it was one stem that was broken up into the individual pieces. It blew my mind!! I almost thought it was a joke. Yes everything is small there, but this was beyond a small portion, it was miniature. I thought no way-how can this be?  Then I ordered 2 tuna sashimi salads and asked for the dressing on the side. She brought one small bowl half filled with ponzu sauce (which is the dressing used for the salad) then she brought one small bowl filled with sesame oil. Ok no thanks I dont want to pour oil right onto my dressing. I asked for one more bowl of ponzu sauce and she made the biggest deal out of it, sending it back and talking to everyone about it-like I was a crazy and asking for something out of the ordinary. I'm sorry, but for two salads I don't think its that difficult to bring two bowls of dressing on the side and do it with a smile. I order dressing on the side everywhere and they acted like I was an alien for asking for it this way. So she brings back literally 1 tablespoon of ponzu in a big bowl. WOW! I was so humiliated and embarassed that I took my parents here telling them it's a really good place. They know they can always trust my food taste and I was blown away by the waitress. Now I don't want to judge a place simply by one waitress, but both waitresses were this way and the guy in the back who shook his head when she brought back the oil to ask him what it was. I guess she didn't know what sesame oil looks like even though she works there and should know the menu????? Poor service, again. If a customer asks for more dressing, bring it. We paid %60 for our food, that's the least you can do. Also, the waitresses never came by to refill water or ask if everything is ok, not even once. I guess she was pissed off about the dressing incident.   Now, I don't want to sound like one of those annoying people that one thing wrong and I change my mind about a restaurant. But if I am going to bring out of town visitors here and I am a loyal customer, I think I deserve some decent service. I will never come back and never tell others to come here. Also, I am not missing out on anything-the food is really ok-not bad-but I've had WAY better elsewhere. Ichiza, we are broken up forever!",

    "text": "Once again, thank you Yelp for helping me find another great restaurant to satisfy my hungry tummy... My boyfriend's parents live in Vegas, so we come here a couple of times a year.  For the past year, I've been wanting to try this place out, and finally got around to it tonight.  I really liked how the restaurant was set up - small, simple, and traditional looking - they're not trying to look super nice, rather than giving off a more comfortable eating atmosphere.  The inside of Ichiza consists of around 10 tables, and then there's a tatami (I don't know if there's a spelling for it) section with 2 long tables, where you take your shoes off and sit on the ground.  Then besides that, there's the kitchen area.  The service here is ok, not great but not bad.  It is what it is.  However, the food is really good.  Like Richard L. said, it's like tapas, but Japanese style.  I guess this type of cuisine is called \"Izakaya\" as I have learned after reading all of these reviews.  Living in the Bay Area, I actually have yet to find a place with this type of cuisine - everyone in the Bay is really hung up on sushi (hey, which i love, dont get me wrong).   Anyhow, my boyfriend and I came here tonight and we ordered an order of their udon, chicken skewers, agedashi tofu, kimchi fried rice, and spicy tuna roll.  The udon was really tasty and they added some seaweed, egg, and veggies to it.  I didn't try the chicken skewers, but they looked like Teryaki Chicken pieces on a stick, and my boyfriend liked them a lot.  The Agedashi Tofu, which is one of my favorite appetizers, came with a generous portion of fruit, and 4 huge slices of tofu.  The tofu was very fresh and soft, and the dish was very good.  Spicy tuna roll was pretty good, but not amazing.  Lastly, I loved their Kimchi Fried Rice.. Ichiza's fried rice definitely kicks some @ss... It was sooooo tasty and with the kimchi, it was the perfect amount of spicyness.  Overall, 4 stars for above average food and very low prices.  (all of those dishes only came out to about $22.)  Definitely a lot lower than the prices we're used to.  All of the smaller dishes run from $3-$5, and larger dishes run from $6-$9.. none of it is expensive.  If I lived in the area, I would definitely come back.  And, they're open till 3AM!",

    "text": "What else is there to say? I'll just add some useful tips and my favorite menu items.  They accept reservations, and they'll actually put a little \"reserved\" card on a table in anticipation of your arrival. They're open until 3 a.m., but last call for food is 2:15 (and the waitresses will not be shy about informing you of this). Staff is friendly, but it can be a little hard to get their attention sometimes. They do always recognize my friend and give us the 15% discount without having to show her card.  And now, the food: We always start with a few skewers of kushi-tan (beef tongue). It can be hit-or-miss, but when they get it right, it's delicious. I recommend liberally sprinkling it with the chili powder from the bottle on your table.  Nikujaga is a hearty soup with thinly-sliced beef, chunks of potato, pea pods, and carrots in a sweet broth. Absolutely delicious, but they seem to be skimping on the broth lately. We asked about this at 2 a.m. one night and were told they ran out of it, but when we returned a few days later at 9 p.m., it was the same situation.  Aspara-bacon is... steamed asparagus wrapped in bacon. How can you go wrong?  The deep-fried garlic consists of two whole heads, complete with skin. It can be messy trying to pull the cloves out of the skin, but the taste is very mild and I didn't have garlic breath or any odor on my fingers.  An interesting specialty found on the table-top placard is mozzarella fried inside egg roll wrappers, served with ketchup.  I finally got a chance to try the honey toast recently, and the hype is not unwarranted. It was delicious, fun to deconstruct, and they'll even stick a candle in it for your birthday.",

I didn't like any of it, but you can't order any of the groovy stuff on the board at lunch so I figured maybe I just needed to come back for a magical dinner.  We ordered some bok choy that was fine but nothing to write home about. We ordered some kind of sashimi thing that I thought was supposed to have sweet potato but it came with daikon and though the menu mentioned nothing about quail egg, there is the gloopy thing in the middle. I barely eat even chicken eggs. Eggs gross me out. So I tried to scoop out the quail egg but the whole thing felt contaminated.  I tasted it anyway and the fish, while not off in any way, was just not wonderful. It was kind of stringy and somehow lacking in that super fresh tuna taste that I love.   Then we got some tempura green beans. They were fine but no sauce came with them. We had an octopus and cucumber/seaweed thing that had little taste, but was fine. We had a spider roll that was one of the most tasteless spider rolls I've ever had. We had some other things, but nothing memorable. Even the kimchee was bland!!  Not one single thing impressed me. Most everything was bland. At best, perhaps I could say I liked the sake.  Not recommended by me. Don't believe the hype. Meh.",

Only a handful of customers weren't Asian.  The waitress was super friendly and very helpful. I got the eel with cucumber, a friend's recommendation, and it was soo good!  I also got sushi, it was shrimp and topped with a delicious piece of tuna.  Loved it!  I also enjoyed the DIY drink.  The sell Shochu, tastes kind of like vodka, very mild flavor. They serve it with club soda and your choice of fruit (or plain on the rocks).  I ordered it with grapefruit and they brought me half of a fresh grapefruit and a manual glass juicer and a shot of simple syrup. And voila, you make your own drink!  Will definitely came again next time I'm in Vegas!",

When I walk in I forget I am in Las Vegas and feel like I'm in a hole in the wall in Tokyo.  the menu is crazy and the best ones are above the bar and on the wall in the dining area.  I like the pretty authentic style japanese and my dining mate has recently converted from california rolls.  One of my favorite to eat is the smelt fish grilled.  Flavorful, salty, and a little fishy.  chicken yakitori was basic and flavorful and good for the novices.  I went ahead and ordered beef tongue seared and was delighted by the tenderness and slight different texture of the meat.  I didn't tell my friend it was beef tongue til the end cause I know he would blanch and then proceed to say it taste bad.  (he thought it was delicious)  the bacon asparagus was delicious  the enoki wrapped chicken skin was a bust.  the mushroom was mushy, unflavored, and skin was fatty.  The yellowtail tar tar was unusual.  definitely a combination of western and asian.  My friend loved it and I personally wouldn't order it again.  I enjoyed the buta kimchi with pork more korean style and ate that with a bowl of rice.  I would like to go again and try the ramen looks awesome.  And maybe the curry, some more seafood like grilled squid.  The table next to us got it and it looked good.   the fried rice looked good but, I try to avoid the huge meals and get more tapas style.  The other table got bread with honey and ice cream.  Looked wonderful but, I was way to stuffed just from what we ordered and we eat alot.    Total bill with two teas (yummy toasted rice green tea)  excluding tip $35.  Not bad to try so many different dishes.",

    "text": "Loved this joint (Note #1: go early or be prepared to wait a bit).  Great Japanese food (Note #2: not your standard teriyaki, blah blah blah).  They may have the standards but we were interested in the other more unique and cool foods, (they have plenty of adventurous choices, too).   Service: the guy at the front (owner?) was a bit cool at first, but he warmed up and took good care of us. He could see we were serious because we had been waiting a while and so he gave us one of the reserved tables when that party hadn't shown up 15 minutes past their reservation.  Servers were a little brusque, but not inattentive (BTW, I don't dock stars for this. At some joints I don't expect them to kiss my ass. This place takes its good food seriously and the servers and kitchen staff are just zipping around trying to get as much of it to you as possible.)  Food: we had the beef tataki--very good. I could've eaten three of these. Tuna Poki special was reallllllly good. We ordered another one of these. (Note #3: dishes are small--think tapas-sized--but this is good y'all. You get to try more things!) I also liked the snapper carpaccio.  If I had this joint in my hometown, I'd be there once a week until I had tried most everything on the menu.   One more thing: this place, like a lot of good places, doesn't look like much from the outside. It's upstairs at a pretty average-looking Chinatown strip mall. Don't let that stop you.",

    "text": "Desert fish.  I have a few personal rules/ guidelines when it comes to where I eat sushi.  For instance.  1. There's no such thing as a good sushi buffet.  It's an oxymoron.  2. The further you are from the ocean the worse the sushi gets.  Is sushi even available in Kansas?  3. When sushi is not the specialty of the place you're eating at, the sushi is going to be shit.  4. If the sushi restaurant smells like a fish market when you walk in, walk right out.  The list goes on and on...  The moral of this opening paragraph is simple.  Know what to expect and lower your expectations accordingly.  And if you happen to find yourself in the middle of a hot, hot desert, don't expect much.  For the most part, my rules/ guidelines have steered me well over the years.  That said, eating sushi in Las Vegas did not seem like a smart decision, especially from a joint located on the second story of a strip mall.  Well, needless to say, I was wrong.  Dead wrong.  And I'm happy that I was.  There were 8 in our group.  A group of appreciative sake/ Japanese beer drinkers and for the most part, lovers of good, fresh sushi.  You know what I mean.  The kind of sushi that melts on your tongue.  Sushi so flavorful and so delectable that religious adjectives are the only ones that come to mind.  And coming from Los Angeles, where great sushi restaurants dot the city, it's easy to become spoiled.  Well, let me say, Ichiza was all that and a bag of edamame.  The ambiance is comforting and from what I remember, kind of woody.  It is more authentic Japanese Izakaya (See tavern) than a run of the mill sushi restaurant.  Just think Japanese gastro pub.  Service was quick, friendly and attentive.    The menu was large and had a variety of tasty offerings.  In addition, there were specials and season offerings that dotted the wall behind the sushi chefs.  Something for everyone.  Now, the sushi.  Phenomenal.  I ordered some cut rolls and sashimi.  All of if, every last bite, was really, really good.  Especially the sashimi.  Fresh.  Fresh. Fresh.  The goodness didn't stop with the sushi as the libations we ordered were just as good.  The house un-filtered sake was refreshing and complemented the meal perfectly.  To put it simply, it was one great, gastric experience after another.  I don't think it's a coincidence that Ichiza gets such high ratings both on yelp and the interwebs.  What else can I say?  I'm a fan of this place.",

    "text": "Okay, fine, I will write a review of Ichiza. I have avoided writing this review because I simply don't know what to say, and that is rare when it comes to kibbles! The short version: I don't get it, but lots of other people do, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and some credit for decent grilled corn. And, my husband loves the do-it-yourself handroll platter.  I have visited Ichiza on probably three occasions, and last night we returned. The same thing always happens: I stare at the menu and find nothing that sounds appealing, so then I begin to search around the room to decipher the hundred of little pieces of paper. I can only appreciate about half of them because most of them are placed in a location where staring makes it appear that you are glaring at another customer. I really dislike this paper on the wall thing even if it is authentic or True to Japan. It puts me on edge. Print out a specials menu for goodness sake! In the age of personal computing, it should not be hard. (Yes, I just used the phrase personal computing.)  Granted, I am not a fish lover, so that puts me at a disadvantage here. I generally find myself searching for a vegetable. I think my food brain shuts off if I can't find at least one decent vegetable offering. Yes, I eat meat and the occasional fish, but it as if I can't order meat until I find a good vegetable! One time I discovered okra, but I wasn't too impressed with the execution. There was no tasty sauce. I would think they would have more impressive vegetable yakitori options. Maybe they are hidden on the wall behind that one guy's head.   Last night, I just straight out told the waitress: \"I want a green salad no meat, no fish.\" I didn't see it anywhere, but I decided to just tell her what I wanted and hope it was possible. Success! I received a decent green salad with tomatoes, onions and cucumbers in a decent ginger dressing. To complete my order, I went with a miso soup and some grilled corn. The miso was standard. The grilled corn had a nice flavor, but was a little over grilled, making it hard to bite the kernels.   And, I am not a huge fan of the atmosphere. It is loud and busy and populated by lots of drunk revelers, which is okay if you too are a tipsy participant, but not okay if you just want to eat quietly. Plus, the upholstered bench where I sat last night was filthy. I can usually handle hole-in-the-wall levels of cleanliness if I feel that the food is fresh and impressive, but here it just made me wonder if they have time to clean properly given their late hours.   Sorry. This has become more of a mini-rant than a review, but my grand conclusion is if you are any one of the following: A. Fish-lover B. With a group of Ichiza devotees C. With a group of drunken revelers  Then, you will love this place. If you happen to love fish and be with a drunk group of Ichiza devotees, then you've hit the jackpot.",

You'll either get tingles or flashbacks once you take the first bite.  I got a bit of both..True story.  They also have the best beef tongue anywhere.  So tender and juicy..if the thought of eating beef tongue disgusts you, take a bite out of Ichiza's beef tongue and your life will be forever changed.  The honey butter is also stupendous...if there's a happy ending to a meal, that'd be it.  Tried a few other items, but those three really stuck out.  I have serious tar tar withdrawal.  This is easily one of the best meals I've ever had..anywhere.  Granted..it's not all that cost efficient, but if you go w/ 6+ ppl, you can try a good amount of their dishes for a decent price.

AMBIANCE: Place was packed and the entire staff was pretty busy. This is a good sign for anyone if you want to know if it's gonna be worth your time and money.  FOOD: Got their pork cutlet musubi, wagyu beef, beef bowl, and honey toast.  Pork cutlet musubi-inside the cutlet there was cheese, which made it really good for me, on top there was sliced cabbage and an egg, the egg's yolk wasn't fully cooked so I didn't eat it, I should've mentioned that to the waitress. The pork itself was tender and cooked just right. Wagyu beef-You got four thin strips with spring and white onions swimming in some sauce that I don't know. real pricey $8.50 for one order but it was the best out of all we ordered Beef bowl-meat was very tasty! Also tender and the rice that came with it added to a nice flavor that I enjoyed very much. Honey toast-practically everyone here ordered this, and now I know why...because it is awesome! The ice cream and honey together was delicious! The bread was soft and tasty as well.  SERVICE: They failed on this one when it came to getting the waitress to notice us when we wanted her to take our order. That waitress passed by several times before she acknowledged that we were there with menus, staring at her. However this did changed after we got our food, they made sure our drinks were full and cleared the empty plates.  This is a cool place to eat some real good Japanese food, especially when the people next to you are Japanese! You know it's that good!",

The restaurant itself is cute, typical Japanese looking restaurants reminds me alot of GUU Garlic in Vancover and smaller places in NYC.  Since we were visitors, our friends took care of the ordering.  These are all tapas style, so it's a great spot to drink and munch.  1) Beef Tongue Skewers -  this was good very tender.  2) Fried Oysters - they were kind of big, I think I would've preferred raw oysters over these, they were only okay.  3)  Garlic Chicken Gizzards - Normally I am not a fan of this, but this was actually very tasty - they were chopped up pretty fine so it wasn't as chewy than the normal that I am use to.  4)  Bacon Wrapped Mochii - well this was kind of interesting.  Cant say that I loved it.  It is what it sounds, bacon wrapped in mochi - it was a bacon wrapped in chewy dough.   5).  Buttered Corn - served on top of wonton chips, this next to the honey toast was my favorite.  I think we might have had another chicken skewer - but wasn't sure what it was called, beef tongue was defintely better.  To finish off of course we had the Honey Toast.  Never had anything like this before and wish I can learn how to make this on my own.  It was sweet, cinnamon, and topped off with ice cream.  Defnitely a must order.",

    "text": "Oh my. I love this place. Is it as good as everyone says? YEP! I went here, every single night I was in Vegas.  Once, I even walked here from my hotel (theHOTEL). Craazzyyyy in love, that's what I say.  Only problem, was that I left my glasses/contacts at home, so I had a lot of trouble reading the menu scattered everywhere on the wall. And my friend couldn't read Japanese, so he wasn't any help either!  Luckily, the waitress helped, and suggested some things to try. I can't remember the name, I think it's called unagi kakiage roll. Soooooooooo good. And of course the honey toast and the yellowtail tartar. I got the tartar every, single, night along with the unagi kakiage roll. The pachinko I wasn't impressed with. It was so-so. But their scallops were sooo good, and it had my favorite fish salmon with it! yum yum yum.  Everything was reasonable priced, I wish we had one of these in virginia! I'd probably gain a million pounds...so it's best that Ichiza stays on the west coast :'( :'( :'(  My friend jokingly said we'd fly back out here from VA just for more Ichiza. Almost considering it.  :'( :'( I think about you every night baby girl. :(",

Food is good though it could all be presented in a menu. You got to go there a few times to figure it all out. Well thought out little entrees right in line with dishes you would probably find walking the streets of Tokyo. I went with a bunch of friends who knew what to order. I orderd a Tofu Avacado Salad most likely because of where I was sat.Very good salad, nice amounts of tofu diced ripe avocado iceburg lettuce leafed with your typical soy vinaigrette.  I likes the little Grilled Mushrooms wrapped in Chicken skin, brilliant! We had some chicken gizzards but I didn't try. Then we got some Garlic that was roasted and served with miso paste. Funky but some how went real well with a grilled musubi. There was much gooey natto going around.  Service was very comfortable and friendly. I'll come back here for sure. Open till 2am get an extra star.",

    "text": "Ichiza how I missed thee.  This place has been open for some time now and I used to come here for their beef bowls. They were delicious! But I was not the foodie that I am today so I didn't see food the same way or care about all the great things they had to offer.  But now that I have Yelp on my side. I have discovered a new side to Ichiza. An amazingly delicious side. It seems as if they had a secret menu or something because most of the items that I saw pictures of on Yelp were not listed in the menu they provided. It must have been posted on their walls though, but I can't read all of it cause it was all over the place. And it was awkward when I was trying to read the items off the wall because people think I was staring awkwardly at them.  So I whipped out my phone and pulled up Yelp and ordered my food based off of pictures! Started off with the deep fried baby octopus, which I thought would have a dipping sauce but the server said the flavors is already in the octopus. And she was right! It was seasoned well and fried perfectly.  Then the Uni in Ponzu sauce. I love me some Uni! And it was yummy. Small little order, but it was worth it. Very fresh. And then the yellowtail tartar. The best! And for the price, soooo worth it. I'm not sure if I ate it properly though, it didn't seem easy to eat cleanly. Then there was the pork with shiso leaf (looked big in the picture was it was a small order and nothing special) and can't remember the other stuff I got. But definitely not disappointed in anything.  But the MAIN reason we chose Ichiza for our evening dining is for the Honey Toast! It was bigger than I thought. And we had green tea ice cream rather than vanilla. It was delicious. And I didn't have room to try their other desserts like the crepe or mochi that I wanted to. But I will be visiting often, so I will have many opportunities....  We arrived to dine around 10:15p and it was busy, but still a couple seats available. We sat at the bar right next to the server station so we saw all the food coming out. Yellowtail tartar is very popular, and for a good reason! Service was good for an asian place. They were quick.   Only thing is that I feel I am missing out on some other goodies because it isn't listed in the menu, but rather all the walls. But thank goodness for yelp! This isn't a fancy restaurant, but a cozy authentic Japanese place with good pricing.  Oh and since we sat at the bar, we got to see the sushi chef cut a whole fish into sushi. Interesting :)  We ordered about 6 items, and a dessert at it totaled $42 and soem change. And the honey toast was the priciest item, it was good... but dunno if it is worth it. We can make it at home for much cheaper!",

My favorites were the miso butterfish, kimchi fried rice and tuna sashimi salad.  It's a great place for you to try many different (small) appetizers at an efficient cost.  The vibe feels very Japanese, as if you really are in Japan, which was something I liked.   It's a fun experience, but I didn't feel like it hit the spot when I walked out the door.  Probably won't come back to try different items, just my favorites.",

I wasn't sure I could stand it.  Because there were only two of us, the waitress sat us at the sushi bar so now my neck hurts from having to constantly turn my head to talk to my friend.  The tongue was tough; a 1/5, the miso butterfish was 3/5.  Is that the best you have?  The ambiance was 1/5 with sticky counters and food stained menus.  Would not recommend to anyone.  $53.00 for two people for mediocre food and one beer for each of us.  Tons of menu items written on paper posted to the walls, but you can't read them if you are sitting at the Sushi bar.  Bad format, bad smells, bad ambiance, bad food.",

I'm always on the lookout for places that can rival all my favorites on both coasts, but this place is probably only a 3.6 for me personally.

Salmon chazuke - I'd recommend they chopped the salmon to small pieces, I think it would've taste better. Beef tataki - it's really good!  One of \"must order\" dish.   Beef Tongue skewer - I think it's alright Agedashi Tofu - I like this.  Raw tuna appetizer ( forgot the name) - its different, but I didn't like it  I believe this will be a \"go back\" place if I visited Vegas again!",

Wasabi Ika (squid) ~ it was fresh squid in a wasabi sauce garnished with pickled daikon.  It was very refreshing!  Agedashi tofu ~ I luv this dish and luv making it at home!  Ika butter ~ Sauteed squid in butter and onions.  Asparagus bacon and Gizzards (sunagimo) ~ Two yakitori that I often get when its available.  Okra Natto ~ 2 of my fave slimy food hell yeah!!!  Sake flight ~ From Ginjo, Junmai, Daiginjo all were pretty good tasting.   Honey Toast ~ Hmm what can I say...... Its damn good so you have to try it.  Toast, Honey and Ice Cream!  Yum Yum!  This place is way off the strip but worth going to to.  Its open late so you can get some good grub here!  I still like the izakaya in my hood but this place is a good spot in sin city!

I will say the beef tongue and mushroom butter was excellent, definitely would recommend that. Staff was super nice and friendly. The honey toast is...toast with honey and ice cream.

Small wooden tables, the menu stapled to the wall, the smell, the crazy fast kitchen.  Good memories  Let's see if I can remember all of the food:  - The blue fin tuna sashimi was excellent.  Nice and fatty with a hint of fish.  Nice thick cut - The chicken thigh skewers were savory with a hint of fat - The chicken gizzards were good (for gizzards).  Might have been a touch overcooked - The chicken livers were off the hook.  Such livery goodness and the sauce complemented them well - The beef tongue skewer was tender and meaty - The black cod was just wow.  Perfectly cooked and traditionally sauced - The meatballs were amazing.  Savory, meaty, tender with a nice touch of green onion - The red snapper carpaccio was meh.  Kind of boring after all of the savory goodness - The beef tongue and mushroom special was also boring.  It was filling.  Maybe I was disappointed because it came towards the end and everything else was so good - The Copper River salmon was unbelievable.  I am a little bit of a salmon snob and know that the Copper River label is a little bit of a marketing ploy.  However, this salmon was rich and fatty.  Definitely lived up to the marketing  Service was solid and I loved that I was outnumbered 9:1 by Nihonjins who were all chatting away not knowing that a gaijin was sitting there eavesdropping.",

The final time I came here was a deal breaker: the health rating was a C. Having been here before, I tried to see past this rating. But the hubby wasn't having it, so we went somewhere else.   Well, a news report showed that the health district shut them down a couple of days after we were in there. Gross!  Apparently this establishment has a history of being closed by Southern Nevada Health District and bad scored. Of course they clean up and get reopened, but really??   Bottom line, yes the food is good. In fact, I haven't found anything that compares. But the SNHD shutting the doors on multiple occasions is a deal breaker for me.",

Needless to say, we left without eating there because the restaurant seemed so unkept, can't imagine they take care of the food back in the kitchen.",

    "text": "Despite all the reviews warning about needing a reservation, came on a Sunday night with no reservation and a group of 6 around 7pm and got seated immediately.   The options here are endless, and many are posted around the restaurant rather than in the tiny menu they hand to you.  We got:  Mackerel Iso-yaki - This was my favorite dish. Must get! The fish is deliciously savory and yet soft at the same time. So good.   Salad with tuna and tofu - My second favorite dish. I loved the way the cold tofu paired with the salad and the tuna and the sesame oil.   Chicken and egg rice bowl - This was quite good, the flavors come together really well. If you're looking for something filling, get this.   Egg custard - This was super smooth and delicious and also filled with the umami flavor of mushroom (I'm more used to seafood flavored egg custard, but this version was surprisingly delicious).  Iko yaki (grilled squid) - I was actually underwhelmed by this dish, but I think others enjoyed it.   Chicken gizzard - I really liked this skewer. Nice and crunchy.  Chicken skewer - Super juicy chicken skewer.  Beef liver - Wasn't a huge fan of this because of the texture. But if you like cooked liver you'd probably be a fan of this.  Beef tongue - This was really good, super savory and juicy. I liked it a lot.   Seaweed Salad - This was not the seaweed salad I was expecting. Rather than green seaweed, it's red seaweed with a bunch of lettuce. Not sure I'd get it again.   Ponzu uni - This was good but underwhelming. I'd probably opt for something else.  Yellowtail Tartar - I felt like the fish in this wasn't particularly fresh and was just being masked by the avocado and crunchy cracker. Wasn't impressed.  Kimchi fried rice - I surprisingly liked this although some of my friends didn't enjoy it. I'd get this just to share.  Prices are reasonable, and you can opt for a super cheap meal (chicken and egg bowl) or a moderately priced one (with the sushi/sashimi offering).  All in all, great food and drinks, and a nice atmosphere just to chill and chat with friends.",

    "text": "I suppose one of the things that I loved was the sheer variety and difference of the many dishes available.  Variety is good.  But I find that usually in sushi restaurants, that when such a place has so many dishes on their menu, they tend to all come out with a vaguely similar taste underneath.  Not so here.  Each dish has its own flavor and flair.    But what stood out to me the most was the service.  I've been here thrice for dinner, and have had three different waiters/waitresses serve.  They were all very attentive, very personable, and had this way of making you feel special.  Whatever training they give their employees must be amazing. Frankly, I've never received nearly as much satisfaction I got from the service here.  I'm extremely surprised, actually:  I'm very much an introvert and do not usually welcome so much attention.  My only complaint (though not much of one) was the lack of choices in the dessert menu.  Everything had some form of ice-cream as the central fare.  They tasted fine, but I would have liked a wider selection.",

I ordered the honey bread since everyone recommended so, and it was SOO GOOOOD! you should ask honey on the side or else they'll pour it until it gets too sweet! I've always went to restaurants on the Strip while staying in Vegas not knowing about this place, but I definitely will be back here the next time I visit.   The restaurant is small but the ambiance was cozy/romantic and also had the traditional Japanese style. We ordered the honey bread (MUST), tofu salad, chicken and beef bowl, takoyaki, pork cutlet, kimchi-pork fried plate, and one more dish but came out to about only $70! (for 4 people!)   Except for one middle-aged lady around her early 40s(?) being a little grumpy to us, all other young waitresses were friendly and attentive.   Parking is easy since this place is located in a small plaza.",

    "text": "I never expected my 2nd Yelp 5-star review is to take place in Las Vegas, in a stripped mall, next to a foot massage place.  Ichiza had a long line when we arrived around 8pm on a weeknight, so it's definitely a good sign.  While waiting, there is a tea station downstairs where you can grab a few drinks and warm up your appetite.    When you stepped in, you can tell it's a mix of Vegas locals, Asians and Americans mingling.  There's specials posted everywhere and a nice selection on the menu.  Besides dishes like the ramen, most of the dishes are sized tapas style.  Meaning they're for kittens, baby ducks, super models and hardcore food critics.  Fortunately if you order at least 2-3 per person, you'll enjoy one of the best Japanese meals in your life.  Some highlights:  Blue fin tuna (mid-fatty) - super delicious and fresh. Ankimo (monkfish liver) - heavenly delicious.  It's like an articulate version of chicken liver, then multiply by 100 tasty points. Baby octopus - get it, you won't regret it. Pork belly and egg - it's cooked to perfection.  The Kirin beer (glass for $3.75) was extremely reasonable, while the sake collection was impressive.  The prices will also seem like a bargain, though honestly some of the beer filled me up, not just food.  As long as you're prepared to wait, you'll definitely have a great experience.  I'd skip the ramen and sushi, and try out some traditional Japanese fare for a change.",

This means that you must get up from your seat and walk around reading the signs and try to remember which ones you want to order by the time you get back to your seat and the waitress returns to your table.  Then you order one of the items and hope your waitress knows which sign you're talking about because if not, you might have to get back up and walk her to the sign across the room.   -The plates are good for sharing, so we each ordered a few items and tasted everything.  I did not have the sea urchin mochi dish; Bonita and Nightmare had that.  FOOD:  miso ramen (half order); sea urchin mochi; yam potato and sesame salad; mapo tofu; pork dumplings;  mini pork okonomiyaki; honey toast.  The honey toast takes about 15-20 minutes to prepare, so our waitress kindly gave us a heads-up when she saw that we were slowing down.  This is only the second time I've had this dessert and I definitely liked this version better than the first one I tried elsewhere.  Served with two scoops of ice cream and large pieces of toast with honey drizzled on it, this is the perfect thing to share with your favorite people, and that's what I recommend because it's big.  CB and I did most of the devouring while NN watched.  More for us. Our bill was less than $43 and although service was a little hit and miss, I would definitely come back with the girls.

The restaurant is small - it includes about 10 tables, some of which you sit down on the floor with no shoes on, and a bar. The walls are plastered with hand written pieces of papers with additional items to the menu. We ordered the beef bowl, grilled squid, karage (deep fried marinated chicken), crab fried rice, dumplings and mini honey toast to seal the deal. The beef bowl was HUGE and in my opinion way better than Yoshinoya. Prices are also super cheap! I have yet to go to Japan but this is what I imagine authentic Japanese cuisine to taste like. Service is amazing as well. I learned that this place does take reservations which we will probably do for future visits since we WILL most definitely be back. I can't wait to try every thing on the menu! I urge everyone to come and support this small business!!",

    "text": "Went here from my brother's recommendation. We had came from a late night of drinking and relaxing at one of Wynn's bar/lounge and got really hungry. We decided to head over here to eat some small bites and sashimi. We ordered more than we thought. It wasn't very busy on a Saturday night at 12am; however, once we sat down and started to order more people came in. We got a variety of food like the shrimp fried rice, chicken gizzard, tuna sashimi, and grilled squid to name some. I really enjoyed the grilled squid, chicken gizzard, and tuna sashimi. We actually ordered two of the tuna. Very good. The fried rice was yummy as well. I enjoyed eating these small Japanese bites cause it just fills you up at the right amount as compared to going to ayce sushi places where you're obligated to eat as much as you can. The tuna was fresh and delicious!! Again, we order two of them because it was just that good. The interesting thing about this dish was the raw quail egg on top. When you mix it up and let it settle down on to the tuna, then you take a bite of all those flavors together, oh goodness it was delicious! Another I forgot to mention was the yellow tail sashimi!! We also order two orders of that as well. Definitely must get dishes!",

    "text": "I used to visit this place quite frequently when I was working in LV and I liked it a lot. This time is a re-visit after almost 3 years and it's a little bit disappointing. I used to order one uni with ponzu sauce and one without. This time I just ordered uni with ponzu as they only had that available on the menu. The appearance was not appealing as the color was a bit dark. The first piece was acceptable but the second one was \"urhhh\" definitely gone bad. I complained to the waitress and asked for a replacement. Then the funny part came as the waitress replied that the replacement would be the same and probably it's because I didn't like the taste of uni. To be honest, I really didn't expect that response and was speechless at that moment. She then asked if I wanna cancel one order (my husband's serving was fine), I said yes and that's it. This experience removes this place from my must-visit list in LV but I might still come back as the other food still taste good.",

We did make dinner reservations just in case though.   Service and food are great! Our server was nice and gave us recommendations since we were all over the place with ordering. They serve the food as it's finished cooking/preparing so it feels like a constant flow of food (but in a good way).   What we ordered: - Blue fin tuna sashimi: soft and almost melted in your mouth yumminess - salmon sashimi: basic but necessary - miso cod: OMG deliciously flavored, slight crispy on the outside, and melt in your mouth softness on the inside.  - ika (giant squid): Not as chewy, rubbery as I thought it would be. We ordered like 4 of these, enough said lol.  - shrimp fried rice: this was surprisingly good for something I thought would be basic lol - agedashi tofu: another basic but necessary lol - uni with ponzu sauce inside a lemon: small, delicate but bursting with flavor!  - toro with raw quail egg over half an avocado: also small, but good with fattiness and protein  The menu is extensive and they have specials on the wall too! We kept ordering throughout dinner because we would see something interesting (either on the wall or a different menu). Pricing is decent and there's something for everyone so it's a great place to take even some of the pickiest eaters.",

The waitresses are always really nice, regardless of how busy they are.

Vegas has so many japanese restaurants and this was my least favorite. My group came here because we were craving ramen and after all the reviews suggesting the Ichiza Ramen DX, we all got it! Yes all 5 of us and boy did we make a mistake!  The ramen in the bowl was awful. It was all stuck together like one big piece of dough. I thought it was only my bowl, but all 5 of us had the same issue. The one piece of pork belly in the bowl was full of fat and a tiny little piece of meat. The broth was super salty and was not flavorful. Should I go on???!  The appetizers was mediocre. I didnt realize the baby bokchoy meant a baby's dish?! literally a tiny portion.   I don't know what else to say here except that I do not recommend. I can talk about all the appetizers I got, but none were really good to waste time reviewing.",

I ordered the beef tongue with mushrooms, the shabu shabu salad, the tuna tartare on avocado, and the sunomono with kimchi, tamago, and shrimp. Even though this was already so much food on its own, I honestly could've eaten more. I wanted to eat the entire menu. The shrimp in the sunomono was plump and fresh. The beef tongue was just so savory. The tuna tartare was also extremely fresh, the uzura was like butter on the avocado and tuna. The shabu shabu salad wasn't quite what I expected, but it was still really good. Best of all? All of this food was so decently priced. It makes eating at any other restaurant on the strip seem like a foolish idea.  Looking at some of lower-rated reviews, I can't tell if I'm so enamored of Ichiza because it conjures up a lot of nostagia, or that I ordered their signature items, or both. I would be more than happy to make a trip back to Las Vegas just to eat at Ichiza again.",

After they opened a couple of patrons trickled in. It wasn't until we started getting our food that other diners started to show yet service was incredibly slow. It was almost deliberate and made all the more annoying when there were two servers there, but only one working.  The food, ugh. It was undercooked, overcooked, overly salty, and even needing salt. We ordered so much food and NOTHING tasted good. We left everything less than half eaten and tried to get out as quick as possible to go elsewhere, but getting our check took FOREVER!! The waitress started dropping off checks to every other table, BUT OURS! Without exaggeration, we sat there for 15 min. twiddling our thumbs and waiting for our check. Never again. Don't go here if you value your time, money, and tastebuds. Such a waste of calories. Ugh.",

Service was good, nothing out of the ordinary.  As for the important part, the food was ok. Beef tongue with mushrooms and onions had a great gravy like sauce, solid flavor. Yaki udon with pork and cabbage was not bad but not great. Black cod was a bit salty and yakitori was good but have had very similar in lots of other places. Mini honey toast was an ok finish. Overall not a repeat destination for this style.  3.5 stars",

Whether you want sushi or ramen or some good ole Izakaya - this little gem on be second floor of a strip mall should be hailed as the best Japanese food in Vegas.   If you're hankerin for a little Korean with your Japanese, have some of the kimchi fried rice.   ALSO, great for vegetarians. The fried tofu and bok choy was the boom dot com.  P.S. is the boom dot com an actual website? Because it should be. And this restaurant should be featured on it.",

Our party (read: my family) included multiple picky eaters including a person who doesn't eat seafood and two people who have never eaten Japanese food. Unfathomable, I know. . .  Still, with Ichiza's extensive menu I managed to get an array of plates to please every palette. Even the seafood hater seemed genuinely pleased with his sizzling steak while the rest of us sampled the sushi.   This visit to Ichiza was much like a reunion, where the food took a bit of a backseat to catching up with everyone. But one thing I'll never forget about the meal was the honey toast: a half loaf of bread toasted and hollowed out to accommodate vanilla ice cream with honey on the bottom. Do not leave Ichiza without ordering it!",

We got a sushi roll (California style roll) and it was good but I think the star is the traditional Japanese pub food.  My husband got the Katsu-don and it was very good.

But I've seen people standing in line waiting for this place to open for lunch.  The dishes my friend and I shared:  crab fried rice, fried california roll, spicy tuna roll, spider roll, grilled corn.  I thought all of the food was of good quality although I wasn't crazy about the spider roll.    I was too full to try their famous honey toast.  Would I go here again? Yes I'm sure I will.

    "text": "After arriving in Las Vegas late night on Friday, my friend and I were looking for a good sushi place to eat that was open until 4am so we ended up here. This was more in \"China Town\" so it was a bit off the strip but it was well worth it. The place was located upstairs in the plaza and it was very cozy. Even around 1:30AM there were quite a few people there. The hostess and servers were really nice and very accommodating but our server was a bit hard to understand at times but she didn't mind repeating things for us. I loved how attentive they were to us and how the manager himself called the cab for us when we requested it.  Note: There is more to the menu than what they hand you. There are a lot of items that they serve on the wall. If anything, just ask your server for help deciding what to order. Ours was amazing and we liked everything she recommended.  The food will be annotated since I'm already a week late:  Beef Tongue: One skewer with thick grilled slices of beef tongue. It had a good flavor to it and the meat was tender with a nice texture.  Toro (Tuna): They had all 3 grades. We bought the highest grade and it was served with the under-skin attached. The sashimi was served in huge thick slices. The sashimi came with sliced radish, black fish eggs, and wasabi. This was delicious as the tuna just melted in your mouth and then the skin added a nice texture to the fish.  Yellowtail Cocktail: Reminded me of a sushi taco. It had two friend wonton wrappers with rice in between with a mix of diced tomatoes, kewpie, green onions, yellowtail sashimi, and avocado. I really enjoyed the crunch of the wonton wrappers and the wonderful \"cocktail\" on top. The flavor was delicious, the sashimi was fresh and prominent, and the tomatoes, green onions, and avocado added a nice flavor and texture to it all.  Gizzard: One skewer with slightly charred gizzard. I liked this overall for the taste and texture, but I think I was more distracted by the other dishes.  Black Cod Fish Filet: If you like a really buttery tasting fish, you'll love this one. This was grilled so it had a nice crispy skin, but on the inside was flakey, buttery, and oily like a well-cooked Chilean sea bass. This had a fall-apart-and-melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness that was slightly sweet and savory.  Saba Grilled Miso: Had a good savory flavor with a touch of miso. I really liked the crisp skin that contrasted the juicy but slightly chewy meat. As with any Saba, it had a bit of a fishy flavor, but the fishy flavor wasn't as prominent like when you eat the sashimi.  Salmon Sashimi: Well worth the price! There were 5 thick, 1 cm cuts of salmon. It was an amazingly good portion, beautiful presentation, and good marbling on each piece. Tuna Poki: This was fresh blue fin tuna mixed with seaweed salad that had 4 different types of seaweed in it. Each one added a different but nice texture to the dish. I liked the nice soy sauce and sesame seed flavor.  Another thing to note here was a good selection of sake.  Overall, I had an amazing experience. The place is open late. The service was great: really nice, always refilled our waters, cleared our plates, made sure we didn't need anything, got everything we needed promptly, and helped us order delicious food. The food was amazing: the portions were good, sushi was fresh, flavor was amazing, and the presentation of each plate was pretty. I can't wait to come back here again!",

    "text": "Ok. So I saw all of the 5* and I was sooo excited to come here thinking it would be like Guu (in Canada). That place is amazing!! Hoping and praying that this place would be up to par with them, I was seriously disappointed. Perhaps I had to high of expectations?  The food was okay. Honestly. I read the majority of reviews, wrote down a couple of items that everyone kept stating you HAD TO TRY, and went with an empty stomach. First of all, the menu they give you DOES NOT have EVERYTHING that everyone says they have. A lot of the menu  is posted all over the walls in Japanese (some have english translations, not all). If you can read, that's terrific. If you can't, well good luck ordering. I personally do not want to be confined to the menu, so good thing I wrote down a bunch of stuff before going. If not, we'd probably end up picking out an udon dish for the 4 of us who went.  Other than that, staff was really nice. There seemed to be a little bit of a language barrier.  I recommend you check out my pics, look at the names and pictures (so you know what you're getting), write down what you want, and then go (if you really must check out this place..I don't think I'm coming back). Also, look at everyone else's pictures on YELP and write down what they are. It will help so much in ordering.  Check out my pics! <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwhat2eatz.blogspot.com%2F2011%2F12%2Fichiza-izakaya.html&s=ebd9fd2981eb34e5a9eaeb4bd4a418fb00123b1a63999fb41d46e5f89413c3e4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">what2eatz.blogspot.com/2...</a>",

Don't restrict yourself to the table menu; the tastiest creations are scrawled on the walls all around you, from floor to ceiling.    You'll want to finish with the honey toast; a giant, absurdly fluffy hollowed out loaf of bread filled to bursting with honey and ice cream.

    "text": "Yelp sent me... and I took the husband thinking that it would be new for us both -- he'd already been -- Bartolotta took him dammit but didn't tell me because he didn't remember the name -- but recognized it immediately when we walked in.    Since we get to go out together so rarely -- and on a Saturday night -- this was fun -- like a mini vacation (ok, we really really really need a real vacation....).     I loved that he knew four people as we walked in -- one was the GM from Sen of Japan (he used to be GM at Okada) -- he said hellos and we were seated at the counter -- little double benches (which later began to bother his back, but I loved 'em).  This way we could see the action in the kitchen -- it's a busy place.  We ordered tons -- taking turns from the menu and the specials on the wall (I really love that if only I wasn't so damned nearsighted!)  We ordered the tempura stringbeans, the custard, I wanted uni (he was speculative about it), we looked for everything spring-y...so that meant bacon-wrapped asparagus, 4 kinds of mushrooms, softshell crab, and a few other things recommended by our server since we love spicy, too.   (and of course, after looking at all the pictures on yelp -- honeytoast!)   He's not a big sake fan -- me, a student happily in training!  My first glass was expensive, but I couldn't resist -- and ended up getting a less expensive glass 2nd (3rd & 4th...hic) because they ran out of the first -- and loved the 2nd one better -- appropriately Happy Bride -- while he drank his beers.  Food came out fast and furious -- the fun thing was watching others see what you ordered to see if they should, too, as well as chatting up neighbors at the counter (the unadventurous seem very 'fishoutofwater' here -- fortunately the ones we met took the husband's unsolicited advice and were nice and friendly.)  We had a great time -- just filled up fast -- and hated it, since we ended up seeing all sorts of dishes fly out of the kitchen that we wish we'd ordered...  like the yellowtail -- almost napoleonlike in presentation.  The best things that night were the simplest (custard, stringbeans, asparagus) -- but they do make serious effort at presentation on some dishes -- it's like a rollercoaster ride of yumminess -- even though some of the specials and dishes on menu have pics next to them, for the most part you really can't tell by the description what it's going to look like.  (love that, too) -- and sometimes, they just change the dish based on what they have in.  We watched a woman in the back working diligently the entire time we were there, carefully prepping something very tiny -- too far away to really tell -- but we loved her attention to detail.    We did notice that the big stock pots needed some serious cleaning -- they're blackened -- and honestly not appetizing to look at -- the chef needs to crack a serious whip there, but other than that, everybody worked clean.  Service was friendly, helpful and efficient -- no complaints at all here.  I was a little suprised how brightly lit the room was - the back sunken tables were the coziest spots and good for groups of 8 -- but make note, this place is tiny -- so when it's busy, a line forms quickly, although tables do turn pretty fast.  I noticed that they do take reservations -- their website offers the service, too  -- but I don't think anyone's watching, so don't assume you're in...also, what's up with the random porn (Craig's List like) on their site ...?     Thanks Yelp -- not sure why there are recent cranky reviewers -- Ichiza is a very welcome addition to Vegas on so many levels, I can't imagine giving it anything but a glowing review -- and I'm seriously looking forward to going back!",

    "text": "Sure I've been into Vegas multiple times over the past year, but this was my 1st time to the \"Chinatown\" area of Las Vegas. And wow, was I surprised at how many different, diverse Asian businesses there are! From Kbbq to pho to sushi + beyond, all of the choices just makes Vegas even more appealing in my eyes, haha! We decided on Ichiza, an Izakaya-style Japanese restaurant, this time at my friend's recommendation, + it was yummy! When we arrived around midnight to this 2nd floor place in an unsuspecting strip mall, there was a 30 min wait to be seated in the little restaurant. With a seating capacity of 60 ppl, it was packed, but my friend said it was worth the wait.   They have a set menu of over 100 items plus an abundant amount of hand-written notes on the wall with additional menu items of all different sorts. This is definitely not your typical Japanese restaurant, but judging by the employees working there + the crowd eating there, it seems to be pretty legit. It's not one of those places that would ever need to advertise or spiffy up w/ new decor if you know what I mean since it's all good how it is. Most of the items on the menu are about $5 or under for a small skewer or piece of that item, which means you have the opportunity to dabble + sample a great variety of their unique dishes. In total we ordered 9 items for the 3 of us plus the oh-so-popular Honey Toast for dessert. (See my photos!)  Pretty much everything tasted good + I was surprised considering a lot of this was pretty new to me. Like who even knew that something like mochi wrapped in bacon even existed?! Some dishes like the spinach + enoki dish were on the oily side, but they were worth trying for sure. I definitely want to come back here another time to try out a few more of the billion unique items on the walls.   Word of caution, though, that it does all add up pretty fast. Our total was over $60 in the end, which isn't all that bad considering we're in Vegas... but still. I hadn't drank enough at that point to shrug it off + not take notice.  The service was pretty quick in the beginning, but then it started to die down later in the wee hours as the line out the door dwindled. I'm sure the waitresses were all getting pretty tired at that point since Ichiza seems to be a late night hotspot, but it shouldn't have to take frantic waving to get refills on water. Parking is a decent-sized lot in front of the strip mall + getting here was no problem from The Strip.",

    "text": "When visiting Japan, you have to try the sidewalk kiosks where a wood-carved bench and old world counter wait for you to sit and have some ramen. Menus are not the same at those restaurants; rather, they consist of large papers with hand written kanji of delectables.  This is where you want to eat, and thankfully Vegas has a touch of that in itself. On Spring Mountain Road, where all the best Asian food is found, is a small sake bar and grill called Ichiza. When you walk up to the door, you can already tell it's going to be great and authentic, because the writing in the signs are all kanji and English subtitled.  As you enter the place, they all shout a great Japanese greeting, one I cannot spell or even create a phrase to type into my critique, but if you've been to a Japanese sushi bar, you know what that greeting is. I love the atmosphere, because it's wooden tables and benches at the bar, just like in Japan, and there is a seating area where you take off your shoes and kneel at the table. The bar is great! You get to sit at the bar and order from the chefs themselves off of menus that are papers stuck randomly above your head. It's beautiful, very authentic--down to the hangers for the aprons in the corner of the restaurant (which reminds me of a small Japanese closet in a typical apartment there).  The food is fantastic. I have to say that they don't have a wide range of sushi selections, but they have the street foods from Japan that are worth every penny. From squid on a stick to char-su ramen (pork ramen in soy), the menu is expansive, added to daily, and simply delicious.  I would suggest asking the chef to make a custom roll for you, although the price will be significantly different. And if you have the budget, eat blue tail sashimi. It's spectacular and fresh.  Try their food. Ichiza is at 4355 Spring Mountain Rd # 205. You can call for more information at 367-3151.  Come to Japan on a staycation, or just to have a nice dinner. It's worth the trip.  Tip: get there earlier than usual lunch and dinner times.  It gets crowded.",

    "text": "I am always intrigued by the guidance and reviews of so called \"foodies\". Some of these neophyte food critics act as if they've never had a bad day, too quick to rush to judgment, and almost as pompous as the guys that get paid to eat!  That said, on to Ichiza izakaya! I was introduced to this eatery by a best friend who has been in the food and beverage industry for twenty plus years. He has worked every position possible, from cook to GM, and I consider him pretty well versed in cuisine and restaurant operations.  From our first visit, to my occasional stop ins, I've never had a bad experience here.  I will admit, I am not too terribly adventurous, but have tried several dishes, and all have been proper, and to my liking, even if something I might not regularly order. Tako and tempura have always been a favorite, and are always good and consistent.  I would not say the sushi style items, such as sashimi poki, are amazing, but they aren't bad either (it is an izakaya after all).  The daily specials sometimes yield some surprising little dishes that always excite. Sweet Corn is also a smile maker, and the ramen is quite good.  As for the honey toast? It is something that will satisfy a sweet craving, but it is not all that spectacular either (I wouldn't go out of my way for it). I must also say, the menu items being taped to the walls is cute, but can also be frustrating, as they are all over the place, and difficult to read. Better to ask your server for suggestions with this one (they've always been very helpful).  Speaking of servers, and service, Ichiza is consistently busy, partially due to being on the smaller side, and also to a very loyal clientele. The ladies at Ichiza do the best they can considering these two factors alone. The servers are all cute, very friendly, and always smiling. As busy as this place gets, the service is efficient, effective, and simple, and the girls hit all the important points with friendly smiles.  When you consider Ichiza has been around for over 10 years now, the loyalty of most of there customers is understandable.  This restaurant easily qualifies as a trail blazer for Las Vegas dining.  When you consider what they do every night, in the middle of the desert, and NOT in a casino.... It's a very good restaurant, plain and simple. It's is most definitely worth trying.",

There are sooooo many items from the menu and the specials that its super hard to decide what to order.  I wanted to try all the items that caught my eye but I would of taken me all night and some more days after that.  I was crying a little inside because I knew I couldn't eat most of the items I wanted to try.  We narrowed it down to the yellowtail tar tar, tuna sashimi, 2 bowls of ramen, grilled mackerel, and red snapper carpaccio .  The food quality was excellent; the yellowtail tar tar and carpcaccio were my favorite.  The yellowtail tar tar had a bunch of different textures in the dish and was a little spicy, just to my liking.  The capraccio also delicious, it had the fish sashimi along with onions, mountain yam, and fish roe.    There were so many items I wanted to try, like the yakitori dishes, fried chicken pieces, to all the different special menu items.  This is a great place to hang out with your friends to try a bunch of different items and enjoy a nice cold Kirin.  The only blurb is the restaurant is small and you either have to get here early or make a reservation.  I wish this restaurant is in the Bay Area so I can taste that decision making menu.  I will be back!",

Some of it's hard to read (as in faded writing, not I'm an illiterate bastard... although when it comes to kanji, I suppose you can call me that), but I pretty much wanted to try EVERYTHING.  Since it was only my old man and I, we ended up getting fried chicken (there's like three different types but I told the server no cutlet/katsu style), red snapper carpaccio, seared ahi tuna, miso ramen, yellowtail tar tar.  It was a lot of food... it hurt so good  =P  Gotta say, not a fan of the carpaccio, but that's just me.  It was very well prepared and the quality was VERY good... it was just the first time I've tried that (based on a recommendation), and it turned out not to be my thing!  Everything else was BOMB.  It's ALMOST as good as Furaibo near my hometown.  Actually, upon further review, Ichiza has a more extensive menu, so I'll say they're as good =D  which is saying a lot!  Not the best I've ever had in my entire time upon this earth... But if you're in the mood... I strongly recommend it",

Honestly, I wasn't THAT impressed.  When my family and I first arrived at Ichiza, I was definitely fascinated by how the restaurant looked and was really excited to try their food (especially the honey toast that everyone seemed to be going gaga over).  I had a hard time picking out something from the menu and the random dishes that were posted around the room.  I ended up just getting a shrimp tempura bowl and these..chicken meatball things. The shrimp tempura bowl was decent and filling but the chicken meatballs were pretty good. I think that I was more impressed with my little brother's mozzarella sticks rather than my actual meal, haha.  I don't really remember what my parents ordered but they seemed to enjoy the place way more than I did.  Oh oh, and the honey toast WAS pretty good. It took like.. half an hour for the order to come through though.",

Kinda hard to find, since it is on the upper level of a complex down the street from Vegas' \"chinatown\".  We made reservations for 5:30pm, they open at 5 so the place wasn't packed like some of the revews here stated.  The place was very small, and definitely a hole-in-the-wall type of place, not fancy at all (just a heads up if you were expecting something fancy! It's very casual).  Servers were friendly and helpful when questioned about what to order.  Although they did have the usual sushi and sashimi selections, other items on the menu were definitely not for people who like americanized asian food (they had gizzards, beef tongue, liver and such foods not for the faint of heart!).  They also had ramen, which sounded interesting from the description, and hopefully not JUST the cheap ramen u can buy at the supermarket.  One of the reasons why I liked this place is because it had more variety of stuff that you can't find at the typical japanese restaurant.    Our waitress recommended the black cod, which was excellent.  I love fish, and it was really good.  It was a very small portion, though, and it did not come with anything except a dab of some stuff that looked and tasted like pureed radish, which was also good.  I noticed that the portions here in general were pretty small.  My BF ordered sushi that the waitress recommended as well, which were small sushi stacked sandwich-style between crunchy wonton-type things, which I thought was an interesting presentation.  Don't remember the name of it, but it was good.  I didn't see a dessert menu, and didn't ask for one cause I knew I came here to try the honey toast for dessert.  I agree with the reviews, it WAS really good.  The waitress said it takes about 15 min to come out so order it early if you don't want to wait.  The ingredients were very simple - it's a block of crusty bread, very soft and warm on the inside, with butter, honey, and a scoop of Vanilla ice cream.  I could probably make a similar version at home.  Definitely made to share between at least 2 people.  If you love bread, butter, honey, and ice cream, it is definitely worth coming here to try it.  This is a nice place for a small group, we sat comfortably in a group of 4.  Anything bigger seems that it would either be a long wait to sit or long wait for the food.  Towards the end of our meal, I could feel the staff watching us waiting for us to finish, and felt like we were rushed out.  I did have a good food experience here though, and will definitely return to try more things on the menu.  Maybe I'll get enough courage to try the beef tongue next time!",

They did a good job of toasting that whole block of bread though. It's not my favorite.  Overall a really good experience. A company would be nice.

I have a feeling most of the 5 star reviews on here are coming from people who have never ate at a finer izakaya in Japan.  The selection could be a bit better, I would prefer an all Japanese kitchen staff, though their wait staff is all Japanese.    So for the food, 3 stars.  For the kind and welcoming staff, 5 stars.  Ambiance and izakaya feel get 4 stars.  Don't come here expecting an amazing Japanese food adventure.  Come here with friends expecting some cold beer, lively chatter, and friendly service!",

You just kind of have to look around at the food that's written on the pieces of paper all around the place.  It can get a bit crowded, and it's hard to sit if you have a lot of people in your group.    The food is pretty small portion wise thought it's not bad.  I actually thought the baby soft shell crab was interesting.  I have no idea what the names of the foods were since I arrived a bit late so sorry about that, but nothing was that bad or great even.  It was good though.    The sake and beer prices aren't too bad either since that's what I like doing... drinking!  It's an okay place to chill, but a bit small for my taste.",

Gosh, if I had a restaurant that served ramen, I'd be darn sure that the airconditioning was on at all times for the comfort of the customers.  I also found the restaurant a little small.  Too cramped for my taste.    Not all the menu items were in the menu.  It was difficult to read their little signs at the kitchen and on the wall.",

    "text": "This is officially my new favorite Japanese restaurant. I came here for Girl's Day on March 3rd with my boyfriend and was taken away.  Ambiance - I love it. Pretty traditional for a Japanese bar food place, especially with majority of the menu not being on the menu.  That is the BIGGEST thing to make a note of.  My boyfriend and I looked at the menu and ordered stuff, but after ordering we noticed a whole bunch of other things posted on the walls.  Food - Great grilled food.  We had the cow tongue and pork belly and it was tasty.  You definitely tasted the natural-ness in a deep beefy flavor and the charred taste that you LOVE on grilled meat.  My boyfriend loved it!  We also had karage chicken, which was SO juicy and delicious.  I've had some crappy ones, but this one was good.  We ordered beef curry also, and my boyfriend said hands down this is the best curry he has had.  I would come here just for that.  I thought it was good, although I thought it was different for me to have mushrooms in curry.  The last thing we tried was their house ramen.  We didn't get this until we ate everything else we ordered, which kind of sucked.  The ramen was \"meh\" in my opinion.  Everything else overshadowed it and that is the only thing I wouldn't reorder in the future.  I definately want to try the honey toast next time and we will try to get curry katsu, grilled corn, so many other things.  Their menu is so expansive it requires multiple trips and tummies.  Price - I didn't care too much about this and tried not to pay attention because it felt like we just kept ordering.  I would say that it was probably average priced for the quality and quantity that you get.  Even if it ended up being an arm and a leg in price I would come again.  I definitely will be coming here again soon. Way awesome!",

We had the Chazuke, rice in a green tea broth, with umeboshi (pickled ume fruit) & nori (seaweed). My friend commented it's perfect after a night of drinking.  We also tried the whole Pike Mackerel, salted and grilled; as well as the Spanish mackerel ceviche, in a nice blend of oil & citrus.   There's so much more on the menu I wish we tried, but unfortunately we were stuffed from our meal at Dos Caminos.",

They have a small sushi menu so if you are one of those high end sushi snobs you'll be disappointed .  If you want to experience a traditional Japanese cooked cuisine then you've come to the right place.. Saw lots of reviews for the miso cod and the seaweed salad.. Cod was melt  in your mouth delicious ! Salad had a nice variety of seaweeds mixed with greens and cucumbers.  My kids ate the ramen with miso broth and loved it.  Just a note we didn't see other kids around , mostly young hipsters before hitting the night club scene .  Also got sticker shock on iced green tea.  Although it was very good, just wished they would have let me know they charge for refills .  Should have read the  reviews on the wall menu items... Would have been nice to know other options..  Overall we had a nice dinner and good food.",

( I think I'm addicted to China town ) The service is very friendly and the interior is very \"ethnic\" with things written in Japanese???? on the menus on the wall, the 2 traditional tables to take your shoes off and the eat at. I get the DX Ramen when I go which is in a huge bowl, which is what this hungry boy likes. The thing I dislike is cramped eating space. I ride a motorcycle and I have to put my helmet back next to the bathroom on a ledge full of random stuff that they needed to put somewhere and that was the place...along with my helmet. All in all, it's not bad food and they now have menu's since I guess Ashley B. said they once didn't.",

Well now I have .... What a great way to start 2008. Went for lunch and the staff was very patient with me.  I was not sure of the lunch specials and finally ordered Ginger pork .... Just outstanding. A light refreshing soup, wonderful salad and the ginger pork was \"par excellance\" I can not wait to go for dinner as  I looked at the handwritten dinner menu and really wanted the Soft shell crab - looks wonderful. And I have to have the honey toast for desert. Once again .... Yelpers out there - thank you so much  I owe this excellent experience to all of you .......",

The GOOD:  Yellow tail tar tar - my FAVORITE DISH of the meal. there was tempura crackers with rice and pico de gallo in the middle, with raw yellow tail bits spread on top, with a yummy tangy (ponzu?) sauce.  there was just lots of textures and flavors to this dish which kept it interesting with every bite.  Tuna Tofu Salad - a refreshing hawaiian style poke salad with soft tofu (like the corean kind you would find in soup)  a great change from all the meat and steaks that you get on the strip  The OK:  Red Snapper Carpaccio - as decent as sushi can get, when you are in the desert.  the bed of veggies it came on was nice and cripsy and soaked up just the right amount of ponzu sauce  Beef Tongue Stirfry - it actually come out on a sizzling stoneware. OMG lots of garlic!  i love fried garlic chips in my food, its always a great addition.  the tongue meat is super lean, however it is pretty tough to chew.   The MEH:  Mini okominoyaki - took very long to cook and still turned out very eggy like an omelette instead of a pancake.  Good flavor with the bacon ( Japanese pork belly sliced thin and not cured or salty like the american one), sauce, and ginger  Service was almost unbearably slow for a small place with 2-3 hostess or servers. good luck trying to get your check or get your server's attention.  they look your way but pretend not to see you.  Overall however, this is a great place if you want to get away from all the steaks and butter",

Perhaps it was the alcohol. Maybe it was just \"hanger\" taking over me. I looked it up and arrived with great hope and expectation. This place is small and it has the concept of izakaya but not quite there yet. It feels more like a restaurant with open kitchen with bar tables that resembles what izakaya should look like.  What's great about late night is the ultimate ramen craving mixed with good sake. So I ordered their soy based ramen, grilled squid and fried chicken appetizer. Salty, salty, salty and salty. I have never asked for a cup of hot water to water it down at any restaurants. I had to. It was like someone poured soy sauce all over the ramen and served it without tasting it. Really? Well, after a full cup of hot water, it tasted little better. I was \"hangry\" so I ate the grilled squid drenched in sauce and extra salty fried chicken.   This is Vegas so I had to relax. But the Pho places are amazing and ramen at Sushi Samba in Palazzo is even better than this place. With expectation always comes disappointment.",

    "text": "Two words: honey toast. *o*  It was almost closing time around 1am when I came with friends to get some honey toast. When the toast arrived at the table, I was shocked at how ginormous it was!  I figured the honey toast would be the size of the brick toast at Guppy, but it's way better! The ice cream on top just wowed me.  I split this with three other people and my portion was more than enough. I savored every single bite. I evened out the ice cream and honey throughout the toast and every single bite was heaven.  The toast came out to me around $8, a little pricey in my opinion, but definitely good. I  didn't get a chance to order food here so I'm not sure what everything else tastes like.  The service was definitely good. They were patient and friendly even around closing time.",

A lot of izakaya restaurants can really run your bill up throughout your meal but this has got to be one of the cheapest ones I've been to so I was pleasantly surprised when the bill came. Everything was pretty good but here's a list: -Whole grilled Ika (awesome presentation, simple) -Wagyu beef carpaccio (delicate and tasty) -Chicken Karage (simple but good) -Egg custard (single serving cups) -Miso marinated mackerel (oh so fatty and delicious) -Yellowtail carpaccio (solid) -Too many more to count/name!!  Overall a great find off the strip. Away from the hustle and bustle with very reasonable prcies for solid izakya has me coming back to this restaurant.  P.S. Honey Toast is way overhypppped! It's exactly what it sounds/looks like, no more no less. Being from southern California you find a dime a dozen of these in the san garbriel valley and they blow this one away no problem.",

    "text": "Ichiza deserves all the credit in the world (at least Vegas) for making non-Japanese people of Las Vegas aware of something called izakaya.  They started the craze by offering up good Japanese-style tapas in a communal setting, in the heart of Spring Mountain, WAY ahead of their time.  They've been around for at least 10 years, at it's just recently that this run of izakayas have emerged in town.  Perhaps that's why, but this perennially packed joint has lost some of its crowd.  Not to a point of detriment, but I remember going here when you literally had to wait 45-60 minutes to get in, and now it's maybe 5-10 minutes, if at all.  They have a LOT of items, many of which I have no idea what they are.  Aside from getting menus, they are individually pasted all over the walls and I never bothered to check whether it's the same stuff as on the menu.  I think many are not, so it would be worthwhile if you can read Japanese.  The setting is wide open so it's great for people watching, especially since it is frequented by mostly young patrons.  Service is passable, some girls are really nice and others are pretty much all business.  But your stuff comes promptly, and service is rarely something to complain about.  The food, as may be expected from a place with such a large menu, can be hit-or-miss.  I would say most are good to very good, such as myriad of their tofu dishes and excellent fried items (e.g. croquettes).  Some are pretty good (don dishes & grilled fishes), and a few are not recommended (didn't like their udon).  Chances are that you will find their dishes at least acceptable in most cases, so don't be afraid to order.  I have been here many times and I can't say I've ever left with a sour taste in my mouth.  Table-for-1 Factor:  While they have bar seating across from the chefs, I would not recommend hitting up an izakaya by yourself, especially this one.  Just awkward.",

Fortunately we arrived before the 5:00 opening so we were seated as the door opened.   Service was pretty fast. We were sitting at the 'bar' and it was pretty overwhelming. It looks pretty unorganized and the chefs are cooking and plating at record speed.   Okay here's the hard part... Yes, you're given a menu. However, they have a wall menu. I'm not talking one little area. Like the entire restaurant is a menu. It's kinda intimidating yet interesting. It can be a bit intrusive to other diners that are gawking at menu options hanging in their 'personal space.' The area was really tight and I think if they would've known how much food we were going to order they would've seated us at the table. It worked and whatever operation procedures they follow, WORKS!   I really don't think I need to even discuss the food! It's great! My family was in heaven! Prices are crazy cheap for practically everything. Shhh, maybe I shouldn't say that. Please, don't raise the price!   Soooo, just go! Let your guard down and experiment!",

I was wondering in this place why people would prefer to spend $400 for a couple's dinner if you can eat for $8 each at places like this? Is it really 25X more delicious?  We ordered only 2 dishes, but were completely satisfied by both of them. Pork cutlet bowl is probably the most tasty and flavorful fried pork I have ever had, although the rice beneath the egg layer was kind of soggy. Beef udon had this sweet flavor, making it very interesting to taste.  Bottom line: If you have a car in Vegas and want sth to warm up ur stomach after a crazy night, Ichiza is definitely worth the 4 miles of driving.",

    "text": "Ichiza... Ichiza, Ichiza, oh Ichiza!  What a delightful place this is.  Its always there to satisfy my everyday craving of sushi.  Now, I'm quite a big fan of sushi, and coming from the bay, I've got many different options to feed my hunger.  Vegas, however, is a different story.  I'm  always on a mission to find a new Japanese place here, but even with all the other joints I've encountered I'm always drawn back to Ichiza.    Ambiance: crowded and impersonal, but I'm ok with it because its interesting to hear what other people talk about and i love to people watch.    Menus all around: this place has a ton of selections so I make sure that whenever I'm here I take my time and go over some of their new dishes.  I'm not a big fan of the menu layout, I really think it lacks any depth or originality from all the other stuff they have posted on the wall.  I wished that they would print those things on the menu instead because it's such an inconvenience for me to have to hover over people trying to read the signs.  Other than that, if you're not shy about it I say go for it because if you choose to order from the menu you're missing out on some great stuff. *you can always go on yelp through your phone and look at pictures.  The yelpers are pretty good at posting pics with names so that helped me with my ordering!*  Food: grilled salmon steak, miso cod, salmon sashimi- always a win for me.  Yellowtail tar, tar- sometimes it's good and sometimes the crispy cracker is overcooked.  I really like the wasabi octopus!!  My BF is always trying out their different rolls, I'm not a big fan of rolls in general so i don't bother (but I've tried and they're just ok).  Uni with ponzu sauce is a real cute dish and absolutely delicious.  I also really like this fried squid dish that's served with a side of some tangy sauce.  Lightly breaded and fried just right- crispy and soft.  I really like the shabu, shabu salad as well.  The peanut dressing has just enough sweet to it. Desserts are a different story here.  I don't know what the fuss is about regarding the honey toast; it ain't all that and definitely not worth the $7.50 or so.  I've only tried it once and that one time didn't hit home for me.  Their cheesecake tastes like it was store bought from Costco, the ones that are pre-sliced sold in their bakery.  I've also tried the soy mousse thing and the texture, taste, and consistency is all too weird and not appetizing at all.  Given this, i'd definitely pass on dessert and would suggest you go down to the tea station (below Ichiza) and grab yourself a drink to satisfy your sweet tooth.  Service: is friendly and just ok.  They work as a team and are all over the place but they do their job and they get it done.  Overall, for the price that you pay and the quality of food it's a win, win situation for me!  Ps.- although not 24hrs, this place is still open late enough for those who want sushi, but prepare to wait because Ichiza is not that big and they've got a lot of people coming to eat. Enjoy!!",

The wait for a seat can be long, but well worth it. Lots to choose from which can be confusing but part of the fun. Sorry for any rehashing of the info, but these are my thoughts:  1.  beef tongue skewer- my favorite, tender and tasty. I ordered more. 2.  chicken gizzard skewer- a little dried out 3.  miso butterfish- flavorful but a little undercooked and chewy. My fiancee loved it. 4.  fried breadcrumb quail eggs- different texture, real good with the sauce. 5.  red snapper carpaccio- very refreshing after eating all the grilled meats. 6.  salmon sashimi- can't go wrong, very fresh. 7.  bacon wrapped mochi- goddamn! you wrap bacon around old socks and it'll taste good! 8.  banana crepe- not impressed. They ran out of the toast at 7pm!",

My lips were glowing with oiliness after leaving this place, and my wallet was probably shining with delight from having not gone to N9ne steakhouse instead, but food here was definitely not up to expectations.   We dropped somewhere between 80-100 for three people on many of the items previously mentioned and shown in pictures. Everything was light and oily (not in a bad way), but we didn't experience any flavor or texture kick. Every dish tastes like it can be prepared from home with some MSG stock drizzled over a central meat or veggie.   I did like the look of the place (food pictures everywhere) and the kind and patient service. For anyone with a limited number of meals in Vegas though, I would definitely skip this one.",

    "text": "Came here because I was looking for a place to have a birthday dinner for a friend, and I needed to keep the bill to less than $50/person.  Found out about it here on yelp.  We did it...$33/person after eating till we were stuffed and had some to spare and plenty of sake and beer.  I made reservations well in about a week in advance, for a party of 18 people. It was a Sunday night around 745pm and the restaurant was packed.  We were seated promptly.  There are menus they provide and then there are tons of postings on the walls with alternative menu items.  You kind of have to start at one side of the wall and slowly take in everything, otherwise it's quite overwhelming and you start just ordering everything cause everything sounds so good.  If you've been to Honda Ya or Shin-Sen Gumi, then I'm sure you're used to it and this is similar to those places.  The food is hit or miss.  Great thing is that because they're small plates, you can try many different things.  Good ones to try are the  braised cod, or any of the yakitori and the grilled salmon. There are handrolls that you can make yourself too, but I'd rather just have them do it for me.  Someone in my party ordered the baked potato with the cod roe....that I'd skip.  We just asked the waitress what was good and she gave us a few suggestions.  Didn't really try their rolls. I'm not sure if I'd want to at a place that is known for izakaya.  The must have would be the honey toast for dessert.  Sooo yummy!  Note: If you're taking a cab here, it might take you a little while to find a cab back.  Suggestion would be to go to the Asian Plaza next door.  If you stand out on the street side for a little bit too...maybe 5-10 mins you should find one.",

Ichiza was set up in this manner as well, but it seems that food is the main occasion over the sake.  But that's ok.  Japanese hand written signs are hung on the walls everywhere and a menu is provided.  It's kind of like a Tapas joint where you order many items, they are small in nature and you share with your table.  So many good items like Bochoy, Shrimp Garlic Eggplant, Grilled Squid, etc.  Don't expect your standard Japanese fare like Tempura or Sushi (although they serve them).  No ridiculous Japanese Steak house either, which really bothers me since those places aren't traditional Japanese fare.  This place is traditional Japanese fare where you can't get most of the items in most American Japanese restaurants.  Seating is limited and at times you will share a table with others.  Parking is bad and I usually have to park in the lot adjacent to it.  Give it a try.  I think you will like it.",

I've tried the agedashi tofu, the beef bowl, the butter clams, the chicken gizzard with garlic, takoyaki, and more. Needless to say, it is all very good! The yakitori is also pretty good, but they don't have the selection as some of the other places that I've been in LA (Shin Sen Gumi, Honda-Ya). They do have a good beer and sake selection so a great place to come drink. And of course if you have enough room for dessert, you have to get the honey butter toast.",

Again, it's hit or miss. -Spicy Tuna Roll: Usually really good. Perfect amount of tuna, roe and cucumber. But the last time we went, it was super salty and spicy.  -California Roll: You really can't go wrong with California rolls, can you? -Grilled Mackerel: Simply grilled with a bit of salt and a squeeze of lemon. Yum! -Shrimp Fried Rice: Flavorful. It would have been better if they didn't shower the dish with salt and pepper though. -Oyster Mushroom wrapped in Chicken Skin Skewer: One of their experimental dishes that we ordered off the wall. Sounded promising, but was disappointing. Texture was too rubbery.  Wait: This is a really popular place so there is always a wait. You should definitely call to put your name on the list as you are headed to the restaurant.   Service: They are always really busy so the servers aren't very attentive, but the food comes pretty quickly.   Atmosphere: Gets really loud here on weekends.

    "text": "After a weekend of fast food and tasteless cafeteria food at the Grand Canyon, we were in search for a decent dining option in Vegas before heading back to our respective home cities. I used Yelp to find Ichiza. When we got there at around 7PM, the place was pretty packed and we were told the wait would be at least 30-45 minutes. Our flight was around 9ish so we were cutting it close but decided to wait since nothing else seemed appealing around the same plaza.   Ichiza's host (perhaps owner) was really patient and nice, trying to help us as much as possible to make sure we get a table and still make our flight without rushing too much. After 20 minutes, we got seated and the food came within 5 minutes after placing our orders. Everyone was really nice, being sensitive to our time constraints, etc.   Now for the food -- if I had never had izakaya-type food, I think I'd give Ichiza a little bit more love. But having eaten at places like Gochi and Tanto in the South Bay, CA, it's hard not to be somewhat impartial to this little place off the Vegas strip. The range of food was great, but the quality wasn't consistent for each dish (e.g. karaage chicken and miso ramen = no good). But still worth checking out when you're in Vegas. Place is open until 3AM and call at least 2 hours in advance to secure reservations.",

Arrived, advised the greeter that I had reservations, which I made on their website, only to be told that the website rez tool doesn't work.  Not a good start.  But soon thereafter, I took note of what everyone here has been talking about as this place kicks ass.  I'll save you the time by not raving about the common stuff (yakitori, etc), but other less conspicuous items were fantastic (tako wasa, etc).  My buddy and I (mostly me) downed large bottle of Hakkaisan sake and was feeling real good.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone, and especially to those that need to entertain Japanese guests at a fairly authentic-tasting place in LV.",

When we confronted him about it, he said there might've been a mistake and he corrected it. This is just not right, some shady things going on! It is unacceptable for a restaurant to not give the right amount of change, and it seems like this manager was trying to do it on purpose!",

    "text": "I love Japanese restaurants that are open until 2 am!! As any Japanese place, the size of the restaurant is small so sometimes there's a bit wait.   When you walk in, there is an awful smell because the kitchen is right by the host area. And when it's super busy, it gets kinda chaotic and overwhelming since everything is compressed in a small area.   THE FOOD ITSELF IS BOMB!!! AND IS PRESENTED TO YOU VERY ELEGANTLY.   A lot of the great food they serve isn't on the menu, so LOOK AT THE WALLS, if you see a picture of a certain food on the wall, ask your server!!   What to order: -Butter corn=5/5 The butter corn is hands-down the best thing there. It's on these chips with lettuce and savory sauces. It may sound odd, but it's so good. It's also around $2!!!  -Yellowtail tar tar=5/5 This consist of yellowtail, herbs, rice, and avocado on these chips. If you love avocado and raw yellowtail you must get it!! It cost $6.95!!  -Takoyaki=4/5 They serve 5 takoyakis on a plate. The takoyaki here is definitely one of my favorites in Vegas. They aren't tiny! They make it in an appropriate CHUBBY size. I would give it another star if the octopus inside it wasn't so chewy.   -Deep fried California roll=4/5 Simple and yummy. I always get it because I always have to buy a roll at a Japanese place.",

We ordered a deep fried natto roll with maguro and yamakake on top. At one point and time, I was ok with natto, but this experience proved that I had, somewhere along the line, grown out of that phase. Bleh!  We also ordered tripe soup, but I've eaten enough tripe to know better now. We also ordered skewered beef tongue, yakitori, tonkatsu musubi with shiso and kelp, and vegetable croquette.

Hole in the wall restaurant = delicious food and I was right. We went there on a weeknight and there was still a wait. I can't imagine how it would be on the weekend.   We ordered the eel kariage tempura roll, grilled squid yakitori, tom yum roll, and the ramen DX. Each roll had wonderful sauces that complimented the ingredients very well. I was really surprised that the tom yum roll really tasted like it was Thai. I could taste the lemon and the chili. It was so strange, yet satisfying at the same time. I love grilled squid and this one was well cooked. My only complaint and it's a small one, would be that the ramen was under seasoned, but I enjoyed the noodles very much.   The service is quick and fast. Prices are reasonable, but remember that you are ordered small tapas style dishes for the most part so don't expect to order only one or two plates.   I'm definitely coming back the next time I'm in Vegas.",

It was super busy at night here, but luckily the wait wasn't too bad.  The interior reminds me a lot of Kappo Honda back home in OC. We sat at a table and had to take our shoes off, which was nice in a way. My group ordered a bunch of food and all shared, but I can't remember each dish so I'll write about the most memorable  Kobe beef tataki - A MUST, good fresh meat flavor Sashimi - I can't remember which fishes we got, but they were all pretty damn fresh for being in Vegas. It's also pretty damn cheap! I believe it was hamachi, yellowtail, and salmon  I also got some grilled stuff, the tongue was pretty good as well as gizzard. The chicken meatballs weren't as good as Torihei in Torrance so you can skip on that.  Service was fast and drinks were always refilled. Food came out fast as well so if you're on a time crunch, come here!",

    "text": "I love Yakitori with the passion of a thousand skewers and Ichiza gives me my Yakitori fix, effortlessly. I won't beat around the bush and admit that you will encounter some misses here, but the hits definitely outweigh them. This is an uber casual, a la carte, Japanese Izakaya style dining restaurant, with everything served on tapas-like portions. They also typically get pretty full during weekend dinner rush hour but we have never waited longer than 10 minutes.  We typically get seated at the giant family style table with other patrons.  My recommendation is to stick with the Yakitori items and steer clear of the specials that are trendy, \"gimmicky\" dishes, some of them are terrible. I never pass up on ordering a comforting miso soup and an assortment of Yakitori/ skewers of grilled goodies.   Here are my favorites: * Bacon wrapped asparagus - you can never go wrong with bacon wrapped items! * Chicken meatballs $1.65 - very juicy and drenched in a slightly sweet Yakitori sauce * Chicken - simple grilled chicken on a skewer, but a nice filler * Shishito pepper $1.50 - super simple, but we are shishito fans * Okra - super simple as well, but we are okra lovers * Quail Egg - very simple, but great flavor and fun to eat * Most tender Beef tongue $2.50 - my absolute favorite thing here! Grilled perfectly, very succulent and slightly sweet  Other items I love: * Spicy tuna roll $5.95 - basic roll, but also a tasty way to get satisfied * Miso soup $1.50 - I love their miso soup here! Always piping hot and very chunky with tofu and seaweed * Seared salmon and shiso wrapped with salmon - a wonderful, refreshing combination of flavors * Ankimo with ponzu - (monk fish liver) super fresh and buttery * Uni with ponzu - very fresh and naturally sweet  The SKIP list: * Deep fried chow mein  $7.95 - This item is nasty! Not appetizing in the slightest. The gravy was too gooey and scary-looking. I also couldn't get over how bland it was, it almost tasted like someone randomly tossing things onto the plate with dish water and that's not even the worst part, the fried udon noodles were dry and had a teeth shattering consistency?! * Veggie croquette $4.50 - it was extremely bland, chunky, with unwelcome hard bits, and lacking the smoother consistency we've come to love in Japanese croquettes.  * Yellow-tail tartare - Super thick and hard wonton chips sandwiched with a ton of dense rice in between and the tiniest portion of yellow tail. The flavor was lost in all of the rice.",

It's a small side dish with maybe about a head of baby bok choy in a garlic soup. It had the right amount of crunch to it while exploding with flavor.   FRIED BABY OCTOPUS - my date really liked this dish but I wasn't in the mood for fried food. It's served over a bed of shredded cabbage that I used to dip in the garlic soup from the dish earlier :P   CRAB FRIED RICE - does not have real crab, but instead uses imitation crab. I would have appreciated it if they had noted that in the menu. It was flavorful with a slightly 'burnt' taste to it that I really enjoyed. I can never get that taste without a nice fire and wok. (This was a full sized dish)  SEAWEED SALAD - not your typical seaweed salad that you can buy at the grocery store, but still very good. It comes with fresh strips of seaweed on top of lettuce - an actual salad! Portion is about three times as big as a side dish.  BUTTERFISH - just like butter! It's a small cut of butterfish grilled to perfection. The skin was so crispyyyyy. My date was pleasantly surprised and stated how the name 'butterfish' was so fitting :)   I would definitely come back to try more tapas next time! The couple next to me tried the meatball skewers and the grilled whole squid and were raving about it!",

Don't know what to order?  Start with the staples: Ika Yaki and Tako Yaki while you look through the menu!",

I love uni. If I see uni in a restaurant, I'd have to order and this one didn't disappoint. I love how their takoyaki got more tako than any other places, I guess that's one of the reasons why I'm giving them a 5. The place gives out that vibe that everybody would like to be in when they want to dine in and hang out with others.  Overall, a great find!",

Kinda wish there was more flavor like other ramen places I've been too. There was too much veggies in it. Lastly I had an order of there strawberry Mochi Ice cream. That was ok and yummy. I'm a real critic when it comes to the bathrooms. There's wasn't very clean. I was a bit disturbed. Overall I give this place 4 star rating.",

    "text": "If you love sushi and Japanese food, this is the place to go. Their menu is massive and they have a variety of items listed on the walls that are not listed on the actual menu.   TIP #1: Make sure you take a look at their list of specials on the wall because those tend to be the best! My personal favorite is the grilled squid. It's so delicious and not chewy at all, as squid can be if it is overcooked.   TIP #2: For dessert, GET THE HONEY TOAST!! Oh. my. gosh. it is so good. It is the most unique and amazing dessert I've ever had.   TIP #3: White peach sake. They don't have too much variety on sake but if you like infused sake I recommend the white peach. It is on the sweet side so I would share it with someone. I can usually drink a bottle by myself at most sushi places but for some reason this was super sweet and I just couldn't drink it all alone.   TIP #4: Make a reservation. They open at 5pm and it gets packed right away. If you don't make a reservation you will probably have to wait around 45 minutes to an hour for a table.   TIP #5: Parking is a disaster, as it usually is in most places in China Town. I always park on the lot to the left of the restaurant where the main China Town shopping center is and just walk over from there.",

On to the food, we ordered a bunch of stuff along with the typical yakitori stuff.  The food was good but nothing really wow'ed me.  It may have been the fact that I just simply wasn't hungry.  We did make the mistake of having a few drinks and appetizers at a restaurant inside the MGM.  We definitely ordered too much food as we had leftovers.  Did however try their honey toast which again was good but nothing spectacular.  Will have to go back to try again.",

Alexis was impressed by the cuisine and the flavor.  We probably ordered  7 different specials. Our favourites were the squid, red snapper carpaccio, and the agadashi tofu. Not bad and always amazed!

The atmosphere and decor made me miss Japan T_T  If you're looking for authentic Japanese food and want to experience what a Japanese \"diner\" is like but can't get to Japan, then come here. I'm sad we don't have one in Cali!  A majority of the good stuff is written on the walls. Yes the menu's on the walls are the one's you want to order from. While it seems odd, if you can't read Japanese you're gonna have to get up and read the English.   My friend took me here for my birthday last month as I was spending it in Vegas. When I'm in Vegas, I don't really eat at the hotels, rather I go to the local places with my friends.   I do remember ordering the grilled saba, my friend got some beef stew, there was some noodles, ramen and grilled tongue.   I loved my saba! While I'm not a salty person, Japanese people love salt, and well the saba was just way too good. I didn't even eat it all because I got full.   After that my friend ordered the honey toast... OMG. LoL. Seriously it's just Japanese Bread, stacked, hollowed out with ice cream in the middle and honey poured on top. Simple yet love.   If you don't know Japanese bread, it's thick. Thick and good. This is a must have if you're going to come here.  I will definitely come back here! It's like, if you miss Japan, you need to come here.   The waitresses and owners are nice too. I felt like I was back in Japan. I was proper. LoL  Oh yes the bathrooms are clean too. haha.",

    "text": "What a hidden gem off the strip :) Great authentic Japanese tapas restaurant offering all sorts of Japanese dishes you wouldn't be able to find ANYWHERE else.  Off thier regular menu, we ordered the spicy tuna roll ($5.75). You get 8 solid pieces of spicy tuna! What a freaking deal!!! Fish was really fresh too!  After seeing so many pictures of the \"Tar Tar Yellow Tail\" ($6.95) we had to get this. And this was definitely one of our favorite dishes. Rice, avocado, tomato, lettuce, and chopped yellow tail layered between fried  biscuits. SO unique!!! Nice summer dish!  Another item off thier special menu, we got the \"Eel, Kakiage, Tempura Roll\" ($6.95). This was a california roll (avocado, crab, cucumber) topped with tempura, sashimi, and eel. There was NO way you can get this all in one bite so we ended up taking it apart to eat. Very good! The sweet sauce on the eel went nicely with the creamy avocado of the california roll.  Next we 1/2 an order of the \"Tom Yum Roll\" ($6.95). This had tempura shrimp, avocado inside and another piece of cooked shrimp and cilantro was placed on top of the roll. Then this combination was wrapped in a spring roll wrap. Honestly? Nothing special. and not really worth $7 for 4 pieces. But a nice light taste especially after squeezing the lime juice on top.  Again, after seeing so many yelpers post a picture of this Honey Toast ($7.95) dessert, I had to have it! The thing is HUGE. It is literally half a loaf of bread. NO JOKE. Topped with a scoop and vanilla ice cream and drizzled with honey. I would say 80% of the people here got the dessert. And to my surprise the bread is so light and fluffy that we almost killed this thing between the2 of us! crazy!!! The toast is REALLY soft in the inside and toasted on the outside. A simple and light dessert! A must try here!  Warning - food comes out really slow and it would be wise to make a reservation. There were tons of people waiting outside even when we left at 8pm. They did take reservations for us on a Sunday night and we were seated right away :)  What a unique experience and truly a hidden gem away from the strip!",

So what is all this talk about the Honey Toast?  I was quite hesitant because how can toast +honey+butter+a scoop of ice cream get that many citings on yelp reviews...and it's like $10. So because of yelpers, I had to try it...and I must say THANK YOU. It was the most scrumptiously delicious dessert I've eaten in a long time.  It had a great natural honey sweetness, a creamy vanilla ice to balance  and all on top of this huge piece of buttered crispy toast that gave it awesome texture.     So why not a 5 star? Because my group had at least 10 different items, and I could only remember 2 things that really stood out.  Hmm, 2 out of 10 isn't that great of a ratio. But at least I don't remember anything bad, right?",

    "text": "In Vegas for a bachelorette party, and it was our last night in town. After a lot of gambling, a 5-course meal at Picasso, a show at Thunder Down Under, and the V Lounge, we were ready for our second dinner.. aka midnight schmorgusborg. Took a cab from the Venetian, and in 5 minutes we were at Ichiza, at 2:30am. How awesome that their kitchen was still open? How great was it that there was the shortest wait, and the staff was enthusiastic and kind? It was all great. 5 stars, no joke.  Random sheets of 8.5x11 sheets of paper taped up on the walls with various delectable items to order, as well as dry erase boards that have specialties listed. You also get a small half-sheet printout of what the daily special is. Each diner also gets a small tofu+seaweed salad to start.  Chicken Gizzards - main reason we came, was craving this all day, and we got them two ways - garlic fried and also skewered and grilled -- delicious!! just the right amount of chew, and it was delectable Whole Grilled Squid - it was fairly impressive to see an entire squid on a plate, and it was cut up to quarter inch lengths -- char-grilled and very flavorful Uni - uni uni uni oooooooo--neeeee - wow this was amazing, the uni is served in half a lemon, and we ordered 7 of these -- fresh, sweet, so worth it Crab Row Croquettes - crispy outside, and yummy not-too-gooey inside, served with a side of tangy dippy sauce Broiled Mushrooms - more than 4 types of mushrooms, cooked to perfection -- however, if you want lots of flavor because you are somewhat tipsy, then you gotta add some soy sauce, otherwise the natural mushroom flavors may seem a bit tame Honey Toast - so my friend said they forgot to toast the interior cube of bread, but it was my first time having it, so I didn't miss the toasting. Basically, a big cube of texas toast hollowed out, and served up buttered and drizzled with honey, and a side of vanilla ice cream  I regret that I was so eager to try their small plates that I completely neglected to order any of their ramen dishes. I would definitely come here again, and I do recommend it for late night dining and a great place to bring friends.  This place is in Chinatown, so it's not walking distance to the Strip, and there is a shortage of taxicabs in this side of town. Be prepared to order a cab to pick you up, and the restaurant staff is helpful at placing the call and giving directions on your behalf.",

    "text": "On the second floor of a strip mall off of Spring Mountain and Arville in the Chinatown area has a great Japanese restaurant called Icheza.  The restaurant is rarely slow.  That tells you that this place is doing something right!  Best time to avoid having to wait an hour or two is to come in right when they open at 4pm or really late night before they close.  On a Friday or Saturday night, even late night sometimes the place is crowded.    You get a wide variety of people, a mix of young and old.  I have met poor college students to a CEO of a Japanese company eating at the Icheza sushi bar.  The prices are reasonable!  You can order many dishes for around $5.  Two people have a nice dinner for $40.  Most of the staff are Japanese.  This helps give Icheza a unique feel of an actual Japanese restaurant in Japan.  To American standards, Icheza's dining area is small.  There is one \"sharing\" table that seats up to 10 people, six tables for 4, two Japanese style tables where you take off your shoes that seat 8 and a sushi bar that seats 12.  With the limited seating, make sure to call in a reservation if you are planning on eating during prime time or take your chances.  Odds are, you will be waiting at least an hour.  The staff is friendly but busy.  Give Icheza a try!",

Quality of the food's gone down a tad since they first opened, since there's a million things on the menu now, but it's still one of my more favorite japanese places to visit - especially late night!   Some of the more favorite dishes to order - hamachi tar tar, hamachi with jalapenos, uni with ponzu, garlic chicken gizzards, fried oysters (seem to be seasonal), gyu don (was amazing when they first opened, now-a-days seems like the microwave variety).  Haven't really had any sushi or rolls here, as there are better places for that - same goes for the ramen and stuff.  Stick to the goodies and specials written on the walls and some main-stays on the menus and it will be a great time!  Oh, and drink lots.  Cheers! :)",

    "text": "Ichiza is a izakaya restaurant located in close proximity to the Las Vegas strip. My friends and I took a cab from the strip and it came to be ~$10 per ways. Compared to other izakaya restaurant, Ichiza is suited well for informal gatherings with friends and companions who are adventurous when it comes to food. I would not recommend for dates or casual after-office meetings (as most izakaya's are for). I like to think of Ichiza as the younger, hipper version of its upscale, intimate Raku, counterpart.   Both Raku and Ichiza serve decently made traditional izakaya entrees . Food presentation at Ichiza is lacking compared to Raku but they have more varieties of dishes for one to try. The one complaint I have of their menu is that a lot of their more interesting varieties are scribbled on pieces of paper that are pasted against the wall. Therefore, making it inconvenient when you are ordering. So, make note of good dishes that are recommended to you either through word of mouth, bloggers or yelpers. I can definitely say that are enough options to feed a mouthful with splitting open your wallet.  I went with a group of 8 friends, ordered many ~16 dishes and it came to a total of ~$17 pp. It is a izakaya, so you can eat/order however much or little you would like.  My recommendations are the following (please note that I do like raw fish and sometimes meat, if fresh enough, so I will note any dishes that contain raw items):  -Takoyaki: \"OCTOPUS BALLS\" (not literally) If you have never had this, you MUST try. I am from the bay area where a lot of Japanese and asian families live and rarely do I see takoyaki on menus. Not only does Ichiza have it but it is done to perfection.   -Okonomiyaki: I believe this is seasonal. The texture and flavors is very similar to takoyaki except that it has more vegetables and no octopus balls. Think of it as traditional Japanese pizza  -Hamachi tartar: excellent textural contrast between the flaky rice placed between two crisp wonton skins and topped with smooth and buttery hamachi tartar with avocado. This was amazing  -Ichiza DX Ramen: I enjoyed this VERY much. Perfectly al dente ramen noodles, beautifully refreshing soup, delicious pork loin? pieces. I can slurp up every bit of it. The normal portion is humongous. We got 2 to share between 8 people and it was plenty. You can also get the half order if the normal size is too large  -Fried Oyster: Burst of oyster juice and flavor in your mouth. I loved the various condiments they provide as well  -Grilled Eggplant with Shrimp: really good sweet and spicy flavors that reminded me of authentic szechuan goodness. The sauce was so addicting that people just started dipping everything in it! haha  -Anything Hibachi grilled would probably taste excellent! We had the beef tongue (:D), pork with shiso leaf (very unique flavors kind of like mint and basil) and yakitori (loved this)  -Bacon wrapped mochi -Beef Tataki -Broiled Miso Cod  Honey Toast is supposed to be really food but we were already too stuffed to keep going. But to be honest it is a just a huge slice of toasted asian breast drizzled with honey and vanilla ice cream. It does sound good but could be something you could make at home.   Overall, Ichiza is a lot of fun to eat and converse in. I would recommend!",

My advice would be just to read what's on the walls first and then order because the menu isn't updated. The experience overall didn't really meet my group's expectations. And I didn't find out about their \"shutdowns\" until after I left, I'd google that btw.",

    "text": "I just feel sort of \"eh\" about Ichiza. I don't really love it, but I don't hate it either.   I have been here two or three times, and both times, I ordered the Mapo Tofu dish. The first time, it was mildly spiced, not too hot. The second time (maybe about a year later), its gotten pretty spicy. I have ordered Mapo Tofu at an actual authentic Chinese place, and it's not served spicy unless you ask. I realize that traditionally, it is made super spicy, but still. I have heartburn, so it would have been nice to know they amped up the spice level since last time. Another odd thing: They don't serve rice with it. Soooooo, wait. I'm supposed to eat M. T. like it's soup? It is always served with rice. Not here. You have to buy rice separate, and they give you the smallest bowl ever. Hmm.  They have some very interesting flavor and texture combinations here, so it is really cool if you are \"one of those people\" who enjoy food more if it has got a different kind of feel on the tongue. But taste for me was just good, not amazing.  The food comes in smaller, almost tapas-style dishes, which make it fun for a few people to order a bunch of things and share. But what you end up paying doesn't really seem to balance out with how much (or little, depending on how you look at it) you get. I will say the Honey Toast is so good, and they give you plenty of ice cream to go with it.  Side note: sort of annoying that many of the items on the menu are... Not on the menu. They are on the walls. So you have to try to read these small pieces or paper put up all over the place to get a full idea of what to order. Slightly bothersome, not gonna lie.  I had a great time with the Yeep-etts Terri and Sandy! If I get invited, I will probably go back to Ichiza, but probably not ever on my own.",

Yes, most plates were small but everything was bursting with flavor.  The ramen and the chow mein were HUGE though, so I was definitely full!  I was teetering between 4 and 5 stars.  My husband says I give too many 5 star reviews...maybe I just thoroughly enjoy food?  Then came the honey toast.  That made Ichiza earn the 5th star in my book!  Delicious, buttery...it would make an amazing breakfast!  My husband saw it and said, \"Oh, that's all you,\" because he isn't a huge dessert person.  I haven't been much of a desserts person lately since I get so much of it at my bakery.  I honestly don't even love honey.  But that thing.....oh my!  We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Been bookmarked to try for ages...  We happened to be driving by around 6pm and realized it might be early enough to snag a table without much of a wait. No such luck. A one hour estimate sent us back to the car for a power nap. When we returned, however, we found our name crossed off and that of many others. Alas, the line had moved a lot faster than their estimate (ended up to be only 20 min), so be aware, even overestimates happen.   Along with the overwhelming menu which they said was \"basic\", the walls were wallpapered with handwritten flyers with various specials. It wasn't easy to see everything, and our table mates had already seemed to figure out the lay of the land (and the 'best of' yelp) so we followed suit and got a few of their best loved dishes. I would have loved to walk around and read everything.  The grilled squid was great. It was served more or less lukewarm temperature, sliced width-wise but presented whole, in a light sauce and grated fresh ginger on the side. So tender, and the the grilled flavor nicely balanced with the others. It was also substantial, and filling. The agedashi tofu was also great. I really liked the mochi with wrapped bacon. The bacon was neither overly salty nor fatty nor chewy, just a thin non overpowering sheath on the mochi. We tried the chicken gizzard yakitori, which neither of us liked. It was chewy/gristly nondescript. We also had a sushi with fresh eel (?) on top that I liked.  The honey toast, yeah, it's large, probably too much for two and seemed about right for the four of us. The honey soaked bread underneath the ice cream was the motherlode. I'd like to try this at home sometime. it seems simple but was really good! Definitely gotta come back and try more stuff!  Quick Update almost one year later (12/30/13). I highly recommend reservations above any type of food recommendations here. Despite the vast experience of the gentleman at the front, his estimates are far too unpredictable. Last year he overestimated by 40 minutes on a one hour wait. Today he underestimated by 50 minutes on a 30 minute wait. However this year we had our baby with us so a major understimation ended up to be a deal breaker, which was rough since we had already waited 40 min only to be told that.",

    "text": "Came here actually after seeing some girlfriend's facebook pictures of all the awesome food here from several years ago. This review is written after 2 visits.  First visit I came with the bf, we had a bunch of appetizers like the Takowasa (wasabi marinated raw octopus) and others and they were all fantastic. We also had the sashimi platter which was delicious. We also ordered the ramen, which weren't to our liking since we've been spoiled by all the ramen shops in SoCal but none the less was very good. Awesome izakaya atmosphere and I can see myself going there at night for a good time next time. We got the honey toast to go and ate it in the car on our drive back to LA and it was just so good.  Came here again with friends several weeks after and we re-hashed a bunch of the appetitzers along with the beef tataki as well as the miso black cod which was so smooth and buttery, the miso added a depth to it that was super satisfying. One of us got a curry beef bowl and I heard good things about it. We again got the honey toast but this time we had it there it was every better since the toast was still warm and the crush was crunchy and so good with the honey and the ice cream... MMMMM!  We'll be back for sure!  ===================== 1 star - \"will be telling everyone to stay away\" bad 2 stars - it's okay, i won't return 3 stars - it's okay, i'll come back 4 stars - it's pretty good, i'll come by again! 5 stars - it's really good, my go-to places!",

    "text": "Been itching to review Ichiza so this should be an easy one.  Located on the 2nd floor in a ginormous \"Chinatown\" plaza, it can easily be missed.  I'm a regular at this plaza (shoutout to my parents who love going here) but only until recently was I able to finally try this place.  Be careful, it's a small restaurant so reservations are a must!  The menu is jam-packed, and is also written all over their walls in Japanese.  Since I can't read Japanese (so who knows what is REALLY written on those walls?), I have no choice but to read the menu, and booy is that an insane amount of information to intake.  SOO many choices!  They cover any type of Japanese craving you might have, whether it's rice, ramen, meaty shtuff or just dessert.  Being the chunky that I am though, I wanted it all.  And all did I get (shoutout to my brother and bf for ordering the other two entrees I wanted and saving me from looking like the ultimate fatty).    Since my fam likes to eat with their eyes, we ordered way more food than we can handle.  The gyoza came out first, and all you hear are \"oohs\" and \"aahs\".  Yeah, I know, it's only gyoza.  But it looked SOO good!  It was perfectly cooked, with some burnt parts, some crispy. LOVE, love!  Then we had fried octopus balls. Then we had main dishes, miso ramen, breaded pork cutlet.  Heaven never tasted so Japanese-y before!  I gots to admit, the Honey Toast was a bit pretentious, looks much better in picture, still good nonetheless though.  See you soon again, Ichiza!",

    "text": "For many years, this was THE only decent Izakaya in Las Vegas. Actually, one of the few \"pretty pretty good\" Japanese restaurants. Double actually, one of the only Japanese restaurants run by Japanese people. And so...it was busy, and quite good (for Las Vegas).  When I visited last week, the owner/manager who always stood in the front - glaring at you - was gone. I mean, gone gone. The place was functioning like the kids took over - disorganized, sloppy  and rude service, condescending staff...like some magical fairy or Doraemon came in here and just sparkly-poofed Ichiza into another typical mess of a fake-Japanese restaurant.  Being an Izakaya, we (party of 4) did not order one thing and find ourselves disappointed. And no, we did not order \"rolls\". We ordered Japanese food. And it was terrible. All of it. Not one person in our party finished their food.   The yakitori and gyu-tan was bland, burnt and dry. The ramen was nasty. And as to the plethora of teeny tiny dishes of stuff we chose off the wall, the only memorable thing was this nasty and (still half frozen) fried cheese thing that was a lactose disaster waiting to happen.  Sometimes a restaurant has a bad night. But something was wrong here. If I found out that they sold it, I would not be surprised. When everything is off, its time to go elsewhere.   Luckily, downstairs is a decent Japanese-run Yakiniku - Yagyu - with a sign/font that looks like its from a Charlie Chan movie. If you don't have fun here - head down there for something far improved.  Still if you're comparing this place to the majority of restaurants on Spring Street, it might even be good. And that's why I hate eating in Las Vegas.",

I wish that they could stay open later than 3, but I would totally ditch the club early to eat here.  A couple of my favs include beef tataki (a must), beef bowl (when they don't run out for the day), karaage, spicy tuna rolls, and sometimes ramen. I'm even a sucker for that peach sparkling sake thing that I can't seem to find anywhere else!   Service is always attentive even when we come during the busy times. Don't forget to end your meal with an order of the honey toast!!",

    "text": "I don't get it. I have heard rave reviews about this place for the past 7+ years, especially for late nights. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I'm quite certain the food is just sub-par. I went out with 3 lovely ladies and we ordered a TON of food. I'm not certain I even remember it all but it went a little something like this: squid in squid ink, squid roll with uni on top, uni in yuzu sauce, spider roll, spicy tuna roll, shrimp fried rice, vegetable tempura bowl, ma po tofu, beef tongue skewers, chicken skewers, calamari, wagyu beef carpaccio, and potato and beef stuff. Some of the items were alright like the yakitori, and the carpaccio, but everything else we ordered, I have had far better elsewhere.   The squid in squid ink was far too salted, all the sushi was mediocre and the uni wasn't top notch, potato beef bowl had a pewtrid aftertaste, and the worst was the slimy ma po tofu. It was so slimy and weird! This is a decent spot if you're looking to sample many various types of Japanese cuisine in one spot, but they don't seem to do any of it very well. After a disappointing dinner, we figured the honey toast wouldn't let us down. Oddly enough, none of us have ever tried to, so we ordered one vanilla and one green tea. I'd say honey toast definitely looks better than it tastes, although the one we received didn't look that great either. The sides were extra toasty, and they didn't seem to saturate the toast enough with honey, so it was very dry. All of us ended up just eating the middles and leaving two huge shells of honey toast on the table. I did however, appreciate the green tea ice cream by itself. The vanilla honey toast was way too sweet being covered in honey. Overall, I will certainly never be returning. I'll save that space for all the fobby Asians that are stampeding through the doors.",

I would have given it 5 stars but the man in the front was unfriendly, for a party of two we waited for a long time, and it was inconvenient to have to look around the room for items not listed on the menu. We ordered the stir fry sliced beef, grilled squid, spinach and tuna roll, and hamachi sashimi. All tasted very good - especially the grilled squid. For dessert, we ordered the honey toast which was very yummy!! Overall, it was a good experience - reservations is highly recommended! Even for a party of one, there was a long wait (a frustrated man walked out).",

I have no idea why the blonde server was acting so rude, but she continued with this attitude to all other diners, she took the plates away when we weren't done yet too. It was so clear to me she hates the job and customers.    We all expect nice Experience when we go to the restaurant, but it is impossible with worker like this to enjoy anything. I really hope Ichiza can fix this problem. For me I don't think there is another visit for this restaurant for sure....there are so many good choices in this town.",

First is the menus, they are everywhere, even on the walls, kind of overwhelmed, and most of them are in Japanese. only if you r Japanese otherwise have no clue what r those on the walls. Second, the portion is very small, always end up eating somewhere after i leave Ichiza. Third, i don't think it's good for big groups. they're always too busy to take care of big party, but they charge service fee anyway. The food is ok for me, im not the only one who doesn't like it, along with my Japanese friends, we are not big fans of this place.",

    "text": "Once again Yelp to the rescue... We went to a 9pm show without eating dinner, by the time it was over we were ravenous but didn't want 'casino' food. So we decided on Japanese food, I did a quick search on the mobile device and entered late night dining. This was the third place to pop up. To our surprise this place is open until 3am on a Sunday!?! Wow. The reviews were great so we drove over to LV's Chinatown area and boy were we glad! This place is in a strip mall on the second floor, its looks like a mom and pop type place. The restaurant mainly had Japanese clients, another good sign, if natives eat there then you know its good. Anyway we were promptly seated in one of the last spots, it was almost 11pm and it was bustling in there. The menu is rather perplexing, we were overwhelmed and were not sure what to order when she asked for drinks and appetizers. I would characterize this place as Japanese 'tapas'. We proceeded to order a bunch of little plates. We started with basics like miso soup and house salad, the dressing was to die for and a rather huge salad nicely presented with all the fixings. We tried their house special roll, very unique in presentation, think California roll with tempura onions and eel on top, f-ing fantastic! We also had a spicy tuna roll and an order of their marinated fried chicken and shrimp fried rice. Again remember these are small plates but plates of yummy flavorful food. The shrimp fried rice was awesome, think benihana but better, not greasy and large shrimp properly de-veined! I was in love and I told my husband so. He was in love with the spicy tuna roll himself, I believe the sushi chef also noticed because they gave us an additional one on the house. The prices here are reasonable too. I would definitely return because there were many many more items left to try on the menu.",

The yellow tail sashimi was alright and it seems like its local yellow tail but for 8.95 the price is okay. The miso butterfish is wayyyyyyy tooo salty so i really did not like it at all. The yakatori was also OK. I would recommend tuna tofu salad but again, its a bit too salty as well. I don't think i would visit again.....",

The atmosphere is great, pictures and hand-written menu items on the walls, low tables where you take your shoes off to dine.  In traditional izakaya style, this place is made for groups to stay a while, get comfortable and make an evening of it, drinking shochu, sake, and kirin ichiban amidst tapas-style dishes ordered off the signs on the walls.  The food is amazing; urchin roe, monkfish liver, bacon wrapped asparagus, ginger garlic sauteed calamari, we had too many dishes to remember them all.  Our \"meal\" was over 2 hours, as we would order one or two dishes at a time, everyone sampling a little of everything, and in the end, everyone walked away satisfied for $25 a piece (6 of us), definitely worth it for the experience alone.  If you're in Vegas and steaks and shrimp cocktails aren't your style, track this place down and spend some of that blackjack money on a sure bet.",

For the past several years, I was working and living full-time in Las Vegas and frequented this place about once a week, because it is near my office.  Yesterday, I took my brother and his girlfriend there fore lunch, and we were extremely disappointed by one of the entrees.  She ordered the pork cutlet and the chicken cutlet combination lunch.  The pork cutlet came out extremely hard (really, like worse than beef jerkey), dried and nearly purple or brown/black in color.  We had to return it and ask for more chicken cutlet.  The chicken cutlet were fresh and tender, however.  But, it really is amazing that the cook let that pork out the kitchen and served it on paying customers.  Both my brother and I ordered the miso-infused blackcod and sashimi.  The blackcod pieces he received, he complained were too small.  However, we both found the blackcod flavorfull and tender and delicious.  Service is friendly but not always informed.  Anyway, I would recommend this place for its blackcod but, really, the owner should do something about that pork and the cook letting it outside the kitchen in that condition.  I'm still amazed.",

    "text": "After reading all these reviews, I've come to the conclusion that awesome Japanese  food (other than sushi) is hard to find ANYWHERE in the continental US (including, the OC).  Yeah, the food is good, but I've had better (in Hawaii, Japan, Singapore and Guam).  The price is great, but the service sucks.  Most of the waiting for tables could be eliminated by better server staff- ( I would have vacated my table 20 mins earlier if the waitress would have brought my CHECK, which had items on it that I never recieved!).  But wait-  how popular would this place REALLY be if  y'all didn't have to wait 30 mins for a table?  Advice for the owners/management:  hire more experienced staff, it can't hurt you (even gaijin can learn to say Irashaimase and arigato),  invest in a simple computer system that allows your staff to have a CONCRETE copy of orders instead of a handwritten chit.   I SAW the food I ordered go to tables that ordered after me, and servers came up to us numerous times, trying give us stuff we never asked for.  If you still plan on going, some advice for you- take the menu outside with you when you're waiting on a table.  Order everything at once, INCLUDING dessert. Take whatever comes to your table- even if you didn't order it, cause chances are something you ordered won't ever get made.",

I didn't want to go based on the fact that I was just in the motherland where noodles are made fresh and 100% legit.. I was greeted by the hostess and was put on the waiting list. however, owner (the old Japanese man) hooked me up and sat us down without hesitation. Once he picked up that I could speak Japanese, things were on easy street.   I was pleasantly surprised with here. Unlike most Japanese places which usually specialize in only one or 2 types of Japanese cooking styles, this place had a little bit of everything. (ramen, yakitori, sushi, izakaya food and agemono)  So I tried a little bit of everything.   My order  Shoyu Ramen  Gyoza  Kushi Katsu (kushi = on a stick)  Bacon & Asparagus  Kim Chee   Surprising all of it was truly Japanese. The ramen was real Japanese style ramen with slightly hard noodles, shoyu broth and Japanese style char siu.   The kushi mono was not that bad either. The katsu was real Japanese katsu and not the L&L type crap.   The secret to this place is knowing Japanese, like most izakaya joints, 75% of the menu and specials are written on paper then placed on the wall. Thus knowing how to read Japanese or having a friend that does (me) will make your dining experience here better.",

The fried sweet potatoes with pork was one of my faves.  And then there was the seared tuna with ponzu sauce which was divine.  My favorite cold dish was the yellow tail tuna tar tar - there was a Spanish flare to it as it was dressed with avocados and some tomatoes.    This place is definitely a fun place to hang.  They have a large dessert selection as well.  I had to try the infamous honey toast, but I was let down.  I was expecting something out of this world, but it was just okay.

I've never been to japan but I feel like this is what it would be like there lol  Their salmon sushi is always so fresh and perfectly cut so if you're into sashimi, I would highly recommend it.  But only reason why I'm not giving them a 5/5 is because of their super shit menus haha they have really small unclear pictures of some of the food and you literally cannot even tell what it is",

    "text": "One of my favorite places in Vegas and definitely one I frequent.  Pretty much always busy especially later on at night/morning. Expect to wait if you're there friday or Saturday night but the waits never really that long.   Most of the items are really good. Definitely order off the walls. Some of my favorites are the hamachi kama (yellowtail collar), salmon belly, red snapper carpaccio, beef tongue, fried quail eggs, yellowtail tartare, ramen with char-sui, chicken intestine, and the pork or shrimp shumai. Theres a ton of other menu items and they keep adding more. Definitely don't leave without the honey toast!  Great ambiance, friendly staff and good casual vibe. Prices are also very reasonable so you can definitely go as big or little as you want. You really feel as if you are in a Japanese pub.",

Here are some dishes I highly recommend: Beef Tataki, Yellow Tail Tartar, and Beef Tongue Stew, just to name a few.   The atmosphere is very relaxed and casual and it's a great place to hang out with a small group of friends. The only thing is that this place fills up fast so its probably best to get there early.",

I could go on about how each dish we ordered was delicious but I'd be wasting your time. Join the adventure yourself of reading the walls, asking table neighbors, and pointing at dishes being brought out from the kitchen. Every part of the experience was fun.  Somehow several small plates later, when you're full and ready for the check, Do Not Forget to order the Honey Toast: THE best dessert offered on Spring Mt Road. Oddly enough we made friends both nights with complete strangers (locals, out of towners, and Canadians). All part of the Ichiza experience!",

The clientele is entirely Asian (not being raciest, just stating a fact), the hand written menu is plastered on the walls and the room is loud with people having a good time.  A True izayaki.  Meaning, you should order dishes to share.  All of the food matches simple Japanese beer so order a bottle, or two, or three to share and then sample as much as you can possibly eat.  The beef tongue is exceptional.  Its so soft and flavorful.  Probably the best thing they serve.  Just don't tell anyone else what you ordered.  The broiled sanma is fantastic.  Avoid the gyoza and \"dumplings\".  They are clearly purchased frozen and reheated.  This is a very popular place so expect a wait.  It is also open very late but again, expect a wait for a seat.  Amazing!",

Beef Tataki - It was good, but the boyfriend wasn't impressed.  2.) Garlic Chicken Liver - It was okay, but he's still not impressed.  3.) Kimchi Fried Rice - 3/5 - I like this one, and I'm really, really picky with kimchi because I'm not a super fan of kimchi. We order this so we get full since the food here is tapas style.  4.) GRILLED SQUID - 4/5 - Really good. I was hesitant to get this one because I had bad experience with grilled squid many times before. But this one is great. It's not chewy or dry. The sauce complements it well. Boyfriend was impressed.  5.) MACKEREL IN MISO - 4/5 - Really good too!! I was hesitant with this one too, but it was really good. Boyfriend is now happy.  6.) TARTAR YELLOWTAIL - 5/5 - Awesome! It's messy to eat, but I don't care. The ingredients are fresh!!! 7.) QUAIL EGGS - 4/5 - Delicious! Wish it was more than 2 skewers.  8.) BLUE FIN POKE - 4/5 - Yum! Fresh. Glides and melts in your mouth.  9.) HONEY TOAST - It's hard to rate this. They're best known for their honey toast. I like their honey toast better than Serenade's in Southwest Vegas. I like that there's fruit inside besides the bread. I like that they put 2 scoops of ice cream because the vanilla ice cream subdues the sweetness of the bread. But I must say, honey toast isn't something I'd have a craving for.   I'd say, stick with seafood dishes. For 2 people, bill came out to $52 without tip. We'll be back!!!!",

I do not get to come here often so it is a guilty pleasure of mine to indulge and go a bit overboard.   1.  Nigori, a must have in my house.  It is an unfiltered Sake' a sweet wine.  It is unfiltered it is cloudy from being unfiltered and oh so good an amazing a sweet blend with the rice and alcohol good cup of adult bliss. 2.  Yellow Tail Tartar a good staple of this place.  Always good and consistent. 3.  Black Cod Miso a second must have for me!  Soft buttery flavor that never quits! 4.  Takana fried rice a 3rd must have for me.  Stir fried rice with pickled veggies =you unknowing people trust me and give it a try!  5.  Uni!  Well, you love it or you hate it I love it here the most! 6.  Onigiri an awesome reminder of our trip to Tokyo.  It is wrapped rice (like Sushi) only with good stuff hidden inside like pork,salmon, act... 7.  A few random skewers like gizzard (not my fave 8/) Chicken meat balls, Mmmm... 8.  Beef carpaccio another if I can have it I am getting it item! 9.  We also got a special it was yellow tail, quail egg and avocado.  I theory sounds great in reality it is not.  To many flavors that blend together and mix all the same texture and nothing that gives it a pop.  In all actuality would drop a star for this one BAD dish but they don't deserve it.  Just not a WIN on my part...  I love this place one of my favorites to take guests to while visiting.  However there is now a creepy old guy in front as mentioned before.  I believe he is running things but it makes the guests and the employees nervous I would prefer he would leave and we could go back to the money making fun from the past.  If you are new here ask your waitresses (that is how we found a lot of out favorites and don't be afraid to try the stuff on the walls it is the best stuff!) they will help you order or look around the room and see what others are ordering and say \"I want to try that, what is it?!\"  We had a couple across from us and I kept hearing them say \"wow, that looks good! We should just get what they get.\"  I felt flattered by that one.  Thanks Guys! :)  Anyways thanks for being my 101 and first for the year to make it a good one!",

This place is mostly known for its small dishes that are fairly tasty.  (Japanese Tapas?) There is a set laminated menu you can order from, or should you have good eyesight and an adventurous palate, you can order off the walls.  There is some sushi, but this isn't a dedicated sushi place, so don't go expecting the full offering of a sushi bar all the time. Off the laminated menu, all the grilled meat on a stick is good.  Perhaps my favorite is the beef tongue.  Ideally, you want to go with a small to medium group of friends and just order a bunch of stuff.   I've had no problems with the service.  My water glass was regularly refilled in a timely manner.  And if you want the honey toast, you need to save room for it.  Also, reservations are highly recommended.",

Had a short wait when we arrived, but I think you get that at all good places, and we were seated in less then 10 minutes. The menu items written all over the walls were fun to read and interpret, but I wonder if I missed out on anything good because I didnt see it written somewhere. :) And some of them were written only in Japanese, so I wondered what they were. Next time I am going to order all the items I cant read, and just be surprised when thing show up.  \"I'll take that, and that, and that...\"  We ordered the deep fried baby soft shell crabs, marinated minced spanish mackerel, Kimchi fried rice, tartar yellowtail, wasabi green bean tempura, and the Mapo-tofu (all for only $44, including 2 large Sapporos).  Everthing was great. The yellowtail was recommended by several people on Yelp, and I agree with them. It was great. A little messy, but I didnt mind that. The baby soft shell crabs kind of caught me by surprise, because they werent kidding about \"baby\" These little things looked like they had just been born, and hadnt had time to grow a shell yet...But they were very tasty. I liked the Marinated Spanish mackerel, served on top of a cucumber wedge, and the Kimchi fried rice was very good too. The beer prices were great too. $5.50 for a large Sapporo, I have paid alot more than that at other places.  The staff was all very friendly, and helpful, and I think everyone who worked there said good bye, and see you next time, as we were leaving. I will diffinately be going back. In fact, I cant wait too.  UPDATE: went here again Saturday evening and it was even better the second time. I'm upgrading Ichiza to 5 stars.",

The only downside is it can be difficult to get a table, so calling ahead or making a reservation never hurts.  The food runs the gamut from typical ramen/udon/noodles to sushi to tempura or robatayaki. The menu is solid, but the real gems are the items posted all over the walls. There are standards that are usually always available, but the changing specials from the chef are some really creative takes on lots of different items (like mochi ravioli and a seafood quesadilla).  Some favorites: - Spicy shrimp and eggplant: shrimp (in their shell) and eggplant fried and then coated in a sweet and spicy sauce - Spicy fried chicken: Japanese style fried chicken with an excellent spicy sauce with a kiss of cinnamon - Fried baby mackerel: the whole-fried tiny little fish - Agedashi tofu: soft tofu, breaded and fried, then served in broth - Seafood quesadilla: a couple of tortillas filled and topped with a variety of diced sushi-grade fish - Steamed shrimp dumplings: probably the best dumplings I've had in LV  And you can't beat the price (as long as you keep an eye on the $15 pitchers of beer) -- especially if you're used to shelling out for mediocrity on the Strip.",

Came here looking to do something off the strip.  After all, how many oversized meals can you handle in a weekend?  Grew up in L.A., so no stranger to sushi and Japanese food.  But of the 12 or so items we tried, only the shoshito peppers and fried rice were edible.  We sent back the spicy tuna roll after my wife spit it out since it was soooooo fishy.  The albacore sashimi must have been caught a month ago- it, too, found the inside of my napkin. Even the other cooked food was horrible.  We hid most everything under the ramen noodles so the waitress would clear the plates. Being respectful to cultural tastes is one thing, so I did not expect to like everything we ordered.  But as a standard by which to measure, fresh fish is fresh fish, no matter where where you are from.  This was not even close.  I would not send anyone to this restaurant for the food. Very friendly staff, and cheap prices for the portion sizes, hence the 1 star.",

The first thing that was notable at Ichiza was that the beer was  COLD!  A pair of cold draft Kirins were perfect match for the several small dishes we ordered. The ramen was good, but not great. The sushi was good and a decent price. They had Toro, which was a generous portion. The agedashi tofu was not to our liking. The coating was kind of gummy. The deep fried baby octopus was excellent. One of the best features of this place to be explored over time are ther many \"specials\" listed all over the walls. Should be a good place for trying various offerings, but might be harder to find a go-to regular dish. They are open late and cater to the strip hotel worker getting off the night shift and looking for a few beers and cheap Japanese food. Not my favorite spot on Spring Mountain Road, but worth a second look.",

If you look closer it has the look of a small outdoor market place. The roof that  juts out from the wall adds to the ambiance of the place. The food here is really interesting and really fun to eat. Each dish comes out on a small plate and you can share with your table. I have no idea what we ordered, but it consisted of fish, chicken wings, chicken meat balls, tofu,  eggy soup, and a variety of other dishes. The best part of the evening was when my friend ordered a bottle of sake. We thought it was going to come out in a small container. The waitress brought out a huge bottle, it was a couple of liters. We had a few laughs and sent it back for the smaller bottle.",

    "text": "Ok. I'm wring a review of Ichiza just to complain this unpleasant experience I had tonight.  I was really really looking foward Ramen tonight and Ichiza was the only place opened at the time near 10 miles from my place.  So, my friend and I went here...  My friend ordered few stuffs like tempura, some deep fried stuffs and something to go. I tried to order Ramen but, my order was simply rejected by the waitress and, being told they don't do Ramen after 12 o'clock.  So...I ordered Udon instead, which was certainly lower than average.  And then, some kind of miracle has happened.  Couple of Japanese guys came in and, ordered Ramen like they order it every day and, guess what? the waitress just took their order.   I could not believe it until she place an order to the kitchen.  I'm telling you... I'm not an invisible man and, I was sitting right next to them.  I asked for an explanation about what happened to another waitress and, all I could hear was 'Of course you can order Ramen'  No explanation, no apologize being said...  I was ignored pretty good...lol  Am I not deserve for a damn Ramen? or a simple explanation?",

    "text": "ok i took off some stars b/c the menus are IMPOSSIBLE to order from.  there is a basic menu with like  60% of the restaurant's offering on it. then theres like 2 little stand up document holders with their desserts and other stuff on it.  everything else is on the wall.  seriously, it's kind of a pain in the butt and i was too lazy to walk around the entire restaurant to check out the offerings.  didn't see the uni mochi, chawanmushi, or most of the pics on yelp on the menu.  HONEY TOAST is a MUST at this place.  it's a little pricey ($6.95) for pieces of toast with honey and butter inside (along with a huge scoop of ice cream) but it's HUGE.  save room for it.  it's pretty damn good.  way better than guppy's brick toast or tea station's toast.  skewers, i def. think honda ya in tustin is a lot better.  but it's decent, i probably wouldn't get gizzard or liver again..they were a little too squishy, even for gizzard and liver!  the beef tongue is pretty good though, very tender.  there's probably like 5 different skewers to choose from.  minus stars for lack of variety (unless there were more options other than the ones on the menu...a very plausible possibility)  everything tasted a bit over-salted, im guessing it's to make you drink more beer???  agedashi tofu wasn't crispy enough, just soggy.  salmon skin salad was good enough but not enough lettuce, just lots of salty salmon skin.      i think if you've never been to honda-ya or shinsengumi yakitori, you would definietly give this place 4 stars and if you've never had japanese izakaya, you would def. give this place 5 stars.  but i give this 3 stars because everything was overly salty and a lot of the clientele seems like people who don't eat a lot of izakaya.  but 3 stars for the honey toast!!!",

And where do they find all these gorgeous Japanese girls in the middle of the dessert?? But, I digress... Here are a few of favorites:  - Spicy fried chicken: Japanese fried chicken is the best. Couple that with a Tabasco based dressing and I'm in heaven. - Red snapper carpaccio: My friend says that's impossible since carpaccio is Italian for thinly sliced beef. I say its madly delicious. - Takoyaki: Sometimes they're soggy, sometimes they're great. You really cant beat the octopus to batter ratio they have; they don't skimp! - Seafood quesadilla: Suggestion from our server. Two crispy tortillias sandwiched around thinly spread sushi rice covered with salmon, tuna, squid, and white fish sashimi surrounded by daikon sprouts and topped off with Cupie mayo. MMM MMM MMM!  When all else fails, flirt with the waitress and ask for recommendations. I'm a girl, but dang those waitresses be cute!",

First time we came here was after dropping $400 for two at Toms steak place in MGM. After filling ourselves and receiving the bill for $40 at Ichiza me and my wallet was pleasantly surprised. We did not have anything to drink so that helped.  Food is awesome. Pork with kimchee great,grilled shishamo. Traditional stuff as well as many creations.  They keep prices reasonable but service is sometimes slow. But to the people who complain about the wait, it's because the food is good. You can always go down the street to somewhere with no wait but here is a reason for that!",

There are many things to eat there, it was cool cuz the servings of the dishes were just enough to try it and not a whole plate of it...opens the opportunity to try other dishes with out getting to stuffed (Like a  buffet but better...it's cooked fresh) ...I left the ordering to my cuz..I had no idea what he was going to order but, hey he's family and I trusted his recommendations. I had no clue he was about to take me on a journey to a whole new realm of food! We ordered a bunch of dishes, he ordered chicken gizzard which was good but, he just told me it was chicken! he ordered beef tongue, told me it was beef...hmm.. he was so vague! and only after I ate it he told me what it was!!!  Note to self remember to ask the right question! LOL! We had sushi too, a bowl of Ramen, there were many dishes it was all really good. Since then I have brought other people to try their food..although just know they are open for lunch but the menu is down to a few selected items like beef bowls, chicken bowls, curry, a very slim menu. They had told me the full menu is only at  dinner time.. I was bummed but, the food at lunch is also good! I would totally recommend this spot to grab some grub!  So dining with Andrew Zimmerman  so to speak, LOL! , well that was my cousins aka name that night! It was very cool to go there with him, he taught me a lot about foods and flavors! It was awesome to see the passion he has for foods! Having someone like that It really helps in the experience of trying new things! Thanks Cuz! Watch out for him one day! He will have his own spot! :)  So if you haven't been to Ichiza! You gotta go!",

Buta Kimchi (stir fried kimchi/pork) - this was so grubbing. they had the right ratio of pork to kimchi - we have a winner - starts randomly punching the air  Honey Toast - yea. sweet. crunch, softness. so good it will put you to sleep. this is the deal to get if your significant other has a sweet tooth. pow pow",

I'm down) and good food (tongue skewers anyone?)  It's great to know that 10 years later I can still come here and have a decent meal.  I brought a first timer and though I don't know if he liked it or would ever come back himself, I'm glad that this place is reliable enough not to embarrass me.  When you bring someone to a place and talk about how good it is, to have it disappoint is very disheartening.  Luckily, Ichiza doesn't disappoint.  I would recommend getting anything on a skewer.  I also can't come here without getting the kimchee fried rice.  This is a must have staple.  Even if you don't like kimchee, order this rice.    Another must have item is the honey toast.  We didn't get any this trip but I know I'll be back to have what I think is probably the best honey toast in town.",

The menu offered a wide variety of food with extremely reasonable prices!  We ordered some seasonal sashimi : fatty tuna and sea urchin (with vinegar) which are totally amazing. Quality-food for sure. Beef curry udon and beef tongue are yummy. We feel lucky to have found this place after a long and tiring day.   Definitely recommend this place if you wish a late dinner!!",

    "text": "4.5 stars! Bumped it up to a 5 though.  The reason it is not a 5 stars is because it lacked a little bit of service, but service was not bad. The food made up for it.  We were looking for Japanese food off the busy areas in Las Vegas and found Ichiza. We were actually contemplating between Sakana and Ichiza but we wanted ramen and rice bowls too so we chose Ichiza.  Parking was ok and although it was around 6 pm on a Saturday, the place was pretty empty. Only after 6:30 people stared rolling in and by 7pm it was a full house.  Noticed the menu didn't have THAT many dishes to choose from but noticed there were lots of dishes that were off-menu and also a \"today's special\" menu. Prices are on the ok side.  I got the Beef Patty Steak Stew (Basically Hamburger Steak) with Cheese and Egg (poached) from the special menu. Others got the Beef Curry Rice (also special menu), Ichiza's Ramen Half Portion and a Chicken and Egg Rice Bowl. For starters we got a order of Shrimp Tempura (comes w/ 3pc) and the Beef Tataki (cooked more to a medium-well).  Let me just say that the food here is AMAZING! I came in not feeling like writing a review here but ended up wanting to write one afterwards. My Hamburger Steak was really flavorful and its portion was really filling. The only downside was that the dish came out after everyone else was basically finished with their food. It took a long time for it to come out. Sadly I forgot to take a pic of it because we immediately dug into the food and finished it before I knew it.   The Chicken and Egg Rice Bowl was also really good. Pretty big portions overall with the rice bowl and the half portion ramen. Ramen was really tasty too, it had a bit of spice to it. My brother loved the curry, he literally didn't leave a single drop of curry. Beef tataki and shrimp tempura also complimented our meal well.  Overall really good food and definitely coming back when we are in LV.",

    "text": "Love dining at Ichiza whenever I am in Las Vegas, and definitely love bringing my friends here if they are willing to venture off the strip.  Ichiza is located on the 2nd Floor of a tiny strip mall near Chinatown (It is in the same plaza as Mian and Tea Station)  There are times that they get busy in the weekends, but usually the wait time is not that bad.  Based on the looks of the tables, menu and decorations, this restaurant must have been here for ages.  Menu is fairly simple to understand, most dishes are for tapas/sharing, and I would recommend getting 3-4 dishes per person dining.  Prices are fairly reasonable.  Average per person can be $25up based on your appetite or whether you order any alcohol with your meal.  Be adventurous and order things that you have never tried before.  You can always ask the waitress for recommendation or whether you have ordered enough or not.  Pay special attention to their daily special by the front door (in english), they do have special items that are not listed in the menu that is definitely worth trying.  Highly recommended.  To the best of my knowledge, they do not take reservation over the phone.  Your wait time might be longer if you have a bigger party.",

I love that they now offer a mini version as the regular size is too big for one person. Definitely get the mini honey toast whenever you come here",

My family and I arrived in Vegas to begin our trip to the Grand Canyon, and we decided to grab some Japanese food before our long drive. I originally suggested Ramen Sora, but my mom hates pork, and Ichiza popped up in my second attempt to find a Japanese restaurant nearby.  The restaurant is located on the 2nd floor of a shopping center. The interior gives off a bar vibe. It seems like a great place to meet up with friends and order small plates and share a few drinks. However, we decided to order 2 entrees to share instead. This was a mistake... We ordered one of their ramen items and a shrimp tempura bowl.  The ramen was extremely salty, and nothing too special. I have definitely had better ramen. It might have been pretty good with less sodium, but who knows... The chashu in the ramen was soft and tender, so it had at least one thing going for it.  The shrimp tempura bowl was extremely disappointing. My mom was pretty upset about the bowl. It literally had 2 or 3 tiny pieces of fried shrimp on top of a huge bowl of rice. No flavor and terrible portioning.   I would not recommend Ichiza for a classic dinner. If you decide to visit, I would recommend tapas-style dining - a lot of their smaller dishes smelled good.",

    "text": "Ichiza is probably the best restaurant I've found in Vegas, and only a short ride from the Strip (or a somewhat long walk if you're insane like me). It's located right in the middle of Vegas's Chinatown district. It's almost like a Japanese tapas bar, most of the dishes are small and shareable. I opted for five different small plates and thoroughly enjoyed each of them.  My favorite dish was the monkfish liver, which was delicately cooked and sliced and had a wonderfully creamy texture with the taste of an elevated tuna steak. It was accompanied with a few small items to add, such as seaweed and green onions, each of which complemented the flavor of the liver perfectly.  I also ordered sea urchin. It was my first time trying it, but it was likewise delectable and delicious. The other items I ordered included fried baby octopuses (think of it as a unique take on calamari) and a couple of yakitoris. When I left, I found that I was content and quite full, but also only owed a fraction of what I would've spent had I eaten a similar (but less delicious) meal like this back on the Strip. The relative cheapness of the food more than makes up for an Uber there and back, and you also gain a better glimpse into the \"True\" Vegas.",

    "text": "Possibly my favorite restaurant in Vegas. It used to be a lot busier but I guess with the izakaya boom it's slowed down a bit. You definitely have to know what's good here because there are a lot of choices and some are just alright.   From the regular menu you MUST get the miso black cod. It's the butteriest, silkiest, most delicious fish you'll ever eat. Other great picks to share for a group are the kushi katsu, yakitori, and shumai. Their ramen is also really good but a little heavy for tapas and not easy to share.   The key here is to order the stuff off the walls. Of these the best are:  -Mochi wrapped bacon. Each skewer has 2-3 pieces of mochi. Sticky and greasy and awesome.  - Jalapeno fried rice. This is my top choice next to the miso cod. Mix in the spicy paste! -Tom Yum Roll. I've never had anything like this. It's seasoned like a Thai tom yum soup but in a sushi roll. It's wrapped in the rice noodles used for fresh rolls and has that same fresh cilantro taste with huge pieces of shrimp. They have half order available.   Other good filler dishes from the walls:  -Wasabi green bean tempura. Some of these can be very spicy watch out! -Croquettes. They have specials for croquettes so ask about them. We had a gratin croquette filled with macaroni and covered in gravy. Otherwise they have regular potato ones.  -Okonomiyaki (seafood pancake) Just because you can't get that very many places.   And last but not least yes. You should have the honey toast because Ichiza did it first (I think?) and still does it the best. If you've never had it you seriously must. They have smaller orders of it available but I can't vouch for it and I'd just go for the big deal.   I love Ichiza for the variety and the overall feel of the place. It's always a good experience and definitely a unique place to bring friends and family and introduce them to a lot of different Japanese foods.   PS. They have shochu which I can't find anywhere in Vegas liquor stores and they serve it on the rocks !",

Service once you get seated is great and the dishes come out as they are made.  Somethings to keep in mind though: 1. It is a small restaurant and gets packed on the weekends.  I highly recommend making reservations before coming here.  2.  The parking in this area is also terrible.  If you get lucky and get a spot, GO YOU!  More likely though you'll have to park a plaza over and walk over.  There are so many dishes here are a couple of my must tries:  Crab Fried Rice - It is worth the splurge for the crab meat.  You will be able to see the chunks of meat and the flavor comes out beautifully.  Butterfish - Yes, this is one of the more expensive dishes and you may be sad at the size of the fish, but the taste is amazing.  It is worth every penny!!    Skewers - For the more adventurous eaters this is always fun to introduce to new visitors of Ichiza.  They do have usual beef and chicken skewers, but my favorites are the chicken gizzard, tongue, and liver skewers.  The out of the box skewers are my go to  Also always remember to check out the specials!  My most memorable special I have had was flying fish sashimi and it was delicious and had an amazing presentation.  I've never gone wrong off the special menu, but it is always changing  This is definitely a fun restaurant to try :)",

It's been a fave of mine for years, and I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review!?! It's definitely a \"hole in the wall\" type spot, but I do not say that in a negative way at all.. to be honest those are my favorite type of spots! They always have the best food! I'm sure by now you've seen many reviews so I will keep it short and sweet by notating my faves on the menu: *wasabi tako (raw octopus with wasabi...not for the faint of heart) *grilled mackerel *Ramen DX (ULTIMATE fave/the pork: OMG delish... I still haven't found one I like better; not even in LA! But I'm enjoying doing the leg work!) *spicy tuna roll (this sounds so basic I know, but it is really fresh!) *Uni in lemon (I'm always so sad when they run out) *The oysters aren't bad either... they typically put fish roe on top and a few other toppings, but it seems to change from time to time. **Add a bottle of nigiri (or a few) and you've got one fabulous night ahead!  Be prepared if you come during dinner time to have to wait...it's a small place and this spot has a very loyal clientele base. If you like good \"home-cooking\" type spots, Japanese food, and you're considering going: DO IT! You won't be disappointed. ;-)",

My favorites out of everything I've tried would be the shabu salad, uni in ponzu sauce, and yellowtail tartar. Everything else was good, but it didn't stand out to me.

    "text": "Ichiza is the type of place that has gained recognition over the years but failed to live up to their standards after a good amount of success.  The quality of this place as gone downhill comparing to the beginning era of this place. Before, it was a cozy environment serving up authentic speciality Japanese items only to make you feel rigged by ordering the same things time and time again.  It isn't as busy as it would be on random weeknights either which is something to be concerned about after developing experience with the restaurant after time. I would definitely go back and back again for their Honey Toast (which is the best in Vegas in my opinion) but other than that, there really isn't anything that stands out to make me want to visit again.  And after a few health department incidents, you kinda cringe about stepping foot into the place again. It's sad to know that Ichiza is one of the first staple Vegas restaurant foodies would know about only leaving you to be disappointed when expecting the same experience once had back in the days.",

The menu is fairly standard and not overwhelming. On top of the transitional izakaya small plates and yakitori skewers, you can also find some kitchen entree, ramen and sushi rolls. Bento style meals are offered during happy hour.  Price is very reasonable and the quality of the food is good. Honey toast is a must try if you never had it elsewhere. Imagine a loaf of soft bread, toasted, drenched in butter, honey and topped with two scoops of ice cream... THAT was sinfully gratifying.",

    "text": "Ichiza is one of those places you go to after you've spent the entire day eating at fancy restaurants on the strip and have gambled away some more dough and now need some comfort food that won't break the bank.   It is an izakaya located on the second floor of a strip mall near Chinatown in LV and it can get crowded late at night.   I've been twice now and had their udon, ramen, albacore sashimi, karaage, honey toast, and most recently discovered that their banana crepe dessert is really good.   The honey toast was better the first time I came and I think one try is enough. Other than that the udon was fine, the ramen was good, and the sashimi was okay as well.  When I visited they had a large menu advertising their cold noodle specials that ran throughout August to combat the desert heat.   One thing about this place is that late at night when they're swamped, the service takes awhile. Just something to keep in mind.",

The waitress asked for drink orders and a few minutes later, she asked for our food orders. Two of us wanted rice bowls and the other two wanted ramen. \"We have no ramen\". We came here due to a friend's suggestion in regards to their ramen. Utter disbelief on all our faces and she simply said \"so beef bowl. That's all?\" First of all, there are three others wanting to order so obviously no, that's not all. Second, she could of suggested something else other than ramen! Anyways, as we looked through the menu, another waitress came by. She asked us if we were ready to order. We mentioned the ramen and she said \"oh! We have another broth that is similar, just lighter\". Thank you!! The first lady could have made that suggestion but no, she was just super rude.   FOOD - Beef bowl: large bowl of rice with lots of meat and toppings. My boyfriend said it reminded him of bulgogi beef but nonetheless, it was delicious. They don't skimp you on meat.   Ramen w/ Pork: the lighter broth tasted great! The pork had tons of flavor as well. Perfect dish for the cold.   Pricing is pretty good. The service overall wasn't bad except for that one rude waitress.",

The exceptional dishes were the Tofu and Sashimi Salad and the Wagu Beef and Garlic Fried Rice.  The salad sounded like an usual combination to me, but my friend promised that it was good - and it turned out to be very delicious both times we ordered it.  The lettuce with the sashimi and tofu mixed with their dressing was perfect.  The other hit was the fried rice. It was nice and moist but not mushy.  The garlic chips were a perfect addition, and who doesn't like Wagu beef?  We also had their sashimi (salmon and yellowtail) and an Spicy Eggplant and Shrimp dish.  All good.   The only complaint is that it's difficult to see what to order if you've never been here before.  My friends knew what to get, but they have so many things written on random pieces of paper on the wall, and their menu didn't seem to have all the good things on it.  So a newbie with no friends with the inside scoop may rate this place lower because it's just so darn hard to spot the good stuff!  This is, yet another, must-stop place for me on future visits!",

The food is ok but not entirely Japanese.  I like their fried rice, ika ring, kushi katsu and yakitori.  Everyone I know raves about the honey toast.  It's alright - the most basic toast you can get.  I've had better in Tokyo (Akihabara's Cafe Berserk) with more variety, whipped cream, ice cream, fruits and chocolate.  Not a lot of places in Vegas serve honey toast that's why Ichiza's seems fantastic.  If only they would offer more honey toast variety, I'd gladly give Ichiza a star or 2 more.  I mean, I'm not asking for much - it's an easy fix.  Just throw in some fruits (bananas/ strawberries/ peaches), ice cream, syrup and whipped cream on top.  Maybe, I'll just open my own honey toast shop.",

However, yesterday, we came here, was seated at a crammed area even though the place was quite empty at first. We requested to move and it wasn't a problem. However, the waitress was so unfriendly, and couldn't understand English well it seems. We had a hard time asking for room temperature water, so we just gave up and asked for water with no ice (which still was cold, but it's not a big deal). Then, the waitress never once came by to take our order. Other servers never walked by either, despite me trying to flag them down. Sitting there looking confused, one of the chefs looked at us and said, \"I can't take your order.\" We placed the order in, and the food arrived relatively quickly. While eating, we see our waitress outside talking on her phone, for a long time. Not once did she check on us, refill our water, or say anything. I had to try to get her attention just to bring the check because she was so disengaged, as if she had something against us. There were less than 10 people (not tables, people) in the restaurant at that time, with about three servers, so being busy would definitely not be a valid excuse.   Asides from the horrendous service, I have to say, the food is pretty mediocre compared to other Japanese tapas places. Also, considering the portion and taste of the foods, the dishes are way too pricey.",

I checked and there's nothing on Hamakata for yellowtail.   Nevertheless, I loved everything about this place. Not too large, not too noisy, infinite amounts of dishes and all at a reasonable price. I really got to give thanks to yelpers in general. I can still remember exactly how each dish tasted like. Incredible.  Next door is a bakery that's also Japanese and supremely delicious.

I had expected it to be a traditional Japanese Sushi Restaurant offering traditional Sushi and such, but it's not.    I saw quite a few people ordered the Ichiza Ramen, so I decided to try it, too.  It was quite possibly the worst ramen I've ever had.  I don't know how to describe the flavor, or rather the lack of it.  I tried adding tons of chili powder and it just didn't work.  I barely finished 1/3 of it.    I also ordered some kind of diced tuna salad.  It came with a raw quail egg on top.  Probably my fault that I didn't read the menu carefully.  I don't eat raw egg of any kind!  My fiance's Pork Katsu was the only thing good.  It was small but I just had to steal a bite from him.    Lastly was the famous Honey Toast.  One word - OVER-RATED!!!!  There was barely honey drizzled on the toast.  The ice cream was too too sweet.  If you like thick piece of toast with very sweet ice cream, this is for you.

Sitting at the bar is an experience and you should try it at least once, you get to see all that goes into each dish and its pretty amazing how efficiently everything is. If you are in chinatown please stop by this place and be surprised how good this place is and then go tell all your friends!",

It seemed very traditional (or shoud I say authentic?). This seems like the place native japanese would go. Much of the food are items that are not part of the typical American palette. The food was good and the service was good. The biggest challenge was that it was so Japanese that it was hard to understand how and what I was ordering. It would be great to go with a translator.",

    "text": "Second time visiting this place. First time, we walked in and found the wait to be about an Hour. So made a quick U-Turn and decided to go elsewhere.. This time, no different.. 45 min. - 1 hr. wait.. I'm not used to waiting in Vegas?! Seriously?!.. OK, this time we waited.  What we had at the Bar Counter:  21. Chicken Cutlet: deep fried breaded chicken (like Katsu or chicken fried steak). Nice crust and the dark brown dipping sauce brought it Alive! sauce was thick and semi-sweet ilke (Katsu/Teriyaki sauce). Chicken was moist and sliced into finger tenders. Plain Good.  62. Kaku - Ni (pork belly w/ egg): small bowl filled with tender and juicy pork in some type of broth/sauce and a half a boiled egg. Full of Pork Goodness!  81. Fried Rice - Kimchi: Nice portion, mild balanced flavor of Kimchi, rice was soft, not mushy and went great with all the proteins.  *Off the Wall/Paper Menu:  Salmon Belly: decent slab of salmon belly fillet with an evident taste of some kind of light vinegar/alcohol flavoring. Came with a tiny mound of super minced radish. Salmon was 'melt in your mouth or on the dish' consistency. It was kind of rich, fatty and Delicious (the radish settled down the richness and fattiness a bit).   Yellowtail Tar Tar: I usually don't do Raw but this time I made an exception because of all the praising on past reviews. 4 pieces, each piece was a fluffy and crunchy tortilla chips layered with rice, avocado and.. yellowtail on top. I couldn't taste the fish much, I just noticed a slight chewiness. Everything worked Really Well, the texture was Amazing and it was an Awesome Tortialla Chip Sandwich!  Atmosphere reminded me of some restaurants in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles (It felt like I was eating somewhere in Japan). No complaints on Service. Value was fair, Japanese portions are hardly ever huge but quality makes up for it. The food was satisfied but nothing really stood out.. I'd come back but I wouldn't wait more than 10 minutes to dine here.",

    "text": "The food is Off the wall!  Actually it's on the wall mostly.  The everchanging menu at Ichiza is mostly written on cards on the wall, and is always being updated.  Expect a unique experience each time you dine, and this place typically gets repeat business.  The small restaurant is centered around the large open kitchen in the middle.  It is really nice to see the chefs vigorously at work while you're dining.  Ichiza is noisy, busy, hip, and worth the hype.   This time we ordered:  Soju w/ lemon juice cocktail - Soju is like a rice vodka.  It's 40 proof, and is typically drank with salty and pickled foods.  It was served with a sliced lemon, a citrus juicer to squeeze the fresh lemon juice out, and some sprite.  Very refreshing, and fun!  Beef Tongue Skewer -   Toothsome, tender, and tasty.  If you've never had tongue, this is a good way to eat it.    Fried Quail Egg - Perfect panko breading, the eggs came on a skewer, which made them easy to enjoy.  The satisying creaminess of the egg beneath the slight crunch from the breading made for a fantastic dish.  Tom Yum Roll - Tempure Shrimp, cilantro, ginger, rice, wrapped in rice paper, served with a lime.  It reminded me very much of the classic Thai soup to which it owes its name.  AgeDashi - Tofu lightly flash fried and served in a light miso broth.  I enjoyed this agedashi very much, except there was a gelatenous film on the tofu.  I don't know what it was, and didn't mind it, although my friend found it visually offensive which ruined the meal.  I am curious what it was, but it didn't have too much impact on the dish.  Baked Black Cod in miso (Butterfish) - Not the best butterfish I've had.  The broth was too salty and the skin of the black cod was mushy.  A crisp skin would be nice, or at least getting the fish without the skin.    Wasabi Octopus - Raw octopus chopped into small pieces, served with fresh wasabi.  Very good flavor and \"burn your nostrils\" hot.  The issue with this dish was the octopus was chewy and cut very small, which made it difficult to eat.  Think kernals of corn in size, but chewy.  Ichiza is a fun way to experience Japanese cuisine, or to get loud with friends, they stay open past 2 AM.",

They tell me its going to be 20-30 minute wait for a table. Its busy so I understand. But I do start to see people who came after me get seated. I asked them about this and apparently those groups had reservations. I have my dining partner who is asian go in and request a table for two, they offer to seat her immediately, she comes out and gets me and it turns into \"oh we were just about to call you for seating\" I let it slide b/c its busy and I genuinely dont know if they were about to seat me or simply seated me then because of my friends influence.  Now, fast forward several months. I go in and ask to be seated for 3. Im the first in my party to get there. Told there would be a 10 minute wait. my wait totals 30 minutes. in that time 2 parties of 2 are seated. I can visually see open seating. Again, I ask about my table for 3 and she states they had \"reservations.\" Again, I send my asian friend in to request a table for 3 and they prepare to seat her. When I come in same story, \"oh, we were just about to seat you.\"  At this point, I get the picture. I was livid and so was the rest of my party, we refused to stay. I no longer support this business and will advise anyone else I know to do the same.",

    "text": "We went here with a group of people for my friend's birthday.  They misplaced her reservation so the wait was slightly long I think.  It's a happenin place and there was a bunch of people there, so it was loud and crowded.  We were able to get seated in the area where you have to take off your shoes so that was kind of fun.  I didn't really get the whole order off the wall thing, but it was fun.  I just kept wondering if there was more stuff that we were missing on the other side of the restaurant because we wanted to try everything!  We ended up getting probably 10 things, I'm not sure the exact number.  Here were the ones that totally sticked out in my mind:  Seared Salad - Nice and fresh with some carpaccio.  The flavors were excellent.     Kimchi fried rice - I'm actually not a huge fan of kimchi, so I'm not sure why I liked this rice so much.  But anyway, it had a good spicy flavor, and I like.  Went well with the pork belly.  Pork belly - YUM.  The meat was so delicious it just melts in your mouth.    Yellowtail Tar Tar - I would probably go back just for this.  I don't know how to explain it, but the flavor was awesome.  We got the honey toast upon recommendation from Yelp.  Huh?  It just tastes like toast with honey on it with ice cream on top?  I can make that at home and it would be so much cheaper.    There was a bunch of other stuff that we got that I already forgot.  I wish it was slightly cheaper... but I really think you pay for the experience.  Plus it seems like that use good quality and unique ingredients.  I'll be back, Izakaya is fun when with a bunch of people.",

We paid cash and added extra $4 to make it 20% gratuity. We went downstairs and this waitress named Mami yelled from upstairs saying that we owed her $1. It was very embarrassing for our whole group because of her action chasing after us with the bill in her hand. Everyone from the tea station was looking at us. My sister went upstairs and talked to her. The amount for the food was $169 and they automatically added 18% gratuity which was $208.38. We paid them in cash $212 with the extra $4. Someone internally from their restaurant took away that $4.  Well $1, $4.. Whatever it was that not our main concern... Is it proper to yell and chase after customer for 38 cents short from the gratuity so that whole mall can hear that??!!! There was no apology from her at all. No matter how awesome the food is... lousy customer service can turn customers away. That's really too bad... We used to visit this restaurant every time we visit Vegas. No more!!!",

    "text": "If I can take the chefs of Ichiza and open a new and bigger restaurant with trained servers, hostesses, etc... I would probably have one of the best Asian restaurants in all of Las Vegas.   The issue with Asian restaurants in general is the poor service. It can really put a damper in your dining experience. Instead of hiring experienced waitresses who can clearly understand what you're saying and be attentive throughout the meal, many Asian joints hire their nieces and/or other family members, or perhaps even random attractive Asian girls.   Let's just say, Ichiza... you have phenomenal Japanese food. Authentic and not overpriced, with an extensive variety offered all over the walls and on the menu. Your ramen is definitely better than Monta's (at least that's my opinion). I will always crave your curry udon, pork and onion skewers, fresh oysters, and pretty much everything else offered in that tiny space of a restaurant ;)   But please, please, please work on the service aspect!   On the several occasions I've been to this restaurant, my group and I waited about 15+ min to be approached after seating. We watch hungry and thirsty as the 2 or 3 waitresses on duty walk by, bus tables, stare at other tables, giggle in the back, or just plain stand around. We usually have to flag someone down to inform her that we're ready to order and once we do, we feel rushed and it is rather difficult to communicate half the time. The food takes a little longer than the average Asian restaurant, which is ok... but once it's out, don't expect to see your waitress again. Or.. you will see her walking around, but she won't acknowledge your existence. Good luck on refills!   Last night was a prime example. We had 4 of us in the group. We finally ordered our dishes, they came out after some time, then we had a 5th join us. Long story short, he did not have a chance to order anything at all, not even a glass of water.   Needless to say, this place has fabulous food, and it's adorable on the inside... very Japanese :). Workers are polite but lack any restaurant experience. I was torn between giving it 3 or 4 stars strictly due to service! I sure hope that aspect improves because then it would certainly be a 5 star experience all around!",

The carby-sweet dessert was the perfect end to dinner and it was a great combo of both warm (toast) and cold (ice cream) entities.  We made reservations for a group of 9 and was promptly seated. We ordered a bunch of small plates to share, some of which included: chasu sushi roll, uni pon, Agedashi tofu, gizzard, fried chicken, shishito peppers, gyoza, red snapper carpaccio, miso butterfish, and a bunch more.   For a snug place like this, our food came in a timely matter. Portions for each item was small, so definitely order a few items. Decor was busy to look at as there were random menu offerings posted throughout.  Parking can get tough since the private parking lot is shared by other restaurants in the plaza.   Now, on to the hunt for honey toast in the Bay area!",

Ichiza's pretty easy to find.  It's on the left side of Spring Mountain just before Arville if you're coming from the strip.  It's in the plaza with the big Korean BBQ sign on the second floor above Tea Station and next to the Crown Bakery store.  If I'm there for a meal I'll order something like the Ramen DS with Kakuni (pork belly) or I'll just order a pitcher of Kirin when I'm there to just hang out and eat some appetizers like the beef tongue and chicken gizzards.  I enjoy the unique spread of food on the menu as well as the wood interior and the paper menus posted on the wall.

I'm not going to go on and on about this place since there are a million reviews and they're basically going to rehash whatever I have to say, so I'll go ahead and say I adore the Yellowtail Tartare, the sake I had there was delicious, this is NOT the place to get sushi as their variety is limited, and their honey toast is waaaaay too sweet for me.  If you're not into super sweet desserts, consider going somewhere else.   (Crown Bakery a few doors down is open until Midnight and is super cute and friendly, with some fun things to nibble on after dining.)

(think of the deep fried head of the sweet shrimp sushi, but bite sized!) the real shrimp chip! - whole grilled squid: perfectly grilled. so flavorful! - broiled fish... sorry i totally forget the name, but its the broiled fish filled with roe. also very tasty - beef tataki: very very tasty! super fresh and flavorful. the beef was amazingly tender - yakitori of beef tongue: not the most tender ive had, but still pretty good - bacon wrapped potato (skewered): perfect hot fluffy potato, wrapped in crispy bacon... whats not to love?? - crab fried rice: yummy  this was probably the perfect amount of food for two girls.. hahaha jk, this was an enormous amount of food, but ate everything over the course of two hours in combination with four large sapporos. ... we spent almost $100 including a nice tip, so... not cheap, but we did eat and drink quite a bit.  pros: - FOOD! if you like japanese food, or are interested in trying something other than the typical sushi, try this place! definitely try to sit at the bar! you can ogle all the food that leaves the kitchen! - service: all the servers were super friendly and cute and attentive... but i think you need to be a bit assertive with the guy at the host stand (i think he was the owner?) so that you can get seated promptly. its not that he was unfriendly, just a bit scattered trying to handle so many different things at once. - decor: cute jap pub feel. homey, not fancy or stuffy, but like your neighborhood place that you go right after work... bathroom was not the cleanest, but the typical pub/bar restroom. - hours: im not used to restaurants being open after 2 (darn LA's liquor license!), so the closing time surprised me. i guess this is normal so they can accommodate people in the service industry in vegas  cons: - seating... its a bit odd. since is SMALL i would always call and ask to put your name down on the list. we got there at 830 and still had to wait even though we called ahead. when we left 1030 there was a huge wait! they have two large tables toward the back for larger groups, a number of smaller tables around the perimeter of the place, some bar seating for pairs, and then two large tables in the middle that are communal - parking lot: typical of most asian parking lots - theyre never big enough. dont forget to try driving around to the back - menu on the walls... while i am a big fan of the whole authentic look of a jap pub with \"new\" menu items on the wall... its an utter PAIN to have to crane your neck, and then squint (cursed with the typical asian trait of myopia) around the room to read items not listed on the menu... im horribly greedy.. i want to know ALL my options, not just the ones i can read. id highly suggest ichiza spend a few more dollars and write up a COMPLETE menu for guests!",

I've lived in Vegas for years, but only found this place in the last year or so, definitely my loss.  I tend to either start the night here before venturing out to the strip to party or end a good night out with friends with a good atmosphere and delicious food.  This place is a good fit for both those less familiar with Asian dining (a good dose of something new) and those more than used to Asian restaurants.  No matter who you are, get the beef tongue!  One last note is to keep you head up (there's tons more to order all over the walls) and talk to people!  It's an open and friendly environment, if you see your neighbor eating something that looks good, POLITELY lean over and ask what it is.",

New menu items are always added on the walls, which is pretty cool. Their Cod fish is simply one of my favs, very buttery and it just melts in ur mouth. Another must order would be their roasted ginkgo nuts! I would order at least 4 skewers for myself. Their carpaccio is bomb, as well as their grilled squid! They open late night and there's always a wait, however the staff are on it, so it's pretty quick. I also like their cozy atmosphere and it feels like ur in Japan when ur inside. In the end, their honey toast is hands down the best in vegas! Perfect!",

    "text": "If there was a place that deserved a solid 5 stars, then Ichiza would be it. After having such a good time the previous trip to Vegas, I know I had to make a return trip with my buddies. We actually ended up coming here two nights in a row, since the 2nd night, the dinner at Lotus of Siam was a disappointment.  Coming during dinner time on a Saturday night, our wait was fairly reasonable (~30mins or so), and we were immediately seated in one of those tatami style seats on the side. We got some green tea and were ready to order. There's a menu with about 60-70 items, but the thing to do here is to order off the special menu off the wall: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nPiTwWEFr-VsePew7Sjg?select=-0pHxOrb8K-ciAHRKR9PEg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nP...</a>  The 5 of us ordered quite a bit and really didn't bother looking at the prices since most of the items were good and cheap. Here are some of the highlights:  1) Yellowtail Tar Tar ($6) (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nPiTwWEFr-VsePew7Sjg?select=PVoyq1ZMFmuvc7NFWb-DQw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nP...</a>): OMG, this was so friggin' good. We ended up getting 3 orders the first night and another order the 2nd night here. Yes, it's THAT good.  2) Pork Belly w/Shiso ($2) and Grilled Garlic (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nPiTwWEFr-VsePew7Sjg?select=HK-Pc8suxlednNQlrz8XRQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nP...</a>): To me, pork belly is awesome, so is shiso. To mix the 2, it's a marriage made in heaven. The grilled garlic was like crack. Some may hate garlic, but if you're a fan, you'll be chomping them down. We also got the fried whole garlic, that was just OK.   3) Uni Mochi ($5) and Liver (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nPiTwWEFr-VsePew7Sjg?select=k4DyE-bftxX2eRVLbiP6AQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nP...</a>): Got the uni mochi last time and it's good again this time around. The liver is again one of my favorite organ meat and yakitori liver is damn good.  4) Red Snapper Carpaccio ($7) (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nPiTwWEFr-VsePew7Sjg?select=LZcQ1Ctmqs7BwAwT4p-X2g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nP...</a>): Wow, it's really good. Refreshing and delicious. Daikon on the bottom, with a piece of red snapper, topped with nagaimo (white stuff) and ikura (salmon roe) all under a piece of lemon in ponzu sauce.  5) Mochi wrapped in bacon, deep fried oyster, grilled squid, and seared tuna (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nPiTwWEFr-VsePew7Sjg?select=4sA9Ge3BmVXOHAIgH0a55g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nP...</a>) Not much description really needed I think. The dishes were all good in the picture. It was the first time I had mochi wrapped in bacon and I want it again!  6) Tuna, Hamachi, Salmon sashimi in an avocado bowl (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nPiTwWEFr-VsePew7Sjg?select=GYxPJSmWppKcfM6ATnrP-Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nP...</a>). I forgot the actual name of the dish, but it's good. The avocado and the sashimi pieces went very well together.  7) Sakuna or Sakura, I forgot what this was called (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nPiTwWEFr-VsePew7Sjg?select=nWDFryiYx5OrS87AFyvgMQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nP...</a>) 6 piece roll done very aesthetically while it's tasty as well. Probably the most expensive item we got all night ($12), but it's something good to try.   8) Of course, with any izakaya, you'd order some grilled rice balls as a filler to get you full. The ones here are done pretty well, but not much flavor other than the shoyu sauce. (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nPiTwWEFr-VsePew7Sjg?select=CwZ8pPU9sYuQM6gUF1L5Pg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nP...</a>)  There were other items we ordered that night, as well as many duplicate orders. At about $30/person, it's such a good deal. The pitchers of kirin are $15 and there are various bottled Japanese beers and sakes available. Seriously, it's a great place to eat, drink, and chill with your homies while not forking over an arm and a leg.  Do yourselves a favor and check this place out when you're in Vegas, but just don't go when I'm there since I don't want to you to take my table. Cheap food, fun atmosphere, and plenty of liquor, what's not to like about Ichiza??  This will probably be my last post on Yelp for awhile, so what's better than Ichiza with some pictures. Thanks to my bro Benny for that, since I'm usually too lazy to take pictures when the food is here.  *Note* Opens M-Sun 5pm - 3am, closes 2:30am on Sunday  *Note 2* Get the VIP card, 5% off on the next visit and other discounts after that.  *Note 3* If Lotus of Siam = Epic Fail, Ichiza = The Motherfuckin' Truth",

I honestly was grossed out but not completely.  I know good places are often dirty places.  I understand.  But when I pointed it out to the waitress, she just made a feeble attempt to kill my new little friend, after some manic missed squashings all over my table.  Shortly after Mr. Roach was laid to rest, we were offered free mochi ice cream.  Wow.  A fricking roach just joined me for dinner and you're offering me a 20 cent consolation dessert?  Fuck you.  To be fair, the food was mediocre.  2 stars for that and minus 5 stars for the roach and minus 1000 stars for their generous compensation and apology for the mackerel that worked its way back into my mouth as vomit.",

We stopped in and 11pm on a Friday night and it was packed!  There were few tables meant for small parties and there were two low lying tables, tatami style seating, meant for large parties .  Things we had:  - Hamachi sushi.  The pieces were large and oh so fresh.   - Chicken yakitori.  Oishii!  - Tum yum roll.  It was shrimp tempura with avocado and cilantro, wrapped in spring roll wrap, topped with sriracha sauce.  It was a little weird but but still tasty. - Unagi kakiage tempura roll.  If you love unagi, then you will love this roll!   - Honey toast.  It's five pieces of bread baked to perfection, with a scoop of ice cream in the middle, drizzled with honey.  As local Hawaiian islanders say, \"broke da mout!\"   The food sure gave us a food coma.  It's a great place to eat at when you're dying to get away from the strip!",

    "text": "As much as I love Ichiro of the Mariners, after my meal here my new Vegas chant is ICHIZA! ICHIZA! ICHIZA!   What an astounding value for the quality of food! Yes, the yakitori and deep fried menu here is not as extensive as that of izakayas in LA. Nor did I think the items were grilled as well and the proteins were not as good. But they more than make up for this by the seemingly endless pieces of paper advertising \"special\" menu items all over the restaurant. We got:   Red Snapper Carpaccio - excellent, refreshing start to the meal. Sauteed spinach with enoki mushroom and garlic butter - the sauce was not overly buttery, this was the favorite dish of one of the diners. Agedeshi tofu - the weakest dish of the bunch, there was no crispy skin to be found here. 4 orders of chicken wings (yakitori). 1 order of beef tongue (yakitori). 4 king oyster mushrooms wrapped in crsipy chicken skin. 1 order of deep fried quail egg. 1 special sushi cut roll (eel, spicy tuna, deep fried shrimp over caliroll). 1 beer. 1 brick of honey toast - yummy! and their only dessert.   And how much did that cost us? SIXTY FREAKIN DOLLARS!!! That's $10 more than what we paid PER PERSON for a mediocre brunch on the strip the next day. Beer is served up in a frosty mug for $3.75! Look around you and you will see hotel chefs grubbin down. A great sign. And a great meal.   Added bonus: we told the server it was my cousin's birthday AND bachelorette party, and a few minutes later the lights were dimmed and two cute servers bring us out the brick toast with a sparkler inside and they sang us happy birthday. Nice way to end a great meal that was easy on the wallet.",

    "text": "Took business clients here. Good thing I reserved one of a few tables in the place or we would have been sitting at the communal table in the middle. This place has a very limited sushi menu and no nigiri (had to order rice with sashimi). The four rolls on the menu were very good. They have quite a few items off the menu on the wall which is hard to read (we had to get up to read them). Ate the sashimi plates, all of the rolls and few orders of edamame. Very good, especially the spider roll and spicy tuna roll. We also tried the curry dishes and they were nicely done with a perfectly done curry sauce. Also tried the miso black cod and it was excellent. I had the iced green tea (which hit the spot on a hot day) and they charge for refills, which I could care less since I was thirsty and hey... its gotta be cheaper than beer????   This is not your typical Japanese American restaurant. Its more of a restaurant if you are a sashimi connoisseur and Japanese food purist.   We had a great time the four of us.... stuffing ourselves full of graet sashimi, rolls and other dishes for about $150.00.  Definately a go too place.  Was not crazy about the shopping strip mall location and the small parking lot.",

    "text": "OK. Bag of douche award for not trying this place out sooner and being put off by all the ridiculous busyness and blah blah blah. To me it always seemed like I was fabulously ravenous and the 100+ reviewers on here were all Inside At The Same Time. Bad combination that's constantly led me to Tea Planet or the other establishments on Spring Mountain.  It's actually the most I've eaten non-AYCE, and I think the fact that there's so much stuff that's notreallyonthemenubutyoujusthavetoknow kinda deal that makes it special. I had the constantly-smiling sushi chef whip up a HAMACHI (yup, it's in caps now uh huh) Crunch Roll with three sliced deep-fried quail eggs and the Spider roll legs coming out of the side...everyone on my side of the bar was cracking up as we tried to come up with a name for it.   That alone is the shit, their willingness to accomodate stupid-ass requests like that (it tasted wonderfully sukebe by the way, like when you mix different liquors and are pleasantly surprised at the aftertaste several weeks later) and still be cool about it, unlike more l337 joints where the uberfukken chef gives you rice ball after rice ball when you go omakase, coz you're obviously not good enough to devour the creations.  But I digress. This was was Virgin experience here (nuh uh, shut up! no way!) and I will come back many times over. Like next week, same time. Oh no wait, it was a spur-of-the-moment thing, but whatever. Just thinking about the ample portions and familiar late kick of the spicy tuna roll, plus the beef tips and tonkatsu-don are making me antsy again, and I just got home from there and can barely move as I metabolize.   I would say I had a great wonderful night on the town, but it's 3:27am and unlike youse, I gotta be a good kid and go to work in a few hours. Salud.",

    "text": "Are... you.... kidding?   Folks, this is why I started Yelping.  To bring truth to the masses - to expose restaurants for what they really are.  I'm in Las Vegas for Halloween and I wanted some good sushi.  So I searched on <a href=\"http://Yelp.com\">Yelp.com</a> for \"sushi\" in Las Vegas.  I filtered the results by \"Highest Rated\" and guess what showed up?   Ichiza.   Sighhhhhhh  This is proof that you can't always trust what 123 reviewers think about a place.    For those of you familiar with my reviews, you should know how big of a sushi snob I am.  You should also know how much I appreciate stumbling across \"hole in the wall\" sushi joints.  I love finding a diamond in the rough.  Ichiza, however, is not one.   Not even close.  For starters, let's talk about the menu.  Why do they have a menu?  I looked over this menu and there were THREE sushi rolls.  ONLY THREE?  How can you only have three sushi rolls???  One of them was a California Roll, which doesn't count.  The other was a tempura roll, which also is not real sushi.   The third was the Spider Roll, fried soft shell crab in a roll.   I asked the waitress if they had another menu for sushi - surely, this can't be it.  She explained, the rest of the menu is on the walls.  What?  You mean all those random pieces of paper taped to the walls of the restaurant?  That's the full menu?  So... do you want me to get up and walk around the entire restaurant and try to find and memorize what i want to eat?  This is EFFING RIDICULOUS!  So after I browsed the \"menu wall\", I found two other rolls.  One was called the Natto Roll, which was soybean and okra in a roll that's deep fried and topped with tuna.   The other was called the Eel-Kara-age Roll, which has baked eel and fried chicken in a roll.   God help me, this was the worst crap I've eaten in so long.  The Natto Roll was FUNKY.  I love okra and I love soybeans, but mix the two together and add spongy rice and deep-fry it and suddenly it's disgusting.   The Eel-Kara-age didn't taste as bad, but was poorly created.  It's just rice stacked with a piece of fried chicken and a piece of eel on top.  That's it.  Sigh.   The Spider Roll, the only roll that I recognized from other sushi places, was not made like any Spider Roll I've ever had.  Yeah, they deep-fried the soft shell crab, but what's up with rolling it up with lettuce, carrots and cucumber?  LETTUCE, CARROTS and CUCUMBER???  In a sushi roll???? WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING?  IS THIS A SICK AND TWISTED HALLOWEEN PRANK??  My friends were wiser than I was and decided to order the ramen instead.  They thought it was awful.  Noodles were not cooked enough and were hard. The broth was not good, either.  I've posted a picture of them - check it out.  Ok, enough about the baffling menu and utterly worthless food.  Lets talk service.  The waitress was quick enough coming over to take our order, but it took awhile because I had to run around the restaurant and tell her what I wanted.  Once she gave me my food though, she was hard to find.  I had to track another waitress down twice to get refills on my Diet Coke.  Btw, they don't have soft drinks on tap - only by the can and they charge you $5 per can.  Be warned.    If you're staying on the Strip, like most people are, then this place is a little hard to get to unless you take a cab.  I would definitely not recommend walking to it.  It's also in a pretty ghetto part of town - be careful walking back at night.  Just take a cab both ways.     The only REAL positive about this place?  I'm not sure how the waitresses dress during every other day of the year, but on Halloween they went all out.   There was a slutty bee, a slutty nurse, a slutty angel, and a slutty cabaret girl.  They were HOT.  If you're into hot asian chicks (I married one. Hot asian chicks ftw), then you'll find them working here.  Is it worth eating here though?  Sadly...... no.  Maybe you can come in right before closing and ask them if they wanna have a drink somewhere else.. far away.",

    "text": "OK guys! This is a solid Yelp-recommended kappo place. I really loved the overall experience, up until the very end, when suddenly I got one unexpected & unfortunate issue with it. When we finished dinner (we had ordered a huge load of food and paid about $57 per person, for 2 people, incl. a good 18% tip) we exited the restaurant and the predominantly Japanese staff didn't say a simple thank you. The Japanese host (manager?) saw us leaving, turned a blind eye and continued chatting with the waitress as if we didn't exist.  I regret giving you a lower rating (I initially intended a 5) but I am an emotional and spoiled client- I got upset... I'm half Japanese... I know it is not written on my (Caucasian) face, but I am. My appearance is not an excuse for anyone to forget to say a simple \"thank you\" especially when it's part of the Japanese cultural code. As we all know. Even a Korean-owned Japanese restaurant in LA area is trying to always say \"Arigato Gozaimasu\" (with a heavy accent, but still, polite and respectful). I never had an experience where Japanese nationals operating a restaurant- in the US or in Japan- disregarded this centuries-old cultural rule.  OK... the tantrum is over now, guys- sorry. Yelp is all about being subjective and emotional about our experiences- and it is exactly what I am doing. I wish that I had the desire to write more about the food rather than freaking out regarding a cultural issue...  In spite of the \"shitsurei\"- hopefully an isolated incident without any mean attitude or intentions behind it- I DO RECOMMEND this restaurant as one of the good Nihon-ryori restaurants in Las Vegas. Also, conveniently, it is open quite late. Maybe other Yelpers who are less spoiled or less familiar with Japanese customs (not expecting as much from their experience) will really have a blast.",

    "text": "Taking the Advice of some native LV Yelpers, We decided to trek out to Spring Mountain for some more authentic Asian eats. This was the Japanese selection.  We came on a weekday evening and got two seats at the bar. They have Japanese style larger communal tables near the back for larger parties, complete with crocs to slip into if you need to use the washroom. They provide you with a laminated menu, but there are other selections all over the walls with \"specials.\" We stuck mostly to what was on the menu with a couple wall-exhibited selections.  Standouts were EXCELLENT Agedashi tofu, Delicious Vegetable Udon complete with Raw egg, good quality fish for the sushi. My partner ordered a whole grilled mackerel which he said was his favorite izakaya treat from Japan, whilst removing the entire skeleton in one pull.   I had read the reviews earlier, and knew to order the honey toast. It was definitely interesting and MUCH larger than I had expected. I loved the warmth and the ice cream and the honey with the bread.. but it was a bit too much bread in the end. Worth the $6.95 yes, \"Better than sex\" -- not quite.  We are from Toronto, which has decent Japanese food - but not the most authentic. My SO lived in Japan for several years, and is very particular about his Japanese cuisine. Ichiza was a pleasant surprise and we adored the experience. Decent, authentic izakaya with good service and good eats. One of our best dining experiences in Las Vegas.   4.5 Stars.",

    "text": "Heard about Ichiza from my roommate on her last trip to Vegas, and decided to check it out with the family on our annual Vegas trip. I have to give this place extra props because my parents actually liked it.   What was I doing bringing my totally unhip Vietnamese parents to a pretty hipster izakaya in Vegas? Well, they don't like sushi, and wanted to taste other Japanese food. And because I'm such an accomodating daughter, I figured this would be a good opportunity. But it didn't occur to me that the place had pretty much all bar food and young patrons. So when we stepped in, I felt so uncool at first, but with my mom being so cute and my dad being so genteel to the waitresses, I was reminded that they have been in this country long enough to know how to deal with non-viet-traditional people.   My mom ordered a TOFU STEAK (I guess that sounded appetizing to her), and out came a huge square of lightly marinated tofu on a bed of boiled bean sprouts. My parents pretty much devoured that whole dish, bean sprouts and all. Dad ordered the ika-yaki (grilled squid) and loved how it was seasoned. I was happy he ordered it because I got to eat it, too. I got the soft shell crab and sis got the soba noodles. We had a few more dishes (chicken gizzard, more tofu, etc.) and all them were pretty tasty.   All the food came out fresh and light. We all felt full enough with our 10 or so dishes and no one had indigestion or that gross feeling of super grease afterward.   My parents, being so polite, thanked the manager and the waitresses in their accented English and said that they hope to see them again. And for a moment I felt that my parents were pretty hip...",

    "text": "I was in Vegas about two weeks ago celebrating my birthday with a group of 10.  I was determined to find some local hangouts off the strip and Ichiza fit the bill.    On the strip in Vegas you have one of two options: a fantastic world-class meal with an similar world-class bill ($100+/per person) or the dumbbed down fare at most casino cafes/buffets, ok when it's 3 AM and you just need something  to soak up all the alcohol you've been drinking, but unacceptable at any other time.  Since I knew there were places to be found in Vegas where I could both eat great food and not break the bank, I figured I'd see what fellow yelpers where saying about nearby Japanese restaurants.  My only criteria: 4 star+ and had to be away from all the flashing lights of the strip.  Ichiza did not disappoint.  We had a great time ordering off the menus on the walls and sampled a ton of stuff; deep fried oysters, sashimi, sushi rolls, skewers, even ramen!  Everything was fantastic and the servers were attentive and friendly.  At the end of the evening imagine our surprise when the total bill came to only $22/person, including tax and gratuity!  We had even had several large Saporo's and a round of sake!    A great place in Vegas when you want some real, authentic food in a non-strip setting.  HIGHLY recommended.",

I chuckled at Thu's analogy of Ichiza: Clippers, however it's good for Vegas.  It can be inconsistent...especially when it's very busy.  Yellowtail tar tar: So tasty. Pita chip topped with rice, lettuce, salsa, another pita chip, and yellowtail tar tar.  Sounds weird but it's yummy.  Chicken wing skewers: simple but tasty. Sashimi: they don't offer a big sushi/sashimi selection but the little they carry is pretty good.  Go to Sen of Japan for a more fulfilling sushi experience.  Mochi wrapped bacon: skewer with mochi (rice cake) wrapped with bacon & grilled.  Delicious!!! Ramen: my kids love this. Uni: half a lemon, topped with thinly sliced cucumber, topped with uni, drizzled with ponzu sauce.  I usually call first to see how busy they are.  Sometimes it's a 1-2 hour wait so it's not worth the drive.  Check it out!  Lunch is not the best here though.  They have a pretty limited menu and they don't offer the items we like.",

There's about 100+ items written on the walls, and above the kitchen... it makes it hard to make up my mind! But, the service has always been efficient and friendly, and when my good friend Amber & I ordered the okra w/ natto, the waitress tried to deter us, in fear that we may not like the odor the natto gave. We assured her it was what we wanted and she went on to order it for us. That night, we had the Spider roll, which was average, a half order of Ramen (i'm not sure which one, but this half order was actually not as small as expected), Tuna Tataki , Salmon Skin Salad ( i was hoping for there to be more salmon skin  :[ ) and the okra w/ natto (which honestly, is not bad, i actually like it, others may beg to differ). Every time I've gone I have never had anything to complain about. Definitely a happening place after hours. I have yet to try out the tatami mat sitting! Love to go here with friends when I've got money to blow :)",

Both were really good and came out to us fairly quick. We also tried the grilled squid which was really good and something off one of the many many items scattered around the restaurant. It was a fried oyster wrapped in chicken skin which tasted ok. Im tempted to keep coming back here to try out everything they have and check off each of the menu items one by one.",

The first time, I was quite excited to go there as I have read all the reviews and I was certain I would enjoy the food.  When we got there, we were actually seated very quickly and our server brought our tea over very quickly.  After that, she seemed to ignore our table for 15 minutes until another server sent her over.  This really left a bad taste in my mouth and I ended up not ordering as much as I had planned to.  When the food came, everything was good.  The skewers were yummy and the honey toast is as everyone has reviewed.  A must-have!  On this experience alone, I would have only given Ichiza a 3 star.  On my second trip just last week, we had to wait a bit longer for the table but was seated at the sushi bar.  Our server was very prompt, courteous, and made great recommendations.  My co-worker and I were pretty beat up after walking around the convention center for CES.  This meal really hit the spot.  Every item that we ordered was superb.  I would definitely recommend that people order from the \"wall\" instead of the standard menu.  The tapa-style food is definitely what sets this place apart from others. I now understand why people give this place 5 stars.  I would give it 5 star alone for the food but I will knock off one start for the mediocre service.",

The selection of dishes is great here and an awesome place to hang out for dinner, late-night snacks/drinks, etc etc. Definitely one of the best hits in Vegas, imo.   Here's what I recommended:   - Red Snapper Carpaccio: Amazingly fresh, great sauce and pretty presentation.   - Yellowtail Tar Tar: Very creative and kind of look like a sandwich with yellowtail/avocado on top, crisps on two sides and sticky rice in middle. Interesting combination but turned out very tasty and filling at the same time.   - Octopus Wasabi: my all-time favorite and the portion here is generous and price is wayyyyy reasonable!   - Uni Toasted Mochi: never ever had this before and it was surprisingly tasty. Another creative combination that is to keep; fresh soft sea urchin on top and sticky toasted mochi on bottom that brings out extra texture and taste. yummmm  - Smelt, smelt, smelt: tried both deep fried and grilled....definitely stick with the grilled ones...omg, can never have enough of those. Too bad some the Japanese restaurants I go to in NY stopped carrying smelts, a really sad case.   - Beef Tongue Skewer: tender, juicy, and squeeze a bit lemon juice on it, sooo sooo good.   -Beef Tataki: raw beef with seared sides...one of my husband's favorites.  -Stir fried chicken gizzard: very flavorful and another great dish to have while sipping sake ;)  Overall, food was great, service was very friendly and most importantly, this place opens past midnight! A great place to chill off the strip.",

Its a tapa style place so its impossible to get full from just one dish but on the bright side, you get to try different varieties of food.    Everything we've ordered was very satisfying.  I'll tell you my favorites: Tofu Salad, Kimchi Fried Rice, their sashimis and ramen noodles, Sesame Chicken....well to cut it short every damn thing was good.  Oh except the octopus sashimi, what the hell was I thinking but I like to try things I've never tried before.  People, don't ever make the mistake of ordering honey toast dessert at Tea Station which is just downstairs but force your lazy ass to get up those stairs and come here for Ichiza's honey toast because its way, way better.  It gets full at times so long waits might be required for bigger parties.  The wait is usually short with me and just another person.  And for you guys with yellow fever, there's this waitress that always wears this purple nike airmax...hella cute.",

Things I love to eat here include, but are not limited to: Tsukune, Ika yaki (seriously, one of the best things ever), Squid and Sea Urchin Roll, Eel Kakikage Roll, Bacon Wrapped Mochi, Roasted Garlic, Honey Toast, and their Green Tea (which is so deeply green that it almost glows).  If you're planning on going on a weekend night between dinner and 10, a reservation will save you a long wait at the door.  Ichiza is tiny, and the waits can be really long, especially if you have a party larger than 2.  The seats at the bar turnover fastest, so parties of 2 get seated fastest.  The parking lot is also amazingly tiny and shared with several other restaurants, so you may have to be willing to walk over from the much larger lot in front of the Chinatown mall.  The only thing that could make Ichiza better would be bringing back lunch, but I completely understand why they cut that out.  Also, be aware of how much you're ordering.  Like tapas, you can end up with a much larger bill than you expect because you ordered a lot of small plates.  Totally tummy-satisfying and still-reasonable, though.  I can't wait to see what they dress up in this Halloween!  The only place that might be more fun that night is Anime Ramen, but I doubt it.",

But wow I was surprised! Its a cute little place. Service wasn't outstanding, but I never expect a lot from a small place like this on a busy friday night. I had the tom yum ramen which was absolutely amazing! Just the perfect amount of heat with lots of flavor. Definitely recommend! And DO NOT leave without finishing your meal with the honey toast!! Absolutely delicious. Will definitely be back.. I'm already craving my meal again and only ate here four hours ago. lol",

Perfect late night eats for Japanese bar food, have an impressive variety of assorted tapas and typical Japanese food (sushi rolls, sashimi, donburi bowls).

Good service from the waitresses, came in about 2:30am and was greeted with fresh enthusiasm and seated quickly.  Food hits the spot, which isn't too difficult, but it gave my tastebuds a happy dance.  Will come back to try some more of the extensive specials.",

I think when you have the real Japanese server, they are different than any other Asian country, they are always so sweet and attentive.  I love they have so many special posted everywhere on the wall, but it does take a while to try to see what they actually really have, maybe my eye sight isn't as good, and also I don't read Japanese. Still worthy to try to look up the special. Last night I try the grill whole squid, delicious. Steam egg custard in tea cup was always my favorite Japanese treat, they did steam well, but it was a bit watery. Salmon sashimi was steal, $7 dollar for 5 fresh pieces. Grilled skewer is recommend as well.  Overall I would suggested to give a try, they open late night so if you want to avoid the wait and hungry in the middle of the night, great choice!",

You can also venture away from the menu and try their specials posted on paper signs all over the restaurant giving it a touch of originality. Usually I only try the items with a picture on them I don't want to end up with something Like fried eyes on a stick. But until now everything I tried here was very good and the prices and service are just as great! Which could be one of the reasons this place is always packed. Don't be intimidated by the odd items on the menu. You can always stick to the basics like fried rice, California rolls, shrimp tempura, chicken teriyaki or...grilled tongue. And don't forget a nice cold Sapporo or a nice warm cup of sake to compliment whatever you decided to order.

Wagyu beef carpaccio was so bland, their sushi rice is just plain white rice,  and their grilled squid is extremely tough.    The sashimi cuts were thin and cut the wrong way. The yellowtail tasted old and tough. I also tried 2 hand rolls which had too much white rice and nothing special.   Overall nothing was great or even good.

Having been to Japan (my son in the Navy was stationed there), I have to say the atmosphere, menu and ambiance, resembles a neighborhood Japanese eatery.  Let's call this place for what it is. It's a Hipster's hangout that serves Japanese Tapas.  If you get really super hungry, bring your wallet.  Sushi, is just so-so, but cooked entrees are good.  Service is very \"scattered\", however, it's a lot more traditional and authentic then the typical Japanese place in Las Vegas, and certainly a better value than the places located on The Strip.  Parking does suck, so I suggest not bothering and just parking in the lot of the center next door.  If you don't want to wait, go the Korean Gardens BBQ, next door.",

However, there was barely any pieces of tuna ( 3 tic tac size pieces at most) Presentation look ok but closely looking at it, the avocado mix look like someone vomit up some nasty green gloop.  Ramen with the pork belly = nothing special that's worth $8 but it will fill you up so you don't have to order too much  Chicken yakatori = a dried piece of chicken drowned in cheap store-bought teriyaki sauce. I took a bite and didn't want it anymore  Honey toast =$8 probably the savor of the entire meal. crispy edges, enough honey to go with bread and vanilla ice cream compliments the bite. Towards the center, there is condensed milk that adds extra sweetness to it. Very filling-- 1 order can feed 4 people at most.  $40 meal for 2 people = not worth the price to eat while in vegas.

Mini corn dogs have a curry batter that is very light.  There is a juicy crunch to them. I dipped it in spicy mayo. The yellowtail sashimi mixed with avocado was served over rice/tomato/onion sandwiched between what looked similar to fried wonton. This was nice and fresh tasting the crispy part was flaky and not hard. Nicely put together.  I REALLY wanted the honey toast.  I only had a little more room left in my and my boyfriend didn't want any. I didn't think it would be worth spending almost $8 for dessert that I could not finish alone.

After giving up on Bacchanal (3 HOUR WAIT!!!!), we ventured to Ichiza.   Put my name down for a party of 6 and was told that it would be over an hour. Decide to just tough it out...10 minutes later, my friend goes in to check on our position and is told that the wait is now 30 minutes. ??? After waiting for about 40 minutes, the owner comes out and asks us if we can finish dining within an hour. We oblige, mainly just to grab a seat.  Once seated, we promptly order everything we can think of, in hopes of finishing within the agreed upon time.   Wasabi octopus.....\"Sorry, we are run all out.\" Okra natto....\"Are you sure you want? It has natto in it.\" (Me: \"Yes, I understand this\") Ankimo....\"I am sorry. No more.\" Uni in ponzu sauce....\"I'm sorry, we are all out tonight.\"  After scrapping together an order, we wait once again. 15 minutes pass before the first dishes come out. Some were decent, most were par for the course. Nearing our one hour limit, we are waiting for our bowls of ramen. We inquire and are told, \"we are out of miso broth, only shoyu ramen left. Do you still want?\"  Me: \"Yes.\" Would have been nice to be asked this a little earlier.  Another 10 minutes....and they bring 1 out of 3 ramens ordered.   We finish.  Promptly given the bill by the owner.  Average yakitori. Below average service.",

Now, if you replace the bread with pound cake that's another thing. I heard that this place has been on Dirty Dining for being filthy and is a repeat offender. Makes me wonder how they handled my food when I ate there. Anyway, being a repeat offender is enough for me to not return and I'll take away one star for that.",

    "text": "This place is a treat.  My brother and I started off with garlic chicken gizzards, beef tatake carpaccio, and beef tongue skewers. I won't go into details of taste and texture, I will simply say, delicious and cooked beautifully. See for your self how the soft prosciutto-like textured, light, yet complex tasting, beef carpaccio does for you.   We followed with yellow tail tar-tar, hokke (recommended very much), and 2 raw oysters (hands down, best oyster in las Vegas). And I won't go into textures or tastes. You'll have to see for yourself what the melt-in-your mouth, clean yet briny, lightly drizzled with caviar and garlic (and a few other mouth watering tastes), colorful & gorgeously presented oysters will do for you.  We finished with an Atlantic Bass sashimi. To give you an idea of how beautifully executed this dish was, by the head chef (Takashi), imagine this (for sashimi lovers only....); a beautiful 14 inch Bass with the head and tail) , perfectly filleted , and presented, meatless on a plate, while its sashimi is displayed atop his body on mint leves and greens, served with a light sauce to compliment the delicate, buttery texture, and light, sweet natural taste. The chef knows what parts of the fish are most tender, and serves them to you on a separate plate, so that you may differentiate and partake in consciously knowing what parts of the fish you are consuming. Smply beautiful.   After finishing, they asked us if we wanted the meatless fish fried (head, tail, a few other meaty parts/ fin connections etc.) . Of course! They served the fish, tatesfully breaded In a buttery, salty batter, and deep fried. Simply perfect.  Take your time and enjoy each piece, you will be satisfied.",

The prices are reasonable and they serve all kinds of faire that is not typical in Japanese restaurants. They serve from bento boxes, to sushi, to udon, to skewers. You have to try the butter corn over chips, takoyaki, stir fried chicken with scallions, chicken meatball skewers, four kinds of stewed mushrooms, and the okra skewers.   Everything in here looked so yummy and we were always interested in seeing what some of the patrons around us were ordering. Unfortunately, our tummies can only hold so much food, so you better believe that I'll be back to visit next time I come to Las Vegas. A diamond in the rough fo sheezy.",

    "text": "If you're a frequent visitor of Vegas, you can't help but venture out from the overpriced restaurants and tourist traps on the Strip. This place was bookmarked for a while, and we finally got the chance to check it out for dinner on a recent trip. Based on what we ordered, our initial experience was okay.   We were greeted warmly and sat at the bar area, where we just plucked different items from the menu. I was amazed at all the rectangular pieces of papers plastered all over, with the dish names scribbled on it. We tried a wide range of things. I don't remember the official names of the dishes, but we tried the clams, butterfish, udon, agedashi tofu, a couple chicken yakitori skewers, just to name a few.  Nothing really stood out in my mind. Things were okay, as we kept on eating. The butterfish was a somewhat small portion for the price, but very flavorful. The bowl of clams had good flavor, and were nice and tender. The huge disappointment had to be the pan fried noodles with seafood. I was craving crispy noodles, and I expected a small dish. It turned out to be a huge bowl with sauced with too much thick starch. The pork meat and seafood inside was overcooked and rubbery. No good.  We were also disappointed that all the dishes with uni were sold out. Ichiza was a good change-of-pace from the rest of Vegas places to eat, but just based on one visit, it's a bit tough to judge. One thing's for sure, it doesn't seem like they excel in one thing extremely well. They do so many types of dishes, that perhaps the quality suffers. At any rate, we'll have to visit again to try other things on the menu.",

This small and authentic Japanese hole-in-the-wall is a favorite among Vegas locals and for good reason...everything is delicious and dirt, dirt cheap.    My table ordered: Ramen DX - The miso based broth was a bit bland and watery but the tender braised pork cheek topping was to quote Penny from Happy Endings \"A-mah-zing!\" Crab Fried Rice - For a little less than $8 you get a HUGE serving of fried rice with tons of fresh jumbo lump crab meat!  No imitation crab meat here..no siree Bob!  An order of this in the DMV area would cost at least $14. Blue Fin Tuna Poki - I prefer my poki with ahi tuna but that is just personal preference.  The fish was very fresh and seasoned perfectly with a blend of soy sauce, sesame oil, and sesame seeds. Beef Tongue Skewer - I will eat almost anything but not tongue (tongue bumps are one of the greatest fears in my life).  However this got rave reviews from my table mates for its tenderness and mild flavor. Miso Marinated Black Cod - Buttery, flaky and light -- I can't complain (although I will say I prefer Kushi's version a bit  better because it has a stronger flavor).   Beef Tataki - Surprisingly my tongue eating friends would not touch this dish because the beef was served rare.  I on the other hand ate the entire dish with gutso.   Honey Toast - This is basically a big stack  of toasted sandwich bread, slathered in honey and ice cream.  Totally worth the wait.    Total damage?  $59  I don't even think David Blaine could conjure up something as magical as this himself.",

I've been here a few times and although most of their dishes are small and tapa-like, they are all reasonably priced. If you're really hungry, I can see how the bill could add up quickly. For this visit, I got the red snapper carpaccio, tender beef tongue, and fried quail eggs. The carpaccio was beautifully presented with a bed of sauce with perfect cuts of snapper on top of a thinly sliced lemon topped with onion, salmon roe, micro greens, and a dab of hot sauce on top. It was delicious and although it was topped with a generous amount of onion, it was refreshing because I think they may marinate the thinly sliced onions in lemon for a while. The tender beef tongue is one of my favorites when I come here. The name says it all. I had the fried quail eggs as well and it comes with three on two skewers. They were so cute and so damn good. I would definitely recommend trying all these dishes. This place is awesome and what keeps it unique is that they have sheet of specials that they come up with daily(of course there are a few that end up repeated) but they also have special dishes all over the walls such as the red snapper carpaccio, so don't miss out on that either!",

Everything else I had at this place was mediocre.  I look for quality when I eat Japanese tapas, and none of these dishes were up to par for my taste.  Maybe the butterfish was the only dish I liked.  So if you're here, please order it, it's really good; melt in your mouth status!  But, the food definitely filled me up, and gave me the Japanese fix I needed so it didn't disappoint completely.  But for the prices you have to pay, it isn't worth it.  Prices should be re-evaluated for quality.  The menu needs to be rewritten with everything on the wall. It gets real frustrating to figure out what you want to order next because you feel you might be missing out on something great but it might be written somewhere you can't see.  I'm not sure this is good for business so I highly suggest the menu revisited and updated.",

I remember telling my husband he can cook those better at home. We also tried the honey toast which was also just okay. I thought it was all hype no substance. We were hoping to catch ankimo or a decent sashimi on their specials, unfortunately they ran out. I wouldn't scratch Ichiza just yet on my list. Meanwhile I'm hoping Yelp can point me to another izakaya in town that serves more flavorful food.",

Smallish, cramped space, and packed! So we knew it must be good. They fit us in with no res (on a Thursday), and the service was decent, not rude, but rushed & they got one thing wrong, but not major. The menu is augmented with \"specials\" on paper all over the walls. Helps if you speak Japanese I think (another good sign). So we just kept ordering more after looking around, and everything was GOOD.  This is not your typical \"American\" sushi joint with Calif roll/ spicy tuna roll. This is real Japanese food, some twists like Jalapeno friend rice, which we heard was good from the guy next to us. So if you want GOOD, fresh, real food, this is the place. Maybe make a res! And there's a bakery next door that has yummy dessert. Go across the street for a fab foot massage to end the evening.",

I had oysters on the half shell with ponzu sauce that was congealed and would have preferred them to slice the oysters like they do at Raku (huge oysters).  I  had the grilled squid and it was chewy and pretty flavorless.  I also had the egg custard cup which is egg, spinach, shrimp and mushroom and it was O.K. but a little watery and not very interesting. I did like the tuna with mountain yam, it was very flavorful.  I also liked the sake selection and had yummy pudding for dessert which was a flan. I'm sure people have favorite dishes here such as the fried rice which seemed to be going to most tables but I can't say I would eat here again when there are so many other, better spots. I did love Crown Bakery right next door for a green tea latte and amazing pistachio cookies.  They have samples out for many of the cookies and the pastires all looked delcious and they are made on site.  I would definitely recommend checking out this nice little bakery if you are in the area.  I prefer Monta for ramen (only serve Asahi beer) and Raku for a nicer atmosphere although they are a lot more expensive and have very small wine pours which is annoying so order by the bottle.",

    "text": "So everytime my GF and I go to Vegas we like to start with a AYCE Sushi lunch. Being an avid fan of Yelp and trusting the great advice i have received here in the past, we decided to go to this joint. We arrived in Vegas around 11:30 and it was right when the place opened.  The place is located in a new strip mall about 10-15 minutes from the strip. The decor is nice, i can see it being a high end lounge/dinner type place at night. We were quickly seated as we were the first and only ones there. They promptly told us about the all you can eat and got us our drinks  We placed our orders, had the same ol we have everywhere else and I even was shcoked to see that they had Aji on the all you eat menu. First off, Aji in most places that I goto taste fishy, and that's places where I am paying $15-$20 for an order of Aji sashimi. So I am pretty skeptical when it came to a place that was offering it for AYCE. But surprisingly, and I do mean surprisingly, it was fresh! That itself garaunteed this place 3 stars no matter what. The rest of the sushi we ordered was great, it tasted fresh, the service was excellent, no real complaints what so ever for this place.  The waitress was even nice enough to let us know that they had hamachi kama as the special for the day at that even though it wasnt on the menu it was eligible for AYCE. Not many places tell you about additional stuff when it comes to AYCE.  I was mighty impressed by this.  I think that this place is very fairly priced, service is very good, decor and ambiance is also nice and relaxing. As time went by, more and more people came by to eat here, a lot of folks were also getting food to go. My GF and i are into trying new things, but the next time we go back to LV, we might just have to stop by here again.",

We waited for about 20 minutes and sat at the bar.  The sushi chefs do not engage the patrons unlike most bars and the waitresses' attitudes are just a tad above neutral.  The food however makes up for all of this.  It was insanely good for the price.  If you like authentic Japanese over fusion you won't be disappointed.  The sake was great, the sashimi fresh, and the specials unique.  I never paid more than $10 for a dish and I tried some of their most expensive specials.  When I gave the hostess my name, Brad, she wrote it down in Japanese on the list.  Did I mention this place was authentic?  For the love of god/science ... get the honey toast, words cannot describe this deceptively extravagant treat.  Worth the trip alone.",

My mom is a tough one to please, and she gave me the task of finding restaurants for all the different groups of guests flying in for the wedding from Asia, Europe, and all over the U.S. She wanted it to be affordable, unique, and delicious. We tried Ichiza the second night we were in town, and we were hooked. We went back the next night, and then hosted two more dinners there with large groups of 10 and 12. Later, my mom went back to buy take-out for my family. So for FIVE meals, Ichiza was amazing.   Favorites included the tofu and tuna sashimi salad, soft shell crab roll, seafood quesadilla, jalapeno fried rice, natto with okra, uni in ponzu, yellowtail tar tar, miso cod, and the beef tongue and liver skewers. But dang, it was hard to find all this good stuff on the hand-written menus everywhere. You've got to get over it and just stare over the heads of other diners to read them. No fear!  Even though there was a 30 minute wait the first night, they were great about reservations for large groups. Food came out F-A-S-T, the waitresses were sweet, and now I think my mom wants to live there.  I've been to izakayas in Tokyo, New York, and L.A., and I heart Ichiza.",

The decor, atmosphere, seating arrangements, and Japanese writing all over the walls really makes this place feel like a traditional izakaya.  If you can read Japanese, or have friends who can, or know your foods, you'll certainly get more out of a visit here than if you didn't.  They have a standard menu, which certainly has a few gems (lots of people order the ramen dx, and the grilled squid is pure nomnomnom), but then they also have their not-so-secret menu plastered all over the walls.  I like to get their kimchi and pork okonomiyaki (they have another name for it that I always forget).  One will fill me up, and I usually ask people to grab a bite or two.  Couple it with a pitcher of Sapporo (or two), and honey toast for dessert, and thats about as good as it gets!",

It's definitely a refreshing break from the Vegas strip.  Especially when you live on the strip as I do.  The decor is nothing special.  The atmosphere is casual.  And, the service here is decent.  Language is definitely a barrier.  Both from the service as well as the menu.  The walls are decorated with tons japanese characters that will make you think you are starring in an Anime movie.  As for the food?  It's was great for the price.  We had the pork dumplings, pork meatballs, and beef tataki to share.  I order the udon soup for myself.  The dumplings and meatballs were good.  The beef tataki and udon soup were delicious.  I didn't feel guilty about the meal after and still felt light.  I'm anxious to go back and try out their other items.",

    "text": "KF = Kid Friendly (at a decent hour)  I've been here with / without kids over a dozen times. I am never hungry or disappointed at the end of our meal. Sometimes we have to wait, but again, with kids it's not worth waiting unless there is something to look forward to. My kids are adventurous, so slimy and raw is perfectly acceptable. However, there are a lot of KF basics such as tempura, calamari, beef and chicken and if that is not acceptable, you can just head up Spring Mountain and hit McDonald's.  Our personal faves: - beef tataki (I get 2 orders because I don't like to share this ;) - calamari - nice and crispy, but if they get rid of the garnishing they can add a few more rings - pork belly bowl - my 6 year-old won't share this - beef tongue - yep I said beef tongue. So tender and tasty that tongue is. - bacon wrapped mochi - who knew? - mackerel sashimi - red snapper carpaccio - sakana pinchos - inside out roll - yellowtail tartar - honey toast - if you have room, but we usually get Boba downstairs at Tea Station ;) And as always parents, don't forget to drink a lot of sake!",

The restaurant's a small place, but food was yummy, service friendly.  I hope to go back to eat there every time I head out to Vegas.   Their Honey Brick Toast totally got me!! - Super \"Delish\"-!!  My bf ate only 1/4 of it, while I ate the other 3/4..soooo good!  ^_^    The only downside I saw to the place was that not everything that they serve is on the menu in front of you - they've got a lot more stuff on the walls written on white pieces of paper, so make sure you bring your glasses if you can't see that well so that you can order off their walls as well!",

    "text": "Okay, I'll admit it: I consider myself somewhat of a \"foodie\". There are very few things I love more than a good meal and I'm definitely what some people would refer to as an \"adventurous eater\". While I've eaten at my fair share of places in Las Vegas, none had been able to satisfy my inner Anthony Bourdain. That is, until a good friend of mine introduced me to Ichiza during one of our weekly dinner excursions.  Having spent a considerable amount of time in Japan, I'm pretty familiar with izakaya-style dining so I had an idea of what to anticipate. What I didn't expect was the level of authenticity the restaurant delivered, not only in ambiance but also the food. We were given a regular menu but any good izakaya-vet knows the magic really happens on the wall. It was refreshing to see items on the menu that are unlike any other Japanese restaurant I've been to in Vegas; Miso black cod, beef tongue, octopus in wasabi? Definitely a dream come True for someone so into unusual and uncommon foods. Try the eel karaage tempura roll and the honey toast,  two of the best things I have consumed. Ever.   I've been back several times now and have taken numerous friends to Ichiza and have never been disappointed. The service has always been wonderful and the waitstaff very friendly and helpful. Once in awhile there's a bit of a wait to get in, as the place is very small and always packed (just another testament to how great the cuisine is) but it's definitely worth it. Why let something as trivial as a ten minute wait rain on my eating escapades?",

One of the best Izakaya's \"around\"!  A fun, chill, and comfortable dining experience.  Great atmosphere, excellent service, and friendly staff.  Don't know what to eat?  Ichiza has an enormous selection of dishes to choose from.   Whether raw, cooked, or weird.....for the daring or faint hearted, theres something for everyone.  The portions and affordable prices are definitely a plus!  Now, I can go on and on and on about every dish that was ordered....but who's to say you have the same taste as I?  All I can say is, I was back the next evening......Delicious!!  If your expecting Ichiza to be a gourmet, high end, or fine dining experience?  Look the other way.  It's far better.  It's not just another Japanese restaurant, it's an experience.  If you've ever been to an Izakaya in Japan, I'm sure you would agree.  A great place for friends and social gatherings.  Kampai!!  Pros:  Great food, service, atmosphere, and affordable prices. Cons:  The weekdays can get busy.  Come early and avoid the wait.",

My friends wanted to eat buffet in one of the casino hotels.  I told them that there is this one place in Chinatown that had rave reviews from some of my other friends and on yelp as well.  They were really not buying this idea about this restaurant but I got them to go anyways.  It was even worst when we got their and we had to wait 20 minutes when we were all hungover and really hungry.  After sitting down we ordered a bunch of the appetizers and no sashimi or sushi (which is NOT my normal thing) and I must say...it was the BOMB!  Even my friends thanked me for making them come to this restaurant versus a buffet.  Their uni pon, Agedashi tofu, gizzard, fried chick, grilled squid, shishito peppers, gyoza, red snapper carpaccio, yellowtail tar-tar and miso butterfish was to die for.  My fave is their beef tongue!!  I had to add a second order of it.  We also had their specialty desert, warm toast and ice cream, that we were not too fond of because it was way too sweet.  All-in-all...i will definitely be going back to this place.  If possible EVERY time I am in Vegas...this would be one of the must go destinations.",

We had to take our shoes off, so for me this was a totally new and amazing experience.  We had: Saki: good quality and good size Baby Bok Choy: soooo good and it was in a garlic sauce Ramen with egg and short rib: That short rib was so killer I wish they put in more than 1 piece Spicy Tuna Roll: really good quality (and I am a sushi snob) so I was very happy Yellowtail Tar Tar: sweet and buttery and that chip brings it to a whole new level I was very impressed. My favorite thing I had. Shrimp Fried Rice: I thought it would be standard, but it wasn't. With 4 people we had 2 orders and ate everything that is how good it was.  While I had saki, my friends ordered these drinks that you squeeze your own lemon and pour it in your drink. I forgot what it was called, but i tried some and it was delicious. The service was also spot on and everyone that works there was really nice.   Next time I go back I need to order that Honey Toast that everyone is talking about. We didn't order it because we were so full and we ate EVERYTHING!   I gave it 4 stars because I wish they put in more short ribs in the ramen. That is the best tasting short rib I have ever had in my life. And I need to order the honey toast so I can finally give this place 5 stars. You'll be seeing an update from me soon.",

We had: - pork belly & shiso leaf skewers - yellowtail tar tar - red snapper carpaccio - creamy shrimp   I've already made a list of must tries for our next visit.

Restaurant is open late and service is usually good. Pricing is not bad at all. Their Japanese apple curry, hamachi kana, and their chicken karaage are fantastic. Location to strip is nice and plenty of parking in back of strip mall if usual crowded front has no parking. The layout of the place is very authentic. Go check this place out!",

    "text": "Personal Rating : 2 - Do not like the service, owner can be rude. slow response to my request.  Effectiveness : 4.5 - I like the atmosphere, food, and late hour operation  I visit here very often. I like the fact that it open opens till the late time. However, they don't open till the afternoon. Since it is a small and popular place, It is understandable that I had to wait. I usually wait about 10 to 25 minutes.  However, they reserve tables for group reservations or maybe personal connection with the owner. I had to wait 30 minutes for table for 2 because they pre-blocked 4 big tables for as 'reserved' and the people did not show up even after we got our seats for 2.   Nice place if you want to bring a new friend or date. Nice atmosphere to not to be awkward with your date ;) They have good tapas. I would say Asian Firefly.   However, since they are so  busy, I usually have to tell 2, 3 servers to get something other than the order. such as napkins, more water, hot waters, extra spoon.  I wish they were more pro-active. Defiantly Not a 5Star service. It is more of Fast Food dining service.   The menu is confusing. minimum photos of the foods, and most of the Good menus are on the Wall. and... no description...   One time they gave me the wrong order because they gave me a \"new menu item\" when i ordered the Original. and when we requested for the original dish, the owner tried to sell us the wrongly made dish. instead of offering or apologizing for giving out the wrong order. One time, the fried rice was burnt. We got a new one.   Clearly,  Good place to hang out with your New Date, New Friend, or to hang out for Late Dinner. Fun, tasty small dishes.  However, if you are looking for something to fill you up? A Good Meal? I don't recommend.  Not Rude but Not a pro-active service Neither.",

    "text": "I love this place. I've been going here since 2002. During a rough patch in my life, Ichiza's half bowl of ramen noodle at the bar with a pint of Kirin (draft) was a good source of cheer and comfort for me when I first moved out to Las Vegas. Since then, I've introduced this place to tons of friends and it's one of the few places I go back to visit when I'm back in town.  I can't add substantially more to what others have already said - yes, order the specials from the wall; no, you don't have to read Japanese (but it helps). This place is known more for it's small dishes not so much it's sushi/sashimi (although they serve that too) - so go elsewhere if you expect this. Else, be prepared to share and drink a few with friends if you go b/c the dishes are small and everyone can't resist a taste, right?  My faves? Among others, my staples are the fire roasted eggplant (a nice smokey flavour to it!), black cod (tender and flakey....), ramen (shoyu), super fried udon noodles (now defunct - they stopped serving a couple of years back - but maybe if everyone asks loud enough, they'll bring it back?), wasabi tako (nice wasabi flavour), the vegetable tempura over rice (a bit greasy, but good after a long day of hiking) and the chawanmushi (I grew up with this stuff...so good memories for me!).  Interesting items? Of course. But the bacon wrapped mochi stands out...I like mochi...but have since sworn off bacon and pig stuff....so I'll always have to miss out on this from now on. :(  Overall, a great place...prolly one of the first innovators for this type of establishment in the Las Vegas area, but I've heard others have popped up since. Regardless, it's a good standby and quality is good and it's cheap. We had a bachelor party dinner here a year ago and the total bill per person was only $50 including drinks. Tell me where in Las Vegas you could feed 10+ guys with good Japanese food that cheap?",

The prices aren't bad either with the things I usually order never costing more than $10.  My only gripe about this place is that they have tons of special dishes that are featured all over the walls of the restaurant, so if you don't see something that you like on the menu you have to scour the photographs on the wall for a dish.",

Although sushi and sashimi is not their specialty, IMHO it's as good as any in Vegas except for Sen and Osaka.    I dine at Ichiza quite often, even though it's a 25 minute drive.  It's also my age-4 daughter's favorite restaurant.  (She's always begging to go there to eat hamachi sashimi.)",

We ordered the agadeshi tofu, jalapeno fried rice, chicken gizzards, braised pork belly, and a roll recommended by the waitress.  Everything was decently cooked but some of it was too greasy and the food tasted rushed.  There were a lot of people in the restaurant and waiting outside.  Finally we got the honey toast.  Really.... I don't understand the hype.  It's a cube of bread toasted with vanilla ice cream and honey poured on the top.  Really, that's it.  If you want to try something a little quirky and Raku is closed (where we initially wanted to go) I would say okay.  But this place isn't really that special and there are so many places to go for food in Vegas.",

    "text": "Among the different asian ethnic fare within a 1 mile radius, I would be skeptical to think that this small joint in the 2nd floor of a small strip mall would produce authentic izakaya fare but I was suprisingly wrong.  Very very authentic dishes and suprisingly quick to come out.    We made a reservation since we had 6 people and our table was ready even though we showed up a 1/2 hour early.  We started off with a couple of nama biiru straight off the tap.  Nothing starts a meal off better.  We ordered a variety of items since it was our first time here.  All were pretty good and none were bad.  Sake sashimi - Very fresh which is all that counts Buta kimchee - Good taste, no sourness from kimchee at all. Buta kakuni - Decent portion and good flavor.  Soft as it should be. Tai Carpaccio - Very unique.  Ikura and onions and yamakake come with. Tsukune - A little small but pretty tasty.  Add a little shichimi on top and you are set. Fire roasted Nasu - Not sure how they prepared this but it seemed steamed but had a very noticable smoky flavor. Oishii. Tatsuteage - How can you go wrong with fried chicken. Yamaimo Tempura - Good batter is the key to tempura and this place has it.  You can deep fry anything as tempura with a good batter and it comes out roses. Asari Butter - Steamers with wine, butter, and lots of garlic.  So good. Uni Mochi - Saw the reviews and had to try it.  Not bad.  Would have liked more uni and less mochi, but the taste of the mochi is what makes this so unique.  Good idea to make it look like a nigiri with the nori wrapped around the mochi and uni on top.  Good. Yaki Onigiri - A good one is hard to find and this place's yaki onigiri is pretty good.    All in all, the food is definitely authentic izakaya and the atmosphere and decor actually reminds me of an izakaya in japan.  Seating can be independent or bar style or community table or even tatami area.  Even though no smoking is allowed, there is definitely a smokiness from the grill that fills the room which is always natsukashii.  A definite change from the normal Vegas fare.  Next time I am going with a different mindset.  I am going with a few dishes, shochu, and for dessert, ramen for me, honey toast for the wifey.   Tanoshimini.  Can't wait.",

Yep, hard to describe if you haven't had it.  Crunchy?  Snappy?  Kinda like biting into a good dog and it snaps when you bite it....either way, a delicacy?  Sprinkle some Togarashi on it and bite a pepper with it and you are really grubbin now....oh, and wash it down with some Sapporo or Kirin on tap.  One of my fav sashimi is Bonito, they serve it with ponzu sauce, green onions,ginger and white onions, yummmmmmm. On the hott side, I tried the grilled black cod (butterfish) oh soo tender, flaky, buttery....had to order some rice to eat with it (gotta have my rice) the skin: salty, crispity, crunchy, my mouth waters just thinkin' about it.  My neighbor shared their unagi,tempura,tuna roll thingy....the trick is to get the whole piece in your mouth to experience the plethora of complex flavors, pleasant to the palate yet tantalizing to the tastebuds... then we started sharin' beeeers together... let's just say sapporo stock went up that night, cool peeps though.  I'm not much of a sweet tooth, so I didn't try the infamous \"honey toast\" but it does look good...  til next time, happy Izakaya-ing!",

While waiting for a table I browsed through yelp and come to read that what they had on the wall is in their menu too so no need to worry. But still I felt like I was going to miss out on something delicious. So I asked the hostess and our waitress what they recommended and took their advice.  We had: *yellowtail tar tar * gizzard w/green onion (sorry I forgot the actual name of the dish) * squid (1 large piece just grilled) * beef carpaccio * eel on top of a california roll * honey bread Total around $47 The food was very yummy and just enough for a late night meal. Their food reminds me of pulutan. That's tagalog for to pick. Meaning food you pick on while drinking with your buddies. Did that sound right? Anyway, another fine place to take the homies to when they come to town.",

And I am just a little bit jealous that you get to experience this place for a 1st time and alas, I will never have the opportunity to lose my Ichiza \"virginity\" again. Maybe if someone to smack me with a cast iron skillet in the head? Willingly, please?!? Due to the evolving menu and enourmity of it, I wont delve too deeply into individual dishes here. The menu is based on that days purchases and is updated throughout the night as things are written in chalk all over the walls...... Dozens and dozens of daily specials on top of the regular menu. While the menu fare is excellent, the real stars are the specials on the walls. Corn butter. Yes, oh my god, corn butter. Luscious and tender Pork belly in a delcate miso. Home made spring roll unlike any other \"springroll\" youve ever had. Seriously. Did I mention corn butter? The food here is so simple and delicious that one would think that they were complex after all, just miso and a piece if pork couldnt taste that good on its own...in style, the food is almost a japanese version of tapas, whereas dishes are generally smaller, tasting portions rather than huge entree plates. These are meant to be sampled throughout the night during glasses of beer and shoju..... The atmosphere is inrimate yet loud, as the space is small and always full. Located off the strip and in a medium sized mall known as Las Vegas' Chinatown, this easily outdoes 98% of the other dining experiences in an already highly gifted food mecca. Trust me, go and reward yourself... And be adventurous here, try a few new things. Food is the star here, you can keep your Elton and Celine.",

    "text": "Continues to be great food!  After ordering about 15 items or so, here's the standouts:  Vegetable croquettes - perfect crisp, awesome flavor.  Ichiza Ramen DX - Continues to be great broth, springy noodles, and perfectly cooked half egg.  Pork belly was a little bit overdone, but the only weakness I'd say.  Broiled rice - so simple, so delicious, so surprisingly good.  Chicken skewers - Phenomenal!  So tender, so delicious...  Chicken balls - I wasn't as big of a fan, but two of my dining mates loved it and dubbed it the best dish of the night.  Tofu steak - Super tender tofu, a nice crisped outing, very tasty!  Beef tongue skewer - Tender and well seasoned!  Excellent.  Honey Toast - Honestly, solely because of this dish, I may make my way to Ichiza every time I'm in Vegas.... soooo good and what a way to end a great meal already.  Verdict:  Do it.  Go early if you can before it fills up (even on weekends) and enjoy a great meal.  The four of us had a ton of dishes, two bottles of sake, and came out to around $25 a person for some spectacular food.  And vegetarian friendly!",

We came with a group of 4.. 3 asians and me...Even the famed honey toast didn't make any of us want to come back here again... Maybe we should have come with a regular or done more research.  It was hard to know what to order because the dishes are posted all over the place and even the stuff we asked the waitress for recommendations on wasn't any better. I can't even remember what we got because the food was not memorable at all... We had a lot of bland stuff... then some spicy stuff..that's about it...  I remember the bubble tea I had downstairs more than this meal apart from remembering my disappointment...",

    "text": "Ah, Ichiza. I gotta give it up, yo. It's most certainly always a good time when I roll through and I have no problem bringing friends to enjoy in your delectable delights. As some of my good friends know, I have this love-love relationship with  Japanese food and anytime the option presents itself to get my grub on, I am sure to follow through. Ichiza is one of those spots that I usually don't frequent too often like I do other Japanese establishments but if I have a pretty good sized group gathered willing to drink some beer or sake and have some small plates to accompany, this is usually my go to.  As far as food goes, I usually hit up the specials menu to start off the night.  Last time I stopped in, they had shigoku oysters, chu-toro, and kohada (as you can tell, I love me some SEAFOOD!.. or if you don't, google it heehee) on the special menu for the day and I delightfully ordered it up. The special menu rotates daily (?) so be sure to check it out whenever you stop in as it changes and presents some new stuff upon each visit.  From the regular menu, I am always happy to suggest the oyako don chicken bowl, ikayaki whole grilled squid, and the uni in ponzu sauce (if they still have any in stock).  I always round it out with some sunomono cucumber or wakame seaweed salad to make my meal somewhat complete and to my definite satisfaction.  Not a big dessert guy but gotta give a shoutout to the honey toast here; definitely a fan favorite.  Tip: look at the menu posted on the wall as some of it is not mentioned in the menu; if you have a big group, go early to get a table in before your patrons fully arrive to grub; and be sure to check out some of the bottled stuff aside from the house sake and beer as they have some tasty items chillin' in the back  Enjoy!!",

    "text": "I have been here a lot, and i have eaten pretty much every menu.   well, food here is kinda like something that i used to cook when I was a college student. I mean, it's fun, but it doesn't taste that well. I think the quality of sushi here is the same as what you get at Vegas's all-you-can-eat sushi places.   Service isn't professional, either. I guess they are students from college. One time this young chef was trying to get my gf's phone number while I was in the bathroom. WTF! This ain't a college dorm, dude.  So, this totally makes sense - this is a restaurant run by college students. Actually, this is why I keep going here. Atmosphere! Not for food. If I wanna eat beef tataki, I go to Blue Ribbon at the Cosmo. If I wanna eat oysters, I go to Joes at the Ceaser's palace. If I wanna eat sushi, I NEVER go to Ichiza simply because fish here sucks!   However, if I wanna simply have fun and get wasted by not spending too much money, I go to Ichiza. Overall quality is pretty fuckin crappy, but for that reason i keep going.  Definitely not for rich businessmen and lawyers.  Btw, when it is jammed like on weekends, your server might be pissed if you stay too long. I saw the manager was asking a waitress to kick customers out as soon as they finish eating and drinking. I even saw the (kinda old dude) manager was kicking this drunk hobo wondering outside the restaurant. Not good. Kicking is a crime! What a kangfu restaurant it is!!",

    "text": "This is definitely a place for cheap good eats in Vegas. They are open late (until 4AM).   They do accept reservations, but if you're walking in as a couple they will most-likely seat you at the bar if it's busy.   This place definitely gives you the Japanese restaurant authentic feel, and well, it is. The menu is filled with Japanese food items even delicacies (for example octopus and wasabi which is a raw slimy dish of octopus legs + wasabi) They have the regular menu and they also have additional items written up on paper with pictures of the items and these are posted against the wall.   It's soo hard to choose something from the wall because THEY ALL LOOK SO GOOD!! (amirite frequent flyers?)   I recommend getting the tuna tar tar. You get about 6 pieces of fresh raw tuna and some seasoning with avocado on flaky little squares of heaven.  It's delicious.   I normally get the mackerel fish here (they give you the whole fish) for only $4.95.  and the deep friend ika rings - squid rings like calamari but much better quality and thicker pieces. They give you a side of the oyster sauce which makes a much better pair than regular red calamari sauce. Seriously, you should try it :)   I recommend this place for a casual dinner or late night snack + drinks.",

    "text": "When a friend of mine says they want me to take them on one of my food adventures, ichiza is one of my favs.  I love communal eating so Japanese tapas hits my happy place. It's Located on the top level of one of the many outlet malls on spring mountain.  I love walking into the space here. The first stand out feature is the seating is intimate and lively, with only a few tables and is almost always full, even at 2 in the morning. The kitchen is small and completely open, and I always try to sit at the bar so I can watch the the 8 or so people run and create beautiful dishes.  Secondly they have a small basic menu you can order from, however all the specials are posted on cards all over the walls. So this adds to the excitement of your experience, leaning backward and forward to find something new and delicious to try, if that's your thing. ( it's soo my thing) I recommend trying anything off their \"most popular\" cards. I love the tuna tar tar, red snapper carpaccio, tofu salad. I also enjoy the beef tongue ( if your adventurous) and the spinach and tuna roll. And for dessert you have to try the honey toast, or the coffee jello both are tasty fun desserts.",

    "text": "My husband and I typically crave fish tacos, turkey burgers, and French fries after a marathon. Hearty food you can really sink your teeth into. So when my sister excitedly informed me she was thinking of making a dinner reservation for the four of us (her, her boyfriend, my husband, and I) at Ichiza (a favorite eatery of hers) following the Las Vegas Rock 'N' Roll Marathon to celebrate my husband's 16th (or 17th, I've lost count) marathon, I felt apprehensive. The hubby burns something like a billion calories after running 26.2 miles, so I could only imagine how many spicy tuna rolls he needed to consume to feel completely satiated. Nevertheless, I didn't want to burst my sister's bubble so I gave her the green light to book us a table.  We arrived at the restaurant shortly after 9 p.m. and seated at a wooden table. After we gave the server our drink orders we studied the tapas and regular menus. The four of us wound up selecting a bunch of items to share. Here are my favorites:  -Yamakake (grated Japanese mountain potato mixed with Maguro and shoyu)  -Ohitashi (seasoned boiled spinach) -Miso Black Cod -Chicken Yakitori -Salmon Skin Salad -Spicy Tuna Roll -Chicken & Egg Bowl -Sake Ochazuke  Ichiza is open daily until 3 a.m. and according to my sister crowded at all hours. Offering delicious, authentic, flavorful Japanese fare in an unpretentious space, Ichiza is located on the second floor of a shopping center in the heart of Little Asia.   Prices are reasonable. Waitstaff is polite and attentive (my ocha cup was refilled at least three times). Hip decor, that is, if you consider the definition of \"hip decor\" to be signs written in both English and Japanese listing daily specials splashed all over the walls (which I do).  Tip: Be prepared to wait.",

Sashimi salmon and yellowtail, okonomiyaki, oysters with ponzu sauce, beef tongue stew, seafood quesadilla, jalapeno fried rice, etc. The list goes on and on. Great place to share a bunch of food.  I visit Vegas maybe once or twice a year. I frequent Ichiza as many times. It is pretty close to the strip (not really walking distance, take a cab!) and it's located in Chinatown.

    "text": "Thank God for Yelp in helping me find this place.  When we got there, we ACTUALLY waited 40 minutes for a table.  I never wait that long, but I figure there was a reason why.  I made use of my time and observed plates while waiting.  If you really don't want to wait, they just opened a sister restaurant down the street.  I have no idea why the hostess didn't tell us this when we decided to wait.  Also, you can just put in your name, and give them your cell, go grab a drink, and they will call you when your table is ready.  An asian woman actually tried to get a table without waiting by claiming she & her 3 friends eat REALLY fast and that she was there because she didn't like Nobu-LOL, are you kidding me lady?  Well after having dinner there,  I would fly back to Vegas for some more! I just wish I could read Japanese. Writings of menu items all over the walls, you kind've wonder if you're missing out on something.  It was amazing to be seated right by the sushi bar where platings were placed to be picked up. We saw items that didn't even appear on the menu but are located on the walls around the restaurant(written in japanese).  It was like dining in Nobu's kitchen before he became popular! We ordered the wasabi octopus which was out of this world - live octopus marinated in wasabi/yuzu sauce. We also ordered the wagyu beef carpaccio - the best carpaccio I've had.  It tastes similar to vietnamese filet mignon carpaccio but better.  I has a yuzu sauce to flavor it up & fried shallots & shaved onions.  It literally tasted like a medium rare burger with all the fixins.  A dish you really need to try if you're a foodie like me.  We also ordered the tofu/tuna salad which is very refreshing and delicious.  The yellowtail sashimi was served with the fatty part of the tuna along with some of the fat under the skin.  I've never had yellowtail with these parts still attached but it was heavenly like butter.  There were so many orders of stuffed French toast coming out of the kitchen & I promise the next time I will try it but for now, yeah I'm stuffed.  Can't wait to come back for more at this gem.",

They don't have a lot of rolls like everyone else. The menu is always changing and you should order from the wall if you like something different. This time around my friend and I ordered:  Mushroom wrapped in chicken skin- I liked this but my friend didn't. She doesn't care for chicken skin. Cold Ramen Noodle- This was good. It had chicken, bean sprouts, mushrooms and a few other things in it. I would order this again. Mackerel- This fish was good. It was sweet tasting. Tofu Steak- Too spicy for me. I couldn't even taste or feel my mouth for a long time. Seafood Scallop rock and roll- two bite sized pieces. These were really good. I would order again.  Deep Fried Bacon wrapped pork tenderloin- This was really big. I was expecting bite sized nope not really. This item was just okay. I don't think I would order it again. The first few bits were good but the size of the pork on the stick was big.    The service is okay. They are always busy so you cant always get the best service and just so you know we went at 9pm on a Thursday and it was packed and people were still coming in. If you have a big party I recommend reserving a table.",

You should get a few of these.   Lastly - the menu crazy! It is on the menu, but it is also plastered to the walls on a ton of little signs. Ramen DX and Fried Pork with Kimchi were amazing.

Most days you'll find people waiting outside for the restaurant to open.. which is a good sign. I wasn't able to try their apparently infamous honey toast that so many people talk about, however basing my reviews on the bento and the various a la carte sushi items I ordered.. I must say it was a wonderful experience. The uni inside a lemon with ponzu.. was amazing.  I'll have to come back again.. and try that honey toast. heheh.",

The flying fish sashimi was particularly memorable. The server even fried up the head for us, and even *THAT* was delicious!

    "text": "I love this place!   It is so great to find a True Japanese Izakaya anywhere outside Japan, and to find it in the \"Chinatown\" (really, Asiantown) part of Las Vegas was a real treat! I was smiling the whole time eating here!   Izakayas serve a lot of little dishes and comfort foods like in a Japanese home. They are not Sushiyas, so don't expect that, although they may serve some sushi items.   Originally, they were drinking places, where salarymen in Japan would go and unwind, drinking a lot of booze, bond with co-workers, and even complain about or insult their bosses to their faces (to let off steam; and then they could always blame it on being drunk, because if they talked-back or disrespected at work, they would be fired or severely reprimanded). So it was sort of a social safety valve place to relax in a strict culture of respect, protocol and obligation to the group and superiors. The little food items were snacks to help the drinking.  But then, many places became very popular for their tasty snacks. And now, it is a whole category of dining. It is starting to become more popular in major cities in the US. Los Angeles has some good ones, like Musha in Santa Monica and Torrance, or Raku in LA.   An Izakaya is different than a \"Snack\" or \"Hostess\" bar, which in many Asian countries, involves little in the way of food, but a lot in booze and pretty girls to make you feel like a big shot. Izakaya in the US are usually family run, and down home, good for families and even kids.  (Pronunciation tip: do not accent any syllable, they are all even in intonation and emphasis: I-Za-Ka-Ya! NOT iza KAYa!)   This one has a million little dishes to choose from, listed on the menu, and many of the same selections taped all along the walls, mostly in Japanese!   The youthful waitresses and hostess here are all Japanese, so it is a delight, especially if you know a little of the language, because they will scurry around and respond promptly to your requests, as in Japan, with enthusiasm and energy. If they were lazy or lackadaisical in their service in Japan, they would be severely reprimanded or fired. Too bad that doesn't translate to Denny's here!   So this place serves what I like to call, Japa Tapas.   The two of us had Agedashi Tofu, Ikkayaki (whole broiled squid, chopped up), grilled Black Cod (like butter!) , Sake Ochazuke (Salmon over rice mixed with green tea and flavorings) and for dessert, green tea ice cream and 2 flavors of Mochi ice cream, and finally their signature dessert, which is 1/3 a loaf of bread crust filled with honey and vanilla ice cream that we shared with our tablemates. We also had a small cold Kurosawa Junmai Sake.  All delish!   We sat at a community table and met another nice young Filipino couple enjoying their Izakaya experience, and shared stories and dessert with them.    I am coming back here every time I go to Las Vegas! You should, too! Forget those fancy faux Asian places on the strip!   OIshikatta! Tanoshikatta!",

You don't see crap like California roll or Kobe this and that.   Sat on counter with my client, we had good time feeling like back in Japan.   Food quality, however, was hit and miss. Small appt dishes were all good, ramen was too soy saucy. But hey, this is Vegas put of nowhere and we were thankful for this innovative guy running True Essenes of Izakaya business.

I like the atmosphere, because it resembles a japanese pub (izakaya style). It's a chill place to have a few beers and chow down on some good japanese tapas. although it can get a bit rowdy. Some of my favorite dishes include the kimchi fried rice, tako-yaki (octopus balls), beef tartar (rare beef with onion, daikon, and ponzu sauce), kakuni (extremely tender pork belly), and the black cod (smooth as butter). Although it's not on the menu, they even make okonomiyaki (Japanese pancake) upon request. Oh, and I can't forget the Honey Toast that everyone raves about.   They also have a lot of specials on their walls. Check them out as well!",

In the month that I have lived here, I have tried quite a few different places around West LV and Summerlin and thought I would try something along Spring Mountain.  I called hoping this would be a great new place to dine and hopefully become my regular sushi spot as I have yet to find one.    Unfortunately, when I spoke with the man on the phone, he horribly let me down and left the worst possible representation of a business that I have every experienced!  I simply asked if there was a happy hour and before I could follow up his quick, \"NO!\" requesting if they took reservations, he interrupted me by informing me that he is too busy to talk and must go.   As I tried to delicately keep him on the phone to finish my inquiry on the establishment, he promptly HUNG UP ON ME!!    I tried to call back and on my return call, he answered and blurted, \"I am too busy now, must go!\"  And hung up!    Any business that expresses that kind of attitude toward a potential customer, should not be in business.  I can only imagine how they handle the customers in the establishment when they get \"too busy!\"    I refuse to even consider this a place to go and will highly discourage any of my colleagues, friends, and clients from Ichiza as well.",

First of all we went in when the place had 2 tables filled. We were the third set of customers to come in so I thought \"hey maybe we can get awesome service.\"  Long story short a couple of things happened. Servers kept rushing us even though there were no people in line. I was halfway through my Ramen Bowl and the server was already asking me if I was through with my food(with a spoon that's right at my mouth). The servers managed to put our bill as $79.50 even though we barely ordered anything (a Ramen bowl, a Gizzard Skewer, a Beef Bowl, and one Honey Toast) which the servers kindly adjusted for us. But the sheer fact that if I didn't bother looking at the bill then I would've paid for 3 times what our original bill was supposed to be. And for a Gizzard Skewer that kinda fell short. A bill over $50 is even unheard of.   I'm willing to give this place one more try since restaurants have their bad days but not in the near future to be honest.",

So one star off. ---------------------------------  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU to all the yelpers who rated this place highly. That was the main reason why we bookmarked it and decided to check it out. I wasn't sure how late they were open but we arrived pretty late, around 10pm and crossed our fingers as we entered. Man, it was bustling! Turns out they were open until 3am Mon-Sat, until 2.30am on Sundays. However, last call is 45 mins before closing so make sure you arrive on time.  So there were 2 guys waiting for a table and the hostess asked if we wanted to sit at the counter. Lil guy was all for it. So, counter it was. I was just fascinated by the atmosphere in here. There were 2 tatami tables with very drunk people singing and carrying on. They were obviously having a good time.  We were given menus but it was the posted items above our heads which interested me. Hubby left the ordering to me. I ordered an udon ($6.35) for little guy with his usual edamame ($3) and agedashi tofu ($4.35). Then, I proceeded to order a bunch of items for us adults.  Uni pon ($5.50) arrived first. It was 4 plump pieces of uni sitting on thinly sliced cucumbers nestled on daikon spaghetti wading in a pool of ponzu sauce. OMG it was fantastic. The uni was soooooo fresh and flavorful. I could've eaten 3 of these.  Then came the salmon skin salad ($5). This was no ordinary salmon skin salad. This was the emperor of all salmon skin salads I've ever had. Crunchy slivers of carrot, shreds of lettuce, grape tomatoes, daikon sprouts, perfectly cooked salmon skin, grated daikon, topped with a dollop of roe. Hubby and I shared this but were fighting over who got the last morsel.   Taramiso, otherwise known as miso butterfish ($5.50) is something I've been craving since leaving Hawaii. I used to eat it at least once a week. After a year of missing it and seeing it on the menu here was enough for me to kiss the ground of this izakaya. The taramiso did not disappoint. In fact, it was so perfect hubby and I again commented on how much we've missed this dish.  All the while, lil guy was enjoying his udon, edamame and agedashi tofu while watching his portable DVD player oblivious of all the ongoings around him.   Tofu salad with tuna sashimi ($7.50) was interesting yet refreshingly delicious. Romaine lettuce, followed by mashed tofu, topped with diced avocado and cubed tuna sashimi, toss in a few daikon sprouts and a pinch of bonito flakes and voila, a masterpiece. The grape tomatoes complete this both in color and texture.  Of course an izakaya meal isn't complete without some sort of alcohol. We had 2 large bottles of Asahi draft ($5.50/bottle) and then we finished by sharing a bowl of miso chasu ramen with extra chasu ($10). I'm sorry, but Santouka Ramen does not measure up to the ramen here and it was the last item we ate. The broth was perfect, not too salty and not under flavored. The chasu had just the right amount of fat interspersed with the lean bits. It looked like pancetta. Hubby was a bit skeptical but I assured him he would like it, and guess what? He did.  This is definitely bookmarked for our next visit to Vegas, and let me tell you this, I'm reliving my meal right now just by writing this review and the bad part is, I'm not eating the food as I'm writing this. BUMMER!",

    "text": "The first time I came to Ichiza, we dropped by without a reservation on a Saturday evening... Not a good idea. We ended up waiting 45 minutes to an hour, and were starving before we got there, so we almost gave up and went somewhere else. Thankfully, the food was worth it. Some dishes were definitely better than others, but overall we were happy with everything we ordered. In our most recent time, some things I remembered were:  -garlic baby bok choy: not special to my family, but I loved the simple flavor and it was cooked to a nice texture (not too soft)  -fried squid in sweet vinaigrette/vinegar: this was a favorite and delicious- strips of fried squid were on a bed of sauteed onions covered in a sweet/sour vinegar sauce, I would guess it is nanban sauce? It was on a small paper menu which I'm guessing had specials or seasonal items.  -stir fried eggplant and shrimp in chili sauce (sorry if names aren't right, I'm going off what I remember): very tasty if you love eggplants, green onion, and shrimp like me, but the annoying part was the shrimp had the entire peel still on- this was intentional and probably normal but I'm not used to eating it with the shell.  -3 kinds of sashimi: displayed beautifully with thick cuts of fish  -tofu and tuna salad: this one was on the wall, the tofu is soft and the dressing is refreshing and light, I loved the big chunks of avocado  -honey toast: you already know  The only inconvenient part for me was the menu on the walls, it's cool to be able to glance at the wall and pick stuff that sounded good, but I didn't want to walk around the restaurant to read the walls and disrupt others (small place), so it was limited to what I could actually read from a distance. The server gave us good suggestions and food came out quick though! The second time around we made a reservation, but honestly we didn't have to because it was a Thursday evening and it wasn't crowded at all. For a weekend, definitely reserve to be safe.",

In addition to the regular menu there's items posted all over the sushi bar and walls of additional items offered.   The restaurant interior is nothing fancy but for being a Tuesday night it was  still very busy and the restaurant is located on the second floor in a run down shopping center of China town.  I ordered the grilled beef tongue, seared beef bonito albacore salad, Black cod fish in miso sauce, and seared scallops wrapped in salmon sashimi.   Service is not the fastest but the quality of food definitely is quality fresh and unique. The grilled skewer beef tongue was tasty but a tad chewy, albacore salad was the bomb just as the black cod  fish and scallops.  I recommend this place and would return in the future.",

I haven't started eating yet, but what impresses me about this restaurant is its wide selection of small appertizer dishes. I can't comment on the food quality yet as the food I ordered has yet to arrive. However, what I can comment is the service I have been getting so far. If Yelp allows me to give ratings solely based on the service I get, I would give this place \"0\" star. They have to be some of the cockiest servers I've seen, and I can't stand the fact that servers tell me white lies about their reservation status... Gosh, I feel sorry for myself. Highly \"unrecommended\".",

The first time I went it was an easy 4 star but the next time was definitely a 3 (if that).  Won't mention the ridiculously decadent honey toast (oh wait I just did didn't I?). That was good, no complaints there.  The pork belly was good one time, undercooked and nasty the next time.  The chicken yakitori is consistent and good but the tongue yakitori was excellent the first time and way inedible the next. Same with the chicken gizzards. The second time they were so tough that I can't imagine anyone liking them. I'm Americano but I thought they were delicious the first time.  Natto... well... natto... Not included in this review because OMG that stuff is just not for me. The person I was with said it was passable though.  Anyway... without going on and on, first time was very a very solid 4 stars and the next was a solid 3...   Overall I would definitely recommend you give it a shot because if the \"A-team\" is on you're in for a great, unexpected Vegas experience.",

Some stuff I tried: Black cod in miso - normally very well cooked, slightly crisp on the skin side with the fish still soft and buttery. Grilled gobo wrapped in bacon - the gobo can be a bit soft but normally, it has good texture and the bacon does not overpower the earthyness of the burdock root. Oyster mushroom stalk wrapped in chicken skin - can be a textural challenge.  If they are not cooked long enough, the mushrooms can have too much water and they still have a slippery texture.   Red snapper carpaccio - this dish had a lot of flavors that masked the flavor of the fish.  A decent sized piece of fish each served on a slice of lemon, with shaved daikon radish topped with kewpie(?), a few ikura eggs, and chives with a ponzu sauce. Waygu Beef carpaccio - nice flavor, served thin with cracked pepper, sliced white onion, chives, ponzu sauce and a few garlic chips.  Probably one of the best dishes I have had at Ichiza.",

I highly recommend the gyu tataki and yakitori/tsukune.  Also the best part about Ichiza is the price. We had several pitchers of beer, plus ordered non-stop for about 2 hours and our bill came to $165 with tip. Divide that by 6 people, that's $27.5 a person, same price as that sh1tty Wynn buffet.",

    "text": "I enjoyed my meal here. The atmosphere was fun and everyone seemed to be genuinely having a good time. The service was decent considering how late and busy it was.   Salmon Skin Salad- tangy, crunchy, and tasty. I'd order this again.  Buta Kimchi- The kimchi wasn't fermented at all and the pork was sweet. I think I was expecting something more along the lines of the Korean version of this dish so I was disappointed. But even if I hadn't had some sort of idea of what I thought the dish was supposed to taste like, I don't think I would've liked it because it was too sweet for me.  Udon- They were out of Ramen and it being a cold night, I wanted something soupy and hot. I opted for the Udon and was pleased that the noodles were soft without being too soggy and the broth was hot and soothing. Yum.  I rarely get off the strip to eat when I go to Vegas so this was a nice change. Definitely good eats.",

Don't be fooled by the menu they hand you - the real menu, with the yummiest dishes, are on the wall!  We ordered mini deep fried soft shell crabs, bacon wrapped sticky rice (holy ichiza!), mussles, clams, etc. All waaaaay under budget and waaaaayyy fantastical.  Oh and if you're a big drinker, order one of their shoju drinks  - I had a grapefruit cocktail and they served the glass almost full to the brim with half a fresh grapefruit that I got to squeeze all by myself. Refreshing and scarily good - I mean as in I'll order two drinks 'cuz it tastes like juice good.   Will definitely make it a point to come here every time I'm in Vegas even though it's off the strip!",

    "text": "Craving Japanese food, my friends and I turned to Yelp for a killer Japanese restaurant recommendation and Ichiza returned a solid 5 star rating, so of course I had to check it out. This place kicked booty. This is NOTat all your typical family Japanese restaurant with chicken teriyaki, bento boxes and a massive list of rolls.  Rather, this is a True Japanese Izakaya....a bar that has tons of alcohol and a whole bunch of small plates of traditional Japanese \"bar food\" - the kind of food that isn't always offered at more traditional establishments. We put them to the test, and this place delivered on all my faves: yamakake, natto, agedashi tofu, shisamo, ochazuke, ramen and all manners of yakitori. Did we pig out? Yep, definitely.  And washed it all down with a pitcher of Kirin Ichiban and glasses of cold Otokoyama.   As for ambience, expect to see young hip Harajuku-esque Japanese talking on their cell phones and eating ramen while Utada Hikaru (Japanese pop star) blasts on the stereo. I felt like I was in Tokyo again. The proprietor looks like the old Japanese surfing dude from Lost In Translation and the wait staff is very nice. Incredibly cool place with awesome food and a must visit for all of my future Vegas jaunts.",

My local friends would make fun of me, so to remedy that, I'd ask them to take me to their favorite places.   I am in LOVE with this place. The menu was on my table, on the walls behind me, and hanging all over the top of the bar. You have to walk around to see what they have. It's a bit overwhelming. But you totally have to hit this amazing grill/sushi place that is a local favorite. The menu consists largely of small cooked food dishes...grilled fish, skewered items, rolls and marinated sashimi dishes. This is True comfort food...makes me feel all warm and fuzzy...and I always want to go back to hang with my friends and get all happy :)  The last time I was there, I had that honey toast thing. OMG...it was this block of Taiwan toast, filled with honey on the inside and toasted to yummy perfection. They topped it with vanilla ice cream and I wanted to eat the whole thing. But I'm thinking...bad, it was late, too many carbs.  So that's the other thing, this place is open so late, that it's perfect for the Vegas lifestyle.... and those of us who are from out of town and get caught up in it.",

    "text": "First of all, thank you Yelpers!  I never would have known about Ichiza if it weren't for your reviews!  I didn't know such a place existed in Las Vegas!  Last night was my first (of many) visit to Ichiza, and now I love Love LOVE this place!  I had the grilled squid, fresh oysters, grilled smelt, ankimo, chawanmushi, unimochi, and honey toast.  Everything was fantabulous! It was my first time trying ankimo, and now I am hooked!  The unimochi was heavenly...2 of my favorite foods uni and grilled mochi, wrapped up in a little nori sheet!  I saw so many things I want to order on my next visit.  The staff was friendly and remixes of Ayumi Hamasaki's Voyage was bumpin' in the background...what a fun atmosphere!  Everything was affordable, and in small quantities, so it was easy to try many different things.  I got my discount stamper card and will definitely be back at Ichiza regularly.  Finally, I have a great place to take my friends!  Update 2/3/07: Tried to go here for lunch, but they only serve the stuff on their lunch menu at that time.  Mostly bento box stuff, curries, sushi, udon, etc.  They wouldn't let me order anything written on the walls!  Bummer...but I did have the 2 item combo box with miso cod (yummy!) and sashimi.  I was impressed with the quality of the sashimi, especially since it was a lunch special!  Must go back for dinner...  Update 2/4/07: I just HAD to go back!  In addition to the unimochi and ankimo, I got the fried smelt (yummy! I think I prefer the fried vs. the grilled), the takowasabi (yummy!), the mochi-bacon skewers (yummy!), the fried baby crabs (just ok), the uni w/ ponzu sauce (heavenly!), agedashi tofu soup (yummy!), and DH accidentally ordered the uni & natto roll (hella nasty! but only because I HATE natto with a passion!)  Again, the servers were really nice, and I can't wait for my next visit!  Update 3/24/07: Had many of my favorites, plus we tried some new stuff - the gizzard skewers (ok), beef tongue skewers (yum!), chicken liver skewers (ok), wasabi-green-bean tempura (all tempura, and no wasabi), shumai (ok), half ramen (yum!), calpico shochu (can't even taste the shochu - yum!), and of course the honey toast (wish they would put about 2 more scoops of ice cream!) all in all, another yummy night @ Ichiza.  I filled out my 1st stamper card, and now I'm on my 2nd! Woohoo!!!",

(i say this a lot) coming from LA where you have a huge variety of asian food, and this place definitely met my expectations.  the ramen was great! (still not as good as daikokuya, but calms the ramen craving). love the beef tongue stew! (when they have it). its a really hearty stew, and the beef tongue is cooked perfectly! tip: order a side of rice with it. tar tar yellowtail is a favorite. and of course, the honey toast! never had it before, and definitely yummy!   i like how they have izakaya (not sure im using the correct term, but japanese style seating where you take your shoes off and sit at a fairly low table, although they have enough leg room for you to sit regularly) seating as well as regular seating.   aside from the regular menu items. they also have menu items listed on the walls. my only problem is that you cant see all the items, and i find myself walking around a bit to read everything to make sure i dont miss something i may like.  overall a great place. i find myself craving their beef tongue stew all the time, and try to go whenever im in the area, or craving it bad enough to head to that side of town.",

I felt like I was on the streets of japan instead of vegas with all the little hand written specials taped all over the walls.   I love the fact that this is not the typical japanese sushi joint that you see around Vegas, its definetly on its own level and pretty authentic.  Starting off with the seaweed salad, not the usual bright green salad you get, it was yummy and different. Next we got sashimi of albacore and hamachi, ahh heaven! The hamachi was as buttery as it should have been, little bit of soy, shiso, and daikon....phemonal. Moving on we got the grilled squid and well as the grilled pike mackerel, both very nice. I so wanted to try more things but after barely finishing a split beer and all of that which doesnt sound like alot...we left there happy and content...thumbs up..",

Pub like atmosphere, unique, well prepared food, decent drinks.  In 2009 - Ichiza is starting to lose it's luster.  The service has never been the best, but dang it, the service this year has downright sucked -  and heaven forbid someone say sorry for the forgotten orders, the delay in bringing the food, running out of items, etc But the food is still decent - i consider the food to be a cut ( a decent cut ) below Raku but a notch above Shuseki, but i've had better service as of late at Shuseki.  Still love the honey toast, the grilled tongue and the tuna w/ the raw egg ( some of the items are not for the faint of heart )  - the gizzards were cold ( service related )  Based on the number of people still frequenting Ichiza, they probably don't give a rats ass what i think, but  times they are tough, now is not the time to rest on your  laurels !",

    "text": "I picked this place based solely on Yelp reviews, as we were looking to feed a large party.  We wanted excellent food but given the size of our party and the length of our stay - we wanted to keep the cost economical on at least one evening.  Ichiza was perfect.  I think I'd have to go back 40 times to even believe I tried everything.  Everything that we ordered was great food, fresh and tasty.... and unusual, too.  Starting with the beef tongue skewers, which I deliberately called beef skewers to my friends, were very good and most ate theirs even after they knew what it was, though some of them chickened out, as expected.  Uni-topped ricecakes wrapped in seaweed, tofu salad, bbq squid, hamachi dishes galore, and other terrific things.  Our server made a few recommendations too, as there was simply no way for us to pick, given the huge variety of items up on the wall and on our menus.  Our party of 14 did have to sit a bit parted, in two tables next to one another, in an area to the side where you take your shoes off  to sit down.  It was intimate enough, but would have been nicer if it was one large table, but it IS a small restaurant, so.... My table, which consisted of 6 people, had a separate bill.  We ordered a LOT of food, and we were stuffed to the gills by the time we left.  We also ordered at least 5 or 6 bottles of unfiltered sake.... which my friends pounded like it Gatorade.  All in all - between the six of us, with all that food and alcohol, it merely came to $33 per person.  Economical, indeed.  Ichiza, while located far from the strip on the second floor of a \"Chinatown\" strip mall - - is definitely worth a visit on your trip to Vegas.  Excellent food, friendly and casual atmosphere, and good service.  It's guaranteed to be a good evening.  FYI:  Do NOT use the website to make reservations.  Being the worrywart that I can be, I called a few days after having made web reservations to confirm my party's reservation was indeed existent.  Good thing I did, too, because they had no record of it.  I am not sure what happened, but I then proceeded to freak out and ask if we can still come in on Friday and they said that was perfectly fine.  So if you are going here with a large party and plan to make reservations - -  pick up the phone and call.  Do NOT use their website....",

The menu is pretty limited, so you will probably have to get up and look at the rest of the 4,000 items on the wall (many repeated, with very poor description). My husband and I decided on a couple of items:  Tuna roll- tuna was mediocre and not completely cold, and the cucumber was definitely not ripe.  Deep fried tofu salad with spanish mackerel- The tofu was cooked inconsistently, with some pieces being hot and the others cold. The hot pieces where delicious, but the cold ones... not so much. The salad was drowned in peanut dressing, making it almost soup like. It was topped by very salty mackerel  which overpowered the whole plate.   Stir fried beef tongue- The garlicky marinade was delicious but the tongue was definitely chewy and somewhat undercooked (which definitely did not help the texture).   Pork skewer with onion- nicely cooked with good garlic marinade. What you would expect out of a Japanese skewer.  Normally we would order more but I was pretty disgusted by the salad so I left it there. I really wanted to like this place. Maybe I just didn't order the right dishes but the cooking techniques did not convince me and I was actually kind of grossed out. Will not be back unless accompanied by a pro!",

He's a regular at Ichiza so we gave him the liberty to order...  He ordered at about 10-12 dishes including the following:  *Fried Chicken with Mayo dipping sauce: YUMMY!!!! The chicken was fried in a light tempura batter and was moist and tender.  *Grilled Calamari: The calamari was huge and tender. You can really taste the bbq flavor! *Uni: OMG Effen GOOD!!!! The uni was in a lemon rind with some ponzu sauce and it was so buttery and smooth! *Wrapped Tofu: The tofu was wrapped in this weird type of bean curd wrapper. The tofu was silky in texture and had a smooth finish. *Hamachi and Salmon Sashimi: FRESH, FRESH, FRESH! The slices were MASSIVE and the fish was buttery smooth! :P *Yellowtail collar bone: YUMMY!!!! The fish was fresh and cooked to perfection--moist and tender! *Beef and chicken satay: I loved the beef satay. It was grilled perfectly, seasoned well, and had a bite to it! *Chicken gizzard: It was ok, I wish the gizzards was a bit bigger as opposed to being chopped into smaller pieces which made it hard to enjoy the taste and texture. * HONEY TOAST: Holy Smokes....half of a bread carved out, then honey marinating the base of the bread square, then topped off with Vanilla ice cream! You must have a sweet tooth to enjoy this sweet treat! YUMMY!!!! * Etc, Etc, Etc (my memory is bit foggy after all the late nights of drinking)  Of course, we had to wash down our meal with two large pitchers of Kirin! :D  B/C you can't find any decent Asian food on the strip, I can't wait to come back on out next Vegas adventure!",

    "text": "I have been using Yelp for restaurant ideas now for several months, but have never been moved to write a review until tonight.  Tonight, there was no way that I would pass up this opportunity to rave about the first True Izakaya tavern that I have found here in Las Vegas.  I have never even heard of Izakaya taverns until a good friend of ours introduced us to Musha in Torrance, CA and it's been a whirlwind love affair since then.  I love the casual, Authentic Japanese atmosphere of these places.  From the entire restaurant staff greeting you with a hearty \"Irashaimashite!\" as you walk in to the almost-guaranteed \"we'll see you next time!\"  It's never a goodbye, as they know that you will be back..... oh yes, you WILL be back.   There is just that special feeling that you get when you go to an Izakaya tavern. And it was no different for me this time around.  At first we were leery of this place, seeing as how we have never heard of it until I did a Google search for \"Izakaya Vegas\".  But the fact that the first hit was a review on Yelp with multiple 5-star recommendations, there was no way I was going to be swayed by my belief that there is no such thing as \"Genuine\" in Las Vegas.   Am I ever glad that we did.  This place brought back such fond memories of the fun that we had with our friends at Musha.  From the Buta Kakuni to the broiled beef tongue and the Garlic butter clams, this place had everything that I liked Including more reasonable pricing!  Dishes ranged from $1.75 for assorted single skewered meats (Beef tongue, chicken wings, chicken balls) to around $8.95+  for the sashimi plates, with most items ranging in the $4-$5 range. For our first visit, we tried out the: -Shisyamo Age - which are crisp deep fried smelt(3 pieces) stuffed with roe - Boneless and absolutely delicious with either the provided salt or some asked-for ponzu.  -Beef Tataki - Tender seared beef slices dipped in Ponzu  -Yamakake - Tuna sashimi with Yam Potato and some slimy stuff that I just could not identify (I liked it, but people who judge food by texture may be turned off by it. - Not for everybody)  -Vegetable Croquettes - Mashed potatoes, veggies, wrapped in panko and fried until the outside is crisp and crunchy while the inside if hot and well.... mashed potatoe'y?  kind of like a breaded and deep fried Sheperd's Pie, I suppose.  - Broiled Black Cod - The Hands-Down star of tonight's dinner.  Yummy buttery black cod with a sweet tangy marinade and the skin broiled to a crisp ... absolutely delightful.  - Kushi-Tan - Broiled beef tongue on a skewer - The staple of every Izakaya tavern I've ever been to.  A Squeeze of lemon and you're good to go.  - Kaku-ni - Pork Belly, simmered for hours in mirin, shoyu, sugar etc. until it's chopstick-tender and practically melts in your mouth.  Can sometimes be really fatty because of the cut of the meat, but lucikly ours was fairly lean, maybe we got lucky, or maybe they select leaner cuts?  Guess I'll have to order it again next time to find out!  a small bowl of rice is a must.  - And the clencher - Bacon wrapped Mochi on a stick. Broiled to a crisp, yet chewy .... and bacon'y .....  and mochi'y ... it's freaking mocchi and bacon, how else would you describe it? ... you need to try this for yourself if you're adventurous enough, or just hate your heart.  Ichiza is definitely an instant favorite and a must-visit for all of my out-of-town buds.",

Nick, Jess, Rich and I hit Vegas for a variety of reasons from poker to rockclimbing, and decided to have a \"off strip\" experience by staying off Las Vegas Blvd and trying new eateries that is not part of a casino.   After some research, Jess came up with Ichiza, and I must commend her on a great find!   The place was VERY Japanese. Ghetto in a wonderfully fabulous kind of way. The menu is diverse, interesting and off the wall (literally, there were menu items and pictures of the food on the wall).   We had a number of delicious dishes (most of which from the wall, and for which I can not recall the name)... including, I believe, something called the super fry (or was that super fly) yakasoba. And some sort of layered pancake with, get this, mayo. Yeah - weird, but good. Another memorable dish: green tea and rice with little bits of minced salmon... also weird, but good. Not to mention the great rolls.   I wish I can remember what I actually ate so I can give you a better guide to the food, but having sampled close to a dozen dishes between the four of us (family stylin'), I came to the conclusion that you probably can't go wrong no matter what you order.",

    "text": "Over-priced and over-rated.  A big bowl of rice for 2.50? Come on. They raised their prices even though some of the original prices were already high. Prices seem low but it's bar food so paying about 2 dollars for a miniature skewer of  two small pieces of chicken adds up really quickly.   On top of that, the second time we came here, our waitress messed up our order and brought us the cow tongue skewer when we ordered the cow tongue stir-fry.  She was so shameless about her mistake that she forced us to keep and pay for the skewer.  Let's just say that there is only so much cow tongue a person wants to consume before you want to puke. The same waitress told us to \"hide\" our water bottle.  We tried a dozen other things.  Bland fried smelt ( 4 dollars for 3 small pieces)  Good deep fried crabs (about 8 dollars).  Good yakitori.  Salmon skin salad was tiny and tasted only of salt. Bad cow tongue (sliced too thin which makes it rubbery and too salty).  My mother liked their shabu shabu salad and udon noodles with egg and one shitake mushroom.    There were many hits and misses that added up to one giant bill.  Expect to pay more than 40 dollars easily for a few small unsubstantial dishes.  It's a place you might come once to experience Japanese bar food but I find the food lacking and prices too unreasonable for repeat visits.  I came here twice and the second time was very disappointing.    If you like Japanese food,  you'll get better value by going to a Japanese restaurant with traditional basic dishes.  At least you won't leave hungry and broke.",

The menu is so vast that they have enough items to wallpaper the entire restaurant (which they do).   As I said, I honestly can't remember most of the items I've tried. I pretty much closed my eyes and pointed at random items on the menu. I wish I could take the time to walk around the restaurant and see what else they offer but was too shy to do so.  Some of  the dishes I remember are their miso mackerel, crab fried rice and grilled squid. Everything is very reasonably priced which is wonderful because you can order a lot of food without remorse.  The first time I went with a large group. I made the reservation for 6:30 pm and they warned me beforehand that another group is scheduled at 8:00 pm so we would need to be done by then. The waitresses kept reminding us over and over again that we needed to be out of there by 8 and hurried us to place our orders so it kind of dampened the mood. Other than the not-so-subtle rushing, service was okay. The second time I went here, service was better. Probably because it was a Monday night and there were only four of us.  Both times I have been here, it was jam packed. That's how you can tell how popular this place is. Reservations are highly recommended especially for groups. Next time I'd love to sit at one of the low tables where you take off your shoes and sit on the floor for a more authentic experience.  I like to take out-of-towners to Ichiza to show them another side of Las Vegas that isn't a casino buffet. They offer good food for really cheap. I keep forgetting to save room for the famous Honey Toast that I keep hearing about so I'll be sure to order that next time.",

I remember a time, it seems like not so long ago, when 12:30 at night (any night) Ichiza was packed and there was a line to get in. These days that's not the case any more.  The food is still pretty good, but there are some items that are nothing but a pale resemblance of their former selves.   Take for example my favorite item on the menu, the Deeply Boiled Pork Belly. It used to have such a rich and flavorful sauce, evidence that it had truly been \"deeply boiled\". These days the sauce is the color of cheap American beer, and tastes like it came out of a can. The pork was way too tough to have been prepared like it used to be.  Very sad people, why did you have to change perfection?",

Grilled salmon belly marinated in sake lees: very flavorful and cooked perfectly. I'll order this again.   Black cod fish marinated with miso sauce: too salty! The delicate flavor of the cod fish was ruined.   Skewers: chicken yakitori, chicken meatballs tsukune, sweet shishito peppers: all very good. You can never go wrong with their skewers! Great with sake!  Mini honey toast with red bean and berries: this is one of the best ones I've tried. Lightly toasted bread with just the right amount of sweetness. I really like the side of sweet red beans, the fresh berries, and the beautiful presentation. It was the 'mini' version we ordered and hubby and I had to share it.

    "text": "I know this place has been around for awhile, and widely loved.   At 5:30 pm on a Friday, it wasn't busy, but the flood was starting. We sat at the bar. Seats are a bit hard to get in and out of if you have someone sitting at the bench next to you.   Ordered:   --- Fried Ika So good! The breading was light and crispy, not overly greasy. Came with 6 big rings of Ika and lemon slices. I loved it.  --- Tar Tar Yellow Tail I could eat this allllll day. The yellow tail is in small chunks mixed with an avacado sauce and stacked on fried chips, rice, clover garnish. It's absolutely unique and heavenly. Great mix of textures and flavors.  --- Spicy Tuna Roll One of the best I've had. They go very very light on the rice. I HATE when sushi comes with more rice than filling - so many places try to use that as a cover for lack of ingredients.   It was so nice that the rice was really only there to wrap the tuna.  --- Seared tofu steak Did not care of this at all. It's traditional silken tofu style. Only the outside is very lightly seared, so that part came off as a slime. The rest of the tofu steak tasted like nothing. It wasn't marinated; however, it was on a bed of bean sprouts and sauce, which made it bearable. I don't know if I'm just thinking about this dish wrong, but it wasn't for me.  Service was attentive and quick. They move the waiters and waitresses around, so different people were coming to check on us, which I didn't mind. It actually made for a quicker dining experience, which was great for us because we had somewhere else to go.",

First, it's kind of in a sketchy area of vegas and upstairs at a small shopping center. Second, the menu is pretty much not in English.  If you can get over those two things you will LOVE this place. Food is amazing, service is great. Prices are reasonable. Can't beat it. Go here every time I'm in vegas.",

My friends and I ordered a number of things off their menu. As a warning, everything is small plates. Tapas style. Remember, order willingly to your own heart's desire. Luckily, my group of four, spared ourselves the trouble with ordering numerous things so we could munch on a little bit of everything. All of the things mentioned in previous reviews, we're super helpful. We ordered dishes from chicken gizzard, kobe beef tataki, deep fried quail eggs, beef tongue, yellowtail tartare, uni ponzu, bacon wrapped mochi , etc. It was endless for us but we had to stop ourselves somewhere from over-eating.  Would I come back again? Of course!! I love Japanese Tapas. This definitely hits the spot.",

First time trying it and WARNING: there's little wasabi things in it so if you can't handle spicy make sure to ask for it without it.   ICHIZA'S Ramen DX: I really liked this Ramen. I liked how the noodles were cooked and brother was yummy. Would definitely get this again.   Seaweed Salad: was yummy.   Yellow Tail (Hamachi): It was okay wasn't delicious.   Salmon (Sake): Okay as well.   Service: In between attentive and not.   I would recommend this place if you want to try everything with a group of friends. Ramen is a ng portion though.",

Another must try item would be their chu-hi, if you love to drink flavored sake! The only downside for this restaurant is, it's always full with customers, and the wait time is usually between 1hr-2hrs during peak dinner time.",

This place has delicious Japanese food, some dishes with a Korean or Chinese flair, and most under $10 so you can try a ton without breaking your wallet :)   We ordered the sashimi trio, agedashi tofu, pork and shiitake mushroom stirfry, kimchi fried rice, pike mackerel, calamari, and of course the honey toast!! We loved everything, but the dish that could've gone was the pork and shiitake stirfry (nothing special, but good nonetheless). For the price ($5-10 per dish, with the exception of the sashimi), the portions were great.   Definitely make a reservation if you're planning on eating 6pm or later. They're open until 2am every night so great for a late night snack as well! 10/10 will definitely come again :)",

I think it's a good restaurant either for an intimate, cozy meal for two or with a big group. I think I've tried everything on the menu and at least half of the stuff posted on the walls. There are too many good things to describe, but really, if you aren't a picky eater, pretty much everything is delish. I always seem to gravitate towards the pintxos though. This is the perfect place to go to town and order a bunch of dishes to share with the table. When I go I usually get a beer, their sake didn't really do it for me.   I usually try to make a reservation but if you go later in the evening you should be fine. I think they serve food until 2-3ish.",

After a 15-20 minute wait, we were seated at a nice clean table. The walls are plastered with additional menu options, but I couldn't see them all from our table. I think there were more menu items on the wall than in the printed menu! We decided to go for the Honey Toast recommended by Las Vegas Weekly and also tried the Butter Corn. The Butter Corn came out first and was nicely plated. Butter corn kernels on top of crispy chips. Yummy. The best was when the Honey Toast came out. Hot and cold. Sweet and salty. Soft and crunchy. A hollowed out toasted loaf of Japanese bread drizzled with lots of honey and topped with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was love at first bite.   The food was delicious, the prices were affordable, an open parking spot was a bit hard to find (everyone was in here!), and the hours were great for a late night snack during our trip to Vegas! This restaurant is located on the second floor of a strip mall, but luckily we had GPS to guide the way.    Definitely coming back on my next trip to Vegas for some more of that lovely Honey Toast.",

    "text": "I love the decor and feel of this place!  Feels like Tokyo with all the writing on the walls.  We got here around opening time at 2pm on Saturday and it filled up fast.   Yellowtail tartare - Built like a sandwich with crackers instead of bread, rice as a filling, and topped with yellowtail mixed with avocado.  I don't get why this is highly recommended because my party all agreed that it was bland!  Braised pork belly with half-cooked egg - Some parts of the pork were tender and some were dry.  Egg was cooked perfectly.  Broiled butterfish - Like its name, it is extremely buttery but not because of the fish itself but also how it was cooked... to perfection!  I loved the small lotus root slice; nice accent.  Berkshire pork sausage with mustard - These are like better quality Vienna sausages. They look disgusting upon sight (see my picture) but taste delicious with the mustard.  The mustard also isn't as strong as it typically is; you may need more.  Okonomiyaki - If you know how to make this at home, I would stick to that. You can't mess up okonomiyaki too much, even with the mix, and the restaurant makes it just like that.  Uni, natto, and squid roll - Now this is truly a unique item I have not see at any izakaya or Japanese restaurant.  It's acquired because not everyone likes uni or natto.  You get to eat the buttery uni then u get the sliminess of the natto while trying to chew on the squid.  I think it was a bit too ambitious putting these all together because you can't really enjoy any one of the items.  Jalapeno fried rice - HOLY moly.  I thought jalapeno fried rice would mean that they would throw in some diced jalapenos as they are stir-frying it but it was as if they cooked the rice with potent jalapeno water.  It was SO spicy.  Honey toast - I really liked the simplicity of this because there are Taiwanese versions which include multiple ice cream flavors plus chocolate drizzle plus wafers plus whip cream plus whatever sugary substance exists in their pantry.  This one is just buttered bread, vanilla ice cream, and drizzled honey.  If you can, I would tell them to go easy on the honey.  Some may think the butter is also excessive but I liked that it softened the bread.  Izakaya is fun with at least 4 people so you can order a variety of items and taste them all.  Any more than 4 would leave you with maybe 1-2 bites of smaller dishes which would be a problem if you all liked that particular one.",

Definitely not suitable for BIG groups. They can probably accommodate and make it work, but it's snug there.   Very very very authentic menu. I recommend ordering from the \"menu\" on the wall. They even have a menu in all Japanese, so this place is traditional as it comes. You can pretty much can order anything and they will make it how you request and order it. Just don't know how much they will charge.    The raw shaken beef appetizer is a must try. Very very  delicious and it doesn't taste raw... It just melts in your mouth.   We also salmon nigiri. Super fresh tasting. We also had udon and seaweed salad. Definitely a different way the seaweed is presented and prepared.   Everything taste wonderful here and definitely very traditional. It's a bit on the expensive side but it's Japanese so it's expected. But definitely worth it.",

Their drinks are crazy cheap (pitcher of Kirin $15!!!) and we stuffed ourselves.  I think their $9.50 black cod tased just as good as the one we had at Twist the night before on the $185 tasting menu.  I'm adding it to the Vegas rotation.  They're also open till 3AM :)",

    "text": "an authentic japanese izakaya in the middle of the nevada desert?  it is vegas so anything is possible i suppose, but unlike some of the god awful cheesy replicas in vegas (e.g. gondolas at the venetian), ichiza manages to keep it real by being off the strip (chinatown to be exact) and it's definitely worth the cab ride.    [for those not in the know, an \"izakaya\" = the perfect spot to consume large amounts of japanese beer, sake & shochu, along with a myriad of tasty japanese small plates.]  the space is nice with three seating options: tables, counter service & floor seating (the kind where your legs hang under the table..not like tatami).  their menu has a lot of offerings but i'd suggest going off the handwritten specials hanging all around the restaurant.  my favorites were the bacon wrapped asparagus, hamachi tartare, black cod & tofu salad.  we barely dented the menu selections with our 8 person party so i can't wait to go back someday to try something new.  service was attentive & friendly and prices are affordable.  we had our fair share of food & drink and it came out to about $22/person.  granted people generally goto vegas for the glitz & glamour so if that's what you're lookin for seek greener pastures.  but if you're wanting something more low key, then this is definitely the place for you.  would i go back:  without a doubt.",

    "text": "It's along the same lines of Honda-Ya in OC, but much more crowded.  Food was pretty good, but you'll have to stay active to flag down servers for additional orders, refills, etc.   Gosh there were such a flurry of dishes we ordered that I can't remember it all.  To be honest I can't think of anything that stood out to me and if I did remember I don't remember the names, so I guess you'll have to count on other yelpers for that.  I do remember that only a couple dishes were standouts and the rest were fairly good.  But the best part is the price.  I picked up the tab for 6 people - $120.  And we are not small eaters.  We were stuffed beyond belief too, so I consider that a great reason to come here in addition to their late night hours.  They also provide pitchers and sake, so you can continue the Vegas drinking tradition and not risk sobering up even for a second.  = )  Worst part is the service.  I guess it's a vegas thing or an anomaly bc every other Japanese restaurant I've been to seems to pride themselves first and foremost on quick, friendly and efficient service.  But these girls looked like they were either too frazzled to get to everyone or too young to care.  All the waitresses are available for help, but even then we were on the lookout for any chance to flag them down.  Immediately upon entering, you'll notice that about a third of the dishes available for order are posted on many separate pieces of paper on all the walls of the restaurant.  Since I'm getting old and my eyesight is worsening, I had to walk around to get a view of every additional dish not on the menu.  that was a little annoying and I'm sure the other diners didn't appreciate me hovering close to their table while I mentally checked the specials.  We came on a Sunday night with party of 6.  We had to wait about 30 minutes before a table freed up that could accommodate us.  The place is pretty small, but to Ichiza's credit, the people at the big large community table seemed to be together for some meeting and they didn't leave from the time we arrived past the time we left.  They ran out of honey toast, which I read from other yelpers as being a problem, but how hard is it to keep the supplies around for honey toast?  But I'd probably come again bc Ichiza represents a break away from the buffets and excessiveness that is Las Vegas and I really did enjoy myself once we sat down.  Also I have to account for Ichiza's value skyrocketing if you come late night - even after 12AM.  Price: $120 for 6 people for a ton of food Food: Good to Very Good Service: Mediocre Ambiance: OK (specials on the wall and long wait to sit down hurt it) Location: Good (It's in a strip mall with a few other restaurants none of which are as packed and parking is fairly abundant although crazy like a Monterey Park strip mall).",

    "text": "Definitely one of the best japanese restaurants i have been to!! Off the strip which is kinda nice, seen how i dont like having to park in the hotels just to eat... researched restaurants before my vegas trip and found this one. In my weekend trip came here 3 times!! That says something. And a GIANT plus for being open until 3:00am... dayam. japanese food at 2:00am, freaking crazy.  Food is AWESOME!! My favorite is the crab fried rice, but the yakisoba quesidilla is very good as well. Friends had other dishes and everyone was overly satisfied. The sushi was yummy as well.  The one thing i do not like about the place is where they have all the specials.  They have specials and menu items posted on the walls everywhere, so if you sit down in one section you cannot see the items on the wall over on the other side, so unless you want to go over and look at the wall while disturbing the table by it, then you will never know what is over there.   :(  Plus we were really lazy and did not want to look. But other than that Ichiza was great, didn't wait long at all, and very very reasonable!!!   Definitely try the banana crepe for dessert!! Mouth watering delicious!! Cannot wait to go back, at least i am only a 1 1/2 hour plane ride away and i frequent vegas quite often!! DEFINITELY if you want some japanese food in vegas forget the high class expensive ass hotel ones and come here!!",

We had no idea where to go and the cab dropped us in the parking lot of a two story strip mall that didn't look too appealing to start off with. After walking around a while, a very helpful local directed us to Ichiza. By the outside appearance, I didn't expect much.  It was very quaint, very pleasant and seemed very authentic. We sat at the bar and were a little confused on where to start. After settling in we enjoyed several plates of sushi. My favorite was the YellowTail Tar Tar. (Had two plates of that!) The beer was cold and everyone was pleasant. Three different waiters served us and all were attentive and seemed eager to help.  The bill wasn't bad and even though seating was limited, we never felt rushed to leave. Other than the girl sitting next to us that said 'crazy' more times than a stuck Patsy Cline LP, it was a very enjoyable visit. It wasn't the best sushi I've ever had but everything fit nicely. We had no expectations and it definitely over delivered.",

It's perfect when I go to Vegas because after a night of goin out, that's always my late night spot to go to and it doesn't mean I go there and think it's good since I'm intoxicated because I've been there a little buzzed and been there completely sober. I've tried the chicken meatballs, grilled squid which is really good, but my fave dish is their  \"hokke shio yaki\" or grilled mackerel. mann this had a buttery flavor to it and since I'm a huge seafood fan already, let's just say I can have this dish everyday. even with my wheaties for breakfast in the morning. On a serious note, another thing I like about Ichiza and my gf liked is that their dishes aren't big portions and pretty cheap so you can try out different dishes with rice on the side and  be really satisfied with a good meal with out breaking  bank. It's also really close to the strip so it helps especially if you arent a Vegas local.  Like I said I'd highly recommend, the only reason why I didn't give it another star is cus we tried to have lunch there and they weren't open till the afternoon. other than that, this is the spot I don't miss out on every time I'm in town.",

We came in around 10:15 pm and were just waiting for at least 5 minutes before we finally were acknowledged by an employee.   When we were seated, we were given menus and ended up ordering:  Octopus & Cucumber, $4.95 prior to tax- Liked the cold, sliced chewy pieces of octopus. This was refreshing with the sliced cucumber pieces.   Daikon Salad, $4.50 prior to tax- Great size for the price, loved the daikon and thought this was refreshing as well. The salad dressing was good but I thought the plum sauce added was too salty. Good think there was only a small amount of it.   Ika- Yaki (Grilled Whole Squid) $6.75 prior to tax- Tasty, great chew and a good amount for the price. But a little on the salty side.   Mixed Veggie Tempra Bowl, $6.95 prior to tax- Although this is a vegetable tempora bowl, please note that seafood is added. But I believe you can order to have that omitted. This is a great size to share with another and can easily feed 2-3 people. I liked the flavors of the tempora and rice.   Ichiza's Ramen Noodles, $8.50 prior to tax- My husband decided to order this. I was disappointed that this was rather bland. The broth didn't have much flavor and would not recommend ordering this.  ----------------------------------- (Total= $34.26 after tax, prior to tip) *Please note that there is a $10 minimum for credit card transactions.  Service was lacking significantly. A table that was seated after us (party of 3) had their order taken before us. I had to remind an employee a few times that I wanted 2 plates so that my husband and I could share our food. We also needed 2 bowls for the ramen and bowl that we ordered. We also asked for some sriracha sauce for the ramen, which took a while to get to our table.   With the 3 servers working during our visit, we only had our water glass refilled once (it would have been nice for it to be refilled at least one more time during our late dinner experience). The place wasn't even full.   When I asked for a to go box for my leftovers, it never came. I just ended up getting it myself because I didn't know if anyone was ever going to bring it to the table.   Although most of the food that we ordered was good, it was annoying and disappointed that the service failed. I don't appreciate being ignored during my dining experience and so I won't be back here.   The only reason why we came here was because it was highly recommended by a Lyft driver that gave us a ride to the strip from our hotel (off the strip) and also the highly rated reviews (overall 4 stars with over 1400 reviews). Maybe we came on an off night, but I am not willing to give Ichiza another chance.",

    "text": "We visited Ichiza late on Monday night after seeing a show on the strip.  This place is easy to find and staff greeted and seated us straight away.  Tables are clean and set out to make the restaurant seem open and light, however they are a little close together, which made trying to get in and out from the benches against the wall a little difficult as another party were sat very closeby.  Thankfully the benches had cushions so they weren't as hard or uncomfortable as the chairs, but could really do with a wash for all the stains on them!  We ordered a few small plates that were reasonably priced - the seared pork with kimchi was a little fatty but delicious in taste! A favourite for both my partner and I. It was also a god size as a small plate, but we could have easily had that over again for the smokiness of the meat and the saltiness and flavour of the kimchi. We also had the calamari that came with a cream cheese and soy tasting dressing. This was substantial in the meat that came out, but was a little too oily in taste. The last meat plate we tried was the deep fried pork skewers, which we were disappointed with and couldn't finish. The meat wasn't very flavourful and all we could taste were the huge chunks of onion deep-fried within the skewer.  My partner had a Sapporo beer, which was great value and we ordered a hot and good sized rice bowl as a side.  We would definitely return here to try some more of their menu as we only got to try a few small things. I would for sure take into account reviewer's advice on what to order, because what we enjoyed, we loved! But not everything on their menu is amazing.",

Skewers could have been served much more warmer to indicate its freshness. Whole squid is a super delight instead. Felt like it was cooled down. I like that there was a unique special menu. Ordered Tom Yum ramen with Pork Belly and the Pork Belly is a 5/5 to me, soup on the mild side but it's okay. Everything compliments well in the ramen. Also got the Cha Shu roll, it could have been better if the portion of the Cha Shu meat was better and seasoned.",

Food:   Pork Belly Yakitori Tonkotsu  Ramen with Pork Belly Spicy Ahi Sushi  The pork belly ramen was just alright.  Nothing to rant about.  I've dined at a lot of ramen joints around and unfortunately Ichiza did not deliver. The pork belly was the worst I've ever had.  I eat Yakitori every week and this dish was just meh.  The sushi was good.   2 stars being open.  I knocked out another star due to the server or kitchen with forgetting about my pork belly yakitori.  I had to ask for it and I was done with my ramen.",

    "text": "You're getting off work. You don't feel like cooking, you want something to drink, and you want something more than just boring-old happy hour food. If you're up for it, why not head to Chinatown and sate your appetite there? This time, the place is Ichiza, a Japanese izakaya -- the Japanese equivalent of a bar where salarymen spend their after hours drinking the night away!  ( Full disclosure -- as I drive myself to these places, I don't drink for precisely that reason. Please drink responsibly! )  Ichiza is one of those unique restaurants where their specialty is a little bit of everything, from the usual ramen and sushi to more interesting dishes like shishito peppers, jellyfish sashimi, and robata skewers. Whatever you're in the mood for, you can find it here!  Their menu is structured such that all of their dishes are small to medium-sized so that one can enjoy a little bit of everything, though more substantial portions like their rice bowls, ramen and noodles are available for those who want them.  I started off with their miso soup, yakko ( cold tofu ), red snapper carpaccio, and ketsuo tataki, all of which sans the miso soup were relatively cool appetizers that were a welcome change from the heat. In particular, the ketsuo tataki was thick and meaty despite being fish -- together with the miso soup, both of them were my favorite of the cold dishes I ordered.  Next I ordered the kakuni pork belly and the beef tongue and mushroom stir-fry -- your mileage may vary on this one, but I like the fact that the pork belly had a fair amount of fat on it. It helped the pork melt in the mouth, and the beef tongue with mushroom stir-fry together with some rice makes for a filling meal all by itself!  While I'm commenting on menu items -- you're given a menu with drink specials, food specials and a regular menu, but looking around the restaurant, you'll ALSO find papers with off-menu food that you can also order. Some say this makes it difficult to decide on what to order, but I think it offers a good variety of food for even the pickiest of eaters.  For round three, this time I went for skewers -- beef tongue, chicken meatball, pork and shiso leaf, bacon-wrapped mochi, and shiitake mushroom. All of them were good, but my personal favorites were the beef tongue, pork and shiso leaf, and the mushroom, mainly because they have such a deep flavor that's really brought out with grilling.  For my last round, I ordered the yamakake, tuna sashimi with quail egg and mountain yam -- an unusual ingredient that is known to be rather sticky despite being quite clearly raw. Despite my unfamiliarity and my admitted adverse reaction to the latter two ingredients, I enjoyed the dish immensely and ended up finishing the tuna and some of the yam! This is an example of a dish you won't find elsewhere -- and I think it was delicious despite not being Japanese enough to completely finish the mountain yam and quail egg, lol.  Now, of course, Ichiza has a good number of desserts that are delicious and not too sweet, like their pudding and their honey toast -- both of which are perfect ways to end a meal! If you're like me, though, I typically go elsewhere for dessert since Chinatown has no shortage of dessert stores and shops that serve all manner of delightful sweets. If you do decide on dessert here, though, I highly recommend the pudding and the red bean and berry honey toast!  This is just a small sampling of the food they have on order -- and I've included pictures from past ventures here to illustrate my point. That said, if you're looking for a new and interesting spot to go to after work, Ichiza's a good place to check out!",

It comes with six rolls so...not small, but cheap, but quite tasty.   The crab croquette au gratin is super fun. It's got seafood, pasta, some tasty gray, and a fried tasty exterior that I want to say is potato. It's totally shareable but I don't blame you for eating one all by yourself.   Also, I thought I didn't like takoyaki until I had it here. It's really tasty. So if you've had it at curry zen, like I did, and said, \"never again,\" give this one a spin.   My buddy defiantly ordered the ramen dx. He loved it and chastised me for steering people away from it. The only caveat is that it's extremely filling and you won't have much room for other stuff.   Tako wasabi is some Andrew Zimmern stuff. Get it if you want to live on the edge. Raw squid with fresh Wasabi. Stir first.   Pork udon noodles were good. Good for sharing.",

Does anyone else remember when this was the only spot in town?  I love that scent of the thousands of grilled fish embedded into everything in the room; almost nothing has changed inside and it feels like a museum exhibit in a really cool way.  The items we tried from the specials menu, which is where a ton of the good stuff is, were awesome starting with the \"Aji Special\", a whole horse mackerel sliced up sashimi style, beautifully presented.  After we finished that up, they deep fried the bones for some excellent fish chips (eat the head).  Grilled Salmon Collar\" made me holler with its rich, oily, soy and mirin flavors at a totally slammin deal of only $10.  The \"Spicy Deep Fried Chicken Soft Bone\" had a nice Korean kick to it and went great with Hakkaisan sake.      \"Yellowtail Tartare\", one of their most well-known dishes, now comes off as prehistoric in appearance.  The mix of hamachi, avocado and mayo topped over what's basically rice sandwiched between two nacho chips totally took my taste buds down memory lane.  It now kind of feels like one of the evolutionary steps that lead to crispy rice sushi; still good though.   There were so many other items I had forgotten about like niku-jaga, yamakae, buta-kimchi and many more that I plan on reuniting with soon.   Bad parking lot be damned!",

(They are delicious and typically a good deal at 6.95)  My friends kept asking for a large beef bowl which caught me off guard because they only serve one size from what I can remember in the last 7 years.  So I get me bill when I see they marked up a supposedly large bowl for $4 each and served a smaller bowl at regular price. It looks like they thought I was from out of town and tried to BAMBOOZLE me lol.  Receipt was scratched out too check the pictures  When asking about the bill I told the waitress I've been coming here for a long time and it's never been this much... she said more meat more rice lol.   Any die hard fan that's been here knows you always get the big size as the regular order. They don't even advertise anything different on the menu.",

    "text": "The food at Ichiza is great! I went on a Friday night and it was so crowded that we had to share a table with two other random groups. That was a unique experience in itself. Like mentioned in some of the other reviews, the menu is displayed across the walls creating a unique style for the restaurant.   What we ordered:   Appetizer:  -Beef tataki is very very rare beef , soaked in ponzu sauce ( a tangy, citrus-based sauce). This is definitely a dish you want to try if you like being adventurous or enjoy trying unique foods. The dish is served cold and has a lot of citrus flavor. This is definitely one of the best ways to prepare beef and is a must try.  Main Dishes:  - The Udon was good, but wasn't anything particularly special. It came with egg and shiitake mushroom. I recommend getting this if you don't feel like experimenting with any other foods. It's guaranteed to be good.  -Black cod in miso (butterfish) wasn't my favorite, but if you are a fan of it, you might enjoy it. It doesn't come with rice or anything else, so if you are hoping to eat it with some rice, you might need to order that separately. It is a little salty, so be prepared.  Dessert:  - Coffee Jello. This was a unique and delicious dessert unlike any I have tried before. The jello is served with a small amount of coffee to heighten the coffee taste and make more of an impact when you take your first bite. It is served with a thick whipped cream that tastes like it has to be homemade. Everything about this dessert is amazing, so definitely give it a try if you're a coffee lover.  -Honey toast. The honey toast was definitely the highlight of the meal. Not only is the portion huge (prepare to share unless you're really hungry!), but it is addicting! The combination of honey and vanilla ice cream is definitely a match made in heaven. The outside of the toast is cooked perfectly to add a little crunch to the soft center. It is roughly $8, but worth every penny in my opinion.   Overall I had a great experience at Ichiza and plan on going back there soon.",

    "text": "Las Vegas is a city filled to the brim with addictions of every kind, so why not an addiction to one of the very best places you can find in Vegas? Ichiza would gladly satiate my thirst for off-the-strip, reasonably priced dining.   It is located on the second floor of a strip mall in Chinatown, which is a small drive from the strip. Completely unassuming and unpretentious, Ichiza is an izakaya - complete with different types of seating - at the Japanese bar/counter, normal tables, and on tatami mats on raised ground.  I'm not going to name the 12+ dishes that my fellow diners and I ordered. That would be a little ridiculous. I will leave you with this piece of advice: order off the walls and off the menu. Get the waitress' or hostess' suggestions and go with them (unless you're a rather unadventurous eater). They have all the standard izakaya-type food here including one of my favorites - octopus balls.  And most importantly: order the Honey Toast for dessert. Do not forgo this step! This honey toast had all of my dining group a-flutter, and you can guarantee that it is one of their most popular dishes. A block of bread is hollowed out, toasted, slathered in honey (but not too much honey), and placed on a plate. Then a huge scoop of ice cream nestles itself inside of that sweet piece of toast. (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nPiTwWEFr-VsePew7Sjg?select=5MBjtf85537l3Q44V97BYA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nP...</a>) It tasted like pure heaven. If you do everything else wrong - order from the menu, actually order soda, etc. - at least do this one thing correctly. Order the honey toast. You'll thank me later.",

    "text": "if not my most favorite place.^^  Layout not a typical looking sushi styled restaurant, Ichiza is very authentic Japanese oriented.   menu items line every wall, the decor is all wood, the seating looks cramped, and there are two sets of seating for large parties in the back.   admittingly, this kind of arrangement can feel very overwhelming at first, but the atmosphere becomes upbeat and exciting once you sit down.^^  Service outstanding for the amount of customers they service.  i won't lie and say u that there's no waiting for food (it's crowded from 8p-1am), but the time is within reason and never too long.  the waitresses are friendly and cheerful and the VERY BUSY chefs actually find time to do special arrangements with your order if you buy large quantities of the same item.  Food this is an EXCELLANT place to go to if you want something UNIQUE.   something that will leave you with a lasting impression of exotic japanese cuisine.   not everything will agree with your palette, but the majority of the items are full of flavor and taste.!  they prepare all kinds of dishes in every method.   sushi, breaded meats, dim sum items, rice dishes, noodle dishes, tofu dishes, raw meats (fish/beef/octopus/etc)...  seared, steamed, fried.  the menu is ENORMOUS.!  Pricing the menu is well balanced in pricing.   MOST items can be had for $2-$4 allowing you to try a lot of the dishes without burning a hole in the wallet (like TAPAS).   additionally, you'll find yourself only spending around $14 on a main dish.  Closing i've lived in Vegas for 4 years.  there are a TON of places to eat, not to mention a TON of sushi digs.   but i find Ichiza 2-3 times a month because of the LOVE & JOY i've discovered eating there - and i hope you will too.^^*  Recommendation (excuse the spelling) 1. Beef Tataki (seared raw beef) 3x orders of 2. Beef Wagyu Carpaccio  3. Chicken Gizzard (bowl) 4x orders of 4. Diced Beef Cubes (ask to make it spicey) 5. Salmon Sashimi (fresh and CHUNKY) 5. HONEY TOAST - EVEN if you feel you can't eat anymore  let me know if you need any questions answered.  i think i must've earned a master's degree - i eat there so often.^^",

A smallish space, in a strip mall, in Las Vegas, next to a massage parlor does not sound like the makings of a positive dining experience. But not every gem is set upon a pedestal.  The selection is awesome. If you want to test your adventurous side you will be happy. If you're accompanied by a tame eater you can get them some tempura or teriyaki items. This place is great with squid. They have at least half a dozen variations, one of which should appeal to the squid-lover's pallet. They have a cheap blue collar beef tataki... great. Beef toungue skewers... great. A salad with salmon and salmon roe... fantastic! The whole grilled/broiled squid is just right... nothing fancy, just right.  They have so many selections it would take a thousand more words to do the menu justice. I'll leave it at this; wide selection, fun atmosphere, friendly service, good quality and great price. Give it a shot.",

It is always the highlight of my meal at Ichiza. Their black cod, ramen DX and their red snapper carpaccio are great too.  They also have a separate special menu that changes from day to day. I definitely recommend ordering from that menu. We usually just pick an imported fish that our server recommends and they have all been amazing so far (with amberjack being my favourite to date). We get it sashimi style, and the sushi chef plates it beautifully. You also get a lot of sashimi for the price you pay. They also deep fry the rest of the fish once you are finished with your sashimi so that you can try it in a different style! Love this place. So authentic and such great value!  I love the honey toast! The toasted edges and soft fluffy center is delicious. It's the sort of dessert I dream about before I go to bed. It's the perfect way to end the meal!",

    "text": "After being greatly disappointed by visit to Shibuya at the MGM Grand, I was wondering if I'd ever find a good sushi bar in Vegas. Then I found a great one.   Ichiza is located in the Asian section west of the Strip off Spring Mountain Rd, and has a casual, neighborhood feel. The large number of Japanese patronizing this restaurant was a confirmation that this might be a special experience for me and it was. This is the type of establishment that can inspire love for a cuisine. It is devoid of pretension, focused solely on providing delicious high-quality food at an extremely reasonable price.  This place is run by Japanese folks for Japanese folks and has a thoughtful menu with many daily specials. Cooked entrees are done traditionally and are on par with the best places I've eaten at in Japan. They know the difference between teriyaki and yakitori - most places you go to in the US think you just slap syrupy goo onto some chicken and stick it on a grill. At Ichiza, you can choose yakitori made with chicken, gizzards, livers and other tasty options. Grilled squid (ika) is a delight here, tender with a subtle coating of shoyu-based sauce.  Sushi and sashimi are just-out-of-the-ocean fresh and doled-out in generous portions (you gotta love that). Fish is treated with respect by the sushi masters here. I enjoyed my first \"tom yum\" roll here-a melding of tempura-fried shrimp, veggies, cilantro and chili sauce-and it was quite tasty! Noodle fans won't be disappointed either.  Service is friendly here, though a bit uneven. The servers sometimes get bogged down when the restaurant is crowded, though the kitchen seems more than capable of keeping up. The restaurant is open until 2-3 am daily so it's great for a late dinner after a show or a long night of gaming. It does get busy though so if you've a got a group, you'd be wise to make a reservation.   Prices are almost disgustly reasonable for sushi. I hate to use the word \"bargain\" because of the negative connotations. Let's just say that you can stuff yourself silly with unbelievably tasty food without emptying your wallet.  This is now a required stop on any tour of Las Vegas that I make. One of the best places for a Japanese food experience in the USA.",

This izakaya is serving up an endless (no seriously, 100+ items not on the menu line the walls here) combination of grilled and fried delicacies.  My group seemingly tried everything from traditional items like the yakitori & beef tongue skewers, pot stickers, cold ramen, beef bowl, to the more modern fare like the seafood quesadilla, and the deep fried zucchini w/ bacon and mozzerella cheese.  The more friends and fam you have to eat and drink with, the merrier, as my 4 cousins and I were able to shamelessly order dish after dish of great drunk munchies. And washing it all down with ice cold Kirin served on tap made this yelper one satisfied customer.  I'm a fan. You should be too.",

    "text": "Ichiza is one of the spots we we frequent when our family comes in from Japan.  I recommend calling in for reservations ahead of time if you have a large party because of limited seating. Remember if you get the 2 tables in the back you usually have a 2 hour max time slot.  We usually order a bunch of different dishes and just share...family style. It is an Izakaya...half bar-half restaurant. Many of the dishes are tapas style.  We've had better izakaya but the go to foods at Ichiza that we would recommend are (not necessarily in this order)  1.Grilled eggplant 2. Uni pon 3. Broiled Miso Cod 4.Yellowtail tartar 5. Robata-Pork belly in shiso leaf  6. Beef bowl 7. Ume Chazuke 8. Salmon Belly  People rave about Ichiza and I say they are ok. I've tried many of their \"to die for\" menu items but I wasn't wowed. I suppose we could give Ichiza a 4 star but its hard to. Maybe because we visit family in Japan a couple times a year, we set the bar high and our expectations are based on that. They are not as consistent as they once were with their food. The prices are decent, the service we've experienced is sub par right up until my wife speaks Japanese to them, and lately its been packed and very loud. Probably due to the fact that they don't do lunch service , anymore.  Don't get me wrong they are a good bang for your buck type of place. Just check out the other Yelpers, they love it. Don't take my word for it...go try them out. I'm sure you'll find someone thing delicious on their menu.  Aloha",

Tasty skewered meat (had both chicken and beef tongue, both tender and flavorful) The two disappointments are 1) the ramen DX, the broth is a milky white-ish broth but it doesnt taste like bone broth, and doesnt taste like miso either, the broth is just salty- it's hard to enjoy the ramen without strong flavorful broth 2) vegetable tempura rice bowl was ordered, while it's delicious, it comes with fried shrimp and octopus too. Wow good thing we're not vegetarian or this could be a disturbing fact- and when we told waitress it came with shrimp and octopus, and it also did not specify that in the menu- all she could say was I\"M SO SORRY. No offer of resolution of any kind.  So 1 star off for mediocre service and 1 star off for the ramen mystery broth.",

Located in Chinatown, the place was packed and filled with a mixed crowd of young and old. The walls were filled with their specials that were all fairly priced. Our party of four ordered a gamut of dishes to share including sashimi, sushi dishes, karaage chicken, pork cutlet (that's supposed to have bacon in it?), squid, chicken gizzard, beef tongue, beef donburi and of course, the honey toast for dessert. The staff were attentive and the food came out pretty quick.   I would recommend this place to my other Hawaii visitors who enjoy ikazaya-style dining. Just be prepared to wait a while - ours was over an hour so we just went downstairs to sing some karaoke and enjoy some soju to kill time.",

They have menus on the wall as well as the menus that they hand out to you when you are being seated. The ambiance is great with the busy-ness of the waitresses seating people and taking orders, to the cooks  clanging kitchen utensils as they are preparing your next meal, the loud chattering of the people. Sounds like music to my ears.   This is one the first places that my husband had taken me out when we were dating. (awwee! :-) ). Since, I am a big fan of sashimi I always start out with the tofu salad with tuna sashimi. This is a great dish!  and a large order of their sashimi platter. My husband orders half a bowl of ramen with vegetables. We normally finish off our meal with sapporro and for desert honey toast.",

Also had their ramen - can't say there was much flavor going on there.  I like having a bunch of veggies and such in my ramen but the broth needs actual taste.  They should poach one of those dudes from Monta so he can show them how it's done.  Didn't get anything else but looked around and none of the food looked too impressive.  Their menu is huge which, considering how small the kitchen is, is not a good sign for the quality.  But you gotta love Las Vegas for having even decent Japanese food open so late.    But there's tons of better Japanese places if you go during normal hours.  Ichiza should be far down on the list in my opinion.",

However, the customer service at this place was horrible and I hope it just happened to be on this night that I went. This place usually has a long wait so that was not the issue. The issue was that when it was finally time for us to get seated, the hostess accidentally seated a couple that came just 2 min prior. She realized what happened but did not apologize or try to seat us. Instead, we waited DOUBLE the time. (Should've left by then, but we felt already committed.) When we were finally seated, we were ignored for almost 10 min and had to ask for help twice. They got my order wrong and it took forever to correct. Finally at the end, the waitress took forever to check us out. Basically, they need more staff during the busy nights..",

Out of the abundance of reviews, I'm not sure if I add anything that hasn't already been noted. But, hey, I like to read my own reviews;]  First: The atmosphere I love the atmosphere here, this is how I imagine somewhere in Asia to be (I said imagine!). It's loud and you share tables with strangers, food overtaking tables, hand-made \"menu of the day\" as wall-paper. The waitresses are on it, glasses never empty!  Second: The food I order here like I order for a tapas restaurant: order about 1 dish per person or more and allow for sharing.   Good things I've had: Beef tongue stew Beef tongue (beef tongue wasn't my idea, I was scared, but I am a fan now) Wasabi Octopus (yum yum yum) Chicken Bowl (boring, but yeah, it was good... HUGE too) Sweet Crab Wraps  Our grand total for my last visit, which was about 4 dishes, our quick dine was about $28 for 3. No complaints:]  Haven't had a lot from here, and I obviously need to be back. So, if you're coming back, and you want to share the said to be amazing Honey Toast with me, let me know.",

Sitting at the bar is equally appealing as the pace of the kitchen will surely keep you entertained the whole night.  Avoid the fried stuff because the batter is not well seasoned. I feel that the fish could be fresher but this is Las Vegas so I can't blame.   My next visit here I would order: Tofu salad, fresh Udon, and Honey Toast.",

We ordered salmon skin salad, wasabi octopus, Red Snapper Carpacci, chicken gizzard skewer, and beef tongue skewer.  The wasabi octopus is raw and it gets worse tasting after a while.  I loved the beef tongue skewer.  It was warm and the outside was a bit crunchy. We also ordered the honey toast.  There was nothing special about the honey toast.  It was normal.  The honey was sweeter than normal, though.",

The food was okay, but I have had better from other izakaya places in the OC, like Honda-ya or Shinsengumi. The service was bad, the couple that came in 15 minutes after my husband and I had placed our order actually got their food before us. And they messed up our order too. We were served the wrong ramen and our server kept looking at her colleagues at the counter to see if she should be serving us our spider roll. And she kept putting down the plate and picking up the plate. THRICE. -_-  When we asked for the bill, I noticed that someone had tried to add a spider roll to our order, but it was canceled before the bill was given to us. And that was when the spider roll was the first item on a two item order.  So never again Ichiza. You guys messed up!",

    "text": "pros...well before i forget about ichiza in Las Vegas, i must yelp it.  went here last year for thanksgiving weekend.  first time and it was so fun.  it is a packed and happening place for japanese bar food, or izakaya.  i just love that there are hand written notes on specials all over the place.  some in english, some in japanese and some in both.  and each section has a different special, i don't think i saw the same one twice.  so you have to look around the whole restaurant to make sure you don't miss anything.    the wait was good, even for it being thanksgiving weekend.  we waited just about 20 minutes, which was pretty good, as they told us it would be more like 30 minutes.  we got seated and once we ordered, the food was arriving about 10 minutes later.  i can say that everything we had was good.  i loved the spicy sushi roll, and we also had very delicious bacon wrapped asparagus.  i had some curry and it was just the right thing for that cold night.    cons...crowded, if you are closterfobic than this is one good place to avoid.  or perhaps you can get your food to go?  well the bathroom was not so clean and looked a bit run down as well.  but it worked.  and the building it is in, is reminscent of ones found in china and korea.  those steps are like a foot high and 6 inches deep, the worst of both worlds.  and there are like 9000 steps to get to the second floor.  and parking, wow, that's another crazy part, not enough for this building at all.  i felt that i had to joust for a parking space, luckily for me i had a rental van with walk away insurance.  go ahead hit me, i don't care.",

The environment is mediocre, but for Chinatown, it is fine. It always seems to be busy so maybe I'm just nitpicking?  And then upon hearing that Ichiza (for the 3rd time since I can remember) had been shutdown for health code violations, it hit me: The staff does not give a ish about anything!   There seems to be a lack of care by the staff and owners on the upkeep of Ichiza. Everything seems to be half-heartedly done. The food does not look or taste fresh and the restaurant needs to be maintained better. I heard they finally remade their menus, which is a sigh of relief. They used to have these mangled pieces of paper covered in laminate that was peeling apart. Classy.  I suppose if you're looking for a cheap eat, stop by. If you're looking for a dining experience or great tasting food, pass. I've seen McDonalds employees more enthusiastic and prideful about their craft.",

As more people found out about this place, you see half o the restaurant is filled with westerners. Unless you go early (before 6), you definitely need to make a reverberation or you will see a line a people waiting outside.     Besides their regular menu, they have additional items on the wall throughout the restaurant. I've tried a lot of the items off the wall, but my favorites are still the regular menu items.  - Ramen DX: delicious ramen broth with a big chunk of fatty pork! - Agedeshi Tofu: lightly breaded fried tofu in broth - Miso Mackerel: this is the best miso fish i've had.  - Honey Toast: Vanilla ice cream in a toasted Texas-toast drizzled w/ honey.  and did i mention you can get Japanese beer on tap here? and by the pitcher!",

Love the fact this place is like those hole-in-the-wall joints you'd find in Japan with Japanese writings and menu items plastered all over their walls.   Had lots of good dishes here: Miso Butterfish, Beef Tataki, Tofu Salad with Tuna Sashima, Yellowtail Tartar, Honey Toast.. Highly recommend their tapas. I'd probably skip the beef bowl and shrimp fried rice, those can be too filling and taste was pretty generic. Can't wait to go back and try more tapas and yakitori!

One time I came here the hostess actually skipped over our names on the waiting list and we ended up waiting for 2 hours!

Unfortunately, I'm a broke college student that can't afford to just try everything on the menu but in my opinion I've had quite a decent variety of the items offered on Ichiza's menu. Things like their DX ramen and beef bowl, their cheese stuffed chicken katsu and dice cut steak with ponzu sauce, and of course their HONEY TOAST!  Of course, like any good Izakaya, they have their specialty items plastered all over the restaurant so you kind of have to walk around to find the real gems that Ichiza has to offer and sometimes it gets difficult considering the signs are wearing off and they're getting pretty difficult to read.. (hence the missing star)  For an outsider, this place is less 5 minutes off the strip driving so I say if you couldn't drive here.. You were just making up excuses.

But alas, we left disheartened and unsatisfied, craving the izakaya we know and love back home in LA.   There's absolutely no wait at 11pm on a Tuesday night. We had a difficult time ordering, because the menu that they handed is, well, not really the menu! All the special items that you want to order is posted on the wall. So if you have poor vision like I do, you're kinda of screwed! Or you can walk around the entire restaurant staring at the walls...  The only thing i would go back for is the TAR TAR YELLOWTAIL. It is heaven on a greasy little chip! It has generous chunks of yellowtail and avocado. AVOCADO!! nom nom! I would eat this any day twice a day!   RED SNAPPER CARPACCIO is kind of weird. The fish is sliced too thick and it was chewy. Comes with raw onions and salmon roe, which I am personally afraid of.   Our three little FRIED SMELTS were also a winner for me. Nice, simple, delicious. I am a huuuuuuuge fan of cooked fish eggs, and these guys are 3/4 eggs! Bf, however, took a bite, made a face, and refused to eat any more.   SOFT SHELL CRAB was good. A good amount of fried crab. Wouldn't order it again, but I do recommend trying it!  The GRILLED MARINATED MAKEREL was disgusting. The salty miso taste (from the marinade) + the fishy makerel taste + the charred grill taste = no bueno.   We tried the BEEF TONGUE SKEWER and the CHICKEN WING SKEWER and decided we'd order more if we liked it. The beef tongue wasn't bad, though more chewy than tender. The chicken wings were disappointing; it came with two tiny ones, and the flavor was nothing to write home about. Did not end up ordering more.   We also ordered a roll off the wall that was pretty good. EEL KAKIAGE TEMPURA ROLL (4pc). I'm not sure what vegetables were fried in the kakiage, but that's what made the roll special and gave it that nice crunch. The roll is TINY compared to the huge portion of eel and tempura on top of it!!   My bf told me to give this place only 1 star, we left that unhappy. I do think it deserves more because it had a couple awesome dishes. If I came and ordered 5 plates of tar tar yellowtail, I would give the place an A+. But overall, the bad out-shined the good.",

The people I was with are more adventurous in seafood and still didn't like their stuff much. I just really wanted good sushi rolls, so if you want that, do not come here.   FOOD: Spider Roll (2 stars): Really dry, really plain.   Tar Tar Roll (3 stars): It was like a sushi tostada. Pretty good, or just better than the spider roll.    Eel roll (3 stars): Probably the best roll out of the 3 I tried. Flavorful, not dry. Just not very healthy because of the fried stuff on top.   Black cod fish (4 stars): Perfectly cooked. Best thing I had here.   SERVICE (2 stars): Didn't get menus, chopsticks, or plates until we asked for them. It's also really hot inside, hotter than outside, and this is Las Vegas in the summer we're talking about! It also smelled inside. We had a big group so we got one of the back tables where you need to take your shoes off to sit down...probably why the place smelled.  Who knows what's on peoples feet..gross!  Overall, not a place for rolls. I really didn't like any of them that much, just ate cause I was hungry. Stick to entrees maybe? Well maybe not since the other people in my group who all got different entrees weren't impressed at all either.",

    "text": "THE HONEY TOAST WAS ALRGHT. Nothing special.  I came here one evening with a group of 5 and we setup shop on a corner table. I've heard a lot great things about Ichiza and some bad so I going in with very high expectation, at the end I was left satisfied but not blown away. I'm still debating if it's a 3 or 4 stars.  So you come in and you have the option of dining at the a table, at the bar, or I think on the floor, you know taking off your footwear and dining at one of those low tables barefooted, I may have seen it walking by but not 100% but I do remember that weird smell.  It was packed and the guy behind me kept bumping my chair. When you order there's that typical menu you look at given by the waitress and then there's all of these cards on the walls, all written in Japanese and majority with their English translation, as long as you have good vision and can read some bad handwriting you should be fine.  There was a group of them in a today's special section, so I'd just say start with that and go down the list.   My new phone's camera, which I literally only had for 2 days, kind of crapped out and I only took a few photos. Plus I don't know about you but I still feel weird about whipping out the camera and taking a pic unless someone else is doing it, everyone on my table were doing it I should've stole their pics but non-yelpers.  The pitchers of beer that they serve might be missing a pint or so because there's a pint size thing at the bottom of the pitcher possibly to keep the beer cool. We may have had more beer than food, maybe.  I started with the Fried Salmon and Mozzarella <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ichiza-las-vegas?select=Y8RmZH-iYlGQAybrDbSafA#Y8RmZH-iYlGQAybrDbSafA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/ichi...</a> it was one of the items on the cards that stood out, plus it was on a card that was right in front of my face on the wall. I liked it a little different but I liked it.  It was a stick of mozzarella wrapped with some slices of salmon, battered up and fried, cut into wedged pieces and served on a little salad.   Also had the karaage chicken <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ichiza-las-vegas?select=IFH4iSxW3hIaxhBMkDZEhQ#IFH4iSxW3hIaxhBMkDZEhQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/ichi...</a> it was alright not as good as others I've had but enjoyable. It was more crispy and crunchy than meaty and it came with a some shredded cabbage, some sauce, and lemon I would've preferred lime here, as if there was a difference haha and more sauce.  The squid <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ichiza-las-vegas?select=PH4fkZfPGjVDCA6OtRKBOw#PH4fkZfPGjVDCA6OtRKBOw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/ichi...</a> was alright but pretty tiny compared to the other pics. We had the miso butterfish, it was good and I liked it. Only thing about it was that it's not a good thing to share with chop sticks, you can't cut the skin with chop sticks and the skin is the best part. Good thing I took all of it.   Clearly a group a five can put away more food than what I just mentioned but these are just some of the items I can remember. There were skewers, raw fish, soups, and so on ordered, a good portion of their menu,  but nothing really blow me away.  Even the famous honey toast was just OK borderline MEH.  The service was excellent, we had no problems and they were friendly and did everything they were suppose to do. In environment was good.  I would go back, maybe they'll make me up the rating.",

    "text": "Sooo .. why is this place so popular and over hyped? Maybe I'm a bit biased. I'm not really a tapas person but I do like Japanese food. My friends and I were in a group of 5 and we decided to come on a Saturday night. The wait actually wasn't bad, we went around 8:00PM? And we were seating in maybe 20 minutes?   Now, when I went there, I was surprised at how packed it was. There were a lot of people, which is a very good sign. It must mean their food is fan-fucking-tabulous, right?! RIGHT! They gave us a menu, but why do they even need to spend money on menus? They have menus all over the wall. I wish I had done more research cause then I would've brought my glasses with me.   Oh, no, they don't a set of menus that repeat on the walls. Everything that they paste on the walls are completely different. To my right, behind me, and in front of me were all different items. Too bad I can't read any of the ones that were in front of me. I was sitting in their \"fake\" tatami mat style tables so facing me was the bar, and on top of the bar was where half of their menu was posted. I fully realize that this is not uncommon but squinting is not how I want to begin my night even though I'm Asian.   Anyways, between my friends and I, we ordered the following:  Tataki: Almost rare beef slices that were seared. It had good flavor. Though, I could do without the ponzu sauce. Not bad.  Yellowtail Tartar: Pretty good. Though it can get kinda messy once you start eating it. Not bad.  Jalapeno Fried Rice: Has potential to be better. It didn't have much flavor. Also, I think it's because when I think jalapeno, I think spicy and this dish was not spicy at all. I even ate the slices of jalapeno and .. well, nothing happened. They actually had a spoonful of siracha on the the rice for you to mix it in with but ... uhm, why? Shouldn't jalapeno be enough? Though this does give me an idea to try to make this dish at home ;)  Garlic Chicken Gizzards: Possibly the best dish I had at this establishment. Though I'm not sure bugger sized pieces quenches my .. cravings for it. But it has great flavor to it. Thumbs up.  Kimchi Fried Rice: Nothing really spectacular about it.  Buttered Clams: Uh .. I think I prefer a black bean sauce to go with my sauteed clams versus this. It wasn't that eye opening. It was just like, \"Oh so this is it.\"  Beef Tongue Skewers: It took them a while to get this out to us. It was good though. Nice and tender ... however, the other skewer that my friend had -- she said it wasn't that tender. It was actually tough for her. So .. inconsistent quality.   Grilled Whole Squid: So, they actually forgot about this item. They forgot to input this order. When all the other foods were finished, we all just sat there waiting for this dish -- which took FOREVER to get out. It wasn't good either. It was kind of fried on certain ends. We're not so sure their fire on their grill is quite balanced.   I had wanted to try their honey toast but one of my friends said it was nothing special and over hyped. I trusted his judgement and decided not to bother.   SO. It's average. It did not tickle my taste buds. Sorries.",

    "text": "So I've been wanting to try Ichiza for the longest time. It was girls night so I suggested we go to Ichiza. The lady told me that we needed at least 3 people in our party to make a reservation but luckily I had a party of 4. The parking lot stinks but if you can get parking then it works out. We ended up rushing upstairs as we were running a little late.   The verdict. The food was ok. I don't really recall anything that stood out to me that said OMG you have to come back! Now that I look back I don't really remember what I ate except for the fact that I took pictures. I remember the uni being decent and the Wagyu carpaccio as well. We had ordered a lot of food and I felt everything was just mediocre. Maybe I went on an off day but it was a Friday night and people were waiting regardless of the fact that there were open tables. The menu is all over the place so that was a bit annoying. One wall had specials and then another had more specials. For those sitting by the window it is tough to see these specials and you just felt rude walking to someone else's table to look at the writing on the wall.   Overall I thought that the honey toast would save the night but it didn't. The green tea ice cream was good but the toast was so dry and I was like I'm never ordering honey toast again! Ichiza was a big let down and I hope that if I ever do come back again I won't be as disappointed.",

And goes excellent with the sushi. I also do the all you can eat. And i made the mistake of ordering way too much food, I got full so fast, and I told the woman I was sorry and if they need to fine me that I would gladly pay (I did leave so much leftover). She only charged me $3 for my excess. I expected like $10-$15 maybe. I also made a huge mess and spilled my sake and they helped me clean it and we're so nice. Maybe they feel bad for the drunken lonely girl eating sushi late night LOL   They're so nice here and have AMAZING service. And the food couldn't be better. I get the baked rolls, with cream cheese and all the Americanized rolls lol. I love it and this is my favorite place. Great prices!!! Love Ichiza! And they give you a stamp card for even better deals!",

    "text": "Ichiza is always a great late-night spot to fill your cravings or to just hang out after work with a beer and some skewers. Apparently, I'm not the only one who thinks that. As a result, Ichiza is always packed, especially in the later hours. Sometimes you won't have to wait or may have a short 5-10 minute wait if you're eating alone or in a party of two (that way you can sit at the bar) but if you require a table, the wait is usually at least 30 minutes or even more. Of course, their earlier hours are less crowded, but many of the menu items (such as skewers) are not available.  Ichiza has been around for years and they remain pretty consistent in terms of food and service. A few times, however, my orders were forgotten or took a ridiculously long time to arrive. It can get very busy with only a few waitresses so I can see why mistakes happen.  The vibe is very authentic and is a local hotspot. There are item names posted all over the walls in both Japanese and English and sometimes you just have to wing it and see what arrives at your table. My favorites are the beef tataki, skewers (chicken gizzard and liver), grilled squid, and the tuna and tofu salad. The beef bowl is also a nice and filling item if you're hungrier. There is always hot green tea, which I love, and sometimes a little mini appetizer depending on the day and what they have.  There are so many menu items to be had so you really just have to try it yourself. It's a fun and casual dining experience with guaranteed good food that has created so many regulars over the years, myself included.",

Maybe cause it was sooo freshh. Either way, I was thinking..\" Where has this been all my life!!??\" Favorite dish of the day.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ichiza-las-vegas?select=NTV1hC0Dt5ObQon9fBg9FA#j3Vy1CPwzDo_5UWFrnkKQg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/ichi...</a>  Spider Roll: Portions was kinda small for a spider roll.

    "text": "Came here around 9pm on a Friday night and the place was busy. We were offered either a small table or seats at the counter, and we took the counter seats which turned out to be the right choice since we had front row entertainment during the whole meal just watching the head chef expertly slicing fish filets and making all kinds of cool dishes. Asparagus wrapped w bacon came out first, and were very tasty. Nice and hearty, generous amount of bacon with good flavor but not quite overpowering the clean crisp of the asparagus. Takoyaki was good, served nice and hot and dressed with good quality slice of lettuce and pink ginger. Octopus inside was a tad tough but the flavor overall was delicious. Hotate rock was our favourite by far, so much that we ordered another two. The scallops are just barely seared but enough to bring a greater flavor than raw. Salmon was delicious. Squeeze a bit of lemon on them...mmmm wow, so good! Katsudon was excellent, a large portion with great tasting cutlet, onions and egg with a hint of sauce and just enough seaweed flavor. The pork was just slightly on the tough side, but I love this dish and overall this was a very good katsudon. Tom yum ramen was served in a very large bowl with lots of beef and noodles and a very tasty broth. If you just had this you wouldn't go hungry, unlike some other ramen bowls I've had at other places. Scallop and bluefin tuna sashimi w crab butter sauce was also delicious. The bluefin was soooo good. And we wished there was twice the crab butter sauce because it was so good too. The scallops were good but after the seared scallops wrapped in salmon we felt that last bit of flavor from barely searing them was missing. To finish it off we had the mini honey toast w red bean and berries. It was very good. They were out of vanilla ice cream so we had it with green tea ice cream which I usually don't love, but it wasn't as bitter as I've had at other places and the toast flavor and berries still made it a win. Service was attentive and wonderful throughout the entire meal (and we were there a good while), with our glasses never reaching empty and the dishes being served and cleared promptly and kindly. Several times we were helped unprompted by staff who weren't our main server and that's always a sign of well trained service staff, so I really liked that. Our experience was awesome and I wouldn't hesitate to go back again when I'm in town.",

It's open super late which is great because I was able to meet with my sorority sisters when I got off my flight!   They specialize in small dishes, which is great cause it's like tapas. You get full off of many different dishes for a cheap price! The prices are all under $10 and typically range from $4-$7.   I ordered the tofu steak and pork belly, which was so delicious and filling. They have a great sauce for the pork belly and nice gravy for the tofu. It was presented nicely also!  The inside is small-ish and they have tables where you take your shoes off to eat. I love this little hangout spot and will return in the future when I am in town!",

It didn't get busy until we were close to leaving and that was after 7pm.  They had so many specials on boards around the restaurant. THEY DO NOT HAVE HAPPY HOUR but that's ok because the prices are comparable to other places that offer \"happy hour\" pricing.  The only thing about this place is the parking isn't that great. I drive a truck and the spaces are quite tight.. and there aren't that many, especially when it's a busy night. Good luck trying to find a spot. So go on a \"not peak\" day/night and enjoy the food... You'll definitely consider coming back!!",

This time though, we ordered their version of karaage chicken and gyoza. I wish I could tell you how it was but-my face was in the jalapeno fried rice! By the time I looked up-all the food was gone.  Best AFFORDABLE dining ever!  You've gotta try this place if you are in Vegas.",

The service was decent but they clearly forgot about our desserts as they started to get busier. There are a few items that they still do really well, but it's no longer on our crave list.",

I honestly can't even remember exactly what was ordered because they just ordered and ordered non-stop. I remember we had some skewers of different kinds of meat, sashimi, rolls, different kinds of fried fishes, soup, ramen.. etc.  The server was really nice and the food came out in a timely manner.

    "text": "Ichiza was the very first of many restaurants my group and I tried for our first group dinner in Vegas.  The restaurant is extremely cold, long sleeves are definitely recommended. Our group consisted of at least 13+ people and being a walk-in group made it a bit more difficult for the servers to accommodate us. Even though we had a huge table, the service was slowwwww. Half of our group arrived (roughly 7) and it took us about 20 minutes to get water. There was about 3 other tables with 2-4 people and roughly 3 servers. Near the end when we needed our checks, that took about another 20. Not very tentative, therefore I have to take off a star. Majority of the chairs had no backrest or was just a cushion for you to sit on. The design of the store was unique in its own way.  What caught my eye was how their menu was presented on the wall! Low-quality pictures unfortunately, but you're able to get a gist of what you're ordering. The prices of Ichiza is very fair! Tasting new restaurants around Vegas during my trip, gave me a grasp of the prices around the city. Of course, Ichiza is located in Chinatown and majority of the cost of food were fairly reasonable.  My meal was the Ramen DX and their seasonal special, scallops & tuna w/ special butter sauce. Both dishes were roughly 11-12$ per. The ramen was tasty, but nothing that blew my mind away. I only got the ramen because the restaurant is extremely cold and it hit the spot! I requested the scallops and tuna to have its sauce on the side. The scallops and tuna tasted fresh and full of flavor without any sauces. JUST RAW! I'm glad I requested sauce on side. The butter sauce completely throws off the flavors of the seafood and takes a complete 180 on umami scale. This specialty dish completely shook me on how great it tasted, props!  Overall, the food tasted great and worth the price! The service was under par and could be improved, but it doesn't discredit the food. Would definitely come back to eat someday to try different rice dishes! Thanks!",

    "text": "When its past midnight and you're in for a craving of a hearty meal that reminds you of home (but also because you are a Vamp), you go to Ichiza. At first, you wonder why there's so many kanji and kana filling the walls with menu items and semi-prices, but I guess that's a style they haven't outgrown since years ago. Do take note that not everything is on the menu, so you'll be looking at every nook and crevice of each wall or bar area for off-menu items, especially the special ones that have salmon belly in it.  Honestly, after how many years, all it took was watching one food anime and reminiscing my childhood in Japan to take me here.   Why is that? Because they have ochazuke. And mapo tofu (completely irrelvant from the previous, but I am biased and had hunger pangs of mapo tofu that day - don't judge me - actually please do because IDGAF).   The ochazuke is a dish that is very light and comforting. It is meant to keep you refreshed enough and fills you up at 80% capacity in comfortable fashion, but not to the point of feeling inundated. It contains a bowl of steamed nori rice filled with green tea (I think typically use normal green tea here, although I wish they had genmaicha for a roasty aftertaste) submerged simple savory ingredients such as salmon, pickled greens, and/or plum. The green tea and rice were well received by my taste buds and immediately comforted my nostalgic homesickness. Ochazuke is definitely a perfect quick meal to ease your hunger as well.  As for the mapo tofu, Ichiza's Japanese version of it would be exactly how I imagined it to be:  satisfyingly flavorful but less spicy than the Sichuan-style mapo tofu that I would usually opt for had it been a different establishment. I assume that since its more of a mild touch it would consist of silken tofu, ground pork/beef, miso, mirin, chili and sesame oil. I'm not sure if they would add soy sauce, or oyster sauce in the mix but that could be common for this particular dish too. It definitely doesn't give you the numbing sensation like traditional mapo tofu so be aware if you wanted something with a heavier kick! The dish itself is also quite easy to share among two people as well especially since its mild so if your friends are sensitive to spicy foods this would be a safe option for them.   The seating arrangements here are a little haphazard - you either choose to sit at the bar area with the open kitchen, a huge table that shares with other guests, the split booth/table, or the table that allows you to take off your shoes and sit seiza-style on a pillow. This could be a little troublesome on extremely busy days but thankfully most late nights they don't seem to be overwhelmingly busy at the last hour.  Also take note that this is one of few places still open late at night even during the holidays! PS. Some nights they have beef curry in their daily specials menu~",

Uni served on a half hollowed out lemon. Buttery uni and great meld of flavors. My \"main course\" was \"3 kinds sashimi\". Mackerel, Tuna, and Albacore. It did not come with rice, but I asked for some and they brought it right away. One last note, there are menu items only on signs on the walls, be sure to look around!",

There aren't many pictures, a lot of it is on the walls in another language. But to me that's part of the fun and adventure. The waitresses will do their best to help you navigate the menu, what I did was just show pictures from the Yelp page of dishes that looked good.   We ended up with a few chicken skewers, gyoza, a beef dish with garlic and onion, ramen, yellowtail carpachio and of course the honey toast. Everything was delicious, but the beef dish and the honey toast were definitely super stars. This is definitely my new go to late night spot.",

Be warned, get there early or make a reservation for not sooner than two hours before you want to eat.  This place gets jammed.",

Went there on a busy night  and the place was buzzing with people and conversation, you kind of forget you are in LV. Basically everything on the menu is written on paper all over the walls, we just started ordering what sounded good and if we found something else later, we just ordered that too. The ramen is amazing! Also the jalapeno fried rice, beef tar tar, and pot stickers, among everything else, are very good. This is a great place to hang out and graze for a while. The only problem I had was we kept losing our waitress and ended up having two or three other girls serve us, not a huge deal but made it a little confusing for the other servers. The honey toast was not as wonderful as I expected, but still good.",

Yes, all the servers speak english. Yes, the menu they hand you is in english, but if you really want to give this place a go you have to order off the walls. I suppose you could wander about looking at the pictures posted with the congi description and price, then point, but... find someone who speaks japanese and buy them dinner. Its way easier, and they will like you for it. Great for large groups, but make a reservation.",

I'd say around 10-11pm it's less crowded which makes it easy to grab a table.  The food is simply delicious. I always get an assortment of their grilled items and their specials. You can never go wrong with their yellow tail tartare. I could kill 2 orders of that myself. Some other great items are their bacon wrapped mochi, The usual grilled items that I love are beef tongue skewers, chicken gizzard skewers, corn, garlic skewers. They have a huge selection of menu items all posted on their walls which all seem to be great. So if you're the adventurous type then give them a try, otherwise stick to the similarly delicious yet plain menu items.",

We tried most of recommended dishes: breaded calamari, breaded octopus, yellowtail tar tar, breaded quail eggs, braised pork belly, Kim Chi fried rice, beef tongue & chicken skewers, and miso black cod. We attempted to try their honey toast. There were no real \"wows\" in our meal. The best dishes were the cod, tar tar, and Kim chi fried rice.  As for the service, I was very unhappy since the beginning. We mentioned to the host that we were in a hurry and trying to get our friends to the airport. He insisted it will only be a 10 wait minute. Well we waited 20min. Once seated, our dishes were dirty. Even though there were 4 of us, only 3 plates, bowls, waters were served. Then lastly, we ordered the \"recommended\" dessert, honey toast. But after 10 minutes, we were starting to think they forgot and upon inquiring, we realized that they didn't even put in the order and it was going to take another 10-15 minutes to finish. I'm sorry but did we say we were in a hurry.   I like the idea of late dining options here, but I will definitely not be returning due to the poor service and mediocre dishes.",

    "text": "To avoid being chided, call at least two hours in advance and make a reservation. We called an hour in advance for a 630 dinner on a Friday and were scolded, but we'll take our punishment if it means getting delicious food.  Menu is overwhelming. make sure you check the list of 'most popular items' written in marker that's over the kitchen. I think I still missed a number of items that were on signs on the walls, but that just gives me reason to go back next time i'm in town.  And yes, the food was delicious. And plentiful. And completely haphazard as to what came when, but we'll take it. Some restaurants course things so that you have a specifically orchestrated experience -- this is not that kind of place. When the food is ready, it shows up at your table.  Between three of us, our food came in more or less this order: pork belly with egg, spinach salad (goma-ae), gingko nut skewer, vegetable roll, beef tataki, jalapeno fried rice, shishito pepper skewer, okra skewer, bacon-wrapped mochi, agedashi tofu, okonomiyaki. I ordered a yakitori skewer right at the end to try it, and then the famous honey toast.  Of that, I would order the pork belly, tataki, goma ae, gingko nuts again. Gingko nuts were just kind of novel and fun. Pork belly was perfectly unctuous with the creamy egg on the side and almost-but-not-quite-too-salty broth. Tataki was buttery and rich, with a nice portion size. The spinach was a nice balance to all the meaty richness I didn't try all of the vegetarian things. the fried rice had a good flavor, from what I hear,   the server was really great about trying to keep the vegetarians from accidentally straying to the meat side. we were able to order the okonomiyaki meat-free, and she steered us away from things with hidden shrimp paste and such.  all the food plus two alcoholic beverages came to 90 after tax and tip, and was totally worth it.",

There's usually a wait time depending on what time you go, and I've waited anytime from 20 minutes to an hour and a half. I do think it's worth it, since it's hard to find good food similar to what I had when I was in Japan.   I've had a variety of the dishes here. Here are some that I always get when I go: Salmon sashimi (very fresh), the agedashi tofu, chicken skewers, yaki onigiri. and the ramen. There are many others, but these are the ones on the top of my head.  While I love the simplicity of their honey toast, I do wish they would put more honey in it. Other then that, it's a really good to end the meal!",

Being a Filipino, meals aren't complete without a serving of rice and well, all of us in that table cleared the plate with the Kimchi Rice first. I had a grilled whole Mackerel all to myself which was cooked perfectly. The fish tasted fresh and the charred skin gave it the perfect crunch with a hint of bitterness and saltiness.  For dessert, the ever so popular Honey Toast.   I am an Ichiza virgin no more. I'm glad my boyfriend took me to that place. Can't wait to go back and have me some more of those Honey Toasts.",

    "text": "A part of me has an irrational distaste for Ichiza. Maybe it is the fact that they can only seat 60 people and it causes a bottleneck at the front door. The wait times can be unreasonable, but that does not detract from the food.   It has been almost three years since I have last had a chance to eat at Ichiza. Yet again, we came to see that they had almost been filled to capacity. 10 minutes later we were sat. Count it as a blessing if that is all you have to wait. The seats at the bar is perfect for two and would make for a great date spot. Although you might be inches away from the next patron, everyone is more wrapped up in their own conversation and lives. There is no need to feel self-conscious.   The buta-kimchi is similar to a spicy pork dish popular in Korea. Mixed with kimchi and served on a bed of finely shredded cabbage made for a light dish. The garlic chicken gizzard is so simple and that makes it that much better. Add a squeeze of lemon and you will roll up the lettuce garnish to eat it all. Check the specials board and print out because hidden gems are bound to make an appearance. Yesterday, they had a blue fin tuna mix with micro greens on top of half an avocado. DECADENCE! They were not done yet. Add a quail egg to it and call it a day. Don't forget to save room for dessert, because everyone needs a little honey toast in their lives. So many places try to make a name for themselves off this dish, but not many can match Ichiza. I am not a huge bread person; but butter it up, douse it in honey, and top it with ice cream and even I cannot say no.",

    "text": "Located in Chinatown off the strip, this place is a great find for good asian food.  I would recommend the ramen dx--with its pork belly, seaweed bits, bean sprouts, cabbage, bamboo shoots, and half an egg in yummy broth, it's a great cure for vegas-induced hangovers and vegetable cravings. It comes in half-size and full-size--if you're still recovering from the night before, the half-size is enough. If you're really hungry, get the full-size cuz it's huge.  Other good dishes that our party got: the beef tongue (first time I've ever tried it and it was less chewy than I expected with good flavor), jalapeno fried rice, beef tataki, and tuna tartar.   The presentation for everything is really nice and the servers are attentive. Our waters were constantly filled even though we had a big group.   Tip: Take some time to look over handwritten menu items taped to the wall because a lot of them are good and not included in the printed menu.",

Not too bad considering there was an awesome guy skateboard sailing through the parking lot and streets. So we finally got our table. Part of the menu is hung up or written on the on the walls. This was a different take on ordering but not at all my favorite. I felt awkward looking at the wall where people were sitting against. No sir, I'm not squinting at you!  We got a couple appetizers and #20 was my fav. But now to the dessert... talk about disappointment! My expectations were way too high. It was basically a few pieces of  toast with un-melted pieces of butter  (I took a bite of it  thinking it was ice cream... gross) drizzled with a ton of honey and plopped with a scoop of ice cream. The 1st bite left me scratching my head wondering how people think this is sooo good.  I normally give places a second try and order a different items but if I had to wait 45 mins again, sorry I'll pass.",

    "text": "BF and I ate BBQ beforehand so we weren't too hungry. Really izakaya isn't for dinner, per se but about snacking with drinks and good company.   We had 5 star Yelparazzi company so that is always worth a go (Elnino F, Andy T, Jieun L, Jieuns sister, and Sun).   I just wanted the Yellowtail tar tar which is some chopped yellowtail in a creamy sauce layered on a crisp with some lettuce and rice and another crisp and chicken gizzard skewers.  We got two desserts-  Soymilk mousse- it was more light a light custard than whipped up mousse and had some brown sugar syrup, peanut powder and jello on top. Simple and pretty decent.Pudding- it's not pudding but actually a custard flan. It was pretty rich, eggy and smooth. Not as sweet as how Filipinos would make it. The two desserts are very similar flavors, but the mousse is good for people who want a lighter dessert than the richer pudding.  I kinda took little tries of peoples stuff. Not bad at all. Only fail I think was the ramen- kinda stagnant broth...I wasn't feeling it.   I haven't been back  maybe more than a year for the main reason that it's always full and can't get in. I dont feel like waiting for food that I think is not worth a wait. Some items are pretty good, but because most I feel isn't good value, I can't really say it's more than A-OK. Luckily we had a reservation and it wasn't as jam packing on a Sunday as it is any other late night.  Service was good, I had a good time and what we had was good so for that I'll give it 4 stars. I just don't know if I buy into the fandom though.",

    "text": "There are three things I think make a restaurant awesome or not: 1- How good is their food? 2- How good is their service? 3- Is the place cool?  1- I love the food at Ichiza. It's so good! I can personally tell you that of all the food I've had at Ichiza, I've never been dissatisfied. I can recommend a few things to you that I love, that I hope you'll love too: Deep-fried California roll, Dragon roll, Tar-tar yellowtail, and beef tatake. Seriously, those things serve as the foundation for everything else. I always order that for me and my party, then we add other things on top of that to build a feast. Also, you should know that when they say something is spicy, it's not really too spicy. At least that's my opinion. Also, honey toast: honey toast is one of the best things I've ever had in my life. I don't think you can find a human on earth who could resist this.   2- The service here is pretty good. I don't think it's as good as some of the higher-end restaurants on the Strip, but it's still good. My water cup was never empty, they cleared things really quickly, and they were really good about answering all my lame questions. Plus, the girls who work there seem to get along well. I don't know if that factors into this, but I think it does. Also, the sushi chefs are cool guys. They mostly keep to themselves because they're so busy, but they're good about answering questions and stuff (even better if you share some sake with them!) and guiding you.   3- This place is awesome. I've been to a few places in Chinatown, and no place matches the environment here. From the girls who say goodbye and thanks in unison, to the menu plastered on the walls, to the fact that this place has young, awesome, fun clientele... this place owns. The atmosphere is just really geared toward a good time and good dining experience. Plus, the place closes at 4am! I think the kitchen closes at like 2:15am, but still. This place is popping up until that point. As a matter of fact, I think the cool kids get there at like 11pm.   I had a light dinner here with three other people the other night, and I can tell you that it was a deal: some rolls, sake, soda came out to $50. It was a value, but I've spent as much as $200 here when it's been a more party-like dinner. It's definitely a good deal, though. They don't offer an AYCE option, but it's fine.   Of all the sushi places I've been to either in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, or San Diego, Ichiza is up there. The only place in Vegas where I think the food MIGHT be better is Yama Sushi.  All in all, I can't say enough good things about this place. I really think you should check it out, and let me know so we can meet there and do an impromptu Yelp! thing, yeah?",

There is often a long wait, which should be indicative of a good business; additionally lots of japanese and other asian people eat here. Also signs of good food.   The Tuna tartar is very good, although can be a bit hard to eat on the large chips. The beef tataki is fantastic. Soups, salads and sides are all quite tasty. Lastly they even have decent rolls and sushi. Sake and drinks can be a little pricey, but no more than any other restaurant. Oh and the honey toast is as good as just about everyone says. It was fantastic, not a negative thing to say about it. Very simple and delicious. All of the food we've had here was exceptional.  The atmosphere is also very warm and enjoyable. Everyone seems to always have a good time. They are open late and on most holidays which is a huge bonus. My girlfriend and I enjoy coming here and will continue to do so.  Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Do you have that \"one restaurant\" where you can call your second kitchen? Where, whenever you have friends flying into town and they ask \"hey, do you have any suggestions where we should eat?\" it's the first one you suggest? Well, Ichiza is that restaurant for me. I've been coming here for about two years now, and I only wished I knew about it sooner! The waitresses and manager are always so welcoming! The kitchen is a well-oiled machine operating very efficiently. The atmosphere and decor has a great vibe and along with the incoherent chatters from other guests, adds that sense of having dinner with your entire family. Well, on that note, if you are planning to go, let's say around 7 PM with a party of more than 4, it is best to call in for a reservation (2 hours in advance, if my memory serves me right).  Now, onto the food (yay!!). I am a creature of habit, so after trying xxxx amount of their dishes (or Japanese tapas as I find myself explaining to what type of food they serve, almost everyone thinks it's a \"sushi\" restaurant), I have my \"core\" menu:           \"Tatsuta-age\" - delicious fried chicken. The citrus soy sauce sauce               complements the chicken            \"Yellow-tail tartar\" - a must try! If you do decide to order this, try to take a a full                           bite, so that you will experience this dish as it was intended to be            \"Miso black cod\" - buttery soft and simply put, just so darn tasty!            \"Crab fried rice\" - I don't think any description is needed for this one  and with my adventurous side, I try one new thing on the menu. Since this is like tapas, I suggest bringing a at least a group of 4, that way, you can try as many \"tapas\" as you can! You can't go wrong with any on the menu and I have not brought anyone that left unsatisfied or unhappy with Ichiza. If you are flying in late, and you want a late night grub? Get off the strip and try Ichiza and you will not leave disappointed or blow your \"Vegas budget\"!!   P.S. if you can leave room for dessert, try the honey toast!",

Plus it's located in \"Chinatown\" which I soon came to realize is really more of an \"Asian-town.\" My worries eased though as soon as I walked in and saw the walls plastered with their specials, all written in Japanese. They give you a menu, but there are probably 300% more choices written on the walls - everything from curry rice to squid to spicy fried chicken.  The 3 of us split about 5 to 6 dishes and everything was awesome. We had udon, yaki onigiri (toasted rice balls), potato/bacon, bacon wrapped tonkatsu and mochi with eggplant and karaage. My favorite dish of the night though was the fried squid legs with this awesome dressing. There are so many choices I would have to come back a hundred times to try everything  We got here before 5 PM on Christmas day and it was PACKED! Is it like this every day? Despite not having a reservation, the staff was very accommodating although we did have to move tables once. Oh well, a small price to pay for such delicious food. Seriously, it will make you forget all about those Vegas buffets!",

Yes, sometimes it gets a little packed and you wait for more than an hour for a table.  But I've learned a few things here and there.   Rule#1: ALWAYS CALL to see if they're busy, and then reserve a table.    Here's a list of what I always order:  - Kimchi Fried Rice - Tar Tar Yellowtail (it's a hit or miss, either you like it or you don't. Very tasty in my opinion.) - Stir Fried Pork Udon - Beef Tongue Stew - Maguro Tataki  - Buta Kimchi  I really don't know what authentic tastes like, but in my standards I say it's authentic LOL.  It's better if you eat with a group of friends, it's more a sharing type of deal because it gets really expensive if you're eating by yourself.  Oh also, always bring CASH because if you're eating with a big group they can only split the check 2 ways.",

    "text": "On our most recent Vegas trip, we came here for lunch twice in 3 days!  Amazing food, amazing value, and totally worth the cab ride or drive if you like Japanese food - it's just a 5-10 minute drive straight down Spring Mountain Rd.  Between our two meals, we had:  Agedashi tofu ($4.75) Buttered clams ($6.50) Half ramen with vegetables ($4.95)  Uni and ponzu served in a hollowed out lemon with cucumber ($6.50) Tofu salad with tuna sashimi ($8.50) Deep fried small prawns ($5) Salmon and ikura salad ($6.95) Boiled cold spinach with sesame sauce ($2.75)  Everything was amazing.  The food quality is outstanding, and the portions are larger than I expected.  The half ramen was a great choice, as it was delicious enough to make it worth the stomach space, but small enough that I could share it with Mom and still eat a bunch of other things.  It has a miso broth with a smoky pork taste, and comes loaded with green onion, menma, cabbage, wakame, and bean sprouts.  The sauces for the agedashi tofu and buttered clams were ridiculous - we had to order a bowl of white rice so we could eat it all.  My mom was ecstatic over the uni and ponzu, and I was impressed by the amount of ikura and salmon that $6.95 bought us.  This place is definitely unique - the specials are scrawled on paper rectangles and tacked onto the walls, so it's a little difficult to figure out what to order if it's your first time.  Luckily, we remembered a few things that we liked from last trip.  We also managed to avoid the busy dinner crowd by coming for late lunch on weekdays (around 2:30 or 3 pm).  It started to fill up around 4:30 pm.  The green tea was nice and dark, and during happy hour (2-5 pm), Kirin draft is $1.95.  Can't go wrong with that!  I will absolutely be back multiple times next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "We decided to go here because of the high review count as well as the quality of the reviews. The place was a bit busy and when we got there, an older gentleman said it will be a few minutes. We wait, and a couple with their child walks in, gets greeted by a girl and within 10 seconds, she sits the couple in an empty table. So we ask if they had reservations and she said is your name on the list and we said no since the older guy said it was just going to be a minute or so. The girl upfront then says the couple had a reservation, LOL I don't think they have a reservation system in place, the girl just said that so we wouldn't be upset that someone was sat before us . This was already kind of annoying but we decide to wait. We finally get our seat at the bar area and we wait again for the server for what seemed like 10 minutes. We get our complete order in. The appetizers came super late, it actually came in at the same time as our main course. Actually one of our appetizer came in after we had already gotten our food which is another annoying thing. Then i realized they gave me the wrong order, i had asked for the Ramen Noodle soup that was on their special with soy based soup with egg and pork. They gave me the other ramen which i didnt want and i had to wait for another 5-10 minutes to get the correct one that i wanted. The ramen was ok, nothing to get excited about. Then once again, had to wait a considerable long time to pay for our food. This place just had bad service, maybe it was just our waiter but considering our overall experience, we were dissatisfied and would probably never come back.   Id probably go to another place that has better food and service, give Monta Ramen a try.",

Disclaimer: you're getting a white boy's take on an authentic Japanese restaurant.  In short, the food here is great if you can figure out what you're ordering and if you're able to communicate with the waitresses just ask them to suggest some items.  This place is a refreshing change from the standard Orange County / LA County Japanese fare.    If you're in Vegas for the weekend, if you're tired to crappy buffets filled with overweight midwesterners, and if you don't want to overpay at one of the new overrated restaurants on the strip, this place is a great option.",

I'm not sure how I wrangled myself a job that requires me to work until the wee hours of the morning (12:15 is wee hours for me--quit judging my Golden Girl sensibilities). But late night is okay when it means amazing ramen at Ichiza after work.  They only had one ramen left, but luckily my friend and I wanted each a half order. Yummmmm. I'm not sure what they do to their pork belly, but it is full of deliciousness. I think fairies sprinkle it with happy dust before they plop it in your bowl. It melts in your mouth with fairy dust deliciousness.  It's really tiny in here, only seating about 50-60 people, but it's well worth it...especially after you get done working and just want to unwind with a bowl of broth and noodles and bean sprouts.   Late night happens for me so infrequently, but Ichiza makes staying up past 10 p.m. worth it.",

    "text": "So, here we go. I feel like I should never write an review unless I've been to the place more than three times. And yes folks. I have been there more than three times.   This particular time was just as awesome as the previous were, except for one little hiccup. A very concerning one at that.   So what did I order you ask?   Takoyaki balls- Japanese Staple in my opinion meant to be searing as it enters your mouth. basically a dough ball filled with octopus. topped with neon red ginger and teriyaki sauce. So delicious. Lets face it it's hard to mess up this dish.   Beef Curry and rice with chicken cutlet - Warm hot rice mixed with some Japanese not too spicy but oh so hot curry. It is a taste sensation. The mix of an aromatic curry always gives me tingles in me's boy parts i gotta tell ya.   Sakana Pinchos - I should asked someone about the etymology about this one. For those not in the known etymology means study origin. Cus lets face it, Pinchos if ever been in the east coast either north or south means the Puerto Rican always good meat on a stick. Not a sushi roll sandwhich topped to sky with seafood goodness. Its 6 pieces two of each kind of sushi mountain goodness. the first is Masago ( fish eggs ) with spicy mayo on top of a a slice of squid on top of a large slice of tuna. On top of the rice. Out of breath yet ? I know I am...!  Keep in mind this is one sushi nigiri all held together by a toothpick! the Second kind is the Large Salmon fish eggs on top of mackrel on top of a miso leaf and rice. Talk about a problem in a mystery wrapped with an enigma... ! Finally is the third kind which is the Salmon eggs on top of steamed orange shrimp on top of tamago ( egg).   Are you tired yet? Salivating ? Both? Well keep reading cus I got more.  Finally the last thing was. the always yellowtail Tar Tar.   This thing is kind of a bore at times better left for those novice sushi or japanese eaters and one truth I would like to have kept hidden but Ichiza caught me in a clandestine mood and decided to go for it. Crunchy chilled yellowtail mixed some  yummy veggies. Go great with some beer.   I also had two Kirin Ichiban to drink it down with. I don't know what it was but all of this food and full tummy might almost make up for the large PILL BUG WALKING ACROSS THE BARTOP...!!!! Yes girlfriend , I went there. I was with the gf and as gentleman I covered it up with a napkin and but it escaped my clutches and went to the table space reserved for my very nervous female neighbors. It was a funny site to see. Which in retrospect made up for some of the incident. But what are you gonna do ?   The Service was nice. The waitresses did check on us frequently and I tipped them 15-20% as any normal upstanding patron would do. But man that owner. Someone's gotta do something about him. He made my gf wait out front before letting her sit down. And In I walk 5 mins later. This wasn't the first incident that something like this happened. When I was there before we were on the waiting list and they said 20 minutes nearly a half an hour ago. So I go up to him and ask and all he has to say is sorry sorry sorry but we called your name. Don't think so pal. Without letting me finish. Nope that won't do at all. So I let my grievance out. He politely listens and say sorry again as he shows us our table.   so, my star rating you ask ? 3/5   But other than that it's usually an ok time. my tab was around 50 dollars plus tip.",

    "text": "Hidden gem in Chinatown in a nondescript shopping mall next to the main Chinatown plaza. On my most recent trip to Vegas, I wanted to get off the strip to find more authentic/cheaper dining options. The main reason I came here was for the Honey Toast that everyone raves about.  We came on the Sunday or Memorial Day Weekend so I wasn't sure if they were going to be open.  I called the restaurant several times after 1:00 to see if they were open, but nobody picked up, so I decided to tempt my fate and catch a cab to Chinatown anyway. I got there 10 minutes before 2:00 (which is when they open for lunch) so decided to walk around the plaza for a little bit and come back when they officially opened. After 20 minutes or so , I came back with my husband and found the restaurant almost totally packed. We were lucky enough to get bench seating right in front of the kitchen.   The service was slow at times, and the waitress wasn't quick to replenish our drinks,  but the service was friendly regardless. The decor is simple--and the extreme opposite of the elaborate decor of  the restaurants on the strip. The bathroom is half restroom and half utility closet. Don't come expecting anything fabulous.   The Miso Cod was downright buttery and delicious. It's a decently sized piece of Cod filet cooked to perfection.   My husband got the Pork Udon Stir Fry which was good as well.  The thing I came for, the Honey Toast, is exactly what it sounds like...a big hunk of toast with honey drizzled all over it and two scoops of vanilla ice cream. Was it worth the drive to Chinatown, probably not...but I would drive for days for that Miso Cod for sure.",

Cool atmosphere, open really late, and seems pretty authentic. Just wish I could have tried more stuff.",

It was the first time for me and all of us. I knew going in that everything was small portion a la carte style. Honestly not use too that style but always good too mix things up in life. Lol!  They have just about everything you can imagine on the menu. Not even including the menu items that posted all around the walls even above the sushi bar. So little bit overload the first time looking at the menu then checking out the wall (some of the items has pictures of the item). We ordered few things off the menu and item off the wall.   The beef tongue was excellent, kim chee fried rice was good, the sashimi plate (they offered two different types) awesome (tuna, hamachi. mackerel), me the star was the beef tataki with ponzu sauce (raw beef thinly cut mixed with the ponzu dipping sauce, I could have order ten of those be content and happy), interesting things with mochi wrapped with bacon, and pork butt dish.   Talk about small place holds less then hundred people so you need some patience depending on time and day of week. They do take reservations two hours only two hours before if want or walk in hopefully not long wait. We waited maybe half hour not too bad. The parking not much around the building since lots of business in the same building. I had too park at regular Chinatown.  I had great experience and look forward too my next visit.",

If you're completely intoxicated and go here at three in the morning you'd give it 5 stars because everything tastes good at that time. Anyone that likes real 5 star Japanese cuisine knows better.  From the second you walk in, you get hit with the smell of raw onions and rotten eggs. We started with the oysters on the half shell--inedible. They only carry a gigantic type of oyster that clearly isn't meant to be eaten raw. They were like 5\" long and they didn't smell fresh.   Everything after that was a blur. I barely are anything because every dish either looked or smelled unappetizing. Every plate was sitting on top of or marinating in layers of raw onions. Eww eww eww. And I like onions but they take it TOOOO far!   If you're looking for authentic Japanese food that is worth the trip , don't go there.   Never again! I left hungry.",

This is a medium-sized restaurant in a strip mall about 10 minutes off the strip; atmosphere is cozy and accommodates well families, groups, and dinner dates.  Our service was prompt and courteous.  Menu is extensive, and numerous daily offerings are listed (off the menu) on the walls.  Food is Japanese tapas-style.  Our choices proved rather average; after trying 6-7 dishes, nothing in particular stood out.  Spicy tuna roll was decent, as was the beef tongue.  Best dish was the grilled octopus.  Prices are reasonable. There's a cute Korean bakery next door.  Overall, Ichiza is an OK place, though not an eatery to which I'd rush to return.",

    "text": "This place is good for trying a bit of everything of Japanese cuisine, especially since the pricing is good. I'd come here if you want to try experimenting with other types of Japanese food. Every Japanese restaurant has ramen or some sort of rice bowl. You come here to try the other side of Japanese food because most likely they'll have it somewhere on their menu. If you don't see it you can always ask them and see if they can make it- which is why I love this place.  When you come at night, the ambiance is very authentic to a japanese izakaya (which is like a tapas place). It's busy, it's loud, an all Japanese speaking staff, and then there's the overwhelming amount of menus all over the walls. It reminded me very much of Japan! (For the record, I used to live in Japan.) It's a fun place to bring your friends, drink a few beers, and order a little bit of everything.  Lunch time is my favorite time to come eat here. Service and the food is always good.  They even have lunch specials in which you get a choice between 2 chef choice meals or you can order a bento box type meal.  Service during busy weekend nights can be iffy. Sometimes can be inattentive but not always the case. Reason why I gave 4 star and not 5. If I could, I'd rate a solid 4.5  Recommendations: Daily specials are usually promising, Ramen Dx, yakisoba, honey toast, and if you're daring takowasa (raw octopus in wasabi)  Tips: -Make a reservation 2 hours beforehand - parking on the weekends is horrible, come early to your reservation  -sign up with them for their membership you get 5% every $20 purchase and when the stamp card is filled you get 10% every visit.",

It seems that unless you want to spend a ton of money most meals are just mediocre I found the same was True at Ichiza.  Walking in, I liked the atmosphere- busy, lots of locals, a little choatic, I was prepared to have a great meal after all the fantastic reviews.  The first two dishes we had- seaweed salad and garlic stir fried bok choy were probably the best things we ate all night.  They were simply prepared and the indgredients fresh.  We moved on to the broiled butterfish which was way too greasy to finish.  The sushi- which we were especially looking forward to is about the quality one would find in a NYC supermarket.  The avocado in my spider roll was browning and the crabmeat was not fresh.  The tuna and spinach roll was fine but the fish was nothing very memorable.  Maybe I've learned my lesson- youve gotta drop some cash to eat well in Vegas.  And steer clear of fish in a land locked state!  I would not go back and anyone who appreciates fresh fish and ingredients will stay away.",

    "text": "I've been looking forward to dining here for months. Ichiza has come highly recommended by several of my foodie friends. When we arrived, we were greeted with...actually...we weren't greeted at all. I was asked my name by a very rude host/manager and then told it would be about 15-20 minutes. Ok, fine. When our table was ready, our very cordial maitre'd (detect the sarcasm) literally pointed at my girlfriend and directed us to the bar. Also, we weren't asked if we'd prefer a table or the bar, but if we were, I would've asked for a table. Oh well...still forgivable at this point. The server promptly arrived and brought our drinks. When she asked if we were ready to order, I told her this was my first time here and was hoping to get some recommendations. She didn't seem to care. She acted like she was busy, but really she was just looking forward to going to the side area and talking with her coworkers...which was in plain sight to us. Very rude. We ordered the grilled squid, grilled salmon belly, some kind of ramen dish, beef tongue skewers, a spider roll, beef tataki and yellowfish tartar. The star was the salmon...juicy and moist, with a little side of grated daikon to cut the fat. Everything else was just mediocre. I was very curious about this \"honey toast\" that I kept seeing being brought out to other tables, so I asked our lovely server about it. She said, \"it's honey toast.\" and I replied, \"yes, but what exactly is it?\" and she said, \"it's huh-nee toast.\" Thanks..really cleared it up for me. She was incredibly rude about it...like I was putting her out to do her job. So, after about 15 minutes of waiting on our final dish, the yellowtail tartar (which is a cold dish, mind you and should certainly not have taken that long), our frustration led us to cancel the final order and get out of there. Bottom line: mediocre, over rated food and a staff that thinks their stuff don't stink because they're popular and busy. I'm sorry that all my reviews are about bad experiences. I'll try to be better about that.",

    "text": "A large amount of good reviews for this place, but we walked away questioning what was great about it.  This place isn't bad, but isn't a 4-star in my books.  They have a variety of food though, I'll definitely give that to them, I mean tons.  They have items to choose from all over their walls.  Also, items are cheap and you really cannot complain about the prices here.  I almost want to think of this place as small dishes, well sort of.  I recommend a bunch of people go so you can try the tons of dishes they offer.  The most memorable dish here was sliced pork belly, stir-fried with kimchi and sitting on a bed of shredded cabbage.  This was an excellent dish.  Pork had good amounts of fat on it, thinly sliced, and had a nice spice kick to your palette as well.  We also ordered the miso ramen which was decent, not the greatest.  To me, it was lacking a little flavor in the broth, but for $9.80, it's a huge bowl.  The noodles were good though and tons of other \"filler\" items going on, not to mention a tender piece of pork. I decided to try two skewers, beef tongue and jumbo chicken wings.  The beef tongue was good, couldn't complain.  However, their so-called jumbo wings were not jumbo and lacked flavor.  I was eating a plain grilled dinky chicken wing, I didn't even bother with the second one.  Also ordered the chicken-katsu which was heavily battered and crispy, but came out a tad dry, should have got the pork.  The last two items were ordinary and I was also not expecting much.  California roll and their salmon sashimi.  I have to say their salmon was fresh though, so don't hesitate here if you want to order this.  Oh, one last thing was the mochi ice cream, red bean all the way.  This place opened at 5:00 and was packed!  It's not a large place, maybe sits like 40 people.  We get here at 5:05 and it's half-full already, I don't understand.  Were people lined up outside?  With this, service wasn't there at all.  We had to pull our waitress over a few times to get their attention to order, refill our mugs with tea, etc.   It's almost they got slammed by customers and couldn't keep up.  The food service came out item-by-item, which was fine.  Towards the end of our meal though, I noticed a third waitress show up.  Overall, a decent place to get away from \"strip\" food and spend less money.  If you like variety, go here as again, tons to choose from.  Plus, it's not far at all, less than 10 mins from the Wynn, if that.",

First and best restaurant we saw was Ichiza on yelp.  It definitely lived up to our expectations.  The food was awesome, the service was great and the price was right.  Dinner for 4 cost 94 dollars and we were stuffed.   I think we tried 15 different dishes.  They have a pretty extensive standard menu, but posted all over the restaurant are small placards with new dishes to try, some of which we did try and were great.  If you are looking for Japanese food in Vegas, this is the place to go.  Hands down.",

I came here with a group of 12 and food came out pretty quickly and they were able to accommodate our decent sized party.  Pitchers of kept coming and we left pretty stuffed.

We tried things we normally don't get, like beef tongue.  Didn't try the sushi.  The ambiance was nice and a bit trendy without being intimidating.  Our meal for three came out to about $50 for about eight plates and one glass of house sake.  Oh, late night people note: They're open until 3 am (except on Sunday when they close at 2:30).  We'll be coming here for late night refuels next time we're in town.  I only wish they made copies of the \"wall specials\" so you can examine them at your table instead of standing behind someone to read the signs.",

Well I'm glad I did this time, otherwise, I would have seriously missed out on some great tapas style Japanese food. The ramen was amazing. One of the best that I've ever had in the US. I tried this tuna mochi thing that just melted in my mouth. I didn't even know there was tuna mochi. Did you? The moment I saw it I thought I must've been living in a food bubble all this time (even though my food bubble is probably way bigger than a lot others). I also wanted to try the uni mochi but it was sold out. I'm guessing that is a popular dish too. I can't ever dine at a Japanese restaurant without ordering salmon sashimi. OMG! It was divine. The fish just melted away in my mouth like butter. I love butter! The desert has fresh fish! I'm impressed. It even taste better than most of the salmon I had at some of the more popular Japanese restaurants in LA. If you ever go to Ichiza, you have to save room for the big block of honey toast dessert. I love bread! I love honey! It was my perfect dessert. Actually it would've even been better if I could've drizzled some condensed milk over it. I have to go back for more. I only had two bites of the toast. =)  I would stay away from the skewers though.",

    "text": "It was late at night my friend & I decided we need to fill up before concluding our trip. So we decided not to settle for the late night eateries in and around the casinos. I was skeptical about late night food. My friend asked me to drive a couple miles away from the stip which made me even more doubtful. Until we were surrounded by Asian territory which gave the restaurant a bit more positive ground. We reached the plaza and searched for Ichiza. It was hidden on the 2nd floor. There were a minimum of 4 restaurants at that place. I was very disappointed thinking how on earth would that place be better than the one downstairs why would people climb the extra stairs. Well, now I know why. Whilst inside you forget that you're in Amehika. Its a place where a Japanese person would head to for dinner straight after arriving from Japan. At least thats what I'd do if I'm Japanese.   03/15/10:  Here's what I had and would recommend since everything I had was great.  Beef Tongue. Tar Tar Yellow Tail Crab fried rice Black Cod Red Snapper Carpaccio (so-so) Sashimi Casadia Honey Toast (nice but too sweet, my friend liked)   I don't know the secret of this place but I hope it keeps its consistency. The chef who was doing his magic right infront of us while sitting on the bar has quite some talent. I wouldn't be surprised if he achieves what Nobu did. I should visit this place at least one more time before this happens.",

    "text": "It is difficult to explain in words what makes Ichiza so special.  When you walk in the doors of the small, upstairs restaurant, you immediately feel a sense that this restaurant is special.  If you ask any chef or cook in Las Vegas where they would go if you gave them an unlimited feeding spree, they would undoubtedly pick Ichiza.  Sure, you may get a better \"value\" by going to one of the overpriced places on the strip, but no where else could you receive the variety, quality, and uniqueness other than Ichiza.    The menu is astronomically large.  In fact, most of the menu is posted on the walls around the restaurant.  I have been to Ichiza well over 50 times, and I can honestly say I haven't tried most of the things on the menu itself, I get most of the dishes off the wall.  That's not to say I haven't had most of the things, because our table is usually filled with 10-15 different items at a time, and our palates are always interested in the new items Ichiza puts up.  Before going to Ichiza, there is something everyone should understand.  This is not a sushi restaurant.  Yes, Ichiza does have sushi.  They will make you basically anything you want.  But if you want to see 40 menu items that interchange random types of fish together in different ways that have no distinction from the other (much like most sushi restaurants), then this is not your place.  But, if you're looking for one of the best and most unique dining experiences you will ever have while trying new things, you should definitely go to Ichiza.  Ichiza is \"Izakaya\" style Japanese cuisine.  While it's hard to define Izakaya, the easiest way to understand it is to think of Japanese Tapas.  Small plates served in a family-style setting focusing on Japanese cuisine is what Ichiza is about.    If for some reason God (or whoever you believe in) came down and told you that you were not allowed to order more than one thing at Ichiza, you should, hands-down, order the Yellowtail Sashimi.  For $11.95, you get 5 thick slices of the best Yellowtail you will ever have served on fresh shiso leaf.  I'm not joking, this WILL be the best yellowtail you have ever had.  Unless you are literally a fish monger in Osaka, you will not find better yellowtail.   Other items that are musts at Ichiza: - Salmon sashimi -Pork wrapped in shiso leaf skewers -Kimchi Fried Rice -Ikayaki: Grilled squid served with ginger.  Simple, yet amazing.   -Beef Tongue Stew -Boiled Pork Belly -Ramen DX: Giant bowl of ramen with pork belly and egg.  Very tasty.   -Rare Organic Pork Steak: Lightly breaded pork, slightly seared and topped with Japanese eggplant.   - Skewers of: Garlic, Shishito Peppers, Chicken, Beef Tongue, Corn.   - Dice Cut Beef Steak: Sauteed beef cubes with garlic and shallots.   - Stir Fried Bacon Potato: Potatoes, bacon, corn, garlic, white wine, and stock sauteed together.  one of the least Japanese influenced dishes on the menu.   - Sake Marinated Salmon Collar - Miso-glazed Black Cod - Beef Tataki - Honey Toast:  YOU MUST GET THIS!  Freshly baked sweet bread loaf topped with honey, butter, and ice cream.  I have taken over 20 people to this place, all with different personalities, and EVERY one of them loves it.  If you don't like this dish, you should probably go get your head checked out because something wrong is happening inside of your brain.    The most expensive item on the menu is the Toro sashimi for around $18.  Other than the sashimi's, most of the items on the menu are between $2- $8.  The way to order is to start off ordering a lot of stuff, and eventually your table will be filled with lots of small plates.  It makes for a very social eating environment, and a very fun time.  Oh ya, and did I mention that it's open til 3 AM.  Go here... right now. I mean it, NOW!",

Came here around midnight and were starved for some good food. Considering the hour, it was pretty packed probably mostly locals since it is far from the strip.  I don't remember everything we ordered since it was so much.  Tried the gizzards, mochi wrapped with bacon, beef tongue, and some other delicious dishes.  Everything was on point and the sake complimented it very well.  Would definitely like to revisit this spot!",

    "text": "vacationing in the LV from the SJ (san jose), i just had to check this place out since it was my only chance to really try the place.  my family & i were driving to this place via gps & we were pleasantly surprised that... THERE'S AN ASIAN PLAZA IN LAS VEGAS!  wow.  haha.  my parents were noticing all the pho places around  & totally wanted to eat pho for lunch the next day (ah typical asian parents). btw this plaza is called chinatown plaza, but caters to all asian cultures since there are filipino, japanese, vietnamese, chinese, thai, malaysian, and korean restaurants there...  anyways on to the experience!  i entered and it was pretty empty at 7:00pm on a tuesday night, and i immediately felt like i was in japan.  there were tons of specials plastered all over the wall and over on top of the bar, it compliments the very traditional, homey, & cozy feel that this place exudes.   however, maybe it was just me & my terrible food choice syndrome, but none of the food really WOWed me.  my family & i shared the beef tataki, tofu & shrimp special, ramen dx, 3 beef tongue skewers, onigiri special variety & the salmon steak for dinner.  all the menu items were at about the same level of tastiness, which is pretty good, but nothing mind blowing.  for dessert we also shared a banana crepe & honey toast which i must say were yummy!  well you can't really mess up crepes, but the honey toast is a really unique dessert that you can't get anywhere else.  the toast is formed like a cube except there is no top part and in the center is topped with honey and vanilla ice cream. yum! just like french toast.  all in all, it's a good experience & the service was great, just the food didn't exceed my expectations",

I was with a group of 5, we ordered a ton of food, beer, and sake, just pointing to items on the wall at random, and the bill was totally reasonable (I think less than $40/person). Everything was fresh, delicious, and exquisitely prepared. The service was so-so, but who cares when your taste buds are dancing the Macarena on your tongue? The Hamachi collar was phenomenal, so was the red snapper carpaccio, and the honey toast. I can't remember everything we ordered, but nothing was disappointing. The much-touted bacon-wrapped mochi was good, but really just tastes like bacon (ain't nuthin' wrong with that, just sayin').",

They give you a small little menu, but their real menu is on pieces of paper handwritten with prices in English and Japanese, posted on the walls all over the restaurant.  If you're looking for a fine dining experience where the waitstaff holds your hand through the entire meal, you'll be a little lost in Ichiza.  Go ahead and walk around and look at the walls for things you'd like to order.  They're all pretty cheap.  The servers are attentive and friendly, and always keep your glass full, so don't worry about that.  I don't drink often and I'm almost always the driver, so I wasn't able to sample their sake and such, but we had the ramen, beef curry, and a red snapper dish, and all were excellent, though the ramen wasn't exactly the taste I was looking for.  A little soy sauce and spices perked it right up, though!  I recommend the beef curry, but this time was me playing it safe.  I'll be more adventurous next time, but in the meanwhile, I'll recommend this place.  Get comfy, it's not any fun if you're tense.",

Both were amazing, I came with a big group and every single person was 100% satisfied with their meal.  Generally when I think about Vegas food, I think about going to very lavish and expensive places for the absolute top tier in cuisine, but I will now add this spot to my places of \"must go\" every time I'm in town.",

I've never been disappointed by anything I've ordered here, the only thing that gets tricky is figuring out what to get since there's so many things (and all of it's on the wall.. the menu they give you doesn't show you everything). I think they should print a list of all the stuff on the wall to hand out rather than you trying to see what's available.  Some of the things I enjoy - my recommendation would be to order whatever sounds appealing and share with your friends: Beef Tataki - Rare slices of beef Hamachi tartare - mixed w/ avocado, and served on fried wonton wrappers Salmon skin salad - pretty large portion to get your daily dose of roughage Honey Toast - save room for this dessert!",

    "text": "I've been quite a few times since my first review. These is my highlight reel of the heavy hitting, ultra-delicious dishes I've been fortunate enough to sample.  * Salmon Sashimi - gorgeous, fresh fish presented with a small branch of basil blossoms to accent your soy sauce and the fish itself. Buttery, sweet and supple, the fish is glorious on it's own, but the basil blossoms (replete with cute explanation & funny faces from your waitress) take it to the next level. Oiishi!  * Deep Fried Soft-Shell Crab - I had a mini foodgasm after trying this. The crab is JUICY, popping and squirting all over the place as you attempt to dismantle the naughty little beast. Crunchy tempura-like batter on the outside, ridiculous, raunchy juiciness on the inside with a creamy aioli and a gingery sauce...I'm left wanting more. I never saw this, never thought to try it- but Yelp showed me the way. This is a MUST.     * Wagyu Beef Carpaccio  - Yes, you CAN eat beef raw, and this is one good way to do so. The slices are paper thin, dressed in a light vinegarette, with thin slices of onion and crispy garlic to add textural interest.     * Red Snapper Carpaccio - Little slices of lemon, adorned with a small mound of daikon shreds with an artful slice of red snapper sashimi cradling them and a light cloud of ikura eggs crowning their glory. Maybe 8-12 bite size portions, each one an experience worth having.  * Kaku-Ni - Porkgasmic. If you're a fan of pork, then you've obviously got to be a fan of pork belly. This lil' piggy has been double boiled, kicking it into fall-apart tender submission. It's rich, it's absolutely porky, creamy, gelatinous and wonderful. It's amazing. Eat it!  * Miso glazed, Grilled Cod/Butterfish - The fish is succulent, juicy and yes, buttery. The miso glaze isn't overpowering, adding instead a subtle briny umami to the already potently delicious fish. The skin is crispy. This is a great example of what grilled fish can and should taste like.   * Takoyaki- Fried tako/octopus balls, yeah baby! An order comes with 4-8 of these little wonders. Crispy on the outside, gooey molten goodness on the inside with a chewy chunk  of octopus suspended in doughy lava, it's a magical experience lifted from the streets of Osaka. Watch the bonito shavings dance atop kewpie mayo, mystery sauce, and steaming hot balls...then pop one in your mouth!  Try not to burn yourself. I understand your enthusiasm, my dears.   * Yellowtail Tar-Tare- delicious. If you like yellowtail, get this.  Oh, I'm sure there's more I can add, but do I need to? This place is good. Go, get a pitcher of \"beeru\", pig out, and enjoy! Itadakimasu!!",

And Ichiza is both.  The food was good.  I can't say we tried everything on the menu, but we sure did try.  The sushi was nice and fresh.  The yakatori was good.  Even the gizzards (which I'm not a big fan of) were delicious.  Haven't tried the desserts but looking forward to it next time.  The best part was considering how much beer and sake we drank, the bill was still a bargain.  This will be a staple ever time I go back.  Venture away from the Strip and discover the other places you can eat and play in Vegas.  Lastly, I know this is the land of buffets, but sometimes it's just not worth it.  Why stuff yourself with bad food when you can eat quality dishes at a sit down?  viva la yelp",

My sister and I ordered a dozen oysters, and even said to the waitress, we were looking for some fresh oysters and she said they were from Washington. With this said...we assumed they were regular small oysters, but she came out with those huge oysters...and I can't believe we ate them all, because we didn't want them to go to waste. Then we got really sick afterwards.   It was still good, but just know what you are ordering when you are here, because the staff is not the most helpful.",

Most of the other dishes were sort of plain.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nPiTwWEFr-VsePew7Sjg?select=4QXEYaL6v2HEIbqixT2tvw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nP...</a>  The chicken skewers were alright. but the meatballs were pretty good.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nPiTwWEFr-VsePew7Sjg?select=X0gx3uofwH-JdZLwZEwXRA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nP...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nPiTwWEFr-VsePew7Sjg?select=41bpHen74LWHqo5fItDNZQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nP...</a>  Glad I came to try it out, but Raku will be my staple in Vegas.",

Beef carpaccio, agedashi tofu, and a couple of sushi items I remember distinctly but do not know the name of - they were all delicious.  I had spicy ramen noodles, which were also pretty good. My friend got a big plate of sashimi. I had a piece, and it was fantastic. Also tried another friend's kimchee fried rice, which I enjoyed. Service was decent, although they confiscated two boba teas from our party until the end of the meal. I hate it when places have silly policies like that.",

After making faces when I requested all veggie rolls - to go, she made me wait, at least, fifteen minutes after my food was packaged to go. I would still be sitting there right now if I had not asked \"how much longer?\" Vegetable rolls, how long does that take, right? When I asked about my take-out she rolled her eyes, slammed down whatever she was doing and marched over to the food I saw sitting there fifteen minutes earlier.   Food was packaged in a wasteful manner.  Every roll was in it own \"Styrofoam\" container causing it to roll around and become unrolled.  Unrolled rolls, great.   The \"All You Can Eat\" location downstairs from there is better and a dollar less for the rolls I ordered here...; She probably overcharged me.  I would not be surprised.",

The only thing that I don't really care for is how they have their \"off the menu\" items posted all over their walls. So I'm sitting there looking like a weirdo, squinting and staring across the room to see what else I want to order lol. Besides that, I love Ichiza.",

I know, I'm a deprived child. Anyway, I figured out that it doesn't taste like that at all and now I am officially in love with this shinanigans!  I forgot the name of the type I had, someone else ordered it for me, but I believe it was the seafood one. A little spice to it and was perfect in every way. Now if only I could figure out the use of chopsticks without looking like an idiot!  Also had some tofu, which was super soft, so it was also a little hard for me to manage to eat, but I liked it all the same.  The great grand finale, was the honey bread. OH MER GERD! It's not even like, a slice of bread, its this huge square loaf that is drizzled in honey and icecream, and was sooooo good. It hurt to eat cause I was so full but I couldn't stop.   If you come here, get the honey bread, and your life will be complete and all voids in your soul will be filled. That is all.",

So we got lots of different things the pork and onions skewers, beef tongue skewers, buttered clams, hamachi sashimi, beef carpaccio, miso cod, salmon Kama.   The skewers were ok not as good as kyaras but ok. The clams were ok as well but a little too salty to my liking. Hamachi sashimi was good. The beef carpaccio was too oily. Miso cod was such a disappointment it was mushy very salty and just lacked the sweet flavor you usually get at other places. The salmon Kama was also salty and didn't seem cooked right.  Surprisingly compared to other reviews I actually thought the service was great. They very attentive   Sorry maybe we went on an off night",

I'm here on a Monday at 2pm and there are 2 waiters running around, one is a scatter brain and looks stressed...and there are about 5 tables...I think 2 waiters should be able to take care of 5 tables. I was a waiter once and had to take care of 6 tables by myself.  Food me and my friends ordered (total 4 of us): - Ramen DX - love the soup base - Smelt fish - the small fish with the smelt eggs inside yummm - Squid - half was dry (probably from sitting on the counter too long and the waitress forgot to give it to us until later) - Seaweed salad - good, more salad then seaweed though - Salmon sashimi - good - Spicy tuna roll - good - Okra - good, fresh - Fire roasted eggplant - good  Things they forgot: -Spider roll - good if we actually got it on time (they gave it to the table next to us and when they realized we ordered it they took it off their table and gave it to us) -Coffee (be aware that their coffee is $4.50...like the price of Starbucks but tastes weak and is in a small cup) -We asked twice for them to refill our water -We ordered 2 Half ramen and only one came and they forgot the soup...by the time they brought out the soup the noodles had dried up and stuck together...then an hour later they brought out my friends half ramen - Pot Stickers (they took forever on this one and we asked twice and finally decided to cancel it because when we looked over at the waitress it looked like she forgot again)  Keep in mind we placed this order all together in the beginning and didn't add on anything and they still messed up.  So 2 stars for good food but horrible service, I would've given 1 star if the food was bad as well. We gave $1.00 tip on our $74.00 bill and left.",

    "text": "I was a bit disappointed to be honest. Ichiza earned high praise from a friend and quite good ratings on Yelp. I expected more I guess... I thought it was gonna be more of a sushi house, but ended up finding more of a Japanese tapas type of place.   The crazy line outside, even at midnight (oh wait, that's early in LV time), gave it promise. But actually, we didn't have to wait at all. The line was mostly for large groups and two people walked out of the bar area and we were given their seats. Score!  The restaurant is kinda crazy. It was so full and must be a very trendy hangout for college kids, because that seemed to be the majority of the patrons there... avg age = 20 yrs old by my guess.  The menu is a little off-putting in that it's somewhat out of date... specials line the walls and bar area, but I can't read them all.  I actually ended up ordering two things from pictures that I saw on yelp: Yellowtail TarTar and Spanish Mackerel Carpaccio. They were both good, but I would highly recommend the yellowtail. It's different, crunchy, salty and a tiny bit spicy.   We also ordered the black cod, kakuni (pork belly), and a few other things. The items were good in their own separate ways, but nothing really made my mouth say \"wow\".   And in the end, they had run out of the famous Honey Toast, which made me sad as that was one of the reasons we had gone to this place. Ended up ordering two separate desserts to replace it: soy mousse (I didn't like it, but my dining partner did) and flan which was pretty good.  So, to wrap it up, I don't know it was okay. I'm glad I didn't have to wait in a long line, otherwise I'd be complaining more. I'd go back for the honey toast and pray that the lines isn't too long. But I'd also probably only have a tiny bit to eat at this place. Maybe pre-game elsewhere first~",

The pork belly is one of my favorites.  It was so tender and melted in my mouth.  The salmon was also very good.  For dessert we had both the honey toast and the crepes.  The honey toast was amazing!! I dream of the next time I will eat it.  The crepes weren't very good in my opinion..  The menu is huge.  Half of it is all over the wall in the restaurant, so it gets difficult to read.  The meals are pretty small, almost tapas style.  So order 2-3 things.  Service was quick and friendly.  We will return:)",

We told the server please order one gizzard, she served us the gizzard skewer. We wanted the garlic chicken gizzard. Honestly we haven't been here for a while, didn't remember they also had the skewer kind. But I think as a server she could have asked. If she politely changed our order, it's still acceptable, however, she later gave us an attitude, and slammed our plate. Never coming back again!",

My entire meal was spent scanning the walls for the next dish rather than enjoying my friends and this nice night out. I also found that a lot of the tables around me were ordering run-of-the-mill Japanese sushi dishes even though there were so many other options, why would they do that with so many choices? I don't get it. I wanted to make sure I was trying all the best dishes but I couldn't weigh all my food options, from my table I could only see so many walls! Foodie Raaaaaaaaaage!!!  From what I can remember I enjoyed the following dishes: spicy kimchi pork, deep fried quail eggs, avacado filled with poke, and bluefin sashimi. We also enjoyed a rather fancy bottle of sake. Overall, this is an interesting place with some good eats but far too frustrating for me.",

    "text": "Went here on a Tuesday evening to grab a beer and share some small plates with a new friend in town.  No trouble finding seating although I can imagine this could be a popular spot for late night munchies closer to the weekend.  Perfect place for a casual post-work meetup with the bros although not necessarily ideal to impress someone on a first date (I've heard Raku would be more optimal).  A bit surprised a fair amount of dishes were already sold out (roasted quail eggs on skewers, eel chirashi bowl, and fatty tuna roll) since we arrived around 7ish.    Being an izakaya or Japanese pub, we figured it would be best to go with the warm offerings rather than sushi.  Besides, beer always goes well with grilled/fried food with bold flavors.    Beef tongue on skewers:  flame broiled to perfection with that elusive texture that can often be missed when preparing beef tongue (overdone= rubbery, underdone= gummy)  I appreciated the fresh application of salt after grilling and add a dash of fresh lemon juice = party in one's mouth.  Chicken meatball skewers= I may have had overhyped expectations since I saw a food network episode raving about some Japanese spot in new york with mindblowing chicken meatballs, but this one left something to be desired  Agedashi Tofu- very well balanced flavors and beautiful presentation, nice intermission between the other heavy hitters  Garlic chicken gizzards with green beans-  this dish was destined to be paired with an ice cold beer, nice playful juxtaposition of crunchy and chewy  Takoyaki- this is like a Japanese hush puppy with a hidden surprise of tender squid and topped with shredded dry seaweed and drizzled with a savory barbeque-like sauce...what's not to love?  So much terrain that remains to be uncovered including the bacon-wrapped mochi and the honey toast, so expect multiple installments to follow.",

The food isn't bad, it just isn't great. It's Asian barfood, though they put weird twists on very simple food items in order to add to the variety. And while on the topic of that: HOLY FUCK. This place has so many random made-up items that they don't have room on their menus for them. The items are scribbled onto pieces of plain white paper and taped up on every wall in the place. You wait for over an hour to sit, finally grab your table and a few drinks, take a look at the menu, and BOOM your head explodes. Too many decisions, none of them particularly more special than the rest. It's still a decent place to enjoy a drink with friends, and all the servers are super polite and friendly. I just think there isn't anything too special otherwise. And seriously, explodehead.",

They have a fantastic hangover dish which i forget the name of but it features a  bowl of rice in green tea broth with  your choice of salmon or salted plum. The broth and the rice will help nurse you back to health. If the broth doesn't help I'd also recommend their natto and okra dish with it's slimy texture it may be hard for some to palate but the sliminess in natto helps coat the stomach and helps with digestion and tummy issue's and the natural enzymes in okra that cause it to be slimy do that as well. The Japanese know what they are doing when they are eating slimy food. It's good for you!!  Uni with ponzu sauce was delicious and creamy. I've never had Uni before and I think I am now a huge fan. Ichiza is fanatastic for a genuine slice of Japan in Las Vegas.",

We were craving noodles for dinner and it was between Ichiza and a neighboring Chinese noodle house downstairs. Ichiza was definitely a great find and a restaurant I will probably remember for a long time!  The restaurant is a cozy little place, packed with people. It looks like you stepped into a Ramen house in Japan. The staff greets you with a friendly smile. Once you're seated, you look at the menu. That night, we were all craving noodles, and looked at the Ramen menu. Intially, I thought the menu lacked a lot because there were only a few to choose from.  I asked the waitress which she'd recommend and she said the one with the pork belly. So, both my buddy and I ordered it and waited.   When the ramen arrived, the smell was exhilarating! The beautiful sight of the creamy broth, veggies and the noodles was overwhelming.  We digged in and MAN, it was the BEST ramen we ever had! We enjoyed every bite of it down to the last drop of broth!   This place was so good that we came back on the last day of our trip, but this time during lunch hour and had their beef katsu, bento combo box with cod fish, salad, miso soup and beef bowl, and fried chicken curry and MAN...again, it was so good! I also ordered a spicy tuna handroll and it was rockin'!  This place really does not and WILL NOT DISAPPOINT! If you're in the area, please check this joint out. You'll be happy that you stopped by!",

She actually stopped us at our last order and said \"Wait, I think that's already too much. Just get that for now and see how you feel.\" She was partly correct. What we ordered, was just enough. We devoured everything on all the plates, it was soo delicious!   Since we still had a little room let in us, we decided to get the famous Honey Toast. It came out right away and boy was it heavenly!! Just thinking about it makes my mouth water.   Everything we ordered was perfect and really hit the spot.

I could probably come back 100 times and never have the same thing each time.  AMAZING EATS I'VE TRIED tuna carpaccio  black cod beef tataki fried chicken HONEY TOAST  Honestly, I've been food drunk leaving here so I don't remember every delicious dish I've had but mostly everything is absolutely delectable. The worst thing I ate there was wasabi octopus. It sounded like a good idea at the time but raw octopus with tons of wasabi tastes worse than it sounds.   I need to rave more about the genius dessert that is HONEY TOAST. As simple as it sounds, it is a heavenly combination of toast topped with vanilla ice cream drizzled with honey. I could eat one honey toast to myself. I could eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. If you come here, order one or two to be safe!",

The brief decoration in the dinning room sends out the classical refined breath. The servers in the restaurant are all Japanese waitress. All of them are wearing the black uniforms; it makes people feel professional. The menu that the waitress gave to me is not including all meals in. They putted most meals' names on the walls around the dinning room. It gives the customers the unusual experience when they are ordering their meals. The restaurant has a small dinning room, so it always full of the customers there. Also it is easier for waitress to better serve customers. It has the open kitchen in dinning room, so customer can see how their food been cooked. In this restaurant seafood predominates the menu, as shrimp, fish, and other sea life are widely available. There have sashimi, BBQ, Raman and honey toast in the restaurant. The dishes here are quite new, and also very delicious. I ordered a hot green tea, which has the clear green color. I smelled bitter and tea-leaves before I tasted it. When I drink it, I can feel little watery for the tea, but the favlor become strong at later. After I got the barbecued pork ramen that has a strong meat smell before I saw it. The soup has an oily yellow color, which tasted rich pork and chicken flavor. The noodle has spring back when you eat them that keep the perfect balance with its soup. The dessert I chose the honey toast, which has fragrant smell with the honey and vanilla. The baked square toast has one scoop of the vanilla ice cream. The toast was golden brown with little yeasty smell, which taste crispy and dry. But if you eat it with the ice cream that would taste sweet and silky in your mouth. The price range is so practical and affordable. The guest service in this restaurant is not bad. Their efficiently services never took over 10 minutes for each meals been served. It uses the disposable chopsticks and tableware in high quality plastic to serve customers. The cleanliness in its dinning room and restaurant are so clean. I would like to come back this restaurant for their delicious food and dessert.",

I enjoyed their sashimi plate, portions are generous and everything looked and tasted fresh. My husband loved their beef bowl, and there was a roll we got that had tempura and tuna on the top of a california roll...that was pretty good too.  Their green tea is also really good, sounds like a weird thing to compliment as its so simple, but its a green tea with toasted rice.  We enjoyed it so much we sought out the waitress to ask what brand it was.   And finally, the dessert.  Of course they are known for their honey toast, and with good reason.  It was sweet, crispy, and soft all at the same time, and a nice dessert to split between two or three people.",

We'd filled up the frequent diner card so quickly that we were getting the max. discount within 2 months.

    "text": "this is by far one of my most favorite restaurants in las vegas.  Ever since discovering this place about 3-4 years ago, i have always been coming back.  this isn't your high end japanese restaurant.   the decor is simple, the prices are very reasonable, the food is extensive and excellent, and the place is great place to be merry.  right when you walk in you are greeted in japanese and when you leave your thanked in japanese.  the workers there all seem to be young students.   there are so many dishes to choose from.  the only thing i can do is tell you about what i always order: 1) menu items:  kushi-katsu - crunchy breaded pork w/lemony teriyaki dip; ika yaki - broiled squid;  ichiza ramen noodles - yummy; seaweed salad; beef tataki - rare beef slice to dip in a ponzu-dailkon radish mixture (sublime); kim chee fried rice; and a sashimi plate w/ tuna, albacore, mackerel, yellow tail, salmon, octopus, and squid. 2) non-menu items (sheets of paper that have daily/common specials are posted over the walls)  monk fish liver, fried smelt (my most favorite b/c the eggs are cooked in the belly), and beef cubes in ponzu sauce.  yeah, there are a lot of dishes that i like, but im so impressed that ichiza's has not disappointed me for the many times i've been there.  They have large group seating areas, which i've enjoyed many times with friends and family eating and drinking up cold sake, sake bombs, and japanese beer.  i really recommend their house cold sake, so much better and smoother than drinking it warm.  i've been there a many nights till closing leaving with my belly full and ridiculously buzzed from all the sake we drank.   i always have to put this on the itinerary of any of my visiting friends and family that come to las vegas.  that's how much i love and trust this place.  anybody who knows me, can back me up for whatever say about this restaurant b/c most likely i've taken them there.... additional note...don't think that this restaurant is one of those upscale dress up places b/c of the amount of stars i gave it.  it gets five stars b/c all around it's hella awesome!!!",

    "text": "After reading all the reviews on yelp, I was excited to try this place. One word to define this restaurant: OVERRATED...  Wanted to try a restaurant off the strip and reasonably priced with a twist on \"authentic\"  Japanese cuisine but was disappointed. The food was ok, but wished the portions were larger for the price you pay. Also, like many yelpers have mentioned, you do have to look all over the walls to see what they offer besides what is on the menu.   Dishes I tried suggested by yelpers: -garlic chicken gizzards: $4 for maybe two or three diced gizzards with these green onion like veggies (which were the highlight of the dish) -yellow tail tartar: $7 for extremely little fish, there were more tomatoes, lettuce, and rice with a thick fried wonton wrapper -uni over mochi: $6 very little uni was placed on top of a thick piece of mochi which you wrap with a piece of seaweed. No sauce was provided, you taste just the essence of the uni and chewiness of the mochi  -beef fried rice (special): aroma from the butter smelled delightful, but a tad bland and moist.  -red snapper carpaccio: $7 well worth. Light and fresh, the ponzu and the lemon enhanced the flavor and texture of the fish.  -miso black cod: $9 the fish was moist and flaky, grilled to perfection. Just wished the portion was larger -honey toast: $8 overly sweet. something you can do easily at home and cheaper. It's bread! All it is butter spreaded on toast then layered with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream and then drizzled with honey.   I might give this place another shot when I revisit Vegas since they are open til 4am.  Hopefully it will be less packed so I can see the menu on the wall more clearly.",

    "text": "I have been to Ichiza twice and I have had great experiences both times. Both times I have been there, there was a short wait.  I have been seated at both a table and at the bar.  Service was good, and everyone was friendly. The first time I went I was with an Ichiza veteran who knew exactly what to order, so I had a whole mess of stuff, and can't really remember what any of it was, could have been the fact her expertise included mass quantities of sake. I remembered the kimchi fried rice and mapo-tofu and ordered those again on my second visit.  The next time I went we were a little more daring and did most of our ordering off the walls. Once again everything was yummy.  I was not a huge fan of the minced Spanish mackerel, but it was okay.  The tartar yellowtail was delicious, but a bit of a challenge to eat. When I lost about half of it down my shirt, it was good for a laugh. :) The prices are very reasonable, and I left full and happy.  Since my first review, I have been back many times, and I have always had a great experience.  Tonight the folks at Ichiza went above and beyond!!  There was a bit of a wait, so we went downstairs to Tea Planet, and we didn't have enough time to finish our drinks.  We went in Ichiza half expecting them to tell us no outside drinks, which they did...HOWEVER, they offered to put our drinks in the refrigerator for us so they wouldn't go to waste! Just another reason to love Ichiza, and in case you need another...two words...honey toast. YUM!",

    "text": "Itadakimasu! It's exactly how you feel when you walk into this quaint little place above Tea Planet. Yes....you would never know it was here except for the sounds of fun and mmm mmm smells of Japanese goodness. Ichiza is definitely a jewel  hidden in Vegas. There's nothing more authentic than Ichiza. I just like saying it...Ichiza Ichiza Ichiza. I have taken and introduced people to this place and they have all agreed how fun it is. Not your typical, \"yea dude let me get a California Roll\" or your run of the mill Chicken Teriyaki. That's not Japanese. We're looking at Mmm mmm broiled squid, and Katsu, real Ramen Noodles - Mmmm tampopo! Kirin Ichiban on draft! I love the Veggie tempura bowls where there's just a nest of veggies over rice with real teriyaki sauce. How can you go wrong? YEA! You won't find your typical teppanyaki chef there making onion volcanos.  Sure there's things here that white people may cringe upon like the gizzard skewers...or even beef tongue....Sweet fried garlic with Natto(a fermented soybean).....The service is a little slow. I figure it's because the place is usually really busy. I like having a place to go to in the middle of the night that can make me feel all warm and fuzzy....and that's not from the Kirin.  If you have enough room. You gotta try the honey toast. It takes some time so order it when you're halfway finished. It's Japanese Toast (like half a loaf of bread) partially hollowed out with butter....honey....and vanilla ice cream. Simple, delicious....and to the point.  I definitely enjoy the Ramen, jalepeno fried rice - yakitori - and the grilled squid...Oooo and grilled makerel, black cod in miso....so much to choose from! This place can fit anyone's budget. The ambiance is traditional japanese, with pictures and specials on the walls, there's a group area that you can sit, but you gotta take your shoes off. The bar is great because you can watch them cook in the kitchen. Overall - a must go place.  If you're a regular here - Get your Ichiza stamp card for a discount.",

I would definitely come back here however i've removed a star because their broth doesn't have a ton of flavor I wish there was more to it... however the egg and pork make up for it... surprisingly the waitstaff was friendly and fast! looking forward to my third trip to this ramen house... the only BAD thing is the grade that they got from the food service police, it's a C... subtracted a star for that because even though we can't guess why they got a C... i'm sure it's there somewhere and that's dis-concerning",

I looked on Yelp to figure out where we should eat. I was starving!   I discovered this gem. They've been open for 14 years! It was busy but there was only a 5 minutes wait. The parking lot sucks but you can find a park next door by the China Town Mall if you need to.   I was hungry but I wasn't feeling too well, so it was perfect that they have tapa style dishes. I read on Yelp that the food items on the wall are different than the menu items but better so I was excited to ask about those. She recommended a couple and Yelp also helped me figure out dishes to order off the menu.   I wish I took pictures of everything but I was so hungry I only got one picture! We ordered a lot I was the perfect amount of fullness after. We got a variety of healthy like seaweed salad, sushi, sushim like their blue fin from Colombiai, fried goodness like their fried chicken and skewers like their chicken gizzards.   The menu could be a little overwhelming since its large and it looks really Japanese but just ask the waitress for recommendations! I felt like I needed a piece of paper to write all the numbers down! But the waitress keeps your order at your table so she can always come back and add things, which is neat! I like the small style restaurant with a large menu!   I will be back again and can't wait to share this place with others!",

This is a Japanese spot with mostly appetizers/sharing plates. Pretty chill place, not fancy. No wait on Sunday 6pm.  Food: First thing that came out was the Beef Tongue skewers. Omg it was good! I ordered another one after. I coulda probably had a third too. Should've. 5 star item! Everything else we got were good/just ok. Udon: Pretty normal/plain. Just wanted a filler. It had seaweed, an egg, and mushrooms. That's  all :/ Fried quail eggs: Nothing special. I love quail eggs sooo thought I'd try it out. Grilled Squid: My friend wanted this. Not me. It was not something I enjoyed and there were so many pieces! Agedashi Tofu: Pretty normal. Beef Tataki: It was pretty good. Definitely not a filler. Fancy Shmancy raw beef. They have a Honey Toast that I was going to try, but opted out of it since we were going to go elsewhere for dessert.   Prices: Total for 2 people was $45 w/ tip/tax. Something like that. Not bad. I'm also on vacay mode though, so I tend to have a higher threshold for spending on food. So I thought this was pretty good deal. haha.",

    "text": "First time back here in a couple years.  Lots of changes, some new items and some old.  The food is okay, but compared to other izikaya type places in town, lots of items are overpriced, i.e, $8.00 for a bottle of Japanese beer!  R u kidding?  I won't comment on the wine prices because I didn't and wouldn't purchase wine at the prices I saw on the menu.  What really upset me though is this place adds a \"processing fee\" for using credit cards; heck, I've eaten at the most expensive restaurants in Vegas and have never been charged such a fee.  I'm pretty sure credit card fees are built into business price points, so this processing fee is just a ripoff as far as I am concerned.  Not going back.",

The ramen was super bland, with the soup base being super watery. Same thing with the udon noodles, though it was slightly better than the ramen.  All their skewers were hard to eat as well. We ordered different types (liver, gizzards, tongue, etc.) and every single one was so overcooked that it was rather difficult to pull the pieces off the stick (practically stuck and hard as rock).   The \"uni over baked mochi\" seemed a bit interesting when we saw their special dishes posted along the wall. But when it came, it looked quite awful. The mochi tasted like stale gelatin that was baked to the point where it could barely be chewed. The uni....let's not go there....  Service was so-so, not the typical Japanese hospitality you'd expect. To make things worse, they made a mistake on our check as well that we had to correct their calculations.  Go elsewhere if you're looking for palatable food.",

It's upstairs in a shopping Plaza and hard to spot if you aren't paying attention.  The Blue Fin Tuna from Spain is good as is the Wagyu Beef Carpaccio. Some of the other popular dishes here are the Flounder, Scallop and Blue Fin Tuna Sashimi with Crab Butter Sauce, Negi Toro TarTar on a half Avocado with Quail egg, Crab Gratin Croquette with Gravy Sauce, Beef Curry Rice, and Vegetable Tempura! The Sushi here is not fancy at all just very fresh and very good. My favorite dessert was the Honey Toast, which comes with a piece of Toast a scoop of Ice Cream, Strawberries, Whipped Cream and honey over the top it's delicious! They also have pretty good Mochi here. Of course if you read any of my reviews then you know that I like that they are open late! So if you are looking for a new Japanese spot to try that's really divey then try Ichiza it's pretty good.",

Upon walking in, you must wait to be seated and they will find you a comfortable spot. If you're coming in a big group, they usually seat you near the back, where you must take off your shoes and sit in a table with cushion. It's kind of like an old Japanese style place, where you sit Indian style into a rectangular table. It's fun and different and you should experience it at least once.  I ordered the fried pork udon with the sauce and asparagus wrapped in bacon. I'm not much of a die hard Asian food fan, but I feel like what I ordered was just right. My boyfriend got the beef bowl and it was a good portion size.   They're fast and efficient here, we were tired, so we wanted to sit and get our food and go. They also have Mochi ice cream which is a MUST try!",

I like how they give half bowls if you're not that hungry. I've also had some of their sushi and it's okay.   The chicken katsu was boring and lacked in flavor.  The only sauce they had was tempura sauce that didn't do much at all.   The pork and shrimp dumplings were weird. They are pretty much shu mais. There was one shrimp and the rest was a mystery mush filler.   The tofu steak was actually good! I liked the miso sauce on top and the bean sprouts on the bottom. The tofu was actually crispy too!

Space is very limited and when you're trying to leave everyone is trying to get your spot and block you in. Terrible. The place is located on the second floor of the shopping center. The staff is friendly but the food wasn't very impressive.   The menu was all worn out and the specials of the day menu didn't have any prices on it plus it's in no order at all. Not sure what was meant to be appetizers and what was an entree.   I ordered the mini chirashi and vegetable croquette. The mini chirashi was in fact a mini. It had 5 pieces of fish, 1 shrimp and about 7 pieces of ikura(salmon roe). It had a piece of yellowtail, maguro(tuna), mackerel, salmon, and albacore. The fish was okay, not super fresh though.   The croquette was good, freshly fried and flavorful but probably had 4 peas in the whole thing and no carrots in sight. Just not how my mom makes them at all. They're usually stuffed full with veggies.   My fiance got the tasuta-age which wasn't cooked thoroughly. It was pink all the way through. He also got the chicken meatballs and chicken yakitori. He's a chicken kind of guy. Well, we ran into the same issue with the meatballs, pink throughout the inside and the yakitori was just mediocre.   I probably won't be coming back. Nothing too impressive here.",

I had the chicken gizzard stir fry, spicy tuna, meatball, and liver.  Each had a unique flavor and were different selections than most sushi spots in town.  Usually half the menu is rolls at sushi places in Vegas, but Ichiza only had around a dozen rolls and then a few more on specials.  It seemed as if they specialized in more dishes than sushi.  The prices seemed a few bucks more expensive than other places in town, but not overwhelming.  My total bill was near $35, including 2 sakis.    Ichiza is located in China Town on the second floor of one of the unassuming shopping centers on Spring Mountain.  There was a line at 9:30pm which is nice to see and the place was crowded which is apparently a usual outcome.  I'll give it another try in the future and experiment with their menu, but as far as a plain \"sushi\" spot, I think there are better alternatives in town.  I would consider Ichiza a quality Japanese restaurant for a local meal.",

This isn't your typical sushi joint, but you will be delighted to see some authentic dishes (small plates/tastes) of some hardcore Japanese food. There are ton of items to choose from as the walls are all pasted with various menu items.  I always enjoy the beef tongue skewers (it taste WAY more better than it sounds) and the Salmon Belly is so buttery that it melts in your mouth.   If you have enough room leftover...the honey toast is amazing. Think a toasted loaf of bread, drizzled in warm honey, with ice cream. Awesome.",

    "text": "Stopped by here our first night in Vegas. We're not into the normal \"tourist\" things so relied heavily on Yelp, which was very helpful.The reviews of Ichiza are pretty accurate. It's a small-ish, low key place in the Chinatown area. Crown Bakery, which was also good, is next door.   Glad we got the tips on the fact that the \"menu\" is hand written signs hanging all on the walls and around the bar. Though they have pictures, it's still tough to know what to order.  1) We ordered the grilled salmon belly, but never got it. Someone else seemed to be enjoying it at their table, so we looked on in jealousy. Oh well, better luck next time.  2) The beef tongue stew is indeed delicious. Very strong umami flavor, very simple, tender beef with mushrooms and onions. The hubby didn't think it was salty, but I did. The only downside is that it overpowered the #90 ramen dish that I ordered. Thumbs up.  3) #90 ramen. Not sure what the fuss is about. Not as flavorful as Vietnamese pho, various Udons and other Asian soups I've tried here in Texas. Again, flavors could have been muted by the beef tongue stew.  4) Salmon roll. Nothing special. Not bad. We sat at the bar, so watched the sushi chef who seemed diligent.  5) Chicken gizzards on the skewer came out a little bloody and didn't seem that tasty to me. I'd pass. Beef tongue skewer wasn't great to me either. It was a little dry, but flavor was ok. I prefer my tongue stewed I suppose.  6) Honey toast. Wouldn't have ordered it had I not seen the Yelp photos. Glad I did. It was unique and tasty, but what wouldn't if it was topped with ice cream, butter and honey. Price was a little high at $7.   7) Was going to order the eel, but it only comes fried, which seems like a waste of Unagi.   Overall, I'd come back to get the honey toast, beef tongue stew, salmon belly (since we didn't get to try) and the rest of the menu, if I could. Definitely worth a try.",

    "text": "Ask me my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas and I'll tell you Ichiza.   You wont find me visiting overpriced tourist joints on the strip and I'll rarely eat at a chain restaurant in some strip mall. That leaves the restaurants on Spring Mountain Rd. A gauntlet of goodness, teasing your senses with aromas of far away lands.   I happened upon Ichiza a few years ago and it became an instant favorite of mine when dining out. Their authentic style and representation of the culture, service, variety and flavor in their dishes make this a truly enjoyable dining experience time and time again. You're greeted by bubbly young female employees and offered a seat in their small, yet inviting dining area. While the place is usually packed, it has never taken an unreasonable amount of time to land an open table. The menu caters to anyone from the conservative to the adventurous eater, so there's always something for everyone willing to try some far east cuisine.    My personal favorites include the beef tataki in ponzu sauce. You'd think twice about eating raw beef, but once the tart sauce tickles your taste-buds, there's no turning back from popping these thinly-sliced quality cuts into your mouth.   Another must get (and not on the menu...it's on the wall by the bar) is the eel kakiage. Visually, it's a gorgeous multi-layered roll with stacked levels of textures and tastes making you say, \"I don't know what the hell I'm eating, but this is damn good and I need more of it.\"   If you've never eaten tongue, but always wanted to try, now would be the time to pucker up and give that cow a French kiss. Tender morsels of seasoned beef tongue dance on your palate like it's prom night all over again.   Finish your meal with mango or strawberry mochi that melts in your mouth or grab a spoon and share the ever so sweet honey toast with your friends.   Ladies and gentlemen, Ichiza is food porn at its finest.",

    "text": "Food: WOW, phenomenal. From now on when someone asks me what one food I would bring with me if I were on a deserted island, I would reply with Ichiza's Salmon Sashimi. WARNING I'm about to write a \"long\" paragraph on the salmon sashimi alone. Words cannot describe how delectable this freshly slice of fish is. Beyond fresh, melts in your mouth, orgasm for the taste buds. When this god like piece of fish was introduced to my mouth it was love at first bite, an addict getting her first high. I have night sweats from being deprived of this dish. If some kind stranger from LV would fly this salmon sashimi on their private jet to SJ for me, I will be forever in their debt.   Moving on... the grilled beef tongue, yellowtail tartare, and black cod were all delicious as well. The honey buttered bread with ice cream I would pass on, along with the ramen and skewers. Did I mention the salmon sashimi is a must! @_@  Service: The workers were all nice, service is a bit slow but quality food takes quality time.   Price: I guess if you are a regular there you can get a member card for 15%?? off of your meal, so luckily one of the people we went with had this. Prices of everything was fair, the only price I remember is the salmon sashimi for about $6.50 for 6 pieces (I could be wrong, high percentage that I am).  Overall: SALMON SASHIMIIIII. I'll be back for you every time I go to Vegas.  Live, Laugh, and Lunch Patty",

    "text": "HOLY CRAP.. Ichiza is F***ING AWESOME!! Ichiza is what I see more as an izakaya compared to Miko's.. which to me is like a typical Japanese restaurant. Ichiza has that more bar-like feel and their foods are more like pupu type foods along with your typical Japanese dishes (Teishoku, ramen, etc).   The boyfriend and I went around 6pm on a Saturday.. I was thinking might be busy but it wasn't. Lots of reserved tables though so we were seated at the bar on some wooden seats. For drinks, we ordered just the house sake and the bf got kirin. I should have gotten the calpico-soju! Next time..  For foods we got: Beef Tataki - Tender rare beef drizzled with ponzu sauce and on the side there was onion, really minced up garlic and some pink stuff.. no idea what that was.. but all were good!  Fried Natto Roll - WOW!! I was stoked to see how many natto dishes they had! I'm natto crazy! This was the first time ever coming across a fried natto roll. It was topped with some fresh raw ahi as well. SOOOOO GOOD!! My bf hates natto so I got to devour it all myself.  Skewers- We got a few different skewers. -- Chicken yakitori & shishito peppers were pretty typical. Also, we got the bacon wrapped mochi! That was very interesting and I enjoyed it. But what wrapped in bacon isn't good?!  Natto/Okra - I had to try this natto/okra which was pretty typical stuff.. wish it came with hot rice.. but hell, I love natto by itself as well. Slimey, stinky goodness! :]  Tofu Salad - Delicious, soft tofu and ahi topped over salad greens and avo. The boyfriend and I both thought it needed more texture! It was all really.. soft. They used a little bit of romaine and mostly red leaf lettuce which doesn't have much crunch. Maybe some won-ton chips or something to counteract all the softness going on in there. Very yummy otherwise!  We also got spicy tuna roll which wasn't anything spectacular compared to the other dishes.. the bf was just just craving some sushi.   Overall, individual prices are not all that bad but they sure do add up! Especially whilst drinking! I was getting more hungry as we drank.. Between the two of us and drinks, we spent about $70. I made sure to fill out the survey after so I can get the frequent members card.. cause you can bet, I'll be returning again and again and again.",

The menu items placed on the walls makes ordering very hard and confusing. I want to give it one more try since the other reviews are good but I just didn't have the same experience.",

I don't really drink but I like izakaya food very much - the small portion is the charm as you can try many different things in one single meal. Their poki tuna/tofu salad is my favorite.  Their yakitori and grilled dishes are very good as well - grilled beef tongue, anyone?   This place is not like the usual Americanized \"Japanese\" restaurants, so think twice before you bring your colleagues/customers to this place.  Anyway, for me, authenticity matters - it helps me survive the insanity of Vegas. Also this place is off the Strip, so price is very reasonable.",

Went home and needed a snack even though paid $20/person (note: we did get one small carafe of sake). (1)  Normally, we usually come here for their ramen. However, we came here with a friend who's a regular here (eats here at least once a week). Boy, what a different experience that was!  We got an amuse bouche. The manager actually smiled at us (he normally has a scowl on his face whenever you ask for a table). It was like we stepped into a rabbit hole. Seriously.  We ordered a delicious grilled salmon collar, grilled chicken wings, jalapeno fried rice, sashimi, fried soft shell crab, tsukune, a sushi roll (eel with various toppings) and zaru soba noodles. All these items were worth ordering again.  The misses are stirfried beef tongue (which I found to be a little too tough - normally I'm a huge fan of tongue), and shiso-wrapped pork/bacon skewers (which were a little too bland, needing more salt and shiso leaf).  My complaints are the value of the dishes. Serving sizes are small for the money. A better value for your money is the ramen dishes.",

My wife and i showed up and waited behind a group of 3, all the tables were occupied which is normal at this place. I had told the host that we preferred a table and he told me that the bar was available soon. When it was our turn to be seated a table was just clearing up as another group of 3 individuals was just arriving. After telling the host that we prefer to be seated at the table that was being cleared, he told us in a very rude tone \"you can not sit there, it's for 4 people.\" He then proceeds to sit the the group that had just arrived after my wife and i had been waiting patiently. He then proceeds to walk us over to the bar to show us our seats. After taking a second to take this all in, i was so upset about how we were just treated, my wife and i walked out of the restaurant. This was a slow night and their were couples in the restaurant seated at 4 tops and for us to be told that we were not able to do the same was ridiculous. There was also a full bench in the back of the restaurant that was completely unoccuppied.  I've recommended this place to many of my clientel who wants to get away from the Strip but never again, this unacceptable hospitality. The food may be decent but service always comes first.",

The service is fast and friendly.  One thing that I didn't like was that they a regular menu but also a bunch of specials that were all over the walls.  My buddy had to get up and walk around to ensure that he wasn't missing out on anything.    We ordered a bunch of things but the ones that I remember the most were:  Miso butterfish:  I honestly don't know if this is truly a butterfish. Based on experience, butterfish is really expensive and this was half the price for a big piece.  Anyways, a generous portion of fish that is nicely grilled and super moist.  Just the way I like my fish to be cooked.  Bacon wrapped asparagus:  Can't go wrong with anything that has bacon.  Red snapper carpaccio:  Very nice presentation.  Everything was on a slice of lemon and could be eaten in a single bite.  Good as an appetizer.  The cab ride from the strip cost about $10.  Not bad at all for a tasty meal.

I've been here twice with a friend (who raves of it), but both experiences were varied. Walking into this place feels like you've walked into a small izakaya in Japan. It's instant. Wrapped bar, large sitting area, and side tables all cramped into the small place. Lovely.  Lunch special was good and well worth the price. No problems there. Dinner was a different story. While there are some great choices, a large portion of the main part of the menu isn't worth the price. I ordered some yakatori (chicken skewers) and other meats on skewers, with a side of a couple kushikatsu (deep fried on skewers). When my and my friend's order came, we were surprised on the portion size: Two skewers for around $2. Great, right? No, that was a order of two, and each skewer is about 6\" inches long--very small for what I was expecting. Having a taste of them, they weren't all that great. Flavor was good, but tough meat (chicken gizzards was very hard)..   I had a big hassle both times with the service. Food was always brought out whenever the servers felt like it, so while my friend ate, I had to sit around for my food to come. There was a mix up with the orders and quantity, and it was also hard to get the server's attention at times.   Bottom line: I wouldn't return to deal with the service. The lunch service is very good, and happy hour (2:30-5) is worth it as well. Just not dinner, and not anything on skewers--as I see it.",

We got seats at the end of the sushi bar, a fine spot, though a bit cramped. The little house appetizer they brought out was fair, but nothing extraordinary. The menu was decent, but the specials (all over the walls and above the bar) seemed to offer much more variety and interest. Unfortunately, there didn't seem to be rhyme or reason as to where to find anything on the walls. I read some Japanese, but from where we sat we could only make out a fraction of the offerings, and it was much too crowded to get up and walk around, hanging over others' plates to get a better look.  We ordered tako wasabi, though we never found it listed. It was average. The grilled squid was good, if a bit tough. Fried oysters were good, but we would have liked the spicy mustard that belongs with them. The crazy roll was fine, but pretty much available anywhere.  We felt the set-up of the place was a bit too compartmentalized to call it a True izakaya. There was none of that \"shared space\" feel. All in all a fine meal, but a bit of a disappointment for a special occasion.",

Long wait, but I didn't really see anything special in the food. The Honey Toast had pretty great reviews, there was really nothing special about it-its bread loaded with honey, ice cream & a bunch of butter which was a whole cube that didn't dissolve into the bread. #17 was supposedly one of there best items, not my taste at all if you like RAW meat, the sauce was great but that was about it! #20- Chicken was battered and cooked deliciously, which is the only reason I'm giving this place a 2 star rating. Disappointed from all the hype.",

Each booth can seat up to 10 people from what I remember.  We took off our shoes so make sure you don't have stinky feet!  Anyhow, the small restaurant is also lined with 2 seater tables and a sushi bar you can sit at.  We started off with a pitcher of Sapparo and my favorite, warm sake!  From there it was harder to remember what food we ordered.  The ordering process is unique cause you order off the small notes on the wall.  I feel that they do this to keep the dishes new and fresh.  The price range of the orders range from $5 - $15 for a tapas style dish.  Each little portion stands out from your normal sushi fare and you will not be disappointed.  The one dish that I really loved was the deep fried breaded bacon wrap pork tender loin! Yum.   If you're looking for a busy place to drink and eat away your weekly stress this is the place to be.  But, you'll really never beat the rush cause this place is popin!  Come with an empty stomach and if you have enough fun you'll leave with an empty wallet!",

    "text": "Time for a revisit. Ichiza does deliver on a couple of items, but some other items are so bad, I'm not sure if you can even call it food.  @ Shrimp Dumplings - Whoever recommended these dumplings need to get their head checked. These dumplings came out warm on one side and ice cold on the other side. Nuked in the microwave? Flavor wise, it was fine and I didn't get sick eating it.  @ Pork Dumplings - Anyone who says these are goods needs to get their taste buds reworked because this was just bad. It was warm all the way around, but this was just inedible. No one wanted to touch this dish. Even 1 star Orchid did better with this.  @ Calamari - This is like a sheep, it was baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad. I really do think they just went to International Marketplace and bought these. Because they look exactly like the ones I've seen there. Well done deep fried calamari and bad rubbery texture on the squid.   @ Enoki Mushroom w/ Spinach - When our party received this dish, its like we're playing Find Waldo with the enoki mushrooms. After looking for a few minutes, we eventually saw them. The mushroom was too salty.   @ Beef Tataki - Similar to the beef carpaccio. Similar clean and refreshing taste.  @ Grilled Mackerel - Good tasting, but Naked Fish is cheaper and they give you a much bigger fish.  @ Buttered Clams - Much better than the first time. The butter sauce this time didn't overpower the clams.  @ Uni - If I was to only rate this item alone, it would get a 5 star. Uni tasted very fresh and its just yummy if you're into sea urchin gonads.  @ Pork Cutlet - This was one of the items on the middle pillar against the north side of the wall. Its covered in their sauce. The pork cutlet is just cooked properly and so juicy. This would get a 5 star in my book as well.  @ Cheesecake - Its just cheesecake. Nothing special, but nothing bad.  @ Gyoza, Yellow Tail Tar Tar, Cheese Katsu w/ Egg - Check the previous review for a more detail review of each item. Nothing has changed from before.  They ran out of ramen on a Friday night. Sad.  Ichiza is like a rainbow. You have food that is 5 star and just delicious. Then you have food that is on the other end of the spectrum that you question whether or not its food. If you average out all of these scores, they're still at a solid 3.   For those that read my Raku review, just tell your pretty girl that this place has a more homely and relaxing atmosphere and the pork cutlet and uni are winners.",

All the Sushi rolls were excellant and the prices were very resonable.  They do not have a wide selection of sushi rolls.  The pork belly was awesome and could possibly went well with a bottle of Asahi.  The Honey Toast with a scoop of vanilla ice cream was to die for and really finished the meal for us.",

    "text": "So keep in mind that I would give this 5 stars for the fact that it's in the US and inland at that but it would probably be a 3 star if I were to rate it against other izakaya in Japan.  I visited there on 12/22 for dinner after the Las Vegas Bowl.  The atmosphere was of a typical izakaya that you would find in Japan so I won't dock it any points since it's actually supposed to be fairly dingy but have good food.  Maybe for the typical US crowd this would be a minus.  The zashiki (tatami booths) in the back had the typical Japanese rowdy college crowd who were playing their loud drinking games which again would probably be a minus for most.  This place is always crowded so even though we got a \"reservation\" (I say that loosely because I don't think they really take reservations except for large groups like the rowdy college group) we had to wait about 20 minutes to get a seat at the large table up front.  However, one table cleared and they reseated us to that more comfortable location.  The servers were all Japanese which helped some as it was easier to order in Japanese and not have to explain things.  Also the rate and order at which the food came out was typical of Japan, randomly and whenever it was ready.  There was a comfort factor there.  The draught beer was a bit better than the normal places where they actually had a head on the beer, but they still use the Canadian made stuff I think so the bubbles aren't the creamier kind but the thinner kind.  I'm often disappointed in the \"Japanese\" beer in the US as it's totally different.  We had: - Spinach with sesame dressing () a bit more dressing than usual but still good. - Garlic baby bok choy () nice and crunchy and a light flavor except the garlic chips which added a little umphh to it. - Mackerel miso-yaki () standard decent miso-yaki. - Motsu-ni () I'm used to red miso so this was just ok. - Tsukune chicken meatball skewers () just the right amount of browning. - Shishito pepper skewers () a little on the spicy side. - Crab fried rice () a tad on the greasy side. - Beef bowl () little beef to behold but the broth was good. - Sour plum chazuke () didn't taste it so can't comment.  I liked all the dishes except the crab fried rice was a bit oily.  I was satisfied with my izakaya fix.  But I'll have to come back for the other items that weren't on the written menu but on the wall menu.  If you're looking for fine Japanese dining, this is not it but if you're missing the izakaya scene in Japan, this will get you there until your next visit there.  4 stars all around for service, atmosphere (can't exactly call it ambience) and food keeping in mind this is supposed to be a bit on the unkempt side izakaya.",

    "text": "For quite a few years I've heard nothing but good things about this place (especially the Honey Toast), but never could find the time to take a visit and try it out.  That changed today. One of my friends believes that every time you have a birthday or some random celebratory incident, you should visit a brand new place to make it more memorable. With such beliefs, we trekked down to Ichiza today after work for my birthday.  At first it was a bit overwhelming as we didn't know what to expect and having the menu spread sporadically amongst the walls wasn't much help. However, it made this place a lot more interesting. I knew I had to order the Honey Toast, so the first thing we did was ask for it.  Man, were all the rants and reviews about this culinary piece of tasty goodness correct! We killed it after making a few jokes about how one certain person in our group thought the big glob of ice cream was butter. Thank goodness it wasn't! We were contemplating ordering one more, but decided we should trek further into the menu.  Since there were so many choices to decide from, we all decided to pick one thing and we would pick off eachother's plates. We decided to play it safe and stuck with Ika Rings (fried calamari), Yakisoba Quesadilla (New Item), Salmon & Mozzarella Tempura (New Item), & Spicy Deep Fried Chicken. The Ika Rings came first, and they were the typical fried calamari fare (tough and crunchy).  The Salmon & Mozzarella Tempura came next, and this definitely was one of the best dishes of the night. The cheese was nice and gooey and the salmon lined the cheese against the tempura batter. We probably should have ordered a second order.  Another popular favorite amongst us was the Yakisoba Quesadilla. One issue a few of us had was the ginger. We're not huge ginger fans, so the fact that we tasted it kind of ruined the feel good first bite of this dish. Other than that, this item was amazing.  After we finished these four, we decided to order a few skewers of Yakitori. Three of us (including myself) had grown up in various parts of Japan during our childhood, and these chicken pieces on a stick brought many memories back to us. Memories always lead to great conversation.  I fell in love with this place; however, I think next time I'll order something different and be sure to ask for no ginger.",

I enjoyed everything i tried there, especially pachinko, uni mochi & the honey toast. (actually i made sure I had room for the honey toast as dessert when I ordered, cos those honey toast pics on Yelp looked so good!).   The reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 was that it's hard to order from their menu.. more special dishes were posted on the wall, and I found it a bit difficult to know what i wanted...   Guess what my hubby & I did?? we picked food from the pics posted on Yelp and showed the pics to the waitress :P It worked so well! If you do not know / are not good at Japanese, you may wanna check out the pics first... I saw a couple just sat down and couldn't make orders and just left.. another couple just sat there for a long time having difficult time to pick food, and finally their friend (who happened to be there too) gave them suggestions.",

The fried chicken was similar to Musha back in Torrance (for those of you from the area) and the chicken and egg bowl was as good as the one from Daiko-Kuya in Los Angeles.  These happen to be some of my favorite Japanese dishes (other than sushi) and I generally avoid eating sushi from Japanese restaurants that don't specialize sushi.  My friend ordered a spicy tuna roll which was alright, but it had a lot more rice than I'm used to.    The honey toast which everyone recommends definitely hits the spot after the meal.  The ingredients are simple yet somehow work so well together - when it first came out, I was doubting whether we could take it down (cuz it's pretty huge).  But after taking the first bite, it wasn't too hard to finish it.  Definitely recommended, just be prepared to wait a a little while for a seat.  If you like Japanese food and need a place to eat late at night don't hesitate to go.",

I've eaten here a past couple of times, and so far everything I tried was good, only down side though was that it was hard to understand and visualize the many because they have a lot of items I am not familiar with and some descriptions are not too well put, and of course I can't remember what we had the last time. I think they just need to improve their menus. Overall this is a pretty popular place and it is always packed, so be prepared to wait a bit for a seat especially if it is peak times.",

Located in a dumpy strip mall, the dumpy restaurant was a popular spot. We made a reservation so we got seated immediately.   The table top was sticky. The kind of stickyness that happens with cheaply made tables with shitty varnish jobs and subpar wipe downs. Ick. The seats had cheap fabric upholstery... mottled and stained by a thousand asses. Disgusting. Maybe this place is just a dive with great food.   Not.   The seaweed salad was a regular leafy salad with a side of seaweed. The Ramen DX with pork broth was mediocre. The ramen noodles were stiff. Broth was forgettable.The chicken meatball skewers were also so-so. The only item that was a good value was the spicy tuna roll. Generous portion and tasty. Special menu items are listed on the wall but in a disorganized fashion so it takes a while to scan the offerings.   Ugh. Okay to pass on this place. Seriously.",

The kitchen looked GROSS when no one is in there and it JUST OPENED!!!!When I went the previous time, it was late and crowded so I didn't get a chance to see the dirty kitchen. I went to Pan Asian on Durango and it's SPOTLESS. That is the kind of place I want to eat in. Anyway, I will NOT return as I dont trust it's sanitary. Too many options in Vegas to eat at a place that makes you feel skeezy.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed having dinner at Ichiza. It was totally different from any other Japanese restaurant that I've been too and they had a vast array of different dishes you can order. From sashimi, to udon, to beef tongue skewers, it was a perfect place, for a curious and fickle person like me, to choose several dishes and taste a little bit of everything. I had:  - Beef tongue skewers (YUMMMM)  - Chicken liver (not so good, for those who don't normally like liver)  - tofu salad w/ tuna sashimi (yummmm)  - Inigari (?)- this is little fishes stuffed with fish eggs...really good.  - wasabi octopus- so good, raw octopus in wasabi sauce  - Uni with mochi - the quality of their uni is really good, but the slice of mochi was a tad too large, but overall really good.   I wanted to also try the honey toast but I ran out of space in my stomach. I saw a table next to me order it, and it looked DELICIOUS. I'm going to try next time, which means I am planning on going back and trying more of their delectable tapas!   In terms of ambiance, it's good for a date, a night out with your girlfriends, or even a birthday party. Just make sure you make a reservation if you're going to have a big party, or even a small one. Prices are definitely reasonable for the type of food you get.   Be adventurous at Ichiza and you will be pleasantly surprised!",

We puzzled over many menu items and the large number of posted special menu items.  It added to the characteristic and \"fun\" factor for a small restaurant like Ichiza.  We enjoyed the grilled squid, the pork belly, and stir fried beef tongue.  The garlic chicken gizzard was tasty, but wished it was cut a bit bigger than the mini little chunks.  I would definitely come back to Ichiza again next time I visit Vegas!",

In my Lunch Set I picked Ginger Pork and the 'famed' MisoYaki Black Cod (of which a few Yelpers have been calling Miso Butterfish). Unfortunately, the Lunch Set was not that great, the MisoYaki Black Cod was a bit too salty for me. Ginger Pork was good but was just that.  However, the curry was spectacular because it also had bits of pork and onions in addition to carrots and potatoes! The flavor was also pleasing-- not too spicy but had a kick. The food was served piping hot and rather quickly.  Thanks for this one Yelpers!",

I kid you not.  Ichiza is a fabulous little restaurant of japanese food, tapas style. food is great! Our waitress was friendly and accommodating. You must try the black cod. That was heaven! The atmosphere is cozy, it reminds me of this little place in st marks in nyc. Similar food. Very japanese and tastes authentic. The only problem is that they also have hand-written menu all over the wall, which makes it a little hard to see.   I highly recommend this little restaurant and would totally go back here whenever i'm in sin city.",

    "text": "Ichiza, hope its just not me but everything I've heard about Ichiza I just can't agree with. You either absolutely love it or you just hate it. I wouldn't say I hated this place more on the side of I expected more from a place so hyped. Obviously this place is over hyped.   Japanese Dishes: 3/5 I ordered a Gyu don (beef bowl $5.50) I love Japanese beef bowls with a side of Mapo Tofu (spicy tofu $4.15). I wasn't too impressed by their recipe. Most mapo Tofu's I've tried are spicy and the sauce is a bit thick but at ichiza I felt it was really bland and soupy. The Gyu don tasted like a beef bowl, not a Japanese beef bowl it didn't taste authentic, I also felt like something was missing. The portions were also pretty small.   Sushi: 4/5 After reading a few reviews I thought I'd try the deep fried California roll. I'm not much of a roll person or a deep fried person and California rolls aren't even sushi. BUT it was actually pretty good, I also ordered the Dragon roll which was OVER SAUCED. Its suppose to be eel,cucumbers, and avocado drizzled with eel sauce for a bit of color and flavor, but I think they went sauce happy on my roll.   Alcohol: 5/5 The famous sake bombs at Ichiza, I suggest don't come here if its a date or a small group. Ichiza is known for big groups of drunks at their low tables slamming on the table doing sake bombs all night long!  Seating: 4/5 I like Ichiza's Japanese style ambiance. You can get seated around the bar (which doesn't give you much elbow room next to the person beside you) or at their tables. I love their low Japanese tables its something you have to try at least once.   Wait: 3/5 The wait here can be pretty long up to 45 min depending on the time and day you you. On the weekends I know this place gets pretty busy and it's small so seating is limited. Expect a wait.",

    "text": "3.8 for Vegas with the following notes:  If Ichiza were in Fountain Valley CA,  it would be like the Clippers and Shinsengumi/Honda family would be like the Lakers.  People will go to the Clippers game for the Clippers only if they're not playing the Lakers, but if Lakers are playing...we think \"who are the Clippers again\"?  Ichiza holds its own in Vegas, and offers something different and relatively cheap alternatives compared to the $$$$ restaurants in Vegas.  What I liked:  Yellowtail tar tar (we ordered 2) The monstrous bread dessert thing (see all the other reviews) Uni with ponzu (although, it was a teaser given the size)  What I'll pass on next time:  Red Snapper Carpaccio (I could do without the daikon) Pan fried gizzards Fried roe (lacked flavor), nice concept though =================================  Our meal ended up being $75 which includes tax, tip, 1 L Asahi and 1 S. Sapporo.  For all you big Shin Sen, Kappo Honda, Honda Ya fans.. I would still encourage you to come here if your goal is to have decent food that's reminiscent to what you're used to in OC.  With that said, don't expect anything beyond or even on par with what you're used to at home.  Note to the owners:  Kind of cool concept to put stuff on the wall, but it's a bit intimidating to stand in the middle of nowhere, trying to look behind a group of 30 people to see what to order.  For people with a mild form of social anxiety...this is not cool",

That's where all the good stuff is anyway including the \"Eel Kaarage tempura roll\" (or as I like to call it: the best thing that I have eaten in my entire life). You won't find any \"all you can eat\" sushi here but if you're looking for good, authentic Japanese fare, this is definitely the place to go.

Beef tongue - Tsukune and beef tongue are my tests for good yakitori and Ichiza delivered. Really good! Yellowtail tar tar - My favorite of the night. Kimchee fried rice - Nothing spectacular, but nice to have some rice to eat with some of the other items ordered. Fried chicken - Simple yet delicious, especially with the accompanying dipping sauce. Tsukune - Smaller in size than some, but super good! Eel tempura roll - Looked inventive, but essentially just an eel tempura roll. Good, but not great. Black cod - Buttery deliciousness. Honey toast - So very sweet. One person cannot finish this. In fact, three people cannot finish this.  Food came out at a good pace. Staff was attentive and friendly. The actual menu doesn't even touch on all the other items you can order. There are so many more items on the wall that I have to try next time.

The sake marinated grilled salmon belly, to me, was the star of all the dishes.  Its not something I see offered on a lot of menus and I'm a sucker for a nice piece of grilled fish.  All of this was excellent.    Ended the meal with the ever popular Honey Toast.  This is alwyas a treat and it looks like a present with an ice cream bow just waiting to be unwrapped.

On the other hand, I really don't want to do the work myself  - Honey toast - stale bread loaf with honey soaked in it   The service is nice.",

    "text": "Great izakaya!  It's definitely a place that you go to have drinks and eat small tapa style dishes. I LOVE TAKO WASABI and they have it here.  Everything is made really well so you won't be disappointed with anything that you order.  Kids can eat here too because they do have ramen and udon as well as fried rice dishes.  The honey toast was good,  but nothing too spectacular.  I would go back for the savory dishes before I go for honey toast.  The service was efficient and prompt.  Waitress gave good suggestions.  Not far from the strip.  Worth the trip.",

    "text": "I went here for a second (maybe third? don't know for sure, sometimes those drunken nights in Vegas gets lost in memory) time on my last Vegas trip.  We called ahead to make reservations and was able to get a reservation around 10pm for a party of 4 calling in the same day.  We were already drunk by the time we got to this place.  I dominated my Fat Tuesday yardstick in probably 45 minutes to make sure I was able to reset my palate to taste everything here.  Well, my tongue was refreshed, but I was pretty damn drunk.  Oh well.  We ordered a pitcher of beer and slowly ordered dishes.  The most memorable dish for me was the beef carpaccio.  So good!  The fried rice we had was pretty bomb too (can't remember which variety of that we ordered).  Bill was damn cheap.  We didn't drink too much (only a pitcher split between three people) but it was still cheaper than I had expected, takign that into consideration.  I think it was about $25ish per person.  I'll be trying out Raku next time I hit up Vegas (made reservations weeks in advance) but this isn't considered a consolation if I wasn't able to get reservations.  This place is amazing in it's own right!",

We ordered:  -oysters with ponzu sauce (great as always) -oysters with plum sauce (not bad) -oysters Saigon style (not bad) -sakana pinchos (pretty but not easy to eat, each piece is very big and a bit bland    some seasoning or special sauce would  have been nice) -spicy tuna roll (good quality but just average to me) -seared salad (good but had better) -beef liver skewer (yummy) -tykoyaki balls(a piece of squid deep fried inside a green oignon dough drizzled with sauce and red ginger on the side, very cute but the flavor are just ok) -mango and strawberry Mochi (cannot go wrong with that)  The items I really wanted was  -beef tongue (out of it, it was only 7h30pm) -sweet shrimps on lime (they were out of it) -uni over lemon with ponzu (never showed up even after asking 5 times for it for about an hour)  Iced green teas don't have free refill but wathever,  The only thing that is really bringing this place down is the service; this is a freakin war zone in there, waitresses shouting at each other from accross the bar...everybody is so god damn load in there, i would expect that kind of attitude at a sport bar during the playoff but not here, come on, there is a difference between casual athmosphere and jungle madness..It took them for ever to take our order(the place wasn't even as crowded than usual last night) and when it finally came up it was mixed up with an other table's order. And after asking many time about my uni she keep telling me \"1 more minut\" but that damn thing never showed up, this was the item that I was looking the most forward to...  Also forget about your drink reffill and you have to fake a panick attack to get your desert menu...  I may give it an other try only for the sweet shrimps over lime and that infamous uni and if I really crave ramen when monta is too packed...  Beside that, I really cannot wait for my reservation at Raku next Monday night, sound  much more promising!  Step up your game ichiza or you are definitely going down...",

    "text": "My Vegas go to man brought me here - it's on the top of his list, so he has to always bring us out-of-towners there!   I've been there a couple of times already and can definitely tell you this is one of those joints for only the locals.  No tourists would be venturing out over here.  All that much better!    When looking at the bar and all the special menu items posted on the wall, it can be quite difficult when deciding what to order.  So, when in doubt, let the expert go at it.  I fondly remember the fried smelt (less than $3 for three fish).  These plump babies are loaded up 'cuz their eggs are still sitting inside of them.  And with a little bit of salt and some fresh lemon juice, yum yum!  And who doesn't love ankimo?!  Monkfish liver that melts in your mouth...ahhhh...I love ankimo!  I've tried a bunch of other things there like the red snapper carpaccio with ikura, ramen noodles, the beef tataki w/ lemon juice, fresh oysters on the half shell w/ ponzu sauce (2 for $4.25), seaweed salad, and the beef cubes.  I don't remember anything bad about the place, but just good food with good company.  The first time I went, they had those fancy Japanese toilets with all those buttons to try out.  I attempted to use it but had no luck.  On my last visit, their special toilet was no longer there!  =(  I guess too many people were having way too much fun with it and it went into retirement.    If possible, go with a large group and sit in the back where you have to take your shoes off to swing your feet under the table.  And this way, you can also order a lot more random things and share them with everyone.  It makes it all that much merrier.  Overall, pretty extensive menu...I think I want some of that fried smelt roe just about now!  Bring it!  Updated: 10/10/06 - They also offer a FREE membership card.  You get 5% off whenever you dine there when you bring this card and it eventually adds up to 10-15% off your bill for next time.  I also like getting the Agedashi Tofu soup.  It's light and delicate without being overly infused with the bonito flakes.  Yum yum!  The salmon skin salad was okay.  The dressing overpowers the salmon skin, so you can't taste a whole lot.  I wouldn't bother getting it again.    The deep fried crabs are a plate of baby crabs with an aioli type dipping sauce.  An interesting taste and a nice crunch!   Side note: They give you a wet towelette thing and that will be your napkin for the entire meal.  Don't bother looking around for regular paper napkins here!  Updated: 11/27/06 - I recently tried the okra with natto (less than $3).  First off, the idea of natto grosses me out.  The texture alone is nasty, and the smell...geez, that's a whole other subject.  Since it was my dining partner's first time w/ the stuff, I suggested he give it a go at some a cheap price.  It comes with thin slices of fresh okra, seaweed slivers, and hot mustard on the side.  Overall, I would not recommend it unless you're a fan of this stuff.  I definitely am not one. Blah.    Also, the last two times I went, they were out of the lovely ankimo!  Argh!  Updated: 01/24/07 - I changed my ratings from four stars to five because I find myself craving the fried smelt roe more often than not.  And Ichiza has apparently become my comfort restaurant to turn to when I can't decide where else to go.  I have only been to one other izakaya, and that was Musha in Torrance, CA.  How can this place not be special?  Updated: 06/12/07 - Went back the past weekend after a few month hiatus.  They were out of uni and ankimo!  Argh!  But we had the beef tongue - tasty, and gotta eat it when it's hot; minced spanish mackerel on cucumber - fresh, lots of flavors on your palatte, fried garlic - put salt on it instead of the miso, and oh-so good!, tartar yellowtail - with avocado, crisp things, and salsa - refreshing flavors and light, and honey toast - they need more bread chunks, but yummy!  (They had a few new dishes that were listed in Japanese.  If you ask the waitresses or owner to translate, they'll try their best!  Be daring and give it a go!)  Update! 08/06/07 - Out of ankimo again!  Argh!  But they do have a soft shell crab appetizer that comes with a ponzu dipping sauce and Japanese mayonnaise.  It's a fatty crab with lots of meat!  Yum!  Their red snapper carpaccio is a bit different, it comes with olive oil, tomatoes, and mozzarella!    Update! 10/09/07 - Where the heck is all the ankimo?!  Argh!  Brought some out-of-town guests to Ichiza to experience where the locals eat.  Ate all the standard stuff, of course.  New thing tried here - live scallop.  I warn you now, don't sniff the squiggly things...it may turn you off!  But the scallop slices dipped in ponzu sauce is oh so tasty.  Also shared a ramen bowl.  I'm personally not a big fan of ramen (it's a filler), so I'll pass on it.  Everyone else seemed to swallow it down without any problems! =)  (I added some photos of my eats above!)",

There are a lot of options so it can accommodate everyone. We shared the half ramen, the black cod with miso, the fried chicken, the shishito peppers, and some other little bites. I liked the ramen and black cod, but probably wouldn't get the fried chicken (dry) or their yakitori again. There are so many items to try so it would be great to come with a large group to try a little bit of everything, especially since everything is served in smaller portions. The honey toast is a must so save room for dessert!",

After the first time, I had to go again on the weekend as well.  Killer eats to be had here.  First time in, it was Halloween Eve so everyone was decked out in funky costumes.  Oddly, even if it wasn't Halloween, it wouldn't have seemed out of place.  There were only two of us so we sat at the counter and ordered up a pitcher of Kirin, Beef Tongue, Buta Kim (stirfried pork with kimchee), Chicken Gizzard, Shishamo (smelt fish), fried chicken, spicy tuna roll, ramen, bacon wrapped mochi, ume chazuke (green tea over rice with pickled plum), and probably a few other things that aren't coming to mind.  Everything was excellent, and it was fun tricking my cousin into eating some \"weird\" stuff.  =)  Second time in was saturday night, this time with Emily and my mom-in-law joining us as well.  Pretty much ordered all the above plus shishito (twist pepper), sushi chazuke (it was basically a shishamo roll with a dip sauce), the chicken wings, chawanmushi, gyudon (beef bowl), oyakodonburi (chicken omelet rice bowl), natto okra (delicious!), kushi katsu (bite sized pork cutlet on a skewer with onion), and I'm sure I'm missing a few again.  Had a great time both times, and I'm sure to be back again next time I'm in town.  Pics are posted.  =)",

    "text": "Having been to Japan many times and having Izakaya style food has always been a delight for me.  I love going to these Japanese Pubs that focus on serving sake and drinks, an having tapas at the same time. There is some hit or miss with the food. The choice is outstanding, yet the quality is hit or miss. And, to get a bit more help from the servers would really help.  1.  The Hours - 5 star - Hey, going to an izakaya for several rounds of drinking and drinking and eating, this is the place to go. They are like open until 3 or 4 in the morning....  2.  The Food - 3.5  star - we ordered a ton of stuff  Food Choice - 5 Star - Awesome. From your basics to your noodles and rice, this place has everything.   Shishamo - 4 star - Very tasty overall, one order is 4 pieces of small grilled fish.   Bluefin Toro - 5 star - I like the large cuts they give you and bout 5 in each serving. We were looking for o-toro and they did not have it. Still good, flavorful, nice texture.  Marinated Grilled Chicken - 2 star - this was on their specials board, it kinda looked like Panda Express orange chicken, yet it was soggy and not really a texture that I would call, inspiring.  Taste was decent.   Calimari - 2 star - This is my fault, as I am not an expert, just a fan. I figured calimari would be lightly breaded and fried, this was sauteed squid and while I enjoy squid in all forms, I was really expecting something else. It was not bad, I ate a lot of it, since others did not.  Bok Choy - 3 star - We got two orders, so you know we wanted more. However, I am a huge bok choy fan.  The taste was great, nice garlic.  Just way over cooked. I like it al dente or just a bit more cooked than al dente. This was like real limpy.  Now I often overcook it at home when I am not paying attention and eat it all the time. I love it. Just that in restaurants I am picky and if I am paying for it, I want it perfect..... Again, we ordered a second serving, so the taste was good.  Shrimp Fried Rice - 3 star - Not bad at all. Not sure how all the drunks eat this though as the dish comes out with a serving spoon, but all of us had small tapas plates and chopsticks. No bowl, not easy to eat.  Good thing I like to pick up dishes and shovel food in my mouth with the chopsticks.  Do you think they saw me and recognized my Cantonese-esque eating habits?  Teba - 4 star - Love chicken wings.  Grilled on a grill, skewered.  These were overall flavorful in a simple grilled chicken way.  To me the teba has to be moist and they were.    Not sure which baby chick these little bits of a wing came from.  They were skinned (de-skinned?) spread and skewered and grilled. I guess I like big meaty wings grilled.  I should have maybe ordered 10 more plates.  Tsukune - 2 star - Little chicken meatballs. These were four 1 inch meatballs on one skewer. The taste was adequate, but kinda forgetful.  And, specifically I asked for how many were in order and she said four.  There were three of us. Would have been better if I asked how many three adult men should order.  These were like popping aspirin.  Good because they disappeared quickly.  Tai Carpaccio - 4 star - Red Snapper (Tai) raw.  Nice. Served on a bed of shredded daikon like vege and then on top of a sliced lemon.  3.  Ambiance - the look and feel 4 star.  Amount of seating - 3 star.  For an izakaya and people drinking, the toilet is a bit small.  2 star.  The air conditioning on a summer  day in Las Vegas 1 star.  Service 4 star sometime they know and don't know the menu items. They cannot or have a trouble to relate size of each dish so you know how to order.  They are all very pleasant, nice, smiling and make you feel welcome.  This is my third time to Ichiza, first time to get in. Parking is terrible, The restaurant will reserve tables so you can get there, it can be half ful and you cannot get it or you have to wait, in the heat, outside...  GK says, check it out for sure. Go off hours to get a quick table and enjoy izakaya style Japanese food. It is a great experience.",

The yellowtail sashimi is really good, fresh and tasty. Ethan had the ramen deluxe and beef bowl which are ok. The beef tongue yakitori tastes good and tender. Well, I mean for the food,I don't think it's surprising, I had sth much better in NYC, but for the price, I will go here next time. It's cheap and worth try. Seriously, they get tons of food u can choose. I will try sth else next time and maybe I will find excited food there. I believe their food are good.",

On my most recent trip, we ordered: - Gobo wrapped in pork skewers - Potatoes wrapped in beacon skewers  - Yakitori (skewered chicken) - Small ramen - Shrimp Gratin (it's like a creamy casserole but with rice instead yummm!!)

    "text": "Items selected include:    Deep Fried Tofu Mussel Cake with corn and carrots Pudding - Tofu Creme Caramel Honey Toast with Ice Cream Fried Quail Egg Mushroom Chawanmushi  ...my first day in Vegas always goes later than anticipated, but not for the same reason as others since it is usually a late night reservation at one of the restaurant's top tier restaurants that keeps me out late and True to form we could not get a seat at Kabuto until 9:00pm thus allowing plenty of time for small plates and sake beforehand at Ichiza, just across the street on Spring Mountain.  A venerable establishment amongst both tourists and locals long before Raku put LV's Chinatown on everybody's 'must visit' list I'd wanted to visit Ichiza during my past two visits to Sin City but both due to location and the rest of the city's eats it had always fallen on the 'next time' list until we literally found ourselves in the area with nothing else to do.  Small and tucked away on the second floor of a non-descript strip mall with a podium for check-in leading to a largely open floor plan with kitchen at center, seating at tables and bars (on chairs or on tatami style mats,) and menus hanging on walls all around Ichiza looks like chaos when you first enter and with seating tight the process of placing an order literally consists of walking around the room to figure out what you want as the chefs work quietly and vigorously churning out plate after plate.  With my pal conserving appetite and focusing on sake while I perused the options it would not be long before we placed our order - sitting, sipping cold sake, and taking in the scene.    Beginning first with the savories, though food didn't necessarily arrive in that order, a trio of options presented two excellent fried options, the quail eggs still jiggly on the inside with a golden exterior crunch and the mussel cake surprisingly vegetal and creamy thanks to the house made tofu and fresh corn.  Less successful, the smooth egg custard was spot on in texture but with the mushrooms only resting atop the chawanmushi the base was largely flavorless aside from salt and onion - even when mixed the only part really worth eating being the bits directly exposed to the fungus.    Moving on to sweets my selection of the tofu pudding was at our server's behest and unlike the chawanmushi this creamy custard was lovely, the silky texture somewhere between a True flan and something more dense like cheesecake, and as to the Honey Toast - it is enormous, it is delicious, and with the block of bread hollowed out and toasted to just short of crisp before being slathered in warm honey and topped off with a ball of ice cream it is best shared - particularly if you have dinner or drinking plans for later.",

The patty is moist and seasoned very well.  Then just a little bit of gravy to top it.  We can't resist.

The croquette didn't have enough cod roe taste in there.  It was still a good croquette, but more cod roe would have been better.

First time was my ex boyfriend came to visit so I intent to gave him a better impression after he dumped me so we sat at the sushi bar then he pointed at the wall and show me the HUGE cockroaches walking on the wall slowly across the bar, I was so stun but since I was such a LOYAL customer, I did not mentioned to the owner. I mentioned to the owner next time when I was there then the owner just looked at me for couple minutes and saying if NEXT TIME if I happen to see again, he will give me 10% off. WHAT?  NEXT TIME? he forgot how many times I already been there after all these 2 1/2 years? I mentioned to another management next time and got the same respond. I decide not to go this restaurant anymore. 1 month ago, I brought one of my new friend there for lunch then we saw the cockroaches again. I mentioned to the server that the reason I stop coming here because the cockroaches and now here's again and the owner's attitude. She did not do anything either. Couple days ago, I went to the restaurant tried to order the lunch special and I got there at 5PM sharp and the owner was calculating the total bill for the others and not even look me for a second, after couple minutes passed, he said the lunch was over at 5PM but I got there at 5PM, he did not even look at me.   I swear in my life that I would NEVER going to step into this restaurant again after I waste my life at here for more then 2 years. Isn't the customer service most important for the Japanese restaurant?  It's a pricy place and noisy and crowed place, just not sure why so many people go there for? You won't have a quality time for easily paying over $80+ for 2 people. The moist important is there's no SERVICE at all. The owner's attitude is even worth to hell. Don't get me wrong, I already ordered lunch special for over 50 times and their food has no problem at all but the owner is that kind of person since he sees so many customer coming up to the store, he forgot what's called SERVICE and APPRECIATION. He's taking for granted especially for a long term customer.   Not only this restaurant is dirty, noisy and crowed and you have to wait for at least 1 hour in the night and also you will for sure join the dinner with the other insects if you are still want to go. Good luck for the people who still going.  I am terribly upset right now when I am writing this post. I wish I had never spend that much money & time to this restaurant in my life.",

A party occurred in my mouth at first bite. The broth is unlike anything I had ever tasted....maybe a miso and beef broth? The noodles were eggy and delicious as were the little bits of onion and cabbage inside. 2 girls sitting next to me admired my ramen and ordered it themselves. Every bite was the best and I can't wait to return. Thank you, Jesus, for Ichiza!!!  KUMPAI!!!!!  p.s. Including splitting a large Soporro and our bill was less than $25.",

That is a sign that the food is incredible here.   Ichiza has two sets of menu. They have a menu on paper and menu on the wall. The paper lists all the noodles, skewers and DIY handrolls. The menu on the wall lists all the tapas. I didn't have to think twice - I went for the tapas!   Tapas were delicious! I think Ichiza is the best Japanese tapas place - EVER. I have been to two other Japanese tapas place in California (Honda-Ya in Fountain Valley) and Furaibo (LA). Ichiza is better than these two places because of creativity.   My friend and I ordered Yellow Tail Tar Tar, Tom Yum Roll, Oysters, Tofu Salad with sashimi, okonomiyaki, and Red Snapper Carpaccio. And since my friend and I both loved the Tom Yum Roll, we ordered it twice. Yes, it was that good. Of all the dishes that we ordered, I esp loved the Yellow Tail Tar Tar and Tom Yum Roll.

Unfortunately I only discovered it during my last 6 months or so thanks to my late night dinners with my japanese yoga guru Yuko. This is the best Izakaya I have ever been to. If you like organs than you are in business, the liver stew is to die for. The sake and soju cocktail selections are wonderful as well.  You must go there with an open mind and an empty stomach to truly enjoy your dining experience. Warning you may feel as if you some how time warped from Sin City to Shinjuku. Don't worry if you O.D. on the sake you can always go downstairs to Zizzy's to sing your self sober with some karaoke.",

    "text": "Best Japanese Curry I've Ever Had!  BF and I arrived for lunch around 1 PM and the place was full.  There were only two employees seating people, taking orders, cleaning tables, etc.  So the wait was much longer than it should have been.  We were finally seated about 15 mins after we arrived.    The two ladies were super friendly and tried to move as fast as possible to keep customers happy.  We were on vacation so I didn't mind too much having to wait a little longer.  We ordered the curry with pork cutlet and fried oysters to share.  OMG...the curry was heavenly!  and the portion was enough to make the both of us full.  The cutlet was tender and fried to perfection!  The oysters were also very juicy and yummy!  The order came with about 6-7 pieces.     Our total, including tax and tip, came out to just under $20!  This was definitely one of our cheapest and most satisfying meals of the trip.  Thanks to my sis for the recommendation!  I'd love to come back during evening hours and try some of their tapas.  But if you're ever there for lunch, get the CURRY!",

The wait was quite long (45 minutes) which I was prepared for because of what I read in previous reviews. The place was tight and small but  seemed to look like the happening place to be. The food was pretty good (miso butterfish, garlic bok choy, fried duck gizzards, rice, yakitori and ramen) along with the sake and glasses of wine that my bf and I consumed. However, the honey toast was my least favorite. It was too sweet for my liking. The overall experience was great but I can't say that I'd wait another 45 minutes to do it all over again.",

    "text": "Ichiza has becoming one of my favorite izakaya restaurant! They're constantly reinventing tasty menu items, with affordable prices around $7 per dish.   I've the pleasure of trying out some of their new items on my last visit to Vegas, they were:   1. Mochi Ravioli stuffed with Tuna (4 pieces $6.75): The chewiness of the mochi wrap compliments well with the tenderness of the tuna, drizzled with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette, it was perfect in every bite.   2. Seared Scallop wrapped with Salmon Sashimi (2 pieces $5): The texture was great, but the shiso leaf was a bit over powering.   3. Mochi topped with Uni (2 pieces): Warm chewy grilled mochi topped with decadent texture of uni, set on a piece of nori paper, it was fantastic, tasted even better with a lil dip in the wasabi soy sauce.   4. Yellow Tail Tar Tar (4 pieces $6.95): warm rice in between 2 pieces of crispy chips topped with chopped yellow tail and guacamole, it was tasty.   5. Mochi wrapped with Bacon Skewer ($1.50): Everything tastes better with bacon wrapped around it!   6. Shabu Shabu Salad ($6.50): Large pieces of shabu shabu meat mixed with cooked spinach and lettuce, with bits and pieces of chicken skin tossed with sesame dressing. It was filling, and pretty tasty, but can do without the chicken skin though.   7. Beef Tongue Skewer ($1.50): The beef tongue was flavorful, but not as tender as I was hoping for.   It's not a complete meal without their Butter Honey Toast, topped with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream! The warm buttery doughy toast just melts in your mouth with the cold ice cream, it's such a great treat, and everyone should try it at least once! If you don't believe me, on the way out, I even saw a guy enjoying Butter Honey Toast all by himself  and was smiling at it too....so, now you know how delicious this dessert must be, or may be he was just simply crazy? : )",

    "text": "Tapas! Japanese style.  This is probably the most apt description I can think of when describing Ichiza and it's menu. The majority of the menu at Ichiza consists of prepared dishes on small plates or bowls that cost no more than $6 each. There are Sushi dishes, but this is not a Sushi place. You will order a multitude of small plates that can vary from appetizers to fried plates to soups to salads to desserts that you will combine together in a meal.   That is... if you can get a seat in the restaurant. If you don't have a reservation... there could be problems of a wait that could be close to thirty minutes. But the wait is well worth it.  What Kathy, my daughter, and I ordered...  Salmon Skin Salad topped with Salmon Roe - Great! Broiled Cod - Superb! Deep Fried Octopus with mild whole Green Chile - deelicious! Fried Chicken, stir fried in a red-pepper sauce mixture Clams in a Miso-like Soup base Fried, thinly sliced, Chicken Gizzards with String Beans - Very Good! Beef Tataki with Ponzu Sauce Dip Three bowls of plain Japanese Rice Banana Filled Crepe - Obviously made beforehand and refrigerated.     Would have liked this Crepe freshly made and warm. It was OK,     though. Two glasses of sweetened Tea  In summary... one of the best Japanese restaurants in Las Vegas. My daughter's favorite Japanese... now also mine.  Before I leave Las Vegas... want to try one of their desserts... bread with Ice Cream.... impressive!  FYI: Try Tea Station directly under Ichiza in the same mall... Tea Station serves Taiwanese snacks / meals in similar small portions along with their Tapioca Teas. A different interpretation of Tapas-style meals from Taiwan.  Comment: It is utterly amazing to me that institutions, considered low-class in their original country, can find great success here in the United States! This type of establishment in Japan would only attract the office worker crowd after work for drinks and tidbits of food - after import into this country and you have a five-star restaurant that attracts more people than some fine-dining establishments. AMAZING! Can only happen in the good ol' US of A. Another good example is Pho in the Vietnamese community. I know of former street vendors peddling Pho on streetcorners in Vietnam now driving a couple of Mercedes vehicles and having a handful of restaurants in Los Angeles!",

The five of us ate ourselves through roughly 15-20 dishes and left very full but happy campers. I was not that impressed by all things fried: the Wasabi Green Bean Tempura was OK, but not stellar and the Katsu was actually just so-so and quite dry.  But everything else (sashimi, the rolls, the delicious beef, the broiled mackerel and salmon, ...) was very yummy. Some things a bit heavy on the butter, but yummy.  One hint: it's definitely worse to invest the time and neck-kink to read all the specials that are tacked up all over the walls, those were the best dishes we had!  Oh, and including beers and tip, we walked out for just under $30 per head. 4 very satisfied stars!",

With the number of Japanese Americans in the bay area, WHY CANT THERE BE A DECENT IZAKAYA?!?  WHY!  Ichiza, please come to the bay.  I'll come every weekend I promise.  Anyway.  With the help of you yelpers, I made up my mind to come to Ichiza the day we arrived in Vegas because  knew this place was open til 3.  We lugged our luggage in like True tourists and just started ordering off the wall and getting a bottle of Sapporo.  We had all sorts of things that night but the uni in ponzu sauce was TO DIE for.  It was the best thing ever i wanted to order like 10 of them.  Each little dish is meant for you to drink some beer with and savor and sample.  I'd love to come with a BUNCH of people and just order all types of food.  We also tried their spicy kara-age (good), miso cod (good), fried oysters (really good) and I wanted to try a lot of other stuff too but we were full. The noodle dishes here looked amazing and their little donburis looked good too.  It's comfort food and places like this that make me miss my mom's cooking and Tokyo. DAMMIT.  Prices were reasonable, service was good, atmosphere ROCKED.  It's a lil out there if youre staying near the strip.  Best meal I've had in a while.",

Perfectly seasoned, and is good with the chili powder spice they have. Also had the albacore sushi. It was fresh, tender, and buttery on the palette. Very delectable. I personally recommend having some hot sake (especially if it's cold out), it warms your heart and compliments the meal. Service was amazing as always, but don't stifle if you have to wait for a table however. It does get busy and there's a good cause behind it.",

    "text": "Sad but True, this place really did not live up to the hype that it's garnered on yelp. On that fateful day last weekend, me and the hubby rolled up to this upstairs location and were politely greeted by the wait staff. Looking around, it seemed quite empty but of course that could be because we were there literally within 5 minutes of their opening hour. With hunger pangs gripping at my stomach after a full day of gambling and walking around the Las Vegas strip I was ready to pounce on anything that our waitress brought out.   Even as hungry as I was there was no redeeming quality to the bacon wrapped asparagus that was brought before us. Unlike the other yakitori concoctions that we have had at other izakaya's in California, this one lacked the smoky charred goodness that makes you want to come back for another bite. Worst yet, they somehow stuck me with the oldest asparagus spears on the market as I literally had to spat out the fibrous outside tissues...ummm..yeah...it wasn't pretty.   To add insult to injury my miso cod was overly salty, which I understand is sometimes is the case, but I've yet to experience a Japanese restaurant that left as many bones in their cod fillet as this place. I was spitting bones out one after the other. I think the chef at the counter saw me do this and darted his eyes away.   Suffice to say we probably will not be coming back here the next time we are in town. Love Japanese food, love izakayas, but definitely did not love this place.",

When I get the beef bowl, I also get the Vegas Unagi tempura roll. You can't fit the whole thing in your mouth. They tempura dip the lobster mix or crab mix (I forget) and it layers on top of the roll. It's also a great place to have a few cold ones with friends.

The seating can be tight and friendly, but sometimes the employees forget about me.  They have good food, but sometimes I get something meant for another table (and I eat it anyway, because, hell, I'm hungry from waiting).  All that would normally spell three stars from me.  But...  ...before I get to my rating, here's what was right with Ichiza on my most recent trip:  1.  Bacon wrapped mochi - My two favorite items in one sticky, savory mess.  2.  Sake marinated salmon - I could eat four orders with a bowl of rice and be a happy camper. 3.  Baby bok choy - So simple, yet I can't replicate this at home.  This will make someone allergic to greens change their tune. 4.  Agedashi tofu - Perfect texture and always executed well. 5.  Grilled ika - Sometimes overcooked, but always tasty. 6.  Geso age - These little baby octopi flash fried in an extraordinarily light batter makes my tummy smile and my mouth growl (when someone tries to take one from me). 7.  Seared ahi belly - Not the most interesting dish, but def a pleaser. 8.  Honey toast - Bread.  Honey.  Ice Cream.  Yum.  I have no idea how much this stuff costs, all I know is that we're usually down at least a Benjamin by the time we're outta here.  Oh, and add to that they have a good sake list.  Small, but they have stuff you can't really get at many of the other Japanese joints around Vegas.    So, back to my rating.  The wait can't be helped; they're small and people are always coming back for more.  Being forgotten is a huge negative in my book and something they really need to remedy.  Maybe it's just a function of how busy they are (in which case they need to hire more people), but I don't know.  However, the food is good and I usually get to try someone else's order to expand my taste buds.   At the end of the day, I keep coming back for the food despite the shortcomings.  And that's kind of says it all, doesn't it?",

It was absolutely delish!   After they re-opened, I visited more often. Their honey toast is a must-eat! Make sure to get to the place after 3pm though. They aren't there during breakfast hours. To make up for that, they close pretty late too (3am during weekdays and 2am on sundays)   Hygiene-control, however might need a little more attention. A friend of mine traced a tiny cockroach in the bar by the kitchen once and my family noticed multiple black stains on the couches when we dined in last Sunday. Other than that, the friendly waiting staff and overall food quality's good enough to stop by for a visit.",

    "text": "A very well rounded japanese restaurant! Back where I'm from (yay Canada!) japanese restaurants are primarily AYCE restaurants run by chinese people, and all their menus look the same. Ichiza however, offers a unique menu, and combination of flavours that I have never seen or heard of anywhere else! (ex. bacon wrapped mochi..who would've thought of that! )   Overall, I would definitely recommend a big group so you can try most of their menu, and believe me, it is certainly worth the try! If I were to offer criticism though I would say that the Bread thing with ice cream is kind of over hyped. Didn't find it all that special. It was yummy, but nothing unique. At the end of the day though Ichiza is probably my favourite japanese restaurant by far :)",

We were seated right away (bear in mind this was on a weekday and we came in just as they opened).  The place was cozy and you can see the kitchen staff preparing the food.  I knew this place was going to be authentic...the kitchen staff were Japanese!  There are other Japanese restaurants that I've been to in the bay area and the kitchen staff are not Japanese.  We were a little overwhelmed with the selection, even though they provided a menu for us the restaurant had placed a variety of different items on the wall that was not on the menu.  We kept on looking at the wall for the things to order vs. the menu since it looked like there were more items on the wall than the menu.   We told our server we have never been at the restaurant before and asked for her recommendation.  She was extremely helpful and told us what the most popular dishes were.  We ordered the following:  Grilled squid - yummy! Marinated fried chicken - our favorite dish Grilled black cod - this was my 2nd favorite! seared beef  Sea Urchin Oysters Agedashi tofu - same as any other restaurant but had to get my this since I love tofu Shrimp & Eggplant Sushi with tuna and spinach Beef tongue & chicken gizzard skewers Honey toast for dessert  The food was AMAZING!  We were so stuffed by the time dessert came around but I HAD to try the honey toast.  The honey toast is a great creation, I would have never thought about that but now that I have tasted it I can easily make this at home for the kids to try.  It's good but nothing to go out of the way to eat if you have had it once.  The next time we go back to Vegas, we're definitely going to come back!",

    "text": "The first thing you have to know about Ichiza is that most of the good stuff is NOT on the menu.  Rather, the majority of menu items are posted on little sheets of paper filling all 4 walls.  And unfortunately, the wait staff is often so busy that they don't have much time to explain what half of these items are.  Fortunately, regular customers will!  Taking the advice of our next-door table, we had a great meal.  Just wish we had been able to come back to try a few more items.  The food is very Japanese in that while it has a lot of traditional dishes like Oyakodon, it also has some very interesting Japanese takes on american foods. We didn't go too adventurous this time (we'll have to do that when we go back) and got the following Ika Rings Pork fried Udon Spicy Tuna Roll and a few other items I'm forgetting now.  However, the dish that made our meal was the Honey Toast, which they should really call the \"Honey Loaf\".  It's seriously half a loaf of bread toasted (the insides are amazingly fresh and doughy) covered with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream and a healthy layer of honey. Perfection. God damn it's good. Thankfully my wife was nearly full so I got to have some of her half as well.",

My friends and I came for some of their delicious honey toast after having dinner somewhere else. After taking our orders, our server gave us an attitude as she took our plates away. Perhaps it's because we ordered just desserts and drinks? I didn't see what the problem was since it was late Tuesday night and the place wasn't packed.  Five people from our group ordered hot/iced coffee and the server brought only 1 small cup of sugar & 1 equally small cup of cream. For FIVE coffees? Really? Oh and those watered down iced coffees & small cups of hot coffee also cost us $4.50 each. So for 3 honey toasts and 6 drinks (1 was a soda), the bill came out to $52. That was more expensive than the delicious BBQ ribs we had for dinner before coming to this place. I am so disappointed!",

I am surprised how could Mona C. took a photo with no customers inside because this restaurant is packed all the time. We had dinner here twice and had to sit by the sushi bar both times because all tables were full. They have a huge selection of dishes and I love the decorative menus on the wall. Don't look at the regular menu they give you. Look up on the wall and those are the great dishes.  We've tried the tofu salad with sashimi $7.50 (very very yummy!), squid soft-bone fritter $4.50 (great with sake or beer), miso butterfish $7.75 (delicious), grilled salmon belly $5 (super yummy!), beef tongue stew $8.50 (the sauce was too thick and rich, it could fill your stomach in a second), one small bottle of house sake $5.75 (just ok), seared tuna with ponzu sauce $6.25 (ok), grilled eggplant and shrimp $6.50 (little sour and spicy - good). Most dishes were delicious, but somewhat inconsistent. We had the same dish twice in two different nights(around 6:30pm) and the taste was different. Also a lot of the dishes on the wall were sold out, so we couldn't try the uni and toro.   We also tried a glass of tomatchu $5.50, which was a mixture of shochu sake and tomato juice. It tasted just ok, not enough tomato juice and not enough sake. We had the famous honey toast $6.50 for dessert. By looking at the photos from Yelp, I thought it was a big scoop of butter on the top. But actually it was vanilla ice cream. Very unique, yummy, and filling!  The waitresses were polite and attentive even they were busy. The price was awesome and unbeatable. I highly recommend this restaurant. And if you go, go early or make reservation ahead of time. Oh remember, they don't open lunch on weekends.",

The food is consistently good and once you're in from possibly waiting then the service is pretty good. They have daily specials and aside from their menu they have items all over their walls. They really should update their menus or figure something out. They have so many things to choose from that people never know of because they can't read the walls.

It reminded us of the izakaya style servings from Japan and there were pictures of the food on the walls in addition to some repeated on the actual menu (with misspellings and all). It had a laid back, relaxed vibe. We were starving and wanted something filling, so we got the udon and ramen and a side of maki roll. The food came out fast and tasted on point! We were both pleasantly surprised. The whole experience was reminiscent of our visits to Japan, although it obviously is much different but the closest we could get to (there aren't many options in Orlando!).  If we had a chance to revisit the Las Vegas area, this place would be on our list.",

I am so glad I braved the flight upstairs in my 4 inch heels to check out the restaurants on the second floor of this building.  The small space was pretty full so I figured it had to be good.  We sat at the bar and ordered off the photo menu posted above us:  -  uni in ponzu sauce -  yellowtail tar tar -  black cod (bufferfish) -  pork belly with egg  Everything was absolutely delicious!!!  The uni was very fresh and I loved how the lemon and cucumbers toned down the brininess of it.  The pork belly melted in your mouth and the yellow tar tar was awesome.  The presentation of each dish was very clean and simple and they pay attention to balancing textures and flavors.    This was by far my best meal during this Vegas trip.  I am craving the uni and yellowtail tar tar.  If I had one complaint is that I think I got the last of the uni so it was a little watery and lost in form.  Other than that, I'm a fan.",

Everything we tried was tasty and the price was right.  The Honey Bread is downright sinful (but in the best possible way) and the noodles are the perfect texture. Beef tongue was tender, the garlic gizzards are worth ordering and the miso butter fish just melted in my mouth.  The menu is huge and can be overwhelming.  I found it helpful to look at what other diners were ordering and order it too!",

It's a small place, so it'll take awhile if you come with a large group.   Food: 1) Beef tongue - If you like the texture of tongues, then you'll like it. It was flavorful, but some of my other friends didn't like it because of its texture. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ichiza-las-vegas?select=Z50FudnbVN6ZBijm1ZbHkw#MRiWPQNDdzQCkixIA1dyJQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/ichi...</a> 2) Beef Bowl tastes just like Yoshinoya, but with much better beef quality and without the post-meal coma. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ichiza-las-vegas?select=Z50FudnbVN6ZBijm1ZbHkw#gZx7dyZbOl6wM_mgAJGEWg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/ichi...</a> 3) Yellowtail Tartare was layered like a sandwich with chips instead of bread and topped with avocado and yellowtail poke. The fish was fresh and the sauce was delicious. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ichiza-las-vegas?select=Z50FudnbVN6ZBijm1ZbHkw#GUUzqj8B-3qeH4fXYtwVQg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/ichi...</a> 4) Miso Black Cod was buttery and soft. It was cooked to perfection! There was just enough miso for the right amount of flavor, so it wasn't overpowering. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ichiza-las-vegas?select=Z50FudnbVN6ZBijm1ZbHkw#jaRWq-B8P--y_9RtXJrNGA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/ichi...</a> 5) Fried Calamari - It wasn't that great.

(Note: review originally posted 02/23/11) So I ate here for the first time about two weeks ago and totally fell in love with the place that I wanted to book it for my (cancer) remission celebration. But when I had my return trip it was as the three stars say, \"A-OK\". Not saying that I wouldn't return, I would but I think I'd probably eat down the road at Cathay House or up the road at Joyful.   I ate a lot of the yelp suggestions and that's why it gets an \"A-OK\" because everything was \"A-OK\". From the chicken gizzard to the shrimp and eggplant to the yellowtail tartar to the honey toast. Not that they didn't taste good but it's not like they blew my socks off either.",

Again, the ramen is not my fav in town, but still very good and fresh.   I come here for the fresh seafood. The grilled mackerel and squid are very good. Can't go wrong with the crab fried rice as well!   Also went with the butter clams and a few other goodies. All pretty tasty!   Prices are pretty reasonable too :)  Pork Kim Chi and Red Snapper Sashimi :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ichiza-las-vegas?select=_r_afKZlImDUJNXE38em9w#_r_afKZlImDUJNXE38em9w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/ichi...</a>  Good rendition on the kim chi...the snapper came with a bunch of other citrus and misc that kind of hid the flavor of the fish, but was still enjoyable.

I ordered a few chicken yakitori and some veggie fried rice. Both were just alright. Chicken tasted pretty gassy (like grill fumes) and the fried rice looked like it was literally fried for 2 seconds. Fry the dang rice! Still palatable.  I know this place isn't meant to be fancy at all, but the menus were so beat up and hard to read! Many of the items had \"SOLD OUT\" taped over them, especially on the bev menus. Just get new ones printed guys. Geez.  Now for the honey toast....Didn't wanna get a big one because the girl with me doesn't really do sweets, so we opted for a mini. It showed up with fruit and red bean paste all over it. The purist in me was kinda disappointed. Why would the mini have so much more stuff on it than the big daddy? Kinda bizarre. At any rate, we scraped the beans off and it was just okay. I'll stick to my korean coffee shop toast for sure.  Not certain if I'll be back...Plenty better Jaoanese options in the city.",

But they also have tables and bar siting. I sat at the bar when we came here. The service was great and the food. Omg it was so delicious. Everything we order I did not have any complaints about. They had a lot of Japanese street food that I never heard of or try before. So it was really cool to be able to try it out. Plus the price is super cheap for great quality of food  I got. I spent $40 bucks and got 5 dishes. I'm definitely coming back here again to get my Japanese craving fix.",

There were so many things we wanted to try but we didn't want to order too much & not be able to finish it all! We ordered the seaweed salad, salmon sashimi, spicy tuna rolls, beef tataki, the big amazing cut up squid, & chicken wings on a skewer.   The salmon sashimi was soooo tender. It tasted so fresh & it just melted in my mouth. Yum! I have no complaints about anything I ate here & the service was very quick & our waitress was nice, fast, kept our waters filled, & made sure all of our plates were cleared off our table as soon as we finished each one.   I had an awesome experience here & I can not wait to return & try more items on their menu!",

We go here for their grilled squid, salmon sashimi, and also their beef tatake (so good) and shrimp fried rice. They're all pretty small, little bit like tapas but we order enough to share. But mostly we're here for the HONEY BRICK TOAST.  Honestly it's just a huge brick of toast with scoops of vanilla ice cream drowning in honey for days. The warm toast melts the ice cream and just sucks up all of the sweet honey, so, if you're sharing you low key should keep the middle part to yourself and have your significant other eat the crust. Jk (not really). I share I promise.",

Lots to choose from. Everything on the menu plus added menu items on the wall are all available to order. Anything from vegetable croquettes , albacore carpaccio, ramen to yakitori like tsukune and tebasaki.  Some noted yummy dishes include: yamaimo (mountain yam) tempura, deep fried squid cartridge, red snapper carpaccio (don't eat the lemon slices with it), ikura oroshi, unagi kakiage roll, and of course the bread toast thingy with honey and ice cream :) Great service and the food was on point.

My favorites were: grilled makerel marinated in miso (to die for!), grilled whole squid, eel + tempura sushi roll, pork belly ramen (kakuni), tuna sashimi, deep fried tofu (so delicate and awesome), egg custard (solid staple), & yellowtail carpaccio. And reasonably priced for $65.   If there's something you don't see on the menu or taped up on the walls, ask the servers bc they might still have it or may prepare it for you.   The misses were: deep fried octopus balls. I guess it was just that one thing. Non food complaints would be that we needed to grab our server whenever we needed something. The seats were placed a little close (the party next to us was talking about their dating lives - read: waaaay too much info if you know what I mean). Also not a ton of parking. But those things outweigh how delicious the food was.  We got there a little before six on a Wednesday, and called on the way over to make a reservation. I would definitely recommend that bc there were two big tables reserved when we arrived, and there's not a ton of seating (~45-50). Mix of tables, and bar/counter seating.   Place feels like a neighborhood joint, which I love. Super casual, pretty nice view bc it's on the second floor of a random Chinatown plaza. This would be a great late nite eating spot too!",

    "text": "What: izakaya. I'm on a quest to eat at all the izakaya's since moving here from the Bay Area. However, the bar is high with my measuring stick being Tanto in Sunnyvale, CA. I wanted to start with Raku, but they were booked solid. Ichiza was ok, but no where near the awesomeness that is Tanto.  Food: chicken ball skewer - tasty, but was a little lukewarm pork and chiso skewer - meh, I would not reorder buta kakuni - came with half an egg, nice size serving, very tasty/tender. tuna tartar - this was tasty and nice combo of textures. i would reorder this. tuna/tofu salad - tasty dressing! slices of avocado and cherry tomatoes. Refreshing. grilled rice ball - this has nothing inside. my hubby liked it. jellyfish - meh, won't reorder agedashi tofu - good chicken karaage - as expected, but I like the karaage better at Fukumimi Ramen chu-toro sashimi - on the specials menu, my japanese mom thought the quality was really good and she's the expert on chu-toro  unagi tempura roll - this was large and awkward to eat, but  small unagi bowl - was a hit with my kid tempura - authentically served with daikon and dipping sauce. This was large and had lots of veggies and 2 large shrimp hot tea - maybe they don't have green tea? They gave me barley tea, so that was a disappointment. Too full to try dessert!  Pet peeve: all the good stuff is written on the walls throughout the restaurant, like other Yelpers mentioned. This is REALLY annoying. What am I supposed to do - wander around and peer over other diners' tables to read the wall? Well, yes, that is exactly what I had to do because none of this is on the menu. Update your menu with the wall stuff people!! Sheesh!  Ambiance: small restaurant with tables, bar seating and japanese style seating where you take of your shoes and your feet dangle down under the table.  Service: efficient, but could be friendlier. They messed up the reservation and only had us down for 4 people, when it was 5, but they accommodated us at a small table and then moved us to a larger table when it freed up and before we ordered, so thank goodness!  Location: Chinatown on Spring Mountain. Easy parking in shared lot in a plaza. The line was out the door when we left!",

My group of 3 didn't have to wait to be seated on a Friday afternoon. We were seated in a large booth which we had to share with other guests. No biggie. It's a real traditional Japanese place because we had to put our shoes away as we were seated. We tried what most reviewers talked about. The squid that everyone raved about was great. It took a little longer to prepare but for the portion & taste, it did not disappoint! The beef from the ramen dx was incredible! I wish I ordered extra beef. The quail egg & uni ponzu shooters was worth trying but not my cup of tea. The beef tataki was thinly sliced so I gladly ate it even though it's more on the rare side. Absolutely loved this experience!   Just be ware if you order one of their Japanese wines for 10$ it's not actually a glass but more of a shot.",

Just think of a traditional Japanese ramen bar setting - even though they offer so much more than just ramen! They even have an old traditional style table in the back of the restaurant where you take off your shoes and all.   Because it is tapas style, it's great when you want to try a little bit of everything. From sushi, ramen, rice bowls, skewers, and amazing desserts (like the honey toast, aka, box of looove), they have it all! And for a decent price too! My favorites are their rice bowls and tuna tar tar.  The only downside of this place is that it's fairly small and gets pretty packed quick. Also, some of their off the menu items are plastered around the restaurants so you kind of have to squint around lookin' like a fool. hahah.",

Cue Ichiza, a low key Japanese izakaya (bar-style food) with a Japanese staff and Japanese patrons. Okay, now we know you ain't messin' around. Icicle Christmas lights strung around a warm, bustling restaurant with staff zipping around to bring food out and refill glasses.  Don't agonize on Yelp about what to eat. Just go. Order anything and everything that sounds good, and most of them will be incredible and enjoyable, especially the raw dishes. There's a daily menu of fresh specials as well as the regular menu with countless more hot and cold dishes. Just eat everything.  Food comes out lightning here, which is perfect for hangry girls like me, especially as there will probably be a wait in the evening unless you show up quite early. End the night up with a honey toast. I'm a fatass who loves dessert, so if there are more than 2 people, get the full size one and enjoy each bite.   Eat great even late! Open until 2:30AM. One of my favorite out of 50+ Vegas restaurants that I've Yelped!",

    "text": "Ichiza is a very interesting restaurant.  Their ramen is very non-traditional. They add in a multitude of unexpected ingredients including sprouts, cabbage, etc. that don't add much to the experience.  Their broth is also not very thick but more watery and more loosely textured, which I was not too big of a fan of.  In terms of flavor the ramen was not up to par either.  I need to also add that they throw in a huge hunk of pork instead of slicing it (see photo).  We also tried their red snapper sashimi which I thought tasted pretty fresh.  I've fished my own red snapper and prepared it fresh before so this was very on par with that.  They also lace the fish with some salmon eggs for added flavor which was a very nice touch.  Their menu system is also very bazaar.  They have a traditional menu which is basically a laminated piece of paper that is folded but our waitress also mentioned that there are many specials that are not on the menu but actually located on the walls throughout the restaurant..  Those specialty menus are hand written paper with really poor pictures printed from a printer from 1984.  The staff there are very nice and attentive however which earned them a few stars back IMO.  There is plenty of parking there since there's a lot so no worries on that front.  If you are near the area I would stop in for a quick bite but if you want high quality japanese food / sushi, I would not recommend this since only a limited number of their items seemed to be of good quality.  Their raw sushi and rolls seemed to be on point if you want to play it safe there. Their uni is also a must try btw. Very fresh",

I also had the three kinds of sashimi and the rainbow salad to balance the meal.  For the price, the rainbow salad was generously portioned. Then my mushroom udon came out and I thought I'd never finish this big bowl. The cool, wet weather and a long day meant I was slurping the bottom before I realized it. The sashimi was good - especially the mackerel. All in all the food was solidly 4 stars.  I sat at the bar where I had a good view of the  surroundings. Several groups were there with their luggage from Tokyo still in tow, so you know this will be an authentic experience. Next too me were several regulars who the staff new by name. Regulars and visitors alike received friendly and attentive service.  I'll be back next time I'm in Las Vegas.",

But what would we thought would be a simple midnight snack turned into a full-fledged meal.  The two stand-outs were the yellowtail tar tar and the seafood quesadilla.   The yellowtail tar tar is a hit on yelp so it was a must for us and of course it lived up to our expectations! The dish had an interesting mix of flavors that was strong but not to the point that it was overwhelming. Even though I'm not a huge fan of avocado (don't hate me), I was surprised to find myself enjoying it on the dish!  The seafood quesadilla aka the whole party's favorite definitely caught us off guard. We did not expect to love it as much as we did! When we first saw this food item featured on the wall, we were slightly hesitant because it seemed kind of odd. But we were feeling adventurous and just decided to order it! We're glad we did because it's so aesthetically pleasing AND better yet it tasted as good as it looked! You're able to taste the wide array of seafood on top of the pancake and the pancake itself had a slight crunch to it that was just perfect. Do yourself a favor and get it!  The servers at Ichiza were so friendly and accommodating as we kept on adding on to our list of orders. Thank you so much!  We'll be back soon!",

My favorites were the beef tataki, hamachi sashimi, and the buta kimchi. 7 dishes was more than enough for the two of us and everything was so unique and delicious.

    "text": "My favorite Japanese restaurant in town.   Environment: The interior is rather small but very cozy. The lighting is warm and bright and seating includes regular tables, a large family table, sushi bar and a more private area which is great for reservations. However due to the size of the restaurant, there can be a wait so I typically call ahead if I am coming with a few friends. Additionally, the plaza does not have a ton of parking so that is something to keep in mind as well.  Food: The food is amazing! The menu is extensive and they additionally have many specials posted on the wall around the restaurant. There is everything from grilled seafood, sashimi, noodle dishes, etc. Additionally, the portions are small enough that you can try a lot of things without getting full too early, while also being able to share with your friends. A couple of my favorite dishes are the Tartar Yellowtail, Red Snapper Carpaccio, Grilled Butterfish, Beef Tataki, and the NegiToro Tartar with Quail Egg. Everything is very fresh and delicious.  Service: Service is usually good as well. The servers do get a little busy but due to the smaller interior and open floorplan if you need anything it does not take long to get somebody's attention.   All in all, this has been a restaurant that I have frequented for years and a place I love to go with friends and family to eat and drink for hours and make great memories!",

There are so many menu items to choose from and each one unique and delicious, there is definitely something for everyone. My favorite dish is the blue fin tuna from Spain with crab butter! Each visit we try to order something new, the whole fish mackerel sashimi was absolutely divine and the presentation of the whole fish was spectacular! (See attached photo). Also make note to save room for my all time favorite \"Honey Toast\" with only 3 simple ingredients, it may seem lackluster, but I promise you that it will be one of the best desserts you've ever had!",

Not overly priced, definitely affordable compared to restaurants on the strip and the decor and atmosphere were quite authentic like any Izakaya you would experience in Japan. Great little gem if you have a car in Vegas and can drive out to Spring Mountain road. It's not far at all, less than 5 minute ride from Wynn.",

Tuna was put red tender flesh with fresh deep flavor, salmon and yellowtail were perfectly cut and perfectly buttery! Jalapeno fried rice is simply the best fried rice I've ever had, EVER! Udon, ramen, shishito peppers, sunomono, eggplant, yam...WOW, ON POINT! Prices are very reasonable and staff is friendly, helpful and conscientious. Great experience, great meal, definitely our favorite Japanese restaurant in Vegas!!",

    "text": "One of my all-time favorite places to stop by at every time I'm in town!  My friend that lived in Vegas took me here for the first time 3 years ago and I've come back a few more times in the following years.   They have so many options on the menu I never know what to choose! They also have specials and other items that are listed on the walls and not on the menus so be sure to check those out too. It does get kind if difficult sometimes to read the messy, colorful, and small handwriting across the room with the Japanese words bigger than the tiny English translations on the bottom, along with the fact that there's SO many on the wall you could get lazy at looking at the whole wall after going down just the first row of items. One would think english is the more common language to read..  What I do know is you must get the yellowtail tartar which was so amazingly delicious I could imagine the taste and crunchiness in my mouth right now. It is a great appetizer to start out with and the yellowtails freshness is complimented so well with the blend of avocado, rice, and crispy delights.  Another good one is the tender and juicy beef tongue, the one that's sizzling on a hot plate not the skewers because its more of a good deal for the price and amount you're getting. I've also tried a variety of the skewers and they weren't bad but I just think you're better off getting other dishes that are more worth the price.   I've also tried the red snapper carpaccio: delicious, agedashi tofu which was pretty decent, a couple of their sashimis which have all maintained their freshness, and honestly I don't remember what else I have tried because there's just so many..  But  save the best for last...honeytoast AHH. You MUST get this no matter what. I've never had brick toast so good until I discovered the absolute best at Ichiza! I highly recommend you let your waitress know at the beginning that you will be getting it because it does take a while to make. The warmth of the crispy toast drizzled with honey mixed with the creamy lather of ice cream definitely hits the spot. They soak the soft buttery insides of the bread with just the right amount of honey, and top it all off with big scoops of vanilla heaven. Oh my goodness your tastebuds will literally be doused with feelings of ecstasy and thanking you the whole way. No lie.  Service is meh don't really remember much, just servers doing their job accordingly. The restaurant is a little bit cramped, and it can get waaaay too busy at night, but if you come in the afternoons it's not too bad. They are open quite late though.   Just remember, whatever you do, whatever you order, no matter how full you are..Get the honey toast!!",

Their food doesn't taste as good as it used to BUT I would still come back time and time again. I don't dislike anything on their menu and love love that they have daily specials. You have a lot to choose from when it comes to dishes and their prices are reasonable.  The restaurant's concept feels authentic and comfortable.  Some of my favorite dishes are:  Garlic chicken gizzard  Kimchi fried rice  Stir fried udon  Kim chi fried rice  Beef tataki   The honey toast is a must have for dessert. So delicious. So simple. Ask them to lightly toast the toast otherwise it'll most likely come out burnt on the outside.   Service is a hit or miss. The restaurant is quite small and there aren't very many tables so you will most likely be very close to another party...but that's apart of what gives Ichiza it's authentic feel. (Restaurants in Japan work with very little space also) If you're coming with a large party try to call ahead of time to see if they are able to accommodate.",

Atmosphere (4/5) This place is always packed every time I've been here. It very loud at night and the wait could be more than 30-60 minutes. Also, their waiting area is pretty small so on busy winter nights get ready to spend sometime outside of the building. You can always leave your name on the front desk and go to other shops in the plaza.  Service (3/5) Service is prompt and very courteous. The waitresses were very helpful in picking out food and explaining what each item contained.  Even the owner of the restaurant was making sure that everyone was being taken care of properly. His suggestion on some of the food items was very helpful.  Food (3/5) Our dinner primarily contained of everything on their menu; meat stick items, ramen noodles, mackerel, miso soup, and my favorite Blue Fin tuna poke. They have bunch of meat on a stick items, including yakitori and chicken meatballs.   Meat on a stick is always the best opener appetizer item for a gathering, this was followed up by miso soup and ramen noodles, which were good, but the noodles were nothing spectacular. If you want better noodles then you can go to Sora Ramen, which is couple blocks away from this place. Mackerel was bit over cooked, which made it bit chewy. Bluefin tuna poke was delicious, I felt guilty after ordering it but it was very fresh and practically melted in your mouth.   The most disappointing item on the menu was their honey toast. This is the worst dessert I've ever had. I just don't see how you can make a dessert out of a loaf of bread, ice cream and honey. It's to heavy and simply the its too sweet.  Overall, this is a reasonably prices restaurant, but some of the food items are either not made correctly or the flavor just don't add up, Ichiza get 3/5",

I love the sushi bar and the sitting down Japanese area in the back of the restaurant.  I've always had great service even at its busiest times. My favorite drink is the grape fruit sochu! It's so cool juicing your own fruit and pouring it's remnants into this sour nasty rubbing alcohol thing.  Their food is so amazing. I love the wasabi green beans, crab fried rice, ramen, sushi, and so many other dishes. Their specials are posted all over the restaurant on index cards so it's fun walking around seeing if they have anything new or weird to try. Their prices are always super reasonable, and their food quality is superb. Confused why they were closed last year like 4 times by the health department....

Its also fairly easy to get a seat, and I think they're open late.  Cons: Uncomfortable seating. They also keep your ongoing bill / check in a slot underneath your table that is quite obtrusive. Is is really that hard to slap a number on the side of each table and hang them behind the register? It may be easy to get a seat, but this restaurant is also on the 2nd floor, and you need to take a scary elevator, or the stairs.

The beef carpaccio wasn't very good at all.   I would rate this restaurant less stars for food quality and taste. The only thing positive about this restaurant is that it's open very late, and the variety of dishes they offer is very big. 1-Star for OPEN LATE, 1-Star for variety of dishes offered. Nothing was bad, nothing was great but the variety of dishes offered is always a plus.",

Such a simple item that  we thought would be easily found in California or even replicated at home, but we were wrong.    Raku may have the new title as the best Japanese restaurant in Vegas but you are still one of the top izakayas around and your extensive hours make you a winner.   Oh and you even accept Amex.

    "text": "I have been to Ichiza many times and have never really tasted anything off their large menu that made me have a foodgasm and so I was starting to think that the place was way too over-hyped... But on my most recent visit I discovered the Uni (Sea Urchin), Ika (squid) & Natto (fermented soybean) roll and it was so freakin good! It's definitely not for everybody with its interesting flavors but for my palette, it was perfect. I love uni but I would never think to pair it with ika and natto but somehow the flavors all worked together.. The buttery uni, chewy ika, slightly tangy natto + the floral taste of the shiso leaf was a party in my mouth.. And I definitely want to go that party again LOL It was a little over $8 for 4 pieces but I think it's worth it.. I was also impressed by the quality of the salmon sashimi on this visit! Even though everyone raves about the honey toast here, I am not a fan of it.. The last time I got it the bread was hard & burnt and there was just too much bread vs honey/ice cream..  Service is a hit or miss and there aren't that many tables to sit at which causes long waits at peak times.. So if you're someone who likes your space this isn't the restaurant for you because most likely you will be sitting very close to another party.. They even have a large shared table in the middle of the restaurant & shoulder to shoulder countertop seating..   HOT TIP: Look around at the menus on the walls before making your selection on their main menu and don't be afraid to ask the servers what the most popular items are ;]]]",

The beef tataki is quite plate licking good.    The pork belly melts on your tongue as does the uni which is quite fresh.  The skewers are not to be missed.    The service is quite attentive and even better when you have Japanese speaking friends with you.  It can be quite a wait during peak hours and on weeks there are events in Vegas.    Ichiza is a great place to grab a beer and a bunch of Japanese tapas.  Come hungry and leave happy without breaking the bank!",

Generally izakayas don't necessarily have to have amazing food (it is good in this case) but should have a good drink menu and stay open late. Ichiza lacks somewhat in the shochu department and the beer selection wasn't huge either; however the food prices are all really reasonable, and so I give it +1 star based on that.

I've been here so many times already and I'm always amazed and in awe with their food, service, and overall atmosphere.  The experience is also one I've never had.  I don't know what authentic Japanese food really means but I would assume Ichiza gives that full meaning.  Just like any other Japanese Restaurants, when I walk in I'm greeted loudly by all the employees in their language.  The past two times this week I've been I was with my cousins and this was the night to devirginize Christine with sake.  Muahahahahahaha!!!!  We were seated at the bar to watch the careful preparation of each food that was ordered by all customers.  It's a small and cute little restaurant that may sometimes have a wait because of seating capacity.    The menu is either in a form of a book or hanging from the ceiling in the bar area with pictures so you can see what the food looks like before ordering it.  I have found this very useful.  Also, you can just ask one of the servers what they would recommend and always will they give you a straight up answer.  They know their shit!  What's good?  Okay, you can order their Shrimp Fried Rice, Garlic Bok Choy, Oysters (mmm... their oysters here are bomb!), sushi is also good, Kimchi Pork (this is something you have to order too), Shrimp Tempura, Sake (large bottle), and there's just so much to choose from.  The only item I wasn't very hot for was the Fried Udon.  I can't put my finger on it but I know I wouldn't order it again.  Although I've been informed it's a popular item amongst majority of the customers.  By the end of it all, I was very full and satisfied as we ordered just the exact amount for everyone.  Now, the moment of truth.  It was time to sink the shot in Christine's mouth.  We were like little school girls pouring the shots.  Christine took the shot and didn't like it but got used to it after a while drinking.  I think this is where I'm gonna take my God sister when she comes to visit me.  I'm excited.",

It's been a long time because the now refined philanthropist/mother-of-Jolie Pitt-clan/paparazzi-shy-actress does not at all resemble the Angelina of those times: controversial, grungy, and FUN.  Ichiza is like that old Angelina, plus delicious!  Atmosphere is not for the timid eater, you are likely to share tables with strangers, you may even have to share tables with strangers as well as be shoes-less with them.  But if you like making friends over sake and exotic meats & fish, then come on in, order a drink and start staring... not at other people - at the strips of paper glued to the walls on which much of the menu is written (most of them are far away, so you will end up seeming like you're staring at other patrons anyways)!  Did I mention this restaurant was not for the shy?    The current Angelina does not seem to eat, but the old one did, and she probably devoured things like chicken gizzards (skewered and stir-fried), beef liver, & beef tongue, all of which are tasty at Ichiza.  My personal favorites are the buttery beef tongue and the chewy skewered gizzards.    If the present Ms. Jolie did eat, she'd probably enjoy the tofu and sashimi salad: refreshing cold tofu and top quality fish over fresh romaine and avocado, with zesty sesame vinagrette, it's approved for anorexic starlets.  Okay, all Angelina talk aside, I love Ichiza the most because of the grain epiphany that happened to me at this hole-in-the-wall Japanese treasure: the broiled rice balls - the best thing to have happened to anyone that's a fan of slightly-burned crispy rice.  It was these balls (not the Angelina fantasy - sorry to disappoint some of you) that made me an Ichiza convert.",

    "text": "During my trip from South Dakota to Cali the bf and I planned it so that we would have a stopover in Vegas and we wanted to try something that was off the strip that more locals ate at that was not ridiculously expensive. We love izakaya and frequently go to Village Yokocho in NYC so we wanted to see how this place would hold up.  We went there on a Saturday and got there about 7ish or so, it was pretty packed and there was a large asian clientele which I always look at as a good thing in an asian establishment. We had to wait for about 5 mins or so, but with a smaller party it's always a shorter wait and we had a seat at the bar.  The waitresses there were adorable and were very friendly and helpful. You got a regular menu but as people said in other reviews you have to walk around to see what other tasty treats might be posted on the wall around the restaurant.  There were a few things we had to get, one was the yellowtail tartare. It was...interesting, with tortillas and avocado being the main tastes, I am not sure if I would get it again but it wasn't bad...I wish I got more of a taste of the yellowtail in the dish. A quick breadown of the other thins we got if my memory serves correct:  1) Wasabi octopus - seemed like a popular dish, very fresh, cut good so its not to chewy, cheap 2) Fried squid - great sauce, perfectly cooked 3) Red snapper carpaccio - pretty presentation, eh on taste but not terrible 4) Spicy deep fried chicken - another seeminly popular dish, it was drenched in that srirachi sauce (sp?) but the breading wasn't to heavy and reminded me of a tempura 5) Tried to get salmon belly but it was sold out for the night 6) Honey toast of course - I dont know how they get half a loaf of bread to do that but I love carbs and I liked the denser chewy parts that were drenched in honey that you scoop up some melting ice cream with.   We had to get some Asahi Super Dry which was super cheap for the super big bottle, all together I dont even think our bill came up to $40 with all of that between the two of us, and it was an interesting neighborhood.   The ladies next to us got a bunch of sushi and a ramen dish which looked good but nothing to spectacular. I wish I saw or thought to ask for monkfish liver because that is really really yummy. We wanted to get some yakitori but they didn't have any combos and the selection was pretty small, overall I think our NY spot is still #1 but this place was solid.  One thing I dont like about Vegas is it's a little hard to get a cab and you technically can't flag one down on the street, you can call for one and there is a cab stand close by...we happened to see a guy leaving the shopping complex next door and ran up on him to get a ride, which can work as well.",

    "text": "Okay, overall pretty good. Selection is the strong it's strong point. The variety is staggering, so many dishes to choose from. But, they may be trying to do too many, taste wise it was okay.   Natto w/ okra - nothing special, natto (fermented soybeans) with slices of okra. Could have bought natto from the market and sliced an okra to make this for 50 cents.  Karaage - generous portions but there were bits of cartilage in some of the pieces. A bit bland -it's too bad. It would have been much better if they had marinated it before deep frying, as they should have. That's why they needed the dipping sauce for flavor.  Saba Battera - props for having this on the menu. Try and find this at a Japanese restaurant. You'll have a hard time - it takes time to prepare correctly. The one here is very different from what I'm used to, don't know if this was a regional difference. This one had egg in it. I never saw this before - this is a first. Taste wasn't bad although the fish was a bit small - possibly a reason for the egg to add some favor. Also, the fish was soft, it should have been cured more. Also, The rice was slightly mushy. I may be nit picking because this is my favorite sushi and I do get to eat some very good ones.   Gyutan (beef tongue) - okay but a bit tough. Pieces were a bit small on the skewer  Sea eel chirashi - more like a domburi dish. Basically, eel on rice. Had some egg to stretch it out. Tasted okay, but we make this all the time at home in 5 min.  Crab salad wrap. - used real crab plus cooked tuna w/mayonnaise, piece of lettuce warped with half of a tortilla. Nope this one didn't work at all. Tortilla, old store bought, Texture and flavor of the tortilla was too much for the rest of the components. Won't order this one again.   For me, it was okay. I wasn't excited when I left but neither was I disappointed. I gave it 4 stars because they are authentic and much better than most of the pseudo Japanese restaurants that abound.  They do have a ways to go to get to the level of the good ones that exist at this price. Will I be back? Maybe.",

Of course most places can't compared to the ramen straight from Japan, but it still did not completely satisfy. You know it's good when you finish the soup, but even when I was hungry, I still didn't finish it all. It lacked the right balance between too salty and too watery. This was too watered down. The service wasn't bad, and the atmosphere was great, but a restaurant is really judged on its food, so I would not recommend this place to friends.",

Needless to say, we are now fans.  The first time I went we had: Udama-age: deep-fried breaded quail eggs Tar tar yellow tail Kushi-tan: beef tongue skewers Garlic chicken gizzard Oshinko: Japanese pickled veggies Wasabi octopus Santa: sushi roll with tuna and spinach Honey toast: loaf of bread with honey and ice cream  Everything was very good. My favorite was the Santa which had a nice balance of flavors.  The second time we went we had: Spider roll  Eel kakiage tempura roll Agedashi tofu Sweet peppers  Chicken wings Ocha-zuke with salmon Deep-fried garlic  Everything was very good the second time around as well.  My favorite thing about Ichiza is the wide array of items to try. I love trying new things and could go back several more times, order several items, and still never repeat an item.",

What's unique about the place is the 'special' menu is written on the walls.  So if you are daring, by all means, order from it.  This place is one of a kind, it's not your typical Bennihana's or Kyoto Bowl, this is a direct import from Japan! =) Love it!  You can almost say this place serve 'tapas' but Japanese-style.  I had grilled squid to fried rice to raw sliced meat.  All I can say is this was a different dining experience but so good!  Great place to hit up after a long night of dancing and mingling, opens super late!",

Japanese at that! Hands down, the best udon I've ever tasted. The noodles were not bland at all and the soup was not too salty but just perfect. We also ordered the chicken. Tasted like popcorn chicken but you can actually taste the juicyness of the chicken. Aaand to top it off we got an order of the sashimi. Absolutely magnificent! Some places offer it too warm or not fresh at all but Ichiza had it on point!  The setting was way cute too. I felt like I just stepped into Japan for the time that I was there. And service was super friendly and super nice.   I am sad I didn't get to taste their brick toast with icecream thing... I heard it's to die for. That's why I am dying to try it the next time I'm in Vegas!! and while I'm at it... I want to try their ramen :)...and the many other things they offer at Ichiza.",

We ordered: Beef Tongue: this is really really good.  Very flavorful, but a little bit on the chewy side.   Miso Ramen: Tastes like the ones in Japan.  Authentic with a hint of spicy.  The pork rib inside the soup is to die for, as well as the perfectly cooked egg.   Just right.   Red Snapper Carpacio: I ordered this after reading reviews on Yelp.  It's just okay to me.  The snappers sit on lemon slices and I wasn't sure if I should eat the whole thing, or just the fish.  The presentation is nicely done though. Gyoza: They pretty much tastes the same everywhere.  It was so good that we went back the next night and this time, we got: Beef Tongue: this time tastes less chewy was really good Soy sauce ramen: I think the Miso one tastes better.  The soy sauce is a bit plain and it didn't come with the pork rib.  We got cha shiu instead, which is pork slices.   Chicken Gizzards: Very good.  Perfectly grilled! Butter Corn: We saw guests from our next table ordered this and decide to try it too.  It tastes very very good!  Sweet corn in mayo and butter on top of pita chips alike.    Their ramen is huge in size and I recommend you share with someone else and order other food items on the menu.  Their pricing is great too and they open until 4 am!  You totally get your money's worth. I'd eat here, instead of the expensive buffets if you aren't a big fan for them.  I wish there were a place like this one in the Bay Area.",

Definitely should order off the regular menu and try the dishes pasted on the walls...in fact if you got a craving for any particular dish, you should just go ahead and ask the waitress if they had it...we were pleasantly surprised with yellowtail collar which wasn't on the menu nor on the wall.

On previous visits it's been very hard to get a table due to the crowds, but on this particular trip, we were able to get a table with no trouble at all. Maybe it's due to the economy, but maybe it's because Ichiza now opens for lunch instead of just dinner and people come early on instead of late at night. I think that's why they always run out of ramen soup stock whenever we are there around 10pm. It's a bummer too since my wife was craving their chasu ramen.  This time we tried salmon ochazuke which I've never had before. It's a rice with salmon and nori in a green tea broth. It was different and not bad. I always love the miso butterfish here and it never fails us every time.   Ichiza is best enjoyed with a bunch of friends who love to eat and drink, but no matter who you go with, the food will always keep you coming back for more.",

This is the kind of place a businessman would go to after work to drink with his co-workers, and snack while they discuss whatever. This isn't a go-to place for sushi. This isn't a formal romantic evening. You're not paying for the posh atmosphere.  Everything is well prepared, the menu (both on paper and additional items on the walls) are varied and incorporate traditional dishes and contemporary food as well. Price was very very low, and the place is packed even in the middle of the week, so arrive early or plan to wait (dunno if they have reservations.)  Personal recommendations would be the chicken gizzards, wasabi octopus, shishito skewers, and my absolute favorite would be the honey toast box is a must try too!  If you're looking for japanese food, come here. If you're looking for some good eats with a little sushi, come here.

For the people that complain about the price for good Japanese food. Please tell me where I can go find good cheap Japanese food. In my experience, Japanese food has always been ridiculously expensive.   There are so many things that are good, but to keep it short and sweet you have to try the Ice Cream & Honey Toast. I am so jealous that I don't have a Ichiza in Texas to satisfy my craving for an awesome dessert. Owners of Ichiza, please open one in Texas! I don't care which city. I can drive =D",

Not sure how we put down all that food, but we were very fat and happy leaving the restaurant.  My favorite, well there were so many... buta kimchee, chawanmushi, fried octopus legs, beef tongue and honeytoast...  I actually could have listed all 15 dishes.  I would recommend making reservations.  It was definitely packed.",

The food, it's so good that my brother starts giggling while he's eating.  I recommend the beef bowl.  Even the rice in the beef bowl is fantastic.  Love the black cod, cold seaweed, and honey toast!  But overall, everything is seriously delicious.  Thank you Ichiza for being my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas!",

THis place is classic.  The menu is the walls, every dish is on a paper on the wall, plus they have a menu, but the menu cannot hold all the offerings so they started using the walls.  I have to say, its brilliant!  Small place, get there early, or get a reso.  Probably my favorite Sushi Bar in Vegas, its got a vibe that is just so hip and trendy, Its like being in Japan or something.  Something is on the grill too, the food is insane, and I have ordered everything I can think of and it was all stellar.   Its beer and date friendly, parties for birthdays would be killer here, people would be full and happy.  In fact, I always leave happy saying, I will be back here soon.  IN fact, I will.  Its totally the way to go in China town.  Start HERE and go to others after. THis is the STANDARD in Vegas Littlle China Town....I love this town.  Vegas offers everything and this is one of em!   5 STAR RECOMMENDED!    Bring girl or guy, bring girl or guy home!   lol",

Thank god I presented my gift cert before I order my food, the manager said it expired and won't honor it, and rudely walked away. I pointed out that the big fine print states \"do not expire\". Then he changed his word saying that MY company made a mistake, I should contact my company or the vendor to get my refund, his restaurant made no mistake. No apologizes. I felt like he frauded me.   (When I talk, I tend to give hand gestures. While writing this review, I just realized that he \"tabbed\" my hands a couple times to shut me up while I was talking. very rude.)",

Every single time I have been brought here by friends who loved this restaurant, it has always been at least a 30-40minutes wait. Which I normally dont mind at all but waiting for something that I dont enjoy afterwards does not seem that it was worth waiting at all.  I dont remember what I ate because I let my friends that has been here order for me but of all the plates I tasted nothing stood out and nothing blew me away. I, also finally tried the honey toast that A LOT of people rave about, but it highly disappointed me.  maybe is because i did not like the honey taste or the texture of the honey toast, but it didnt taste that great either.   I guess Ichiza isnt for everyone.",

I advise anyone in Las Vegas visiting or resident to stop by Ichiza to get your Japanese fix! Super cute spot with tons of things to choose from. Dinner here was a get find.  I'm a fan of their miso soup, shrimp tempura...shrimp fried rice.  Customer service is standard... could have been better (my reason for my -1 star.) Our waiter was lagging through out our visit.  But the food is solid!  It looks like over the last couple of years, I've been posted in LV at least 3 times a year... so the next time I'm back... I'm going to get my ICHIZA fix!  Upstairs at a random building. Free parking. Casual dining. Come by with friends and family!  Oishii!  Gotta love those hidden gems!  Arigato Ichiza!",

She didn't want to give us the corner table although there was no one there so she had us standing awkwardly waiting until another waiter stepped in and probably told her to just give that table to us when there was no one there! And there were other empty tables open but she wanted us to wait for a table to leave! No one ever came by for my coke refill when my cup was empty and the staff was just standing around. The food did not make anything better either. Udon stir fry was bad and had a sourness to it, rice with gravy was too salty, salmon collar was too salty and so on! Nothing special here and not worth it. Also food started burning and the whole restaurant was coughing horribly.",

The late-night dining option is a plus  2. There can be long lines, so avoid weekends at all costs.  3. Cozy interior with more than half the menu items tacked onto the wall....nice touch.   4. Staff is welcoming, but service seems to level off from there  5. Food service is marginal at best (timing, ordering process, accuracy, etc. )  6. Food selection and quality is decent, but there is better Japanese cuisine out there.   I enjoy going here once in a while, but my visits are becoming less and less frequent.   Likelihood of returning in the next month? 20%  Likelihood of returning the the next 6 months? 50%",

There was Japanese pop music in the background and all the diners were Asian, speaking a variety of languages. It felt like we were transported to Japan. I had the beef curry stew with rice. It was good, but not the best Japanese curry I've had. My husband ordered several sushi rolls--all very good and large portions for the price. The sushi menu was huge, with specials posted all over the walls at the sushi bar. We ordered a charsu pork roll, think it was a pork bun, but it came out sushi style with rice, rolled in nori wrapper. It was good. I had a nice chilled sake that was presented in a little square box cup. It was very good.  We will definitely go back.",

The average wait time here is 40 minutes.   I don't get this place. Tourist from Japan always ask me how to get here. Apparently, even in Japan they advertise this place.   It smelled horrible in here today. The smell was a combination of ammonia and paint. Apparently the construction in the shop next door is causing this horrible stench.   To me, \"Anime Ramen\" downstairs has a way better tasting Honey Toast. The Honey Toast here at ICHIZA is presented artistically and impressively, but it just doesn't have the impressive taste like the one at \"Anime\". At \"Anime\", they batter and fry the pieces of toast and give you a scoop of ice cream they intentionally over froze, so that it doesn't melt immediately on the hot bread. I also like how at \"Anime\", they use a real Japanese brand of ice cream instead of some generic super market brand.   Personally, I didn't really like anything here. I'm just giving it 3-stars because I feel bad about pissing off the old man.",

She was in town this week and we stopped by here after I picked her up from the airport. She was already tipsy from drinks at SFO cause her flight was delayed so we didn't order bottles of Nigori like usual.   This is what we ordered:   Asahi - large bottle Mackerel w/miso sauce Ika-yaki  Stir fried garlic chicken gizzards Wagyu beef carpaccio Tako wasabi - they forgot to give this to us Kimchi fried rice Salmon w/mozzarella tempura  They were out Black Cod w/miso sause so we tried the Mackerel. The Markerel is a little salty. The Ika-yaki is another dish that we always get. Tako wasabi is also another dish we always order, but they forgot to give it to us this time. Stir fried garlic chicken gizzards are a must. We tried to order the Butter Clams, but they ran out.  OPEN LATE AND 10% DISCOUNT CARD",

The herbs in the ponzu sauce goes so well with the soft tofu with the crispy shell - Takoyaki: I standard staple food that is well made with a hot center with octopus tentacles with a sweet sauce - Beef Tongue: A tender cut and the seasoning goes well with the meat - Chicken Gizzard: Again, great seasoning and cooked well - Beef Tataki Carpaccio: It was sweet and you will never see raw meat the same again - Brick Toast: Sweeter and creamier than other places that make Brick Toast  There are so many dishes to choose from that I want to try it all! The only questionable item was the Seafood Quesadilla which tasted okay. I am willing to wait in the long line so that I can eat here again and try more of their dishes!

    "text": "i went to japan last yr..and i miss the good authentic japanese food and atmosphere.  i'm so glad my friend referred me to this place. This christmas holiday, my family and i went to vegas so i made a stop here at Ichiza.   The ambiance totally reminded me of japan..the people were nice, the service was good.   As i was waiting for our table, guess who i saw? Yelper Roo M. and his wife. I noticed him and his camera.   So back to the food..  udon - the broth was light but the udon noodle was good. I like the perfect chewiness.  beef bowl - it was okay ; nothign special  3 items sashimi: tuna, albacore, and mackerel (you get three pieces of each fish); $13 for this dish and the fish are fresh, and a good size cut.  takoyaki - this is just how i remembered from japan. Ever since japan i've been trying to find a good takoyaki place in LA...but nope!! none!! and finally here in vegas i found the authentic takoyaki i had in japan! THe sauce was good, the takoyaki had good amount of octopus..not like at some places that everything is all mashed.   yellowtail tar tar - now i know everyone talks about how good it is..perhaps it was overhyped for me.. but i didnt think it was that great. I will admit that it was presented beautifully and uniquely. The taste was alright. I dont think i will need to order it again ... but if i were to come here w/ first timers, yeah i'll order it just so that they can try it.  black cod fish - this was really good. it was cooked perfectly. the meat of the fish just flakes off individually ...and the miso taste was good.  beef tataki - small portion .. it was good but i've had better. I don't need to order this again.  we wanted to order the clams but it was sold out. it's okay gives me the opportunity to come back here again.  I really enjoy this restaurant. And you know it's good when every other table is japanese customers. And they all speak japanese. I cant wait to come back and try other items. Another plus about this restaurant is that it's only a few minutes away from the strip!!",

This is the kind of place where you take your friends if you plan on being loud and enjoy a good meal.

    "text": "ichiza was such a treat in LV's chinatown. they were so accommodating to our party of 6, we showed up without reservations on a weekend and our wait didn't end up being too long (~30 min). as soon as you're seated you're presented with a menu & drink menu (after all it's an izakaya/pub - think tapas but japanese) - and you just go at it. they keep a notepad on each table where they write down your order and cross out the items as they're brought out.   as some others have mentioned it's kind of a pain to look at all the other food offerings that are hanging on the walls. i mean, i understand what they were going for, but it honestly can't be that difficult to print these out on a sheet of paper and include it with their regular menu. i have astigmatism so i don't need to wear my glasses all the time, and i was straining my eyes the entire time staring at the walls - i'm afraid i might've given the wrong impression to some of the other patrons.   as far as the food goes, i think everything was good (specially their yakitori - they were all SO tender and perfectly grilled) and their prices were reasonable. i'm pretty sure there's something here for everyone, you just have to know what to order or come with someone that's previously been to ichiza as their wall menu & specials can be a bit overwhelming.   the honey toast was excellent - the edges were perfectly toasted and the center conveniently sliced and chewy. SOO GOOD!",

    "text": "Coming from San Jose, we are blessed to have great izakaya/Japanese tapas restaurants (Gochi, Tanto), so I was not expecting to be blown away by Ichiza.  In actuality, I was pleasantly surprised at how good this little joint is.  Ichiza is located on the second floor of an unassuming strip mall in Vegas.  The interior is homey, with seating at a bar, communal tables and individual tables.  There are postings for a ton of different tapas you can order posted all over the walls; it will take a good few minutes to scan them all (and 99% of them sound delicious).  We ordered:  -Tuna tofu salad: very fresh lettuce and cherry tomatoes, avocado, raw tuna, tofu chunks, with a tangy dressing.  Very light, refreshing and rich at the same time with the creaminess of the tuna, tofu and avocado.    -Spinach salad (gomaae): mm, boiled, cold spinach with sesame sauce.  Love this stuff.  Typical serving size.  -Miso black cod: A MUST ORDER.  Delicious!  Perfectly cooked, sweet, tender cod with a little tempura daikon on the side.  Watch out, there was a bone when we bit into it.  -Jalapeno fried rice: we were hesitant to order this but it turned out to be one of our favorite things.  The fried rice was SO buttery but that's what made it so delicious.  Who cares if it's artery clogging, your taste buds will jump for joy.  There's a big, charbroiled (or grilled?) jalapeno on top, giving it a nice smoky, spicy flavor.  -Uni mochi: meh, so-so.  The mochi was crispy on the outside but toooo mochi-ish (just super chewy and glutinous).  It reminded us of eating a marshmallow with the consistency of peanut butter (that feeling where you're chewing and chewing and chewing).  There was a spoonful of uni on top with some green onion garnish.  -Some sort of sake (raw salmon) wrapped something, sitting on a lemon slice: I can't remember exactly what it was, but it was very tasty :) I think it had scallop inside?  In any case, see my pic and drool.  -Red snapper carpaccio: raw red snapper wrapped around shredded daikon with a dollop of something and 3 ikura (raw salmon egg) on top with a (I think) ponzu sauce.  Mmm!  Refreshing, nice texture.  -Half order of ramen: half order size was perfect.  We couldn't even finish it all.  Nice savory broth and chewy noodles.  I can't remember much else but I do remember that it was good, though I've had better ramen.  HONEY TOAST: OH EM GEE.  THIS IS A F*CKING CUBE OF DELICIOUSNESS.  Mindblowingly good.  Toasted Asian bread, gutted out, with honey and butter on the inside, served with a giant scoop of vanilla ice cream, and drizzled with more honey.  Who knew that such a simple concept could be SO DAMN TASTY?!  This was definitely the defining dish of the meal, and of the restaurant.  I've tried to make it at home and it wasn't the same.  I would come back JUST for the honey toast, and I would make love to it if I could, it was THAT GOOD.  Overall, I can't recall it being too expensive, actually, if anything, I remember it being a good deal for the amount of food and quality.  The owner (or manager?), a tallish, Japanese gentleman was even nice enough to help us call a cab when we were done with dinner as we had to rush to the airport.    4 stars for service and food.  Would definitely recommend this place, though it is a bit out of the way from the strip.",

Better than a brick toast at Guppy's in California, better than any toast I've had by far in any Asian restaurant. It's big enough for two to three people to share. It's really simple, but simple ingredients go a long way. Hot buttery toast with a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream drizzled in honey... it's the best thing ever. Ok, their ramen is good too.",

    "text": "My wife and I celebrated Mother's Day dinner at Ichiza.  Of course we waited an hour arriving at 5:30pm.  This was expected so no big deal.  We were seated at the bar giving me a full view of the chefs cooking. During our dinner the head chef butchered a box of raw chicken.  He was masterful and quick in dissecting the chicken.  My problem was he had no gloves on so he touched the chicken with bare hands and being the expediter he handed out the orders to the various stations.  He also touched take out containers all without washing his hands.  After finishing the butchering of the chicken,  I watched him wash the cutting board with 3 strokes using plain water and no detergent.  The same board was used for cutting sashimi and other food items. He also wiped his hands on his apron while butchering the chicken. I also saw a sous chef drop the honey bread on the floor and did not dispose it.   We have been to Ichiza many times and enjoy the food.  I guess when Keller's NYC \"Per Se\" restaurant received a few demerits by the Health Dept and dropped their rating from A to C (for a few days) we can expect incidents like this at smaller restaurants.  I am hoping the owners read their reviews and install corrective measures to avoid future recurrence of these infractions.  Next time I will ask for a table.",

    "text": "**200th review**  Who knew in the middle of the desert you would actually find an authentic Japanese Sake House??? Hidden in a random strip mall, Ichiza serves up some tons of Japanese style tapas for everyone to enjoy.  Came here for dinner with some friends... because we didn't want the typical buffet dinner or the calories that is often associated with Vegas.  Decor was charming. It had 2 sections of large tables with the tatami style seating.  It was pretty quaint.  The lamps were really dope. They were homemade and it looked like philo dough bound with a fish grill on it. It was pretty impressive. They also had the typical hand made signs of the specials plastered all over the bar.  The service was spotty unfortunately however our waitress was really cute with a cute Japanese accent.  When asked about recommendations, there were none.... she replied that everything was good.  Don't come here being extremely hungry... the portions are smaller than the typical sake houses in LA, but hey, its supposed to be appetizers, right?  The karrage Chicken was really good- tender and not too much batter... the pork and kimchi was delicious... the chicken wings and yakatori were not very good. Perhaps adding some fresh wasabi and lemon juice would have kicked it up a notch??? Agadashi Tofu was weak in flavor.. have had better in LA.  Best dish of the night?  The sea bass which was delicious and excellent. Highly recommended. Very moist and perfectly cooked in a sweet soy sauce. I could have devoured that entire dish myself!  Order a pitcher of Kirin, some Calpis Sochu, and some sake and you got yourself a rockin Japanese style party! Recommended and will tell my friends about this place for sure in the future!",

Fun place to try lots of different dishes. Most, if not all dishes are very tasty and different, only exception was the whole fried shrimps, too salty.  yellowtail collar was the best choice (runs out quickly)...Open late...till 4am, so after a night of winning $$, it's a great way to end the night.",

Menus,tables, condiment containers all grungy. Kitchen trash overflowing onto the floor. I've been in gas station bathrooms on the wrong side of town cleaner then this place. Chefs dripping with sweat. I was adventurous though, tasty gooey pork dishes and small skewers of goodness. The unusual tasting Crab rice kicked my daughter horizontal for two days. So maybe they were off their game for our visit, BUT \"NO MAS\"",

Now how can something that's not on the menu be sold out unless there's a conspiracy to deprive me of the only thing I can think of that is offered but not on the menu.   Seriously, the food here is great. I'm trying to eat my way through all of the \"specials\" on the board (haven't been disappointed so far) and the regular menu items are good as well. It has a vibe all its own. Come with friends and have a blast or sit at the counter and see the kitchen show.",

We also had the agedashi tofu this must be the best version of it that i've had. It sat in a very flavorful dashi..  We also had the fried chix  pretty good.  The beef curry was a disapointment , kinda sweet?  Service a little slow. I don't think i would go back, lots of other places with more room and not a long wait.",

We made a reservation for 7 pm and didn't have to wait at all when we walked in. I noticed there was a line waiting for tables though if you didn't have a reservation. The service is pretty fast and the food were pretty good. We ordered about 6-7 dishes from the menu and after that we figured there were a lot more different dishes written on the papers on the wall! It's impossible to try everything they offered, but the most memorable dish was the Honey Toast dessert. It was absolutely amazing! It'd be great if they offer 2 scoop of ice cream instead of one. Definitely a must go japanese tapas place if you are in town.",

One, you will see how your food was made,,, REALLY FRESH. The staff was really helpful, hard working and very friendly. The ambiance was really warm. All cultures, from all continents are there, so you won't feel out of place. The Japanese people were friendly. As a matter of fact, my wife and I got treated to two shots of sake from the nice Japanese people next to us. The food was VERY fresh, served in time and always with a smile. The ramen was a great choice along with the California rolls and the shrimp tempura plus the sake. All in all, my wife and I had a really good time together at Ichizan.   If you wish to get seated in a place you really want, call at a much earlier time to get a reservation... but if you're going to be a couple, try the bar... it's a really good experience. Order a bottle of sake together and enjoy each others company and get to meet new people ;)   Our compliments to everyone at Ichizan! Domo arigato!!!",

    "text": "My friends swear by this place, they go regularly, so they dragged me along one late night.  The service was acceptable.  Not great, not bad.  I ordered katsudon and a soda, I'll get to the taste is a second.  My bill was $15.  That is outrageous.  All the Donburi (rice bowls) on their menu were $6 or $7 dollars.  They served Tonkatsu, so I asked if they do katsudon and they said yes, they just hadn't updated their menu in a while, hence why it wasn't on there.  No, I'm pretty damn sure the reason it wasn't on there is so they can hit you with charging you double price when you get the bill.  $12.50 for a rice bowl is insane.  I have never, across four states and two countries, paid more than $10 for a basic rice bowl.  And the tonkatsu plate on their menu was $9, so it obviously wasn't pork vs chicken that caused the price to raise. This alone is the reason I would not go back.  I don't like getting cheated on my bill, and if I'm going to pay that level of upcharge, I better get spectacular service or be eating on the strip.  At least the katsudon wasn't bad.  It wasn't particularly good either, but at least it wasn't bad.  The pork chop/cutlet/whatever was pretty small, but it tasted fine.",

It tasted kinda bland.   What else? Oh, their menu is enormous and they even have stuff plastered on the wall, which we wished we had seen originally! yeah, they don't give you a heads up which is strange.

Sometimes the place is so busy that the servers are frantically running around, which sometimes leads to forgotten orders, but whatever, if I don't end up paying for it, what's the harm. I get a hankering for kimchee fried rice, the Ika-Yaki (grilled squid), grilled cow tongue, and the Yellowtail tartare.   I love the tender grilled squid with the ginger sauce that is served alongside. The kimchee fried rice has just the perfect amount of the pickled cabbage, so that it is not too spicy, but it leaves you wanting more. The tartare is phenomenal, although I sometimes wish there were actually more yellowtail, and less of the other components (a stack of fried wonton crisps topped with sushi rice, pico de gallo, lettuce and a mix of chopped yellowtail and avocado.) Now I want some!",

It's a great place to try new dishes. Ignore the tiny printed menu they hand you.  Try some new way of preparing your favorite fish. You may not be able to read everything on the signs but you can at least recognize the name of your favorite fish. The prices are very reasonable as well for the type of cuisine you're buying.  I just wish the place were open for lunch.  If you like fresh fish and are open to trying new dishes, ie. going beyond the usual sticky sweet rolls, this is the place for you.

What can I suggest: Do not miss the black cod! It is like butter! Amazing delicate miso-sauced butter! But don't worry -- everything is so good! There is no wrong choices off this menu. I would suggest forgoing the sushi for the more traditional dishes. These clearly are their specialties.",

When we arrived, the first person we encountered was our server,who had a look of confusion when we 1st interacted with her, and her deer-in-the-headlights expression started to complement her performance as a server.  When we 1st arrived, we tell her that we are 2 and a baby... she glances around at some free tables and tells me that we need to wait.  We stand there for some time until the manager approaches us with a bit of a surprised look on his face and quickly sits us at one of the vacant tables that the girl glanced at.  I ask our server for a high chair for my son... I stand there for like 5 minutes until the manager approaches me and gets me one.  Our food took long, the server never came to check on us, we never got any drinks refilled, and I had to hunt down the server for our check.    I want to make it clear that this place is not good to take kids to.  My son is actually great in restaurants.  My son doesn't throw tantrums, throw food, or run around.  He sits in his high chair, makes some noise (nothing crazy), and eats.  Granted, there's gonna be some food on the floor, but that's the worst of it.  When the server saw the food on the floor... deer-in-headlights.  There was honestly about 1/2 cup of scattered noodles / rice on the floor.  She responded as though I took everything we ordered and threw it all over the restaurant!  Don't get me wrong... the food here is excellent!  We saw many Japanese couples around the restaurant eating, which was a huge sign to my wife and I that this place would most likely be authentic.  The quality and freshness of the food proved to be outstanding.  My wife and I are from San Francisco and were used to frequenting Japan-town for authentic Japanese food and this place seemed  as authentic as what we are used to.  Quick conclusion: bad service, don't bring young children, authentic delicious Japanese food",
