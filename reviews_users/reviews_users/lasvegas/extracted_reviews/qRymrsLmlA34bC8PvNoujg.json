A guy took my order when I originally called in a to go order and he didn't seem too sure about any of the questions I asked regarding preparation. I was concerned when I hung up the phone that my order would not be correct. But, about a minute later Tatum called me and asked the questions about my order that I was concerned about!!! I love this restaurant and would have been very upset if I would have picked up my order and it was wrong or someone had made an assumption about how I wanted my food. I am picky about certain items and would have been really upset with someone guessing.  But thank you Tatum for taking the time to call me and confirm how I wanted my wrap and confirming my order! Small attention to detail and caring enough to make sure that the customer will be satisfied means everything!  My husband and I frequent Market Grille and I'm hoping Tatum is shown appreciation by her manager! Thank you again Tatum.",

The spinach basil hummus is off the chain.. The only thing I could say to encourage owners is the odd way that they hand deliver sweetener/ sugar.. Its not like its not on the table and they bring you a container for self serve, but literally bring you a varied amount.. Its a distraction to the dining and the servers running sweetener probably Noneifies the savings of not having it on the table.. Overall cool place to go.",

    "text": "Market Grill, Durango  One Fri evening in mid-August, coming back after hiking on Mt. Charleston one Fri evening, my wife and I were hungry and thirsty. A quick check with Yelp showed a Greek restaurant nearby Durango off I-95. So, we happily rushed into Market Grill Greek Cafe for beers and dinner!  After settling down with a couple of Greek beers, (&3.5@, NOT BAD!), we began to notice something in the restaurant:  - It's spacious with high ceilings; has an airly, clean and comfortable decor; has a nice patio...  - Its TV continuously shows pics of theirGreek dishes, deserts, etc, and how they are prepared. It seems to us that this is the ONLY hint that Market Grill Cafe is a Greek restaurant. We did hear \"Oopa!\" a few times, but did not see any flaming cheese anywhere?  FOOD: - We followed a couple ofYelpy recommendations and ordered the popular \"Chicken Parmegranate,\" \"Chicken Gyro\", anda \"Greek Salad\". The Greek salad was pretty tasty with lots of black olives; but the lettuce was too finely chopped. The Chicken Parmegranate was too bland, and the chicken not firm; Chicken Gyro needed salt and pepper to boost the taste. The dishes were not how we remembered as Greek cuisine would taste like as those served in Greek restaurants in Detroit, Chicago.... Well, perhaps, the regular Greek chef was not on duty that evening?  SERVICE: - Our waitress was attentive and and helpful. [GOOD!] But, we did notice a couple of times when customers were waiting by the hostess station, but there was no hostess and the restaurant people just walked by WITHOUT greeting them, leaving them standing for a while! No one was busy at the time, as the place was pretty EMPTY! This is not a good practice! [BAD!] I was surprised that the customers did not turn around and leave the place!  HAPPY HOUR (3-6) - $1 off drinks and appetizers. We were too late for the happy hour that evening.  Peterskis, Aug 2012 ---",

The meat inside was tasty with Greek spices. It was so huge I couldn't finish it. I also tasted their hummus trio. It was a sampler of three different flavored hummus. Spinach Basil, Roasted red pepper and Lemon cilantro. They were different than any of the hummus I've had before. I enjoyed each one of them.  The service was nice and quick.

The menu said the vegetable skewer consisted of peppers, onions and mushrooms yet when our dinners were brought the skewers were with tomatoes and onions.  When I asked for the skewer as described on the menu they did accommodate us but the manager said that was not the description on the menu.  He came back shortly to tell me that I was right and he was wrong.  They are in the process of printing a new menu which will have different veggie skewers for the lamb than all the other skewers.  The waiter did not ask how we wanted the lamb prepared and it was a little overcooked but otherwise everything was very good.  When we go back I will have to remember to tell the waiter that I want it med. rare.",

    "text": "I have been a frequent visitor to Market Grille over the past 12 months, going several times a month to get their delicious food.  Unfortunately, something must have changed in the past month or so. I almost always get take-out, but the past 2 orders have been either incomplete or unfulfilled completely.  A few weeks ago, I ordered a traditional gyro lunch special with drink. The guy behind the counter could not understand a single thing on the phone, having to repeat myself multiple times. When I picked up my order, I did not have my drink when I departed. I had to drive 10 minutes back to the restaurant to pick it up (partly my fault - should of known my drink wasn't there). However, the issue with the same employee was no apologies or understanding of what had just happened. He was completely dumbfounded!  The second instance was just this morning. I called to make my order and told 15-20 minutes to get it ready. No problem. I show up 15 minutes later and there is NO record of my order! The young lady behind the desk, again seemingly clueless, is unable to log onto her computer to see what is going on. While this is transpiring, she is answering 2 phone calls (not putting them on-hold) instead of taking care of the in-presence customer. I patiently wait, but finally give up and cancel my would-be order. She offered to get the manager, but I politely declined (I should have).   I'm not sure what is going on. Customer service at this place used to be 5 stars ALL the time. Recently, something is amiss. Either management has dropped the ball (inconveniently twice for me) or they are hiring people with zero social skills.  This is quite a shame. Whatever happened to the \"Best of Las Vegas\"? No awards since 2014...",

I hope the other location is just as amazing! Wait staff was so friendly and provided great recommendations! Very warm and inviting atmosphere, handicap accessible! The food was delicious. The meat in the gyros will melt in your mouth! Rice is seasoned n cooked perfectly. Everything had great flavors, was well prepared and plated beautifully. Dessert is just as food as everything else! The cake was so moist and delicious! They do not skimp on the portions!",

They have a couple of different options for an entree, you get a side, and drink.  I chose to get the chicken gyro, one of my friends got the original, and my other friend chose the pomegranate chicken.   I really liked the chicken. I was surprised by how big it was. I got it with the yogurt sauce. The chicken was really well cooked. My friend loved the pomegranate if you want something a little different. It was so satisfying. The whole meal like just $9 I think for the lunch option each, which is a really good deal.  The staff takes you through the really popular items on the menu if you haven't been there before. You also get a 15% off for your next boost if it's your first time.",

There are televisions that feature the food.

On one occasion I had them take mine back because the central area of the moussaka was not hot at all and I was concerned about eating it.  My spouse really likes the food, but I would describe it as being okay (not my first choice for greek food).  They have a few desert items as well; the cannoli being my favorite.  There are many menu items to choose from and after a certain time of day there is table service (you are seated and a waiter takes your order; typical restaurant format).",

I had this place bookmarked forever, but I never get up to this area, so after a hike at Mt. Charleston, it was the perfect time to stop in.   I was craving kabob and a Greek salad, I couldn't decide which to order, salmon or filet kabob, our waitress explained that I could order one of each and it would be the same price as the entree, which was $12.95. I went with that.   I receive my salad first, it had good flavor and all my favorites in a typical Greek salad. My entree comes out. I taste the basmati rice, bland, no flavor. I moved onto the hummus & pita. The hummus was ok, but my pita was basically store bought pita bread sliced into triangles. Another let down. So then I try the salmon, it was so dry and Inedible. Last thing, the filet kabob, again no flavor at all. I NEVER salt my food, this needed it terribly, I ended up using the hot sauce on the table to give it some flavor.   When the bill comes, I notice she charges me $12.95 plus $6.95 for a \"side\" kabob. This is not how she explained this to me. This meal was terrible and not worth $5, let alone $20.  Calling this place a Greek restaurant is like calling Carrabba's Italian food. Never again.",

I ordered the classic gyro (lamb meat) and got it in a platter which included a salad, rice, and hummus with pita bread. The salad was small and tasty. Not sure what the dressing was but it was light and slightly sweet. I love hummus and theirs is very good. The rice and gyro were delicious and had a lot of meat. The only problem with the gyro is it didn't have enough sauce for me (but I like a good amount on my gyros.) Definitely go with the yogurt dill sauce on the gyro. It's a nice family owned restaurant with an overall pleasant atmosphere. It was so nice out that night that my boyfriend and I ate in the outside patio area. It's very cute and romantic. I'll be back soon to try more of the menu.",

    "text": "Hmmm I want to write a nice review and give five stars... I really do. I just can't. And it's part of the service that might be fine for some people but really irked me that makes it impossible to give it five stars.  It stinks that Yelp uses the \"Meh\" word for two stars though... that originated with people actually making the noise \"ehhhh\" or \"mmmmm\" from being unimpressed or indecisive, then somebody too young to understand how to write it came up with \"Meh\", which nobody ever said before. That's what cows say. These days I've heard people say it because they read it and think that's the way to express it and follow trends without thinking. It sounds contrived and ridiculous. So it doesn't represent me but I can't give more stars.  The food here has always been pretty good in my opinion. I've read a few reviews that were ragging on the food, but I simply don't agree with that part-- It's always been pretty good. I try different places in Vegas often, and typically I don't take the time to write about them but I do have a lot of experience with the subject, including visits to eateries coast to coast and in between. I hope my words help Market Grille and don't simply anger some employee that thinks they can't be wrong.  It was a slow time of day, after the lunch rush but well before dinner. The staff paid attention to us and even had a trainee politely let us know she would be shadowing a bit. Cute. Those members moved on.   Then the trouble started. Our waitress was timely, sharp, and knowledgable.... but wanted us to know it. I've met similar mindsets before; it's hard to describe but they seem to have focused their life on being the expert in your own business. When choosing something off the menu, she didn't stop with describing the food or what goes well with what. She would say what I should order based on my friend's order so that the amounts and variety would be right for sharing. Only problem is neither my friend nor I said my friend's food would be shared. It could be assumed, it could also be right... but I didn't say it and nobody should be telling me or my friend what to get because the waitress thinks it's efficient.  Eventually came the entree decision, and she did it again! Just ran me over with her turn to talk...  \"Well your (appetizer) is a lot of food and her (my friend's) order is plenty of food, so you should get the half order. The whole order is a lot. So we're going to get the half order\" (body language shows she's ready to move on). Yes, she actually said \"We're\" going to get the half order (or whatever the smaller order is called-- trust me, I don't remember technical things like that when I'm irritated, but I remember the problem just fine). She actually told me what we were going to order.  I let her know that I would be deciding, and though I agreed with her \"decisions\" that day I explained (shouldn't have to of course) that I would simply get a box if I couldn't finish any food... since she didn't even know we had limited time anyway!!   I absolutely, positively, hate that kind of mentality. Do not decide for me what I'm going to eat, how much, or what arrangement I or a friend wants, especially when only about four tables had customers, and plenty of staff to serve them and the place is quiet. There's no reason to hurry my decisions along, and not only that, I may change my mind. I happen to like deciding for myself, since it's for me after all.  I might eat one bite of food and take the rest home. My friend may say we should leave based on her messages. I might get real hungry and order more. I might want something different after that and take it all home in a box. I might change my mind about the whole thing in a second because I see something else I almost missed because I was too busy listening to your motherly manipulation.   It's a simple contract. I pay, you bring food, not direction and orders.   Your way is not always more efficient, more intelligent, or more helpful when you tell me what I should do. Because you... don't... know. Got it?  When we agree, it shouldn't fuel the belief that you're always right or smarter than everyone.   Don't ruin this good restaurant with that overbearing, \"gotta be the expert\", Taurus approach or whatever it is. It makes me wonder if I even got a chance to look at the other choices, because you speak...  and away we go! Calm down. Let people relax and think about it, even if they are indecisive like I might be for a few seconds and you think it's taking too long. Ask if we need more time and mean it. It's just food, sure... but in other situations that controlling behavior changes lives, sometimes not for the good. It's just faster--  and look what that's done for humans. I don't want to hear it in a restaurant either. I had to act nice, tip automatically (I feel obligated) and just go because if I thought about it much longer, I would have been angry and told her off.  Good food. Weird service.",

Definitely get the hummus with fresh pita, it's a great start to the meal. For my main dish I tried the pastitsio and a steak skewer. The steak was cooked perfectly, and I mean perfectly. Better than I've had at some high end steakhouses. My only knock on the food was the pastitsio. It had good flavor, but was served barely above room temperature, so after the first couple bites it just did not hold up very well.   All in all, Market Grill Cafe has earned a spot in our usual rotation of places for their variety of dishes , quality of ingredients, and their top class hospitality.",

Excuse me for not remembering the name of the dish but I got the appetizer with the cheese that they light on fire.  I've had it about 6 times in my life before and it always ends up spreadable and delish.   This time it didn't have great flavor and it hardened up way to fast.  I'd take a pass on this item if I had a do-over.   The falafel's didn't hit the spot.  But I've only had it once before so I'm not sure what good falafel even tastes like... so it gets a pass.    The most major downer was the lamb and beef gyro.   It was bland and didn't have that rich tasty flavor I need in my gyro.  The meat wasn't doing it for me.  I kinda wanted to throw it across the room in sadness.     But the service was very quality.  Our server was Athena and she was solid.  I asked for the feta and cheese on the side but when the gyro came out, it was on it.  She kept my soda full enough to look past it.     Clean place with a nice feel to it.

I've been coming to this restaurant for s few years and haven't really been able to really explore much only because my regulars are soo darn tasty!   The chicken pita is delicious, I always get it as a lunch special and that comes with a drink! I also love to get the Slovaki plates served with protein, rice, salad, and a choice of tatziki or hummus! The filet as well as the chicken are both solid options! The steak is always perfectly grilled as is the chicken! Until I ate here I'd never had any type of meat paired with grilled fruit and now it is my addiction! They also have a lemon soup that is just to die for! It isn't your normal soup full of broth! No sir, it's filled with chicken and rice, and packing a whole lot of lemon tangy goodness! Whenever I'm sick this stuff is liquid gold!   Last, they have an infamous pumpkin cheesecake!   Please take a moment of silence to drool!   A pumpkin cheesecake that is not born of two pumpkin parents! No, I guess that would be boring given this baby's base is baklava!! Yessss! A two in one dessert that only gets better with the whipped cream piled high and the caramel sauce drizzling down!   Why are you even reading anymore?

The menu has too many good options to the point of being almost overwhelming! It offers wraps, gyros, salads, traditional Greek entrees, appetizers, pizzas, pastas, and soups. Entrees are offered a la carte or as a full entree with sides for varying appetite levels. The lunch special is a great deal and includes a main item like a gyro, a side, and a drink for $8.50.  I went for the lunch special with a Mediterranean Wrap with Pomegranate Chicken (small upcharge) and Fries (with Greek seasoning). The pomegranate chicken inside of the wrap was delicious and a truly unique offering. The flavor of the overall wrap was great with plenty of vegetables inside. Half of the wrap was plenty of food for me. The Fries were nicely seasoned and tasty as well.  My husband had the Stuffed Green Peppers which were very good. The flavors in the stuffing were delicious and it had plenty of seasoning for flavor. The rice and hummus sides were tasty too. I loved the homemade Greek dressing that came with the salad.   Our server was very friendly and gave us a nice overview of the menu to help us make our lunch choices. After our meal a manager or owner came by to make sure we had a good experience and enjoyed our food. I love businesses that really care about the quality of their food and service.",

They best part is that everything is decently priced for the quality and portion of food you get.",

I had the $7.95 lunch special which included your choice of a lunch entree and a side...my choice was the traditional falafel sandwich with a Greek salad on the side. It was good. The hummus trio looked great, but wasn't as tasty. The best part of the meal was the baklava cheesecake.    The bill came to $34 for two people for lunch. I know I'll be back, but I don't think I'll be a regular here.",

    "text": "Called in a take-away order and picked it up. I ordered pasta stefano - delicate al dente angel hair with a wonderfully light and tangy lemon and garlic sauce, nicely salty Parmesan cheese, capers and fresh basil. I really enjoyed it and wished it was served in a larger portion. I'm used to oversized portions so this was probably a dietary normal size!!   We also had the traditional gyro plate. The gyro meat was nice and tender with traditional flavor. The tsatziki sauce was cool and creamy with a little tang.   Of course we had to get pita bread with tsatziki on the side. The pita was light, served warm and was pleasantly chewy and soft.   We shared a Greek salad to round out our meal. The greens were fresh and crispy. I always look closely at salads to make sure all the greens and vegs are clean. Everything looked well washed and appropriately cleansed.   We finished by sharing the Aphrodite cheesecake and a slice of baklava. I'd never had cheesecake with baklava crust but now I'm convinced that's the way it should be served! It was a much appreciated departure from graham cracker crust although it did make it ultra rich - which was not a bad thing!  The cheesecake itself could have been a little smoother/creamier but it was light and not too dense. The slice of baklava was a little dry. I'm not sure what the authentic prep is but I'm used to baklava saturated in honey sugar glaze. The flavor was great though and I like eating it by peeling later after layer off.   All in all, it was an awesome take away meal. We did without utensils, plates etc because we were just going home to eat it, but everything came well packaged in nice and sturdy containers which is nice for taking away. I am definitely going back for another take away and am going to try some of the other dishes. I can't wait to try the babaganoush, the dolmades, and the falafels, mousaka and spanakopita. They have a trio platter that looks yummy.   If you want take away that is above your just average Chinese, this is the place. The menu has plenty of variety and take away is served nicely. It's convenient also as they have a separate walk in area just for take away orders. Nicely done, guys!  I'll be back.",

There are so many options for sides to include or change in your meal, it's overwhelming. The patio is rather small, so it can get crowded with large parties or on busy days. I ended up being seated against a bush, a very awkward foursome lunch since we all had to face the wall. The check took a bit long to receive, but overall a good experience. I would definitely recommend it compared to some other Mediterranean restaurants in the city",

Her son had tried the pomegranate chicken and raved to her about it. We went on a busy weekend in between shopping. My picky friend wouldn't let me order a drink until she was absolutely certain she wanted to eat there. Lol. I assured her the pomegranate chicken was got good reviews here so she would be safe. She ordered that in a lunch combo. I ordered the gyro and salad lunch combo. The waitress was very patient through my friend's questioning of the ingredients she would be getting. Can I just say the service here is amazing. My drink never went empty during a packed lunch. My friend loved her moist grilled chicken. What a relief! My gyro was moist as well and the tzatiki sauce packed a savory punch. My only gripe is more of personal preference. I like the crispy pieces of gyro meat, salty and crunchy. The gyro meat here is like a moist slice of freshly cooked gyro meatloaf. It's delicious nonetheless but I'm big on texture and I missed that in their gyro.  The baklava was spiced generously and the sweet taste wasn't overwhelming the nutty cinnamon notes. I'll be back to try more of the menu for sure. :)",

I know a lot of people like this restaurant style and set up but I liked it the old way, like how Lake Mead/Rock Springs has it.  But whichever set up they have, the food is still tasty good.    I come here so often, especially during my lunch break at work, that the owner knows exactly what I like to order and always places my order in while I'm being sat down to eat, how cool.  I like to sit at the booths but they have many open tables available and a special room for larger parties.  Patio seating too.    My favorite dish continues to be Pomegranate Chicken and Baklava for dessert!  A minor gripe would be the young and inexperience servers.  I give them the benefit of the doubt because they're young and new but wow, some of them continue to not improve.",

The two were just awesome, and the main server was there the whole way guiding me through the menu on what I could and couldn't eat due to me being a vegan (besides eggs).   Even when I thought I just wanted water, the one in training mentioned a jasmine blackberry iced tea and I was sold. Everything I had was very tasty and I wanted to just keep ordering stuff but I was so stuffed.   What I ordered: hummus (original style w no cheese), tabouli, vegetable wrap with the spinach tortilla, jasmine blackberry tea.  Seriously so yum!

I've come to the conclusion that every yelper from North Vegas has really bad taste in food or they're stuck in an area with atrocious food and they THINK places like this is actually good.  I started my meal with Falafels. Incredibly salty. They pressed the idea that everything is homemade at their location. Why isn't the chef or the cooks tasting any of the food before they're sent out? Don't order this unless you like making funny faces because the salt is overwhelming.  I ordered the filet tenderloin wrap and my date ordered a chicken skewer a la carte. My wrap was pretty bland and had barely any pieces of meat. It was mostly filled with carbs. My date's chicken skewer was dry. The best thing that came out of the kitchen was the vegetable skewer that came with the chicken skewer.   If you want to get a really good chicken skewer, go to Crazy Pita. If you want some fresh falafels that are truly made to order fresh, go to Sababa's on Durango / Desert Inn.   This place sucks. Wont come back. Haven't found a decent place to eat in North Vegas yet......... Running out of options ....",

We order the gyros  chicken pomegranate it's  has a deep flavor and Greek salad. The best lunch for quick, satisfying and delicious. We were then visited by the owner Joe who is italian and his wife is greek who happen to originate from Icaria one of the island of Greece and she brought that cooking style in restaurants. They even have like a open cooking area to show the freshness. Did some Google search we found out people live there very long average mortality age is 90 years old, it says people forget to die Lol, eating the same diet or cooking. I love this place, definitely will go back, we're gonna try the one close to our home too.",

We told them about it and waited another 10 min extra to have them remake it. The manager brings out the food and without any apology, simply said \"i hate raw onions too\" and walked away. Had to get the food to go because my baby was over being there and didn't get to enjoy a meal with my mom. Worst customer service.

My husband decided to try what they are famous for, their pomegranate chicken. It was delicious and he absolutely loved it. It was fork tender and the flavors were divine. The entree option came with a  with a Greek Salad and some pita and hummus. It was served with Basmati rice. I decided on the Gyro entree which also included the salad and hummus with pita. I thought the Greek salad dressing was lacking a bit and the salad could have used more feta. My Gyro was fresh and good, but the Tzaziki  sauce also in my opinion was lacking depth. The gyro meat was very good as was the rice it was served with. I had a glass of the house red Cabernet and for $5 I was very impressed. My husband felt the beer menu was lacking a bit and would have enjoyed a selection of some more local beers. Our service was incredible, we had a wonderful waiter and we saved 10% for a Yelp check in. I would certainly go back because the menu is extensive and I would love to try more of their Greek options.",

This place has a lot of seating but you can be asked to wait because of the number of servers available. The decor is simple and clean with a old fashion vibe to it. The decor does have this generic \"wannabe\" Olive Garden live to it. I ordered the filet skewer which comes with a salad, 1 filet skewer, 1 vegetable skewer, rice, and pita bread. They also have wraps, gyros, and pastas. Next time I want to try the falafel. Overall, this place is decently price, it's a sit down restaurant and food quality is okay but you get what you pay for. Definitely worth a try for lunch or dinner.",

Half of the plate was covered with rice and that had way too much parsley in it! Wasn't even distributed properly!! Big huge chunks in it were making me gag. Plus, the Gyro meat was absolutely tasteless! I had to put tatziki sauce on it and there wasn't quite enough of that!! Afraid to ask for more as I read from other Yelpers that they charge dearly for it. I was served a small amount of pita which didn't quite go far either! I guess they make up for it by serving copious amounts of rice!! The whole plate was not balanced at all. My companion had ordered salad with his meal, but it didn't arrive until he was halfway through his meal. Really??",

The Spanikopita and rice was cold and had zero flavor when I ordered it. The only item I actually enjoyed here was the Tabbouleh. I personally feel like they're whitewashing authentic Greek flavors to Americanize their food. Big mistake! Not sure what's in the Basmati rice but it's not Greek nor is it Indian. It's just full of herbs...no lemon flavor at all. And for the price the servings should be Greek size not one tiny piece of Spanikopita, dry rice, and a head of lettuce which the core should be removed first. I'll stick to eating at Yassou Greek Grill Cafe because the food is more authentically Greek!",

I ordered an appetizer of Tzatziki & Pita bread slices and the chicken & veggie kabobs with the rice & salad for dinner. Everything was cooked to order and served promptly. The Tzatziki was VERY tasty! Not too strong and not too bland. The salad and dressing were also tasty. The chicken and veggie skewers were flavorful without being too dry. I scraped the chicken and veggies off of each skewer and mixed them all together in with my rice. YUM!   I wish I would have saved room for dessert...everything looked and smelled delicious, but I just had NO room in my tummy for it after that wonderful meal.

We were also in and out in an hour but we were not rushed--they served us at our pace.  I felt like we could have enjoyed a slow leisure meal if we wished.  All the staff were very friendly--I'd come back just for the service!  But the food was delish.  We had the Saganaki (flambeed cheese!!--genius) as an appetizer.  I had the Pomegranate chicken salad and my daughter had the Pasta Stefano chicken (I stole a bite and it was good).  We ended with the baclava cheesecake--highly recommended!",

    "text": "So this was my first time at this resturant...(I did a to-go order) Such a cute and adorable place. Its busy and in a very busy shopping center. I can see they do good business.  The staff is so sweet and friendly and I love the vibe... So for that I would definitely give it a 5 star!!... But I was a but disappointed in what I ordered.  I ordered the falafel gyro for my self and a traditional one for my boyfriend.  The salad was great ... The rice so so.. The gyro wasnt my favorite. I didnt like the falafel... It was mushy and raw on the inside. Ive had alot of falafel and this wasnt ranked in the top. I think they make them too round and big so they dont get cooked all the way on the inside/center .. Im a vegetarian so I know what I like as far as falafel goes. I also ordered their seasoned fries... Which are not listed as fries so you'll have to ask the server.  They were amazing!!! I got 2 orders!! ......... TO SUM IT UP:  So I wanted to give a higher review.. But I think I will have to try the food again and maybe order something different. So over all cute spot.. And they obviously do good business.. As it was busy when I went at about 1pm- mid week..... Id say give it a try... Its got a real cute atmosphere and might be a great date spot. Definitely get the fries...lol. So hopefully next time I can up the stars on my food as well.... Thats why 3 stars. Enjoy!!",

Waitress said she would be right back with the items. Ordered ice tea when she came back to wipe down table she sat us at. Waited and waited and she came back to take our order and reminded her about the ice teas. Still no utensils. Usually they bring salads right away. Finally got ice teas, no salads yet. Finished glass of ice tea, waitress passed and said she would bring out some more tea, got tea and still no salads. Filled up tea and still no salads. I get that Saturday nights are busy but they were no busier then I have seen them in the past. Finally salads come out. Told the gentleman who delivered thanks and let him know that utensils would be nice, he said \"I will be right back with some\". Waiting, now our main entree comes and still waiting on those utensils. Guess we will start on the entrees if we ever get those utensils, as the salad can stand to sit awhile. I look at window where there is a \"HELP WANTED\" sign. I love this place and the food is wonderful but they really do need to find help because I feel it may make a difference in having repeat customers. I would have given less stars but the food is really wonderful, but the service leaves a lot to be desired.",

The owners do a great job keeping quality and knowledgeable employees and often will personally greet guests. I told them they should expand, but they actually love what they do and have a genuine commitment to the unique dining experience they provide.  Actual Greek and Italian food under one roof, with a fair price and great atmosphere probably has not been seen since the decline of the Greco-Roman empire. Other people try to do it, and I been around the world many times, but the Market Grille and Cafe is on the money in the way they provide their dining experience and cafe style.  If I had a physically attractive girl with a net worth of 1 billion dollars or more, then I would still take her here and she would love it. I know I can get a dining experience with distinction and class here or a quick bit of food. They even cater, have live music, and everyone acts right because they are well trained and/or the owners know how to both lead and manage.  You really can't have the Market Grille Cafe fail you. It's a top of the line small business and it is a pleasure and honor to know places like this still exist. Will be back unless I die sooner than I am planning on.  I live in Las Vegas. We have a lot of shisty people and businesses...that's what we are known for, among other things, but Joe and Rhonda have a great restaurant. Keep up the good work. Great to see this entity in our city.  I'll stop writing now, but hopefully you get the idea that this is a great and unique place. Food, service, price, atmosphere, ect... are all excellent.",

But this place has peeved me each time, yet, I still return because the pita and lemon cilantro hummus is my addiction and it offers such a great lunch menu. It definitely beats having to drive a way for Mediterranean food and I always double thumbs up for that!   We used to eat here when they were back at the centennial shopping center area, and at the time I was not as impressed. However, I can honestly say they have greatly improved. Their pomegranate chicken is always tender and juicy. Although, I don't specifically order that for myself...I always can't help but to take a bite off my kids plate.   Their veggies are always so fresh and crisp so I appreciate that especially because I'll order a wrap or gyro. Their gyros are usually stuffed as I find myself struggling to monster bite into it. Lol. Their Platos potatoes seem to be just the frozen store.bought fries...but that's okay because they season it well and the dip that comes with it is rather simple.but good!   My only gripe that leaves me.annoyed is for the most part...service is very slow especially during lunch time. My husband works nearby so we like having lunch dates here and I have to go there first then do the text of I just ordered come.on up. We have gone for dinner and I was pretty irked at how.slow and seemingly neglectful the waitress was. She apologized because she had a lot of tables, but I mean...we were there before it got chaotic. From the look on everyone else's faces, I'm sure they were thinking the same thing. It's cool...I get it.  Other than that...yeah, good place to get your Mediterranean fix without doing the journey somewhere else! Definitely recommend! Kid and stroller friendly!  Enjoy!",

The service is prompt and the food is beyond the best. I've dine with them few times now and i think a well review is due. Their exceptional service is consistent. The servers are polite, patient and very helpful. I ordered their traditional gyro with hummus today, usually i do it with dill yogurt instead but i wanna try something different. Their hummus is really good but personally i prefer my usual yogurt, \"its a comment i did mention to my server when we were having a regular conversation.\" without asking my server, he brought me a yogurt dill sauce on the side for me to dip my gyro. Theres no words to say to compliment their service. I never saw the bottom of my glass. They kept refilling my drinks wothout me asking for it. And i think one of the owners of the place goes around greeting everyone making sure their guest are always happy and satisfied. You gotta try their dessert too. I love their tiramisu cheesecake, fluffy and ozzing with yumminess. This awesome cafe have the best food and service in town. If you're in NorthWest side of Las Vegas, NV. try this place, you wont be disaapointed.",

The service was great and the food mmmm how can I describe it superb!  Since today was our first run we went with the traditional gyro, with their speciality rice and greek salads. We definitely will be back, there's more food for us to try.",

This time my wine was warm. I asked the server if I could have another glass of the wine cold. The owner came over to inform me that the wine is correct temperature with a snotty tone and she suggested I have ice cubes with my wine. Since I received my warm wine which my friends also confirmed was warm they have been checking the wine fridge. The wine is warm and I thought the customer was always right, even if she disagrees with me about the wine temp she should at least be kind. I am disappointed in the owner!",

    "text": "I have been here about three times and not one negative experience.  Despite it's location next to many prefab, commercialized eating establishments, Market Grille Cafe is truly a diamond in the rough From the time you walk in you immediately notice a nicely decorated place setting the tone that you are about to enjoy yourself.  The next sensation are the smells that begin to prime the taste buds for the wonderful meal that you are about enjoy.  The first few times I was here I pretty much did the Gyro thing and as Gyros go, I was happy.  Tonight, while on a date with my girl, I thought I would branch out and try something different.  I ordered the steak skewers entree which included hummus with pita bread, salad and rice.  My girl ordered the pomegranate salad. An interesting chose I thought.  They staff is so darn friendly and helpful you almost feel transported to another time when this behavior was expected in all restaurants.  They do a great job.  Tonight seemed a bit slow and less noisy than the other times I have been here.  It made for a nice evening of conversation before and after our meal arrived.  Before even taking a bite, I went for a taste of the pomegranate salad.  My first bite told me that this was something special.  Your first hit with pomegranate flavor that explodes in your mouth,  It then begins to disappear and the texture and touches of chicken that did not soak up the marinade follow through.    I could feel the foodie Barbarian inside me begin to take over but reminded myself that I am a gentleman and proceeded to allow my girl to eat in peace.  My meal was perfectly seasoned and looked incredible.  I started off with the house salad on the plate which was fresh and light with the prefect amount dressing.  The olives and cheese made it only better.  The steak was cooked to a medium well and when they were hot they melted in my mouth.  On must always eat their veggies.  I have a phobia about veggies that I am not going to talk about because I don't need to.  The veggie skewers after their consumption required me to get up an order one more because it was just so good.  Two Plates of great chow with drinks for twenty dollars even.  I found the deal most acceptable.  They also have a punch card program for $10 off your meal.  Don't forget to get one.  The desserts looked awesome but my ever expanding waistline told me that I had better not.  Even as the staff was closing up shop they allowed us to continue our conversation on of all things \"Andre The Giant.\"  They gave no indication of being annoyed with us.  I appreciated that.  They will soon be making a move to a larger venue on Durango & Elk Horn.  I wish them continued success and will gladly drive 30 miles across the valley to eat there again.  This should say something about the experience.  OPA!",

The chicken skewer entree, stuffed peppers, pumpkin cheesecake, and cannoli are some of my favorites. Their entree meals are very fulfilling and reasonably priced too; included with the entree of choice you get pita with hummus, Greek salad, and rice pilaf.

    "text": "I have seriously eaten here over 50 times, and I know this because of all the \"frequent diner\" cards I burn through.  I came here when they very first opened and have been hooked ever since.  It is pretty hard to find a quality, affordable, non-chain, veg-friendly restaurant to go to in this town- but Market Grille fits the bill.  Everything is homemade and the ingredients are always fresh.  The service is always very friendly, and even though it's more of a fast-food set up, they are always coming by to make sure everything is ok.  The space is homey and casual.  The salad, hummus, and pita never disappoint.  I usually get the veggie skewers and my husband usually orders the veggie gyro.  When we really want to pig out, we order the combo appetizer platter as well.    And I really can't even begin to describe to you my love affair with their cheesecake (and their pumpkin cheesecake, for that matter).  This has been my birthday cake for the last couple years.  Their prices are affordable and they have vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free menus.  We have brought several family members here while they were visiting Vegas, and they all still talk about how great the restaurant was and how they wish they could have a slice of the cheesecake.",

I ordered the appetizer sampler as my meal and everything was great. The falafel was actually the best I have ever had. I also got the lentil soup which was amazing. My friend got the traditional gyro and really loved it. I also got moussaka to take home to my boyfriend. It's his favorite food and he said it was definitely one of the best versions he had too.

I also recommend the pomegranate chicken very refreshing and out of the ordinary that yoy will usually see here in vegas.

    "text": "I think the best way to describe this place is consistent, fresh and clean eating. Nothing here is overly greasy, everything feels light enough that this isn't your guilty meal spot. If you have dietary restrictions or are gluten free, vegan, etc, they are very accommodating. There aren't many places up here I would say you could eat fresh, and this is a nice solitude.   This used to be in the Centennial shopping in a small space, but they've upgraded to a sit down service restaurant just up the road. I much prefer it here since you're not bumping chairs with the table behind you. I didn't mind getting up to get my own drink and all before, but now they have servers here which makes sense for the space.  I have tried a few things on the menu, but I normally get the same things. With entrees you can go a la carte with just rice or a combo has with salad, pita and tzatziki or hummus. Their rice is seasoned and soft, the hummus is more liquidy and plainer than I like but I do like their tzatziki. Pomegranate chicken is always cooked right and juicy. Greek Trio has moussaka, patstitsio, spanakopita. I think overall those are decent versions, but moussaka is my favorite of the 3.Gyro plate/Vasilios plate gyros are soft and never dried out, comes with rice, salad, pita, tzatziki and hummus already. Gyro pizza is different, but good! Think of it as like a open faced gyro sandwich with tomato sauce as a base.  Combination platter is a appetizer but makes for a good vegetarian meal too with hummus, babaganoush, salad, lots of pita, and some falafel. I think their falafel here is just okay, they are sort've dense when I prefer a fluffier and moist inside.  Their cheesecake here is surprisingly good. They do a baklava crust instead of graham cracker so that little bit does it over the top. I get the pumpkin cheesecake usually. Baklava is decent, but not my favorite in town.   People who work here are pretty friendly and generally attentive. It's a  family owned business and I like to support our locals.",

Surprisingly enough I waited a minute or two see if she returned the call nope so I called back and completed the order without an apology just a comment of that some times happens, order was to be ready in 15-20 minutes i arrive in the allotted time maybe even 5 minutes late to pickup my order girl at counter finish up with customer in front of me and then I give my name she rings it up accepts payment, then waits on the next person in line, to my shock I sat there for another 20 minutes after everyone before and after me picked up their orders, the girl (who rang me up) looks at me and says have you been helped I said yes I was picking up she ask my name and returns with my order. I ask her how long has it being sitting back there she response it just came up, She opens the boxes to show me the food that is not even warm to the touch. I said this is bull she says I am sorry. I left and checked the food yes it was cold. The long and short any response other than flat out lying would have been acceptable. I used to like this place however if the cannot train the employees to admit when a mistake has been made and offer to rectify the issue then I have spent my last dollar at this place.",

Every time I go to scan something, the punch card changes so it makes it nearly impossible to fill up your card because it disappears and you have to start all over with a new card. For example, it used to be: A) buy a pomegranate chicken, get a stamp; B) buy a dessert, get a stamp; C) buy an entree, get a stamp. Now it's get a stamp for every $10 you spend. By the time I come back, it will likely change again! Furthermore, the app hardly works. I reset the app multiple times and could not get the camera to work. The cashier at Take Out wrote a note on my receipt to bring in next time and hope that the app works then so they can give me the stamps from today's visit. This was all after I asked her if they had a back up system for when the app fails. Technology is great, until it doesn't work. Management should have a back up plan for this kind of error. The cashier stated she said had seen this error with the camera before.   Also, I was expecting to see the Take Out area full since all the designated spots were taken out front... NOPE! I was the only one there. Note to customers, read the signs and don't park there if you aren't taking out.",

The last 3 times i have had to send my food back, It is very frustrating to wait on my food when the everyone is eating and they have to then wait on me. I have asked mgmt if they have new cooks and they replied \"no we are just busy\". The food is also sub par, the hummus is thin and the dolmas are dry and hard to eat. Yesterday my bill came to $54.00, I put a $100.00 in the check folder and then left to do some quick grocery shopping at  Smiths Grocery in the same parking lot. I immediately realized I had not left a tip. I returned within 30 minutes to ask the girl for the check folder back and she denied I had left the $44.00 dollars. So basically they stole $44.00 of my money. I would of a left a very generous holiday tip but not $44.00. Mgmt was no help. They called the owner who also was no help. He basically didn't believe me. Is this the way to treat a patron who has continually spent around $250.00 a month over $44.00? This place has sub par food, a dishonest waitress and a restaurant that treats you this poorly .",

I saw the reviews, it was close to work so I figured let's give it a go!  I ordered the spanakopita entree.  His favorite dish is the \"spinach pie\" so I wanted to surprise him.  I decided to buy us both the entree, which came with the spanakopita, greek salad, basmati rice, and pita bread and hummis.  First, let me tell you...I LOVE IT and I am an extremely picky eater.  The spanakopita was delicious, just the right amount of flavors.  The greek salad had an amazing dressing that didn't over power the salad and brought out all of the natural flavors.  The basmati rice was to die for - the rice literally melted in my mouth and so flavorful.  The hummis was hands down the best hummis I've ever had.  Hummis was the only greek thing I've ever had and only tried store bought.  The hummis here was so yummy.  My husband said this was the best \"spinach pie\" he's ever had.  I talked about this place so much at work that a gal who travels frequently and who is greek stated she never had been there.  Well, she went the next night after I talked it up so much.  Her comment the next day, \"I had the Lamb Gyro and it was the best Gyro I've ever had.\"  Kudos to the Market Grille - you guys have become my favorite food spot in Vegas.

Chicken Salad, Traditional Gyro, Hummus appitizer and some aphrodite cheesecake for desert.  The food was very tastey, the chicken was fall apart deliciousness in my opinion.  Desert was fantastic.  My only issue I had was with the staff, walked in, and guess they asume everyone's been there at one point or another.  Was directed to the take out area  after standing in the doorway looking puzzled for about 3-4 minutes.  Got there, sign on the wall says \"ring bell for service\".   OK.....this is a cafe, not a hotel, but alright.  Rang the bell....and nobody shows up after another 1-2 minutes, I ring it again, feeling a bit silly now.  I walked back out, and an older woman asked if I needed help and I said yea, I do, I've been ringing your bell for 5 minutes in the back and haven't seen anybody and I have $40 worth of food hanging out in your kitchen.  They brought out the food, checked it all before baging it up and even gave me a coupon for next time, which was nice, as I wasn't really mad about the situation, just annoyed that I was directed by the teenagers they have working as their cashiers but nobody had the motivation to go to the back and see what I wanted until I came back out and publicly and loudly asked for it.",

Super friendly staff - you feel like you are with family.  Our server knew all the dishes and ingredients - very impressive.  Joe, the owner, comes and greets you - super nice guy.  Can't wait to go back and try more dishes. 5 STARS!",

I was not impressed with the pomegranate chicken; it tasted over-marinated, and almost mealy texture-- while many may rave about it, I don;t think I would order it again.   Do, however, order the traditional baklava or the Aphrodite cheesecake, and you won;t be disappointed!",

Their Gyros are awesome, the only criticism I would give is they tend to pack a bit too much lettuce in compared which seems that they are skimping on the meat.  The greek fries are also great as they are seasoned perfectly.  The dipping sauce they have is awesome.  On the down side, by wife and I have tried their tabouli 3 separate times, and each time, it was spoiled.  It wasn't just a matter of it being a bit old, it was flat out stinky and nasty.  The first two times we brought it back to the restaurant (carry out) and they confirmed it had spoiled and gave us a refund.  The third time we just gave up lol.  A few times some of our items have had tomatoes in them and they were mealy.  Not good :(  Overall, the place puts out decent food, just stay away from the tabouli.",

I was able to try their moussaka today. The eggplant tasted fresh, potatoes were tender and the beef was seasoned just right. Although nothing really comes close to the food in Greece, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. It tasted fresh rather then cooked, freezed and thawed when ordered. Greek salad came on the side which was fresh as well.  Along with my entree also came pita and hummus. The hummus was quite tasty. Mmmmm...  Before leaving...I tried the Aphrodite's Cheesecake as I read it won a few food awards. It had a baklava bottom crust. Delicious! The cheesecake itself was rich and creamy. The baklava on the bottom was yummy, but not crisp due to the cheese cake sitting on top.  Overall...it was worth the try and I will be back to try more things on their menu.",

Mine was just overall sweet and tasted like they just added pomegranate jelly, at my old place I used to order something similar but it was an actual pomegranate sauce with rice we would get.

The open grill area where the pita bread is made is a nice touch, too! Unfortunately, the service marred our festive gathering.  The flaming presentation of the Saganaki app set the bar high for food expectations but everything was downhill from there. Menu  is pretty standard- being familiar with their dishes, I know what I like and chose accordingly. The falafel wrap is my usual go-to, and this time I switched it up for the pom chicken and it was flavorful. I sampled friends' orders and the Mama Mia chicken (with goat cheese and balsamic) was tasty, but I did not care for the various pasta dishes, the sauces just did not taste right. Also, most components of the Mediterranean Medley app were off (hummus was bland, babaghanouj had a strange texture, hummus was thin and watery, and dolmas tasted plain).  Most of us enjoyed our food, but man. The service. It seems they are incapable of handling a large (10 person?) group. This was a classic example of why I hate autograt for groups- our server was polite enough when she was around but was less than attentive and repeatedly needed to be flagged down for the basics, like placing orders, correcting orders, address billing issues, etc. The bare minimum was not met.   We interacted with the manager, who was also initially friendly, but even when he stepped in to help with billing, it was still a disaster: unable to honor a discount (several military in our group), unable to split the bill appropriately, that ridiculous autograt in light of the whole fiasco, several excuses and a bunch of time-wasting, and a general lack of capability. It took literally half an hour to resolve, and it only ended because one friend just put it all on their card and took cash and IOUs from everyone else. Generous, but ridiculous that it was warranted! And it wasn't just us- a third-party food delivery person came in, had an issue, spoke with the manager, and then knocked over a holiday display in anger as he left. I'll stick to the Lake Mead location.",

    "text": "The food was good, but the service left a sour taste in my mouth.  Market Grille Cafe is absurdly far from my place in Henderson, but I was willing to drive to Centennial Hills to meet up with some Yelp friends for a holiday gathering. We certainly had our share of socializing and gift-giving, but when it came down to the restaurant experience, we had service issues which added up to at least 30 minutes' worth of time wasted. And that's a very, very generous estimate.  For starters, our server seemingly ignored us for most of the time other than asking us what we wanted to drink. Perhaps this can be attributed to the crowded restaurant, including a large party in a private room to the side, but they should have either called in another employee or warned us in advance about the possible delay. We had to wave our server down both to order some appetizers and later on to request our entrees.  When entrees were brought out, my moussaka had mistakenly went to a friend who had ordered pastitsio, and an employee was calling out their pastitsio as moussaka. Yes, both are similarly layered dishes, but that shouldn't be an issue. You should be able to call the right dishes out regardless. (We did get the right entrees eventually.)  Finally, there was a concern with paying the bill which I'm not fully clear on, but some confusion at least resulted from the kitchen's mistake on one tablemate's entree necessitating a send-back/replacement order and some sort of change to the bill. And then there were concerns with splitting the check, which surely shouldn't be that difficult for a restaurant that has been around for so long and has such long tables as the one which accommodated the 11 of us. Oh, and it looked like 20% automatic gratuity was applied on top of all that? That was the last straw. I tip 15% minimum on principle and that would've possibly been too much tonight.  Food was pretty solid, for what it's worth. The saganaki ($11), a famous flaming Greek cheese dish, had all the presentation value and plenty of cheesy flavor (accompanied by sliced pita \"wedges\"). The moussaka entree ($13) was surprisingly light and fluffy, perhaps ending up a bit light on the meat compared to other restaurants' renditions. The sides were pretty solid, although the basmati rice was a bit undersalted, the hummus was oddly a little thin, and I can't ever understand why they don't dice the olives up in Greek salad. Bites of dishes such as spaghetti and Mamma Mia's Chicken were also satisfying. I could've probably given 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 if I didn't have other concerns.  That said, I simply can't envision myself ever returning to Market Grille Cafe with any sort of larger group. The food was tasty but not unique, the location kinda sucks for me (and anyone else who doesn't live in Centennial Hills or perhaps Aliante), and although I'm usually patient person, I really could've used the wasted time tonight in particular.",

I would never have suspected that the food here could be anything more than average.  This all changed when I was invited to lunch at Market Grille Cafe. I wasn't sure how to politely convince the party I was in that I would rather go anywhere else, so I conceded.   Upon arrival, I was greeted by friendly staff, and seated promptly. These details remain important as the customer service aspect of this restaurant is what fostered such an enjoyable environment.   As for the food, I can't lie to you because it would go against everything that I stand for. That being said, it was very good. This was not some completely gourmet, innovative culinary experience, but food doesn't always have to be. The food is good quality, fresh, and presumably made with love. I think, in this case, that's enough for me.",

We are so grateful that they did.   From the moment we were seated (there was no wait), Raymond, our awesome server, greeted us with a superb introduction to this little family owned restaurant. He was prompt with our order and made fantastic recommendations. We had the Saganaki appetizer, the Avgolemono soup, the Pomegranate Chicken, the Greek Trio, and took home a big slice of pumpkin cheesecake for later. Everything, even the side dish of rice and hummus, was spectacular.  We had so much food, that we took our left overs and dessert back to our friends. The minute we shared our experience, the leftovers began to disappear.  Thank you to Raymond and the Market Grill for making our visit even that much more memorable!! We will be back!!!",

    "text": "Came for an early dinner on a Saturday night at 5 pm. Made a reservation but it wasn't necessary by any means. Sat outside on the patio as it was a beautiful day. I had my 4 month old and we had plenty of space to start. Sever was nice and informative about specials and drinks. We ordered a pitcher of sangria and saganaki to start. The saganaki was the best part of our experience. The saganaki is a piece of cheese sitting in olive oil, lemon, and brandy that is lit on fire table side. It was served with warm pita bread. Delicious. We ordered three entrees to share (we often just pass plates to try a little of every thing). The Greek trio was odd and underwhelming. Think shepherds pie, baked ziti, and spinach with filo dough. Eh. The pomegranate chicken was highly recommended and was the dish the waitress said was an award winner. Didn't win any awards in our book. Was VERY sweet...but at the same time not flavorful? Lastly, the vasilios platter was basically a deconstructed gyro. Again, not a lot of flavor and a bit underwhelming. The sataziki and hummus were perfectly acceptable. Our peaceful evening turned a bit sour when a family of 8 arrived with their 70 pound dog. He jumped on another guest not a part of their party and tired multiple times to get over to us and our food. Waitresses frequently were seen petting and interacting with the dog, which left a sour taste in my mouth. Got dessert to go. The aphrodites cheesecake was again supposed to be another award winner per our waitress. We took about three bites before we threw it away. The worlds best dessert, aka the chocolate baklava, was terrible. Something was terribly burnt and bitter. We will not return for dinner, but will probably return for sangria and appetizers (that cheese is amazing).",

    "text": "Excellent food and freshly made. For appetizers we ordered Saganaki and Falafel. The Saganaki had brandy that was lit of fire as the waitress approached the table. It arrived with a side of freshly made flat bread. The Falafel was a little too minty for me but a hit for everyone else at the table. For the main meal my husband ordered the Greek trio and I the Keftedes (meatballs), both a la carte.  Very well prepared and favor full and the portions are huge! Needless to say, we were stuffed and had to take out leftovers home.   Oh the service was inconsistent. While the ordering process and getting the food to the table was fast (only 5% of the restaurant was full), the follow-up on the drinks needed some improvement...or perhaps after a hiatus from American service and spending the Holidays from Germany, I had expected more?",

The restaurant interior is warm and welcoming. Everyone is friendly and this made me want to eat her even more. My friend discovered this place a while back and couldn't stop talking about how fresh and yummy the food was so I made her take me!  We started off our dinner with the Saganaki cheese appetizer. Oh my! This was so creamy and rich tasting. I could have easily enjoyed this with a salad and been satisfied but it was Friday night, just got paid so we proceeded to enjoy ourselves. Next came my entree which was the Mamma Mia chicken, goat cheese with a fig preserve and pistachios. Each bite of this dish literally melted in my mouth. I would have never thought to mix these ingredients together, but this dish was absolutely scrumptious. My friend enjoyed the Pomegranate Chicken which was marinated in pomegranate juices and herbs. Very flavorful!  The service was superb and our server was outgoing and bubbly. Whatever we needed, she had it brought out immediately. The owner made a point of coming over and asking me if I enjoyed my meal and had a genuine interest in what I had to say. She then gave me a card for a 15% discount on my next visit, which believe me there will be a second, third and quite possibly I could become a regular here. There are so many other dishes that I want to try and I did not get an opportunity to taste dessert. In addition to the food, they have a nice wine list to compliment your entree' which I took advantage of since red wine always makes you feel fine! So glad I took the time to check this place out and will happily be returning soon for some more \"kalo fagito\" as the Greek people say!",

But I was slightly disappointed.  The prices seem high, the service seems unfocused and overall, the food was just ok.  Nothing fantastic unfortunately.  And one thing that I thought was highly weird is that the drink station is out in the open, like a fast food place.  I had waited for 5-8 minutes for our server to notice that my iced tea was nearing empty and ask if I needed a refill, but nothing.  So, I proceeded to get up myself and walk the 10 feet to the drink station directly across from our table to refill my drink and I was blocked by 2 different servers, who directed me to go sit back down and they would call my server over.  They were nice and friendly about it, but it was just weird to me.",

I swear they have changed some of their recipes and age old standbys like hummus or basmati rice have, in order, yogurt and lemon added. Why ruin a good thing? I originally came for the traditional fare and have no need of a modernized version. I still love their attitude, but the food has suffered.",

    "text": "This place is almost too good to be True from the moment you step foot in the door to the moment you leave.  My wife and I had just left the rudest gyro place in vegas and decided to try another one.  We find the Market Grille and decide to give her a shot.  We walk in and WOW.  The place was beautiful.  It was lit up but not too bright, music was playing just loud enough to be relaxing and everyone in there looked happy.   After being blown away on the appearance, we get to the cashier and this girl was just a joy to be around.  Helpful, nice, smiling, happy and we couldn't have been happier.  So after taking our order we sit down.  I get up to go wash my hands and come back and see the waiter already at the table.  I sit down with my wife and this guy Michael or Mike has to be the greatest waiter i've ever met.  I've never laughed so much at a restaurant before.  He was able to describe everything on the menu to a science.  Nicest guy in the world.    So we ordered 1 lamb and beef Gyro and 1 all lamb Gyro, a family size seasoned fries, and 2 drinks.  Before I could finish filling up my drink cup, Mike, with that huge smile on his face, was bringing us the biggest, most delicious looking fries i've ever seen with some kind of orange looking sauce.  We ask about the sauce and Mike just winks and says \"trust me.\"  So we eat the fries and thank god we trusted him because we fell in love with that orange spicy sauce on those fries.  So good.......so good.  So then we get our Gyros and I swear, we took one bite and went into heaven.  I saw my wife's eyes literally rolled back when she took a bite.  She couldn't even finish chewing before she had to tell me how tender and good the meat was.  By  the way, those Gyros were massive.  We utterly destroyed those Gyros.  I can't remember the dessert she had, but it was a yellow looking cake and she finished it so fast, I'm not sure if she tasted it lol.  By far,one of the best experiences at a resteraunt.  I think we payed a little over 20 bucks for everything.  I know the Gyro's were 8 bucks each.  By far, the best 20 dollars you'll ever spend.  I can't wait to go back.",

Drove all the way across town to have a cup. Met my expectations!   Then I decided to order something different and simple... of course, a gyro! It looked delicious, a generous pile of meat, lettuce, tomato, onion with cucumber sauce all wrapped up in pita bread!  The pita bread was soft, warm and tasted great. Unfortunately the meat had no seasoning which resulted in no flavor. A few too many diced onions for my taste. Ok to eat, but I have had better. This is the first thing I have ever ordered here that I didn't like.. But that won't stop me from coming back!   The service is great! Rose greets you at the door as though you are coming into your home and a server immediately greets you! If you have a question about the menu, everyone is very knowlegable about all the dishes The food is always served hot and tastes great!  Even though I didn't like my gyro, I will soon drive across town again for the Pumpkin Mushroom Soup and something else I have not tried yet on the menu!",

How you can give this place anything over 4 stars is just beyond silly.  The great thing about this place is that it fills a niche that is totally unfilled in the area.  The food is generally decent, even if a little over priced.  The portions are generous depending on what you get.  Be sure to order extra tzatziki sauce for your gyro, as they are very stingy with it here.  The most disappointing part of this place is the atmosphere.  From the outside, it looked like a very nice, perhaps even romantic atmosphere, akin to Macaroni Grill or even the Olive Garden.  The minute I walked in, all of those expectations were crushed.  The environment is much more laid back and cheap than what it seems from the outside. It has an almost fast food feel.  The best thing that I can compare it to is Fazoli's Italian fast food chain for those of you that have been there. At any rate, it's a decent place, but certainly not anything above average.",

It taste extremely watered down, where's the tahini? The food is far from mind-blowing and I hate having that \"bland mindset\" after a meal as if I didn't get much out of it. The falafel was extremely bland and very dry. The salad that came with the gyro was very wilted. I want to really like this place but not sure if i'd want to go back.",

We started with the Saganaki appetizer, which was served with warm pita bread and was absolutely amazing! All of the food came out in a timely fashion.  My husband and I both ordered the steak kabobs which came with basmati rice, a Greek salad and a side of pita bread with hummus. The meat was lacking in flavor for me, but my husband said his was fantastic so maybe I just got a batch that hadn't marinated long enough. We ended with a rice pudding for dessert which was pretty mushy and definitely not the best that I've had.  Overall the service was wonderful and the food was good. I will definitely go back to try other things on their menu. The saganaki itself is worth returning for.",

Unfortunately the gyro meat is only ok. It has a weird taste and it is always mushy, never crispy. The falafel is dry and bland and pretty gritty. There is definitely better greek food in town, especially for the price.",

I wanted to rate this higher, but I did not care for the tabbouleh at all - it was really missing something (it kinda tasted like grass clippings with a squeeze of lemon).  I also had the pomegranate chicken wrap with \"dill sauce\" (wish they didn't dumb down tzatziki), which was quite delicious and really hit the spot.  Thumbs up for a military discount and super friendly staff.  I will probably try this place again when I am in the area.",

The saganaki was great (but how much can you mess that up?), the veg dolmades were very strangely sweet and just didn't taste right (but at least were homemade and better than the oily, canned varieties).  My Mamma Mia chicken may have been great but the chicken was so incredibly overcooked, dry, hard little shards on the outside, that it reminded me of the turkey in Griswold Family Christmas.  We nearly sent it back but since our waitress was already wildly efficient but none too friendly, I didn't feel like dealing with it.  The sides were okay (hummus, potatoes), my husband thought his spanakopita was just average but that his pastitio and moussaka were good.  I've had greek food before (not just in American restaurants but in Greeks' homes and in Greece) and this stuff was just spiced so oddly. I'm guessing perhaps it's the geographic influence or...?  We will given them another try, their menu is extensive, but I think we may try the other location.  We are hoping for the best.",

They both got the traditional Gyro plate with Hummus instead of Tzatziki.  Delicious.  I got the sampler plate off the \"Traditional\" menu.  Spanakopita, Souvlaki, and Moussaka.  Even more delicious.  Both mine and theirs were served on a bed of basmati rice, with a side of hummus & pita and a \"Greek Salad\".  Great place, very casual.  As a Greek Pagan, I found the inside done up to suggest hints of a classic greek temple, as opposed to the garish white on blue decor of most Greek places.  Can't wait to go back.  Also, try the baklava . . . it's as if Hestia herself made it.  You have to go there. . . for reals.",

The servers have always been friendly and takeout was also a good experience the one time I did that.

We were then told of all the dishes and what was in them and how they were prepeared. I had the greek trio and my lady had the pomegranate chicken. I will admit that the greek trio was good. I could tell that the food had been prepared and was reheated to be served but still had thatgood flavor. my lady's dish was great!! the pomegranate chicken was so tender and was surprisingly sweet, not overpowering but it was done very nicely! we also had the saganaki for an appetizer and it was so good! The seared cheese with the lemon and brandy was awesome. They also have happy hour where the saganaki was for $6!! This place has a very nice atmosphere, friendly and knowledgeable staff, and great food! Will be back for sure!",

The gyro and the salad were large and very tasty but the falafel was too salty for our tastes. I highly recommend this place but be prepared for the prices.

Items I have tried: 1.  Gyro - tasty, seasoned lamb, chopped romaine, tasty dill/yogurt dressing and warm flat bread 2.  Gyro salad - everything in a gyro, just minus the flat bread and it's vinegarette dressing and feta cheese. 3.  Keftedes - Greek meatballs + some fluffy basmati rice 4.  Pomegranate Chicken Salad - White meat chicken marinated in pomegranate dressing and grilled to perfection, not to dry and juicy enough with a covering of more pom dressing, and all of it placed on a bed of baby spinach leaves.   p.s.  I ordered a whole Aphrodite Cheesecake (regular cheesecake with baklava bottom) from there, and it was fantastic!  Flaky baklava bottom and fresh cheesecake - can't beat that!",

Their lunch special is awesome and it goes every day of the week which is a plus!   My favorite menu items are: Gyros: I've had the chicken, traditional and the fillet (steak). The fillet is my favorite but they were all good! Get the dill yogurt sauce!  Soup and Salad Combo: Greek salad and lentil soup. I am on a quest to figure out the recipe for this lentil soup. It is delicious. The salad takes a back seat to the soup but it has always been fresh and tasty.  Hummus: Spinach Basil and the Roasted Red Pepper. They are both fantastic! They serve it with warm, fresh pita bread and it is difficult to not want to eat it all before your meal even arrives!  Fries: These were good, but Paymon's are better. I was surprised that they did not seem as \"home made\" as the other menu items. The seasoning is alright and the dipping sauce is good. I usually just stick to ordering hummus as our appetizer though.   The only thing I have ordered and didn't care for was the falafel. And I think that was more my personal taste preference then incorrect preparation.  Desserts: Baklava cheesecake. Need I say more? The pumpkin version is wonderful as well.  Honey Walnut Cake: Super moist, not overly sweet. Kind of like a coffee cake/spice cake? We loved it.   Ya Yas Cookies: Would be great with hot tea. Kind of like a short bread cookie. If you just want something a little sweet and not overly filling, give these a try!   My family has tried other dished and loved them (stuffed bell peppers, moussaka etc) but I am sticking to what I have personally eaten and enjoyed :)  I am really pleased that they opened this location in the North end of town where I sometimes feel we are lacking quality restaurants. We go here several times a month (sometimes more!!).   If you're in the Northwest part of the valley, give them a try!",

    "text": "Yum! We went here for dinner tonight and really enjoyed it! We had the coupon from the internet for 2 free glasses of wine which is always nice!  Let me preface this with I can not spell, so please forgive me if I spell the dishes wrong!  The hummus was good, the pita bread was great and warm, not burned or dry. The consistency of the hummus was smooth, probably thanks to the yogurt it's made with.  I have the spanakopita plate (spinach pie) which I thought was very good. Great balance of phyllo dough, spinach and feta. It was nice to have the plate because it came with rice, a small greek salad (which was good - lots of feta, good salty kalamata olives and nice oil and vinegar dressing) and a taste of hummus (we had gotten an appetizer of the hummus as well...we love hummus).  My hubby had the chicken gyro and really enjoyed it. You can pick was dressing you want on the sandwich, which is nice (tsatziki, hummus or something else).  We also had a side plate of the falafel, which was really good! They were small little falafel balls, but the texture was really nice. Very smooth with a great flavor!   The service was good and quick, the place was clean and the food was good. We will definitely come back here again!",

Quality food, nice ambience, great service and good value.Although the emphasis is on Greek specialties, the mix can satisfy almost anyone, especially now that Italian food is available. If you are looking for burgers and pizza, grow up, get over it and try something different. The soups are extraordinary especially the Mushroom Pumpkin flavored with cinnamon. For desert you will find the best rice pudding along with the most delicious Baklava Cheesecake anywhere. This is an old style family enterprise and it shows. One suggestion........go there hungry.......trust me.",

I moved to Colorado for 3 months and got back in December, and  since I have been back i have eaten there 5 times. The  past 3 times I have been there I have been very disappointed with the service. It seems as if the owners  hired people who don't give a shit and tonight was the final straw for me..I'm 23 years old  and I felt as if I was being put into a corner with a bunch of younger kids  because of my age.  However I always tip 20% or more because i have worked  for  tips my  whole life, so I  was upset to be discriminated against. We were waiting for our drinks to be taken for ten minutes..never even talked to a waiter so I took off.. Also last time I ordered pick up a young girl working the register completely charged someone else for my  meal and vice versa (and  she didn't even notice until it was pointed out to her). The manager came out and it was a  fifteen minute ordeal. Owners need to check their staff.. Food is always delicious but the staff makes it not worth my time..not going back for a while.",

I ordered the gyros platter as did the rest of the family.  The pita bread was rubbery and plastic.  The contents had absolutely no flavor and had no sauce inside.  I have had gyros before and they have all been tasty and oozing with sauce.  I usually eat anything, but this I did not eat, it was cold.  Took the meat contents out and gave to the dogs when we got home.  Rice was cooked to perfection but  was bland and tasteless.  Salad was good though.  Service was friendly and quick, but that was because there was only a few people there, which is unusual for a Friday.",

Oh and did I mention the food was all kinds of heaven?! I had the Greek Trio entree.....it was beyond perfection. A sampler plate of moussaka, spanakopita and pastitso on a bed of fragrant basmati rice with salad, pita and humus. It's a good sized meal and I near stuffed myself! The hubby had a wrap which he said was ok, not enough meat. He 'helped' me with my trio ;) Our 5yr old had the pomegranate chicken with rice which he polished off with some butter. For dessert the hubby had canoli which was ok and I had the baklava cheesecake which was also ok. The owner Joe stopped by our table to say hello which was nice. Grandmother is the hostess.....very charming. Phillip from Texas was our server and he was super friendly. Only downside it's about 20 miles from homebut that's not gonna keep us away!

I have to admit that I am a dimwit when it comes to Greek food. I can't tell the difference between what is authentic and what is commercialized. I do, however, know good food, and Market Grille fits the bill.  My husband ordered the Pomegranate Chicken Gyro and I got the Traditional Gyro. We both liked the Pomegranate Chicken one better but both meats were tender and delicious. The pita bread was warm and toasty.  I wish I had ordered more food to try. I would like to try the Gyro Pizza or some other authentic Greek items that I cannot pronounce.   The restaurant is huge and looks like a good place for large gatherings. There is a nice patio area where you can dine. The service was quick, friendly and efficient.  If anything, definitely go here for the Pumpkin Baklava Cheesecake!",

    "text": "AMAZING BEYOND WORDS.... I will admit that it has taken me longer than it should have to eat at the Market Grille Cafe, and I am sorry it took so long.  Describing the food as incredible just does not do it enough justice.  There are very few places that I have eaten at over my 40+ years that serve food that has so much depth of flavor.    I started with the pumpkin mushroom soup and honestly, I could have just eaten that all day long.  Quite possibly the best soup I have ever had.  I then moved into the entree where I had the pomogranate chicken and it about knocked me out of my chair.  The chicken was so tender, moist and the flavor was intoxicating.  I honestly could have eaten like 10 chicken breasts cooked this way.  Wow, what an amazing treat.  Then to finish off the experience I had the baklava cheesecake.  I was told that this dessert won an award at a food competition and I do not doubt it at all.  It was as lucious as it gets.  What an amazing way to finish.  The experience was basically a food orgasm.    The Market Grille Cafe is a family owned business with two locations in town and the service and hospitality of ALL of the people that work there is just as impressive as the food.  The MGC has it all, atmosphere, hospitality, and most importantly incredible food.  If that was not enough the prices for the food are as economically friendly as it can be.  The MGC is very wallet friendly.  I do not know how they do it for so little but they do. I spend just as much or more for fast food and do not get anything close to this in quality.    I am a huge Gyro fan so my next visit I am definitely going to try one.  I saw someone else having one and asked how it was and they said it was outstanding and the best they ever had.  I cannot say I am surprised.    I urge all of my Yelpers out there to visit the Market Grille Cafe and enjoy the same amazing experience I had.    Run, don't walk and get yourself into the Market Grille Cafe.",

I like how they provide the option of having either the traditional shaved meat or grilled meat. For my gyro I chose the shaved meat. The lamb was fine, but I thought it was under seasoned. On a future visit, I'd probably just stick with the traditional gyro consisting of both lamb and beef.   Greek Trio Platter ($12.95): This was my boyfriend's order. The platter came with samplers of  Spanakopita, Mousaka, and Pastitsio. Plus, it came with rice, Greek salad, and slices of pita bread and hummus. The Spanakopita was the best with its flaky filo pastry and spinach and feta cheese layers. Our least favorite out of the three was the Pastitsio with its cinnamon and beef and tomato sauce combination. The Mousaka was just OK.   The service was good. Our server was upbeat and knowledgeable about the menu, and she was enthusiastic about sharing her favorites and offering her suggestions.  Even though the food was OK, I'd visit again. They do have some menu items that sound tasty and interesting that I'd like to try, like the Pomegranate Chicken Spinach Salad, Pumpkin-Mushroom Soup, and their Pumpkin Baklava Cheesecake.",

We went in on a Saturday evening. The service was HORRIBLE! It's the absolute worse service I've ever had in a restaurant. They sat us down, server didn't get to our table until about 10 min after. Ordered our drinks and it took another 10 min to bring me a water my boyfriend ordered a chi tea and after another 5 min they told him the machine was broken. Okay it's fine we get it so we let it slide. Fast forward to an hour later still haven't gotten our food. I'm hangry at this point. No salad, no soup no acknowledgement from the server. Finally I said something and she brought us our lentil soup, still no side salad. Long story short we ended up getting our salad after we got our gyro. We are big on service so no I will never return. I will drive an extra 10 miles to the other location because we do love the food. 2 stars only because the food is amazing.",

Growing up with homemade moussaka, pastitsio, pomegranate chicken, pita, hummus, spanakopita, dolmades & kourabiedes, etc etc etc means that I'm well versed in Greek & Mediterranean cooking. I can cook everything on this menu, but sometimes I don't have 3 hours to devote to prepping and making giant moussaka. Sometimes I just want to get Greek food (that isn't a Kronos gyro) instead of making it myself.   I've been to this MGC a handful of times, including once with my sister and once with Brian P.  The prices are steep for the portions provided. The sampler platter is quite small for the price. They have a happy hour, but I have not been to it here.   Meals are pita & pilaf heavy, which makes me wonder why the entrees are so steep. The pomegranate chicken is dry and flavorless. The saganaki isn't remotely tangy.  Service is slow, even when the place is nearly empty. Maybe it's because the servers are teens or because they want to draw out the meals. I don't know, but after my last visit with my sister, we agreed that there was no point in a return visit.",

They have a separate take-out entrance on the side of the building. As with the sit-down restaurant, the staff was wonderful. Very friendly, helpful & patient.   The falafel is seriously the best I have ever had. Better than anything I had in Greece! I actually regret trying this because now no other falafel will compare. I stopped at the Mad Greek on the way back to Vegas and just as I suspected...not nearly as good. And it's normally not bad!   We had a large order (there were 8 of us) and they checked each bag in front of us to ensure we got all the correct food. We got several orders of: Falafel - Absolutely delicious.  Hummus trio - Great.  Satziki - Very nice.  Fried Cheese - It's not called that but that's what it was. I didn't care for it but almost everyone else did.

We always substitute the grape leaves and falafel (we don't care for them) with a little more Greek salad (that it already comes with) and fries.   It's never been an issue. Until today! The manager was SO rude to me. He argued with me, explained it was too costly to substitute. He talked over me, raised his voice, and completely made me never want to return here ever again. Apparently us taking some more Lettuce and fries instead of falafel and grape leaves is too expensive for them and this is more important than customer service. We will not return. The level of unprofessionalism is unacceptable and that man should be fired.",

Needless to say, they were on my \"must haves\" while back in town visiting my daughter.    I ordered their lunch special chicken and veggie skewer, and a full order of dolmades to start.  After getting my fill of their luscious meat and rice blend delicately wrapped in tender grape leaves, I no longer had room for my lunch, so a doggie bag was in order.  Wish they shipped these bad boys across country, because I'd be a regular customer!  After living here in Vegas for over 46 years, it's difficult to get used to living in a new town with a lack of culinary diversity (San Antonio).  I guess I need to come back more often!",

There were only ~12 tables (3 of which were having checks dropped) with 5 employees walking around in the front.

So reluctantly I give it 2 stars.   My fellow Yelping friends, when the food is weird, it doesn't mean it is authentic, it means it is just weird. We ordered pasta and a platter of gyro, the pasta sauce was super sour and rice was pathetic. The yogurt sauce was runnier than water. I can go on and on and complain about the quality and taste of the food. Hopefully the readers get the idea.  I will not come back to this restaurant ever again. Twice is more than enough.

Although the saganaki was good and the staff was friendly, the entrees were terrible. The gyro and the stuffed pepper (which by the way the menu said 2 and it's just 1 cut in half...) were so bland and soggy. Also why does a rice stuffed pepper come with a side of rice? Makes no sense. It was $14 for basically a whole plate of rice and 1 pepper that sucked.",

At first the server \"Linda\" wished to sit the two of us at a table instead of possibly asking what we would prefer. I believe that most customers would ask for a booth. So after she takes us to the table. I ask for a booth which she is apologetic and takes us to the other side of this quaint little restaurant.  After some time I order a glass of Lucio and waters for the two of us. Our orders were pretty simple. Eggplant Parmesan entree and a Spaghetti and Meatballs. Salad was not so spectacular that came with the entree. But when the main courses were brought to the table. I was very surprised that the pita bread was just that, nothing special and lets not forget the frozen butter packets which got me laughing. My eggplant looked burnt and overcooked. I've been in the military and thought I was back in Somalia for a bit. Lol. After I had tasted it and the spaghetti side that was on there I had pushed it aside. Dry spaghetti and burned eggplant parmesan. The other order was okay and that is only because she had requested additional meat sauce for the meal.  Lastly after I had completed the wine, Linda asked if we needed two boxes and I thought not but my guest did take the rest of her plate with her. I handed my bank card to her and she went to the back to run my card. Upon her return she handed us the bill and after I was finished discussing some things with my guest, I opened my receipt/bill folder. The bill was there, yet my bank card was not. So I am now a little irritated since my cards cannot be replaced unless I visit a branch in Hawaii for a replacement. So as I am waiting for her to return while she stands to the rear of the restaurant. A coworker is walking past the bar about 5 minutes later and stops. He bends down and reaches for a card on the floor and low and behold its mine! While he is looking at it and is now looking around he walks up to the table he is serving and I stop him to confirm this. Yes it is and he hands it to me.   No tip and no business from me. I as a customer expect service! I pay for this service and I tip 20% for excellent service no matter what. Linda got a few words written on her bill from me since she definitely does not display or emulate this mindset of what this is. I will not be back. Good luck to those who like this place because it is not anything but a sad excuse of a place to waste your time. You can do better at McDonalds.",

First the staff, a family owned and operated business, they do a great job in ensuring you are taking good care of. I feel that once the team gets to know you, they basically know what your regulars are and will ask \"your regular\"? The team is always checking on you and ensuring small things like ensuring you drink glass is never empty, asking if your food is prepared correctly all while able to have conversations.   The food is always great. We have had several different dishes from pasta, steak and chicken and have never been disappointed. Food is prepared fresh and is always brought out hot. I feel the prices for the food are good and honestly we are always bring home leftovers. I would recommend the Gyros, they are awesome and remind me of my trip to Santorini.   The store recently went thru a renovation, and thou I miss the pictures of Santorini (Sorry Joe), they  did a great job updating the restaurant giving it a warm inviting feeling . What I think is unique is they have videos playing of highlights of the activities the restaurant is involved with.   If you on the fence about trying, I would highly recommend this local gem.",

The pomegranate chicken is a must-have if you've never eaten here before. Also love the mama mia's chicken, any of the skewers, the stuffed peppers... anything, really.

All were really quite good.  My only quibble was that the hummus wasn't quite as thick as I'm used too and the babganoush was a little thicker, but both tasted good, which is what really counts.  They warm pita triangles were quite nice though.  Our takeout look a bit longer than planned as well (they said 10 min and it was closer to 20), but I'm willing to wait for good food, and this was really good food.  We'll definitely be back to this place in the future.",

    "text": "This food helps me so much with my new Mediterranean kick. They fill the holes where needed.   I am a plain jane, plain and simple kind of guy. So I will begin saying that their lunch specials ROCK! A Chicken Gyro or the Pomegranate Chicken salad is not only considered a healthy lunch but a tasty lunch as well. There are a couple items as well that are under their lunch specials and they're only 7.50.   Aside from the lunch specials there is a HUGE selection of Mediterranean favorites to choose from which I have yet to begin to explore but will because I am already sold on their food, product, atmosphere and service.  If I had an award for Champion of Local Small Business, Market Grille Cafe would be it. In both restaurants you will find televisions playing video of the Market Grille family and it really makes you respect the place for being a family business. In Las Vegas, a family business and even a restaurant being a family business is a hard thing to come by because barely any succeed. I remember as a teen eating at their first location off of Tropical Parkway and Centennial. They expanded and opened up a second location off of Lake Mead and Rock Springs. Next thing I know they relocated their original store to an old abandoned Chili's building off of Durango between Elkhorn and Deer Springs. I really hope these guys are doing good and hope they're having resulted success with business volume.  The only thing I could recommend to these guys is keeping everything the same. Distinguishing between both locations they do a very good job at that. However, the Centennial restaurant offers table service. There are servers, they serve on you and I would consider it a casual style dining. At the Lake Mead restaurant, you fill up your own drinks, pick your own table and the only thing delivered to you is your food and your silverware. BOTH ARE FINE, I AM IN THE INDUSTRY AND TIP REGARDLESS! But I think it would be more successful for Market Grille to pick a method of service and stick to it as opposed to it being differentiated between both restaurants. There are penny pinchers that could be scared away from this location because they are accustomed to the style of service they receive at the Lake Mead and Rock Springs location.  They're friendly, the product is fresh and some could see it as a little pricy. Deal with it, because you get what you pay for. The service is awesome, the food is consistent and their PUMPKIN BAKLAVA CHEESECAKE is amazing.   Keep strong Market Grille, I'll see you soon!",

Last week, she went there and ordered a meal that included dessert for take out.  She didn't like the dessert and went back the next day and approached a server that helped her several times previously.  The server refused to take back the dessert and told my wife that if she wanted to get something else, there would be another charge!! On top of things, my wife had just placed another order for more food prior to bringing this dessert situation to their attention!  My wife swiftly told the server to cancel her order and said walked out.  We are talking about a $7.00 dessert that virtually costs the restaurant nothing.  Even if it costs $20, the restaurant, should have acknowledged the fact that my wife didn't like it, apologize, and offered a refund or an exchange since we are frequent customers.  We will definitely not be returning as a result.",

The Greek music playing in the background and occasional cries of \"Opa\" by the staff make the dining experience feel more authentic.    My personal favorites thus far are the platos potatoes,  $4.25, which are served with a taziki sauce and garnished with feta cheese and seasonings, and the stuffed tomato entree dish for $11.75.  The stuffed tomatoes are packed with flavor and have some serious weight to them. I was only able to finish one! The tomatoes are served with a small salad,  rice, and pita bread with hummus.    Our server was super friendly and the wait time for our food was reasonably short. On this particular visit we happened to have a Groupon,  so we got a delicious meal for about $25 after everything.  Groupon or not, we'll be back!",

The tables have beautiful large photos of the Greek coastline, and I love the grill in the center of the room.  The menu has your standard Greek fare. Most items can be ordered a la carte, which comes with just rice, or as an entree, which then comes with rice, salad, hummus, and pita. If you have a smaller (ie, normal) sized appetite, the a la carte will be just fine. Dad and his gf enjoyed the lamb kabob and mousaka, and bf and I shared a gyro wrap and a lamb gyro. Wish the gyros had a bit more tzatziki but the flavor was good and the meats very tender.  Service was quick and friendly. It was a packed house on a Sat night and we got our food really fast.  The patio looks really cute too but it was close to 20 degrees tonight, so maybe next time!",

Lady on the phone had to check the actual vegetarian/vegan-ness of every option- kinda frustrating when I am used to \"Mediterranean/Greek\" style food always having tons of options for me. Usually I can just ask for no yogurt or no cheese. I appreciated the honesty & the helpfulness, because I genuinely have dairy allergies & don't want to risk it.  We decided not to order, because we were hungry & needed a substantial meal (not just appetizers).  That said, I think it is a really, really, REALLY bad decision to add feta cheese to your falafel, because I know a lot of us vegans go for it on a pita on the weekly & I doubt your omnivores would genuinely miss it. It's not usually used, in my experience.  Why reduce your clientele over something that is usually \"accidentally\" vegan?",

    "text": "It was a cloudy day and I needed spaghetti.  Of course it could have been sunny and I would've wanted spaghetti but I digress.  There are times when even on vacation you want some comfort food and for me that's spaghetti.  I've had my fair share of it at a ton of places.  I like to compare.  Usually the taste, the type of sauce, taste of the sauce, is there even enough sauce? You know the basics.  Also if they have them with meatballs, sausage or meat sauce.  With me the type of meat is usually the only thing that differs.   I proceeded to get the spaghetti with meatballs.  Time for some comfort!! Now this is a Mediterranean place so there is also a lot of Greek food which I'm sure is also delicious! Anywho when the waitress brought my plate I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't a huge dish. Because as much as I love spaghetti sometimes you just get full.  My plate also came with pieces of pita bread which were awesome! Only downside was that there wasn't enough sauce. I usually like a lot of sauce but it tasted great so not really a downside. The meatballs were small and just a bit dry but it was a mix of beef, veil and another meat I can't remember.  But they were also delicious.   All in all I was happy with their spaghetti!! I also decided to have the rice pudding!! Omg it was delicious!! It was smooth and creamy with cinnamon on top, which I'm not a fan of cinnamon but it paired so well with the rice pudding.  Like I have said before the best way to eat is like a local!!",

I chose the Lamb Roast Cabernet and really the best lamb (pulled for that matter) I've ever tasted in my life.  Reasonably priced and their atmosphere with live music is just made my evening.  Strong tips to the musician and MGC as it was a good introduction to how Vegas suburbs is so mellow. Definitely coming back to check out the rest of the menu since they're only 5 minutes away from my new home.   MGC.  Did I say MGC just beat out the Persian way of cooking lamb.  Well, I did now.",

BUT, it has been three times now and I've asked for no onions in my wrap and they put onions in my wrap!  The first time, the OWNER told me I must have mistaken them for the red cabbage.  I am 1000% confident I did not mistake them (I think I can tell when my throat starts to feel tingly).  Plus, I frequently use red cabbage in my own cooking.  The owner still made us pay for the meal.    The most recent time was a take-out order.  I must have said 10 or 20 times \"no raw onions\" in either of the two orders, and asked several, \"are you sure there are no raw onions?\" before I left.  As soon as I got home, I took a giant bite and behold- there were onions in both orders.    Further.  Before you leave the take-out area, they quickly open the box to make sure the order is correct.  The server who opened the box saw that one of the wraps looked like it had fallen on the ground and was no longer a wrap.  Yet, he closed the box again as if I was going to take it.  They also forgot multiple things on my order and I ended up waiting even longer for the order to be refilled (45 minutes).",

However, my Pomegranate Chicken (supposedly award winning, but the obnoxious waitress could not tell me what award was won), was a big disappointment. A tiny piece of dry chicken was barely saved by not-enough pomegranate sauce. The award winning (again, no specifics) cheesecake was not to my liking at all.  I definitely plan on going back to see if Market Cafe can earn another star with a different entree, as I enjoyed our visit and I like to support the locals.",

My sister and I decided to try this place on a whim and we were very pleased at the decor and ambiance of the place as soon as we walked in. We were also pleasantly surprised to see a live singer/guitarist on the stage singing a mixture of cover songs. Now for the good stuff, the food! I ordered an appetizer the stuffed grape leaves vegetarian style and the spanikopita entree, it comes with hummus/pita bread, Greek rice and a side salad. The grape leaves were not only delicious but HUGE! I was pleasantly surprised by this. Seeing as the appetizer was so huge I expected my spanikopita to be a good side. However I was disappointed it not only was smaller than expected but I have had better.....I got a corner piece and the sides were a little over done. Still however the rice was good very flavorful and the hummus was your basic hummus. My sister got the eggplant parmesan and a side of fries. Her eggplant parmesan was very dissapointing....it was good I guess but the two slices you got we're a joke. I believe it was suppose to be served on a bed of pasta which my sister did not want so maybe that's why they are so little. The fries were amazing! They were crispy on the outside but not over cooked very very good. I'd go back just for those. Also she got the rosemary pita bread and it was fantastic!!! I'm shocked they even serve the plain!  Lastly we both got the baklava cheesecake, and it was NOT my style! I am a tradition cheesecake girl and the flavors too me just did not go. Will not get that again! But the other desserts looks really good. All in all I would recommend this spot and I'm curious to try the other things on the menu. We will be back!",

The place was really nice, the decor was nice and the workers were great.  So food wise, I ended picking a Mediterranean wrap with Pomegranate chicken (which was highly recommended by my parents) and I will say this, it was great dish. It had pomegranate chicken of course, red onions, lettuce, tomato, and hummus. With a side Greek salad.  Both of the dishes were great but the only downside were the tomatoes. The tomatoes we diced and all but they were big. It was to the point where I had to pick them off because they were so big. So another thing with the wrap was the hummus. There was so much hummus in the wrap and it was to the point where I just really couldn't eat it anymore. Almost every bite a took I just got a big mesh of hummus. Maybe is the spread it more and add a little less. But overall it was a great dish. Definitely would come back again and get something else",

I decided to grab dinner tonight so he could try it and was extremely disappointed. My chicken skewer was dry and burnt, leaving a terrible after taste. His steak skewer was also overcooked and lacked flavor. He actually asked if it was supposed to come with a dipping sauce because it was so dry. The veggie skewers and salad were however tasty. Ultimately I ended up throwing out an entire chicken skewer (I ordered an extra one) and giving my dogs the remainder of mine. My husband's meal is sitting on the counter and we are headed out to grab a burger. Disappointed I wasted $35.",

    "text": "I am always looking for a good Mediterranean restaurant where the meat actually looks like it came from an animal because I have had a few experiences that were iffy. Market grille cafe delivers. They have a lot of authentic Greek dishes and a good amount of choices on the menu.   The Service: I sat and waited a few minutes while waiters and waitresses walked by before someone finally came and talked to me. I'm not really sure who my actual waiter/waitress was because I had 3 or 4 different people. One brought me water, another took my order, a different one brought my food and another brought me my check which threw me off a bit.  The Food: The steak skewer is supposed to be cooked medium BUT definitely came out medium well/ well done which isn't my favorite. Fortunately it was well seasoned and not too dry so I didn't complain (I hate being that person). The veggie skewer is once again well seasoned and the rice was too. The Greek salad was good, not too much dressing but also not underdressed. Overall, a good experience and the atmosphere is nice. They also have live music sometimes which I saw written on a board in there so if you're into that or just need a Mediterranean fix then this is a good place to give a chance.   Updated to 4 stars. I went again and the service was much better, my food was also cooked correctly and nice and juicy. I also sat outside this time and it is a really cute little area. Nice if you would like to enjoy the weather but also shaded a bit so you aren't directly in the sunlight. No complaints and will go again for lunch since it is right by my job!",

After visiting the shooting complex, my husband and I decided to go have some lunch, being from Henderson, we didn't know the area too well so we looked on Yelp and found this place, it did not disappoint!!  We started off with the Lemon Cilantro Hummus which is served with Pita Bread and it's a very good shareable portion. My husband and I like to order 2 different plates and share them. We decided on the Pomegranate Chicken and the Vasilios Platter, no regrets at all!!  The Pomegranate Chicken, TO DIE FOR!!! The chicken is juicy and tender. It's marinated with pomegranate juice and grilled to perfection!! It's topped with a pomegranate glaze and served with chopped Walnuts. I ordered the entree so it came with Basmati rice, a side salad and some hummus.  The Vasilios Platter is served with lamb-beef (gyro meet) we couldn't get enough!!! All my husband and I talked about was how good the food was and what a great find this place was!!   Confession... in a time frame if a week and a half... my husband and I have made the drive to come eat here, 3 times already! That should tell you how fantastic this place is!!!   We finally saved some room for dessert, I have no words to describe how amazing the Pumpkin Cheesecake was. This place just gets better every time we come!!!   I'll be bringing my family and in-laws here when they come visit. This place should not be missed!!!",

    "text": "We actually have been coming to Market Grille Cafe since 2008 when it was at the previous location off of Tropical Parkway.  The food is always outstanding and the staff are really friendly.  It has a family atmosphere and we love bringing our children here.  The menu is really extensive and in the Fall time frame (Oct normally) they block off a portion of the parking lot for a festival where you can bring your kids.  Whether dining-in or take-out, the food is the same and delicious.  I have a picky family so it is difficult to find a good restaurant where they really enjoy the food.  This location hits their taste buds out of the park.    We've had their Chicken Skewer, Gyro with yogurt dill sauce, Pomegranate Chicken, salad, basmati rice, Tiramisu Cheesecake, and World's Best Dessert from their menu.  All are awesome and comes out just at the right temperature which means just above room temperature.  When we walk-in, we are immediately seated and our waitress is at our table in less then 15 seconds with the menu and ready to take our drink orders.  From the time we walk-in, seated, and leave, it is all within an hour.    For those who have a taste bud for some Mediterranean dishes at a very good price, this is the place for you.  It is located in the parking lot as a standalone building in a very large shopping mall with Smiths, TJ Max,  Dollar General, etc.",

I ordered the hummus, baba ganoush, falafel, tabouleh, salad, dolmas and pita platter.   . Everything was 5 stars.  The real standout to me was the dolmas.  I got the vegan version.  The filling was just perfect!  The rice was light and fluffy and I could taste the fresh spices coming through.  There was even pine nuts in there!  The grape leaves were big and they weren't smothered in oil like a lot of others I have had. . The entire meal was DELICIOUS!  This review just made my mouth water.  I will go back for lunch tomorrow!",

The pomegranate chicken was very flavorful and the fries were really good. My Gyro was good except, the pita bread always gets soggy. I recommend maybe ordering it on the side somehow & assembling it yourself. Because, every time I order it, it's always soggy.   For dessert, we decided to try the Tiramisu cheesecake. And we didn't like it that much. It didn't taste anything like Tiramisu. When I told this to the waitress... instead of apologizing she just made excuses which kind of made it worse. Although, she wasn't a bad waitress, she just wasn't that great. This service is just OK here.   Overall, this place is nice, nicely decorated with pretty good food, it's a pretty nice place.",

    "text": "The ONLY reason I'm giving three stars is because the food isn't bad. As far as I am concerned, however, the food is not good enough to warrant a return visit. There are many other places to get good Mediterranean food in Las Vegas. The service here is an absolute tragedy. At first, I felt like a burden to my server who was busy chatting with other employees. When I finally was able to capture the attention of my server, he seemed to be concerned that I wasn't going to eat enough to warrant his attention. My daughter and I were in a hurry that night and wanted appetizers and specialty coffee and cocktails. We ordered our hummus, pita, baba ghanouj, tabouli, and of course, spanakopita for dessert. I had a glass of wine, and my daughter a specialty coffee. Our bill was overwhelmingly expensive for decent food and judgmental, aloof, inefficient, and mediocre service at best. This restaurant seems to have a narcissistic personality disorder or some form of egomania in terms of their pricing structure. Prepare to feel like you could be eating the same for a few bucks from a Styrofoam plate at a street fair, but being charged prices more as though you were in a white linen tablecloth restaurant. The experience that I am referring to in this review is my second bad experience with this restaurant. I won't waste anymore of my time tonight to describe the absolutely insulting experience that I had here on my birthday. In summary: The Market Cafe offers extremely an inflated pricing structure for less than lackluster service with decent food. Bring your credit card, as that's what seems to really matter here.",

If you think this is expensive then stay away from Paymon's (A single gyro, no platter was over 10 dollars)  I had Gyros platter, the gyro was Nice sized and the meat was cut off the vertical spit (not frozen gyros \"patties\"). the platter includes a nice sized Greek salad with tangy homemade Greek dressing and some seasoned rice and humus and pita ( I liked the humus with yogurt, then it's not the consistency of kindergarten paste).  This pita bread is about as good as you get in Las Vegas.   My resident grape leaf tester (my wife, who orders them wherever she can) got the vegetarian variety and enjoyed them very much along with her Moussaka which was rich and not greasy.  I will be adding this place to our visit often list based on the good food, and service and value.",

I rather go to Gyro Time or Greek Cafe on the strip. I won't be coming back to this place. Also I think they spelled  tzatziki sauce wrong on their menu but I could be wrong so whatever.

On a whim we walked in for lunch, only to find ourselves happy and giddy at the range of choices on their menu.  Not only do they serve wine and beer, but they have different Greek fare than the other restaurants, such as pumpkin mushroom soup, freshly made (not canned) dolmades, and pomegranate chicken for gyros and as a skewer.  We ordered the traditional gyro, hummus and baba with pita, as well as a chicken skewer, pumpkin mushroom soup, dolmades and their butter cookies.  All of it was excellent and nicely priced.  I have to say that their food is better than my previous favorite Greek restaurant, hands down.  If you're looking for take out or a nice place to sit and eat, stop by your nearest Market Grille Cafe and have a gyro.  I have to suggest the pumpkin soup because it was out of this world.  And if you are in the mood for interesting dessert, please have their butter cookies or their cheesecake.   Excellent food at excellent prices.",

    "text": "We have wanted to try this restaurant for some time and decided to go when we had some family in town.  I used the address on THEIR website and could not find the restaurant.  After driving around looking for 15 minutes I called the restaurant and they gave me directions to the new location on Durango.  We arrived to find a somewhat confusing ordering system with no instruction and no one to help us.  Luckily one of the other patrons helped us.  We ordered food for four and it came to just over $60.  Little overpriced, but I was hoping it would be worth it.  The young girl that was our server couldn't have worked there more than a day or two and it showed.  She brought the falafel that we ordered and we all dug in.  Each of us took one bite and shared a look or horror as we tried to decide if we could swallow this bite.  No one went back for a second bite and we all hoped our entree would make up for this disgrace.  We then recieved our entrees and began to eat.  My wife had what I can only call \"the worst soup ever made\". It became a dare at the table to even try it.  My father and I had the Gyro plate.  The gyro was on par with banquet food, but the rice was overcooked and completely dried out.  The hummus tasted like it was made with cheap pungent olive oil and completely inedible. All of our salads were way overdressed with bland dressing.  Needless to say, we didn't hardly touch our food.  The waitress came and asked us how we were doing and we told her to take the plates. In any decent restaurant, a table that doesn't eat their food and returns it all uneaten would be asked what was wrong and likely be visited by a manager.  We had no such  courtesy.  I can't really find one good thing to say about this restaurant.",

I order for pick up frequently and I always have to go above and beyond to make sure they get my order right. I always ask for chopped olives in my gyro. At one point, they had forgotten the olives and I called the manager to complain, the manager replied that I should've checked my food before I left. I said I did check my food, its hard to see the olives because they usually put them under the meat, so I asked the cashier if the olives were in there, and she said yes. Then he told me, well if you still weren't sure, you shouldve called for a manager. Seriously?? So I have to check my food, ask the cashier if she took the order down right, AND call for a manager, all just to make sure that the order is done right which is THEIR job in the first place.   Yesterday, I ordered for pick up the exact same way I usually do, but this time they put the olives on the side and they weren't chopped. So I asked the lady if they could put it in the gyro, chopped. She then told me that I didn't specify to have it on the gyro. I told her, I always come here and I never usually have to say that, they usually have it in the gyro. She then said, well you can't expect us to memorize your order.   Hmm..if I get pizza at Pizza Hut and I say, can you add sausage, they don't usually put in on the side. If I go to Burger King, and I said add onions in my burger, they don't usually put it on the side. At the very least, if they weren't sure, they would ask \"do you want it on the side\" before they do. They don't have to memorize my order for that.   Bottom line, don't order pick up from here. And if they mess up your order, expect them to get a really defensive attitude about it before they fix it. Whatever happened to good customer service? Its nice to see a family owned business do well, but most family owned businesses have better customer service than they do. Whether it's poor training on the cash registers or poor customer service training, I doubt they will ever fix the problem, because they always seem to blame it on the customer than look at what's wrong with their service model.",

He was quick to offer us a gluten-free/vegan/veggie menu, as I said I couldn't ingest dairy.  During our meal, he came by and asked if we were happy with everything (we were).  I ended up ordering the lentil soup and the Plato's Potatoes (i.e., fries topped with a secret spice blend).  The soup was delicious, but the fries were so-so (I thought the accompanying yogurt dip was too yogurt-y and the fries on their own were surprisingly bland).  I also ordered a few of the butter cookies, which proved to be a good decision.  Lovely, shortbread-like cookies dusted with confectioner's sugar.  The place is clean and bright and is great for a casual meal with friends.  You make your order at the counter, pay, take a number, find a seat, then wait for your meal to be brought to you.  It's like a very upscale cafeteria!  I'm happy that there is a unique place like MGC in the north part of town.",

    "text": "Ok then.  I reviewed many of the other reviews and thought I was in for a treat.  What a disappointment.  I have eaten here before, when the restaurant was in a corner off of centennial parkway. I didn't think it was that good then either, but I thought I would give it another try,  I ordered the traditiomal gyro platter.  It came with rice, salad, pita slices and dipping sauce, and a gyro pita sandwich.  I tried the rice first.  It was bland and dry.  The salad was good, at least the lettuce was fresh.  They gave me some little slices of pita bread and a little bit of dipping sauce.  Once again, bland. Then I tried the gyro.  It looked great.  Now I have eaten quite a few gyro sandwiches from different restaurants and am usually satisfied with the taste.  The meat (lamb in my case) is what makes the sandwich.  Oh my gosh what a surprise.  The meat barely had any flavor at all!  Additionally,  it didn't look like it was completely cooked and was very light colored.  It was so bland I didn't even eat half of the gyro.  Very disappointed.  I'll give you that the place is nicely decorated and the service staff was good, but the food just didn't cut it.  Prices could be better too, but they weren't that bad.  Won't be going back here, not while Paymons and my favorite, Yassou Grill on charleston/buffalo are still open.  The food at those two is much better than here.",

The server showed the part of menu where happy hour prices dishes are listed and at the same time she mentions that some of them are not in  happy hour menu / prices.  When I enquired which one's are  and which one's arent, she was not clear. I once asked her to point out, which dishes are in happy - prices and which are not, the server was very vague and did not clearly provide an answer and slid through it. That made me wonder if this was deliberate and sales tactics.  If Market Grill is sincere, they must print another menu with dishes qualifying for happy hour prices.   The falafel was tasty and properly cooked. I have been at this place for lunch and dinner. I have noticed, portions have become smaller and service poorer in the past two years.   Telephonic information provision is inadequate and short.  The two women I have spoken with in the past two months sound irritated and want to cut conversion as short as possible  Sorry, I thought Market Grill knew better, disappointed.",

    "text": "There's only one way they can afford a nice new building, and that's ripping people off!   My boyfriend called in a lunch order for him and myself a couple months ago. We decided to get the lunch portions for $8.95-ish each with an extra skewer of meat each. So 2 lunch portions for $8.95 each and 2 extra skewers @ $5.95-ish= roughly $29.80 (whatever tax and tip was), right? Nope! The manager, I think her name was Rose or Rosa, went to charge my boyfriend for 4 separate regular size meals at a total of about $60.00! He tried to correct by telling her what we wanted and she just didn't understand and said that this is what we ordered and that we need to pay for it. When my boyfriend said he didn't want to pay $60 for lunch she told him \"you have more money\"! Seriously terrible service! So he just got one lunch and we had to split it. We'll never give them our business again!   But it doesn't end there! Yesterday, my boyfriend was at work when two of his co-workers said they were going to Market Grill for lunch (btw, this place gets tons of business from the guys at his work. Infact, his company actually bought lunch for 30+ guys from Market Grill a few times in the past). My boyfriend declined because of what happened before. Sure enough, his coworker comes back perplexed about his bill of $37 for two $8.95 lunches with nothing extra (they confirmed the lunch price on the phone with the person who took their order). His coworker called Market Grill said he would like to speak to a manager about his ridiculous bill, only to be put on hold and no one picked back up.   Their new location is only a block away from my house and I still won't go! It might be tasty food, but sure isn't worth the bouncing prices, hassle and terrible customer service from the managers.",

Their traditional lamb and beef gyro is tasty. No surprises just simple and delicious. If you like soup get the avgolemono soup, it is creamy and refreshing, the combination of lemon, chicken, and rice is perfect. The baklava cheesecake is very decadent, a layer of cheesecake with a baklava crust, the best of both worlds. The only reason I'm not giving a five star is because of the to go wait time being a little too long sometimes.",

You get:  1 kabob jam packed with marinated chicken, 1 kabob of marinated mixed vegetables, a huge side of rice pilaf, a heaping of greek salad, and hummus and pita chips.  Talk about bang for your buck!    The original lamb gyro is my second favorite thing to order here.  Market Grille now has a waitstaff, which I am kind of disappointed in.  I felt the old system of ordering at the register, taking a number, and getting your own drink worked just fine.    Their customer service is superb, everyone is always very friendly and attentive.    Tip:  Occasional 15% off coupons for Market Grill inside of the Review Journal.",

    "text": "I try to be generous when it comes to \"family owned\" businesses, but this one needs a wake-up call before it goes out of business for lack of business.   I could not wait for the place to open this past October. You can smell what seems to be yummy-ness in the air outside the restaurant and inside. I haven't had the occasion to dine in there but I decided I'd order take-out tonight (Fri 1/6/12) to give it a try. Man was I disappointed.  First, some reviewers have written \"a little pricy\", I have to say IT IS VERY OVERPRICED. I mean, you'd expect to pay too much on the strip (still for a decent portion) but this is a neighborhood spot across from a grocery store. 12 bucks for 1 skimpy meat skewer, 1 \"vegetable\" skewer of sliced tomato & onions, about 1.5 tablespoons of dill sauce, chencey chopped salad with a thimble-full of dressing, and 1/2 of a pita, cut into fourths so that it gives the appearance of more. I mean for $12 you could at least give a whole pita; it's cheap bread. This had to be the skimpiest meal I've had in a long time. I was really hungry and I don't eat a lot of food. But I was still hungry when I finished. I think there might have been enough food for my 3 year old nephew. But any restauranteur should know that if you load up the plate with cheap sides (rice, salad, bread). You've at least given the appearance of a generous portion.  .... but let me continue.   Second, the quality was really bad. There was a big wad of moistened seasoning mix in my rice that I bit into - yuk! Yet, the rice was dry, dry dry. The salad was too much chopped onion, some chopped cucumber (I'm guessing they chop them small for the dill sauce and save some for the salad), chopped lettuce and a few kalamata olives. The featured skewers (lamb & tomato/onion) were okay but I've had skewers just as good at the kabob place with the same amount of sides for half the price. By the way, the olives were the tastiest part of the entire meal.  Finally, the food temperature was just above warm. I'll give them a little reprieve in this area because they said it would be ready in 10-15 minutes. We live just around the corner from the place and we picked it up at 15 minutes. I guess they hadn't planned on packaging to maintain the temperature of the food.  So will I return, nope, not without a half off coupon so that I can get my money's worth. I will continue to search for quality Greek food and know that I can get a least better food at the Mad Greek.",

    "text": "My first experience was when the restaurant first opened.  My boyfriend and I walked in and saw that there was not table service and the place was difficult to walk around in so we walked out and went somewhere else that night.   The second experience was a take out order.  I walked in and was told that I could not place an order at the front and was told to walk around the restaurant to the other entrance and place an order there.  I wish I had been walked to that area, via the inside of the restaurant, and just been told that there was a separate entrance for take out orders so that I did not have to wait at the main entrance.  I ordered my meal and Rhonda was at the cashier station.  When I mentioned that I was from Tucson, AZ, she was even more welcoming and shared the history that she and Joe have with Tucson.  We exchanged business cards and they were both great and friendly.  The meal I took home was alright, nothing special but I thought I would try coming in and sitting down next time because the service format had changed and there was now table service.  Good idea. The third experience was when my boyfriend and I walked in and we were first seated at a table in the middle of the room.  No thank you, we asked for a more private booth and were seated in a more comfortable area.  We noticed that every table that came in the restaurant was offered the same \"middle of the room table\" that we were offered and they all turned it down as well.  Our server was a young woman who was    friendly and welcoming,  I ordered the Jasmine tea after asking her she would recommend it or not, she said, \"I don't drink it so I don't know\".  I ordered it anyways and it was good.  She came back with our drinks and then took our order.  For an appetizer we ordered the Feta Cheese and Olive dish.  The chunks of cheese were too large and numerous, the olives were on the plate where the juices ran all over.  They should have been in a small bowl and then put on the plate.  The olives were pitted too and that is a sign of an inferior taste, and the flavor was strong but inferior.  They tasted like cheap olives.  I ordered the roasted chicken with potatoes and rice.  When the dish came I was so surprised that I was served the Back Bone Cut of the Chicken.  Never in my life have I ever served or been served the Back Bone of a chicken.  There are many very small bones that come off of the vertebra and the meat is tender but the pieces are difficult to get to with a knife and fork.  That is a piece saved for the stock pot.   I sent it back and was given a huge breast which was dry and over seasoned.  The meal was so bad that I ate three bites and we paid the bill and left.  I realize that this is not fast food and it is not a 4 star establishment but the food was not good and the servers are not well trained.  Our server filled our glasses every time we took a sip and checked up on us every 2 minutes, the knives were sent back because they were dirty, the food was terribly prepared, served and when we gave feedback we were looked at like we had two heads.  On top of it, when Joe came to the table to apologize, I reminded him of our previous meeting and he must not have heard one word that I said because he just stared at me and then went on about the food.  I owned 4 restaurants for many years and I know what good service is, this was poor service and poor food.  When the owner meets a customer, it is important to remember them because even when the food  is off for the night, the customer will give you another try.  For me, three strikes and you are out and I have a story that I will share with friends now.",

    "text": "Horrible experience with the take out staff and kitchen staff last night.  This was the third time they got my gyro platter wrong in the last two months. After they claimed to correct the order, it was still completely wrong.  We spoke to owner/manager Joe later in the evening, not sure if anything can be corrected.  Staff think that customers don't know Greek food although many of us the customers are either Greek or from Mediterranean countries. Ordered the following:  1) Ordered plain Gyro with nothing on it.  Came as a Pita sandwich with thick combination of  inside the bread.  Sent it back, and it still came back 15 minutes later same way.  I don't believe they fixed the problem.  When the take out person went back to the kitchen to ask kitchen staff to fix it, I heard laughter from the kitchen. I guess it is pretty funny when you don't do your job right !  2) Ordered pita bread 'plain'.  It came with 'rosemary'.  Some people are allergic to rosemary.  Our order was very clear.   3) Ordered salads with no onions in them.  They looked like they added extra onions to salads !  This whole ordeal took 1 hour !   for take out.  Is this a joke ?  When we brought the food home, it was cold.  and home is around the corner.  As frequent customers (twice a week) and occasional catering since the day they opened, this was the worst we have seen.    Also the smart ass waiter asked for my ID for the $45 dollar order and questioned that I had a moustache in my ID photo and I don't have a moustache in person.  Are you guys trying to LOSE customers ?",

    "text": "Tried this place with my girlfriend a few days back because we were craving Greek food. The food and iced tea were great, but we left feeling a little hustled by the end of it.  We both decided we wanted gyros and dessert but the waitress pushed appetizers until we were caught in a bind of saying \"sure,\" so we got a plate of the \"Platos Potatoes.\" They were decent steak-cut fries but very salty. That whole interaction is what took off one star from my review.  Though the waitress was super nice and thorough, we said right off the bat that we wanted entrees and dessert, and that we would skip the apps. Why not listen to the customer? No, we didn't have to say yes to apps but she wasn't taking no for an answer.  Our gyros were great (my lady got the traditional and I got the chicken.) We also ordered a slice of their \"award winning\" baklava crust cheesecake to go. It was interesting, but not my favorite off the wall cheesecake flavor. I think I would have liked a cannoli.  The second star comes off with the menu. There are several items listed as vegan that have dairy products listed in their descriptions. If it isn't actually vegan, why is that V there? It would make me nervous to eat here if I had an allergy or dietary restriction, or even a gluten intolerance just because the menu is blatantly wrong and potentially misleading.  We will probably check out the other location sometime when our next Greek food craving hits, but this one kind of left a bad taste in our mouths.",

I wasn't going to but when I got up to get find my bill and pay, my waiter was at the register so I said to him,  \"man what lame service tonight... I never seen you after you took our order, no one ever came by to check if we needed anything, no drink refills, no napkins and I'm with a toddler..  Here's his tip: When a guest complains before paying their bill, they are giving you a chance to fix their dining experience.  The most neutral thing you could have said and still salvaged a portion of your tip would have been, \"I'm so sorry\"....  Instead, he says, \"yeah we're busy, mother day weekend and I have a group.\"",

Each one of these dishes were absolutely delicious, came to our table nice and warm, service was excellent, the server was very polite and helpful. Even the house wine rocks! They have daily specials. I highly recommend this place. You won't be disappointed.",

I also recommend their falafel balls with the cucumber dill sauce. And you MUST get their baklava with a giant scoop of vanilla ice cream!!",

The atmosphere was friendly with light music playing in the background. Our waitress, Nicole, was very helpful and friendly. She recommended the flaming cheese as an appetizer. Good call. Very unique and tasty. I opted for the Pomegranate Chicken as my entree. It was tender and juicy with plenty of flavor. The greek salad was fresh, the rice was cooked to perfection and the hummus and pita bread was a nice touch. The portion sizes left us stuffed, without room for dessert. Dinner for two with an appetizer was right around $45 including the tip. I will definitely return.",

About 5 minutes later a server came by and asked us what our drink order was, confused we told the server our order. Well after about ten minutes or more my husband finally asks if we could get our drinks and if we could actually order. The server quickly too our food order with zero introduction of the restaurant (all the other tables received). Overall it seriously too way too long just to even get our drinks and finally our food. Again it seemed that no other tables had this issue.  Food: the food was delicious! The gyros were yummy along with the fries, it made a great lunch!

    "text": "By far I would have to say this was the worst service I have experienced.  A couple friends of mine and I decided to eat here for lunch. We were asked if we had ever been in before, we replied that all but one of us had not and she had not been here for a very long time.   We were explained to order off a board and then they would bring the food to us which was fine, the decor was very warm and inviting and did have almost an outdoorsy feel. Overall the interior was great. The guy who took my order was very informative, polite, and had extensive knowledge of their menu.   I placed my order, then my 1st friend placed hers, and finally my 2nd friend placed hers. We sat down at a table. We were given our appetizer a few minutes after selecting our table, the hummus was ok, almost tasted like they used sour cream in it, not the best I have tasted but it also was not the worst.   A few minutes later a younger girl came up to our table with 2 plates and just stared at me with a blank smile. It was really kind of uncomfortable. I was starting to think that she either could not speak, forgot how to speak, or was just memorized by our charming good looks, then she finally opened her mouth and I realized that all of the above were incorrect, she just did not really understand life or what was going on in it.    She passed me my plate, passed the 3rd person hers, she then said \"enjoy\" and my 2nd friend, the one who placed her order 2nd never received her order. She spoke up and asked the dazed girl \"Are you bringing my order soon?\" The girl just looked at us with a glazed over look and flashed a half crooked smile , almost as to say I have no idea what you are talking about-I just work here or maybe am new and do not understand words kind of a smile and walked away.   After several minutes this mindless girl emerged from what we believe was the bathroom and we tried to flag her down, she walked passed us and up to where the kitchen staff handed out the food. We noticed there were 2 more plates and assumed it was the 2nd friend's meal.  We again were wrong, it was the food of 2 patrons that had came in several minutes after we had sat down.    Finally we flagged down Maria who was extremely rude and condescending and asked where the order was, we even flashed her the receipt. She question as if we really had even ordered anything for my 2nd friend and looked at her appetizer plate as if to say she already scarfed down her order. When she was informed that we are still waiting she snapped at us and told us that we were not on the same page as her and basically told us to settle down and did not understand what was going on, Apparently confusion runs rampant in this hole and the right hand has no clue what the left hand is doing at all! It is not even aware there is another hand. My 2nd friend asked if she could either have her money back or her order and Maria just stood there like a statue and glared as if my friend spoke to her in a foreign language. Extremely unprofessional, at no point in time did Maria ever say \"I am sorry for the mishap, let me figure out what is going on and I will be right back.\" We were made to feel like liars.   She walked away with the receipt which we requested to be given back and took several minutes at the register, my 2nd friend finally had to walk up and ask what was going on. Maria snapped at her \"WE ARE NOT ON THE SAME PAGE!!! DO YOU JUST WANT YOUR MONEY BACK?!!\" Well no, she wanted to eat since we only have an hour lunch and the majority of it was wasted trying to figure out where the food was she had paid for, NOT ROCKET SCIENCE!!  Maria stated that she had nothing to do with this and she refused to apologize because it was not her mistake!!  I am sorry, but I would assume that the manager IS responsible for her employees and their mistakes! Maria asked \"Would you like an apology, because we are not on the same page!\" My 2nd friend said \"No, the way you are just staring at me with that confused look, makes me feel like you think I stole the food\" Maria just stood there for 10 minutes staring at my friend like an idiot. No refund was offered, but my friend was finally provided her order but was made to stand at the food line and had to walk her food over to our table.   Upon leaving we asked for Maria's managers name and she was in shock like we would have the nerve to ask for this and again NEVER apologized for the crappy service. The best part is when she actually told us to have a nice day! I am sorry that I had actually gave a 20% tip at the beginning right after I placed my order.  The \"Beef/Lamb\" Gyro sucked, was the worst I have ever tasted, I would not recommend this to an enemy and the service sucks! Maria should not be dealing with the public at all.",

Nothing above and beyond what we've tasted in the past from other Greek restaurants.   Service was good and the staff is friendly.

When they 1st opened up at their other, smaller location in the NW the food was really good & I was excited because at that time we really didn't have a whole lot of options up here but then they moved to a bigger space also in the NW & the food really went downhill. I heard it was because they changed to a different and cheaper meat supplier but I don't know this for sure- it makes sense though because the gyros meat & chicken went from pretty good (not the best but good enough that I would have kept going there) to pretty sub-par/ not good at all. I tried a few times after the move for at least a year but haven't wanted to go back anymore after that many sub par meals. Too bad because when they 1st opened I was going there like once month.",

We finally decided we wanted to try something different for dinner and decided to stop in. We got lucky and went in during happy hour. They have some discounts on wine and appetizers. We tried the appetizer sampler so we could try a bunch of different things since we weren't sure what any of them were. For the most part, everything was great. There were a couple things we didn't care for but it was because of our personal preferences in tastes. He got the greek trio so again we could try a few different menu items and I got the keftedes and they were both pretty good. You get a decent amount of food with your meal and a salad, hummus and pita bread. It was a lot more than I expected and I couldn't eat it all so I had almost a whole meal for breakfast. Next time I'll only order my meal and not an appetizer too because it was a lot. We got a dessert to try: the apollo's cheesecake and I absolutely love cheesecake, but I will say that I wasn't a big fan. I don't know what it was about it, but I just didn't like it. I was bummed that it wasn't as good as I was expecting. I don't think you can really go wrong with any of the food tho. Everybody has different tastes. We will definitely be going back to tr y some of their other platters.",

Can't find the noodle casserole in the fast food gyros places and that's what I love, but found a delicious casserole here.  My husband likes gyros and found the meat on this one a little dry. The prices were good, the service excellent, the atmosphere was that of a fancy dinner restaurant.  The menu had Italian meals, also. Something we'll try next visit!",

Prices aren't too high, you will definitely get what you pay for. Plus, it's always nice that the owner, or a member of his family, is always there walking around and talking to people about their meals. You can tell that the family truly cares about their business.",

I had never had the flaming cheese and brandy dish called saganake, but wow: this was outstanding! The servers are very knowledgeable and quick, and I like the layout with plenty of space between parties. Parking is plentiful and there is music on Fridays and Saturdays. Somehow, with all this, it is easy to have a conversation. For people who cannot tolerate gluten, they have basmati rice and other dishes which are available. This is a great new discovery!!",

    "text": "Market Grille Cafe is a great place to grab some food to go, dine inside or even hold a party in their banquet area. There's a good amount of dining space with tables as well booths and there's also a spacious patio if eating outside is your thing. You can also place a phone order and use the door on the side of the building with a sign designated for pick up orders. I do recommend placing your order ahead of time instead of walking in to order because they get busy around dinner and it helps avoid a longer wait time. I have ordered before and showed up 5 minutes after they said it would be ready and still waited like 10 minutes. The staff is friendly and servers have been good about checking my table for refills while dining inside and I also appreciate how when I arrive to pick up a phone order that they go over everything to make sure it's all correct and that it's all there.   Pomegranate Chicken Mediterranean Wrap ($9.50) - Pomegranate chicken, lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions, red cabbage, basmati rice, feta cheese with your choice of sauce (hummus or yogurt dill) and tortilla (flour, wheat and spinach-basil). I asked for extra yogurt dill (extra .50 cents) and spinach-basil for the tortilla. I really like the flavor of the pomegranate chicken and veggies together and the yogurt dill sauce is good. The wrap is huge I usually only eat half and save the rest for later. All wraps include a side Greek salad. The salad tastes fresh, but not the best I have had.  They have a lunch special from 11:30 am - 3 pm that's currently $8.50. You can choose from a gyro, pomegranate chicken, wrap or skewer and you also get to choose from platos potatoes (seasoned fries), salad, basmati rice or soup. The lunch special also includes a drink. Not a bad deal at all. The seasoned fries are really good and the dipping sauce that comes with them tastes good.",

Despite the parking lot being right beyond the gate, the atmosphere was still nice.  Our waiter was attentive the entire night, but I wasn't very happy with management when the misters came on as the sun went down, and they balked at turning them off even though there was only one other patron outside who was fine with them being turned off.    Anyway, the food was mixed for us.  The Mediterranean Medley app was pretty good overall; unfortunately, neither of us enjoyed the Dolmades.  As for the main courses, my wife had the gyro, which she enjoyed more than other places, but she felt the side rice was bland.  I really was expecting more from the lamb roast cabernet; it was just alright for me.  However, the side potatoes were excellent.  All in all, we're on the fence on whether we'll give it another shot.",

Market Grille was one of the first locally owned restaurants we tried when we relocated to Las Vegas in 2011 and we have been coming back several times a month (sometimes 1-2 times a week) since then.   While many things have changed in Las Vegas, Market Grille remains consistent--in all the right ways. Whether we are picking up take out after a long day, or want to bring out of towners for a relaxed patio dinner on a nice summer evening, we know that everyone will leave full and happy.  My mom is gluten free, I have several vegetarian friends, the menu accommodates almost everyone's needs. My favorites are the lemon chicken soup, the pomegranate chicken, and the stuffed tomatoes. The baklava is also amazing, and the pumpkin cheesecake if you are feeling particularly indulgent.   Market Grille has gone out of their way for me on several occasions - giving me a laminated copy of their nutritional information (before the menu changed a little - not sure if these are still available) to even pureeing lentil soup for me when I had suffered a dental emergency.   Both dining room and take out service and food are consistent - I've never gotten food home with any problems, or anything slimy and cold. Truly a neighborhood gem.",

Everything is so fresh and flavorful.  My favorite is the chicken gyro with their delicious dill yogurt sauce, and a lentil soup.  Really though, everything on the menu is wonderful.  The spinach basil hummus and also the spanokopita are also favorites of mine.  The staff is friendly and welcoming, too.",

The meat at Market Grille had a strange texture and reminded me of the meatballs I had from the hospital cafeteria.   I would also say the tzaziki sauce is 100x better at Yassou and Baladie as well.   My husband had the pomegranate chicken platter at Market Grille and he really enjoyed it.",

Good thing, because otherwise this review would have taken a turn for the worse.",

Not only are the food and the service delightful, but the vibe you get when you walk in, seeing Rose (the Matriarch of the family-owned restaurant) attending to the little things, greeting customers, making the utensil bundles in napkins, checking in on happy customers... It's simply wonderful. I have 0% Greek/Mediterranean blood, but the place feels like my Swedish Gramma's kitchen -- full of love, great aromas and happiness.   I had the Gyro Platter (it was lunch-ish time). It was GENEROUS and delicious. I opted for the Traditional Beef and Lamb combo filling, but there are many choices, including Vegan. The homemade hummus was tangy and delicious. The Basmati rice - perfection. The green salad was all Greek with olives, cucumbers and Feta cheese and you MUST try the Pumpkin-Mushroom Soup -- a cup was just not enough. Next time, I'm getting a full bowl or maybe some to take home. It is comfort in a cup.   My husband had the Greek Trio, Pastisto, Mousaka and one other item (sorry, I was more focused on tasting my delicious Gyro) and he was very pleased with all of it.  We opted for dessert to be taken out and it didn't disappoint. The Baklava was also generously served and was sweet, sweet, sweet.  Love that we live close to the Market Grill Cafe and we WILL be back & bring visiting relatives/friends to partake in the delightful food.",

All four of us ordered the Greek Trio Platter - Spanakopita, Pastitsio, and Moussaka, which included a small Greek salad and a tiny cup of hummus on the plate, along with baby-sized pita triangles.    The spinach pie was sorely lacking in spinach, and didn't even look attractive.  The meat in the other two items was ground so fine that it was like a paste.  I guess it's hard to avoid overcooking the macaroni in the pastitsio, since it's boiled, then baked, then reheated, but this was mush.  The pastitsio and moussaka were sorely lacking in flavor and seasoning, and the hummus was watery and tasteless.  Even the Greek salad, which I'm not a big fan of, since I don't love feta and always find the dressing too sharp for my taste, had a balsamic dressing that was too bland.  It's been a very long time since that meal at the Lake Mead branch, and since then I've had many wonderful dinners at other Greek restaurants.  This one just didn't measure up.",

As a person who has never tried Greek food outside of trying it at this restaurant (thus having nothing to compare it to), I would still say that this place has delicious foods! I was vegan for a year and eating out with others was very difficult for me, but this place has so many great options for vegans! I usually get the lentil soup and they always ask if I want the cheese off, knowing that it is a vegan dish. :) I also get the hummus and pita bread and its so good! I usually get the trio with my family. The warm pita paired with the zesty-tangy hummus makes my mouth so happy!   The atmosphere is nice and definitely a good restaurant to try out if you are in the mood for Greek or something different from fast food. (Some dishes may be a little \"sour\" for people if you are sensitive to Greek yogurt, dill, or lemon. Just order a more savory dish if you don't like lemon.)",

They try to do a modern Greek. The tables even have pictures under the glass I assume of Greece.  Now to the food. They have a Trio platter which is perfect so I can try 3 dishes most greek/med food places do. The Spanakopita was good. It consisted of spinach, feta & romano cheese, layered & baked in a buttery filo pastry. I love the flaky crust. The Mousaka was just like I have had at so many places which isn't a bad thing as it tasted great. It consisted of ground beef, eggplant & potato casserole, baked in tomato sauce cheese. Topped with a cream and grated cheese sauce. The Pastitsio which I had never had before was macaroni pie, baked with ground beef & tomato sauce with some cinnamon & nutmeg. It was really good. I got the entree so I had a Greek salad with it as well and it was fresh. The herb rice had a nice spice flavor to it. I'm not a hummus fan but boy this hummus was good with the fresh pita bread.  For dessert we decided on the Dolce Nannie which is 3 of their desserts. We chose the Canoli, Pumpkin Baklava Cheesecake, Stellas Honey Cake. Canoli was like any canoli and that's not bad because it was good. The winners were the pumpkin baklava cheesecake and stellas honey cake. Perfect sweetness!  Service was excellent. The waitress seemed to know the perfect time to show up and ask to fill our drinks. She even offered to go boxes for the little leftovers my girlfriend had.  I give Market Grille Cafe 4 stars for such a great experience. Can't wait to go back.",

Although the guy who took my order was nice, I had to repeat my order twice and had to correct him when he read it back to me and was missing an item. Of course when I got there it was still wrong. I ordered 3 gyro sandwiches, 1 gyro platter, large order of platos potatoes (seasoned fries)  and some cheesecake. I received only 3 gyros so I was missing one. This was what I kept telling the guy over the phone that I wanted 3 gyros PLUS the platter but he still didn't get it. Oh well he didn't charge me for it and I didn't want to wait longer for them to make it so I just left with what I had.  The gyro was gross the meat was cold, very dry and flavorless. We asked for the cucumber sauce on the side and it came in 1oz cups. Same with the hummus that comes w/ the platter and the sauce that comes with the large order of fries. Reallly 1oz??? It makes me angry to pay 8.00 for a sandwich and get a little cup of sauce. Gyro time is way better for gyros if that's what your looking for do not waste your time here! I did enjoy the aphrodite cheesecake which is why the 1 star but everything else from the food to the service was crappy.",

This came as a surprise since they were so on point with their customer service the first time around. When we were first seated, our server came up and with out a greeting or introducing himself just asked for our drink order. Came back with our drinks but disappeared for a good 20 minutes before coming back for our food order. No apologies, just came back and asked what we were having.  A runner brought our food out and not once did our server ask if we needed anything or how our food was. It took forever to get our check and the rest of my food boxed up. Mind you, it's a Sunday night at 7:30 and they weren't busy...we we're super disappointed.",

I have three stars because I had the signature pomegranate chicken salad and was not impressed. My dad had a separate salad that was also mediocre.

Almost as though they don't follow a recipe to the tee. Other than that the food is awesome. Food portion is perfect. They allow you to substitute items with no charge which is a huge plus. The filet kabob if ordered medium comes out tender. Rice, I'm not a fan off and that's because I grew up eating Japanese rice.",

It was a very special dinner, and we are all so glad we chose MGC for our event. Not only was the food delicious, and the service stellar (Thank you Robert!!!), but we were there chatting and enjoying the conversation well past closing, and not even once did we feel rushed or pushed to leave. We chose the 7070 N. Durango location for our gathering. We had a fantastic and relaxing time and so enjoyed catching up and breaking bread together. Thank you Market Grille Cafe! OPA!",

They even have a sign up saying to tell them if you're vegan or vegetarian, and they'll accommodate!  As a vegan it's nice to not have to list off the ingredients I need to be warned of, or get an allergen information sheet to read through... I just say \"vegan dolmades please!\" and get a delicious fresh order of dolmades without the non-vegan sauce.  Their carryout is incredibly convenient - there's a secondary door for only carryout, that opens into a room with a counter to order at, and waiting room for you to sit while you wait for your food.",

Not impressed at all... I was disappointed... I really wanted to like it. So I ordered the baklava seperate... Still just not very good. The falafel not good either. But, then again I'm just not a fan of falafel in the first place.   The really good thing here is the spanikopita! Yum! Add a little tzatsiki and yeah...it is worth coming here for that again!",

Everything is made fresh onsite by awesomely surly Greek studs who mutter \"OPA!\" with phoned-in enthusiasm whenever someone puts a tip in the jar. But I don't care how surly those motherfuckers are -- they make some BOMB-ASS food!  On my first visit, I had saganaki (a/k/a flaming fried cheese), lentil soup (!!!) and a pomegranate chicken wrap. Everything was EXCELLENT! My friend also had soup and a gyro platter, and the total was around $45. I came back another time and had chicken kabobs or something...don't remember exactly what, but I do remember it being DELICIOUS and amazing!",

I always get their filet skewer, which also comes with rice, vegetables, pita & hummus, and a Greek salad. I always get a side of their yogurt dill sauce and it's to die for. They had a special going on in October for breast cancer and their cookies had the most amazing pink frosting on it.   There is always a young gentleman who always works the takeout area when I come in. Very polite and courteous even when it's been busy.",

She explained everything to us, was attentive, and even picked up a toy our 11-month old dropped. The restaurant itself was beautiful and comfortable. Food was delivered quick.  The not-so-good: the food. It was underwhelming. I got the gyro with a side of fries and my husband got the spanakopita, and we tried their baklava. My meal was basically boring; no flavors, other than the raw onions, stood out. The meat was tender and moist, but lacked flavor; the pita bread was nice though. The spanakopita was not memorable either. The baklava was enormous, but it was gritty - maybe from too much brown sugar, we're not sure. We didn't finish any parts of our meal.  We were very disappointed. We usually go to Paymon's, but it's a bit of a trek from our house, so we were hoping the Market Grille could be a substitute, but alas, it cannot compete with Paymon's.",

The owner lied and told him he doesnt get paid overtime after 8 hours. He said overtime is only after 40 hours in a week. My son worked 9 and 10 hour days sometimes. Also they have to clock in for their shift according to the restaurant clock time which is set 5 minutes fast. So on the computer it shows them clocking in at 5 before the shift began. So at the end of the night they go into the computer and ajust the time and take away 5 minutes from each employee.  This is just dishonest robbery.",
