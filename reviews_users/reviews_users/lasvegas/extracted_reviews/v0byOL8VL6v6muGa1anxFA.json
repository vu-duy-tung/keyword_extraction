Everything was wonderful, but for now, I want to touch on one item:  The Baba Ganoush    I'm no expert on Mediterranean cuisine. As such, baba ganoush has always been a \"sure, I'll have some\" kind of thing for me. I could take it or leave it.   Not this, though. This had so much more flavor than any I've ever had. If previous incarnations were a 4, The Hummus Factory's version is a 14! This is something special and I cannot say enough good things about it.",

    "text": "I have been to The Hummus Factory twice since it opened.  The service is fantastic. The server (not sure what his name is) has a genuine smile and very polite. I always tip him very well because he works hard and truly deserves it.  Price range is pretty competitive with others in the city (example Paymon's). The decor is quite interesting as it doesn't read Mediterranean although it is very well kept and clean. I will say that my first visit during the summer almost killed me; the air conditioning either wasn't working or they just didn't turn it on to save on electricity. It was way too warm and I was sat way in the back of the restaurant by the back entrance when there was no one else in the restaurant.  The second time around it was still slightly warm but much cooler than the first time.    The eggplant and zucchini fries are huge portions and are cut slightly too big for my taste. I think they would be crispier if they were cut slightly smaller. The portions are big and remind me of CheeseCake Factory sizes, very rare to find this in Mediterranean restaurants.    Overall, I definitely recommend this place perhaps in the fall and winter when it's cooler unless they worked on the A/C system. The service is excellent, food is pretty consistent...Also, I happened to catch a wild Pickachu playing Pokemon Go in the restaurant as I waited for my food.  That itself is 2 stars alone!!!!!",

Pros: *lady in front was friendly  *white linen tablecloths   Cons: *bunch of stuff in front of cash register  *was given a falafel with everything on it. good thing I checked before leaving parking lot *in my already busy day, had to wait for 2 orders  *have had better pitas and gyro meat *don't prefer fries with added seasoning  There are at least 3 better Mediterranean restaurants in the Vegas area.

We had the offer for free factory hummus and that came out immediately (thank god because we were hungry!) my sister ordered the fatoosh salad which was amazing! So flavorful and a huge portion size. It came out also immediately and we shared with the homemade pita and hummus. It took forever for my Greek burger and eggplant fries to come out. I was already full by the time it arrived and when it was ready it stood in the kitchen for another 10 minutes prior to it being served to me. I would expect next time both entrees to be delivered at the same time as that is the correct way to serve food. All in all, I love this place. The Greek burger was flavor packed with spices and sauces my tongue has never tasted before. The chefs are truly amazing. I would just fix the timing of the food for future reference.",

It was about a 28-minute drive to get here from the Monte Carlo on a Friday Night but it was worth it. Their portions are really generous. I had to try the eggplant fries- it was good. The pink sauce that went with it made it even better. But I prefer my eggplant to be soft and slimy instead of firm and crispy. So I wouldn't get it again. The sliders were really good and had good flavor. Good luck trying to finish all three. They were huge and more like \"mini-burgers\". Their desserts were really good too and not too sweet.   I love all the various halal options and the restroom was very clean. Will definitely visit again.",

    "text": "Ordered hummus, Baba Ganoosh, chicken frarej, lamb chops.  Hummus was spot on and creamy, and baba ganoosh was delicious, garlicky, lemony goodness.  The chicken frarej was finger licking good.  The drippings and vegetables cooked in the sauce just wanted to be mopped up with the pita.  The lamb chops were the only thing I could really be critical about.  A bit over seasoned and salty as well as  over cooked. I asked for a medium and it was certainly in the med-well plus category.  The onions and the veg skewer it came with was tasty. The fries were cooked to perfection.   The service was pleasant, though some wait times were a little long, as she was both waitress busgirl and host she did phenomenally for a moderately busy evening. Kudos to you!",

    "text": "This is my second review, and unfortunately I have to take down two stars because of my last visit...First I am going to start with the positive: The place is nicely decorated, with a friendly atmosphere and good music. The food choices are wider than most Lebanese restaurants, offering more than the traditional menu offered everywhere. The quality is good and close to authentic, but since my previous visit, I had to change my opinion a little:  First, after a long wait, I received my order first; I thought the other two are on the way. As a courtesy, I decided to wait for my friend's food to arrive. By the time it arrived (20 mns later!), my food was cold and I could not enjoy it. Not only that, but I ordered the Beef Shawarma, and to my shock, I see what looked like thin slices of steak, instead of shredded beef as it is traditionally (and the ONLY way) served. When I tried it, it did not even taste like shawarma; the spices were not even close to the real thing. I have to say I was very disappointed, especially that I had a good experience on my previous visit, and the owner/chef is Lebanese so there is no excuse for not knowing the proper way to serve shawarma as it is one of our iconic dishes. My friend who also ordered and loved the Soujouk last time ordered it again but this time it was not the same...I did not want to give a bad review because I know they will fix this, and the place, being new probably is still tweaking everything like any new business, Hopefully they will work on how to serve the shawarma properly if they want to claim to have authentic Lebanese cuisine. It would have been the right thing also to offer not to charge my order since both waitresses were aware that I could not enjoy my food being cold; I did not want to make a big deal of it, but any respectable restaurant would offer at least that or some alternative... Also I read from another review that they take too long to bring the bread and the owner's answer was that it is because it is served fresh to order. In my opinion, the bread's freshness should not affect the service or quality of the food, so unless they can maintain the same quality and handle the pressure of traffic (which I hope they will have), then you can serve regular pre-made bread until then. Most restaurants do that and nobody complains, because it it the food quality and service that counts at the end; the fresh baked bread should only be an added bonus, but not at the expense of important things, because people will not go just for the bread but the overall experience, in my humble opinion. One last thing:  food should NEVER be served that far apart; most people will not start eating unless everyone is ready, so this is more of an etiquette issue than quality of food. I personally would have preferred to wait the extra 20 mns and enjoy my food WITH my friends than to stare at it then eat it cold... Despite everything, I still love the place and wish the owner all the luck; like every new business, it takes time to make everything perfect. that's why there are good and bad reviews, because this is how you improve. The servers are very friendly and I know the food is too in general, so I will definitely go back there and hope that this was a one-time experience and look forward for my next visit. (But PLEASE do not serve the shawarma like slices of steak; it is the whole point of shawarma! :) ).  Sorry for the long review, I did not want to present a negative one without giving the place the credit it deserves in other areas, I cannot wait to go again soon and give a much better rating!!",

    "text": "This place was awkward at first. When we walked in no one was there to sit us, I waited for a minute and then decided just to take a seat. However, once I went to sit down someone came out to help us. Not horrible, just awkward! The music also sounded a little like a Bollywood/slasher flick combined. There were moments it was terrifying and moments where it was fun and upbeat. There were several times I remarked to my date \"do you hear this music?\"   Once we sat everything was pretty impressive. Our drinks were refilled on the regular. The first things that came out were the tabouli, pita bread, and eggplant fries with a side of Mediterranean butter. The fries came in a giant bowl. It was a lot more than we expected. They were good, but I preferred the zucchini fries that came later. The tabouli was citrusy/minty and delicious. The pita bread was puffy, like two slices of pita were stuck together and filled the middle with air. It wasn't bad, just not what I am used to. I actually may have liked it more because it felt \"lighter.\"   The next appetizer that came out was Hollaum Cheese ant was fantastic. It comes out with three pieces of fried Lebanese cheese and cut up tomatoes, cucumbers, and pickles. It's $12, so I do have to say it is expensive for what you get. I wish it had at least four pieces of cheese. However, it was certainly my favorite dish of the night, and if you love cheese it is a must try!   Then our entrees came out, with my dates coming about 10 minutes after mine which was weird but forgivable. I had an entree size of the Greek salad, and it was HUGE. It was also incredibly unique. It had all the regular trappings of a Greek salad but also a little ZING. I don't know what gave it the kick at the end, but I ended up trading it for my partners beef shwarma. He LOVED the salad. The shwarma was eh. We subbed rice for zucchini fries - it was a good choice. Try something else tough.  I'm coming back to try those carrot fries!",

I'm happy to say I wasn't let down, it does have good flavor and the portion sizes are large. It was easy to find they have a frontage location with plenty of parking. The moment I pulled up I said what a nice little place, upon waking in I was greeted with a smile and a hello welcome to hummus factory as she was serving a table. I think it's important to be acknowledged, especially when it's your first time in an establishment. The place is clean, friendly and fast service.  We had the chicken kabobs served on rice, Greek salad, hummus and a gyro! All of it was really good food.",

For starters they bring out herb butter for your fresh pita and it's straight out of the oven. What a nice touch! Then the regular fries and zucchini fries were perfectly crunchy and the gyros come with very flavorful meat dripping in tzatziki sauce with fresh tomatoes, red onions and lettuce. We ate everything up!   Decor is great and it's very clean. Next time I need to try the hummus because this place is called the hummus factory! We will definitely be back.",

Upon reading the great reviews, we decided to check it out on a Sunday (we didn't know it was closed and checked on google and Google said it was open) now, we live across town so we drove somewhat far and were bummed out to see that it was closed! Nevertheless, we really wanted to try it out so we decided to check it out on a Tuesday night. As soon as we walked in, we immediately loved the decor! The service was also very nice! She was very busy as she was the only one in front and had a few large tables, but still managed to keep checking on us! The food was DELICIOUS!! I mean everything was so good!! The portions were HUGE! All the food had great taste, my bf got the spinach salad and added chicken to it and it was so good! I had the chicken Shawarma with zucchini fries that was delicious, and we also ordered the factory hummus, which was so good as well! Definitely worth the long drive! We have decided that from now on, this will be our monthly (and I'm pretty sure many more times) dinner date for our anniversary! Also, the lemonade is freshly made and delicious! Not too sweet just how I like it.",

The piping hot bread at H Factory hits the spot but the hummus is just average. The kafta was dry unfortunately, the chicken shawarma lacked authentic spices and was a mess to eat. The zucchini fries were a hit but there is better hummus, sharwarma and koobideh elsewhere in Vegas.",

He exposed me to everything he had and it was delicious, as was my meal. The waitress was so very friendly too--her brother owns the place apparently. The place was so intimate and beautiful, though minimalistic and urban. We are definitely going to be regulars here. The prices are so great for the quality and quantity that you get here too.

    "text": "RESCUED BY RESTAURANT OWNER!!!   Yup!  This just happened.  I am able to write this review in the comfort of my own home thanks to restaurant owner & chef, Tony.  He saw that my husband and I could not get our car started after eating at The Hummus Factory and immediately offered to help.  Luckily for us, Tony used to be a mechanic before becoming a fantastic chef and he still loves to tinker with cars.  What are the odds?!    He popped the hood & diagnosed the problem - corroded, dead battery :/    Here's the thing... I JUST had my car serviced by AutoNation Toyota (on Sahara) 2 days ago - for the 40K mile maintenance.  I also asked the techs to please check EVERYTHING else because I have a long road trip ahead of me.   A corroded battery should have been brought to my attention!  But...NOPE.  So, guess who will be getting a bad review?  That's right, AutoNation Toyota, you're now on my sh** list!  Anyway...back to Tony.  I was already planning a repeat trip to The Hummus Factory with friends & family because my husband and I had just finished a fabulous meal served to us by Tony's sister, Alida.  I wanted to wait to write my review until I've had more items though.  But after what Tony did tonight, I had to Yelp about him.   (By the way, we have USAA roadside assistance & Toyota Assist.  But neither could get us up and running tonight.)  Tony cleaned the battery & tried several times to jump start it.  But, no go.  So, he drove us to O'Reilly's for a new battery and installed it for us FREE OF CHARGE!  We offered to compensate Tony.  But, he absolutely refused.    Y'all - Tony & his amazing family deserve some serious Yelp love and good karma.  His sister, wife, & mom work at the restaurant & offered us drinks and a cool place to hang out during all this.  We seriously would have been in a bind and without a car for days had they not helped us.    Thank you, Tony, Alida, Nikki, & \"mom\"!  (Sorry if I spelled your names wrong.)  Unbelievable customer service!!!  Delicious food, dessert, & coffee!  We will 100% be back and can't sing your praises enough.  ****************************************  UPDATE:  We've been back on our own & with work colleagues.  Last night, we hosted a dinner for 20.  We literally wanted to try everything on the menu & needed help.  So, we rounded up some folks...all first timers.  Our group was very well taken care of from beginning to end.  We enjoyed everything on the menu.  Really cannot go wrong with anything here.    NOTE:  The ghost pepper hummus was too spicy for most in our group.  But, I loved it!",

We tried a bunch of things as we always do to assess the restaurant and we were not disappointed. Everything is fresh, made on site and full of flavor. Here is the run down: Homemade fresh lemonade - amazing  Regular Humus - amazing (ordered two) FRESH pita - yes, yes and yes!  Eggplant French fries - ok but won't order again Fatoosh salad - ok but there are other good things Kibbe platter - amazing  Chicken shawarma platter - amazing  (The rice and veggies that came with the platter were fantastic too).   We can't wait to return - perfect for lunch, dinner, large parties and dinner with the kiddies.",

    "text": "Formerly a food truck, the Hummus Factory finally has a brick and mortar spot- conveniently located near several gyms for healthy pre- or post-workout eats! Don't worry though, their menu isn't all healthy stuff- but it IS all tasty.  Highly recommend their salads- start at $10, add on protein separately. Price seems steep til you realize the portion could feed a whole family. The Greek with Falafel was literally all I ate one day, fresh and packed with olives. Add a side of hummus and pita, which comes out piping hot from the oven.   Went in another day for a chicken shawarma wrap- super moist with tons of tahini and grilled onions. For best results, upgrade to the eggplant fries, they're lightly battered and seasoned and frankly, life-changing. I dip them in straight Sriracha and dream of them. My guy loved the combination lunch plate(chicken and steak). The grilled onions on that are awesome too, and I like how they use a sauce and herbs in their rice to keep it from being the same generic white rice you get everywhere else in town. Meat and veggies were perfectly grilled.  Service is super friendly and treats you like a regular after just one visit. Food comes out fast and everything is super fresh. Next time, I'm having the shrimp scampi and Greek burger. And the feta app. Okay, so the whole menu probably.  TIP: Check in on the Yelp app for free hummus!",

    "text": "If I had known that hummus was a staple in vegetarian diets, I would have quit eating meat years ago! I've been here 3 times in 1 week and my wallet is begging me not to go back!  Each time I've been here I ordered the hummus appetizer.  It comes with 2 fresh baked pita breads so watch out, they're hot!  The hummus is fresh, smooth and creamy.  If you order from the lunch and dinner menu, you can choose to include a smaller side of hummus with your order without ordering the appetizer sized one. Check my photos for a size comparison.  They also give you the option to upgrade the hummus to a spicy version for only a dollar more. Speaking of spicy..  Wow! The habanero hummus is hot! And amazing! I asked whether they used chili oil or flakes and I was told they use fresh peppers. Neat! They also have jalapeno as well as ghost pepper hummus so make sure to try them out.  Each time I've been here I had the shawarma. I've eaten both the chicken and the beef and they were both delicious. The chicken was juicy and flavorful, and the beef was perfectly tender. The fries... oh man, even the fries are amazing! They come with the burgers and sandwiches and they are perfectly fried to a golden yellow crisp. Their home sauce is tasty too! It's probably just mayo and ketchup and something else, but it's the perfect condiment. They give you the option to upgrade to eggplant or zucchini fries as well but I haven't given them a fry. Huehuehue   My partner had the shrimp scampi and I mistakingly thought it'd come with pasta but it came with rice, lots of rice. The shrimp was great and flavorful too, but next time we'll order the appetizer size without the rice.  Service was great and attentive from both ladies. Actually, each time I've been there I was the only customer there. They say their slow time is between 3-5pm so make sure to drop by then! They also have different pricing for certain lunch and dinner dishes, but I'm not sure what they are since the shawarma is excluded from that. Dinner pricing starts at 3pm too. For the quality of ingredients, flavor, and friendliness, I give this place 5 stars! Give them a try and don't forget to check in!",

My boyfriend then is forced to order a burger, the server says ok then 5 mins later comes back and says it'll take 20 mins or so to make it. We were in a hurry and said no just cancel everything we will just eat our appetizer. The server was nice but her customer service was not the greatest. She failed to make up for all inconsistencies.

Their zucchini sticks were a great appetizer, followed by some terrific lentil soup and a fresh Greek salad. Chicken shawarma and the chicken kabobs were beyond tasty, both on a bed of rice. The food was filling yet anything but heavy, most of it was as healthy as it gets. The ambiance and feel of the restaurant was warm and very hospitable and the service made us feel like we were eating dinner at a friend's home. We will be visiting this establishment every time we visit Las Vegas and we usually do so about four times a year.

    "text": "I tried to get a groupon for their neighbor hotpot restaurant but it rejected me twice. When we got outside the hot pot place it was empty so we kinda doubted. Then we chance upon Hummus Factory i had to Yelp first then decided to try it and hoping they have that freshly made pita from another Mediterranean place that starts with K. Tory the server was very pleasant and though we were the only one there tonight it felt more inviting. I used my free Hummus in Yelp and I ordered eggplant fries (based on reviews) and hubby got chicken shawarma dinner with baba ganoush as recommended by Tory. We got our hummus first that was so creamy and tasty and piping hot pita with herbed butter (yummy) that was more delicious than \"K\".  In our former Med resto I only eat the pita and their grape seed oil and just share from my husband's order. The flavor of the chicken shawarma and the pink sauce combo plus the rice was so scrumptious I almost want to finish his meal. There was a white sauce Tatziki maybe for the shawarma but hubby liked the my pink sauce better. My eggplant fries was awesome too but I'd like it more crispy (personal pref) again pink sauce...the bomb!  This is a gem that I started telling my friends to try it while still in the restaurant. Verdict:  I'll be back!!! I now love Mediterranean food but only in this place from now on.  Thanks Tory for a great service!!!  We couldn't finish the big portions and wanted our daughter to have some. When she got home she already ate. If I still had space in my tummy I still wanted to finish it but that's gluttony. Lol",

I ordered the combo kabob dinner and substituted the rice for the eggplant fries upgrade + side of baba ganoush. I can't speak for the other dishes, but the dinner portion came plated in a huge bowl with a very, very generous portion of eggplant fries and 3 wonderfully flavored skewers (I ordered 2 shrimp and 1 chicken). The flavor on the skewers and eggplant fries were delicious - whatever spices they use on the eggplant fries are wonderful! A little sweet, spicy, creamy...heaven!  The pita is also amazing - it's fluffy, served piping hot, and much better than the usual pita that other restaurants serve. Definitely coming back and won't be going back to other places!",

They made our experience that much better.   The food is great. We ordered a lot of things on the menu and they were all delicious. The highlights of the meal were the labni matoom, chicken kabobs, fatoosh, kibbi, and the shabiet dessert. Everything tasted authentic and had lots of flavor. If I had one critique, I would say the fried zucchini fries should be cut a little thinner. The flavor is all there, but unfortunately, since they were so thick, it was a little too squishy and took away from the taste. Nevertheless, we had an enjoyable experience and will definitely be back.",

The food is delicious and I usually get two meals out of it given the amount of food they give you.  My go-to order is the shawarma plate. The chicken shawarma is delicious and I love the tahini sauce with it. Along with the rice and veggies, you get quite the meal out of it. Also, it comes with a side which I always get the fatoosh salad. Best salad on the planet!   Even better is their pita bread. It is warm and delicious, but they can't make it fast enough. This is part of the reason I am giving them four stars as opposed to 5. Another reason is because of the service. They are very friendly, but they are FAR too busy to have only one waitress working during the lunch shift. I was bragging about this place to my co-workers and brought them in one day and the service was so slow and we were having to wave down the waitress for more drinks and pita bread. It was kind of embarrassing for me.   I hope they hire extra staff and I will change my review to 5 stars!",

The owner was EXTREMELY accommodating as he did not even have his food truck ready at the time and he managed to cater my wedding on the far east side of town anyway!! The food was absolutely delicious! The lamb shank is my absolute favorite and their jalapeno hummus is fantastic. We also loved the stuffed grape leaves and the chicken shawarma. This place was a total hit at our wedding and we received so many compliments on how delicious the food tasted. We love eating here!",

Each time I have visited, they are never overcrowded and the service is always amazing. I never know what to order when I eat out and they are never short on suggestions.  Today we tried the jalapeno hummus, which is all the yum! I love spicy food and thought the jalapeno was relatively mild so I ordered the ghost pepper hummus to take home to my fiance. YIKES! The flavor is amazing but shortly after your first bite, the ghost peppers smack you right in the face. I'll stick with the jalapeno next time. I also ordered a greek salad with salmon and split it with my friend. The salmon was fresh and cooked perfectly. The salad was gigantic! Needless to say, we came hungry and left satisfied.  I'll definitely keep coming to The Hummus Factory!",

I ordered grilled chicken skewers, hummus, jalapeno hummus, babba ganoosh, and lamb shawarma plate. The pitas and dips came out first when I tell you every single one had wonderful flavor and texture. I couldn't help myself I wanted more and more. Then the main entrees arrived. When I tell you.... the presentation has me salivating. Then I dug in. It was amazing the chicken was flavored and cooked perfectly. I didn't think I'd be able to eat it all..... but I did. From the rice to veggies. I couldn't leave a single bite. The lamb was excellent as well and she ate everything off her plate as well. We couldn't be happier with this lovely restaurant. In love!!!

When I can here it was very empty and it was the smack middle of lunchtime. We looked through the menu and I decided to get the beef schwarma sandwich and upgraded my fries to eggplant fries, and my friend got the combination meat platter. As his side, he choose the salad. The salad was a huge generous portion filled with fresh veggies like tomatoes, bell peppers and Persian cucumbers. So refreshing!  The sauce was delicious as well.   My eggplant fries were bomb. Crispy but soft in the center. And it came with a decadent dipping sauce... Some sort of spicy aioli....A little goes a long way.  The schwarma sandwich was packed, and I mean packed with thick cuts of quality juicy tender beef. Incredibly flavorful and it was a huge generous portion as well.   My friend's meat platter came with a variety of their beef selections. Sorry I don't know any of the names. But it was delicious as well.   I honestly can't wait to come back and try more things!!",

I've eaten here well over 30 times either at lunch in the restaurant or via food delivery for dinner.  The food is always consistent and very well marinated.  The marination is key.  All food items are flavorful.  My favorite item is the chicken kabob plate.  The dinner portions are plentiful.  Ally is a server I see often and she is always pleasant and attentive.    I almost always see the owner in the kitchen working on the cooking.  I imagine he works long hours and provides a lot of oversight which help insures consistent quality.

    "text": "I had the beef shawarma wrap and some ghost pepper hummus with an additional side of veggies for dipping.  The shawarma was an above average rendition but nothing too noteworthy.  The dish comes with a side of fries for free or can be upgraded to specialty fries for about $3 or hummus for an additional upcharge.  The wrap meal came to about $10 before tax.  The main standout was the ghost pepper hummus.  This stuff will put you on your back.  I ordered delivery so maybe that was the reason, but the hummus consistency was a little runny.  Spectacularly spicy but a tiny bit runny.  I still put the spice level up to any hummus I've ever encountered.  Couple that with a fantastic taste, and this stuff is the real deal.  It came with a fine piece of pita and the veggies were large for the $4 price point with inclusions of carrots, green peppers, and cumbers.  If you're a fan of spicy, take a taste with the ghost pepper hummus.  You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "I've eaten here 6 or 7 times now, and I'm officially hooked.  *Perfect* falafel every time - crispy outside and just the right density on the inside. The chef here is a master of the falafel - this is not a simple achievement. One bite and you will be spoiled. The *only* other falafel in town that holds a candle to these are Amena Bakery's - and even so, you would never take a date to Amena. The Hummus Factory is the Total Wine of Mediterranean, and Amena is a downtown liquor store with a much smaller menu and barred windows (not really, but you know what I mean?) I can't think of anything that Amena does that The Hummus Factory can't do better.  Crazy good fresh hot pitas. Like should accompany your last-meal-on-Earth good. If you're going to cheat on your no-carb diet, you might as well do it here with absolutely no regrets.  They've also concocted the *best* Greek salad dressing of all time. And I was never one to be like, \"Hmm, for lunch I'm feeling like a Greek salad...\" But now I totally am. This Greek salad changes everything (see my Yelp photo) and it's a once-a-week choice for me when I'm in town.  All three items I've mentioned (the falafel, pitas, and Greek salad) are best-in-class in Las Vegas, and will set you up for disappointment when you order these things anywhere else. It's happened to me several times in the last month on the East Coast. Even my favorite Mediterranean place in Atlanta (where I lived for 7 years) is no longer good to me.  As a bonus, the current check-in offer with a dinner entree is a complimentary plate of signature hummus - again, a exemplary rendition tastefully garnished with cucumber wedges at 3, 6, 9, and 12. Delicious stuff!",

    "text": "Although limited in my experience with Mediterranean food, I have to go all in for the Hummus Factory with the 5 stars.  Two of us came here to share various items.  The restaurant had few customers at 5 PM on Friday night.  We ordered:  Factory hummus order and pita (free with Yelp check in) Falafel appetizer with fresh vegetables and tahini sauce Meat combination with one beef kabob, one kafta, one sujuk and one kibbi with baba ghanoush (susbstiution of zucchini fries for rice for an upcharge) Gyro sandwich (substitute eggplant fries instead of rice for an upcharge) Baklava Rice pudding Shabiet  I ordered an iced tea also and was brought refills several times without needing to ask.  I also asked if I could sample their ghost pepper sauce that you can get with hummus.  Our server, Nikki, brought a small cup of the sauce and warned me to only dip the pita in a little bit of the sauce.  That's what I did and immediately started hiccuping from the reaction to the heat of the ghost pepper.  I won't be eating that--it is very hot as I guessed it would be.  First off before trying the ghost pepper sauce, we were brought an order of hummus and very hot, house made pita bread.  Both were excellent.  The pita was so light and fluffy in texture.  It was with a small piece of the pita that I tries the ghost pepper sauce.  We also had a small round of butter that was flavorful with the pita.  Next up came the falafel appetizer.  Good falafels with good tasting tahini and a selection of fresh vegetables to go with the falafel.  Next came our two main courses.  One was a gyro sandwich with zucchini fries and one was the meat combination with eggplant fries and an order of baba ghanoush.  Of the fries, the eggplant were better to my taste although the zucchini were good, too.  Good gyro.  The meat combination was very good.  Standout on this dish was the sujuk--spicy sausage.  The spice was perfect for this meat.  We ended our meal with 3 desserts, baklava, rice pudding, and shabiet.  The baklava is much different than I've had before.  There is honey but it's not dripping or swimming in honey.  In addition, it's small in width and shaped like a piece of Kit Kat.  Very tasty and a different way of making it.  The rice pudding was quite creamy and very good and last, the shabiet with its ashta cream was very good.  The shabiet is shaped like a turnover and has this wonderful cream inside.  Part of my five stars also is for the service.  Our factory worker, Nikki, was really a pleasant woman who was quite interesting to speak with and she was always there to refill iced tea or my companion's water glass.  It's quite a story that this brick and mortar restaurant came about after its start as a food truck restaurant.",

When the server brought my meal, she apologized because she forgot to give me the appetizer. Then my food was completely wrong, which probably could have been avoided if she would have wrote down the order. And I had to wait even longer for a refill. I contemplated on even writing a bad review, but the server didn't offer to fix the issues (maybe a free appetizer for the next visit, small discount, or don't charge me for the drink) and this isn't the first time service was subpar. I probably won't be back anytime soon ... or ever for that matter. Such a disappointment because the food is good.",

The facade is homey and everything is clean. The staff was friendly and very accommodating. Now, to the food. The bread/pita: goodness! See, here's the thing, my S.O. has had always this endearing issue that his food must be always hot when it get's to him. Whenever he see  his order, he actually count the minutes on how long it was there on the counter before serving it to him and if it's lukewarm or col to his \"standards\" he will not be happy. And this bread/pita, burned his fingers. He was so happy.  I loved the baba ganoush for my appetizer. Creamy and savory, the perfect pair for the bread. while my S.O. ordered Greek Fries, and goodness was it good and was it plenty. Served in a deep bowl, with feta crumble, it was good hot, crispy and fantastic! The tzatziki, or the cucumber sauce/gyro sauce was a perfect accompaniment for the fries.George, our server, recommended the pink sauce for it, and yes he was spot on. For the main dish, I ordered the Gyro sandwich with egg plant fries. It was fantastic, especially the egg plant fries. Crunchy, light and creamy, amazing. The Gyro sandwich was great as well. Filling but not heavy. My S.O. went for the pretzel sliders which he adored and again was served with an abundant serving of fries.  After about 20 mins, we're so stuffed that we had to have three boxes, which was great for dinner.   i went the second time with my sister, and this girl is in love with their Dolmas and Majadra. Again, I must relieve the craving for the Egg plant fries and pink sauce. Also the Mini Mezza was plenty for a comfortable filling dinner. Definitely, will go here again.",

We ordered two gyro sandwiches and the jalapeno hummus. The major portion difference was the hummus. We received 1/3 of the normal portion, definitely not worth the 9 dollars.

The menu here was explained to me by the wonderful waiter that we had and I ended up ordering the Shawarma sandwich because it sounded yummy and since Robert Downey Jr recommended it in Avengers. As the side option I had zucchini fries with extra feta cheese. The sandwich meat was chicken and was so moist , normally I hate onions and forgot to have them taken off. The way they were cooked into the meat it mixed well with the chicken and I went for it. While I did pull the big pieces of onion out I still ate the sandwich cooked in onion  We also ordered the Greek fries to to try them, but with extra feta and those were great as well. The atmosphere of the restaurant was casual and upbeat. The wait staff was wonderful. I love the take that they do with the food her it is not overtly overwhelming and left us with pleasant after tastes. I would visit again as well .",

I ordered the chicken kabob with rice and homemade hummus. I have always heard how great the hummus is here along with the fresh pita bread.  The restaurant is a nice size and there is also seating at the bar so if you don't feel like a table there is always this option.   I really enjoyed my dinner. The chicken was nice and crispy and the hummus just melted in my mouth. The service was great and I will definitely return here to try more items on the menu.",

So I got on Yelp to get some help from my fellow yelpers.  To my surprise the Hummus Factory had really good reviews. I got there, and loved establishment, really clean place.  I had a conversation with the lady that works there about HOW GOOD IS THE FOOD??! She assured me that their food is the BEST in town.  Well, let me tell you!!! ITS THE BEST IN TOWN!!! By boyfriend is vegan and he LOVES the falafel sandwich.  The hummus & freshly made pita bread is a bonus!!! This is our NEW SPOT here in Nevada!",

As the name suggests, hummus is a must try and  I recommend the jalapeno hummus which isn't overpowering with spice and makes a great appetizer to share.  The eggplant fries are amazing and another must try appetizer to share.  Full of flavor and dusted then fried they are ultra tender and highly addicting after first bite.  The zucchini fries are similar if eggplant is not your thing.  As for entrees I highly recommend the chicken kabob dinner portion which comes with rice, veggies and onions.  Large chicken pieces cooked to perfection with lots of flavor highlight this dish.  Be prepared to take food home as the portions are plentiful and ideal for family style dining!  The ambiance and lighting is great for dates and the music selection is very nice.",

    "text": "We were somewhat dismayed when we looked at the menu, seeing that prices seemed very high compared to other Mediterranean restaurants we frequent.  That evaporated once they brought the food, and we were faced with astronomical portion sizes that would feed us for a second (and in my case third) meal.  We started with the hummus that was free with Yelp check-in:  beautifully presented, along with a basket of warm, puffed pita straight from the oven, and adorned with multiple slices of Persian cucumber.  That's helpful for limiting the amount of bread you need to eat.  Cukes are great for dipping into hummus, and the hummus is made of a combination of fava beans and chickpeas, very authentic.  For our main courses, hubby ordered the chicken kebab, and I decided on something I don't usually order, baked kibbe.  We both had salad for our side dishes, and were served with large bowls with mixed greens, onion, tomatoes, and more of those yummy Persian cukes.  I had my dressing on the side, and it was an unusual mix of oil, lemon, salt, pepper, and mint.  I was so full from the hummus, half a piece of pita, and the salad that I could have stopped there.  But I didn't.  When the plates were brought out, I thought I would faint from the amount of food.  The kebabs had three skewers of chicken, each chock-full of meat, with a spicy-ish sauce basted on top, sitting on enough Lebanese rice to feed a family of four.  I tried the chicken, and it was the best chicken kebab ever.  The star of the presentation was my kibbe.  When I had it at other restaurants years ago, it was always a square of re-warmed stuff cut out of a larger baking dish.  That's probably why I stopped ordering it.  My dish here had three individual gigundo balls of fresh kibbe, surrounding a center of meat, seasonings, and pine nuts, sitting atop an atomic-sized portion of the aforementioned rice, along with a roasted tomato.  Totally different from what I was expecting, and incredibly good.  I had to force myself to finish just one of those balls.  It was a tough job, not because it was bad, but because I was stuffed to the gills.  Service was exceptional from Alida, the owner's sister, and the young woman, also family, whose name I didn't get.  The TVs did NOT have sports playing - YAY!!, and the background music was terrific.  Don't let the prices deter you - the quality is exceptional and the value is definitely worth it.  We started out disgruntled and ended up converted.  We will go back, for sure!!",

To start off the evening, I came in to have dinner with my boyfriend and his family. The service was slow at first but that was completely understandable because there was only one person taking care of the entire restaurant.  They offered a variety of flavors of hummus, which they are known for: original, jalapeno and ghost pepper. The texture was so smooth and creamy. But my favorite part was the warm fluffy bread they served with it. The owner kept coming by to give us more. It was impossible to resist myself from breaking open the warm pita and plowing it in my mouth.  For the main course, I ordered the kafta (ground sirloin mixed with onions, parsley and spices) which reminded me of a koobideh kabab. It was served with a side of rice and onions. While it was flavorful, it wasn't the best kabob I've ever had.   Dessert is what blew my mind. We had the custard filled Shabiet! Served warm, the crunchy layers of pastry flaked and melded perfectly with the creamy custard.   Y'all! This place is deeeelicious. Just sad that it's a trek for me but I'll be sure to drop in again if I'm in the neighborhood.",

The prices were decent compared to other places, which is why I decided to try this place. I ordered the gyro (which comes with fries) and my BF ordered the sujuk (spicy beef sausage) which came with a side (he ordered the tabbuli). As I check into Yelp, a free hummus comes up! Yay!! They gave us fresh pita bread and butter infused with all these fresh herbs. Yum! The tabbuli was fresh and the greens were crispy. The seasoning on the salad was light and delicious. They also have freshly squeezed lemonade, which I should try next time. The gyro was delicious, but not omg good. It's comparable to a lot of other gyros I have tried. The sujuk was juicy and at the end was a kick of spice which I really enjoyed. What I like about this place, are the portion sizes. They are very generous with the portions, the food is great with awesome price points, with amazing service.",

I grew up on Mediterranean food so I know what it should take like.  The food had flashes of brilliance, but sometimes missed the mark. I had the eggplant fries. The coating and texture were show stoppers, but they were underseasoned. I also had the chicken gyro. Chicken was cooked to perfection but, again, the dish, including the tzatziki sauce were underseasoned. Pita bread was wonderful. I think that Maza Mediterranean is a better choice.",

Outside of hummus, there are a number of other tantalizing Lebanese inspired options. For starters, I throughly enjoyed watching the pillows of pita bread as it comes out of the oven. If you're greedy like me, then you can order additional pieces for only 50 cents. The freshness and quality of the ingredients at The Hummus Factory takes center stage. The following is what I ordered:  Factory Hummus (A-) Jalapeno Hummus (A) Crispy Zucchini Fries (D-) Greek Fries (B) Gyro Sandwich (A)  In all fairness, the \"Crispy\" Zucchini Fries, were ordered to go (twice), and I live 15 minutes away from the restaurant. By the time I ate them, they were extremely soggy. Otherwise, everything else  I've tried has been fantastic!",

Server was nice and took care of us in a timely fashion. The food came out relatively quickly.  The owner came out at the end to ask how everything was. Of course, I told her we loved it.

On my most recent visit I had the original hummus and a greek salad with falafel added. I honestly feel like I'm addicted to their hummus. It's always super fresh and I love their thin pita bread. The salad was HUGE and delicious. I probably would drink the salad dressing it was that good. The falafels were tasty too. Not dry at all like some tend to be.

The decor is simply and chic, which I loved. The waitress was a sweetheart, but she dropped an entire cup of water on my dad on accident (out of curtsey, he should have gotten something on the house for that). I don't know how she managed to handle 8+ tables on her own. Literally, she was the only waitress. She did well because we never waited more than we needed for anything such as our food, refills, and the check. Now on to everyone's favorite topic, food:  Hummus: It was simple, I enjoyed the flavor.   Babaganoosh: It was far too lemony  Falafel appetizer: It came as a beautiful  presentation, about 6 pieces in a bowl over some fresh veggies and pickled Arab heaven. However, they did not taste like authentic middle eastern falafels. I'm middle eastern, maybe I'm being too picky.  Kabob dinner: Comes with rice(amazing), salad(too spicy), a piece of corn( did this really have to be spicy too....), and 3 skewers (perfect size, but not my favorite seasoning).  I was just not a fan of seasonings. Everything tasted spicy, lemony, Americanized.  Overall, our experience was nice, and the food was decent. My family and I enjoyed the night.",

I'm from Montreal the Mediterranean capital of food and in general finding anything in Las Vegas that's more than just edible is a difficult challenge. These guys completely re-thought what Mediterranean food should be put a lot of love into their cooking. With tip my order for one person cost me about $40 and I thought it was expensive but I promise that the meal was worth every penny that it cost. As soon as the weather gets a little warmer one of my first stops will be to Have admin dining experience at this place. When I want a good meal in Las Vegas this will be my go to. Thank you for such an amazing meal",

    "text": "3 stars for the service, it was pretty awful! So awful it was funny. We definitely wasn't upset, we were laughing at the fact, but I have to grade appropriately or else I'd be lying. Our server forgot our utensils for half the meal, so we ate non finger food with our hands, received our pita bread at the end of our meal even after asking for it twice, asked if we wanted to order when we didn't even have menus! It was pretty hilarious. We can't fault her too much, she was so sweet. God bless her sweet soul! Again, not upset, just definitely could've used some improvement and you cannot bypass service like that when it's one mistake after another!   Other than the above, the chicken shawarma plate was a 5 Star across the board! Outstanding flavor that leaves you forking for more. I didn't take my time with it because when it's that good, the end result will be annihilation by mouth hands down!   Grape leaves were sadly sent back. I have a yearning for dolmadas and these were not making the cut.   It's called the Hummus Factory, so best believe the hummus was good! You can't have hummus in your name if the hummus isn't good right?! That would just be over reaching! The hummus delivered to its name!   Most importantly, yes I would come back and yes I would recommend to yelpers everywhere. How does one even fairly rate a place like this! 5 Star food (except the dolmadas) sweet service but awful service at the same time! I feel bad but the yelp is final.",

    "text": "Made the trek from the Eastside to try the Hummus Factory since I had heard great things about it and boy, did it deliver.  The service was great, restaurant was clean and cozy. We used the Yelp checkin offer for the free hummus and now I'll never look at my store bought Sabra hummus the same way again. This hummus was so smooth and creamy, I've been dreaming about it since my visit. The hummus was served up with warm pita bread, fresh from the oven, and a perfect accompaniment. I've never seen pita the way they present it here: puffed up. It was eye catching.  We also tried some of the traditional Lebanese fare from the entree menu: kafta, frarej, and dolmas. All were delicious, except maybe too citrusy from all the lemon they use in the cooking, especially in the frarej. It was hard to focus on any other flavors that might have been present because their was so much lemon. For dessert, we tried the shabiet and rice pudding. The shabiet was pretty good, but if you're thinking a bout the rice pudding, just be warned that it's prepared with rose water and if you're not used to floral tastes, it might be too strong for you.  Overall, I was impressed and would definitely dine here again in the future.",

I have been here twice now (once for lunch, and once for dinner), and had wonderful experiences.  As for the food itself, portions are definitely generous, and the prices are fair. The freshly-baked hot bread is one of the highlights for sure!  The flavors of all the food are great, and it is clear that a lot of care and passion goes into cooking this food. Most of the menu offerings are Mediterranean cuisine, and I believe primarily Lebanese in origin.  They have a lot of unique fries (I love the eggplant and zucchini fries), and the jalapeno hummus packed quite some heat!  I highly recommend The Hummus Factory, would go more often if it weren't so far from my house!",

Why four stars? It's hard for my step-daughter to eat here as she can not tolerate the spices used in Mediterranean food. So this makes it difficult as a choice for the family to eat at. Also, if you come to the location mid-afternoon (around 4) the restaurant is uncomfortably hot. I was informed by staff the kitchen overheats and it's hard to cool down the dining area.",

THE GOOD: It was delicious, i was sad to share it with my two friends because even my one friend who was not a hummus fan was found scrapping the plate!  we had the lentils, the fatoosh which were good, but the DISAPPOINTMENTS: because nobody's perfect, my friend ordered the chicken sandwich which was described as pressed but came out on a large roll and it was too much breading, also the grape leaves were over flavored. But you know when you walk into a place and you smell the food you know its gonna be good? that's here, can't wait to go back and try some more.",

    "text": "Their reputation precedes them with their food truck so I had to try it when they opened their restaurant at a former deli.  I've been to both dinner and lunch service, and was equally impressed with the food and service both times.  Pita bread is served pillowy and when punctured, it lets  out a puff of steam. Paired with the Factory Hummus,  it's even better.  The falafel appetizer is generously portioned and perfectly crisp. The veggies underneath offset the density that falafel can sometimes have. I had the beef schwarma sandwich. Once there was a tad too much tahini, but I scraped the excess away to make it better. The kafta is evenly seasoned and was mild enough for my son to eat too.  If I had to find fault with one thing, they plate so much vegetables - lettuce, cucumbers, etc. - on most of their dishes, that I feel like they could save some money giving a little less. I love my veggies, but i don't think their customers would notice or mind if they held back a little.  Our lunch waiter was extremely attentive but not hovering. Dinner was served by Niki (owner) and her daughter. Again, they were attentive and wonderful conversationalists.   Can't say how great it is to have a family-owned restaurant to keep going back to in the neighborhood.",

I wasn't too hungry so I settled for the shrimp scampi appetizer. I thought it was going to be small but it was huge for an appetizer. I loved the flavors it was very zesty and it came with rice all for $9.95. The service was also as great as their food. We will be back to try their lunch specials!",

We got free Factory hummus with fluffy, hot, the best pita bread I have ever tried. Unlike other Mediterranean places where they gonna give you pita that you can buy in Walmart and heat it up this pita bread looked like homemade.  Since I'm a big salad lover I ordered Fatoosh without any meat just greens.  It was super delicious. A lot of flavors, well seasoned I loved pieces of Lebanese bread in it which wen great with those hummus leftovers we had - not a lot may I say.  I had a few bites of eggplant fries from my companions plate - Yum! We were offered with desert and Lebanese coffee (which I highly recommend to any coffee lover). Check out this place I loved it!",

I had enough hummus to take home.  Service was quick and server was very polite and nice.  Would for sure visit again!",

You can easily feel all the time and care that went into building the new Hummus Factory. Watched all the food come out from the open kitchen and the portions are huge with gorgeous plating and everything smells amazing. I know where I'll be taking my family for lunch next time!

We split a kabob combo meal of chicken and steak with a factory salad.  The salad would've been good had it not had a ton of thyme or some other herb, making it almost inedible.  The steak was overcooked and chicken was overwhelmingly seasoned with a mustard type seasoning.  The rice it was sitting on was also tart and terribly over seasoned.  We didn't finish our meals and no one inquired as to why when we said we wouldn't like a to go box.  I wanted to tell the server all this, but he didn't hang around long enough to even pull aside.",

    "text": "I'm more than a little puzzled that yet another Mediterranean restaurant has located itself in an area that is already loaded with them. The Hummus Factory, Hedary, Paymons, Zaytoon, Maza, and some others are located within the same general area, in some cases within a few blocks of each other. The Hummus factory menu is very similar to Hedary, so I ordered what I often get at Hedary:  Kafta skewers and lentil soup.  I have no complaints about what I got. It was good, but it wasn't as good as Hedary. The rice was OK but not as good as Hedary's (which is excellent). The pita bread, too, was good and fresh, but not as good as Hedary. Hedary is just a couple of blocks away from Hummus Factory, so I'll go there. To respond to owner's comment: I agree with your reference to Chinatown, so maybe the congregation of Mediterranean restaurants is a similar concept. However, regardless of the origination of the recipes, if you choose to locate your restaurant a few blocks from Hedary's, and maintain a similar menu, you should expect your restaurant to be compared directly to Hedary's. Even though I liked your food (3 stars), I do not think it equaled Hedary's.",

This restaurant is the product of previously being a food truck! So, I checked in and got the house factory hummus for free, it was delicious.  Then, I ordered the jalapeno hummus was good with a hit of jalapeno not spicy but very tasty...I like the original better!  Next I will try the habanero, scorpion, and ghost pepper hummus.  We ordered the Greek salad which can easily feed 4 people. It was fresh, tasty and definitely deserves a return trip.  We also ordered the veggie shawarma plate that was too much for to people, we left with leftovers.  I highly suggest ordering multiple items and share with a group. Throughout our visit there were a lot of people who order to go, so if you don't have the time, just call it in.  I WILL be going back to this great place.",

Chicken had good flavor and was not chewy. The filet needed flavor and to be a bit less cooked. Not chewy which was good.  The lentil soup was missing a bit more spices to flavor it.   Overall I would definitely give it another try in the future.",

The dressing had a hint of sweetness I could have done without but not a deal breaker. From phone to pickup everyone was very polite, informative,prompt & correct on entire order.

    "text": "Me + The Hummus Factory = Love at First Taste.  My significant other and I had seen the Hummus Factory advertised on Instagram decided to give a try.  Upon arrival, the restaurant was quite empty but very clean.  I'm a stickler for using real utensils, plates, glasses, and napkins and The Hummus Factory did not disappoint!  The young lady who seated us was tremendously helpful, friendly, and thankful for our business.  She helped us as we ordered, offering suggestions on great dishes to try, as well as ways we could include add-ons etc.    We started with complimentary Pita Bread, which ended up being my absolute favorite thing there.  It was WARM, FRESH, and the smell brought me right back to my grandmother's kitchen.  The herb spread that came with it was out of this world.    We chose the Factory Hummus for our appetizer.  I'm not a huge hummus fan but my significant other talked me into it -- it did NOT disappoint!  If all hummus was like this hummus, I would be a hummus fiend!    For our main meals, I ended up ordering a Gyro Sandwich (amazing flavor!) and my significant other ordered the Chicken Kabobs (scrumptious!).  The Chicken Kabobs came with a side salad, which was so good I actually took over eating it for my significant other lol.    The portions were HUGE and our eyes were larger than our stomachs that day, which meant we had seconds for lunch the next day (#winning).  Aside from the great food, service was amazing.  It was refreshing to go to a restaurant where the employees seemed to genuinely care about the patrons.    I would recommend the Hummus Factory to anyone looking for a pleasant dining experience that involves tantalizing food.",

You can taste the difference with fresh ingredients and people who love making food to savor and never want to end.  The hummus was mild and creamy.  I usually don't like cucumbers but their cucumber salad was wonderful!! Feta and olives were great.    We both had the falafel sandwich.  While I wasn't a huge fan of the kimchi, the falafel was perfect.  I opted for the zucchini fries which were a great upgrade option and well worth it.  Many places use frozen fries but these are made fresh with a light batter and great dipping sauce.  While I was gorged from the meal our server recommended a baked custard in puff pastry.  OMG it was beyond incredible.  Sprinkled with pistachios and honey it was light and just the amount of sweetness.  Service was also very good.  Very friendly and attentive - quick refills and great recommendations.",

We knew the food would be good but it was great. The portions were generous and reasonably priced.   We started with the Halloum Cheese, delicious.   For mains, I had the meat combo. The kabob was perfectly cooked but the kafta and kibbi were the stand outs. The kafta had great flavor and was slightly spicy, just spicy enough to make your eyes water a little and keep you wanting more.  The kibbi, oh my. My wife is middle eastern and I have to say, this is the best I have ever had. (Sorry to my mother in law, good thing she doesn't read this stuff) The flavors were amazing. Perfectly seasoned. Nice and crispy on the outside..mmmmm  My wife had the falafal and she said it was good, I had one and thought the same.   We will definitely be back!",

I gave it a 4, because what we ordered was tasty, though the servings to price ratio would make it a bit pricey. It's a Friday and we ordered a platter with different meats which was suppose to include filet mignon, but they ran out. It's Friday for lunch and you ran out of the filet mignon, I'm thinking, what are you going to do for dinner service....not good.

    "text": "I have not visited this establishment in person. This review is based on a delivery order.  I don't know my way around Mediterranean cuisine. I'll have some flatbread and hummus for an afternoon snack occasionally, and I'll use feta cheese in a salad or on pizza sometimes. But the last time I had falafel, I think was 11 or 12, and my Hebrew school teacher brought some to our class to try. It was very dry and nearly tasteless.  I ordered the mini Mezza tapas plate. It's six items chosen from a substantial list of appetizers. I thought this was a great way to sample some of the menu without spending a paycheck. They also offer a Mezza plate, and you can choose twelve items from the list, but there's only two of us.  Everything was delicious. Everything (except for the crudites) had a bit of a kick, but not so much that it offended my aging tastebuds.   I ordered falafel (face my fears, right?), which was very crunchy on the outside, but surprisingly moist and tender on the inside, and what I assume was tzaziki made an excellent dip. I would prefer patties instead of balls, but that's just my thing.   The stuffed grape leaves were perfectly spiced, and delicious  cold or warmed.   If you're going out on a date later in the day, do NOT order the hummus! Definitely order it if you're on a date though. You'll both be stinky and happy! There's more garlic in it than in the entire town of Gilford (the worlds garlic capital). If they added even more, it wouldn't bother me; I love garlic. It is pretty powerful though!  The Greek salad was pretty standard: romaine, tomato, feta, and a balsamic vinaigrette dressing. It was very good, and a bit spicy too, but otherwise not particularly remarkable.  The \"Mediterranean garlic bread\" was a Greek flatbread with melted cheese. It looked very dry and crunchy, but was surprisingly supple.  The crudites were crudites. The carrots could have been a bit more slender.  This was a great sampler, and I'm looking forward to trying some of the full plates on the menu. I can hardly wait to try the different shawarmas and kabobs.   If you order delivery from GrubHub, there's no minimum and no delivery fee (although you are kinda forced into tipping the driver). Don't hesitate to choose this establishment when ordering delivery!",

    "text": "Items Selected: Housemade Pita with Herb Butter Factory Hummus - Garbanzo Beans, Lemon Juice, Garlic, Sesame and Olive Oil Baba Ganoosh - Smoked Egglplant, Garlic, Tahini, Lemon Juice Falafil - Cucumbers, Olives, Tomatoes, Tahini, Housemade Pickles Ghost Pepper Puree Gyro with Zucchini Fries and Pink Sauce Combination Plate - Beef Kabob, Kafta, Sujuk, Kibbi with Eggplant Fries and Pink Sauce Baklava - Filo Pastry, Walnuts, Sugar, Sweet Butter Shabiet - Filo Pastry, Milk Custard, Honey, Crushed Pistachios Rice Pudding - Rosewater and Pistachio  Located on West Sahara Avenue, an area that seems to be growing by leaps and bounds with Eatt and Paradise India recently showing signs of life, The Hummus Factory from Tony Tabet represents the first Brick and Mortar location for a former Food Truck that gathered fans by way of delivering healthy Mediterranean fusion in a scene typically dominated by fried fare, tacos and burgers with odd toppings.  Bearing no association to Hummus Factory's elsewhere, the restaurant owned by Tabet and his wife's only \"relation\" being that the Chef's Aunt brought Khoury's Mediterranean to Las Vegas several years ago, The Hummus Factory occupies a lengthy space just West of Buffalo Drive and with seating for a tepproximately eighty stretching backward from a foyer flanked by a bar that displays the open kitchen the restaurant takes on a sort of non-descript feel that does little to convey its ethnicity by way of several pieces of art designed by the owners themselves, the music a bit more appropriate to the style of the menu, though at times the chants or singing do become a touch too loud.  Serving large portions across the menu, Mrs. Tabet acting as Maitre D' and waitress explaining that the goal was to feed people as it is done back home, prices trend  higher than most of the Valley's Mediterranean options in part due to the fact that almost everything offered is meant for sharing, the ability to order samplers and substitutions a welcome addition for those who do not wish to fill up on rice with the average cost for a meal-for-two probably somewhere in the range of fifty dollars.  Dining as a duo with a goal to sample widely from sections ranging from dips and salads to sandwiches and entrees, it was with a few questions asked that the order was settled, a substantial three-course tasting comprised of approximately nine items with an all-in cost of just under $90.  Beginning with house-made Pita, certainly one of the best in the city with four fluffy puffs per basket, round one consisted of the restaurant's eponymous dish that offers a creamy base with light herbs gently slicked in Olive Oil with an underlying bit of Citrus, the oddly spelled \"Falafil\" appetizer getting away from the neon green hues of some with a dense nuttiness that plays well off Tahini and housemade Pickles, the Baba Ganoosh another great flavor that does wonders for anything it is spread on by adding its satin texture as well as a touch of smoke.  Chuckling at the ridiculousness of Ghost Peppers, perhaps 1/8tsp causing a spontaneous cough and hiccupping fit from one at the table, it was with palates ready that more meaty options arrived for round two of the evening, the Gyro relatively standard fare flanked by gently fried slices of Zucchini (a $2.95 addition) that paired well with the sweet n' savory \"Pink Sauce,\" while the Combination Plate was a far more fulfilling option highlighted by Spicy Sujuk and reference standard Kibbi alongside Eggplant fries that will leave all but the most strong-willed picking at them until the pile is reduced to nothing.  Offering three desserts, each charged $6.95 with everything, again, made in-house, The Hummus Factory's Baklava is quite different from the standard in that each of the five fingers is only lightly touched in sweetness and thus extremely crunchy with a focus on the Walnuts and strips of Phyllo, a more traditional Rice Pudding dialing up savory notes with Rosewater and Cinnamon playing off Pistachios while the warm Shabiet happily steals the spotlight by way of creamy Custard tucked inside layers of crisp Pastry beneath a veil of Nuts and Honey.  ****Priced a bit steeply for what it is, though taking the time to do everything from scratch no doubt warrants a premium for labor as well as skill, The Hummus Factory proves that the transition from Truck to Restaurant remains as possible as ever in the current restaurant climate, though the space itself could still use a bit of work before it feels like it has a True identity while dishes better suited for solo diners would be welcomed as well.",

Given the plethora of great Mediterranean restaurants in town, I give this one a pass.(3 starred review).  I feel bad about this review. I really wanted to like this place - the server and hostess are super nice and the ambience is clean and well kept. The problem rests with the execution of  the dishes. To be fair this place is supposed to be Mediterranean fusion so I don't now if the below comments are intentional or not.  We ordered the hummus (free with Yelp check in at time of review) which comes with freshly made pita bread, the chicken shawarma plate and the gyros sandwich plate with zucchini fries upgrade.  The hummus and pita are both good and a definite order if you go. The pita is lighter, fluffier version and served piping hot as it ought to be. The side salad that came with the chicken shawarma plate was very generous and fresh.  The entrees did not fare so well. Both proteins lacked caramelization. It was fairly obvious that the chicken shawarma was not roasted on a spit/oven in a traditional manner as it was pale and watery. I suppose it was like this when it was served seemingly sauteed with onions and tomatoes. Very strange and not what I expected when I order shawarma.   The hub's gyros has the same problem with the meat lacking the roasted flavor. His sandwich also had huge hunks (not slices) of tomatoes in it which overwhelms the meat in the sandwich.  (Oddly all the tomatoes used in our dishes were cut the same way.)  Zucchini fries were cut in a haphazard fashion leading to inconsistencies in texture (some were soggy) and uneven breading. Not worth the upgrade.  Although the service was good, the execution of the food is not worth a return visit. That being said, if you were to visit this restaurant, try to go for lunch as their prices are a little better than for dinner. 3 starred review",

    "text": "Upon being seated, I told the server that I had a yelp check-in for hummus and she came back 3 mins later to tell me they were out of hummus. I said \"you're out of hummus at the hummus factory?\" - totally meant to be funny and sarcastic, but she felt so terrible about it. She told me she'd remember me for next time since I already put down that I used the free hummus coupon. Next thing you know the chef/owner comes out to let us know he can make hummus for us, but it will take about 10 mins. 10 mins later he brings it to us and apologizes that it would taste better if it was refrigerated (allowing the flavors to marinate as the hummus cools).   Honestly, it is one of the best hummus I've ever had. It tasted fresh (obviously) and it was delicious and creamy. I'd recommend their hummus to everyone. Homemade hummus is the best hummus.   Their pita - so delicious, chewy and really fresh. I love pita and always find Mediterranean restaurants use packaged pita or day old pita and it always leaves my mouth feeling dry. Their pita is served with their house-made butter which is very herbaceous. A+.  Their chicken shawarma - it really actually tasted like chicken fajita. Don't get me wrong, I love fajita so I really didn't mind, but I honestly wouldn't call that shawarma to be honest. It was still delicious though! Just wish it had more Mediterranean spices.  Their fried zucchini - could use some time in the oven. Some of it came to us pretty soggy, but the breading was delicious. Their aioli was really good as well!  Their baba ganoush - nice tartness to it. I loved the taste and the portion was pretty good! It tasted good with the fries.  I ordered their chicken shawarma plate and got fries (+$1.95) instead of their rice. The fries worked well with the hummus. I wish I had garlic sauce. That would have been top notch.   Overall, service was good. I hope they don't become like other restaurants around here that lose sight of what's important. I will be frequenting this place and am excited about it!",

The kabobs were cooked well and had a nice amount of seasoning on it. All the herbs blended into a nice taste. The shawarma was good according to my girlfriend and it came with zucchini fries. GET THE ZUCCHINI FRIES!!! It just melts in your mouth. Hands down my favorite thing there now.   As far as pricing it's within the $10-$18 price range and you get a good sized portion. Lunch and dinner prices differ so watch for that.  The lady who served us was very friendly and maintained amazing service the whole time. Wish we remembered her name, but she was a nice Asian lady. Overall this place was a good spot to eat and we will be back again for sure.",

    "text": "THE Best Mediterranean with a twist food I have ever tasted! I mean do you think it's obsessive that we have eaten here 4 times with 1 time take away? Maybe that's not a lot to you, but I am talking 5 times in 3 weeks. shrimp scampi... the bomb, Greek fries delicious, vegetarian dolmades perfect little finger food! And the ghost pepper hummus, so good that I used the small amount that wasn't noshed, in a vinaigrette dressing for my salad the next day. The puffed up, fresh out of the oven pita... Ahh the smell is divine. Lebanese coffee and desserts sooo good, I have to plan my meal around making a little room for the goodies. All the food we have tried is exploding with flavor.  The atmosphere is so chill I feel completely relaxed from the outside world. I think it's my new happy place!  The staff is very sweet and the chef usually comes out and delivers food to the table, last time he hooked me up with perfectly sweetened Lebanese coffee. Nothing is better than feeling the love and care in the food your eating.",

    "text": "Love this place so glad I don't have to stalk them around town and even better they opened 1 block from where I work on Mondays so I go frequently. Portions have always been huge always need a to go box. Tried the pretzel sliders, factory burger, chicken kabobs and regular hummus all SOOOOO good. I have wanted to upgrade and try both of the other types of fries but I always end up spending the extra $$ on hummus and pita bread because I feel empty without it. Restaurant is nice and clean. I usually go during less busy times so I haven't had long waits. Waitresses have been very nice every time. Service always good first time there they were out of pretzel bread so they nicely came over and let me know and apologized which is all I ask for no biggie I had like a list of things I needed to try so I moved on to the next one. Great place! Hope it succeeds.",

All super good. Had a side order of baba ganoush which was lovely. I tasted the hummus which is light and very creamy. Pita bread came to the table puffed, warm and delicious.  We were a party of 15 people which they handled beautifully. It is a new restaurant in business for 3 weeks, Go there for wonderful Lebanese food.",
