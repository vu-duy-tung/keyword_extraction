    "text": "First time here and it was surprisingly what we were looking for, for tonight's dinner.  A couple of suggestions though.  The starters were definitely not what I was expecting.  We had the crispy octopus and 1/2 a dozen oysters (west coast).  The oysters had so much shells from shucking that I was scared to have more than 1.  Sauces cost extra so just be aware.  The crispy octopus was a little bit my taste; but there was something in it that I bit into that had this disgusting bitter taste and killed the whole plate for me.  Again this may just be a one time thing so please don't be afraid to try those dishes because they are phenomenal.  Now let's get to the good part of this review.  Being that I'm Cambodian I had to try the Jerk Chicken because the dish came with papaya salad and my family always love to try new styles of papaya salad.  OH MY GOODNESS.  It was AMAZING.  I have nothing bad to say.  The tenderness of the chicken and the spice from the papaya salad made me feel like I was eating my grandma's cooking and we all know grandma's cooking is the best.  My friend had the salmon which is another must try.  I only had a few bites so I wouldn't be able to tell you what the full flavor profile of the plate was; but I can tell you that we almost licked our plate clean.  Service was amazing.  She was attentive and kind and gave us enough space to enjoy our dinner without feeling like she was on us.  Great job with this one.  Definitely coming back for more!",

My boyfriend and I absolutely love oysters on the half shell so when my coworker said they had an oyster happy hour I knew we had to go. We started the meal with the ahi tuna tartare. The tuna was seasoned perfectly with citrus and spice and having never had a sushi rice crisp, we were highly impressed. Next was happy hour. The oysters are phenomenal! Very fresh, clean (no sand and hardly any shell at all, which comes with the territory), and perfect size. I prefer smaller oysters so these being petite made them even better. Rich, our waiter, was amazing. He checked on us often, explained the menu and drinks well, placed our orders quickly so we would be able to get the oysters in the frenzy of happy hour, and just had an all around great personality! Definitely recommended to anyone that loves seafood. We will be coming back for sure! Next to try is the chocolate tres leches dessert.",

We randomly stopped in and lucked up on happy hour, it was decent $5 wines $1 oysters and I think they had a beer special. I think they should expand on the happy hour though maybe offer all house wines as they only had a cab, Pinot Grigio, rose and a sparkling and maybe add well drinks and possibly discounted appetizers, anyway the food was good the oysters were so so but we didn't expect to much for $1 I could have passed on the bed of salt the oysters were sitting on as the oysters already had a naturally salty flavor which I wasn't sure how I felt about but the bed of salt made me feel like I needed to get my blood pressure checked afterwards lol. All the food has an Asian flare which offers very interesting flavor combinations. We went all in and tried most of the appetizers on the menu the tuna was my favorite the rolls were my hubbys fave. The place is fairly new and could use some tweaking but overall we had a great experience and will definitely be returning.",

    "text": "Favorite eatery on the block!  Literally, this place is located right behind my condominium complex and I couldn't be more ecstatic every time I have an excuse to go. Which, is basically when any of my friends come in from out of town.  It's a little bit on the pricier side, but for what you get, it is well worth it. It's a restaurant you'd expect to see in one of the hotels on the strip, so it does come with the strip mentality price tag. However, their happy hour serves up fine dining food for half the cost! $1 oysters make me HOLLLAAA!!! Plus, if you're \"boujee\" like me, you love to feel fancier than you really are. Like I said, I live next door; so instead of a limo, I get to walk my happy butt there.  Boujee (definition found on Urban Dictionary):  High class, flossin', ballin'. One who possesses swag. Elite, rich.  First course, I highly recommend trying their Vietnamese Imperial Rolls or their Bao Sliders... or just say screw it and get both! Both accommodate to completely different taste palates. Every time you bite into one of the crispy, flaky rolls it tastes like you are skipping through a meadow of goodness. As for the sliders, every time you bite into these little, doughy stacks, it makes you feel like you're in a Sir Mix-A-Lot music video and will have you looking at your server when they ask if you are done saying, \"Unless you got buns, hun.\"  Second course (yes, this is a three course kinda restaurant, bare with me), their menu is ever-changing, but so far my favorite has been the Grilled Verlasso Salmon that comes served in a clay pot. Once you take the top off and the piping hot steam hits your face, you'll think you were at a spa retreat. If only you could get a facial and the best meal of your life at the same time. Someone look into opening a place like that, and remember to give me a shoutout on Yelp!  Third and final course, is dessert. Now I'm not much of a chocolate person (yes, you read that right), but their Chocolate Tres Leches is to die for. I am a huge sucker for mint anything and I think that the mint pairs perfectly with the dish making it a light dessert after having two courses prior. Cause we all know we always think we have room for dessert but never do once it comes out and is placed in front of us. The hardened chocolate on top kinda looks like a birds nest. But don't let it fool you into thinking you're going to eat it like a bird... Nope, you'll be scraping your spoon across the plate to get every last bit of the vanilla whipped cream.",

Combining the polenta with the Asian pear and the short rib in one bite gave the perfect amount of creaminess to go with the intense flavors of the meat. I'd order this every time.  The clay pot salmon is also very good - some people said it was kind of bland, but I couldn't agree with them here. The salmon is well seasoned and the sauce that sits below the farro mixes well. I'm not a huge fan of farro - it reminds me of barley, but it worked well with the rustic nature of the dish.  Dollar oysters for happy hour is an excellent value, though I can't say my oysters were shucked particularly well. A couple little pieces of shell managed to make it in there and some of the oysters didn't have much brine left over. Still, the oysters tasted fresh and were quite creamy.  We also tried the fried beef crisps which were kind of like pork rinds to me. While relatively plain in flavor, the sauce they drizzle over it is an excellent accompaniment and brought the dish together.  Dessert was their chocolate tres leches - a very tasty tres leches, but was honestly lacking in the chocolate flavor that I was looking for. Don't get me wrong, the milk flavor is beautiful but the chocolate aspect of it seemed to be a little bit lost if it wasn't for the chocolate crisp topping.  Our server was quite attentive and answered all our questions with a lot of honesty, which I appreciate. He swayed us towards a couple choices and his recommendations were spot on. The only thing I might say is he almost over-hyped some of the stuff so our expectations were possibly too high (mainly for dessert). But he was spot on about the short rib!",

Vietnamese spring rolls with a nice kick and fresh endive lettuce was great. Bao sliders on point but could have used a bit more aioli. Flank steak was perfection on the cook and staff were great explaining everything that we ordered and service was super  Will be back again!",

We were seated immediately and our sever, Hunter, came over immediately to greet us and let us know that there was only a few minutes left for happy hour. For appetizer: we ate the Bao Sliders, albeit small portion size, very good. For dinner: we enjoyed the short rib and the chicken curry. Both really yummy. The polenta on my short rib was sooo good. We also ordered the rocky road for desert which was ok.  Overall great value and we will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I think that one would like this place if they like heavier food. I tried this place a second time and I'm still not impressed. I ordered the burrata and asparagus salad with grapefruit... it was good but it could have had a lighter citrus dressing instead of a creamy dressing which I think took away from it. I also ordered octopus appetizer. The problem is it was way spicy. My friend who was there with me and loves spicy food said it was even too spicy for her. Just not good. She ordered the pork belly for the entree and she liked it. The last time she got the braised short ribs and she liked that too. I tend to like food on the lighter and healthier side so pork belly and short ribs are not attractive to me. I ordered the salmon. It was on top of a bed of sweet quinoa or something similar. The salmon was under seasoned. Had it not been for what was under it, it would have been extremely bland. We did not order dessert. We got there at 5 PM and they told us they had happy hour from 5 to 6 PM which only consisted of oysters and only certain types of wine ($5/glass), specifically three types. I ordered the syrah wine ( a glass) and it was not that great with very little smooth finish. My friend ordered the white blend wine and she said it was OK. I have now been there twice and can say with confidence that I will not be returning. There are many people that love this place. If you love healthy and light foods, this is not the place for you. The service is friendly and the prices are reasonable.",

The food was creative and delicious and the service was very good and both exceeded my expectations. I just moved to Vegas and have been a bit disappointed in the quality of some of the food I've been trying at restaurants (off the Strip that is), so was really pleasantly surprised with this place.

    "text": "Wow!!! This place is AMAZING. Honestly, I didn't take any pictures of the beautiful presentation, because I was too busy drinking and eating...barely breathing in between.   This place is small, so I highly recommend making a reservation. With that said, because it is small, the atmosphere is lovely. Intimate and welcoming; perfect for date night!   The cocktails...if you are looking for a delicious drink with a spin, then this is the place for you. I ordered the Mr. Brownstone. Bourbon and ginger with herbs. They put a simple syrup infused ice cube, and slightly melt the cube with a torch before pouring in the bourbon. As the cube melts, the cocktail flavor becomes more delicious. It was fantastic!   For an appetizer, we ordered the beef crisps. Holy the cow, these are like pork rinds but a million times better. They put a garlic and citrus oil to finish, and it's just a flavor explosion of joy. I could have eaten about a 5lb bag of these, if that was an option!   I ordered the short ribs with the polenta for the main course and my husband got the chicken curry. Both were extremely flavorful and beautifully presented. Short ribs are beyond melt in your mouth, and just fall apart. Served with some sort of marinated pear and greens. I literally cleaned my plate. The chicken curry comes with veggies and lentils. It's a little spicy, but absolutely delicious. I'm not a fan of spicy, but stole a few bites and it was tolerable even for me. The taste is just so good, you will not even feel the spice.   We didn't have dessert since we had other plans, but I definitely would have liked to try some. I've seen others complain that the portions here are small, but I disagree. The portions are perfect! Not too small and not too big. You can eat all of the food and not feel stuffed. Just perfectly satisfied and you'll even have room for dessert. I think this is great, because who wants to feel beyond full on a date night?   Aside from all of this, they apparently change the menu seasonally. I think that is awesome! 100% this is my new date night spot. I will be going back regularly.",

The host was very pleasant, and offered us a seat at the bar.  The bartender not only made amazing cocktails, but was a great server as well.   From the Blonde Negroni to the Vietnamese-coffee-chocolate-dulce del leche cake (seriously!), and the fabulous entrees in between, this little gem didn't disappoint.  The short rib with polenta and poached pears in white AND red wine, and the salmon with forbidden rice were exceptional.    It's located in a strip mall with several other restaurants, and random businesses, so you won't get the glitz and glam - or the crowds, thank goodness - of the strip.  But that's a good thing!  So take a break from the overpriced buffets, and make your way across town...after you make a reservation. :)",

We were greeted by a friendly hostess & was sat right away. Menu had a great wine selection to choose from & we both enjoyed a class of red wine. My favorite appetizer was the octopus in a curry sauce that was so good I was dipping my sons kid meal fries in it & the pork skin with garlic sauce was AMAZING! We actually ordered two plates of it because it was so yummy! The American/ Vietnamese twist in the dishes were authentic (knowing b/c I am half Vietnamese & my mom cooks that type of food a lot) it was hard to narrow down our entree choice. I had the short ribs with veggies & gnocchi  which were delicious & my husband had he trip too dish & he left none to bring home. We will defiantly be going back very soon for another date night!",

Great music and vibe throughout the whole place . We were there for the tail end of happy hour so we ordered a dozen of oysters for a dollar a piece . They were decent , I've had better and worse . I paired it with the champagne they had on the happy hour menu which was very good .  We decided to start dinner with a salad to split . We ordered the beet salad because beets and goat cheese ... amazing ! The only problem was it was about 6 solid bites of food . Hardly enough for one person. Okay , so we order a 2nd appetizer . We went with the spring rolls. Beautiful presentation and taste was on point . But again , tiny portion . It was like they took one spring roll and sliced it thinly into fours.  Dinner was better on portions . Hubby had the trout and I tried the curry chicken, both were good . Our waitress was really knowledgeable and service was on point . There just wasn't anything that I would really want to come back for . Maybe a drink at the bar for HH.",

My server, Shepherd, was excellent and made some great suggestions from the menu, although I think I couldn't go wrong with any item  I would have ordered. The food was delicious from the spicy fried octopus appetizer, the pork belly noodles for the main course entre to coffee and Vietnamese tres leches cake for dessert! The ambience was cozy and warm! I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone if you want to have a wonderful, delicious dining experience! I will be back for sure!  Dr. Les K (full time dentist, part time foodie)",

That's all their serving at the time being which was kinda of a plus for me! For the most part, every restaurant showcases their prime dishes this week so I knew it was a no brainer! First coarse was a Grilled Summer Peach Salad with pine nuts for crunch and a beautiful Smokey char from the sweet peaches and a peach vinaigrette! Next I chose the braised short ribs that I'm a total sucker for and I couldn't of chosen a better entree!! Red and golden beats with a horseradish risotto which was very subtle(good thing), short ribs that you can eat with a spoon yet still have a slight firm texture to them! Dessert was a Lychee Cheesecake with a strawberry compote and micro mint for garnish. Cake was dense and moist but still had a slight crunch from the crust!!  Get here while you can, especially this week!! You will not be disappointing",

We started with cocktails, and I had Killing Me Softly which I enjoyed.  We ordered Imperial Rolls and Grilled Octopus for appetizers.  The octopus is spicy but that's relative since I don't like really spicy food.  The others in my group liked the spice.  My entree was duck confit with couscous.  The couscous was flavored with curry and complemented the duck really well. My son ordered the trout.  Sometimes with fish, it can be overcooked and dry, but my son said it was great and not dry at all.  He said he would order it again.  My husband ordered the scallops and said they were cooked perfectly--seared and nice and tender.",

I paired my oysters with a cucumber martini & a Kentucky mule. I personally loved the Kentucky mule better than the martini. I got 24 oysters and tried the pork belly dish as well which was tasty. The sliders were also delicious. It had a thai tasting sauce to it and came with glass noodles. The bartender Max was super fun to talk to and very easy going. Can't believe I just discovered this place, will definitely be back!",

Dress style ranged from casual to comfort-chic The drinks are incredible. Tried the Johnny Appleseed which seemed quite special and unique.  The appetizers we got were viatnamese rolls and the Ahi tuna. Unfortunately the Ahi tuna came out a bit later than the folks for appetizers but I believe it was purposefully done to Allow us to finish our first dish. I got the beet salad for dinner and I absolutely loved if! So elegantly done and such well balanced flavors I could eat it endlessly. Dessert was completed by tres leches which could never let me down. Once again elegantly made and tasted incredible!",

The short operating hours were the only downside, as we are night owls - foreals. Also, it was super packed since I guess there was a party. This location does not seem to be ideal for large parties of 10-15+ people because of how squished everyone can be to where you cannot even get past between two chairs.   The atmosphere is very hipster, chic, minimal, and very dim lighting. It seems as though you're supposed to feel that you are walking into a Michelin-rated restaurant, but it seems more casual than that.   We had the grilled spanish octopus appetizer. I was expecting something chewy, but the octopus was good so well and was very tender. I had the Grilled Verlasso Salmon. It tasted familiar. a bit spicy like Thai food. The salmon was cooked to perfection! My husband had the Slow Braised Short Rib, and he had no complaints. We ended our dinner with the Chocolate Tres Leches. Very fresh ingredients!   We will definitely come back to try their seasonal options.",

    "text": "So i came to black sheep on a friends recommendation and i must say it was pretty good. I had a reservation for a friday night, it was pretty busy but not too busy because all the walk ins i saw sat pretty quick.  Our server (Danielle?) was amazing, her personality is one of the best ive ever encountered in the service industry. She deserves a raise or promotion lol  For drinks we ordered La Flama Blanca and also the Vietnamese coffee martini. La Flama blanca was refreshing and it had some spice to it that lingered. I really liked it. Ive had Vietnamese coffee before and i figured id like the martini and i did. Imagine a bailies but better.   For apps we got:   pickled veggies, i loved these. I actually enjoyed them in between bites because the taste almost cleansed my palate.   Calamari, this is just an average breaded calamari. I can do without it next time.  Bao sliders, wow yum. The bao sliders were so soft and tasty. Especially the side of chips it comes with. They were small but they are apps so. I would like to try them with a sauce on the bun though because at times it was a little dry.   For entrees we got: Short rib, wow this was delicious. Id order it again. The baby pears that got poached in red and wine were so good. The short rib itself was tender,melt in your mouth.  Trout, its a whole fish, deboned. Which is amazing. However i felt it had way too much sauce, it overpowered the whole dish. I was disappointed that i was given forbidden rice instead of white rice (because they were out of white rice?)   I was also disappointed that they were out of salmon skin tacos. I hear its a popular item. They should stock up.  For dessert we got an off menu item, horchata creme brulee with pumpkin gelato. It was tasty but for myself, too rich.",

Start with a great cocktail menu - or whatever you want they can make - and then both the appetizers and main menu are high quality ingredients and really creative rather than gimmicky fusion/influenced food - Jamie Tran gets the balance right. Relatively modest menu but definitely something for various tastes or dietary issues and it goes its own way and quality is outstanding.   Interior is spartan - metal chairs - but welcoming and casual. Wonderful place to spend an evening.",

While this is a hike from the Strip where we were staying, it's worth the ride. This is clearly a place where locals go and the prices are much more reasonable than the casinos, of course.  They had a small but impressive cocktail and wine list, with some unfiltered wines from California that were pretty uncommon.  Across the board, the food was delicious. The standouts were Thai basil shrimp ceviche (very tangy) and the grilled octopus (perfectly cooked). We stuck to a bunch of the appetizers, but the Duroc pork belly entree was a very good dish.  Overall, a great meal and service was friendly. The table kind of wobbly, and even though we didn't ask, someone came around and noticed that and put a piece of wood under the table legs so it didn't wobble anymore. Very pleased with my experience at The Black Sheep.",

At first I thought we weren't going to like him because he started literally describing the entire menu to us but it turned out he was just excited at the fact that a new menu had started that very day.  Turns out he was awesome.   Friendly, helpful and available but not too available.   He never hovered or seemed to rush us.  He even poked his head out the door while we outside and made us laugh.   The drinks I got were pretty good.   There was one that I think I'd come back to get even if I didn't like the food served.     Now to the food.   Can I just say...  wow!  Everything we ordered was above average except for one dessert.   There is almost never an occasion where I can't rank my favorite dishes but this was definitely one of them.  If I had to pick a favorite it would have to be the pork belly.   Orgasmic!  I'm definitely going to brag about this place for quite some time so if you're thinking about going.. just do it!",

We sat in the corner, which was probably the quietest spot one could find, and we felt nicely secluded. We started with Thai basil shrimp ceviche and Vietnamese imperial rolls. The former was rich in a multitude of flavors - fresh shrimp, lemon, a surprising crunch from radish - and I loved it. The rolls were actually nothing very special, and I wouldn't go out of my way to try them again. For the main course, we tried the scallops and slow-braised short ribs. Both dishes were decadent and flavorful; both had wayyyyy too much sauce. Everything was drowning in a creamy sauce that almost took away from the flavors of the dish. A little goes a long way, and one can always add more sauce, but you can't really take it away. With that said, we finished everything with gusto and completed the experience with dessert - I can't remember the exact name. But it was similar to a tres leches cake topped with a chocolate bird's nest. It was delicious! All in all, I would return again, and try some other items! A nice experience for a memorable evening out.",

    "text": "This ain't yo mama's fish sauce, noodles, and chopsticks traditional Viet food, but it's just as good.  The Black Sheep is a relatively new, dinner-only restaurant with Vietnamese \"fusion\" cuisine and an alcohol-forward menu. It's nestled in the corner of a plaza with neighbors ranging from local gems such as SkinnyFATS and Plantone's to casual chains including Carl's Jr and Roberto's Taco Shop, so parking can get tough at peak meal hours. However, it wasn't packed at 7:30pm on Thursday night, and we had our group of 5 seated easily without needing a reservation.  I'd been looking forward to trying more of Chef Jamie Tran's cuisine ever since enjoying her offerings at the recent Hopped Taco Throwdown (my review: <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/elite-perk-hopped-taco-throwdown-las-vegas\">yelp.com/biz/elite-perk-...</a>), but first I was cajoled into trying some cocktails by our loquacious waiter.  Green Lightning ($9): matcha infused Russell Henry gin, lime simple syrup, cardamom bitters. I ordered this for the variety of flavors, and unfortunately the matcha and cardamom were either too light or simply overpowered by the gin and lime syrup. I did enjoy the cocktail nonetheless.  La Flama Blanca ($9): Kai Lemongrass Shochu, spicy Thai chili syrup, lemon simple syrup, egg whites. Took a sip of my friend's, and the chili carried strongly but didn't cling to my palate. Tasty overall, so I would definitely consider ordering it next time for myself.  Mauritius Lychee Martini ($12): Absolut Vodka, Housemade Lychee Simple Syrup, Dynasty Mauritius Lychee. A very simple cocktail that didn't really taste sweet enough, but the essence of real lychee fruit carried through.  We got into the food not long afterward. For simplicity, I'll list them all consecutively (this time omitting full ingredient lists, which can be seen on the web site or photos), but we got the appetizers at roughly the same time after the cocktails, followed by a rather distinct period of conversation (read: waiting), and then a simultaneous entree presentation.  Fried Beef Crisps ($6): surprisingly fantastic appetizer, with dried beef tendons taking the place of pork rinds in what otherwise strongly resembles chicharrones. However, this version is much lighter and more airy while retaining an excellent crunchiness.  Crispy Mediterranean Octopus ($11): surprising letdown of an appetizer. I wouldn't describe it as very crispy outside, and the inside skewed far toward mushy rather than simply tender. The curry-esque sauce was fine, but I wouldn't get this again based on the mouthful of a bite that I took.  Bao Sliders ($9): juicy, medium-rare pork (seriously) patty is the star of this slider-shaped, Taiwanese-inspired dish that does have a fairly Vietnamese flavor mix. Definitely second-best appetizer out of what we decided to try.  Ahi Tuna Tartare ($12): it's a pretty good rendition of a popular sushi restaurant appetizer, but it feels overpriced for what amounts to spicy tuna atop a rather inexpensive-looking Vietnamese puffed rice cracker. Props to the chef for captivating others though.  Braised Duroc Pork Belly ($18): I only tasted parts of my friend's entree, but to the restaurant's credit, they nailed this and all subsequent proteins. This tender and fatty pork belly is definitely among the best in town, and the chicharron was good, although I would've appreciated a less mushy rice.  Scottish King Salmon \"Clay Pot\" ($23): let's just say that the technique is quite a departure from clay pot cooking, so thanks for the double quotation marks. This was my entree, and I loved every bite. The salmon itself was super tender and moist, the crispy skin was spectacular, the eggplant was remarkably savory, and the farro was surprisingly addictive. Applewood smoke lightly permeated and enhanced all components. I would've cleaned my \"bowl\" had they presented me with a spoon to use, but a fork and knife aren't really the right shape for the job.  Slow Cooked Short Rib ($20): our waiter billed this as so tender you could cut it with the dull knife edge, and he was right. On top of that, they instilled plenty of flavor, including a proper salt level. The squash ratatouille was also delicious. I'll probably have to order it for myself next time rather than tasting a friend's plate so that I can get to the yucca gnocchi and threads.  Decor is upscale / dark-colored but not tablecloth-fancy. Music was surprisingly full of hip-hop tracks, but not loud. I gotta get one of those small portable light sources that are becoming popular with Instagram-aholics. That's how dark it was, and my photo quality and visual enjoyment of the colorful ingredients suffered for it. Maybe that's actually a testament to how delicious everything was?  Although none of what I tasted truly resembled anything traditionally Vietnamese, I loved the meal overall. I found only a few things lacking (octopus and other apps, cocktails, perceived slow pace of meal), and I'll definitely try to return despite price and distance.",

Chef Jamie and her staff worked their butts off and provided us with an unforgettable dining experience!  She makes some of the best food we have ever tasted!!  The hot chicken is fantastic!  The beet risotto, SO GOOD!!!!  She even catered to the kids that were there with chicken tenders and sprinkles for their dessert!!  Wonderful time, highly recommend!!",

    "text": "Whether an homage to the chef's minority status in the kitchen or the heretofore relatively unknown existence of American-Vietnamese fusion cuisine, the Black Sheep is definitely a fitting name for a dark, modern space boasting a tight, fresh menu. Chef Jaime Tran's dishes are thoughtful twists on classics that add a little extra flavor and finesse worth crossing town for.  I came in with a pescatarian pal and we tried most of the dishes suitable for her diet, starting with a half dozen happy hour oysters and the oft-'grammed Ahi Tuna Tartare on crispy rice. The oysters were fresh and briney, and we paired them with their spicy rooster cocktail sauce for a bit of a kick. The tartare was beautifully presented and palpably fresh, with micro cilantro garnish and chili citrus oil.   We moved on to the Crispy Mediterranean Octopus and the Charred Peach & Mesclun Salad with the Fried Whole Rainbow Trout as our shared entree. The octopus was fried rather than the typical grilled preparation, and the spicy chili and vadouvan sauce is not for the faint of heart. The portion size on this dish was happily a touch larger than expected. The summery salad was decent, but the peaches needed a bit more time on the grill and a slightly larger dose of acidity in the prickly-pear vin. The fish entree was the most traditional of the dishes we tried and it was much enjoyed, filleted boneless with a complementary ginger and rice wine vinegar sauce that went well with the greens and rice.  Service was attentive throughout our visit and the bustling space was busy but not bursting.The dining room could benefit from a bit more light, as supported by most snap-happy diners taking their food literally outside in order to get a good shot. Looking forward to revisiting with a carnivorous friend for the sliders, wings, and short rib. Props for offering a vegan entree as well, even if I'll likely have to wait for a solo visit to try it.",

    "text": "My husband and I have been wanting to try out Black Sheep ever since it opened but we never had the time. However! My husband had made the request to dine here for his birthday night and whatever the birthday boy wants, he gets!  We got to Black Sheep about 1-2 minutes before their happy hour ended and they were nice enough to continue to honor happy hour prices for us. Happy hour runs from from 5pm-6pm. Their deals include $1 oysters, $5 wines, and $4 bartender's choice beers. They only have one cocktail on the happy hour and it's $6.   We started off with a dozen oysters, a cocktail for me, and a beer for my husband. Their cocktail of the day was a raspberry mojito and their bartender's choice beer was an IPA. We also got their beef crisps for an appetizer. For entrees, we went with their smoked clay pot salmon and beef short ribs.   Their oysters tasted really fresh and for $1 each, it's a great deal. The only problem I have is that I wish there were more brine in the oysters and whoever shucked them needs more practice. I forgot what kind of oysters these were but they had a creamy texture to them. They were delicious.  My raspberry mojito tasted really light. If they never told me it was raspberry, I would never have been able to guess what it was.   The beef crisps are dried thin tendons that are deep fried, sprinkled with Japanese seasoning, and then a lime sauce is poured onto it. They sort of reminded me of the shrimp chips. I really liked the sauce they poured on it but other than that, I don't really care for them. It wasn't mind blowing or particularly memorable. Honestly, just have some chicharron.  The smoked clay pot salmon is a piece of salmon on top of farro. You can definitely smell the smoke. The salmon was delicious. It was perfectly cooked, tender, and juicy. The flavoring is just enough -- not too salty. The salmon does still have the skin and the skin was crispy ... perfect. The farro was not my favorite. I think I would've preferred regular jasmine rice with it.   The short rib was perfectly done. The meat just falls apart. It was very tender and juicy as well. Their short rib dish contains a bit of Asian influence since they use Asian pears. Despite all that, I've never been a fan of short rib so I can't say that their version of the dish changes my mind. If you're a person that doesn't care too much for braised short ribs, then please don't get it. I'm pretty sure you won't like it.  We also ordered a dessert and it was really delicious. It was like a chocolate sponge cake drizzled in sweet milk. Very easy to eat, not too rich, and yummy.  Overall, their execution on their dishes is good. The quality of their food is good as well. The creativity is a nice twist to what we normally know. However, taste-wise, I feel it could be better. Other than the oysters and the salmon, I didn't care too much for the rest. I would definitely come again for their $1 oysters! :)",

Pier 215 is probably the closest thing we have to upscale but the food is just A-OK.   I saw The Black Sheep when I was on a Skinny Fats food run and thought I'd look it up... after seeing the photos and reviews, my boyfriend and I came in for a happy hour to give it a try and  holy shiitake mushrooms was the food incredible!!  The Vietnamese Imperial rolls-- absolutely incredible. Tasty crispy outside with a warm delicious inside.  West Coast Oysters-- Not big weird oysters... succulent smaller treats that are buttery and flavorful with no fishy flavor. (Only $1 for happy hour, score!)  Bao Sliders-- Orgasmic. Don't be afraid of the quail egg, it's just like a regular egg, only smaller. These little sliders have so much flavor it's incredible. One of the best sliders I've ever had. An absolute must try!  Watermelon, Burrata, and Tomato salad-- this too was incredible. Tasty frisee and delicious fresh tomatos. The watermelon... perfect. They could have given a bit more burrata, but I'm kind of a sucker for cheese! Delicious.  Hanger Steak-- Now I've never been a fan of skirt steaks or hanger steaks. TBH, I've always thought they were inferior cuts of meat being peddled as hip, new cuts to try. This hanger steak is the best think to happen to me in EONS! The steak was incredible! Juicy, tender... perfect might not be too strong of a word lol. The sweet corn was also incredible.  This place is fantastic. It's not a cheap dinner, but it's well worth the price of admission. There's no way anybody could ever have a bland meal at this place. Will definitely be returning!!",

Such a wonderfully tender octopus was overshadowed.  Let that flavor of the octopus come out - don't cover it! -was otherwise cooked perfectly.  Ceveche is awesome",

    "text": "A new favorite for me! I had read about Black Sheep but hadn't been. So when it showed up for Restaurant Week... Count me in!  I think the RW menu was a great introduction to the food and wine options. Shepard, our server, explained the menu had some of the popular things, so perfect for us.  Started with beef skin (just sounded interesting and it was awesome!!). From the RW pre-fixe menu I had the duck prosciutto salad, short rib entree, and lychee cheesecake. Each course had a wine pairing and I was super impressed. Being a craft cocktail fan and a bunch of other really good looking entrees, there are a lot of reasons for me to return.   Glad we made reservations as it was packed this Friday night. Only small drawback was the noise. Between the loud music, the then louder patrons, hard ceiling, walls, and floors, bring your megaphone!",

The guy at the door was really nice & made us feel welcomed & comfortable.   We had the pickled veggies app and the tuna tartare to start with. the tuna was very simple and flavorful. For enteees we had the pork belly dish and the skirt steak dish. SO FREAKIN DELICIOUS! lots of flavor, meats cooked to perfection. I literally have no complaints. We had their chocolate tres leches dessert and it was amazing.   Compliments to the chef, the food is going to have us coming back forsure !",

The staff is very friendly and attentive giving the feeling of genuinely welcoming you to this restaurant. I highly recommend the bao sliders. Light, yet flavorful. The glass noodles were a bit on the oily side, but the flavor was rich and the heat was just right with some burn without ruining the pallet. To end I tried their blackberry sage ice cream. It was very refreshing and cleansed my palette. The blackberries were sweet and big chunks in it and the sage left my mother feeling nice. The prices are fair and I recommended this place as a tourist to other tourists.",

    "text": "Black Sheep is a complete opposite of your local suburban eatery. Cute but may be in the wrong location.   When you think American \"small plate\" appetizer, you're probably thinking decent size portion. Black Sheep delivers great tasting and great presentation, but under delivers with portions for the location. I wouldn't question the portions if this were on the Las Vegas Blvd. It just doesn't make sense for a suburban area.   The Lost Word...The Last Word cocktail was great as it was refreshing and evenly balanced with the food ordered.   The dessert was Tres Leches and Brownie. Similar to the apps, the presentation was beautiful, but nothing about the two were a wow factor. Truthfully, it tasted like an average brownie and tres Leches cake plated with beautiful garnishes.   Overall, the 5 stars are for service and execution. Everything about what Black Sheep offers is great, I feel however it doesn't cater to the area it's in.",

The scallops were like lost in a Black Forest of weeds and trash on the plate. The scallops were also indicative of frozen fish as they were rubbery and overdone. The imperial rolls are usually an indicator of authenticity- and this chef has none. The rolls came drenched in their version of a fish sauce with vinegar to cut the fish sauce taste. The tools should be crispy on outside and tender savory inside. These were soggy. Let people decide if they want sauce for dipping not ruining the food before it gets to the table. The other funny thing was the waiter trying to tell us that this place won best French Vietnamese restaurant 2017 for the US. Hogwash. I could name other places that are far above - Slanted Door, Out the Door and Le Colonial to name a few.",

Had the Mai Tai, Penicillin, Black Manhattan, White Negroni, and one other (as well as a $4 Ballast Point for Happy Hour). All were great. Particularly liked the Negroni. Still not completely sold on Amaro Montenegro substituting for vermouth in a Manhattan, but more research needs to be done. Perhaps Jessica (the bartender, who was fantastic) may be willing to try it as a Rob Roy for me (not super fond of Rye). The food was also great. $1 oysters for Happy Hour (5-6). Big fan of the gelee sauce. Boa sliders. Salmon tacos (with crispy salmon as the shell). Whatever those spring roll things were (sorry, I've been drinking), The wings seemed out of place, as they were a bit heavier than the other dishes, but I'll still probably get them on my next visit (a bit heavy, but still yummy).  Need to try an entree next time, and I'm guessing desserts will be very interesting.  Also looked at the wine list. Dirt cheap, with some really good selections. Tough, with the cocktails being so good.",

No knife needed here. Melt-in-your mouth these short ribs are served with a creamy polenta with sauteed turnip greens. The added flavoursome poached Asian pears is perfectly balanced and add an extra explosion for the senses. I cannot stop thinking about this dish, it was that incredible.  I've dined all over the world at several Michelin star restaurants, this is a chef to watch. The Black Sheep delivers Michelin-starred food without the Michelin snoot or sacraments. The staff is extremely friendly, Oh and by the way I nearly fell off my chair when I got the bill.   Dinner for 3 with a bottle of wine and dessert under $150.00 with tip. I would have gladly paid triple it was so unforgettable and cannot wait to go back the next time I am in Vegas.",

We started off with three of the appetizers. We wanted to try as much as possible. Salmon skin tacos. The skin is the taco shell filled with salmon belly tartare, tabiko, smoked shishito peppers, and micro cilantro. The difference in the texture here was the thing. The crispness of the skin shell opposed to the softness of the tartare. There wasn't a ton of flavor here, but it is definitely a unique dish that I am glad I tried. We also had the imperial rolls. Think Vietnamese egg rolls. The sauce these are laying in on the plate was divine. They were so yummy, I could have eaten a whole plate of them. Lastly, we tried the bao sliders with pork sausage, fried quail egg, crispy shallot, and jalapeno aioli. They also came with a side of lotus root chips. I love when I get to try something I have never had or even heard of before. I am telling you these should be a thing. The buns I am told are made in house daily and are pillowy and delicious. My problem here was the fennel in the sausage. It was overwhelming. I will admit, I am not a fennel fan so maybe this was more the issue. The jalapeno aioli and lotus chips were really good though and saved the whole thing for me. For my entree I had to have the braised Duroc pork belly. It came on a bed of cauliflower puree, sauteed kabocha squash, and crispy pig ear on top. This meal was one of the best I have ever had. The pork belly was absolutely the most tender and delicious I have ever had anywhere. The flavors here all worked together and I could not have been more pleased. My friend had the spicy Vietnamese curry chicken. It was a chicken thigh with lentils, potatoes, and carrots. She loved it! She said the spice level was perfect. Our server Danielle was a real professional who was personable and friendly and only added to the wonderful night. We will absolutely be back the next time we are in town. They run on a seasonal menu so we will be excited to see what is offered next time. I highly suggest you get there and soon!",

    "text": "Loving everything about this place. It's not a very big restaurant so not fit for big parties, but I prefer this intimate setting in a local area of town. Traditional American fare with a Viet flare.  Let's start with some good beer and a bourbon cocktail. And have that with the Bao Sliders. Two little sliders with a side of lotus root 'fries'. Perfect starter portion. Definitely taste that Viet notes.  Tried the Salmon Clay Pot and the Short Ribs for the main event. The portion was perfect, not stingy but you don't feel sick after eating the whole thing. The salmon was cooked well with the crispy skin and not too dry, sitting on farro and veggies. Only thing is too much sauce at the bottom making the last couple bites a bit salty. The Short Ribs were cooked well and served with Gnocchi and veggies... cleaned the plates.  Only one option for dessert.. as our server calls it, the Vietnamese take on Tres Leches. Unfortunately... not impressed. There's nothing Asian about it except the mint leaves. The cake is very dense and chocolatey. The \"bird's nest\" chocolate piece on top of the cake is hard to break. I'm a dessert lover and chocolate lover for sure, but this wasn't the best way to end my meal.  It was 5 stars before dessert. I'd recommend this place for the food and portions and price, but look elsewhere to satisfy your sweet tooth.",

    "text": "Everyone seemed to give rave reviews to The Black Sheep when it first opened and ever since it won Eater Vegas' \"Best New Restaurant,\" category this past year, even more praise was heaped on this new Vietnamese fusion restaurant. The thing with many Asian fusion restaurants is that it attempts to gentrify the food with pretty plating and an increased price tag at the cost of portion size. Nevertheless, there were a few menu items that I really enjoyed.  The starters have a couple of favorites of mine including the salmon skin tacos and the bao sliders. The salmon skin tacos are an ingenius way of wrapping salmon tartare with a crispy salmon skin taco. Topped off with tobiko, micro cilantro, and smoked shishito peppers, this is everything that I envision fusion to encompass. Three small tacos for $8 is quite reasonable. My other favorite was the bao sliders, which come with two house made pork sausage, topped with a fried quail egg, shallots, and jalapeno aioli. Many times, people rely on the fatty flavor of pork belly to carry the bao, but the pork sausage, with the egg and aioli really made for a great flavored slider. I almost forgot that I also loved the fried beef crisps with table side pouring of the chili lime sauce. This was an appetizer that made you want to keep on snacking.   When it came to the entrees, I really was disappointed by the portions. The Vietnamese curry chicken came with one single piece of chicken thigh. Priced at $18, you could get an entire bucket of KFC for that. The flavor was reminiscent of home cooking. I get it, it's a nice restaurant, but seriously, a single chicken thigh for $18. As for the slow cooked short rib, I was more impressed with the alcohol-infused poached pears than the short rib itself.   The tres leches chocolate cake for dessert is probably the most photographed item on the entire menu. I was impressed by the bird's nest-like aesthetic, but it was just that. The flavor was one-dimensional, which could've used some nuts, citrus flavors, or coconut shavings in my opinion. I'm glad to see Vegas having these types of restaurants, which seem to be successful in up and coming neighborhoods such as the Southwest, but by California standards, it would ultimately be average at best.",

Had to knock off several stars as the pork chop had several raw pieces and informed our server but he didn't even acknowledge it; sorta treated it as a nuisance complaint brushing off his shoulders.  Other than that the pork was juicy and had great flavor. The dumpling and mushroom appetizers were good however the steak was lackluster in flavor along with the Brussels sprouts on top needed some salt or something extra to make it pop. Not too much of a dessert person but chocolate mousse and strawberry shortcake was so-so.  Wouldn't have ordered them if it wasn't already on a pre-fixed menu. Overall I would visit again to see if all the above has improved.",

    "text": "If you're Asian, don't come expecting a Vietnamese American fusion restaurant-- this is a new American restaurant with some Asian touches.  It's a bit away from the Strip so we came for dinner straight after flying into LAS.  Cocktails are great here, especially if you like yours slightly (but not too much) on the sweeter side.  Food is good too but not amazing, but maybe our expectations were too high considering all the kudos from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Feater.com&s=7f606dd4e5b582c34825c3b9446fe5c66167b3098f51968f34f6744d71249e83\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">eater.com</a>.  * Flama Blanca:  This cocktail deserves all the accolades as the spicy kick of the Thai chilies blended perfectly with the sweet richness of the lemongrass and egg whites.  5/5  * Mr Brownstone:  this starts as straight bourbon so very boozy as first, but as the ice cube melts, more sweetness and ginger becomes prevalent.  Problem is that once you find the right portion of bourbon to sweetness, you need to drink it quickly.  4.5/5  * West Coast oysters:  the lemongrass ice would be great on a hot day, but the portion added to each oyster was inconsistent -- some it was barely noticeable and some it added a refreshing flavor.  Too bad they no longer have a late night Happy Hour.  4/5  * Beet Salad:  deliciously rich and flavorful.  Probably the least healthy beet salad I've had.  4.5/5  * Braised pork belly:  the belly was nicely braided to be so tender, and the fried pigs ears gave a nice constrast.  4/5  * Spicy Vietnamese Curry Chicken:  my husband is Vietnamese and he was puzzled by this dish as it didn't taste like his home land except for the way the chicken thigh was cooked.  Nice kick in the curry.  4/5  * Vietnamese Coffee Tres Leche Cake:  more of a solid chocolate cake than anything else.  The coffee flavor was mild, and we wish there was more tres leche sauce.  But still a good cake.  4/5  If we lived in the area or had reason to be nearby, this would be a good local restaurant but with so many great food options on the Strip and in Chinatown, we aren't in any hurry to come back.",

The rest of my party got the short ribs and the duck confit. They were very palette pleasing.

Lamb belly was tasty though probably on the salty side as well. Rice was hard.  That said, we still enjoyed ourselves. Dessert almost ruined the dinner though. Debating between the chocolate tres leche and the persimmon bread pudding, we were persuaded by the waiter to go with the latter. Well, it definitely wasn't as amazing as he made it out to be. The bread pudding was dense and didn't have any distinctive flavor or texture, and it was a whopping $12. They don't have a dessert menu so we didn' know till the check came.    We'll be back.

The bar seats about 8-10 and will be my next parking spot when I come alone. I had their Mr. Brownstone cocktail, which was basically straight bourbon poured over a sweetened ice cube. I had to chop that sucker up and let it melt, melt, melt, but after that, it was delicious.  Fresh oysters get a choice of 3 sauces and the lemongrass granita was tasty. The tuna tartare was small, but just enough. It was wrapped in a nice little crunch cocoon to make eating with your fingers feasible. The beet salad I had was amazing. There's no way that thing was healthy, doused in a creamy, heavenly sauce, but oh so worth it. My husbands flank steak was cooked perfectly and rather hearty by still left room for dessert. Good move guys! Always make sure there's room for dessert!  Three dessert offerings. My only issue here is that the tres leches cake (and the coffee martini) had sweetened condensed milk-bleh. I bake that cake a lot and refuse to use that crap. I went with the Rocky Road and it was fantastic. Maybe just needed a little extra raspberry sauce, so if you get it, ask for extra raspberry to break up the sweet marshmallow and chocolate.  Service gets an A, he wasn't amazing, but decent. On it, on it, on it, then disappears for a long time. Repeat. The bathrooms are beautiful and, as I mentioned plush, soft toilet paper-yay! I liked the decor in a monochromatic scheme. The place is intimate and parking is tricky in that lot (it's pretty full).  My only recommendation, as I give to many places, is to have a list of mocktails! For those pregnant, recovering alcoholics, or just plain already drunk, it nice to have these fancy choices without feeling left out. Mocktails are all the rage.",

    "text": "I have always been considered The Black Sheep of my family and extended family, so this genius and fusion Vegas restaurant pays total respect to us Black Sheep.   I have been to The Black Sheep several times now- from after they opened, to Restaurant Week, to cocktails and food at the bar, to a sit down dinner with friends - every experience has been solid.   I am a Cocktail Darling so when I find a place that serves original delicious cocktails, I can make myself a regular. The first cocktail I tried here, several weeks after their opening, was their now famous La Flama Blanca. That bit of heat was incredible and genius. I somehow felt this place was special for cocktails so over time I have tried Mr. Brownstone, The Black Sheep and numerous others. One of my favorites has to be Mr. Brownstone, not only for the presentation but the smoothness of this drink. They have a wonderful wine selection and after dinner liqueurs that I have also indulged in. Their alcohol selection is thoughtfully planned and worth coming back for.  As for the food, the genius vision of Chef Jaime Tran creating upscale fusion food sets this restaurant apart from others in the same food genre. Chef Jamie is such an upbeat and joyful person, every bit of her spunk translates into the dishes she creates. I have dove into many of their dishes and all of them are fabulous.   One of the owners, Andy, is very personable and has a good memory for faces and names. He always makes you feel welcome as he makes his rounds about The Black Sheep talking to customers and calling you by name. Such a sincere and personable touch.   So far the dishes I have tried, loved and recommend are: Vietnamese Imperial Rolls, West Coast Oysters, Braised Duroc Pork Belly, Scottish Salmon and the Short Ribs. The Black Sheep has added more desserts beyond their original Chocolate Tres Leches, which is divine and sinful. On my last visit a few weeks ago,  I tried a some of my friend's Horchata Creme Brule and it was insanely delicious. I am very curious on their new desserts and I know it is time for me to go back in and do more indulging!  See you soon Andy and Chef Jaime!",

For brunch yesterday, we had oysters with a Thai chili sauce, the pear salad, smoked bacon, chilaquiles, and the omelet with short rib and mushrooms. The omelet was my favorite, I didn't want it to end! Probably why there were no pictures of it :) We also did the bottomless bellinis, mimosas, and rose. The pours were a bit light, but very good! Our server and the entire staff were friendly and quick. The only disappointing thing was that we didn't get the lemongrass short rib benedict, as they didn't have it yesterday. That'll be our excuse to brunch here again soon!",

I had three items: salmon skin tacos, the imperial egg rolls, and the tres leches dessert. I enjoyed all three, a lot. The salmon skin tacos were an interesting item that tasted good. The imperial egg rolls were perhaps the tastiest tolls I have had. The dessert was a solid closer.  The service is also very good--I sat at the bar and the bartender (whose name I missed) was friendly and observant.  It is definitely worth checking out.",

They were ok, nothing is necessarily come back for versus other reviewers talked about them having oysters from socal stating they were delicious.  According to the waiter, each bartender makes sangria differently. This time it tasted more tart, which I'm not a fan of.  The fried beef crisps at only $6 are worth trying, especially if you're into chicharon. I suggest opting for the sauce on the side as to not ruin the crunch factor.  The grilled octopus was tender but did not taste fresh or grilled. The grilled taste may have been overpowered by the sauce they have with the dish. The sauce is a bit spicy.  Service was pleasant.  Personally, I won't be returning for HH, but maybe I'll try out their entrees another time.",

This place is very cute and chic and although small, that makes it intimate and perfect for a date.  It is very simply decorated and that works in a small space.  The staff were very attentive and informative and told us about the whole menu.  The timing on the dishes were great.  All of the appetizers didn't come out at once but rather in succession as soon as you were done with the first which is top notch and wasn't expected from this place.    We got the ahi tuna tartare, vietnamese imperial rolls, spicy vietnamese curry chicken, and the beet salad, the tres leches cake, the tequila cocktail, and the two rum cocktails.  The tuna tartare was good but not mind blowing and the imperial rolls were quite tasty!  The chicken was pleasantly spicy but not overwhelming and that shows that the chef really knows how to work with the ingredients.  The flavors were nicely balanced and the portion was just large enough.  I tried my date's beet salad and although not bad, it wasn't my cup of tea.  It was also my first time eating beets.  The tres leches cake was good but I am not a fan of coffee so when I got to the coffee whipped cream it was a bit off-putting and overwhelming for me.  The three cocktails were spot on and were consistently very good!    I really liked this place and felt special eating here and that is what a good restaurant is supposed to do to you.",

We ordered the salmon skin taco and The Yelp review trying to convince me that the salmon skin taco was the bomb but it wasnt. They are small for $4 each and you might end up ordering more. Dont come there after 6pm if you're looking for oyster because it will cost you $3 each for small ones and I rather go to oyster bar at the Palace Station if you're going to spend that kind of price. My wife's salmon dinner was pretty good but my $33 8oz steak that I ordered was pretty salty. I'm not sure how they prep this food but I can taste shrimp paste aka bagoong. I end up cutting the edges and mix with the purple potatoes. I'm not satisfied and I'm sure that would be my last visit in that place. I left that place hungry and I rather add $20 in my dinner I could have gotten a pretty delicious steak somewhere else. See it for yourself and please let us know.",

    "text": "An innobative chef brings her mixed bag to Southwest Vegas. For starters we tried the salmon skin tacos, the beet salad, the crispy beef cracklin's and the Imperial egg rolls. We thought the salmon skin tacos missed the mark. Tha salmon tartare was so heavily spiced with the smoked peppers, we lost the flavor of the salmon. The other three were great. I'd order the dressing on the beet salad on the side next time.  For entrees, we had the braised short rib, the whole rainbow trout and the braised pork belly. Our favorite was the trout, roasted whole and boneless. It was cooked perfectly. The pork belly was nicely braised, developing a creamy, flavorful texture in the fat during the braise. The short rib was good, but not a favorite.  Portions are fair, the service is very good and the atmosphere pleasant. We'd go back, which is a high recommendation.",

We started with the house made pickles - displaying a rainbow of crisp vegetables, the Fried Beef Crips are light in texture but bold in flavor, and the tomato and watermelon salad was perfect for the hot summer evening. For our entrees: Slow cooked short ribs are tender and flavorful. The Scottish King Salmon 'clay pot' presentation was such a nice touch and a generous portion of salmon balanced with scented farro.  Last but definitely NOT least... tres lechas chocolate cake! Need I say more . Thank you for the hospitality. We will be back!!",

I have to say that the new menu was as good as I remembered it. The drink menu has several unique and tasty drinks. I tried \"la flama blanca\" which had lemongrass and eggs whites. I truly enjoyed the drink as it was very refreshing. For my main entree we ordered the Vietnamese curry which was very good as well, great flavors and awesome presentation. Please be aware this dish is a bit spicy if you are not used to the heat.  my 2nd option was the rainbow trout which was perfectly cooked. The fish came all in one piece (head, eyes, teeth lol) but is was a very enjoyable dish. The atmosphere of this restaurant is hip but relaxed at the same time.

I am glad we stayed b/c we tried more things than we normally would have.  Food was delicious and service was outstanding.  Looking forward to coming back!",

Coincidentally I had just had a friend recommend this place to me a few weeks ago and was planning on coming anyways, but here we are! To start we had the Beef fried crisps, Imperial rolls, and the Pear salad. Then we followed this with Scallop entree and Pork Belly entree. Finally we ended with the Chocolate tres leches cake. Good Lord. Can you say food coma party of two? Everything we had was delicious and surprised me in some way. The beef fried crisps were similar to pork rinds, but so much more... the flavor.... The pear salad was my favorite of all. Scallops and Pork Belly were so tender and flavorful! Service was on point the entire time and very informative. Will definitely be back!",

Served with a side of rooster cocktail sauce.   Bao sliders came with 2 for $9 (appetizer) I got this because it looked like a popular dish to choose from. I took 1 bite and gave it away to someone else, who didn't want it either. It has an interesting taste to it but I was not interested. I would not recommend.  Overall, server told me to come back and try their other dishes.. maybe.",

    "text": "Excellent staff, good selection of food and drinks. Great Vietnamese fusion and overall vibe. The sweet vinegar items can be dialed down a bit but I think it's because we ordered so many things that had the pickling thing going on and maybe overdid it ourselves. The one and only dessert was amazing and a must try. The pork belly is a little too fatty for my tastes.  We've been back 3 more times since I started this review. Apparently the menu changes constantly. The protein stays the same but the prep is different. It always tasted delicious but don't expect to get your 'favorite' entree the next time because it's no longer the same. They've also added additional desserts. Their version of the tres leche is still the best dessert. Tried more cocktails and their mixologist is very talented.  The check is a little pricey when you are done for the night but everything is always yummy.",

    "text": "I came to this place a couple of months ago, and it was definitely a five star experience over alI, but I was there this week expecting the same, and something really disappointed me.  I really enjoy the ambiance of this place. If it wasn't for a lady laughing her heart out in a neighboring table, the amount of noise is moderate.  Though I'm used to more acidity in my salads, to my wife the apple salad was perfect. The tuna tartare was really good. It is served on crisps that resemble pork rinds. My wife ordered the pork belly and it was flavorful and tender. I'd been staying away from beef for 15 days and I was ready to break my diet, so when I saw the ribeye on the menu, I immediately started to crave the flavor and tenderness given by the marbling in this particular cut. I ordered it medium. When the food arrived, the steak was served sliced and the center was clearly medium rare. I can live with that, however, it definitely didn't look, felt, or tasted like a ribeye. It had no marbling whatsoever, and it was too thick and narrow. It felt like a sirloin, which is too lean and much less flavorful and tender (and usually way cheaper too). I felt cheated, but I was hungry and in no mood to complain about it. This is a small business, a really nice place, and it's been open for less than a year, so I'm definitely giving it another chance. I would much rather go there than to one of the big chain restaurants. I guess I'll just ask a lot more questions before placing my order. Service was really good.",

Owners and operators have previous incredible success at both Chada and Chada Street and the wine list here shows those chops yet again. Menu is well-designed in offering strong, impactful dishes while staying compact and focused. We split the supposedly renowned beet salad -- which was incredible (the goat cheese yogurt is flawless and balanced) -- and ordered the chicken curry and short ribs. Both entrees were delightful and displayed the chef's deft grasp of flavor compliments and layers. Service was outstanding and informative and offered informed opinions about dishes and cocktails. Bartenders seemed a bit distracted and inattentive at first when I attempted to obtain service at the bar, but it was busy.   Look forward to returning and delving deeper into wine list.",

The oysters could've done with out the gelee.. texture usually doesn't bother me but it was hard for me to stomach all the sliminess. I thought the beef crisps were going to be something completely different, which is my fault. It is basically chicharrones but with beef tendon. It was actually really good and flavorful. The octopus was okay. I liked flavor added by the curry. I got the steak which was cooked and seasoned perfectly. I wish there were more dessert options! we got the chocolate tres leches which was okay, but I'm not a fan of tres leches. Our only other options were two types of sorbet.

The interior design is easy on the eyes and the choice of music was awesome!  The food was sensory overload. Starting with the Fried Beef Crisps (meat cotton candy) to the Buttata & Asparagus Salad. Every bite is a unique flavor combination that will surprise your taste buds.  The entrees were well balanced, the glass noodles were the most amazing I have ever had! Delicious! The pork belly was sooooo tender, it fell apart on my fork.  Don't forget to save room for dessert! The brownie was ON FIRE! Soooo good.",

We kind of unexpectedly fell into the place the first time, and were quite impressed with the gin selection, Short Ribs, and vegan Voodoo Noodles...so, in order to validate our initial impressions...we had to go again!!  Well, once again Max took amazing care of us.  This time we dropped a Bouillabaisse and Duck Confit on the palates, and they were spectacular.  Not one bite was out of place, and the persimmon salad was a great finisher...all paired with a couple of high quality glasses of wine.  We were told that the head chef has been a sous chef for multiple luminaries around Vegas, and it doesn't surprise me.   The menu is on point, and the execution of the four dishes we've had has been flawless.     The Black Sheep is a really great spot...",

Both dishes were very good, high recommend them!!  Atmosphere has a cool, chill vibe with good music. A mix of hip hop and top 40 throwbacks. Songs that bring back memories for us in our 30s. Service was good also. We had good cocktails. The Bangla Road Martini was delicious and refreshing. The Mr. Brownstone has a brown sugar ice cube which melts as you sip. We had three appetizers and shared an entree. The Salmon Skin Tacos were salty and fishy. I wouldn't get them again.  The Grilled Spanish Octopus was really good, not too spicy. The Vietnamese Imperial Rolls were very good also, probably the best of the three apps. We got the Lemongrass Duck Confit as our entree and it was Amazing!!",

Well my brothers 30th birthday was that occasion and literally every cocktail and dish we tried was amazing. I'm not sure I have anything negative to say in this review.   For appetizers we took our servers suggestion and got the crispy beef skins (amazing! Like chicharrones but better), the salmon skin tacos, the Vietnamese egg rolls, and the Spanish octopus. They were all so delicious I wouldn't be able to tell you which was the best!   Then for entrees we kind of wanted to keep the family style going since we wanted to try everything! We got the short rib, the ribeye, the rainbow trout and the scallops. Again everything was so well cooked and delicious. Now we all have to go back to try the other half of the menu lol!   Lastly the cocktails! There was a bourbon one with an ice cube made out of sugar and vanilla and other stuff but it was still a little strong for me.  Otherwise the other three (pictured) were so yummy. The bees knees was not too sweet and sweet enough. And the other two (I forgot the names) were tasty and well balanced too. My brothers was the best though. It was the green one with Tito's. Anyways can't go wrong at this place!! Will be back for sure",

We used an Uber to get to Black Sheep from the Strip about 5:30 on a Wednesday and it took about 30 minutes (rush hour traffic) so if you have a reservation between 5-7 I would give yourself at least 45 minutes. Black Sheep is not 2 big, so I would recommend making reservations as this restraunt does get busy.  Their signature cocktail menu is extensive and very delicious - ordered the Spanish Octopus, which was very tender and spicy. The imperial rolls deep fried rolls stuffed with veggies and pork delish. And. Salmon skin tacos were also delicious   For main course we had sea scallops, which was cooked perfectly very tender and well seasoned.  The braised short ribs was also very tender and well seasoned.    For dessert we had a chocolate moose cake very moist and tasty  Service is very attentive and just ask for recommendations the servers are very knowledgeable  We will definitely be back and would recommend to anyone looking for somewhere away from the Strip",

Dishes were flavorful (although husband said the trout sauce was a bit on the salty side.) Dessert was excellent (apple crumble.)  Though the food was delicious it was a bit overpriced for this type of cuisine.   Recommendations: Turn down the music (or be more selective with music).  Selection didn't fit the ambiance restaurant is trying to create based on price, decor, and overall atmosphere by staff. Club or fine dining...which is it?   Would have been a nice touch from the chef who was chatting with some friends during downtime (only 6 customers in total in restaurant at the time) to have greeted new customers and asked about our experience. Unfortunately didn't happen.   Main reason for not returning is price factor for cuisine.",

Boyfriend and I came here for Saturday dinner date night. Reservations are difficult to come by especially on the weekends. So plan accordingly. Menu changes seasonally so what you may see here, might not be there. Although, our waiter said there were some key dishes that are permanent.   For appetizers we got: -Thai Basil Shrimp Ceviche. Avocado mousse, watermelon radish, prawn cracker and diced papaya. YUM! Very, very flavorful and fresh! -Vietnamese Imperial Rolls. Pork & shrimp with veggies. This tasted like a lumpia. -Grilled Spanish Octopus. Boyfriend LOVED it! Those of you who enjoy octopus, I definitely recommend. -Fried Beef Crisps with chili lime sauce and tajin dust. Reminds me of chicharrones.   For our entrees, we got: -Vegan Vietnamese Sauteed Glass Noodles. It comes with a variety of veggies like carrots, squash, bok choy and mushrooms. This was spicy!!! For those who love spice, this is the dish to get! Love the spice flavor! -Grilled Verlasso Salmon. comes with quinoa, tomatoes. Boyfriend said this was one of the best salmon he tasted. To me, it was a bit on the saltier side but the flavoring and the salmon was grilled perfectly.  For dessert, we ordered the Lychee Cheesecake. We don't got much of a sweet tooth but OH MY GOODNESS. This was heaven in my mouth.",

It's a cute, intimate dining/drink spot that seems to be a hit to both the younger and older crowd. Hipster, but classy hipster. No loud music, no outrageous prices. Cool enough to bring your Tinder date, relaxed enough to bring your mother in law.  The appetizers and drinks shined more than the entrees. I would come back for that, but not for dinner.

    "text": "Probably my new favorite restaurant.   Went for dinner tonight and couldn't wait until tomorrow to write the review because I'm so blown away. Jamie Tran, you've managed to create a restaurant we didn't even know we needed.   First, the feel. Dark, upscale, great music, amazing smells, smiling and professional staff. Dining area is small enough to make it feel exclusive, but not so small that you can't enjoy yourself. It was a great ambience, and felt like a place I'd bring a first date, or celebrate a huge milestone. Definitely fun and lively.  Next, drinks. Hunter (our amazing server) guided us through the cocktail list on the first page of the menu. We opted for the Bangla Road Martini, which is actually more of a lemon drop. Perfectly balanced with basil for a dangerously smooth drinking experience. If you like alcohol that doesn't taste like alcohol, this drink is for you. We also had some wine and champagne, but I'm really interested to taste their other cocktails next time.   Now the main attraction. Feeling adventurous? There's an app(etizer) for that. Ridiculous salmon skin tacos, a spicy Spanish octopus dish, imperial egg rolls that pay homage to the chef's Vietnamese heritage. All of them so perfectly cooked and plated, we took a million photos. My salmon entree was perfectly crispy AND moist, over a bed of red quinoa and what may have been the best vegetables I've had in my 28 years. The sauce on that plate would have been gone if I had a spoon; it was perfect for the plate. Have you ever been on the last few bites of a dish and been overcome with sadness that it was almost over? That happened with all of our food.   Dessert was shared between the four of us, and it was fantastic. Vietnamese tres leches cake, with a handspun chocolate wheel and coffee soaked in, this isn't your regular tres leches. I'm a huge fan of tiramisu, and though this wasn't that by any means, the coffee and the richness did remind me of it. It was the perfect ending to a perfect meal. It couldn't have been better.  Danny and Hunter made it amazing, as possibly the best restaurant duo in town. They both authentically cared about our experience from start to finish, constantly checking on us throughout the meal, and made sure we left feeling like VIPs.   Thank you both, along with Chef Jamie Tran, for the best meal we've had in a long time. Definitely earned Restaurant of the Year.",

That was tasty and the table side presentation was a nice touch. But it wasn't out of this world delicious.  I realize the yelp reviews for this place sing a different tune than I do, so maybe give the place a try and construct your opinion?   I, however, don't this I will be back.

For entree, I ordered their fried rainbow trout. Crispy skinned trout on top of jasmine rice with ginger and white wine vinegar.

    "text": "Black Sheep offers entertaining new flavors, a seasonal menu, and great service.  I RECOMMEND  Thai chili and lemongrass oysters -- They were surprisingly fresh and a great alternative to the more traditional tasting mignonette.   Smoky Heirloom Beet Salad -- I'm not even a fan of beets, but this salad turned me into a believer. I love how the earthiness of the beets and the creaminess of the goat cheese play off each other.   The Pan Seared Scottish King Salmon -- the entree was phenomenal. A perfect medium rare nestled atop of beautifully cooked forbidden rice, flavorful mushrooms, and sauce that balanced the meal perfectly. My boyfriend got the 8 oz. Grass Fed Ribeye, and while good, he was clearly jealous (and he's not even a fan of salmon)!  I'D SKIP The crispy Mediterranean octopus -- it was just okay, but the texture and flavor weren't nearly on par with the other items on the menu.  Salmon skin tacos (a close runner-up) -- It's an interesting concept, so it's something I'd order at least once just for the novelty of it.   OVERALL Black Sheep is one of my new favorite date night spots. Dimmed lighting sets the mood, the staff is friendly and helpful, and the food was both delicious and exciting.",

Luckily for us, we were good with sitting at the bar. Food is excellent - we started with the pork sausage buns and our main entree we had the pork and short ribs; both were so tender and flavorful. And for dessert we had the tres leches cake and the horchata brulee. The bartender was funny and entertaining! Highly recommend for a night out either with friends or on a date!",

I love supporting local businesses. We ordered the apricot green salad, trout, Vietnamese rolls, short ribs, and oysters - everything was delicious. The short ribs were incredible and the sauces on all dishes were amazing. Try the oysters with their cocktail sauce - so good and has some spice. We were stuffed by dessert but for sure will be back.

I went a while ago before the holidays around late Oct. Maybe the chef was out but everything we ordered was very bland. Almost like all the sauces where diluted.  We ordered a lot of items and i can only remeber liking one which where the shrimp eggrolls.  But even these where not amazing just better than the other dishes which ALL came out luke warm.  Not sure if that is how they intended but it seemed like it as everything was consistently boardering cold. but we ordered a 2nd egg roll which this time came out hot which made a huge differnce.  Again i wish i could remember more specifics of what we ordered but after the meal i really did just want to forget it ever happened.",

We were flying into town from the east coast for a long weekend and wanted to try this place because of a glowing review in the Washington Post. However, the restaurant called to inform me Wednesday that they were going to be closed on Sunday due to a family emergency and asked if there was another night that could work for us. The person who called, John, was so very gracious on the phone and was even willing to recommend other restaurants for us for Sunday night. Due to our packed schedule, we were only free Thursday night--the day we were all flying in. Since I wasn't sure what time the whole group could gather John said that they would accommodate us anytime once we landed. I am so glad we were able to dine here because this place rates five stars!  Service: We were seated right away upon arrival. John, the person who called me on the phone, came out to greet me and the rest of the group. He graciously offered us free appetizers or cocktails because of the inconvenience. Our waitress was very efficient and personable yet unobtrusive when it counted--refilling water or cocktails and taking away dishes without disturbing us. Everything she recommended was great!  Food: the group liked everything from the kitchen. For appetizers, we had the fried beef crisps, the Imperial rolls, salmon skin tacos and the grilled octopus. For entrees, the group ordered the rainbow trout, glass noodles, scallops, duck confit, and short ribs. For dessert, we dined on chocolate tres leches cake and lychee cheesecake. The presentation of the dishes was very impressive.   This was a very pleasant dining experience for my entire dinner party!",

Since I wasn't that hungry I went with the highly recommended beet salad which was delicious. The smoke flavoring on the beats was a fantastic twist.   We also ordered the sliders, unfortunately it only came with two. We could have eaten those all night long. We also ordered the short rib with cauliflower puree. That was excellent as well.

    "text": "This place was really, really good.  The menu is heavily Vietnamese-influenced, which is kind of nice but at the same time if you've had a lot of Vietnamese food, then the flavors aren't all that innovative.  We split five of the starters which made for a very nice meal for two.  Our first dish was the fried beef crisps which I imagined would be some sort of crispy beef jerky type concoction, however instead they were these lovely chicharron-like beef tendons.  My partner went nuts over these things!   Next, we had the salmon skin tacos which were filled with a lovely salmon tartare.  If anything, I wish that the salmon skin taco \"shells\" were somehow a little crispier, but they held up perfectly and made for a fantastic dish.  We also had the Vietnamese imperial rolls, which I basically selected just in case my partner didn't take to any of the other dishes.  These were pretty normal Vietnamese cha gio so while they were fine, they were easily the most boring dish ordered that night and I'd probably recommend that you get these at a normal Vietnamese restaurant if you want this dish.  We also had the poached bartlett pear salad which had a very large amount of dressing relative to the amount of greens, but still was a great salad.  The pear itself was poached whole, which is something that I had never seen before.   The poached pear was not only beautiful, but was still fairly firm which was a nice change from what I normally experience with poached pears.  I would have loved if they had an entree-sized version of that salad with way more greens.  The most disappointing dish was the spanish octopus.  While the octopus itself was tender, the dish on a whole was incredibly salty.  I actually didn't want to finish it but I always feel guilty about leaving animal proteins on the table because well...something did just give up its life for me so I might as well be respectful enough to actually eat it.  Las Vegas offers a ton of options whenever I visit so I'm not sure when I'll make it back here, but I guarantee that whenever I end up back here, I won't be mad.",

    "text": "TIP: Be sure to ASK for happy hour prices... $1 oysters are what drew me in and I found out later from my boyfriend, who paid, that they actually didn't honor the price- I'm sure it was an accident.   I thoroughly enjoyed The Black Sheep. My boyfriend and I popped in after deciding that we were just too tired from the work week to cook at home.   Walking in the expectations are already set high. The room is beautiful. The menu is easy to read and the cocktails are unique and perfectly balanced.  I want to come back, sit at the bar and drink some wine hike I make my way through the small plates.   The service was perfectly executed, it's clear that the staff works as a team. I come from fine dining so this is something that I truly appreciate.  The Black Sheep won't last long where it's at- they're going to need more room!",

    "text": "A small restaurant in an intimate atmosphere with a modern, and rustic feel.  The Black Sheep has been getting rave reviews, so we decided to pay this restaurant a visit today. I made reservations for 6 and I recommend doing that.  We got there to catch their early Happy Hour which runs from 5-6 pm with $5 wine, $4 craft beers, and $1 fresh oysters on the half shell.  There's also a late 10-11 pm Happy Hour for the night owls.  Here's some of the breakdown of the plates my bf and I shared.  Vietnamese Imperial Rolls - the server mentioned this is the customers favorite. It was fried but the sauces were well- balanced.  Bao Sliders - This is our favorite. The combination of pork sausage and jalapeno aioli was flavorful and juicy, and the crispiness of the shallot was perfect. I loved the fried quail egg that was paired with!   Crispy Mediterranean Octopus - It was good, just not anything special. Doesn't stand out in comparison to the other octopus at other restaurants in my opinion. It would be better not fried.  Chocolate Tres Leches were a little done. The chocolate was overwhelming at first, but then with a little fresh Tres leches butter it all came together and was quite good as a spread.  I wished they had more deserts but this is the only one they had.   The service was excellent, fast, friendly and efficient.  I am a pretty picky eater, all the food have to be excellent to get a 5 stars rating, I would give a 3.5 on the food but because everything else like the ambiance, music, and service were really pleasant, the place deserves a 4 star. Everyone else in our tables were really pleased on the food they order and we had a great time here.",

The Black Sheep advertises itself as a cocktail and wine bar however very limited wine selection by the glass. The cocktails were innovative however extremely weak. I ordered a vodka martini and it tasted more like olive water than anything else.   The interior is super cute, chic and reminds me of a  restaurant I would find in San Diego. The food and service was pretty good - no complaints there.   I think this place has major potential however I was not overly impressed and most likely wouldn't return. There are better dining options on the southwest side of town with better selections.",

Except the server tonight. She's very nice but I think she's making a decision to my drink. We ordered 2 margarita, and our 1st margarita have no salt. So I asked her why no salt? She said uhmm cuz all people doesn't like salt but I can put salt on side. I was like in my mind ohhh I always order margarita and always with salt no salt is by request only. But I did not say anything so we ordered another another one  with salt, I guess you have to tell her with or without salt. So we got our drink when our food almost done, so after everything we got our check, it's on the bills $2 charge for no salt and $2 for salt?! I'm like what it's that??? So I asked her, she said ohhh because we put extra shot for margarita.. I told her I don't even ask extra shot on it all I said margarita. Please next time let us know before putting extra shot on it. So we still ended up pay for it even she's making a decision to my drink. Everything was well I think server have to ask the guest first before she make decision for my drink, I think she's the one who want to drink it.",

Important to me is they were knowlegable in all the dishes, thus able to advise according to my pallete and their personal pallette.   Servicescape looks like a very mordern bar/restairant meets barn. Very cool.  To what matters most to me...THE FOOD! I order family style to make sure I have a well rounded opinion of a restaurants food.   I highly recommend quite a few things... My top favs...  Appitizers:  1)Beef Crisps -new concept to me its playful and delicious play on a personal food favorite chicharrones. Subtle but you can taste the  beef flavor and a popcorn-like airy goodness. 2)Spring Rolls - I slept on this the first night but thanks to the waitors advice I got to taste a home run. Ill get this every time. Its a unike flavor that you will just need to try, and far from the traditional spring roll flaovr... They are Addicting.  Mains: 1)Salmon Clay Pot: Umami! Scent, sight, taste, its all there. I love when great tasting food is also healthy! The arouma of the smoke puts you in a happy place before you even take the first delicious bites. 2) Duroc Pork: Totally uniqie flavor from all the dishes. I need a bigger vocab to be able to describe the flavor. Felt vietnamese/thai in taste with the acidity. Nothing sweet about it. Savory lovers. It was just so good.  3) Whole fish: Meaty, Crispy. Flaky. It reminds me of a carribean esqeviche. Its very light for being fried. So good!  Drinks:  I didnt have any but there is a special black sheep beer drink that sounds like a big winner! Ask your server!  Ill update my review after 3rd visit. Can't wait!",

They were all very fresh, tasty and cooked perfectly.  The cocktails did not disappoint either, their coffee martini is the bomb.

    "text": "Perhaps the reviews I read on here prior to visiting the Black Sheep raised my expectations a tad too much.   CUSTOMER SERVICE: Let's start with good ol customer service, I'd say the staff in general were all very friendly. Pretty basic and nobody is going to go the extra mile if not need be, and I get that. I went to black sheep on a very busy Friday night, with my mom who has severe back problems, when we walked in all the tables were taken so we sat at the bar. However I made it clear to the host we needed a table so my mom could be comfortable, my wishes were acknowledged. About 15 minutes later, two tables clear up, I'm confident they're gonna move us to a table, they cleaned them off and everything. Still nothing, so finally, after 10 mins of staring at the empty tables, we spoke up, asked about being seated at an open table... and apparently this was unheard of to the host. Come on dude this isn't a ground breaking idea here... that left me a tad bit confused. But we were moved.  GRADE: C+  FOOD: So after I had to fight for a table, I'm thinking \"okay the foods gonna be bomb though \" so who cares about anything else. Started off with their octopus appetizer, which was easily the best and maybe one of the more creative ways I've had octopus, fried up perfectly, on a tangy curry sauce. Also had an apple salad which was a bit bland to me, just had greens, cranberries, and dressing..needed some more to it, maybe cucumbers? Both my mother and I were in the mood for steaks so we got the two different cuts provided. I had the flank steak dish which comes with rice (I'm not crazy about rice) I asked to possibly substitute my rice with... wait for it... POTATOES! Absolutely unheard of right?! When I asked the waitor looked at me like I was crazy so he explained \"the chef doesn't normally change her dishes for anybody buy I'll ask\" I knew then it wasn't gonna happen. So I took the rice, since this MASTERFUL dish was created this way by the chef. Here I get my steak and rice (it's as stupid as it sounds) and this I will say...  the PRESENTATION at the Black sheep is STELLAR, if you like to take pics of your food this place is pic friendly.  Back to my steak and rice, with greens on the side... it was average at best, I'm gonna go on a limb and say the presentation got more attention than the flavor of the dish itself. I'm still trying to figure out what about this dish was so concrete that the rice  (served aside) couldn't be substituted. I actually thing my Brownstone cocktail (cube of torched brown sugar garnished with thyme) was more mind blowing.  GRADE : C+  Atmosphere : Last but certainly not least, located in a pretty busy plaza when you go inside the Black Sheep you certainly forget the outside. Great decor and music make you want to take a seat, the only downside is the actual space in the restaurant. But it's great for a date night since its dimmed lights and cozy. Really nice place to grab a drink.   Overall, I feel this restaurant is decent. Whether its HANDS DOWN better than SkinnyFats or Plantones (both in the same plaza) is debatable to me. I'll choose Other Mama and Elia over this restaurant because your going to have virtually the same experience but better food.",

Music is the best at any local restaurant that I've ever heard. Beers are always changing if that is your type of thing. Wines are reasonable and will not break the bank. Atmosphere is 5.5. Her and her team created dishes that are social media friendly and give you something to talk about on Monday morning with your coworkers. There isn't anything about this restaurant that I would change except I wish it was closer to Chinatown where I hang out. =)",

    "text": "Oh, no, here I go being an outlier, again.  I do not enjoy being the maverick, you know.  I much prefer it when I love the places that everyone loves, and hate the places that everyone hates (or finds \"bleh.\")  But though most people really enjoy their food here, it left me a little cold.   But let's put this in context: For the food the night we were there, it was a 2.5.  For the atmosphere, ambience, and service, a 5.  Thus, the average is 3.  First, the food.  We ordered raw oysters on the half shell, the octopus (grilled), and the Karage chicken as appetizers, along with craft cocktails, including the \"Sunburn\" drink which is tasty.  The oysters were quite tiny!  And they were overpowered by the lemongrass sauce.  And it did not gel well with the tomato-based cocktail sauce which was also offered.  It made the seafood taste too sweet and unbalanced.  The octopus, we didn't understand would be sooo spicy.  I don't mind heat, but it threw us off.  The body of the meat was also not as tender as I was expecting, and I thought the polenta bar (or whatever it was) was a bit too hard.  I didn't try the Karage chicken, but the way my friend was eating it, made me think she didn't like it much.    Same for the entrees when they came.  My whole fish, Trout, was terrific! Truly a stand-out.  BUT, it was swamped and overpowered by some overly, aggressively seasoned greens (red chard, perhaps) that really competed with the fish.  I had to rely heavily on the side of white rice (which was nice) to counteract it.  I mean, those greens were salty! Were they trying to get us to order more drinks? You just have to ask, guys.  And I felt bad for my dining companion, who ordered the short rib, but asked for salt and pepper, and then abandoned eating it and put her napkin in the dish.  Dessert was okay.  I got the apple bread pudding with ice cream.  Thank goodness for the ice cream.  Otherwise, it would have been way too cloying.  The pudding was more like a cake, and was too sweet and dense for my liking.  I tasted the apple, but it gave off \"candied apple,\" to me, which is not a sophisticated flavor profile.  My friend got the chocolate cake which looked like the top of a bird's nest...so interesting!  (Did they borrow from the presentation that I have seen pictured from \"Rose. Rabbit. Lie\" by chance?)  But the taste was a bit off.  My pal just did not seem to enjoy it and only picked at it.  I tried it, and thought it was more of a cool concept than an enjoyable dessert.  The coffees (\"Americanos\") we ordered were fine, but a bit bitter; I would have preferred a straight cappuccino.  But we were offered only \"Espresso\" or \"Americano.\"  Second, though, the ambience of the place is cool.  The black and white photographic mural is gorgeous, as is the wall of off-white empty frames.  Very on trend.  The service is superior.  Our server was solid (except for describing some dishes, and letting us know about the spice level of the octopus).  All of the staff (and manager, who came over) made us feel very welcome and special.  We had no complaints there whatsoever.  I will give this place another chance.  I really wanted to like its inventive food.  Maybe it was just an off night.  Plus, I understand that they change their menu from time to time.   I will re-review if I have more success with the next rotation.",

    "text": "Finally had a chance to dine at Eater's 2017 Restaurant of the Year with a menu from the Chef of the Year.  It was a spectacular and enjoyable meal that begs for a return visit.  Actually came in on a whim, being in the area on a Friday night.  The parking is free, but the lot is small.  We walked in and were lucky to have been seated, as the entire dining area and bar were occupied - next time I'll make a reservation.  Also, try to keep parties small because, though the tables and chairs can be rearranged, the atmosphere better suited to intimate parties.    The very dim lighting stood out to me a lot.  I was able to read the menu, but others may not have it so easy.  Even the food, it was so dark that aesthetics of the plate and any vibrant colors were missed from being blacked out by shadows.  Starting out with an appetizer we went for the Thai Basil Shrimp Ceviche ($12).  It was delicious, fresh, and light.  A few bites that're great for sharing with a friend.  It is also one of the most popular dishes as per our server (I also saw it on neighboring tables around us).  When it came to the entree, I couldn't decide between the Pork Belly and the Confit, but our knowledgeable server told me that the menu changes with the season and as Summer is wrapping up, the Lemongrass Duck Confit ($25) will be removed.  The duck came out served in a large bowl.  The tender bone-in meat with crispy skin rested on top of a layer of couscous, broccoli, and sausage.  It was really a filling dish and did not disappoint at all.  Being off the Strip, it was nice to dine at a place in the neighborhood that felt like a high end Vegas-style restaurant.",

    "text": "The Black Sheep is always busy! I finally was able to check them out and have to say the best part of everything was our server Hunter who really knew the menu and gave great suggestions. This Asian influenced spot wasn't what I expected food wise but definitely in a good way.  We had a few of their signature cocktails which were all delicious:  the brownstone has a brown sugar ice cube that melts as you sip. La Flama Blanca is very refreshing. We also had a black manhattan and the Rosita.  The oysters at The Black Sheep were the best oysters I've had in awhile. They have three offerings for toppings but I thought they were best plain. I did like the granita which was very sweet.  We did order a variety of appetizers and entrees and My recommendations on what I'd order again are the octopus, beef crisps, and the pork belly dish.  The octopus was very tender and delicious. It was not rubbery at all. I've never had octopus cooked to this almost fish like consistency before.  The beef crisps were phenomenal. I could snack on these forever or until my arteries explode. They get doused with a spicy and acidic sauce that makes every bite different.   My favorite entree was the pork belly. It looked very unassuming: a bunch of little carrots surrounding this hunk of bland looking pork belly next to some red noodles. This was really good though! The pork belly was tender and the noodles went there with the spice.  Some other dishes I'd pass on that we got were the duck prosciutto salad and the duck confit. I thought the duck prosciutto was okay. It really needed something tart or sweet as the strawberries didn't really add to it. The duck confit was just overwhelmingly sweet without other flavors.  We also got the cherries jubilee dessert which was a miss. It was overwhelmingly bitter with not enough balance. I think they should have burned more of the alcohol out before dousing the dessert with it.  Overall the good dishes, great cocktails, and amazing service made up for the couple of dishes we didn't enjoy. The service was great. We had our plates and silverware changed multiple times and our waters were always topped off.   I did only do four stars because of some of the mix ups. I'd recommend they really go for it with their use of Asian flavors they use. We had their Thai shrimp ceviche and it definitely had no Thai remnants in my opinion. It looked beautiful and the shrimp were nicely prepared but It tasted just like regular ol ceviche which was just okay.  It was a beautiful to look at but really just tasted like lime. The dish that really was good was the pork belly because it went there! It was super spicy but in the best way possible.",

    "text": "How do we rate the food, when the bill came through and the restaurant charged us $2 for \"Rocks?\"     I've been told that the $2 is a standard surcharge for anything on the rocks.  I'm trying to rationalize the fact that they charged me $12 for one drink, then added $2 extra for \"Extra pour\".  Listen we got one ounce, and that's it.  I am just trying to rid this ridiculous way of charging customers.   It's Just another way to make a buck !!!   I truly have no issues paying more  If we actually had more liquor in our glass, and if our sever advised us that our one drink would now be $14.    Suggestion, charge $14 for the drink instead of $12, and let the new price absorb the $2 \"Rock\".   It really makes the restaurant search for profit, and puts your guests in an unfortunate position.     Regarding our meal.  The food  was good, and the deserts were excellent.     We did not have a reservation as it was a Wednesday,  the host recommended we sit at the bar and wait as all tables were spoken for.  But within a few minutes  somehow a table was available.  We were confused on what happened, as we just about to order a drink.  During the night the restaurant did not \"Sell Out\".  Again, suggestion, treat your guests as \"A guest\", make us feel welcome from the beginning.  We felt that we were more of an annoyance.   We are locals and did take the time to travel to your establishment.   OpenTable says Las Vegas currently has over 2278 restaurants, what makes The Black Sheep stand out?   Hmmmm!  I have visited The Black sheep a few times.   I don't know if we will return.   The prices are now getting similar to strip prices.",

The imperial roll, was definitely my favorite.  Steak tartare was served on top of chicharrones -you can't go wrong with a salty crunch. The hot chicken was similar to boneless buffalo chicken wings but served with honey toast. If you're a fan of sweet and savory, then this is for you. My favorite dishes were the entrees. The scallops with kabocha polenta was Amazing!! Each bite was filled with so much flavor. The glass Vietnamese noodles, were just as delightful. It was mixed in with brussel sprouts, baby carrots and a sweet and spicy sauce. Unfortunately, the salmon skin tacos weren't available, which broke my heart since I love salmon belly. I will have to go back and try it. Overall, great fusion food with tasty drinks!",

    "text": "A great disappointment. We had very high hopes as we love to support local establishments but this was a dreadful experience.  We were overcharged on drinks. Our server was clearly annoyed that we were ordering multiple appetizers(we'd never been and wanted to try out a bunch of items). When I say annoyed, imagine your teen huffing and puffing because they are told they can't go to the movies (eye-rolling, the aforementioned huffing, and arm crossing). We literally felt bad about being there, as if we were an inconvenience. I didn't get it as the items were all coming out at basically the same time and the total was far higher than if we'd each just had one entree. The food itself was bland with the exception of one item. It was apparent that the chef was really trying but maybe we just were there on an off night.  So the overcharging on the drinks was annoying but we didn't realize that until we were given the bill and at that point, I didn't want to deal with the server again so we just paid the thing and got out of there. This would have been a three-star except for the server. He really made a negative impression on us and we'll never go there again.",

I ordered the grilled octopus, the NY strip special, and the cherries jubilee brownie.   This takes me back to the \"hipster\" term. I've found places like these try to be fancy with the dishes when the star of the dish ends up getting lost with all the flavors.   The octopus was lost in the sambal and the crispy rice that I couldn't tell what part was actually the octopus. The AMAZING dry aged steak was murdered with XO sauce that I literally scraped it off and put it to the side and actually saw another table do the same! They give you a piece not in sauce at all (photo included) and I could've just ate it happily like that. The brownie was unfortunately a little too hard our server gave us a steak knife to get in there.   The place is really good, but it's just too fancy for me. I like the meat to be the star and not all the craziness going on. I believe in less is more, but who knows I might make my way back to try other items as I'm told they change the menu often.",

    "text": "Saw a great Yelp rating and thought this would be a slam dunk.  For weeks, i assumed this eatery would impress the fam bam.  We ordered a bunch of apps to get a sample size of their flavors.  Imperial rolls - these were good but to give you perspective, Hawaii's Rice Place is vastly superior. Fried beef crisps..  same look & feel like a bag of pork rinds.  They are unique, I give it that much.  Perhaps it's the presentation, plating is plain. Salmon skin tacos...  sounded good on paper but missed on execution.  We ordered six and left three on the table. Ahi tartare...  tartare on their beef crisps.  Feels like it is missing something.  Add more to the recipe and you may have a winner. Crispy octopus was tender and delish.  My favorite app! Kim chi chicken karaage.  This was OK.  To be fair, we asked the kitchen to separate the spiciness on the side.  The dish likely works best when the chicken is cooked in their secret sauce.  Apps and entrees were like night & day.  The entrees were really good!  Wife had the short rib.  I had the seared scallops.  Mom had lamb.  All of those entrees were well plated and visually beautiful!  Flavor was also on point!  Main entrees rescued the underwhelming appetizers.  Our server was from Mililani and was patient with us.  He was fantastic!  Took time to explain in detail what his favorite dishes are and also thoroughly answered our question.  Great customer service!  Give this man a raise!  Again, to be fair, my party had diet restrictions--no spicy food.  Their menu is full of spicy dishes.  I wish I knew my family's food aversions before selecting this restaurant.",

For walking in for the very first time tonight, we cannot express our ultimate respect and gratitude for what just happened in the last 2 hours. First and foremost, thank you to the bar, management, front of house and back of house team. As one unit, you are incredible to say the least. Ambiance A+++. Cute, intimate, and down to earth With that said... Let's proceed.   Drinks: perfectly and eloquently made by the main man MAX! \"Mr. Brownstone,\" \"Vietnamese coffee martini,\" and \"Rosita\" were completely delectable. Just watching him create was an appetizer with the drinks being the main course.   Food: Kumiai oysters with Thai chili and lemongrass granita- fresh, clean, salty and sweet. You'll want to take the sauce home.  Salmon skin tacos: 2 salmon skin tacos (literally) stuffed with salmon belly, Tabiko , shishito peopers and cilantro. Perfectly balanced crispy and juicy explosion in your mouth.  Fried beef crisps: beef tendons stretched and dried, then deep fried and dusted with Thai chili takin and chili lime. So fresh, hot, flakey and popping.  Grilled Spanish octopus: Chinese broc, crispy rice block, ginger sambal sauce and frisee salad. I've read some say it's chewy or rubbery. It's octopus people! Know it, love it, understand it. It changes with how it's prepared so if you love octopus, you'll love this here. Full of flavor and complex with just a little kick.  Vietnamese crepes: braised duroc pork belly, crispy pig ear salad, sprouts, and garlic vinaigrette. This was the killer. Recommended by DANNY, (the manager, server, host, busser, runner, definition of customer service) this dish was to die for. Came out first and will forever leave a lasting memory.   The descriptors for taste and value are weak. We know that. Why that is? It's because the menu changes every few months and if you don't go RIGHT NOW, it won't be available. The goal is to inspire you all to check it out. Judge for yourself but at least don't sleep on this personal invitation. Executive Chef JAMIE TRAN is a force to be reckoned with. If only I had been able to peel her away from the kitchen tonight to praise her for her talent and devotion... She is an artist and a mastermind. We wannnnnna take her home and feed her skittles.  Shout out to the ones not mentioned. Everyone was amazing and we can't wait to meet and greet soon.  - keep on keepin on!",

    "text": "I always love trying to restaurants when I'm in town. My friend told me about this New American restaurant with Vietnamese influence - Black Sheep so we decided to give it a try.   The decor of this restaurant is so different and unique. Love the huge wall with the decorative places. There is a good sized bar and enough tables to accommodate large parties. Our bartender was a sweetheart and I loved that she recommended her favorite dishes because every single one of them did not disappoint.   We tried a variety of drinks however my favorite was the \"La Flama Blanca\" - great choice for those who like a little spicy.   My other favorite drink was the Green Lightning - Matcha tea infused gin. I'm not usually a gin drinker but this really hit the spot.   For food: Oysters - must get because on top of the oyster is a lemongrass Thai chili kind of jelly that's just so different - it's like an explosion of flavor in my mouth.   Ahi tuna tar tar - 3 pieces, the tuna was well marinated and the texture was silky smooth on top of the crispy rice.   Vietnamese Imperial Roll - 4 pieces of spring roll deep fried. The inside is pork and shrimp and it's extra extra crispy which I love.   Bao Sliders - who doesn't love the white fluffy bun? It's a pork sausage patty and the jalopeno aioli was so good I wanted to ask for an extra side of the sauce. The lotus chips are very thinly slices and crispy.   Rainbow Trout - my FAVORITE dish. Don't worry about the bones because chef de-bones it for you. The sauce is to die for. It's a ginger and rice vinegar sauce and I'm going to be dreaming about it for forever because I would like to make this sauce at home.   And finally for dessert, this chocolate brownie madness - I forget what it's called but the cake is so moist and on top of that, they drizzle condensed milk all over. One bite and I wanted the plate to myself. This is not for sharing. Everyone needs to get their own.   I'm definitely telling my friends about this restaurant and I'm coming back here every time I visit vegas. Thank you Black Sheep!!",

We arrived around 6 and they only had 2 other tables and a few people at the bar. We seated immediately, our server got us water and took our drink orders immediately. He explained the menu and made recommendations, food came out pretty quickly and he came back to check-in our us regularly. Towards the end of our meal was then they got busy, the restaurant filled up and it was clear they were under-staffed. I asked for a soda re-filled and waited about 15 minutes until I got it, we just asked for the check and left. Even though service lacked a little towards the end I would say service was really good. The 3 start is for the food.   Presentation was excellent, very instagram worthy. I think they have unique ideas and concepts but lacked flavors in my opinion.   Oysters - We got them with the spicy cocktail sauce which I liked and the Thai chili granita which I did not care for. But my biggest issue with these oysters as that they were very warm, like a couple degrees above room temperature. I am not an oyster expert or anything but I have always had oysters cold...these were so warm they feel like eating cheap Chinese buffet oysters. That totally killed the dish for me.   Crisply Octopus - Love the idea of fried octopus and really liked the curry sauce that came with it but the octopus itself was too tough and hard to eat. It is very lightly breaded but too tough to eat, doesn't have have chewy sharpness that octopus usually has.   Bao Sliders - These were so cute to look at! The buns were fluffy and sweet, love the quail egg on top, but even with the pork sausages and the aioli it tasted very bland. The flavors did not pop at all, I tasted the slight sweetness of the buns and the slight saltiness of the sausages, no strong flavor to hold everything together.   Salmon Clay Pot - Extremely disappointed with this dish. Big and delicous piece of salmon...the only good thing about the dish. The eggplant and the farro were so bland..none of us liked this dish. If they had some sauces on top or on the side that would have helped. Salmon is bland on its own, the farro and eggplant added to the blandness.   Duroc Pork Belly and Slow Cooked Short Rib - These two dishes were delicious. The meats melts in your mouth, so soft and sweet. Strong flavors, love the sticky rice that came with the pork belly. Very impressed with these two.   So out of the 3 appetizers and 3 main dishes I only enjoyed the two main dishes. I think this place has potential, they have interesting ideas but I think they need to work on adding more flavors to their dishes. Most of the dishes were bland and just did not satisfy my appetite as much as I would have liked.",

Music was a little intense and kinda loud. Noise level was high.   We came on a Wednesday just before 9p. The place was full. It's small with about 50 seats total. So we waited about 10 minutes for a table.   We were seated by the door. The table was very wobbly. The server said he'd do something about it but he never did. My son had to keep his foot on the table stand throughout our meal. The server was nice but not very personable or attentive.   The appetizers were hit and miss. Wings were delicious but we didn't care for the hamachi crudo or the sliders. Hamachi was bland and the sliders had a weird off putting taste to it.   Our entrees were a lot better. We had the trout, pork Belly and braised short ribs. All the dishes were flavorful. My favorite was the trout.   My husband ordered old fashioned and he loved it. They have a pretty decent wine list. I wasn't drinking that night so I didn't try anything. We'll be back soon to give it another shot. Maybe come for their oyster special happy hour.",

Super fresh and satisfying.  I never had an old fashioned until The Black Sheep.  I will say this, their version has me hooked.  Love this place!",

    "text": "Entering the restaurant comes with a very modern feel to an otherwise unnoticeable lot. Down the plaza from SkinnyFats, a Las Vegas highlight, the restaurant invites a more intimate crowd; black being the covering most of the restaurant's corners.   Greeted by the host and promptly seated, the service was quick to introduce the menu which consisted of a small but select menu. Unfortunately by no fault of the staff, the restaurant soon became overwhelmed. The full house caused the two waiters and single host to continually divide their attention: I was only able to see the waiter upon ordering and delivering my food, leaving the small glass of water I had continually empty.   Of the appetizers they had offered I selected the oysters and the sliders. Las Vegas has a plethora of Japanese, Vietnamese, and other Asian fusion that offer oysters; the Black Sheep's was about average at best. The salinity of the oysters were its biggest turnoff (Other than calling Sriracha a \"Rooster Cock Hot Sauce\"). The sliders, while small, do pack a delicious bite (Literally one bite).   My entree was excellent; the slow roasted short ribs upon gnocchi and ratatouille was nothing short of what I had expected from the location. The tangy entree is very balanced and fulfilling. My two dining guests and the hanger steak and the pork belly. While the hanger steak was presented beautifully with the corn, the steak was incredibly average. Though tender, the taste resembled $3 midnight steak from South Point; not bad per say, just not to the quality of flavor that the price point equivocates. The starch pairing with the dish was fantastic however. The Pork Belly tasted about as good as it looks.  The saving grace of the restaurant came from their Tres Leches dessert. The flavors were excellent, playing with a variance of levels of sweetness.  The place essentially gets a three stars due to a myriad of issues. While the place is decent for a meal, I simply did not enjoy the flavors presented in several of their dishes. The server, while incredibly kind and engaging, didn't have enough staff to help him work. Even after hanging in my card for payment, I had to wait an additional 4-5 minutes for it to be swiped out. I really wanted to like the place, unfortunately I can't.",

    "text": "Hm I was pretty excited to check out black sheep when some friends told me about it.   Online pictures of their menu looked pretty good and promising at first to us.  We came around happy hour times at 5:00pm and ordered a couple oysters to start off. I'm very..ehem, VERY picky when it comes to oysters. If I get a tint of fishy taste I don't think I really enjoy them at all. Especially after having such an amazing fresh oyster experience in San Francisco, I just can't seem to find a place as good.  The oysters at black sheep aren't the most perfect ones, they're mediocre id say, but the thing I didn't like about them is that they were really salty; probably because they sit in a bed of salt for presentation. But it really distracted me from enjoying their sauces or really much of anything., even when I tried to rinse them off with my water.  Next I also tried the whole trout. The char is pretty good and has a nice flavor sauce on it. It was probably the best part of the dish, but I felt the trout didn't taste as fresh as I was initially expecting. It sort of had a little bit of a frozen fish taste to it. But it wasn't bad I suppose overall. It also comes served with a bowl of rice and in a pretty decent sized portion for what you pay.  A friend of mine ordered the chocolate cake dessert towards the end of our meal. It had a decent flavor and wasn't too sweet which is a nice touch considering that chocolate can be overwhelmingly sweet at times, but I felt the texture was a little hard for a cake. I guess I was expecting a more soft and moist cake,so it was very different.  The last thing I remember trying was one of their cocktails which isn't offered on happy hour, called the sunburn. This was probably one of my favorite orders. It had a nice light refreshing taste and very present grapefruit citrus note. It's nice and sweet for a summer sipper.  Our service was pretty good as well, both our host and server were polite in refilling our water cups and the owner came back to check up on us and inform us about their menu maybe 3-4 times.  I felt black sheep was a pretty good place to try if you've never experienced it, but taste wise I didn't really think it was all there for me unfortunately.",

The cocktails are yummy and we ordered 4 appetizers and a couple oysters rather than ordering 2 entrees because everything looked so good and we wanted to try different flavors.  The salmon skin tacos and smoked octopus are insanely good.    I will definitely be back here on my next vegas trip!!!!",

We were greeted or shall I say \"ungreeted\" by who we later learned was the manager.  Told that they were not quite open yet, they were still setting up, the bar was not ready so told to leave and come back in 10 minutes.   She also asked if we had a reservation which we did not.  She acted like it was an imposition for us to be there.   We left and debated going in but decided that after going out of our way to go there for HH oysters and then dinner, we'd go in.   Interesting as there were only two other tables taken while we were there.   Worse after ordering, told they stopped the HH oysters a month ago.   We had checked on the web to confirm their HH time before going in!   They told us it's no longer on their website.   The host and our waitress were pleasant but not sure if we'd go back or ever recommend this place again.",

    "text": "Excellent inventive dishes, unique taste.  A meal that is just a party for your mouth... And fairly healthy as well!  We had: Starters -salmon skin tacos (get these! We had 2 orders - they are small, but plated so well and amazingly tasty!) -Vietnamese imperial (pork and shrimp spring) rolls (great flavor combination, served in a bed of frisee salad)- no dipping sauce, but none needed -octopus (excellent spicy sauce with asparagus and brilliant plating) -bao sliders (so tasty, quail egg and aioli adding great moisture- bun is nothing special, but that wasn't why we ordered the sliders anyway)  Entrees -salmon entree (tasted fine, but not my favorite of the night.  The accompaniments- red quinoa, tomato, a green were tasty -slow cooked short rib (so tender, with just a few (wish there were more!) kimchi cucumbers, and dumplings)  Desserts -warm brownie with marshmallow, chocolate, raspberry, pecans (which is sort of a deconstructed brownie- brownie with marshmallow on top and the other parts are scattered around the plate and your goal is to eat a bite with all the components- quite nice!) -Tres Leches with Vietnamese icing and regular white icing on the side (not nearly as sweet or chocolatey as the other dessert, but lovely and simple and a nice ending to a fine meal)  Highly recommended.  We booked reservations weeks in advance as we read about Jamie Tran and didn't want to miss her in action during a recent visit to Vegas.  Now I look forward to following her in the future.  Price point is very affordable- most starters are ~$8-12 and many entrees ~$23.  Don't miss this restaurant- well worth coming off the strip.  Or if you are a local, you're just lucky... go and enjoy her culinary genius tonight! (And then again tomorrow, because I would!)  Congratulations Jamie- you are most definitely a playful rebel in the culinary world and you've gained several fans tonight!  Thanks for the show! (Please come to the Bay Area of CA soon!)",

The bao was so soft and fluffy and the whole thing was like a mini gourmet high quality egg mcmuffin..  Braised Duroc Pork Belly - Fire....it was juicy and savory and had that umami quality with the earthiness below it and the fluffiness and light air quality on top.   Scottish King Salmon 'Clay Pot' - This was a pretty well executed dish with the salmon being extra smooth and melt in your mouth type salmon.  There are a lot of other dishes on the menu that we are looking to try so we will most def come back soon!",

My wife got the Rib-eye.....hands down it made my flank steak taste like a new cook had made it. The waiter (Shepherd....no joke.....that's his name) told us the rib-eye was better, but I wanted for us not to try more than one thing.   Now the last name of the Chef is Tran....so we were educated enough to think their may well be some Asian flair with our food. We were not disappointed!!!!  As I said. Flank steak is great. The Rib-eye is stunning. One of the best Rib-eyes I have ever had. The meat was perfectly cooked.....the sauce and sides to this....sun-choke.... yum.....slayed me. Shepherd says that the pork belly beats the Rib-eye......next time.   We had an extra glass each of the Malbec with dessert. Fantastic finish.   Please go if you're hungry and in the area. This place is fantastic and I'm a little ticked cause we used to live round the corner.   Not going to stop us going back though, even though it's farther afield.",

We arrived at the door mid-week 6:30-ish and walked into a half empty restaurant. We waited and were finally acknowledged with a snooty \"do you have reservations?\"  Um no but we were just 2 and, again there were ALOT of empty tables. The \"Host\" made us feel almost guilty for not having reservations, huffed and looked around the room. After a few awkward minutes we were shown to (literally) the table just to put left (against the wall with one seat at the door). We reviewed the menus and waited. While we waited I looked around and realized we could be the parents (if not worse) of anyone in the establishment (patrons or staff)   Our server was very accommodating with recommendations and we obliged with most of those. Again the food was good but the portion sizes are on the light side (especially for what you are paying).    What infuriated me the most (and keeps this rating as low as it is) is the fact that the majority of the empty tables remained so throughout our meal and yet we were made to feel guilty or an imposition for arriving without a reservation.",

    "text": "We finally came here late last night.  I'd been wanting to try the food here, Vietnamese fusion.  I remember it was a poke bowl spot that didn't last longer than 6 months.  I have to say, I think it's the location and not the right type(poke bowl) for this plaza.    Last night my husband wanted to eat somewhere before 10 PM.  I was browsing OpenTable and saw that The Black Sheep was still open and only a mile from our house.  I booked it and we came within 15-20 minutes.  Since I booked our table online, when we walked the guy at the front asked me by my first name.  Attentive service since we walked in.  We both really like the vibe here, dim lighting and the music.  Love the decor and how clean it is.  The server was very knowledgable of their dishes with all the ingredients.  This is very helpful for food allergy people.  We ordered a lot of appetizers and one entree.    SALMON SKIN TACOS (I liked it, husband didn't, he thought the skin was weird.) AHI TUNA TARTARE (We both loved it, fresh, simple.) VIETNAMESE IMPERIAL ROLLS (Liked the presentation, but not much flavors, only the strong pickled veggies..it was salty and too sweet for us.) CRISPY MEDITERRANEAN OCTOPUS (We'll have to try this dish again next time.  The way the server describe it to us, it came out differently.  They took care of this dish for us.  To me it was little chewy, like only battered.  I couldn't really taste the octopus, very char tasting like burnt.  We ate most of it, trying to figure out the ingredients in it.  The curry sauce was super thick, lots of cumin in it.)  FRIED WHOLE RAINBOW TROUT (My husband thinks this dish was ok.  I personally really liked it.  I didn't eat the stuff under the fish, since I'm allergic to soy.  The minimum the soy intake the better for me.  The fried fish part really reminds me of my mother's home cooked dish. It's simple and tasty.)  I had the common law cocktail, it was good, little too sweet for me though.  If I end up getting this one again, I'll ask for less sweeten.  Overall, I'm happy with our choices.  Looks like a great spot to come grab drinks at the bar.  We're looking forward to come here again.",

I'm not really a bread pudding guy but Black Sheep's was top notch and I'd order it again.  Were all the dishes social media friendly, creative and tasty? Absolutely yes.  Were the serving sizes on the smaller side for the price leaving me still hungry after the meals ?  Absolutely yes.  Would I still come back and try more tasty dishes because it's also a cool scene.

Love when a owner wears all the hats.  Every single thing I put in my mouth at the Black Sheep, I loved. Some of the most unique, flavorful, and satisfying dishes I have ever had. I'm hungry just thinking about it. Ended up going a second time two weeks later - please note that I don't even live in Vegas but will go out of my way when I'm in town to eat here.  Appetizers: - Steak Tartare - incredible and fun prezo - Ahi Tuna Crudo - delicious. Served over a delicious gazpacho. - Black Sheep 'Hot Chicken' - holy shit. Just order it. Wow. - Bao Sliders - my least favorite of the appetizers but still incredible - Vietnamese Imperial Rolls - must. Get.  Entrees: - Lemongrass Duck Confit - one of the most delicious medleys of food I've ever had. The couscous is to DIE for - Slow Braised Short Rib  Wine: Riva Leone, Barbaresco Piemonte  And whiskey shots with Chef Jamie of course.",

You are missing out on so much fun flavor and fun dishes.  The salmon skin tacos are perfect, they have inspired me to actually cook more with salmon skin.  Also, the short rib is out of this world, nice and tender with a punch of flavor.  Cheers to Black sheep for the amazing food, service, and atmosphere.  I will be back.",

I personally wasn't a fan because I felt like every dish we ordered had both sweet and savory comfort style flavors. One bite was enough for me with each plate! But that's just my opinion! I know tons of people that think otherwise!! And once again, in my opinion, the cost for the flavor was not entirely worth it, but I'm glad we tried it because we heard great things about this place!   Just because it wasn't my cup of tea, doesn't mean this review should sway anybody! Unless you're like me and prefer sweet and savory apart on separate plates",

They draw inspiration from Vietnamese, to Thai, and even Korean flavors. Additionally, I love how the restaurant looks inside. This year Black sheep has a vast array of choices on their menu and even provided and opportunity for an upgrade. Of course this is what I opted for. My order consisted of ahi tuna crudo, a korean inspired kimchee steak, and lychee cheesecake. Everything was amazing. From the delicate citrus flavors of the crudo and well-blended kimchee and steak main entree. This restaurant has only been improving since I first ate here. I am for sure a customer for life at the restaurant.",

Their portions are really small so the bill became very pricey for us at the end.  2 dozen oysters and a small salad plus a drink came up to be $100 and up.   I always thought their dishes are on the sweet side.  But there aren't many decent place nearby.    3 stars because I wasn't impressed with the oysters.   Some were just alright.  There are few places in town like Soho, Izakaya go and .... Served better oysters.   Or maybe I simply went at the wrong day for oyster feast.",

My wife and I commenced the dining festivities with poached Bartlett pear salad that included whipped goat cheese, crispy prosciutto, candied walnuts and basil vinaigrette. Truly a yummy for both eye and tummy.    My wife's FABULOUS entree was seared U-10 diver scallops nestled atop kobocha polenta with tossed pine nuts and tamari butterscotch sauce.  Oh I wonder wonder could this be duplicated at home?    Not to be outdone though I was, I ordered pan seared, crispy skin sea bass served over cavatelli with asparagus, dan dan sauce and hen of the woods mushrooms.  OMG! Who would believe I with sagging skin actually enjoyed the crispy skin.     We concluded the meal, though most was eaten by my wife, with a scrumptious tres leches with dark chocolate sponge cake. Did I mention it was lip smacking good?  Service by Joel proved to be just as good as the food he served.    A dining experience par none on our 14 day vacation.",

It was relaxed, friendly, and earnest without the glitz and sometimes soul-lessness of the big Strip establishments.   Our appetizers got us off to a strong start. The grilled Spanish octopus was cooked perfectly and nicely seasoned. The steak tartare had a surprisingly bold sauce, which I enjoyed. My entree, the lemongrass duck confit, was incredible; it was so full of flavor and the duck was very tender. My husband enjoyed his slow braised short rib, and I also liked my friend's fried whole rainbow trout.   Service was very good and helpful when we had a hard time deciding on dishes. The price is quite good given the quality of food. I highly recommend this place and hope I get to come back!",

With every dish that comes, the staff explains the dish which makes you even more excited to try it!! :) I appreciate the neat ingredients and attention to detail in the food!!   The Black Sheep has a rotating seasonal menu.  There are some mainstays it seems, but then some new items pop up so it is always a fun surprise to come here!!!  What to order if you can't order the whole menu:  SPANISH GRILLED OCTOPUS- the most tender, melt in your mouth octopus!  BLACK SHEEP \"HOT CHICKEN\" - karaage chicken smothered in a beautifully red, kimchi gochujang sauce!! It is on top of a thin slice of honey toast!  Mustard seeds and perfectly pickled cucumber slices cut the grease and heat!!    SEARED U10 DIVER SCALLOPS- everything about this dish (and all the dishes here for that matter) is perfect!! Kabocha polenta??!? Say whaaaat??  Creamy polenta goodness and three scallops seared to perfection!! Yesssss!!  BRAISED LAMB BELLY (can't remember the official menu name) - didn't know lamb belly existed until I had this dish. It sat perfectly cooked on top of mashed potatoes with flageolet beans, carrots, and crisp, fried baby beet slices!  The lamb belly was a hearty chunk of tender meat that wasn't gamey at all!    FRIED BEEF CRISPS - a must order!  The first time I was here, we saw the table next to us get it and had to order it for ourselves!  It is fried tendon!! I didn't even know you could do this with tendon!! ***Mind blown***  CHOCOLATE TRES LECHES CAKE - not too sweet, but just right!!!  Cream is poured on top and micro mint greens add a unique touch to it!!   The Black Sheep is one of the rare restaurants where you can probably eat your way through the whole menu and not be disappointed!! Have I done this? No, but now I think I will.",

As if that weren't the absolute best way to start the meal, we offered the short rid that came with sauteed baby beets and.....wait for it.... horseradish risotto.  Good lord. It was unreal.  Flavors bombard you as if  in a totally coordinated symphony.  We topped the meal with a chocolate tres leches.  Wow.  Just wow.  But noooo I can't stop there.  The BEST part of the experience was meeting the owner and head chef.  She was absolutely enchanting, after meeting her, honestly, whatever I was served would have been awesome.

I had a huge dinner here a few nights ago and can't stop both raving to others about this place and thinking about the food! Can someone give this place three michelin stars?! Because it's well worth the detour!  Every. Single. Plate. was incredible. The flavors were all so different and unique. It's clear they spent a lot of time creating this menu and perfect each dishes' flavor profile  Service was also friendly and attentive. We sat at a table. I heard bar service can be...a different experience lol  1. salmon skin tacos - so cool that the taco shell is actually just salmon skin fried in the shape of a taco! good sourcing of their raw fish 2. octopus - cooked well though i wish it has some char. Super savory dish while remaining well balanced 3. steak tartare - the meat is placed nicely on some fried, crispy pieces of \"beef crisps\" so it takes all the work out for you! the beef crisps alone are super yummy and flavorful, definitely added well to the raw meat. Ugh I want to be eating this dish again as I'm thinking about it and describing it 4. Fried whole rainbow trout - A MUST GET!!!! the fish comes boneless, which is amazing that you don't have to deal with all the small bones. Comes in a very salty, savory sauce. The sauce alone with rice was so good! The fish has a nice crispy shell to compliment the tender white meat inside. 5. slow braised short rib - comes on a corn fritter which is amazing alone and also paired with the tender meat. There are \"korean rice cakes\" in this dish which are like bigger, savory boba balls - I really enjoyed them! 6. Grass fed rib eye. The meat was good but I think what stood out for me on this dish was their mushrooms in the wild rice! I thought the mushrooms were soooo good and the flavor really came through in each bite of rice. I'm obsessed 7. Tres leches cake - A MUST GET. The cake is really soaked and is almost a custard flavor. SO DELICIOUS. there are puffs of cream around this dish and theyre two different flavors - coffee and vanilla - done so well! There's a chocolate \"nest\" on top, so think thin chocolate pieces which was itself good; i didnt confirm, but it tasted like dark chocolate because it wasn't super sweet which complemented the sweet cake very well 8. Persimmon bread pudding with house made ice cream. I could've done without as I've had better bread pudding, but it was still good and I enjoyed the persimmon flavor. The ice cream is interesting bc it was vanilla flavor, but they opted for a more sorbet-y finish rather that a super creamy ice cream which complemented the rich bread pudding super well 9. Got a cocktail, can't remember what it was lol but it was definitely a craft cocktail and unique. Had a pepper in it which carried a kick",

    "text": "Soon celebrating two years serving Spring Valley, an area notoriously lacking for Chef-driven Restaurants despite nearby hospitals and offices that should theoretically sport a crowd in search of quality, Sunday Brunch once again attested to The Black Sheep's uniqueness in a market otherwise littered by the mundane.  Tucked away at the corner of Durango and Warm Springs, nearby closures including The Goodwich and Paid In Full proving the Southwest a difficult place to get a foothold, it is immediately on entering The Black Sheep that diners realize there is something different about the space, a mural and organic flourishes giving the room an upscale feel while the Bar stocked in Top-shelf Spirits suggests a Mixology program ready to make a good impression.  Toqued by Jamie Tran, years working with Charlie Palmer, Vincent Pouessel and Daniel Boulud giving the Chef a firm command of French technique applied across flavors from her Vietnamese heritage, guests are invited to order Beverages including bottomless Mimosas while perusing a list of thirteen plates ranging savory to sweet - and often a combination of each.  Featuring smart and convivial service, something co-owner and operator Andy Hooper has assured since day one, it was declining Booze in favor of store-bought Orange Juice and Coffee from Lavazza that things started off quickly, four tiny Pastries for $8 not exactly a highlight as none appeared to be made on-site, though warm Strawberry Preserves helped and would be better served with just Bread and Butter.  Hungry enough to order all but Oysters or Steak and Eggs, two items hard to make unique no matter how talented a Chef, it was instead recalling Chef Tran's impeccable charred Peaches from 2017 that proper plates began with Smokey Heirloom Beets and Poached Pears, the former accompanied by Yogurt and charred Crumbles that play well off Candied Walnuts while the latter trends light, only to be punctuated intermittently by bites of Blue Cheese and Pecans.  Deferring progression to the kitchen, Jamie's cheerful personality still intact despite long hours in tight quarters, 'course' two arrived by way of Chicken Karaage turned-down from her version featuring Kimchi, each bite crispy and balanced by Waffles that sop-up a combination of Mustard Seeds and Syrup while The Black Sheep's baked Pancake comes at the bargain price of just $9 for something easily sharable as an Entree or Dessert.  Resetting share plates and refilling Drinks during a short pause, the overhead soundtrack drifting from Tone Loc to GnR and then Drake, it was in another style of Pancake, this time two-for-$9, that Brunch's best item was offered, a combination of Duck and Asian Pear complimented by Acid touching every part of the palate while Chef Tran's Vietnamese Imperial Rolls accomplish similar with a bit of lingering heat.  Again changing pace with a slice of French Toast, the removal of Herbs better allowing ground Sesame Seeds to shine amidst Berries and Brandy Syrup, those looking for a great Omelet need look no further than \"Melody's\" offered with either Short Ribs or house-smoked Salmon, the Fish selected largely for its novelty and beautiful beside Mushrooms while Chef Tran's Hash Browns are anything but ordinary thanks to both their crisp texture and complex spicing.  Finishing with one more cup of Coffee and fresh utensils, appetites sated and the room approximately half-full, it was opting for Short Rib over Salmon that The Black Sheep's Benny outperformed most thanks to not only the Meat but its interplay with Lime Hollandaise while Jamie's Chilaquiles eschew Meat in favor of earthy Red Sauce brightened by fresh Cheese, tangy Cream and a fried Egg broken by the guest to help Tortillas remain crisp.",

First of all, our server, Danielle, was great. She was attentive, informative, and very hospitable.   We got there for the happy hour and got the $1 oysters, they were very fresh and delicious. The granita they serve with them was amazing.  For our next course, we got the salmon skin tacos and bao sliders, both delicious. We got the short ribs to split as an entree, it was AMAZING; tender and flavorful. The dumplings that came with it were fantastic. For dessert, we got the tres leches and again, it was fantastic.  We will definitely be back. :)",

We started out with the imperial rolls which were delicious and we shared the short ribs entree. We were completely blown away on how amazingly tender the meat was (A+) and how all the flavors and sauces perfectly complemented each other. (I'm usually not a huge fan of kimchi but I absolutely loved the kimchi cucumber side.) We ended the night win the chocolate sponge cake with tres leche sauce, which was the right amount of sweet you'd want after dinner. Will totally come back here again and again to try out the rest of the menu!",

    "text": "Contemporary, Americanized Vietnamese seems to be the thing.  Me likey!  And I am talking about food.  Stop it!  Good originality and creativity with punchy flavors.  Perfect to pair with a few drinks.  Straight to it, crack chips, AKA beef crisps are a must order. Think chicharons but with the flavor of beef. Instead of skin, air dried tendon, deep fried beef tendon dusted with cayanne. Good alone, great when splashed with the accompanying citrus vinegar sauce.  The bao sliders, a must.  Finally something other than boring braised pork with hoisin.  An in-house made, \"Asian\" flavored pork sausage patty, oily in all the right ways, topped with a fried quail eggs and crispy shallots, greens, all on a bao \"bun\", slathered in spicy jalapeno aioli.  The pile of accompanying lotus chips so addicting.   Tuna tartare, would be ordinary if not for the controlled use of a spicy, aromatic chili citrus oil and salt as the only seasoning. Micro cilantro adds a hint of flavor.  Unlike poke, nothing gets in the way of the fishes flavor. Crispy rice crisps, on which the tartare is sat, great texture.  The oysters have bits of lemongrass citrus jelly in each. Zesty and perfectly matches the briny bivalves.  Mains are more straightforward.  The rice flour dusted, deep-fried whole rainbow trout with accompanying ginger and red wine vinegar sauce, solid.. The stand out, Scottish salmon cooked in clay pot. Smoked eggplant is a brilliant foil to the rich fish. The fresh plum salad, refreshes the pallet after every bite. The only thing it could do without is the farro (personal preference).  While not everything is perfect; the imperial rolls, not very crisp and oily, the braised short rib, tender and flavorful but the accompanying gnocchi, pasty and become stodgy with the squash ratatouille, in general very good.  Tip: HH 5 PM to 6 PM with $5 wine, $4 craft beer, and $1 fresh oysters on the half shell. Reverse HH 10 PM to close.  Value priced wine list. Well selected. Well selected craft beers as well.  Very friendly off Strip service.  A great HH spot that rolls seamlessly into a full-blown dinner.  Recommended.",

    "text": "Third visit in 2 weeks? You could say I'm a fan. Chef Jaime Tran has created a menu of Vietnamese-American that is sophisticated enough for a celebratory dinner or date night, but approachable enough for a Thursday evening when you don't want to cook.   I've tried many items on the menu and my favorites are the adorable bao sliders, the west coast oysters (the r month rule has been shucked recently if you hadn't heard), the mesculn greens salad with charred  apricot, the short rib, and the hanger steak.   The hanger steak is the very best I've eaten anywhere, including my own kitchen, and I can make a mean steak. The combination of the meat with the street corn is incredible. And speaking of incredible, that's also how I would describe the short rib, and the ratatouille and yucca gnocchi it's served with. Ideal scenario is for my husband to order one and let me order the other so I can have a little bit of both, because after having both, I don't want to have to choose!  Service is excellent; the staff is super attentive without being obtrusive. The Common Law cocktail is spectacular, and the wine list is fantastic.   I've been here under 3 sets of dining circumstances, most recently celebrating my 13th wedding anniversary. I look forward to many more meals at The Black Sheep.",

Most of the time we just order every appetizer and are too full or order a main dish.   We tried the hamachi which was just okay, the tuna which I think needs a little citrus to brighten it, the octopus--the texture threw me off but my boyfriend liked it, and lastly the Vietnamese rolls which he thought were too fatty/greasy but I liked. If all of the apps were amazing they'd win me over completely and it would be our go to date night spot since it's off the strip, and just a few freeway exits away from home.  The salmon clay pot and drinks are what killed the night for us. The clay pot was so amazing. We asked the server which of the main dishes he liked best and went off of his recommendation (which we were probably going to order anyway.) Mushrooms and farro are staples in our daily diet but this was just cooked perfectly. The salmon prepared medium rare was so tender and flavorful that I almost thought about ordering another one just to be gluttonous. To drink my boyfriend had two negronies. A rare thing because he's usually very picky with how they're prepared. I had the Green Lightning with matcha and gin, followed by the Sunburn with Hangar 1 mandarin blossom, aperol, & ginger lemonade. Both were really good.   I just made my \"much too good for children\" chocolate cake over the weekend so we decided to skip dessert which we never do, but the next time we come, it sounds like their tres leches cake is a must!",

So you got an app, entree, and dessert, ALL WITH A WINE PAIRING for $40. So ok BOMBDIGGITY DEALIO. So, I got the egg rolls, short rib, and macaroons. I love fried food, so egg rolls were bomb. I just wish they didn't put the fish sauce on the egg rolls bc I don't like TOO much fish sauce but whatev - it was still hot and crunchy and delicious. The short rib was a little dry but the veggies and gnocchi around it was moist enough that if you had all 3 on your fork it was an even distribution of moist and flavor.   I did not like the macaroons. There was something in there that kinda made my mouth feel numb? I don't know. It was weird. I've had a lot of macaroons in my time and these were def my least fav.   My friends got the hanger steak? They all cleaned their plates so I assume they hated it (insert sarcastic font).

Our waiter noticed our table was wobbly on his own & immediately fixed then started to explain everything on the menu, drinks, popular items & what he highly recommends, very attentive & nice throughout our entire time there.   Small menu with a different type of food items, original/one of a kind. My only complaint, which could be our fault for not catching happy hour was we wanted to try out several different starters & share (just two of us) dishes were very small & pricey. 4 appetizers, 2 cocktails, over $60 & we left still a little hungry.  I'll be back for a light snack or to try a full entree or if ever just want to grab a drink.",

The appetizers are all good: burrata salad, ceviche and especially the octopus. Interesting ingredients in unexpected combinations.  Main dishes don't disappoint and desserts satisfying. Definitely worth checking out but it ain't cheap.",

    "text": "I tried this place when they first opened and I wasn't impressed with their food, which was a shame because I loved the way the restaurant is set up and the overall decor. It felt intimate and upscaled, but still had a local vibe. I didn't plan to come back, but I'm glad I did as my second visit was a much better experience.   My first visit, I got to try their happy hour (from 5-6 PM) oysters, which was $1 each. Oysters were great and tasted fresh, so I thought this was a good deal. They didn't have many drink selections for happy hour. One white wine, one red wine, and a couple beers. I had the red wine (a pinot noir) for $5 and one of the beers for $4. I also tried their hamachi crudo (no longer on menu per my second visit) and disliked this dish immensely, as it was very fishy. The crackers and whatever dressing they put on it didn't add anything to the dish. I've never had hamachi that was that fishy, so I'm glad they took it off their menu. Last, I tried their slow cooked short rib, which was tender but very bland. They asked for a feedback, so we told them that the short rib was bland and they got us another one, but it was pretty much the same taste wise. Service was awesome though, as they readily tried to fix it. Anyway, from my first visit, I thought the food was not that great for the price (entrees are around $18 - $25).  I went for my second visit last weekend by chance, as the original place my friend and I wanted to try didn't have its liquor license yet. Being it's the weekend, we needed our drinks on, so we went here instead. We shared the Mediterranean octopus, braised pork belly, and curry chicken. The octopus was made like a calamari, so even though the flavor of the sauce was good, I still much prefer my octopus to be simply prepared, either raw or just grilled. That way I can taste the octopus. The way it was made here, I had a hard time differentiating it with a squid. The pork belly was a melt in your mouth, cooked perfectly, very flavorful dish. It came with a cauliflower puree. I though this was a great dish, so I'd definitely recommend it. The curry chicken had a little bit of a heat to it, so since I enjoy it as well since I like spicy food.  For cocktails, I tried the louisville sweet peach (bourbon with peach liqueur) and my friend tried the la flama blanca (shochu based with lemon and thai chili syrup). I think they could've been stronger, but they both tasted good, so I'm looking forward to trying out more of their cocktails. We had the chocolate tres leches for dessert. It's like a denser sponge cake, onto which they poured some condensed milk. I liked it, as it's not too sweet. Nothing amazing though.  My second visit was a much improved experience, so I'd give this place a 3.5 stars. Service was great both times. Definitely a great option for a date night!",

Hamachi Crudo - quality was great, tasted fresh, but the sweet flavor is not for me. Still a great dish, just not for me. Fried Beef Crisps - yes,yes,yes. These were excellent - its like eating steak popcorn. Salmon Clay Pot - very well rounded dish. Salmon was cooked perfectly, depth of flavor, very good. The star of the night was the Braised Duroc Pork Belly - perfectly executed, great flavor combinations, great presentation. I could eat every day. Over all Black Sheep stands out.

Presentation was nice, pleasant service and they were accommodating about letting us move tables away from a large party of people.  What I didn't like: Small menu, small portions, and small area overall- not many seats. The smallness also made it SO loud inside which really bothered me- they could invest in some soundproofing as all the surfaces seemed to be pretty echoey. I'd go back, but am not in hurry... except maybe for the dessert! :P",

    "text": "First, I would like to start off by saying that the food is so beautifully put together and arranged that I almost didn't want to eat it. My girlfriend and I decided to just share a few appetizers (trying to watch our weight). The first appetizer was the Heirloom Tomato and Watermelon Salad, it was served with some creamy burrrrrata cheese which I'm not the biggest fan of, but it complimented the dish very well. The next appetizer was the Crispy Mediterranean Octopus and just to note, anytime there are little Spanish Octopus babies on a menu, I will always order them. I really enjoyed the vadouvan sauce, it was a very light and tangy curry sauce with just the right amount of spice and of course the babies were cookies to perfection, tender and crispy! Our last app was the Ahi Tuna Tartare, it was a very simple and elegant dish. I am a big fan of doing less is more (it's how I live my life), this was a very simplistic ahi tuna tartare, which is what I prefer. Most Ahi Tuna Tartares I've had are always overpowered with tons of sauces and obnoxious toppings and as for this one I really enjoyed just having the fish with the chili citrus oil on a creative crisp rice taco shell, simple yet divine! Until next time",

Must try apps: Mesuclun salad is refreshing served with goat cheese and a prickly pear vinaigrette.  Hamachi is great. Served with a coconut consume and a ponzu gelee that adds a nice acidity. Nice twist on a hamachi crudo  Tuna tartare was great, served with a chiili oil. Loved it try it!   As far the main courses go, really enjoyed the salmon. Cooked to a perfect medium rare with a sweet and savory plum sauce. In addition, it included a gremolata, light and refreshing.   Also try the hanger steak. Steak is nice and meaty with a delicious iron taste. And the Mexican corn with coconut butter and Gouda is where it's as. Also served with roasted fingerling potatoes with a Meyer dressing.   If you have room have the trout for dessert. Fried whole with a ginger sauce.  Delicate flavors with sauteed rainbow Swiss chard that adds a nice bitterness to balance out the dish.",

Food was ok, nothing with that wow factor and the oysters were a bit off. Comfortable spot with great ambiance but the waiter was awkward, nice kid but he looked and acted uncomfortable... which made me uncomfortable every time he came by. Drinks were a hit, but that signature cocktail, was an unfortunate miss. Too much creativity in that one.",

Great service from all the staff including Ryan who kept checking on our table to make sure everything was tasting great.  Jr also did a great job in explaining the food and drinks. The oyster happy hour is awesome.  Ahi tuna and Vietnamese rolls are bomb!!! Hanger steak was cooked to perfection.  Currently they only have 1 dessert which was okay but I hear there will be more coming soon. Definitely will be back and telling everyone I know.  Southwest really needed something like the black sheep.  This place is a must eat!!!",

Everything was absolutely delicious and we highly recommend everything listed above! Can't wait to go back and try their other delicious creations!",

    "text": "This review is for 4.5 stars.  Black Sheep lives up to all my expectations.  I came during Happy Hour to get an affordable first impression and was not disappointed.  They have 2 Happy Hours each day from 5:00-6:00 and from 10:00-11:00 (close).  They offer $5 wine, $4 beer, and $1 oysters - pretty solid if you're on this side of town.  So obviously I had to try some West Coast oysters with the house spicy cocktail sauce and other oysters with their lemongrass sauce.  The spicy sauce was phenomenal while the lemongrass, although refreshing, was not my type of oyster topping.  I also had the imperial rolls.  I was expecting the typical Vietnamese rolls with the rice wrapped skin, but these came deep fried over a tasty salad.  I really enjoyed the dish but was just perplexed when it was served as it resembled more of an egg roll than a spring roll.  I really wanted to try the pork buns that Black Sheep is already known for across town, but they were sold out at 10:00pm on a Monday night; this is the main reason I'm knocking off half a star.  The service was exceptional, the company at the bar was fun, and the wine was very good for $5.  I will most certainly be back to try the buns so will update my review if they're as good as I'm expecting.  But overall, on my first experience, I am very excite about Black Sheep and hope that more restaurants of this style and class open on the Westside.",

    "text": "Good price, interesting food, similar to District 1, great service  I liked this place.  I went here with my fiance for Restaurant Week, but we priced out the menu and figured it was a better deal to just order what we wanted.  We ended up order oysters, the Hamachi Crudo, the Chicken Wings, the Heirloom Salad, Slow Cooked Short Rib, and the Jerk Chicken.    The oysters were good, had a nice fresh flavor and were reasonably priced.  The Hamachi Crudo was excellent.  The Chicken Wing was the entire wing that was smothered in a fish sauce / sesame oil mixture common of Vietnamese / Thai flavors.  It was a strange dish.  I was hoping for a fried chicken wing tossed in a sweet chili sauce, so this was a bit disappointing.  However, the taste was interesting and the chicken was cooked properly.  Finally, the Heirloom salad was very good.  I would order the Crudo and the Heirloom salad again.  As for the entrees, the Slow Cooked Short Rib and the Jerk Chicken were both overcooked and dry.  These both were simply execution errors.  The Short Rib needed more braising liquid as the bottom of the short rib was excellent.  However, the top and middle were dry and unpleasant.  As for the Chicken, it was dry throughout the entire chicken.  The jerk sauce is very similar to the one used by DW Bistro.  Neither dish were memorable and I would not order either one again.    All in all, I'm a fan of the restaurant.  The flavor profile of the food is interesting and I enjoyed the dishes that were cooked properly.  I would return again to try different dishes on the menu.  It is a good neighborhood restaurant that has excellent service and you can see the inspiration in the menu.  That's worth 4 Stars.  :)",

Even though we were on the strip, we took a Lyft over to this restaurant because of the reviews. Hunter was our server and he was so much fun, very knowledgeable and helpful.  The food was incredible. The flavors, the ingredients...everything was in season and flavorful. Hunter recommended sharing everything and it's definitely the way to do it here. You have to try everything!! Some of our favorites were the shrimp ceviche, the trout, and the scallops. I may have overdone the flame blanca but it's an award-winning drink so why not - it's Vegas baby! Anyhow, my new favorite spot in Vegas and will have to recommend to all my friends back home.",

It was almost like dining at a fine dining restaurant. The one thing that I found was that their menu is very limited. However, the menu was really unique, and the portion was actually very generous and tasty. The experience was above most of the restaurants in the local restaurants and maybe even than the ones in the strip.   We ordered the emperial rolls and pork belly. The rolls were very unique and the sauce drizzled was very well-balanced with the crispy rolls. All the garnished veggies on the side went well with the dish as well. I would say it is a great appetizer to go with white wines. Also, their pork belly is a must try. The meat was really tender and the rice was very flavorful as well. I loved every single part of the dish.   Everything is well- balanced in the dish and the menu; the only reason why I would deduct one star is because their menu selection. I hope they would elaborate it a little more. I will come back again to try out their hh oysters!",

Next time we will definitely make reservations especially if dining later.  We split the smoked beet salad which was delicious, the best beet salad I've had. Next time I will order my own.  My wife ordered the short ribs which were tender and perfectly seasoned.  She brought half of the entree home for lunch on Friday, top notch!  I ordered the king salmon. It was cooked to the perfect temperature and was juicy. It was paired with black forbidden rice, mushrooms and shaved fennel. We took advantage of the happy hour Syrah wine for a perfect dinner out.

This is a Vietnamese and American fusion restaurant and let me tell you, they do this impeccably.   To start the night off, we had Bao Sliders and Fried Beef Crisps. The buns in the sliders were made of bao dough, the pork sausage patties were juicy and flavorful, and the jalapeno aioli that topped it gave it a hint of spiciness. It also had a fried quail egg on top with a runny yolk; I was very impressed by this because I have ever only seen boiled quail eggs! The Beef Crisps were amazing; it is a sophisticated take on pork rinds. Beef tendon is air dried and deep fried, creating this exquisite dish. It was dusted with black and red pepper and drizzled with a citrus-y vinegar table side. Both appetizers are must tried.   For the entree, I had the Grilled Creekstone Hanger Stone. They recommend it being cooked medium rare, and wow was it delectable. The steak was juicy and tender and had a buttery texture. It had a smoky, thick glaze that covered the entire steak which gave it a good flavor. It was accompanied by fingerling potatoes, cooked very tender, and half a cob of corn. The corn was their take on Mexican street corn, which was covered with coconut Gouda and cilantro.   This restaurant is a hidden treasure! Will definitely come back.",

    "text": "OMG , this place was amazing. I had seen this place on Eater and just had to try it. So we were in Las Vegas this weekend so I booked a reservation. We arrived early and it was pretty empty at 545pm. They sat us right away in the middle of the restaurant. Our reservation was at 615pm. At that time it started filling up and by 630 it was packed, the place is not that big so get a reservation for sure.  We told them it was our first time and the waitress explained the favorite dishes and they were the ones I saw on the reviews I read. We ordered the Bao sliders, which were great the bun was fresh and yummy. Next the Imperial roll which didn't disappoint.   While we were enjoying these items we saw another table get a large clumped item with something drizzled on it. We asked our waitress and she called it a beef skin popcorn. It's called Beef crisp. It is like pork rines but beef with a spice truffle oil. It was really good.   Our mains were the braised Duroc pork belly and beef short ribs. The pork had the best flavor and a must order. The short rib was just ok, good but like other places.  Our finally was the Chocolate Tres Leche Cake. It was delightful, so light not rich since it's sponge cake you have to get this one.  All in all a fantastic time. The service was great, friendly and you will have to try The Black Sheep when you come to Vegas. Off the strip but you won't be disappointed.",

We drove across town to have date night here on a Saturday night at 5:15pm and were turned away due to a private party. We were told tables wouldn't be ready until after 7pm. I checked their FB page and there was no communication regarding this closure. Same for their website. I feel this is a poor way of doing business. The desire to try this restaurant has quickly dissipated. We won't be returning.",

Nevertheless food was great I wish the Vietnamese crepes were a little difficult to eat (might be better in corn tortilla but then it wouldn't be a crepe) oyster were yummy, tartar was great , the ceviche will make you fall in love and overall a great place. Will be returning, hopefully they will give me a little roll next time",

My SO got the restaurant week menu which was pretty decent and included that wine pairing! That was great. I forgot what was in the menu, unfortunately because it was his meal. Not a fan of the dessert though, I believe it was a tres leches dessert.  I ordered away from the restaurant week menu though. I got the rainbow trout dish. It really is an entire whole fish with the head and the tail. It didn't bother me! It was delicious but I highly recommend you eat it with the rice! I didn't want to eat rice so I kinda skipped that and I regretted it. It was a bit on the salty side if I ate it without the rice. (I guess that's why they included rice with the dish duhhh!)  Those $1 oysters were pretty awesome too! Happy hour = $1 oysters. Yummmm! I tried all the sauces they had and the jelly was my favorite one.   Although the service was good, my server talked too much. A little bit too much where it was just uncomfortable. Not like he was being impropriate on conversation, its just we would be socializing with each other and he came up around weird times. Aside from that, we love this place and I'd come back again soon!",

My whole experience here was amazing! The crew were all friendly, fun, and paid attention to detail. The food was delicious and was nicely presented. They had a real nice selection of wines and the music they had on the background were ALL good songs! lol  The restaurant is very casual, quaint, probably have 10-12 tables and bar seating, nicely decorated and dimly lighted, which made the atmosphere very relaxing and romantic.     All in all, everything here was worth going to. I'd suggest you give this place a try and i'll bet you'll love it too!",

The gentleman was hospitable and quick to get us a table.   Upon entering. Perfect ambience, very classy sophisticated. Our drinks were served first, excellent customer service and delicious food was all highlighted and presented here, but these aren't all what made this place distinctive for me.   Opposed to other restaurants, it's the Chefs, I  personally never had a Chef introduce themselves to me/our table. She even brought out our plate to and explained to us in details what it was and how it was made. I really like that, it shows me that they care about who they are serving their food to and by them doing so, is astonishing and appreciated. They earned my respect.   With every plate they served us, they are very precise and strong on detail. Art is robustly presented in their food and is tangible here at The Black Sheep.  Ahi Tuna Tartare** Crispy Mediterranean Octopus Vietnamese Imperial Rolls West Coast Oysters Fried Beef Crisps Dark Chocolate Semifreddo**  2 asterisks indicate my favorites!  We will be back for HH!",

We were greeted promptly and seated in a corner table for 2. My wife had the bees knees and she loved it. I went with a Bombay and tonic and it was as expected. We started with the imperial rolls and the Thai basil shrimp apps. The rolls were awesome. Fried crispy with a light filling. They were tasty. The shrimp was good, the avocado mousse was the star of the dish. For mains I had the whole trout while my wife had the pork belly. Trout was boned then fried and was really good. Came with Swiss chard greens and a sauce. Sauce was a little too salty for me. My wife's pork belly was really good. Came with glass noodles in a spicy lemon grass sauce, was really good. Heirloom carrots and some mushrooms complete the dish. We ended with a lychee cheesecake and it was good. Service was good until dessert. Took 13 minutes to get our cheesecake and we were not offered coffee. Only hiccup to an otherwise good night.",

They torch the ice cube first and then pour the bourbon over it. As the ice cube melts over time, the drink continues to change flavor and get sweeter. Hands down the best cocktail they have there. Another must try is their salmon skin tacos. I've never had a taco shell made out of salmon skin! It's so crispy and delicious. The crispy octopus had just the perfect amount of spice. Everything else we tried there was very tasty. Definitely going to try more of their menu next time as well as order the favorites again.",

Offerings are focused but smart and engineered well.  Highlight was the Lemongrass Jerk Chicken with papaya salad, nice and bold with refreshing texture and acidity.  Salmon Clay Pot didn't have quite the dimension of the chicken but was well prepared and though slightly over smoked table-side very enjoyable. Peach and mesclun salad was solid, addition of vinaigrette to tendon crisps is a nice touch.  Didn't try dessert but the spiel was intriguing so I will be returning.",

The food we ordered:  Salmon skin tacos, Vietnamese imperial rolls, yellowfish (or tuna) sashimi (of some sort), short ribs entree, and prawns entree (it was the day after Valentines, so it was a temporary special.)    Even though we had multiple items on the menu, we found that the only item that we both agreed was really good was the Vietnamese imperial rolls.  The fish in the tacos and sashimi were both really fresh, but the sauces that accompanied them didn't complement them well.  The rest of the food we felt was average. Not terrible, but not really worth the hype we read. We also felt like the server was somewhat disingenuous in her recommendations.  I think it's a nice place to grab a drink after work with some friends or for a work meeting, additionally, the ambiance is very romantic for a first date. Overall the both of us felt the food was lacking.",

However, I didn't really come here to drink, or party, my main purpose was to relax by the pool, but most importantly, TO EAT!!  I did a little research online and found The Black Sheep, which was not only voted RESTAURANT OF THE YEAR, but also the head chef, Chef Tran, was voted CHEF OF THE YEAR by Eater. There was no doubt  I had to try them for myself.  Chef Tran has a Vietnamese background, which she fuses with classic dishes like duck confit and ceviche, all with a modern twist.  We were blown away by each and every single dish. It truly was fine dining at its best, but guess what, without the cost! My husband could not stop talking about how amazing the food was.  This place was approximately 15 minutes off the strip but trust me when I say it's worth the detour!  My top recommendations are the rolls, ceviche, and my absolute favorite....the salmon skin tacos!!",

    "text": "I had no idea American-Vietnamese was even a thing, but I enjoyed the heck out of it twice in the span of a week.  The hot spots just keep on coming to SW Vegas and I love it!!  Starters:  Bow down to their \"Bao Sliders\", consisting of pork sausage, fried quail egg, crispy shallots and jalapeno aioli; THIS is an absolute must order.  The pillow-like buns and thin sliver of Chinese sausage combined with everything else it had going on tasted like the best news I'd get all day.  It is a remarkable bite that I totally wish could be made as a full size burger.   The \"Crispy Mediterranean Octopus\" was another outstanding appetizer with Spanish baby octopus and the amazing lick off the plate purple basil vadouvan  (curry) sauce that shot it up several levels.  Shareability would have improved had there been chopsticks for everyone, which they don't have, which is kinda weird.    Entrees:  The \"Scottish King Salmon\" is a dish that could easily have been on the menu at Harvest by Roy Ellamar at Bellagio.  Scented farro, smoked eggplant, fresh plum salad with a gorgeously cooked salmon filet (that skin!) sitting on top was superb and arguably the best entree they offer.   Free parking made it taste even better.    I detected distinct Taiwanese flavors from the uber tender \"Braised Duroc Pork Belly\" with mustard greens.  The eye pleasing sticky rice encased in a flavorful bamboo leaf that accompanied it was a nice play on the classic \"bah-tzang\" I used to pig out on by the dozen as a kid.     No one could go wrong with the fantastic \"Slow Cooked Short Rib\" coupled with the summer squash ratatouille, which made for a great flavor combination.  I also fully enjoyed sampling my wife's \"Fried Whole Rainbow Trout\" with sauteed rainbow Swiss chard and ginger/rice wine vinegar sauce.  Big thanks to our server for advising me to eat the fish head!  It was an absolute joy of crunchy fried goodness.  Do it!!  The only entree that wasn't on the same level was the hanger steak.  Perhaps just having had a magnificent one at Jaleo days before raised my expectations too high. Potato/potahto though!  Clearly there is plenty of stuff to like from this unique eatery and I'll be back for more soon.  4.39872186204 stars!",

This one of my favorites as it's close to home and still a world away in terms of ambiance.   CRISPY OCTOPUS - nothing short of fantastic BAO SLIDERS - nice starter SCOTTISH SALMON - over forbidden rice is a no brainer perfection SMOKEY BEET SALAD - smoked flavor, but drowned in a yogurt that i didn't care for, is shareable only because neither of us liked it.   BRAISED DUROC PORK BELLY - over cauliflower puree, kabocha squash blew my mind!  Good date night spot or chill out and enjoy libations without all that noise.",

    "text": "This place is very nice, the atmosphere is relaxing and the staff is amazing.   Our server Danielle was very specific when she explained the dishes we had questions about.  My partner ordered the Hangar steak and I ordered the Lemongrass jerk chicken. We ordered our son the Bao sliders with lotus chips. For our drink, we ordered the Mr. Brownstone.   When our food came out the presentation was nice and everything looked good. I took a bite of the chicken and realized the bone was in. I was waiting for an amazing flavor to hit me but it tasted like regular chicken. The papaya salad that it came with was nice and refreshing. My dish was disappointing for me because it's something I feel can be cooked at home. For $18 it wasn't worth it.   My partners' hangar steak was medium rare, pink and bloody. I took a bite of her steak and it had no shocking amazing flavor. It was just chewy meat. She wasn't too impressed with her meal. $25 and nothing amazing.   My son had the Bao sliders, it was cute and small for him. The perfect size for him. The slider had a breakfast sausage patty with a thin slice of Chinese sausage and quail egg. We ordered it as plain as can be since he's picky. He enjoyed it.   The service was extremely amazing, but the food not too much. I was excited to try this place out because of all the great reviews, but it was disappointing. All of it.",

Foodie's delight with a seasonally evolving menu.  You have to try the Crispy Beef appetizer! Chef was able to alter one of the entrees to accommodate my allergies. For which I am eternally grateful.  Great service down to the details. Shepherd is the best (but he already knows that). Atmosphere is classy, cozy, and a little flashy. Love it. Dress code is, however, casual. No need to dress up to get a phenomenal meal. My smallest of complaints would be the limited dessert menu. Overall, I haven't really found a better restaurant off strip that delivers on every level.",

    "text": "Review is for Restaurant Week 2017 menu.  The Black Sheep is a relatively small place on Warm Springs that I found while checking the Restaurant Week listings.  I made a reservation but they were unable to find it.  There was no cause for alarm as it was early and there were plenty of tables available without taking one at the bar.  (The reservation was later found and the gentleman told me about it so I would know I did indeed make the reservation.)  This was the beginning of what was to be excellent service and attention paid by the people in charge to make sure their guests were enjoying their  food and that your being there was appreciated!  Items ordered along with their menu descriptions:  Vietnamese imperial rolls - Duroc Pork & Shrimp, Pickled Heirloom Carrots, Garlic Citrus Vinaigrette Slow cooked short rib - Yucca Gnocchi, Summer Squash Ratatouille Chocolate tres leches - Chocolate Sponge Cake, Condensed Milk  All meals for Restaurant Week were served with wine pairing for each course.  I don't drink so they did two things for me.  There was no charge for my iced tea and they brought me a bowl of house made lotus root chips that were absolutely addictive.  They were very thinly sliced pieces gently fried and salted.  A good starter to munch on while awaiting my appetizer.  The imperial rolls had a thin coating of gently fried batter around the pork and shrimp \"sausages.\"  The garlic citrus vinaigrette was excellent and added so much to this simple dish.  The short rib was tender and could be pulled apart just using your fork.  The yucca gnocchi need some work as they were not soft at all.  The summer squash ratatouille was very good with the short rib.  The chocolate tres leches needs work too or it needs a change of name.  While it is a sponge cake and it was a bit moist on the inside, it doesn't come near being what tres leches cake should be.  It was quite firm.  There was a chocolate ring on top and the server poured white chocolate sauce over the chocolate ring.  My server was Shepherd and he was very good.  As I said at the beginning of the review, service was superb here.  Someone was coming by often checking to make sure everything was OK.  A few changes in the cooking would rank this as a 5 star place in my estimation.",

Then I could blindfold friends and take them to this gem without the risk of it becoming a victim of success.  But that wouldn't be fair to the folks who pour heart and soul into the food and service here.  I'm normally not a big fan of fusion style places.  This restaurant made me a believer.  We had the Thai Basil Ceviche as an appetizer - it had a fascinating blend of flavors with just the right hint of heat to wake up the tastebuds.  My wife had the Short Ribs and I decided on the Duck Confit.  Both were masterful combinations of flavors and textures - absolute masteries of the fusion concept.  Our server was attentive without being intrusive and the bartender has generous instincts.  We came on an impulse - and a wonderful impulse it was - one of the best meals I've enjoyed in Las Vegas.",

Also ordered the oysters which were perfectly sweet and well selected. The Vietnamese crepe is essentially pho in taco form; brilliant. The ceviche was divine, and the sliders very good.   Our indulgent night also involved a tres de leeches dessert which was not only delicious but also five star in presentation.  Very well done. Will be back!",

I loved the decor and the overall ambiance of the place. The bar itself was very beautiful! The restaurant is pretty small which I don't mind because it gives it a cozy vibe. Shepard was our server and he was very attentive and helpful with recommendations. He told us that the menu is rotated out so if you see something go while they still have it! We ordered the salmon skin tacos which were okay but a little on the greasy side. The grilled octopus was delicious. For our main dish my sister and I both ordered the scallops and they were cooked perfectly! Overall, food/drinks/service was wonderful but the prices were a little bit high.

We decided to go there for Restaurant Week as they had an amazing offering with a lot of wine pairings so I was fortunate enough to be able to try a lot of different dishes, and will be back to try a lot more that were on the menu.   The peach salad, the spring rolls, the salmon Hot Pot, the short rib, the Tres Leches and the macaroons, were what I tried and absolutely loved.  The bartender Max was a True cocktail connoisseur, and very good at his craft. My favorites for the meal were the spring rolls, as they were to Die For in texture and taste, and the macaroons... Oh those macaroons though!  I never thought I would like a vanilla macaron as much as I like this one, but you could tell there was a made-from-scratch scratch vanilla bean decadence.  I would highly recommend this place as they service the staff, the ambience, the flavors, the menu, and the pricing is unreal, and Rivals those of new hip downtown eateries.",

My wife went with scallops and I had the ribeye which both were amazing but I think the scallops were a step above the ribeye additions. The presentation was cool but I know now I don't like real wild rice! Server was good and gave suggestions out as I will always ask their preference to new places. I only gave 4 stars for atmosphere cool/hip spot but felt a little sterile and could use some soft touches rather than being so cold in the actual dining area. I would change to 5 if it was updated to reflect the decor already present in the restaurant including our table and which was so wobbly almost spilled my drink every other minute.",

Unfortunately we were so hung over from 4th of July, or else we would've definitely tried one of their signature cocktails.  Ordered mixed pickled veggies, fried octopus, short rib and jerk lemongrass chicken   Pickled veggies, visually very inviting! And the sourness opens an appetite.  Fried octopus was delish with the sauce.  The short rib personally was under seasoned and not as tender as ones I've had before else where. But the ratatouille underneath was flavorful! Jerk chicken was flavorful and the papaya mango salad was refreshing.  Would definitely return and recommend!",

The food is well thought out. Everything on the plate works. Beautifully decorated. Clean. Just an all around great place. Prices are beyond fair for the quality. Shepherd was our waiter... yes, that's his real name... he's a rockstar. Totally made the experience 100%. I don't know if it would of been the same without him. My suggestion: grab a handful of friends. Request Shepherd. Eat the entire menu. Go back again on a random Wednesday and eat the Duroc pork belly all by yourself.",

My husbands tenderloin was acceptable, but nothing special.  My salmon was super undercooked- almost raw in the middle.

The environment is upscale and a bit boujee but besides pier 215, it's the only place i can think of that is higher class in this neighborhood. Definitely a plus when you want fancy vibes nearby. The oysters are great and only a dollar during reverse happy hour. We decided to try the pickled vegetables and i regret not pairing it with a deep red wine. I highly recommend the jerk chicken.

It said to be Vietnamese influence cuisine, I'm Vietnamese and very excited to check out this place to see what chef Jaime Tran can escalate the Vietnamese cuisine with American concept. Tonight we had oysters with lemongrass Thai chili granita, red rooster cocktail sauce. Oysters were fresh but they were in room temperature, the lemongrass chili granita is like a spicy lemongrass jelly than granita. It gave an interesting flavor to the oysters. The rooster cocktail sauce was like chili Sambal sauce mix with cocktail sauce!  Crispy Octopus was quite good, crispy, crunchy baby octopus with curry sauce! The Bao sliders were small patty with Chinese Sausage, frisee, fried quail egg, and home made Asian style bun/Bao. Wish it had pate in it then it will be a better Vietnamese style.  For entrees, we had salmon clay pot, pork belly and short ribs. I'm not favor the salmon, missing some quite of sauce. Pork belly was great with mushrooms, stirred fired mustard green, it reminded me of Vietnamese style braised pork( Thit Kho). Short rib had a great flavor with yucca gnocchi.  They have a great selection of wines. I might come back to try other dishes!",

I went again last nite for the 3rd time, mainly bc I got the night off and they added a new salad I needed to have in this heat!  So, I went at the end of HH and had a few oysters and their house cocktail, The Sunburn. Perfect for the heat! Followed up with the new Heirloom Tomato, Watermelon, and Burrata salad. Then the Hanger Steak.  The salad was everything I was looking for! A perfect blend of flavors and freshness! It was bright and fresh and the burrata added the cream aspect! I would go back today to do it again! Steak wise.... yes, yes, yes. It was perfectly cooked and the potatoes and summer corn were amazing! This subtle coconut cream with cilantro were just perfect.   I am so happy to have this place so close to my home! Thank you Chef Jamie! Thank you Andrew Hooper!   Being that I went on the first nite open, I can't give it 5 stars yet, however, I have nothing but good to say! First, the setting itself is welcoming and comfortable and upscale, while still being non pretentious and welcoming to the neighbors. I love the decor and color scheme! I stared at the bar for happy hour, while waiting for my friend to join for dinner. I had a $3 craft beer and a half a dozen fresh oysters! I chose 3 with mignonette and 3 with their lemongrass \"sauce\". I'm glad I let the bartender convince me to order the lemongrass ones, bc they were even better than the classic ones!  Once my friend arrived, we got a table and moved to the dining room.  We hadn't intended to eat an entire meal so we ordered the tuna tartare, hamachi crudo, house pickles, and the green salad. Every bit of each of these dishes was fabulous. Great flavors all around. I could eat a few orders of that tartare! We needed up ordering the slow cooked short rib, on the server Riches recommendation. SO glad I we did! I never would have ordered that without prompting and it was great! The gnocchi was yucca based and so tasty. We rode ed a couple glasses off their happy hour, followed by an Amazingly priced Planta Cerasiolo DI Vittoria. What a great dining experience! Everyone from the owners who greeted me, to the bartender, to our server Rich, gave us such genuine friendly service. Chef Tran even came out to talk to us after our meal! I will most definitely be coming here again, most likely making it my after work spot for a great meal and great drinks! Can't wait!",

I had a heirloom tomato and watermelons salad for appetizer. My friend and I both ordered same salad.  I thought it was gonna be too much if we order two since we both ordered steaks for entrees but they were perfect portion.  For entrees I ordered grass fed rib eye steak.  Wow! Delicious!! My friend ordered hanger steak and he loved his dish as well.  I was hoping that they had more choices for desserts but they only had two. I'm a big fan of dessert so I was looking forward to dessert list but when I found out both of them are with chocolate. I was little disappointed. Rockey road brownies and Chocolate cake.  But they still taste great it wasn't the best dessert I tasted but still great.   Overall I gave this restaurant 5 stars! Service, ambience, and food. And they even had my moscato.:)  moscato made up for dessert.",

The Imperial Rolls as an appetizer were awesome as was the shrimp cocktail with rooster sauce. I ordered the short ribs, which were amazing. Extremely tender and paired with a gnocchi that was a nice surprise.   My husband had the hangar steak with roasted corn on the cob and meijer lemon potatoes.  I ate almost all of his corn, it was so good.   Besides the great food, the atmosphere is perfect and just the right amount of upscale. This will be my go-to place for apps and drinks after work. I'm so glad we have something of this caliber in the Southwest now!",

We got a bunch of appetizers to share  and drinks. My favorite was the tomato/burrata watermelon salad. The menu items are unique and more for 'foodies' and those willing to go beyond their comfort zone. Great service - our waiter was very passionate about the food and drinks offered and was eager to answer our questions. Definitely recommend checking out for a date night or night out.",

Second time around , I got the imperial spring rolls with pork and shrimp, couple pickled carrots and a small frisee salad. Really enjoyed the flavors of the dish. Also got the lemongrass and jerk chicken thigh. This is where I give it three stars. When I think of a chicken thigh, I don't think of dry meat. This was very dry and lacked flavor. I barely tasted the lemongrass or the jerk seasoning. The papaya salad was straight papaya and that's it, nothing exciting but decent.   Also when you walk in, it's hard to figure out where to pick up your food. I'm sure I'll give it another shot down the road but the dryness of that thigh meat was very underwhelming.",

The 'tres leches' dessert was a 'miss', the cake didn't taste fresh, I could imagine it being bought at he supermarket, and all of the other 'accoutrements' were ok but really lacked soul and rich flavors.  The curry and lentils dish was fine, not great not bad, just ok.  Finally, the old fashioned I ordered was diminutively poured (once I took out the ove sizes ice square there was barely any liquor in the glass), and, the temperature of the draft sculpin came in luke warm.  Not a strong showing when I had high expectations given previous reviews.",

    "text": "If I was writing a review on the food alone, then I would easily give it five stars. Black Sheep has been one of the most buzzed about restaurants in Las Vegas over the past year and I can see why. The food really is very good. However, the service on the night I went was so poor that I cannot give it more than three stars. Our server's demeanor during our entire experience was so off putting that I don't know if I could ever return. At one point, he actually insinuated that we were taking too long looking at the menu to order our entrees and essentially said \"this is Black Sheep and even though it's a Tuesday night, because we are Black Sheep we are going to be busy and need to get the orders into the kitchen early and need your menus for other guests coming in and oh did I mention that you are at Black Sheep?\" It's a small restaurant and yes, while they were busy all night it's not like hundreds of people were dining there. There was always a huge stack of menus at the hostess stand at all times. So for them to insinuate that they were short on menus was ridiculous. Anyway, while the food was amazing (standouts included the Octopus appetizer and the salmon entree) the service was SO slow all night. Everything took forever - drinks, water refills, food service, clearing our plates, etc. I don't know if being pretentious is part of the shtick at Black Sheep? If so, that's too bad because while the food is good, it cannot make up for the abysmal service and attitude of the staff. There were a few misses on the menu too. The Penicillin cocktail smelled like an old bandaid. Seriously. It was so off putting that we had to send it back. And the dessert we ordered - the chocolate brownie - was mediocre at best. Would probably not return, at least not for awhile.",

The duck confit was drenched in overpowering lemon sauce, too bad duck confit is very flavourful when you let it shine. The ribeye in Vine leaf was underwhelming, not much seasoning and flavour it was pretty disappointing for a 46$ plate. It came with some ginger rice which was nice but didn't work at all along the ribeye and the whole plate didn't work as a whole. The high point was the fois gras mousse in a sesame ball appetizer but that came with a really boring salad. The desert was a bit better but still pretty forgettable. Overall it was a lackluster dinner and while everything was well cooked and nothing we had was bad, I think that for the price it should be a lot more exciting.",

My experience exceeded anything I could've expected. The restaurant is beautiful, very chill atmosphere. Service was impeccable. Danielle treated us like family, very well versed in the menu and wine list. Max, at the bar, mixed us some AMAZING cocktails. Chef Jaime dazzled us with food! Every single item we order was beautifully presented and soooooo delicious. The four of us ordered a dozen oysters, Hamachi Crudo, Heirloom and Watermelon Salad, and Spicy Chicken Wings. We nibbled and drink and chatted. Every single dish was FABULOUS!! We shared the Braised Duroc Pork Belly entree. The pork belly was like butter, served atop Swiss chard with a cherry accent.  Dessert came - Tres Leche....I am speechless!! We will most definitely be back and I would highly recommend The Black Sheep!!!",
