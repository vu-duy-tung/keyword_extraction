    "text": "Love her new location. The service was great along with the ambiance and seating. The bar looks very nice too. Enjoyed the blend of zydeco (cajun) and jazzy (Orleans style) music playing.. wasn't too loud. My favorites are the Crab & Artichoke dip and Gouda Grits w/ shrimp & catfish ... but today we had boiled crawfish for lunch to get our fix for crawfish season. They were boiled to perfection with the right amount of spicy seasoning. They were easy to peel (especially since they're in season right now) and were medium in size. We're so thankful to be able to get good crawfish so far from home. Ordered beignets instead of the delicious Bread Pudding w/praline sauce this time. It was hard to choose.. they're both so good and are a nice way to end any creole or cajun dish. We're SO glad she opened Lola's in Summerlin:)",

I'm not even lying,  those grits alone are the stuff of legend!  The restaurant is beautifully decorated and a super cute place for date night or brunch.....aside from the bizarre experience we had on Easter Sunday, where we legitimately had to wait 20 minutes (yes, I timed it)  to receive so much as a glass of water and another 10 minutes to order because only 1 poor very pregnant waitress was literally taking the orders for half of the restaurant while a million bus boys and other staff literally wandered around the dining room.  I actually had to flag down one of the bus boys just to get us glasses of ice water and ask if we could please order our food.  Eventually, the food did finally come and I was able to eat my grits and be happy again.  This was by NO means the poor waitress's fault and she apologized all over herself and was incredibly sweet.  She even took the chicory coffee off of our bill because, for the first time ever, it was actually horribly bitter.  Usually, it's delicious.  I have no idea what happened that afternoon with the bizarrely slow service and gross coffee, but every other time has been so excellent that I will not hesitate to return.  I need my grits fix every few months!  And don't hesitate to order their bananas Foster bread pudding!",

    "text": "Bourbon Street, French Quarter, Jackson Square, Garden District, Lola brings New Orleans taste, atmosphere, sophisitication, and spice to Las Vegas, Nevada. City leaders met at Lola's Louisiana Kitchen yesterday following the NFL Football Stadium Meeting and had a delightful time with Lola herself as she presented great gumbos, seafood, sausages and fine wines to the entire party. We didn't want to leave. We were there all night. The last to leave, I have to admit, that the dishes were so delicious that I didn't take pictures of any of the food, we were too busy eating to take photographs of the dishes. The conversation was lively, the interior classy, and conversation intellectual, and as soon as the crab cakes, salads, gumbo and jambalaya arrived to the table with fresh, buttered, toasted bread rolls, we started to dive into our large plates without taking photographs for our friends to see. So you will have to go there, but the community in Summerlin all embraces Lola's New Orleans style Cajun spice as a special treat to living in Summerlin. You have to try this restaurant. I miss New Orleans. Lucky for all of us, Lola has brought her Louisiana kitchen cooking to us so that we don't have to travel far.",

I had reservations and when I arrived the hostess seemed busy and said it would be an hour wait however because I had reservations she would do her best to fit us in, we waited and waited and waited  after 30 minutes past our reservation time and no acknowledgement or keeping us informed of why my reservation wasn't honored we decided to sit in the bar and have dinner there (something the hostess could have also offered).  My disappointment is that is customers are valuable and our time is valuable simple suggestions, options or better communication could have made our experience better during our last visit.

He let us try this port wine that definitely exceeded our expectations, we are actually a bit of wine snobs. Although I wasn't drinking this night my other half ordered a Moscow mule that was made to perfection, outside of the drinks and awesome service Dominic just has a great personality. For dinner we both ordered the fried catfish platter with the same sides of green beans and red beans and rice which was cooked to perfection.

We tried the Tiger Dip (which is similar to cowboy caviar), peel and eat shrimp (which come peeled and ready to eat-bonus!) and shrimp remoulade (this one was my husband's fav). All three appetizers were great. Honestly were were pretty full but decided to share an entree since we have talked about going to Lola's now for a few years since we live within walking distance. We ordered the Roman trio which is somewhat of a sampler entree with red beans and rice, etoufee and gumbo. The entree was just ok....bordered on the lines of \"meh\", I was definitely more wowed with the appetizers. Will definitely try this place again as bartender was friendly and made a great cocktail.

Our group started with the grilled oysters and some chicken wings as appetizers. For my main course I ordered the catfish and grits. I don't usually like catfish but I wanted to try something different.   The food was ok. The flavors weren't as dynamic as I was hoping for and bordered on bland for some of the items. Overall the food was not particularly memorable. One coworker who had suggested the place for lunch was disappointed with her meal and mentioned she wasn't interested in returning again.  Service was friendly but forgetful often leaving our glasses empty far longer than I would have liked.  I don't see myself going out of my way to return.",

    "text": "Being from Louisiana, I am always harder on places that claim to have New Orleans or creole cuisine.  I originally heard about this place from Diners Drive-Ins and Dives years ago and that is when I visited the original location in North Las Vegas.  It was ok but the place was a little tight and so was the parking.  After finding out they had a new location, I wanted to try it again.  We were in Vegas this past weekend and four of us went to the location in Summerlin.  The place was easy to find, had ample parking and an awesome menu.  It was so hard to decide what to order so we basically ordered almost everything.  I was happy to see char-grilled oysters on the menu and it did not disappoint this far from New Orleans.  We also had the crawpuppies and crab & artichoke dip to start.  Three of us ordered the Mardi Gras Combo and my brother had the catfish poboy and the roast beef poboy (yes he ordered both).  Everything was great!  Then we ordered the banana foster bread pudding, banana pudding, and chocolate cake (to go of course).  Had that later that night all awesome!    Last but not least I have to mention our server, Seana.  She was a real trooper and so sweet and attentive considering all the food we ordered.  She also recommended Orange Bowl Salad to my sister and we helped her eat it because it was that good.  I even took a photo and when does a salad get a photo op.  We will be back next time we are in Vegas, count on it!  Thanks for a great dining experience and a great taste of home.",

    "text": "This has been on my radar since it opened near where I live.  I've been to the original Lola's on Charleston Boulevard and I wanted to give this place a try.  I was seated promptly and was brought iced tea by a server.  Then I was left to peruse the menu.  Another server came along and asked if my order had been taken and when I said it hadn't, that server took the order.  It was short--a cup of gumbo for an appetizer and the crawfish etouffee.  Then there was a wait for the soup to be brought which was delivered by the original server.  I had not half finished the soup when the same server brought my main course--one of the things I find most disconcerting about restaurants.  The server said something along the lines about being sorry this came out so fast.  Is that OK?  No it's not, but I took the dish.  There was one other table occupied in the dining room and you can't get the courses evened out?  The soup and the etouffee were very good.  There was some Louisiana brand hot sauce on the table that said, \"One drop does it.\"  No it doesn't.  I shook several good squirts and it still wasn't spicy hot but was better.  That has nothing to do with Lola's but Louisiana brand hot sauce would be my last choice in the future.  The etouffee was made with a rich brown roux and had some kick to it, enough that I didn't bother to ask for a different hot sauce.  I enjoyed it the way it was.  There was a good amount of crawfish.  Server 1 also brought me some more bread, thin slices, grilled a brief bit and nicely crisp.  For dessert, I ordered the sweet potato pecan pie with a dip of butter pecan ice cream.  The pie was very good.  It had a very soft texture from the potato and was not a custard-like pie as a pumpkin pie would be.  Very different and very good.  I enjoyed my dinner but I deducted a star for the timing of the service.  That simply should not happen especially in an almost empty place!",

My spouse had the soft shell crab P.O. boy and  he thought it was the best one he'd ever tasted. I ordered the crawpuppies which were flavored very well. For dessert we shared the sweet potato pecan pie. Which was good, it didn't live up to my expectations. We are gonna visit again and try some other foods at a Peter date",

When we arrived @ 3p, the parking lot seemed empty so we both didn't know if the place was even open. We checked the hours, and yup it was open. So we went in, the bar, tables, etc empty. We stood at the hostess stand for a few minutes to be seated, but my wife had to use the restroom so as she walked passed the dining area, she finally found a server to show her where the bathroom was.   We were told we could sit anywhere in the bar area, so we sat at the bar and were greeted instantly by the bartender, Dominic. He was great. Very personable. He let me sample a few of their beers before I found the one that was right for me.   We ordered our meals, I had the Roast Beef Po'Boy and my wife ordered Fried Chicken, side of Greens and fries. Everything was delicious.   All in all, everything was fantastic. I gave it four stars because of no one being at the hostess stand to greet customers. Not very professional.   Would I be back? Yes.",

We had it as an appetizer, ate it in between our meals, and finished another order for dessert.  We started with charbroiled oysters. It was very good. Esp if you like parmesan cheese. We wanted to relive our meal at Drago's in NOLA. But it was too charred. Left on the grill a little too long I think.  For main entree, the hubby and I shared a jambalaya and the bronzed shrimp and grits. Sooooo gooooood! Very good flavor and perfect spice level.   One less star because the food took forever to get ordered and took forever again to get to you. If you're a in a rush, this is not the place to be.   Overall, great lunch!",

While we were trying to get the waiter's attention to order he walked by as if he didn't notice and then after he took several steps past our table turned his head back and said \"I'll be right back\" as he continued to walk away.  And not in a nice voice.  And he wasn't \"right back.\"  The main dishes were fantastic.  Then another delay to get the check.

The gumbo and jambalaya were flavorful and packed with sausage.  The shrimp remoulade was generous with shrimp, and the remoulade was perfect.  The 3 soft-shell crabs were perfectly fried, fresh tasting, and VERY reasonably priced.  The service was attentive, prompt, and friendly.  Lola's is definitely on my revisit list when I return to Las Vegas.",

I had the shrimp and grits with the andouille sausage on the side. I'm not a huge fan of creole style food. So when I tell you I enjoyed this place, take note. My friend had the fried shrimp platter. And whatever batter they fried the shrimp in, it was light and flaky. We topped it all off with the banana fosters bread pudding. While it wasn't bad, it was probably my least favorite. The bread pudding was a little too soggy for me. But again, it wasn't bad...just not to my liking. Anyway, I recommend this place, and I wouldn't hesitate to come back.",

Lola's just happened to be only a couple of miles away from Red Rock Resort where we were staying. The ambiance and decor were delightful with Italian lights everywhere. My entree of fettuccine Alfredo with bronzed chicken was delicious. The pasta tasted homemade which I love and the chicken was tender and flavorful. My boyfriend ordered the jambalaya which he really liked. Lola herself stopped by our table before we ordered, she asked if we needed any help and she steered me towards the bronzed chicken which is not quite as spicy as blackened and was perfect for me. What a lovely, elegant lady! Our server was very charming and nice as well. I just have to take off a star due to the \"garlic bread\" basket that we ordered. I liked the fact that the bread was grilled but other than that it was plain, I couldn't taste any butter or garlic. I think bread like that should come with the meal and not be an extra charge.",

Lola's however, was great. My first thought upon walking in was \"This place could really use some Zydeco music right about no....\", and it kicked in before I could finish that thought.  Their gumbo is tasty, as is their seafood. I tried their crawfish etouffee, and they definitely know their stuff for this selection. The missus got the blackened fish with grits, and that's definitely prepared Southern style.  The atmosphere is nice, the servers were friendly, and the drinks were strong. I had a Bloody Mary, and the missus had a Blood and Sand. I was definitely cozy post-meal.  Cajun places are just hard to find in Las Vegas, but I will definitely return to this one as it's a respectable contender. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the Summerlin area.",

Happy hour on Fridays includes musical entertainment-some better than others. The food is very much under seasoned and lacked excitement. The food presentation needs to be enhanced. The appetizer shrimp cocktail was presented like an amateur did it. The catfish po' boy lacked the catfish and any flavor, but the bread was nicely toasted. The fries were not seasoned-not even salt or pepper. The iced tea was a bit too strong with the mint but presented well. Overall, I might revisit this location for a nice relaxing change of pace but I will not return for the food.",

I can't remember the first visit very much, but I do remember leaving satisfied and enjoying our meal.  This time, I was a little disappointed in the quality of the service and food. Our table ordered oysters, bread, the shrimp and grits, a po' boy, and jambalaya. The food was all okay, but service was SO SLOW. It wasn't necessarily the server's fault- she had a gigantic party and multiple tables with very little support. Not sure exactly what was going on, staff wise. We were starving and didn't receive any bread until our entrees came out (not that bread will make or break your experience, we were just hangry) and our drinks were slow to be refilled. We had to ask for utensils and napkins, but again that's just a nuisance, not a deal breaker! We ordered dessert- the banana bread pudding and the chocolate bread pudding. The banana bread pudding was great, but the chocolate bread pudding was just okay- the vanilla ice cream was the highlight of the dish (interpret that however you'd like).  This is an okay interpretation of NOLA-style cuisine outside of NOLA itself, but I've definitely had better. Maybe I'm just a snob because I've been wined and dined in NOLA, I don't know!",

Usually his picks are home runs and this one did not disappoint. We ordered the oysters as an appetizer, crab cakes and salad, and the poor boy sandwich and barbecue shrimp plate for entrees. The oysters were grilled in a butter lemon sauce it tasted good but it was nothing special. The crab cake salad came with two crab cakes about 3 in diameter and an inch thick on a bed of lettuce with a lemon garlic aioli sauce was very good. The po boy sandwich was good but it needs to be eaten as a sandwich or not the individual pieces. I ate some of the meat apart from the sandwich and thought the meat was dry but later was eating it with a sandwich and it didn't seem dry. The barbecue shrimp plate came with five shrimp rice and a spicy sauce. We thought the sauce would be spicier because in the menu it had two fire icons next to it. It was not spicy and kind of small for what you pay.",

I felt uncomfortable sitting at our table. I felt like I was in an under decorated, sparse cold atmosphere, like a gymnasium. The food was fair, but their are so many better restaurants in this town. By the way Burger King is next door. Sorry",

    "text": "Overall I was hesitant to try this place because living in the south plus being born in Maryland my standards for southern cooking are high . The other location was never an easy option to get to so when looking for a fun place to eat I was excited to see this was here .  My rating is solely based on the food because I believe service can't ruin an amazing food experience .. but our server Emily didn't even introduce herself plus she got our drinks mixed up which is a problem since my mother and I both had surgery that makes us sensitive to sugar and dumping . Plus before we even realized the drinks were wrong she brought my children's drinks in adult cups and made me feel terrible for asking for cups with lids my son is only seven and my daughter is ten but with special needs (not visible ) but I didn't even feel right having her switch her drink just had to be a drink monitor   Not only did Emily not apologize for mixing diet and regular but I legit had to ask if she wasn't comfy serving us . Then she just stated she felt like she poisoned us and very clearly it just wasn't a match .  When I return I will make sure not to have her serve me .  I accidently made the reservation thru yelp and I don't know if she treated us this way due to that or she just did not like us but definitely a coaching experience is here to have her be a little more friendly. The food however made up for it .. I saw how Emily treated her other guests and she just wasn't friendly with us which definitely on a tab that is $100 with tip kind of sucks.  I ordered two appetizers and a bread basket to start.   The garlic bread is so delicious but there are so many better ways to fill up your tummy unless your starving id probably skip it.  Next up was the crab cake and crawpuppies both were super delicious and had the balance of flavors I look for in soul food .  I ordered the fried oyster platter and southern beans with bacon and potato salad and it's huge I couldn't finish it all after sampling my family's food but it's so good.. the oysters were fried to perfection and great quality ..  My sons burger was just a party with cheese since he's young but man it was juicy and home made and I even liked it (I don't love beef much ) but this was a win .. which my son eating makes it worth coming here   My daughter got shrimp charlotte which tasted just like the menu states   My mom got the roast beef po boy named after Bree's and honestly it was super delicious too  We will definitely be back to try a bunch of other stuff especially dessert .. looks like they do some fun brunch options ..  I'll just be sure to make sure I don't get Emily and hope I get good service otherwise I will be back to update my review but the FOOD is so good..  Plus I love to support local",

(A must try) for our main course we ordered the jambalaya and the shrimp platter. The Jambalaya was good, it had a very rich flavor. The shrimp platter was even better! The deep fried shrimp was amazing, the shrimp size wad very generous and the badder was very tasty. We ordered that with a side of red beans and rice which were great. I'm truly not a fan of beans but these were so rich in flavor that I was very satisfied. For the second side we ordered Louisiana cole slaw which was super good! It had yellow peppers which gave it a good spin from your traditional cole slaw. For dessert we ordered the Lolas bread pudding. Well that one was a disappointment. It was warm in the outside and cold in the inside. There was really nothing special to it. As I mentioned before the food was good but the service was horrible. It took 35 minutes to get our appetizer! At that point they should have brought us bread or something to entertain ourself. Then we asked for cocktail sauce and that arrived 10 minutes later. And to top it off it took about 15 minutes to get a dessert that of-course is already made! Hopefully they work on it because with that service not even good food is worth it.",

The benedict did taste good.   We also ordered the beignets to share. They were a nice treat. Only thing I had issue with was that one of the three had none of the sweet filling, where as mine had a lot.   The other people I was with had more traditional lunch meals and enjoyed theres.

    "text": "For fans of the Louisiana-style Lola's on Charleston, this second location should please you.  It's a bigger restaurant with a large bar area as well as an outdoor patio.  Located on Town Center Drive near Summerlin Parkway, this Lola's sits behind the Sinclair gas station.   I don't remember if there was ever a restaurant there, but it's definitely a nice space.  We came for an early dinner on Wednesday around 5:30pm and the bar, complete with 3 flat-screen TVs, was busy with happy hour patrons.  We sat in the large dining area where there were two other parties present.  The decor has the New Orleans theme, with plenty of fleur de lis and Mardi Gras masks on the walls.  The menu is the same as the original location's, with dishes such as gumbo, jambalaya, crab cakes, po'boys, shrimp creole, and oysters available.  Dessert items include bread pudding and Bananas Foster.   I had the jambalaya with shrimp.  The shrimp were large and grilled just right.  The jambalaya had a nice little kick to it, but was not overly spicy.  I ate a lot of the boyfriend's grits from his shrimp and grits order since they were nice and buttery.  We had good service from our waiter the whole time.  My only gripe is that I wish they'd serve some bread; give us some carbs while we're waiting for our food, y'all. I just love bread, though.  Other than that, we had a good experience and will come back since it's more convenient at this location.  Also, there's a lot more on the menu I want to try next time, including the dessert.  Who dat!",

    "text": "I can honestly say never been to Louisiana but since the day went too the original Lola  on Charleston. I feel like jumped on plane right on to bourbon street. Just soaking all the finest things the Big Easy has too offer especially the FOOD! Lola she all about keeping too her creole background and sticking with traditional fare but doing it right way from family secrets passed on from one generation to the next. The original location I have been couple times always end up going with one of the Po-Boys. Too DIE for and the most legit ones find in Vegas hands down!! So hearing that they opened second location one much closer on my side of town. Excited!   Second location sometimes have my doubts. I always think about \"is bigger always better\". You start to lose focus on the things that made you popular in the first place and consistency of the food more locations add. Lola not only small restaurant but great story (one that featured on triple DDD). I love seeing small business owners successful. Right off the top from the moment walked in the vibe, and everything about the interior design screams at you Big Easy. It has the old school colonial look all around, they have area that assume all clams or oysters on ice shuck fresh too order, the bar area think really nice with the brick back splash look to the many widescreen televisions around it, different chairs around the bar area from bar stools to chairs, piano in the bar area (I went for lunch no one playing but assume they do have live music), and NO doubt part of Lola personal taste not miss. She big Saints fan. Dah! You have big Drew Bree artwork. There this shelf near the bar but it feels more like bookshelf at home. Here you have the little things from the mardi gras masks, beads, jars of candy, and all these little almost personnel items. Just the patio area kind of small but had so much personality. They have big oak barrels around, plants, and not just tables outside in open space. Heck you even looking out through window out on the patio area. Just the theme throughout the restaurant got lot of personality but everything that great about the Big Easy.   The food was awesome!!!! Like I said had my doubts. The Po-Boy went with the Roast Beef. The last time had the soft shell crab. I wanted to knock another one off the list. The bread with any sandwich make or break point for me. Po-Boy had so many imitations that once have the real thing never take step back. Lola is the only place get my Po-Boy on not place comes remotely close. Not just one thing but the BREAD really stands out for me. She gets it shipped in just for the sandwich. It not only the perfect compliment but could get bread all day long. The Roast Beef talk about lot of food. Messy. But nothing better then having the drippings from the beef, sauce, and some hot sauce icing on the cake. It finger licking good. I started with cup of gumbo. Perfect starter! Loved the fact both restaurant felt like the food was consistent. All the things that loved about the first one still are at the original and now the second location. Lola never meet owner that friendly, upbeat, and this passion for food not only saw on the show but in real life. She just happen be sitting at the bar area when I had lunch. It refreshing see owner go around check up on customers and asked my thoughts on my Po-Boy. No doubt plan on coming back again again..",

    "text": "My wife and I have started going to restaurant's we have never been to before and we rely on Yelp a lot for finding interesting and good places. Yesterday, Kathy and I, along with two friends, John and Amy, decided to try Lola's in Summerlin. None of us had been there before.  It seems that the Yelp reviews kind of ran the range but all I can say is maybe some of these reviewers were eating somewhere else and got confused. We found the service to be very attentive and friendly, as well as offering spot on recommendations concerning some of the dishes on the menu. I have to say kudos to Ashley who was our server. She did a wonderful job. And, Lola was actually in the house and took time to go to different diner's tables, including ours, to check on the food. Terrific job, Lola.  I was anxious to try the gumbo because I love gumbo and hadn't had good gumbo since the last time I was in New Orleans, some years ago. I ordered a cup to start my dinner. It was served piping hot over rice and was full of sausage and (one of my favs) okra, but all was blended into a dark, rich, thick stew that started with an awesome flavor I had experienced only in NOLA. Each bite left a slight but terrifically peppery finish. I'll be going back to have this for lunch very soon.  Kathy and I split the 'bronzed catfish' served with 'gouda grits'. The catfish was beautifully dark, without being 'blackened', spicy without requiring the fire department and moist. What was also nice was this was a thick, fat filet that served both of us and not those skinny flat pieces of catfish you see in so many restaurants that serve it.  Being a southern boy, I had no trouble deciding on the 'sweet potato pecan pie'. I was surprised at how large the piece was. I expected smaller. My first bite was heaven and each bite after the first confirmed my first impression. It was crunchy with the nuts and had a recognizable sweet potato undertaste. The best thing about it to me was that it was not cloyingly sweet and sticky, like regular pecan pie.  Needless to say, we will be going back here often since it isn't too far from home. We are anxious to try their special events, like the pre-Thanksgiving dinner, Sunday brunch and their barbeque.",

Kinda like an opened crab cake lettuce wrap. The gumbo was pretty good- nice size shrimp and sausage. The shrimp and grits is the main course every time- I almost think the sauce that surrounds the grits is thickened gumbo soup gravy- I don't know. The shrimp have a nice grilled flavor and they are jumbo. But the \"gumbo gravy\" makes it go POW! So good.",

Everyone at our table enjoyed their entrees. I had the jambalaya. It was full of flavor. The others had red beans and rice, chicken strips, sweet potato fries and catfish.   I'd like to point out that my sons chicken strips were very good. Tender breast (white meat) with a nice crisp outside.   We all shared the banana foster/bread pudding dessert. It was warm, not too sweet and the perfect ending to our nice evening.   I would recommend this restaurant and we are looking forward to coming back for brunch to try their beignets.",

Upscale version of the traditional Louisiana/Cajun style seafood type of restaurant. (Boiling Crab/Crab Hut)  Foods we tried: + Mandarin salad: had everything I look for in a salad. Fresh crisp greens, crunch from the sliced almonds and sweet mandarin oranges and dried cranberries. Can have with shrimp or salmon. Shrimp was bigger than I expected and the perfect addition to the salad. + Ettouffe: Kind of like gumbo (little kick of spice) with a scoop of white rice in the middle. You can choose shrimp or crawfish or a combination.  + Side of sweet potato fries: I couldn't stop eating these. Soft on the inside yet perfectly crispy on the outside. It's a big portion perfect to share.  + Banana foster bread pudding: perfect, warm with a scoop of either vanilla bean or butter pecan ice cream. Highly recommend! :-)",

We are not placed together we are a party of 13 and are placed at 5 different tables. By the way there was a party of 6 next to us sitting at a table with 14 seats. They took our order we waited very patiently, received 1 refill then we needed to ask. Seated at 11.35a orders placed 1 of our guest asked for the manager being that now its 12.45p and STILL no food. Matt (the ? manager/supervisor) informes us it is busy and like it was a whatever moment. Then we are told by our server that the desserts are being comp. My cousin notice tables with bread and was told that we are to ask for bread. Our food arrives at 1pm! Some food was cold, some food never came!!!! AFTER all that we then waited for drinks and our bill. A family of 4 was seated by us as we watched they placed their drink order, brought them bread and food was provided within 23 minutes. I asked them if they requested the bread and was told no! Still no bill no communication from the supervisor worst experience ever!! Waited so long some of our party got up and left.... Wont EVER return again. WILL STICK TO THE NICE FRIENDLY CHARLESTON LOCATION!!!!!",

My server was a man completely void of joy or personality or any kind of zest for \"seize the day\". No expression. Nada.   I got the crab and artichoke dip first. Delicious but soooooo greasy. There was a whole layer of oil on the bottom of the dish. Jeez. Well, I ate it anyway. Put a ton of hot sauce on it too.   Next, I ordered blackened chicken and a side of seasonal veggies and a salad with balsamic. My server, of course, the conversationalist he was, didn't tell me that their balsamic is basically oil, sugar and herbs. Tasty but super sweet and not what I wanted. The chicken was great, juicy and a little spicy. I added a ton of hot sauce (love it) and the veggies were sauteed well but again, sooooooooo oily. Mother of God. Heavy hand in the kitchen. It was basically swimming in oil. Too much for me. I ate them anyway.   Shrimp Creole was the last dish. Pretty tasty but I am pretty sure the shrimp is farm raised because, o boy, do your hands smell like shrimp butt if you choose to pick them up without a fork!! Gross. But the tomato stew was great with a nice strong creole kick.   It's good stuff, I love it, but a suggestion or two.. Pride yourselves with Wild caught seafood and ease up on so much oil. No need to drown sauteed veggies in all of that grease.   Server didn't get a decent tip, I don't tip faceless, removed and bland people. Sorry.",

D'Brees Po-boy--can't wait to have another--my favorite by far! Also had the bronzed chicken Po-boy and added the Mardi grad coleslaw--wow!  Soft shell crab and crab cakes with lemon aioli for appetizers-wet our taste buds for more! Not only was the food terrific the waiter Alex really knew his stuff. He made some great recommendations that did not disappoint.  We also liked the atmosphere. The restaurant was busy. Normally when people are seated next to you on all sides their conversations become part of the dining experience. We were never bothered by that. What we did hear was the best LIVE piano jazz. Truly New Orleans style!  Come for a meal, come for an appetizer-the soft shell crab was to die for with its Creole mustard dipping sauce-YUM, stop by for an adult beverage and great music. Chances are you'll catch the owner  Lola Pokorny helping in the kitchen  All I can say is we've  never gotten a bad meal. True Southern food and hospitality at it's BEST",

I ordered about $160 worth of food only to be given food that was spilled everywhere. I called in to speak with the manager (Matt) and was completely disappointed at his unfriendly response. Although he apologized he did not take ownership of the way this food was packaged. I suggested they put more soupy items in a container with an actual spill-proof lid and not just the aluminum containers. After stating he didn't even remember my order (his words), he had a bit of an annoyed tone placing blame on the company who delivered the order. Then told me they actually do not do business with this third party company and cannot be held responsible. That's a very confusing statement as it is because how was I able to place the order then? Anyway, no accountability was taken and instead I was met with annoyed management. Unacceptable. Unfortunately my family was very turned off by this and wont be supporting Lolas.",

    "text": "Wow!  This place is busy!  I went here for dinner with my wife last Saturday around 6pm and the parking lot was packed.  When we got there, we were promptly seated in the back of the restaurant and our drink orders were taken.  My wife god a Sweat Tea and I got a water.  My wife is a connoisseur of Sweet Tea and she was extremely happy with the taste.  It was perfect, she didn't have to add any additional sweetener to it.  As an appetizer, we both got a Bowl of Gumbo and a Crab cake.  Crab cake was good.  I don't really like crab cakes but this one was okay.  The Gumbo was delicious!  I liked the melody of meats contained therein.  One thing we both noticed that was it very salty.  Almost instantly our heads started to pound, so we both started drinking more to offset the affects of sodium.  I was feeling fine after a few minutes and my wife didn't finish her gumbo.  What did I do?  Yep.  I ate hers too. It was soooo good!  But my head almost instantly started pounding again.  So I finished off my second glass of water.  Refills here were super quick, even though we were seated in the back.  These servers have hawk eyes and it's much appreciated!  For a main course my wife ordered the Catfish.  I ordered the Salmon Grilled with Fries and the Vegetables.  Food took a little while to get out, but we were busy with our appetizers and the free bread that they brought out.  The bread was nicely toasted and had a nice buttery flavor to it.  When our main courses arrived, my wife instantly loved her catfish.  I tried some as well and it was pretty good.    My plate was grilled salmon with fries and veggies.  The salmon portion was pretty generous.  It was perfectly grilled. Not too dry.  The fries were OH EM GEE good! I have a secret (not now so) love for potatoes and it did not disappoint.  Nice, hot and crispy with the right amount of seasoning.  I almost felt guilty dipping them in ketchup.   The veggies on my plate were an assortment of onions, peppers and mushrooms in some sort of oil.  It was good. I ate it all it was so good!  We were stuffed, we couldn't possibly eat anymore.  So what did we do?  We got dessert! :)  My wife got Bananas Fosters and I got the Chocolate cake with ice cream.  Her Bananas Fosters once again impressed her and I got a bite of it as well.  It was very pleasant and sweet.  My chocolate cake consisted of what seemed really more like a brownie with a scoop of ice cream on top.  I'm not complaining, it was very delicious and definitely hit the spot!  We paid or check and finally left.  The service was great, the ambiance was awesome.  It felt pretty intimate.  The place was clean and thank goodness there is ample parking on all sides of the building!  We will definitely start coming here more often now.  Highly recommended to try this place out if you like Southern food!",

    "text": "Had dinner at this lovely place this past weekend while on a trip to Vegas with the boo thang. We were meeting one of his friends for dinner who recommended Lola's and cited it as one of her favorite places to eat. I've never truly indulged in Creole cuisine so I was really looking forward to eating here after reading some of the Yelp reviews. For me- it didn't disappoint. We arrived to Vegas on Thurs night- around 6:30p...by the time we got dressed for dinner, picked up his friend and arrived at Lola's it was around 8:20 pm and the restaurant closes at 9 pm on this particular night.   We were greeted promptly by the hostess and our server gave great recommendations on food and drinks. We ordered cocktails but the star of the night for me was the cuisine. For myself, I ordered the \"Bronzed Catfish\" dish (catfish over cheesy grits w/andouille sausage and a mushroom ragout).  My BF ordered the jambalaya and his friend- the gumbo (both which were served over rice).   Our food arrived in a timely manner and I have to say I was satisfied. The portion size was plentiful- it came with four catfish fillets over a nice mound of grits. Now I will admit- I'm usually the first person to grab or ask for salt to season my food (old habit) but my BF always gives me the side eye so that I taste my food first. :)  The first bite of grits had me smitten- I love cheese and Gouda didn't disappoint. Between the grits and the sausage/mushroom ragout- the entire dish held so much flavor it needed no additional seasoning whatsoever.  Sold!   Now my BF and his friend didn't quite feel the same about their dishes. My BF had never eaten at this restaurant but has had jambalaya before- he said the first couple of bites were really good but the overall dish was just \"alright\" in his opinion. No further elaboration given. His friend said the same about her gumbo- \"just alright\". Since she frequents this establishment- her offering of why the dish was just okay was that perhaps the chef rushed in preparing our dishes since we had arrived so close to closing time. It's possible- but I'm happy that I was satisfied with my dish. Enough so that the next time I'm in Vegas/Summerlin- I'll try it out again....only in the afternoon this time. :)   Oh and I did hear that brunch on Sundays is a must try! My recommendation is to try this place out...... #happyeating",

The oysters at Lola's didn't even come close.  I think that they forgot to put the oyster under the cheese topping.  There was a teeny tiny piece as though they cut them in pieces to make them stretch farther.  I sure missed the nice plump juicy oyster that should have been there.",

Took another 15 mins to actually receive drinks. She \"kindly\" brought extra syrup for my daughter's waffle(that we didn't request or need) and then charged us extra for it. All the food came out cold (probably because she forgot about us AGAIN). Don't order the Eggs Benedict with soft-shell crab. It sounds really good but was awful. The crawfish hush puppies were decent, but $6 for 4 tiny hushpuppies is a rip off. Expected at least double what was served. Their menu said boiled crawfish were through end of June, but actually they stopped serving at the beginning of the month. Definitely not worth a trip across town and we will not be back.",

BAD IDEA!  The food was awful.  Crab Cakes were lacking crab, were mushy inside with the texture of pre-chewed food  (GROSS).  At 2:30 pm on a rainy Monday we were the only table in the restaurant.  The crab cakes were taken off the bill and the chicken fingers we replaced them with were marginal.  The French Fries were limp and the grease tasted old.  The owner, Lola, was in the restaurant and she couldn't be bothered to say anything to us. We could her.  It was not as if she was in a office doing paperwork.   Lola's needs Restaurant Impossible.  Our server was very sweet.",

It was that the oysters were brown and rubbery tasted bad and are now turning my stomach.

So, to have a place in my hometown that delivers the same quality of food,  well, it was amazing to me!  I've brought so many friends here and told many more about it.   With that being said....  my mom, husband and I came to have lunch on Tuesday.  I had received a BOGO on FB.  And I hadn't been in a while and haven't been to NOLA in 2 years.  So why not.  I'm pretty sure that we realized quickly why there's been the BOGO on FB.  The food was absolutely horrible!!!!  The place was super dark and empty.  I ordered my prior fave, shrimp and grits.  The grits were not creamy,  old and gooey like paste, but not creamy.  Super gross!!!  The ragu was meh and the shrimp were extremely over seasoned.  My mom ordered a salad and asked to replace the shrimp with soft shell crab.  The server never came back and said that wasn't possible.  He just delivered her salad with uncooked shrimp and said it would've been an up-charge of $2.  We would have had no problem paying the extra $2 so she could have what she wanted. That however, wasn't an option given.  My husband ordered a roast beef po-boy,  he said,it was hands down the \"worst\" po-boy he's ever had.  He was unable to chew the meat because it was so tough.   I actually hate that I have to write this review but apparently,  you guys aren't taking it seriously anymore and it shows.  Unfortunately we will not be back ..... yep,  it was that bad!!!",

We started with the crabpuppies; I was disappointed because the portion was very small and the dipping container was a throw away cup.  It was served in a tiny saucer. The appetizer just looked cheap, although it tasted good, what little there was of it. I have the shrimp and grits, while bae had jambalaya.  These portions were a bit small, but tasty, but never enough to take some home.   It is rare that I finish a whole entree and still have room for dessert...like very very rare.   To finish we had the banana fosters bread pudding and it was to die for. Their drinks are a bit overpriced as well as their menu of food items.  It was tasty, but too pricey. I don't mind paying to eat, we routinely spend a couple of hundred dollars of dinner.  However, for this kind of food....it simply isn't worth the price.",

He hails from two of the Best strip restaurants in Las Vegas, now featured here at Lolas. Fantastic flavors Louisana, French can't say enough. The fried oysters are out of this world. Lots of salads, seafood to choose from. Desserts are heaven had the flourless chocolate cake, beautiful and melt in your mouth. Banana Foster, exquisitely prepared and beautifully displayed. Art on a plate. They serve Brunch, have live music Thursday, Friday & Saturday. Prices are reasonable. They even have fresh veggies, figs, apricots, peaches, plums out of their own garden there on the property. Chef Claude is a master in every way, can't wait to go back. Well worth the drive from the strip. Great service and everything you'd expect from a great strip restaurant without the price. One quick tip there are 2 locations. I love the one in Summerlin...",

The second bowl had 3 shrimp and slightly more sausage than the first. When I say shrimp I'm talking about small shrimp. I don't know the exact size but I'm sure they are the least expensive, high count size at the butcher counter.  Our other friend who ordered the barbecue shrimp received five shrimp and they were only slightly larger than the ones in my gumbo. He looked at me and said \"I can't believe I'm paying three dollars per shrimp for this.\"  My bowl of gumbo, my friend's bowl of gumbo, and my friend's barbecue shrimp were very disappointing. I basically had a bowl of roux with six slices of sausage and 3 small shrimp.   On a positive note, the restaurant was clean, the ambience was nice and the staff was professional and polite.",

I would definitely recommend getting reservation, though, if you're planning on showing up on a weekend night. The food was tasty and budget-friendly. They have a pretty big happy hour, too, which is worth checking out. I didn't order seafood, though, and felt like the non-seafood still tasted pretty fishy. I'm sure it's all cooked right there together, and I didn't mind it too much, but if you're allergic or hate the taste of the sea, I don't think this would be a good option.",

His dish was awesome, he loved the crawpuppies too.  I also enjoyed my dish & the grits was very buttery but I thought was a bit thick.  For me the crawpuppies were salty but again, hubby likes it. Desert was delicious and just enough sweetness to it.   4 stars for great service and good food, we'd return to try other dishes.  However, for a Louisiana type of restaurant, I found the place to be costly and I wish they had binget hence, less 1 star.",

The pricing is reasonable as this is an upscale restaurant. I would highly recommend it. This place is perfect for wedding parties, bridal showers, dates... just about anything. It's a Southern Soul Food style restaurant with an upscale design. Pretty Fancy... but not too pricey. Even the food decoration on your plate looks like Hell's Kitchen. We loved it and I believe you will too. Apparently, there are 2 locations in Vegas. We ended up outside of the Vegas strip by about 20min's. We thought we were going to the one near the wedding chapels. But I hear that both locations are excellent.",

    "text": "My first experience was a 2 star.  I actually never finished my review and I'm glad I didn't.  I think I was having a bad day.  I remember hush puppies being hard little moon rocks and not much else.  I went back to eat at the bar on Friday.  It was early and it was packed.   One bartender was clearly having his bad day but Adam was a rock star.  I just wanted a beer but everything that is popular now is kind of \"yucky\" by my standards.  They popped one open for me and it fit \"yucky\" and poured me another I liked.  I would have paid for the one wasted but there was no disagreement, attitude or anything but \"let's find one you like\"  POOF. It appeared.  I had the shrimp and grits.  Normally I am the slowest eater on earth.  Not only did I snarf it up in an unlady like fashion... but if I was at home I would have licked the plate.  The shrimp wasn't the star of the dish.  The gouda grits with the sausage and sauce... one word... OINK!  The new location just doesn't have the right kind of funk for Cajun.  I wish they could do something to the outside.  They are trying on the inside but it still doesn't reek Cajun to me.  What WAS appropriately funky was the pianist that started at about...uhm... 6pm? (early by live music standards)  I loved everything he played and how he played it.  I sat next to a regular who clearly knew the servers and the menu inside and out.  She was very helpful.  As she waived and talked to other people I realized a good portion of the crowd were regulars.  That's always a good thing.  My only complaint is the bar stools were heavy.  They don't swivel and they were tight next to each other getting in and out was hard.  That was minor.  There were some lower tables and chairs in the bar area close to the piano.  I'm definitely going back for the music and food on another weekend.  BTW, it is smoke free (inside at least... I didn't sit outside).  I'm not a smoker but I could totally see a successful cigar lounge attached, outside or next door.",

Think upper crust New Orleans rather than Bourbon Street. Service was attentive as well.  But my Shrimp Po Boy ($12.99)  was a misstep, unfortunately. The bread was fine, there was enough shrimp (although the sandwich as a whole was a bit on the small side), but it was super salty. Not spicy, just salty. The tartar sauce even was salty. I definitely should have gone with the catfish and grits, as was my original plan.   The bread basket was good, warm and buttery, so that was at least pleasant. Despite the po boy,  I'll return, but just will order something else.   Perhaps just an off day... Eaux.",

Had I only been to Sunday brunch, I would have knocked a star off because the menu is limited (discovering right before going in the menu online and having my pick ready to go before finding that out).    My first visit, I had a crab cake appetizer (which was very tasty) and chicken wings  - they asked me what level of heat starting with 5 and going way up from there.  I said a \"6\" and the things nearly burned my lips off but they had really good flavor.  My next visit, I had the bronzed shrimp and grits.  Fantastic flavor but damn spicy!  About mid way through, the spice again started to make me uncomfy.  I should mention I have had grits before and these were the best I have had.  Maybe it was in combo with the sauce which contained andouille sausage - which was nice too, but they were cheesy and tasty.  The staff was friendly and attentive and the atmosphere nice and \"New Orleansy\".  I think what makes this place a 4 star instead of 3 1/2 is that it's different than the place down the road and that's a good thing to me. I'll come back again",

I went during happy hour and took advantage of their discounted menu, opting for fried crawfish tails and grilled oysters. Sadly, the oysters weren't discounted. The fried crawfish tails were lackluster at best, tasting mostly of fried breading and something vaguely fishy. On par with your average fried shrimp from any fast food place. The grilled oysters that I had been craving were just as bad. They were tiny and overwhelmed by the garlic butter. For $25, I came away hungry and disappointed. I won't be making that mistake again.",

We finally went for the first time about 4 months ago, and now we can't stop!  My go to dish is the BBQ shrimp with the gouda grits instead of rice, lots and lots of their light and fluffy garlic bread for soaking up the sauce, and a crab cake that is pan fried to perfection and isn't overwhelmed with bread crumbs or other useless fillers.  Just crab crab crab.  Yum-mee.  There's a great bar area for watching the games, lovely indoor dining and perfectly accommodated outdoor seating.  I really could eat here twice a week, although I'm sure my thighs wouldn't love me for it.  The menu has so many amazing looking dishes, and I know I should venture outside of my regular order but it's just so danged good!  But my hubs has had the gumbo on several occasions and raves about it, and our kids love the various po' boy sandwiches and soft shell crab.  Really, there isn't one thing I see on the menu that you could go wrong with.  So glad we finally ventured into Lola's.",

    "text": "We have been a fan of Lola's since she opened her first place, and we always told everyone we knew they had to eat there. The food has always been excellent. The problem was that the charleston location is kinda small, and we are impulsive eaters. We rarely make reservations, and once she started getting busy they started requiring reservations. However, I don't think they ever handled reserving tables correctly, which discouraged us from going there as often. For us being comfortable is important to the enjoyment of the meal. There was more than one occasion we were told they only had the small, crowded bar table available. Even though the entire time we ate there were at least 5 tables that sat empty.  We were excited when Lola told us about her new location, it was near us and bigger, she assured us we wouldn't have these problems there. It turns out even in this larger place we have the same problems. We went in on a Saturday, we were asked if we had a reservation, we didn't. We were told it would it be 10-15 mins. We looked around they had about 10 open tables, so we asked not to be seated at one of their awkwardly long two tops, no problem. 40 mins later we were taken right past three regular sized tables to one of those two tops. When we asked for a different table the hostess hemmed and hawed, but then took us to one of the other tables. We were seated for about two minutes when the other hostess came over and told us we couldn't sit there. When asked why she said they like to reserve that table for people with disabilities, we apologized and said we didn't realize someone with a disability was waiting. She replied there wasn't anyone with a disability coming in. OK. So we pointed to another table in the back of the room, to which she replied, \"no you can't sit there either.\" When pressed she refused to give a reason.  Like I stated earlier, for us being comfortable is as important as the food being good. If I am going to spend my money on a meal I want to enjoy it, and there are plenty of restaurants that want my money, and will treat me accordingly. This wasn't the first time the hostesses were less than polite. And we had mentioned it to Lola, which can only mean it is her policy.   Needless to say not only will we not be coming back, we won't be recommending it anymore.",

Hubby had the shrimp po boy and he was in love, I tried it also and it was definitely the best I've ever had. We also split a piece of fried catfish. The catfish was huge!! Very meaty, but not seasoned well in our opinion. We saved room for desert, wish we wouldn't have. The bread pudding was nothing to write home about but hey.

The beverage menu was presented in a vanilla folder with stains on the pages.   When my wife asked for a glass with her beer, the response was we don't have any clean glasses but I will do what I can to find you one.   A clean glass was delivered several minutes later.  About 30 minutes after sitting, we had not yet received any food, so the waitress asked if we wanted some bread to tide us over.   When dinner was finally served, 5 of the 6 people in our party expressed how salty (I mean way over salted) the food was.  Lola came out to our table to ask how the food was and we told her ... salty, very salty.   Besides having slow service, the wait staff seemed confused as if they were out of sync.

The building and set up is so cute very southern. I love this place in the area is great. It's right next to Summerlin. Once we order we were so excited, we're going to New Orleans this summer so coming here was a must. My friend ordered gumbo my other friend ordered red beans and rice and I ordered fettuccine with chicken. First off I want to say that the chicken was so well cooked and seasoned I wanted more. They brought out bread and it was delicious. We all decided to split out the males because they're very big in proportion. I had a little bit of theirs and I might add on that I'm not a big fan of a lot of brown spices. So I wasn't really able to enjoy their dish but I did love mine. I do recommend this place to anyone that wants a little southern food in their life.",

Lola was there, visiting each table.  The food was great and I had noticed that some of the produce is grown near the entrance to the restaurant.  Try to save room for dessert - I can see why Lola's Famous Bread Pudding is famous!",

    "text": "Something's Missing.....  Was excited to try this place as it is near home and somthing different from the chain restaurants.  We went in around 5:30 PM on Saturday night.  It did not appear very busy, with only one other party in the \"main\" dining room, a few full tables on the patio and some guests at the bar.  Nice re-decorating of the old Ruby Tuesday's.  The hostess walked us right by 10 or so four tops to a small two top -  (we are not small people).   I asked to be seated at one of the larger tables and was told, they were all reserved.  When I said: \"Oh, really??\" while looking at the lobby and the room, she said OK, I guess I can make adjustments.  Please note that during our hour plus time there, only 4-5 other parties came in....did ALL those reservations cancel?  Our waitress did arrive quickly, and took our drink order ( just water).  My husband ordered the fried catffish platter and paid for the upgraded sides of grits and red beans and rice. I ordered the Roast Beef Du Bres sandwich with just the gravy.  While waiting my husband asked me ift we get rolls or bread, and I said I guess not?  It took some time for the order to arrive.  Hubby loved the catfish and the grits, but the portions were a bit small for the price.  My sandwich was disappointing.  It really had a bitter flavor and the gravy was lumpy.  It was like a pulled pot roast with no seasoning.  I guess all of the other mayo, mustard, etc. might make it better, but I always have my sandwiches/burgers plain - I can really taste the quality of the meat that way.  I got the fries as my side, they were luke warm and a bit limp. So I won't order this dish again, sorry Triple D - not as good as I thought it would be.   We decided to try the desserts which we rarely order dining out as we are usually way too full.  We  had the sweet potato pie and the bananas foster bread pudding.  It took about 15 minutes for it to arrive and both were disappointing.  The pie was hot with way too many pecans on top - it was flat and stringing, couldn't taste the crust.  We both had a couple of bites and then left it.  The menu did not state it was served warm - would not have ordered it.  The best thing about the bread pudding was the ice cream and brown sugar topping - I would order that alone. The three pieces of banana were hard and the bread pudding was more like a piece of stale banana bread and pretty bland.   While eating we noticed all of the other tables were brought a bread basket, some even before they ordered.   Earlier I had asked our waitress for future reference if we had to order bread or did it come with the meal?  She said, it came with \"soupy dishes, like the gumbo\".  OK, so  why did others with just sandwiches and those who hadn't even ordered gotten bread baskets?  ( I also noticed other reviewers raved about the bread that was brought out right when they sat down.)  I know this seems like I am making a big deal out of it, but I think she just forgot to bring it- why not say so and offer it?  Between this and the hostess, it seemed like a lot of excuses, making the customer feel like they are asking for too much??? The tab was $50 for a meal and a sandwich and two desserts.  The one big thing missing was the \"hospitality\" piece that makes guests want to return.  Funny, that we found this Friday night at another new spot we tried - they acted like they really wanted us to be there and come back. We will try Lola's again, as I know any can all have an off day - and hubby loved the catfish.  Maybe this time, the \"missing\" pieces ( seating, bread, seasonings, hospitality) will be in place!  I really hope so, as I WANT to like this spot.",

    "text": "This review is based on my visit on Mardi Gras. It is a very busy night. So I was expecting the restaurant to handle this day better. They are so behind on reservations. We were seated in the courtyard, but it was also raining slightly that night. So when it started to sprinkle, we asked our server how long it will take to get a to go order. He said 10 minutes. I'm writing this review and so far we've been waiting almost a half hour for our order. I'm sure the wait will just be as long if we will be eating here. May I suggest the restaurant invest in some covering for their courtyard.   Also maybe they should invest on some pagers. The only bright thing about this is our server who was really nice. And knowing that I'll have my crawfish when I get home.  Ok, we took our order home, and this is what's in it:",

Here is a following chronological list of things I liked, and things of which I was not too fond:  Likes: -The exterior of the building is lovely -There is a vegetable and herb garden near the entrance  -They have Louisiana Hot Sauce (thank God) -One of the waitresses switched out the uncomfortable prison chairs for vastly superior, sittable chairs  -They have Fiji water -The staff is pleasant  -The Gouda grits with the mushroom ragout & andouille is delicious  -The bread pudding is magnificent   Not so Fonds: -The interior is painfully dark -The chairs were either purchased from IKEA or are a prison surplus donation -The default water option tasted like I was shotgunning a public bathroom faucet  -Upon ordering the hot crab and artichoke dip, the bread that accompanied the dish came to the table early and was cold by the time the hot dip arrived  -The crab dip had an unpleasant, burned fishy smell.  The taste was fine if you didn't breathe while eating it.  -The portion sizes are not proportionate to the cost per item  -The seasoning on the fried catfish was very interpretive.  We didn't get it.   -Upon asking for a spoon, the waiter set the bare spoon directly on the table instead of placing it on a clean surface  -I can literally still smell the dip as I sit here writing this and I'm honestly screaming internally   May be back, may not.  Again, very strange experience.",

We've been craving the charbroiled oysters that we got from the amazing and wonderful Felix's restaurant in New Orleans and we found that same wonderful deliciousness here in Las Vegas at Lola's!!!!!! While we were there I made plans to go back! Yes not even out of the building making plans for the next time! The ambiance was great! I hate being cold when I eat (forgot my sweater that I usually have to take to restaurants) and didn't even need it because the temperature in there was great as well!

I would say, the cheesy grits and shrimp became the star on my plate. The sausage and catfish not so much. There's plenty of spices mixed up with this meal so if you are not into spices or if you are prone to heart burn, avoid ordering this. The best part of our visit were two things: the banana pudding with burnt marshmallow frosting on top and our very attentive server. He had a long hair. He was thoughtful enough to get me an extra bowl of grits for my son since the plate with the spice has some kick to it. Make sense why locals and tourists come to check this place out. I would come back for another set of meal for sure.",

The catfish and grits were perfect in every single way. The flavor was on point and the Gouda grits were delicious. My red beans and rice were really good too. The andouille sausages were hittin.

So when a business trip brought me to Las Vegas, I was excited to see if this innovative city could produce some authentic creole cuisine.  Service: the hostess was a little bit dry, but everyone else was very friendly and attentive.  Ambience: nice, calm at 11:30am, fleur de lis and other New Orleans inspired decor all around.   We ordered the catfish and shrimp platter with softshell crab with coleslaw and sweet potato fries on the side, along with a cup of gumbo and crawpuppies as appetizers. The waiter assured us that most of their seafood is sourced from the New Orleans area. When the food arrived, I found that the fry batter wasn't particularly flavorful and the catfish was watery. The crawpuppies were good with remoulade sauce, but it would have been nice to see plain hush puppies on the menu. The gumbo was decent, but not as complex as other gumbo I've had in New Orleans. Halfway through the meal, we were brought a crab cake, which had a wonderful crab flavor and was one of the highlights of the meal, along with the sweetened iced tea - no gritty sugar packet required.   Overall, this is a nice place to eat, but the food is not the best New Orleans style cuisine you'll ever have.",

They have a very lively bar with fun drink combinations. A grand piano with music almost every night. All different kinds of music. It has a very New Orleans feel obviously from the name LOL. The food is absolutely stunning. It is the best New Orleans inspired food I have had outside of New Orleans and that includes the Orleans Casino. I love everything on the menu however I could wallow in a tub full of their Gouda grits. The staff are always very professional they're happy hour is between three and six. The menu is decently priced but the happy hour makes it even more worthwhile. This place can be as intimate or is boisterous as one would want. I love the spot it's just around the corner from my house :-) I will be back.",

I really wanted raw oysters as I'm not really a fan of oysters any other way but these were delicious.  We ordered 6 and wished we had gotten 12! Yum!!  Had the catfish po boy which was good but nothing mind blowing.    I like that Lola's offers all the Abita brews!!   Man I can't stop thinking about those oysters that I almost forgot to mention that the fire grilled garlic bread is also to die for! The bread is so light and airy!  We had the bananas foster bread pudding and the regular bread pudding.  Both were delicious.    Servers were great!  Yes, I'll be back to watch a Golden Knights match with a couple Abita brews!",

We made a reservation just to be on the safe side but when we walked in the place was virtually empty, we were seated in a matter of seconds so that was great.  Items Ordered: Gumbo ($4.79) Bronzed Shrimp and Grits ($16.99) Bananas Foster ($7.99)  I started off with a cup of gumbo, it was very thick, hearty, and flavorful with a good amount of chicken, sausage, and shrimp. After finishing the gumbo I moved on to the shrimp and grits,it is definitely a must try, I really enjoyed it. I'm not a huge fan of grits but they really do know how to make them right here, they tasted like gritty mashed potatoes with cheese. We ended our meals with the bananas foster which was good but too bitter for my liking.   I can't wait for my next visit to Lola's. The food was great, the staff was very courteous, and our waitress was attentive and helpful. I think Lola's is as good as it gets in Las Vegas for cajun/creole food.",

The taste was not authentic New Orleans flavor-highly seasoned with heat & salt did not quench my anticipation of the savory blends of seasonings known in NOLA cuisine. Soft shell crab PO-Boy was cooked to perfection although lacked the \"full-dressed\" experience. Nice quality of French bread just needed that extra touch of remoulade sauce. The jambalaya was another disappointment. Overly seasoned tomato-drenched rice with a few shrimp & cut smoke sausage resting on top is not jambalaya. Cheesecake Factory or The Grand Lux have a much better product with a more generous portion with a similar price point and neither boast of being a Louisiana restaurant. A visit to either one or both would  be beneficial to help tweak your recipe. The live music was on point & augmented the inviting atmosphere. We don't drink but others in our party said your mixed drinks were tasty! Lastly, we spent good $$$ to come home hungry.",

Southern creole is one of my favorites.  Looks like there's a good menu here for brunch, but I was really craving for some Crawfish Etouffe.   I got some craw puppies to start.  They weren't kidding when they said craw puppies: 4 very small pieces of hush/craw puppies.  Very tasty, but I don't think the 4 is shareable, unless your party of 4 doesn't mind having just 1...tiny...craw puppy.    Then came the crawfish etouffe, served on a big hot plate.  Since I was served with a huge portion of this, I took it home to go.. Typically, I don't do leftovers, but the flavor was so delightful, that I had it for lunch the next day.     Between the Summerlin location and the downtown location, I would go back to the Summerlin location for better parking and bigger space.",

If you are lucky and there is still the supply, you can enjoy it on a Saturday, but don't gamble and just rsvp for a Friday to be safe.  That's what I did, so Earl and I dine here on a Friday.  The price per pound of crawfish is $10.99.  I ordered 2lbs for myself and Earl ordered the catfish plate with garden veggies, sweet potato fries, an gouda grits.  Each lb of crawfish comes with a potato and a corn on a cob.  Since it is still the beginning of the crawfish season, they are still small in size.  So yes, it's more work to peel each one, but the meat is still sweet and full of flavor.  It got a bit salty for me so I had to eat it with a bite of potato/corn on the cob to balance out the saltiness.  I also had the delicious sweet tea with my meal...I had to.  2lb of crawfish was enough for me.    While I was still finishing up my pail of crawfish, Earl ordered the Fig newton with butter pecan ice cream.  I took a bite of his dessert and I halted my consumption of crawfish to ensure I get my share of this delectable dessert.  It was so good!  It's no ordinary fig newton...it was fig newton on steroids!  But that combination with butter pecan ice cream was genius.  After we finished the dessert, I went back to finish my crawfish.  It was a delicious dinner and it satisfied my crawfish cravings.",

The place is very clean and uniquely decorated.   My boyfriend and I tried the crabcakes and a cup of gumbo all to share. The crabcakes were tasty with lots of lumps of crab. The gumbo however was very very good! I enjoyed the flavor a lot. They served it with the grilled garlic bread which I liked a lot. I really didn't want to share the gumbo with my bf because I could finish one by myself.   For main dishes, I got the jambalaya and he got the catfish with green beans and potato salad. The jambalaya was really good and lots of andouille sausages which is so yummy!  My bf dos enjoy the catfish and it wasn't fishy at all but we opted to get it pan seared with their Cajun seasoning, and we both agreed we prefer catfish deep fried. The sides we just ok to me nothing to rave about.   The service is excellent, they were constantly tidying up our table of empty plates. The server even gave us sweet teas to go when we were leaving.   Coming back for sure just to try the oysters!",

    "text": "I love the feel of this restaurant and appreciate the Cajun recipe's by Beth. Just walking up to this restaurant is amazing with their wide variety of vegetables and herbs growing outside the restaurant doors.  My favorite item on the menu is the mushroom ragout Gouda Grits. Honestly, I could eat them with any item on the menu. I usually get them with the Bronzed Catfish or the Bronzed Shrimp. People who are not from the South might wince just a little at the thought of having this southern porridge. I know, I understand - I dined with someone who couldn't withhold his grimace that I ordered catfish or grits. In spite of this, I managed to talk him into a bit of my food and won him over on the entire meal combination.   If you have never had grits, it is ground-corn porridge with Native American roots. Beth takes this Southern meal and adds her unique mixture of diverse elements that include mushrooms.  The draw backs of this restaurant are: The hostesses like to cram everyone in a central location unless you request the bar area, as they close down sections of the restaurant seating when it is not a busy day. This is not always a pleasant feeling for guest that would like some quiet time or want to have a conversation. I personally don't like to sit next to overly loud people, yet their central room has a huge family picnic style wooden table that divides this central dining room. It glows with lights from above and is usually occupied by a large party/family that have to yell to be heard from one end of the table to the other. When, I asked to be moved to another location when seated near this table - I was told the other room was closed. This did not make me happy. Thankfully, I was quickly accommodated by my amazing server Aaron. Good save.  The restaurant also charges a \"split plate fee\" of $5.00, which is tacky. I understand the business end and reasoning, but it's tacky to read on a menu and personally not a good way to win over a newbie customer. Thankfully, I didn't see that before enjoying a couple meals at Lola's.  With that said, you must try their Fig Delight for dessert and fresh brewed sweet tea with your meal!",

They also had a live combo singing and playing in the bar which was very good.  We actually stopped to listen and sing with them on the way out.  We highly recommend this restaurant so if you're looking for a great place for dinner that's not your ordinary dinner fare (unless you live in Louisiana), this is the place for you!!",

I would advice not to order any gumbo as, both dishes are served with it as as. First off, the grits are amazing! If you love cheese you'll get a cheesy bonus as these grits are made w/Gouda cheese! The catfish is great not too much of a fishy flavor just the right amount of seasoning. The shrimp is grilled perfectly not over cooked.  For appetizers we ordered the pull n peel shrimp basically shrimp cocktail. They were huge and super juicy! We also ordered the Crawpuppies. They were amazing, just like mini crab cakes. For dessert we had the sweet potato beignets. Baked to a perfection sprinkled w/powdered sugar. This place is one of my top favorite restaurants. If you're looking for a taste of Cajun this is definitely the place!",

The waiter was working on 2 other tables before he went to make the drinks. They finally showed up and we ordered. The char grilled oysters were extremely small. Not even worth ordering. We were told by the waiter our food would be up 5-10 minutes. He told us that 3 times. Really? I ordered the bread pudding for dessert. No candle, no whipped cream. The waiter came back later and apologized for not knowing that it was her birthday. $100 dinner and they charged for the dessert. we were both really disappointed with the entire experience.

One of the three of us lived in N.O. thirty years ago and he thought the food was pretty good so that might mean something. Garlic bread--plentiful, but not very buttery or garlicky...not really a hit (except it was inexpensive). Catfish PoBoy--I wouldn't eat catfish if you paid me, but my friend with the N.O. background enjoyed it, and my wife sampled the fries and reported them to be good. Shrimp Creole--wife liked it, I didn't try it. Jambalaya (with added shrimp)--I liked it--good amount of meat, and a nice taste with some blackened-like flavor. Mr N.O. tasted it and said it was good, so that might mean something.  The real hit in my book was the dessert. The fig delight was WONDERFUL.The fruity fig taste elevated every bite. That dessert I would confidently and happily recommend to anybody.",

    "text": "Wow...... and that is NOT in a good way. We attended a birthday dinner for 8 last night. Walked in to pleasant surroundings that are mildly reminiscent of New Orleans. Sadly, that was the last positive thing I have to say about Lola's. The joint was dead at 6:30 which seemed like a big ol' warning sign. But hey...it's almost Christmas so maybe?  Service was friendly but amazingly slowwwwww. I ask the server for suggestions on the menu and he did my big no-no....\"EVERYTHING\" he says.  Come on dude, there are better items that you can suggest instead of letting a new customer throw out a line hoping they are going to find the big one!  I also wonder if they were trying to emulate their idea of the big easy with this \"going in reverse\" kind of service. If so, it ain't workin'. Odd that you sit around a dead restaurant twiddling your thumbs with absolutely nothing to nibble on. Oh well....maybe the dinner will make up for this. NOT!  Dinners arrived with absolutely no mapping by the server so the expediter is wandering around the table asking where each (different) dish went. The funniest part of this was that some of the dishes had the wrong sides so nobody knew what was really their dinner. That is where the entertainment ended.   We had a very eclectic array of dishes and NOT one of them was up to par so let me point out the worst of the bad. Crab cakes....They looked so promising. They arrived looking like a crab cake should but when I/we took a bite they were absolutely mush.....not cooked through and not warm all the way through. EEW!  I NEVER send food back but this was a food poisoning in the making. Sure enough....the crab pinched at my queasy stomach all night. The other guests said their crab cakes were mushy but they ate them anyway....... out of shear desperation for food I suppose. Wonder how they did last night? The shrimp on my grits was tiny and tough. My hubby's catfish was mush. Looking around the table, not one thing looked good. In fact, no one said a word out of politeness but it was apparent this was a huge disappointment for everyone. Jeez...eight bad dishes. Well...I guess Lola's is consistent and NOT in a good way.  Almost forgot to mention. We brought a birthday cake and they wanted $1. a slice to cut it. I brought all the equipment, plates etc. so I cut it FOR FREE. God knows a dead restaurant with bad service doesn't want to cut a small cake. To top it off, they served the worst coffee ever. (dessert) I was expecting a lovely blend of chicory and french roast but instead they served a watery substance that they called coffee (thinking swamp water)  in the tiniest cups with no refills. What a joke!!  Commander's Palace....you got nothin' to worry 'bout........and my prediction is Lola's Summerlin will not be around long. My predictions have been spot on so far but I will eat my words if they are a resounding success. BTW... my words are tastier.",

I got jambalaya, which is one of my favorite things to eat. I hate to sya this but I didnt LOVE it, I liked it. It was just a tad dried and not super flavorful. Whatever. I'll try something else next time.  On to dessert where it all ended well, it was GREAT. Love the apple bread pudding, so good.  I will return.",

For our entree we shared the red beans and rice, that was pretty tasty. We also tried the bananas foster bread pudding and that wasn't too bad either. The waitress was really nice and the live music was a plus. I would try this place again. If you are a True lover of crab cakes, DO NOT GET THE CRAB CAKES!! You will be disappointed.",

That's exactly what they serve up at Lola's of Las Vegas- southern hospitality included.   Once you pass through the the glass doors you are greeted by an ornate fleur-de-lis and drawn in further by the savory aroma of Cajun blackened dishes and distinct creole spices.  Subconsciously you (along with the other patrons patiently waiting for a table) start licking your lips in anticipation.  For those visitors seeking just drinks or don't mind sharing a table, Lola's offers a full bar along with a beer-hall-style long-table immediately upon entry.   For Lola's 2nd location in The greater Las Vegas area the atmosphere and decor modestly highlights some stereotypes of NOLA but doesn't overdue it with kitschy stuff thrown on the walls. Instead, the cuisine is allowed to dominate your experience and memories.   The menu offers a hearty blend of Traditional Cajun dishes and classic creole fare from fried oysters to gumbo to etouffee to jambalaya and beyond. Staying True to The Big Easy; the selection of fish dishes are plenty and how you want your fish prepared keeps Lola's authenticity pure.   For those who seek out new dishes and enjoys discovering flavors this place offers a whole new worlds while keeping you comfortable in knowing familiar choices are ready for plating.   This food doesn't disappoint at all.  Rich in spice, alive with freshness and packed full of authenticity.  This food is so authentic New Orleans my father ( who was born and raised in just outside of NOLA in Bogalusa) became full of nostalgic feelings of his grandmother's cooking as he savored bite after bite. He especially recommends the red beans and I the Etouffee!    The staff is very attentive and offers great descriptions of any dish that you might not be familiar with- without making you feel foolish for asking.  For me, at the end of my meal, my plate was licked clean,  my stomach was full of great foot and my mind full of new knowledge. I'm ready for my next Cajun meal.   Overall, if you're in Vegas looking for something you won't see on Iron Chef and if you want great food that leaves a lasting impression, get your belly to Lola's.  It's a Mardi Gras for your mouth!",

The bronzed shrimp and grits is a dish they're known for. It's an excellent dish with five large shrimp atop cheesy and creamy gouda grits with a spicy ragout full of bold flavored andouille sausage and mushrooms. The crab cake platter was decent. Like most other items here, even the crab cakes have some heat. They're pan fried with little filler but also lack the big jumbo lump pieces of crab that make crab cakes meaty.  Desserts are quite good. The signature bananas foster bread pudding is large enough to share. It's a massive brick of custard soaked, creamy bread atop caramelized bananas and covered with a sugary sweet sauce. The sweet potato pecan pie was a balanced display of sweetness with a crust that's thin and flaky.",

I was told by several co workers that Lola's was the place to go.  Overall food quality was great. It was probably the closest thing to NOLA that Vegas will offer. My favorite part of the meal was the bread- it is truly authentic New Orleans. The red beans and rice were not as I am used too however they weren't bad. I had a Chicken Po Boy and the chicken was blackened and amazing! The fries were house cut and looked to be twice fried. ( not my preference )  Service was a bit slow due to our server having a 10 top party right after we ordered.  I would go again and you should at least try it for yourself.",

We were having a rather late dinner-8:45 p.m. We were staying on the Strip and were a little exhausted, suffering from very little sleep and a long commute from Cali. SO, we looked for something tasty and CLOSE to the strip and happened upon Lola's Charleston (outside of downtown) location.   The results were great-my hubby had the Bronzed Shrimp and gouda grits and I had the blackened catfish, homemade fries and greens. My husband raved about his meal and I enjoyed mine too. However, I am a collard green lover, so if you order the greens keep in mind that they are turnip and mustards and you must like those types of greens. HUGE upside-they have peppered vinegar, just like home!    Try this place with an open mind. I will go back to try several other things. Unfortunately, I was too full to try dessert, but the banana's foster looked tasty!!!!   I liked the available parking lot and the ability to eat outside on the cute little patio if you chose.  There were families and couples dining when we arrived and everyone was so friendly. The service was GREAT-thanks Dianna!!!!!  We had assistance from the busboys as well. They scooped our plates up when we were finished (after asking politely if we were finished). As you can see from the empty plate they REALLY did not need to ask my hubby if he was finished!

Made reservations which, while there was a few open tables, it was definitely still busy.  Ordered the following:  -Grilled Garlic Bread (definitely recommend-- the char paired with the garlic and crunch was delicious)  -Appetizer Bowl of Gumbo (enough to share with my husband-- great for warming up your appetite and to get a nice taste of their gumbo without being full for dinner)  -Catfish and Grits (DEELICIOUS!)  -Roast Beef Po'Boy (SO SO GOOD! Might not be your typical fried seafood po-boy but the mix of meat, bread, and dressings was so flavorful. The gravy was the best part-- especially sopping it up with your fries. Can get a little messy but don't be afraid to lick your fingers!)  -Bananas Fosters Bread Pudding (Perfect for sharing-- hearty, warm, and a great ending to the meal)  Generally I can't do spicy (hot sauces, sriracha, etc.) but the way this food is made is a good spice that brings a nice warmth of flavor to your mouth. We will definitely be coming back... hopefully to try their brunch!   Service was awesome also :)",

    "text": "I took my husband here for his birthday. We were really excited to finally be able to try it since we had heard good reviews. Unfortunately we did not feel the same way. The Gumbo reminded me of the beef gravy you get in a jar at the grocery store with 2 tiny shrimp thrown in. No chicken or sausage to be found.  My husband had the jambalaya with chicken and shrimp. It was mush. There were 3 shrimp and again we were hard pressed to find any chicken. Needless to say we both left without eating very much On a positive my husband did say he really liked their house made whisky and my sweet T was good. My husband is now requesting a do over on his birthday dinner at somewhere he might actually enjoy.",

We had the banana foster bread pudding and creme brulee for desert. The bread pudding is served warm with ice cream, and it's a generous portion. It was delicious! Our friend had the white chocolate bread pudding (seasonal) and loved it.  Overall, great experience. The place is clean, nice decor, and the service provided by Ashley was outstanding.",

They had only one server, which was the only good thing at this restaurant. We ordered the rice and beans, which supposedly had sausage, and we also ordered the chicken breast with coleslaw and potato salad. The rice and beans has 1 piece of sausage as decoration on top, but other than that, there was no more sausage. It was also tasteless! My wife's food was the same. She claimed that the potato salad and coleslaw was full of onions and peppers, but no flavor at all. It took almost 1 hour for us to get our food. There was a couple that came in and waited 20 mins before they got up and left because they were never approached at any point, or even got water. This doesn't mean it was the waitress's fault, that poor lady was even the one making bread! It was the management's fault for not staffing the restaurant properly. Overall, it was a terrible experience for us. We're never going back!",

They advettise lump blue crab cakes on their menu, but they served us salmon croquet. The gumbo was thick, too thick and desperately needed some fi'le. Then the waitresses accidently spilled water on one of our guest wetting him and his bowl of greens. (By the way the vegtables and fish were also bland). Instead of offering compensation they OVERCHANGED him for the meal and explained that complications with their register prevented them from doing a price adjustment. On top of that she took it upon herself to include a 20% gratuity to his bill. The nerve! Needless to say we won't be back and I couldn't in good consciousness recommend this place.",

Went with my mom and was instantly disappointed by the absence of warm, sincere service. Bartender randomly appeared and demanded my ID, then left. No greeting. Manager looked right at us but was as friendly as a rock. Only those that seemed to have prior relationships with staff were treated well.  Food was nothing to write home about. Sweet potato fries were good, but anyone that makes poor sweet potato fries has a problem. Mom ordered gumbo and was sorely underwhelmed, as it lacked flavor. Nothing created a mosaic of stirring, breathtaking flavor in our mouths.   But above all, service was a fatal blow to the visit. Trust me-you can get far better service from the guys at the Burger King right outside the door.",

So we walked in and the host was off in another world and didn't realize there were two humans awaiting to be seated until she finally got a clue from the bartender. I should have known this was going to set the tone for our visit. We were seated and literally waited for 20 mins to have our order taken. There were maybe two other tables occupied. It wasn't even busy so we can't even point the fingers at how busy it was. Meanwhile, the servers are just chitchatting, laughing, sharing memes and fighting in the corner. Only attentive person was the guy that brought out water. After waiting for 20+ long and annoying minutes and not being even acknowledged we had to walk out. No one even batted an eye. The absolute worst customer service. Not once did either server come say hi I'll be with you in a few or whatever needed to be said. Truly upsetting and a complete shame.",

The Tchoupitoulas was a little light on salt and didn't taste that good per my opinion. The Beef D Brees is however very good.

Tyler would show up as our server and he remained attentive through our the dining experience.    It was a cheat day and the tasty bread (free) that showed up at the table was quickly devoured.  So were the craw puppies ($6.99) we ordered.  These tasty little orbs dipped in a cajun mayo where a nice treat before the meal to come.  To wash the pre-meal down, I ordered a flight ($12.00) of Abita beers.  Headquartered out of Louisiana, the flight consisted of an Andygator, Turbo Dog, Purple Haze, and a lager. LAISSEZ LES BON TEMPS ROULER!  The meal consisted of combo plater ($25.99) loaded with a catfish, skrimps, fried oysters and a crab cake.  Tasty!  What I really coveted was MM's shrimp and grits ($18.99)!  It was just the right amount of spicy Cajun love!  Since it was a cheat meal....for dessert....we both enjoyed some banana pudding ($5.99).  Not your traditional sort of pudding, but a more modern take on this southern classic.  A great experience and we look forward to returning in the future!",

Being a Sunday, the restaurant offered unlimited brunch mimosas, a brunch menu and beignets. Unfortunately they ran out of fresh crawfish.  I inquired what was popular and my friendly waitress suggested the Drew Brees po boy sandwich - in addition, we had a order of jambalaya and beignets for dessert. Overall, the food was solid and satisfied my Cajun craving.  I enjoyed the atmosphere of this location over the original not to mention this is spacious inside even at the tables in the bar.

    "text": "It was my birthday a few days ago and my gf and I had just came back from a road trip. I wanted dinner in a nice place (not fancy but nice). Just like most of the places I end up visiting, Lola's was saved in my yelp bookmarks. We arrived and were immediately seated at a table of our choice - huge plus. I remember seeing bronzed shrimp and grits mentioned literally by every person on yelp, so I ordered it anticipating something amazing. My girlfriend ordered crispy catfish po'boy. For an appetizer, we ordered chicken wings. I was shocked to learn that they served either naked or Buffalo wings despite the name \"Cajun wings\" . Every creole/Cajun restaurant I've ever been to, serves wings crispy, generously battered in Cajun seasoning. When I asked the waiter, he looked at me as if I asked him to serve me the Moon lol after explaining everything, I asked to find out if the kitchen is willing to make the wings my way, I also asked that only flats are served, can't stand drumsticks he came back saying yes to both. After a while, we got our wings. I have to admit, they were crispy and really well made, very flavorful. The only bummer was that they served mostly drumsticks as oppose to flats as I asked. After the appetizer, our main course arrived. Everything looked really good. Taste wise, everything was just not bad. I finished my shrimp and grits but to say that I want to come back again for it, it's a no. Everything felt kinda dark and heavy. Don't get me wrong, I'm ordering grits, I'm not expecting a light meal. But I guess I was disappointed that absolutely everything on the plate felt heavy. Seasoning was okay but without a kick. I couldn't taste mushrooms in the sauce and Andouille sausage was lost in the dish. My girlfriend said pretty much the same about her poboy - not bad. Her sandwich came with a potato salad and it was inedible. She didn't finish her sandwich and didn't touch her salad, she didn't express any desire to take it home neither. For dessert, I ordered Lola's special bread pudding - another disappointment. The dessert was heavy, chewy, and warm outside but completely cold inside. I'm not coming back. 3 stars is for our waiter and the wings.",

    "text": "This is my favorite restaurant in the Las Vegas area. I heard about it two years before I went to eat there. I would meet people who disclosed they were born in Louisiana or lived in NOLA and I would ask them, \"Have you ever been to Lola's?\" One I remember, grabbed my arm, stared at me wide-eyed, saying, \"That's my favorite restaurant!\"  Today, I ordered, \"Lola's Traditional Jambalaya.\" It came in a perfectly sized portion. It was flavorful and subtly rich with intricate spicing that made me wonder why I liked it so much. How do they cook this???   Patrons and relatives have been begging Lola to write a recipe book. She has interesting stories for many of the dishes. She learned how to cook as a little girl sitting on her Grandma's knee. Brothers in her family had restaurants that she worked in. She has been working extremely hard trying to do \"this\" her whole life.  Everything, the polite and buoyant help (they saw me coming to the front door with a cane and ran to open the front door for me), the tasteful and beautiful decor. The large French Doors to the \"Private Room,\" the outdoor seating area, even the bathrooms!!!...All have been designed with attention to detail. Even the menu is fun to read. You'll want to order everything.  This is the best dining experience I have had since I moved here.  Now, if you want to compare restaurants, you have to mention Joe's on the strip for their fresh seafood, and others that fly in their ingredients. Lola's is so authentic, she only uses fresh genuine Louisiana Leidenheimers French Bread straight from New Orleans. The same bread is also an ingredient in her legendary Bread Pudding.  Lola's is the 'Real Deal.' This is how dining should be done. If you are lucky, when you leave, a beautiful woman with her name on the building, will sincerely thank you for coming, \"Thanks, Y'all!\"",

    "text": "For someone who has lived in New Orleans for a really long time and values the food, this did NOT live up to my expectations what so ever. I ordered the fried shrimp platter with fries and greens (the perfect down south meal)! The fries were unseasoned, with the exception of a ton of salt. The shrimp was unseasoned! The greens were the only thing that were truly decent, and I do mean decent at most. The was extremely over priced for something that was not half as good as the food in New Orleans. I was let down and felt like I should have taken my money else where. The only reason I am going this in-depth is because I have lived in New Orleans for years before coming here, and their food is one of the things that makes them unique and different and I was just let down. On a more positive note, the service was good and they were nice.",

    "text": "On Sunday Jun 30th we visited Lola's because they have great food. We have been there several times. However, on this particular Sunday we were in a rush to leave town, we live in San Diego. We took our Mom to enjoy a lunch. We thought nothing of it.  When we arrived home I realized I'd lost my wallet. After calling everywhere we'd stopped we called finally called Lola's. Low and behold, the person who answered the phone said they had the wallet. They described it as a Tommy Hilfiger wallet and the server had found it under the table we were sitting at. I was so relieved. This is where the nightmare began.  We asked our Mom to go to the restaurant and pick up the wallet. Upon her arrival she was told the manager wasn't in and they could not open the safe. She went back when the manager was in and was told that THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE WALLET!!! My heart fell through my stomach. I was sick. I asked my man to call and he was a bit more calm then the rest of us. He spoke with the manager and asked if they had cameras on the safe. Maybe even cameras in the restaurant that could be reviewed to determine the source of the problem. Maybe the wallet wasn't found in the first place. The manager said she'd call if they found the wallet. They never even called to say what effort they made to get to the bottom of it.   This was handled extremely poorly. I understand that I was the one who lost my wallet. But the chain of events that occurred showed complete irresponsibility and ever worse customer communication. I'll never again spend my hard earned money in this establishment again. It's a shame too.",

    "text": "I really loved the way this place was decorated it was a beautiful presentation especially the outside seating unfortunately what made this place up 4 star for me was that the service was very slow as well we ordered red beans and rice which is supposed to be according to their waiter one of their main signature dishes the beans were so close to being overcooked you could tell that they sat too long in the pot because they were over thick even the small pieces of sausage where very very soft compared to the extra sausage that we ordered which was a lot more crispier and yet greasier on top of the rice and beans now my husband did order the soft crab po boy which isn't one of the main favorites on their menu but we thought we try it unfortunately couldn't get pass the baity taste that it had. What was the main favorite for us was the artichoke crab dip and it was served with garlic bread that was an amazing dish I was pretty disappointed that it was such a small portion and something you would think would be a little bit bigger especially for the price but it was cooked to perfection and I rather pay for Perfection then pay for a bigger dish that doesn't taste well the coleslaw had no flavor at all even if you were to put pepper on it very very Bland it was a very very safe coleslaw I do like to come back on a Sunday for their brunch since that's when they do their unlimited mimosas and that's the only day they serve beignets.... so stay tuned",

Happy hour in the bar is well worth it, the drinks are well executed and martini's are served in large glasses filled to rim.  The happy hour menu is light and tasty.  The Gumbo is excellent and served with a dark rouge. For our dinner experience, everyone at the table was very pleased with their meal.  Cannot go wrong with the shrimp and Gouda grits.  My husband had same dish but with catfish. The menu is similar (or exactly the same) to their Charleston location.  Summerlin, please go and support our local restaurant! This place is a gem and worth a visit!!!",

    "text": "We had an out of town guest and were looking for a new restaurant to try with her that we thought she'd enjoy. As she's from Georgia I thought Lola's might be a good choice. This was based on reading on line reviews and two recommendations from friends, not personal experience. The look of the place is NOLA authentic. We were seated at a nice table in the large dining area but could still enjoy the live music from the bar area. The menu is pretty varies. Between the three of us we had the gumbo, hot wings and fries and the golden shrimp and grits. The shrimp dish was pictured on the menu and in my experience that is a good sign; I was correct. The gumbo was very good, the hot wings were crisp on the outside but juicy on the inside. The choice of sauces range from 1 5 which is a little hot to a 10 which is omg serious heat. The shrimp were delicious and the grits with the mushroom and sausage ragout were spectacular. Had we not had a freshly baled pecan pie at home waiting for us I would have tried the bread pudding. Something for next time. Lola, the owner, was there and making the rounds to the tables in play. She is really friendly and spent a lot of time with us discussing her restaurant, the food, her plans etc. She made us all feel as though we were her friends who had stopped by her house for dinner. She's very warm and engaging. The service was excellent from hostess to waitress to attentive bus boys. We had a great time. This was our first visit but definitely won't be our last.",

When I got the bill apparently the 2Tbs of sauce I got extra was $1. I would have like to have been told of the extra charge. My mother ordered the etouffee on my suggestion. When it came out it tasted of nothing but thyme. Horrible. I'll probably give it one more shot, but I'm afraid they've spread themselves thin with two locations.

In addition, out door patio seating is available as well.  Also, they have an amazing specialty cocktail menu with a talented staff that prepares them consistently well.  However, I was let down on my recent visit.  My wife and I came by for a late lunch and the first thing we noticed is that their prices have gone up quite a bit.  My wife started by ordering a \"House Bloody Mary\" - $8.00.  For lunch, I ordered a \"Family Favorites,\" Gumbo - $12.29.  The color, (Dark brown) and consistency of this dish was not very appetizing to me.  It came in a shallow soup bowl with a scoop of white rice in the center.  I was expecting more of a stew and it was the consistency of soup.  Flavor was ok.  I would not order this item again and do not recommend it.  My wife ordered a \"House Specialties,\" Shrimp Charlotte - $15.99.  This dish came with medium size sauteed shrimp and mushrooms over angel hair pasta in a light broth.  She enjoyed this dish and would order this item again.  Our meal came with their specialty bread and was quite good.  Bottom line for me, there was a lack of \"bank for the buck\" considering that $47 was spent, (including tax and tip) for lunch for two on a $8 well Bloody Mary, $12.29 for a bowl soup and $15.99 for a simple shrimp and pasta dish.",

Bartender abruptly approached to card my daughter ( 29yrs old), commented on her age then asked what we were drinking. Never said hi, even though I looked at him and said hi, just waited for my daughter's id then left.  Five minutes later I approached the hostess, explained to her it was our first time here, didn't know if someone was coming to take our order, if I had to go up to the bar ? She walked over to bar area, bartendar showed up shortly after that. Food was prompt, cup of gumbo lacked decent flavour. Shrimp in gumbo looked of the frozen variety, roux without flavour, okra cooked to that consistency which makes people not like okra. Asked another server passing by for check. Proprietor walked around chatting with patrons, but said nothing nor smiled at us. That is rude behavior in the eye of a dining, paying patron.  The hostess opened the door for us as we left, thank you. Her's was the best service we had from here. Did not feel welcomed. Will not return. The stars are for the Hostess.",

Not so, in fact when we opened the containers at home we called the restaurant and we were told that \"three is the number of pieces we cut one filet into\".  And yes we spoke to the manager. Disappointed at such misleading menu.  Taste was okay but won't be eating here again, $14.99 for one filet and small sides.",

    "text": "I've lived in Vegas for 4 years & I've been wanting to try Lola's since hearing about it/seeing the Charleston location. Since that location is a little far from our side of town, I was excited to try the new Summerlin location. My husband and his family are from Louisiana and I much prefer New Orleans cuisine over where my husband and in laws are from (sorry mom in law). However, I have to admit I was slightly disappointed in Lola's.  First we ordered the crawpuppies. They were just ok, you only get 4 TINY crawpuppies and they are definitely NOT worth the over $5.00 they charge for them. For my main course I ordered the red beans and rice. It was good, didn't knock my socks off, but decent. Not enough sausage, although I could have ordered, and been charged for, extra sausage. The thing that really irritated me was when we asked for ONE extra side of ranch dressing (cups were tiny) for my kids chicken strips we were told there was a charge for the ranch. The server apologized and was clearly embarrassed to have to tell us that because we all looked at her like, \"you're kidding, right?\" Now, is 50 cents breaking us? No. However, it's the PRINCIPLE here. I felt like I was being nickled and dimed. Most McDonalds' don't even charge for an extra side of sauce!  I really don't know if I'll be back.",

There's a po'boy that I used to order all the time, roast beef dressed and wet so when I saw the D'Brees roast beef po'boy I was excited to say the least.   The bread was stale! My companions were trying to explain that the bread is toasted but the reality is that the bread was stale! The picture makes the bread look crusty and the expectation is that it has a little chew. The answer is no. It was like eating the sandwich with a dry sponge. :(. The gravy was also not warmed up enough as you can see in the picture and very much on the salty side.   I also had their grits with Gouda cheese. It was good. A bit too cheesy for me...   The sweet tea was awesome tho. !",

I am so glad she suggested Lola's because we had a great dining experience with the service and food!  We came in around 5 pm right before the dinner rush and were able to be seated right away.  I think this used to be an old Ruby Tuesday's or Rubio's but regardless it was renovated very nicely.  They have a large patio area and garden with real herbs and vegetables out front.  As for the inside, it is a nice mixture of rustic and New Orleans Mardi Gras decorations.  Our server was extremely friendly and efficient adding on to the overall experience.     We ordered: -Crawpuppies ($5.29) - deep fried crawfish balls, a little on the salty side probably wouldn't order this appetizer again -Shrimp and Crawfish Etouffee ($15.99) - served over rice, the shrimp and crawfish are smothered in a flavorful sauce, really liked this would order again     -Oyster Platter ($14.99) - mom ordered this, the oysters I was able to steal from her plate were fried to perfection and were juicy, came with 8 oysters and 2 sides -Fried Oyster Loaf ($12.29) - dad ordered this, didn't have any but it looked tasty and good portion size as well, dad said he enjoyed it   My family really liked this place we will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I think being featured on TV can be a curse as an establishment has to live up to its reputation that is presented to the masses.  I've been meaning to go to Lola's for awhile but the Charleston location just isn't convenient. We drove to the new Summerlin location as the first Friday crowd packed the Charleston location with a 30-45 minute wait as told to us by the hostess. Since Vegas is small the drive wasn't long.  This location is really cute. Who ever did the decorating did a good job. It looked very comfortable, random (in a good way), and not tacky. We sat outside even though it was cold and they had heaters on to help.  I always like to try a variety of things the first time I visit a new place so that I know what to order next time.. If there is a next time.  We got a few appetizers to share: gumbo cup $6, crawpuppies $6, and crab and artichoke dip $10. I'm 99% sure the prices are accurate. I thought these prices were fair for the taste, portions, and quality except the crawpuppies.  As in not from the south I am no gumbo expert but theirs is probably the best I've had. My friends dipped the bread that came with the crab dip into it and really loved it. The crab dip had a lot of real lump crab meat in it and onions. It was good with the toasted bread. The crawpuppies were good but only came with four small balls. It's literally fried dough! I guess the craw fish in them is what makes the serving four.  I got the platter for $25. It came with fried cat fish, 2 fried oysters, 2 fried shrimp, one crab cake, and 2 sides. I was pretty full after our appetizers so idk if that's why I didn't enjoy my food so much, but I was a little disappointed in what I ordered. I'm not sure if the crab cake was the same as the appetizer one or the dinner one but it wasn't as good of a crab cake as I hoped for. Definitely average. They may have just over mixed it but it was a lot of filler. The one in the picture on the menu had big chunks of lump crab meat in it. The portion of cat fish was generous and it tasted good. The fried oysters were good and so were the shrimp. My friends both got bronzed catfish with Gouda grits and the sausage and mushroom ragout.  The last two things I got were the Gouda grits with sausage and mushroom ragout and then the bacon seasoned green beans. I really liked the grits dish. It wasn't life changing but it was good. The ragout really made it as plain Gouda grits would have been lame. The bacon seasoned green beans were over cooked and mushy.  My main gripes were the service and experience. The outside seating area sucked as people stood by smoking at times, the service was slow, and the chairs sucked. It took a long time to get our order taken.. The food was good but not good enough for me to want to go back soon. I think our server was alone so it was not good being seated outside. Overall I was a little disappointed and underwhelmed with the food after getting my hopes up seeing it on tv and them doing well enough to get a second location. I would go back but not anytime soon.  After looking at other's photos I believe we may have went on an off night as our servings of bronzed catfish were significantly less than the photos I've seen.",

Our waiter was handsomely charming and provided great service. Should definitely be a spot to try when craving some southern Cajun makings. So why the 4 stars and not 5? Ok so the menu is huge but my portion was a bite shy of a kids meal. I mean, I know I can put down a hefty plate but ONE chicken breast and a half serving of grits? Reminded me of a wedding dish sampler. It was great....but I needed more bites to be sure geez. Slightly overpriced unless you pay for flavor \"shrugs\". Also, it's supposed to be NOLA styled but they played country music. Ummmmm. Granted it was 4th of July so mayyyybbeeee that had a hand but it was surely awkward. Blah blah blah, will be back for some bronzed yumness but I may eat a sandwich beforehand.",

The food:  amazing.  my favorite is the blackened salmon.  i order salmon a lot and i think this is some of the best I have had.  It comes with your choice of 2 sides - the grilled veggies, the cole slaw and especially the grits are all great.  Shrimp creole is always good.

The reason being the ambience, great food and service Tuesday evening and it was busy, with piano player playing some old southern music. It was just awesome.  We dined at the bar, the service is spot on and the food was great. The bartender explained their house specialty which we ordered - Shrimp Charlotte - names after the owners sister - thin noodles in mushroom and spicy sauce - was super delicious. We followed that up with I believe a Louisiana  classic - Shrimp Creole spicy shrimp stew- OMG what a dish - we could not stop eating it - just the right spice level - ask for 6 out of 10 on spice level Overall it was a great dinning experience and we will be back. Strongly recommend   this spot",

I've dined in twice and both of those times everything was good.  However, I always end up with something in my pick up orders that has either texture or taste issues (such as an item being too salty, or the bread of the poboy being soggy from the contents).  The staff is always courteous, but I've been disappointed with the food too many times to give a higher rating.",

The dipping sauce was cold. Like unable to dip, had to be scooped out with a knife. Crab cakes-were good. I'd recommend ordering them  Gumbo-the roux was extremely dark and almost burnt. It wasn't served hot at all.  I ordered  Shrimp & Catfish bronzo It was close to be being burnt but nonetheless it was flavorful My family ordered  Alfredo(yes I know, it's a southern restaurant) It was just okay according to them. The salmon came with the skin on which I didn't understand. The Alfredo sauce was overpowered with garlic. The portion weren't huge. My 13yr old daughter finished her entire plate. The good thing about the desert is it comes in a huge portion.   The service was subpar to say the least.",

We decided to sit at the bar thinking we would get faster service. The bartender didn't have the best customer service he initially ignored us and we had to ask him to take our order so that knocked off a star. Other then that the food was amazing I had fried oysters with greens and potato salad on the side the greens were a little bland definitely needed hot sauce and salt. My friend had the jambalaya which was really good. I'll be back im going to try the other location next time.",

The dining room was not crowded and service was prompt. The dining decor remains unchanged. It still has that Mardi Gras atmosphere and interesting wall art.  Shortly after the arrival of our refreshments, a basket of warm, grilled garlic bread appeared. The bread was soft and had a hint of smoke from the grill. We ordered the Breaded Chicken Strips from the appetizer menu and Shrimp and Grits from the list of House Specialties. Food service was timely and our server Jaime was friendly.   The Chicken Strips come with French Fries and a Ranch dipping sauce. The chicken was crisp outside and juicy inside. The fries were just fries nothing special. The chicken was large enough to take some home for a second meal. The Shrimp and Grits were fantastic. Five medium size shrimps were pan bronzed, served over smooth and creamy grits that were surrounded by andouille sausage and mushroom ragout in a hot and spicy sauce. Just the right amount of heat for my taste. None left to take home. Remember to use the garlic bread to soak up the remaining sauce. Yum.",

If you like that southern/cajun and spicy flavor, you'll like this place. I ordered the Bronzed Catfish and Grits and it was delicious! Super savory grits and the catfish had so much flavor. My other 2 favorites were the oysters and banana foster bread pudding with vanilla ice cream. My family enjoyed their meals as well, but we had a couple instances where they forgot pieces of my family's order.  For example, my boyfriend ordered a cheeseburger with bacon, they forgot the bacon. Manager offered to take it back to add bacon, but we didn't want to go through the hassle and wait time to get another burger.  They also forgot my dad's sweet baked potato that is supposed to come with the Mardi Gras plate. Unfortunately, we did not realize this until the end when the manager stopped by to give us a free sweet potato pecan pie. Which is when my dad realized he never got his side of baked potato. Lol. But we gladly accepted the pecan pie.",

Between my family and I, we ordered the crab dip and bread, shrimp pasta, shrimp and grits and the etouffee then shared the bread pudding. The bread that came with the dip was so delicious. Toasted and butter and melted in your mouth. The crab dip was great too, we were all pleasantly surprised how much they did not skip on the crab. There were chunks in every bite.   I had the shrimp and grits. So so good! The shrimp had amazing cajun flavor and was cooked perfectly. The gouda grits were delicious and compliments the shrimp very well. The bread pudding was great as well!  Overall great experience, the food was 5 star and so was the service!",

My friend didn't eat all of hers either, but it did look yummy! Then I had the shrimp creole since there was no pork in it. Omg that was so damn disgusting, the shrimp tasted so uncooked and plain! The the red sauce tasted more like an oil taste than a spice to it. It was so weird because it looked so good but it was awful!

The other half has only had etouffee a handful if times with me, and doesnt understand what it should taste like. Was not the cajun, creole taste that I have been craving. No begneits or fried green tomatoes either.  The amazing server who was the bartender took great care of us. I would come back for service, maybe try something else? But lawd help them if they mess up shrimp and grits for me. The garlic bread is real good. Here is another gripe. The restaurant has the cutest outside sitting area that reminds me of my southern roots. I could really do without all the bungee cords holding the windows open though. I know we are a bit trashy in The South, but c'mon! You have got to find a better way to tie those windows open.",

If so, man I wanna visit Louisiana to find what there's in store!  I love me some spicy food, and Lola's is no exception!  Spicy & tasty!  Made a reservation for dinner with the wifey on a recent Friday night.  Date Night, y'all!  Got to the counter and was welcomed in with some sweet light jazz noise from the background.  Lively atmosphere!  Upon being seated, our hostess was the most helpful in explaining the menu to us, so nice!  We ordered:  *Combo Platter ($24.49) - 1 catfish fillet, 2 fried oysters, 2 shrimp (fried), and a crab cake *Bronzed Shrimp & Grits ($16.99) - seasoned & pan bronzed Gulf shrimp served over Gouda grits with an andouille sausage and mushroom ragout (served on the side for me)  Wifey's combo platter also came with 2 sides - she chose the Hoppin' John (rice simmered with sausage and blackeyed peas), and a baked sweet potato.  While waiting for our order, we were treated to a basket of grilled French bread - apparently Lola's imports Leidenheimer's fresh bread from Louisiana regularly!  This bread is fantastic, I can see why many of the restaurants use Leidenheimer's for the famous Po' Boys!  Our order didn't disappoint either, BRONZED = FLAVOR!  Their bronzed items are good - spicy with a kick, but somehow still with a very nuanced flavor.  You get the hot, but you also get the spiciness that works with your tongue in harmony.  Bits of umami everywhere!  Wifey liked that bronzed catfish fillet, and the shrimp and oysters were of a good size & fried just right.  Great batter, and I believe dusted with some of Lola's Cajun seasoning.  Wifey didn't like the crab cake that much so I ate most of it, but I rather liked it.  Quite a bit of crab, very little filler.  Good!  Lola's specialty of Bronzed Shrimp & Grits were pretty stellar!  The shrimp were so good over that bed of tasty, rich Gouda grits!  The andouille sausage and mushroom ragout added more unctuous goodness!  I sopped every last bit up with an extra basket of Leidenheimer's French bread!  No butter necessary!  My only gripe was the portion, but I do believe these are industry standard sizes.  But..I'm not an industry standard kinda guy!  I wish my bowl of Bronzed Shrimp & Grits was BIGGER!  This stuff was tasty.  Prices are a bit on the high side - we are in Summerlin after all, and we are in a little bit fancier casual restaurant.  We did have a coupon though for this visit of buy one entree, get one entree free - so that did help our bill a lot.  More tip for our fantastic server!  Lola's was a great choice for Date Night, and we will be back!  Very inviting atmosphere, very inviting comfort food.",

They had a special promotion on Facebook that gave us buy one get one free entree, so we finally gave them a try.   We opted for their beer flight for $12 and a sweet tea for drinks. We ordered shrimp and grits and the tchoupitoulas for our entrees. They gave us a few slices of the garlic bread while we wait for the food. The garlic bread was yummy. It was crispy on the outside and soft inside. The sweet tea reminded me of being in the south. My boyfriend enjoyed the beer flight. The shrimp and grits were delicious! The grits had this light cheesy flavor which paired well with the blackened shrimp. The shrimp was cooked perfectly! The tchoupitoulas was also very flavorful! I snuck several bites off of my boyfriend's plate.  I really wanted some beignets but unfortunately they're only served during brunch.   Service was great from Tyler. The ambiance reminded me of New Orleans. The food was flavorful and delicious. I'll definitely be back.",

I didn't know they only had table seating no booths, but it was very nicely decorated made you feel like your in New Orleans.   We ordered the garlic bread - which is imported from Louisiana ( after my heart), hot tea of course, the gumbo, the red beans and rice with extra sausage, and of course their famous bread pudding.   All of the food was amazing. I felt like I was in my grandmother's house. Which I can't say I normally feel.   The customer service was amazing and very attentive. They brought out fresh bread when ours got low. This was a great experience. I will be back to try their Sunday Brunch where I can indulge in their beignets.  Location is Town Center/ Summerlin Pkwy - ample parking.",

I wish I would've found out about this place a long time ago, because I would come here a lot. It's not a cheap place to eat at either, but is worth coming here enough.  Service 4/5: There server was really cool and attentive, we talked about football. He made sure our waters were filled. They did forget to bring out our appetizer, but it's okay because the main course was huge and filling.  Main dish 5/5: They brought out large pieces of garlic bread that that throw on the grill which has loI got the blackened shrimp and grits on the recommendation of the server. I love spicy food, but I felt it wasn't as spicy as advertised. It did have a nice kick though. The grits were cooked perfectly and were extra cheesy. The shrimp was cooked tender and not over cooked.   Dessert 5/5: The banana foster bread pudding is the best dessert I have ever had. If I was a kid, I would ask for this dish to replace my cake every year. It's a huge piece of bread pudding that sits in a caramel sauce bath with bananas and vanilla ice cream on top.",

Stunning southern vibes, with a great selection of premium cold beers. Whenever I have the hankering for grits, there's only one thought that comes to mind---Lola's, baby! The creamy goodness from the Gouda in their Blackened Shrimp Andouille Sausage dish is killer! I can't even begin to explain how mouthwatering the spice combination is; the perfect blend, w/the proper amount of heat, make this dish a top notch winner. I don't often consume shrimp or andouille for that matter, but this is the one dish that I cannot get enough of either of them. Wow! How can I not mention, their Banana Foster Bread Pudding! Yumm! Whenever we're in Vegas, it's no question that we'll be dining here. Enjoy! Xoxo",

I brought 3 of my friends and as usual, Lola's did not disappoint. First of all the new location is absolutely gorgeous. Loved the decor and open feel of the place.  Very inviting. Finally got to try the crawfish and they were the biggest I'd ever eaten. Amazing oysters too. We were fortunate to have come on a day when Lola made some special cobbler which was amazing even after stuffing ourselves with several menu items. And of course the Banana foster bread pudding was a must as well. Highly recommended. Very authentic New Orleans cuisine. You're doing yourself a grave disservice if you don't stop and dine at least once at one of Lola's locations whenever you're in town. Until next time!",

Why weren't we sat earlier? Whatever, we were hungry and tired. We ordered the Jambalaya and the Gumbo. The Jambalaya was very flavorful but a bit too spicy. I was sharing dishes with the boyfriend so I had the Jambalaya first. As I moved on and had the Gumbo, I tasted nothing but the texture from the Okra. But I really enjoyed the Jambalaya. Though it was a bit spicy, it was good. So food wise, it's a place to try. As for the service, let's just say that the bread was not given to us until our food came out.",

The A/C was not working properly so it was hot and steamy...maybe they were trying to replicate summer in New Orleans but it did not make for a pleasant dinner. Service was ridiculously slow and they could not get the credit card machine to work so we ended up paying cash after waiting nearly 40 minutes to track down our waitress to find out what the hold up was. Food was ok...crab cakes were really good but the rest was mediocre. So I went back a few weeks later and they still have issues with the A/C. Service was better but not what it should be. We asked for bread and it did not come until nearly the end of our meal. Eek! Had the crab cake again...I really liked it. My husband thought it was so-so. The shrimp and grits were amazing. Our son had the Crawpuppies and they were bad...none of us enjoyed the over cooked, fried mess. The gumbo was yummy and our son also enjoyed the red beans and rice. We tried Bananas Foster for dessert and hubby loved it, son and I thought it was just ok. Their wine selection by the glass is miserable. Overall there were a couple stand outs but not worth going back for.  Maybe they will get their act together as we were hoping to get a really good new restaurant in Summerlin.

Surprised how tasty the tenders were. Could swear they were fresh and not frozen. Fast forward to the present. As a frequent visitor on foodie trips to New Orleans, I was excited to have that great cooking right here. Tried Lola's after they opened on Town Center a while back. Food was good, but I found their prices to be expensive relative for the amount of food received. I was disappointed. Revisited the place a month ago at happy hour. My overall impression was unchanged; service was adequate, food good, and drinks standard. This place is okay, but does not rate high on my list of places to return to as there are many other wonderful places to enjoy. Guess it's still the closest New Orleans cooking you're going to get in Vegas.",

    "text": "The ambiance was pretty good for a Vegas resto.  Better than the usual franchise or strip mall setting... still a little too dark for my taste.  The service was mediocre, we sat in the bar so I didn't have super high expectations on that front.  The crab cake was pretty marginal.  There was more cake than crab and seriously... squirting mayo on as a garnish is something I would expect to see at Red Lobster (not that I have ever eaten there) not a garnish I would expect from someone that calls themselves a \"chef\".  This appetizer was served on a small saucer barely large enough to hold the crab cake so that each time I tried to take a bite the sad looking leaves of spinach (not bed of mixed greens) slid on to the table.  The gumbo was a salty cup of brown sludge which was mostly rice and somewhat grainy.  The sweet potato fries were dry.  The bronzed catfish & grits presentation left a lot to be desired.  On a positive note the fig delight was indeed just that, a delight.  We got out for $170 with tip for 4 people.  When considering this included 2 HH drinks and only 3 entrees and factoring in the quality of the food this didn't feel like a good value.",

    "text": "Pretty bad experience . My wife and I went there the other night and had a bad experience. First off, we are both from New Orleans and live here now. I do understand that the food might not be just like we would get in New Orleans, but was hoping for something close. Ordered cocktails, then appetizers. Wife got the crab cake and I got a cup of gumbo. The waitress then came back after a bit and we ordered dinner. Shrimp and grits and an oyster po boy. Waited a while and the food came before the appetizers. We told them that we didn't get our appetizers yet and then a guy walks up with the appetizers, but it wasn't our appetizers, wrong table. So, they wanted to leave the dinner and we said we would like to have the appetizers first. Then we were concerned our dinner would just sit in the kitchen and get cold. She assured my wife that \"it will be made again special, just for you\". So, they bring the correct appetizers out and the crab cake was ok. The gumbo was nothing close to a real gumbo. The flavor was all off and even the okra was CRUNCHY!! I'm not a chef, but I do know you have to cook the okra down. So, I added some seasoning and hot sauce and had just a couple of bites, and guess what? Our food comes out again!! So, we finished our appetizers and my wife bites into a shrimp and the food is cold. She sent it back and did not want it again. The oyster po boy was pretty bland, no seasoning and too much corn meal. However, the French Bread was good. So, we then order desert. Decide to go with bananas foster, which is pretty simple to make and can't really screw that up. Wrong!!! They put a raw banana in the sauce with ice cream. You are supposed to cook the banana a bit in the sauce. We cut into the banana and it was probably just peeled and put in. Then later, I got sick, just me, not my wife and had stomach issues until the next afternoon. Needless to say, we will never go back. I hope that someone from Lola's does read this and can address these issues. If you are going to represent being a New Orleans style restaurant, it should be. The atmosphere and decor remind me of home, but not the food.",

    "text": "I love Lola's! We usually eat at the downtown location as it's between work and home but I also have eaten at this location (town center drive). Both have great atmosphere and good servers but the food is why I go (and I often get \"food to go\").  My favorite is probably the house salad (actually called \"Signature Orange Bowl Salad\"). I usually get it with the grilled chicken. Great proportions so that each bite has most of all the ingredients (dried cranberries, orange segments, lettuce, candied almonds, good house vinaigrette, celery, and that grilled chicken - might be missing some ingredients but you get the picture). YUM - literally delicious and nutritious.  I also love their hamburgers (fully dressed of course) with fries. Good heavens those fries are good and the hamburger is juicy and well seasoned - simply tastes great! My husband loves their chicken strips and the house-made ranch dressing is outstanding. I also absolutely love the chargrilled oysters - and that bread to sop up all the juices. An amazing dish - just a great mix of flavors. Their desserts are great too (chocolate cake or banana foster/bread pudding are my favorites - both moist and full of flavor and I usually share (but sometimes we each get our own chocolate cake (and comes with delicious vanilla ice-cream). I am making myself hungry just thinking about it.",

    "text": "Visited soon after the place opened on September 19th. Was really excited to have something different near the house.When we got there we noticed that it was really hot inside. We had previously made reservations and requested a round table. Hostess proceeds to take us to a long table that had more chairs than what was needed. We asked the hostess if we could please be seated at a round table as requested. After 5 minutes they took us to a back room that had the round table. This room felt even warmer but we didn't want to leave since we were all hungry. The good thing is that they had fans. Ordered 3 cocktails and 3 waters and it took the waitress 10 + minutes to deliver the water and cocktails. To top it off she had to carry it all because she didn't know how to use a tray. I know they had tray's because I saw other staff using them. As for the food, it was not good. Maybe I should have waited for them to get the kinks out. Might give them one more try just to see if what I experienced was because the place had recently opened.",

Server was friendly and knew the menu well, might have exaggerated the flavors slightly or the kitchen was having an off night.  We ordered a garlic bread to start along with a cup each of gumbo and jambalaya, gumbo was tasteless, more of a bean taste, needed hot sauce and seasoning.  Jambalaya was nice, has a nice heat level.  Bread was dropped off, it was crunchy yet soft and quite nice, however we could not taste any garlic.  Turned out it was a table bread and server forgot our garlic bread. I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with blackened chicken, was told it was rich and creamy and the chicken would be Cajun spiced.  She was right about the creamy sauce, however the super thin sliced chicken was dry and tasteless, had no taste at all to it.  Johan had the beef and gravy po-boy, it again was on the bland and dry side.  Server did not once check on our meals, not during appetizers or entrees. Will give the place another go sometime.",

My fried chicken breast was completely flavorless and my green beans were hard to eat because they had not been cleaned properly (strings still attached to many). My wife's barbecue shrimp had to be sent back because the shrimp were so tough that it made them inedible. They even started charging for bread unless you purchased a 'soupy' dish. The only saving grace was our waiter, Tony. He was extremely friendly, apologetic for the issues, and on top of our table even though he was bussing his own tables and running out all food. He even had the shrimp dish removed from our bill and the bread charge waived because we got so much. He will be the reason we give Lola's another shot. We really hope that next time will be better!",

I had the catfish plate that included two sides of my choice (Grits and Green beans) oh and all you can drink mimosas. Our server was pretty good with the mimosas constantly returning to refill them.  Dinner: OK. We first started in the bar area because it looked cozy so we sat there, they checked our IDs and my friend was searching for her in her purse. Before she could even come to the conclusion she didn't have it the bartender started stating of nevada state liquor statutes. He was so rude. I would have expected him to say, \"no worries, you can still dine with us in the dinning room.\" but no, so i was really not thrilled with him. I chose not to drink in the dining area just because of him. Our dining room waitress on the other hand was lovely and took care of us well.   *Very disappointed to see that Grits is no longer an option as a side for the dinner entree's. You have to purchase a small bowl of it from the grits section for almost $7. It ended up being cheaper for me to purchase the catfish and grits meal with a side of vegetables.",

It was if I was walking into my great Aunt Sally's house who had inherited chairs and tables from thrift shops, garage sales and family members. Maybe that's the theme they were going for?  I was really underwhelmed by their menu selection, but per the waitresses suggestion, I settled on the catfish and grits. I have never had grits in my life, but cheese and starch didn't sound terrible. The catfish and sausage ragout were amazing. The only thing standing in the way of my appetizing dish were those nasty cheese grits! They tasted like salty baby food, just awful!  Service was unmemorable. The portions was pretty small for $16.99, but did I really want more cheese grits? Nope! I hear the bananas foster chicken and waffles is good. I'll try that next time.",

    "text": "Left a bad taste in my mouth. Went here 5pm Sunday drinks were fine, ordered wine and a beer and ambiance inside was nice. Waitress was very attentive and friendly. Husband ordered crab cakes which is his go to when available at a restaurant and said was one of the worst he had ever ordered. I ordered blackened chicken which comes with two sides. After checking list of sides I went for grilled veggies and beans and rice. Chicken was just ok, didn't taste any different than the Cajun spice you buy at the grocery story. Nothing special and definitely not restaurant quality. Up to this point I would give 3 or 3.5 stars.  Bill comes and I see if was charged $4 for an extra side. Assuming this is a mistake I let our server know who takes the check away apologizing that she will sort it. She speaks to Lola who tells her that it is correct, I ordered a premium side and I need to pay for it. I re check the menu and it said 'you may be charged extra for premium sides' which, fine. But don't send uninformed staff to tables for a normal order and not inform? Also.. how is paying full price for a side while not getting the two that I paid for fair at all? $4 is not the end of the world but it's the audacity and poor customer service that left the bad taste. I didn't receive what I paid for and was charged extra for something that was not clear. Wanted to return to try the poutine but forget it don't want to give them my business.",

Amazing food and a dangerously addictive house scotch will leave you in a heap of trouble, as you attempt to eat your soft shelled crab and shrimp etouffee through the bottom of your 4 empty glasses. Trust me, this scotch is THAT good. I am convinced some magic's are involved in the mixing of this drink. If you do manage to pull away from the drink while still managing sobriety, you will also find the gumbo is quite tasty as well. Oh yes I know good gumbo, and they do it well here.

    "text": "Here's my quick review of Lola's in Summerlin.  Yes, that's right.  Lola's has opened their doors in Summerlin.  If you've been to the location off Charleston near the Smith Center, then you know what to expect here and that's good grubbin' Nawlins' style.  Unlike the original location out here, this one has more space, doesn't seem to be as busy, and is a lot cleaner.  That being said, I'm still a fan of the original.  However, if I have choice, I'd make my way here when I'm craving the authentic stuff from Louisiana.  We dined on a mid-week night and it was far from busy.  Our servers were pretty good too.  But let's discuss what's really important and that's the food.  I got their the crab cake and their Bronzed Shrimp & Grits.  This was my first time trying their crab cake and it's huge, a creamy for a crab cake, and packed with flavorful crab.  As for their, Bronzed Shrimp & Grits, still as good as it get.  You get huge pieces of shrimp on top of their grits, sausage, and mushrooms.  This was seasoned just right and you can't go wrong with this dish.  In fact, this is the only entree that I have ever ordered when I dined at the original location.  I guess I should be try something different like their Po-Boys, the chicken & waffles, their jambalaya, or their oysters the next time I'm in.  But then again, it's too hard for me to pass up their Bronzed Shrimp & Grits.",

The food is decent but I'm sure any New Orleanian would say the same thing:  there's just no genuine Southern hospitality or love.  It seems to come from the owner Lola.  She offers no \"warmth\" to the guests or even her staff - just cold.  If you sit in the bar, she just broods and frowns and makes it feel like any other faceless, cold bar in any town.  Nothing is genuine New Orleans except Dominic the bartender ~ he's a gem.",

Apparently once a Ruby Tuesday, with a sunny patio offering an al fresco option to those not sold on modest Mardi Gras decor, our party of three was sat quickly at a cozy four-top and with the dining room mostly empty while the bar bustled with football our service could not have been better, a duo of young ladies eager to answer questions and seek feedback while beverages remained brimming.   Happily conversing beneath upbeat Cajun instrumentals it would not be long after ordering that the first round of food would arrive and although beignets were a bit too 'bready' while Leidenheimer French Toast proved overpriced and underwhelming compared to the restaurant's signature bread pudding both the supple cinnamon roll and spicy sausage were excellent, the later a recurring theme in round two.  Admittedly a bit disappointed in the lack of oysters on the brunch menu, but soon to find solace in items offered as \"signatures,\" it was with two plates of creamy gouda grits that the meal moved on and with the stick-a-spoon-up-straight base punched up by rich mushroom gravy and snappy Andouille both the shrimp and flaky fish equally shined, an order of chicken and waffles entirely forgettable in the face of such greatness as I mopped the bowls clean with complimentary grilled bread loaded with garlic.  At last arriving at dessert, the full menu offered in addition to two specials, it seemed only proper to select the items designated as Lola's signatures and although the soft chocolate cake was light yet intense while the hybrid pie was truly a 'best of both worlds' amalgam of sweet and savory neither could compare to the bread pudding - a steamy block of custard teaming with cinnamon beneath praline crunch and brown sugar sauce tinged with rum.  Long lamented for being a cookie-cutter planned community where PF Changs and Olive Garden continue to generate long lines, Lola's is a welcome addition to the area and the sort of place I can only hope continues to proliferate West as \"Downtown Summerlin\" develops.  Obviously new and still finding its footing, particularly with regard to a 'brunch' menu that seems muddled and poorly conceptualized in its lack of NOLA favorites like oysters or crawfish, I look forward to seeing how the restaurant evolves over time and only hope that the unwieldy location does not prove too daunting for those preferring to stick to the same ol' same ol' spots further south.",

We waited at the hostess stand for 10 minutes, no one else was waiting to be seated. Three employees made eye contact with us yet no one ever greeted us or seated us! Again the place was nearly dead, only a few tables seated and a few people in the bar area. Again three employees made eye contact with us, could miss us, we're standing right in the doorway at the hostess stand where there was a big sign that said please wait to be seated! While the food is good here, customer service sucks ass! Doubt will ever go to this location again! Waiting to be seated where restaurant is busy is one thing, but when the place is dead and you've got employees see you standing there yet they don't want to acknowledge your existence, and clearly don't want your business... This restaurant will never last! After 10 minutes we turned around and left and went to another restaurant in the area were they were happy for our business! Probably wouldn't have posted on Yelp, but I contacted the restaurant, to no avail. Clearly management there could care less about the customers, or lack of business, or more importantly their employees who do not provide excellent customer service! Way to run a business!",

Shrimp Po Boy - shrimp was cooked perfectly. Very good except brea was over toasted so ends were way too hard.   Ate at the bar. So was entertained with conversation with the bartender Lora. And she made me a Malibu Bay Breeze, which I hadn't had in years, and it was perfect.",

Anyway, ordered bread and was informed that they now charge $4.99 unless you order certain meals then it's included. I ordered the loaded jambalaya. What I received was a serving of regular jambalaya with three shrimp and some fried sausage slices added to the top. Not much effort put into that dish. And I think the portion, about 8 ounces, was rather small for the price. Let the new manager/partner know of the error of the posted hours on the website and Google and he felt the need to prove me wrong about the website. Okay. I was wrong about the website still being incorrect. Was proving me wrong in that way worth losing me, my family, and anyone I talk to, worth him proving to me that he was right? Maybe I'm overreacting, maybe he could have been more appreciative of the info I was passing along.",

I had mine without the ragu & it was still too spicy for my taste, but cooked well for sure. We also had the crab & artichoke dip which was super yum, a couple glasses of wine & dessert. It was a great ambiance (you'd never know what the place was before if you hadn't ever been there) and our waiter was hilarious and attentive. They let us linger long after dinner to finish watching the game. All in all, good food, especially if you like spicy, good ambiance & wine. A tad pricy, but nice for a special occasion.",

    "text": "How we managed to get lucky enough, to have a place like Lola's right up the street from where we live, I'll never know. I'm also smart enough to know not to question it - just to be grateful and reap the benefits whenever we can.  And we DO!  The staff is as warm and friendly as the food is out of this world.  No matter WHAT it is you're getting, may I suggest one of the most heavenly side dishes you will ever eat...the Gouda Grits with the mushroom ragout.  Chef Lola was inspired by the divine when she whipped up that one.  It's not just good enough to spread onto a shoe and eat; I jokingly told her once that if I ever hit big money at one of the casinos, I want to fill up a bathtub with it and just dive in!!!  As for the other dishes, this is authentic Cajun/Creole-style cuisine.  I can remember having this kind of food when I was in 'Nawlins' last, so prepare yourself accordingly.  If you prefer your food on the milder, even blander side, this probably is NOT the place for you.  Though as far as my experience goes, nothing here is spicy enough to send you to the ER.  But this ain't bowls of Cream of Wheat, either.   My typical meal there always starts with the Hot Crab and Artichoke dip.  Served with the freshly grilled Garlic Bread, the creamy, salty goodness of the Dip, with hearty chunks of lump crabmeat and tender artichoke pieces is hard to go wrong with. I usually pair that up with the spicy, savory Crawpuppies.  To be honest, dealing with the real 'crawdads' freaks me out more than a bit, so it's nice that they infused the sweet, briny meat into these perfect spheres that marry it with a really good hush puppy recipe, served with a tasty aioli dipping sauce.   My favorite go-to for the 'Main Event' has become the boneless chicken breasts, which you can have one of four ways.  Mine is usually Blackened (with outrageous Cajun spices) or fried, with a choice of two sides. I would strongly suggest the aforementioned, nectar-of-the-gods Gouda grits, and the Low Country Greens, seasoned to a level that ALMOST rivals your Mama's. (And if it does, you already KNOW BETTER than to admit it!) The Country Potato Salad is also guaranteed to bring tears of joy to your eyes. But one of those two paired with any of the stunning veggie or french fry offerings will give you a tasty meal to remember.  And to insure that it stays in your memory banks for a good little while, save room - even if it means taking doggie bags with you - and go for one of Chef Lola's positively sinful desserts.   I shouldn't - and won't - list the sins I might be willing to commit, for another taste of that Bananas Foster Bread pudding.  The Bananas Foster and the Bread Pudding, separately are enough to make your stomach do the happy dance.  But COMBINED? If they served it at a NATO \"peace summit\", who knows? We might actually HAVE world peace, and Lola would be up for a Nobel Prize! And don't forget to pair it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.   Running a close second to that is the Fig Delight, a sumptuous serving of sweet, baked bodaciousness that came THISclose to unseating the BFBP as the ruler of my heart. Also good with that ice cream.  To sum it up, one visit to Lola's will tell you why we, and so many other people, have become regulars.  Nobody else in the Valley or outside of it is doing food like this, and we wish for a long and happy run for this restaurant...and plan on continuing helping it along that journey!",

As an appetizer we ordered the char broiled oysters and it was a disappointment because it did not come out as described on the menu.  The description read \"Oysters on the half shell, flame flavored with a lemon garlic butter marinade, topped with Pecorino Romano cheese. Sizzling in the half shell straight to your table\" but when we got them there was an unrecognizable taste that I didn't care for.  When the waitress came to take the plate away I asked her and she said that the marinade included their house dressing and I pointed out to her that the menu did not say anything about that.  Because we had eaten them they could not take it off the bill but they did offer to buy us dessert.  I just think that any item on a restaurant's menu needs to be described with everything that is included in the preparation. Thankfully we only ordered 1/2 dozen. My husband had the catfish with red beans and rice and I had the etouffee  and both of them we very good.  We took home the bread pudding for dessert.",

We ordered soft shell crab appetizer to start it was bland no seasoning and it's one crab. Ok next we order a cup of gumbo that was more like a gravy sauce then a gumbo and not that flavorful the rue didn't cook long enough and it was thick. I ordered the Blackened Shrimp and Catfish & Gouda grits combo....that was an epic fail. The grits were good but I couldn't take more than a bite because the catfish was undercooked ... I sent it back and ordered a fried shrimp poboy ...at this point my palate for fish has been ruined so I try something fried it has to be fully cooked right ??? Well it was cooked cake with a side of home fries. The shrimp was plain not a drop of season nothing Cajun about it ..and with every bite the shrimp popped out the breading  ... needless to say I sent that back too. my girlfriend ordered Mississippi Deep Fried Catfish with a side of mixed greens and a baked Sweet potato ...alll basic as hell unseasoned. I wasn't charged for the shrimp amd grits but I wqs for the po'boy. At that point I just wanted to leave they can't help it their food just isn't it that's all. The service was also mediocre, we had to ask for silverware and napkins ...we never got the napkins. Safe to say I won't be back. I'm going to Emeril's next time I get a Creole craving or I'll drive to Arizona for Pappadeux's",

    "text": "Husband has been wanting to come here in forever. Actually, it's the Charleston location that he wanted to visit. However, with two babies in tow and knowing space is limited...Summerlin location is the best fit for those who have stroller aged children.  It was rather slow when we arrived. I clenched my butt as it was Father's Day and I was expecting chaos and a wait. But just as I told my husband on the way...nobody gives a shiz balls about Father's Day. Lol. We had reservations and so we were immediately seated. Probably because it was slow. The hostess was very welcoming and pleasant.   I can only offer a 3 star rating because for one, I'm allergic to shellfish. Gumbo, and all that you come for gets thrown out the window. So, I opted for the blackened salmon with green beans and rice. It was literally a 2 star dish to me because my blackened fish, personally, was overcooked. Nothing exciting about it all. I mean, twas salmon. Tis all.   I didn't expect my green beans to be like mush. It was like collard greens, bit made out of green beans. Perhaps I'm not as thoroughly familiar with southern food as I thought...but I really disliked the mushy green beans. Though, I ate the thing anyway because Iz wuz hungray.   The husband ordered a small cup of their gumbo and had their jambalaya. He's such a whore to such dishes.  I was hoping he'd ooh and aah and spice up my yelp review, but as much gumbo and jambalayas he's had...no oohs and aahs. He said they weren't bad. Just alright. Okay, if his fatass says just alright, then it's just alright. On a sidenote, he also had his eyes glued to the start of the game 7 nba finals so maybe he wasn't fully being one with his dish. BUT! BUT! If it was something that locked his jaw out of goodness, no NBA game could.prevent that. So I'll have to have faith in his just alright.  I thought they'd bring out bread or something as you wait...I even thought they'd give bread with their gumbo or something, everything we ordered was literal. No garnishments to make it look fancy. No side pieces for flavor enhancement. You order the fish, you get the fish. While delicious food should not need fancy garnishments or bread to.scrape.your soups with...the fish would've tasted alot better had it had a lemon near it or something. I literally thought, I could've did this shhh...myself.   We also ordered their fries which came out last! Seriously. There was a whiny baby with us who clearly NEEDED his fries because his life and mother's sanity depended on it. Hahaha. Their fries were pretty interesting though as there were different sizes of fries. There were thin and thick cuts and I feel like not having the monotony of same size cuts of potatoes is what made the fries. Weren't bad at all.  Our server wasn't bad. He just gave off this I'm a new guy vibe so he seemed timid? Hesistant? Not sure. We asked for a high chair but my husband ended up grabbing one ourselves because our waiter clearly forgot. I think he was the bartender as well? Either way he served his purpose. Good enough.   Overall, we spent 50 bucks on 2 alcohol beverages, fries, cup of gumbo, jambalaya, and salmon. It wasnt a complete satisfying-rub-my-belly-wholly-crap that was awesome 50 bucks, but we went out...we ate...it wasnt busy...staff was nice...they had the game on...we had a nice time anyway, so mission accomplished.   Would be come back? Perhaps. Wouldn't go out of our way and probably wouldn't be on our list of \"we should go to........\"  I will note that the front of their restaurant is their garden so it's nice to see fresh tomatoes growing knowing they're self-sustaining to a certain degree.  Definitely kid friendly. Highchairs with working buckles, yay! Certainly stroller friendly if it isn't busy in there. If you need a southern fix that's not <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsome.hole.in&s=f500b5d9e85a6c93cda5d83b5dff24459fae791c21ed9ec77c26198058552016\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">some.hole.in</a> the wall...I'd recommend them.",

They grow their basil fresh, they're trying their best to grow tomatoes in Las Vegas, and you can tell they value freshness. The patio is lovely, the staff is kind, Lola herself is often telling fun stories at the bar. One time I went and someone with us had just been through some insanely difficult life events, but we were all sitting under a giant umbrella, trying each other's meals, singing along to 40s hits, having a blast. It's a nice little escape with real good food.",

I took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner since he's been craving some Creole/Cajun food and man, we were pretty disappointed of our meal.  We came in around 5pm which was during their happy hour and though we wanted to order from their menu (drinks are half off) they didn't allow us to order if we ate at the dining area which was a bummer so we didn't end up getting anything off their HH menu. I don't understand why it was an issue to order at the bar and just drink the drinks at our table but we just went with it.   We went for the gumbo, crab cake, and the etouffee with half crawfish and half shrimp.   Gumbo: 2/5 - felt like I was just eating soup from a can and I barely tasted any shrimp at all.  Crab cake: 4/5 - probably the best thing we ate out of all of the food but the portion was very small, not shareable at all.  Etouffee: 3/5 - very bland. We had to add salt but it barely helped. The shrimp was good but definitely wasn't satisfying at all.  Service was good and we got complementary bread before our meal. Not sure if I'll try this restaurant again but it definitely didn't hit the spot we were hoping to fill.",

So, we had a crab cake as a starter and I almost died of delight eating it.  For our main dish, I had fried catfish with veggies and sweet potato fries. It was fantastic. My hubby had Blackened Chicken Alfredo. He's an  Alfredo Connoisseur said it was the best he's ever had and that next time he probably won't even order it with chicken, WHAT? That good? Yeah, I tried it and died. He was right. THAT GOOD.  I am going to go back a lot. The bar area looks like a lot of fun, and the drinks were some sort of delicious mixology wizardry. I think we'll eat in there next time. ....  So, I'm giving this a whole lot of stars, because this is the best Alfredo Sauce in town, the best crab cakes on earth, and the atmosphere was just cool.",

Not once have we been disappointed by the food or service, and every time we leave it's with smiles on our faces.  When we decided to get married and skip the whole \"big wedding\" thing. We wanted something small, just us, our parents, my kids, in a place that meant something to us. And that was Lola's. Their patio is beautiful, we all fit at the big table, we all ate whatever we wanted. Everyone raves about how good the food was, and how wonderful it was for us to be able to share that moment with friends and family.  Obviously I recommend it for date nights, family dinners, st. Patrick's day celebrations, birthdays, anything. Go there. Eat anything and everything. Drink drinks, watch a game, enjoy live music. We will visit Lola's as long as she'll have us.

Not sure the full restaurant and busy hours are good enough reason for delayed responses and food prep. The foods are cold between the presentations. All the dishes were too salty. Not enough flavor and fire for the foods. Definitely not as authentic as we remembered (since we live in the area for the last 10 years). Reconsider before you go!",

    "text": "I had the sample platter I think with catfish and shrimp and crab cake.   Ok so the crab cake - I felt like saying \"Can I have some crab with this stuffing \"   This is crab cake made with a stuffing and it just is not tasty to me at all. It was mushy and the flavor was not great. I felt like I was eating a stuffing patty with crab mixed into it. Overly stuffing.   The fry on the catfish and the fried shrimp was On point perfection.    Now I am a salt sensitive human I detest overly salted anything.   That being said the catfish and seasonal vegetables had Zero salt or flavor. Like add some salt.   My brother had the Shrimp Creole it was tasty.   Coming from a family of fine diners and my brother being an executive chef formerly of Rosemary's who had the best food in town I can't say this is the best I've had because it is not.   I've given it a higher review then my pallet would normally suggest because instead of now basing my review off of just the food or just the server I'm going off of my whole experience.   Here are some negative remarks   1. Why are you in the edge of summerlin with a restaurant setting yet not 1 manager came to our table to greet us or to see how things were going. If you want to charge people the finer dining prices or the lower end of that, then you should probably practice the art of fine dining in your restaurant.   It's dark there , there's no real flow to a theme just Knick knacks everywhere which the eclectic is fine however not 1 personality or any brightness of cheer in human form exists in this facility.   It would be so cool to see people happy to see other people and not just working and doing their jobs. Tell some of those men to tuck in their shirts as well.   2. When people order salads etc and a server suggests something they should probably describe in detail what it is they are suggesting. I like the house vinaigrette did not let me know this vinaigrette is overly sweet and packed with about every herb you can imagine giving it no real direction as far as flavor is concerned.   3. I even saw the owner there and she did not make eye contact she did not say hello or anything. Very rude and very uninviting. I own a few businesses and never would I not say hi or anything to anyone contributing to my success. Ever just horribly rude.   Positive Notes :   1. The server was very polite and she was attentive.   2. The food didn't take forever to make.   3. Even though the catfish lacked salt the fry on it was impeccable and the quality of the fish and shrimp was magnifique.   4. The Veranda looks quite lovely    Honestly I can't say much more. There are too many things I found mediocre.   I'm sure if the manager had greeted the table considering there were only 5-7 tables filled that afternoon that would have raised it another star for me.   If you want to be in the restaurant biz have hospitality in every aspect with every employee. I couldn't even tell which was the manager apart from everyone else.",

    "text": "Food is great, music on the weekends is a bonus. Usually great customer service. My only complaint is the menu lists one platter at $11.99 including two sides but if you choose a regular side and a premium side, you are charged full price for the premium side. So you may as well choose two regular sides and order the premium side a la carte.  ** update: 05/27/18 you can no longer order red beans and rice as a side...   **update number 2, the bread below looks like they cleaned the grill with it... burnt.. gray/green... I would've been embarrassed to set this in front of my customers. Also have been waiting 15 minutes for a drink ordered at the bar & it's no where in sight.. **once the food finally arrived (around 8:30 even though the restaurant was supposed to close at 8, we found out two chefs had just quit) I stopped eating my chicken half way through because my stomach hurt. My date finished his bronzed catfish and grits and even ordered the bread pudding. He enjoyed it. Later that night/5am he felt very sick. Neither of us ever actually got sick-sick but experienced extreme discomfort. I feel bad writing the review bc the staff were very nice and this used to be one of our favorite places but I honestly don't see myself going back here anymore.",

They had live entertainment which was also very nice. The fried puppies appetizer came hot and fresh and I thought  they were a great concept. They made a good Moscow Mule and had some interesting beers on tap, including a beer only made in the Louisiana.  Negatives: I got the chicken and sausage jambalaya. I was enjoying it very much, until I bit into a piece of chicken. The chicken had that awful flavor that it gets when it sits in the refrigerator too long. The chicken definitely was not freshly made. This was very off putting. Also the garlic bread barely had a char on it. It tasted like buttered bread.",

The restaurant is located in Summerlin, a nice town just outside of Vegas.  The ambulance was laid back and the music was fantastic for a sleepy Tuesday night.  Lola, the owner, was present and greeting each guest as she made everyone feel welcome.  The bartender seemed to call ever patron by name and even had their drink orders memorized...  I had the catfish and grits and the pecan pie for desert.  They were both excellent choices.  Full of flavor and pleasing to the eye.  I will most certainly be back whenever I'm in Vegas",

I had ordered close to $100 worth of food to go and the food was under seasoned. They say the're a Louisiana Kitchen but when I had called to complain I had spoke with Lola and told me to came back down. I told her there was no flavor or seasoning and Lola stated and I quote\" If your looking Popeye's experience don't come here you won't find that here\"  I told her that you at least need to put salt and pepper because there was none she came out rude and belligerent and smelled of alcohol. My partner as well as myself have Louisiana and creole blood and have been to Louisiana and know how the food should taste. I know she only said it cause were black/African American. But they make the food bland for all the old people who come here. No young people were found. Good spot to go if you have no taste buds and like talking with business owners who drink (drink and drive)on the job I can't believe people love this place. The atmosphere is a mess no real theme Mitch match decor. I can't believe it was on Diner, Drive ins and Dives. Never trusting the food network again. Stay away from the crab cakes they are inedible and on the menu it says lumps...there are no lumps but you can sue because u will have crab shell to pick from your teeth. Better off getting crab cakes in the frozen section at the market",

He refused to seat us and escorted us to the door.  Lola's is across the street from where we live and it is unfortunate that because of poor management they have lost another loyal customer.",

It was very elegant and peaceful, very beautifully designed and you almost felt like you were in Louisiana on a nice warm day. I ordered the crawpuppies, Shrimp & Grits and the red beans and rice. My favorite out of them was definitely the Shrimo & Grits, seasoned very well and very filling! Their sweet ice tea was amazing as well, not too sweet and you can still taste the tea. Overall this place was awesome, service was good and food came out fast!! I will be going back to try the other items on their menu",

    "text": "When you visit a restaurant you're paying for time convenience and great service otherwise you'd cook at home and deal with yourself. Usually my experience at Lolas is ok nothing spectacular but today the energy was off. I asked for a table for 3 and the host asked if we'd like to sit at the bar, it wasn't busy so we did not understand why she asked that. That was odd. I told her no and we sat down in the dining area. We sat down a few minutes before 2 and by the time the waitress came it was 2 on the dot and unlimited mimosas were over. We didn't complain and ordered the mimosas a la carte. There was a mistake with the mimosa order and I joked with the girl who brought them out that she can give me two pineapple mimosas for the price of one after she insisted the order was correct,  and she returned a rude face and smart remark. The energy was so OFF in this place especially for it to be a non busy Sunday. Lolas usually delivers ok to good service but there are far too many restaurants in Vegas for me to spend money at a place that has many employees not delivering great customer service at once.  The food was good as usual. I ordered the shrimp and grits.always a good choice.  Kelly I believe her name was Kelly was the most friendly. I would prefer her (the waitress) to bring my drinks rather then someone who is rude and looks unhappy especially when the customer isn't complaining about the mistake that was made.",

    "text": "I'm not sure why it took us so long to mosey our way down here since this location is closer to our home.  So we decided to make our trip down on Saturday night.  If you haven't been to either Lola's, you're missing out. I feel as though this place is a staple for Las Vegas. There aren't many Lousiana style food restaurants here. But this one takes the cake.   This location, I prefer. Mostly because they have more options for alcohol, bigger, nicer and they have a live pianist that plays on Wednesday's and Friday's. You best believe I'll be going there for that. We were warned that Friday is usually packed though.   The bartender, Dominic Trupiano was awesome. You can tell he loves what he does, and he's very good at it. He was super friendly and quick to serve. He also was extremely knowladgable in his liquor, so it was nice to have someone be able to pick something we'd really like. He had be try Haig scotch -- because I like more of the floral notes. It was excellent. And it's David Beckham's scotch. Nice work, Beckham.   For dinner we had:  -Shared Cesar Salad. Always excellent.  -Their amazing crab cake appetizer. This is one of my, if not favorite thing here. It's always crispy on the outside, and packed full of crab. This is hard to find with crabcakes. They're usually filled with other things, such as corn meal or breading so they don't have to use as much crab. Lola says, \"No\"...apparently.  -Shrimp Creole. Man oh man, was this good. I hadn't tried this yet. It was so spicy (which I loved because I've been sick) and full of peppered flavor I loved it. The only thing I don't love is the pre-cooked rice. I don't know if this is a Lousiana thing. I'm assuming it is because I've been to Lousiana a few times and a ton of places there used pre-cooked rice. Being Asian, it's one thing I will always stand against. But, the dish was still excellent.  -Bronzed Shrimp & Grits. If you didn't know, these grits are with gouda cheese. Which happens to be MY FAVORITE cheese in the world. These are the best damn grits I've had in my life. This is one of their best dishes, and it's very easy to taste/smell why.   This place is just great. We'll frequent here more often for sure. So if you haven't been and you like Louisana style food, this is your place, my friend.",

It's a great place out of the way, service was excellent (Ruth, you're wonderful) and the food.....I think between all of us we tried almost every dish on the menu except oysters.   My boss grew up in Mississippi and one of the clients was from Louisiana, they both thought it was on spot and loved it. My favorites were the BBQ shrimp, the grits (I could eat by the bucket), and you have to save room for the banana bread pudding with bananas foster on top. I had mine with a coffee stout of some sort (sorry, bad with beer names) that worked perfect with the food.   The best part was we had a friend from Switzerland with us and it was his first time having any of these dishes, he doesn't eat seafood (I know, right?!) but he was enamored with the grits.   This is on my must visit list any time I got to Vegas now.",

When I arrived to pick it up, they weren't aware of my order. Apparently, I called the other location. I asked the hostess if she can call to cancel it for me, since this Town Center, Summerlin location is nearest and it's almost closing and she obliged.   After waiting a few minutes, food was well packaged and I excitedly took it home.  Crawfish was so salty, it made me shiver! I couldn't get it down. I tried to avoid the seasonings on the outside, but the salt was well within the meat! It was so disappointing, especially since I ordered two pounds.  The Jambalaya was pretty mediocre, especially for the price. But I did agree to extra sausage.  Never again.",

I don't like catfish because it always tastes \"dirty\" to me.  This did not.  It was fresh, cooked to perfection and was wonderful.  I didn't know what I was missing.  And the cheesy grits!  I don't like grits either, but these are fantastic!    If you want to try a little down south food and hospitality - head to Lola's.  Oh - and by the way - if you are a New Orleans Saints fan, you will have a great time!",

    "text": "Confusion and mediocre food. The only saving grace was our server - Kindra. Our visit was on Feb 26, 2015. We have been to the East Charleston several times and loved it. We were looking forward to visiting this location for some time. When our city councilman scheduled a meeting there it was the perfect opportunity to go. Arrived an hour before the meeting around 5 for an early dinner.  I told the hostess we were there for the meeting and dinner....confusion.  She  then escorted us to a nice long (high) table in the bar area and said 'They are going to meet here'. No menu's. A server stopped by and asked why we were sitting there so I pointed in the direction of the hostess.....still no menus. The bartender asked us what we would like to drink and recommended the Hurricane. Asked for a menu and did not get one...he also asked why were sitting there. Mind you the place is empty at this point. Now there is a major discussion amongst the troops. Finally our server brought our drinks and whaa -la...menu's. BTW the drinks were horrible @ $10 each. Not even close to Pat O'Briens.  I asked if we should move. \"No, No you guys are ok there.\"  Next to visit our table was the bar manager asking the same question. Ugh. We about had it with all this confusion. We ordered; Craw puppies..they were rather bland but saved by the dipping sauce ($5.29), a crab cake appetizer which tasted like tuna...no chunks of crab ($6.99), and finally to complete the misery Jambalaya which was so dried out and gummy. I think it was leftover and warmed in a microwave ($10.29, plus $4.29 for three shrimp) The dish did have nice seasoning and chunks of sausage (not cajun) but rather dried out.  Now the place is filling up and four additional folks were seated at our table. Which was fun at first...until the (older) gentleman started complaining out loud that he got there an hour early to sit at 'this' table. The two ladies that he was with were rather embarrassed. Guess who stopped by next? Lola. She stood by our table and asked if we were going to be done soon as there was a large party scheduled. I mentioned what had happened earlier and that we were questioned about our location. I also stated that most restaurants have a staff pre-shift meeting to go over specials, parties, meetings....etc so at least her hostess would know what was going on. We then ajourned to the meeting room and had a nice time with our city councilman.   Our server was fantastic and the only saving grace for the evening. She knew the menu and visited our table several times. I did mention the 'food' and she offered to adjust the bill but we declined and just recommended that she speak to the cook.   The final masterstroke of confusion was this; By the front door was a chalkboard announcing that there was going to be a dinner with a wine pairing featuring Lohr wines for somewhere around $30/person. Nice. I asked Lola on the way out what was on the menu for the affair. She did not know.....\"call back\".   The place is big with a nice bar. There is a grill where the servers prepare the garlic toast. The meeting room is large with easy access to the bar and dining area.  Overall it's a typical Summerlin/Sun City/Denny's kind of place with marginal food but great service.  Sorry...but this location does not hold a candle to the east Charleston eatery. BTW...the 'large party' was Purdue alums there to watch a b-ball game.  Sorry for the confusion.....",
