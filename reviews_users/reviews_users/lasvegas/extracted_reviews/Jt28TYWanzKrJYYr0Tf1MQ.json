    "text": "The 2-for-1 margarita special was a total rip off; they just doubled their prices for the 10oz plastic cups of margaritas.  But that wasn't the worst of it.  I happened to notice that they charged me $1.00 more on each of our entrees than the price listed on the menus.  When I talked to the manager about it, he said it wasn't a mistake.  He said that the prices changed, but they didn't have the new menus printed yet.  Apparently he saw absolutely no problem with charging all of his patrons more than what they thought they'd pay.  When I mentioned to him that this is clearly unethical, he just said that he'll make it up to me by giving me $25 off my next meal.  In other words, \"shut up about it, and I'll make it worth your while.\"  I told him I didn't want his coupon, and that he should just do the right thing and either lower his prices to reflect what's on the menu, or tell his patrons about the increase when they order.  I don't think he listened to me.  Just think of the thousands of people who paid more than the menu price.  Can I hear \"Class Action Lawsuit\"?",

Cabo Wabo did not, and that should have sent a red flag immediately.  There was a pretty terrible karaoke band playing, and they were far too loud for a small place.  The waitress took awhile to take our order, and when asked what was good or recommended we were met with a blank stare.  She did not want to be there.  We ordered a couple margaritas and they were OK, but far too expensive.  When our food finally came, it was a little cold and just so-so.  I had the nacho plate thing (forgot what it was called) with the 12 chips, and it barely had any fajita meat on it.  Once we finished eating I waited a good 30 minutes to get my check, all while my ear drums were bleeding from the awful music.  My wife ended up going back to the hotel because the check took forever.  Overall, it was pretty bad food, bad environment, overpriced, and OK drinks.  You can do a lot better on the strip.  Heck, you can do better at a truck stop in the middle of Iowa.",

The food was TERRIBLE!!!!  Wehad a $60 Groupon, so we ordered food and drinks to get to $60.  When it was time for the bill, the waitress advised that the Groupon would not be honored because it \"expired\" that day.  We asked to speak with the manager who stuck wit hthe story that the Groupon expired at 12:01 minight and that we would only get $30 knocked off of our $75 bill.  He aslo tried to tell us the Groupon was for parties of 4 or more, which was not True as the Groupon nevestated this anywhere.  We argued with the manager, who eventaully agreed to take a bit mor off of our bill due to the horrendous service.  I will NEVER eat at this establishment again, the food was terrbile and the service was even worse!  Do not waste your time or money here...eveif yo do have a Groupon!!!!",

My girlfriends and I did a day trip to Vegas from L.A. on our way back we wanted to grab a bite to eat this has got to be the worst and most expensive Mexican meal I've ever ate. Our waitress came over after sitting for 10 min she brought us a basket of stale chips and what appeared to be salsa. She then took our food order I never thought someone could mess up nachos well Cabo Wabo proved me WRONG!!!!! The cheese was old and it seemed like they had the nachos sitting under a heat lamp before actually serving them. Then the bill came we were amazed that we had spent 60.00 on 3 meals WOW really? My girlfriend payed half the bill with cash and i paid the other half on my credit card when I got home a few days later it appeared that our waitress took the cash as a \"TIP\" and billed my credit card for the entire bill. I have tried to contact the management several times and have gotten no response. If you are visiting the Las Vegas area I would tell you to walk right past CABO WABO. The food sucks the waitresses will rip you off and a few days later your bank account will feel the pain:( HORRIBLE PLACE TO DINE........ I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS PLACE IS STILL IN BUSINESS???????",

This place felt like a home base restaurant while we were in Vegas.  Food was great for the price and the atmosphere can't be beat, right in the middle of the action. The wait staff is ok. They are inconsistent And one waitress was great and another was slow etc. It did take a long time for the food to come but ...hey, we were on vacation and had nothing better to do but sip our drinks.

Fortunately/unfortunately, that \"something new\" ended up being Cabo Wabo...which always seemed like more of a drinking spot than as a place to eat at.  Now I know why!  Although Cabo Wabo isn't a mainstream type of chain restaurant, it's still pretty much a chain, and the food really reflected that.  I kept expectations to a minimum for my CARNITAS TACOS, and what I got was pretty mediocre...and overpriced.  Two tacos, Spanish rice, and beans for $15?  I know it's The Strip and all, but damn (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cabo-wabo-cantina-las-vegas?select=vguZqf4mTUutzMe9wgw8Sw#J9PUAWgzOp0UnrzmnXG4bg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cabo...</a>).  The taste of the carnitas was driven heavily by their generic sauce rather than the savory, seasoned flavors you'd get from something authentic, but at least the tacos were fairly full...so yay?  As far as our drinks went, my friends seemed mostly satisfied with what they had.  I ordered the CHUPA CHUPA cocktail, which was kind of fun to drink but not particularly amazing.  Essentially, they flip a mini Corona into a regular margarita at your table, and you have to quickly drink it before it all overflows (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cabo-wabo-cantina-las-vegas?select=vguZqf4mTUutzMe9wgw8Sw#RV-cRSWcsgg5ITs4n6OcAQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cabo...</a>).  Creative and unique, but pricey considering it wasn't that heavy on the alcohol.   Amazingly though, what hurt more than overpaying for generic and medicore food was my lack of reception stopping me from checking in on Yelp when we first sat down.  As petty and trivial as that sounds, I would have seen the \"Free margarita with the purchase of an entree\" deal before I ordered, and I could have saved myself $12 on that Chupa Chupa!  Ugh...",

They play current pop music but then could have a band one night and then a solo artist the next. The patio area is open and has a pretty good view of the Bellagio and Cosmopolitan.    I was there with a small group of 5 and we only had to wait about 15 minutes on a Saturday night. Not bad. There is no complimentary chips and salsa but we ordered some anyway along with guacamole. The chips were above average and I would buy a bag if they sold them. The salsa wasn't bad either. Once everyone at the table realized the guacamole I ordered was $9, they stopped and let me eat it. I also ordered a bloody mary. One thing I have found recently is that mexican joints have some of the best bloody marys. This proved to be True once again.  I had the chicken sabana which was like nothing I've ever experienced at a mexican restaurant. My wife had the carnitas tacos which she could not finish. Not because they give you a lot but there was a strange taste that did not agree with her. I tried a piece and was glad I ordered what I did.   With that said, if I'm in the area and looking for a cool atmosphere with decently priced food, I would try them again.",

Service was just ok the first time but the second time I was with a large group and service was excellent. Bathrooms are kinda weird, when you walk in you'll know what I mean.

I had steak fajitas. Fabulous. Steak was covered with a cilantro type chimchurri looking thing and a huge portion of peppers and onions. The beans and rice were Baja style. The guacamole was a standout. Fresh flour tortillas.  The wife had the Spicy tequila shrimp. This was amazing. It's only letdown was the dirty rice, which was bonded with cheese. Too cheesy. Also, not spicy. But god, the flavor. Over the top.  Overall, meal was excellent. Lose a star over the margaritas.",

Went for my Aunts wedding rehearsal dinner and for a party of 50..service was great, brought the food out pretty quick, great portions ..my only word of advice and warning would be don't trust the gorgeous light skinned waitress with no clothes on. I asked her for help on a place for our whole family to go and she recommended a strip club, acted as though she was helping us by getting is a limo and free entry...and it turned out to be a total scam. We ended up all the way at the club and having to turn right back out take a taxi back to the hotel will definitely dine here again but I hope I don't run into her because I'm still bee upset.",

The meat not shredded with a big lump in the middle SMOTHERED with some sort of mexican looking cheese, YUCK. Wife had fish and chips.  Oil was running down her wrist from the soggy fish.  I had a bite and it was raw and unsalted.  The TarTar sauce finally arrived as we were leaving.  Wife had a mixed alcohol vodka drink which was watered down so much there was no taste of vodka, for $15.  You walk in and the noise was so loud it gave me a headache.  I and our friends, will NEVER, NEVER, NEVER eat at this place again.  Save your money and go to McDonalds.  Much cheaper and taste better.  I paid  over $76  for a great disappointment.  cabo wabo please get your act together.",

I was skeptical at first because I figured these guys focus their efforts hocking 3' tall slushy drinks on the miracle mile. I was wrong. We sat at the bar and ordered a round of mojitos. Before I knew it we were 2 mojitos down and the bartenders started pouring shots of fireball on the house while grilling us on our favorite nfl teams. It was basically nfl trivia; get a question right, get a shot, get a question wrong, get shot with a water pistol (I got shot a lot). We laughed with these guys for a solid hour while drinking some of the best mojitos I've ever had and laughing about sports. If you get the chance to sit down at Cabo Wabo I highly recommend sitting at the bar because these guys know how to have a good time.",

I was still feeling a little rough from our outing the previous night, so I didn't try any cocktails, but the server was quick to bring over some water (and kept it coming).  I had the Eggs Benedict, which was very good.  You got a nice side helping of some potatoes, so it was a very good amount of food.  I would have liked the eggs to been a little less done, I prefer them a little more runny, but I also could have specified this to the server. Overall, great experience. I would definitely go back and give it another try for lunch/dinner.",

We started at our hotel (MGM) and when we got to Planet Hollywood, she just wanted to find some place to relax with a drink and people watch.  We saw cabo wabo, though margaritas would be good, and stopped.  This is a good place for what it is - chain restaurant type of Mexican food.  But the location is superb.  We sat on the patio at the railing and had a great view of Bellagio, Caesar's up the block, and the people walking along the strip.  So it's a great place for just that - relaxing on the strip in the sun to people watch.  They also have skinny margaritas, and good ones too.  We're both a bit health conscious (though you couldn't tell by the giant nachos we ordered), and try to avoid drowning drinks in sour mix.  It wasn't too pricey for Vegas - $10/margarita, $15 for the nachos - so we got yards of skinny ritas and nachos and had a really nice afternoon.    I wouldn't come here for a nice dinner or anything, but if you want a patio on the strip, this is a good place to come.",

Then just add that amount to each menu item. Just seems shady if you ask me.

The sampler was the perfect amount of food and it was good (as good as bar food gets).  Our server was happy, attentive, and did a wonderful job.   The prices are a bit on the high side but considering the view and the environment it was worth the price of admission. I forgot to mention that they had a live band playing.

The first thing I waiter did was pull an old waiter tip trick -- putting coaster under a \"wiggly\" table. The table wasn't even slightly off kilter. Whatever. I asked for water and Dr. Pepper to drink. He brought waters for everyone and 2 sodas and 2 beers. While we were looking over the menu we had questions. My mom and I don't eat beef or seafood, and their menu is very heavy with both of those things. We asked the waiter if we could switch the meat in the beef tacos to chicken. The answer was no. We asked if we could have chicken tacos in hard shells instead of soft corn. The answer was no. We finally settled on chicken taquitos which is technically an appetizer, but the only thing on the menu we MIGHT eat. It didn't come with anything so we both added beans and rice. My brother got some kind of beef taco in a soft corn tortilla and his friend got some kind of beef burrito. When they brought out the food, I had 4 taquitos on my plate, and my mom only had 3, so she asked, and they brought her another one. I ate exactly ONE taquito. The chicken inside was tough and bland. The rice was tasteless as were the beans.   The waiter brought our check and it was $100 for four dinners, two of which weren't even eaten. We ended up boxing it up and giving it to a homeless man on the strip.   Don't expect chips and salsa either. That's an extra $3.95, where I come from chips and salsa is always complimentary.   Honestly, we had a hole in wall down the street that was SOOOO much better.   Our waiter was rude, never once smiled, and seemed legitimately agitated.   My brother and his friend liked it, so if you eat beef or shrimp, you might too, but if you are chicken eater like me and mom I wouldn't recommend this place.",

Well, as far as I know, he didn't. That said, the food here is very good.  I can vouch for their breakfast menu well, I had both the CW Eggs Benedict and the CW Huevos Rancheros.  Both were excellent, and the CW Home fries were great.  The breakfast adult beverages, the CW Bloody Mary was excellent, up there with some of the best I have ever had.  The Bellini, Blood Orange Mimosa, and regular Mimosa are also good and contain a healthy amount of alcohol. I also sampled the lunch menu on one of the visits, and had the fish taco's, which were also excellent.  The beans and rice that came with it are also very tasty. The only complaint is everything is a little pricey, but then again so are most things on the strip.  The food was great, the atmosphere was fun (even without Sammy showing up) and I can check Cabo Wabo off the bucket list after four visits.",

We waited quite a while between seeing out server.  Our server was very nice, however, and accommodating.  As for the fare; my lady had a margarita on the rocks and said it was quite good.  I had a beer, so not much to say about that.  She had the tortilla soup and loved it, especially given how cold it was outside.  Her daughter had the carne asada tacos and gave them a glowing review.  I had a cheeseburger with fries and found it to be quite good.  I found the prices to be a bit on the high side for what you get.  It looks like they may have live music in the evenings, there was a stage with a drum kit set up.    I'd give a few more stars if the service had been a bit quicker and the prices a bit lower.",

Because I was desperate for a snack I ordered the cheapest appetizer on the menu- chips and salsa for $8!   EIGHT DOLLARS! For nachos you would get free anywhere else. And they were so greasy I couldn't eat them. You have to understand I love junky food, but this was SO bad. Just disgusting.   This place gets one star because I HAVE to give it something to rate it.  In all fairness, the server was nice and the location is good (across from the Bellagio fountain) but save your money and buy a 6-pack, some tostitos and sit out on the sidewalk if you want a good view of the show.   Is this what you wanted, Sammy Hagar?",

However, the people I was with were starving and when this place came into our line of sight, we pretty much decided this was it for the evening's meal.  Since we are east coasters, we were there earlier than most for dinner.  We got seated right away and the place was not busy at all.  Our server was fast and brought our drinks, chips and salsa right away.    Everyone at our table ordered different things, from fajitas to tacos to burritos.  Everyone enjoyed their food and the price was not bad considering how high it could have been for its location on the strip.    The waitresses all dancing every half hour (or whatever it is) is actually entertaining because some of them are really into it and others are definitely not.  It entertained our group at least.    Decent food, decent prices, excellent location.",

    "text": "Yelp!! Where do i start? Yesterday 7/29 we were walking the strip and came upon Cabo Wabo. Now my Husband is more of a David Lee Roth kind of guy but we decided to check the place out.  We sat outside but there were no misters where we sat down at so we decided to move in because we were already too hot. Soo we asked the host if its ok we move inside. She walked us in and put us at our new table... WELL this is where it all started our server was SO bad. He had no personality it was like talking to the wall... We sat there for over 8 minutes before he even came to the table. There was only 3 other tables inside at the time so it's not like they were busy.  This guy didn't even ask us if we wanted refills and let me tell you we can drink some tequila.   We ordered our food which i asked for no pico because it's nasty and i hate it and well of course it had it on there. But i am not the one to complain so i pushed it off to the side and ate what i could. The one drink we had was good and the food was good but the service was not good at all. Right as we r done eating the busser came and cleaned out plates which he was so sweet he should have been our server.  Before we are about to leave we are looking around at the table, this place as so much Sammy stuff to look at. A lady came over to the table and asked us how we were doing and if we enjoyed everything now i didn't tell her that our service SUCKED but i did tell her that our food had Pico and etc. She was so nice and tried to get us something else to eat because i barley ate my food. We asked about the upstairs and she took us up there to look around which i might say the view is amazing. She showed us around the rest of the cantina and told us a lot about Sammy that we didn't know. She brought us to the retail store which we had no idea there was on and was not sure if we were going to get anything again my hubby likes David. She gave us her card and said next time we come in to say hi. She made us feel like we were VIP. But every one there was SO nice but this guy with the red hat SUCKS. I can't remember his name i think it was Jason but who know i guess it's not important. Ask for Kristen when you stop by she will make u feel at home there.. So for her, the busser and the ONE good drink we had i will give his place 4 stars",

We ordered the ceviche and their garlic lime shrimp. Both were great. We did have to order some chips and salsa because the ceviche only came with 4 chips decorating the plates.

The restaurant itself did not appear to be kept clean.  Tables appeared dirty with food crumbs still stuck.  The tables and chairs were scattered around.  We were seated and then the waiter came out to take our drink orders.  This waiter appeared to have a big cold sore on his lip that was oozing.  Just ew!  We ordered our drinks, and shortly after, we ordered our food.  The food came out in a decent amount of time.  But while waiting for the food, we just took a few moments to really observe the atmosphere of this place.  Everyone in here was middle aged and seemed as if they were trapped in the 80's time warp.  So, you can imagine the washed up men and women that come here.    The food was ok.  Nothing special.  But it did seem pretty pricey for the quality of the food.",

The establishment was clean and inviting and they were not busy on a Sunday afternoon. I was excited about the Pina Colada and it did not disappoint. I will definitely return for that alone! I gave 2 stars because the lack of making it right. We visited on Sunday 6/23 & ordered a queso fundido with the chorizo appetizer and our food . The female waitress asked if we wanted it as an appetizer or to come out with the food. We said everything can come at whatever is the fastest (we were hungry). Well the food came out, we were about 50% done with our food and my spouse made her aware of the appetizer not coming out. 90% done with our food,  and it comes out.... we actually wanted to cancel it and made her aware when she checked on us and nothing came about it. Since she didn't return after a few minutes it sat on our table,  so we ended up eating it,  and we paid for it and it was like it wasn't a big deal that it came out much later. That was our problem with our visit! She was dry in personality,  she lacked being apologetic,  she lacked concern of her and the kitchen's error.",

What more could you possibly want?! Oh and the view of the strip from the upstairs bar is amazing. Bet it's a great place to watch the New Years fireworks.

    "text": "The outdoor patio is a popular place for people watching and to be seen as it's on the corner of Planet Hollywood.  We opted to enter from inside and asked to be seated indoors which only had about 7 tables occupied.  Our server came promptly to get our drink orders.  I had checked in on Yelp which offered a free margarita ($10) value but I also had a coupon for 20% off (it's in the Miracle Mile coupon book).  I opted to get the free drink but after, I should have used the coupon, as the drink was too strong for me and I drank less than half.  My husband happily finished it for me though.  I focused on the tacos and fajitas on the menu.  The fajitas come for 1 or 2.  We shared the grilled sirloin fajitas and for $3 more we got beans and rice.  The food came out quick and the platter had lots of cut up beef and grilled peppers on it.  We each received 3 warm small tortillas wrapped in paper.  We devoured them pretty quick and asked for more.  Service was more attentive at the beginning of our meal and then died off.  It still wasn't very busy inside so it wasn't that the server was so busy.  The food was good, but I'm not sure if it was worth $42 for 2.  The drinks are about $14 each so it can add up.  There was a little stage set up when you first walk in but I don't know when bands play.  It seems more popular to sit outside, listen to music, and enjoy the Strip views.",

    "text": "This was my first time in Vegas and my first time at Cabo Wabo Cantina. I love this restaurant. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. I went there with a friend after a long day business seminar. We were both starving. At first they seated us inside but we requested to be seated outside. They sat us under a high table and chairs under an umbrella with a heat lamp since it was somewhat chilly. We were able to see all of the passers by and the light show. So nice to see. I ordered the chicken tortilla soup as my appetizer and we had chips and salsa to share. The salsa was spicy and smoky how I like. For my entree I ordered the beef chimichangas. It was music to my hungry stomach!  It came with guacamole and more chips with nacho cheese.  It was so delicious. Even after a large dinner, I ordered dessert to go. I had the bread pudding with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce. Omg, heaven for my taste buds! If I'm ever in Vegas again I will definitely come back to this restaurant!",

We had a Groupon and went for dinner- because we needed quick and close- and were blown away by how good it was! The drinks were awesome- mojitos the best! And their chips for salsa- were thick and perfectly made. It was so good we went back for breakfast! Something we never do as we want to try different places.  Breakfast was the best!!! They have a great selection of Mexican breakfasts. And you get a lot of good for your money! In fact this was better then some of the crappy restaurants around and half the price.  I'm so glad we took a chance on this place!",

    "text": "Was looking fw to coming here as my BF is a Sammy Hagar fan. We were seated in a booth after I requested it. Our server Adam was not very professional. We showed him the yelp check in free margarita and asked for light ice. He brought the margarita it wasn't light ice and I said I asked for light ice... he shrugged his shoulders. Really??? My BF while dipping chips into the salsa discovered a long hair literally buried in the salsa that was served with the greasy tortilla chips. Omg how disgusting. At this point we were Leary and my BF wanted to leave so I asked for the manager. She came over and said we threw out that batch of salsa and we told her about the margarita with the ice issue. She got me a new margarita with light ice. Also we told her that we're off to a bad start and were Leary about ordering anymore food. She assured us she would make sure that our order was checked by herself personally before coming out and she would come back to check in. Well that never happened. My BF asked her which steak platter to get and she recommended the NY strip. So trusting her recommendations that we decided to order. I ordered a salad with carne assda aka there version is (sirloin steak) and my BF ordered the NY strip. Omg my salad had no carne asada. It was chopped up pieces of bacon and my BF NY strip steak was all grizzle. We both sent back our entrees. They remade my salad with slices of carne assda which was very chewy and he got the carne asada (sirloin steak). My salad was meh it was thrown together very quickly and his carne assda again was extremely chewy uneatable and tasteless. Reluctantly we ate the meal. Adam brought the bill and they tried to make it look like a discount. But it wasn't much especially for all the issues we had. So we again asked for the manager and my BF noticed our waiter was whispering to another server and both looking at us. Wow....how tacky and unprofessional. The same manager came back along with a guy which was never introduced to us and she said I was dealing with a party but she did walk past are area several times but never stopped by us during are entrees as promised to us so my BF told her that his gut feeling was he wanted to leave after the hair in the salsa and that he sent back the NY strip and he showed her the uneatable carne asada (sirlion steak) as proof and said this wasn't the experience he was looking for and was extremely disappointed.  She paused and her body language wanted to do nothing. The guy with her said remove the carne asada. Wow really??? Thanks....so my BF went to wash up and the manager came back with the adjusted bill and I told her this was overall a horrible experience and my salad was meh. She said finally I'm taking care of the bill. Please come back.  LOL had you not avoided us and been more attentive when are entrees came out and also didn't come back after we both sent back are entrees. We arm wrestled with them to get the entire meal compted in itself is just bad customer service period. My BF gut feeling was correct. He wanted to go to the Border Grill after the salsa incident but I wanted to give them a chance. HUGE MISTAKE!!!!!",

Wife and I stopped in to get a quick bite/drink before seeing a show. We shared the queso dip and chips, dos ceviches, and mexican tossed salad. Queso dip - ok. Dos ceviches - amazing. Some shrimp ceviche and some chipotle tuna tartar. It was REALLY good. Like enough to tell people about and \"go back for\" good. The salad - surprisingly good. Very simply dressed, cilantro and corn included. Very good. Overall, pretty good. Even better if you can get a seat out on the patio for some people watching.",

    "text": "I came to Cabo Wabo to use a Groupon ($30 worth of food for $15) and because, frankly, I was intrigued by the schizophrenic Yelp reviews for the place. I had an early lunch around 11:30 am on a Wednesday and sat outside to watch people walk by on the Strip.  I had a pretty good experience at Cabo Wabo. The Cactus Pear Margarita was surprisingly tasty, and I'm not always a big fan of margs. I had the guacamole (not as great as some were saying, but pretty decent) and the jalapeno cilantro chicken. Nothing was spectacular, but nothing was terrible either.  To me, the big downer on Cabo Wabo is the price. But come on, it's right on the Las Vegas Strip - what do you expect? My drink, guac, and entree came to $34, so I used up my Groupon and then some. Between the price of the Groupon and the amount I paid in tax/tip, the whole experience ran me around $26. Without the Groupon it would have been $41, which seems awfully high for one person. However, Cabo Wabo does have a happy hour from 4-7 pm with half-price drinks and appetizers. I'd imagine that would be worth your time - if you can get a seat.",

Our bartender was Maggie and she was great. We had a couple beers and a Waborita, which was excellent! Prices were about what we expected.  I was a little turned off by our drinks being served in plastic cups but I guess that seems to be the norm in many places nowadays.  We did not order food but the fajitas that kept going by us being carried by servers every 10 minutes or so smelled AMAZING. We will try them next time for sure, as we had nothing but bad luck in the Mexican food department in Las Vegas.  A girl came up to us during our drinks and asked us to pose for a \"free\" photo, which she later brought back to us in a cardboard Cabo Wabo frame for only 15 dollars. Does not sound free to me! but we bought it because we liked the picture and we were enjoying ourselves. Why not remember the moment in a free photo that costs 15 bucks?",

We had THE BEST server... very cool, conversational, fun and handsome.  We really enjoyed our time with him.    We each ordered a chicken and a beef taco.  The flavor of the tacos was good and it was great to see a place claiming to serve Mexican food ACTUALLY USE MEXICAN CHEESE!   But $13 for two tacos was a little steep, regardless of how good they are.  Overall, my experience seems to be better than some on here...but YES it is a tourist trap.  And if I could offer a suggestion - when in Vegas - try your hardest to avoid female servers/waitresses/bartenders.  They are all so sick of drunk tourist and/or businessmen hitting on them non-stop that they all have a chip on their shoulder.  Avoid them.",

Our server was helpful & pleasant, the food was fine, but it was the bus boys and clean-up staff that made this experience a total turn-off and will not make me recommend this place to anyone...  On weekends the place suppose to close at 1:00 am, but for whatever reasons the bus boys, started coming around and asking are you done yet repeatedly etc..additionally, they went as far as turn off the heating lights on the outdoor umbrellas and the heaters. If you told us, we need to close the outside area and if you mind sitting inside, that wouldn't have been a problem. But, by throwing these subtle hints and not being professional about is a huge turn-off for my family and I. Message heard loud clear...you don't want our business and believe me  will not be back.",

The bartenders and staff were the most entertaining bunch of people i have ever met, and they made an amazing Margarita. The bartenders were hysterical, and they made that experience worth every penny. Wish they didn't have to close for the night! Cant wait to go back!  Also absolutely loved the background music playing. Nothing better than a Classic Rock mix while you are having a few drinks!",

I asked about their patio setup and specifically stated that the most important thing to me was staying warm, since I would be visiting from Chicago. She sold me the $250/person patio package on the basis that the heaters would keep us warm and that we would have an unobstructed view of the fireworks (spoiler alert- also not True). The heaters here don't give off enough heat to warm you up if you are HUGGING it, literally. If a heater doesn't semi-burn your skin when you physically touch it, it's not going to give off enough heat to warm a person up in 30 degree weather with wind. I would have paid HALF the price for the upstairs lounge tickets if I had been well-informed.   I contacted her today to share my disappointing experience, and explained that I didn't feel my experience was worth the money I paid. I gave this establishment the opportunity to make things right with me, and they refused to do so. \"I'm sorry you had a terrible experience, but there's nothing I can do for you.\" Not even an attempt to salvage a client relationship.   DON'T BOTHER SPENDING YOUR MONEY HERE. YOU'LL PROBABLY END UP REGRETTING IT.",

A good location of course since it is on the Strip and has a good outdoor seating area. All this would have made sense if the food was enjoyable!  Didn't take much time to get us seated. We decided to sit on the outdoor patio because the view was good and that particular day was bright and sunny! Their music was really annoying. It was too loud. Apparently, that wasn't deliberate. Something was wrong with their music system and the volume was going up and down. Better to rather shut it off!  Margaritas were good. My husband bought Veggie Tacos which came with some beans and they were okay. I ordered Cotija-Crusted Cheese Quesadilla(with Chicken) which tasted good but was super-duper oily!! I don't mean to exaggerate but it was very oily and the oil was just dripping from the quesadilla. It had a side of beans and rice.  Rating the following out of 5:  AMBIANCE - 4 It had a nice outside seating area. Not sure about how was it on the inside.  FOOD- 3 Margarita - 4 Veggie Tacos - 4 Cotija-Crusted Cheese Quesadilla(with Chicken) - 2  CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4  WAIT TIME - 4  HYGIENE - 2 This is mainly due to the quesadillas I ordered.  PARKING - Not sure about the parking. We walked down from our hotel. Parking in Vegas, especially the strip is a bit cumbersome so it is better to take Uber/Lyft.",

    "text": "This was one of my favourite meals in Vegas.  I asked the concierge at my hotel where she recommended we go for breakfast, and this is where she sent us.  Service was fast and friendly and the food was delicious.  Except for the breakfast quesadilla.  It was agreed that that was the biggest let down and was just kind of \"strange\".  My meal however, was delicious.  I had the CW Eggs on a skillet with Chorizo added.  The chorizo wasn't overly spicy or greasy.  Potatoes were perfect, and everything was topped off with a scrambled egg.  Other meals at my table included the same skillet but with bacon, two orders of the Huevos con chilaquiles, the HBLT Breakfast sandwich and the breakfast quesadilla.  As I mentioned, everything was a hit, except for the quesadilla.  I would definitely come back!",

We were told a certain price for an item, but when the check came a different price was listed. We mentioned it to the waitress and once she realized that we were not okay with what we were charged, she slammed her check book and walked away mid conversation. We flagged down the busses who told us the price originally, he declined telling us what he did and insists that he told an \"unsure answer\". He also has an attitude and walked away. The check was fixed but their attitudes should be fixed as well. Very unfair and it wasn't our fault that we were misinformed by an employee.",

From our table adjacent to the hostess stand we could hear her talk poorly in foul language about customers (including us!). Hostess was also crying & talking inappropriately about her personal life to coworkers. She seemed possibly intoxicated.   Also be aware of the CNS fee, a random 4.7% fee added to your bill.",

I really did not want to mention his name, because it would ruin his day once he reads this review; however, I thought he might be better off knowing why this review had to be written.   The hostess promptly took us to the patio seating on a Thursday night. Anthony did not approach to our table for about 10 minutes. Once he came, we were not really sure what we wanted, but he seemed to just want to rush us. He never greeted us, nor smiled. He just gave me an impression that we were not welcomed at all.   Then, we ordered a pitcher of margarita, chicken taquitos and carnitas tacos. A food runner brought out the food. We asked for napkins to this guy, and he never brought us. We ended up asking our server, Anthony, and he actually brought us the napkins and hot sauce right away- which was one good thing he did for us. Then, we were eating and chilling there. We were about done with our food and drinks, deciding whether we were going to order more or not; however, Anthony approached to our table, and without saying a single word, he started taking away all plates and cleaning up our table. HORRIBLE. We are literally thinking what to order next, and he just decides to make us a reason to get out.   We just ended up getting out of the restaurant. I know strip food can suck, but the only reason why a local resident would come out to the strip and pay extra money for bad food is because they got nice ambiance and proper service; however, Anthony did not even get the basics right. I would never go back to this spot, just because they have failed me so bad last night.",

First of all, even inquiring about the pricing and availability left a bad taste in my mouth, as nobody was getting back to me. When I did talk to the event manager, I specifically asked her regarding heaters, and she assured me that there would be plenty of heaters and that wouldn't be an issue. This would have been the perfect time to even try and up-sell me to an inside couch/table, but the event manager clearly wasn't paying attention to my concern. I was thinking they would be the industrial type heaters you see up and down the strip outside hotels, but this wasn't the case. These heaters were poorly rigged under the tents, and the taller heaters did not give off heat at all. I felt I was really fleeced by the event manager about this situation. All you can drink? Well...kind of. You were limited to one page of the cocktail menu that was \"included\". Shots were included in this...until all of a sudden, 15 minutes in, they weren't anymore. Also less than truthful. Best view for fireworks? Again, not True. We managed to still have an okay time, if we went up to the Loft area so we wouldn't get hypothermia.  But that wasn't the experience we paid for, standing room. Food was mediocre, but our server was really attentive. I wouldn't choose to spend NYE here again, nor would I recommend it to others, unless you get yourself a Loft couch.",

The views from this space were fantastic. We could watch the Bellagio fountains and had great views of the Las Vegas Strip. Lots of lounge style seating with a delicious Fajita Buffet. This space also has a private bar which worked well for our group.  Everyone really enjoyed lounging around, having a few drinks, and taking in the views.  Thanks Cabo Wabo!!! We will definitely be back.",

My group and I were not expecting a 5 star dining experience walking into Cabo Wabo but what we weren't expecting was  to be so dissatisfied before our food even came. Our server recommended the specialty Cabo Wabo margarita because it's \" made in house\" and the other marg was basically a mix. So we ordered some pitchers and then some chips and salsa. When the chips and salsa and drinks came we were so hungry we dove right in. The salsa tasted like burnt cigarettes, and the margaritas were the worst I have ever had. Too sour and soooo watered down. Mind you pitchers were $45 so we were expecting something much better. We decided we didn't even want to give the food a chance (I had previously heard a table behind us talking about how horrible the food was.) We asked to cash out and got out of there as fast as we could. I will compliment the manager for only making us pay $30 for a $100 bill. Yes $100 for horrible chips/salsa and margaritas. We then headed over to HEXX which was amazing and a much better experience.",

    "text": "Cabo Wabo averages 2.5 stars so let's face it I didn't choose it for the menu or service. This place does have a few great things going for it- they took our reservation of 14 (tough to find on the strip without a set menu), there is a beautiful patio located in the middle of the strip (with a view of the Bellagio fountains), it's a fun atmosphere with music, and the price point is low. Sold!  So why only 3 stars? We should have been assigned our own server with a group our size, but we weren't. It took forever to get chips/salsa (which they charge for!), I got my drink after my meal though I ordered it long before, and a couple of the orders were wrong. I asked for no onions or sour cream on my tostada and it had both. Also, one of the girl's tostadas was missing the tostada (no tortillas)! Not sure who else's order was screwed up.  The food was actually really good, no complaints there. But my big complaint was when the checks came (we had 7 checks) I left to go deal with our transportation at this point... I got back 20 minutes later and checks were still sitting there with our cash/credit cards. As you can imagine our hummer limo waited for an extra 30 minutes for us and I paid about $40 more because of it. Not happy with the service here at Cabo Wabo.",

Now as for food, the salsa was amazing, I loved it, boyfriend thought it could use more spice. Waitress kept trying to force us to buy drinks, but we didn't want to get too wasted and not be able to go out on the strip late-night so we just ordered waters. As for entrees I ordered the chicken fajitas, they were okay kind of bland and the seasoning had a funny flavor going on. Boyfriend has the carnitas platter and he said it was \"better than expected for american mexican food.\"  The big negative was that our waitress didn't come pick up our check . We waited for about 30mins and ended up giving it to another waitress.  All in all atmosphere was great, food was decent, service wasn't too good, but they do give you a little postcard with your picture on it that you can use for 20%off your next visit which is a nice souvenir.",

We were excited when the bowls arrived with the tortilla shards, avocados and other add-ins in the center of an empty bowl. The soup was in a pitcher which the server poured around the add-ins.  We thought was a fun and unique way to serve it. The soup itself was very thick and brown - which wasn't at all what we expected, but we kept an open mind. It wasn't good. My sister doctored hers with sour cream and was able to eat about 1/2 of it. I had probably ten spoonfuls and couldn't eat any more. Ick. The meat (beef) on the nachos had a weird flavor and was very strong. Neither of us liked it. The cheese was a runny queso-esque  concoction. The serving was generous, but we barely made a dent in them because they were not tasty.  The highlight of our visit was our adorable, friendly and attentive waitress Sarah Ma.  She was fantastic. If you want to get drunk and then eat, you most likely won't care that the food isn't good. If you want to party and drink, then this place would be great.",

THE FOOD: Is commercial at best and expensive. A better dinning experience can be had by buying a Swanson Mexican TV dinner and taking it to your room. To make things worse, the service was slow. The waitress acted bothered when someone from the party made a request.  THE BILL: They added an 18% gratuity and some other mystery charge ( check your receipt for it)  When my friend confronted the waitress about this other fee, she was told that all places in Vegas charge this fee. Well, we ate at many other restaurants and never saw that added charge anywhere; CROOKS.  Lastly, when we paid our bill, in cash, the waitress never brought our change? When my friend asked where our change was she said, \"We always keep the change.\" LOL! AS IF!  We made her give us our change back. She reached into her apron pocket, grabbed an uncounted amount of coins and said, \"Here.\" (the rest of that was, \"Now go away!\")  Go to Mon Ami Gabi, if you want superior food and a classy dining experience; it is only down the street, in front of The Paris hotel, and less expensive!",

It was a tad pricey for alcohol, $11 for sangria (although, it was a pint)....and $15 for a salad with no meat (I assumed they would knock a couple bucks off for not wanting the meat). So the entire thing with tax and tip was $34. So i was a tad shocked.  But...the service was fantastic. Super nice and helpful. And the salad was amazing. Tortialla shells on the bottom, with guacamole, lettuce, onion, tomato, avocado and beans.  Delish. Definitely could have used more beans, however.

I'm more inclined to say that there is a bit of a timing issue with the food/drink preparation as we had some lengthy waits for drinks and for chips (after getting our guacamole).   I can overlook service hiccups at Cabo because the food is DELICIOUS. The chips, salsa, and guacamole alone make this place worth a stop. I also can say only good things about my chicken enchiladas, as can my friend regarding her carne asada tacos. The rice side here is special as it's not just red slop...almost more like a paella sans proteins!   Of note, my Mango Picante margarita was not particularly strong, but it was pretty and tasty.",

My buddy and I wanted to chill and have a couple drinks, so we gave it another try for drinks and appetizers.   We asked to sit on the outdoor deck overlooking the strip, and it was all good this time.  Our server was very attentive and fun.  The margaritas were good.  The chips and salsa were good.  The \"Mexiyaki\" chicken wings were great.  We had a great time and ended up having \"more than couple\" margaritas along the way.     Pricing seemed fine for drinks and appetizers in Vegas.  I think the tab with tax for chips and salsa, chicken wings, and about 8 margaritas was about $100.00    All in all, I'd say Cabo Wabo is great for drinks and appetizers if you want casual and if you want to sit outside.  They have indoor seating, but I can't speak to that.  For me at least, one the main draws is the outdoor deck overlooking the strip.",

The guests looked happy & the staff were busting their butts....(except the bartenders)  Cons:  we sat at th bar & got awful service which is weird bc they weren't busy.  This is a service based city, so waiting for silverware to eat ur food, not to mention a drink to wash it down (wtf) is not a huge request....  The cheeseburger was w/o cheese :( and th bun (while tasty) was a little cold.  The med rare burger had bled badly onto th bun, which is kinda gross... Overall the flavor of the burger was decent, though.  The fries were fine.  With better execution the meal would have been pretty good - - the bad service was the clencher in this case.",

I knew it was a tourist trap but even with that I was surprised how bad the service and food was.  Had to beg for our (mediocre) chips and salsa.  After 20 minutes of not getting our drinks this time I called for a manager.  He told us that our server got tied up with a large group.  I guess our group of 7 was not large enough.  Finally after asking him for our drinks he went and got them.  Having ordered a $7 draft Coors Light he brings that back 3/4 full *sigh*.    At this point, we just want to get our food and hope it's at least decent for the outrageous prices they charge.  Nope...wrong.  I ordered a steak soft taco and steak enchilada.  If you like the $2 steak tacos at Taco Bell then you would like these.  Seriously, I couldn't taste the difference.  Out of 7 dishes, only 1 person said their food was actually good.  Continuing on with the bad service after waiting to get our check, we all added up our totals.  We were in the process of leaving our bad tip (sorry I usually tip well but this was terrible, un-apologetic, bad service) when a different (new) server comes out and asks if she can see the check because she believes she needed to add something to our bill.  Yeah right...  I know the patio has a nice people/fountain view but avoid this place if you can.  I love Sammy Hagar but he failed especially with this place.",

The service on the other hand was very good, attentive and on top of things.  There was no \"push\" to turn the table and get another tip which was nice in that type of setting.

I ordered the fish & chip (16.95) & my companion ordered the chicken enchiladas (15.95).  The waiter asked if we want sour cream, & we said yes. The food was pretty good, but when the check came, they charged us $1 for the sour cream (you'd think it's free because it's a little dish of sour cream). On top of that, they charged a fee of CNF (2.15) which he explained it's a franchise fee. I've never heard of such a fee. So do you pay for a franchise fee at McDonald ? I don't think so. Also I understand they were busy, (but really not that busy; it's a Tuesday night) the service was really slow. Although it's not much money, I think the restaurant is really cheap to charge for sour cream & the CNF fees is ridiculous. Anyone here can explain what this CNF is???",

The outside looks like any other \"frozen\" bar you would encounter on the strip. I walked up to the hostess stand and asked \"where is the restaurant\" she pointed down a long hallway.   The restaurant itself is pretty small but it does have two levels. The second level seems to be a banquet/rental area and this is where our event was held. I had a margarita and while it was decent it was way too sweet and syrup-y for my tastes. A friend ordered a vodka soda and we were both shocked to find out the tiny little 8oz cup w/one shot costs $14!!! I have paid less at a nightclub! That's where the place lost two stars, I understand you're a strip bar but come on! $10 would even be an insult.   I tried a piece of pizza and some taquitos, they were pretty good but I didn't sample the actual menu. The music was way too loud for a networking event or even sitting down to dinner. Overall this place has potential if they lower their prices.",

    "text": "First off I'll be discussing their Margarita bar that faces the mall, and then the actual dining experience.  A friend of mine offered to buy all of us a Margarita. They had the usual sizes, and then some of the ridiculous huge weird ways of drinking. You can get the large long one that you see people walking around or a guitar. Honestly the smallest size they offered was more than enough. It was actually made really well, because usually most places I get them, they taste disgusting. I just had the original flavored one which was great. The person who served us had a well... uhmm huge rack :)  Now as for the food. Our other friend suggested that we try their ridiculous 8lb nacho platter challenge. Only up to 4 people can be involved, with no bathroom breaks, and a 55 minute time limit. If you should complete it, you get the meal for free. Otherwise it's 55 bux. Now I thought... well we just need to each eat 2 lbs, and I have ate 2 lbs of food before. So it's possible.  I was completely wrong. As soon as our waiter dropped it off, I already saw a wall of defeat immediately. It was ridiculously huge and had a ton of sour cream and guacamole. It was delicious to eat for 10 minutes, then the mental breakdown began. Staring at the food did not help, and we ended up quitting after 30 minutes in. We ate a good 70% of it. Now if there wasn't a challenge or hurry, I would have fully (no pun intended) enjoy it. It had shrimp, beef, and chicken in the mix. It was by far one of the best nacho's I have enjoyed.  Things I disliked: The chairs. Some of them or low and some of them are high. They don't give you the best support and are extremely heavy and uncomfortable.  The service was good, and he would regularly check in and check our status.",

I saw that he was busy and going back and forth with his drinks and orders but whenever we needed anything, he was right on it.

The hostess was nice enough to put us at a table in front of the TV with the game we wanted to watch. We ordered a pitcher of pina colada, but instead got a pitcher of the Cocorita, but didn't complain because it tasted good. We shared the tuna ceviche, guacamole, and quest fundido which were all great. We also shared a carne asada burrito, which wasn't bad, but the enchilada sauce was too smokey and the carne asada pieces were a little too grilled bordering on crunchy. We'd definitely go back for another lunch next time we're in Vegas.",

The Atmosphere looks so cool, and the music if you're a latino its just awesome. It can get a little bit too load in the evening and sometimes it bothers if you're eating and want to talk to your friends.  I order the carne asada, my sister the tamal with beans and rice and my mother some shrimp tacos. This was the worst mexican food i have ever tried in my whole life. It tasted like microwave american mexican food.You know it had \"that flavor\" that superficial flavor you get when you buy frozen microwave food. Even Taco Bell its way better than this place,and hell yeah,i hate taco bell.  I asked the waitress to call the manager. I told the manager i didn't like the food at all. The whole 3 dishes tasted terrible,and i even told him this wasn't legitimate mexican food,and guess what he said: This is Texas Food not mexican. This  restaurant its from Texas.....Omg! This its the most ignorant manager ever. Cabo Wabo its named from Cabo San Lucas, Baja California. Not Texas,Come on people,read a little....  I had to donate $80 dlls for food i didn't eat, plus $20 dlls for some pictures they took. I bought them because we looked nice....",

I'm from Texas so whenever I go to a Mexican restaurant I'm used to chips and salsa being free, so it kind of sucked you had to pay extra here. They were good regardless but nothing Jaliscos can't do better. We all three ordered tacos and they were all delicious, kind of street style like. The steak and chicken tacos were a bit dry so we'd put salsa on them. Fish tacos were really good. The waiter said their margaritas were famous so we ordered that. They were good but not sure how that can be called famous. I'd say go there for brunch or lunch if you're wanting to people watch or relax outside with good food. But don't expect anything life changing. It's the location that makes its great.",

Let me tell you - the Yelp deal is SO NOT WORTH IT.    The on the house yelp Margarita was way way way way too sweet.  It was like a bunch of sugar with a tiny splash of lime and tequila.  I would have rather dined at another place than wasting my time.  My carne asade tacos themselves were good, but the rice and beans were cold.  Like they were just sitting in the back in a silver bin waiting to be served to the next victim.   Lastly, the server seemed attentive but really wasn't.  After asking him - TWICE - for some hot sauce for me meal he then questioned why I would need it and asked wasn't the salsa on the tacos hot enough?  Thanks yelp for the incentive but next time I'll definitely pass.",

Once our server did greet us, we were starving and put in our order immediately. Once the food came out, we didn't see our server for another 30-40 min after we had finished so we just got our check when he finally did check in. Worst thing was one girl in our party paid with cash- I believe her bill was $14 and she put in $20 and the server didn't bring back any change at all. I think it's pretty rude to not let the customer choose their tip but maybe that's the etiquette in Vegas? The food was a  2/5. Best thing was the chicken tortilla soup.",

In the past we've had the enchiladas, chicken plate, and all of the above has always been amazing! There is even a patio area located right along the strip so you can enjoy awesome views of the Bellagio Fountain!

Regardless of the amount of people that decided to eat there at the same time we did, which was a lot, the service couldn't have been any better/faster! Our server was attentive at all times and super upbeat!   The food was very tasteful and so were the drinks. I got the carne asada torta and a house margarita. I definitely recommend both! The torta was delicious and so filling that I was only able to eat half of it. I put half of the blame on the fries, which were also super good.   Prices were pretty reasonable, specially compared to nearby spots taking into consideration that it's a tourist area.  All in all, definitely five star worthy!",

We had a conversation about celebrating our anniversary in Vegas and he treated us to free shots! We returned the next day and free shots again! He took the time to talk to us and made us feel like we made a new friend! Awesome service! Great food! Fun time! Don't skip this place! Oh! And you can spot the Bellagio foundations from here too!",

They offer complimentary chips and salsa. The guacamole was fresh & very good, they are very generous with their portions - we couldn't even finish it. You definitely get your moneys worth! The tacos were good as well. Very filling.   Overall prices were decent.   It's a big and spacious restaurant! Located right off the The Strip.   I'm happy we stopped by last minute!",

Simply ask for a Seat on the railing, order a giant margarita and take in the sights of the glorious Las Vegas Blvd. at 3 AM in the morning. Folks it doesn't get better than that. Cabo has some amazing appetizers and some of the best short rib burritos I've ever had in my life. Laura has always been my server every time I've went and she is awesome. Super friendly and extremely knowledgeable when it comes to anything on the menu. So the next time you have a craving for a nice cold beverage and you want to take in the sights, don't hesitate, Head on over to Cabo wabo and enjoy.",

Unfortunately my group of 8 chose this place this past Saturday. None of us will ever return.   Unfortunately we were treated to the worst service ever. That was agreed upon by all 8 in our group. No one was pleased with the food. My jack n coke burger was drier than the Vegas desert. Our waiter was a bald white guy. I point out that he was bald because all 8 of us watched him joke for 10 minutes with a neighboring diner about their both being bald, all while we tried to flag him over for our checks. We never once saw him come to check on us after one drink and food order. I wouldn't have even taken the time to write this review, but I want it to be known... the bald white waiter is a THIEF! He gave himself an additional $5 tip from just my tab, as my bank statement clearly states it. I haven't yet heard from the other 7 in the group but I wouldn't be surprised if he wrote himself larger tips with them as well. TRASH! That is STEALING! And might I add CREDIT CARD FRAUD?   Ignored, sub par food, and a waiter that stole from nice customers? No thanks! I'll make sure everyone I know doesn't waste their time and money on this biz. Plenty of other options in Vegas anyway.",

Even though the sun was shining we sat near one of the heaters outside. We started with a pitcher of Bahama Mamas. The pitchers are $46 and for us held about five tall glasses. I had one during lunch and my sister had two then we both got a to- go cup to take the rest with us while we shopped. Totally worth the money given you can pay $16 for one drink at the bars here.   As far as food goes make sure you order the chips and salsa. The bucket of chips is huge! We each ordered a burrito. Nothing special about the food but for the locations and drinks I can see us returning again.",

We never, ever got drink refills because the waitresses never bothered to come check on us. We had to ask for our check. We almost ate our arms off waiting for our food.

They did what they were supposed to, but wasn't exactly working for tips as it relates to service with a smile.. That is the only reason I didn't give this establishment a 5 star rating.

I found this place for my stay in Las Vegas, on the strip at Cabo Wabo Cantina. Upon arrival, what better way to gear up for a week in sunny Las Vegas that enjoying some great music, in perfect view of the southern portion of the strip, with a Margarita on the rocks with a salted rim. The outside music is played through some really nice sounding, full range sounding speakers and the genre is mainly that of classic rock.  Two Margaritas with a caddie and I was off, knowing I would soon return. Unlike more hostesses at many dining establishments on the strip, I had come to the unfortunate realization that most are disinterested or too busy gabbing with a coworker. Addressing the party properly and getting them seated promptly in the dining area seems to play second fiddle, these girls did just that.  The three juice Mojito which is not on the menu, but a quickly thought concoction of pineapple, strawberry and something, the juice was a puree I thought to try something different.  Straight forward menu of traditional Mexican dishes, nothing too dangerous or risky. The Carnitas platter once served looked like a skimpy little nothing plate for one, once we began to dig in the pork showed its density. Seven hand rolled flour tacos later and two people were nicely filled,  if you add in the chips. No up charge for a few additional tortillas. The Macho Salsa will really clear your sinuses as it was the hottest item I had all week and I order everything hot.   Great service by our server Ron, who kept the drinks coming and did whatever it took to make our wisit to Cabo Wabo an above average dinner experience, he deserves special mention.",

But what I'm talking about is an annoying pyramid scheme which my friends experienced while here this weekend.   We were wandering around the Strip one afternoon when my friends wanted a frozen boozy slushy. Cabo Wabo was closest and decided to wait in line for it, myself included since I can partake in a frozen daiquiri from time to time. The bartender tried to sucker my friends into larger drinks than they wanted, and then poured in an extra shot of rum into their drinks without really getting confirmation. The spiel of the extra shot is that you get to spin a magic wheel with prizes on it--hats, free drinks, the like. The catch, which comes after the bartender pours her extra shot is that there is only one spin per group. I'm gonna throw the bullshit flag there. After my friend won a \"Cabo shot\" the bartender said \"the bigger the tip, the bigger the show\" at which point I said point blank to her face, \"so basically it's a pyramid scheme so you guys get more money.\" She looked at my like I was a) right and b) a witch with a \"b.\"   This whole experience left me incredibly frustrated as a hostess and makes me dislike management and company policy for something so ridiculous.",

The hostess looked like she was 10 years old w/tattoos all over, that was a bit creepy and we had no idea who our waiter/waitress was because they kept changing and no one told us anything or introduced themselves to us, so when we needed something we were kinda scratching our heads, because one minute someone was coming to our table asking if everything was good the next they weren't trying to help us but someone else would (& not that we kept calling them over because we weren't, maybe once or twice). Leaving the place was difficult. We couldn't find anyone to give us our check, all of sudden no one was around for like 15 mins, that was odd. Will I recommend this place to friends, probably not.",

The Cobb salad was pretty good too, very light, huge portions. The bf ordered a fajita however and it was so-so, very meh.  Service was friendly I thought. The waiter even asked if I was 21 then gave me tickets for free drinks.  And it wasn't that loud, during the day/lunch hours at least. For a quick lunch, why not.",

I think a lot more people would have been enthusiastic had this idiot not racially profiled a table with some Asian folks.  His first question to them was \"do you speak english?\"  Seriously... he made it that much worse by making lite of his comment, and acknowledging that he racially profile.  Disgusting!!!   He wanted them to move out that table cause.... well who knows why, he just did.  However the next set of folks that say there, he didn't ask them about the language they spoke, nor did he ask them to leave.    I hope others read this and make an effort not to support this place until they get rid of this bigot",

Not only did he provide great customer service but he was very friendly, did a great job of informing us of the specials that weren't on the menu and was just all around very personable. Danny sold us on getting the trio ceviche platter which included ahi tuna, shrimp and red snapper. The best ceviche I've had hands down and the seasoned chips that came with it were amazing. Been to a lot of places to eat and I can honestly say that Danny is the best server we've encountered. It's employees like him that make people want to come back! Great experience!",

I dined here based on the recommendation of a friend who said that the atmosphere of the restaurant was lively and entertaining. However, they had never actually dined there themselves. I did them a solid and told them to avoid this place at all costs.  My main motivation for choosing this spot was that it is directly across the street from my hotel (Cosmopolitan). While the service and atmosphere were fairly pleasant, the food was a downright letdown. My sister and I ordered two cappuccinos, carne asada tacos, and guacamole. Everything was at most mediocre in taste with the exception of the carne asada tacos. Those came with a side of rice and beans which were absolutely disgusting to the point where I couldn't get myself to finish them. The beans were stale and lacking in flavor. They literally tasted as if they had been left out sitting for an hour or so. Gross! The rice tasted as if it had come directly from a box and soaked in tomato sauce. This may fly for unsuspecting patrons whom have never had the distinct pleasure of having a solid plate of rice and beans, but no sir, not me. It was pitiful. Not only that, but I really do believe I got food poisoning from that disgusting food. What an absolute disappointment. Not only did this restaurant shaft me with their overpriced, subpar food, but they also caused me to have severe stomach pains (I'll spare you the details) for the rest of my trip. Avoid this place if you want to be able to enjoy Vegas.",

This was fantastic, and we scoured the skillet with our tortillas for every granule of meat and cheese we could.  On the server's recommendation I ordered the Cilantro Jalapeno Chicken entree, which was an excellently-served chicken breast with a spicy sauce and onion straws on a bed of vegetable hash.  I was very pleased with the textures in particular, and the vegetables specifically (alas that I was too full to finish them). Unfortunately our seats were not very good.  We were at the table closest to the door to the patio on a very windy night, with a poor view of the football games on TV.

A restaraunt usually can't disappoint me when I am starving and hungover but Cabo Wabo managed to do that. Congrats!  For the love of god, please don't come here. The food was so bland and terrible and the service is even more horrid. First off, I am pretty sure our server had tourette's. Not that there is anything wrong with that, I just feel like you should be warned before having to go through that.  I had been walking on the strip for a while before getting to the restaraunt so I was totally parched.  We were seated and no one acknolwedged our presence for 10-15 minutes so I had to get up and go to the bar and ask for water. Tourette's server finally came to see us but he was seriously a hot mess.

Chicken Fajitas and Pork Carnitas were bland and tasteless. We ordered a pitcher of margaritas, I am a lightweight, I had almost 3 glasses and never felt a thing. My husband used to bartend and seriously doubted ANY tequila was in there, the overwhelming flavor was sweet and sour. No dissing the waitress as she attempted her best with no help from front door staff or bus staff. Yes it was a busy Saturday night but did they not expect that? C'mon already it's the strip! The only part that made us feel any better was the view of the Bellagio water show. Come sit at the bar overlooking it and have water!",

Dad and I went down for lunch, and we had a Groupon that was good for $30. We popped in around 12:30 PM, and it was already a difficulty just to find someone to seat us. There was no waitress around to seat us, so the hostess had us wait at the podium for a few minutes, and then she finally sat us herself. At this point, it was no biggie.  We sat down, and a waitress came up and took our drink order pretty quick...very friendly girl. She brought us some chips and salsa, which were pretty good.  I ordered the 4-item combo plate with a Carne Asada soft taco, a Chicken soft taco, a beef enchilada, and a chicken enchilada ($19) . Dad ordered Chicken nachos ($13). Let me just say, this is HIGHLY overpriced food.   The food was brought out, and we marvelled at how little was actually on our plates. Dad's nachos consisted of eight chips with chicken and cheese centered around a scoop of guacamole. To make matters worse, they were extremely bland.  My food was more of the same disappointment. I had asked for my soft tacos with just meat and cheese only, and they were PILED with stuff. When I finally wiped everything off, the meat didn't even taste great at all. It was all extremely bland. The rice was okay, but the enchiladas were HORRIFIC. I've never tasted worse green sauce in my entire life.  Throughout the meal, there was this annoying bus boy who hovered around our table. Whenever we would pause in eating, he would run up to our table and ask if he could take our plate. He did this three or four times, and every time he seemed to get cockier. Let us eat our mediocre food in peace!!  After all was said and done, I'm glad we had a Groupon...though I wished I hadn't even spent the time eating there. Avoid!",

We decided to venture out to find Cabo Wabo and finally found it at Miracle Miles in PH. The decor is very tropical, but we weren't here to admire the scenery. Went to the side of the restaurant that's actually in the Miracle Miles shop and there were two girls taking drinks order. We requested the drinks in the guitar, but couldn't decide on the flavor. She gave us samples of the ones we wanted to try. Finally we decided on the drink that tastes like mango..I forgot what it's called. She puts it in a guitar and turns the guitar on which was pretty cool. The drink was $50. Now I'm not much of a drinker so I don't know if 100 oz of alcohol is worth that price...is it? Very cool experience all in all.",

My lady and I decided to get a marg at the Red Rocker's lair on an extended layover between flights. I ordered the signature drink, the \"Cabo Wabo,\" while my wife ordered the \"I Can't Drive 55.\" As somewhat of a mixologist myself I must say that the drinks were subpar but what do you expect from a crummy chain restaurant at the airport? But upon receipt of the bill  we immediately renamed it \"Cabo Robbo.\" 35 bucks for two lousy, no-tequila, corn syruppy \"margaritas?\" Unfortunately for us, the menu did not have prices but we figured 10 bucks max, not 15. If there had been even an ounce of tequila in the drinks I would not be hating on this business so much. Cabo Wabo deserves to die.  Here's a poem I wrote about it: Cabo Robbo  (Sung to the tune of Van Halen's Cabo Wabo) I've been to Taos; Austin, Texas Man, I thought I'd seen it all Around the world, workin' my passport Man, I thought I'd hit the wall  There's a crappy bar, at Las Vegas Airport It's called Cabo Robbo cantina and bar Made me want to file a health report You know I wanna punch Sammy Hagar  If you go there once, it' won't suffice Lots of crappy drinks, tasting like bleach The blue syrup sure makes them look nice But once you taste one, you wanna screech  We gotta try a shitty bar, called the Cabo Robbo It ain't alright by me Come on, let me take you down The biggest rip off you ever seen Like a slot machine but more rundown  McCarran Airport, you'd have to see it man Ain't no picture ever say it right Walkin' the concourse dodging Nascar fans Place is filled with scroungy 'Merkans, what a sight?!? I wanna catch my flight.  You know I wanna get back to Frisco It ain't all right there Wish the fog would lift at SFO Everyone here looks like they eat Crisco  Come on, let me take you down I will show you around Let me take you down The biggest rip off you ever seen Over the barrel at the Vegas airport",

We were able to sit on the patio rail which is the best dining seat aside from Bubba Gumps Patio seat so far in Vegas.... ( on the Strip I haven't had the pleasure of too many balcony Seat's thus far,  Still to come)  The patio is right across the street from the Belagio hence you get to check out the Water show (which is awesome) every 1/2 hour.  Also it's kinda the heart of the strip so People watching is pretty cool as well.  We were sat and waited on in plenty good time.  Everyone was very nice but quick.  I ordered Queso Fondido Con Chorizo and no alcohol since we don't drink although that part of the place looked like it did exceptionally well.  The Queso was super donkey good.... I loved that more than anything.  I would go back for that alone... even above the Patio Rail seating.  We ordered the Combo 2 (Gulf Shrimp & Grilled Top Sirloin) Fajita's.  They were good not the best but the accoutrements (grilled onions, peppers, cheese, Sour Cream & Such)  were awesome that were with them... The steak was just a tad tough and since the Shrimp while large were Jumbo Gulf Shrimp they were not plentiful however, all the same it was an above average Fajita dish.  All in All after touring the rest of the restaurant (A.K.A visit to the local johns and the Big Red Wall of hanging Photo's of Sammy and Friends) I thought it was an awesome place to eat and hang... I will return and not soon enough most likely.  I will however most likely get Taco's next time since those are my favorite Mex food. Oh, and as to why I gave it 4 Stars instead of 5 the music was very loud and I play and sing rock music (so, that is to say I love loud music) and the music here was super loud almost too much to even hear the sever.   ~Vegas Rob!",

There are so many places better than this in Vegas that this should be your LAST choice.  To start, it took the waiter about 45 minutes to come over to our table, and that was after we had gone up to the host and asked for service after the first 20 minutes.  We ordered drinks and food at the same time, and we never saw him again until we tracked him down and demanded the check.     On top of all that, he got the orders terribly wrong, forcing us to send a dish back and wait another 15 minutes for it to be remade with the correct meat (I was given Carnitas and I am Jewish and don't eat pork).  The final insult was when I received my credit card bill and saw that I had been charged three times what my meal cost.  When I disputed the claim, the receipt I was sent had food on it that I did not order, and DID NOT HAVE MY SIGNATURE ON IT!!  IT WAS NOT MY BILL!!!  The waiter had given someone else a bill with my credit card number on it!!  They REFUSED to refund my money, even though I offered to pay for the food that I HAD ordered.

I forgot the name our server, but he had minimal personality and we only saw him once after he took our order and it was to give us our check. The food itself was okay, but definitely overpriced... $18 for 3 street-like asada tacos with beans and rice is kinda nuts... but hey, it is Vegas!  If the service would've been better, maybe I could've justified the food price, but it's hard to say... not sure that I would try again.",

    "text": "Although I thought the service and the food was good, I'd be remise if I didn't mention the discrepancies in the bill and tipping procedures. I happened to be alone while on a business trip, so I sat at the bar.  As usual, they ask for a credit card to start a tab.  As I ordered my drinks and meal, the bartenders updated my tab as expected. Before I was just about to ask to cash out, I reviewed my bill and gazed down at suggested tip amout at the the bottom of the bill.  As I was at the bar,  The suggested tip amout I chose was 18% which was based on the SUB-TOTAL, which is standard at all restaurants who add these suggestions. So I asked to cash out and I got my new reciept (with the same total as the tab, you know.. the copy you sign and actually add the tip)  and NOW the suggested 18% tip was increased.  So I did the math and found that they now based the suggested  tip on  the TOTAL  bill,  not the sub-total.  Hey,   Im all for the servers to make money, and I ususlly tip between 18%-20% based on where I am. but I felt this was sneaky.  I brought it up to the bartender and she immediately brought in the manager into the conversation and I got a lame excuse that they have had this happen before and its a computer thing.  So whatever, all I can say is buyer beware.",

She was talkative and gave us options. Definitely coming again.  Unique flavors, the street corn was too good, it had lots of butter with seasoning and lemon so yummy. The barbacoa tacos were perfectly decorated, my husband got a cheesy burrito he loved it. I'm into mild, the barbacoa wasn't that spicy to me mild:) but my husband can't handle mild so might be a little spicy to others. We got the brownie ice cream dessert so good!!! So happy with this place.. $53 with the street corn, 2 tacos, cheesy burrito and dessert",

The food was horrible. Who puts Parmesan cheese on \"Mexican\" food???? There were 4 of us and we ALL had an issue with the food: one person received the wrong dish, one person had under cooked food, two people received food with everything covered Parmesan cheese, so it all had to be sent back at one time or another. In addition to that, the seasoning of the food was disgusting and there were VERY long waits for everything, including water. We spoke with the manager to have our meal comped or significantly discounted since not one person was satisfied and we would have to spend MORE money to eat someplace else afterwards.  She simply shrugged and said all she could offer was 10% off (roughly $1-$3). We then got up to find the register so we could pay our bill and get out of there to find some really good food (since the 4 of us were STILL hungry and unsatisfied). The manager  sent security to follow us, thinking we were leaving without paying the bill, even though we each had our bill in our hand. What an aggravating way to start our vacation!",

If you like people watching on Las Vegas Blvd or want a great seat to view the Bellagio's fountain show, this is the place! We sat by the rail outside and loved both.  We watched two of the guys from Thunder Down Under try to solicit people for their show and take pics with people.  We watched the same with many of the show girls too.  We enjoyed seeing the visitors dressed from the nines to the ones that rolled out of bed and took a stroll.  Oh my did we enjoy our people watching!!!  Note - the hostess wanted to seat us elsewhere and told us there were no available seats but we just walked passed the rail and told her that was unTrue.  She relented and took us to our seats. Be alert as  I felt like these seats may be used as a draw into their business and they want to keep them looking available.  (that's just me speculating b/c of a weird feeling encounter with the hostess)",

My mom started off with a peach margarita which I've attached a photo of and it was wonderful! We then ordered the ceviche to share. We were unaware the ceviche did not come with chips. Every restaurant that we've been to has brought a basket of chips with the ceviche. We asked the waitress why this was and she had attitude in her tone. The situation was then escalated to a manager who then brought us a complimentary basket of chips and explained to us that this ceviche was meant to be eaten just with a fork. Super strange and even stranger how we spent $12 on this appetizer and they can't even add chips to it without an extra cost. I'd love to go back and try more of their actual meals but they really should clarify next time what does and doesn't come with chips to save the headache.",

After later checking the menu, the drinks should have been $13.00.  The purchase of the glass was not explained or asked by the waiter.  He was pleasant but I feel taken advantage of.

Out pitcher has TONS of ice more than half the pitcher was ice. The it was tasty but  we had trouble tasting the tequila! Price $47+TAX. Our entrees were Pulled Pork Platter: Excess fat on meat, little meat, NO pico de Gallo, No corn tortillas only flour, Beans were runny and no black beans. She order Nachos (no meat she is vegetarian) She found some meat in her nachos and she was gross out and didn't eat. We asked for limes and took about 7 minutes to bring 3 wedges. We asked for the bill and came out to be $99.00 with a $20 cash tip. We had a terrible time here. We enjoyed our company but the food, drinks and customer service was very disappointing. We didn't enjoy our lunch at all so we paid and left. I hope management reached out to me and we can discuss more about this matter. I don't recommend this spot to anyone celebrating their anniversary or a special day. Its bad service and overpriced. Not worth what you pay. I don't recommend Cabo Wabo to anyone out there. How can we had enjoyed our lunch there? No way! We don't seek perfection but we do seek good hospitality.",

However, you need to be aware of the scam Cabo Wabo will put on you when you're not looking.  One of the members of my dining party ordered a $9.00 draft beer off the menu.  Ok,...$9 bucks for a beer is high, however it's the Vegas Strip so that was expected.    What wasn't expected was when we got the bill, he was charged $18.00 for his $9.00 beer.  We asked about it and the waiter told us the beer is $9.00 and the \"commemorative\" Cabo Wabo glass was an additional $9.00.  WTF!  $18.00 bucks for a 22oz beer?  Needless to say the $9.00 surcharge was reflected in the waiters tip, since he didn't warn us about that.  Buyer Beware!  This is a scam and a rip-off!  Also, you're stuck with an unwanted glass that you have to carry around with your when you're walking the Strip.",

This Vegas magic performance is not a good thing. Chicken and Steak take time to cook!!!  I can tell you, from the taste, that this was not cooked to order.....  NOR was it cooked anytime in the past hour prior to eating it.  I'm suprised I didn't donate my food to thier bathroom afterwards, it was so gross I didn't finish it.  The waitress never came back to ask us how our food was, nor did anyone for that matter.  **Ramsey alert, I think this place is a canidate for Kitchen Nightmares!!  If you want a cool patio view and a drink of some sort, this is your spot, otherwise, RUN, not WALK, somewhere else.  Overpriced microwave food can be had elsewhere!",

We sat for a good 10 minutes before being acknowledged, we ordered a cocktail for my wife, chips and guacamole, and a Diet Coke for me. When the waiter brought the coco-rita my wife, he spilled part of the drink on the table, he left immediately with the drink tray for other tables, as the flow of my wife's spilled drink spilled off the edge of the table. We were left to scramble for napkins from empty tables to soak up the spill. Her drink started out mostly ice anyway, and she had just a few sips left before it was gone. Just a margarita glass 3/4 full of ice. The guac was ok, the salsa was a dark tomato pasty looking thing, not much flavor. Almost $40 for 1 drink, chips and guac, and a Diet Coke. What a lousy time.",

The chairs however are uncomfortable. This is a good spot to come with a group to have drinks. Now to the food. We ordered the teriyaki wings to start which were very good. They were crispy and the sauce was tasty. For the entree I had the Fish Tacos which tasted good but the fish was tough and over cooked! My hubby had the beef enchiladas which he said he enjoyed. Both dishes came with rice and beans which we both didn't really care for. Our server was very attentive and catered to our needs. I had a Groupon that I purchased which made our bill only $20 bucks! Can't beat that! Will we return here probably not but overall the meal was okay!",

The diablo shrimp was cooked in a sweet sauce, far from spicy. The beans taste like bbq sauce, and are nowhere near refried. We ordered a pitcher of the cadillac margs, but the mix they use tastes very sweet, not like a traditional margarita. Worst part is that the service was great & location was convenient on the Strip. Too bad the food quality is so low.",

The wait staff was extremely helpful and exuberant. Our waitress was attentive and kind, even when we had to wait on a late member of our party. She continually checked if we needed anything and gave us great recommendations for the food. We were really pleased with the service, especially since it was a packed restaurant on the Vegas strip.  I ordered the \"Three Way\" (I know, it sounds terrible) as my beverage of choice. It was one of those icy, mixed cocktails from the slurpee-looking machines in the front of the establishment. And let me tell you, it was far from terrible. In fact, if the alcohol didn't pack such a punch, I might have ordered two. The drink is a mixture of raspberry, blueberry, and blackberry flavoring. It was light, fruity, and very refreshing on a Vegas summer night.   For my meal, I ordered the Chicken Enchilada Combo, which includes rice and beans. And if you just look at the picture I've supplied, you can already tell that it was amazing. I loved the verde sauce on top of the enchiladas themselves. The chicken was succulent and full of flavor. The rice had a good amount of spice and the beans were fresh. The cheese was also yummy; thoroughly melted and mixed.   We also had several servings of chips and salsa before our meal. The fact that we kept asking for another heaping has more to do with the fact that the chips and salsa were both crisp and fresh, rather than because we were starving.   Finally, the food is heavy. In other words, be prepared to pack a to-go box.   Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Cabo Wabo. And I look forward to my next visit.  Happy feasting!",

We came for lunch and sat inside. The outside was more packed than the inside, but the Vegas dry heat is not our friend. The inside is extremely spacious with plenty of tables, and a photographer came by to take our picture as a souvenir while we waited for our food. They end up giving you the picture printed for free, plus 20% off discount on your next visit! The servers and hostess were accommodating and they never left us alone for more than 5 minutes. I might be exaggerating a little, but it seemed that way. Now the tacos, they were too spicy for my taste. I should have ordered what my boyfriend got, but I don't like ordering the same dish twice. I could barely finish them since the spice was too heavy, but if they weren't too spicy, I would have definitely finished every last bite. It's a memorable place because we have a picture souvenir, but definitely not somewhere where we'd go again. Even if we lived in Vegas.",

    "text": "Maybe my expectations were too high for Cabo Wabo, but since I am a big fan of Sammy Hagar's song \"Heavy Metal\" from the Heavy Metal Soundtrack, I convinced my boyfriend to go here with me one night on our Vegas trip.  For one, a cockroach crawled across the middle of our table before our food arrived. We were in the outside cantina area, so maybe this can't be CW's fault, but several of the nearby tables were dirty and seeing that was pretty gross.   Since we didn't leave after the cockroach incident (why) we were there to receive our steak and chicken fajitas for 1 to split. They were really, really bland. We discussed whether they had forgotten to season them or if this was the intended taste. As Texans we could not come to a conclusion about how this happened or what was going on. I've seen many 5 star reviews of this place so I'm now completely confused. We should have sent them back but were just a bit embarrassed. Our waitress was really nice and we felt bad for her.   Finally we got the bill for $60, after two drinks, an appetizer and the most bland fajitas of all time. Not worth it.",

WITH A TAD BIT OF BACTERIA IN THE FOOD!! some of us have went to the hospital and doctor because of it. Cabo Wabo you should be glad you aren't paying for our medical bills!!!! i don't understand how the other reviews are happy with their experience at Cabo Wabo... it was absolutely terrible.",

    "text": "First of all, my friends and I are locals. We knew about this place and we were hoping they might have some Cinco de Mayo specials or at least some good Mexican festive music. Nope, the joint was blasting their tinny-sounding MP3 music on impressive looking speakers. (waste of good speakers)  So we went out of our way to get here and park so might as well stay a while. I had a feeling our bill was going to be outrageous in the end, but it *IS* the strip so what do you expect. Sort of wish we went to Casa Don Juan but I was overruled. The service we received was actually pretty decent, especially considering how busy it was on a Sunday late afternoon on Cinco de Drinko. Our server was Ashley and she was really sweet, very on top of things so I have no complaints about service.   We had a party of 5, and we only had to wait maybe 10 or 15 minutes to get seated inside. I ordered a margarita verde which had some cucumbers in it and it was pretty decent, even if it was an overpriced $12, again, it's the Strip. My bf had a couple of regular margaritas, and my friend ordered the \"special\" margarita which was $20 and you kept the glass. It was a frozen drink and was a pretty big size. She said it was good but on the sweet side.   My boyfriend and i shared some nacho platter (no meat) and we thought they were really delicious, I was quite surprised especially after seeing such bad reviews on the food. The nacho sauce was really good... and it had plenty of super *hot* jalapenos. We ate it all, it was an enormous portion but I was satisfied with paying $15 for it. My friend ordered an avocado burger which she liked. I think our other friends got shrimp ceviche and beef taquitos. No one complained, and we had been there for at least 2 1/2 or 3 hours.   I had two margaritas and the bf had 3 margaritas, plus the nachos, and our total came to a whopping $82!!!!! HOLY. COW. The kicker though....  they sneak in this \"CNF\" charge which was I think 3.5% of the bill. It was around $2.70 on ours anyway. We questioned the fee and the waitress said she \"didn't know what CNF stood for, but it was something the casino or the mall made them pay because they had to pay for rental space there??!!!\" WHAAAAAA...? It wasn't a very good explanation. Since when does something like that get absorbed by the customers, isn't that the cost of doing business on the miracle mile? Just another Strip ripoff. We didn't make a big deal out of it with her but we weren't very happy with the extra charge. Probably not coming back here anytime soon. The reason for the stars rating is because of the prices and the ripoff CNF charge, come on, management, really!?",

When we got there, the table was ready and the servers were ready. We had one that took one side of the table and one that took the other side. More friends joined us and they just added another table and never complained. The servers never complained about breaking up the checks and came around often to check on us. We had the games on (Football Season) and even though my Chargers were not a priority game for most, they made it a point to have it on just for me.   The food was good and the drinks were delicious. I had a drink with coconut on the rim. Yum!  I recommend this location to anyone and everyone who wants to just check out the place or go and enjoy with a large party.",

There was so much Cilantro in the sauce and even more cilantro mixed in with the chicken it was extremely over powering.   But what saved a 1 star rating was the service and the drinks. The drinks were awesome. I had the key lime martini because I love key lime pie. Its really tasty. It is rimmed with graham cracker crumbs and it tastes like a kicked up key lime pie.

The service was great too. Friendly and attentive. Even though there were vegetarian options on the menu, we stuck to appetizers. The salsa had a smoky flavor, and the guacamole was good.

They have a nice crust to the outside that I hadn't seen before. The queso was below average in my mind but the drinks were good and it was a nice place. Again, this whole no free chips and salsa thing kind of blows my mind when getting Mexican food...",

We went to the bar; the counter seats were full, but not one of the 30+ tables had a guest seated. We let the hostess know we'd like a table since the bar was full. She asked us if we would be having lunch there as well; we just ate and were not interested in dining, we just wanted drinks. Both of the hostesses that were there informed us that they could not seat us at a table if we only wanted drinks. I MIGHT understand this if there was a high demand for tables, but keep inmind that NO ONE was seated at the tables. They couldn't spare one table and serve us drinks?!?! We asked \"you're really going to turn down paying customers because we don't want food?!\".....her response \"it's our policy; we can't seat you if you're not ordering food too.\"  We went a few doors down to La Salsa Cantina, and had a couple of delicious margaritas & food was not mandatory.   Why in the world would you turn down a paying customer?",

Sure the hot female staff in daisy dukes advertised turned out to be a prissy dude in jeans, but that wasn't too bad since the female waitresses tended to have a muffin top.  The drinks weren't good and overpriced, but with a few good drinks and several okay ones before you get here, who cares?  I ordered the mahi mahi. It's all right that it arrived rubbery and tough, because I just sent it back and got the short ribs with spit tacos instead. Given enough alcohol, the blandly seasoned meat won't matter as you revel in the extra grease that was such an integral part of the dish. If you're planning on being blind drunk in the area and are looking for a place with a bathroom, this is an easy half star better than peeing in the street!",

    "text": "If I could rate it less I would. I came here for my dinner during my birthday weekend and it was absolutely  horrible. We were greeted friendly by our female server.   Sidenote: My boyfriend and I both work in the restaurant industry, him as a  kitchen manager and myself as a Front of the House manager so we are usually very patient and understanding when it comes to restaurant  problems.  After waiting 17 mins (I looked back to when I checked us in on facebook when we sat down) for drinks we munched on chips and waited for our server to come back and take our food order. She didn't come back. 20 mins later I saw her and flagged her down and she walked right past me. Not long after she comes back and takes our order. I ordered the carne asada and my boyfriend had fajitas. After waiting 20 minutes and looking around I noticed that our female server was leaving and a male server was coming on to take her place. She told him that we were fine, not waiting on anything. 15 minutes later when we finished our drinks he came over to our table and asked how we were doing. I said our food was taking really long and he said he would go find out what was going on. He talked to our old female server and she said 'oh sh*t'  and then asked what we had to order again. We saw her go in to put in the order and 18 minutes later our food came out with our new, male server. He acted as if everything was ok. Over an hour later and 3 rounds of chips and salsa and we just now got our food and it wasn't even that hot. I told my boyfriend if I said anything I was going to get really upset because we had not even been  apologized to at this point in time. Our new server dropped off the check with NOTHING taken off and didn't even apologize. We flagged him down and explained that we had waited so long and it was ridiculous not to have anything done to our bill. He then apologized and we got $15 dollar off our $120 tab, after ordering more drinks in the mean time. I didn't know if I was more shocked that no manager was informed of this situation or the fact that I can remember  the situation months after it happened as if it was yesterday.  Shame on you Cabo Wabo. You ruined that night and my experience  at your establishment. Do you not have a manager on duty to deal with guest complaints?",

Our fajitas came out well done ( bad move on taste and texture), when we explained to the manager that we'd had fabulous food at the other location... He was quick to inform me that the owners are not the same, and therefore the food wasn't the same. I don't think I will make this mistake again. He did offer to cook the fajitas to temperature, however, he made it seem like if you want meat that is still flavorful and juicy, you would need to request it. I also notice that the beef used was nit of the same high quality as the tahoe location. Tsk tsk . If you're reading this and want good food, this isn't the place.",

    "text": "The experience was okay. Part of it may have been our own fault because we were so excited to be there, we had high expectations & wanted to love it because we think Sammy Hagar is awesome. The atmosphere is fun & the decor is super cool. We sat at the outdoor bar & it was several minutes before anyone greeted us, which was fine because they were busy. I don't know the name of our waitress but she provided us with great customer service. We went during Happy Hour & my husband ordered chips & queso with chicken added. I ordered the dos ceviches, consisting of shrimp ceviche, ahi tuna ceviche & chips that were coated in what I believe was chili powder. I ate the chips but honestly, didn't care for them. They just weren't for me. The shrimp ceviche was alright but the ahi tuna ceviche was delicious! I wish I had more of that! Someone brought my husband chips & salsa (he enjoyed the salsa but didn't order it...?) & he inquired about the queso he ordered. The person serving his food wasn't our waitress but she came up to up right then & confirmed the queso order so that came out a couple min.utes later but there was no chicken. We just asked her to remove it from our check. The margaritas were good. It says on the bottom of the menu that they reserve the right to change the Happy Hour menu, which they obviously do because the menu at the cantina did not match the menu online, which was actually a little disappointing because the online menu was better! They're also one of the only places we've encountered that doesn't allowe outside beverages in.",

The front bartender let us sample as many flavors as we wanted of the 1/2 yard margarita and answered all of our questions about what was in each drink flavor. One of the girls I was with is allergic to gluten. This means she can only drink potato grain vodka or tequila. The bartenders explained what flavors were safe for her and let me sample the rest!   In the end, we both ended up getting the 48 oz half yard Strawberry margarita with an extra tequila shot. Each. This was a mistake. We are experienced drinkers...but this was too much for each of us to drink. This would have been great to share!   Pretty good marg, not the best I've had, but really good service from the bartender!",

We were just taking a stroll on the strip and noticed a ton of people having fun on the patio and thought it would be a great idea to grab a bite. We were prepared to wait considering the amount of people eating and drinking there, but we were seated immediately! That was a pretty great start! And it didn't end there.  The food was extremely flavorful, we found ourselves ordering the calamari twice before our main course was served. The ribs was the only downfall, they weren't the best.  But our friends had the tacos and loved them.  The fun environment coupled with good food, drinks, and prime location makes this a great place to visit",

I have now discovered they make skinny margaritas which is cool for those of us watching our figures ( and not just watch them expand). I also love the chopped salad with chicken. It is so filling and not heavy.  Only thing I miss is when the bartenders could have a shot with you and they made it more of a party on the patio kind of atmosphere. But they are still great to hang out with.  Shout out to Kristy, George, Dara, Louisa, Dee, Joe and everyone else who works there. You are what makes Cabo Wabo so awesome   Last night for the  first time we sat at an outside table instead of the bar because we Had our minor daughter with us. Laura was our waitress and she is AMAZING! We also had Jennifer, one of the managers check on us and she truly takes her job seriously. We made a \"suggestion\" and she made sure we were taken care of. Dara, one of our FAVORITE bartenders, also Made sure to make our drinks exactly how we like them.

The hostess was flirting with a table of guys so we had to wait a few minutes before we were even acknowledged. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table which was reasonable considering how busy it was. When we were seated she places us along the rail right in the direct sun. When we asked if we could possibly be moved further down the rail into the shady side she just walked away without a word.   Our server Brian M. greeted our table right away but it was all downhill after that. It took 20 minutes for him to arrive with our drinks. When our food came out, everyone's entrees came out except for mine. Our server never returned to check on us. Finally my friend walked over to another server asking her to please send him over. He came over and I explained I never received my entree. By this time ten minutes had passed since everyone else had gotten their food. Another ten minutes go by and finally Brian M. returns with my dish completely unapologetic. He was gone again before we could ask to order another round of drinks.   The food was just okay, nothing spectacular. There are many other great choices along the strip. We will never return to this establishment..",

Well, I finally caved in one day because I was starving for food and service attention especially after my dinner disaster at HEXX.   From the hostesses, to the waitress to the busboys, everything was excellent. The staff members here are full of energy and provided our table with great service. I ordered the Cotija cheese crusted quesadilla w/ chicken and requested 2x rice, instead of the beans. I was surprised by how good it tasted. There was plenty of chicken and filling inside the quesadillas. The tortillas were grilled perfectly, with a great crispy texture. For the $15.95 price tag, it was a great deal considering we are in Vegas. My buddy ordered the burrito and enjoyed his food too. The only qualm I had was with the fountain Coca-Cola beverage I ordered. It was extremely watered down and lacked carbonation.   Cabo Wabo Cantina, you did not disappoint me!",

This manager completely ruined the wedding. Fuck Cabo Wabo and it's shitty manager",

Waitresses are definitely dressed for tips as it's Vegas, but thought it'd be slightly classier coming from the staff. Only individual drinks applied for the happy hour, but you save more still getting the pitcher. Wasn't a very good deal, disappointing.  Food was beyond average. Tasted like something I could buy at the grocery store, so taking a guess everything is just freezed to prep. It's right along the strip, but still kind of taken back by how overpriced everything was. I wish we had went elsewhere, won't be returning.",

I also love tequila, and enjoy Sammy's signature Cabo Wabo tequila.  Every time we are in Vegas, we stop by Cabo Wabo for some tequila.  The best value is the flight of Cabo Wabo, which is 3 shots -- a blanco, a reposado, and an anjeo.  If you don't drink tequila, this is three different levels of aging, and a great way to start to understand the various grades.  We usually have some appetizers here too -- and they are all pretty good.  Prices are typically Vegas, of course.  Don't forget to check out the gift shop.  My flex-fit Cabo Wabo baseball cap is now of my favorite hats!",

All of their tacos are soft shelled except for one of them, so I was forced to get that one because they pre make them so they couldn't switch out the shell and I hate soft shell tacos.   Tacos come with rice and refried beans which I didn't want, so I asked for double rice. I think they forgot that I asked for double rice. I'm kind of glad they did because the rice was dry and unflavorful. I literally had to drown it in salt and pepper. The tacos were good. They were the beef ones without any dairy, added avocado and cilantro.   We got the bill and we were charged some odd fee. I asked the waiter about it and apparently it's because they are in the Planet Hollywood mall, so they pass it on to the customer. NOT COOL. I won't be going back for expensive, mediocre food and ridiculous fees on top of it.",

I tried to stay on my eating clean health kick which it really hard in Vegas but I got the Cobb Salad and water. I forget what my hubby ordered but it looked really delish. The service was quick.

The nacho's were actually very good and enough toppings for every chip.  The drinks however turned out to be $12 a piece on special. So for 3 12 oz (fat Tuesday style) really bad margaritas at a \"tequila cantina\" for Cabo Wabo it was $24. You would think they would take better pride in the drinks here since it carries the brand name of a Tequila company but no...  So, for all you tourists or locals... do not accept drink coupons from the strip because it will most likely be some type of scam.  The house always wins!

Has a chance....Based on my recent visit I would have tell anyone thinking of trying this place to think twice and try something else.  There are a lot of choices when it comes to eating and drinking on the strip.  The fact that Sammy Hagar has his name attached to this place will put people in the seats, but I won't be back.  Service was poor.  Our server was much more interested in the water gun fight going on with his co-workers than he was in any of the tables.  It's Vegas you should have a good time, but the patrons should have a better time.  Everyone that was seated around us was also frustrated.  The food was a little bit below average.  For the money I was not impressed.  We had ordered some nachos, chicken enchiladas, and a Jack and Coke burger.   The real tragedy here were the drinks.  Until the day that I ate here I had never not finished a drink.  It was so sweet that it might have actually ruined my meal.  For $10 dollars or more this was the worst margarita that I have ever had, and I have had hundreds in my life.  Nobody at the table was able to finish their margaritas, and we all had a different flavor.  I said something to our server and he said \"I don't know what to tell you.\"  Something tells me they get that all of the time.  If I remember right there is a Fat Tuesdays down the hall inside of Planet Hollywood.  Stop there and enjoy the buzz.",

The BF and I got a couple of their 'signature' margaritas. They were pretty terrible. I had the prickly pear margarita and it was very strong and tasted fairly terrible. Also, they put some super spicy stuff around the rim of the cup that was really unpleasant and was not mentioned on the menu. The drinks were 12$. This was ridiculous.

There were no seats looking out on the strip so we sat down at a table and waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. One waitress walked by and glared at us, giving me a look like \"what the fuck are you doing here and why are you making my life miserable?\" So we waited a few more minutes and left.   What I observed while waiting was that the ritas are served in plastic cups, which tells me that they are not going to be good. And the food looked very mediocre. I doubt that Sammy would be happy. But then again, everything is so over-priced he probably is raking in the dough.",

The Red Rocker, Sammy Hagar owns the joint and they blast classic rock all night on the patio of the new Planet Hollywood.  The food was meh. Pretty average, but not terrible. We stayed next door at the Paris, and the Cabo patio served as a great spot to meet up to catch a buzz.  I ordered tacos, nachos and enchiladas in my two different visits. Think of a spicier \"Chevy's.\" The Grilled Poblano Nachos were exceptional - the rest was just aight.  The service was spotty both times too. 5 stars for drinking spot, 3 stars for food, 2.5 stars for service. Let's call it a shade above a three-star experience.",

Your in a Mexican joint so you must get a margarita and we decided on the Cabo-rita. Yes, that is the name. Kinda clever and kinda not. The margaritas were decent, decent amount of alcohol, and a decent lime mixer was used. Not too bad for a trendy touristy joint like this.  We just landed in town and we were looking for munchies, so we got the following appetizers: * Lobster Taquitos - I actually like these a lot. A little too much. I would definitely order it again next time. * Some Grilled Shrimp in Butter Sauce Dish (forgot the name of it) - This was excellent as well. The only negative was there wasn't more of it on the plate.  Overall, Cabo Wabo Cantina has good food and decent drinks. I can definitely see myself hanging out on the deck outside, getting smashed drinking margaritas, and eating good food. The only negatives to the place is the wait staff can be a little slow at times and our waitress would hide out so it was difficult getting another drink. All things considered, I give Cabo Wabo Catina 4 stars.",

At this point I didn't even care anymore I was starving and had already ordered anyway. Manager was going to give us the $30 off (what we paid).  Hubby had a \"michelada\" and I had a mimosa. The michelada was warm, the spices and salt on the rim of the glass tasted awful. My mimosa was nasty, the orange juice tasted like sunny d and lacked champange.  I ordered their \"huevos rancheros\" and hubby got the Nachos version of the Huevos rancheros. Both came with breakfast potatoes. The food was surprisingly yummy. The orange sauce on the huevos and nachos had a great flavor.  By this time we had some friends join us at the table and we were able to use the $60 voucher.

She gave a very rude answer, which were something like: \"I told you it would be 20 minutes and you have definitely not waited 25 minutes.\" After that I was baffled. Who treats their customers that way? Right after she finished the sentence another waiter comes up with menus and says that the table is available. I turn around to call my friends over. Meanwhile the first waitress is saying: \"Are you coming or what!? she is waiting for you. Go go go.\" In a really hush and angry voice, and the other waiter were off before we had a chance to follow her.   We were all in some sort of chock; we have never experienced anything like this before. We decided to find another place to eat breakfast after that introduction.",

I had a frozen margarita that was delicious and not too sugary or tart. The bar tender whose name I am forgetting was super cool and was pouring some good size shots - rare in sin city! The music was really good (we had been blasted with early 90's dance all day at the pool so were happy for some Foo Fighters, The Stones etc). At some point they give away free Tequila shots although that's not my thing. The misters were nice given the 105 degree heat. I'd definitely go back here!",

Yeah, the server said they were regularly 22 bucks each. They came in small plastic cups for a nice touch, they weren't bad but the food was horrible. We ordered tons of starters and everything was bla, dry, even the nachos went back!  I went the safe route and got the street style tacos and I'll tell you any Taco Truck in California is 100 times better than that dry, bland, chopped up fajita meat thrown on some greasy corn tortillas and then topped with raw chopped onions and some cilantro, I ate half of one and gave the rest all back. Ew. Actually one of my friends said she probably wouldn't eat Mexican food for a while, that's how bad it was.  Oh, and the cute bar girl poured tequila all over my face and  neck when I went up for the \"Mas Tequila\" shot at the bar. Seriously..",

The outdoor patio is great but the service was pretty bad and the food was nothing special.  There was a sign by the hostess stand that said pitchers of beer for $15 - a steal in Vegas for sure!  We asked our waiter what beers qualified and he listed off a few decent Mexican beers so we took him up on the offer and ordered a pitcher of Dos XX Lager.  About 5 minutes later he came back and told us they were out of that one so we ordered the Tecate instead.  5 minutes more he came back and said all they had was Coors Light, WTF?? How do you advertise a special and not carry anything that's supposed to be on the special??  Someone must be terrible at ordering product or they just don't give a crap, not sure which.  Our waiter was really nice about it though and he was embarrassed as well so I can't place all of the blame on him.  We decided to go with margaritas and then some bottled Mexican beers to follow and when we got our check, we really wished that $15 beer special would have been available, such a rip off!  The chips and salsa were pretty lame and the taquitos were ok but my friend said her tacos were bad.  Overall, come for the beers specials and that's it...but make sure they're available first!!",

As I was settling up my bill, the bar tender poured a round of shots for me and everyone at the wood, and then he asked me my name so he could tell everyone it was my birthday! It wasn't... but I think he saw I was alone and wanted me to feel included. The margarita I had and tacos were to die for, and I felt like I had a dozen new friends when I left.

The outside portion of the restaurant was crowded and loud and we were initially reluctant to try it out but once we peeked inside it looked pretty sedate. So we decided to give it a shot.  We ordered the Grilled Top Sirloin Fajitas for two with beans and rice on the side. The food was really good. I enjoyed it a lot. I wish that they would bring more tortillas though. The waiter only brought three for each of us. We breezed through those pretty quick and had to ask for some more because there was still a lot of meat and veggies that we hadn't finished that we needed to wrap up. The waiter apparently expected that we would need more from the beginning because when he brought the food he told us to let him know when we needed more. Why wouldn't he have just given us more at the start? They should bring five tortillas per order, not three.  For a drink I had the Sammy's Toasted Colada which was a bit fruity for my taste. It was okay but I wouldn't order it again. I was a little bit disappointed with the drink menu. With the amount of sweet, fruity drinks they specialize in one would think that they might cater exclusively to Mexican Bachelorette parties. Everything seems to be rum (oh wait - Sammy's Beach Bar Rum), pineapple juice, coconut, and various fruity fillings. Not the manliest drinks.  I liked the quiet atmosphere (judging by previous reviews this seems to be a rarity here) and the food was good. Expensive, but good. There's no sense complaining about expense when you're in a place founded by a celebrity and it's on the Las Vegas Strip. Ni modo, asi es la vida.",

I got the toasted colada with coconut on the rim that basically was a glass of ice with a little pineapple and coconut juice splashed in for looks. $15 for a glass of ice. My husband got the \"I can't drive 55\" and made it a double and it was $25!!! He barely got a buzz.   Food was ok.  Chips and salsa were good, salsa was different, like a smoky salsa. They gave a massive amount of chips.   We got beef tacos, they were ok. I got the Mexican style chopped salad. It was nice and fresh and I liked that they added celery. But I asked for grilled chicken to be added and when the salad came out I thought they forgot the chicken. Then I looked more closely and there was the tiniest bit of cubed chicken on the side. What a rip off.   Our bill came to $85. I nearly had a heart attack when I saw that bill.  It really bothered me that I wasted money on such a barely mediocre place with terrible service. Would never ever go there again. Go to Nacho Daddy instead which has way better food, service and prices.",

Perfect combo for the chunky guacamole. We also ordered some pitches of sangria for the table and requested for some fresh jalapenos inside, the bartender not only did the add on but but his back into it and muddled the jalapenos into the sangria. What a great drink it turned out to be... a little costly but at least it tasted good and was not watered down. We also ordered: cilantro jalapeno chicken... da bomb! Our waitress was attentive and sweet. I'm very impressed at the restaurant especially since it seems so touristy since it's smack in the middle of the strip.

    "text": "This past weekend, my boyfriend and I made the trip to Las Vegas, and on our first night there, after I saw a concert, we were hungry, and I made the decision to go to Cabo Wabo Cantina, due to its location (downstairs from our hotel room at Planet Hollywood) and their menu offerings. We decided to sit outside, and were seated promptly by the hostess.   After we were seated, within a couple of minutes, the server showed up, and took our drink order; I let her know we were still looking at the food menu. She left to get the drinks and I later advised her we wanted an appetizer, which didn't take too long to get, which was some type of cheese dip with chips and salsa, which I thought were good. We paid $2 extra to have carne asada added to the dip, but not much meat was given. Things went straight downhill from this point.   Our server took our dinner order, and left. We were enjoying our chips and once we began sipping on our cocktails, we both felt as if there was barely any or no alcohol in the drinks; the drinks cost $15 and $16. We didn't make a stink about it, but way after finishing dinner, my boyfriend advised the server of the weak drink, and she gave a lame excuse about some type of pour they use there. We usually order 2-3 drinks each at a restaurant like that, but since we were cheated, we opted to drink water after that. Once my boyfriend received his meal, it was clear my meal with not coming at the same time. I waited and waited and waited, and there was no meal. The server, who was not the person who brought my boyfriend's food to the table, asked me if something was wrong with my food. I politely said, \"I haven't received it yet\". She walks away, I'm assuming to go check the kitchen for my meal (which happened to be the chicken enchilada plate, with beans and rice), and she did not offer an apology for what happened. I told my boyfriend to go ahead and eat his food, so it wouldn't get cold (he had fish & chips), and I waited 10 minutes longer to get my plate; still no apology from our server.   As things were winding down at this place, our server decided to bring us a free plate of churros and dipping sauces, for what happened to us, but we politely declined. Neither one of us was interested in eating anything else, let along those sugary treats. We paid our bill and left. my boyfriend asked me if he should have asked to speak with the manager, but I told him not to bother, especially since we were given virgin cocktails and paid a lot of money for it. I'll go back to Margaritaville next time. Beware if you're buying alcohol here, and you should read some of the other negative reviews this establishment has received here on Yelp, since other customers have had similar experiences there.",

It was very crowded, but not just with people, the tables are way too close together it is a very unpleasent atmosphere.  It was also way too loud in there, you had to shout to be heard by the people you were sitting with.  It was dinner time, not night club time, there was just no reason to have to music so loud at that time of day.   Atmosphere aside, the food was just down right bad.  I had the fish and chips and spent the rest of the evening trying not to vomit as I walked the strip.  It actually made me queezie.  Lastly, this place is expensive, a beer....one 12 ounce bottle of beer was $8.00.  Eight dollars for 1 bottle of Coors Light!   There are many places to eat on the Vegas Strip, I for one will never go back to this place.",

But the thing that was odd was all the other toppings were in these strange shaped side plates, it was kind of messy. Other then that, the beans sucked. Luke warm, mushy and frankly unappealing. The rice tasted like it came out of a box. Honestly this place was a bit of a let down, I was expecting something delicious when i walk down the strip of Las Vegas. The building inside looks cool, lots of art and live music too! I highly recommend taking a picture with the framed picture of nickleback.",

    "text": "I'm compelled to join Yelp and add my review of this place.  Simply put, the food is not good, and overpriced.  I wouldn't mind so much the expense if it was good, but it was bad.  Just bad.  When my partner and I arrived, we were seated by the hostess pretty quickly -- it was late on a week night.  We chose to sit outside, perfect spot for people watching.  We were informed that our waitress would be with us shortly.  \"She was in the bathroom\"!?  We waited and waited, and then waited.  Finally after she finished up in the bathroom , she arrived to take our order with indifference.  Apparently, we interrupted her potty time.  A long time later, some other guy brought us our food.  I ordered the combo plate --  2 taquitos and a tamale.  The taquitos were approximately 3 inches long each.  Finger food.. the kind you get in the frozen section at your grocery store.  The tamale was approximately half the size of the typical tamale you get at any other Mexican food restaurant, and about as good as a Swanson frozen dinner selection.  My partners fajitas smelled, and looked much better.  I wished I had ordered them.  He later informed me they were rather bland.  Not even on par with Chili's or any other chain restaurant.  Ok the drinks.... we both ordered the margaritas.  $10 for a small plastic cup!!  These were the kind you can get down on Fremont Street for a buck, and maybe not as good.    Advice if you must go here --  Drink soda, sit on the patio for prime people watching, and don't order a combo plate.  Don't expect good food, so have some nachos or something.   Surely they can't screw those up, but I can't attest to it.  I didn't order those.",

We pointed out that there are at least 15 other tables that are not in the sun, so she finally allowed us to sit there, while mumbling something about \"how she just sat someone else in this area\" (Not sure what she meant by that, but didn't really care).

I ordered a 'chicken fajita burrito'.. which came to he table as a 'BEEF fajita burrito'.. about 35 minutes after it was ordered..AND it had CHILI all over it... like beef chili.. slopped over the top.. along with fake canned cheese.. which I guess would be fine, if that is what I had ordered.. and i was extremely drunk.  It was incorrect.. it looked unappealing.. but hey, I gave it a chance. Sufficed to say, I won't be going back for that particular menu item. (I did mention to the server that it was incorrect... he claimed they sent the wrong one, and I said I would deal with it.. but on the bill, it was listed as BEEF Fajita Burrito..as in.. he ordered the wrong item and lied to me about it.) Mistakes happen.. I get it... I'm just sayin.  The 2 friends I was with, both decided it was pretty bad service as there were missing utensils, drinks for the 3 of us were coming one at a time.. and there really seemed to be no excuse for the lack in service, because they were not at all busy.   We all agreed that the drinks weren't bad.. and the outdoor patio is a nice attraction to ''people watch' from .. but other than that.. I will not be eating any of their \"signature\" dishes again...ever. They had chicken tenders with fries on the menu, and if I ever visit this spot again to have drinks.. and decide that I am hungry (and very lazy, because there are 10 better choices less than 50 feet away, ) I will be having those.   I don't recommend the food at all. The drinks were good and the Jeremiah Sweet Tea Vodka(?) Drink.. was tasty albeit very  sweet... but I did have 2! Anyway.. that's that.. good luck in your dining adventures!",

When we finally met them we were on the brink of starvation so decided to go to Cabo Wabo (we were staying at PH). It couldn't be that bad, right? Alas, we fell into the age old trap of being starving on vacation, picking the first place you see instead of pushing on to find something better, and eating somewhere crappy.  We sat inside for the A/C. It is LOUD in there. There were only four of us but we were practically screaming at each other. We didn't want to order $14 margaritas, so we got a round of Blue Moon beers. They don't have a drink menu, so we found out when we got the bill that these were $8.50 each. Rip off. My friend ordered chips and salsa. The salsa was pretty decent. I got two chicken soft tacos. They were ok. A really huge portion, I could barely finish one of them. My husband got some kind of burrito smothered in cheese that looked disgusting. He said it was alright.   We were seated next to an annoying stagette with a bride who thought it was awesome to stand on the table in her bikini bottoms singing along (badly) to Don't Stop Believing (eye roll). Props to the staff member who stood by her to make sure she didn't fall on her head.   No atmosphere, expensive drinks, and bland, overpriced food. The only saving grace was that our waiter was a super hunk.",

We walked in through the inside of the mall and there were like 4 hostess standing at the entrance talking and didn't acknowledge my 4 friends and I  so we walked in then one girl followed us and asked if we needed help . My friend said yeah we'll do we wait for you or do we sit ourselves ? She said no you have to wait for is and laughed . So we just went to the outside entrance.When we got there it was half and hour before lunch so we decided to grab drinks meanwhile I asked one of the 4 outside hostess if they had micheladas. She literally stood there is a \"uhh idk what that is\" and a smirk . I mean???? Common!! By then I had seen it under the menu and told her. What do you mean? It's on your menu!! Cabo wabo please hire people who know the menu. Our waiter tho was amazing! He brought us chips and was very attentive !",

    "text": "Went to Cabo Wabo with the family in August 2015, and found it was nothing like the Cabo Wabo in Mexico.  This Cabo Wabo is located on the corner of the Planet Hollywood Resort, on the Strip.  The good part of our visit was the margaritas.  We decided it was a better value to get the pitcher.  The margaritas where delicious, and had a good about of tequila in them.  If you decide to visit the restaurant, I would only come for the margaritas.  The server was also very friendly and attentive.  The food items were very expensive, and the portion size was very small.  I have seen more rice and beans on children's plates at other restaurants.  On the plus side the small portions you do get taste good and are freshly made.  Some of the negatives:  I have never been to a Mexican restaurant where they didn't toss a basket of chips and salsa on your table when you sat down.  Here it's a $6 charge if you want chips and salsa.  Most of the items do not come with beans and rice, that will cost you and additional $7 on top of the cost of the entree dish.  Check your bill before paying.  I noticed a $8 \"CNF\" charge on my bill.  When I asked what that was I was told it was a concession fee because the Planet Hollywood charges them for being on the property.  Basically, Cabo Wabo wants to charge me outrages food prices and then on top of that help pay their rent.  I informed the server I wanted to speak to the manager because I was not going to pay this additional fee.  She returned with different bill with the CNF fee removed.  I can't imagine how many people pay that fee without asking a question as to why.   Although the margaritas were delicious, and the food good, albeit small in portion, I would not come back here because of the very expensive prices and because of them trying to add on additional charges to my tab without informing me.",

I thought it was way too early to drink so I didnt get to taste the drinks but the girls said they were strong and good. I don't recall the name of what I had for breakfast but do remember finishing the whole plate and it was just what i needed. In fact, all the girls devoured most of their food. We were at the outdoors seating and it was nice for people watching, and to plan our next adventure. I would return here on MY future bachelorette weekend !!",

Actually, greasy is the wrong word... It was oily. Very oily. Ew.   We had basic eggs, bacon, toast and hashbrowns which I thought was hard to screw up but somehow they went above and beyond. Took an entire napkin to soak up the oil from my easy over eggs. My friend had the scrambled eggs which were clearly scooped from a bucket of pre-made, and gooey, eggs. Makes me shudder to think of it.  The service was brutal. She forgot to bring us knives and forks, then forgot salt and pepper, and the ketchup and then she sat in the corner giggling with the rest of the staff until we finally asked someone else. What a joke.  Avoid at all costs.",

They said the price includes the glass, but we were not warned or told. I said I will pay for the drink but not the glass, they will call the police if I don't pay for the glass. And recommend me to read the menu before ordering. What ahole. Ok I paid the tab but no tip. If they just more friendly not to charge me for the glass, I will easily pay them $25 in tip. Dumb people.

The service was the worst I have experienced in a city that is replete with excellent service at many turns. We were lured into this venue by friends because of the proximity to a follow on function. Upon greater reflection, we should have just kept walking to the next and much better venue. It is a shame because there is great potential with a fantastic location.",

Maybe someone else has said it, and I may have missed it, but if that is the case it is worth repeating!  GENEROUS.  It is like a triple shot! Which is good cuz it's like $9 a shot. Love this place!  Must sit on the patio!!! Excellent location for people watching, sipping a few drinks and chatting it up.  Food is mmeehhh... but I have endured worse.  Chips are good, salsa is okay.  I am a people watcher and in Las Vegas there are freaks a plenty!!  Plus Cabo has a fun carefree party environment with live music.  NO... it isn't the best live music, but it is entertaining while you people watch, chat it up with your mates and drink generous tequila shots.  It is what it is and what it is is good.",

But really....they're only deserving of 1 star....Cabo Wabo serves Tex Mex food....how can ANY Tex Mex taste bad?  Well, Cabo Wabo does it!   I ordered the fish tacos...but they were out of them!  So then I ordered the shrimp tacos....and again they were out of them!  But somehow they had the shrimp quesadillas, so that's what I went with.  What I got were these WET triangle things, that had no shrimp and basically just alot of wet cheese.  It was disgusting.  I couldn't eat it....and I eat anything Tex Mex.    IF you come to Cabo Wabo (and I would really think hard about it) my advice is to just sit at the bar and have a couple margaritas.  Thankfully they don't screw that up.  Don't eat here though.  Eat your Mexican at Dos Caminos at Palazzo or Pink Taco at Hard Rock.",

The manager was rude and allowed our waitress to yell at us and Falsely accuse us of not paying. He told us they were checking to see if they could find the cash - but after 20 minutes of waiting we finally left. I am EXTREMELY upset and will never eat here again. I will also tell everyone I know and anyone who will listen to stay away from Cabo Wabo. So unprofessional!",

Since we waited quite awhile to order and to then to finally get our food we had our share of them.  I had the Cheese Enchilada/Chicken Taquitos combo plate ($10). I thought it was on the bland side.

The tortillas had gotten cold so they were chewy, the rice was also cold upon arrival. NOT worth it, save your money and go to Nacho Daddy. Or you can just spend it all on liquor, that is always worth it. If you are a tourist and don't care about great tasting Mexican food and you love Del taco then this is the place for you!!",

Despite the slow service and music, we really enjoyed the food and more importantly, the margarita! Will definitely go back",

Unfortunately I don't remember the names of the flavors but thinking about their bar all I can remember was blue, green , yellow, red, and black margaritas from the dispenser pump.   I'm not too much of a margarita guy but hey they serve these at different hotels , it just so that those colors of margaritas are tempting for a nice cool inject of alky for the mood.   Service here was good, the bartender was pleasant, sucked that typically they tell you for extra shots cost an extra few bucks (hook it up?) Overall for a quick margarita to go, this place is recommended if you happen to walk down Planet Hollywood for some re-charging.",

It's a Mexican/Cantina type of restaurant with some great dining options.  As we approached my birthday, my boyfriend asked where I wanted to have my birthday dinner. Without hesitation I said,\" Cabo Wabo!\"  Lucky for us, they have another Groupon going for $15 for $30 worth of food and drinks!  Last time we went we shared a 3-Choice Fajita. It's a bit pricy for $45 but it is well worth it! Both times we selected the sirloin, chicken and shrimp. Both times they were fantastic!! There is the perfect amount of food for two people where you leave full and satisfied.   During our first visit I went with a margarita on the rocks which was soooo yummy!! This time we went with the buck of beer, 5/ $21. It was a bit frustrating when we walked in to the hostess and they have a little bar with a sign for $5 beers but when you go inside to dine, they bump those same beers up to $6-7 each. Not that it's much of a difference, it's more of the principal. I guess they try to get the tourist as they leave the resort with the $5 beer?   Moral of this post: Eat at Cabo Wabo's but get your beer at their bar near the host area.",

Tables were crammed together uncomfortably, and there was very little air movement. The tabletop was sticky, which I attribute to the tacky finish rather than uncleanliness....but I could be wrong. More importantly, though, anyone who is in Vegas on a budget (and we DO exist) should not step foot in this place. Overpriced-but-average bar food and drinks are not my thing! Our margaritas were $15 a pop, but not overly large, strong....or good. At that price, that drink should give me a back rub, or at least a kiss!  In short, SKIP IT.",

It was loud as a club in the empty restaurant for no reason at all.  On the plus side: our waitress was friendly.  Also, there is a \"franchise fee\" tacked onto each bill.  They do not tell you this ahead of time.  I have never seen this done anywhere else.  It is a percentage of your bill, so BEWARE!",

Hearty appetizers to fill the void from our morning of exploration in Vegas.  We sat outside at the bar and glad we did, there was a reason for our meeting.  We were so surprised to be leaving and have Wendell meet us outside.  He had shared our story with his manager, very rewarding to know in such a short time we left an impression.

I'm an admitted avocado whore so it's hard to not make me love guac.  Usually when I come to Cabo Wabo it's to have drinks outside and people watch (perfect spot for it). I would give this place 5 stars if I could always sit at the bar top outside... primarily because that's how I know my drinks are amazing! And I do mean amazing. Whenever I've ordered a drink from a server, it tends to come to me...not what I had ordered (hence 3 stars). I'll admit when it comes to margaritas I'm relatively particular, but I'm pretty clear about what I'm looking for.  Either way, it's still my favorite \"cantina\" on the strip, and will always fight for a seat at the bar top. Wait, I'm off tomorrow! I'm so overdue.",

They could not make veg nachos & my wife had to settle for queso - thin, runny and flavorless. Ordered sauce & jalepenos on side to have some flavor & were charged extra.  Beer cost $13 for 1 bud light; it takes a lot of nerve to charge this for a beer anywhere, but esp. in Vegas. This restaurant is out to take you for as much as they can and offer as cheap quality food as they can. The only reason it survives is it's location on the strip; restaurant is banking on out of town customers who know nothing of their ill reputation and to take maximum advantage of tourists.  Not many places in Vegas are cheap, but none are as expensive as this casual restaurant for what you get in return. Worst restaurant experience we have had.  Called to complain to general manager - made nearly a dozen calls in all before finally getting a call back 3 months later & it was a total waste of time. They know they do a poor job & their M.O. is to take advantage of naiive tourists. Try them if you must, but I would bet you walk out disappointed with both the flavorless food and the steep price.",

I recommend sitting outside and enjoying the live music it's also a great people watching locations as it has a little bit of hight on the balcony . The price is great for Vegas standards I think the ribs were $23 and they were MASSIVE servings.",

    "text": "First came here years ago when they first opened to support dueling piano friends who did a gig here. Last nights visit was a result of a Groupon purchased in November 2014 with a Xmas Eve expiry.  Cabo Wabo may be a hit elsewhere but in Vegas I'd have to say its an epic fail. Located at Planet Hollywood this place is H U GE!   Multi level; huge outside seating area with a great views of the Bellagio Fountains. The restaurant itself occupies the ground floor. There is a stage, lots of tables with limited room to walk around. There is a lift and stairs to take you to the levels above. What is up there I don't know. I suspect a club and/or private rooms. Not exactly sure. What I am sure if is people were constantly on the move, up/down the stairs, causing quite the fuss.   The music here is loud. Really loud for a restaurant. We were yelling at each other to be heard, as were other diners & staff. The restaurant & outdoor bar weren't busy so I'm not sure why our server Victoria took forever to greet & take our drink order. She was very nice though.  Lots or servers to be seen but none to be found. Food coming from the kitchen was ridiculously slow.   I had the BBQ bacon cheeseburger & my friend had the Cilantro jalapeno chicken breast. Hers was served with onion rings. Sadly, upon biting into one she immediately pulled a chicken bone from within the ring. Fortunately her temp crown from a root canal wasn't damaged. We still can't figure out how this happened.   I order my burger med-well. Since it took forever for our food to come out I was hopeful the burger was properly cooked bSadly it arrived cooked LESS THAN medium. It was gross. The fries tasted like fish. It took a good 15-20 minutes to get our server. Why I don't know. Numerous servers walked by our table & never stopped to ask if there was a problem. It was obvious there was...both plates pushed away from us, untouched.   Eventually Victoria arrived, along with a manager. He was quite gracious. Free margaritas & a redo on our food. Fortunately they both arrived properly done.   Dare I mention there were other diners standing on the tables dancing?  Security guards putting on their own dance act, sitting down, hanging out with friends or trying to pick up girls.   This place is a joke. Ok food not worth the wait or pricing. Irritatingly loud music. TONS of empty tables, inside & out. Bathrooms were disgusting: water & used towels everywhere. Servers galore but of no use.   Not my sort of place. Not what I expect to see or experience when I go to dinner. No wonder they ran a Groupon. This place is awful.  If you're a local like me, there are better places off strip to go. If you're a young, classless, dumb tourist wanting to do nothing but show your ass, spit, & get drunk...then this place is great for you.  FAMILIES STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.",

If the service was decent a 20-25% tip is a nice thank you but when the service is poor close to an 18% tip is generous when there was very little interaction. My wife and I had a $51.96 check, tip rounded the amount to $60 and the charge to our card posted $70.50! The tip was for the service, the food was only decent and so how the waitress earned a 35% tip is outrageous! Apparently she didn't realize I don't drink and rounding the check is an easy way for me to keep track of the amounts. I will be placing a call to speak to the management as well. We satay the table next to the bar and the kitchen. This was on 6/17/2017 during lunch. It posted to my account as a service on 6/18/2017 which is Sunday Father's Day and we were on our  ----------------------UPDATED----------------------After speaking to the Manager Jason I feel the service has been rectified. When management is proactive in acknowledging poor service it speaks volumes for any company or restaurant. Now to clarify my review of the food being decent, the carne asada tacos were enjoyed by all as well as the queso dip. My son-in-law really enjoyed the BBQ wings, and for me they had a little too much BBQ sauce, but for BBQ lovers you'll obviously enjoy them. The taquitos where the also split, my daughter really liked them, but she was the only one. So that would have to be the weakest item. Overall food was enjoyable at a fair price. After speaking with management I know we will return.  R. Ishida",

I'm an out of towner, typical tourist, taking in the sights and Cabo Wabo was actually one of my fav places to drink on the strip. Prob because of the convenience of coming downstairs in the middle of the night getting an alcoholic beverage. Either way, by the time my week long vegas trip was over I brought home about a good 4 Cabo Wabo cups. Looking forward to doing it all over again when I come back in October. I'll give a better review then since my Vegas cherry has been popped.",

I had the house, and my husband their \"house specialty\" of the evening - which claimed to be made with a reposado tequila, blue curacao, and grand marnier.  Mine was a teeny bit more drinkable than his, but was basically cheap sour mix in a 14oz. plastic cup filled to the 12oz. mark that didn't appear to have a lick of tequila in it.  C'mon people, I ordered this to actually enjoy the limey tequila flavor, not a gut-rot lime sour drink.  And yes, I did say this was slightly more drinkable than my husbands, cuz he had to finish mine.  And to top it off, those crappy 12oz margs cost us $15 each.  Un-freakin-believable.",

Fast service is almost impossible to find on The Strip, so that deserves more credit than maybe it does in other parts of the country. It's also worth noting that the manager came around to check on us, too, which is a nice touch to make sure we were taken care of. The food was better than expected, and the prices are pretty reasonable when compared to the other restaurants in the area. Some of the folks on here complain about the music being too loud, which is funny because I commented while we were eating the volume was perfect for enjoying the music while still being able to hold a conversation. Personally, I think it's a bit silly to complain about music volume when \"cantina\" is in the name and you can hear the music as you're walking in.",

    "text": "First of all this place is WAY too loud. Don't get me wrong, there is a time & a place to crank it up...like my car...but when you give up completely on trying to talk to the person NEXT TO you (NOT ACROSS) because the screaming you've been trying isn't working...it's time to go down a decibel or 2.  Second, the tables and chairs are made of wood. And, 13 hours later, my a$$ still hurts! No joke. I have never been more uncomfortable at a restaurant ever.  Third, the service. I was in a large party and there was one girl taking care of us w/o help and she did a fantastic job. No one's order got messed up, drinks kept coming (she kept track of what everyone was drinking). She rocked it.  And, lastly, the food. As is pretty typical of the Strip, the food was just OK and WAY overpriced. Portions were slightly on the small side. I had a chicken soft taco which was mediocre at best for $7. It was pretty flavor less. Husband got carnitas something which had rice, beans, and big chunks of pork. He gave it a B. He had soda and I had water. The bill came to almost $30.  Honestly, the only reason I saw the inside of this place was because of the group function I attended. I most likely won't eat here again.  There are literally 50 different Mexican places in LV I would have been happier to eat at for 1/2 the price. Chipotle has is all over this place!! Sammy shouldn't have quit his day job!!",

We thought it was just something they marinated it in. So we gave it a try but it was terrible it taste like dog food to. The management was nice but the food was terrible. And it wasn't just the state that was bad the chicken tenders for my kids were bad and my mother-in-law ordered pork. And it was disgusting.

Our waiter Paco gave great service and made good food recommendations. The drinks are strong just like everywhere else in Vegas, and the double Margaritas were huge. Our waiter actually bought a round of shots for us and the table of cute girls next to us, telling them it was from us. Food had big portions and was delicious. I recommend the queso dip and the ribs. Would go here again!",

    "text": "When we saw this so close to our hotel we got very excited and couldn't wait to try it.  We were hoping for a memorable meal and some yummy tequila.  The place was mobbed when we arrived for lunch but we were able to sit at a high top inside right away.  We asked the waitress for some recommendations on which tequila to try first and (of course) she suggested the Cabo Wabo.  OK, we both got margeritas.   I inquired about gluten free and she brought me a gluten free menu which, to my surprise, was rather small considering a lot of mexican food is gluten free.  I ended up ordering the Shrimp Fajitas.  FAJITAS....as in comes with soft corn tortillas?  NOPE.  My meal came and no tortillas.  I asked and the waitress told that they had gluten in them.  Uh, ok.....shouldn't the menu state they DON'T come with them?  I mean, fajitas are fajitas.    Next order of business was to get some silverware so we could actually eat our meals.  We asked and then waited, and waited and waited.  I finally got up and took silverware off an empty table.  Hubby asked for some hot sauce, which was never delivered either.  Service sucked, flat out.  Our waitress acted as if we were an annoyance to her.  The food was mediocre at best and EXTREMELY overpriced.  I'm sorry Sammy.....I really had high hopes for this place but we will not be back.",

The smell was awful, the people were awful, the servers were awful. It felt like we were attending a \"dudes fart party\"  Why were we escorted to the bar? Why were we denied a table?

Its my opinion that doesn't matter when a party of 4 pays $130 for an easy to forget  lunch.  I have to correct myself,  it's very memorable, but only because of the cost.  Yes, 3 of the 4 got margaritas, but the entrees were not high quality and over garlicked.  The drinks were okay, not great.  Yes I understand Vegas is not dirt cheap, and I am perfectly willing to pay good money for good food.  If you are going to charge gourmet prices, please at least make above average food!  Great server, with a good attitude,  but the food and price dynamic didn't work for me.",

The location is prime, especially for those of us who love to people watch, and the staff is quick with a drink or pitcher refill. The food is good, though it doesn't blow me away - it is a chain, after all. The biggest draw to the CWC location is definitely just that - the location. Seating may get a bit tough if you come at a peak time, so be prepared to wait or walk elsewhere. I enjoyed the guac and the tacos, though the price didn't quite reflect the quality. If you're passing by and can catch a happy hour I would certainly recommend stopping by for an icy, salted beverage and some apps. Don't go out of your way though if you're looking for a place with some True authentic lip smacking mexican - Vegas has lots of it, but this isn't one of them.",

My husband and I were in L.V. this last week and stopped here for some drinks and lunch this past Tuesday afternoon around 1:30 or 2:00 and were seated immediately, we were asked where we wanted to sit indoors or patio, we opted for the patio as it was lively with good upbeat music and bright colorful scenery.   We were greeted by a friendly waiter and given ice water and asked if we would like some drinks to get started, we ordered shots and a beer and a margarita, the beer could have been a bit cooler, but otherwise it was good.  My husband had the fish tacos and I had the chicken taquitos and we shared the rice and beans from the taco platter. We did have to ask for chips and salsa and wish we had received them when we got our drinks, but otherwise food was great service was great and they had a photographer taking souvenir photos. He did not pester or pressure us and he took a great photo of us so we ended up purchasing one of the photos.   Would definietely return, the service, ambience and drinks were great for a fun and lively time on the strip. Great lunch spot with a great view, you can even see the fountains at the Bellagio so it was very nice.",

The nacho platter with carne asada is my go-to and perfect as a meal for two people, alongside some ice cold margaritas.   I always come to Vegas during the most crowded times of the year and have never had to wait to sit inside. There is usually a wait for outside seating, which overlooks the strip.",

Customer service was great and the food tasted amazing. If you like a place with good beans and rice( Mexican rice and pinto beans) then this place might be for you. The meat(carne Asada) was tender and flavorful. I wouldn't hesitate to go back and try more. My date at the time loved it too. The Margarita I had was what you would expect it to taste like. Enjoy!",

Here's what we ordered:  Fundido de quest con chorizo: it did not taste good at all.  You couldn't really taste the chorizo despite seeing it in there.  It tasted like curdled/cheap cheese.  Carne asada tacos: I took 2 bites and gave up.  The saltiest carne asada and it tasted like someone scraped it off the pans from last night.  2xTortilla Soup: the chicken was dry.  It was more of a thicker broth.   The waiter was great and he took the carne asada off the bill.   Don't waste your money.",

Can't miss the huge sign!  The outside patio is great. A mixture of tables and high tops and neat metal retro chairs. Large umbrellas keep the sun at bay but do t obstruct the people watching view of the strip. Chips and Salsa are a must for $3.95. mDelicious! I had the Crispy Beef Tacos with rice and my husband had the Fish and Chips. OMG the tacos were amazing in their house made corn shells with just the right amount of fillings. The fish and chips was A LOT OF FOOD!!!  Three pieces of fish and two of the best corn fritter style hush puppies I've ever tasted. Chips aka fries were plentiful! You will enjoy this place. Go have a drink and enjoy the great food!!!",

    "text": "I love some good Mexican food. For me, the more authentic, the better. However, when I know that I'm not stepping into one of those real Mexican spots that are peppered throughout the valley, I re-calibrate my expectations. That said, my brain and tastebuds were set for a good American influenced joint, a nice menu with depth in selection and good quality food to match the higher prices- common for the Strip. That's exactly what I got. I always see a lot of people on their patio, so I was excited to try Cabo Wabo Cantina for myself. The goal was to spend $100 because I had a gift certificate. The waitstaff was cordial and accommodating. Our waiter knew the menu very well and had no problem expounding on what was offered. I milled over the selections and finally ordered the sampler as an appetizer which gave us a selection of 4 or 5 items. It was tasty. Next was the main course. The portions were sizable and it was apparent that we wouldn't be able to finish. I barely made a dent in it! This could be partly due to the particularly weak Margaritas that we ordered in the interim. Although the drinks were the biggest disappointment, it was probably my saving grace because I had work the next day. I still would've liked the choice to be risky or not. For dessert, I ordered the brownie and vanilla ice cream to share. It did the trick in size but I did expect more from the brownie. Lastly, I reached and exceeded my initial spending goal and took advantage of the Yelp Check-In for a free margarita. The entrees we're extremely good and made for good leftovers to warm up the next morning! A-OK!",

    "text": "Horrible Experience-Sammy Should be ashamed of the quality and poor service and remove his name from this venture. One of my friends and I went to Vegas right before Thanksgiving. We took some cameras and a video camera with us to shoot during our trip.   \"The meat had marks on it from where the Jockey was hitting it\" (Rodney Dangerfield Quote from Caddyshack).   We stopped at Cabo Wabo because I'd been to the one in Cabo and this one has a nice patio overlooking the strip. We thought we could get some drinks, watch the people, and roll our camera a bit overlooking the strip. We sat on the Patio of this horrible restaurant for 15 minutes while 3-4 waiters walked by without even acknowledging us.   First person to visit us was the manager dressed in a hoodie and jeans with a radio earpiece in his ear like he was protecting the president or something. Really, this guy is in charge? He came over before asking us if we wanted a drink, welcome/greeting, etc. and started asking us questions about our cameras and scolding us that we cannot use them on the property. Only still pictures. I explained to him that we were there to spend money buy drinks and eat dinner and he was still very rude. I also told him that we had been there for 15 minutes without a greeting while his waitstaff walked by and that we were planning on eating there. He asked us more questions about our cameras then gave us a lecture about 9/11 and that one of the buildings on the strip next to them was threatened in 2001. In a city where most of the population are tourists with cell phones that have cameras and also carry leisure cameras he then accused us of \"Potentially Being Terrorists because we had cameras and were filming the site on the strip\". I explained to him that we were Americans from Texas. His reply was \"And Timothy Mcveigh was also an American\". This manager is beyond Douche-Bag at this point. We took still pics and we also used a camera that looked like a still pic camera and we still recorded video. He couldn't tell the difference even though he sat back 20 yards from us by the front door and watched us the entire time like we were criminals.  We were told NO video but we could take all of the still pics we wanted. Not sure how that will discourage terrorism.   Finally, our waiter \"Juan\" came by. And let me tell you \"Juan\" was NO SPEEDY GONZALEZ. Turtles and Snails were driving by this guy like the Indy 500 he was so slow. So we order some beers. Juan told us that their carbonation and water was bad and that the beer was flat. And yes, he was right, I had the worst dos equis beer ever and my friends beer was nasty too. Tasted like day old beer. It was warm and flat and tasted like two day old beer fermenting in a glass on a table and it was very flat, no bubbles. Worst beer I've had since I was in high school. Next I ordered a margarita and I tried to get a top shelf that was frozen. Juan explained to me that \"You don't drink frozen margaritas with top shelf liquor\". Really, I'm from Texas Biotch and if I want Herradura or something better in my margarita, I'll order it. I'm the customer. \"Have you ever heard of a TOP SHELF Margarita Biotch?\"  Besides I'm from Texas I drink Margaritas daily and I live in a place where we know our margaritas. I'll have to say, the margarita (that was not top shelf and just well liquor) was pretty crappy for a Mexican restaurant. I've had better margaritas in Wisconsin and Minnesota and those people don't know what the hell a margarita is. So we ordered some food .   \"the meat had marks on it from where the Jockey was hitting it\" (Rodney Dangerfield Quote from Caddyshack).   Really for $17 I could have gotten a better meal at Mcdonalds. The guy I was with ordered Nachos which were just a pile of cheese on chips not much for variety or flavor. They were flat and looked crappy too. Oh yeah, the manager followed my friend to the restroom and sat back about 20 yards from us to watch us the entire time. I guess he felt he was going to prevent a terror attack by stopping our filming of the Las Vegas strip. Typically I tip 20% or more but here I left him a 10% tip and even felt bad. So if you want low quality mexican food, watered down flat beers, and watered down \"well\" margaritas you should check out Cabo Wabo. The only positive about this place is that the view off the patio on the strip is cool and you can see the Bellagio fountains. I hope the health department prevents this factory of food poisoning to continue to serve food and sicken the world and the ultimate sin of messing up a great patio that could be much better if they actually had drinks that tasted good and couldn't mess up \"beer\" from a Keg. A few hours later we both got stomach aches from the food and felt very sick to our stomachs. We now know what happens to the horses at the track that don't make 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place. Tip for the day: Don't bet or order horse #5",

We ate outside on the patio. The water show at the Bellagio was going on through out our dining experience so that was pretty amazing! The Margaritas were pretty good. We love rock and roll music so had a great time of enjoying the moment. The service was pretty good, could have been a little better, but realistically, on a Saturday night in Vegas when the house seems to be rocking, we have eaten at much worse places! One thing we liked is that our waiter asked if it was our first time dining here. Because we said yes, he went over menu and we listened to his recommendations. The guacamole and Sampler were awesome.  When we left, the managers and hostesses said good bye(that is rare these days!). We will be back next month, or next big boys night out!!!!!",

    "text": "I ate here with my two brothers since it was opened  by one of the members of Van Halen.  I didn't bother to check Yelp because I assumed that all expensive restaurants on the Strip are equally good.  The bottom line here is that while the food is good, I'm not quite sure it's worth the price even with the Strip mark-up.  We split a margarita pitcher for $36, which was very tasty, although again I felt it was a little pricy.   The chips and salsa are AMAZING.  They're cut thicker than regular tortilla chips and fried perfectly.  The salsa has a wonderful tang.  You should definitely pass on the guacamole, as it doesn't have nearly enough lime or cilantro and is bland.  I got the chicken burrito enchilada-style, aka covered in cheese.  It was tasty if slightly bland.  I'd recommend it as one of the cheaper things on the menu at around $16.  My brother got the fish tacos, which he said were amazing but wasn't able to finish because he ate so many chips.  Service was good, not super attentive but not bad as others have mentioned.  I sat outside and it was thunderously loud but that's the strip for you.  The waitresses appeared to be having fun and dancing to the music.  Overall it was a nice ambience, overlooking the strip with a direct view of the Bellagio fountains.  Bottom line: I'd recommend this place for the food but for the price point you could probably find better or more interesting food of another genre elsewhere on the strip.",

There is always something entertaining going on on the strip so its the perfect place to be.  However the service here has never really been to par, I know they were busy and have to account for all parties but we only saw our waiter once for our drinks then never saw him again for over an hour just about, we had to track him down so that we could close out our bill. We would have ordered more drinks but did not get the opportunity to since we had reservations else where and did not have another hour to wait.  Besides that the drinks were excellent, the view was fantastic but definitely get more help during the busy times or at least check in more then just once an hour.",

Everything very good and tasty, quick friendly service from Stephani who worked the bar at the front.  The beef ribs in the burrito were savory and tender, the chicken wings fresh tasting and appropriately spicy, and the fries crisp.  Stephani brought two small tubs of tabasco and their chipotle salsa to go with the food.  Maybe a little expensive but then it's the Vegas strip.  I was inside Chipotle and was going to order there, but one look at the dried out chicken in the Chipotle bin led me instead to Cabo Wabo which turned out to be a much better choice.",

I'm pregnant so I had to skip the good alcohol beverages and stick with water, but my husband got a bloody Mary and loved it. He said it was thick with lots of flavor...not watery at all. We got chips and salsa (not free) and they were delicious. The salsa had a nice charred aftertaste. For food, I ordered the grilled fish tacos. I wasn't a huge fan of them, mainly because of the spicy aioli...it had a weird taste to it and the fish tasted like they weren't cooked all the way. Not quite frozen in the middle, but slightly cold..this place is good for breakfast and seems fine for some chips, guacamole and drinks.",

We got 2 pitchers of the mango marg and I tried the tortilla soup and carnitas platter ( why don't they shred the car it's for you????? It came in huge Chunks which did NOT look appetizing).

I also had the Cabo wabo fried taters...those were great!  That benedict was perfect. Loaded with hollandaise just like I like it.  Coffee was great.  Chocolate milk was good and cold.  My dad had the Cabo wabo style eggs benedict. It had shredded beef mixed with chorizo instead of ham.....I tried it, should've gotten it instead.  It was awesome!   I will be making this a regular stop from now on!!!",

    "text": "My first experience with Cabo Wabo was purchasing a 32 oz. frozen margarita of my choice.  WARNING may get a little intoxicated.  My family and I were trying to decide where to eat for dinner and the decision was made to dine at Cabo Wabo. They have two separate host stations, one for outside seating and one for inside seating. The patio was going to take about a half hour wait so we decided to dine indoors. The had us wait for a few minutes to get our table set up. Once we were sat, we were greeted by a very friendly server, I believe her name was Sarah. Sarah was helpful, patient, and kind. She offered us suggestions and was very attentive. Sarah is exceptional.  One of Sarah's suggestions for a beverage was the MARGARITA VERDE [Cabo Wabo tequila, lime, freshly minced cucumber & cilantro, served on the rocks]. We ordered a pitcher $44 which serves about four full glasses; delicious and refreshing! For my dinner, I decided on the GRILLED PORTABELLA MUSHROOM FAJITAS [fajitas vegetable, guacamole, pico do gallo, sour cream & flour tortillas] $25.95 (for one); I had it served over melted cheeses skillet add $3.00 and a side of rice. The food was flavorful and well presented. My only negative critique is, not enough tortillas; you only receive three but an additional two would be better but that's a personal preference.  The music was really loud. it was hard to converse with my family or listen to Sarah, our server. Over all, my experience was exceptional and I definitely recommend dining at Cabo Wabo the next time you're in Las Vegas!",

    "text": "I'll preface this review with, due to the horrible Customer service at the hostess stand, we did not even get to experience the food. Being a Vegas resident and someone that works in hospitality myself on the the strip I will never recommend this restaurant. My fiance and I were spending a weekend on the strip and walked over from Paris for Mexican food. We put our name on the waiting list and we're quoted 15 minutes. We walked around the area within a minute walk returned back to the hostess stand w/in 10 minutes to check in and were told our table had been called, we missed it and would have to start the wait again if we wanted to dine there. And we're told \"we needed to stay around once our name was on the list\" which we explained we were never told when we originally placed our name on the list. We were then quoted another 15 minutes for a table. Needless to say with the vast selection of restaurants on the strip we will never dine nor recommend any of our guests/family friends Cabo Wabo.",

    "text": "Our final Saturday evening meal in Las Vegas was supposed to be at Burgr, but the line wrapped around the casino. So we decided to go to Cabo Wabo. We were seated inside right away. Not very busy around 5pm. The waitress was nice and attentive. Our food and drinks came quickly.  I ordered the chicken quesadilla, which was quite possibly the best I've ever had. The tortilla was extremely thin and crisp. It came with the perfect portion of rice and beans. The side of guacamole and sauce went really well with it. I'd definitely come back. For 4 entrees and 2 drinks we paid about $25 each after we split the bill with tip. I think the prices are what's expected of Vegas, but of course over priced for the food you get especially the drinks. I paid $12 for a tall beer on tap.",

It really exceeded our expectations.   We started with the house margarita and they were delicious and strong. Probably better than any margarita I've had. I went with the shrimp tacos and they were really good, they also came with rice and beans. The whole meal was really filling. The pork tacos are also worth a mention if swine is your thing. If you're gonna try one thing, try the chimichangas. They were on the 'specials' menu that day and had beef and queso cheese, I'm craving these right now!   The service left a little to be desired and I wish that chips and salsa were complimentary (they are $3).   All in all I would definitely check this place out if you love tequila, Mexican, or Sammy Haggar. You also have a great view of the Bellagio fountains if you sit on the patio.",

Tried to enter through mall and girl told us indoor was closing -- that we had to eat outside and to go around the other way.  So we went the other way and the girls there were like, \"Inside or outside?\"  I should've just said in but blah blah'd out, \"Other girl said inside was closed.\"  After confused looks from two hostesses at outside entrance, they said, \"Well, I guess if she said so ...\" and they seated us outdoors.  I had fajitas.  Again, not very good compared to Tex Mex we have here in Houston.  Girlfiend had some shrimp deal (I think the ceviche app) and it was just OK, too.  What really rubbed me the wrong way was I went inside to go to the restroom about 15 minutes after we got there ... and I see the same hostess who told us we couldn't sit inside seating a party of five.  I asked her about it and she just gave me a dirty look.  Guy playing guitar and singing at least was decent.  And our waitress was nice enough ... though we didn't see her that often.",

    "text": "My friend and I went there Thursday night to grab a drink and some quick food. It was a little chilly outside and they said the indoors is closed therefore we sat outside. We were greeted by our server, Anthony. We probably had a terrible day because he was rude to us as soon as he came by. He started cursing saying 'why the f*** we need the heaters on' the minute it was on. As i mentioned above, it was cold outside and most of the tables had the heaters on. He looked extremely irritated and he had absolutely no manners. He got the order wrong, never even said he was sorry or how long it will take for the food to cone out. We had to ask for salt, ketchup and mayo from different persons because he never approached the table after he had dropped our drinks. The hostess and the food runner were extremely polite and friendly (I'm sorry i don't know their names). We travel a lot and go to Vegas often but unfortunately one server like this one could make me never go back to the same place. It's sad seeing unhappy customers just because one server has no manners and it's bad at doing his job. Both me and my friend work in restaurant industry and had never had such bad service.",

Restaurant is located outside of the Planet Hollywood Hotel and the Miracle Mile Shopping area, so it's the perfect spot for people watching and the views of the nearby hotels were great.  Our server had a few tables going, but made it a point to greet us right way to get in our drink orders (most important).  We didn't have to wait too long for your entree to arrive, all piping hot!  I had a chicken burrito, enchilada style and the others have the fish tacos, 3 huge tacos!  All very yummy!  OVERALL EXPERIENCE:  Fun atmosphere!  Food is tasty and plenty.  Would've liked to hear more of Sammy Haggar's music playing.  Priced moderately.  When in Cabo, Mexico, check out the restaurant there.  Good food, authentic.  The decor is awesome.  There is a hugh wrestling ring right in the center of the restaurant for Saturday nights Nacho Libre matches!  Now how cool is that!",

He had manages to get the run off from the beer all over the chips. Didn't notice it till we were like wonder why the wet!?! Gross! Food came about 45 minutes later, it was nasty... Dry, flavor-less, and my stomach was all messed up after this place. Wonder why...   Save your money, don't go here. Everything from the food to the service is a joke...",

The basic nachos were a bit on the expensive side $15.95 and we added pork to bump it up to $17.95.  I thought the nachos were tasty with plenty of jalapenos, cheese and cheese sauce, guacamole, sour cream, refried beans and plenty of carnitas.   A nice little touch when u check in and order an entree, you get a free house margarita with what else but Cabo Wabo tequila.   We had a fantastic waitress, Deanna, who took good care of us.",

    "text": "I would give this place no stars if I could.  This will go down as one of the worst dining/bar experiences I have ever had.  I like Sammy Hagar, I like patios and I like tequila, but there is nothing to like about this place.  Okay, maybe the patio for the simple fact that the people watching is great and it's a great location on the strip.    I love food and I'm not ashamed of the fact that I like to get my grub on.  So, for me to leave a restaurant and NOT EAT MY FOOD really says something.  That is exactly what happened at this establishment.  A server took our drink order.  Ten minutes later, we got our water and beer.  Then, over 25 minutes went by before he came back for our food order.  No exaggeration.  All of this could have been overlooked had the server been nice (he wasn't) and/or the food been good (it wasn't).  It took an hour for us to get our order of nachos and fish tacos.  I ordered nachos because I thought, \"how do you screw up nachos?\"  Well, Cabo Wabo has found a way.  The nachos consisted of about 12 individual tortilla chips and each chip had this meat cheese crustiness.  The overall effect was dog food.  My nachos looked like dog food.  They had a really weird taste too.  And the fish tacos looked better but tasted equally bad.  We literally got our check and left without eating our food.  And left a 10% tip due to the bad service, even though it killed me to do it.  I enjoy a good tourist spot.  They're overpriced and a little cheesy, but sometimes I dig it.  If you want a good tourist trap, visit Margaritaville.  I've never had bad food or bad service there and that place is incredibly busy.  Oh, Sammy.  Why????",

We could have easily shared a meal. My mom ordered the jack and coke ribs (it's a full slab, but they don't tell you!!!) and I ordered the portabello mushroom fajitas. Both entrees were good, but I favored my mom's jack and coke ribs. The ribs were tender and the flavor was phenomenal. The portabello fajitas were good as well. We did not think the prices were outrageous as others have claimed. It's the Las Vegas strip, unless you eat at McDonalds there are not really any \"cheap\" places to eat.  We did purchase a Groupon but would eat there again without one.",

I'm back in Vegas and wanted to grab some food on the strip. I specifically looked for this place... We found out, got seated, ordered our drinks and waited on our waiter to take our order. That's pretty much how the rest of the night went. Just a lot of waiting. I ordered the quesadilla plate. The quesadilla was great but the beans and rice were horrible. No flavor, very very bland and so was the guacamole. Margaritas were alright, overpriced but I guess because you're eating on the strip, you gotta pay for it. The waiter finally brings the check and we got fed up with waiting for him to come pick up the money, we walked it up to the register at the front. The hostess started calling our waiter and saw he was at a table with 2 other waitresses flirting. Smh, then she says \"sorry he's too busy flirting\". Never again..",

I am about to eat, WITH my husband now that is just disgusting! She was wearing half of a WHITE tank top, I could see her boobs completely except fro her nipple truly. It was just extremely unpleasant to begin with, at that moment we should have left, but we did not. A male hostess sat us, ignored me the whole time walked to the stable but had a full conversation with my husband, OK. We sat down, our waiter came by 5 minutes later, we asked for water and my husband ordered a Toasted Colada ($14), he said was ok. 75% ice. We also ordered our food, my husband got some Ceviche appetizer and I got Hot & Spicy Wings which I did not know came with a side of potato. The food was good, the service sucked. Besides taking our order, brining us our food, and our check we got NO SERVICE outside from that. Even if the food had been great, it was OK and the drink amazing, it was not. We would still never ever return to this place, and now when we return to Vegas we never will. The service was by far the worst I have ever gotten in Vegas. Super disappointed. The waiter had the audacity to circle the receipt what we should tip her. HAHA, seriously? My Tip was \"Check on your tables\". ! That's the BEST tip I am sure she has ever gotten. Recommend, NO Way! Go somewhere else!",

I ordered a calamari appetizer that I thought was good, but found lots of just fried pieces of nothing in my food as well LOL. The waitress was hard to get ahold of, but it was pretty busy so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.   They do however have some of the best salsa and chips I've tasted! We had to pay for them unlike other Mexican food establishments that offer them complementary, but it's vegas.   Save your time and go elsewhere, unless youre just getting chips",

We came here on a Wednesday night, so it wasn't as packed inside as it was outside on the balcony (facing the strip). The decor is awesome and the staff was great on this particular night.        Eric was our server, and he didn't waste anytime coming over to ask us what we would like for drinks. My friend and I ordered their bucket special which was any (5) Dos Equis or Heineken for $21. For food I ordered their delicious Baja style grilled fish (mahi-mahi) tacos. The fish tacos are not like the carne asada tacos as far as their size. The carne asada tacos are on a \"street taco\" sized tortilla while the fish tacos are on a regular sized tortilla. They are a mouth full and come with all the delicious fixings (cabbage, chipotle cream, and pico de gallo). Careful when you bite into them as they will drip onto the table, clothes, and eventually on the floor lol. I didn't notice it, until I was into my third and final taco.      Some of you might say we got great service because we came on a weekday when it was slow, but I've been to many places and got crappy service while not being busy. Besides, this is Las Vegas, there is never an off night.",

We sat outside by the bar that looked out over the street.  The sites were wonderful!  We watched people, street performers, the lights/water show at the Bellagio and enjoyed the music - LOUD speaker overhead but we dealt.  The drinks were a bit overpriced so we went with the bottled beer.  I ordered a burrito and my hubby ordered the carne asada tacos.  The salsa was too spicy for him so we requested the mild which was still a little too spicy.  The meat was tough and cut into small pieces that looked like dog food.  The food was overpriced as well. The burrito was a good size but filled with rice and more rice.  Hardly any meat and the tiny little side of guacamole that I ordered was in a small ramekin half filled and $3!!!  We were disappointed in the food and the SERVICE WAS SO SLOW!!!!  She forgot about us half the time!  I wouldn't recommend this place -there are SO MANY places to eat - go someplace else!",

No idea how much it cost until I was ready to order. The wait person was friendly and even offered me a sample of the flavor before ordering. I got the smallest (21 oz) in a plastic cup $15. Ouch. Hubs got the larger since in a tall wormy looking cup (I think 32oz) for $18 and added an extra shot people for I think $6. Both drinks were $43 after I added tip. WTF right?! It better be damn good. It tasted pretty good. Couldn't taste alcohol which was fine since I'm a light weight. I am done with this thing and I didn't feel a damn thing. I'm Asian and I turn red with alcohol. I wasn't even pink, didn't feel anything so there was no alcohol in it. My hubs got an extra shot and nothing. Don't buy the hype people we are getting robbed here! If you're going to charge and arm and a leg at least have some alcohol in it! Seriously I felt nothing and I get a buzz off a 1/2 beer. So infuriating & angry. Don't get hosed like we did.

We could walk to it from our hotel since it was on the main strip. Not to busy when we went - but even if it was the space is large! Upstairs for private parties, open main dining area and an outside patio that overlooks the strip. Go on a night when the have live music. Good vibes and good eats. Looking forward to going back!!!",

The sampler included chorizo, chicken (good southwestern style rub on it), steak with a chimichurri sauce, and BBQ ribs (which were awesome).  The Mexican style rice and ranch pinto beans were very good.  I also had the drink special, the Pomegranate Mojito (delicious).  My husband had a beer.  The service was friendly and good.

We had a perfect view of the strip shenanigans happening below us as well as the Bellagio fountains across the street.   Good Mexican/American food. I had the beef tacos with a dusting of cojita cheese on top, I was pleasantly surprised at how good they were. Their Mexican street corn is not elotes but rather corn on the cob unless you want to spend an extra $5 which seems ridiculous and misleading given its name on the menu. The mai tais were really good.   After eating at a few high end restaurants, we found this casual, fun place to be our favorite of the trip.",

The Bellagio dancing waters are quite the site to see, however, the best part was the shade!  When the temp remains 90+ overnight the last thing you need is the desert sun cooking you for lunch.   Bloody Mary was mild in spice, had a nice balance of acidity, cold, and refreshing.  The hollandaise served with the classic Eggs Benedict needed a good hit of citrus to not taste like a bland blanket of butter draped over the poached egg. That said, their home fries had a crisp exterior and smooth interior which hit the spot.   Great place with decent Vegas prices in a great location.",

If you sit outside on the deck, you'll have a great people watching experience, and the food is pretty good too. Not the best, I would have changed a few things, namely the glum sauce that while wasn't bad, was also, well \"glum\".  Great service, and that matters. Lively action and we got to see the police run down a perp after a fight on the strip. I guess he didn't know they are right across the street :).  Crowded for sure, and sometimes there is a wait. Drinks were \"on point\".",

    "text": "This is one of those places that I'm on the fence about. The food was good and well cooked but I just don't think it was worth the substantially high prices.   There is A LOT of good food on and around the strip. A LOT! I hadn't been to a Cabo Wabo in the states so when I heard there was on in Vegas we decided to make it our dinner destination.   We were seated quickly outside on the patio and our server came over within just a few minutes. We ordered drinks and water since it was still in the upper 90s outside. Once we ordered our food we suddenly noticed that the inside of the restaurant was nearly empty! If we had known we could have comfortably sat inside, in the AC, to enjoy our dinner we'd definitely have taken that. Since our food and drinks were ordered we decided to wait. We were told there may be some confusion to move.   Our drinks arrived shortly and were very good. We ordered an IPA and a blended blood orange margarita. We then received our tortilla soups. The flavor was good but the soup was barely lukewarm. We love tortilla soup and getting it served cool is disappointing. We waited a bit for our chicken and steak fajitas to arrive. Our server was very friendly and checked in with us a few times to let us know they would be out soon.   On a side note, chips and salsa weren't ever served to us so it's either not included with dinner or we were just never offered any.   The fajitas finally arrived and they looked and smelled great. The meats were nicely cooked and seasoned. Great fajita meat! To get rice and beans with it is an additional $4 charge. They come with a small side dish of guacamole, sour cream, pico and cheese. The tortillas weren't very good flour tortillas but they did the job. I have to admit, the quality of the tortillas does make a big difference in the overall quality of the fajitas. I ended up ditching my last tortilla and just eating the chicken and onions off my plate.   Everything here is on the pricey side of the scale. For the 2 of us having the fajitas, with 2 alcohol drinks, small soups cups, and tip, it was approx. $125. I wouldn't recommend this place to friends coming into town. I think there are Mexican spots that are just as good, if not better, on/near the strip, for a whole lot less and you'd get more. You'll definitely pay for the name on the building more than the food itself.",

We had a large party of about 20 people to celebrate a 21st birthday and my table specifically was helped by Evina who was so welcoming and radiated such joy and enthusiasm to our group! Thank you Evina!   We ordered a good mix of food and drinks! The calamari was delicious; it was perfectly crispy and savory. The carne asada on the tacos was very flavorful and cooked well. The beans and rice complimented each other and did not overpower the main dish. The cocorita was a little too strong and not blended well, even after mixing so we probably will not get that again. However, the strawberry margarita and peach margarita were delicious and are a must try! The ambience of the restaurant was great and our birthday girl even got a strawberry vodka drink thanks to the house!   Overall, this is a great place to celebrate any occasion, large groups, or just to have fun and leave with a happy stomach! Thank you again Evina!",

I ordered the shrimp tacos, which are breaded/fried and come on some sort of cabbage slaw filling with sauce and thin chip crunchies on top. The dish comes with 3 good sized, filled-to-the-brim tacos, and a side of Mexican rice & beans.  The shrimp was really tasty and I loved the tortillas, but the crunchies were a bit much (not sure what they were so I'll be calling them crunchies) and there was way too much cabbage for my liking (took away from the flavor). The beans & rice were mediocre, but still tasty enough.  Our table seemed happy with the tacos, salad, quesadillas, and nacho platter ordered.   The price was a bit steep (around $20 per taco plate, $20 quesadillas, etc), but it's right on the Vegas Strip so it's not surprising...and you do get a large portion.",

Kevin L was our server and he was one of the best we encountered anywhere in Vegas on this trip.  At first the experience began like any other - he took our order for drinks and then our meals.  We ordered two 24oz Mai Tais ($24 ea - ouch!) but they were very good.    I ordered the Carne Asada tacos and my wife ordered the shredded beef tacos.  Both meals were excellent!  I would definitely order either meal again.  Before we could finish eating and drinking our friend's were getting tired from day drinking since before noon and were starting to head out.  Before we knew it, just my wife and I were left at our 10-person table near the entrance from the strip.  Kevin was chatting with us and somehow my status as a recent military retiree came up.  Kevin was super appreciative of my military service and went above and beyond to ensure we had a great experience.  He even noticed that our (now empty) 24 oz drinks included the souvenir glasses and gave us four of them brand new in boxes after seeing two others empty on the table ordered earlier by our friends.   The food, drinks, and service were all first class.  I will make a point to return during our next Vegas trip.  Our total bill was $89 including two $24 drinks, which is a little pricey but worth it for the service and experience right on the strip.",

    "text": "We came here for a late lunch on a Sunday, perhaps around 2:30 in the afternoon.  The place wasn't as crowded as it apparently had been during the normal lunch hour as the wait staff informed us.  I asked for a quieter table in a corner somewhere and we were given the table next to the kitchen which was further away from the bulk of the other diners.  Two of us shared the chicken fajitas and a coconut mixed drink.  The drink was tasty and not wimpy.  It had toasted shaved coconut on the rim of the glass which was nice.  The fajitas were shared between two people and with a side of rice and beans provided enough food for two.    Pros: lots of chips; friendly waitress, tender chicken Cons: no onions in the fajitas (huh?!), had to ask for water refills, service was slow bringing extra plates, loud background music.  On the subject of the background music, when we came in the music was loud but not so loud as to prevent conversation.  We saw the head waiter/boss/manager-guy turn the music up to something that was too loud, and then at one point he turned it up even louder so that some waitress girls could dance on the bar top for (presumably) the entertainment of the diners.  The music unfortunately didn't make a descent down from the jet-engine level it had been set at for the amusement.  We saw one lady with her elderly mother get up, speak to the manager guy while gesticulating wildly, and then march out.  We couldn't hear anything of what they said because the music was too loud, but presumably they weren't pleased at the conversation-stopping level either.    The location is convenient but if my memory serves me there is another cantina place in the same mall where one could go to eat and  communicate with fellow diners.",

Perfect since my husband loves to people watch. First, we ordered a margarita. I asked her if there were any drinks they were special for and she said everything so I got strawberry. Probably the worst margarita I've had lately. Then, we ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer. Again, awful. The chips were really hard and tasted stale. We got some type of quesadilla that was pretty good. Overall the service and food was pretty decent. I'm a pretty harsh critic. I would have given 3 stars but it was getting cold and we asked for the bill and she said she would be right back for the groupon. It took about 5 minutes for her return. She finally took my phone and disappeared for another 10 minutes. She didn't give me a book with my receipt so there was nowhere to put my money. So this place was ok, but I definitely will not be going there again. But if you have a groupon, it's worth it if you don't feel like traveling far and you're in that area.",

I think Cabo Wabo is more for the American taco lover. I had the chicken & carnitas fajitas, & they were good. The server was also good.  I was not disappointed. If you want a big bowl of cheese dip & a boisterous atmosphere, go here. If you want a glass of wine & a Porterhouse, keep on looking.",

On a recent Vegas trip, my fiance and i decided not to go too crazy blowing our money at clubs so we sat on the outdoor patio overlooking Vegas Blvd instead ordering the half-yard margarita, beer, and some appetizers. the half-yard marg was on the rocks and was strong. I had a pint of Dos Equis Lager. We ordered the chicken strips and fries. Within 15 mins, i had a terrible stomach ache and ran to the bathroom to puke. It could have been something in the food or alcohol. But its one incident and it could have happened to anyone.  Why the 2 stars? I asked for another beer and it never came...but it was noted on our final bill. The half-yard came out to be $36!! when you order the same drink at the walk-through counter inside the mall, its only $17!! I tried arguing with the server but was so sick and nauseous that i couldnt. She did remove the extra beer charge and the bill was still $60!!   i would not come back to this place to eat or drink. I would come back to watch all the drunk people attempt to walk up/down the stairs!",

So I decided to pop into the location on the Strip.  The location and atmosphere were great.  You can sit outside and overlook the Bellagio fountains and enjoy some great people-watching.  However the food was terrible, nothing at all like the Cabo Wabo in Mexico.  I was really hoping for at least something similar, but it was some of the worst Mexican food I've ever had. The menu was completely different too, and the only similarity was the name on the sign.  So, if you're going for a drink and simple appetizer, you will love the atmosphere.  However if you're expecting a good meal, you should eat somewhere else then come here for drinks.",

    "text": "A rating on Yelp is just an average, and after 300 plus reviews I think 2&1/2 stars is a little harsh.  After Yelp filters some reviews its up to us to decipher  the reviews that are left.  I've noticed several bad reviews recently for Cabo Wabo's & I must say I am surprised.    We arrived on a Thursday night & knew we would probably have to kill some time drinking while we waited for a seat, tough life I know.  We were pleasantly surprised when we were sat immediately at the outdoor bar over looking the strip with a clear view of the fountains shooting off across the street @ Bellagio.  When the wind blew just right we could feel  the mist from the fountains, which felt so good in the dry Vegas heat.  Cabo Wabo's was crazy packed but the bar back grabbed us some menus & took initiative getting us our first round of drinks (frozen margaritas & red bull vodkas) while we waited for our server to machete her way threw the weeds she was knee deep in.  It was a gorgeous night to catch up with my Pops & his wife who live here in Las Vegas & we could not have had a better time.     I can't stress enough how if you go into a restaurant with a chip on your shoulder anticipating bad service your gonna have a shitty experience.  You live in and or you are visiting a great city to party and have fun.   Raise your glass, have a drink, do a shot.... and chill out!  I thought the the food came out in a reasonable time and had no complaints with my service.   The guacamole & chips were money, the chicken chimichangas were as good as it gets (especially after kicking back several margaritas).   I thought my fish tacos with beans & rice were the bomb & devoured every bite.   I was so happy I got my dad to to eat some Mexican fare that night it could not have gotten any better.  This was one bill I had no problem picking up & we will be back on our next visit to Las Vegas.  I know the reviews are mixed but I would roll the dice & check it out!",

    "text": "I'm from LA, so I know good Mexican food when I taste it... and this isn't it. Is it horrible? No, but nothing remarkable that's for sure. And the service? Horrible.   Let's start from the beginning. Our party of four was crammed at a tiny table with tons of foot traffic. Some girl came over to take our order... not sure who she was, as she made it a point to tell us she was NOT our server but was going to be taking our order. Clearly she wasn't happy at being told to help out our actual server, as she was rude, surly, uninterested and completely unhelpful.   When ordering, I said to her, \"How are the short rib enchiladas?\" I got a blank stare and she replied, \"they're good\" in such a way that I began to question my order and said, \"I'm not hearing any enthusiasm... should I order something else?\" She robotically replied with a sigh and said that she's never had them, but they are popular there. Um ok.   Then, my friend who is a vegetarian, was told by the people at the front that almost everything on the menu could be modified into a vegetarian dish. (I mean, it's really not that difficult. Take any freaking dish and omit the meat and voila!) Rude girl taking our order: \"WHO told you that?!!\" and rolled her eyes and put her hands defiantly on her hips. Then she added, \"The ONLY vegetarian options are a cheese quesadilla or a salad!\" After being told what was said at the front, my friend asked if she could order cheese enchiladas with avocado and was told \"Oh, I guess you could do that.\" When our food came, no cheese enchiladas... but instead, a cheese quesadilla. ((SIGH)). The food runner was just as rude. My friend made the comment that it wasn't what she ordered but she'd eat it anyway. The runner insisted on getting the enchiladas as she barked, \"BECAUSE WE WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY!\" Lol.  And during the long period of time we were waiting for our food, I flagged down a server and asked for some chips and salsa. And as if this place didn't suck already, I was told they CHARGE for chips and salsa! What?!! Come again?? Never, ever in my life have I been to a Mexican restaurant (and I've been in a LOT in my time) and been charged for chips and salsa. I mean, I know we are in the price gouging capital of the world, Las Vegas, where dumb tourists will fork out any kind of money not knowing any better, but it will be a cold day in hell before I pay $5 bucks for chips and salsa. One week later, I'm still shaking my head as I write this.  Other than that, we never saw our server again... never checked on us, refilled water, nothing. The food was unremarkable. Average, at best. The mango picante margarita was pretty decent... took forever to arrive but tasted good. I was about 85% thru my meal when someone over my shoulder tried to take my plate away (wtf). And then for the remainder of our meal, there was a staff member table stalking us to fill our table the second we stood up, which was uncomfortable and we felt rushed (even though the service on their end was slow).   Summary: Disappointed.",

The drinks area bit pricey, however, they did deliver on flavor and size.  The Queso Fundida was cheesy and a good portion for an appetizer.  The jalapeno line chicken was large enough for two, and not SO spices that it was inedible.  Plenty of Sammy memorabilia and a great waitstaff make this a sure bet on the Vegas strip (sorry, couldn't avoid the pun!)",

Big, loud, Vegas.    * Service - Outstanding   Alexis was really good!  She was personable and attentive and showed up at all the right times.  Someone who came to clear the table accidentally knocked a glass of ice water in one of my party's plate.  He promptly apologized and sent a manager.  Without question the manager removed the entree from the bill and offered an alternative.  (To go even!)  The leadership definitely emphasizes service.  Bravo!  * Food Quantity / Quality / Presentation - Discouraging  Keep your expectations LOW - it's CABO WABO.  I mean, any place that has MEXIYAKI on the menu had to be appetizer and beer fare.  It was.    The $32 New York strip I ordered was smothered in dark sauce to hide the poor quality, and was way past med rare, and tough as can be.    It was good party food, not a dining experience - (keep your expectations low!)  * What I'll remember  Alexis genuinely cared!  What I can't wait to forget  The gristle I had to cut out from my $32 New York strip.",

I ordered the green veggie burrito and my husband ordered the Asada tacos. He was very happy with his tacos but wished there was a larger portion. What he got was only fit for an appetizer! Our bill came out to be a bit pricier than we anticipated but I am sure that it being in the strip in a Vegas is going to drive up the cost. Service was good and the music was entertaining so we can't complain much!",

Cabo Wabo was a fun environment for our large party but the pricing was so expensive. My $16 plate of fajitas did not come with rice and beans (added rice for 1.50).

The short rib enchiladas was ok, the meat was good but the tortillas were so tough a knife wouldn't cut it.  Thank goodness I played the slots and this meal was paid by the winnings.  I guess it was better then losing the 40. at the slots.  But I may have more fun playing the slots then I had eating the food.  Once was more then enough.",

The chicken in the fajitas was very dry but still the fajitas were tasty enough.   The day we went, the place was maybe 1/3 full. We were seated after waiting 4-5 minutes while the hostess made small talk with some ladies who weren't sure if they wanted to eat there. Meanwhile another hostess/employee stared into the abyss twirling her hair.  Once we were seated, we were told that our server would be with us soon. After 10-15 minutes of no server, we got up and sat at the bar because we were really hungry.  The bartender was very friendly but clearly new. She took our order and after a half hour, the food had not arrived. After about 35-40 minutes, the food arrived. Again, the place was in no way busy.  As we left, we saw a couple sitting at what was originally our table and I overheard them telling a waiter which they flagged down that they had been waiting for 15 minutes and not seen a server.",

Just a fun escape, feels like you're lounging at some beach cantina - you forget you're in Vegas. Good music and overall feel.  (Tip - if you sit outside, ask for a table in the shade - it's well-worth the longer wait. If you're in the direct sun, like we were, you'll roast and sweat if you don't ask and once you lock into your seat, it's tough to move because apparently those seats in the shade are locked up by those waiting in line. We eventually got to move though (since they realized we were in for the long haul that afternoon, haha... many, many drinks.)   PS - Swear this is True but that night after Cabo I had a dream like Point Break where I was in charge of finding the head of a surfer crew who was robbing banks, lead by Sammy Hagar. I found them surfing at a cove in Mexico, chased him up a mountain side to the edge of a cliff where he jumped, turned in the air, flipped me off while smiling, pulled a ripcord and base jumped. He cut the cord in the air, tucked and rolled, yelled and took off in an awaiting jeep.  Um... yeah. That dream was probably because of the combo of Sammy' music, too much sun and too many drinks, haha.",

I'm accustomed to the concept of overpriced food on the Strip, so I couldn't totally fault this place for being any different in that respect.  The chips and salsa were great, and they were promptly delivered.  We ordered two combo plates, a Corona, and a house margarita.  The food was good: not spectacular, not horrible...just good.  We ordered the churros afterwards, and again, just good.  They had nice flavor, but were a bit on the overcooked side.  When the waitress finally brought the check around, though, we were appalled to see that a standard sized bottle of Corona was $9 and the small plastic cup of house margarita was $11!  Seriously?  The larger \"specialty\" margaritas that the table next to us ordered were only a couple dollars more and looked to be at least twice the size!  I was glad that we declined the refills she offered.  Overall, I wouldn't go back or recommend to friends.  The service was slow (with the exception of the free chips and salsa), and our server was inattentive bordering on rude.  The food was average for the most part.  Drinks were average and overpriced, even by Vegas standards.",

Back to my tacos. If you can't even properly warm up a tortilla you shouldn't even bother working at a restaurant. The worst place I ever dined out was a place here in Chicago that I really thought was unbeatable. Until I met Cabo Wabo. Food is just brutal. I was waiting on Gordon Ramsey to walk out the kitchen.

First off, our waitress was a bitch. I'm sure she's not always like that (I understand sometimes people have an off day)  but her service was just horrible. I ordered the nachos, they were nachos, lots of cheese, sour cream, guacamole, tomatoes, a bunch of little hairs, and onions. Yes, I said hairs...not only one but a bunch. DISGUSTING! I quickly called over our waitress and asked if I could speak to her manager. (With attitude) she asked me what was wrong and I pointed out the hair to her. When the manager came up to me he seemed shocked that there was hair and repeatedly told me that all his cooks are in hair nets and properly groomed. He then offered me a free drink and asked if I wanted another order of nachos. I said no thank you to the food but I'll take the drink. (The margaritas are gross btw) then as my friends continued to eat their food, my friend finds a hair in her tacos. YES MORE HAIR....by now we're disgusted and just want to leave this place. We will never come back here!",

Sat outside had the NACHOS (in CAPS you will see why later) and some drinks.  The hostesses were absolutely horrible and rude but to top the entire experience off six of us got the worst case of food poisoning EVER!!!!  We were at urgent care the next day for IV fluids and sick for the rest of the trip could not go out of the hotel room.  Needless to say they ruined our trip and the meal turned out to cost us our entire trip and much more.  We will never eat there again.",

Great margaritas too. Good Service. Really nice patio with great people watching. Can't wait to go back. Counting down.

I am really picky about my alcoholic beverages, and I have to say that the pineapple mango mojito was THE BEST mojito I have ever had. My sister enjoyed her beers, and we were both crazy about the complementary chips and salsa. The salsa was just incredible, just a little different from the norm, and thoroughly enjoyable.  The atmosphere was nice, as we had a nice sunny spot at the edge of the restaurant, outside, with a view. A great spot to relax and people-watch.  UPDATE: I changed my review from 5 stars to 3 after trying their food. Nothing terrible, but I would not eat there again. We also ate inside this time, which was a little tacky. In the future, I would come again only for drinks, and to sit outside and people watch.",

We were typical sightseers and as we were walking down the Strip, we saw the inviting patio of Cabo Wabo and thought that would be a great place to eat lunch. We had a short 5-10 minute wait (extremely great in Vegas) before we were seated under a huge red umbrella by a very friendly staff. Our waitress, Tammy, was the best! She was extremely friendly, helpful, and she did a great job of giving us ideas of what would be good to eat and drink. She was totally on target with the Cabo Rockin' Iced Tea - it may have been the most refreshing drink I've EVER had. She continued to give us ideas of what to order and we probably stayed there and ate and drank longer than we would have because she made our visit so pleasant. Our food was great, service wonderful, fantastic experience. We all highly recommend this place as one of your stops in Vegas!",

    "text": "So I ventured out alone on the strip for breakfast and I decided I was going to give Cabo Wabo a try. I did not regret it at all. I sat on the bar stools facing the strip. It was a very nice view. I ordered the Cocorita and made it a double. It was delicious!!! For breakfast I ordered the breakfast sandwich. It came with eggs, ham, bacon, lettuce, tomato, on a soft bread and with potatoes. I didn't expect it to be so huge! Despite the fact that it was a big meal, it was so good that I devoured it. Best part was, since I was facing the overlook to the strip, I got to see two ladies undress and paint their bodies in preparation for their \"show\". It was absolutely hilarious watching people's reactions as they walked by and saw two girls painting each other in red white and blue with their goodies out. I decided \"well, this is fun\" and ordered another drink. This time it was the \"can't drive 55\" and I didn't make this one a double because the Cocorita had me tipsy. I noticed that now two men joined the girls. Now this was entertainment. People either loved it or hated them lol. So, the food was delicious. The drinks were strong and the \"views\" were out of this world. My server was the kindest lady ever. I recommend this place and make sure you get a seat that overlooks the strip!!!'",

    "text": "Ambiance:  Definite Cabo feel.  I sat indoors at the bar, but think sitting outdoors would be a fun feel in Vegas.  Food/Drink:  Had nachos, a couple specialty cocktails, and a fried ice cream.  The nachos were plentiful with a nice blend of toppings.  I didn't necessarily love all the cheeses in their blend, but it was good.  They sprinkle on cojita cheese which should be mandatory for all nachos.   I had a alcoholic version of an Arnold Palmer which had fresh mint, which was refreshing, along with a new berry based drink which was also great.  The topper was the fried ice cream.  They put a coat of frosted flakes on it, and it was easily one of the best desserts I ever had.  Service:  The waitresses/bartenders were friendly, and on top of everything.   Being the strip you would hope app servers had this down.  Price:  Slightly pricey.  You do pay for the location and name recognition, but certainly not exorbitantly priced.  Overall:  Great experience, excellent drinks, solid service, good food.  Next time I am staying in the area or with a group of buddies I will stop by.",

We were able to get some drinks and sit at the bar while we waited for our table, but it still took foreeeverrrr. The frozen margarita I got was a little too sweet and gave me a headache so I barely drank half of it :( As for food, I got the carne asada tacos which comes with 3 tacos and rice and beans. The carne asada was sooooo salty and the beans were not good. Definitely not worth the ~$15 cost. I would rather have Del Taco!",

We dropped by here the first night of our Vegas trip to grab some drinks. We were mainly here to try their drinks but I was hungry so I also ordered some guacamole. The guac was really good and came with in a decent portion. It cost around $9 and there was enough to share with the group.  We only ordered one drink here, the cocorita, and it was delicious! The drink itself was pretty good, but the honey coated coconut crusted onto the rim of the glass was the best part. It was so good, the drink is definitely worth getting just for that coconut crust.  We also tried some of the drinks and snacks that the rest of our table ordered. The Salsa was a good price for a pretty generous portion. It had a little bit of a Chipotle flavor in it which I wasn't that into. The rest of the drinks were all just ok, I don't think I tried enough of them to know if I liked or disliked them.",

    "text": "I don't know. Years ago I noticed that Cabo Wabo has a lighthouse as part of the exterior decorations. Back when I was single I actually owned and decorated my apartment with nick-nacks of lighthouses. I am married now, with kids, and yes a resident of Las Vegas. Lighthouses, actual and my have become extinct.  Here Cabo Wabo, the food was good. For an appetizer we ordered some good old fashioned chips and salsa, which were fine, although a few of our chips were stale. I ate fajitas (steak and chicken combo) and they were fine. The tortillas, three of them, were served wrapped in paper. two of the three tortillas needed to be peeled apart. I don't know, that just didn't seem right to me. My wife ordered a burrito and says it tasted fine.   She also ordered a side of guacamole which cost $9.00. I ordered some french fries which cost $5.00. Seems to me these two side orders should have cost the same. I don't know, maybe that's just me.   Seating, I don't know, I like having some elbowroom myself. But it's non-existant here. Tables are very close together. I noticed severs having to \"squeeze it in\" more than once while walking between tables. If there were an emergency situation. Or something loud like a car backfiring near-by, this crowded patio could become a problem.  When we arrived at Cabo Wabo we were inside The Miracle Mile shops. So we stopped at the host stand inside. We were told to go outside to the outside host stand. Now, I don't know, maybe it's just me, but if I were the host I would have said something to the effect of \"We have a host stand just outside as well, follow me, let me take you there.\" I don't know just sounds a little more professional to me.  As the wife and I were departing, we passed by the Lighthouse to go inside and return to the Miracle Mile Shops. My wife mentioned that the inside of the place was quite empty (it was about 1:00pm) and was surprised the hostess didn't just seat us or walk us through like earlier mentioned. I don't know. I really want to like Cabo Wabo. My wife really enjoyed the experience. I'll wait to read her review and maybe rethink the whole persoal experience.",

Would come back to see them, but won't be ordering anything.   What's sad is that it's a prime location with lots of potential. If they weren't so greedy with their prices, they would actually make more, because this place would be packed with locals. Parking is good, walking through the mall isn't too bad, and the service is pretty good.",

Nothing special and the pork was super dry, but definitely edible.  Luckily, I had a delicious cactus pear margarita to help me choke down the dry carnitas.  You have to pay for chips, but they give you a gigantic basket of it.  The service was surprisingly good for a busy restaurant.  All in all, not a bad experience, but definitely nothing to go out of your way for.  For the price, there are better options in Vegas, but if you have a hankering for Mexican food and margaritas, Cabo Wabo will hit the spot just fine.",

Possibly the friendliest/funnest servers I met all of vegas.   The Bad: Food is mediocre. I ordered a burrito hoping to get a huge cheesy burrito filled with sauces and rice and meat. Instead I got served what's more of a \"chicken wrap\". All it had was chicken and some lettuce inside. Not exactly the calorie bomb I was hoping for.  And at no surprise considering its on the vegas strip, it's pricey! Table of six, we all had an entree and 3 pitchers of margaritas. Came out to like $275",

Shout out to Danny for being a great server and fixing our order after I had made a mistake! Extra shout out to the hostess who when being asked, \"What's the difference between here and Las Salsas?\" said, \"This place is better and Las Salsas kind of sucks.\" (We walked by there on the way out and are very thankful for your advice!)  These are all things that should have at least guaranteed 4 stars, however, the margaritas were incredibly weak. I'm a light weight and did not feel anything! When paying $42 for a pitcher, I shouldn't be able to taste the sweet n sour mix over the tequila!",

Your going to get some good service and that your going to eat some good food.. Its Vegas Right? Wrong!!!!!! Cabo Wabo is a Mexican Cantina right on the strip next to the Planet Hollywood. I went in there to grab some dinner and have few beers on my way to do a little gambling.. The place overlooks the strip so I thought it would be fun to sit outside and watch the action from the overlook. The bar was only about 60% full so I felt lucky to have beat the dinner rush. What Rush? you ask.. Exactly.... there was no rushing anywhere. The waiter took 20 minutes to acknowledge me. When he finally did I ordered a beer and the Cadillac nachos.. I sat there for another 10 minutes before the guy brought back the beer. He apologized for the wait and said he was just busy, but the truth is the whole bar was not busy and I watched him talking to other people doing whatever... and it was him that was not busy at all.. That by itself would not be enough to piss me off, but I waited another 25 minutes for the nachos and when they arrived they were the most pathetic greasy and poorly executed terribleness I have ever seen.. They were some kind of stuffed tortilla concoction with a dollop of sour cream and some guacamole. A real disappointing dish.. To make it worse I was out of beer. I tried a couple of the nachos but they were so shitty I just decided to cut my losses and leave. I paid the bill, $21.62 by the way for shit nachos and a beer and left.. If it was not bad enough that the food sucked and the service sucked. I had to endure an hour and a half of Sammy Hagar music.. For a Vegas strip venue this place does NOT Rock in any way shape or form. Cabo Wabo is a just skip it and go on to Hard Rock Cafe for me..",

Then we go on and I asked for a green salsa and his reply was \"you can have whatever you want\" not to mention he was going to tag me with additional $9.00 for Guacamole dip, well I asked for green Salsa not a dip. We go on without any complaints as we all felt the situation was weird. The food comes in, I ordered the fish of the day, Scottish Salmon, good plate presentation until the plate tasted like all SALT, went on and tried to eat as we were all starving, it got to the point where I could not continue.

We had a couple of the special Caborita's - really tasty on a hot day - and we didn't get suckered into paying for some cheap ass souvenir glass with this one (unlike another spot on the strip recently reviewed by me).  We tried the Nacho's with the Carne Asada - HUGE order of Nachos, but we were starving and eat every bite - hold the jalapenos for me, but everything else on that plate was really great.  For lunch, I had the Carne Asada taco plate - with rice and beans - after the gigantic nachos, I could only eat the tacos and did a tasting of the rice and beans - everything was really good and some points for a nice presentation.  No waiting, service was quick and our waiter was always one step ahead of us with water refills and checking on us during a busy Memorial Day weekend visit.  I'd go here again and try more things on the menu.  Cool Millenials with those fake cigarettes that only blow vapor where everywhere - so you know it must be hip! LOL",

I was surprisingly disappointed, especially expecting one of the best to be on the Las Vegas strip.  The staff was friendly but service a little slow which was surprising, the visit was at 1am when only the bar area was open.  The appetizer sampler was alright, but at $24 nothing special, just the usual items.  I would not have been able to tell the difference between it and your usual rinky dinky Mexican restaurants back home.  Now the real reason I went was for Sammy's Cabo Wabo tequila, I ordered one on the rocks ($14).  Who knows if they used the real stuff, but it tasted like cheap tequila, or was extremely watered down already.  My other half had a house frozen margarita ($10), and I swear there wasn't a drop of alcohol in it, just mix and ice.  Total bill for 2 drinks and appetizer with tax, tip and some CNF charge(?)= $60.  So disappointed in Sammy, wish he would make sure the quality stays competitive.",

Come on ppl, you're on the strip, drinks will be expensive and if you bought bad groupons, it's your fault for not reading the find print lol Anyways...this was our last stop before heading home. Had a drink to sober up ;) Cadillac margarita, strong enough to even us out! We got sat right away, party of 8. Our server was super cool and friendly. Even after a table walked out in her and left her with a $90 check. SO messed up. But who wouldn't be bummed after that? So it didn't matter to us. She knew everything about the menu and sold me the house special like it was gold on a plate haha did I regret it? NO. It was fish on top of dirty rice and this green sauce, which I call chimichurri back home. AMAZING combination of flavors. Everyone was super satisfied with their food. I'm not gonna lie, the kitchen did mess up on 2 orders but they also fixed a special plate for one of us. Everyone mentioned the chips and salsa on their reviews and they are right! the salsa is just perfect and super addicting... We got a super cute group pic taken by the photographer that works there, perfect to end our trip. I had a great experience here and I will come back next time I'm in town!",

People watching (exceptionally good for this)  Ok, this is Vegas; but this place was pretty terrible as far as the food went. I don't think thats why anyone would go here... but still. Skip it.  The margaritas are, meh... sugary and headache-making.  Anyway, good location, you can see the Bellagio water show go off every half-hour, but aside from that and watching all the weirdoes walk by, no redeeming qualities. Save yourself the $50.  There was a Michael Jackson impersonator just standing on the sidewalk and not dancing though...  Skip it",

I guess since we were a group of ten and the server knew he'd be getting automatic gratuity he figured he didn't need to put forth much effort. It took 10 minutes to get our drink order, then another 10 to take our food order...about 30 to get the food-you see where I am going with this? All of the waitstaff seemed to not want to make eye contact with the patrons for fear they may get asked for anything. The server only checked on us once about 15 minutes after the food had come out which to me was unacceptable, especially because they weren't busy. It took another 20 minutes to get the check. The food was terrible. I got beef tacos and the beef tasted like how dog food smells if that makes sense. An overall horrible lunch with horrible service and horrible food. Plus overpriced. Avoid this place!",

    "text": "My husband and I decided to play \"tourist\" on the Memorial Day weekend.  We started to Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile Shops.  While walking thru the shops, we decided to share a yard margarita.  (If we wanted to play tourists, we had to look the part!)  Fat Tuesdays had a line down the hall and around the corner!  So we thought we'd see what else was in the shops.  We thought we were lucky because just as we were about to walk out of the shops, Cabo Wabo Cantina appears with a margarita/daiquiri stand.  We end up getting the  1/2 yard with a strawberry margarita.  The first couple sips, neither of us said anything.  I didn't care for the drink so I stopped drinking it.  About 2 minutes later, my husband looks at me and says \"Doesn't this taste a little funny?\"   Yes!  It tasted like a watered down slushie/virgin margarita!  We decided to salvage the drink...went to ABC Store, bought Bacardi's Cherry flavor and poured a couple shots in there.  It tasted much better after that.  All and all...the drink cost over $30 (between the cost of the  1/2 yard at Cabo Wabo, tip, and ABC liquor purchase).  Will we go back?  Heck NO!  I'll wait in line at Fat Tuesdays or skip the drink next time.  PS:  This struck me as very strange....Our server at Cabo Wabo was counting her tips.  And not just quickly going thru the cash and then waiting on us.  She was pretending to be interested in us while she was counting out her money.  We told her our drink order and she gave us the \"deer in the headlights\" look with a blank smile!  She wasn't paying attention to one word we said!  We repeated our order, she recounted her money then got us our drink.  Not sure why it was so important to count her money so intensely but it was kinda weird!",

The place was pretty empty, so we got seated quickly.  For a place that's named after a tequila brand, I was expecting WAY more from my margarita. Super, super sugary and not much tequila taste, and no where near enough salt.  The place gets 2 stars because the nachos were really good. They're \"build your own\" and over priced, but tasty and a HUGE amount. But they arrived just a couple min before the rest of our food. And the rest of the food was TERRIBLE. My husband said the fish tacos were just ok, and everything on my combo plate was bland and greasy.   Service was super slow for an empty restaurant, but the girl who came around to take pics was nice, and the hostesses let us snag a menu for my friend's bro.  We ate at Salsa Cantina in Miracle Mile a couple nights before and it was SOOOO much better, even the margaritas, and cheaper. Save yourself the trip to Cabo Wabo unless you're drinking Modelo on the patio to people watch... bottled beer they can handle.",

Went outside to sit and people watch for a little bit since there are tables right on the Strip. Too cold, so went back inside. Surrounding people were all very nice. The bartenders were all really cool, too. Generous pours , huge shots, and not ridiculous prices for drinks.   Some people were still ordering food even though it was late. I did not try the food but the smell of all of the fajitas when they were brought by started to make me nauseous.   Supposedly all of the bands have to play Sammy songs as part of their sets. It's a requirement to play there. The only song I heard when I was there was \"Can't Drive 55\".",

    "text": "We stopped here for a quick snack and a margarita...and were pretty underwhelmed.  We sat outside on the patio in the bar area, and our server was friendly, but the overall atmosphere was not what we expected.  The bar area itself was pretty unkempt with used glasses and half-eaten baskets of chips strewn about, but our table itself was not that dirty.  The flatware and appetizer plates, however, matched the decor of the bar and we had to ask for new sets twice before settling on some that we could use.    We both had a regular margarita made with Patron silver on the rocks, and while they were not overly sweet, the taste of tequila was pretty negligible.  Since it was hot out, they still tasted good, but not good enough to order more than one.  After getting our drinks, we tried an order of the Chips, Salsa & Guacamole from the appetizer menu, and an order of the ceviche.  The guac was pretty good (but lacked salt), and we liked the salsa, but the seafood in the ceviche was definitely not \"cooked\" all the way.  I would say stick to the easy to prepare items on the menu as far as food goes (the ceviche should be a hard pass), as the focus seems to be more on quantity and not quality.  Also worth noting is that when we asked for our check, our friendly server suddenly turned into our SLOW server, and it took more than 15 minutes for her to just run our card.  I would recommend paying with cash if you can, as it seemed like a few other tables around us were riding on the same train of frustration when it came time to pay.  Overall, there are better spots to grab a quick drink and a good bite to eat, but if you do stop in here, try the inside dining area for a more enjoyable dining experience.  Cheers!",

I am a bit of a Mexican-food snob & prefer mom n pop type of Mexican joints. I was expecting OK tasting food & expensive prices since it's on The Strip.  The prices were quite high for the amount of food you get, but I was surprised at how delicious the chimichangas & cheese quesadillas were!  The setting was very casual & VERY loud. I couldn't hear my friends from across the table. But, it has a decent view of the Las Vegas Blvd & the Water Fountain Show at Bellagio.  Overall experience: it satisfied my hunger & I had a great time with my party.  Would I eat here again? Probably not =/",

The only downfall was not enough shading, causing us to maneuver the table and chairs so we were all mostly covered from the blistering sun. It was pretty expensive as well, but that is Vegas for you.",

    "text": "While taking a visitor to see the Bellagio - and with a 2-year old in tow, we looked for a quick dinner spot that can easily accomodate a toddler.  We turned around from the Bellagio fountains and saw Cabo Wabo and decided to check out the prices.  On a Monday evening around 6pm the place was pretty empty and we sat inside.  The service was excellent and overall we had a very enjoyable dinner experience and I will return to eat here.  Now, the food is a bit overpriced for casual mexican-fare - but this is a Strip-facing restaurant and overpriced food is just normal.  If you live here, you know this well and can't exactly fault the place for it.  If the prices are too much for you, go find a mexican restaurant inside a not-so-popular hotel.    We started with the fresh guacamole and it was simply wonderful and fantastic and worth the splurge if more than one person will eat it.  I had two margaritas ($12.00 each) - both of which were very good and large.  I ordered the shrimp tacos ($16.00) and each taco had 5-6 wonderfully breaded shrimp.  They were excellent!!   My brother in law had the Mahi Mahi tacos ($16.00) and he LOVED them!!   We also order off the kids menu for our toddler - which is often ridiculous of us because she doesn't eat that much - but we did.  The kids menu is very diverse with many options and the serving side was almost like an adult portion.  What she didn't eat, my brother in law finished off - so it didn't go to waste!    All in all this was a great dining experience - and great for families with kids.  We will be returning here the next time we need a quick meal near the Bellagio.",

    "text": "2.5 stars  I really wanted to like this bar / restaurant since I'm a Sammy Hagar fan and they have live hard rock music most nights. Great location on the strip in PH. They have a really cool patio where you can look out over the strip and people watch. The patio gets busy so you need to get a spot early or hold onto it once you have it..   They have a mix of live music, karaoke and jam sessions with famous musicians including Sammy when he is in town. Bonus if your lucky enough to be around when this happens. The bands are very loud in the evening so not a place to have a quiet conversation.  They specialize in Sammy's own tequila - Cabo Wabo. I'm not a tequila expert by any means but this stuff is strong! You can have it straight up, in a mixed drink or in a frozen drink blend. I switched to Beer after the first tequila, unfortunately they had a limited selection.  Food is average. We had the nachos and home made Guac. which was both good and refreshing (lot's of cilantro). The fish tacos were good as was the burrito.    Service was good, we were given a table quickly and received our drinks within minutes. Not sure if we had a new survey on my last visit but they were not overly familiar with the menu details. The server also gave us some recommendations for various bars to visit later in the evening.      Prices were on the higher end for what you get which is why I rated Cabo 2.5 stars. I would go back depending on the live music in the evening but would grab dinner elsewhere before arriving. Stick with drinks and appetizers given all the food options in Vegas.",

I spend a lot of time at the PH and I've never been to Cabo Wabo, but I think that I'll be coming back here more often because their food is really really good.   The thing I didn't like is even though I was outside I still had to yell at the people I was with to have a conversation... It's a restaurant NOT a club, and no amount of loud music and skimpy outfits can make it so...well maybe more skimpy clothing maybe....  Check back later to see how many check in's I actually have on it as well as a re-review in June after the Miss USA beauty pageant comes through.  Enjoy!",

Service wasn't bad, though the waiters were all awkwardly sitting at a table near the entrance just talking and waiting around. It was around 11am when we stopped in, so not super busy, but it was weird to have them just all sitting at a table.  The food was a bit expensive for what it was. I ended up getting the carne asada tacos -- not anything amazing or memorable. Roberto's Tacos off the strip is a much better choice. The margarita was strong, but also not amazing taste. Our bill for tacos, a salad, 2 margaritas and 2 bloody marys was $100.   I'd pass on this place during future visits and try something else.",

    "text": "I generally enjoyed this place.  I'm kind of a Rock and Roll fan and really enjoy Sammy's work (Chickenfoot Rocks!).  So, when I got the chance to go to one of his signature joints, it was a no brainer.    First the drinks.  I had the Waborita.  Three of them actually.  They were, as expected, really good.  I've had Cabo Wabo tequila before and it's a good tequila.  These drinks were large and packed a punch.  Not to mention, they tasted good.  Second, the food.  The food was also good.  The portions were large.  Not super large.  But not small.  The food tasted good and the ingredients tasted fresh.  The salsa, which they claimed was XXX spicy, was not what I expected as XXX spicy.  It was hot though and tasted good.    Next, the service.  Service was prompt.  The waitress was attentive to our needs and friendly.  Really couldn't ask for much more!  The price.  It's a bit on the high side.  But then again, you are in Las Vegas.  If you are looking for cheap Mexican-ish food, there are plenty of Chipotles and Taco Bells floating around.  The quality here is better.  Expect to pay more.    Lastly, the atmosphere.  This is where I have my only real complaint about this place.  It felt like Jay Z, Pitbull, and Drake were on loop play, with the occasional rock song thrown in.  I know there are people that like that crap, but come on!  This is Sammy Hagar's place.  Play some damn Rock and Roll!  All in all, I recommend it.  Just be prepared to spend a bit above average and to hear some crappy hip hop pop junk music.",

One of the barbacks, Chris(?), was phenomenal. He took care of us from start to finish.   The signature margarita was good, but the coconut one was the best. It is similar to a daiquiri.   The food teetered on okay to good. The bacon wrapped shrimp was delicious, but it is hard not to love goat cheese stuffed shrimp wrapped in bacon and then fried. The rice needs a little work. Not much flavor there. The tuna ceviche is closer to a tartar. It borderlines on the sweet side. The spicy shrimp with garlic chips was one of the better dishes. It had a balance of flavors and not just overtly spice levels.  Jason, the GM, came by to talk to us and was very friendly. It is refreshing to see management touch the tables and actually care about the guest's experience. Adam, another manager came around to introduce himself as well. It was a fun service experience. I would like to come back when I have more free time to check out their tequila selection.",

    "text": "I decided to take my wife to @CaboWaboLV for an early Valentine's dinner since she is the biggest @Sammy_Hagar fan & has been dying to check this place out since it opened.   Before going I did my homework and read all the reviews that had been posted. After reading I was really surprised this place is still OPEN. Not too many good things being said.   We arrived on Friday night around 10pm and the house band had just started playing. Acoustic Soul-Las Vegas' Original & Only LIVE Jukebox. They play all requests-some good some NOT so good.   We were seated immediately with no wait even though the place was packed including the outdoor patio bar.   The menu is mexican food with a baja twist. VERY Pricey. We ordered Beef Fajita Nachos to start-The Carne Asada Entree & a 3 item combo with Hard & Soft shell tacos and a cheese enchilada. Ice Water all around. NO drinks this time:)   (However they did pour FREE shots of tequila when the band played \"Mas' Tequila\")   The service was a little slow it took nearly 30 minutes before we saw the appetizers and we spent most of the night chewing on ice.   The nachos were very underwhelming-10-12 soggy chips covered in cheap shredded cheese and sparse bits of beef fajita meat. 4 melonballer size scoops of (lettuce,pico,sour cream & guac) NO seasoning, no spice, no flavor just cheese. The complimentary chips & salsa are a much better choice.   NEXT, the entrees came out- The carne asada plate covered w/cheese, onions and jalapenos. a couple tortillas and a plate with (lettuce,pico,sour cream & guac). NO salsa!! Again with the cheap shredded cheese and the jalapenos were not even cooked just sliced and covered in cheese.   The fajita onions & peppers were way too much compared to the skimpy 8oz carne asada steak. The steak like the nachos had NO seasoning or flavor. FOR $20 at a bar I was really expecting something phenomenal.   The 3 item combo of beef tacos and cheese enchilada was alright except for the cheese enchilada which again used the cheap shredded cheese which didnt melt well at all and was tasteless.   The lack of seasoning for a mexican resataurant is really unacceptable and NO salsa with entrees no beans with the chips appetizer. :(   For 2 people to have an appetizer and 2 entrees-drink ice water and get slow service for $65 pretty disappointing to say the least:(",

    "text": "Great place to watch the ballagio water show.... I left a pool party at Marquee and was able to cool down and chill with a appetizer sampler and a house margarita in my swim suit and take in the atmosphere. It was a quick walk from the cosmopolitan and the patio was elevated just enough that I see over the crowds in the strip. The inside looks pretty small so oitdoors was great esp with the mist spray on. The menu seems really good. Classic dishes with a modern twist. The bbq chicken wings were awesome along with the chips and salsa. I loved the queso dip with my taquitos. The sampler was enough to feed me and 3 others. The fish tacos were amazing and the chipotle sauce they add to it made it complete! The service was fast, friendly and they were always checking on us despite the full crowd they had going on. Can't wait to try something else on the menu next time....",

Because we were going by we saw a sign they'd be showing the fights and decided to stop there for dinner and drinks. We asked about the fights and they said $30/person to go inside upstairs and watch or watch at the bar for free. Well, we said we'd sit at the bar. After inquiring twice about when they'd be showing the fights we were informed that they actually weren't showing the fights at the bar and welcomed us to open our wallet to go upstairs. Felt totally conned. We cancelled our order, got to go cups and left with our drinks. Do not appreciate being lied to.",

    "text": "This review is based on the sleazy tactics used by the waiter. We had a few hours before catching our flight home. We wanted an outdoor venue. They do have a nice location right on the strip but slightly elevated. I looked at the menu and order the Shrimp Taco's. The waiter decided that I would like the Sammy Shrimp better. When he brought it out, I asked him where my taco's were. He said, \"I thought you might like this better.\" Everyone else had their food and we had a flight to catch so I said \"whatever\". It wasn't that good but it was food.  When I got the bill, he charged me for Shrimp and not the tacos. The Shrimp is the most expensive plate on the menu. I said no way, I didn't order that. I said bill me for what I ordered.  He went to check with the manager and came back and said she said no. He then trys to play the guilt trip on me by saying he will take it out of his own pocket. That may work on some people. I said I will talk to the manager. He stopped me and said he would ask again. He came back and offered to take $5 off. I know this is a scam that they use to increase average bill. They may even get bonuses for selling the most expensive items. Sad.",

Lets start off with, we got seated quickly. That was a good start, but from then on it went down hill. We got TERRIBLE service. We weren't the only ones either because i heard the people sitting around us commenting about the horrible service they were getting also. Finally when the waitress came around, we ordered the sampler platter and the signature margarita. The food was mediocre...you would think for the price is would be wow! but it was \"ehhh\". The drink also was nothing special for the price and for their \"signature\". We didn't bother ordering anything else because for us, it wasn't worth it.  To sum it up, i should have checked out yelp before buying the groupon, but oh well. You never really know until you try something for yourself. Anyways, I don't like this place and i wouldn't refer anyone to it either.",

We decided to eat inside, even though the girl told us there was karaoke going on inside. Big mistake. We stepped into deafening noise. The \"DJ\" there thought he was the funniest, cutest thing, but he was actually just obnoxious. The only people there doing karaoke were his friends and family. Like, his mom and shit. What was funny is he had a laptop to DJ. And he was shit at it. He would blast a song during every interval, and then act all flustered cause he had \"so many people to get through\" that night. There were two people besides us that weren't his family. Too loud and too annoying.  Also, the cooks didn't take the wrapper off of my fiance's cheese and put it on his burger. WTF. And the waiter was a jerk. I finished my water and ate my ice, and he brought out 3 more waters, I guess to be funny? I finished it because you didn't bring my drink within 10 minutes. Then he randomly stopped by and left his own personal drink on our table. wtf wtf wtf. Never again.",

I still, however want to put in my 2 cents about it.   We had a $60 groupon that was apparently only able to be used by a party of 4 or more. This was written in the tiny print online only-nowhere printed on the groupon. The \"manager\" on duty was an ass. He immediately said he was going up to his office in order to print something out to prove us wrong. He was VERY condescending, attacking and just an all around awful person. The GM, who was not much better, cam down to us and finally agreed to take the $30 off that we paid for the groupon. The waitress was great and. Feel bad that she has to work for these nimrods. She had no clue that there was a per party requirement either, which again speaks to the (lack of) skill of these brilliant managers.   I threw a fit with Groupon and got my money back. The chick on the phone did not sound surprised. Also-there were other tables having similar issues with their Groupons.   Regardless-I'll never ever go back.",

We were not actually sat by the hostess just pointed toward the tables. No menus, so I'm assuming the frat boy waiter assumed we didn't want service. When I asked for menus he looked at me like I was nuts. Then 5 seconds after getting the menus he asked us, \"so are you gonna order something?\" Really?  He never asked us if wanted drinks, I went up to the Bar to get mine. For a weak 8 oz margarita it was TWENTY DOLLARS!!!! For a pre-made Slurpee with house alcohol!!     I would never go back there again. They treated us like trash and we did nothing to deserve it.   And to top it off I accidentally left an expensive souvenir behind, when I returned they didn't have a lost n found they said \"we just throw it away\". I tried to express the whole experience to the manager, his response was \"oh well\".   WOW - worst service EVER!",

    "text": "CONTEXT: Recently graduated college dudes stop by Cabo Wabo at the tail end of a weekend, because it has the unbeatable combination of queso and 97 televisions.  THE REVIEW: Jesus Herbert Christ.  We went into this not caring that it had a 2ish star review, and expecting it to be standard sub-par Tex Mex.  What we got were plates of butt vomit, mildly unique from each other, served in convenient thirty minute intervals.  I guess I should mention positive aspects of the experience first.  The hostess was very, very attractive, as were many of the kind, smart, and important ladyfolk on the waitstaff.  We must have been assigned the one legacy bid, but that wasn't much of a big deal (side note - there were about 150 waitresses, all coming from upstairs or the kitchen, at all times.  There were twenty patrons.  Who are you serving?  What the hell is upstairs!?  Irrelevant.  I apologize).  When ordering, the waitress let us know that salsa came with the queso, and it would be a waste of money to order the chips and salsa.  That's groovy, in my book.  She did that once or twice again when we were ordering our meals, and probably saved us about ten dollars by letting us know random things our hangovers weren't allowing us to pick up on by ourselves.  Lastly, there was a TV in every corner, and they were all on the Sunday night NFL game.  No nonsense from ESPN8: The Ocho or garbage political newsfeeds.  Bueno.  The one reason we stopped here, above all others, was cheese dip.  It is a staple of our recovery rubric.  It is a communion cracker of sorts, after a bingy, gambly wreck of a weekend in Las Vegas.  The queso at Cabo Wabo was of decent consistency, with pico de gallo sprinkled on top.  It never filmed, it wasn't powdered-cheese-turn-queso.  It was physically acceptable.  It tasted, however, like government cheese with a hint of dirt or motor oil from the ungloved hand that had handled it prior to putting it into a bowl and melting it.  Did we eat it?  Shit yes.  Should we have?  I don't know, but it still feels like the demon sauce is painted onto my esophagus.  It came with thick chips that probably would have been tasty, had they been heated or lightly salted before arriving.  The salsa is a thick roasted pepper (chipotle?) salsa that was on the edible side of questionable.  I had been craving fajitas all weekend, mostly because my phone auto-corrected a slur I had written in a text to the word \"fajitas\" on the night of our arrival.  Karma for my ignorant textual intention greeted me fist-to-face when I received my hamburger steak fajitas, which arrived with a fajita sizzlesmell that literally caused people at the table to cough.  If your lungs bark at the smell of a food, you're probably experiencing the triggering of some sort of evolutionary warning system.  I ignored it.  My meatloaf fajita was served very well done, over a bed of 90% onions and 10% red peppers.  The fajita complements were all satisfactory, and by the end of the meal, I was making soft tacos with just the guac, sour cream, refried beans, and shredded cheese.  My friends ordered the jalapeno chicken burrito thing, the fish tacos, and the kids' menu chicken fingers.  No one liked their food, save for the manchild who ordered from the kids' menu.  I think the chicken fingers would have been difficult to sabotage, though, given the effort in doing so to the other dishes.  Of note - four chicken strips were twelve dollars.  The fish tacos were particularly no good.  It seemed like someone had forgotten to deep fry them, or had intentionally *shrug* *middle finger to no one in particular* *microwave*'d them.  Our bill came out to about 25 dollars a person.  That may be an inaccurate number, though, because I don't know if it garnered interest while we waited for our waitress to pop out of her coma and acknowledge us.  The booth at which we were seated was a backseat pulled from a 1983 Ford Tempo, and our cups of pond water may have had mosquitoes camping out on them.  I can't recall.  Notwithstanding our miserable experience, the $4.00 plastic cup of Coke I ordered was delicious...  OH!  Afterthought!  We were denied outdoor seating, despite the 8-10 empty tables we noticed on the patio.  It was probably for the best, as the daystar would have ruined us worse than Cabo Wabo did on its own.  I wish I had more hands, so I could give Sammy's place four thumbs down.  As a connoisseur of substandard Mexican food, I implore you to avoid this place.  The Megan Fox lookalikes out front are Sirens, I promise.",

Yes, that's all we wanted...but let me tell you, the salsa was freaking delightful. The waiter was pretty nice, especially considering we were only ordering chips and salsa for food! They have great drinks, prices are decent, (I mean you are in Vegas), and again the service was pretty good too. We would for sure stop in again :)",

    "text": "We wanted to visit this restaurant because Sammy's \"Cabo Wabo\" tequila was a sponsor for a stunt plane we loved seeing at the airshows and we are loyal to folks who sponsor the sport we love. So while we were at CinemaCon this year we stopped in for dinner. We were very disappointed. I would have given it 3 stars for food. 1 star for service. To start with it was not busy, We were seated under a heat lamp on a rather warm night and had to move, I felt like I was getting a sun burn. Unfortunately no one came to check on us for some time. We almost walked out but right then we found a table not under a heat lamp and the bus boy helped us move to that table. Finally we met our waitress, she was very rude right off the bat. \"what do you want to drink?\", I told her I was hoping to see a drink menu. I was informed they were out. \"If you come back next week you can see one.\" Yes she really said that. WOW! So I just got a boring margarita. Turns out it tasted like almost every other margarita I ever had. I had been feeling festive and wanted to try something new but oh well.  At this point we changed our plans and decided just to have our first drink and finish our dinner and find someplace else to have a few fun drinks and desert. Too bad because we had permission to use the company credit card for a night out. Cabo Wabo could have made more than a few bucks off of us sucker tourists. Haha. Well, When the waitress would condescend to stop by, she never once smiled. Made me feel like we were bothering her by coming in. Food was pretty good. I was just shocked at the attitude of the waitstaff we encountered. Also on a side note, I slipped on spilled ice when going to the restroom (womans restroom was a mess). The employees did not even help me up, a couple customers did. Luckily I was not hurt just turns out high heels and ice dont mix well, but the girl working inside, who was about 20 feet away when I fell,  could have asked me if I was okay nor did anyone seem concerned there was ice on the floor.  If I had to sum up our visit in one word: BUMMER",

They told us it would be an hour wait so we squeezed in by the outside bar & quickly grabbed some seats after a couple left. The bartenders were quick to take our order and bring us our drinks. The food and drinks were okay, definitely overpriced, but it's the location that you're really paying for. It located on Planet Hollywood's property.  My biggest complaint has to be the hidden CNF fee. When we received our bill I noticed the tax and another line that said CNF fee. I inquired about the CNF line and the bartender said she really didn't know what it was or why they charged it. She thinks it's a fee that Planet Hollywood imposes on them, so they pass it down to the consumers. I can't even remember what the percentage was, but the issue is that extra fees should be posted somewhere for everyone to see. I asked to see the menu again and it was not posted anywhere there. I asked them if this fee is posted anywhere and she said she didn't think so. You can't surprise consumers with extra fees on the bill!!! She did offer to bring a manager over to explain the fee to me, but I didn't feel like waiting.   It's a 3 star place, minus 1 for hidden fees.",

The good stuff first: I came here because of the location - it's one of the few restaurants that have an open patio on the strip. Great for people watching and checking out the Bellagio fountains.  Now the bad stuff: the food sucks. I felt like tacos and the server recommended the grilled fish tacos. He said they were really popular. I like fish tacos so I went with his recommendation. When I got my plate, there was a huge side of disgusting goopy fried beans (I had asked if they were black beans), oddly dry and favourless fried rice, and 2 very sad looking fish tacos. The tacos consisted of a thin strip of cold dry fish jerky with some shreds of lettuce and tomatoes. I managed to eat one taco and a few scoops of rice because I was hungry and left everything else on my place. The server took my plate away and didn't even ask about my meal. I really should have complained but I was just too tired to even deal with it.  I might come back for drinks on the patio but I would be scared to try their food again!!",

And the beers were expensive, so while it was buy one get one - you were paying twice as much as you would in some other bars on the strip.

While we were waiting, the music was bumping & this ladies wanted to dance w/ the waiter. He was fun & was dancing w/ the customers.  It was entertaining.

Affordable & worth dining here.  The only thing I didn't like was the greeters stand in the heat outside. They should have the mist on them also since they're standing there the whole shift.

Luckily I was wearing a shirt with the ingredients/recipe on the back.  It was fantastic.  I ordered the split Ceviche and although it looked like small portions, It actually filled me up.  A group of English tourists came in and asked about the Waborita and soon the were drinking them too.  I guess the point is that the bartender was very willing to accommodate a non-menu item in the middle of a busy day.  My guess is that she won't ever forget how to make them.    The reason I'm writing this review is because I have been to the Cabo Wabo Cantina in Cabo San Lucas, MX.  I came in expecting a certain vibe and wasn't disappointed.  I wasn't there too long before an authentic Mexican Mariachi band showed up and the place got a little more lively.  All of the servers seemed to be having fun and from my perspective at the bar, the patrons were all having a great time too.  I can't comment on food I didn't eat, but I didn't see anyone complaining or sending items back.  It is a fun place to go if you have some time!",

    "text": "I decided to eat inside because the weather was sooo sooo hot in Vegas over the weekend.  I was traveling on a work trip and eating alone.   If you've ever done that you probably know that wait staff tend to look at you wierd as they'd rather serve a table of two and get a bigger tip rather than seat a single person in a booth for two.  That said, I felt that a bit at Cabo Wabo, but overall my waitress was very good and considerate of my needs.  Note - unlike most mexican restaurants you may be familiar with, you pay extra here for chips and salsa.  Even if you want salsa to dress your chopped salad you pay $1 for it. I guess that is the nature of eating on the strip though ... almost nothing's cheap.   That said I ordered a chopped vegetarian southwest salad an it was EXCELLENT.  Seriously one of the best salads I can remember in a long time and I'm a vegetarian so I eat a lot of salads.  I'd gladly eat there again.  My only regret is I checked into yelp late and missed their check in offer for a free house margarita with an entree.  I ordered an upgraded margarita instead but saved the offer in case I go back.  I'd happily go back and enjoy that salad again.  Don't forget to check in before you order.",

    "text": "On my first trip to Vegas we decided to grab a bite to eat. Walking the strip we came across Cabo Wabo Cantina. It was packed, so we decided to see if there would be a wait. They girl said she would be able to seat our party ASAP. We approached the table and it WAS dirty, the girl quickly bused it though and had it wiped down. We decided to get a pitcher of the desert pear margarita. There was enough in the pitcher for two drinks each for the three ppl we had. It was pretty good but I didn't taste the desert pear really. I ordered steak fajitas while the other two in my party got a chimichanga and vegetarian fajitas (portobello mushrooms). The fajitas said they came with flour tortillas and the sever said he was willing to honor my request for corn. We also got chips and salsa for the table. While most of the food was in the $15-$30 range, Chips and salsa were $4! It was a huge serving and was very good! Our food came pretty quickly. The amount of food I had was enough for two ppl actually. I had enough left over to take back to the hotel to eat the next day. My meat was cooked and seasoned perfectly! I was a little disappointed that I only received three tortillas. Being Latina, I LOVE tortillas, so I wish I was given more. All in all, I enjoyed my meal and appreciated the prompt service and that our server was very helpful and attentive! I will definitely return!",

I tried to eat here and left because the service was lacking.  Waters were not filled.  Food came cold and without condiments we needed like salsa and when we asked for it, the server forgot about us.   2nd Time: They earned an extra star because of Groupon. They had a special for $15 for $30 worth of food or drinks. The best part was that for some reason Groupon only charged $1! I was like What??? I don't care how bad, the place was before...Dollar for drinks? I'm in. I purchased 2!    Apparently it was some mistake, but Groupon honored it and I came armed with $30 to spend.  Went straight to the bar and got two $14 shots of tequila that came in a Worm shaped  bottle.  Smooooooooth. So if you come armed with the Groupon or not get the Tequila in the Worm Bottle. You will not regret it. Skip the food.  Hagar earned the extra star for the Worm Bottle Tequila Basically and the nice bartender.  Didn't have time to use the other Groupon on that trip...but Worm Tequila...I'm coming back for you!!!",

    "text": "Came here to grab some margaritas and a few small plates to share during the middle of the day. We sat outside and the place had a really great, lively atmosphere (but I guess you get that everywhere in Vegas). Great place for people watching, not only at the bar, but also the people along the strip. Decent playlist of music too!   We ordered a pitcher of the house margaritas, which is premade. The waitress informed us it was premade before ordering and tried to convince us to upgrade to the margaritas that were made from scratch. We didn't listen, but we should have. The premade mix lacked tequila and was a little heavy on the sour mix. Our next pitcher, we switched to frozen (also premade) but found this one much, much better. If you don't want to pay the additional $10 for the \"from scratch\" margaritas, definitely get them frozen.  For food, we shared the queso dip and added chicken to it. This also came with free chips and salsa. The queso was pretty standard, but was disappointed that it wasn't the traditional white queso they serve at most restaurants - kind of looked like it was melted velveeta (which it wasn't). Was disappointed by the lack of chicken that was included in the queso, since we paid additional for it - definitely not worth the upcharge, as we only got a few pieces in it. The chips themselves were great and were warm when served. I personally liked the salsa that came with it, but my friend did not like it at all. It is definitely not a traditional salsa, but am unsure which ingredient made it a little different.   We also shared the chicken taquitos, which were amazing. They were served immediately after being cooked, so they were nice and warm. The chicken inside was moist and not overcooked, as most meat in taquitos tend to be. The outside was crunchy. It also came with a good helping of guacamole, sour cream, and pico de gaillo which was nice to dip into.   Overall, would definitely go back for the atmosphere and frozen margaritas and would be willing to try some different food.",

Dining in for a quick snack on a weekday, the vibe at this place was awesome, they had a cover band (which I didn't catch their name) covered a mix of alt music and rock, it was absolutely chill as if it were a Sunday afternoon. The nacho platter was delicious, cheese blend covered perfectly and had the right amount of sour cream and guac. The weather was perfect. I high recommend this place to sit back enjoy great food with great company. The staff was so attentive and great, came in with beer from the casino and offered to refill, they all were on point. Wait time was zero and fit us in super quick. Definite repeat customer here. Great job. Can't wait to return for UFC on the weekends!",

This chain has made their name by offering mexican food along with strong margaritas.  This is good place to do Taco tuesday at or any other day in the week. Due to its location its ncie to just sit down and have a casual meal without any commitment. You can decide to either go here for a whole meal or just a drink before continuing to another waterhole in vegas.   It can get pretty crowded so if you are a big company, you should probably be early. If you are just a few and feeling lucky, you can always try to sneak in later. In that case i would also suggest you grab one of the bar seats towards the strip. Here you can easily spend an hour or two crowd spotting without even reflecting about it.  This place is definitely worth a try due to its prime location, and you can either go for a quick drink or an unpretentious meal.",

    "text": "One of the better Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas, Cabo Wabo's service for us has always been top notch. The food is some of the best Mexican food in Las Vegas that we've found.   Our server, Mario was very swift and helpful with the menu. He gave us the perfect amount of time we needed to look at the menu without us having to call him over and without hounding us. The food also came out in a timely manner. We ordered fajitas for one which was enough for us to share between the both of us and get full after our queso and salsa chips. I'm not a fan of the chips and salsa not being served freely but being that it's on the strip, it's understandable seeing as though so many people could just be drunk and want to come eat free chips. Lol the charge of three to four dollars isn't bad but if you're going to invest towards the chips and salsa, get the queso and chips for nine dollars instead because the queso is amazing and very filling. Both queso and salsa are bottomless. Our fajitas were steak and shrimp. The steak could have been a little more tender, it was a little chewier than we prefer but the shrimp was absolutely delicious and had a sweeter flavor. Mmmm...portions of sides were all well measured.  After our meal we were both full and satisfied. Mario brought us our ticket but informed us that happy hour just started at 3pm! He encouraged us to try the sangrias since we're not big tequila drinkers and we ended up getting two, one white and one red for $6.80 per drink when originally they are double that! Mario brought them in to go cups which was pretty handy and clever! The white one is my favorite but my fiancee likes the red so it worked out perfectly!   If you're going to eat here, eat outside. If you eat by the you edge you'll get a good view of the Bellagio fountain show!   We'll definitely be back! Thanks Mario!",

    "text": "First off, their margaritas are top notch.  They offer them with many different tequilas and flavors.  Try the margarita if you happen to stop into Cabo Wabo.  Now that that is out of the ay, the rest of my experience underwhelmed.  I came for a party so the prices didn't bother me as much, but just looking through the menu, I noticed it was way over-priced.  Cabo Wabo has a good view of the strip so it's no surprise the prices are high, but the unnecessarily high prices will always knock off a star in my book.  We ordered appetizers, including chips, fajitas, quesadillas, and other sampler dishes for our party.  The food was actually very subpar - it seemed almost microwaved or cooked in a large batch.  If I were to spend a lot of money on food, I would want it cooked for me in particular, not just placed on my plate.  If you want a drink, come to Cabo Wabo.  I even believe they have a solid Happy Hour during the week.  But if you are looking for a sit-down meal, I would look elsewhere.",

The outside portion of the restaurant doesn't take reservations.  I give props to our server who navigated the crowd, shouted over the noise, and adequately served our food. It took FOREVER and wasn't 100% accurate, but our hungry tummies let it slide.  I think that Cabo Wabo was kid friendly. There were kids there and they seemed to been well accommodated.  The food was okay but forgettable. We like Mexican food, but we had a hard time finding menu items that appealed to us. We split a salad and our friend got something else. Our salad had too much dressing but was tasty. We had this problem on the strip at many restaurants. It's hard to find health-conscious food.",

My tequila shots were great and did the job....I only wish I did not have beer right after since I got wasted....  -Another plus was that we were seated right away......I was kind of between 2 and 3 stars since my meal was not so great, but the service and drinks pretty much gave it a 3...",

    "text": "The Cabo Wabo Cantina is another one of those tourist traps along the Strip...but then again, isn't Vegas one big tourist trap?  Come here if you're interested in some mediocre-to-average Mexican food and some good tequila cocktails - unless you have a strong aversion to very bad service and an unprofessional wait staff.  In my opinion: YMMV depending on your expectations and the mood of the waitperson.  Pros: Party atmosphere People watching Strip location Good tequila cocktails Free shots for outgoing-types  Cons: Quality of ingredients and taste of food Wait staff Wasted time (long wait for everything)  Let's start with the good: nice Strip location with a lot of foot traffic, which means you'll have plenty of people watching opportunities.  If you are the type to \"do anything\" and cut loose, then you might get a free shot, drink, or shirt - they have games or tequila lines throughout the day/night.  During dinner and throughout the evening, it does get pretty loud and party-like so be advised.  This place definitely isn't for families with kids, seniors, or those with limited mobility.  I went in with a party of 5 - 4 adults and 1 child.  The place is too loud for young children and the outdoor seating has you very close to the tables next to you - good luck trying to squeeze through with a stroller or going with somebody using a cane.  I spent about $100 (including tip) on just food - not bad for a casual bite on the Strip.  You get some decent sized portions for your money and the bartenders aren't shy about making stiff drinks, so it's not that bad if you can tolerate the wait staff and don't expect much from the food.  Our table ordered a few things, including: chicken fajitas, shrimp burrito, nachos, an order of tacos, and of course, drinks.  The food was ok, kind of bland and lacked any excitement despite the loud music blaring throughout the restaurant.  I thought the shrimp was actually good, both the way it was cooked and the marinade, which was a stark contrast to the rest of the items we ordered.  The food isn't up to par with Chevy's but the food is better than Diablo's Cantina; I think both places (Diablo's Cantina and Cabo Wabo) offer a party type atmosphere on the Strip with poor service.    If you haven't guessed by now, I concur with the other reviews: Cabo Wabo has terrible service.  They have a young and unprofessional staff that couldn't care less about doing their job let alone paying any attention to the customer's needs.  Maybe they'll come by for more drink orders, maybe they'll come by to bring you the check, maybe they'll come back with your credit card - the whole experience makes you feel as if you're gambling.  Either the folks who work here have never eaten at a restaurant or they pick and choose their moments based on personal preferences/prejudices.  Management is obviously not looking for repeat customers - they are a one and done outfit.    I think it is odd that most of the \"hip\" joints on the Strip have suspect service and less than average food tied to a decent atmosphere (because of the customers and nothing to do with the actual place).  When compared to similar outfits, the Cabo Wabo is \"ok\" in terms of food, but you really have to check your service expectations at the door.  This place would be a totally different experience with a competent crew, but as it is, I cannot recommend this place to anyone looking for a stress-free meal.  Unfortunately, the Cabo Wabo is completely YMMV based on the whims of your server.",

We walked up to the hostess station inside only to be ignored by the hostess (and a second employee standing next to her) while she chatted on her walkie talkie with another employee.  Finally one of them said \"You wanna eat?\".  No, we randomly walk up to hostess stations all over the city without the intention of eating there.  I was ready to go but my friend had a groupon so he wanted to try it.   We were then sent to the outside hostess station to be ignored by *4* more employees.  Seriously - how many employees do you need to stand around chatting with each other??  One girl even had her leg sprawled across the narrow entranceway to the outside seating.  The hostess went to seat us but didn't tell her to move her leg so she continued to chitchat and block the entrance while we waited.  I don't know who manages this place but he/she needs to get on the ball.  After being seated we were greated by our waiter (something Kennedy?) who was very nice but seemed to want to rush us.    The drinks were served in plastic cups but I have to admit my drink was good (their version of a Long Island Iced Tea).  The prices are not that great (which we expected on the strip) and the food sucked.  It looked like it was going to be tasty but couldn't have been more bland.  There were no condiments offered and there was NOTHING on the table, even salt.  I would never go here again.  Its typical drunk-touron crap.  Bad food, bad employees, bad pricing.",

I ordered the Baja shrimp Ceviche and it was quite salty and lacking flavor. A friend ordered the Ahi ceviche and she said it tasted strange and was sweet. My husband ordered the carne asada tacos and he loved it. Some friends ordered steak Fajitas for 2 and they raved about how delicious the steak is. However they all got charged extra for rice and beans which they received but didn't order. But was later removed after we brought it up to the manager. When paying our $300 bill, I asked about an odd additional \"tax\" they charged which was close to $13. They said Planet Hollywood charges them for being their so they pass that charge along to the customer (which is ridiculous).   Really, a Mexican restaurant that doesn't have complimentary chips and salsa?!?  We dined inside last week and it wasn't anything special. Today we sat Outside is way better if u can handle the heat or in our case the wind!",

Bottom line, food was really pretty good, no complaints amongst the group and I liked my Carne Asada Burrito well enough.  It's Vegas and on the strip so it's overpriced and all, but that's to be expected.  What one shouldn't have to settle for is poor or slow service.  Lunch took well over an hour, about 2/3 of which passed after our food arrived; the waiter just disappeared.   Additionally, they seated us at the table in front of the door to the deck, which would've been find except that remember we sat INSIDE becasue of the wind.  So every time they opened the door, it would slam back against the wall and the rush of wind would blow everything off the table, Took 3-4 instances of this and a few parties complaining before they figured out not to use that door and divert to a door closer to the bar.  Better values and equally good food to be had in the Miracle Mile if you find yourself at PH.  Also, although I am not a drinker, I did use the free Maragarita with a Yelp check in to score a drink for my buddy.  This seemed to confuse both the server and the manager ( the Yelp coupon, not the Margarita). Seems like it would be a good idea to  make sure your employees know your offers on social media!",

Hey, I'm not mad at them, just wondering if this is some kind of dress code? They were friendly and there was definitely a very laid back vibe. I think I was in my bikini with some small cover up and I didnt feel out of place. There were moments when I felt the service could have been a little quicker but I am a very fast paced (like to be in and out of casual dining in 30 minutes or less) so I can forgive them a little for that.  What warrants the 4* rating?   The FOOD!!  I would describe it as \"upscale\" or maybe more \"fine dining\" ish... nothing was heavy handed or greasy or overly cheesy as with most mexican restaurants...it was presented nicely and tasted delish and my husband and I did not feel overly full (I hate that).  We ordered the ceviche and a combo that had a cheese enchilada and I think a beef taco, with rice and beans.   I really did not expect that caliber of mexican food when I walked into this place so I give them their props.   Also, the location is really great- right off the strip and next to alot of shopping (Sephora is right next door)   Anyway, seems like alot of mixed reviews of this place but my husband and I truly enjoyed their food; maybe it depends on what you order.",

My waitress took 20 minutes to bring me water after I requested it.  The food:  They have the best salsa I've had in a long time. Not too spicy and amazing flavor. I could eat it plain. I also ordered Cadillac Nachos which chicken. Amazing! Not a lot of chicken, but great flavor. Contender for the best nachos I've ever had.  The liquor:  I think I ordered a Daiquiri. I don't drink a lot. I will say that they aren't stingy with the alcohol. I could liquor overpowered the drink. My mom loved it. Me, not so much. If you like you drink, you'll be okay with it.  I would come back to this place. Hopefully I'd have a different server.",

My sister and i arrived our server was friendly at first we started with a pitcher of beer and then a couple appetizers an order of guacamole, the shrimp ceviche and the carne asada quesadilla. When we only ordered appetizers our server seemed a little annoyed. The guac was tasty while i only took a bite of my quesadilla since it was oozing grease and my sis liked the ceviche but it looked so different from most ceviche. Now back to the server i wanted to split the cost down the middle i used a card my sister used cash, i wanted to leave the tip on my card so he comes back and asked if we needed the change i said yes and he became such a sourpuss! He handed us $10 cash back assuming since we asked for change we were going to leave him a crappy tip.  I was shocked at his blatant annoyance, i still tipped him 17% even though we were super easy and laid back, what a jerk! One place I won't return.",

I was shocked when the food came out literally seconds after we ordered it.  I have never in my life received food so fast.  Not even from a fast food restaurant.  I was thinking that it was just me since I had wings, but even a table of four that came in after me, was served in less than a minute.    It was the best magic trick I had seen in Vegas! Go there just for the show, if anything else.    I am not big on Mexican food, hence the reason I ordered chicken wings at a Mexican restaurant.  Don't judge me...the wings were excellent, by the way!!",

    "text": "The Cabo Wabo Cantina is one of my favorite places to visit every time I go to Las Vegas!   They have an awesome deck that is right on the strip just outside of Planet Hollywood.  One of the best people watching areas in the country!  Combine that with awesome service, solid food and great drinks and you've got yourself a great time!  Our most recent visit was on 10/20/14.  We were pleasantly greeted and opted for a table right on the rail so we could enjoy the sights.  I will say that they now pump in music...and my previous choice of the bar style seating is now less desirable because the music would be a bit loud there (wait, did I just say that?  music is NEVER too loud..but you get what I mean).  Our server, Ashley, was very nice, kept our drinks filled and provided great service....consistent with every single time we've visited Cabo Wabo! 4 or 5 times there and we've always been very well taken care of.  I tried a few different drinks...a cucumber based margarita...a 'sangarita' (their twist on a sangria, it's pinot noir and tequila) which was better than I anticipated but probably wouldn't get it again, and the standard ol' Waborita, which is my ultimate favorite.  The food is consistently good.  You DO have to pay for chips and salsa (only a couple bucks though) and the salsa is worth it..very tasty.  I used to get the tequila shrimp, but they've removed it from the menu so this time I had the fish tacos (with chipotle crema), while my date had the carne asada tacos (which looked and were delicious..and included avacado!).  It's not 5 star food, but it's way better than normal bar food.  Ultimately it's the combination of location, atmosphere, service, drinks and food that makes Cabo Wabo a winner.  Grab a seat on the rail, a Waborita and enjoy the sights and sounds of the Vegas strip!",

After we got seated he was so nice to bring me and my friend a shot of a yummy drink and again he apologized that we had to witness the idiots being kicked out.

A check in on yelp (no prob) gets you a free margarita on the rocks and then the AAA coupon book from the mall that gets shoved down your throat nets another 20% off your bill. So, it became reasonable but after tip, we still spent $40 for tacos and chips and salsa. But we got free margs that are normally $10/ea and we enjoyed the service from the staff.",

One dish had a mistake and took a little time to be corrected.  Food; pretty decent. Chips and salsa were good. I had the chicken sabana. This was recommended by the waitress. I couldn't tell how big the plate was, and she recommended against ordering more. Food was good and tasty. A little in the oily and greasy side, but good. I liked the chimichurri sauce on top.

Definitely make sure to ask for a seat on the patio outside; it has a gorgeous view of the Strip, and had great live music while we were there.    I got the short rib barbacoa tacos and they were outstanding!  The meat fell apart and everything tasted fresh.  My husband also really enjoyed his chicken enchiladas, and the drinks were great.  I will say that the chips and salsa were not what we expected; the salsa is not really a traditional salsa, and tastes very much like chipotle chiles.   The service was good, though the prices were a bit high (what isn't in Vegas?)  I would definitely recommend if you're near Planet Hollywood and looking for something with a great view.",

The hostess was very friendly and helped us out with finding a seat outside. Once we were sat, our server took a look over our ID's. We are all from Arizona and have the SAME driver licenses. Our server took one the ID's and had told us that she couldn't serve our friend because her I.D wasn't an exact replica. It was a real license. I asked to speak with the manager(crystal) TWICE... and she definitely took her time to come approach us. Once she did, she responded that she couldn't do anything about it.  I told her I would be a cop into  It and she simply replied \"Do whatever. These are my policies\" we closed out our tab immediately. Extremely upset with the way this place handles things. Never coming back again.    Do not recommend this place",

The chorizo queso is excellent, and the chips and salsa are also great.  The drink prices are kind of high, but you get an awesome view of the strip.

Everything about the tacos were delicious. The tortilla, the meat, the onions, everything! The rice was also good and fluffy, how Mexican rice should be!  The environment was fun. Lots of people of course, because it's .. Vegas. But over all a welcoming experience.",

    "text": "Great vibe, mediocre food! That's a one line experience at the Cabo Wabo cantina in Planet Hollywood casino. We went here for lunch one Saturday, after finding an hour long wait at our first choice restaurant. Their patio was packed, but they had seating available inside.  It is located right on the strip between planet hollywood and paris. The location is great since you don't really need to walk inside a casino or actually look for this place. It overlooks the Cosmopolitan and Bellagio.  The place is well setup in mexican decor. I think it's also a sports bar, so they have plenty of TVs lined along the wall. An bar runs along an entire wall, which is pretty big. They also have an outdoor patio, which is great for people watching, and if you're lucky, you can see the Bellagio fountains as well. Even though we were inside, our table was just by the open patio, so we had plenty of direct light. The service is pretty decent, but not prompt or too friendly.  We started off with a pitcher of bahama mama, which was excellent. I'd recommend getting this here. We later had a pitcher of the maui rocker, which was too sweet and syrupy. I didn't enjoy that one.  The food was just meh. We got a queso to share, which we great, but it went downhill from there. We got a burrito, a steak fajita, a chicken sabana, and a cilantro japaleno chicken, none of which are worth a mention. They were fine, but just fine.  The prices are definitely on the higher side, but the location, decor and ambiance justifies it. Our check was $250 for two pitchers, one appetizer, and four entrees.  I would not really go back here for a meal. However, this would be a great place to get a drink on the patio on a warm evening, and try some appetizers.",

So clearly he just didn't want to do it for us. Kinda rubbed us the wrong way. Besides that, today I had the carne asada burrito queso style. It was awesome and hit the spot. Our service was pretty slow and our waitress didn't split our checks, there were 6 of us there! We had to wait til she came back so we could ask her to do individual checks. She made it seem like such a chore. Overall the food was pretty good but service could be improved.",

While the food came out incredibly fast, my entree did not seem as though it was prepared fresh. I ordered shrimp tacos and they came out with almost no warmth and in tortillas that were semi firm. That was super disappointing because on my first visit this same dish came out hot with shrimp that were freshly cooked. The tacos also seemed to be overstuffed with cabbage and only contained three shrimp per taco. It definitely wasn't an entree worth the $18.95 price tag. I also ordered two appetizers, chips with salsa, and hot wings that came with a side of fries. The salsa for the chips was nothing to be remembered but the chips did come out freshly cooked. The wings came out fresh but the fries had obviously been sitting bc they were not nearly as hot as the chicken. The flavor on the wings was great, but cold fries made this dish incomplete and underwhelming.",

So the collector cup is with the slushee is 24 and the extra shot makes it 29.        So I preferred the tacos and Rita's at the mgm had a groupon for a buy one get one. Way worth it to add  an extra shot on that and I definitely could taste the alcohol which is the whole point in buying the drink.       You end up throwing the big giant cup away when your finished because who has room for that in there luggage.       Might be a better option to buy a small one.

Had the Jack Bacon Cheeseburger. As far as cheeseburgers go, it was good. Large portions, but no drink refills. Even getting the bill paid was a challenge. Server took our payment, then took the order for another two tables before even heading back to process payment. Just very surprised. Food was satisfactory, service was not.",

It's also of note we, a party of four, were seated in a walkway seat enjoying the scenic view of the staff as they entered and exited the kitchen. Mind you, there was available seating throughout.  The food was mediocre at best, I would say about the same as Taco Bell or Cafe Rio, and the drinks were about the same. HOWEVER, you're paying Las Vegas Strip prices for Taco Bell. Not quite clear what I mean, imagine paying $29 for a Mexican Pizza combo. I think it's number 4 on the menu. And enough with the Sammy Hagar nostalgia!  Do yourself a favor and just go to Taco Bell.",

I also really like the atmosphere its nice to see everyone enjoying themselves and having a good time. I always walk by this place when walking on the Las Vegas Strip, they are always busy and have a full crowd, I also think they have a DJ most nights. The food there was good also in big portions also almost could split an entree thats for sure, or get two and share. They make the portions big enough, also the employees are also very friendly and nice to customers, your waitress/waiter is tentative to your drinks and anything you need. Usually there is someone walking around filling your water cups and making sure your hydrated which is always a good thing as well.",

Thhis Cabo wabo is located on the strip infront of planet Hollywood.   They offer indoor and outdoor seating. The location is pretty big. Both times I ate here it was lunch. We dident have to make any reservations. The inside is all beach island rock and roll themed. There is a stage inside. The music playing on the speakers are loud. It's a good family spot.   The food is chain style food Mexican flair food. The prices are good. I wasn't hungry this time. My cousin was starving tho. I just ordered a shot of vodka. With a chips and queso. The queso was good. Took a long time to get the queso. The waiter appologozed. My cousin ordered the grilled chicken mountain thingy. He ate the whole thing and said it was amazing.   Overall Cabo wabo is a solid spot. It's a chain like Hard Rock Cafe or a margaritaville . But different food. The food was good for the price. Nothing special tho. Give it a try. If you like beachy and rock",

This is the place for good food, good spirits and great people watching...even at 11:00 am on a Friday!  Our waiter was very attentive however misleading with his offerings on our drinks.  He said we'd get the souvenir cup with what I purchased then in the end said we didn't - had I known that we wouldn't have purchased it, that was the entire reason for the drink purchase.  We ordered the chips and salsa to start and they do refill it if you make it through it all - and we did as we had been traveling without eating all morning.  I ordered their flautas special and my hubby ordered one of their chicken specials.  Needless to say we ate all that as well and were ready to explore.  There is someone walking around, taking pictures of you and your party while eating then will give you a postcard to keep with the option of buying a bigger print.  She wasn't too thrilled that we weren't purchasing but after the promise of a souvenir cup not happening, I was good with what I got.  I highly recommend stopping by here when in Vegas.",

She was really great and friendly towards our group.  Now, upon waiting on the list for a table, we were met with an inconvenience. Long story short, we asked to speak to the on-duty manager. The managers name is Yesenia and she came in clutch. We were accommodated and she certainly bettered our experience with this establishment. Yesenia, you are The Real MVP!  Our server this trip was Sarah. She was really great and made great suggestions. Our group looks forward on having Sarah as our server again in the very near future. Thanks for your help Sarah. You are also The Real MVP! She also has some really kick A$$ tattoos :P  Aside from service being very excellent, the food itself was on point. We will make sure to make our return.

Unfortunately the good service stopped there. I found our server to be pretty rude and condescending. She was really sassy and talked to us like we were dumb for asking questions. My sister in law explained she had a credit and she was pretty rude when discussing that with her. And again when she asked for her burrito with no beans she said \" sweetheart that burrito doesn't have beans\" and not in a nice way, don't let the sweetheart fool you because it was very condensing like she was talking down to her and then continued with the same tone of voice as she was telling her what the burrito had when all she had to say was there's no beans! Then I asked if we get chips and salsa and she said \" ya if you order it\" it was just way to sassy, she answered every question with a sarcastic rude tone like we were stupid for even asking and it was very noticeable to us all and annoying.   Food:  Cobb salad- it was good, fresh and refreshing packed full of ingredients and the dressing was delicious as well.   Side of rice and beans were also good.   It was a satisfying meal, we were all happy with our food. Best place we've ever eaten? No but it hit the spot!",

I'm not sure as I'm from buffalo and corn is only good in the summer there.   The service was great considering how busy it was.  Their salsa is great so definitely get that if you're going to stop.

We sat outside, which was nice with some of the sun but under some covering.  We started with shrimp ceviche and a margarita; really nice and fresh, perfect for a hot day. She got barbacoa beef tacos, and I got fish and chips. The tacos came with standard beans and rice, and a few slices of lime on side, but they were really good. I think she got 3 tacos, and I had 4 pieces of fish. The fish were nice and crunchy and hot and juicy on the inside; the fries were comparable with most other places, and they were at least hot and crunchy, not stale nor too starchy.  It was some of the best food we had during the week, good price, no wait, and sits right on the strip, so great location. We'd definitely come back and try some more margaritas and other food :)",

They don't give you chips and salsa, The plates average about 18-25 dollars depending on what you get, I ordered the chicken enchiladas that were 18.95 for the plate and it came with two enchiladas rice and beans, I really was not impressed at all with the service I received, the waiter seen me once to drop the check off, Three stars for the view, Wish I would have ate somewhere else super disappointing in the experience and quality of what I got. Now that I live here I would not recommend.",

The view was excellent and service was very prompt and attentive.   We had the Cabo wabo margarita and now jealous we can't have one back home. Best drink we had during our stay!   We shared fajitas and we chose the chicken and carnitas mix. That didn't let us down either. We saw the next table over had the Mexican corn and we are now food jealous.   We were expecting the price to be outrageous because of location along and again we were surprised.   We will definitely go back when in town.",

My husband and I were a little tired and thirsty from the night before. We needed some water and food to get us through the day. We waited about ten minutes before a server came to just get our drink order, which was just water. We were ready to order, but they had to come back to get our order? Finally after another 15 minutes, he returned and got our order. Luckily the food came out super quick, then it was time for the check and we waited about 20 minutes for the check. For the price of breakfast compared to other places in Vegas, this place is awesome. For $10, you get eggs, bacon, toast and breakfast potatoes. And you have a nice view of the strip and hotels if you eat outside. I think they can do a bit better with the service though!",

    "text": "Originally my friend and I were craving burgers and fries and didn't feel like walking inside Planet Hollywood to look for Gordon Ramsey burgers.  She spotted Cabo Wabo Cantina outside of Planet Hollywood, across from where we were standing in front of the Cosmopolitan.   We head over to Cabo Wabo we were immediately seated on the patio facing the strip (choice of indoor or outdoor seating). We enjoyed people watching, some in their costumes collecting tips for a pic. Some were very creative like Olaf whom looked like a Cholaf, a Mickey Mouse regect, 2 minions and a couple Egyptian guys.   Our server comes by and takes our order. I ordered the carne asada plate and my friend orders the carnitas burritos. While waiting we're snap chatting away and I check in on YELP --- 1 FREE MARGARITA woot woot! Then 2 old men get seated next to us - and they were the same old men that wanted to take photos with us when we were at Bellagio. LOL it was funny... we should have gotten a tip for pic.  Any ways, our food arrives and we killed it!! Not cz we were super  hungry cz it was delicious!!! Yummm... the rice, beans and carne asada (3) were just perfect. I've started to appreciate avocados and my carne asada tacos had a slice on each one... made me super happy!  They had a live band playing behind us (more like a solo band). He was really good. He played his guitar maybe it was a Ukele and he was singing live robin thicke, Bruno mars, flo-rida, etc. He sang his version of the songs added a hint of Hawaiian island beat to it. I loved it!   Our server was ok ((less the one star)) She was nice to my friend and I but rude to the old guys sitting next to us. They would call her and say \"excuse me, excuse me\" she looks at them and keeps walking. RUDE! I felt so bad cz all he wanted was a cup of coffee. - Maybe cz he was smoking in the patio and no smoking was allowed. He probably didn't know, there wasn't a sign or anything.   Well this place is good for entertainment, food was good, vibe was great!",

Like New Orleans, the drinks got more expensive while the mixes got more sugar (less alcohol). Cabo Wabo is not one of those places. They stay competitive on the prices of the Vegas strip but the main thing is that you get what you pay for here! Alcohol! The mixes are delicious and the drinks are real.  The bartender was very friendly, had lots of energy, amazingly quick no matter how many customers they had, and had lots of fun while keeping the professional feel. That's amazing! We knew then, that Vegas only hired the best of the best.  We sat at the bar which is nicely situated facing the Bellagio fountains. It held an outdoor feeling without getting burned due to the architecture of the venue and had a fun energetic and interactive entertainer.  We had some light snacks which were surprisingly flavorful and innovative. Thanks! And thanks for taking a group pic of all of us with you guys included with our phone since you're the ones that made our vacation awesome! Great memories, Great times.",

I will never go there again. We were going to tip her but she told us $30 is additional tip required. Never again",

    "text": "Oh Cabo Wabo! I honestly can't say anything bad about this restaurant.  I came here Sunday night as this was one of the bars for my Las Vegas Club Crawl. The drinks were very good and strong just like I like it!   I seen people eating but didnt pay to much attention to it since my main mission was to drink and have a good time.  The next day I woke up and all I could think about was Cabo Wabo! I was trying to find good Groupon deals and spotted Cabo Wabo had a $15 for $30 worth of food. I was like two tears in a bucket, f*** it! We're going to Cabo Wabo!  It's walking distance from the Caesars Palace. Once I got there we were seated immediately outside near the heaters as it was very cold outside. I liked sitting outside on the patio because your able to see the water show from where your seating and eating.   The nice attractive server Stephanie asked us if we wanted to start off with a beverage and i instantly said margarita please! ;). Dont forget to check in to get your free margarita!   Everything on the menu looked good especially after looking at the pictures on Yelp. I ordered the appetizer of chips and salsa which was not expensive at all $3.95 you can not beat that especially for the amount that you get!  For my entree, I decided on the shrimp tacos and double rice since I'm not into the beans. I was very hesitant in ordering the chicken enchiladas because it looked very good as well but after talking to the server Stephanie she let me know that the shrimp tacos was a better choice.   Babe ordered a burrito which came with nacho chips on the side which were very good! The cheese that they use for their nachos were a plus!  I also liked that the drinks were very strong and tasty! They know exactly what to do to get you to buy more than one lol.   I would definitely recommend this if you're in the area of the miracle mile shop and looking for something to eat. They had many different things on their menu with a lot of good varieties you will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "We had been walking The Strip and were craving a sit down place that's family friendly.  Well the hostess said that Cabo Wabo was the perfect place for a family friendly dinner.  I didn't think that was probably the case since the word \"Cantina\" and alcohol mixing machines that flank the front of the restaurant don't exactly spell family friendly....HOWEVER, we were too hungry to care at that minute.    Ambiance - We sat inside (strictly for the a/c)...we found out real quick that we couldn't hear each other talking since the music was so loud.  I normally don't mind that if I'm with the girls drinking, but I was with my family and it was just annoying.  We ended up having a meal that the conversation consisted of \"what?!\", \"what?!\", \"can't hear you!\", \"never mind, tell you when we leave.\"  We ate in silence after that.    Food - The food was good.  We got cheese quesidillas that had tons of cheese in them.  Yay for the portobello fajitas!  Always nice for a vegetarian to see these on a tex-mex or mexican food menu.  They were very good.   We also ordered beans and rice which were good and a mojito that was very tasty, but had a few brown mint leaves in it which I took out before drinking.  Service - Service was friendly and the food came out quickly.  It slowed down a bit when we were trying to get a box and the bill, but that was since it had become very crowded and our waitress was slammed.  I would have given 3 stars, but since the music inside is so loud to where you can't have a conversation without shouting I gave it a 2 star rating.",

I went last night with a girl friend and our server was Homero. He was nice but really pushy. I'm currently over 9 months pregnant and it's pretty visible... My friend and I ordered waters and she got a soda, but the server went on and on about the margaritas for what seemed like a few minutes when we had already established that neither of us was going to be drinking. It was pretty busy but it took quite a while for us to get our water.   My friend ordered the tortilla soup and when they brought it out there was no spoon, so she politely asked for one. The food runner who brought out the soup and our server kept asking, \"Are you sure it's not on the side of your bowl?\" and frantically looking all over our table as if they've recently had a mass amount of spoon thieves? Weird.   The price of the food was as expected for being on the Las Vegas Strip. But $9 for some guacamole? Beat it! I should have brought my own avocados.  When the check came, Homero had no shame in handing it to us while very bluntly POINTING to the tip section and said, \"Here you go, ladies. And so you know, any tip is appreciated.\" At that point, it was tempting to not even leave a tip. That was pretty rude.",

Tonight everything changed.  I took my daughter and one of her sorority sisters out to eat and celebrate the end of finals week. Looking over the menu, I decided to have a Coors Lt. draft from the bar after seeing most beers on draught were $8 and then ordered my hamburger as I wasn't in the mood for what you would normally get at a Mexican restaurant. My daughter and her friend had water to drink and we also ordered queso and chips as an appetizer.  It was an unusually cool night dining outside, but I knew they had heaters outside and didn't think twice about it. We asked if they could turn on the heaters and wouldn't you know, all the heaters around us came on except the ones directly above us. We were later given an explanation of they were shorted out. Really? Don't know about others, but it made me want to leave as quickly as possible. (Props to our server who did move us to a warmer area, but it was still lacking and the only reason this review is not a one-star review).  When my beer did arrive, it came in an unusually large hurricane glass. When the bill did come, my $8 Coors Lt draft was now $18. Our party of 3 w/ 1 alcoholic drink and 2 waters was over $90. Again, I know eating on the strip isn't going to be extra cheap, but damn that's just gouging to be gouging to make $$$.  It was the last time I will pay to eat there.",

The food was average and tasted more like Chili's and was too pricey for the quality of food even by Las Vegas standards. I honestly wouldn't even recommend this place as a top 50 choice of restaurants in Las Vegas. And their margaritas were not even very strong, they weren't nasty but again they are Chili's quality.

Server was hardly seen and it took 10 minutes just to get drinks, and that was from another server who saw that we had been waiting for another while.   Also, they leave the doors open to outside. There was a serious breeze coming through which made it pretty cold. I would have much preferred to sit outside with a heater than inside with the cold!   Also, if your bill comes to $24.11 and you give them $25 they will automatically keep the change. Our bill came to $6.11 after our groupon and gave $10. We only got the bills back. Not cool.",

    "text": "After arriving in Vegas off of an early morning flight, we wanted to find a place to grab some quick lunch and where we could enjoy the beautifully hot and sunny weather.  We headed out from our hotel, Aria, and Cabo Wabo's patio fit the bill.  The second floor patio provided nice views of the Bellagio lake,and the misters under the umbrellas were an added bonus!  We started with some guacamole and queso which came with two huge baskets of corn chips.  The guacamole was ok, the cheese was really runny, and the chips were in tiny pieces which make dipping a challenge.  For mains, between us we had the Baja fish tacos, the jalapeno chicken, and the southwest cobb salad.  The chicken was a bit overcooked and dry, but the overall flavour was good and spicy.  The fish tacos featured grilled fish which was also a bit try, and they definitely weren't the best I'd ever had.  The salad looked great, and was a huge portion.  There definitely wasn't any food that would be worth returning for.  The prices were a bit expensive for what we got, particularly the $15 banana mama drink that was not that tasty.  The waiter was attentive, but was well versed in upselling, however not in a pushy way.  I wouldn't return, there are other restaurants in Vegas with equally decent patios that I would try first.",

So for those tired of going to upscale Vegas restaurants, this is a good place to chill and drink some frozen margaritas and relax.  Especially a good way to get out of the Vegas heat.  Order the Carne Asada tacos and it was nothing special.  Tacos were a little small but it was good.   But its no way it should be 17 dollars.  Anywhere else and this would be a taco plate appetizer.  Grabbed some shots of tequila that were $11 dollars as well.  Overall just a meh experience.   Again the 3 stars is generous because everything in Vegas is high.  And our waitress was really cool.  But otherwise it would be more towards that 2-2.5 range.",

Thought this place would have a similar vibe and offer quality food. Not quite....I'll be heading to Margaritaville in the future.   We sat on the patio...misters were nice in the 100+ temps. Waitress was nice...raucous, horrible sound from the karaoke bar was not so nice.   The fish tacos were bland , runny and the tortillas were on the brink of expiration. They just had zero flavor. My friend said her tacos were so-so. Didn't bother ordering drinks for I knew it was going to be a quick dinner.   I would have been better off at Del Taco (at least I would have pocketed some money to take to Sephora to buy some makeup or thrown the $50 in the slot machines).   Will not be returning.",

Liked the breakfast quesadillas. Also too expensive.  The scene is non-existent. But keep in mind, we were sitting inside because it was a cold night out. Warmer evenings overlooking the Bellagio fountains are probably superb.  Server was super friendly. Gave out a free shot for our birthday girl.  All in all, a good enough spot to eat.

    "text": "First off, let me start by saying do not come here expecting gourmet Mexican food; this is not the place to get it(try Lindo Michoacan off the strip if you are looking to find that). That said, I've eaten at many Mexican restaurants and Cabo Wabo is still among my top 3 restaurants. My husband and I come here about once a month and order the nacho platter or something similar. It is always consistent and amazing. Great for a quick bite to a eat.  The servers and bar are a completely different story. Of all the times I've been here, I have never seen a server, hostess, or bartender more than once. Obviously, they go through new staff on a very regular basis for a reason. You will not normally have to wait for your food as those are brought out by the food runners, but water, napkins, or any kind of condiments, GOOD LUCK! I normally just get up and head to the bar to get them myself.  Now onto the frozen drinks. The servers will tell you completely outright the frozen drinks are premade and not strong at all, so don't be surprised when this is indeed True. They do not try to upsell them to you, and while I appreciate that, Cabo Wabo should be doing something to rectify this. If your own waiters even try to sway the customers from purchasing them, you're not going to make a good profit on these. Up the alcohol! Fat Tuesday's is just a few steps away, and for a lower price you can get the best frozen drink the strip has to offer.  All in all, I do like this place. Great food, but the staff has a lot to work on. Lots of room for improvement here! Get on it Cabo!",

I have never eaten here so this review has nothing to do with the food...although it smelled delicious!  We sat in the back and all the tables were very, very close together.  So close that my chair was about an inch from the other table, it was hard to hang my coat on the back of my chair.  I understand it's a busy place located in the strip but I felt like I was trapped.  Our server arrived and he was very nice and animated.  We informed him that we were there for drinks ahead of time.  We had two mojitos and beer. The mojitos were delicious, but the beer tasted watered down, a little funny.  Overall it was a good experience, and the server was great.  I would go back to try the food but I would sit inside this time.  I hate feeling like I'm intruding on someone else's dinner!",

Freeness aside, it was pretty gross.  Round 2. Definitely the worst of the three. Our margaritas were SO disgusting, we had to make up drinking games just to chug them down. We NEVER complain about drinks...too strong, too weak, too warm...nothing really phases us. We finally added \"too tastes like they used the shaker that still had sour cream in it from two days ago,\" to the list, after much debate. Plus, the shake weight commercial kept playing, so we made the best of it.  Third and final. Nothing stood out as being especially bad. The food was eh. The service was eh. I just finally learned my lesson. The only redeeming quality this place has is that it's a good people-watching location.",

Along with relatively high prices, at least compared to the bargains you can get in the Miracle Miles cafes, the service is poor.  We have gone in the afternoon before, and they were having a frozen drink special, offering blue margaritas (very sugary, out-of-the-machine variety), for only $5. In terms of food, the tacos are $15 for a small portion, so we opted for only chips and salsa. For the higher price, you do have make a trade-off in terms of being right outside, on the Strip, able to watch the craziness of the Las Vegas tourist scene, while sitting soaking up some sun.",

Frustrating that they obviously substituted a lower quality booze in there to cut costs.  Generally that is at the manager level with pressure from above.  I wont be back until the fix it.  These are not cheap drinks!  More than enough margin to serve actual Cabo Wabo or such.",

It's the most important meal of the day, and Cabo Wabo had a damn good breakfast special. 2 eggs, bacon or sausage, potatoes, and toast usually sells for $9, but on my last trip it was on special for $4.99. Plus add a $4.99 bottomless mimosa special that lasted until 11, and the most important meal of the day gave me a happy happy buzz.  Consider that finding breakfast under $15 in a sit-down restaurant on the Strip is becoming difficult, this was a great discovery.",

The food and drinks are reasonably priced for Vegas and it's a great spot to sit out on the patio and chill for a few hours with a pitcher of beer (as long as you don't want to watch a game).

    "text": "Despite the name, a bit expensive and mediocre, but well located on a busy section of the Strip.  Come here so you can sit outside on the large deck, otherwise it's not worth seeking out.  Despite the proudly featured margarita ads and the house tequila being top-shelf Cabo Wabo, they had no drink list, and minimally described only 3 tequila-based drinks (which are available frozen, mentioned first).  They seemed much more interested in selling us beer.  Tortilla soup was decently spiced, but a little too salty and a little too thick.  Service was attentive to a fault (checking in with us every 5ish minutes).  The location, however, is quite awesome-- at a major crosswalk, across the street from new Aria, with a view of the booming fountains at Bellagio.  Good for taking in the strip while having a drink, if you sit outside.  They have some gas heaters on the deck for the winter, but this sort doesn't seem to give off much heat.  Doesn't seem like there'd be a view from inside.  I've been to the original Cabo Wabo Cantina in Los Cabos, which has better pricing, drink specials, and much much more atmosphere, if much less of a view.",

It was surprisingly a great experience and great food. You have a blocked view of the Bellagio water but I just loved watching crowds and crowds of people pass by. The band was great.  I received my free margarita upon checking-in on yelp. Margarita was very strong. I ordered the \"Jack & Coke BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger\" I have to tell you I wasn't expecting anything great but the first bite I fell in love with this Burger. I finished everything on the plate including fries which were also great.  Next time, I will be trying the Jack & Coke Ribs",

It was a cold Saturday night so when we saw open space by the heater, we decided to scoot our table ourselves.   I ordered the mushroom fajitas plate- I wouldn't recommend it. Partly my fault because after ordering it I realized how delicious can mushroom fajitas be?! And partly because the mushrooms were flavorless. It was not marinated and grilled that well.

    "text": "After strolling through the streets of Vegas, a common sight were people drinking \"adult slushies.\" At first i thought that these were virgin, until i continued to see empty beer and wine bottles everywhere.  I had to finally ask someone, \"can you drink on the streets here\" and they were like \"yes.\"  I was amazed,  and then it all made sense.  Seeing all of this, i started to crave a margarita badly.  After passing Cabo Wabo a few times, i thought that this would be an appropriate place to quench my thirst.  There was a slight wait to get into the cantina, but the outdoor elevated patio was worth the wait.  Upon being seated our server told us that they were out of menus, so we just asked for a margarita and a mojito.  We started with some chips and salsa.  The salsa had a really smokey background, but not that much flavour.  Shortly after our drinks came, after taking one sip, we both realized that these were very water downed drinks.  We were both very unsatisfied with the drinks, mine literally tasted like just a lime slushie, no alcohol.  We basically just wrote off the night as a poor restaurant pick, but then our bill came.  My drink was $10 and my sisters was $14, i have never felt so ripped off.  I think that is why Cabo currently has a low Yelp rating, because people are feeling ripped off.  Overall, i would not come back here, because i believe it is a tourist trap.  They are banking on the one time diner, versus the returning diner.",

    "text": "So I came with low expectations, this is a place I normally would not go to since it's not my style and I'm rarely on the strip. However Chris told us about some specials and I love hanging with my group of Yelpies so I came along.   The staff is awesome at this place!  Firstly, they went above the notch in honoring a drink special that was only for the 4th but we mistakenly thought was ongoing. Thank you to the manager, Roland, who was very nice in doing this for us and for checking in on us a few times in the night.   Our server was spot on. Seriously- we were checked on often, water cups never empty, chips and salsa never empty until we friggin' were so stuffed and saying \"no more!!!\". Some of the best service I've had in a long time so a shoutout to Donnie.   Sometime in the night they put on the \"Mas Tequila\" song and were giving out free shots at the bar. No glass here, the dancing ladies poured it into your mouth and poured as much as your mouth can handle. I dont know how often this happens.  I had a 2 for 1 frozen margarita (this is from a coupon) and got a regular margarita and a pina colada though there were a few other flavors to choose from (strawberry daquiri, orange creme and peach I think). It was hot on the patio and hey, I'm at a place called Cabo Wabo so might as well drink something beach-y. They weren't very strong, I probably wouldn't buzz if I didn't get the big shot of Tequila at the bar. They were refreshing none the less so for $10, it was not bad at all.  I wasn't feeling like eating something heavy (I was waiting for my BF to have dinner with) so I was just drinking and noshing on chips, but I took a bite of my buddy Nins chicken taquitos and dipped them in a cheese sauce. They were actually decent and the chicken was juicy. I think most of the food seems ok. I wouldnt go as a local out of my way to drive down there, but you're in the area, it might be fine.   If you like Tex- Mex food, Sammy Hagar/classic rock blasting and a unpretentious atmosphere, a patio to people watch (and watch the Bellagio fountains) this might be a place for you.  I wasn't expecting to have a good night based on the negative reviews of service, but I am pleasantly surprised.",

The carnitas sopes came two on a plate with black beans and rice. The sopes had NO flavor to them. Zip. Zilch. Nada. They had to be covered in salsa and queso to even make it tolerable. Our waitress was nice, she was new, but getting drinks took an act of Congress.  Once the margaritas came, we had to ask 3 times for water, that seemed to take the longest.  On a Thursday afternoon??  Really??  I think they were bringing it in by the bucketful from the Hoover Dam.  I've been to Cabo Wabo in Cabo and we enjoyed ourselves and the service; and even though I didn't think it was possible, this one in Vegas both sucked AND blew.",

People everywhere celebrating Halloween, so was fun to watch.  Cocktails there were lovely, especially the freshly made pina colada - a definite hit!  My husband ordered the steak burrito and said it was lovely.  Nice big chunks of meat and a good flavour.  I ordered the prawn in lime appetizer as wasn't too hungry.  Prawns were lovely and fresh but the whole dish tasted so strongly of lime I couldn't finish the meal - it was so over powering!  The paella rice was lovely and moist and fresh.  When the bill came it turned out she had given us the main course option of the prawn and rice dish, when I specifically asked for the small appetizer version.  We did wonder why it was so large - but left it as you can never tell with some portion sizes.  I would have rated it higher had it not been for the appalling lime flavoured prawn dish and the bar girl serving and charging us for the wrong size.  I would recommend this place for a drink.",

There ended up being about a dozen of us, and while the hostess earlier in the day told me that any groups over 6 couldn't be seated together on the Patio, but Roladno the manager made sure we had a place for the crew.  Donnie our waiter was one of the best I have had in a while, he took care of the entire crew and even took care of some minor issues we had.  I booked the UYE there because the las vegas advisor said they had $1 drafts from 9-11p, well when we got there they said it was just for the 4th, but after explaining to them that we have scheduled the event based on that happy hour, they decided to honor it for us. (thanks again guys for going above and beyond)  I personally didn't order anything off the menu (liquid dinner FTW), the few things I sampled were really good.  My only major complaint was that the misters on one of the umbrellas was broken so only about 1/4 of the group had misters, but that is about the only complaint I have.  I would recommend the place, the food is decent, the drinks are good (bonus we got free Cabo Wabo shots at the bar during a Hagar Song), and the staff will go the extra mile, on the strip you can easily do worse, but it's hard to find better",
