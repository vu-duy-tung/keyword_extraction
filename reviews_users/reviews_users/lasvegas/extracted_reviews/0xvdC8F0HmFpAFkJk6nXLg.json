The broth was sweet and delicious and the beef was so tender. We weren't sure about dipping the beef in raw egg after you cook it in the broth but it was surprisingly good. It balanced out the sweetness from the broth. Afterwards you can put your veggies and noodles in the broth to make some soup. :) cant wait to come back.",

Presentation is on point with the color and marbling of the meats looking just as good as they taste. Definitely recommend sukiyaki style with the raw egg to dip your food in (adds richness).  For dessert we had ice cream. Server recommended a purple ube (yam ice cream). Actually pretty good. Vibrant purple color with interesting flavor. I'm sure we will be back slot especially when winter hits.",

It's a diy cooking concept in a hot pot and self seasoning of sauces and broth so if you're lazy, don't come here. I had the spicy miso, yojie cut geisha size, brown rice, and chose goma and an egg as my dipping sauces. I usually get the egg when I have the sukiyaki broth but I decided to try it with the spicy miso since I love dipping into the raw egg. It is on the pricey side for shabu but this is like the only legit shabu place in Vegas so I'm willing to pay more for good shabu. I'm from Cali so I'm used to dinner shabu regular size being $20 or less. Overall, I would recommend this place and would come again. Meat tasted fresh, goma sauce was perfect consistency, they accommodated to my replacements on veggies I didn't like, servers were knowledgable, their green tea infuser is neat to use, and they had an ice cream flavor that tasted like taro! It's a must get.",

Well let just say everything was subpar! My veggies were old and rotting, the meat I ordered (yojie's cut) looked old with brown spots and what was suppose to be upgraded meat (prime rib) that my wife ordered was more fat than meat! Our server spent more time talking with her friends who were right next to us the servicing us! She even commented on how expensive the Kobe beef and wagyu was at this place and they should try it some where else! I mean really! (We had actually considered ordering it to try it, thanks for sharing that!), don't get me wrong not everything was bad, the sukiyaki with the dripping egg  was awesome (never tried it b4), and the place looked amazing! Yet I always told myself I wouldn't write a negative review unless it was totally merited and this place unfortunately did deserve this review. Sorry yojie",

    "text": "So I finally got a chance to hit this place up and see what all the fuss was about. It was an easy choice for a late birthday celebration as it is right down the street from me and I heard alot of really good things about it. I have to say the service was great and vibe of the place is inviting, modern and fun. The wait staff was really friendly and informative on the choices and on how to get the most out of the experience there. They have plenty of choices although I felt a bit confused on how they compartmentalized the different combinations. I just went with the one that appealed to me the most which was the strait forward shabu shabu option. After going ahead and diving into to the hot pot style dinner, I thought the food was good and the process was pretty fun. At the end we tried the condensed broth after it reduced down with all of the flavors of the vegetables and it tasted a bit flat. Gladly our waitress saw us desperately dousing our dirty water broth with soy sauce and offered a bit of udon soup base that we gladly accepeted. After lacing the boiling water with some of the base it was a compellingly improved product. Overall, I enjoyed it for what it is and recommend it to anyone looking to try shabu shabu for a date night or celebration dinner. For the same price though, Shabu grill in henderson offers much more variety, and it's all you can eat. That being said, yojie is much more attractive of a setting and might be a better bet if you're trying to make an impression on someone special.",

I used to work at a hotpot restaurant, but Yojie in particular is very affordable and I love how it comes with a bowl of vegetables. Lots of vegetables. The lunch special ranges from about $11-20 which is a great deal! When I went the first time with my friend, the service was amazing. But I must say that the second time I went with my mom, the service was horrible. My waitress barely checked up on us, but when she did, she didn't ask if we needed anything else, or if we were okay. She just picked up some of our plates and went back to go talk to her friend that was sitting by the register. Although the service that time sucked, the food was delicious!!

    "text": "Alright...it kind of pains me to have to write a 3 star review for yojies because I love the Socal locations.  I'm from Orange County and am currently in Vegas for a week so I decided to stop by for lunch.  I didn't want rice or noodles so they gave me a custom veggie bowl with mainly cabbage (or was it lettuce?) and broccoli.  As expected, I didn't receive any rice or noodles but also unfortunately didn't receive any extra broccoli either, just the usual 1-2 in each veggie bowl so I asked for some extra broccoli.  The meal was fine, just that the chicken I ordered was paper thin (what is this...chicken for ants?!).  -1 star  The server was friendly and chatted with me as I dined all by my lonesome.  The meal was fine and so I asked for the check... Remember that extra broccoli that I asked for? Well, I was charged 3.99 for them!    It's USUALLY NOT about the money but about the principle. In this case it was BOTH.   MONEY: $4 for some extra broccoli?  That's just criminal LOL  PRINCIPLE: If the server told me it was $4, I would not have gotten it.   At the end of the day, it comes down to, \"Did I leave with a good feeling after the meal?  Did I enjoy the meal?\".  It's either yes, no, or meh.  Honestly, I didn't feel good about the meal I just had.  When that's the case, I really want to give 1/5 stars, but I that's not a fair assessment.  You know that feeling you get when something doesn't feel right and you just have to say something? This was one of them.",

    "text": "TL;DR: If you don't like Jo Koy's stand up, that's okay because I don't either and I like this place. Lol jk.   What can I say, this place makes my 'ting ting' happy. And by that I mean my stomach, you sick people you. Came here cause not only did I hear it was good, but also the fact I heard Jo Koy owns this place. When I'm not busy supporting him at thunder valley casino, I thought I should support him by visiting his restaurant.   Anyways, came in and this place was nicely kept. It was clean and the ambiance was modern. We came in pretty late, so we were seated quickly.   Food: We got the sukiyaki and the spicy miso broth. For meats we got the standard one (forgot what it's called) and the Kobe beef. With the sukiyaki you get a raw egg to dip the meat in after it's cooked, and don't look at me sideways my g, y'all know you eat dirtier things raw then an egg. I love sunny side up eggs so the raw egg doesn't bother me and it made the food that much better. The sukiyaki broth was good, it was salty and sweet. The only thing is since it's heated for a while the sugar burns and then when it's refilled it gets more concentrated cause they just add more of the same thing and it gets super sweet. Id ask for some water to put in there each time it's refilled. The spicy miso was pretty good, but nothing too out of the ordinary. The sauces that came with it were pretty standard too to what you'd get at other shabu shabu place, but none the less they were good. The meat was delicious and the servings were large and reasonably priced.   Service: The service was amazing. They were so personable and easy to talk to. If you're reading this Jo Koy the girl with the tattoos that's originally from SoCal did a good ass job with helping us so you better pay her more lol.   Anyways, I'm def going to come here more often whenever I'm in Vegas. If you're new to shabu shabu this is definitely the place to start.",

    "text": "Quality cuts of meat with old school jams playing in the background!  I always get the combo that comes with the Yojie cut (angus beef) and one other choice of meat (usually pork) and I always leave stuffed.  Every combo comes with a bowl of noodles/veggies for the hot pot as well.  The one thing, I don't really like is the extra up charge for the broths.  The one that doesn't come with a charge seems like just hot water...so I've never even tried it.  Our favorites are the sukiyaki with the pasteurized egg.  Pull the meat out of the pot, dip in the egg, and pair it with a little rice...perfect bite!  Rice refills are free here for the rice lovers out there!  The spicy miso broth is a second favorite.  FYI, you can do split pots and have spicy miso and sukiyaki, best of both worlds!  Our favorite drink here is the bottomless green tea arnold palmer.   One of the only cons, not the best place for a large group, since it's counter seating in a circle.",

Don't get me wrong, I get that you have to tweak the broth and dips to flavor up the meats and soup, but I like that Yojie offers an upgraded and more intense flavored broth with their Tonkotsu option. Their Tonkotsu broth is richer and has a nice fuller flavor than the other broth options.  Besides the broth, I really enjoyed their signature beef option. It was tender but also added more depth to the broth. The vegetables that come with are plentiful, and service is attentive. If you like spicy, ask for their hot stuff - you only need a dab to turn on the heat.   I look forward to their expansion and hope they come to the Southwest!",

    "text": "We find ourselves in this part of town quite a bit, (I used to work at a place further down West Sahara, and one of the dispensaries I go to is on the same street), and though we'd been to several stores and restaurants in the area, Yojie is one we'd never been to.  And I was SO glad we went!  Although I had heard the term \"shabu-shabu\" before, (not to be confused with the excellent INXS album \"Shabooh Shoobah\",) I had no idea what it was, and being in the mood for something 'different', we ventured in.  Nice, clean place with a great design, and counters on either side of the restaurant.  If I recall correctly, the name of the wait person who helped us was Amanda, (and I only remember because one of my good friends from Dallas is also named Amanda), and she was great to talk to, as well as more than a little helpful in assisting us with navigating the intricacies of \"shabu shabu\" cooking and dining. Up until this point, fondue to me was a chafing dish filled with melty cheese or chocolate mixtures, that you dipped various things into.  Same principal here, except now it's savory and sometimes sweet hot sauces and broths that you douse paper-thin sliced meats and assorted veggies into.   We found the whole process strange, but fun. Bear had a little trouble with the chopsticks at first, but they don't leave you hanging if you can't seem to \"get it.\"  It's been a while since our first visit, and with my birthday coming up, I'm thinking, \"Why not?\"  Highly recommended for both the adventurous and the health-conscious foodies.",

As I dipped my raw meat into the broth and then rubbed it in a raw egg mixture, my instinct was to run away and avoid some illness, but the egg gave the meat a wonderful sweet flavor.   We were so stuffed that we had to return another day to try the dessert fondue.  Which we recently did. It was great too.  Loved the bananas with the green tea white chocolate.  The Japanese ice coffee was wonderful too.  This please is great.  Food, atmosphere and service all a big plus.",

He was very nice and made sure everyone was comfortable while waiting for a table. 2 for 1 Sapporo. My husband and I shared the Samurai sizes Prime Rib Plate with Sukiyaki dip and vegetables, noodles, and white rice. The boys shared a Combo Plate with Chicken and Angus Beef and Tonkotsu dip. The girls shared a Combo Plate with Chicken and Angus Beef and Spicy Miso dip. I tried all of them with the different dips and my mouth was watering. The food was absolutely delicious. With barely any room left for dessert we still had to order one. We shared Milk Chocolate Fondue with strawberries and bananas. We will definitely be dining here again.

You have a choice between sitting at the low bar and the high bar and we decided to go with the low bar. Beware, the chairs make a loud screeching sound if dragged on the floor. There's also a few televisions to watch while eating.   The decor is simple yet very unique. There are various pieces of art on the north wall done on usps boxes.   I decided to get the yojie cut, shabu shabu pot with ponzu and swisher dipping sauces, and brown rice. This also comes with a little bowl of vegetables and noodles, which was pretty much 2 slices of carrot, some onion, udon noodles, thin glass noodles, one piece of broccoli, one large mushroom cap, two cubes of tofu, and some lettuce. I would've preferred some more veggies and meat.   For drinks, I got the tiramisu blend hot tea. It has a very unique savory taste to it, which I enjoyed. The refill came in this contraption where you place on top of your cup and it'll pour out of the bottom.   Service was great, the server explained everything clearly, mixed garlic and green onion into our dipping sauces, and we were often checked on to see if everything was ok.",

Great setup, upscale, great service, no nonsense, \"we are not joking about this\" kind of place. You get all the info you need to order, I got the Sumo kobe and my wife got the Geisha Yojie cut and the quality of meats and ingredients is top notch.

    "text": "Could you open a Yojie in Austin, TX? I'm going to miss you so much! I wasn't sure what to expect for my first shabu shabu experience but I was impressed, and full by the time I left.   We walked in just a few minutes after Yojie had opened for the day. There were already two parties waiting when we sat down, and another party came in and sat at the high bar as well. The two waiters had a little bit of trouble keeping up with all of the parties, as we all ordered at once, but the atmosphere was fairly casual so it just felt paced. We watched the Japanese TV shows they had playing that were interesting, and enjoyed the space in general. They were more than happy to explain options and describe choices and let us take a little bit of time choosing. Meanwhile, they took our drink orders - a green tea and an Arnold Palmer-san, both of which were really good.   We ended up choosing the following:   One Combo plate, (included Kobe beef) with Kurobuta pork and Tonkatsu, (the pork broth), and one Geisha sized Kurobuta pork and Tonkatsu. We asked a bunch of questions about the Tonkatsu, as it wasn't clear on the menu whether it was made with milk or not. It's not - when they say creamy on the menu, it is because it looks creamy and has a creamy texture because of the pork, but no milk is used. They set out our bowls and got our broths going on the induction stoves in their bowls while we waited. The thin sliced meat came out on square plates, and the veggies came out in a slanted bowl - all gorgeously arranged, and with generous portions. The veggies included: a big mushroom, lots of tiny white mushrooms, a lettuce leaf, rice noodles, other wider noodles, a ginger slice, cubes of tofu, carrots, broccoli, and onions. We also received a bowl of rice. By then our broths were ready. Before we started, our waiter came over with tongs and ladles and asked if we had any questions. We started loading our broths with veggies and meats, watching them simmer and stirring. We both decided to let our veggies stew for a while, and we started on our meats.   This slow process took quite a while... putting in more veggies, letting them simmer, having a little meat, ladling out a little broth for our veggies...stirring the broth. At some point, somehow we had eaten all of the things and we were just down to the broth. The waiter came by and turned off our stoves so that the broth could cool. This was honestly my favorite part, as the thickened broth at the end was amazing. We sat and slowly sipped our broths for a while and finished them, it was so good. We absolutely loved it.  I'd also like to mention their bathrooms - they don't seem like much when you go in there - lots of grey concrete, and they're pretty cold. The sink, however, is a wide waterfall that you turn on that is SO COOL. Check it out!  For what we ordered, we paid about $65 including tip. While it was a bit expensive, it was still really worth it for the experience and the portion sizes. Like I said in the beginning of my review, I'd really love to see Yojie open a location in Austin. When we got back home, we looked for shabu shabu places and there's only ONE here. Food for thought, Yojie! ;) Thank you for being fantastic.",

Me and my boyfriend eat shabu shabu a looott that when we moved here we were so disappointed because vegas didn't really have any good shabu places that after a while we just went and bought our own shabu pot and made it at home. I'm so glad they opened a location here! We had an amazing experience here. The service was amazing, manager and waitress and literally everyone were very attentive and so enthusiastic!  Okay for food, Let me just say, you need to order their green tea chocolate fondue desert! It is delicioussss!! Also the salmon was sashimi grade so you can even eat it raw. They slice it thin, which I like. They are new so when we went they weren't able to serve alcohol yet but I can't wait to come back and try their drinks next time!! :)",

I always go with the beef and salmon mixed with the spicy miso. If I had to choose 1 it would be the Kobe beef for sure. Make sure to get your sauces mixed and save room for dessert. I highly suggest the fruit and pastry fondue green tea with white chocolate. I will be back soon.",

This time I got the combo which i notice is a whole lot better deal! In the combo you get a 5pz (geshia) of the yojie cut and the choice of either: pork belly, salmon, chicken or pork. Just for a couple of bucks more than the regular yojie cut. So more bang for your buck!!  And always got the green tea white chocolate matcha! ^.^",

Customer service was off...  Our server was friendly & bubbly but she kept on messing up our orders, forgetting to bring us what we asked for, just a mess!  But the food, man the food, was worth dealing with it.  Yojie's Cut:  A must order!  Phenomenal cut of beef! Kobe Beef:  Delicious & tender! Sukiyaki (side of egg for dipping):  A sweet & savory broth!  So darn tasty!  I have been to several Shabu Shabus & this is by far the best dips!  What is unique is the egg.  They crack open an egg, scramble it, & after you cook your meat in the dip, you dip it again in this raw egg scramble.  Amazing! Raindrop:  Okay... do not order this.  It literally tastes like nothing.  Imagine water as a jello, BINGO!",

    "text": "I came here twice for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed the place. It's a tiny place with modern decor. The first time I came here, the TVs were showing horse racing and the second time was showing another sport. The music choice here is a bit odd as they play a mixture of 90s and 2000s music and it doesn't feel like it fits/matches the aura of the place.  The first time I came here, I ordered the spicy miso broth and the vegetable medley (I asked for the mushrooms replaced with something else) with ponzu and goma sauces and a side of brown rice. I also ordered the cherry blossom tea because it was something very new and unique-sounding so I had to try it. The cherry blossom tea tasted like green tea. I was confused, thinking maybe they gave me plain green tea but as I drank more, I could taste a hint of something else. However, whatever it was, became overpowered by a green tea flavor.  Melanie (I think that's her name) was our server and she was awesome. She was always smiling and happy, always checking in making sure everything was okay, if we needed anything else, and overall gave really good customer service.   The second time I came, I ordered the exact same thing (I don't have other options as a vegetarian) but with Japanese iced coffee instead of cherry blossom green tea. The Japanese iced coffee tasted like plain iced coffee but with what tasted like brown sugar? It's a subtly sweet flavor, not what I expected, but I didn't hate it either and I'd order it again.   This time, Azi was our server. She wasn't friendly and had a bit of an attitude. She didn't care to ask us about our meal or check in on us. She would walk by without saying anything but would check in with other guests. Very different from Melanie's customer service. However, this one server, a guy named Shannon, started to check in on us and he was extremely kind and more than willing to help us if we needed anything. He checked in on us a number of times, always asked if we needed more broth or wanted more water, he was superb. He even offered to take our pots to the back and put them in to-go containers and wrap them up for us! I was shocked at his willingness to do such a thing for us, and I was so happy to see that level of customer service. He even marked one of the containers so I'd know which one was mine.   For my food, I was skeptical to try a miso broth because I grew up eating miso soup a lot (I come from an Asian family) and couldn't imagine eating it as a spicy hot pot broth. I was, however, pleasantly surprised at the flavor and enjoyed every bite of it. I was also very happy with the portions given for the vegetable medley because, as a vegetarian, that was all I could eat there and it filled me up nicely.  We were only allowed to pick two of the three different sauces which saddens me because in Hawaii, we're used to having 10 - 20 different sauce options that we can pick from freely and even mix and match sauces to create our own unique sauces.   For dessert, we ordered the milk chocolate fondue with \"berries and bananas\" (strawberries and bananas). I had some expectations of the fondue since it's in the name of the restaurant but there wasn't anything special or unique about it. Yojie might benefit from doing something unique or special to their fondue because, in reality, it is plain fondue (it is, after all, called Yojie Japanese Fondue, so do something unique with it).   I hope management acknowledges the customer service skills of Shannon and Melanie because they were so attentive to us. Melanie even remembered us the second time we came back! I will continue to come back here again but I'd hope to not get Azi as our server again.",

    "text": "I've had Japanese hot pot maybe four times, two of which were at Yojie. So far, I've tried the tonkotsu and sukiyaki broths with Yojie's cut (beef) and chicken. I prefer the tonkotsu over sukiyaki as the sukiyaki broth was a bit too sweet for me. Though, I did enjoy the pasteurized egg to dip the meats in when I had the sukiyaki broth. It was a good combination and added a buttery flavor to the meat after being cooked in the sweet broth. My husband chose the spicy miso broth both times and it is great for all the spice lovers. It's not overly spicy, but if you want an extra kick, ask for the ghost pepper sauce. Seriously, you only need maybe two drops of it and it can be added to any broth.   The cuts of meat are a good portion because you're also given a bowl of assorted vegetables and udon plus a cup of rice. The first time I had Yojie's cut with chicken and it was a lot for me that I had leftovers. The second time, I chose Yojie's cut, geisha size (5 oz) and it was the perfect amount of meat for me. You also have a choice of two dipping sauces. I chose the goma and ponzu sauce. The ponzu sauce had a better flavor in my opinion.   On the second trip, hubs ordered the green tea white chocolate fondue with strawberries and bananas. I tried a bite and the blend of green tea with white chocolate was surprisingly amazing. Even if you aren't a green tea fan, it's definitely worth a try.   This place is also good for those on a low carb diet as I currently am. I skipped the rice and had just a bit of udon, but mostly the veggies with the meat and was full enough.  I can't wait to return and try other meats with the broths, maybe the pork belly, also their teas and other desserts when I'm not limiting my caffeine and carbs.",

I ordered the Yojie's cut Angus with the spicy miso broth and the ponzu and goma sauces, and it was unbelievable! The flavors were so good, the quality of the ingredients was on point and the portion was ample!  I'm not sure why other reviewers said they skimped on vegetables, I found that there was plenty of everything and I ended leaving stuffed from the lunch portion.  I wish I had paid attention to the servers name, she was so friendly and helpful, especially when I told her I'd never had this style of dining before.  I would LOVE to come back here again if I'm back in the neighborhood...SO GOOD!",

The servers do an excellent job explaining the whole shabu shabu process thoroughly. I recommend getting their sukiyaki w/ Yojie's cut. I ordered the Geisha size (which is a medium) and the portion amount is enough to feel full but not bloated. The pasteurized egg that comes with it is sooo good to dip in with the meats. The sukiyaki broth is great too too - it has both a sweet and savory flavor to it. Save room for the green tea white chocolate fondue w/ fruits at the end.",

It is very interactive as you cook your own food in a broth of your choosing and you get a pick selection of meats you can choose from and you get a bunch of vegetables with whatever meat you choose from.    Also as an added bonus if you like more than one broth you can get both!  They give you a bowl that a a tray in the middle that separates the broths.  This place is good for groups but you are sitting at a bar so you will be sitting in a straight line no face to face so that is something to consider if you area trying to do a social outing.   This place is amazing and I go here all the time and I am always telling my friends to go as well.  I would recommend to where long pants because the seats are metal and can get really cold.

The set up in here is great and everything looks clean and well organized. Take some time to admire the awesome pics along the wall.   The menu is nice and simple which is typically a good sign for any place. You basically pick your type and quantity of meat and then the broth you'll be dipping in. I chose the Yojie Cut beef and the spicy miso broth. The meat is accompanied by a bunch of veggies and noodles as well as a bowl of rice. The spicy miso itself is a great soup and just the right amount of spiciness. As for the beef, its thinly sliced high quality meat that cooks in mere seconds when dropped into the delicious broth. Everything goes great together for a great light yet filling meal. I recommend the ponzu and swisher sauce.   The specialized tea infusers are pretty neat, and the tea is high quality. For dessert, don't miss out on the Ube (Taro) ice cream! I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the menu.   P.S. For a bit of a bargain, I'd recommend coming here during lunchtime, its a little cheaper for the same amount of meat.",

Dont get the $2 egg, doesn't add anything to the flavor. Would have given 4 stars, but dessert was horrible. $8 for average chocolate and \"pastries and fruit\" which ended up being super small slices of banana and strawberry and frozen pound cake.

We ordered the sukiyaki and the broth was overwhelmingly sweet. I understand everyone has a different flavor palette and for my boyfriend and I, we just couldn't tolerate the broth. I diluted it many times with water and I still couldn't pass the sweetness. If you like a broth that's very sweet then the sukiyaki is the way to go. The portions are definitely decent. The ambiance was interesting. The music was a bit loud and I felt like I was at a nightclub even though it was daylight but I think that ambiance would be good for anyone wanting a quick bite to eat before heading out to paint the town red.",

Tables and menus are dirty,  It's a shame I liked this place (atmosphere and food).   We gave it another chance last night and I am happy to say the service is 100x better.  Thank you for your improvement!!!   The owner even stop by and introduce himself then ask if everything was good.   Nicely done",

    "text": "Do not go here if you are not prepared to start obsessing about the different soup bases and combinations. They only offer a few selections and choices, and each is essentially perfect. The Tonkatsu Base in my opinion is heaven in a bowl. Combined with the fresh veggies, and amazing salmon, pork belly, Kobe Beef, or Wagyu Beef (your choice) produce a meal in which you will remember for time to come. It is the type of place that ruins your old standby spot to Shabu Shabu, no more Yoji has taken it to the next level.  Combined with the amazing staff and those beautiful smiles you can't go here just once. You immediately start to wonder if you ordered the correct combination of sauces and meats, or could added too little or too much sesame. Can you achieve the perfect soup base to which your life will change forever? These are epic goals that you get to experiment with in this amazing little spot.   Only downside? It is cold in there this time of year. You will start to wonder if you are exhibiting the symptoms of hypothermia, and then in just the nick of time, one of the beautiful Geishas of Yoji, drop off a cart of magical food and turn on the lifesaving tiny heat source. The burner will eventually boil your soup base, producing a steaming caldron that lets you know, you are going to make it. Then you start the process of filling your slightly frozen body with the heavenly bliss of hot soup and the experience is divine.   Highly recommend this place and in fact, I want to go there right now.",

    "text": "I honestly can't say enough positive things about the experience my girlfriend and I had tonight. I arrived in Vegas at 9 PM after a long five hour drive from Phoenix, and after checking into my hotel I hit up Yelp for a recommendation for late night dining. I'd never had Japanese fondue before, but after looking at the menu and reading the stellar reviews, my girlfriend and I headed out.   We arrived at a beautiful little restaurant in a quiet shopping center (though it's probably busier before 10 PM) and upon walking in were greeted by a cheerful hostess, fun, modern decor, and a sparkling clean dining area. Unexpectedly, the owners, phenomenal stand-up comedian Jo Koy and his business partner Anton Guerrero, were there, and after a mildly embarrassing star-struck handshake, Jo graciously offered to order for my girlfriend and I.   I wound up with the samurai portion of kobe beef with  shabu shabu and sukiyaki. Everything was delicious, but the kobe beef cooked in the sukiyaki and then dipped in the pasteurized egg is particularly incredible. My girlfriend had the steak and salmon combo with sukiyaki and miso (both of which were tasty as well) and Jo bought us dessert, the green tea and white chocolate fondue. Even with a couple of premium items on the tab (and a delicious coconut sake), we walked out for less than $100 including tax and a 20% tip. It should be noted, however, that you could easily walk away satisfied for half that price with more basic options (though the kobe beef was worth every penny).  The food alone was worthy of five stars, but the service and attention to detail were stellar as well. The wait staff were attentive and helpful as they taught us newcomers how to prepare our food and offered much appreciated tips along the way. Jo and Anton also went out of their way to make us feel welcome and provided a lively, engaging atmosphere fueled by Jo's inherent wit along with some surprisingly earnest and introspective conversation. They showed a genuine interest in our story and made us feel immediately welcomed and at ease.   We talked, we laughed, we ate, and ultimately my girlfriend and I walked away with a five star dining experience that we will never forget. Thank you so much to Jo, Anton, and the rest of the staff at Yojie for a wonderful evening. I couldn't recommend it more.",

We did NOT see Jo Koy but definitely coming back for more of their food. Service was great. Everyone were cheerful and very helpful. Their art wall were all from a local artist, J Muniz which is all cartoon- like character that's wearing a rabbit suit. And the food....mmm! The food!I had the prime rib with the seaweed soup but surely will try a different kind of soup. The beef is tender and the vegetables were all fresh and not frozen. It was an excellent experience. It just hit the right spot. I'm sure to come back here for the food now and if I get to see Jo Koy, he will be just a plus to my visit! lol",

Myself plus three came in and signed in at 7:11 p.m. I briefly spoke with the individual and asked if we will be called. He said, \"Yes, we will call you.\" We went to the coffee shop next door and around 8:00 p.m., we went back in to notice every other party that came in after us have been seated.  We asked the hostess to be seated ASAP as we saw seats were open. I'm pretty sure she should be spoken to by management as her behavior was unacceptable. She said, \"I am going to seat these people first who came in after you first.\" I said, \"Do you see any logic or sense in doing that as we were skipped twice already without being contacted? The gentleman said he would call us when we are up.\" She responded with, \"No it doesn't and I understand, but I told these people I am seating them first even though you came in an hour ago.\" I was so dumbfounded... What a disaster!",

I saw the sign-in book and signed us in but the others may naturally walked to all the open seats.  The place only had a few people.   It was all very odd and made everyone quite uncomfortable to be lectured life that after just walking in to a new restaurant. . We just turned and left.

Our server attended to us right away and gave us a minute to look over the menu (Mind that we haven't been here for a year or so). They recently got their alcohol license, but from what our server said they're only serving beer at the moment until they take their class to serve sake. Upon ordering my girlfriend got the yojie cut in the smallest portion. I got myself the combo plate which consisted of the yojie cut and your choice of Chicken, salmon, pork, and pork belly. I chose the pork belly. Their offered vegetables such as broccoli, lettuce, half of a white mushroom, shitake mushrooms, carrots, onions, while also offering tofu, seaweed, udon and glass noodles. After they offer either white or brown rice. Then you choose your pot. They offer the original shabu-shabu broth that has a very light miso flavor, the sukiyaki broth, spicy miso, and pork broth. Me and my girlfriend both got the sukiyaki! With the sukiyaki they offer a pasteurized egg as a dipping sauce. It goes REALLY well with the broth and meat. I always pace myself because I eat a lot of rice with my whole meal.   After our dinner we got the green tea white chocolate fondue desert plate with fruits and strawberries. My girlfriends FAVORITE.  Yojie never disappoints. That is all.",

Service was really good and I didn't realize at the time that you can order a combination Geisha size and get another Geisha meat item for just $6 more!

We could not stop eating. I loved it, the kids loved it... Pretty tough to do these days.  Was a little on the pricey side but definitely high quality and well worth it. We ordered the Samurai for my son and I. We had extra ponzu sauce and rice. Ended the meal with the fruit and pastry fondue. Order the green tea white chocolate sauce.",

    "text": "We kept hearing about Yojie Shabu Shabu on the Koy Pond (Jo Koy) podcast as well as the Adam Carolla podcast (both great podcasts), and we decided the next time we were in Las Vegas we would give it a try. The restaurant is not on the strip but it is close enough by car. We went around 1pm to make sure we would miss the lunch crowd but be aware they close at 230pm Monday thru Thursday and reopen for dinner at 5pm. We were seated right away and our server Mareianne took great care of since it was our first time. Each member in our party had their own \"cooking\" station. The variety of options was perfect. They have beef which includes the Yojie special, Kobe and even wagyu beef. They also have salmon and a veggie option. The salmon is so fresh it can be eaten sashimi style or lightly cooked. Everyone gets a choice of broth for cooking.  And the portion of veggies, noodles and protein is perfect.   I highly recommend Yojie. The beef was tender and the salmon was fresh. We were totally full but had to have the dark chocolate fondue for dessert. Which was a very good decision. It was the perfect ending to a perfect meal. Mr. Koy, you have a great restaurant in Las Vegas and whenever we are in Las Vegas you can bet we will go back to Yojie!!!",

    "text": "I've always enjoyed the concept of going out to eat just to cook my own food. I love hot pot restaurants. I usually go to another place and have been a regular there but I decided to give this place a try. \"Something new\"  My mom and I get to the restaurant for a late lunch/early dinner. We were the only ones in there. Our server was attentive, checked on us frequently.  Only thing that bothered us was that we could hear what the workers were talking about. I don't need to know nor do I care about your promiscuous sounding night at the club and how the guy you met there wants you to meet up with him later that night at another club. I thought that was kind of irritating. I was a server before too, and when me and my coworkers would talk, we would go to an area called \"the back\" or aka the \"kitchen\" and talk, not in front of customers. Very unprofessional.  The food was good. The sauces were good. They have a good iced green tea. They arrange the vegetables in a bowl and make it look pretty. I don't think there's enough vegetables in there. Even when my mom and I got an additional bowl of vegetables for $4.99, I know they put a little more, but I don't think that bowl of vegetables is worth $5 Only thing is I wish they had shrimp. This is the first hot pot place I've been to that hadn't offered shrimp.   This was a \"nice try\" restaurant. But I think I'll stick with my usual spot. Service and food were great though :)",

You're able to get a long tray of good quality beef (Yojie Cut) that melts in your mouth. The salmon and pork belly were also very tasty. You also get a large bowl of veggies that are very fresh. My favorite broths are the tonkotsu and the sukiyaki (especially because of the egg).   I was hesitant to dip it in the raw egg after cooking it in the sukiyaki, but I was so wrong. Go try it. It'll be the best thing that ever happens to you tbh. So don't be scared of it, it's perfectly safe and delicious!  The interior is very nice and clean; everyone is seated bar style. Service is also very nice and helpful!   Overall, probably the best shabu shabu in town!!",

The servers here are very well informed and love telling new customers everything there is to know about this amazingly delicious fondue experience. Our server's name was Carl, and he was awesome at showing us the ropes.  The atmosphere is grand for a small space. There is a lovely modern look inside an intimate bar-style area, and you even get the choice of picking a high or low top chair!!! As a shortie, I chose the latter.  I have yet to try their meat options, but will be doing so very soon. this trip, I ordered the veggie medley with the spicy miso broth. I loved the variety of hearty vegetables I got, and it made a wonderful To-go soup after my fondue experience!! If you like things added with an extra kick, they have an awesome punch to add to your fondues and sauces. ;)  All in all, this place is great. The servers are friendly and excited to work here, and the atmosphere is comfortable. I love that I found a late night spot to eat something healthy. Next on my check list when I come back, green tea white chocolate fondue, salmon fondue, and hopefully some yummy cocktails (when they get their liquor license).",

ALWAYS get dessert. I love their fondue. For dessert, I either get their assorted dessert or strawberries with milk chocolate fondue.

One thing I loved about the restaurant is that each seat area had a usb adapter where you can charge your phone while you eat. I am glad they though of that. I think every restaurant should have that.   The food was good and the portions was just right. It was enough to fill us up. Prices are similar to other shabu-shabu places.   The service was great.

Food: 5/5 I really like the Kobe' Beef and dipping it with either the spicy miso or tonkotsu option. But the recommended plate which is the Yojie's Cut is also really good as well! All of the plates come with vegetables, rice, and noodles. The dip here is so satisfying, I always want to come back for more.  The dessert is just as delicious as the entrees! I usually get the fruits and pastries ($7.99) with milk chocolate. The plate it comes out on is decorated so beautifully you almost don't want to eat it.   Staff: 5/5 A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Their staff is beyond friendly and helpful! They literally explain everything to you down to the T. They let you know how long to cook the items for, what items are highly recommended, etc. Also, they're quick to tend to your needs. I have never had my water glass empty here.   Environment: 5/5 The restaurant has a very modern take on it. From the decorations to the set up of the tables. The set up is two rows, one on the left and one of the right and a small section connected to it  all with individual chairs and a stove in front of the chair. There is a middle section for the staff to walk in. I also really enjoy the music they play here, it is very appealing!",

You have 3 options of broth and about 5 meat options. Every order comes with a bowl of vegetables and noodles. Every time I go, I get the combination for $20 and order pork belly and steak as my meat.  The restaurant is a small area with one u-shaped table to seat probably 30 people. I'm not sure if this is possible, but it would be fun to reserve the place and have a Japanese fondue party. The interior is super cute and clean.

    "text": "First off this place is incredible! When you first walk in is a very unique looking experience. You either sit at a one-sided hightop bar with your own personal heating service or a low top bar with the same set up. It is a very communal atmosphere. This is a wonderful place to take a date or to grab something for yourself. This year Joy is in making your own food. Be sure to take your time. All the food comes out at one time raw and if you Mary Lee dump it all in at once it kind of ruins the fondue experience. I had seen set ups like this before on Anthony board Danes show and Andrew Zimmerman's bizarre foods and always wanted to find a place like this. I happened to stumble upon it while grabbing coffee at a shop close to next door. The staff is incredibly polite and very professional. One would be hard-pressed to try all the amalgamations of the food options including the broths, protein, types of rice and noodles, and vegetables etc. an absolutely stellar experience. I wish I lived there so I could eat there all the time :-)",

Our server Mary was this cute, petite, and friendly girl with a big smile. She explained the concept  very well and recommended me to get a XL portion (the Sumo) which filled me for sure. Trying pasteurized egg as a dipping sauce was something new. Since it was our first time we had also beer, sake, and even the fondue dessert. We love green tea! Would highly recommend it to our friends and family if they want something new. We can't wait to come back and get the same server Mary. We loved her and loved Yojie :)",

Variety is fairly typical of this type of establishment. No big surprises. However, they are excellent with what they offer!  Seating is limited, though.  On the other hand, we also see it as a strong point. We preferred to enjoy our food rather than feeling like rushing and dodging in a busy supermarket or being herded like cattle!",

    "text": "The perfect meal on a cold winter night is Yojie Japanese Fondue!  Nestled in the Village Square shopping center, I was excited to try their shabu shabu and it did not disappoint.  The interior is nicely decorated and the tabletop electric stoves complement the decor rather than other similar restaurants that have gas stoves.  I decided to try the shabu shabu with Yojie select beef slices in a large portion.  The meat quality was very good and cooked quickly in the seaweed broth.  I requested the ponzu and sesame sauces for dipping and these were both delicious.  Presentation of the side veggies was excellent and they looked very fresh.  I was also surprised with the choice of white or brown rice which other places don't give.  Overall, Yojie is an excellent restaurant for shabu shabu and I'm excited to try the sukiyaki next time!",

The place is pretty small so if you have a large group, you may have to wait. With any hotpot place, you choose the meat and sides that you want. The meat was fresh and the portion was decent. They have 4 broths to pick from. I got the spicy miso which was bomb! It wasn't too spicy. Each plate ordered comes with veggies, noodles, and a choice of white or brown rice. You also get 2 choices of dipping sauce. Three people in our group were 1st timers and the staff was super friendly, helpful, and quick. We all had a great experience, and will be back in the future soon. They have nice art work hanging on the walls. Too bad we didn't get to see JoKoy haha. They serve liquor which is a plus and they also have dessert!",

The service was top notch and the food was amazing. Especially the yojie cut. It literally melted in your mouth (not in a naughty way, people). The waitress was very knowledgeable and very courteous and polite. Whenever we had questions, she was there and spot on. And got to admit, meeting one of the owners himself, Mr. Jo Koy was just made our day. Just because he is one of the best filipino comedians lol jk. But besides that, just the fact he came out and seeing him interact with the customers made our stay more enjoyable. Thumbs up.",

I order the Kodomo (small) yojie's cut (angus) with spicy miso broth and it was delicious and a lot healthier than what I've been eating lately.   Lots of vegetables to cook in my broth: cabbage, mushrooms, carrots, onions , seaweed, and spinach.   Noodles to cook in my broth: udon and this thin translucent type.   The meat and sauces were delicious. The staff were very helpful in getting us set up, each with our own grills.   Very clean, modern, AIR CONDITIONED, well-ventilated restaurant.

    "text": "I went here last week on a Sunday afternoon. The place was easy to find and there's plenty of parking in the area.   When I first walked in, I really liked their modern decor. The place was very clean. White countertops offering hightop and lower bar seating. It's not super huge so it's not a place for large group settings. They were playing sort of edm/trap/house music. Not obnoxiously loud or anything, I mean it was still day light when I went. It was pretty quiet, only a party of four dining when we walked in. So I'm glad there wasn't a wait.  So to start I am not a shabu shabu expert so the server gave us the run down. There were only two servers working when we were eating there and both were really nice and friendly.   They have a selection of meats to choose from angus beef, pork, and even vegetarian options. After choosing the meat you chose your soup base or sauce. The server said the most popular was the sukiyaki which is a sweeter flavor and it comes with pasteurized egg for dipping (I was weirded out at first). I got the pork kurobuta lunch portion with the spicy miso. Mine came in a choice of sauces, I got the goma and the swisher. My boyfriend got the sukiyaki (he's such a follower lol) with the combo which includes the yojie cut of angus beef and your choice of another meat, he got pork belly. All the entrees come with a bowl of mixed veggies and udon. You also get a bowl of rice, which I think was free refills.   The spicy miso is where it's at! It went so well with pork and then I dipped in the swisher sauce. I tried the sukiyaki as well which was pretty tasty with the beef and the egg was ok it's just still weird to me. For me in a soup lover and sukiyaki is just so sweet I can't slurp that for too long. Even my boyfriend was so jealous because the spicy miso was better than his sukiyaki. I made a soup with my veggies and udon. It was perfect for this cold weather. Between the pork belly and kurobuta, I prefer the kurobuta.  The angus beef was ok to me it wasn't anything to wow about.   It can be a little pricey for the amount of meat you get especially if you don't do a combo option but for me I ate all my veggies and udon so I felt full. A good thing to do is if you're dining with another person is to get one combo and then one regular portion, then split it.",

    "text": "Great place, especially if you are a shabu-shabu virgin!  When looking for a meal and you want a \"quickie\", this is not the place.  Here, you should take your time, really savor and enjoy what you're eating.  The space is very modern.  The seating is at two counters, one high and one low.  Each seat gets their own fondue bowl, which is different from most other places that have one bowl for the table.  The art work on the wall is modern with a Japanese theme and I had fun watching Anime and the original American version of Godzilla on the overhead monitors.  The nice thing is you have never had Japanese fondue \"shabu-shabu\", the staff explains everything to you.    When you enter the place, the staff yells at you \"irasshaimase!\", which is the same \"welcome\" you usually hear when you enter a sushi restaurant.  The first thing after the staff greats you and seats you is explain the menu pointing out the different meat selections, the different cooking dips, and the different finishing dips.  I was a purist the two times I've been and chose the traditional \"shabu-shabu\", but they have other dips like sukiyaki and spicy miso.  No need to explain the process here because enough reviewers have explained the process of dipping your meat at this place.  I was surprised at how much I liked the green tea and white chocolate fondue dessert.    I've had chocolate fondue before but I've never had white chocolate/green tea fondue before and it was great!  It is rich and pairs very well with the fruits and crispy rice squares.    So, if you are a Japanese fondue virgin, come in and let the staff gently lead you to your happy place!",

He was eloquent and very helpful in presenting the Shabu Shabu experience; you should always want a server who who enjoys the cuisine as much as you do. The food was just as tasty as they were described in the menu. After everything was cooked to perfection, a symphony of flavors was occurring in our taste buds. One thing I really appreciate is that the restaurant does not waste food whatsoever. If you happen to have some leftovers, the servers will offer to turn your left over meats and vegetables into a savory soup dish. That is a respectable and genius idea.  As far as location goes, my significant other and I are very appreciative that Yojie is not located in the Strip. The last thing we need is an over intoxicated tourist slovenly dunking his or her meat in a boiling broth while laughing like a hyena from the Lion King. Can't wait to enjoy another dinner at Yojie!",

Had to flag them down several times for a refill and additional napkins.  Ambiance 4/5 loved the artwork. Music was a bit excessively loud on some songs. Not sure what happen there.  Restroom cleanliness 4/5. Nice modern sink.  Experience 5/5 fun and entertaining. Good place to dine with friends or date night out.  Would return again =]",

    "text": "ATMOSPHERE:  This place has everything that I enjoy about a restaurant.  Clean eating area, great music, not too loud, cool decor and sleek impressions.  It's a relaxed atmosphere without being too dull.  The only real thing that threw me off was that anime was playing on the tv screens (I came in on a Sunday, at least have some football on!)  But this is a really minor point because everything else was exceptional.  FOOD:  I've never tried shabu shabu before this visit.  Yojie was on my radar for a while but I finally was able to try it out.  I was with my girlfriend and we got the combo with Pork Belly and sukiyaki sauce.  The normal accompaniments (white rice, vegetables, noodles) were nice and fresh.  The meats themselves were cut really well and cooked super fast and tasted great with the sauce.  Trust me when I tell you the sauce was BOMB!  SO GOOD in fact that I'm still thinking about it now.  If you go, make sure to try the sukiyaki with the egg.  The egg is a must have with the meal.  We also got some mochi, which was a nice way to end the meal.  SERVICE:  Top notch service all-around.  I wish I would have gotten their names but our server was great.  She gave us a demo before we started, made sure everything was up to our standards and joked around with us a little bit.  Our other server gave us a rundown of the menu and what it all means (we were noobies).  I'd like to see how this restaurant does during a really busy time but I'll gladly take the service we got during the lunch hours.",

Service: Was great, I enjoyed speaking to the servers and I think the owner. They explained the process and options very well. They kept our drinks filled and were friendly.  Food: The food is good to a point. About 1/2 way through the meal everything just starts to taste bland and one note. The food doesn't sit in the broth's enough to add too much flavor and what little flavors is added all taste the same.   Decor: It's fine, they tried hard to make this a fresh experience but I feel like I've been in similar places many times. It reminds me of the Goth kids when I was in High School, they all hated to conform and wanted to be different but in the end they all looked the same as each other. Every \"hip\" restaurant these days are the same to me: Pop art, stone and concrete, and blasting some form of electronic music.   Experience: We planned on going with another couple but the cancelled at the last minute. This was a blessing because the bar seating and extremely loud music would have made it difficult to have a conversation with all four at the same time.  Go if: You've never had hot pot You really enjoy hot pot and live near Summerlin If you want to try something new and the experience is more important than flavor   Avoid if: You have a large group You're not a Hipster Foodie and care more about quality of food  than what's supposed to be cool or unique.",

The restaurant was brand spankin' new and had very modern/contemporary decor.   Customer service was excellent! The staff was attentive and very helpful with the ordering process. Food was great, and fairly priced. I ordered the Geisha prime rib entree with the spicymiso broth. I also had the Japanese iced coffee, which was a bit small but 'twas delicious nonetheless. Funnyman and partner of the restaurant, Jo Koy, was there that day to support the staff. He interacted with customers and made sure that everyone had an enjoyable experience.

    "text": "After seeing Jo Koy on the news promoting his new restaurant, I had to check it out.  And as Jo Koy stated in his interview, Yojie Japanese Fondue isn't where you dip sushi into cheese. That's what I first though when I heard the restaurant name, but behold  Japanese Fondue is another name for shabu shabu.   When I walked into the restaurant, I was surprised that there is only bar seating. That's fine if you're with one or two people, but it's harder to socialize and be seated   with larger groups.  Ordering is simple, pick your meat & size, then the dip you'd like to cook with, and depending on the dip you can also choose other sauces to dip with afterward. Each meat comes with a bowl of veggies and noodles to accompany the meats. The server mentioned their two most popular meat choices were the prime rib & Yojie's cut and the most popular dips are shabu shabu and sukiyaki. I opted for the geisha (medium sized) prime rib, shabu shabu dip with goma and ponzu sauce.   The food came out quicker than I expected. I took a lot longer figuring out the menu! The geisha size was a little smaller than I imagined. For a medium, I think I got 6 or 7 pieces of prime rib. I think with different cuts of meat you may get more slices. So next time, I'll definitely go a size up. Thankfully I had a bowl of rice and another bowl full of vegetables (cabbage, carrots, mushroom, onions), tofu, seaweed, and 2 different kinds of noodles to fill me up. Despite my poor choice in size, the meat and vegetables were all fresh and tasty even when it was dipped in the shabu shabu (which is just water). The goma and ponzu sauce were a great companion to the meat. I'll be back to try the swisher sauce!    Our server told me that they were still in their  soft opening, but have had a great turn out so far and that there will be more restaurants opening up soon! I enjoyed the ambiance and the attentive staff. Can't wait to come back and try their dessert!   Their bathroom is pretty cool too with an interesting waterfall sink!",

I just wish they had alcohol. A cold asahi would have been perfect. We saw others with alcohol. So I'm assuming you can bring your own with a fee.  Overall, it was awesome.

Ever run into a barber or hairdresser who LOVES what they do? Well, it's the same vibe at Yojie's...  We split the Samuri sized (7 ops) Kobe Beef w/ a pot of their Spicy Miso & Tonkotsu broths, 2 sides of sauces (Goma & Ponzu), w/ brown rice. They didn't have their beer/wine license yet so we ordered their delicious Signature Green Tea... Everything was absolutely amazing!!!  We'll definitely go for it all next time and try their Japanese Wagyu Beef and get the staff to ring the gong! We ended our dinner w/ a scoop of thier Ube ice cream since we were kind of full. They offer a pretty tasty fruit & pastry chocolate fondue which we'll try and leave more space for the next time we visit!  We were fortunate to try Yojie's while JoKoy happened to be in town so that was extra special that he was there to hangout w/ his dining patrons. Both Anton & JoKoy were really hospitable and genuine guys! I guarantee if you check this place out, you will instantly be a fan of this spot! We can't wait to come back the next time!",

    "text": "I like shabu shabu and its concept. You get a plate of thinly sliced beef and \"shabu shabu\" the meat in hot pot (FYI Shabu shabu is onomatopoeia term, a sound that comes from stirring the meat in water or sauce). Growing up eating shabu shabu at home, I wasn't too fond of the vibe or the price here. In Japan, you can get a pack of thinly sliced beef at less than 1,000 yen ($10) so I was surprised to see them charging $15-20 a pot. Traditionally it's an affordable dish that is to be shared with a group.   I walked-in and was not greeted or seated for 15 minutes. A worker was busy on the phone which bothered me. She was friendly but not attentive. I would dock a star just for the service here.   I decided to get Yojie's cut which is angus cut and their recommended plate. They have different sizes (3oz, 5oz, 7oz, 10oz) and all plates comes with a bowl of vegetables, noodles and a choice of white or brown rice. I went with 5oz or Geisha which was $14.99 (lunch). You can also choose your dipping soup/sauce option. I went ahead with shabu shabu style and got goma and ponzu sauce.  5oz Yojie's cut came with about 10 shabu shabu meat. Shabu shabu is cooked fast, you just need to dip in water about 10 seconds and is ready to eat. Goma sauce is a sesame sauce and had rich taste to it. Ponzu was citrusy and refreshing with meat. I also got to try their swisher sauce which is my personal favorite.   5oz was not filing even after finishing their bowl of vegetables/noodle and rice. I understand they use quality meat but you are looking at about $20 with tip and tax or even more for a fairly small portion. In addition, you don't share the pot in a group. I guess Yojie has Americanized take on shabu shabu and I am not sure if I am a fan.",

    "text": "\"WTF is Japanese Fondue?\" asks my Asian poker bud.  \"No clue.  How do you know about this place?\" my dumbfounded reply.  \"The hot Asian dealer.  Besides fish, beef, pork, chicken; it all taste better dipped in melted cheese!\" proclaims my Midwest poker bud.    Upon arriving...  \"Japanese Fondue\" = Shabu shabu.  No sashimi dipped in cheese for this carnivore!  This is shabu shabu for beginners.   All meals come complete with veg, rice, and noodles to finish the broth.  Ordering is simple:  1.  Choose the protein, cut, and quantity ranging from 3oz to 10oz.  Beef grades include USDA Choice, USDA Prime, Snake River Farms American Wagyu, A5 Japanese Wagyu.    2.  Choose broth.  Classic shabu shabu is a simple piece of konbu in water, spicy miso, or tonkotsu broth.  All come with appropriate dipping sauces.  A sukiyaki preparation is also offered.  Note:  every diner must order at least one set or split charges apply.  Cooking simple.  Proteins one slice at a time. Beef follows the two second rule, pork and chicken as daring as you want to be.  Dip and eat ripping hot.  Veg whenever you want.  Noodles to finish.  In the end, the A5 is outstanding.  Flash cooked.  Extremely sweet with a clean finish.  The American wagyu has good marbling and a more pronounced beef flavor.  Both showcase the best in basic shabu shabu konbu broth.  The USDA Prime rib eye is hands down the most flavorful by American standards and works in any broth.  Service is good but then again, there's nothing much required after the raw food has been delivered.    IMPORTANT:  BYOB!  Straightforward and no complaints of this small Cali chain.",

If you are firmiliar with Shabu Shabu or Hot Pot type establishments you owe it to yourself to try Yojie out it is everything you love about Shabu Shabu but with its own signature flavor. They have an assortment of meats as broths you can choose from depending on your preference. The broths are made in house , the meats are high quality and the veggies are as fresh as they come this is definitely the top of my Off the Strip Vegas food spots !",

It's a nice place inside but the only grumble I had was how small it was. I guess the set up is for one person per one hot plate but what if you had a big group?   On to the food..  I ordered the ribeye meat size samurai (large) with spicy miso base. I asked if they had a paste or sauce that was spicer. OMG! They warned me about it but did I listen? NOPE! The base of my hot pot was soooooo spicy. Lol! The prime rib comes out raw of course and you take a piece and dip it into the boiling broth. Give it less then 10 seconds and it's finished. Choose your sauce.. I got ponzu (soy sauce with lemon) and dipped my meat and ate my rice. I like my meat Rare so that's how I did all my meat. You're in charge of your food and you cook everything yourself. So you're the caption of your ship :-)  Will I be back again?? Probably not, unless they fix the sitting situation to handle parties of 4 or more. Also if you're short like my friend the hot pot itself it's kinda far. I don't have a problem but she did.",

However, I was a little sad that they didn't offer lamb. Out of all the shabu places I been to, this is the only one where they offer the (raw) pasteurized egg as a dipping sauce. I personally didn't order the sauce but I was able to try it from my friend and it was pretty delicious. I constantly saw the waitresses checking up on customers and even helping them out in terms of cooking their food. I personally didn't get that much attention, but I'm indifferent about that because I shabu a lot and I just do my own thing. Just a minor complaint (and I'm sure it was pure accident) was that they turned off my stove before I was even done cooking/eating. Overall I really enjoyed this place and would definitely come back!",

    "text": "Coming from Los Angeles, with places like little Tokyo, Koreatown and Chinatown, shabu shabu is nothing new to me.  I've tried a few of the shabu shabu places here in Las Vegas over the last few months and by far this is one of my favorites.  First off, there's plenty of parking due to the large shopping area. The Kojies lies right in the southwest corner of the lot next to a comic book store.  The decor is very plain and simple with a clean and artistic feel to the restaurant. With about 20 seats in the whole restaurant, you definitely have to make sure you come at the right time.  Your shabu shabu pot comes in 2 steps. First up being your choice of protein. They also have a salmon choice and an all vegetable choice as well. Once you pick your protein from ribeye, to pork to the Koji house special, you then move on to your choice of broth.  You have a choice of a spicy broth, a clear broth, and the tonkatsu broth.  You also get your choice of two dipping sauces. One of them being the ponzu which is my favorite.  Along with the pot and comes a vegetable medley with carrots noodles broccoli and lettuce for dipping. You also get your choice of white or brown rice and chopped green onions and garlic. If you want to kick it up a notch go ahead and ask for the house chili sauce which is made from ghost peppers.  The pot is placed on electric burner right in front of you and the fun then begins. The staff was amazingly attentive. From everything from checking to make sure our dips and broth were always full to make me sure our drinks for always refilled.    Prices were pretty decent. Around $36 for the two of us, one with the meat protein and the other one with an all vegetable and one drink.  I definitely recommend this as one of the better shabu shabu places here in Vegas.",

    "text": "Yesterday, we tried this restaurant since it has good reviews on yelp.... for me, first impression is really important. Like, is the restaurant clean and are the people accommodating, etc.... when we first came into the door, the tables were dirty... and i would understand that they haven't cleaned it due to high volume of customers. But there were like 4 customers eating at that time. We stood there without anyone asking us to be seated (and theres a sign that says wait to be seated). So we let that go and finally,  the girl who guided us to our table. She asked us if it was our first time there and we said yes... we were assuming that she would tell us about their menu but she didnt.... it took forever for our orders and the people who were working there were very loud that made us uncomfortable. The food was not bad but was not that great either. We said we will not come back to that restaurant again...",

    "text": "I was reading through the reviews and people were complaining about the price. It really isn't expensive compared to other Shabu places I've been to. There are plenty that will cost you $50+ to get the same amount of food as their geisha size. Just saying. I've been a fan of Yojie since I lived in CA - it was also the less expensive of the choices for shabu. I must say this location out does itself. From decorations to menu to even the restrooms. Yes I am loving the restroom. Concrete walls! So modern. Waterfall sink. ooo fancy Menu definitely is bigger here than the CA locations. The Salmon tho!!! You have to try it. I MEAN IT. TRY THE SALMON!!! It is sashimi grade so you can eat it raw and I sure did eat that thing raw. With or without the sauce. I drool just thinking about it. For all you cheapskates out there, get the combo plates, you get more meat that way. And if you didn't know rice and sauce come with refills. That's right FREE REFILLS ON RICE AND SAUCES. Or you can take your cheap butt to melting pot and let see you say yojie is expensive after.",

I got mine with chicken and beef with the sukiyaki sauce and boy oh boy was I blown away!!! The sauce was sweet but savory and paired well with both meats. They give you an array of vegetables, noodles and choice of rice with every pot! I surprisingly saved room for desert and got the dark chocolate fondue with strawberries and bananas! You won't go wrong with choosing Yojie!",

We had the prime rib in both sukiyaki and shabu shabu the meat and vegetables were fresh. All the sauces were standard nothing extraordinary. The rice was hard so it was probably left out before being served but it wasn't cheap rice. I was happy that they didn't try to put their own spin on the dish and try to make it some type of\" fusion\" restaurant. Service was good. We order Extra udon noodles and edamame which never came but it worked out since I ordered too much food anyway. I recommend it anytime you are looking for a healthy meal.",

They put out the \"first timers\" block so that the staff could explain everything.  The service was OUTSTANDING!  While we were waiting for some spots to clear up, Anton greeted us personally and asked if he could get us anything to drink while we waited.  He came out with some really nice sparkling sake.  The food was amazing as well!  Once explained, then menu really easy to understand.  We also indulged in the dark chocolate and green tea chocolate fondue for dessert.  Save room for that!  Did I mention they also had a crazy good Pandora playlist going on?!  My group and I were eating it up.  Thanks to Azi (spelling?) and Vhalery, our servers who were so patient and laughed at all our jokes.  You guys are the bomb!  Please visit this place the next chance you get.  You won't regret it!",

Each person gets their own hot pot cooker with a plate of shaved meat and a bowl of vegetables and noodles.

Having an activity go with your meal is great when you may not have much to chat about with your dinner mates. I had the yojie's cut steak in the geisha size. Its just right for one person.

I always come back to the prime rib with the Sukiyaki dip and it always hits the craving. The beef is tender and the Sukiyaki is the perfect combination of sweetness and saltiness that accentuates the natural flavors of the beef. Boiling the udon noodles in the Sukiyaki is wonderful as well, as the noodles soaks up the flavors of the broth.   This time around, I tried the Green Tea White Chocolate fondue with fruits and pastries. The white chocolate is a bit sweet, but the tartness of the strawberries and the subtle sweetness of the bananas are a good contrast to the chocolate. It is also accompanied by homemade marshmallows that are perfectly fluffy and surprisingly not too sweet. Everyone should try their fondue at least once!",

Literally the best shabu shabu that I've had in the Las Vegas area.  I got the sukiyaki with the size large (samurai) yojie cut. The meat quality is good; they kind of cut it so thin that when i was picking up the uncooked meat with my chopsticks to place it into my pot, sometimes they would rip, which was a little annoying. The flavor of the broth made up for it though!  I asked our incredible server Tai (Thai? I'm sorry I'm not sure how to spell his name!) for some hot drops, which are basically a staple at shabu shabu joints, and he brought me out a bottle that literally was labeled \"hot drops.\" It's actually like a hot sauce paste (and wasn't really that spicy). If you like spicy, I recommend adding more than normal.",

    "text": "Yojie is simply amazing every time I come here. It's a Japanese hot pot that you cook your meat and veggies in the broth of your choice. You pick the meat you want and the broth. I always get the yojie's cut of meat with sukiyaki. I've tried the miso, which is good as well but I prefer the sukiyaki broth. The meat is  thinly sliced for quick cooking in the broth.   The sukiyaki comes with a raw egg that you dip your meat into. Sounds kind of weird and maybe gross.. But it's absolutely delicious and a must try.   The veggies they give you are cabbage slices (which are huge and kinda wish they had it chopped), carrots, tofu, seaweed, udon noodles, mushroom, and clear noodles. You can toss the veggies in little by little as you eat or toss it all in.   If you're a spicy food fanatic, ask for their hot chili paste. Beware it's super super spicy. Just add little by little to your broth or put some on your plate to dip a little with your meat and veggies. But the chili paste puts that icing on the cake to the meal.   If you're a first timer also, they give you a little wood block that says first time. So if you don't know what you're doing, they will help you and explain to you the process.   For dessert, I had the berries and bananas fondue with dark chocolate. It's probably good for 2 people after the meal. But that was delicious as well. It came with strawberries and bananas!   You can never go wrong with this place!",

Woohoo...now you can enjoy a frosty beer or a nice sake with your meal. I guess they got it about 8 months ago.  I went with my friend on a Tuesday night around 7:30 pm. We were promptly greeted and told it would be a minute or two until seated, which was accurate. We were seated next to a group of newbies. My friend had never been to shabu shabu, so I placed our orders. The waiter took his time to describe the meal and help the group next to us cook, which helped my friend. Excellent service!  Unfortunately they had just run out of Kurobota pork which I was planning on getting, so I just went with the Yojie cut. I did not notice any reduction in the quality of the meat. Normally I always get the combo, but I wasn't super hungry and just went with the smaller portion which was just the right amount. My friend loved her food, and finished it all and proclaimed she was stuffed!! So no dessert, which the group next to us did order and the fruit with chocolate fondue looked so gooooooooood I wanted some.  I've eaten here at least 8 times since they've opened, and it is one of my favorite places in Las Vegas to eat, and easily the best Shabu-Shabu place.

I was impressed with the 3 servers working during my last visit, I think our primary server was Shannon. Each were complimentary and collaborating to make the dining experience for all of the customers fantastic. The overall experience was greater than 5 stars.  The food has always been fresh and the dessert platter - although needing more chocolate sauce - was fantastic.   I hope that they continue on this path of collaborative service!",

All the broths they had are AMAZING and definitely added flavor to their high quality meats! They give you a bunch of vegetable as well. Rice and veggies are unlimited and comes with the whole thing! The vibe here is great and they played some good music that my friends and I jammed out to while eating! It's such a chill spot and the staff were so friendly and attentive! Definitely coming back to this place soon! Definitely a favorite",

If you're looking for the same style of shabu shabu that you would find in California (e.g. Shabuway, California Shabu Shabu, among others), you will find it at Yojie. According to their website they have 4 California locations and this one location in LV.   The ordering process is simple, and similar to other shabu shabu places. First, choose your size and type of protein. I recommend going with the samurai (7 oz) portion if you are hungry. We've normally gone with the Yojie's cut beef, which has been well marbled and a great cut. Then, choose your broth. I recommend the spicy miso! Really flavorful and delicious.  One thing that sets Yojie apart is that they offer chocolate fondue for dessert. The green tea white chocolate fondue is absolutely to die for, and will keep me coming back!",

We went on a Monday night and were sat immediately. 3 in our party and my daughter and I chose to share the XL portion. The wait time for the food was average. The issue was the waitress kept forgetting things and getting her attention took forever. I asked 3 times for a fork for my daughter because they never brought out ladles or tongs. Getting refills on tea and rice were also difficult and the temperature on the burner needed to be adjusted but again, no waitress to ask to help.  I will say the clean up between dinner and dessert was prompt and so was paying the check when we left.  I give 3 stars for the food and 1 for the super cool teapot and the atmosphere.  The food and ambiance was worth the slow/poor service and I will give them another chance. I hope they step it up in the service area though...",

Only thing I do not like is that they close in between lunch and dinner. I've came before and we had to wait a whole hour until dinner started in order to dine in (super annoying!).   Place is pretty cool, lots of local art on the walls (love seeing my friends art up there). Very clean and bright with a choice of sitting on high or low bar. We always choose low bar, for some reason we do not like the high bar.  My go to is always the \"Chicken Breast, in Sukiyaki, no egg instead I ask for swisher and ponzu sauce, and an extra veggie bowl no udon noodles extra thin ones instead\". Ask for their hot sauce it is so good in your broth but be careful, it is really really spicy!!!!!! (use 3-4 drops).   Staff is always super friendly and on their A game. They also have a rewards system that accumulates points but not sure exactly how it works, I just know we have one.",

I chose the Geisha portion of Yojie and it was just perfect! ~$30 (tax+tip included)  I like hot pot/soups in general so this was right up my alley!   Meat was really good quality and the accoutrements were just right! The broth had a nice flavor as well. My friend chose the salmon and it ended over cooking a bit so I recommend if you go with seafood, cooking your fish last or just pouring the cooked accoutrements and broth over it.   Would definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas!",

The waitress sat me down at a counter and explained the menu, the sauces, and the cooking process.  After she teaches you it is pretty self explanatory - you simply dip the meat and vegetables into the cooking broth and cook it as long as you want.  You can then even make a soup out of the used broth if you desire.  You also get a few sauces for dipping.  With each shabu shabu meal you are given noodles and vegetables, as well as the chosen meat.  I only had the geisha and was full after eating the entire ensemble.    The meal was delicious, unique, and a must visit if looking for something unique in Las Vegas.  It costs around $15-$20 depending on the meal chosen, so not too expensive.  The seating is at the counter though so it could be a problem if you have a large group, but other than that I recommend this place.  Shabu shabu is one of my new favorite meals.",

To our surprise the amazing Jo Koy was at the restaraunt to help greet us. Along with being an amazingly funny comedian, he was also a gracious and entertaining host. The rest of the staff was extraordinarily nice, and any questions or requests we had were answered with a smile  The food was outstanding. My friends and I had the sukiyaki and the spicy miso. The sukiyaki was a lightly sweated, robust teriyaki flavor which fit perfectly with the raw pasturized egg served on the side. The spicy miso was very robust miso soup style taste, however, the sauce was the star of the show. The sauces were a sesame sauce, and the goma sauce. Along with the miso broth, to even out the flavor, it was amazing. The vegetables were fresh and varied,  and tied the meal together.  We finished off the meal with the white chocolate green tea fondue. This was a standard fondue desert, it was absolutely delicious.  The price per plate is about 15 to 25 dollars, this is without alcohol, and for the price, it was amazing.  Thank you Yojie for a wonderful time.",

We were greeted and seated right away by a friendly face. I liked how it was clean, modernly designed and not crowded. The waitress gave us a few minutes to look over the menu. She could tell we were new, so when taking our orders, she gave us a few recommendations that we might like. Quite knowledgeable about their menu.  The nice part is when she walked us through how to eat the dishes properly, instead of letting us act all crazy and just put everything in the hot pot. LOL. I bet that would've been hilarious, but man... I certainly would've felt dumb.  It was cool of her to check up on the brother, making sure he had enough broth in the pot for the entire meal. She'd also turn the little stove area down notches once in awhile to keep the stuff from boiling. At the end of the meal, she put our stuff together to bring home, which was pretty much the fixings of udon.  I had the Samurai portion of the Prime Rib with Spicy Miso, Brown Rice, Ponzu and the Swisher Sauces. The brother had Pork Combo Plate (also comes with Yojie Cut Angus Beef) with Sukiyaki, Pasteurized Egg and White Rice. I like me some Prime Rib, but I wish I had ordered what my brother got. The pork just went so well with the broth, then dipping it into the egg. For dessert, we both had the Ramune Float. Yummy citrus sweetness. Apparently the brother will be copying that dessert for home.  All in all, if the brother gave me a happy face and said he liked the place for food and customer service, we'll be going back whenever we're in the area.",

Friendly, attentive, staff fully understands the menu, and always presented neatly. The service is just a feature of its polished product. The neatly placed vegetables or equal positioned layers of meat on the plate will bring smiles to any OCD freaks.   From some perspectives the single digit quantity of meat may not seem like much, but Japanese hot pot (or any hot pot for that matter) is a long meal, providing satisfaction over a period of working time, allowing you to enjoy each bite you prepared for yourself. Your patience might be tested though as there is usually a line, and unconventional seating along an counter (sort of hinders group conversations, so avoid for double dates/meeting the folks)  Favorites include the Yojie's cut, prime rib, pork belly, Arnold Palmer-San (refills included), and the green tea fondue.",

It's cool looking, sleek decor... and my favorite comedian (Jo Koy) apparently owns it.  Last night was a cold night, so we decided to try it out.   A cold Friday night... I figured it would be packed.  Well it was about 1/2 full when we got there for dinner.  Always a suspicious sign.  We sat down on the lower counter.   Servers were super friendly.  I like that.  She walked us through the menu and knew what we wanted.    Wife order the prime rib.  My 8-yr old ordered he sashimi salmon.  I ordered the Angus.   The WORST part of this concept... they upcharge EVERYTHING!!  $2 extra for this, $1 for that, $3 of this.   Just charge $35-$39 per person and include it.  Do you really need to charge for 2-3 leaves of cabbage?  The only soup broth that is free is the original shabu shabu.  I guess water and a little piece of seaweed.  lol.  Wtf?!    Perhaps this is keeping to the traditions, but who really cares?!  Jo Koy isn't even Japanese!   lol.   They charge extra if you want a flavored broth.  And don't forget, you only get two dipping sauces.  If you want the third, yep... you guessed it, you'll have to pay.    A meal for two adults and an 8 yr old was $150 with tip.     I promise, if they charge $35 per entree, the place would have a line out the door and the bill would be the same.  I doubt we will be back.  There just wasn't anything that we loved.   We liked a lot of it, but nothing that we woke up craving.",

    "text": "My second time here and I'm still impressed. They are so friendly and the food is great. LOVE the spicy miso broth. Ponzu and Goma are the best sauces for this broth. As a female I find that the Geisha portions are perfect for dinner. You get the vegetables, noodles and rice so that fills you up as well (plus you can save room for dessert). Prices are reasonable if you stay away from the Kobe and Wagyu ($79 sometimes). Kurobuta Pork is excellent. For 4 of us the meal was $100 so I don't that that's too bad. I like the interactive cooking, I just wish the tables were designed to be a little more interactive with your party. (It's ok if there's 2-3 of you but any more and it's tough to include everyone in the conversation). Healthy eating!",

For me, it's a very clean shabu shabu and is the closet one that I've been able to find to my absolute favorite in So Cal, California Shabu Shabu.    My only critique is that they have not started their Swisher Society program and they always #-ing their Instagram posts with #SwisherSociety when they don't have it up and running yet.  Every time I inquire about it, I'm told they are aiming to get the system up by the end of the month.  I've been going about twice a month since their soft opening in late May.  Also, they do not have their liquor license yet.  I am not a huge drinker but I would think a business that has been open for that long would have been able to finalize their liquor license closer to it's opening date.  I gave them 4 of 5 starts for these two issue and would gladly give them 5 once those issues are resolved.  Update 10/28: Still waiting for Swisher Society to be accepted here and still waiting for the liquor license... not sure if they're even going to bother with either anymore....",

Don't get me wrong it was NOT dirty in anyway, and the food was beautiful, clean, and EXCELLENTLY, but I just felt like the air was a little off. There were no smells and I will go back every time I'm in town. In fact I was in Vegas for only one night, and took a Lyft from the strip just to eat here. It was absolutely worth it and I will be back. Thanks Joy",

I've always want to try Yojie out as it recently opened. Just our luck, we were greeted by the man himself Jokoy!!! It was a rare occasion for him to be in town mid week but he was waiting for his good friend to come in to dinner. 10 mins later a black Escalade rolls up and dude with a baseball cap walks in. He looks up and it none other than @adamcarolla! He came into town for an appearance at the @semashow. His BRE Datsun 510 was also on display at the Tokico booth inside Central Hall.  Back to the food...Yojie is easily one of the top shabu shabu spots i've ever been to. Not because it's owned by A celeb, it's really good. The ambiance, the quality of the food and the overall experience is fantastic. If you're ever in Vegas and have time to venture away from the strip, you must come here! Pictured: Yojie's Cut: Samurai Shabu Shabu with Goma & Ponzu sauces.Thank you @jokoy and staff for the exceptional hospitality. I was bummed no orange chicken on the menu...haha j/k!",

    "text": "I have always wanted to try Shabu, Shabu (Swish, Swish) from Japan. What is Shabu,Shabu you ask?? According to their website, it is \"The Art of Dipping\" We arrived around 7:00pm on a Saturday evening. The restaurant is in a \"U\" shape with a choice of sitting on a high top or a low counter level. We opted for the high top. Glad we arrived when we did because in fifteen minutes, every seat was taken in the restaurant. This was reassuring since we had never been here before. They have comfortable bar stools to sit on and the restaurant is very clean. In front of each seat, there is a burner along with plenty of counter space to hold all of your food. First you have to choose your plate, they offer three types of beef including Kobe, Angus and Japanese Wagyu. There is also prime rib, chicken, pork, pork belly, salmon and a veggie medley. Next you choose your dip or broth. Your choices are shabu shabu (water based and the healthiest), Sukiyaki with a pasteurized egg for additional dipping, spicy miso, and a pork tonkotsu. Each entree comes with a bowl of vegetables, noodles, and your choice of white or brown rice. I chose the chicken with the Sukiyaki and egg and my husband had the Japanese Wagyu beef with the tonkotsu sauce. Right after we placed the order, our server came out with a Japanese gong and asked me to \"Bang A Gong\" since we had ordered the Wagyu beef. When the check came, I knew why...This was pretty fun and when I did bang the gong, the whole kitchen cheered and again when the check came, I knew why. Wagyu beef is pricey! The servers are really friendly and they thoroughly explained the whole process from cooking the meat and vegetables to how to enjoy the meal. We were definitely in \"virgin territory\" but we both jumped into this new experience. The food comes out all at once with your big bowl of veggies and noodles, the broth and the meat. We were advised to shabu, shabu our meat anywhere from 15-20 seconds. I went about 25 seconds just to make sure that it was cooked. WOW! The flavors that came from the combo of the sauce and then dipping the meat in the egg was incredible. I could not believe all the flavor the little egg provided! Our server told me for a first time customer, I was brave in my choice of broth in terms of taste. I would choose that same sauce and egg again. I really enjoyed the rich taste of the combo. The vegetables included cabbage, mushrooms, carrots, watercress and then there were some noodles. You can make the decision whether or not you wish to enjoy your veggies crunchy or you can cook them too. My husband shared his Wagyu beef with me which had a sweet and delicate flavor well marbled and delicious rare.  My chicken was really tasty and fresh.  We had plans with some friends so we were unable to try out the dessert which is a great reason to return. When we left, we did not feel bloated or full like you do after a big meal. We both felt really energized and healthy. If you are in the neighborhood, be sure to shuffle, shuffle on over and enjoy some Shabu, Shabu!",

I love it, and reasonable priced, great and very attentive service! However, i didn't really appreciate they are telling us we have to sit at certain spot because they anticipate weekend to be busier (there are about 20% empty seat left at that time), after we sat down, all I see is people keeps leaving and had plenty of seat left, if it's a nearly full restaurant, I can understand, but it would be nice if they can think for customer first.  Another star off is the brown rice I have is spoiled, after couple of bite, I start to smell something not right, I smelled it closely and it's in very early stage of spoiling.  Trust me I cooked brown rice all the time and I had several experience of accidentally left it out in my rice cooker overnight during hot summer day and that's exactly the same smell that I'm smelling.  Luckily I didn't get sick, but I can tell because not many people order brown rice, so they just used the old left over rice and didn't realize it had gone bad.  In summary, I will still go back, I love the food and service, but just watch out if you get brown rice, ALWAYS smell it first, if it doesn't smell right, do not eat it and tell them they need to learn how to store the rice properly during summer time",

Thinly sliced meat to ensure it can be cooked easily, yet maintaining the tenderness. Broth is rich but not heavy. Unlimited refill of rice (brown or white). Great mix of sauce for the meat. A bowl of mixed veggies and udon was included. Bottom line is, both pork and beef are very tender, good portion, and great combination of food. To top it off, staff was very friendly, passionate and helpful. I would highly recommend this place even if u are just visiting vegas for fun!",

    "text": "I came here a few days ago and I wasn't impressed. There was nothing special about the atmosphere nor the food. I sat in the back of the restaurant and it was poorly lit since they depended on the natural sunlight to come in. I ordered the Yojie cut with sukiyaki broth. I was charged $2 extra for this soup which was misleading because I thought the egg was what tagged on the additional dollars and I didn't want the egg. Since I live on the opposite side of town, I would rather go to a shabu shabu restaurant in Chinatown, which is much closer to me, and I get the same food. The pots of broth are just sitting on the shelf, and to me that sounds like an opportunity for bacteria to grow throughout the day since it's not refrigerated. The service wasn't that great either. I think the waitress I had was new since she seemed inexperienced. I also saw her taking selfies behind the register which is very unprofessional.",

    "text": "I've never had shabu shabu before, but our meal at Yojie was such a memorable experience! My husband and I went out to eat with a friend who will be moving out of town soon, and I'm so glad that we went to this restaurant because it was such a fun meal that we will remember.  The decor is very nice, and it's obvious that everything about this restaurant was well thought out. The napkins and chopsticks were set out in such a cute way, the bar looked so nice, it was very appealing. I'm glad that we came with a small group because it is a very intimate restaurant with two counters. They were playing hilarious Japanese game shows on the television screens and we enjoyed them.  The food itself was great! Having never tried japanese fondue before I feel uncomfortable giving it a five star rating, but it was probably a 4.5! My husband and I split the largest portion of the house beef, and it was a filling meal. He has tried a lot of subiyaki during a time that he lived in Korea, and insisted that the meal was traditional and great. They do charge 5$ to split an order, but you also get an extra portion of rice, your own pot (so you can choose different broths if you would like) and your own sauces. My husband tried subiyaki and I tried the spicy miso. The miso tasted wonderful but was not as spicy as I would have liked (and I am not very tolerant of hot food)! I added chili sauce, though, and it was just fine. My husband loved the subiyaki, so if you would like a sweet broth, that's the one to pick!  We didn't order any dessert because the meal was so filling, but if we return I would try the white chocolate and green tea fondue.   Overall, I'm really happy that we ate here. This would be a wonderful date night restaurant, we will be back!",

    "text": "Call me slightly Shabu Shabu obsessed. Went three days in a row of their soft opening but who's keeping track. I could make up random reasons why you shouldn't go here and selfishly keep this spot my little secret but what kind of yelper would I be if I told the yelp community to stay away.  I've had my fair share of LA Shabu Shabu, so I was ecstatic when I found out an LA base franchise Shabu Shabu spot was coming to Vegas. FINALLY I don't have to starve in Vegas and travel great distances when I'm craving shabu shabu.  My go-to order: Kobe Beef or Japanese Wagyu   Sukiyaki dip (comes with pasteurized egg sauce) Add on goma sauce and ponzu sauce.   Meat quality: When in LA I always opt for the meat with the most marbling with high fat content due to the softness of the beef after being swished in boiling delicious sukiyaki. In LA its aka is \"Fatty belly\" which is Washimi Wagyu beef toro. I would say its closes to their Kobe beef American gold grade BMS 9-12. If you're feeling baller get the Japanese Wagyu BMS 5 it's like butter. If you're confused all Kobe beef is Wagyu, but not all Wagyu is kobe beef. Which I love how Yojie explains on their menu exactly what you're getting. If you like a little bit tender meat can't go wrong with their prime rib or yojie's cut which is a hand selected angus beef cut by chef Yojie.  Veggies:  Shabu Shabu comes with a variety of veggies: Bok choy, carrots, broccoli, onions, cabbage, mushroom and noodles. My only complaint about the vegetables but it's really no big deal. Some veggies come out frozen but it melts anyway. So I suggest don't eat them raw.   Soup base:  You have your choices of four soup dips. ShabuShabu which is your more traditional shabu shabu flavor, its clean and very light. Spicy miso, it's full of flavor and a crowd favorite. Tonkotsu which I haven't tried will update and my personal favorite sukiyaki, a more sweet soy sauce dip.   Sauce: It ain't easy being SAUCY. Actually in this case it is. Depending on your dipping soup. It comes with an assortment of Sauces that compliment your dipping soup. Don't have a panic attack if your favorite sauce isn't included you can always do an add on. I kind of went crazy here. My sukiyaki came with a pasteurized egg sauce that looks a lot like a raw egg. No worries the eggs been pasteurized to reduce food borne-illnesses so dip with no fear! It adds a silky buttery texture to your meat after sukiyaki dipping. My personal favorites are the goma sesame sauce with fine crushed sesame seeds on top and their tangy ponzu sauce. Add Shallots and garlic to taste with Yojie's in house \"drop drop drop it likes its hot drop\" Caution! Spicy.   Drinks:  First time I came here our server suggested to try their popular green tea with sweetener on the side. I didn't find much of a green tea flavor to this. So I'd personally pass on it next time.   Service:  Impeccable. I have no complaints. The servers are attentive, helpful, and very knowledgeable of the menu. So if you're a first timer don't panic. They got you covered on the how-to's.   Tips: - Ask for Yojie's in-house drop drop drop it like its hot drop to add a kick to your dipping sauces (beware its concentrated, adjust to your spicy tolerance). - Save your noodles and some veggies to the end. You can opt for your server to make udon noodle soup with your dip base that you can take to go.  - Ask for the manager Mika she's the best!  - Ask for Anna or Denise. Excellent service!",

I would say this place is hipster/ trendy, clean, pristine, and they have anime playing on TV (Samurai Shampoo to be exact).    Broths: I got the tonkatsu broth, which includes two sauces - Goma and Ponzu.  The server added a few extra seasonings to my sauces (I can't remember everything he put in there, but I do remember chilli oil and sesame seeds).  My brother got the spicy miso broth and that was full of flavor.  I've been to other shabu shabu places, and I've never had broth like this.  I ordered the Yojie's Cut dinner Sumo size (10oz of beef).  This comes with rice, veggies, and noodles.  The 10oz was super filling, but it was so good that I wanted more!  I like the presentation of the beef and veggies.    For dessert, we ordered the strawberry and bananas fondue with green tea white chocolate.  I'm not typically a fan of green tea chocolate, but I was mind blown with the flavor.  It was shared with 6 people, so it didn't go to waste.  Typically, this dessert can be shared with 2-3 people.    Also, I had the cherry blossom hot tea.  It was interesting to see it served in a tea infuser.  Overall I had a really good experience (and more so hooked) to this place.",

    "text": "I was ecstatic to hear that a new shabu shabu place opened up near my work. Fun fact- The co-owner is comedian Jo Koy. This sleek and modern restaurant seats around 30 people? The employees here are friendly and will explain everything if you have never been here or if you are a shabu shabu noob. Service was very attentive. You can tell they just opened and wanted to make sure they were explaining everything and being very helpful. There are cute Asian girls working here too. ;)  So this is how you order. First you pick one of four different serving sizes - 3 oz (kodomo), 5 oz (geisha), 8 oz (samurai), or 12 oz (sumo). I thought the descriptions for the servings sizes were cute. Next, you pick your choice of meat (Angus cut, prime ribeye, Kobe beef), chicken, pork, salmon, combo, or vegetarian. Then you pick your broth- shabu shabu, sukiyaki, or spicy miso. It comes with white or brown rice, veggies (cabbage, broccoli, shiitake, carrots), udon, glass noodles, and dipping sauces.  I opted for Yojie's cut with sukiyaki with egg dip which is $2 additional. I went with the geisha size. The eggs are pasteurized at 140 degrees if you're worried about salmonella. The Angus meat had good marbling compared to the other shabu shabu places that I have been to in Vegas. You can add additional sides or more meat for you sumos.  I will be back and will try the shabu shabu and go for sumo size because I'm a meat fatty and 5 oz wasn't enough. Lastly, I have to mention the hot plates were far or maybe I'm short so I made a mess (sorry!) so be wary of that for you short people.",

    "text": "The Skinny: although the quality of product is okay, meager portions for the price. The flavor of the broth/sauce is alright. (3) service: ambience is modern, service was okay but easily overwhelmed (3), value: for all its nickel and dime tactics,  the value just isn't there. If you must try this place,  come for lunch. They charge extra for dinner without adding any value(3).  FYI - Yojie is located close to Tropical Smoothie cafe and Viva Mercado's.   Walking into the restaurant,  there were 2 guests in eating lunch at around 11:30 am. You are required to sign in even though there is no wait. It was weird because it took a few minutes for anyone to notice we came in.   Regardless we were seated promptly and the menu was explained to us. They have quite a few options of meat but the pricing is based on the size of your protein portion. For most things on the the menu,  sizes were only 5oz (geisha) and 7oz (samurai). Only the Yojie cut had 4 sizing options (3 oz, 5 oz, 7oz, 10oz). This comes with white/brown rice and a bowl of vegetables/noodles.  Kombu broth (water/seaweed) is standard but they charge extra for sukiyaki, spicy miso, or tonkotsu broth ($2/$2/$3 respectively). Sukiyaki comes with an egg while the other broths come with 2 out of 3 dipping sauces which are ponzu, goma (sesame), and their sweet and savory (apparently a ginger teriyaki sauce). Extra sauce,  rice, veggies cost extra.   We ordered the Yojie cut (Sumo sized, $20.99 lunch) and a kurobuta pork(Samurai sized, $17.99) with spicy miso and tonkotsu broth.   The Yojie cut had medium marbling. I was unimpressed that they left a really huge chunk of fat at the end of the pieces of meat (I understand they can't control the huge chunk of fat in the middle). If you are paying by weight, the meat needs to be properly trimmed. The kurobuta pork tasted good but was really fatty as well.   The spicy miso broth and tonkotsu broth (made with alkaline water!... Sorry for the bit of sarcasm) were both okay but it doesn't compare to any half decent ramen joint in terms of flavor even after all the cooking is done. Not worth the premium.   Tried the goma and ponzu and was not impressed.The goma (sesame sauce) was a bit too earthy (can't think of another word for this) for my tastes. The ponzu lacked the True citrus flavor and acidity of yuzu which made it rather pedestrian.   The side of rice and vegetables were really disappointing in portion size. The vegetable bowl looks pretty but there really isn't alot in there. In total: half a slice of onion, 2 small Napa cabbage leaves cut into 4,  4 spinach leaves, half of a small carrot,  1 shitake mushroom,  1 mouth sized amount of enoki, 2 small pieces of broccoli, 2 bite size pieces of tofu,  4 udon noodles and 5 pieces of rice noodles. Oh, and a small bite of pickled daikon and seaweed thrown in there.   They also only give about a half bowl of rice.   Service was very attentive at the beginning when there were only 2 people other than us in the joint. However once there were 6 people in the restaurant,  service became spotty with water refills. And this is when there were at least 2 servers for the restaurant!   Ambience is modern, hipster and ventilation is good but makes it difficult to hear with the music in the background.   Our total for this lunch for 2 was $48 with tax with no drinks or dessert. The food is okay in my books and I have definitely had better. Considering portion sizing, taste, and level of service,  the prices are exorbitant. Given the premium they charge for dinner (for no reason!),  it becomes even more insane. Pass on this place (3 starred review).",

I usually get the combo plate which is 5oz of the yojie's cut and 5oz of another meat your choice.  Typically I get pork belly or salmon.  I always get sukiyaki with the pasteurized egg and a side of Gina sauce.   If you get sukiyaki don't get thrown off about dipping cooked meat into what looks like a raw egg.. It's a game changer.  It makes the bite more buttery and it doesn't add strong egg flavor to it.  Their iced green tea is light and you can get simple syrup to sweeten it up or you could get it mixed with lemonade for added sweetness.  Everyone that works here is really friendly and we've seen Jo Koy here a couple times which is pretty cool.  This place won't disappoint you!",

    "text": "My first shabu shabu experience was at the Yojie Artesia location while visiting Cali cousins and it was AMAAAAZING. I had such a wonderful dining experience and when I heard they were opening a Las Vegas location, I freaked out from excitement!  The overall experience was the same-- a U-shaped bar if you're trying shabu shabu or sukiyaki and some non-bar tables for other food items. The menu looked slightly different. There were some new items (Wagyu, Pork Belly, Swisher sauce, etc) that I didn't see at the Artesia location and also, the prices were higher. Then again, Vegas is always expensive so I wasn't entirely shocked.  I always opt for Samurai Yojie's Cut Shabu Shabu. 7 oz. of delicious meat, although I think I could still kill the Sumo (10 oz.) if I'm a hungry hippo. It comes with the sliced meat, brown or white rice, assorted fresh vegetables, broth, tofu, noodles & 2 sauces (Goma is life!). Swish swish and cook that meat, dip them in your sauces & devour them along with your veggies as you wish. Service is excellent so make sure to ask to customize your overall meal with various seasonings if you love it spicy.  Even with all the food, my friend & I had room for dessert & we ordered the Green Tea White Chocolate with Strawberries and Banana. I almost licked the bowl clean; it was that good. My palate was as happy as my belly. It was a good ending to a yummy meal.  Yojie is a little pricey but the excellent customer service, friendly ambiance, delicious food are worth it. This place is all in all just good vibes! And you never know, you might be able to meet the co-owner, the ever hilarious comedian Jo Koy while dining there. ;)",

The portions of everything were so tiny I had to eat off left overs from my friend's portion. Best part about eating this place was meeting Philip T!   This shabu place is set up as a bar and I didn't like it. Maybe also I like family style hot pot? I guess this is the hip new modern shabu shabu.   The customer service was great and attentive but a little smothering. I understand that it's a soft opening but being asked how's the food every 10 minutes does get too much. I really did like how the waitress went through the whole entire menu with us since we're first timers at Yojie.   I ordered the sukiyaki with pasteurized egg with the Yojie cut geisha size. The broth was honestly way too sweet for my taste. They even diluted it water. I really did like the egg with all the condiments mixed in with it!  I wish I order the spicy miso like Jen Z. ! Her broth was much more savory and rich than mine. I had to switch with her after her meal. The portions of everything was very small. I pretty much ate everything of mine and finished off all of Jen Z's veggies and noodles to feel full. The quality of the meats were superb and fresh!   I'm really glad I got to finally try out this place maybe I'll check out the LA location for the family style shabu shabu.",

    "text": "Okay, a little perspective here. I have had shabu shabu in several different cities around the world and each experience had its own distinction. Yojie falls into my trendy category. It's new, it's modern and from the other reviews I have read, it mildly rubs the traditionalists the wrong way. Good. I don't want to have the same thing I have everywhere else.  I like the bar setup. I like the individual pots. I don't have to worry that my DH can't have seafood because I have an allergy. Furthermore, I don't have to squabble with him over the last piece of tofu in the pot. \"Was that yours?\" \"No, it's mine.\" I take food grudges very seriously.  I do have to admit that I was not familiar with all of the vegetables provided. I did wish there was more tofu and carrots. The meat (I had beef) was sliced perfectly, however it could have been in slightly shorter pieces. The Sumo portion is 10 oz. and id regarded as XL, it was what I considered a regular portion. The goma (sesame) sauce was delicious. The only real complaint I had were technical difficulties. I didn't have a plate to put my cooked meat on and there was no skimmer to clear the water. In spite of that, the restaurant is clean tending toward spartan.  Now, I will forever love my regular shabu shabu restaurant in Green Valley, but I see myself coming to Yojie quite often. One of the main reasons being that is much closer to my area of town (only a few miles closer but far more convenient).  The service was prompt and pleasant, the servers as far as I could see were delightfully polite and attentive.",

I let them know my dissatisfaction but decided to give them another chance tonight and found that it has gotten worse.  We had this server with purple hair who was clueless.  Found out that they had run out of both cuts of meat that my wife and I wanted.  On top of that, they really short-changed me by giving me only 1/4 of a small mushroom and a few strands of glass noodles to put in the broth.  We called a more senior server over and she got me fixed up but I don't like to have to keep complaining to get what I paid for.  We gave them a second chance but now I think of that old adage: \"Fool me one time, shame on you.  Fool me two times, shame on me\"  I have a sense that they are not surviving well (mismanaged) and probably won't be around much longer.  So sad, it used to be pretty good, albeit overpriced.",

    "text": "We came here with another couple after a movie at Village Square theater. The restaurant is just across the parking lot, so we didn't even have to move the car. The restaurant is fairly small and dominated by a horseshoe shaped counter, with the servers in the center. All seating is at the counter. Each place setting has a \"burner\" where the bowl heating the liquid to cook your food is placed. This was our first experience with shabu-shabu dining. Carl, our main server, came over immediately and explained the dining experience we were about to have. My wife and I opted to share the combo plate with Angus beef and salmon ($5 surcharge for sharing but they give you lots of extras - so very worth it). Our friends shared the chicken and Angus beef combo. That way we each got to sample the beef, chicken and salmon - a highly recommended strategy for other first timers. I chose to cook in spicy miso while my wife chose alkaline water/seaweed broth. In addition to the meats, they serve a large portion of fresh veggies (cabbage, carrots, broccoli, and more), tofu and noodles, also to be cooked at the table. After you cook your food, you can dip it in one of 3 dipping sauces - Goma (a sesame base), Ponzu (citrus soy), or Swisher (sweet and savory). The meal includes a good sized bowl of either brown or white rice. The salmon was sashimi grade so it could be eaten without cooking. I had some of mine that way. Very fresh tasting and flavorful. The beef was sliced incredibly thin so it cooked really fast. Also delicious. As was the chicken. Anton, the owner, came over during the meal to make sure everything was going well. He is very personable and answered any of our remaining questions.  Excellent food, service and ambiance. Who knew cooking your own dinner in a restaurant could be that much fun. The only negative is that there is only counter seating, so it is difficult to be social when you are a party of 4 or more. Also, the restaurant is fairly new so they don't have a liquor license yet, so no beer or wine with the meal. I am sure they will have it when we come back. And we certainly will come back!",

I don't have Japanese fondue often, but when I want some shabu shabu I always come here. I love the interior of this place, very modern, simple and clean. While you're enjoying your meal sitting at either the high top bar or the standard tables across, the TVs overhead are usually showing either Japanese game shows or anime, which has always made my dinner experience better. Their service is great. The staff always makes sure any new-timers know the how-to's of shabu shabu. The price is a bit high for a meal but the experience is worth it. Would definitely come back anytime.",

It is so sweet, in my attempt to dilute the broth, I dumped a whole glass of water with the ice in the pot without even thinking. Even with a whole cup of water it still remained super sweet. Three of us all ordered the signature Sukiyaki broth and by the end of the night, all had the same complaint, too sweet and overpowering.  They really skim on the veggies, really sad. Felt like there was like 6-7 pieces of cut veggies, 2 shaved pieces of carrots, 1 cube of tofu, and that was it. Comparing to other hot pot restaurants, a whole plate of veggies usually accompanies the meal. The veggies here looked like mere decorations to your noodles.  Overall great cuts of meats, great ambiance, hip and clean, other than that would not be returning. The competition is strong out there my friends.",

Came here and got the Prime rib in Samurai portion (7oz for $24.99) with the pork (tonkotsu) broth which costs $3 extra. Had the brown rice and asked to replace udon with clear noodle but that wasn't an option. Personally, I believe the meal had too much carbs and was quite scant with the actual protein and vegetables which was disappointing to me. The ponzu dipping sauce, which I generally liked a lot, was lacking in yuzu flavor and sodium soy-sauce heavy.  The meat was fine but the broth leans on the salty side. The green tea was kind of interesting as it had came in a cool contraption which allows the liquid to stream down to the cup when placed over the rim.  If I had anything positive to say about Yojie, it is that service was excellent. The lady who served our meals was really friendly and prompt.",

They pretty much figured it all out. While it may be on the pricier side, most hot pot places do charge a fairly high amount for their meats, but yojies definitely is worth your time for the experience you get.  I always crave this place when I think of meat. Better than kbbq, the meat quality is something that makes you want to keep coming back. Never dry, never hard. I love their sauces which are so delicious, goma and ponzu would be my sauces of choice.   Unlimited rice, multiple veggies and noodles, this place will definitely fill you up right!",

    "text": "Music and hot pot is definitely the highlight of my experience here.  The use of old school hip hop and R&B and raw egg as a dipping sauce is fantastic.  But the icing on the cake is when you watch people who don't know how to eat Japanese Fondue with a piece of raw egg in front of them.  My go to here is the prime rib and sukiyaki with a cherry blossom tea.  If you've never ate here, don't be shy to ask staff on how to eat things.  However, it's important to note that you just add veggies to your soup to flavor it up for your meat which should be swished in the broth for about 10 seconds only.  The raw egg is used as a dipping sauce for your veggies and meat!  Magic!  The only negative part that I would say is the side by side seating.  So if you have a party of more than 1 then you would have to lean forward or back to communicate with the person you're not sitting next to.",

I wish they had a location closer to the strip, but making the drive over is pretty worth it.  I usually go for the yojie cut with spicy miso broth. The meat has nice marble to it and tastes reaaaaally good with the spicy miso broth. I've tried sukiyaki before, and it was actually a little too sweet for my taste. It also comes with udon noodles, a bunch of veggies, and rice, which are all unlimited. I do also recommend the desserts. It's been a while before I got the green tea fondue, but that was good. On my latest trip, I ordered the ube ice cream which came with three scoops and a tiny mint leaf on top. Yummy.  The service here is usually pretty friendly and quick. The space is small, and it isn't hard getting the servers' attention. I asked if they could change the channel to an NBA playoff game, and they changed the channel right after I asked. Great service!  The interior is very modern and stylish. There are a few pieces on the wall that look cool. They're always playing great music, usually 90s-2000s R&B/hip hop.   Consistently delivers high quality food, service, and a great vibe!",

The udon they use is super cheap quality cause it's soggy after 40 secs.   I was the only customer during lunch and ordered the Yojie samurai cut for lunch $18+tax. I had them charge without looking at the bill and came out to 22.50 and left a separate $2 tip. Got to my car and realized that even at 10% sales tax it's should of came out to $20.... she either overcharged or there was a built in tip that I was not informed about.  Maybe if you get off your phone and stop talking to the line cook in the back you'd notice- won't be returning again for this kind of service.",

I was surprised to learn that this place existed and my first initial thought was that this was a dessert type of restaurant. That's just part of the menu. It's located in a huge plaza full of other restaurants and stores.  The time it took to be seated took a while because there's not that many seats available. It wasn't crowded but my group had to wait for enough seats to open up. The customer service wasn't terrible but it could be faster. They weren't as attentive in the beginning and I waited for a while before the food came out. One of the serves definitely caught me eye as she was very cheerful and interactive with the customers. She attended to my group towards the end and unexpectedly offered free mochi ice cream.  The food itself tastes delicious!! I've had shabu several times before in California and this place was definitely up to their standards! It is on the pricer side, but I believe that it's reasonable for the quality that they provide. I ordered a suziyaki large Yojie cut which had me full and content.",

The lighting was perfect.. this is no joke but there was soft music playing in the background and if you listened closely.. it was tupac.. I was blown away... this place made tupac sound like Marvin Gaye just by adjusting the lighting.. blown away.. 90s hip-hop literally played softly in the background lol it was the best. All of that warm fun stuff aside the broth was great.. look I can't explain everything about a place where you just make your own soup lol you'll have to take my word for it AND get the chocolate dipped strawberries..",

My husband tried the spicy miso broth so I cooked some in it.  It was Ok.  I would not order it as the slightly richer & sweeter Sukiyaki broth is such a delightful flavor.   We loved the assortment of vegetables & would request additional shiitake mushrooms when we return as the Sukiyaki broth is richer with more of these type of mushrooms.  Writing about this makes me want to go again soon... Do you know how good it is!   We tried the desert fondue & it was great!   Also the bubblegum tasting Japanese soda with a small scoop of ice cream. Like a root beer float, Japanese style. It was refreshing... Ok   The highlight here is the nice clean set up. The great service from Chef O... The incredibly delicious Sukiyaki.  There is an amazing Sushi restaurant in this same mall. Hanabi. I would like to start at Hanabi... Have some Sushi and go to this restaurant for Sukiyaki. They should have a Japanese progressive dinner event! Both places are Excellent.",

I've heard so many great things about this place from my peers and this place seriously did not disappoint me one bit.   The service was impeccable. The chef and the server really pay attention to your broth from being low and they actually do a little Shabu Shabu 101 with you if you've never had something like it before. Never had to ask for water and the servers actually talk to you and are super friendly and helpful.   Since I've never been to this location, our lady server talked about the menu in detail. You have choices of four different broth types. The Shabu Shabu broth, sukiyaki, spicy miso, and tonkotsu. The meats vary in price and size. She recommended to me the combination choices of meat where you could choose pork belly, pork, chicken, and salmon. It also comes along side with yojies angus meat.   My order? I ended up choosing the spicy miso along side my two dipping sauces of ponzu and peanut sauce base. The spicy miso was super flavorful. Went so well with the veggies, meat, and udon noodles that came with it. I went with her recommendation and ordered the combo meat. Need I tell you, it was super filling! At the very end of my meal, we ordered the fruits and pastries fondue. The fondue base was a green tea white chocolate. I seriously never had something like that before. I was so happy inside! What I recommend? Cut the pastry in half and the fruits to dip in the fondue together. It creates a balance. It's so gooooood!  I was completely impressed at the service, the design of the restaurant, and most importantly the food. Will definitely come back here again. I completely love it and will be the best Shabu spot here in Vegas for me :).",

    "text": "This is a really really great place to go to if you are craving something a little bit different! The food is shabu shabu style, where you are given very thin slices of meat, a bowl of noodles and vegetables, and a mini stove with boiling broth, and you cook your meal in the broth. Super interactive and delicious, and you get a choice of broth and choice of meat. I have tried the Yojie's cut, the wagyu cut, the spicy miso broth, and the tonkatsu; all are really tasty! The staff is extremely helpful especially if you've never been to a shabu shabu place before, and they'll even put a cute sign on your station that says, \"first time\" where they'll walk you through the process step by step. I have also had the dessert which is a green tea fondue with a very cute fruit and cake presentation set up. The area itself is a bit small and the tables are 2 long and extended benches (one higher and one lower) and the price is dependent on the cut of meat you get and whether it's lunch or dinner time; the Yojie's cut for lunch is around $15. Overall, this is a favorite place of mine to go to and I frequently bring friends and family to have a good meal!",

    "text": "I've been craving this and there aren't many hot pot places in Vegas. I wish there was a closer location to me since I'm closer to Silverado Ranch area so this is almost a 30 minute drive.  The first thing I noticed was how they have induction burners at every seat and the set up is kind of like bar seating. I really liked that. It's a lot nicer than carrying out a burner and only having one burner per table like another place I've been to.  There's three broths to choose from: shabu-shabu, sukiyaki, and spicy miso. I've only had the spicy miso and it comes with 2 dipping sauces, I picked the ponzu (citrus soy sauce) and gomu (sesame sauce). They're all very flavorful and they do offer green onion, garlic, radish, a Japanese chili powder, soy sauce, and the spicy drops. The spicy miso isn't too spicy so I added a bit more spice.  I ordered the combo plate in the lunch geisha size. And it comes with 5oz Yojie's cut angus steak, 5oz salmon sashimi, a bowl of white or brown rice, and a bowl of veggies that has some udon noodles. It's a pretty good size portion even if you just order the Geisha size of a single item, it's about 5 thin sliced pieces of meat. Last time I couldn't finish everything and was able to cook it in the broth and take it home, I guess I was really hungry and finished everything today. I'm not sure what the differences are between the lunch and the dinner sizes. Maybe the dinner has more veggies and noodles?  Overall I really like this place. The food is very flavorful and fresh and they have a good variety on the menu. There's never been a wait when I've come for lunch. It can be a bit tricky to find since it's in a big plaza but it's right next to Joy Yee's.",

We chose Yojie's cut (angus beef) and pork belly from the combo plate. Sharing is only an additional $4.99 and you get your own rice (white or brown), sauce, and personal pot. We had shabu shabu pot and spicy miso pot. I preferred the miso - it gave the meat a little kick. Shabu was boiling water.  They don't have a liquor license yet so we couldn't order any beer/sake.  They explain the process if you are new to this style of eating. Very friendly and helpful.",

I love the ambiance and the customer care was on point. They will be your spirit guides into the fun world of Shabu Shabu. As you take into this journey of boiling hot goodness, you will savor flavors from just shabu shabu (which is the plain broth) all the way to Miso Spicy (my fave)--i love that it gives that essential kick you long for in your food. I ordered the Yojie Cut (great angus beef), with the Atlantic Salmon **at sashimi grade** slices, and it was amazing. All the flavors come together when topped with the Goma sauce on RICE! Veggies that come with your meal are fresh and crunchy, so don't over cook! Watch your items like they're your first born child, for with this in mind handling with care AT ALL TIMES. Altogether, finish your journey with some desert. I had the ube ice cream (just coz), but they're well known for their fruits dipped in chocolate fondue so TREAT YoSELF!",

I promise I won't seat you at the end and I'll take good care of you the WHOLE time. I'll make sure your tea is hot!\"  It's a little awkward to be recognized for my critical review, but his desire to change my mind about Yojie was very impressive!  Game on!    Carl kept his word and refilled my tea with piping hot water throughout my meal.  He was attentive to our needs and took care of me from start to finish.   We've become regulars, visiting about 2-4 times per month.  Although Yojie is much more pricey than other shabu shabu places in town, their quality in meat & service is much better, so it's worth it if you can afford to treat yourself every now and then.    Recently I went in and Carl was NOT working. Trust me, this is a very rare occurrence.  He's ALWAYS there.  I was a little hesitant being that the last time he went on a break while I was there, I left feeling like it wasn't that great of an experience.  We decided to stay anyway and we are glad we did!  I can't remember the sweet girls name, but she was great.  She was attentive and helpful, no complaints.  Phew!     Like any new place in town, it always takes a minute to perfect things...and Yojie has.  It's impressive to me that the server cared enough to read the review that was written, remember me, and accommodate my annoying little complaints.  Lol.  I also think he's become the manager since our first visit, so he's doing a great job in making sure the staff are up to par in their service as well.   5 stars, Yojie.  Bravo!",

Our waitress I believe her name was Valerie was prompt, helpful and nice to talk to. Our green tea was always full.  The reason for the minus 2 stars was the lack of miso flavor in the spicy miso and the lack of veggies. I love Shabu-Shabu and have tried many different locations. The broth missed the spot. It was supposed to be spicy miso but both the spice and miso was missing. The veggie choice and quantity was also lacking. Come one 1 broccoli. 2 total pieces of mushrooms, that does not cut it.   The highlight was the meat. We had the prime rib and it was of good quality.  I will try other Shabu places before deciding if I will be back.",

I LOVE shabu.... it would be my go to whenever I can't think of something to eat because it is like a home cooking meal... plus you can keep yourself entertained by cooking your own food if you are eating ALONE!   Just like MOST shabu places that I have dined at... they have individual pots & burners for each person on a high counter top... although lately I have been seeing more places w/ low counter tops which is nice just in case if you can't get onto the high top! This place is clean cut & simply decorated which I always like when there isn't too much clutter! They have one side bright & other side dark, & the counter tops are all white (makes me cautious of how I eat so I don't look like a SLOB ahahahaaa)   Our server \"O\" (that's his name) was freaken AWESOME so calm & professional yet very friendly & approachable... he made me a little jealous as being a server myself made me admire the way he carried himself. He informed us of what they were about & all the steps of the process... we wanted but he whole experience even though we know everything about shabu after trying so many different places in Cali.  SAMURAI YOJIE'S CUT $20.99 - Hubby got this w/tonkatsu base which is $2.99 more but that DAMN soup base is freaken DERICIOUS!!!!! You just can't stop slurping up the soup. Samurai size is 7 oz. of meat.  GEISHA PORK BELLY (side)$5.99 - I guess if you add a side it's cheaper as we are fatties we wanted more variety & got a side of thinly sliced pork belly that complimented the tonkatsu soup base so well! the geisha is 5 oz. of meat.  SUMO YOJIE'S CUT $23.99 - I eat more than the bois & got the SUMO size which is 10 oz. of meat which is nice that they also state how many oz. everything is so you know how much to expect. This cut although I dunno what exactly it is... it's dericious... ahahaha   SAMURAI PRIME RIB $24.99 - roomie got this & it was good as well... but IMHO I can't really taste the difference when it is shabu... but.. definitely wanna try the wagyu one day which I am SURE you could taste the difference.  GTWC STRAWBERRY & BANANA $6.99 - This was a dessert fondue. umm... I really hated that I had to share... but I at least got to eat/ drink/ slurp down the rest of the Green Tea White Chocolate fondue sauce. =] w/ the help of O I was able to stay classy as he brought me a little spoon to devour the sauce in class.   ICE COFFEE $3.99 - chilled & served w/ cream & simple syrup on the side. CALPICO $3.99 - served w/ a cherry which makes it fun  CHERRY BLOSSOM TEA $3.99 - this was served in the newest technology for tea brewing which I have seen a lot at teavanna where you stick the bottom of the pot to the top of the cup.  I WILL BE BACK TOO MANY TIMES IN THE FUTURE I KNOW IT...",

    "text": "I love the idea of shabu shabu, it's a great interactive experience. Very convenient especially during winter time.  SERVICE The workers welcome you when you walk in. If it's your first time they explain how shabu shabu (Japanese fondue) work and the process of it. They are very knowledgable of the menu, and answer all the questions you may have. Awesome customer service and friendly all around.  FOOD I got the YojieCut Geisha with white rice, spicy miso broth, and ponzu & goma sauce. The broth is delicious, it's actually spicy compared to most places. The meat quality is wonderful, the price not so much but it's worth it. Dipping the meat in goma sauce brings a wonderful nutty flavor while the ponzu enhances the meat flavor (in my opinion). The rice is refillable and your meal comes with a vegetable bowl (cabbage, carrots, mushroom, onion, broccoli, and seaweed) and noodles (udon and rice noodles). The Ramune float is a great desert because it's refreshing and not too sweet or heavy after your meal. The strawberries and banana fondue with green tea white chocolate is delicious too.   CONCLUSION I will be back soon, love the food and atmosphere (very modern and chic).",

Their service was so amazing when they first opened that they were so pushy but you felt like they gave you their undivided attention.  The only person who was nice to me was the gentleman in the supreme hat. The girls that were the servers ignored me four different times when I had questions or needed something, and asked for the bill! Soooooo rude they would just look at me and walk away. They didn't check if my boiler was too high or low because they were no where to be found. Keep in mind I came literally an hour before they closed and I stayed for only 30 minutes during the process. I think I'm going to go to swish or just go to the Yojie in LA. Terrrrrible service.",

I love the elegant presentation and attention to detail in the restaurant's layout, menu, and food presentation.    First, you select your meat.  I ordered the Yojie's Cut.  Second, you select your broth.  I ordered Tonkatsu Broth.  Third, you select a size. I ordered a Sumo (extra large).  Fourth, you select two dipping sauces.  I ordered Ponzu and Goma.  Orders come with a bowl of rice and a bowl of vegetables and noodles.  You can get free refills of broth, dipping sauces, and rice.    The meat was fresh and not frozen, like at some hot pot restaurants.  The broth was not the best I have had, but was pretty good.  My favorite thing is that each person gets their own broth and own heating plate for their broth, whereas many hot pot restaurants require people to share broths.  Overall, I was not wowed by the food, but I loved the presentation and concept.",

Plus some really great suggestions were offered.  Opted for the Yojie cut with Sukiyaki broth, brown rice, signature green tea,  tiramisu tea, fruit and pastries fondue. Nothing disappointed at all. The entire experience was brilliant and one to be expected especially if your with good company. The food is displayed with meat on one plate,  add-ons in a high bowl, and broth on the burner. As you slowly add your desired creation, wait for it to cook, and eat. Loved it.   Interior is open middle section for staff to attend to all patrons, while each seating arrangement is in sit up bar style with its own burner. The broth and rice are unlimited. Everything was clean, and great music was playing in the background.   Would thoroughly recommend- plus it's Jo Koy restaurant- one of my fav comedians. Pricing is a reflection of quality and presentation   Location is Sahara/ Ft Apache- ample parking",

Since being in such close quarters I think it has to be.   Meat is fresh and the broth was good enough. I ended up getting a sukiyaki broth which was a little sweeter than what I remember, albeit compared to Santa Ana location Yojie and shabu joints. Maybe just a bit more concentrated, I would say.  I ended up ordering combo salmon dinner menu ($28.99). Don't know if there was that much worth of protein, but dinner was sufficient.  Again, I'm just comparing to the Yojie that was once in Santa Ana, but here there was no full bar and I was really looking forward to a nice glass of Japanese Whiskey. The were however, beer and sake.    Overall a pleasant experience, but compared to my first Yojie experience it was fair.  Still come have a look though.",

Upon walking in, the restaurant is clean with a nice and calming atmosphere! The staff there are extremely nice and the food is AMAZING! The seating arrangement is shaped like a U and in the middle, they have the bowls and everything there.   When I go here, I usually get the geisha because it is so filling! They have 3 sizes of meats to pick from, ranging from 10, 15, and 20 slices (A.K.A. small, medium, large). You first pick what kind of meat you want (I usually get the regular meat in a geisha size- I think that has about 10 slices of meat?) and it comes with a heaping bowl of veggies, udon noodles (thick white noodles) and a bowl of brown or white rice. The broth I usually get is the sukiyaki sauce, which is a sweet soy sauce broth with seasonings with the raw egg. There are other broths on the menu as well and I haven't tried them because I just love the sukiyaki broth,  Okay, I know it sounds weird but you get the raw egg, scramble it and dip your cooked meat in it! I throw a lot of the chili powder in the egg too to add a kick of spices. I suggest throwing in the harder veggies to cook first then slowly throwing in the udon noodles as you eat. I say that about the udon noodles because when it's cooked, starch comes out of the noodles so it makes the broth too thick. SOOOO FILLING and soooo yummy! All in all, I will be coming back here, kind of far of a drive but soooooo worth it!",

This is like Korean BBQ, but without the smokey smell and long wait for food to cook. I have nothing to compare this place to, so I'm sure this place is high up there.   Every seat has an electric stove to keep your pot... hot... (LOL). You choose your meat, soup, and sauces. The meat comes sliced up and pretty on a plate. I like my foods spicy, so I got the spicy miso (yummy!) and for my meat: the Yojie Chef's Cut (regular size, it was enough to feed me, but I would get the next size up next time!). I also got a ponzo and some sort of sesame sauce. Everything was so good. The meat is thinly sliced and you just put the meat in your hot pot and it just cooks it! Wow! Your order also comes with vegetables and noodles. You can put all those things in there, then once your done with your meat, eat the noodles and your soup! It was a great meal and I'm definitely going to come again!",

    "text": "Ya'll, Yojie is the real deal! I've had it bookmarked for a few years but only recently was willing to drive 30 min to get there. I will be driving there more often because it was fantastic.   Three of us visited on a Monday night and there were a few other groups dining but it was not nearly as busy as I expected it to be. They have high and low bar seating so we chose the low and started off with Asahi draft (BOGO!). The servers were very nice and since it's a bar setup it's very easy for them to walk the line and check up on everyone throughout the meal. We explained we've had shabu shabu before but he was kind in explaining the differences in broth (spicy miso, tonkatsu, sukiyaki, and plain water with dipping sauces). I ordered the Yojie cut, geisha size with the sukiyaki broth and pasteurized egg. My boyfriend got the Kobe beef with spicy miso. It always sounds good to get the Kobe beef but I feel that dunking it in a heavy sesame sauce sort of kills any flavor of the meat.   The sukiyaki broth was heavenly: light but full of flavor. Slightly sweet, maybe mirin, sake and soy sauce? And the egg for dipping gives the meat a creamy, buttery taste. SO. GOOD. I think everyone I dined with and the servers all agree the sukiyaki is the way to go. I liked the taste of the spicy miso but with the other two dipping sauces it's a little bit of a flavor whirlwind. The vegetables are fresh and plentiful. They bury udon noodles underneath for the end of the meal, which is good because if you ate them straight away you'd probably get full quickly.   Pro Tips for Sukiyaki or Shabu Shabu:   - You can use your chopsticks to pick up the raw meat and eat the cooked meat. They provide tongs but traditionally you use your chopsticks. - Only cook the meat for a few seconds by gliding it through the broth. Veggies can cook longer.  - Dip the meat in the egg or dipping sauce and rest it in the bowl of rice. The rice soaks up the juices and can be eaten with the meat or separately but it is an important part of the meal!  I do agree that traditionally you would eat sukiyaki or shabu shabu in a communal way with the hot pot in the center of the table but I didn't have a problem eating alongside my companions. It makes the experience more personal and you kind of have blinders on to enjoy it yourself. I also agree that \"Japanese fondue\" is a bit misleading and I think you can give people more credit - they probably have heard of shabu shabu.   Anyways Yojie is for sure my number one shabu place now and I can't wait to tell everyone about it.",

I ordered the tonkatsu broth with the prime rib meat regular size. I feel like the serving is on the smaller size. My friend got the chef's cut in sumo which is supposed to be extra large serving. I am comparing it to the serving size of the other hotpot that I have been to and I can say this is way smaller. The veggies servings are average. The staff are nice though. I did notice that they were at the kitchen most of the time which leaves us (customers) just waiting until they come out. I think they just need more servers on Friday to Sunday nights especially. The prices are comparable to the other hotspots in LA but I think it's more expensive here given the serving. There is plenty of parking though. Will I come back? I'm not sure.",

There was literally no one in the restaurant but yet it took so long for us (2 people) to get our food and even when I asked for a spoon it took a while. The vibe I was getting from the waitress was not attentive.   Second time coming in was on Valentine's day at 8pm. 2 people left as I came in. While waiting for them to clean up it took them 15 mins before I got irritated and just walked myself over and sat down. Yes they were busy but they knew I was waiting there and didn't even acknowledge me to have a seat. Barely checked up on us and was attending to everybody else. Took so long to just get a check. I was in a hurry to leave for work. Again, asked for a plastic spoon and they took at least 5 minutes. I had told them I'm in a hurry! I made it known about the service by giving a small tip. The same waitress was there also. I honestly feel the girls there were unprofessional by their young sense of immaturity in service.   This is the only shabu place in Vegas I would ever go to that can compare to the shabus in California. They need to polish up on their service if they want loyal customers.",

We ordered the pork belly, yojie cut and kobe beef with spicy miso and tonkotsu broths. Portions were hearty.   Also tried the green tea white chocolate for dessert, but wish I had just gotten regular milk chocolate. Glad I tried something different as it sounded intriguing, but was just ok.   Dinner and dessert for two came in at under $100, not bad. We felt stuffed at the end  Overall, it was an awesome dinner and we will definitely be back again. Great experience and tasty food!",

If you want to go eat more then yojie cut is good.  I had the spicy miso- great season.  We ended up with the dark chocolate fondue- my son demolished it. I highly recommend this place.

It came with plastic infuser.  I immediate thought that was bad sign.. Restaurants that serve hot beverages in plastic containers have no idea how plastic harm our body.  I drank a little bit, it was just warm tea... The tea taste like Cherry Blossom tea from The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf.  Vegetable dish came next with a pot with water and a small piece of kombu in it. Water in the pot was much less than usual shabu shabu.  Some Nappa were already cut pieces but 3 giant leaves Nappas were in a middle of the dish on Udon noodles... A waitress asked me if I want scissors. I said no thank you because I was scared that if the scissors were used for meat to cut (I am a vegan) The giant Nappas were difficult to eat. 2 pieces of Shiitake Mushrooms cut halves so 4 pierces of them and 2 very small portions of Enoki Mushrooms (very very small). I expected more different kind of mushrooms. Some Harusame, some pieces of Tofu, 4 thin slice of carrots, some pieces of broccoli, some slices of onion, some wakame...  And finally the important part, Tare (dipping sauce). I ordered Ponzu and Goma (sesame).  The waitress said Ponzu and Goma are house made so I thought must be good.  I dipped my vegetable into Goma.... It was very weird taste... Not even taste of goma... It was more like... taste of very bad broth and cheap miso... ok... I wanted to try ponzu next... The ponzu taste was weird too... I didn't taste of citrus like sour soy sauce... This is too like some kind of bad broth with something I don't know... I asked the waitress what the broth was.. She said Hondashi!!! OMG!!! This restaurant uses Hondashi!!! It contains bonito fish and lots of lots of MSG!!!! That's why the dipping sauce taste were weird, I didn't use them after I found out the broth. May be this restaurant is good for non Japanese people. But you are Japanese, you know the shabu shabu, you have eaten real shabu shabu, or you like to eat real shabu shabu, this is NOT real Japanese shabu shabu place to go. I'm sorry...  But it's True.. I really recommend that this restaurant owner should go to Japan and must eat shabu shabu so he/she knows what the real shabu shabu taste like.  The waitress was nice so I gave 2 stars.  I'm stick with Shabu Shabu restaurant I go regularly. I also recommend that owner take down \"Japanese\" from name because this is not...",

Our first visit was pleasant and enjoyable and our server was attentitve and organized.  But the second visit, on the following day, was a big downer.  If the days were switched, there would not be a repeat visit.   We sat down in the midst of uncleared dishes and left-over food all around us and it remains that way throughout our dining.  Very unsightly and dampens our appetite for sure and I counted no less than three workers all looking at the dirty dishes.  Where is the manager to pitch in ?  We have to remind our server for everything from sauces to utensils while we watched a boiling pot.  The rice on both days were cold and hard.  When the rice has this big clumps, it can only mean one thing - it has seen its days!   This place looks promising at first but we don't plan to be back for awhile.",

When my brother and I were finally in Vegas at the same time, he insisted I just HAD to go try it out.  Fan of Jokoy? EVEN BETTER! I believe he is one of the owners or partners of Yojie for this location, so if you support him, YOU BETTER DINE HERE!  On the menu, they have a box around the common/popular items, which are the yojie's cut for the plate and sukiyaki for the broth. As a first timer, that is exactly what I ordered in their large size.  All plates come with a bowl of vegetables (lettuce, carrots, shiitake mushrooms, etc.), noodles (which I believe were udon), and your choice of brown or white rice.  If you have a big appetite, I would recommend getting the samurai (large) or the sumo (x-large) because the meat slices are thin, which also makes it easier and faster to cook in your bowl/pot.   The sukiyaki broth is sweet and oh so wonderful. It comes with a fresh PASTEURIZED egg, which you use as a dip for your meat. So before you judge people dipping their meats into what looks like a raw egg, just remember it is pasteurized and tastes amazing!!! I almost don't even want to describe the whole thing and give it away because I feel like people should just come here and try it for themselves lol.  Service is excellent!! I wish I could remember the name of the manager or owner/the super cool zen dude who runs the place, but he's full of good vibes and is extra generous. He interacts with all customers and helps out his employees.  I can't wait to come back here again!",

We also had the pastries and fruit dessert. The meats were sliced to perfection, the vegetables and noodles were super fresh, and the broths were out of this world! Every bite was stellar!    The service here is INCREDIBLE! It's unreal how good the service is.  Michael, Ty, and Kelsey (the manager) were so friendly and attentive.  We felt like we were the only customers in the room.  We will definitely be back! Maybe this weekend! I need more Yojie in my life!",

Flavor explosion  there were 4 of us we ordered the Kobe Beef and the prime rib, we were able to mix our dipping sauces which was perfect. They brought out a raw egg for dipping after cooking our meats and I must say  it was amazing , the buttery flavor of dipping in the egg was phenomenal. I was almost bummed when I didn't see anyone drinking until I looked to the right and saw someone drinking a frosty cold one! We also had some flavored Saki ! Desert was awesome gourmet doughnuts  , fresh bananas & strawberries   to dip in a gourmet green tea chocolate  dipping sauce.  The whole feng shui and vibe of this place is dope I give it both thumbs up   I would have taken pictures but the food was so good I forgot.",

That being said, you can still share meat and veggies but everyone gets their own broth. Speaking of the broth, they're all delicious. My wife had the spicy miso and I had the sukiyaki. The miso was pretty spicy, but not ever powering. The sukiyaki was something brand new to me. It's loaded with flavor, very sweet, but tempered well by the raw egg you dip all your meat and veggies in after cooking in the broth. I will definitely be going here again. The service was fast and friendly and very informative.",

    "text": "This was my first time going to Yojie. I hear there are locations in California as well but I have never tried them. Make sure you take a jacket! It is seriously chilly in there. Since it was my first time, they put a little block in front of us that said \"first timers\" or something like that. The girl that helped us was super adorable with huge eyes. She was so sweet in explaining everything and how it worked. I tried the cherry blossom team because I read on Yelp that it was super duper scrumptious - it was good indeedy! It comes in this really cool container and you put it on top of your cup and press down - and it comes squirting out like pee haha I got the shabu shabu style with the most popular yojie cut of meat. At first when I had gotten it, I didn't think it was that much food and thought that I would have to order more. I was wrong! It was so filling that I didn't have any room for dessert. The boyfriend and my other friend got the kobe style meat cut with tonkatsu broth. I highly recommend the tonkatsu broth. It was so yummy that I kept stealing his broth. My shabu shabu broth was too plain for me. In the end though, she adds some sauce to the bowl and adds the water from your dish and makes udon noodles. It was really good.   The only thing is that they don't have a liquor license yet so there is no alcohol! I didn't dock off a star for this because it isn't their fault. I definitely plan on coming here more often since its close to the crib!!!",

SHABU SHABU is japanese hot pot where thinly sliced proteins are dipped into a boiling pot of broth.  Their choices of broth included spicy miso, sukiyaki, tonkatsu or traditional shabu shabu.  The dipping sauces were on point: goma( sesame base), ponzu ( citrus soy), and swisher ( like teriyaki), each mixed with green onions, chili powder, and daikon.  Their brown rice is good and also refillable, along with the hot pot of broth.   I would definitely come back and maybe try their sukiyaki broth which is served with a raw egg on the side to dip the meat in.",

Another plus for being open during lunch with lower prices. Green tea chocolate fondue desert was great too.  Service and decor are nice. Although, I went during lunch when it was slow and they didn't get their liquor license yet, but hopefully it picks up.",

Yojie is an amazing restaurant not only for the great food but great service. I lived in Japan for 3 years and can vouch this is fantastic shabu-shabu. When you go into Yojie you're not just eating an amazing clean meal but having an experience with a great staff and fun environment. Jo Koy and his staff are hands down the best in Vegas. Yojie is a must for either a date night or family meal.",

The employees were knowledgeable, willing to teach, and were very attentive. Not only that, but their whole vibe was great! You could tell the employees were enjoying their time working which made the experience wonderful & worth sharing. I can't wait to go back. It's a little pricey, but worth every penny!

    "text": "My first time eating here was great. The restaurant is clean; the atmosphere, classy; and the food, delicious.   The layout of the restaurant makes for easy and quick service, as customers are basically seated around the servers. There are TVs placed around the tables in case your date is boring, and your phone is running out of battery. (Just kidding, but when I was there, they were playing this hilarious Japanese show about obstacle courses. My friend and I were thoroughly entertained.)  The prices for the menu items are justified, considering the market prices of the different types of meat. I ordered the yojie's cut with sukiyaki broth and brown rice for dinner. My server was attentive enough to make sure I was ok with the egg being uncooked, which I appreciate a great deal.   The stoves are controlled by the servers, and the water takes some time to heat up, but once it's hot, the meat cooks extremely quickly. Each table top has a bottle of water that is used both for drink refills and cooking water refills. Water and rice refills are free. I honestly love how self-paced this restaurant is, while also keeping servers close to the customers at all times. The restaurant also has cute \"first-timer\" signs to put in front of customers, so servers will come to explain various aspects of the shabu-shabu eating experience to them.  This place has an eye for the small details. I will definitely come back.",

I went with the large portion of yojie cut meat called samurai. Lots of food barely finished it. However, the next time I went I got the medium portion of yojie cut meat called geisha, still filled me up. So portion sizes are great and you get  the complimentary veggies, udon noodles and rice (brown or white) with your meal.   I always get the Sukiyaki broth which comes with a pasteurized egg. Haven't tried the others, but maybe I will next time.   Glad this shabu shabu place is near me on the west side of town. It beats going into the town.",

Like it has a box around it, I always the super sweet broth. But last time I tried the tonkotsu & let one of the servers mix some spices & seasonings etc. AMAZING. I just love this place. They play some funny Japanese version of ABC family's \"wipeout\" although ABC might have copied this Japanese style show. But regardless when it's a full house, the entire restaurant is laughing together & it's contagious. It makes your Friday night a whole lot of fun. The green tea white chocolate is amazing. I always suggest it. It gets a little pricey for the other stuff on the menu so it's good to also share. However they do add a sharing \"fee\".",

The Ponzu sauce and the sweeter sauce are definitely worth getting. The beef was thin but so soft and juicy. Was wonderful with ponzu, and the salmon quickly dipped for a seared salmon texture and dipped in the sweet sauce was like dessert.   Ordered their green tea. Very good. Not too over powering.  And the fruit and pastry platter with the Green Tea White Chocolate sauce. Also very good.   While it's not something my husband would eat any time soon, I might be adding this place to my list of Monday lunches. Even the baby liked the Udon noodles.",

He recommended the fondue dessert with the ube ice cream and that was just out of this world. That guy is a genius of tastebuds.  The food. Oh my god the food. I'm a huge pork belly fan and actually reviewed Flemings steakhouse for their pork belly appetizer just last night. That was okay but the pork belly here was off the charts. So tender and tasty. Definite redemption from my mediocre steakhouse experience.  The combo is absolutely the way to go. For the reviewers who opted for the single meat and complained of the price, you're doing it wrong. I grew up eating shabu on Maui and the $20 range is a beautiful deal.  Atmosphere is nice and I'm guessing this place will blow up pretty quick. I'll be back soon!",

We ordered the spicy miso broth and sukiyaki and also got to try their raindrop cake for dessert. The dishes were presented nicely and we even had a small wooden block in front of our settings that said \"it's my first time.\" Overall, we had a positive experience, but don't know how often I would get shabu in the Vegas heat!

Well my search continues :/. I ordered the salmon and it came out sloppily cut and thin like lox. Yes LOX. The second I put it in the pot it fell apart and nearly disappeared. I ordered a Kombu base. The kombu had zero flavor, ZERO. The fact that they offered ponzu, raw egg, and goma sauce was nice, but the goma sauce was soooo thIn, it was practically water. They really should offer a small plate to transfer food from pot to sauce/mouth otherwise your sauce gets extremely watered down and messy.   No utensils, water bath to clean out the pot.  Arnold palmers made with green tea were good. Gave the girl a huge tip and we stayed behind for 30 minutes after ate to catch up with friends and she just seemed annoyed and rude.  Sukiyaki is nothing like their sukiyaki.... it was more like an extra sweet teriyaki flavor. Probably won't return here or recommend.",

The service is great.  Everyone was very attentive.  We ordered a sake that I ended up not liking.  The server could tell and switched it out, no questions asked.    And, of course,  the food is bomb!!!  The Kobe beef was great but I honestly prefer the Yojie cut.  It is less expensive than the Kobe and melts in your mouth!",

I have been here like four times and each and every time was excellent!   The service is awesome! They really take the time to explain everything to first time swish swisher's lol.   The food is amazing! My go to order is the combo plate with Yojie's cut and the pork belly with sukiyaki! I always like to finish up all the meat with the rice first! Then I throw the whole bowl of veggies and noodles in the pot last and make some udon soup! It's so good!   I like ending it with some chocolate fondue. That's always fun !   Just recently I went there and guess who was there!?! Jo Koy, the part owner and comedian! He was absolutely what made the night special. Jo Koy comped our dessert which was so nice of him. Not only is he funny but also a total sweet heart.   Yojie will always be my go to Japanese fondue place !",

We found this place through word of mouth and celebrated my dad's birthday here. Since then, our family has returned 3-4 more times and service has been consistently good.   Of the hot pot/shabu shabu places I've tried in Las Vegas, Yojie has the highest quality slices of beef. Order the beef (sumo portion), ponzu and peanut dipping sauces (ask for them to mix the garlic in), and the spicy miso broth. Everyone gets their own shabu pot to cook their veggies and meat in.   Pro tip: dip a slice of beef in the boiling water for only a few seconds until it changes color then dip it in the sauces. Do not dump the entire plate of meat in. The beef should only take a few seconds to cook to maintain its tender and juicy consistency-- any longer and it becomes tough.",

Would highly recommend. The price is high, about $30 per person including dessert split between people but the portion size is huge enough to where I took the noodles home to have for breakfast the next day. The only thing I would change is the amount of vegetables. There was only a few cabbage slices, a broccoli, two carrots, a slice of onion and a half of a shiitake mushroom which was kind of sad. It would be nice to have a extra side of vegetables but I think (not sure) that they change extra for more vegetables.",

    "text": "This is a hot pot slash fondue type restaurant in Summerlin area. I had a really good dinner tonight with a friend. We were welcomed by the chef and seated immediately. My friend has been here a handful of times and the chef remembered him which I thought was cool.  The restaurant was modern, clean, and had fun music with Japanese TV game shows playing. The entire restaurant was bar seating. They had high seating and lower seating that surrounded the staff. Since I'm Asian I already know the deal. You pick a meat, a broth, and extras. The meats come in different sizes based on ounces. If you let the staff know it is your first time then they'll explain the intended way to eat and show you.  I picked their house special cut of meat in the largest \"sumo\" size (10 ounces) with the suggest broth of sukiyaki. It was beef. They had four broths to choose from and about 8 - 10 meats.   Aside from the rice and veggies that came with the order of meat, I ordered a side of udon noodles. It already came with udon noodles so I had a lot of noodles.   The meat was served with a pasteurized egg which was meant to dip the meat into AFTER cooking it in the meat. The egg did add a creamy taste to the sweet sukiyaki broth. A second egg for $1.50 is recommended if you get a larger portion of meat.  You get a bottle of alkalized water, tongs, and a ladle to help eat. The alkalized water is supposed to re-hydrate the constantly boiling pot of broth in front of you without diluting the flavor.  At first glance it didn't seem like a lot of food, but it was a really good, filling, almost \"light\" dinner. I ended up taking a container full of food home because of the extra udon I ordered. The sukiyaki broth was flavorful but a bit one-note aka boring. It was mostly sweet and nothing more. With the savory beef and creamy egg it was delicious.  I had one of their fondue for dessert that was delicious. I got the milk chocolate fondue with fruit and pastries. It came with bananas, strawberries, rice crispy treats, cake, and marshmallows. It was the perfect size for two and only $7.99.  They had great hot tea also.  Over all I thought dinner was memorable. I've done hot pot at home, but it was fun in a restaurant. The food quality was good. The meat was fresh as were the vegetables. I thought the staff was great. One of our severs boxed my udon for me. I felt really taken care of. The chef knew exactly how to talk to the diners to make them feel welcome and comfortable.   We spent just under $80 for the two of us. That was for two full sized meat entrees, two hot teas, an extra pasteurized egg, an extra order of meat, and dessert. I thought it was a a good price for the unique dining experience, food quality, and the service. Keep in mind they do have cheaper cuts of meat if it sounds expensive. I imagine the location adds to the cost.  I'll definitely be back for a treat like a date, a special occasion, or a celebration but not on a regular basis. It was good, but not great. I'll try one of their other broths next time also as the sukiyaki was just okay.  My advice to management is to put the music down. Dinner was so awkward because I kept having to repeat myself and ask my friend to repeat themselves. It made me not want to talk.",

Got seated on the high top bar and was immediately taken care of. Service here was on point, drinks and order taken very promptly and our food came out quicker than we could get situated. We both had the sukiyaki dinner, broth was perfect, slightly sweet, slightly salty. I had the veggie platter and it had so much variety.... broccoli, glass noodles, onions, shiitake mushrooms, carrots, Napa cabbage, udon noodles and tofu. Didn't need any meat with that! Meal also comes with a raw egg (or dipping sauce of your choice, i got the swishing sauce), unlimited sauce and rice. We left there so stuffed i was a little bummed bc i wanted to try their dessert fondue so badly! (matcha green tea, dark or white dipping chocolate with fruits). This restaurant is super clean (walked in and can't eventually tell its a cook your own kinda place, can't smell it at all), nice counter tops, awesome vibe, nice artwork, hooks under the table for ladies purse, and USB CHARGING PLUGS!!!! I mean what other restaurants have a charging plug at your table?!?!  You can tell a lot of thought went into this restaurant and it really shows, everything from the menu to the little things like the check/bill holder. Would definately come back here again!",

    "text": "While the food and service were pretty good, my biggest issue was with the bar/counter setup.  All the great shabu shabu meals I've ever had consist of a group of 4+ sitting around one big pot while chatting, swishing, and drinking away.  Here?  If I want to kanpai it up (they say liquor is coming soon) with the fourth person in the party, I have to get up out of my seat, walk 3 chairs down to clink glasses and shoot.  Then stand awkwardly making small talk for 20 seconds before walking back.  That's pretty lame.    It may just be a cultural thing.  Three American dudes probably don't want to share a pot, thus this singular experience.  It's easy to see the powers that be put a lot of time and effort into making Yojie look and run as well as it does, but I'd rather order matzo ball soup and a pastrami sandwich in this setting.  Also:  - The atypical tonkotsu broth goes best with pork or maaaybe chicken.  Beef doesn't work.   - Cherry blossom tea was terrific. - Trust me and at least get the samurai size.  My wife crushed this serving and was ready for more.   - Since shabu shabu is generally a winter meal, they definitely make the room cold enough to feel that way.  Bring a jacket.    They have plans to open up more locations in Vegas, so count on me as a regular at one of the others that are group friendly.",

Its a traditional shabu restaurant with all the seating being in a U shape so everyone is facing inward. So there really isn't a lot of seats but we arrived at just the right time because as soon as we were seated a line started to form and their wait began. When you walk in they all greet you with something, not sure what it was that they said but they did it for every customer so it was really cool to see all the attention each person got from the start.   Our server was incredibly friendly, she explained the way the menu works and helped with some suggestions. I got the spicy broth with a combination of the beef and chicken. I loved the broth! I got to say I drank it all after I ate all the meat. My son and I shared he wanted more, lol. The food is brought out quick and off we go to eating deliciousness!! The food overall was one of the best shabu I've had. They let you pick 2 sauces, I had the ponzu and another sweet one (forgot the name). The ponzu was my sons favorite while I enjoyed the sweet one a bit more.   To end our evening we tried the green tea chocolate fondue with strawberries and bananas. Omg! Get it! You must!",

For the people that don't know what this place is, it's basically this: you're given a soup of your choice and a meat of your choice(they also have salmon which I rly like), brown or white rice, and vegetables and noodles if you want them. Then you cook the meat/salmon (and the vegetables if you want) in the soup that's boiling over a heating thing. My favorite soup is the sukiyaki with either the Kobe beef or salmon. After you finish the meat, you can cook the udon noodles in the soup, which is one of my favorite parts. I would also recommend their deserts: chocolate of your choice fondue with a platter of your choice. They have fruits, cakes, Rice Krispies, marshmallows, and more. Hope this helps!",

The staff were all friendly and accommodating. Really great service and atmosphere. Haniza Ariana (girl with the purple hair) Is fun and great to talk to. We had the chicken sukiyaki which also comes with pasteurized egg dipping sauce. Now it may sound strange but it's so delicious. All the veggies were good. We the. Decided to indulge with some desert. The green tea white chocolate fondue is seriously to die for. Everything was superb. Definitely coming back soon. Our new favorite spot.   Thanks again Jo. I don't know how I missed the fact that the owner is in fact a famous comedian that I saw frequently on Chelsea Handler show. So sorry Jo.",

The waiter, who was pretty nice, talked me into staying. The other staff was also friendly. I got the rib eye, but the broth to cook it in was only OK. I've had better. I also have had better choices of things to put in the pot. I only got two measly cubes of tofu. I would've liked more. My biggest complaint about this place was how the staff were in the back but in the open using their phones when there was down times. When they put their phones down, they didn't wash their hands. Ever since we got smart phones, I constantly see this with restaurant workers now. Management should get on their cases. No, it's not OK to use your phones while you're serving customers, even if you're not doing anything for two minutes!!!",

But coming here every time is always an internal debate for me because it takes soooo long to get seated, to get your order taken, to receive food and eventually to receive a check and pay. It seems like they only staff one service during peak hours and doesn't adequately train their staff the importance of sense of urgency, which in turn turning the service into a vicious cycle of eternal waiting.  Last time when my friend and I went there, it took them one hour-60 minutes!! To bring out the dessert we ordered. It was a fruit fondue- about four strawberries, half a banana and 5-6 pieces of cubes of pre-made cake. It escaped us HOW could cutting of such minimal food take an entire hour?! And we asked for the progress 3 times during that hour and every time we told the server that we might just cancel the dessert, she assured us that it would come out within 2 minutes. The promise was never kept.   All in all, good food. But too frustrating to dine in, unless you have at least 2 hours to spare for sitting in a restaurant, searching for your waiter.",

    "text": "#2 review for Yelp 100 Challenge   Dip, swirl, and swallow.  Double dip if you dare. It's all good. It's shabu shabu! Don't forget to masticate and savor each flavor your palate tastes.  I made sure we were going to dine here during our Vegas trip for Thanksgiving 2015.  I had to see JoKoys new spot.  Gotta support the Kuyas out there!  Dana greeted us with a smile and what started out as a miscommunication regarding reservations worked out at the end.  So. It's a solid 4 1/2  stars.    The place was designed as a typical shabu spot I've been to. Rectangular layout of seatings, counter style.  This way the servers can efficiently maneuver themselves around all the customers.   It's modern and sleek design gives it a great ambiance to dine for small and large groups.  One side is the low bar section  and opposite side is the high bar.  I like the low bar.  Makes me feel safer since I'm short.  Hahaha  I started with their Organic green tea with diffuser.  Cute little gadget which I am not accustomed to.  But I figured it out.  Loved the warmth of the hot tea for the 40 degree temp in sin city.  Dana was great at explaining how their menu works even though it wasn't our first time having shabu shabu.  I like to see that at new establishments.  So, thank you Dana.  You did great sweetie!  We ordered- Kurobuta pork in sukiyaki.  Fresh. Tasty. Loved it.  Pork belly in tonkatsu. Duuuuude... oink heaven!  Prime rib in sukiyaki was my fav.   Absolutely great quality of meats there Josep!  Loved the service.  Parking was a breeze at a huge shopping plaza.  Definitely a must do when I'm in Vegas again!  Can't wait to return!",

    "text": "*Warning: Long Review*  Let me start by saying that both my boyfriend and i REALLY enjoyed our experience at Yojie!   Neither one of us had ever been to a Japanese fondue spot before, but I insisted on this place for his birthday a couple of weeks ago. I was curious to try it, and, i must admit, we both like Jo Koy, so the fact that he is  the owner helped persuade him.    It was a Wednesday evening, so we weren't surprised it was a slow night for them. We had the awesome ambience and 90's r&b music all to ourselves. Perfect for our date... When we got there, we were immediately greeted by our server, Michael. When we told him it was my bf's birthday, he brought out a cute little wooden block that says \"Happy Birthday\" on it...  We explained it was our first time there, so Michael was VERY accommodating and explained how Japanese fondue works.  He even let us record him for social media purposes! He's very sweet, and helpful and a total cutie pie. I also appreciated that he and his other coworkers were very attentive and joked with us a lot along the way. I appreciate good customer service, and they provided it.   The food is excellent. We went with a combination platter that Michael recommended with the beef and pork and paired it with the egg sauce, Shabu shabu.  The combination platter was big enough to feed both of us and it was only $24.99 ! I don't know how they stay in business, maybe with people that eat more than us.   What ABSOLUTELY made our night, though, was the fact that Jo Koy and his wife came in for a late night dinner! My boyfriend couldn't stop cheering the entire time.  seriously, if you don't know who this guy is, you should! That way, if he happens to walk in on your visit there, you can fangirl like we did and ask him for selfies and snapchat videos! Which he will gladly comply to btw, he's cool like that. He even treated us to a complimentary dessert for the occasion. It was a green tea- white chocolate fondue with delicious fruit, brownies, marshmallows, etc. I was in love!    Hope your experience is as awesome as ours was. Say Marcela sent you! It won't mean anything to them, but it'll make me feel special :P",

Perfect choice because I was starving! I couldn't decide which dip I wanted though so I splurged a little and  ordered half of the sukiyaki and half tonkatsu. To be honest, the tonkatsu was just okay. You can definitely taste the broth but it wasn't all that flavorful in my opinion. The sukiyaki on the other hand was sweet and tasty. If the sweetness is a little too much for you, they advice you to add a little more water just to dilute it. This will be my go to when I come back!   This place is not really group friendly. I understand the concept of it being a bar because of the individual cooker but in cases where there's a large group like I was with today, you're only able to converse with those sitting next to you. Also, it kinda keeps you from sharing food with everyone in your group which could be a good or bad thing.   Servers are helpful especially when you're a first timer.   I'm still hoping to see and take a picture with owner,  Jo Koy. Hasn't happened yet but maybe if I come more often. I'm bound to run into him, right? Haha",

We were seated right away.   We were handed our menus & our server gave us a few mins to figure out what we wanted. Apparently they're coming out with a new menu & the pork belly won't be included, at least that's what we were told. I ordered the samurai korobuta(sp?) meat and spicy miso base with brown rice & the sweet & savory sauce. So I've never had korobuta meat & I must say... it's delicious! When the meat came out, it honestly didn't look like much. I thought I'd be able to finish it without a problem but I ended up giving away like a fourth of my meat to my friend. The spicy miso went well with the meat but I believe the tonkatsu is a better pairing? I'm not sure. But basically, you're able to cook the meat in the soup for 10-15 seconds then you may devour.   Our server was very nice & came back frequently to check on us to see if we were doing okay. Also, if you're running out of base, all you gotta do is ask!",

    "text": "What a nice and relaxing experience. The environment was modern and has a unique touch. It's only bar seating. Everyone was nice and was super eager to explain the hotpot concept. As small as the whole place is, it was still definitely spacious when eating. Doesn't feel crowded at all. The menu is very easy to read and the presentation of the food is clean and simple. 3 different broths to choose from. We did the spicy miso and tonkotsu which we're both very flavorful. Bowl of veggies was a good variety. U can choose from brown or white rice. They also serve you different condiments and extra toppings to make the meat super flavorful. The swisher and goma sauces are bomb. The yellowish one is the sweet and savory option and it was our favorite. We chose the yojie cut for our meat and it was fresh. Only bad thing I could say about our experience was we ordered too much. There's 3 sizes and we got the large for each of us instead of the regular. Large came with 15 prices and the regular comes with 10-12. So I guess depends how hungry you are. Pricing isn't bad either. Oh and only downside is I wish they gave more noodles! I loved the udon noodles. Iced green tea is bomb, not sweet. Oh and must I say they play THE jams while you are eating. All the slow jams and 90s music you know, so it makes eating much more fun! Haha",

There's a good selection of meats or veggies. Our server was a nice young girl and she explained to us how it worked. We got their house meat and she told us what it came with and about the soup base you can get. We got the spicy miso and it was delicious! The order came with rice, veggies, udon noodles, and the two dipping sauces. You can ask for the hot sauce too but it's super hot! Like a little drop is enough. Anyway, the meat is sliced super thin so it cooks in just a few seconds. It's really great quality meat and tasted really fresh. We got the green tea white chocolate fondue for dessert and it was delicious and fun to eat.",

It's a sushi bar style so it's tough for groups to have a conversation. The food was pretty straight forward. You pick a meat, broth and your sauce. It comes with veggies, noodles, and rice. I had the Geisha portion of fish -5 oz... I was full since I ate all my veggies and asked to pay the $3 for extra cabbage. It was good. Not something I'd rave about but solid. Not much to complain about. I'd go again but not as often.",

Service- As soon as you enter they greet you, servers are very informative on the menu and they teach you how to cook/eat the food if you have never been before. The servers always stay on top of your needs and they always come to check back frequently. (My water was always filled which I always think that's a good way to measure service. Because they kept coming back to make sure we were okay.)  Food- My girlfriend got the Yojie meat plate and I got the Prime rib cuts, absolutely fantastic. The meats were of such high quality you could tell just by looking at it. The sauces were otherworldly good. And the rice were free refills! That's always a plus for me. They had two choices white or brown rice, which I thought was a nice touch. And at the end of the meal if you have left over vegetables they make an awesome soup to help put you over the top.  Restaurant- Kindve small, they sit you next to other parties, but it is definitely a beautiful restaurant. They have small personal hot plates for every seat, so you don't have to share with others in your party. And dead phones are never a worry here! (I always deal with that) They have wall plugs so you can charge your phone under every seat which I thought was awesome.  Overall an amazing experience and can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Finally, a reliable shabu place on the Westside! This place already has the reputation of having a wait, so my husband and I decided to check it out on July 4, hoping there weren't too many folks leaving their backyards. We went around 5pm and had zero wait. There was actually a large party of 12 getting ready to set-up on the low-tops. As Philip T. mentioned, it is a bit awkward to have a large group here, but the staff does do their best to accommodate. Service here as super attentive and my delicious iced green tea was always replenished. I thought they did have high quality meats - I opted for the Yojie's cut (geisha size) since it seemed like the best bang for your buck. I got the Spicy Miso dip for $2 extra. Paying extra for a broth/dip is not something I'm used to so that does add to the $$$ you are shelling out. They also do have unlimited rice, but not unlimited veggies like other places. The extra money you end up paying I don't mind so much since this place is convenient. I did think it was interesting that as the owner greeted us, he kept on referring to having a nice \"lunch\". We ate early evening, around 5pm, so I was curious if that meant we'd get charge lunch pricing. We ended up getting charge dinner, which I was fine with, but would probably try to go for weekend lunches from now on. Although my husband and I were pretty stuffed, the server suggested the green tea and white chocolate fondue for dessert, which I'm really glad we got. Not too sweet and a perfect sharing portion for two (maybe 3) people.",

Even though I hit all 5 stars, I feel like this spot is going to be even MORE amazing in a short time, so you should get yourself over there asap! My husband and I had a great time, as well as enjoy the wonderful food.   As soon as we walked in, we knew we were in a place that exemplified the example of \"shabu shabu subject matter experts\" haha. Anton the owner knows his restaurant, his food, and his team. From the beautiful art and mirrors on the artfully tiled walls, to the ambiance of immersive, enjoyable music and entertaining television, we knew were came to the right place. We had many places like this to visit back home in Orange County, but when we saw this in Las Vegas (where we live now), our eyes opened and mouths dropped LOL! Yay! Shabu Shabu!!  Denise was the first to say hello to us and accommodated us immediately as soon as we walked in. She was very approachable and went over all of the menu details with us. My husband needed a Shabu Shabu protocol refresher since it had been a while since he had said cuisine, and Denise was great at presenting us with the manner in which the food was to be served to us.   As Denise prepped the broth, Carl came to us and offered drinks. He eagerly shared how excited they are to start serving libations soon, and kindly apologized for not having their upcoming saketinis just yet. No apology needed. We're coming back when you do! :) Cheers!  Anton then came and said hello, and introduced himself as the owner. His enthusiasm and pride in his work definitely showed through as he spoke with each of the patrons eating there. I am so excited for this team and i hope this location succeeds!   We were also served by Anna and Mica...basically everyone made their rounds to all of the customers to make sure everyone was ok, so I have to say that they did a great job in keeping all of the food fresh, tea and water filled, and guests happy.   Aside from speaking to the servers and owner, my husband didn't say much of a word to me...not because he was unhappy, but because his mouth was always so full! What a piggie. We both left very happy and satisfied after a final treat to some Mochi. The green tea was our fave!   We'll be back. Sorry we didn't get to meet the chefs back there. You deserve a big thank you as well. Your rice is on point and perfect! We'll be back! Best of success and luck to Yojie's!",

    "text": "Man have I been waiting for this. I moved from California over a year ago and have yet to find a good place to eat Shabu. Me and my girlfriend ended up buying a shabu pot to eat it at home because the restaurants just couldn't cut it. You can imagine how excited we were when we found out that Yojie ( which has a few locations in California ) had come to town.  I'm so happy they brought their quality and service to Vegas. They have very high quality meats, in different grades all the way up to wagyu. Some people complain about the price and portions because they are used to all you can eat shabus in the area or shabus that give you a lot of low quality meat. Yojie has prices comparable to any other good shabu places in California and I would happily pay more for the quality and experience they offer. They even offer sushi grade salmon that you can just dip in sauce and eat raw if you chose to.  And their service. The definition of top notch. Everyone is attentive and friendly and make sure everything is provided before you ask, or promptly when you do. The service alone is worth 5 stars.  While they have a large selection of meats and sauce options, NO MATTER what you do get the green tea fondue for dessert. It is heaven on a tiny fork. We got the fruit and pastries so I highly recommend that. We were so that full we couldn't walk but we still stuffed our faces with delicious green tea chocolate dipped sweets. It was AMAZING.  Needless to say, we are fans and will be back many, many times.",

The servers were kind, informative & assisted us with preparing our meals. (Other places we've gone to expected us to know what we were doing which lead our sauce to completely burn). They were refilling our drinks & checking up on us to make sure everything was ok. We had the pork belly, chicken, & Yojie special. Everything had so much flavor. We also ordered the cherry blossom tea & Arnold Palmer made with green tea. For dessert we had the platter with fruits & an assortment of cakes with green tea chocolate. Amazeballs. We'll definitely be back! It was worth the 30 minute drive across town.",

Order the type and kind of meat which is cut paper thin and get vegetables  and udon and tofu to cook in the broth.  They also give you a choice of dips such as sesame, ponzu or a soy sauce.    This is served with a bowl of rice and you can ask for more and they gladly accommodate you at no additional charge.  It was very good except I wish they would give more udon noodles, tofu and Nappa Cabbage.  We had to order additional noodles and Vegetables as in down home cooking the vegetables is as much the star of the meal as the meat.",

Hospitality and Facility - 5 stars Food Quality - 5 stars Bang for the Buck - 3 stars Flavor - 3 1/2 stars  This is in comparisons to a similar place that's on Sahara and another location (which we prefer) on Spring Mountain.  Pros, the staff was very friendly. The owner was walking around and talking with the crowd. The waitress was attentive and made sure we were enjoying our dining experience. The restaurant was very clean but that is to be expected for being in business for two weeks and is closer than the other place we go to. The decor was modern and they have induction cooktops (really loved this fact, didn't get that hot in the restaurant and little safer if you have kids). Depending on the entree ordered, you can choose up to four different \"meat\" serving sizes.   Cons, pricier than the other place we go to. Just like other places, seating is limited. Tried making reservations but got an answering machine with generic message.   But at the end of the day the ponzu and goma sauces is what makes the food and we prefer the sauces from the other place we go to.   For the convenience and atmosphere I would come back. For the price and flavor I would rather drive to the one we usually go to on Spring Mountain.",

So after moving to Vegas, we started craving it. I have to say Yojie is just as good if not better than Cal Shabu. It's so good, that when we're craving it, we freakin drive all the way from Henderson to eat here. Ugh! So lazy and we hate the drive but when we get that craving, we have to have it. This place totally reminds us of home. Their meat and veggies are good and the udon afterwards is the best. Love the servers because they're always attentive. They'll fill your sauce up if needed like I always do. If you want good shabu, please come here. We tried that other place with good reviews that's in Henderson but it's not as good as Yojie.  By the way, after eating here, we like to go next door to Jollibee and get their peach mango pie for dessert.",

I loved the clean and modern decor of the restaurant, which offered cozy seating arrangement. We can't wait to try the dessert chocolate fondue on our next visit. Here comes the constructive criticism:  the ribeye cut in the Geisha size pot was too expensive for 5 oz. of meat. The Yojie cut of beef offered more value for your buck, which was leaner and tasted just as good. My husband said that it was annoying that the restaurant opened for a year, but continues to list liquor on the menu, albeit they have not secured a liquor license yet.",

It's always such a blast to have dinner there. Everyone there goes out of their way to make sure that every customer is happy. The food is scrumptious, fresh, healthy and can please just about anyone's palate. We love the Shabu Shabu cooking style and it's so awesome that once you're done with your meat or seafood entree you have a delicious flavorful soup to enjoy. My girls say that they want to have every birthday dinner there. Every time they have a playdate or sleepover they beg me to take them there and I am always happy to oblige.

It's a cook yourself style of eating is case you didn't get it.  The prices are reasonable, the sauces are fantastic (they have ghost pepper !!!) and the green tea fondue is awesome.

I like spicy so i go for spicy miso most of the times. Ponzu sauce is perfect with everything. I put more chili oil in there though. I also like swisher sauce so I switched it once a while. Goma sauce is good with veggie but I can live without it. Service is excellent. Servers always smile and friendly. When they are packed, the service is a little slow but it's understandable.  The decoration and atmosphere is nice and clean. (I love purple and white so they win lol)  The price is good compare to the portion. One order of meat fills me. It is just perfect. But my bf is a big guy so he usually orders combo. I ordered combo once, I couldn't finish it, and the leftover wasn't that good. I prefer one order of meat and end with Green tea white chocolate plate. I have food orgasm every time I come here.",

Their staff is so welcoming and friendly! I've ate at this restaurant so many times that the whole staff knows me! Their food is that good! I personally know Mendrick Leelin who is the co-founder/CEO of the restaurant and Anton Guerrero who is the franchise owner. Both guys are very sweet and so down to earth! The interior design of the restaurant is phenomenal. It is very contemporary and modern! I love that under the seating that there is a place to hang your purse and an outlet to charge your phone. The food here is VERY clean and healthy! I usually always order the Yojie cut beef in sumo size as picture is shown which is the largest size because I'm always extremely hungry every time I come to the restaurant. Every order comes with a bowl of veggies with noodles in case you want to make udon or ramen if you are really hungry. Plus you get to choose your side of rice if you want white rice or brown rice. Make sure to save room for dessert! My fave as shown is the fresh strawberries with green tea white chocolate fondue! I'm not really a big fan of sweets, BUT this is the best dessert on their menu! This is a MUST have!",
